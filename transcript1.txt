[10.30s - 11.68s] SPEAKER_00: Hey Lawrence, happy Monday.
[11.70s - 12.19s] SPEAKER_01: Happy Monday.
[12.85s - 13.95s] SPEAKER_00: Did you have a good weekend?
[14.05s - 15.15s] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, really good weekend.
[15.17s - 17.05s] SPEAKER_01: It was a bit busy, but had a lot of fun.
[17.11s - 17.51s] SPEAKER_01: How about you?
[18.01s - 19.23s] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, mine was good.
[19.33s - 20.91s] SPEAKER_00: I just had a relaxing one.
[21.31s - 22.14s] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, had a big week.
[22.90s - 27.47s] SPEAKER_00: Yeah well first week on the new job so yeah I just wanted to chill out with my family at home.
[27.49s - 29.03s] SPEAKER_01: How are you settling in with everything?
[29.05s - 30.35s] SPEAKER_00: Yeah not too bad.
[30.37s - 32.49s] SPEAKER_00: It's been a steep learning curve though.
[32.89s - 33.73s] SPEAKER_01: Yeah I can imagine.
[33.87s - 36.56s] SPEAKER_01: I've been in for four years and I only recently switched departments.
[36.72s - 37.26s] SPEAKER_00: Oh really?
[37.52s - 38.28s] SPEAKER_00: When did that happen?
[38.72s - 39.66s] SPEAKER_01: About two months ago.
[39.68s - 42.76s] SPEAKER_01: I mean not much has changed but there's just new stuff to learn.
[43.04s - 44.12s] SPEAKER_00: Yeah I know what you mean.
[44.56s - 46.23s] SPEAKER_00: So what made you change departments?
[46.60s - 49.21s] SPEAKER_01: Well, this new role came up and I was pretty interested in it.
[49.63s - 52.89s] SPEAKER_01: And it came with a bit of a pay rise as well, so I thought I'd give it a go.
[52.91s - 54.69s] SPEAKER_00: So you're making heaps more money, that's good.
[55.37s - 61.48s] SPEAKER_01: I wouldn't say heaps more money, but the role does come with more responsibility, so the increase in pay is kind of justified.
[61.50s - 62.84s] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, no, that's fair enough.
[63.88s - 66.76s] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, another thing I'm adjusting to is living with my parents again.
[68.47s - 71.67s] SPEAKER_01: So you moved here for the new job, and now you're living with your parents?
[71.83s - 72.53s] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, that's right.
[72.57s - 77.59s] SPEAKER_00: So I moved out of home when I finished uni, and then I've just moved back in with mum and dad.
[77.67s - 81.61s] SPEAKER_00: So I'm still adjusting, but they're over the moon that I'm back.
[81.85s - 82.66s] SPEAKER_01: You're kidding.
[82.83s - 85.18s] SPEAKER_01: My parents were so happy the moment I left.
[85.58s - 86.30s] SPEAKER_00: No way.
[87.48s - 90.04s] SPEAKER_01: OK, maybe more relieved than happy.
[90.06s - 91.88s] SPEAKER_01: I like to think anyway.
[91.90s - 94.72s] SPEAKER_00: So how do you keep in touch with them now?
[95.14s - 97.12s] SPEAKER_01: Well, we catch up once a month, and we go to get lunch.
[98.58s - 101.80s] SPEAKER_01: As much as I do miss them, I still appreciate having time to myself.
[102.36s - 103.58s] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, no, I know what you mean.
[103.64s - 104.38s] SPEAKER_00: I'm a bit the same.
[104.40s - 107.29s] SPEAKER_00: Well, it was good talking to you, but I better get back to work.
[107.33s - 107.59s] SPEAKER_00: All good.
