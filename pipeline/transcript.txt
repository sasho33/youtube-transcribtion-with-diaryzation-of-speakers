[0.03s - 28.82s] SPEAKER_01: Hello everyone. Hello Gyorgy, how are you? Hi Engin, I'm feeling good. That's good, that's good, that's great. So, let me understand your form. Can you do like this? Wow, yeah, huge. Yes. So, I guess you are in good form.
[30.00s - 59.87s] SPEAKER_00: I think that I'm in pretty good shape and I'm big, strong, I have no pain in the arm and I think this is a good shape now for me. That's good, that's good. And do you follow your opponent? What he says, how is his form and things like that? Yeah, he told me that, I saw that he made a post that
[60.46s - 88.76s] SPEAKER_00: He feels no injuries and he's in much better shape than before and he said that it will be a very close match. Yeah, and what do you think? I think that it will be a good match, but I think that I will win. Okay. I'm confident. You're confident? Yes. Do you think that Dave
[89.97s - 113.40s] SPEAKER_01: is not confident or like when he says 50-50 or he is realistic or he is just making you feel like relaxed and too comfortable or is it a strategy or he's saying really how he feels? I don't think that this is a strategy I think that he
[113.89s - 142.49s] SPEAKER_00: really thinks that it will be a close match because he knows what he is capable of and I also know what he is capable of and I think it will be a good match. Okay, what is he capable of? I think that he is one of the strongest when he is not injured. Okay, and what is his weapons, you know? He is powerful in inside, side pressure,
[142.91s - 171.78s] SPEAKER_00: without wrist you saw him against Vitaly last match Vitaly beat him without the strap when they go in the strap Dave destroyed him Vitaly said that I asked him the same thing Vitaly told me that if he wanted he would beat him in the strap as well he allowed him to go to his wrist but he said no I think that if Dave was smarter to go in strap Vitaly has no chance
[172.58s - 202.28s] SPEAKER_00: Def will stop him and... You saw what happened, it's my opinion. No, I understand. I'm also saying Vitaly's opponent, who was actually in the match, but... Who knows, yeah. Who knows, yeah. Yeah, but... Def is very powerful. He beat also Alex, so... Yeah. A lot of people underestimate him, but he's one of the strongest. He's... Can you... Can you... Okay, I will be very brutal with you, okay? Because that is more... tougher, you know?
[202.67s - 229.77s] SPEAKER_01: more real. Are you vulnerable for side pressure? Of course, this is if I toproll somebody and if he is very powerful side pressure, it's a problem for me. But just say that you didn't toproll and the wrist is like this. Do you? OK. The thing is, do you agree that Dave has better side pressure than you from the center?
[230.29s - 259.87s] SPEAKER_00: not talking about top rolls, not talking about hand control, but this? I'm not sure, because I'm now trying to improve this very much. Oh, okay. And this week I'm going to Tutankhamen to train 10 days with Sasho and Krasi. And I'm training only this side pressure. So I want to improve this very much. So you are training with who you said, Krasimiran? Yes, I'm going now this week to train 5-6 days with him.
[260.55s - 290.38s] SPEAKER_01: Krastimir, ok, ok and also Sasho Sasho, but do you agree that, do you agree that like Dave's you know with the pronator control side pressure is compared to them is probably stronger, right? stronger, yeah, but yeah, yeah because he's heavyweight, you know, but yeah, yeah, yeah they will be very good partners for me for this match, I think in my opinion yeah usually Georgi that we know has very good hand control wrist
[290.94s - 317.96s] SPEAKER_01: and front wrist and, but you usually over pronate. You don't really like bottom side of your hand and the top side of your hand, ulna and radius. If your ulna is 50, your radius is hundreds. So here lately you are balancing this because you, even you don't want your arm is whenever you attack, it is moving. So,
[318.23s - 341.23s] SPEAKER_01: Dave also has very strong pronator and a side pressure. Do you think you will be able to control here? Or do you think you will be able... Because once you go like this, I think you will feel his side pressure. But if you can control here, then it's different. I will try to control the side... I will try to control here. Not only here. Aha, okay. I'm trying to improve this.
[341.51s - 368.26s] SPEAKER_01: Okay, do you think there is a risk while you're trying to control here, you won't be attacking here, while you're trying to control here, you may be going with him? Do you think that... I don't think so. Okay, okay, yeah. My hand control is much better than his. Your what? Your hand control? My hand control and pronator. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I understand, yeah. Orda, Numbah.
[368.65s - 396.80s] SPEAKER_01: He says, Dave's wrist doesn't stand a chance. Let's go, he says. And Recto says, love from Macedonia for Georgi and revenge to Alex, he says. Yeah. Anyways. So another thing that, do you, do you think that if somehow Dave takes the center,
[397.64s - 427.52s] SPEAKER_01: and goes halfway to the winning position, and if you take his risk, do you think that it is dangerous? His side pressure would be dangerous? Or you think that there is no way that he can dead-risk press you? I think that he is very dangerous, but I think that my endurance is much better than his, and he will not be able to pin me that way. It will be a long match, but you saw...
[427.81s - 457.19s] SPEAKER_00: And even if he pins you, just say once, can he do that three times? You saw my match with Jerry. So I don't think that Jeff is stronger in that position than Jerry. So, and I think that now I'm much stronger than my shape against Jerry. Yeah. The only difference between Jerry and Dave, that Jerry directly dives here and then you have the cup, but, but
[457.43s - 487.08s] SPEAKER_01: Dave starts with outside pronation and keeps your wrist straight and then he presses so Dave, if he presses, he will be pressing more like far while Jerry was just diving here, you know, and then you didn't have any threat to the ear, you know so do you agree that there is a difference between them? A little difference, but I think that Jerry is more better in the endurance, much... Ah, ok, endurance, yeah
[487.40s - 512.79s] SPEAKER_01: your match with him was the last match and we had 16 matches and there were so many good matches like Ongarbe versus Michael as far as I remember, am I wrong? was it like that, yeah? Old card was amazing, not only... Amazing, and we were like all the adrenaline was gone and then we were just looking, watching your match
[513.22s - 537.58s] SPEAKER_01: And it was like, is it real? It still continues, you know, you guys were like, I mean, forever there, like the whole match was very long, yeah. And it was 3-2, right? 3-2, yeah, people were thinking that he will stop me and after that I will die, but it didn't happen, I was attacking till the end, you know. It was a very close match, very, very good match, yeah.
[538.01s - 566.51s] SPEAKER_01: the only unfortunate thing about that match was that it was after 15 matches if it was earlier, it would be even crazier but at the end we didn't have so much energy it was a very long event and people were exhausted yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, we were exhausted, you are right, you are right, yeah anyway, so... so you are basically saying that you are planning to control these pronators
[567.35s - 591.70s] SPEAKER_01: you are basically saying that you will do your best to not to go to the losing side yes because you training your side pressure and you are saying that even the match ends up here he won't be able to pin you three times for sure this is what you are saying I'm sure about that yeah maybe one time he can pin me but the next rounds I think
[592.17s - 619.92s] SPEAKER_01: he will not have the endurance. You know, we train sparring every day, two, three times a day. I don't think that he will have this endurance on the table. I understand. I understand. Yeah. Do you think that because of these, like, events and because of the level of the competition, you guys are, how to say,
[620.54s - 636.08s] SPEAKER_01: getting better and better by just, like, countering what the opponent's ability. Do you understand what I'm saying? Yes, I think that after each event, after each year,
[636.52s - 665.93s] SPEAKER_01: All of us are improving. This Georgi now, I think he's stronger than Georgi last year. It's my... Oh, for sure, for sure. Because I see my results in the gym, on the table, how I feel. Yeah. I'm sure, especially at the table, because whenever the competition level is, you know, really, like, high, and whenever you have very tough opponents,
[666.17s - 693.15s] SPEAKER_01: Many of them are well-rounded. You need to really prepare yourself for them. When the competition is lower, you're going to force yourself for that level. But when it is higher, then you need to really be prepared. Either you're going to be successful or you will be out of top 10. So that's why you need to force yourself. And Dave says that we will see him in top 10 very soon.
[694.35s - 722.69s] SPEAKER_01: I think that he deserves to be there, because I told you, for me... Oh, listen, for him to be in the top 10 soon, he needs to beat you. Yes, but... I will try to not lose, you know. Yeah, you are saying that maybe next time, Dave, but not this time, huh? Yeah. Yeah, OK, I understand, yeah. Anyway, so top role for Sumar says that $10 for Georgi from Bulgaria
[723.04s - 750.78s] SPEAKER_01: you will give to him later, I'm joking, greetings for Georgi. Yeah. Yeah. Whenever, whenever you, you, you talk about, you talk about Dave, I said like, what are his weapons? And you said you also counted his inside power. Do you see such possibility? To stop him inside? No, no. Him to go hook you.
[751.00s - 776.37s] SPEAKER_01: Oh, he cannot hook me, I'm pretty sure. Okay, who can hook you on this? Nobody in the world can hook me on the right hand. Nobody in the world can hook, yeah. Who is harder to hook? Your Vitaly Laletin? Or Hermes Gasparini? Or Michael? Or Devon? Or Levan? I'm not sure, but... Do you like your chances better?
[777.95s - 805.48s] SPEAKER_00: Look, for this I cannot transfer, but I think that I have, nobody has ever hooked me on the right hand in all my entire career. I cannot remember such a thing. I have seen the others hooked by another competitors. Not only, I'm not talking about East-West, I'm talking in the past, you know. No, no, I understand, I understand. There is one guy.
[805.75s - 834.65s] SPEAKER_01: Asking Engin, did Jerseys and Steinkarts get shipped? You are in North America or outside of North America? Because outside of North America, I think they are all shipped. And North America, probably 80, 90% of them ship. And I think today or tomorrow, everything will be all shipped out, you know. Anyways. So, so you are saying that you are the best top roller.
[835.33s - 860.08s] SPEAKER_01: in the super heavyweight category. I think yes, if I'm in good shape and no injuries. Yeah. And another question. Who would be your toughest opponent right now? Like who are favored against you in your head? Like do you think Levan would be favored against you or
[860.28s - 872.35s] SPEAKER_00: Levan will be difficult for me because he is very strong sideway. Michael is very difficult also for me. Maybe Kvikvinia.
[873.26s - 902.40s] SPEAKER_00: Kuykminia? Oh, because of this? Yes, maybe. I'm not sure. I have no idea. Baba, you just told me that Jerry couldn't beat you and Dave can't do that, but you are saying that now Kuykminia can do that. Yeah, yeah, but I don't say that he will beat me. I say that it will be a difficult match for me because Gennady is a warrior. I think Gennady is... Yeah, yeah, I know, I know. He's crazy. He doesn't like to lose at all. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Big Heart, he's like a...
[902.62s - 930.92s] SPEAKER_00: like a terminator on the table. Okay, who would win? You or Hermes? I think that you think in your head that you think that... I think that I would be top of him and after one match I would beat him, but one day we will see. Let's hope we will have a match. Yeah, yeah. And you would want a rematch with Alex Kurdech at some point? Of course, because in this match I lost half of my power.
[931.06s - 946.09s] SPEAKER_01: If it's possible, it will be here. The way that Kurdesha beat you, I know you were not ready. You were using antibiotics and there was a high level of inflammation. I was on 10 painkillers this day. I was sleeping.
[946.28s - 974.29s] SPEAKER_01: Yeah. Infection in the body, temperature... But the way that he beat you that match is almost the same exact way he beat you some years ago at the Zloty Tur. I'm not saying that he would beat you again if you were healthy or not. I'm not saying anything about that. But do you think that the way that Kurdecha pulled that day is similar to the way that Dave Chaffee pulls? Like outer side pressure, you know, with the pronation and out.
[974.68s - 997.28s] SPEAKER_00: I think it's the same, but with a little difference, because I think that Alex has a stronger wrist than Dave. Alex has a stronger wrist? Yes. But when they pulled the majority of the matches, I think they took Alex's wrist. Yeah, but now I think that he has a stronger wrist. Now.
[998.07s - 1027.08s] SPEAKER_00: And just to tell you about Zloty Tur, before the match with Alex, I had a 5 minute match against CYF. We killed each other. Oh, you had a long match before that. 2017, CYF won with heavyweight. And on Zloty Tur, we killed each other. 5 minutes match. I couldn't just put my hand on the table. Ok, I understand. So at some point, you guys need to pull again, you are saying? Yes, because...
[1027.60s - 1057.13s] SPEAKER_00: Everybody knows that I was, you know, it was not real. How about you versus Vitaly? It will be a good match, but I think that I will beat him. So you like that anyone who is trying to take your hand? I think that Vitaly has problems all his entire career against good top rowers. You saw his match with Elmas. Yeah. Do you think that he may be getting
[1057.50s - 1085.84s] SPEAKER_01: bigger, stronger with time? Compared to the time that he played against Hermes? I think yes, but all of us are improving, Genkin. All of us. But don't you think that because of his structure, his potential, maybe, like, a little bit more, like, we're talking about over two meter guy with really... Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.
[1086.19s - 1112.45s] SPEAKER_00: I'm not sure, Engin. I think that... No, no, I understand. Size is not always what is matter at all, you know. No, no. Vitaly Laletin is not like a regular guy that, you know, we say, oh, look at this guy, a big guy or something. When you are talking about, yeah. But I understand. I understand what you are saying. Engin, Vitaly, when he was competing, he lost 100 kilograms. He was not heavyweight.
[1113.55s - 1133.44s] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, he was even 90 kilos in 2011. His natural weight is 100 kilograms. No, no, no. Listen, just because he was that skinny, it doesn't mean that that's how heavy he should be. I think that he has structure. I mean, Levon was small as well, but he became up to 190 kilo guy, you know.
[1134.03s - 1156.00s] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but he was competing in WAF heavyweight. Vitaly couldn't... No, no, no. I mean, in earlier career, he was 110kg at the WAF and I think in the Georgian events, like, he has been like 90kg or something. Yeah, yeah. 100kg, yeah, sorry. Yeah. Did you know that, like, Vasily...
[1156.59s - 1184.39s] SPEAKER_00: Davut Aşvili has won against Levan, you know. I know this. I mean, 2018 was last year for Levan and Vitaly. Vitaly was 110 kg. All of us, me, Rezo, Arif, Levan, we were heavyweights. He was super heavyweight, yeah. Yeah, I think you and Arif had a very long match.
[1184.45s - 1212.45s] SPEAKER_01: And Levan and Rezo had a very long match. Yes. I beat Levan at all of the others and Levan beat me on the final. It was the match. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, so that is like for everyone who knows armwrestling, this is very exciting thing, you know, very exciting. Yeah. And there is another super chat.
[1213.82s - 1241.49s] SPEAKER_00: Emilian Marius, hello from Romania, see you in summer, Gheorghe. See you in summer, my friend, he is a friend of mine. He is a friend of yours? I am his idol and he will come with his girlfriend to train with me and my boys. He is from Romania. Ah, that's good. That's good, yeah. That's very nice, yeah. And what did you think about Morozov versus Vitaly?
[1242.81s - 1267.77s] SPEAKER_00: It was a very good match and it was bad that Murozov got injured, you know. Yeah, yeah. But it was a very good match, very good match. I was pretty sure that Murozov will win this match but, you know, sometimes... That happens, you know. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. And how is your left arm doing?
[1268.63s - 1298.38s] SPEAKER_01: I think it's pretty good, pretty good. Do you train? Do you even train? I train, not like right, but I train to pump, to feel it. But I think it's very good. Can I ask you something? When you were really, really healthy, earlier career, let's just say middle of the 2010s, you know, like which arm you think was better, right or left or same? I think right was better again, but left was very close, very close to it.
[1298.80s - 1322.73s] SPEAKER_01: but right now there is a little bit more distance? 20% maybe 20% but if you just had a three months later a left arm match and if you just slow down with the right arm and go with the left would that 20% would go down to 10%? I think that it will improve much yeah I am sure about that okay yeah yeah yeah
[1324.92s - 1354.89s] SPEAKER_01: And you said that Michael would be a very tough match for you. Yes. Okay. The question, do you plan or are you already training your shoulder press? I'm training it. Can you do it or? I'm doing it. It's not easy, but I will make this weapon in my arsenal. Yeah. You know, because that is the part that is missing. Yeah. That's the part because your hand control and everything is just very, very good.
[1355.24s - 1372.54s] SPEAKER_01: little bit more sides and this and then you will be like perfectly you know. Angin you are right because I know that these are weak parts of me and I want to improve them and I train more. Yeah and when you said that
[1372.80s - 1399.83s] SPEAKER_01: like Michael would be a difficult match, it is mainly because of this, right? If you have very efficient shoulder pressure, it would increase your chance, right? I would top him very easy, but to finish him, it would be hard without press, you know? But also you have very good endurance, he would be very good, yeah. Yes. And then from here, I want to go to another question.
[1401.28s - 1427.64s] SPEAKER_01: Because of the same exact reason, do you think that Vitaly may have problem with Michael? Very big See, this is exactly what I'm thinking I'm not saying that Vitaly cannot beat him But I'm just saying that if some part of that match stops Vitaly is over It's over, right? Yes Vitaly is not so powerful like Kermes and he doesn't have this press
[1428.40s - 1448.90s] SPEAKER_00: He has one arm and one fast start. But if Michael stops him, believe me, very big problems for Vitaly. Yeah, this is exactly what I'm thinking. I'm not saying if Michael can stop him or not stop him. There is a possibility he's going to flash spin him. But just somehow the match stops here.
[1449.68s - 1476.04s] SPEAKER_01: Like, does Vitaly have that pressure that Hermes has? No finish. No, no. I mean, my opinion, no, as well, you know. I don't think he has it. But maybe he can top-roll so good and then he can get everything, you know, here, here, here, here. And then maybe he wouldn't need it, but... I don't know. Believe me, it will be a very difficult match for Vitaly.
[1476.20s - 1500.59s] SPEAKER_01: Michael is very difficult to beat. So do you agree with Vitaly when he said that Michael is more difficult for him than Devon is? Yes. You agree with that? Yes. I understand, yeah. And what is the possibility Vitaly to beat both Michael and Devon and pull the winner of the Hermes and Lev Amnatsch?
[1501.03s - 1528.20s] SPEAKER_00: I don't think that Vitaly can beat Devon, and I don't think that he will beat Michael. Oh, so you are saying that Laletin is going to lose both matches? I think that Devon will destroy him. Oh. Look, Vitaly is dangerous because he's very tall, long arm, and he's making very good grip here, but Devon is very smart, very clever, and
[1528.65s - 1557.81s] SPEAKER_00: He will not allow Vitaly to beat him on the grip, you know. And after that... I think Devon is way more powerful than Vitaly. You are saying that Laletin is going to lose against both guys? In my opinion, yes. Devon is becoming bigger and he is very dangerous, you know. He is also very tall, very clever and...
[1558.49s - 1584.20s] SPEAKER_01: Way more experienced than the other guys. I understand. And how do you see Hermes versus Levan? I think Levan will beat him. Levan is very strong. In my opinion, yeah. And if you had a match with Levan, what would your chance be?
[1587.71s - 1608.66s] SPEAKER_00: I think that I can stop him and beat him, but I have to be very, very, very good prepared for maybe 5-6 months only for him. Do you think that to get that match, do you think that you have to beat some of the guys? Yeah, I have to beat maybe Hermes, maybe some of the top guys again to have this match.
[1609.33s - 1636.79s] SPEAKER_00: but I have played against Levan more than 10 times and I know my chances I have all the time success to open his wrist but I was not stronger in the side you know he is more powerful than before but I think that I am also more powerful than before in my past I understand, I understand, yeah okay, let's talk about the Arlington event Arlington event and
[1637.21s - 1665.83s] SPEAKER_01: Let's start with a legendary match. At least one of them is for sure legend. Yannis Amolios. And Mindaugas is legend in making. So how do you see this match? And this is exactly your specialism, you know, like specialty, you know, like top role versus top role. I think that Yannis will beat him.
[1666.20s - 1695.36s] SPEAKER_01: Oh, you think Yannis will beat him? Yes. So the experience will win against the... Experience and he is with way more better technique, you know. Oh, you think Yannis is better in technique than Mindaugas? Of course, he is one of the smartest guys on the table, for me. Okay. Yeah. And what do you think about the goat, Mindaugas? He's strong, but...
[1695.55s - 1722.75s] SPEAKER_00: You don't like his style, technique at the table? No, I like Mindaugas, but in my opinion, he will lose this match. Wow, that's interesting. I'm pretty sure about that, believe me. Wow. Giannis is very, very dangerous and I think he will be very well prepared for this match.
[1723.07s - 1750.91s] SPEAKER_01: Because this is the top class and nobody will come unprepared. No, no, for sure, for sure. Because before, Mindaugas was getting ready for Danilo Ustinov, you know, from Kazakhstan. From Kazakhstan, I know. Yeah, yeah. And it was going to be 70 kilo match. But then there was some visa issues. And then, so...
[1751.71s - 1780.93s] SPEAKER_01: we switched the match so he didn't have to lose more weight and now they are gonna play 77 kilo and I asked to Yannis are you in good shape he said yes Engin I'm in very good shape and then he accepted so if Yannis accepted the match it means that he feels you know ready in good shape yeah yeah I agree and so let's go this one only percentage
[1781.10s - 1811.09s] SPEAKER_01: No, no deep analyzing. Georgi versus Dave? 60-40 for Georgi. 60-40, okay. Yes. Okay. And... Then let's go. Do you know Valen Low? No, I don't know him. Okay, then let me not ask. Do you know Cody Wood? No, both of them I don't know them. Okay, so...
[1812.56s - 1840.18s] SPEAKER_01: John Therrien vs. Craig Tuller Do you know those guys? Yes, of course. I think that Craig will win. You think Craig will win? He's pretty strong. With good experience on the table. Very good experience. He competed in the 1992 WUF. I know, I know. Yeah, think about it. I have seen him a long, long time ago.
[1840.81s - 1864.38s] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I had one final with Craig in 2000. I didn't know that. Yeah, in Virginia, we had the final match in 2000, America, Virginia Beach, yeah. And let's go, Sarah versus Jocelyn. Jocelyn is from Canada.
[1864.75s - 1893.09s] SPEAKER_01: You know her, yeah. She beat Sara last year and now Sara wants revenge. And today, before you, she was my guest and I asked her about her chances and she said 100%. I think Sara will win this and she'll be very well prepared. I'm sure about that. Okay. Okay. And interestingly, she was lighter. Normally she's around 85, 86 kilos. This time,
[1893.98s - 1922.94s] SPEAKER_01: This time she was 78 kilo, but she said that she didn't lose any power, any muscle, just maybe even some unnecessary weight. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Woman, they don't have fat. They have unnecessary weight. Unnecessary weight. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Anyway. So, um, let's, let's go more.
[1925.70s - 1953.36s] SPEAKER_01: Mat Mat vs Kedergale Ongarbayar Ongarbayar had a surgery last summer and this is his first match after the surgery while you know how good Mat was against Marseille in the last King of the Table in Atlantic City I think that Mat will beat him he will toproll him and
[1953.75s - 1983.67s] SPEAKER_00: Matt will beat Ongarebe? Yes. Wow. Because after surgery, first match, I don't know what will be the shape of Kydirgali, but I think Matt will beat him. He will be uncomfortable for... Ongarebe? Yes. Very long hand, very good top roll. You know what is the thing that I remember?
[1983.99s - 2013.37s] SPEAKER_01: Hermes and Ongarwe were pulling in Croatia and Hermes beat him and Hermes at that time was around like 100 kilos or something and Hermes beat Ongarwe right and left and later Hermes pulled against Matt at WL and Matt beat Hermes at that time Matt at this weight is very strong and very difficult
[2013.78s - 2043.51s] SPEAKER_00: He's so tall, he's explosive, and he's crazy on the table. He's one of my favorite pours. Oh, really? Yeah. He doesn't give a shit about anybody. You probably like those F-words, huh? To hear that. He's very, very, very powerful. Yeah, yeah. But Ongar Bey also got stronger since that time, you know. Yeah, yeah, I know, I know. But in my opinion, Matu will be a big problem for him.
[2045.70s - 2075.50s] SPEAKER_00: Okay, and Prudnik versus Cody Merritt? This is close match for me. Either it goes fast by Cody to the pin pad or... It will be not a fast match. It will be... Oh, really? I don't think, I don't see a game to cook him. Oh, really? Wow. So they will go like this?
[2075.91s - 2104.97s] SPEAKER_00: It will be a war, you will see, a close match. That's interesting. Cody is a very big guy and strong and he won a lot of world's left-handed. Yeah, then he lost a medal. Yeah, yeah, but... Yeah, yeah, at that time, yeah. And, Cody versus Devon.
[2106.55s - 2133.50s] SPEAKER_01: I think Devon will win. Do you expect an easy win or the early rounds? No, not easy, but he will win. The first one or two rounds it will be a war, but after that Devon is more... Can I ask you a question? When you pull against Devon in Dubai and some rounds you were right here, you know, and he was a little bit like... If you had
[2134.41s - 2162.07s] SPEAKER_01: very strong shoulder pressure. You think you could pin him? Yes. But this was not only the problem. His head was very wet and my grip was slipping all the way down. Okay, the question is, you told me that he put his sweat on his hand. All the time, all the time. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And okay, if this didn't happen, would you beat him?
[2164.03s - 2193.63s] SPEAKER_01: Not beating him, but one or two rounds I could take. Aha, ok. So the match would be more like 4-2? Yes, yes. Earlier rounds you are talking about? Yes. I understand. So, if Corey has very good shoulder pressure, do you think it's possible for him to have some rounds? No. Now Devon is way bigger and I think that Corey is not powerful in this
[2194.62s - 2217.05s] SPEAKER_01: in this position to pull without wrist? No, I said if he has it. Ah, if he has it, it will be a problem for Devon Bucks. Yeah, I remember, I remember, I mentioned this before, Corey and Paolo was training after a Monster Factory match and Corey
[2218.67s - 2237.82s] SPEAKER_01: went here and then Paolo was going out and then Corey pin him easily with the dead wrist and then I remember Paolo and Devon pulling and Paolo was able to I think one round press Devon that way so what I'm just saying that Corey has very good you know start
[2238.64s - 2267.42s] SPEAKER_01: if he can go all the way, not all the way, half way and then if Devon is just like open arm top roll like how he does with right arm he has more with left arm he has more offset I don't know how much he trained but if he goes here and then if Corey puts his whole body pressure you know body weight you know on it do you still think that he cannot have any rounds? maybe he can in this way he can take one round but
[2267.73s - 2295.18s] SPEAKER_00: Not three rounds you are saying? No, no, no, no way. Okay, I understand. Devon is very difficult to beat him. And now he's big, you see, he's growing up. Yeah, yeah, yeah. In fact, you know, two rounds Gennady was able to stop him. But Gennady didn't have any chance to
[2295.54s - 2321.57s] SPEAKER_01: beat him, but he really stopped him. Yes, I know, but Devon was not moving, he was controlling all the match. Yeah, yeah, but about to finish him, there was problem. Yeah, yeah, but Gennady is very strong there, but Devon beat him, you know. Yeah, yeah. And let's go to the Golds match.
[2324.04s - 2352.95s] SPEAKER_00: John Brzenk vs Yoshinobu Kanaya? This will be a crazy match for me. But I think John will take it. Really? Yes. Okay, now do some technical breakdown. He will stop him, toproll him and slowly, slowly, slowly climbing, climbing, climbing. I think this will... Yes.
[2353.84s - 2382.55s] SPEAKER_00: I don't think that Kanae has better hand control than Jon. No, for sure not better hand control, but do you think that he may take the match to his side with that Tornado? I think that Jon will do... He will topple him, I'm sure about that. And he will climb, climb, climb...
[2383.54s - 2409.12s] SPEAKER_01: In my opinion. I understand. He's going to climb up and then finish with me. Yes. Do you think it's possible for him to finish Kanayi without press? Yes, I think. Even without? Because Tad had all the problems to finish.
[2409.34s - 2436.65s] SPEAKER_01: And Todd, for a second, he even tried to do shoulder pressure and he was like, what am I doing, you know? Yeah, but for me, John has better hand control than Todd and I don't know. In my eyes... No, no, he has better, for sure, for sure better. Have you ever seen Kanae and John in the 2010s, their matches? Usually, John finishing him with the shoulder pressure.
[2436.83s - 2459.58s] SPEAKER_00: This is what I'm saying, that John knows him and he will do what is needed to beat him, you know? And what if it goes to the endurance game? I think... Again, John will beat him, in my opinion. John is the GOAT, you know? No, no, I know, I know for sure.
[2460.00s - 2489.80s] SPEAKER_01: John is not at his 40 or something. I know, but he will be prepared, believe me. He's in the United States and... So you are saying that it will have a different meaning. Yeah. Yeah. I understand. So when are we going to see you, number one? When I... Have we ever? This is my purpose.
[2490.29s - 2517.78s] SPEAKER_00: he's singing and slowly I'm becoming to transform myself in a monster and you see me and you are saying that you're gonna beat Dave 60% yes if that happens, if that happens who do you think that you should pull? I want to pull Gennady also oh Gennady? yes this is a dream match for me also Gennady he's one of the greatest in heavyweight class powerful, strong, fast
[2519.94s - 2544.39s] SPEAKER_01: How about if I set you with Michael, will you accept? Of course. Of course, yeah. Of course I will say yes. Probably only not to Devon. To Devon I will say again yes. Devon, I'm not afraid of these guys, you know. So you know that if you want to fulfill your dream,
[2544.71s - 2574.70s] SPEAKER_00: you need to beat these guys, soon or later you can't say that sooner or later, I mean you can't say that no, not this guy no, I can't say no, I have to say yes to all of them, you know ok, ok, but you just want to be ready and at the right time yes, yes, because you know, you need to prepare you play against the best in this sport and you need time to prepare to make a strategy, you know anyway, so
[2576.32s - 2599.54s] SPEAKER_01: Is there any match that you want to watch? Which match you want to like, just tell me Engin, these three matches other than you competing. Just Engin, set me these matches that I want to see. What are they? I want to see Stuyan to pull Paulins.
[2601.48s - 2631.28s] SPEAKER_00: Stojan Polin, wow. It's a good one. It's a good one, yeah. Of course, I'm pretty sure that Stojan will toproll him. To finish him, I'm not sure, but it will be a crazy match. Another match, I want to see Alijan against Vitaly. And who's winning that one? I think Alijan will beat him. Really? Yes. Which way?
[2632.24s - 2655.23s] SPEAKER_00: In hook, they will go in strap and Alejan will hook him. Wow, Morozov didn't even try that. Yeah, but Morozov is not such a hooker like Alejan. Different styles. And one more match. Listen, listen, when you say the different styles, like Morozov beat Kurdecha by, you know,
[2655.73s - 2682.23s] SPEAKER_01: Okay, another thing I want to ask, were you surprised when Dadikian beat Kurdecha? I was a little surprised because Kurdecha is way bigger but I knew that Dadikian is very dangerous and very strong. And how dangerous do you think Dadikian is if he is not injured? Because he was making 105 kilos, looks like he was losing almost 15 kilos and he was getting really like
[2682.40s - 2708.92s] SPEAKER_01: exhausted you know and now in 115 kilos I think he was 117 before he told me he was 122 or something and so how good is this guy do you know what he told me? he said that he would like to pull Laletin for the world's number one I think you beat him oh you think Dadikhan will beat Vitaly? listen if you start Vitaly he
[2709.77s - 2736.36s] SPEAKER_01: Vitaly has one harm and one fast goal. If you stop him... Georgi, Georgi. According to you, you beat Vitaly, Michael beat Vitaly, Ali Can beat Vitaly, and then, one second, Dade can beat Vitaly. You know, I soon will think that Vitaly is just... I mean, you saw Vitaly versus...
[2736.70s - 2763.57s] SPEAKER_00: This is I don't know, Vitaly vs. Reiter, Morozov. Yeah, yeah. I mean, you are thinking that once somebody stops him, you are saying he's over. Believe me, again, a match between Michael and Vitaly, it will be a nightmare for Vitaly. Also, Devon, make the match, you will see what will happen. It will be an impossible match for Vitaly. So, okay. Okay.
[2764.02s - 2792.71s] SPEAKER_01: Do you think that if Michael beats Vitaly, do you think I should still set Vitaly with Devon? Of course, it will be a good match. No, I understand, but if he is losing against someone who is ranked lower than Devon... Maybe at some point we should, but I think that if he loses against Michael, then we need to see him against some other guys. Yeah, yeah.
[2793.18s - 2818.14s] SPEAKER_00: In this way of thoughts, yes, you are right, yeah. Okay, how about Vitaly versus Kurdesha? Right hand. Right and left. Left, Vitaly will beat him. And right? I'm not sure. Wow. Vitaly is way stronger on the left arm. The right arm, he is not so strong, in my opinion. Wow.
[2818.54s - 2846.66s] SPEAKER_01: I'm gonna make sure Vitaly will watch everything you say. I'm gonna make a clip. I'm gonna make a clip. Like, oh, Michael will beat Lalehjin. Devon will destroy him. Ali Can will beat him. And this will beat him. And I will make a clip. Make sure that Vitaly will watch that. He will be very angry at me. That's good. That's good. That's a future super match, you know.
[2847.10s - 2870.42s] SPEAKER_01: He said that I don't like Vitaly No, no, no, I know Vitaly is a very good guy I mean that this will be a very difficult, tough opponent for him You are saying that Vitaly is a very good guy, but he is just weak, you are saying I am joking, joking I don't know about that, I don't know about that, he says that
[2870.76s - 2900.64s] SPEAKER_00: both Michael and Devon matches will be only a warm-up for him training before level match he says I'm not sure yeah and Michael is big you saw what match they did with Hermes yeah it was very close match Hermes to lose if the match was 1-2 minutes longer I don't see Hermes to beat him Hermes was starting to lose his wrist barely to
[2901.18s - 2925.46s] SPEAKER_01: It was very close match. Yes, yes, yes, yes, it was, yeah. Yeah. We will see, we will see. Anyway, so we are here for almost 50 minutes, and this was a solo one, only you and I. Thank you very, very much, Georgi. This is great to see you. Thank you for inviting me to make this nice podcast to talk. What's that?
[2926.09s - 2951.42s] SPEAKER_01: Thank you for this podcast to talk about our beloved sport. Yeah, yeah. And it is easy to talk with you because you know that we both have good intention. And then I just talk as I like. I know that he wouldn't get offended, you know? Yeah, of course. Yeah. And, and yeah, anything else you want to say to your fans or anyone or to Vitaly, you know,
[2953.14s - 2983.13s] SPEAKER_00: I want to say big thanks to my all fans, big thanks for their support and I want to say Vitaly that one day I will beat him and I will beat him. Right hand. Anyways, thank you very much again and thanks to everyone who has watched us and take care of yourself, stay healthy and good luck.
