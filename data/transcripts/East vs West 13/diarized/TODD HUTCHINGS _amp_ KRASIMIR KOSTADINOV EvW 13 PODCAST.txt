Todd Hutchings: Hello guys.
Engin Terzi: sharing the links and then i'll be with you guys travis beijing just made the comment he very seldom he makes comments
Todd Hutchings: Let's see what he wrote. He probably wrote something about Artem Taranenko. Yes. Artem Taranenko and Tom's poster he wrote. Easy work. Probably he's saying easy work for his teammates. Most likely. Let me share the link on Instagram as well.
Todd Hutchings: Put the link here. And we can start right here. Somebody came. Todd Hutchings came.
Engin Terzi: let's see what international cook committee what was it international cook committee what was it what was it international hook committee what was it the international federation of inside pullers oh inside yeah yeah inside international federation or the inside pool and who is the present you
Todd Hutchings: No, I'm just the viceroy. I'm just like the president changes every once in a while. You are what? President? What? I am viceroy. I'm like a lieutenant. It means that you are controlling the president? I report to him. Okay. Okay. And how does...
Engin Terzi: How does this president get to be elected? Is there a democracy? Yeah, it's mob rule. So most votes wins. Okay, okay. I kind of feel that you are the one that, you know, doing the president. Yeah, this is how I see it. Because whenever I see your arm wrestling group, looks like you are the one, you know, who's dominating there, you know.
Engin Terzi: Yeah. It is. Those guys, they don't know. They don't know. They say, no speak English. Yeah. Let's see. We are waiting. Oh, yeah. You are eight minutes early. I'm like 10, 11 minutes early. Now Krasimir will come and let's talk about your videos. Your videos. They were very confusing, you know.
Engin Terzi: the last one was again about the international federation of inside pullers and before that you were getting a land to do farm but not a real big one yeah my video my videos are uh made for the american audience yeah okay so i i shouldn't watch it well you can watch it but like when i go to turkey i don't understand the tv i'm watching so i know i i can speak some english but
Engin Terzi: i don't think it's just like i understand yeah i understand and what was it they were we were gonna give you a land for the farm and and yeah yeah let's see how is the farm that's good what's the weight uh 220 224 i'm well under 230. okay so you are maximum 102 kilos yeah yeah
Engin Terzi: Okay, that's good. That's good. And you're gonna beat this Bulgarian guy? I'd like my chances. You like your chances. And let's start while Krasimir is not here. Let's start from your last experience with Dadikyan. Where
Engin Terzi: Like if you had chance, could you go back and then change something and then the outcome would be you think different? David you learn something that you were not expecting during the? Yeah, I think I could have improved because I could a couple of times I got him over and he hit me back and I should have had I been expecting that.
Todd Hutchings: he hit back i probably should have just hit maximum back pressure and really you know jumped into his hand um it might have slowed that hit down or it might have gotten me into the straps so um i wouldn't have tried hitting high on the first match anymore i think i would just uh really crowd the center of the table the question is did you try to go to strap first round
Todd Hutchings: first round okay because it you didn't seem to because probably his hand was so strong yeah and uh it's it was it's harder he he comes he's so much in the center of the table it was hard to get on it's usually easier to get into the strap so somebody who's setting his load back or heading outside yeah um
Todd Hutchings: I think it would be really hard to get into the straps with Crossey, unless you're just blindingly fast. I mean, some people do get into the straps, but, uh, usually, you know, he holds on. Um, but I did try the first round and.
Todd Hutchings: think i went off the pad again but his uh his hit was really really impressive but the amount of force there wasn't you know wasn't um anything i couldn't have dealt with the force level was manageable but you know the hit just came out of nowhere i just really wasn't expecting i was expecting
Engin Terzi: slower increase i was expecting slower matches not not that wild um impactful one but you know you learn you know every one of these things yeah yeah yeah yeah you're a smart guy i'm sure that you are trying to understand everything you are not a type of guy that is moving with the instincts alone you know you like to analyze understand and and even though devon thinks that you have the worst technique
Engin Terzi: I think that you or your technique is very smart, just not orthodox. You know, I'm not talking about the inside, but the other one, that the way that you pull against John, the way that you pull against Ongarbe, it is very smart, just not the way that we get used to, but the way that you are using your pronator, side pressure, everything is calculated. I can see that. When to put to...
Engin Terzi: the table the leg to the corner of the table and yeah yeah when you say like like he didn't uh his what did you say force when you say his force wasn't something that uh you couldn't uh handle like is it something that we call force power like yeah well there's um
Todd Hutchings: There's like the level that you can push. Say, you know, 100 pounds is more than 50. But there's a difference between going from zero to 50 in one second and zero to 104 seconds. You're talking about...
Engin Terzi: zero to 60 and the horsepower difference you know correct like some some cars are just going zero to 60 so fast but then it doesn't super yeah and yeah yeah okay so you are saying that your horsepower was like very near but his explosiveness was yeah so the force when you say force i will understand explosiveness oh no no horsepower yeah force would force is just the amount of
Engin Terzi: like 100 pounds yeah yeah but the explosiveness would be power power you're talking about explosiveness as the you're reaching your max power fast yeah speed speed of the reaching yeah okay yeah power power is force distance divided by time you know where force is just force 100 pounds it doesn't have anything to do with speed yeah yeah but speed speed can be very
Engin Terzi: deadly you know it can be very deadly yeah because because if you don't have the same explosiveness then you will be caught just say at your 70 percent while he applies 100 so your 70 percent is 100 if you cannot activate everything you know and also you need to activate all those muscle groups at the same time because you may activate something but you may fail from somewhere else yeah yep
Engin Terzi: Yeah. And how are your... I don't know if I should say gym lifts. I don't know where you are training. Every time I see you training, you're outside in the garden somewhere, you know? Those aren't core workouts. Yeah, I'm in the gym. I'm still adding about two and a half pounds on max effort day.
Todd Hutchings: each, you know, in between matches, always switch with the core lifts are I don't, you know, I got the same strategy, but the tactics change for every match, like I'm training for Krazy different exercises that I did for Agrabah, because they pull differently. But there's still speed day, max day, volume day, work day, that sort of stuff. Yeah, so you said that every training, you're adding like 20 pounds?
Todd Hutchings: Max every day. I'm pushing PRs up by about two and a half pounds a week. Oh, okay. But two and a half pounds, like you're talking about probably one type of training because like two and a half pounds can be just say 3% in some exercise. It's two and a half pounds out of roughly 100 to 120. So it's about 2%, a little less than 2%. Yeah, everything on the pulley machine is in the...
Todd Hutchings: 90 to 130 pound range and if i can beat it by two and a half which is the smallest plate i've got well i actually have a railroad spike which weighs one and a quarter pounds so sometimes if i can't increase it i put that little weight on there and do it hello hello krasimir hey guys good to see you my friend good to see you yeah this guy was talking about like he's saying how he will destroy you how he will
Engin Terzi: just break your arm and things like that you know so good that you came that i don't have to you know listen all those so how is everything crossing it always good always good preparation is going good so far and how many times have you guys met one was super match and after that did you guys meet also in moldova or not
Engin Terzi: Yes, he beat me in Russia at A1 after that. Oh, A1. Okay. But I was very tired after two long matches there. Artem you talking about the time that you met Anatoly? Anatoly and after that with Tokarev. Oh, Tokarev. And you had a long war with them. Okay, I understand. So you are saying that the only match that should be considered is the one that you guys had supermatched?
Engin Terzi: It was 2012? No, the match in Moldova, we were both fresh. It was also... Oh, you also played in Moldova. Yeah, okay. Yes, yes. Okay. Yeah, okay. And you always tell me that when you are 95 kilos, you don't lose much from your left arm because this is more technical, the hand control pronator, while you lose more when you do with right arm because of the horsepower. But now there is 105 kilo limit. What is your weight right now?
Engin Terzi: one hundred two three kilos okay same he just said that he is 102 kilo 224. yeah and are you gonna beat this guy we'll see i cannot say for sure that i will beat him but i am giving my best on the training since let's see how does it look right now we are 30 days away when i am asking that question thad is doing like this are you gonna beat him crash even if that was the
Engin Terzi: He wants that land in Bulgaria. He's going to make a farm there. Yes, yes. We want many things, but we don't get everything. Okay, so you are saying to this man to not to dream so much. Well, he may dream as much as he wants, but what will happen, we'll see. Okay, okay. How is your form right now? It should be very good, but next month we will understand for sure.
Krasimir Kostadinov: okay the plans are like the things are going according to the plan yes actually my form is good i hope i hope i bring my best shape there but the thing is that i don't know how strong is he so let's see i understand i understand well okay so talk
Engin Terzi: you like your chances like do you like your chances better than the your chances against just say like that again like i'm talking about before the match before the match what you were thinking dadakin wasn't unknown to me so i was i was and there wasn't a lot of uh video of him pulling most of most dadakin video was
Todd Hutchings: either left hand or him in training and a lot of, a lot of him training with Vovoda and some playing golf. So, you know, I just didn't know what to deal with. And the first it took, yeah, I, I, the first two matches with that again, I wasn't exactly sure, you know, what it was happening, but there's a lot more video of data can out there now. So it would be easier for me to prepare. And, uh,
Todd Hutchings: and i got a better understanding of what his uh strength level is so but krazy there's there's hours of video of him out there man i got a youtube playlist that i started and i'm not even halfway through it before my workout's done my workout's only like an hour long and i got oh okay
Engin Terzi: That run is not unknown even by video. And you also pull him probably like 10 times, you know, six times in Supermatch and then probably two times in Russia.
Engin Terzi: no and the super match it was four zero and we stopped the match and after that in russia and after it moved over so it's so russia was one match or like best of three like two months one one one match okay so you you yeah you guys pull six times so he has like analyzed you through the videos also he has his own experience do you remember the the feeling you had uh when you
Todd Hutchings: pull him or you are just now like more focused on what you see on videos or what by what you feel as well like what you felt as well yeah well we're both we're both bigger now so it would be different and uh back in 2012 prazi was a very young man he's old now i mean he should probably be thinking about retiring not keep arm wrestling he's like 12 years older now so
Engin Terzi: You know, most of my, most of my Krazy videos are Krazy with hair. There's only a few bald Krazy videos out there, so. So, so do you remember the way that you felt him? Like, do you think that like anything has changed since that time, the way that he is pulling? Because you felt something. I don't think it's changed too much. When we pulled the first time,
Todd Hutchings: We basically pull the same. We're very comfortable. We hit about the same layer. Forms are about the same. I'm just more curious about to see how fast he still is and just what exactly how much force he generates. And in your opinion, are you stronger than 12 years ago? I assume we all are.
Todd Hutchings: I mean, I certainly wouldn't have trained for 12 years and gotten weaker. That would be a bad program. Yes, sometimes, sometimes like injuries, sometimes the age, sometimes, you know, I'm not stronger for sure, like from 12 years ago, but I'm not really training either, you know, but. Yeah. My hand's significantly better than it was 12 years ago. My arms and shoulders are probably close, you know, but my outside pulleys,
Engin Terzi: way improved from where i was 12 years ago yeah yeah no doubt about this and yeah and and crossing me uh are you planning to stop me i'll do whatever it takes but not at first round one you know exactly what's happening um stop rolling grass limit
Krasimir Kostadinov: Especially in Serbia, it wouldn't be a good idea early rounds. I don't know if he gets exhausted. I don't know. Krasimir, do you think you should be retiring? When he said that, there is something in my head that he is 58 right now. And if I want to beat that guy, I better do it now because I'm not sure there will be another time. So,
Todd Hutchings: If I really want to have a win on that guy, I really need to do it now. Engen, just go ahead and set us up a match 12 years from now. I'll still be 102 kilograms. Okay, when did you say that? Go ahead and set us up another match in 12 years. So 2036. Oh, you'll be 70. Okay. I'll just be hitting my prime. How do you see your chances then? I still like my chances.
Engin Terzi: you should never mention he's 58 now he says that he would beat you when he's 70. i i i i couldn't handle that i couldn't handle so you you better win yes yes this is in my head anyways even if i say this or not i'm really thinking is that
Krasimir Kostadinov: If I really want to have a win on Todd, this is the time to do it. Yeah, I agree. I agree. Yeah. And Todd, how do you see... Wait, wait, wait. Okay. You asked him about if he remembers how we pulled, if he remembers the feeling that we pulled, or it's just based on the videos, but you didn't ask me.
Engin Terzi: oh okay because he's the one that like who has been the one the one with not so good memory or what no no he's talking about he's talking about like he's analyzing your videos so that I didn't prepare any question I I just thought that you know he had pulled you in three different events and then he was focused on
Engin Terzi: like analyzing you from the videos. So I was like, you also pull him, like which one you value more? The one that you are watching on YouTube, Krasimir versus other people? Or do you remember how you felt? So that's why I ask. Okay, then I ask you the same thing. I remember very well all the times we pulled. In Russia, actually, I was too tired and I just hit the wall there and I couldn't do anything to him.
Krasimir Kostadinov: But I remember the feeling when we faced in Bulgaria. I remember the first round when I pulled here, that there I could trouble him. But after that, after the foul they gave the first round, I went more deeply and there... You think, you think, you think, one second, you think you made a mistake after the foul or is it because you get exhausted already?
Krasimir Kostadinov: after the fall i did something different i don't know if i did the same thing as the first as before the fall if i don't know how the things would go but just i pulled different after that is it something you remember or now you look at the video and you analyze no i remember it like you remember
Krasimir Kostadinov: Okay, okay, okay. Yes. Yeah, I asked you, I shouldn't ask you, you are not the 158, I'm sure you remember very well. I'm just joking, joking. And when I compare myself with Krasimir 12 years ago, for sure my side pressure, I'm not sure if it's better or it's the same, or maybe even weaker, I'm not sure about the side pressure.
Krasimir Kostadinov: But I believe that my pronation and biceps are better now. This will make, I hope, the match look better for me now. But I just don't know how strong he is now, actually. How about Andrus? I don't know, actually. I don't know if we're stuck in the middle in a good enough position for both of us, how things will go. I don't know. Just when we pulled 2012,
Krasimir Kostadinov: Just his style of pulling was very uncomfortable for me. And I was in very bad position. I was not using my pronator back then. And it was just a matter of time that he beat me. Right now, if we stop in the middle, I don't know whose endurance is better. I just want to say something more. Okay. When I pulled him 2018 in Moldova, I pulled firstly him. And after that, I pulled Sasho.
Krasimir Kostadinov: And with both of them, I hit very fast after the goal. And I brought Toth near to the pin pad. That made me feel that his center game was not that solid as Sasho's because his wrist is not that solid. But once he stopped me, his hit to the side was way stronger than Sasho's hit to the side.
Engin Terzi: This is the thing that I wanted to mention and I don't know right now how strong he is. And that's why I don't know what to think. I don't know how the chances are right now. Okay, Krasimir, you say that you don't know how strong he is, but like, do you know anything else? Like, do you know where his strength points, his abilities, everything, you know that? But the only thing you don't know is how strong he is. Is that correct?
Krasimir Kostadinov: Yes, and I don't know how strong his wrist is as well. Okay, because you never... One more question in my head. I don't know which one is weaker, his hand or his pronator. So I'm not sure if I should hit more backwards or more sideways. Forget about these three tries, so you might as well try each. You know, Dadikyan couldn't really top roll him.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, that's true. Yeah. And with your right arm, I don't know how good you top roll. I don't know. Maybe I'm wrong. You said that you are good against the hook pullers, right? Yes. Not against because of your... Yeah, but when you look at the videos, who did the Dadikyan top roll before? I mean, hook puller. Who did he top roll? He's not...
Engin Terzi: used to be a top roller he used to be hook puller yeah yeah but i mean yeah his wrist his wrist is super solid yeah very strong yeah yeah but who who who did you top roll a good hook puller a great footballer i don't even remember you toppled someone with right arm uh actually on the competitions i almost never
Krasimir Kostadinov: top roll with my right because there are just a few people that go inside with me. Most of them just try to top rolls me. I top rolled Mehdi Abdul Vant when we pulled in Zagreb. Mehdi Abdul Vant. Because when I pulled with him inside, we were pretty close, but I top rolled him very easy.
Krasimir Kostadinov: Yeah, I don't think that his ability to get in there. Yes, his wrist is not that solid. Yes, exactly. But on the trainings when I pull with Sasho and your Dan Konev, when they go inside, I feel pretty comfortable to top wrong.
Engin Terzi: But I don't know how it will be with TOT. Before I forget, I will ask you one more question and I will go to Tal. Yesterday, did you do table training with Jordan Soner? Yes, yes. How did you feel?
Engin Terzi: better than you expected but no i don't want to you to tell me i don't want to start any travel between your friends or something but like how did you do were you were you satisfied because i know right now he's much bigger compared what's his weight right now under 10 114 14 so it is more than 10 kilo heavier than you it is not the same jordan that we know from 100 kilo yes i can tell you with with left we were pretty close
Engin Terzi: With left-foot bridge calls, we tried. I was the better guy two days ago. If you were better than 114 kilos, Jordan, I think Jordan was 100 kilos when he pulled that. And he's 114 now. And if you are better than that, then it means that this man who wants to field and farm in Bulgaria is in trouble.
Todd Hutchings: Is it true? Todd, are you in trouble? No, no, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm good. Okay. I've pulled bigger than 114 pound guys. Oh, okay. Oh, okay. Kordechka, Kordechka was a posting top roller bigger than that. Right. And Krazy did very, very well against that. That's the match I'd be more impressed with, not another chubby hooker. Okay. I understand. And you have been taking notes. So,
Engin Terzi: okay krasimir is gone uh you have been taking notes so can you would you like to share with us or those are oh personal i just wrote down i didn't have the uh the match from uh moldova down i remember pulling sasho there but i'd forget i mean yeah and he mentioned it i do remember oh okay now you will i'm gonna go grab that video okay yeah i'm gonna add that video to the playlist so the customer says that he knows about you
Engin Terzi: and but doesn't know how strong you are right now uh can you say the same thing about krasimir you know everything about him but you don't know how strong he is or you can even guess how strong he is um with krasimir i have i mean i respect his strength because there's a lot of video out there but if he's
Todd Hutchings: significantly faster than the other person his odds of winning go up a lot if the other person's kind of the same speed um his odds of winning drop down and it's not always just flash pins um uh the lachlan match was my best example of that when krazy was way faster than lachlan yeah okay you are you are thinking that uh lachlan was stronger than krasimir but krasimir was faster that's how he won
Todd Hutchings: I think Lachlan was in the neighborhood of the same strength.
Todd Hutchings: Krazy was consistently faster and just way more experienced. I mean, Lachlan made a lot of mistakes in the middle of his matches, but when Lachlan really, really hit, the match got interesting. When Krazy out-hit Lachlan, it was just one-sided. So you are basically saying that you beat Lachlan without problem, and Lachlan is the same level Krasimir, and you're going to kill Krasimir. I top-rolled Lachlan. I'm not top-rolling Krazy.
Krasimir Kostadinov: no you beat him inside as well well i didn't hit we ended up there but my my head was going up high and outside yeah but when you pin him you guys were basically yeah sorry guys my my telephone was overheated that's why i turned it out now is it okay i think so but i just turned it on my computer just in case so if it's overheated again i will turn on my computer
Krasimir Kostadinov: okay okay so what you are saying about when i if i'm better than you've done he said he said that you and lachlan were close power but you were faster and he made mistake that is how you beat him and he said that he beat lachlan and he he will kill you is what he said let me tell you when i put lachlan we were really very close we were super close that day
Krasimir Kostadinov: um i don't think that he made mistakes you just hear your experience yes yes i don't think there was much much more things he can he could try i could try some other things as well while you top rolled him i've got video of you top rolling one person yeah yeah you you said that he toppled himself
Engin Terzi: But what, what, what, what did the, what did the international Federation or inside puller decide about it? Was it a top role or. It was a top role, but since Lachlan top rolled himself, we're not going to hold it against Crossey and he's still going to get his lifetime achievement award. Okay. Um, and about the local match, actually, I didn't actually try it to, to top roll him.
Krasimir Kostadinov: really committed going outside i didn't try that i was just uh i was just trying to hold back pressure to hold the pressure on his wrist and just go to the side yeah you just protected your pronator and then you drag him to your you catch him yeah that's what i said i never i never tried to really talk to him out with the straps with the straps
Krasimir Kostadinov: but i i want to say something that right now when i saw him lose against pauline so badly that really made me feel strange i i'm not sure if you think that he may be in like a washer shape or you think he was the same shape or i i think paul was incredible it's very strange for me to see that because
Engin Terzi: i don't know if he lost some power because of the weight loss because when we put he was 112 he's now 105. i don't know if this is any different he was like like one or two or something whenever i saw on the screen it was like 102 or 103 or something really yeah this is what i remember on the live whenever i saw the weights i think he was like one or two point something if i'm not mistaken he looked a lot thinner
Krasimir Kostadinov: his face his snake so he was probably 10 kilo 10 kilo lighter than the time that you know i don't know i really i was expecting the match to stop somewhere here i expected him to stop falling near to the pin pad and to have a long hook match i really didn't expect so did i that's exactly what i expected i thought that paul would hit him and open him like this and then there
Engin Terzi: either he would pin him or Lachlan would bring back, but he just hold him, hold him, hold him, and still won. It was interesting. Benji, it is not Federation of Inside Blues. It is International Federation of Inside Blues. Sorry. Okay, Todd, any comments? On the Paul Lachlan match, I also was impressed. I expected Paul to win the first two.
Todd Hutchings: i thought matches three through five are going to be more interesting because paul has a habit of guessing out after two tough matches um but yeah i mean paul lynn ran a class he ran a hook class in that match that was impressive that was not what i was expecting i think in one of the rounds he tried to top roll him but he couldn't in this trap yeah he still he still was able to beat him
Todd Hutchings: I'm curious, how are the practice table goals between Toth and Paulin? How do you feel him? I haven't pulled him in a long time. I pulled him prior to the Dadakin match, so I haven't pulled this version of him. But I pulled him when he was preparing for...
Todd Hutchings: I think it was before he came to Ohio, him and Kenny Smith came to Ohio. I think it was before Paul and Sasho match. Yes, yes. Yes, I remember that. Yes. And he was a lot stronger than I remember from the WAL days. But but he's gotten a lot better since then. I mean, Paul, I mean, Paul's made it since the Sasho match. I think Paul is significantly better than he was when he pulled Sasho.
Todd Hutchings: I don't know if he's stronger or if his forms just better or if he's just where I don't. I mean, I can't attribute it, but I was. I could have saw the Paul in Lachlan match going 3-2 either way. It is because of your category from the last seven. I would like to talk. What did you guys think about Petro versus Ungar? We have Nash. I haven't seen it, but if Oleg beat. Beat him the way it sounds.
Todd Hutchings: I like Oleg. Why you don't buy paper when watching sports? Because I'm only watching Krazy videos right now. But you heard about it, how it went? I've had several people told me that Oleg just hooked him in and beat him.
Krasimir Kostadinov: it was just what did you think classic you were surprised uh i was expecting such dominance in one two rounds maybe three but i was expecting at some point he did gali to stop him and to to have a nice match there but just the the overpower was too much yeah by the way this is east versus west 13 t-shirts
Engin Terzi: Yeah, I'm wearing one in the picture. Yeah, yeah, you guys before I did. Yeah, you're right. And yeah. And now, normally, as you know, Marharint was going to pull against Dadikyan. A lot of people told me like Marharint just won one match because of credit from the past, you know.
Engin Terzi: and so i talked with marharin i talked with darika and i talked with petrenko everyone and then we decided that petrenko is the one that deserve that the title match and marharin also said that he needs a little bit longer time and like he wouldn't want to waste that opportunity while he is not like 100 ready you know he's just making a comeback but do you guys how do you guys see petrenko versus uh
Krasimir Kostadinov: that he can match in the same event that you guys have with your category, your weight category, your ranking. I like Oleg for that match. I think Oleg can win it. I don't really know what to expect from that match actually. But in my eyes, maybe Oleg is a little bit favored as well.
Krasimir Kostadinov: Do you think Oleg is stronger? Where do you think the match would go? Inside? I believe if Dadikyan tries to toproll him, Petro may stop him here and take his wrist. Take his wrist? Dadikyan's wrist? Wow.
Engin Terzi: Yes, yes, yes. Yeah, because Irakli couldn't do that. Yeah, but Irakli is more back pressure based guy. So you are saying he's more like pronation and side pressure, Petro? Petro is much more side pressure guy than Irakli. So the match may stop somewhere here and turn him back. So you are saying that Dadikyan will probably be more explosive, but Petro will be stronger?
Engin Terzi: I think so. I think so. And Todd, how do you see that? How did you think that, like, Dedekind's endurance? It looked very good against you. Yeah, I mean, Dedekind's endurance is world level. His explosiveness is really, I definitely think his explosiveness is his best. Yeah, but you catch him and you bring him here and he still was able to get it back, yeah.
Engin Terzi: And how do you see this match? I think Oleg's got, I think Oleg's the favorite. Oleg is the favorite. So you both are thinking that Oleg will be the new champion? Yeah. Yes. Yeah. Wow. That's interesting. So after Ongar, where Todd get it and then only
Engin Terzi: one one match he had the title and then that again and now Todd is saying that he's gonna lose that one and so okay then then who could beat petrenko how do you see your chances against petrenko
Todd Hutchings: I like my chances. I don't actually, I've only seen him pull the one time, but I'd have to go back and look at him, but yeah, I, I, I like my chances. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And, and, and who do you think that you would be underdog in that category, you know, against, against who you would be underdog? Ever prepared Prudnik maybe or? Prudnik. Yeah. Prudnik for sure. Um,
Todd Hutchings: Yeah, Krasimir. Yeah, Krasimir is like way, way above me. Yeah, I'm trying to think of who else is in that category. Until Angerbaev lost to Oleg, I would have put Angerbaev up there because I have trouble with top rollers. But Prudnik for sure. So you are saying that basically only Prudnik would be the biggest problem?
Todd Hutchings: Yeah, well, I'd put myself as the underdog against Datikin too, you know. I think I'm a lot closer to Datikin than Prudnik, but I'd definitely be the underdog against anybody who's beat me recently. But you don't believe that Datikin would beat you again? Is what I understood. I don't think so. I mean, I like my chances with Datikin. Okay, that's good, you know, Todd. That's good that in your mind, you know, you...
Engin Terzi: you don't lose you know that's very important not not many people can do that when they lose once and this is only the people only the people who learn and then can do something different that can have that kind of hope what were you saying classic story about it uh he likes his chances now against the decan does he like his chances against rustam babaev
Engin Terzi: Man, he's got voodoo. I don't know what he does, man. He's doing something that's just flat not fair. I'm counting on other people to beat Babayev and keep me and Babayev separated on the rankings list. Yeah, but Todd, after you improve your pronators, do you think that, like you lost against Hajim Razzolev, like, do you think that if you would go to 2021,
Todd Hutchings: june 12th i remember the day it was the first east versus west like do you think you would lose again just tell me honestly i know what i would do differently but i'm not going to claim that i could beat somebody who i've never ever been yes yes yes yes but in your head you you think that you could do something different i know idea i i know how i would approach that i would i would like have just the bye-bye of strategy it would be just for that man
Engin Terzi: yeah yeah but at that time did you have that ability or you improve yourself after that match i know i did i didn't have it um yeah last time with bold yes yes i agree you didn't seem to do like to be able to do it that day i think he would beat you but after that after that with your pronation
Todd Hutchings: I think you could sleep and go to sleep after that one. Yeah, towards the end of the WAL. And once I got into the higher levels of East versus West, I was spending a lot of time with my palm up. That was a consistent way I was losing was being palm up. So I definitely had to fix that. Yeah. And so let's go like some of the matches. One last thing. Go ahead.
Krasimir Kostadinov: under 100 kilos todd hutchins beat all the guys except those time right in who yeah but yeah yeah and i beat all the guys except for her tunes yeah but when you say you beat all the guys except hutchings some of those guys also beat you who
Krasimir Kostadinov: Like Rostam has win against you, Sasho has win against you, Irakli has win against you. I mean, hook for hook. Irakli is not in the list. Oh, you're talking about hook? Oh, okay. Yes. Yes, Sasho has one win against me, but I have more wins on him. Oh, so you beat Sasho more than Sasho beat you? Sasho beat me just once. I beat him many times. Oh, really? Wow. I didn't know. I thought you guys were close.
Krasimir Kostadinov: No. I mean, we were close every time. We had worse, but I won. So does it include left arm as well or right? With left, he never beat me. Oh, with left, he never beat you. Wow. I didn't know that you were that dominant against him. That's interesting. We didn't pull so many times, but we pulled three, four, five times, and he has one win with the right. Okay. Okay.
Krasimir Kostadinov: And with Babaev, Babaev beat me 2011, I beat him 2016. Yeah. With Haji Murad, I didn't pull fresh for fresh, but I kept one win on him as well. So the only guy that I missed winning... What was Haji Murad's weight when you beat him? He was 95. Where was it? When was it?
Krasimir Kostadinov: Zloty too, but he was tired when we pulled. It was in the open class 2012. I got second after Pushkar, he got third in the open. He was 95 or 86? He was 95, Prudnik won 86 that year. And Hajim Razole won 95? I think so, it was that year, yes. Again, so do you remember which year was it? I don't remember exactly, like
Engin Terzi: I don't know here the final, but after that, Prudnik beat him in the Open class, if I'm not mistaken. Let's talk about the matches from the East vs. West. Do you know Tom? Tom who? Tom Rozes from Latvia. He pulled a supermatch against Justin Bischoff. Oh, he's the one pulling Artem?
Engin Terzi: Yeah, yeah, with the hat. I vote for Artem. You vote for Artem, left arm, yeah? Yeah. Is it because you like Artem, or is it because Team West, or is it because you think he's going to beat him?
Todd Hutchings: Well, I do like Artem. Artem's got this unique ability to do like what data can do. He can do a full power hit from these really weird positions. People can put Artem in a losing position. Yeah. And it's hard to deal with that. And if you've never pulled that before, it's hard to adapt to it at the time. So that's a very big advantage for Artem. How much do you know his opponents?
Engin Terzi: Not at all. If I tell you that the Europeans won a match, he beat Oleg Zok with left arm, do you think that it could be close? Well, if I knew that, I probably would have picked him to beat Artem. But I'll tell you what, the guy is still, as you said, unorthodox style. You just think that Artem is losing or something, and then the way that he's just, I don't know how he generates that power.
Krasimir Kostadinov: and then as you said you know it doesn't matter you know how good you are if you are not used to it may be trouble for you yeah yeah yeah the guys i don't know what i don't know what he did to keep those elbows together but his elbows are bulletproof and you classy i'm sure that tommy was to control the center because his wrist and fingers are just iron but i'm not sure he'll be able to finish the match
Engin Terzi: Oh, so you think that Artem may win the match? Yes, but I cannot say. I see a very interesting one. Okay, so that's good that you both think that it is a very good match because after Tom's performance at the Europeans with right arm, he had a dominant gold medal and the left arm he beat Zog once and then still troubled him a little bit in the final.
Engin Terzi: So people were thinking that, you know, Tom would dominate Artem. But I'm telling you, the way that he is pulling, he could surprise many people. And I don't think he's coming to Istanbul to lose, but time will show. And then let's go to some other matches quickly. Sorry, sorry. After one hour, I remember that actually Toc didn't answer the question. David he remember the way we pulled?
Todd Hutchings: David he remember the feeling or he just watched the videos now? I think he said both, no? Yeah, well, I might not have remembered it, but now I watch that video every morning when I'm working out. So I can recollect back what it was like. And I remember it was, I had to hit super early. If I was a little off go, I got dragged out of position. But if I was quick enough, we stopped.
Engin Terzi: Like where we were both, I thought we were both comfortable. Like I said, it feels like I was just pulling myself because we both have this kind of, we lean in and our arms are kind of open hook, you know? Yeah. Yeah. Well, you know what? Just people, especially the young people, needs to learn lessons from what he said. Every morning when I get up, I watch this match. He is preparing a super match and he has been pulling forward
Engin Terzi: 25 years almost and you see the discipline no i'm very serious you know that how he analyzes and how he watches it just shows how much he respects for what he's doing and that that is that is great i think that people should take arm wrestling that serious you know instead of how old were you when you started arm wrestling 35 probably 35 but until that point you were pulling from time to time
Todd Hutchings: maybe my dad and i probably arm wrestled 10 times before i was 35 years old wow and i thought it would be someone that he made in everyone and not at a table i mean this was like on the floor or on cars or something i'd the very first arm wrestling table i ever saw i was 35 years old that's interesting i was thinking that you are one of those people
Engin Terzi: that in their entire life, everywhere they go, they beat the people, the best guy, and then pull a lot, but never met the real arm wrestling. So that is very interesting and very surprising. But when you pulled John Brzenk in that final 95 kilos, how many years you were training until that point? Four or five. Four or five, okay. 90 kilos, Vegas 90 kilos, yeah. Yeah, okay. That's very interesting. People are lucky that you didn't start as a teenager.
Engin Terzi: um so carolina peterson olga terpelova probably carolina you don't need to know the opponent who that person i know you're going to ask me so i looked at a lot of these before i got here do you see the discipline many people would come oh i don't know pass it but he studied you go across him do you know terpelova because i had the list on my phone i understand but when you say that you analyzed you did you go check who she is
Krasimir Kostadinov: No, I took my words back. Yeah, I went down and checked out who I was voting for. Okay. You know, there are some people that are just reading and reading and reading, but it's just pure knowledge. If you don't know how to use that knowledge, it's just... Yeah, you're right. Anyone who has never experienced to be there,
Engin Terzi: Like they, they will just, I remember one of those, the football teams, uh, like fan was like screaming and like, how did you miss that position? You know, like this and that, and they brought the guy there and try, he tried to hit it. The, the, the fan was talking. And then he, he couldn't do it like 10 times or 20 times, you know? Um, so it is just, everyone can, can watch and say, oh, like you should do this. You should do that. But the things are not that easy.
Krasimir Kostadinov: Okay, what's your opinion? Terpelova versus Carolina Pettersson. Do you know Terpelova? I'm 100% sure. I'm sure that I know both of them because they both pulled Dimitrina. Oh, okay. I'm sure it's going to be a great match to watch because they both are like warriors on the table. They don't have such a finishing power but they both
Engin Terzi: depend on controlling the other's hand. So I don't know. You expect a war? Yes, yes, definitely. Yeah. And do you remember Vladimir Maiorov? I know you have the list, but do you know, I ask him, yeah, I will ask you too. Vladimir Maiorov is the guy that Travis was calling Alexander all the time, you know, when he pulled against David Samushia. This guy is going to pull Adam Wojcicki at 187. And...
Engin Terzi: Do you remember the guy or no? At some point he toppled Samushia, but Samushia beat him. Samushia beats everybody. So if you're going to ask me about him, I vote for Samushia. I'm going to go with Adam just because he's from America. Okay. And Krasimir probably will have a little bit more information since Adam beat his teammate Bozhidar.
Engin Terzi: and and then vladimir is from europe probably he was in the same event that you competed against tatasins in moldova when he won the 80 kilo yes and i'm expecting very close level of power and again hook match a long hook match so you don't you don't because many people think that vladimir mairo is gonna just be like different level or something so you are expecting it to be a very close match
Engin Terzi: i i had never seen vladimir flashing people he usually stopped the people and slowly beat them so okay so what you are saying is that adam will have his time to apply his power and once he applies then then it will be a good match because he's strong yes i think so okay and and zurab taubereza versus petro marharins
Engin Terzi: Do you know Petro Marharint, Todd? No. Your list must be different than mine. Okay. Yeah. This is the newest one. Oh, okay. Petro Marharint is the guy that beat the Georgian guy. Okay. David you buy pay-per-view for the last East versus West 12? Not even Levon versus Devon match? I watched it. I watched the Levon versus Devon match, but I didn't buy the pay-per-view. Where did you watch?
Todd Hutchings: 11 versus devon match after so many days was everywhere on the internet i couldn't even okay i'd go to amazon to buy pencils and they would show me that match this this guy can you believe that he doesn't buy paper and after that you're talking about discipline and blah blah blah you see
Engin Terzi: I took all of them back. I took all of them back. Hey, Engin, do you remember the last three or four podcasts we did together where I kept losing signal because I have no internet? Oh, okay. That's why I don't buy pay-per-view. Your internet is only losing for the pay-per-view, but not the Amazon and other things on internet. I'm at work. I'm not at home when the pay-per-view comes up.
Engin Terzi: okay yeah that that you see where i train out in the woods i ain't got no wi-fi out okay okay okay and and petro marharin versus uh zurab taber is the krasimir would have the perfect idea this is your category as well and you never pulled it up but you put marharin yes i am sure that margarine to control the center
Krasimir Kostadinov: Because of his cupping dominance. Yes, his cupping is amazing. Just not sure if his finishing power will be enough to finish the match quickly. In my eyes, Petro is the favorite, but I wouldn't be surprised if Zlatan stopped him and brought him back.
Engin Terzi: Because of his bicep power. Because Marharint from here to here, I mean, incredible from here to here. Yes, yes. But once he comes that close to the pad, he doesn't have the joint pressure, but only dragging like this. And he's probably getting out of space from the elbow or something. I don't know. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: And so you don't know the guy, Marharint. Okay, let's go to the next one. This one, you are the perfect person, Todd. Ibragim Sagov versus Chen Shou. You pulled both of them. And you beat both of them, but neither of them was easy. You had the control, of course, against Sagov, but the finishing wasn't that easy. That's...
Todd Hutchings: know normally i would pick the top roller over the press but his press is pretty good um you know i want to stick with the american but well i think i i think ibrahim's the favorite in that you know a top a really good fast top roller can beat a press i wasn't fast enough to beat ibrahim's hit so i had to i had to absorb it chance might be quick enough to stop it but
Engin Terzi: chance has a lot harder way to win that match than ibrahim does i think ibrahim's got the easier way to win that match but usually chance is doing very well against the guys who are coming forward to him even even you probably you could lose if you couldn't protect your pronator against chance this is what i saw yeah
Engin Terzi: I remember one round, he was like this, and then whenever he went, and his wrist went like this against you, your pronator. But Ibragim just gives everything in just grenades. And don't you think that there is a possibility, a chance to control his pronator? Like when I said the Zurab versus Chance, people said that, why do you say this much? Zurab is going to kill Chance, and then Chance just flash pin him three times. Yeah, Chance needs to...
Todd Hutchings: get ibrahim's hand back behind his shoulder fast because ibrahim for as tall as he is is able to turn all the way around and at that point it could look like somebody pulling jerry catarat all these top rollers get full hand control on jerry catarat he just lays on top of him you got to get a compressor outside his shoulder and ibrahim is like
Todd Hutchings: surprisingly fast at that move like i said i mean i knew what i needed i needed i knew what i needed to do and i could i wasn't quick enough i just had to i just had to swallow it and a top roller is not going to be able to swallow that and come back out you know
Engin Terzi: um but he cannot go side pressure just quick you know like this no I couldn't do it quick uh uh-huh okay but if you're fast if if chance was faster than what he is I would pick him that's you know uh-huh okay you what do you think classy I see Ibragim as the favorite as well
Engin Terzi: see okay there is will o'neill todd how do you do the todd roll recommend it i don't recommend it it's a way it's more of an anti-top roll than it is a it's an empty anti-top roll than a top roll but it's all i can do okay uh crusty i did i cut you or your your opinion was that short you were gonna have something i i don't know actually even
Engin Terzi: If Chance is able to top roll Ibragim, still Ibragim may dead wrist press him. No, if you go like this against Ibragim, it is not a good idea. The thing is, only if you control Ibragim's coordinator and go over, then there could be something. Top roll Ibragim is... I saw him pinning Salahev like that. Yes, yes, exactly.
Engin Terzi: Okay, this one, I don't know if I should ask to Krasimir, but let me ask. Dimitrina Petro, Ayane Takenaka. I'm with Dimitrina. I just hope Dimitrina is strong enough to finish that match quickly, three times. This is what I believe will happen. Why do you hope that? You don't trust her or Samina?
Krasimir Kostadinov: Just the way Ayane pulls is the way that Dimitrina feels not so comfortable against. But I just think that Dimitrina is very strong right now and will be able to finish the match three times quickly. Okay. So that is the plan. So you just set the plan. And Ayane is watching. David you know that?
Engin Terzi: yes i didn't say any secret yeah yeah okay let's go artem tino betty on the left arm you think artem is gonna win yes if the match stops in neutral position in the middle yeah then bit killing
Krasimir Kostadinov: okay so you are saying that betty is stronger but artem is so explosive no i said artyom is stronger but but but but kelly has more endurance and if he's able to stop the match then he may win okay okay um
Engin Terzi: And do you know these guys, Artem Taynov and Betkili? I know Artem Taynov. And I'm impressed just how fast he is. So I would pick him. Probably who the other guy was. But Betkili, you don't remember, probably. If I'd look him up, I don't remember him just from his name being printed on this picture. Daniel Prokopchuk versus Bozhidar Simeonov. This match,
Engin Terzi: people says daniel is the favorite his left arm is unbeatable and he has like four or five world titles with left only one or one more title with right people uh thinks that daniel is favorite but i kind of feel that i will hear something different from krasimir about this in my eyes because the last time they met won so
Engin Terzi: but i see very close match you see they call because i know that bojada uh of course sasho beats him but like when he trains with someone like sasho fully squinted and doing this it is almost the same thing that is daniel is doing with the left arm but you know still like fully squinted i'm not talking about right arm right arm it opposes as well left sasho is not doing that with left
Engin Terzi: Yeah, but when I saw him many, many, many times that he gets supinated, especially with left arm, just recently I see him going outside and doing those kind of things. I have seen people are just taking him here and he's being like this. I remember him versus Artem Taino. I remember him versus Clement Dimitrov at the last world that Clement and
Engin Terzi: Artem Taino competed. Do you remember those matches? Sasho was exactly like this, and then they were like this. But he's against the top bowlers. He was able to hit like this. And I know that many times Bozhidar trained with him. And I think he is very, very used to pulling against. Do you remember his match with Mazgan Shamiev? Supermatch?
Engin Terzi: in istanbul yes yes yes yeah so mazgan is the almost similar guy you know so you are saying that he will be a hard match but bojidar is favorites yes but it's going to be close close okay and talk any opinion about this match i don't have an opinion but i do like daniel every time i see him i root for him so i'll be rooting for him yeah and okay this one
Todd Hutchings: Thoughts. You start. Travis Bergen, Sergei Kalinichenko. Look at those face. Travis, I mean, God, he's been gone for what, 20 years? I can't remember how big Travis. I pulled Travis going into the Dadakin match, I think. No, Travis didn't hit. We slow pulled.
Todd Hutchings: so he had a lot of it back and i've he's pulled a few local tournaments i don't i don't think travis would come here if he wasn't super confident yeah um so and you know you can't travis at one point was you know the best in the world period so he knows how to get there so the best of travis how would he do today in top 10
Todd Hutchings: Well, when Travis was the whole sports come up a lot since Travis was the best in the world, you know? But, you know, if it was Travis then versus the best in the world now. He would probably not be the best, but but he would be younger. Travis was alive now. He would have trained differently now because if Travis had the
Todd Hutchings: the advantage of following the sport as it improved, he would have improved as well. So Travis, the athlete, would probably still be in the top four or five of the world, you know, had he never quit. But the Travis from back then versus the guys today isn't fair because everybody's gotten better and stronger and smarter since then. But still you think that he would make top 10, right? I think, yeah, I think there's a...
Todd Hutchings: there's a certain makeup that just makes some people just superb athletes. And Travis is one of those people who knows how to train and dedicate and win tournaments, to be honest. So we'll see how much he's been preparing lately. It's always iffy when somebody has been gone for a long time when they first come back, you know, because you don't have the- Go ahead, sorry.
Todd Hutchings: You just don't have the, you know, you lose a lot of the, the roughing's a little different now, the, you know, the tables, the rules, everything's just, just a little awkward and it's kind of hard to adapt to that, you know. It might be to his advantage. Go ahead. East versus west rules are like very different for you?
Todd Hutchings: When Travis was the best in the world, it was like Zloty Tour rules. So tiny little elbow fouls. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, that's changed. Okay. When do you think the best of Travis was? 2016 when he beat Dave Chaffee? You think he was his best or you think that in 2000s, you know, mid-2000s? I think when he was beating Vovoda, when he was winning those super matches in PAL or for Igor, I think.
Engin Terzi: When he beat Boivoda, it was 2003. Next year, Boivoda beat him. Yeah, well. But 2003, then, is the version up. I mean... 2003, around that time, John probably was beating him. And he beat Boivoda a few months later. Marcio beat him, I think, at finals or somewhere he beat him. So maybe not that time, but my opinion is like late, like after 2005, those years. And then 2016, when he beat
Engin Terzi: uh dave chaffee and i think jerry he beat both of them yeah yeah and i think he was very dominant yeah travis's career always had highs and lows you know yeah okay and what do you think uh in my eyes sergey is huge favorite in this match
Krasimir Kostadinov: Just Sergei is super impressive lately. He dominated a rift. He beat almost all the guys. He lost just to Zeranov and in the first two rounds he was able to... Yeah, but you are saying like Zeranov after like a few years of absence, he just came like two months training. I think Zeranov today and Zeranov that
Engin Terzi: Why do you say that Zeranov was with just two months of training? Because I talked with him all the time. I was inviting him. He didn't pull after the, you know, those times, you know. He was like maybe two years or something he was away. Like one and a half year or... I didn't pull that. Yeah, I mean, where did he pull? He didn't pull the WAP 2021. He didn't pull 2022 Asian Championship or anything, you know. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: I thought he was training and competing there. I don't know. No, I talked with him. I asked him, how is your form? I never set a match to a guy that is not really active. I asked them first, how is your form? And he says, like, two, three months. Same was Revas when he came Michael match. Same was Samushia when he came to Pauline match. So you are saying that Sergi is going to win, basically. Yes, yes, I think so.
Engin Terzi: Is it because Sergei is so good or Travis will not be at his best? Because Sergei is super good and Travis, I don't believe he will be at his peak immediately after when he returns now. Yeah, I think there are some of the athletes, they know how to prepare themselves. If they are coming back, you know, like Jerry came after 2019, he beat Gennady right away. They said, oh, why you set him? You know, he has been away. And then...
Engin Terzi: Ongarbev just came and won the title and defended three times in a row. Like after 2019 top eight, he didn't pull anywhere. And like this, you know, like people just comes out of nowhere, but they have a past. They know how to make themselves ready, you know, like not a new guy, but some people, you know, can do that. Like, for example, Levan Saginashvili with left arm.
Engin Terzi: hasn't been active since 2018 if he comes and says i'm ready i think he has a good chance to win the title because he knows how to prepare himself here yes yes i agree okay let's go to the next one barbara baggio in my mind barbara is the favorite but if the match
Engin Terzi: is close maybe egla will be able to to take it because of experience yes yeah and do you know these ladies todd i know egla i don't recognize the other one barbara is the one that beat gabriella in a super match oh the big one like that and i vote for her oh yeah okay
Engin Terzi: You remember her, right? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. That's yeah. She's huge vote for her. Yeah. Yeah. She is like 125 kilo and she's like, Oh, like probably one 90, like 63 years. Yeah. And she's very strong. I have seen her beating the guys in that side table, you know? And okay. This one, I just want to score Tata things versus crossing with Costa, you know, four zero.
Engin Terzi: You will pull him one side table after 3-0 match finish, or you just think that you're still pulling the title match? For old time's sake. I want that free sandwich. I hope you're right about the result, just the direction. I hope you're right. Okay. No, but just tell Kershman, how do you feel? What's that?
Krasimir Kostadinov: i don't know how strong he is i just know that i'm giving my best on the trainings so you you you feel like you can dominate him or you think it will be a very tough match and then both guys will win some rounds and i am so strong i am so strong i can reach westward and grab yesterday's sunshine and pull it into today
Krasimir Kostadinov: if you are so strong just start the start the match with straight wrist and not curled like this but straight like this hey i don't tell you how to pull okay i just say that when the people are confident they start the match fair and square oh now you are telling him calling him unfair that's up for the rest that's up for the rest to decide
Engin Terzi: going like no no at the at the east versus everything used to be straight risk there can't be anything bent or anything i prefer the ref script anyway so if i'm starting carved in it's the rest fall you know i don't pull too many matches without a rough script you you want you want to go ref script classic i prefer not to actually just i won't usually i just do this okay
Engin Terzi: anyway so i'm not gonna go there the last four matches evgeny prudnik iraq is really well i beat i've never lost one guy and i've never beat the other so i'm gonna pick prudnik but don't you think the times change you are type of guy that like to analyze and things right now you are just good in soul going like so black and white i beat this guy i lost this guy so this guy beats this guy
Engin Terzi: You know, are you generally elected or are you just doing shortcut right now? I never felt competitive against Prudnik. So, I mean, to me, I think Prudnik. But do you think that he is the same guy? Because just remember, since December 2022, sorry, November, he hasn't pulled any right arm match at the East versus West or any high level. And he got hurt after the, he said that I think he got hurt when he pulled you, I think.
Engin Terzi: then he said that he didn't have the side pressure against devon and since then he didn't pull with right arm so this is his comeback match after what for 20 months 20 months so yeah things make and then it actually is so young he may be improving as well yeah i actually expected prudnik to do better against devon than what he did so if he was hurt that explains it but i expected the devon prudnik match to be a lot quicker closer than that
Engin Terzi: And Krasimir? Prudnik, Irakli? Irakli is a slight favorite. Slightly favorite. And how do you think that Prudnik should pull? We know the way that Irakli is going to pull. How do you think? Because he's the versatile one. If Prudnik goes inside, I think Irakli will topple him. If he goes outside, I don't know what will happen. Okay. I understand. So I kind of think that
Engin Terzi: I don't know. I don't know if anyone can cook. I don't know. I would like, I would like to give a second chance soon. Okay. I mean, if you beat, if you beat that, you know, you will have so many different opportunities. So it's just possibly in the weight class below us. Yeah. But he pulls one of five as well. That's where he is pulling right now. Put it in one of five. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: and and let's go to the next one incredible david does this can oleg petronko we talk about this one you both think that oleg is like the favorites or okay so then let's go to the last two matches this is incredible because tatasin said that david samisha doesn't lose and now his opponent is sasho and
Engin Terzi: And so does he still think that way, but this is 187. So usually Sasho is like 198. And now he's just one step lighter. So how do you see this match Todd? Because like, I'm sure that, you know, both guys very well. I think Samushia is the, uh, a clear favorite, clear favorites.
Engin Terzi: wow that is interesting clear is interesting same favorite is yes but why do you think that i think he's one of the best arm wrestlers out there i really do i think you could probably move him up a couple of weight classes yeah i mean i'm not sure about that because he didn't he doesn't really win his category in a very dominant fashion but
Engin Terzi: like always dwarf you know and so you how do you think the match is gonna go he's gonna just you said the clear favor he's gonna dominate the match or he's gonna stop sasha somewhere i think it'll still be um a long match you know it might look like he just barely wins but i think he wins i don't think he's in danger of losing that match myself okay the customer also told me very interesting customer is the
Engin Terzi: teammate of Sasho, he says that, I think I remember, correct me if I'm wrong, you said that Sasho will start attacking and then he will have a problem to finish Samushia. Do you still think the same way? I'm sure that Sasho will dominate the center. Yeah. His wrist is super solid and he will dominate the center and he will bring him near to the pin pad.
Krasimir Kostadinov: If he will be able to finish the match quickly, I don't know this. But I'm sure that Sasho will dominate the center. And what happens from there, I don't know. But you are saying that last time you said, you said that probably Samushia will exhaust him. Or maybe I remember wrong. I see Samushia like the guy with better endurance.
Krasimir Kostadinov: Evgeny from touch, he has incredible endurance. Not anymore, I think. Is it because of his chest or something else? I believe when he was younger, he was with better endurance. He was just pulling more on the table and his endurance was better. This is my opinion. Okay.
Krasimir Kostadinov: But I'm sure that he will be the stronger guy. I'm just not sure if he will be able to finish the match. Because if he wants to win that match, he needs to finish it quickly. If he stops and goes in deep war, I'm not sure who is going to win. That's very interesting that you think that Sasho's endurance is like
Engin Terzi: Like nothing compared to Samushia's. That's interesting. I don't say it's nothing. No, no. Compared to Samushia's. You said that if it is endurance game, you said Samushia is winning. No, no, no. I don't say this. I just believe that Samushia has a little better endurance. Oh, little, little. So you are saying that Sasho may still have better endurance than Samushia.
Engin Terzi: i don't know i don't know just i think that samusha has better endurance okay okay so it means that if the match goes to the endurance game samusha is winning yes but i may be wrong okay okay yeah yeah we all may be wrong yeah and what do you think about this you were laughing but what do you think that do you think that sasha may have better endurance or
Engin Terzi: I'm just in Team Samushia, so I don't care. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. And the last match, Artem Morozov versus Vitalii Laletin, right arm. Artem Morozov is my favorite arm wrestler today, so I vote for him. He's just, he's my, hands down, my favorite guy. Somehow, when you do analysis for your own matches, you are like super calculated.
Engin Terzi: But whenever it is something else, then you just go, this is my favorite guy. I don't lose money on other people's matches. When he goes for another match, he's like, oh, this guy is more handsome. I go with him. I'm not sure about handsome. I'm not sure if he cares about that one. Maybe about the ladies are nothing, but not guys, I think. How do you see it?
Engin Terzi: I don't know what to expect, actually. I really don't know. David you see the podcast yesterday? And he said that he would do this to him because... Yeah, I watched a lot from the podcast and it was a very, very interesting one. Yeah. But when we leave the joke aside, I really don't know what to expect from this match.
Engin Terzi: Do you think that there is any possibility for him to hook Laritin? Yes. Really? Wow, that's interesting. I think at some point when Laritin was very light, you hooked him, right? Not at some point. I was beating him consistently. Yeah, but when he was very light, right? Like 100 kilos and lower. I beat him when we pulled
Krasimir Kostadinov: azerbaijan 2014 at the europeans what was it 90 90 kilo or 100 kilos 100 kilo okay after that the worlds i i was first he got third he couldn't beat the ukrainian guy uh after that we met 2016 at zloty i had one minute match with norman thompson's in hook
Krasimir Kostadinov: And five minutes later, I smashed Vitalii without the straps. What was it? 105 kilos? 105, yes. And after that, in the final, again, I beat him directly out of the straps. But when he gained weight, you guys did a super match. After that, in 2017, we pulled again at Zloty.
Krasimir Kostadinov: he was pulling the heavies back then heavyweights super heavyweight and we slipped straps and with the straps i stopped him here exactly to the pin pad and i was going to bring him back but the referee said stop win so he beat me here at the vendetta he killed me yes but other than that uh
Engin Terzi: this is basically what i said when he was lighter you beat him when he gained the weight because he is like 205 like 100 kilo kind of light for that that uh guy but no i'm not taking anything from you you are you are great but what i'm just saying that like he was lighter he was like yes so he looks skinny you understand in those years i remember him yeah yes she was lighter yeah
Engin Terzi: yeah sure right now he's 140 kilo so i think the more he gains weight more it is in his favor because those guys like i wouldn't be surprised if he would be 170 kilo i don't think he would look fat he would still look whatever yeah i agree but it's possible to be hooked when he pulled here with me when he killed me here he pulled at the uh after to the side table he pulled with your dance on it
Krasimir Kostadinov: With left, he couldn't top-roll Jordan. Jordan was curling him inside. Jordan was beating him at the side table. No, he was not beating him, but he was curling him and Vitalii was beating him to the side. Vitalii was beating him inside. Back then, Vitalii said, I have never pulled anyone with such a curling ability like your left. Jordan is one of them, for sure. For sure.
Krasimir Kostadinov: and the term is is the same height as you've done very high tall guy and long arms long hands big hands so maybe he will be able to hook him i remember you remember like two years ago or something when they had a super match with matushenko i think first two rounds matushenko won in hook
Krasimir Kostadinov: Yes, I remember that. And it was even out of the straps. And Matushenko could do way better with the straps. But Matushenko, after that, I asked him, why you didn't slip? He said, because I couldn't slip from here. I think some rounds he lost with the strap as well, I think. No? Anyways, so what I'm just saying is, yeah, you're right. Matushenko twice shook him and beat him.
Engin Terzi: and yeah morozo you are right yesterday in the podcast you know vitaly said that you cannot i will flash pin you but if i go inside maybe i go intentionally on round four and then i heard that 50 50. and and do you think that there is a possibility we tell it to be morozo inside
Engin Terzi: yes it's possible it's possible wow that's that's interesting yeah that's why i don't know what to expect from that match yeah yeah yeah yeah okay let's see let's see how it will be and there will be great matches uh todd very soon we will have a super match for you in florida as well uh we will see you said that weight doesn't matter i'm right now negotiating with uh levan but we we didn't make the deal yet
Engin Terzi: 10 or later, either now or in 12 years. Yeah. Anyways, so, guys, thank you very much. See you in four weeks in Istanbul. And I'm sure you guys will have a great match. And I wish you guys a great, healthy preparation. And see you guys soon in Istanbul. And then...
Engin Terzi: I think Krasimir is going to bring the paper for your farm if you win. He's going to sign it and then give it to you. And Krasimir asked me, are you going to give him anything over there in the U.S. for farm if he beats you? I don't think we run a program about beating Americans, but I'll check. I'll check the International Federation, see if we have any rewards programs like that. Krasimir also said that he beat like...
Engin Terzi: don't know he beats jumbo zinc many times and like three at least three times on my playlist he's got three oh yeah he knows he's just watching them do you even watch those matches i watch all krazy matches yeah okay okay how many how many american did you beat i don't know not not that much actually because
Engin Terzi: Your career was in the WAP and Europeans and they didn't come. There ain't very many of us. You pulled Chafee, Brzee, me. I can't think of another. I think he lost to... David you lose to Corey West or you beat Corey West? I lost to Corey. I beat Doug Allen with left and I won against Marcio at Zloty too. Oh, yeah. Okay. Okay.
Engin Terzi: who won marcia versus you at the wl he beat me there was it three two three one it was three one okay it was a great matches anyway so so okay so he says that basically todd is saying that todd is undefeated against the bulgarians so he can have a farm if he beats you you need to work a little bit harder to get the farm in u.s is that correct yeah u.s farms are a lot bigger than bulgarian farms so you got to beat a lot more people
Engin Terzi: Thank you guys. Take care and see you guys soon. Bye bye. Okay guys, they left. Maybe we talk a little bit more. Wow, it's one hour and 22 minutes. And I started like 10 minutes early, so one and a half hour.
