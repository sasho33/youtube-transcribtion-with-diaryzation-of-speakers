So, uh, be there for all the meetings, like you delegate all the meetings, like, and let's say we're doing the face-offs you in the middle for the face-offs let's help that. And, um, also, you know, cause you're doing commentary, so it's fine for the event, but maybe after the event ends, you come down, you know, say something and I'll be there the whole time. Okay.

Absolute legend. Absolute legend. Yeah. Go down. Yeah. Engin, you are the fucking number one arm wrestling promoter. Forget arm wrestling. We all know that you've killed it. You're the number one arm wrestling promoter.

Travis Bagent: It's something that is from the heart that you just, like, it just doesn't matter, you understand? And that's why you're the best, Engen. And that's why. Stop it, you know, just... So how is it going? We saw Ayane is flash spinning you like nothing, you know? Ayane? Yeah, the Japanese girl was... Oh, come on. No, I'm like... No, listen, of course, joking aside, that you would just hold her whole body, but...
Travis Bagent: Is she strong in a real field? Yes. David you know that she does one arm pull-up? No, I don't know. Yeah. She's 55. She's a world champion. Stronger than me, LeVon? Stronger than me? Stronger than me. Is he stronger than Devin? Of course, Devin. Of course. I believe it. I believe it. Yeah. Yeah.
Travis Bagent: yeah maybe before before the others come you you you you do just super chats you maybe you read yeah yeah david tomm says so we get more soon engine um yeah like we all are we live already yeah we're live yeah from the beginning really oh my god yeah okay you can take all the words back i didn't even know we were alive yet i didn't even know yeah okay okay
Engin Terzi: I just hope it doesn't get out that Devin likes Engin and Engin likes Devin. What have I done for my brand? According to comments, you guys hate each other. And Levin hates everyone. We all know that. Yeah. Okay. So can I say that just open this with legalize the Kings move?
Travis Bagent: We just start there. I'm not drunk enough for this conversation. I'm just saying, listen, Engin, you better fucking stay alive. You better stay alive. What I'm talking about, everyone, everyone on this podcast hates the desperation move. I remember I asked Levan, Levan said, it's not harmless. If this is the only reason you stay alive, if this is the only reason you stay alive,
Engin Terzi: Listen, if something happens to you, Devon will, in like five minutes, he will convince all of us. I will take the debt. I will go to grave.
Travis Bagent: And then my last war in the whole will be that fucking desperation war. You better stay here to fight it because I'll tell you, I'll tell you, the world will be merciless. There will be no opposition for me to change that rule. I stayed the whole world by opposing you, just standing against you. Is that Gasparini?
Travis Bagent: We have a few super chats. I'm going to read them quickly. Hey, Hermes. You don't feel the power coming? That is not same power, my friend. You need to feel the power, no? Hermes, when you came to the podcast before, we all were like, we couldn't speak, you know?
Travis Bagent: All right. When do you guys land? When do you guys land? I'll be on Tuesday 11 when you're arriving. Um, um, no, uh, uh, Thursday, either Tuesday or Wednesday.
Engin Terzi: You better kill those Super Chats, you know. I'll go quickly for Super Chats. Yeah, because now Travis come, and Travis come, nobody will be able to speak. I know, there's no words we're going to get in there. Totten, Oleg, Lovechild, Engin, rest please, brother. Benji, Mac, heal up quickly, Engin, you're the man, Armisen needs you. My God, give him great strength and health. Thank you. There are more, four of them, five of them. Yeah, I'm going, I'm going, I'm trying to
Travis Bagent: Not to miss them. Hermes, when do you land? No, he's not coming. Oh, you're not? Hermes, come on. Come on, why are you not coming to East versus West 13? I agree. Come on. I told him that I need you, Hermes. He said, who gives a shit? Oh, Hermes.
Engin Terzi: No truth, no truth. We have a super chatting question for Levan. Tim Frick says, Levan, now that you know Devin on the table well, who power and technique wise is comparable to Devin and who would be a good match to Devin, in your opinion, Levan? Who? No. Yeah, yeah. To very small and weak. Quality, my friend, quality, quality.
Travis Bagent: Quality, my friend. What weight do you want to pull down? Irakli Zirakashvili, that tight pants wearing, that Robin to Batman. This guy, if I can't beat you, Levan, I beat your training partner. Irakli fucking. Levan, 95 kilos. Irakli, 95 kilos. Who's winning?
Travis Bagent: 95 kilo Dillon. Oh my God. Like body be that I now body builder, body builder, man, physique, man, physique. I'm gonna next event. I wear a thong arm wrestle. No, please don't. Yeah. Please don't PG 13. Rob cost indexes all great men here. Thank you for your super chat and your support, Rob.
Travis Bagent: the man yeah so okay you come on thursday yes i see i see your uh message video on instagram and of course you can find it
Engin Terzi: Listen, guys, there's the big match before we get to Travis, but there's two guys that are going to fight in the super heavyweights that are dangerous, I think, for everyone. It's Artem Morozov versus Vitalii Litin. I have done a few podcasts with many people, and Petro and Dadikyan both said that they believe Arteon will win. And then we did, like, another podcast...
Engin Terzi: Who do we have on? I'm losing my mind. And they see it completely the opposite. Do you guys see it as a close match? I want to hear what Hermes thinks. Do you see it as a close match or do you see it that will be very one-sided? Hermes. Because I think Morozov maybe have more bicep power than Laletin.
Travis Bagent: I think he will lose the wrist, but I don't know if he will lose the pain. How he can lose the wrist. If he loses the wrist totally like this, maybe like this he can use the power here, the back pressure and the side pressure. It's a very close match. He's really 50-50. Devin, on the armrest, you said that Morozov has
Travis Bagent: more more that's on it uh let me look let me look uh it was when i checked last but yeah it's a close match it's very close before we lose the supercharger and then devon looks hanging what are your thoughts on australia's new number one ricard borman he's only 19. will you give him a match at east west west
Travis Bagent: I think as far as I heard, he is coming to the qualification finals. I can't wait to see him. I like that he is making his own way. If he is coming here all the way from Australia, it's not like someone coming from Georgia or Bulgaria.
Travis Bagent: Belgium, you know, if he's coming all the way from Australia, I love those people, you know, that they, I mean, all of them, but just this is a little bit more sacrifice. Yeah. By the way, which is PD recovery. Thank you for your super chat. Sorry, I'm just trying to get these done. Yeah, yeah. Levan, what did you guys do to Portugal? What did you guys do to Portugal?
Travis Bagent: Listen, listen, the world doesn't know the Georgians. I have known the Georgians for more than 30 years. I have seen them winning just 12, 13 goals in the seniors in 1994 wars. I know how tough men they are. But now in football, like it was very surprising. I thought that Portugal would win. You know, it was very surprising. And you guys did a great job. Evgeny when we won against you,
Travis Bagent: We were lucky. You guys missed so many opportunities. It could be a very close match. It was 3-1, but he could finish 3-3. Yeah, very good match. Very close, very good match. What's the population of Georgia? Three million and a half. Three and a half million. What the fuck is going on? What the fuck?
Travis Bagent: Crazy, it's crazy. You know, you know, you know the... Aha, who came here? It's me. Hi, Inge. Hello, great to see you. Great to see you. Hello. You know, what is that, the Asterix? You know Asterix? Yeah, they are fighting against big, big, big Roman Empire. And there is... Asterix. Our only thing is Georgia.
Travis Bagent: With so little village, but just against the big empires. Yeah, seems to be. Seems to be. Tom Big is asking, Devin, will you face Levin again? In East vs West 700. Yes, of course. Only after England relaxes a little bit and we legalize the Kings move.
Travis Bagent: Listen, I don't know about what Tony K thinks, but Hermes, Rymus, Levan and me, we all are against that cheating move. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you talking about? What are you talking about?
Travis Bagent: why why are you saying that you didn't even ask their opinion actually listen listen this isn't their opinion i asked i don't have an interview with that one i know what raymond sings forever he is a promising guy do you think this is our messing under the table like this yeah good technique
Travis Bagent: People will cut that part and then post it. Too late. We're not here. No, no, really. I don't like zero. It's not interesting, right? Look at this. Can you see this? It's not wrestling.
Engin Terzi: Crazy George photo. Crazy George. Listen, Devon, this isn't for us to promote eSource West 13. This is intervention. I can't believe it.
Engin Terzi: Listen, from one side… One of my duties is going to be to make the Kings move legal again. Ramos, Ramos. From one side, he tells me to take rest, get dressed. And from the other side, he's just spending all my energy making me angry, you know. Hey, guys, I have to read the super chat and we continue. John Warner says, God bless our athletes and England's recovery. We love you and pray for you. Thank you. The best live stream on the internet. Adam right it is. This is the best, biggest live stream you will ever see in arm wrestling.
Engin Terzi: uh michael's workspace excited for hunter versus dog on east versus west 14 devon your thoughts so doug ehrlich gonna fight with um with hunter uh great performance like great up and coming how do you see that match yeah hunter nos is something very special
Travis Bagent: Hunter Knopf, the first time I arm wrestled with Hunter Knopf at the 154, yeah, blew me away. There's a lot of trouble in that class. There's another kid, Alexander Kostadze. That's a bad kid, too. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey, Travis, what's up, champ? What's up, fellas? Travis. Yeah. Do you guys want to hear something crazy? Go ahead.
Travis Bagent: Dude, I just woke up, Ingen, very apologetic, but I was getting my beauty sleep. And I had a dream I was the double fucking champ again. Just like 20 minutes ago, I was fucking killing everybody, dude. You hear that, Levans? Oh, I didn't know the champ was here. I didn't know the champ was here. I'm sorry. I had no idea the champ was here.
Travis Bagent: I thought it was just a couple bums like Coach Ray and Devin. I didn't know the champ was in the house. Hey, Travis, is it too close? Travis, you're taking too much testosterone. You're not talking like yourself. This is crazy. Oh, my goodness. You're too juicy, my man. You're too juicy. Levon, do you see the creatine running through my veins?
Travis Bagent: uh how are you camp you're good yeah yeah yes good good how are you you're looking in good shape yeah yeah i'm coming your hands is big biceps yeah yeah we tried to get a match with gennady chickened out
Travis Bagent: You're growing and the Devon is getting smaller. There's something in there. We take turns. We take turns. Travis. Travis. Travis. Travis. Travis. Travis. Travis. Travis. Travis. Travis. Travis. Travis. Travis. Travis. Travis. Travis. Travis. Travis. Travis. Travis. Travis. Travis.
Travis Bagent: Come on, man. I got your back, buddy. Listen, I am in full support. Full fucking steam ahead. I've been watching the videos. The truth is that Devin has a STD of some sort, and he is working that out. He is... Listen. Little pink guy got it. Little pink guy. No, I think that...
Travis Bagent: You know what? I just think that Devin gave it a good shot at it. He's going to marinate for a couple years here, maybe 18 months, let everything digest, and then he'll be back at them. In the meantime, he'll take care of those other light classes and
Travis Bagent: I am going to be our spear. So although I'm sure comical in some of the local coffee shops in Georgia, the truth is that I'm going to give it a crack at it. And I think that I'm feeling pretty juicy, though, these days. So I don't know. I'm excited to get started. And I really did have a dream that I beat Levon and was the champ. Left or right?
Travis Bagent: This was left-handed, but I had two belts already over there in the corner, so I don't even know where they came from. I forgot about those dreams, but when I took the belt from him, I turned. That's 115-kilo right arm against Devin. Left arm was single-beater, yeah. I was thinking about that, yeah. What if I had four belts?
Travis Bagent: That would be the only way that I could be the best. Ingen, how are you feeling, man? What's going on right now? You okay? I mean, yesterday was, again, the temperature dropped.
Travis Bagent: uh increased and then i came hospital and then they did the blood blood test and then the infection at the uh allowed level like healthy level like the top of the health level is it was 30 times more
Travis Bagent: and yeah yeah it's just i don't want to go there i don't want to i have been stuck in the last 10 days um everything just let's talk about nothing we don't want to board i had the same i had the same infection the same surgery you know how long it took me no 25 minutes i was back at adam 25 minutes yeah yeah today not everyone's a beast
Travis Bagent: Get out of that fucking bed immediately. Let's go. Hey, Travis, I heard a rumor that you were shopping for a left-handed match at East vs. West 13th.
Travis Bagent: yeah we i thought we had it we uh we invited gnadi and ingen told me that uh he did he sent out the invite he was giving gnadi more money he'd ever given him gnadi said there's not enough money in the world for me to mess with that guy not at this short of a time frame this guy should be working as a screenwriter in hollywood you know just he's just wasting himself as an artist
Travis Bagent: Yeah, I asked Gennady. Gennady said there is not enough time to get prepared, you know, because he's not prepared with right arm, like he is prepared. And then, so whenever you prepare one arm, the other one is ready, you know, because the creating goes to both sides, right? So, but just Gennady, Gennady said there is not enough time. So, you know, he's saying about the money that I have never ever paid.
Travis Bagent: i don't know how he's doing these things with these i think this is how this is the way they would explain inside information inside hey uh uh ermy talk to me now now when i was all when i was over there just being the announcer you was mr bully well take a look at the screen right now and say something
Travis Bagent: Say something now and see who comes out here to greet you in the morning. I don't understand. He tells you to talk shit about him now. You were talking shit in the past. Now he's ready and you would be scared. I don't consider him nothing. Why I need to do this? Look at the size of my fucking forehead. See that? I don't consider him nothing.
Travis Bagent: why you need to do these because you can't even keep a straight face you can't even see it you see growing i can't even be in the screen almost guys you think you can beat ermie's right hand i mean you know what i think that he's sloppy up top and i think that as soon as you get a hold of that index finger and take away that leverage
Travis Bagent: gets a little gets a little shaky quickly so i don't i definitely know how to do it there was a time when i could have did it easily i'm wondering if i'll ever be that guy again and listen i feel like that guy right now right now sitting here i feel like i am tough boy so we'll see we still the right hand has to it really does have to um
Travis Bagent: uh prove itself and i'm okay with that it's gonna prove to me too um so i'm excited so we'll know a lot more 10 days from now i remember you i remember you i we had an agreement two three months ago with the left hand but you don't accept
Travis Bagent: Well, now that's gone, right? I mean, you've already destroyed any potential match that you could ever get with the greatest left-handed arm wrestle that has ever lived, okay? Your only chance now is to get a date with this beast right here. And look at the girth. You see it, Devin?
Travis Bagent: Fucking frightening, buddy. It's frightening. I haven't seen that kind of girl in a long time. I mean, not with me you haven't. I guarantee you. You got this thing, too, Travis. Like, at all the armrests, all the armrests, LeVon's got the most. LeVon's definitely the most. What is that? Is that a handicap? Ah, it's just a sign of... A generation that you guys have? Yeah, I don't have any of that shit. Yeah. This is all...
Engin Terzi: United States USDA confirmed muscle right here. Okay, I'm going to read some Super Chats. It's UCLFNidiot, and he's saying, if MMT and Devin rematch, would you allow Kings move? Engin, quick answer. Who is the other person? If Michael Monser-Tahan and Devin rematch, would you allow Kings move? Quick answer. Exactly.
Engin Terzi: GB1911, who interests you left-handed as your first match? When you're coming back with your left arm, who would be interesting for you to have as a first match? Let me beat my guys at the gym first. I'll think about that later. And a personal question for Travis.
Travis Bagent: So you feel ready for Kalina? I mean, yeah, I don't know if I'm ready for anybody, but I feel ready for myself. That's for sure. So I've been I think I've been on five or six of the podcast. The arm wrestling machine is right here behind me chilling. And once a day, I feel like I could definitely beat a lot of people. So we'll see if it translates. But the truth is, is I'm probably going to be overwhelming.
Travis Bagent: Absolutely overwhelming to everyone in the place. Travis, not Travis, sorry, Hermes. Travis told me that after the Florida event, challenger is versus challenger. He said that Giordano with two hands, he couldn't beat Travis's right arm. Good.
Travis Bagent: That's true, right? And he told me that if I would have been born with Italian descent, I could be the president of the country. That was the two things he said to me after he felt this fucking thing. Listen, they say laughter is the best medicine. I hope you enjoy all of this. As much as we enjoy Travis. Final form Travis Bajan.
Travis Bagent: New Berlusconi. New Berlusconi? New Berlusconi. Where is Berlusconi? What does Levan think about Irakli? Good? Oh, he's a... I don't know. Amazing strength. He's in crazy shape.
Travis Bagent: does he beat does he beat armies sorry does yeah does he beat uh sorry not armies does he beat uh nick yes yes yes yes wow wow wow do you know what the term in america cap have you ever heard that levon have you ever heard someone say cap
Travis Bagent: Cap means that that's a lie. Prove it for the win. Prove it for the win. He's going to roll him over. Just kill him. And what about...
Travis Bagent: Most important. Come on, man. What's the big match? Alexander. Alexander versus Alexander. Yeah. So, Ante Morozov, Vitalii Lebedev. It's a middleweight match. A middleweight match. Yeah. Okay. Davykan versus Petro. Yeah. That's the match to me. That's the one. That's the number one match. Incredible. I'm going Petro.
Travis Bagent: I'm also going Petro. Travis, you said that Prudnik is going to beat you. It looks like you are supporting Prudnik. Remember, Prudnik is the corner man of Kalinichenko. Yeah, no problem. No problem. Okay. Yeah, no problem. I don't worry about those guys, man. I've been beating up those guys for a long time, man. 20 years, man. No problem. No problem.
Travis Bagent: Prudnik asked me to pull against your left arm in this event. I said, listen, the one loss is enough for Travis. We cannot do this to him. Yeah, he's too little. He's too small, man. Too small. He's too small? He cannot beat your left arm? Say it again. He cannot beat your left arm right now? No, no, no. But would you accept the match? Yes. Yes.
Travis Bagent: Okay, yeah. And are you in any condition? Artem you in any condition to call your accountant, Ingen and set it up? I don't have an accountant. Whoa, accountant, who makes the money decisions? Me. Hey, all right. One more person then. Get him on the phone. Devin, get your man on the phone.
Travis Bagent: But by the way, Travis, why are you missing everyone over here except LeVon? And I remember that you were talking about beating LeVon. As soon as I got on the, listen, I set it up as soon as I got on the thing. I said, I just had a dream. I was the double champ. I beat LeVon. And then I could tell LeVon got scared. You got all scared. Everybody got scared. So I just kind of laid off of it.
Travis Bagent: I don't want to get the big man all fucked up. We don't even know if he can pull left-handed anymore. You're talking about the greatest left-hander that has ever lived is training again. Levan, is Travis the greatest left-arm ever? In your shape, he could beat you left-arm? In your best shape? I don't know, you know. I don't know.
Travis Bagent: I don't know. No chance. No chance. No chance. Don't let me get it. Don't let me get you in that position Devin had you in that first round, boy. I might be a little more aggressive. I might be a little more aggressive. I just messaged Kutnick. He might join us. Get him off the opera. Get him out of the opera. You have a uniform?
Travis Bagent: New phone. New phone. Who did you call, Dylan? I called Evgeny, but no answer. No answer. Oh. Yeah, he's not going to take that match, man. Trust me. Left-handed, I'm a problem, guys. A problem. I bet you'd take the match. I bet he would.
Travis Bagent: Well, we'll see here. Get him on the phone there, Mr. Don King. I'm trying, buddy. Get him on the phone, Don King. I'm trying. I'm trying. Listen, listen, listen, listen. Without negotiating, I'm not sitting very much one week before the event. This guy, this guy, nah, nah. Let's go. I'm telling you. Question for Trump. Artem you planning to cover the event?
Engin Terzi: The match, don't make deals, please, because... As soon as we started talking about money... It's very easy. As soon as we started talking about money... If 200 people buy the pay-per-view now, we set it up. 200 people go buy the pay-per-view now, and we set it up. As soon as we mentioned the money, he started holding his store. The incision started hurting him every time he started talking about the money.
Engin Terzi: listen uh super chat question from gb219 travis did you pull prime siplenko left-handed um no i did not i did not but he didn't pull anybody he only had like seven matches in his whole career how does this talking mad about you get on the link and slide buddy
Engin Terzi: uh okay devon question for you from john lewis uh first get well engine question for devon do you have what it takes to beat monster six zero since you dropped in weight do you think you still you still have mike's number yeah yeah yeah i'm gonna i'll tell you when i come back i'm gonna it's gonna be i it's pretty wild i'm gonna tell you no
Travis Bagent: When you get to feel like, LaVon, thank you very much. When you get to feel like some real good lessons, you go back to your cave, you fast, you wither away. And then when you come back to life, I'm telling you, you have all sorts of new ideas. And when I come back, I'm gonna show people something they've never seen before. I'm telling you, I have figured some things out. I thought I had it all figured out.
Travis Bagent: My new training systems, I'm going to murder that light heavyweight class. I'm going to murder it. I'm going to murder every single athlete in that light heavy and heavyweight division. Legalize the Kings move. Legalize the Kings move. There is no such thing. It means that you get six fouls and out.
Travis Bagent: Just let us fight. Listen, if you're on a world level, a world level, number one, there is no fucking foul. There's no foul. There is foul.
Travis Bagent: Break it. Listen, listen, listen. Whenever he's winning, he never talks about that. Break it. This means that I'm losing weight. Break the fucking arm. Break the arm. It's not about the arm. I don't care about the arm break. If you got a world title shot, there is no fucking pass. There is no arm break.
Travis Bagent: don't kill engen please there's no better that man is fighting for his life right there in that bed and you got there shut up you know that will never never be allowed you know this is a betrayal to our master and get healthy soon and get healthy soon yeah that thing
Travis Bagent: I was waiting when nurse is just going to run into the room. What's going on? It's blood pressure going. Devin Hamlin, Engin invite David Tarabulli to East versus West sometime again. Super chat from there. Levan, you did not answer when Devin or someone who said that Devin versus, or maybe I ask, Irakli in 95 kilo. You said that
Travis Bagent: Yeah, we have to see the match, so looking forward to that. So you are confident he can beat Prudnik, but not Devon? Devon is a different level. Yeah, but whenever he's like 95 with his height, don't you think that he will be very weak?
Travis Bagent: Yeah, I don't think he will lose too much strength. He might even maybe get better technically, but he won't lose too much strength, I don't think.
Travis Bagent: Because we have a few questions. First question to Tornik, how difficult is it to translate between Georgian and English? Well, Joe, can you buy me a whole bunch of tight pants? Really, really tight pants. Really tight pants. Next time you go to Walmart, buy tight pants. 280 pounds. So whatever kilo, I don't know the kilo. 280?
Travis Bagent: How much do you plan to lose, Devin?
Travis Bagent: I don't even think about it. I don't even think about it. I don't plan on losing at the table ever. But in weight, probably, I don't know. I don't know. I'm not even going to think about it. I'm just going to get more ripped up, more like a bodybuilder, more shredded, working pecs, going to the gym, doing bench press. You're going to the gym? Artem you going to the gym? And every morning-
Engin Terzi: He goes to the gym now with Avery all the time. Every morning when I wake up, this is my son. This is my son. What kind of Zumba class do you do? I've been gone for a while. I was gone for a couple of years and I have a new baby. Nice time. Nice time. My grandfather was darker. Yeah.
Travis Bagent: I just went away for East versus West and I came back and now we have a new baby. I don't know. I don't know. Make it to everyone, boys. I can't go every time. Say hi to little Prudnik. Every day when I start training up for Irakli, every day I wake up and I wear a tighter pair of pants. And then once my pants are like fucking super tight, I know I'll be ready. I know.
Travis Bagent: Yeah, Irakli. I got to be able to beat him. If I can't beat him, I'm going to beat Samushia, okay? If I can't beat Irakli, I'm going fucking down to 85.
Travis Bagent: Is there a Georgian at 75 kilos? Is there a 75 kilo Georgian that I can beat? Why are you mad at Georgians? There's only 3 million Georgians. There's only 3 million. I have to be able to beat one. Just one. Just one Georgian. Super chat from Johnny B513. Engin, if they use King's move, they...
Travis Bagent: either lose the money for the match. How does that sound? If they use the Kings? No, he asked Engin. He didn't say Devon. It's Engin. Engin is me. Whenever they do that desperation move, that moment they get fouled. I promise as long as I run this organization,
Travis Bagent: that it will always be foul. The shoulder above is okay. Shoulder below is a foul. Like the way that he has competed in the times that he won the title, he didn't make a problem. Now he's losing weight, he's losing muscle, so he's just depending on this thing.
Travis Bagent: Let me say one thing that I've understood more than ever in my entire life over the last 24 hours. It is how important it is to cultivate both love and hate.
Travis Bagent: you must embrace the hatred you need to let these people speak you need to give them a place where they can hate do you know that the most the very most traveled the very most viral video in arm wrestling ever was a kingsman hang on but uh you show the call you show the comments but he's asking you something
Travis Bagent: 99.7 million views in less than 24 hours.
Travis Bagent: when you fought with the chase everyone was confused what the hell was happening you can do the same thing you can do the same thing
Travis Bagent: You can do the move. I can do the move. Break it. Break it. Break my fucking arm. Break it. Break it. I don't need a saint. I don't need a saint. I don't need a saint. I don't need a saint. Break the arm. Break the arm.
Travis Bagent: clown plays you don't need a problem break it people like to watch turkish some people like to watch turkish it's not east versus west everybody you can hit the streets and protest there i will
Travis Bagent: Super chat from Bane Prime. Greetings, everyone. Engin, hope you're recovering well. Devin, will you give Hermes a rematch sometime in the future? Hermes is too big. He's coming into his prime. I leave him alone. I got him when he was young. Now, Hermes is too good. I talk about Hermes. That one time with Hermes was great, right? It was good. No, no, it's not great, my friend.
Travis Bagent: We need another time. Legalize the Kings move. It's not Kings move. It's the shit move. It's the desperation move. That is for the people who are scared to harm us too. Chicken move. Yes. Yeah. Cheating.
Travis Bagent: No, it's not about letting the guy break. I wouldn't even be worried if the guy would break his arm. They fucking deserve it. I would worry about the other guy. You understand? Because he needs to go this shit. The arm doesn't open like this. And the guy needs to just...
Travis Bagent: I have never seen the guy who goes under the table getting hurt. The other guy is getting hurt. You understand? So I don't give a shit about the guy under the table because that guy doesn't have integrity to stand up and arm wrestle. That's all. Finished. In that video, it got 99.7 million views. I don't know. 99.7 million views. There may be some gay porn that has so many. We have integrity. We don't care about that thing.
Travis Bagent: okay john lewis says engen if the nurse says the only way for you to get better is to do the king's move would you do king's move no i would rather die i would rather die i'm a man on principle in hospital over here i'm screaming from probably the next stores will come here just tell this guy to stop talking about this move it's not going to matter soon soon this is going to be like fear
Travis Bagent: And I won't even need, I won't even need to worry about it. Right. I'll be in a King's move in the opening position. Just close. Just please. I'm a subject, you know, just. Take over. John Brzenk never used King's move.
Travis Bagent: See, I'm telling you. John Brissac never used King's Move. Yes, he does. I've seen him King's Move. No, never. Oh, yeah? I've seen him do it. No, no. I've seen him. I've personally witnessed him King's Move. Put the video. I've seen it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. King's Move all the time. No, no.
Travis Bagent: You got a lot of fucking nerves saying that about the fucking goat, man. Don't have to say that. I have seen him do it. I have seen John Kingsborough. Yeah, Devon, Devon, Devon. Get John on here. Devon, Devon, we have one week. Maybe on Halloween. Maybe on Halloween one time. Devon, we have one week to East versus West. Look what we are doing. Hey, East versus West 13. It's going to be incredible. Incredible. Yeah, yeah. I mean, yeah.
Engin Terzi: listen my big one what are your thoughts about uh we have sasha andrea coming down finding the the most amazing david samushi can david samushi do it one more time which is already like how many this will be the ninth title match right um i don't think i don't think so no this time no sasha was too much right
Travis Bagent: But if he beats Sasho, is he in a very special category in armwrestling? Yeah, for sure. He's already, he's already. He's already, yeah. This is probably the biggest... But Sasho, really Sasho is too strong on the hook. I don't think. And he has a lot of endurance. It's very difficult to beat.
Engin Terzi: Levan, you, you know, you know, David Samushia very well. Uh, you've been there for, you've seen all the matches, right? He's incredible. And you know, Sasho as well, right? You have seen the things that Sasho has done in European championship, world championships everywhere. Um, can David do it in your opinion?
Travis Bagent: He can win, but this will be a very tough and a long match. It will not be easy, but I think he can manage it. Tarus, you have some input on this one? Yeah, I mean, I guess, you know, there has to be some sort of
Travis Bagent: Hail Mary, trickeration, something has to change in what we've seen. Because what we've seen is other guys throwing Hail Marys and silver bullets and really getting close.
Travis Bagent: really getting close and him kind of, you know, there were even times where people were telling me those weren't close matches. Those were him trying to make the match entertaining. So now possibly we'll see a different guy. Maybe the guy we see now, he's throwing out the Hail Mary. He's false starting. He's double capping instead of
Travis Bagent: the guys doing it to him so that would be a way where he could get away but the cards are stacked against him not only has he had all those dominant well all those performances that that were that left you thinking that he was beatable just amazingly able to pull it out and then you know all the times in a row in a row in a row we all know how hard it is to stay strong
Travis Bagent: And then, to make it worse, a guy who just came off a loss is going to come down. The styles, the fact that it's probably going to go in the hook pretty soon, it all leads to the demise of Samushia. But you know what? That's why we're going to have the matches, because crazier things have happened. There are two things I want to say. One, you look like a bull.
Travis Bagent: And two, I follow when you are talking about the East versus West matches. Trust me, because of doing the commentary and you're following, you have been following those matches closely. And also, you know, honestly, your analyzes are just seriously fun to watch. I'm probably the baddest motherfucker in the world and I appreciate it. No, no, seriously, probably your best. I know.
Engin Terzi: No, look at me. Fucking Ron. Peace. Billy Bob says, Lemon, why are you ducking Brian Shaw? Rest in peace, Lemon. Yeah, now say something. Now you say. Say something about Brian Shaw. I'm not ducking anyone. Here I am.
Travis Bagent: Ask Levon if Bob Sapp almost broke his own arm. Artem wrestling, Levon. Very dangerous. No, no. I was very slow. I was careful. I wouldn't break his arm. No, no. He'd break his own arm. He'd break his own arm. Yeah. Oh, no.
Travis Bagent: Because Levan was holding, and the guy was pressing, and his shoulder was going before his head. Yeah, I want to ask Engin, please make a match with Brian Shaw. Brian Shaw is too early for you, Levan. Artem you joking me? Listen, Levan, you are just probably just, you are not taking all those talks seriously, right? You may take it, but three years later.
Travis Bagent: you never can tell listen listen maybe if this guy dedicated two years three years maybe he may be some difference as of now i mean you're joking me like i mean well i say i say we set it up and guys get big money i think we said i think ryan is ready he did training with devin devin knows exactly what's up
Engin Terzi: Brian is big enough to do what Devin wasn't able to do. I think let's set it up. What are you talking about? Yes, yes. In the next two months, I think he's ready. I read enough comments that said that Brian Shaw is ready. He is going to kill you. Be careful what you wish for. Please, Devin, promote the match. Make sure that everybody believes in Brian Shaw and I'm happy to do it.
Travis Bagent: Be careful what you wish for, Levon. Be careful. I think if Devon tries, he can make everybody believe that Earth is flat, so he can do that too. Okay, okay. One second, Levon.
Travis Bagent: based on what you said this is there any other experiences about this subject that they will make people believe i only speak the truth i only speak the truth
Travis Bagent: Yeah, he's very strong in this. So, all his career, he can influence other people in believing stuff. So, he's very good at it. Oh, he's good at mind games. Oh, stop it, Engin. Engin, stay, stay, stay relaxed, Engin. Stay relaxed. He made a lot of people to fall in love, you know, into arm wrestling.
Travis Bagent: uh spread the influence so we have to appreciate that you know we do we do yeah there is in all things a swing back and forth yeah his only weakness is that he loves kings move so that's that's the only one downside to him
Travis Bagent: Believe me, the West is tired of losing. We are tired of it. There is a crop that's growing. There are seeds all over the land in North America, and they're all coming.
Travis Bagent: Listen, if you want to keep your PAL style of arm wrestling over there in the East, that's not how we do it. That's not how we do it.
Travis Bagent: shoulder it's all legal
Travis Bagent: i will beat everybody you said east versus west is the best thing and now you're talking oh this is like a pal or something just to just to prove that that's the thing to be legal you are just now being inconsistent you know forget about that are you gonna beat levan
Travis Bagent: Now? No, not now. December. We see in the future. December. Yeah, who's next for Hermes? I can't tell who will be the next for him. We will see. Now I need to recover my shoulder after...
Travis Bagent: Oh, Jesus Christ. You get hurt in a phone booth. I feel pain here. Travis, Travis, this guy has the shoulder issue since the time that he stopped Levan, that since then he has the shoulder issues. Man, go watch my match with Richard Loftus. That ain't shit. Listen, Hermes was the one who was with the deadrest.
Travis Bagent: And the level was, was all over. I saw it. I saw it. I saw that match. I wasn't impressed with either one of them. There's a match that super is interesting to me. I don't want it, but there's a lot of money flying around about this match. A lot of money.
Travis Bagent: And it's with Hermes. He already knows. We've already talked about it. There's a match. I don't know Hermes. I don't fucking know. Really? What match? What match? Georgie Dezernoff. Ah, yes, my friend. Yes. Remember, eh? You promised. I don't joke, my friend. I don't joke. Wow. Wow.
Travis Bagent: Wow. For sure is very super strong, for sure. But stylistically is no problem. No problem. For me. Stylistically. Easy work. Stylistically easy work. Wow. Easy, my friend. Hey, that guy, that guy, did he win the Worlds after training for four months? Is that true?
Travis Bagent: I don't know. I heard that he won the WAF World Championships with four months of training. I can ask him, but I know that in 110 kilos, he beat Matsushenko right and left. I heard that was his first year, right? Year one? No, I have seen him before too. When did he fight with Arif Artem? Oh, it was in 2023.
Engin Terzi: So is that just a rumor? Yeah, I don't think that Zerano came and won the Loft Wars first time. Listen, Zerano in real life looked like non-human. He looked so big and insane. And I was expecting that Rebos will rise and he got everywhere. That was absolutely insane. And Rebos was big. He was like 170 kilos.
Engin Terzi: know as big as he comes so that's uh like like he went like now 130 whatever kilos so i think in your opinion yeah yeah we're friends i cannot say that about them that's that's for me that's a big question mark that's a big question mark
Travis Bagent: Remember, Revas versus Vitalii and Revas versus Zerano. And me with Arif and Zerano with Arif. Yeah, but it was just the very beginning. Doesn't count. No, I mean... So we need to set it up. We need to set it up and see for real. No, no, we want Hermes to...
Travis Bagent: remain a winner that's a problem we do need to we do need to handle almost his career a little bit better after that guy that guy is a problem it's a problem do you see do you see is that i know a threat against you like it would be a serious opponent for you
Travis Bagent: I don't think it's a bad idea. I don't think it's a bad idea. I don't think it's a bad idea. I don't think it's a bad idea. I don't think it's a bad idea. I don't think it's a bad idea.
Levan Saginashvili: I have not considered him as the opponent before. I have not even touched his hand. But looking at his latest matches, I think that he could be a good opponent for me. I think he had a trouble that he was a bit slow earlier.
Travis Bagent: But in the last matches, I think he resolved that problem. So now he's impressive. Yeah. I think he's one of the athletes who's in a very good shape at the given moment today. Levan, I have another question for you.
Travis Bagent: If you pull Hermes again for the title, that match, you already beat him and you have the title. But this match will, in my opinion, will not be only a title match. But also that is, I think, my opinion that it was a special meaning for you. And you will want to win this time more convincingly than the last time. Am I correct? No.
Travis Bagent: I would like to ask you, what is the most important thing about your life that you can remember from the title of this song? Because it was a very important song for you and you were able to write the title of the song in Revan. Well, we have a long history, just like Devon and I have a long history, so we have a long history and it is very interesting for me and for the audience as well.
Travis Bagent: Yeah, we have a story with the Hermes, just like we had a story with Devon. Uh, so I think this match is very interesting to me and it's very interesting for the fans also.
Levan Saginashvili: So, yeah, I have a big interest in pulling Hermes again. And it would be a very important match for me. Yeah, if he would beat Hermes again in the same exact way, would he be satisfied?
Engin Terzi: Yeah, the main thing is to beat him. Okay. I thought that... I mean, I'll take that all day. Britton Watkins sent a super chat. Lemon and Devin, please get together and train for a weekend. That's the content we want to see. Right-hand practice pulls and just a lot of content.
Travis Bagent: When are you, Devin, going to Georgia for some quality training? I feel like I have to live in Georgia. I feel like if I can just get a Georgian passport, maybe I won't need the Kings move anymore. Maybe. Maybe. Maybe you can convert him.
Travis Bagent: just need to go and like eat georgian food live in the mountains and do georgian things and i think everything would just work everything would work together yeah yeah do you think that travis can come back and become left-arm champion is it possible you think
Travis Bagent: No, no, it's a very serious challenge. It's a very serious challenge that we had to overcome. And that technique is not new. From the beginning, it's been a long time since I've seen it. It's been a long time since I've seen Dennis' style. It's a lot of technique, and it's been a long time since I've seen it. It's a long time since I've seen it.
Levan Saginashvili: Yeah, Travis has always been a technical puller. I think he can get back to his best shape and be dominant. If he was like a strength athlete, like Dennis, it would be tougher to come back. It's tougher to gain the strength back. But considering Travis' style and his technique ability, I think he has a good chance to be at the full power. Good fucking answer.
Travis Bagent: He cheated too much with Derek Smith. Hey, look, but you see, that's what Derek Smith did. He was like this, and then he was like this. How Derek can pull like this?
Travis Bagent: Just like Devin did to you. I told you, man. We don't fuck around. We do not fuck around. You go with him in the same school. I know, my friend. It's my school. I learned it from Travis. I got cheated one time, and that was all it took. Never again. Never again.
Travis Bagent: It's like, it's like a plague. It's like a sickness that goes through armrests. This high knuckle thing is a sickness. Same as Kingsborough. Once you get it one time, you're, you're done.
Travis Bagent: Come to the States or come to Canada. We will fully infect you, Hermes. We will fully. I will come. I will come. Come this summer. I'm serious. Come here. Live here. Eat with me. Train with me. I train hard. I'm training hard this summer. Come. Come stay. Come stay. Good times, Hermes. Very good. Yeah, yeah. They told me. Yeah, yeah. We can make for sure. For sure. Yeah.
Travis Bagent: Good. Good. Yeah. Yeah, you are all just planning something against me, right? Yes, of course. We have to do we have to fucking how it goes. Yeah, Travis to Travis, come up, dude. I'm not even allowed in Canada. I can't even Oh, that's right. That's right. Well,
Travis Bagent: What a fucked up country. I watched your guys' debates last night. You're in no position to talk. Holy shit. You're no better than we are. That's why. That was amazing. I was a robot running your country. How the fuck?
Travis Bagent: i can't speak though we can't we're way worse we're way worse okay we have a super chat from christopher robin from christopher robin devon can we get an update about brian shaw put a bit of fear in these guys on this podcast let me tell you brian shaw is bigger than you he's stronger than you
Travis Bagent: and he might even be more dedicated and smarter than you. No, he's talking about me. He's talking about me. I know you're not trying to say that big dummy. I'm going to tell you something. I'm going to tell you something. It's easy to recognize a champion.
Travis Bagent: it's so easy this guy is a champion through and through and he and i tell you in my prognosis he is coming i'm telling you he's i i believe he's coming and i'm gonna tell you it's a problem and you won't know it for a couple years but it is a problem it's a major problem for the super heavyweight division and it's coming who is coming who is coming
Travis Bagent: Brian Shaw. Rest in peace, LeVon. Rest in peace. Hey, what's going to be really bad is when I steal all the money, LeVon, and we do it in the U.S. I'll take all the money. I can invite all the strongmen to come to our wrestling. Everybody.
Engin Terzi: he's smart yeah yeah of course he's smart if he wasn't he wouldn't be such a big champion yeah yeah yeah but like my opinion he just has to be an armor so before we can even have him you know there's a lot of strong dudes that we have seen and there's a lot of insane people in arm wrestling right but to ascend where these guys have ascended it's
Travis Bagent: It takes lifetime dedication. Like all these guys have, it's a lifetime dedication. 20, 30 years. Levon is saying he will beat Brian with the Kings move. That's the only way you can do it. That's your only chance, Levon. Legalize the Kings move to protect the champion. I have been quiet there. I have been quiet there and the whole people on the chat now realize this.
Travis Bagent: who is the problem you know just i haven't been quiet here brian shaw comes in and beats the beats beats them we need to legalize the king's move yes just believe it but do you think that brian show will be someone similar to richard lapkus with the the
Levan Saginashvili: Yeah, you can collect signatures for a petition for a king's move.
Travis Bagent: It's already started. It's already started. I'm going to start a hashtag. I think of a good one. Break it. Break it. Yeah, maybe that's it. Let it break. Let it break. Let it break. Hashtag let it break. They can break their arms at home. Hashtag let it break. I won't be even sorry for anyone who's cheating more.
Travis Bagent: cheating is not allowed you are just opening he got this we got this hang and just relax stay in the hospital while you're just relaxing we'll slide it in nice and nice it is not the only thing that yeah
Travis Bagent: that it will be sliding under the table, but at the practice over here, they will just say, stop file, stop file, stop file, stop file, stop file, 40. And that's like straight out of the PAL textbook. Do you guys realize that? Do you guys know?
Travis Bagent: Many times I heard, many times I heard from you, be quiet, you said you had perfect rules. You said perfect rules. You told me this, perfect rules. Now you are like, yeah. Because you know what? Because I will tell you, you are not confident to win anymore because you're losing muscle. So you are saying that basically you will use your joints and go under the table. Just come on, man. If that's the case, go back to the super weight. Don't do this bad thing to the community again. Just please.
Travis Bagent: Do you have a favorite tree in your backyard? Just please, just this. Do you have a favorite tree? These kind of things, you know, just please. I'm just wondering, is there a tree that you just picked? Hermes, what do you think about this move? Just tell, honestly. I don't like. Is it even arm wrestling, Hermes? I don't know. I don't understand why. Your arm was 180 degrees, and then you are not winner. Listen, you opened the fucking arm to 180 degrees.
Travis Bagent: If there's nothing more to open, you are not even winning. No, for me, if the shoulder is up, it's okay. But if it's too much down, it's not good. Under the table. Levan, I have a question for you. Morozov or Laletin? And please don't open that subject again, please. Get better soon, Engen.
Levan Saginashvili: It's tough to say, very tough to say. What I know is that the Laletin will manage to take Morozov's wrist, but how it will continue after that, that I don't know.
Travis Bagent: If it goes into a lengthy endurance match, I think Morozov has a better chance there. Or either Laletin can do it quick and beat him right away.
Engin Terzi: I have some superchats. I'm going to read some superchats. Ashkat Singh Chima is writing, Levan is the champion of champions. Brandon Hernandez is sending prayers for speedy recovery, Engin. Turker Mehmetan, will we be able to see a match between Levan and Denis soon?
Engin Terzi: Well, Dennis needs to get, I think, his health first, and I think he's already scheduled to have a match versus Hermes before he will ever pull Levan, right? Sam Tiplenko says, a Strongman Challenger series would be epic for Hermes. Do you guys know what we need to do? We need to really find a good financeman.
Travis Bagent: And we need to make a movie with these guys. A new Armesty movie. No, I'm serious. We need to somehow do it. It doesn't have to be like over the top, but we need different subject. And we really, these guys really, Armesty is the character. It is like superheroes, you know. Seriously. Devon is another hero. Saving the world one pronator at a time.
Travis Bagent: somebody cut that part where engen says i'm a hero and send it to me on a loop okay just a loop listen if we make a movie devin devin is the villain he has the king's move and that's the whole plot of the movie we're trying to fight for the king's movie the king is taking over the world linkedin with the clip of me dropping down in the king's move devin is a hero devin is a hero that's what i want to see
Travis Bagent: Listen, I also just noticed, I'm thinking like there's a nurse that's holding Engin's camera all the time. Right now, during this time, if anyone comes in and tells me to be quiet, they will regret, so they better leave me alone. Yeah, anyway, so where is this Travis? Travis just escaped without even saying bye again. This guy, every time he does that, his payment is going like 25% lower, you know.
Travis Bagent: I tell you, he did look good. I'll tell you. Shoulder heads. Four arms. Four arms. And confidence. And confidence. Travis is usually nicer, right? He was. He looks good. It's going to be a good match. I love Sergey Kalinichenko. I think he's so cool.
Travis Bagent: I love it. We need to ask Levan. Levan, who is winning, Sergei or Travis? Kalinichenko to Travis. Kalinichenko to Travis. Is it the left one, right? Right, right, right. Kalinichenko to Travis. Yeah.
Travis Bagent: Since Travis is not here, I can say I think Kalinichenko. So every time you say something about the people who are on the podcast, you always say something to not upset them? Hello.
Levan Saginashvili: Yeah, Travis is a veteran legend. I don't want to upset him. But now he will watch this and he will be upset. Yeah, after he can watch it, yeah. But I didn't want him to upset him right here.
Travis Bagent: he will watch it go ahead you think sergey really beats him levon you think sergey wins
Travis Bagent: I don't think so. I don't think so either. Kalinichenko was very serious during the whole period. He was very serious. He was very serious. He was very serious. He was very serious. He was very serious. He was very serious.
Levan Saginashvili: Yeah, considering the... I'm not sure what shape Travis is in at the moment. It's really hard to tell, but I know that Kalinichenko is in good shape. He's training well. He's working hard. So, yeah, I have to say Kalinichenko on this one. Kalinichenko is a very good player.
Travis Bagent: Yeah, I started to appreciate Kalinichenko even more when he broke his finger but still managed to win. Yeah, huge respect for that. And what do you think about this, Ernest? I think Kalinichenko is very good to do a shoulder press. So you think he's going to lose his
Travis Bagent: For sure. Because Travis, he would cheat too much and it would be like this, he would take it for the wrist. I think the wrist is not very strong. Yeah, but even Jerry had a nightmare to pin Travis with that wrist.
Travis Bagent: I don't think Trevi is the same shape like when he fought... Yeah, but Kalinichenko was... That wrist pressure is nothing near to... But I think it's close. Oh, you think Sergi's shoulder press is close to Jerry? No, no, no. The match is close. Oh, match is close. Okay. But Devon thinks that Trevi is going to destroy Sergi.
Travis Bagent: I think it's still kind of close, but I think Travis will destroy him. I do. I think it'll be one, two, three. In the straps, in the second. One, two, three. I think Sergey's awesome. And if the match stops, I think Sergey can win. I just don't think it's going to stop. I think it's going to be one, two, three. Yeah, it's done. It's done.
Travis Bagent: He's good. He's really good. When Travis is good, he's really good. And I think he's on his way. I think he's really good. Do you have a suntan, Devin? A little bit. A little bit, yeah. I've been outside a little bit. I've been working. Yeah. A little bit. Almost Georgian looking. Almost Georgian. I could pass as Georgian, maybe. I went fishing...
Engin Terzi: Question for Hermes from Tommaso Tadlo. Doesn't low weight make him weaker? I don't know. Doesn't low weight make him weaker? I don't know. Maybe he's talking about Devin. What do you think? Is Devin weaker now because he's losing weight? He becomes weaker, but the opponents are not super overweight either now.
Travis Bagent: so for sure something but the pain because maybe you guys know what that is maybe the tendons the mask or more or less the same i don't think he lost a lot what is this you know what that is levon
Travis Bagent: that's work maybe maybe five percent less what happened have you finished stem cells this time the needle the needle big needle like this big
Engin Terzi: Who will win in a match between Devon and Vitalii? Big Vitalii is the worst opponent for Devon.
Travis Bagent: Come on, come on. What do you think? You say that after after what Vitalii did to you and then what I did to you and you picked Vitalii to win? Our match doesn't count, my friend. Why not? Why does it not count? Our match doesn't count. It doesn't count? Why? Okay, okay. Levan, our matches don't count. No, no.
Travis Bagent: Levan is saying that he thinks Devin can beat Vitalii. You know what he told to me, Levan, after your match with him? You know? Say it. He told me how I lost with you because he felt a completely different power. How is this possible? Completely different power.
Travis Bagent: Like 50% less. Really? If I was a coach when I fought with Lewandowski, I don't know if it was the same.
Travis Bagent: But this is the life. I guess we'll never know. I guess we'll never ever know. We'll just have to talk about it. Yeah. I know, my friend. This is the life. Hermes, but that is whenever two top roles are pulling against each other, it is more about this part here. Whenever you pull with
Travis Bagent: Levan, he took your wrist easily. So the same thing happened with Devin. The only thing, Levan was a little bit open and Devin was more connected with you and Devin had the shoulder pressure. But when Devin and Levan pulled, Devin's wrist position remained, you know, so Devin's wrist handled better against Levan. No, no, it's not about this because he told me he fed Pa. The arm power is different, arm power is different.
Travis Bagent: Different, but the round one, his wrist position when the match stopped was even a little better than Levan's wrist. Yeah, I know, I know. I know everything. So what I'm just saying that you lost against Levan. The future, I want to have a match. I want to have time to prepare. Mindset good. Good mindset and everything good we do.
Travis Bagent: Artem we crashing? Yeah, okay, that I understand, but it is better to say first match you were better, you won't, but next time I will crash you. Because if you didn't think that there was some ear problems, you wouldn't really crazy train
Travis Bagent: Yeah, but this is true. If I had more time to prepare this and everything for sure. Yes, but you had this problem not only in this match. You had the problem in Levan match as well.
Travis Bagent: Yeah, I know, but it was a good lesson when I lost with Devon, to train with these parts. But you sounded like if you were in the shape of Levon Mas, it would be different. No, no, I mean only mentally, because I had a match with Jari, but Devon said the same things. And when you are two matches very close, you are not very...
Travis Bagent: Also, you were training mostly for someone who is coming to you. And now it was the opposite way training. Yeah, so you would prepare three months differently. But what I'm just saying that whenever you pull Devon, in my honest opinion, he was stronger. Yeah, this is the reality when we fought together. Yeah. And the seat would...
Travis Bagent: So you are saying that Levan will beat Devin? I don't know, but for sure he will make some big trouble. Levan said that Devin would beat Levan. Ok, ok then Levan, who can beat Devin?
Travis Bagent: Only if he wins with him, for sure another guy will beat him, but it's not like this. Look at 75kg. Alonsole beat Makaro, Makaro beat Mindaugas, Mindaugas beat Daniel, Daniel beat Alonsole. They will maybe have more trouble with someone with longer leverage.
Travis Bagent: I would like to ask Levan. Levan, who has the biggest chance, if Devon would stay in the super heavyweight, who would have the biggest chance to beat Devon other than yourself? Ryan Shaw. Gennady. Gennady.
Levan Saginashvili: yeah georgia georgia yeah yeah yeah actually it would be interesting to see the ring match nice super chat question also here that that uh gasparini versus gennady would also be interesting okay who would win that match canada
Travis Bagent: I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
Levan Saginashvili: Yeah, it's really hard to tell. Considering that the previous match, Ermes won, he might have a slightly higher chance than Gennady, but it's really hard to say. And do you think that Zeranus has a chance against these guys? That Zeranus has a chance against you.
Travis Bagent: I think it depends on the situation. For example, it will be very interesting to talk to Mari Gasparini and Gennady.
Travis Bagent: Yes, it's been a long time since Reva's death, and I don't know what happened to him, but I think Reva's memory is very important. Yes, I think so too. In the period of his death, his memories are very important, and I think it's important to remember that he died.
Levan Saginashvili: Yeah, we have to test Ziranov with different opponents. Would that be with Ermes or Gennady? It would be really interesting to see. Yeah, I'm sure that Ziranov is very strong, but I think Rivas also did some mistakes in his preparation, in his weight, in the way he fought. But yeah, still I think that Ziranov was very impressive.
Travis Bagent: Yes, it's interesting. It's not a new thing, but it's interesting to see how the new sportsmen will react to it.
Levan Saginashvili: Yeah, and it's very interesting because it's good to see maybe not a new face, but a new newcomer into top level. And it would be really interesting to see Zoranovic against top athletes. Look at them now. You have Hermes, you have Kurdesha, you have Zoranovic, you have Gennady, you have Morozov.
Travis Bagent: You have Swetkov, it's just incredible. The top 10 is now really tough. Very tough and I can't wait to see how it will be shaped. And now we start with Morozov versus Laletin. One will be close to the title shot.
Travis Bagent: And the one will be getting far, you know, that he needs to prove more. Because after he lost, Laletin lost against Hermes, the only match he won was the Dave Chaffee match, right? And if he loses now to Morozov, then his chance for a number one spot will be, you know, far. He needs to win like three matches in a row or something after this.
Travis Bagent: and we will see we will see where kurdecha is where we will see where the other guys are and i think devon did a very smart move to pushing his weight up to 120 he's easy he's still 122 no need to really force himself that much because he's not really really super heavyweight in my opinion i mean because he just doesn't eat too much he just goes 150 naturally am i wrong
Travis Bagent: i eat everything i can and really like my whole career 245 to 250 i have to for me to get bigger than 250 i have to be crazy i gotta do crazy things and uh super heavyweight it's tough it's tough now oh my god the level is high it's high it's tough i'm gonna have a lot of fun at light heavyweight
Travis Bagent: Yeah, I would like to know if we can see Kurdeca versus Gasparini match this year. We will see. We will see. First, Kurdeca and Jerry match. That match is all. Levan, what do you think about this match? Consider this way. Listen, Levan.
Travis Bagent: Let me finish the question. We have seen Kurdesha, of course it was just like five years ago, losing against Ongarbev and Krasimir with that risk.
Travis Bagent: Do you think that there is a possibility, because Kudeche is more like going far with the muscle, not like super tight pressure. Do you think there is a possibility that stylistically Jerry will be bad for him? Or you think that his shape is so good and he will beat? Jerry, how do you see this match? No, I'm not sure. I don't know.
Travis Bagent: Actually, in this match, I'm sure that Jerry can win. The people underestimate Jerry too much, I think.
Levan Saginashvili: Yeah. Whenever I imagine this match between Jerry and Alex, every scenario I see Jerry wins. So it would be very surprising to me if Kudecha manages to pull and win that one. And it's very close, very close match. Yeah.
Travis Bagent: There will be a fight and I think Jerry will win in this fight. And Hermes, you say 50-50 match? Yes. Because the style of Kurdeca is you don't pull very close. With Jerry you need to pull more close.
Travis Bagent: or I wrong? Correct or not? Coach is correct or not? You need to be close and to go like inside. No, I don't think that he can do this. About his size and his leverage, you know.
Engin Terzi: So you are saying Kurdeca needs to go in or Jerry needs to go in? No, Kurdeca needs, he says, Kurdeca needs to be very close to fight efficiently versus Jerry. Like go in the hook, more or less. Yeah, just like over this tornator. Yeah. Listen, guys, we have a question. Can we get, because they're stacking up and versus Leonidas will pull John in next East versus West event. What you are thinking about that match? Can John
Travis Bagent: Uh, who, who is the favorite in your eyes? Leon? Leonidas? Or, or? No, I don't know if it's true that Leonidas has more biceps than Damkhlebi. Uh, I don't know. I think it depends on the person. Leonidas is a very good player. He plays very well. I think it depends on the person. I think it depends on the player.
Levan Saginashvili: Yeah, if Leonidas doesn't start training on the previous day in the gym, of course, Leonidas is very strong. There's no denying that. But I think John's experience is more, I think. And I think John is good.
Travis Bagent: Yeah, yeah. Shaw me too, Leonardo. Shaw the press. Crazy. Two, three hours training before the fight. Really, I love both athletes too much.
Travis Bagent: I think for arm power, I think Leonardo is more strong, but statistically, John has a lot more experience. 50-50, I don't know, really. He's very close.
Travis Bagent: it's just like i i talked about it i've talked about it a lot this match i i have leonidas is the favorite it's just i just don't understand how long can john pull at this level he's 60. he's is he 60.
Travis Bagent: 60 years old i mean come on come on this is a big problem like the big ask like to pull leonidas who is like this like leonidas is better better better better better he's getting more and more into arm wrestling he's training with the german guys he's training arm wrestling he's strong if the match stops there's going to become an endurance issue instantly
Travis Bagent: instantly as soon as leonidas starts to feel spots where he can tie up with john it's gonna be a problem john has to come in there and beat the piss out of him straight there can't be a hole for leonides to get into and and for john at this point in his career that's gonna be difficult that's a that's a lot that's a big ass to put him against leonidas i i have leonidas winning 3-1 i hope john wins
Travis Bagent: Devon, whenever a schoolboy trained with Irakli after his Leonidas match, after some weeks, and then whenever I see the difference between Irakli and schoolboy, and it is like a lighter version of Irakli, and whenever I remember John versus Irakli, I kind of think that we shouldn't underestimate John so much.
Travis Bagent: you can't underestimate john yeah we cannot yeah okay he's he's won over and over and over and over and over but at some point like he's 60. how how can you win this match i mean i think he was like i've been john yeah yes you know
Travis Bagent: Yeah. So what I am just saying that John lost against Krafty and Sasho. Both are very good arm wrestlers, very technical, very experienced. If John sees some inexperience, usually he finds that, you know, because I mean, the guy just, I mean, when I pull him, like whenever on the round two, I started good and everything. He thought that I was going to flash pin. I didn't have the side pressure. I couldn't even move.
Travis Bagent: Because he, I felt something like my hand control, pronator control, everything is very, very good. And whenever I pull, I thought that I was pulling against myself, but just someone who is bigger. You understand? I couldn't do a little bit more wrist. I would do, I would lose the pronator. A little bit more pronator, I would lose the wrist. It was just like, we were doing the same exact thing, you know, just then like the guy is so super coordinated. If he sees something like
Travis Bagent: all the experience, coordination, he will use it. He will use it, yeah. He has that move. He has it. Yeah. Yeah, he has it. Yeah, yeah. So, I mean, what do you think, Hermes? He said 50-50, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.
Travis Bagent: Guys, I got to go. I'm sorry. I got to go. I got to take my daughter to weigh-ins over in Quebec. Nationals, right? Nationals, yeah. Nationals this weekend. Canadian Nationals. Yeah, I got to get going. I love you guys. We'll see you next week. See you in Istanbul. Yes, we'll see you guys soon.
Engin Terzi: Yeah. Get better. Get better. Get better. Got to keep you healthy. Got to keep you healthy. It's good that Levin came back. So, Arun, our graphic designer, Levin, can you hold your doggy again before the stream ends? I want to take a screenshot of that, Geraldine. That's from our graphic designer, Solaron.
Engin Terzi: From Sam Tsikhrenko, speaking of awkward style matches, how do you guys think Vitalii and Kamel match was overall, Wild Press versus Topp Petro? Yeah, but this is the card, the weakest card of the year.
Travis Bagent: Not good this card. Left, no. You remember when I thought it was a right-handed point? Listen, whenever I say this card, the only thing I remember is how Devon was cheating on the game. Every time. All the time. I was right behind him.
Travis Bagent: He was front of me just changing the cards. And I said, you changed it? He's like, what? I said, it's from Tom. He could make you believe that you saw something else. That professional. You catch him. You catch him. You were looking at him, and he was still doing it. Yeah, he was doing it. And then he was trying to make me believe that I didn't see that. It was not real. Yeah. Engin, I need a new card. I need a new card. Look.
Travis Bagent: I do not have a belt. He has a belt. Yeah, but at the beginning, next match, next match, when you have, you will have the belt, you know. And listen, you have been representing that belt very good. Trust me, everywhere you go. And it is just, you are a true champion, my friend. It is great what you do. And then the way that people honor you in your country,
Travis Bagent: in the stadium, on the street, everywhere. You are just a great champion. I was thinking that we should find some financial power and then do a new armwrestling movie like they did in 1980s over the top. We need a new movie. It doesn't have to be the same scenario or something similar. But I think we will do something good, you know, just because I have some plans.
Travis Bagent: Yeah, it will be great. I want this generation, like in that movie, there was John Bersink, there was Cobra, there was some real Armistice. And then here we should do it just like you, maybe like, like maybe three people, four people, you, Devon and John and Prudy, but not, not Ernest. Right.
Travis Bagent: I'm just, I like to, I like to tease the guy. He's better than me. He's more an actor. Also, also me and Hermes, we will have our own comedy series. It's coming on Netflix next year. It's coming out. This guy, this guy is the only one that I can joke. And then I don't think that he would be upset with me. I said, this, I don't know, would beat him. I know he just left and then he doesn't get upset. He knows that I don't think bad about him.
Travis Bagent: And I don't think bad about anyone, but just some people, they don't know me very well. But I and Hermes, we talk countless hours on the phone all the time, and I cannot wait. So when are you coming back? July, right? December. Vegas.
Travis Bagent: Yeah, about Vegas, I will have to arrange the visa topic. I will have to take it again. That might be tough, but yeah, I will have to handle that. I don't understand that part. This guy is like a worldwide superstar.
Travis Bagent: a movie actor, a national hero, like has couple followers over a million on social media. And then not to give this guy a visa, I can't even imagine. Yeah, overall, it's a tough topic in Georgia. Yeah, it's a overall. Yeah, but he's an extraordinary person, you know, not a regular person, you know. Anyways.
Travis Bagent: I hope you do. I hope you do. And I think you will do, because I and Don, we already started talking about this. And then just that's going to happen, or happen, or happen. We're just going to make sure that we know. So it's decided 100% it's happening in Vegas? Yeah. No, no, no. About the Vegas location.
Travis Bagent: Not, but the US is, yes. The US side, the US side. Yeah, but the US is hoping to be, but it's not happening. Yeah. And what's the date? Like early, early, early December. Yeah.
Travis Bagent: Who will fight with Levan? Secrets. More for the server, more for Alessio Moro or for Kurdecia and Giari? It is more likely the winner of Di Serrano.
Travis Bagent: Let me bullshit something you just... When it will be public, the name of Levan's opponent? That's also secret, because if I say that, that will sound, you know... Yeah, different, but yes.
Travis Bagent: uh levan uh you will you will probably know before parliament knows i i will say 11's opponent according to chat will be alexander yeah and levan you said your opinion but i i was like like a little bit like out of
Travis Bagent: uh just my mind you know just sasha and samusha you see 50 50 much um
Travis Bagent: Yeah, I really hope that Samushia wins, but yeah, Sasho is definitely would be a toughest opponent for him stylistically. It means that 50-50 or Sasho is favorites? Yeah, yeah.
Travis Bagent: I wouldn't say that Samushia is favored, but yeah, maybe 52, 53% for Samushia. Oh, still Samushia slightly favors. Okay. Okay. And then Petro, Dadikyan, did you say about this one or I missed it? Petro was so impressive in his last match that...
Travis Bagent: I will have to say Petro for this one. David you know that Ungarbev had a surgery after the match because they took a piece of bone from his elbow that had been bothering him? I saw the bone. It wasn't a small hit. It was a... Okay, never mind. I'm not going to show, but did he know that? I don't know.
Travis Bagent: David he have an injury? It was bothering him? It had been bothering his elbow for some time. But after this match, he had surgery and removed a piece of bone. It wasn't so small. I think it was a broken piece in the elbow. Probably it was bothering him.
Travis Bagent: What kind of problem he had with this bone before? I mean, just imagine that there is like a small piece of loose bone, broken bone in your elbow. So I don't know what kind, but I wouldn't want to have such a bone in my elbow. It's moving like that. Anyway, so.
Engin Terzi: Anyway, so let's slowly finish. There's a super chat. Yeah, I'll read it from Dean Leviste. Thank you so much, Levan. You truly are the giant engine. Get well soon. All our prayers for your healthy recovery. Yeah. Thank you, everyone who has been wishing me the best.
