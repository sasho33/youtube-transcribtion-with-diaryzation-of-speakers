Derek Smith: Yo, yo, yo, yo. What's up, guys? What is up, YouTube? You guys, this is the fresh new podcast, Team West podcast. We couldn't think of anything creative. We're not that creative, me and Paul. But I'm here with the man himself, Mr. Paul Lynn, the legend, the white orc, as he's been named. I'm nobody, man. I'm not nobody. I'm just having a good time, loving what we're doing.
Derek Smith: yes right and uh my name is derek smith you guys don't know who i am my arm wrestle sometimes use a podcast sometimes um we are also normally we will be having chance sean here but he just realized late that he had somewhere he had something to do he double booked himself because it's a very chance thing to do but normally chance shot will be here but we have a special guest coming in that should be arriving shortly hopefully waiting for him to jump in the call which i think will definitely fill chance's shoes for the week for sure 100 not not lacking at all um
Paul Lynn: But yeah, we chance losing his job before he starts, man. I know. Right. Exactly. So, Paul, why did we start this podcast? I think, you know, in the past we've done like
Paul Lynn: Rob Bidgett and Doug Ehrlich and I did something kind of similar. I think, you know, with East versus West, as far as like that, I mean, that's the name of the promotion. And, you know, as we all know very well, sometimes it doesn't always go well for the West.
Paul Lynn: you know so a little uh a little positive energy behind team west and a little bit more voices heard um and an opportunity to just keep everybody abreast on everything that's going on with the sport right now uh especially at the at the larger promotions right yeah i mean maybe you know like we don't need any interpreters on this one you know just so you just keep it flowing freely you know
Paul Lynn: yeah absolutely man and like like we'll cover some stuff here we kind of have a pseudo agenda so like some stuff we want to go over obviously we have such a huge summer uh worth of arm wrestling coming up um but you know i'd love like envision this podcast moving forward to be just three or four of us at a time uh just talking trash and seeing where it goes all right here we go it looks like the man himself joined i don't see his picture but maybe it'll pop up here oh
Derek Smith: Uh-oh. Uh-oh, Wi-Fi. Wi-Fi issues in Alabama. Got some Wi-Fi issues from Alabama. Oh, there he is. Yeah. Roll Tide. Roll Tide. But yeah, today, guys, we're going to cover a bunch of different topics. We're going to talk about East vs. West coming up on July 6th out in Istanbul. We're going to talk about the Challenger Series going on on June 15th out in Florida.
Derek Smith: And then just a myriad of different things that are going on in the arm wrestling world as of late. Justin, what is up with your... Well, guys, we kind of have the Bama Bull himself here. A little bit of technical difficulties. Looks like he's trying to connect, though. We're trying to get him in here. Come on, dog. Get that Wi-Fi booster, Bama.
Derek Smith: All right. Yeah. But, uh, as justice connecting, definitely want to take this chance, uh, to remind you guys, um, to look, uh, the pay-per-views are coming. Make sure you guys are following that closely, uh, East versus West and all the deals that they're coming out with, uh, with the VIP stuff and, uh, in the different opportunities that are available to you out there. Um,
Derek Smith: this will be on we'll host this on the east first west channel probably pretty exclusively for now we don't have any other plans right now to move it but we'll keep you guys updated if this podcast gets moved or something like that or anything kicks us off the channel or something uh well you guys know um i don't know man just you know direct connect that phone to the router or something man i don't know what to put that put that thing on cellular run your bill up dog
Paul Lynn: he's coming back he's coming back away from the comeback um so kind of get things rolling a little bit we'll bring justin as he is able to reconnect um what do you want to get into first you want to get into the challenger series first you want to go into easter's west uh 13. we got king of the table coming up okay just some quick stuff there um i finished my last practice so we are like on the doorstep of that thing
Paul Lynn: So that's coming up here June 1st. A ton of amazing matches. If you follow the podcast, they've been broken down to the end of the week. So definitely excited about that, ready to pull Lachlan, and I'm ready to see some of those awesome matches we've got on there, especially Morozov and Ivan. I think that's a cool match, and I think it's going to wind up being a screamer, I think. I think it's going inside, and it could be a grinder.
Derek Smith: Oh, yeah. Well, Morissette does have the capability of top rolling, but left-handed, he's kind of versatile. He can do both. He can. Yeah. Yvonne gets his hook, though, like nobody else. The guy's so efficient. It's admirable.
Paul Lynn: but yeah make sure make sure you guys tune in for that um and then we can get into some of the other stuff that we got coming up here too because there's been some loose information put out about like you know obviously we know east versus west 13 is coming on we could take a look through that card we got the challenger series coming up which is huge which is a real precursor and kind of like a trial run for the oldest event which is 14.
Paul Lynn: So a lot of riding on that Challenger series and how that production quality goes and leading us into 14. So super, super exciting.
Paul Lynn: Super excited about this. A little nervous. You know, my OCD comes into play like I'm rooting. I hope everything goes perfect for the Challenger series. I hope you guys kill it down there. I wish I could join you. Chance chance hit me up the other day. So any chance you can make it down? I'm like, I don't know if there's probably no chance without me remaining like if I intend on remaining married. So I don't think I can do it. It's so much time that I get traveling. Yeah, I got you.
Paul Lynn: Yeah, the king of the table, completely spaced, dude. You got a match right there. I'm all talking about the other ones. Yeah, you got a match coming up. How are you feeling? How are things? I'm good, man. I feel good. Overall, health is good. Sitting at about 228 right now. Hopefully, I can make a couple more pounds on during the
Paul Lynn: during the taper phase and everything. It's going to be uncharted territory for me going into a match of this caliber without having to cut weight, being able to kind of relax and fly and eat and do all this stuff. So I'm not going to know what to do with myself. I have not yet competed without having some form of a weight cut along with that travel. So I'm looking forward to that aspect. I feel good.
Paul Lynn: no excuses you know i think there's a lot of variables around the match i've said it in another podcast but a lot of it's going to have to do with you know did i get stronger with gaining weight did lachlan lose any power uh making his slow cut to a walk around 232 uh there's a lot of a lot of things at play uh but we know in lachlan his professionality
Paul Lynn: I can't imagine he does everything right the guy is like a machine you know he's incredibly disciplined he's incredibly focused structured um so I I expect nothing but his absolute best but hopefully we put on a good show one way or another well you'll feel fed that should feel good going to a match just feeling fed and just remember like I don't know I don't I don't know what it feels like to cut weight man I've never cut a pound in my life or an arm wrestling match
Derek Smith: yeah if you don't gotta do it don't do it yeah people ask me for advice sometimes too I'm like cutting weight I'm like I thought I've written books I'm like I've talked to some guys about it I've never done it but yeah you can always send those guys my way I get I get probably a message every other day about it oh I bet you got you do big cuts man what uh what was that one last Easter Swiss I saw you at you cut big for that one didn't you
Paul Lynn: For the most part, it's usually pretty standard. I'm usually coming down from a walk around 220, 225, and making it 95. Now, obviously, every cut's a little different. There's always variables and stuff at play, and you don't always feel exactly the same. You try and replicate it exactly the same, but I usually focus on what do I recover back to, and if I can bounce back to a 223, 224, I'm usually in pretty good shape.
Paul Lynn: So the Hermes and Dennis match got canceled, right? And then that one was replaced with Camille and Vitalii? I think so, right? That's the recent talk. I listened to a bunch of podcasts last night, and that's what I'm looking at. And I think that's weird, man. That's a weird one. Because if you listen to Hanging and Devin talk about that match, I think Camille is such a wild card.
Justin Bishop: he's a guy who's i don't think going to beat everybody it like anytime soon there's justin there he is can you hear us can y'all hear me yeah yeah there you go i had to go download the app and it worked much oh you did it yeah you couldn't do it through chrome i could see myself but i couldn't hear or see anybody else gotcha gotcha right the band of bull himself joins us all fully connected now look at all east first west they did it out
Justin Bishop: Thank you for joining us, Justin. Thanks for hopping on here. Hopefully we can have you as a regular on the show. Anytime, bro. How are you doing? How's your training been going? Pretty good. I've been staying pretty active. It's been a while since I've been this active. What's your weight right now? Like 79, 80 kilos, 178-ish. Pretty light. Yeah.
Paul Lynn: What's coming up next for you? What are you working on? Am I allowed to say anything? Oh, secret stuff. Oh, gotcha. All I can say is I was catching up on a podcast the other day and
Paul Lynn: Angan called a certain someone live and said on the podcast, hey, you guys, it was the Max Yashinko and Alijan Muratov, that live. And he said, I'm going to try and set a maximum on this live feed. So I don't know if it's slipped in or not. I don't know if it's officially put out there yet or not. Dude, Angan always gets so excited. He always ruins the surprises, man. He can't keep that stuff in. He lets it out.
Derek Smith: Well, I know both parties agreed, so that's, you know, as long as everything else is good. Potentially, you might be flying overseas at some point and not too far. Is that for 13 or 14? 14. Okay. I'll just go to, you know, go a little further south. Gotcha. That's going to be a fun show, too, man. Ugh.
Justin Bishop: so much stuff coming up and it's hard to even cover everything. So in that, in that vein, in that vein, Justin, how much of an impact do you think, uh, the role reversal of travel, how much of an impact would that add? I think it's certainly going to have impact on the guys who have never been here for sure. You know, flown that far. Um, because from what I've seen, they don't have to fly too far to any event over there. Um,
Justin Bishop: Yeah, it definitely makes an impact with me. I mean, even though I've done it so many times, especially if you've got to cut weight, you know, it's – the time difference was always the biggest thing for me. When I went the first time, I tried to get on their schedule. It didn't really work. The second time, I just was like, I'm going to stay on my schedule because we're going to pull at 8 at night anyway. And it didn't really work, so –
Paul Lynn: You know, it didn't work when I went to Australia either. I mean, I was there eight days and it seemed like it got worse every day. Yeah, it's a real thing. I mean, I try to like pride myself on being able to be comfortable with it, at least mentally or accepting it mentally. But like really look at it from an objective perspective.
Paul Lynn: You're eight to nine hours off your time, your normal time zone. Your sleep schedule flips upside down. If you're doing a weight cut, it's an extra challenge. I don't usually actually sleep a full night until after I've cut the weight.
Paul Lynn: usually the day before competition, after being there four days. So that definitely has to have an effect. Like I said, I try to pride myself on being able to still perform after all that. But that said, I think it's a real thing. And we can date back to the WAL days, and a lot of people were calling that out then when guys were coming over to the United States and pulling WAL. I don't know if it's true, but it seemed like it was.
Justin Bishop: I mean, a few of them did real well. You know, Giannis was an exception. I thought Tom did decent. But, yeah, other guys, maybe Joseph. But there weren't too many that did, you know, seemed like they did as well as they could have if you had it back east. Right.
Derek Smith: I remember my first time I went to Malaysia in 2015, my first time flying far for arm wrestling. That was the craziest sleep experience. You're feeling okay. I'm going to take a little nap. All of a sudden, seven hours later, you wake up. What just happened? You're drooling and stuff. Then you can't go back to sleep. Then you're up all through the night. It affected me for a few trips. Finally, I think I started picking people's brains. Todd Hutchings. I was like, guys, I've done it a lot. How do you do it? The number one thing is right when I land, I'm on their time schedule.
Derek Smith: I'm like our match, say our match is going to be at, you know, 10 o'clock at night, their time. Okay. Midnight, their time. I'm going to sleep from now on the rest of the week, the whole week I will go to sleep and I will not take any naps and I will go to sleep at that time, but I don't cut weight. So I'm also hydrating and eating and like doing all that, you know, so that's a little different than you guys. But like, that's, that's been the biggest change where I started doing that and sticking to it. No matter how tired I feel, I don't go to sleep until midnight and then force that sleep schedule. And if I have to take things to help me sleep, I was doing that. But like, that's something that's helped me a lot. It made me feel a lot better.
Derek Smith: always feel bad for the guys that are new to the travel like i saw um the one the one where i won that that he's possessed uh the younger guy um the only guy that lost the only american that lost on our card yeah dustin hi i remember the rules meeting i'm looking over dustin he's falling asleep in the rules meeting he's just counting my dust and dude he's like it's killing me bro i'm like oh man
Paul Lynn: That's such a factor, too. We're doing a qualifier series and everything. I talked about this with other guys. It's a beautiful thing because we have these mega-talented guys over here. We lost audio, Paul. Can you hear me? David you lose me? Artem just called me. Now my audio is off. He's texting me. I hear you.
Derek Smith: Can you hear me now? We hear you, Paul. Yeah, we hear you. Jesus, I can't hear. Oh, he can't hear us. I'll be right back. All right. Artem's ruining everything. Yeah. I was trying to find out if the match was cool to make public or not. Yeah. I had something, too. I wanted to say make public today. I got a nice chance if I can say it. Some stuff happened, and I wanted to announce it today on the podcast. Yeah.
Derek Smith: But, man, that beard is looking. It's getting there, my guy. Yeah. My wife's about ready for me to shave it. But I told her, as soon as it gets long enough where I can braid it. Hey, are you going to do it? Artem you going to put, like, a Viking braid down the middle or something? Yeah. Yeah, that'd be pretty cool. Oh, Paul left. I forgot. Okay. Well, I guess when Paul gets back, we'll dive into King the Table a little bit, kind of do, like, a once-over on –
Paul Lynn: We can be like a once over on the king of table matches, just our quick thoughts on it. And then do you want to do that, Paul? Do you want to go over all the matches in the cards or just talking about maybe some of the ones that we're looking forward to the most? Let me finish my thought. Let me finish my thought. Oh, okay. We were talking about some of the newer guys coming in and dealing with that travel. We were talking about that travel. And I've had talks with Angin about it, especially with the qualifiers. You've got these mega talented dudes and stuff.
Paul Lynn: but it's it's you you're getting so thrown to the wolves in a way if you've never done it before you know and like having some of those guys come over try my best to be encouraging and try and like give them as much information about the process because i know the first time you do it is tricky you know and i think if you're not in the right mind state you don't handle that well it will affect the
Paul Lynn: And I've like said that to Angan too, that like, you know, like, like some of these ladies and gentlemen that are coming over for the first time, like we got to give them a little bit of grace on their performance, depending on how that goes for them.
Paul Lynn: And the flip side of that coin, guys like Justin, who have already done that in there, those are kind of the tried and true guys that you know already have that experience. So it's like a two-sided coin with that. I think it's tricky. And that's why I'm so excited about the idea of us being able to compete potentially. If things go well in August,
Paul Lynn: I think we're going to see more of these things in the United States. Maybe it's not 50-50, but any additional ones per year is a huge bonus.
Derek Smith: Right. Well, I mean, Ingen, once again, let it slip. But I've been talking with Brian Shaw. A lot of guys know I helped host the Brian Shaw arm wrestling thing. And I was like, well, I wonder if I can bring those together. So this year, it's literally the Shaw Classic is a week after the East vs. West match. So it couldn't happen this year. But we might try to have some East vs. West affiliated matches, like two of them. But next year, we want to try to set up hopefully a full card, East vs. West card at the Shaw Classic. What would be the goal?
Paul Lynn: That would be amazing. Yeah. There's already 15,000 people walking around there, like Strongman fans, and then they'll get a bunch of arm wrestling fans there and hopefully convert some of the Strongman fans over to our process. So, hey, so, Justin, back to your match. I know we don't know who it's with or whatever, but what weight class is it going to be? Is there a catch? Is there a weight? He said 77 kilos, so 172. 72. Okay. And what are you now?
Justin Bishop: Uh, this morning I was like 174. Wow. You know, I haven't been doing a lot of traditional training, you know? Uh, so I usually do that, stay above like 85 or 90. So I'm kind of went back to my grassroots training where it's a whole lot of hand and wrist and, uh, a whole lot of arm wrestling. You know, I've been, uh, practicing twice a week, uh, since about the 1st of February.
Justin Bishop: I took that little break for the round robin and got right back at it. As long as you're pulling pretty smart, have a structured practice, it's not terrible. Right. So you're holding up well physically with it? No elbow problems, none? Not really. It kind of hurts today because I've been doing a lot of demo.
Justin Bishop: You know, snatching sheetrock out and, you know, snatching stuff, you hyper-extend it a little bit, make it sore. But, no, I mean, my hand feels as good as it's felt in years. My left shoulder is kind of a little bit jacked up from the round robin. I felt good after the round robin, so I was like, I'll pull the tournament four and a half hours later, you know.
Justin Bishop: I had the first match, and I could tell when I slipped. I was like, ah, I shouldn't have done this, you know? But then waited too long, got cooled off, and, you know, yeah, after the second match, I just laid down. And because it's never really been, I would say, 100% since I pulled Paul in 2016, and he snatched me over. But, you know, I don't know. I just keep going.
Derek Smith: i've gripped up with you one time just like an action pull i've never felt a light guy with such a super heavyweight wrist like ever like that it's always i'll never forget it i was just like the hand wrist felt like i was attached to a 400 pound dude it was tripping me out i've seen someone so light across the hill i'll never forget this i'm excited to keep training like i'm training because i feel i feel almost as strong as i do at like 190.
Justin Bishop: but I'm, you know, 15 pounds lighter. So, you know, and I felt some of the guys after the round robin, which they were, a lot of them were tired, but they still wanted to harm us. Really, you know, I didn't, they didn't really have a lot for me. And, you know, I got some guys coming up this weekend.
Justin Bishop: Artem's supposed to come, Terry Preston's coming, and a couple super heavies that don't ever come to our practice coming. So, you know, I took last week off of practice, so I'd be a little bit fresh, because I won't lie to you, doing that two times a week, you know, guys will show up who you normally don't have a problem with, and all of a sudden they drag you across the table. Yeah. Mess with you mentally a little bit, and so...
Justin Bishop: But, you know, I just did that round robin not too long ago and I took about two and a half, three weeks off, which I was iffy about because it's a small window for me. I think in the years past, I've overtrained in the gym and took too much time off of the table. Like I'd take like four or five weeks off and then, you know, I'd only take like three days out of the gym.
Justin Bishop: And for that round robin, I only took about two and a half, three weeks off the table, and I took a full week off at the gym, and I didn't ever feel tired. I didn't feel really like I was getting blown up in the setup, you know, so I think that's the ticket right now. Taking a break, get back into it. It's always rough, man.
Derek Smith: like getting everything working again and stuff and feeling good. But once it gets there, I feel like you catch back up quick because your body remembers how to do it, you know, all the muscle memory and everything. So it comes back on pretty fast in my experience.
Derek Smith: um the chat i've been kind of keeping an eye on the chat guys hasn't been too many questions for us a lot of people trying to ask who your match is but obviously guys we already said he can't really announce anything yet so it's kind of pointless to talk about that i hadn't asked i was just assuming they would announce it first i can ask real quick uh somebody in here asked if you guys think that the rock league can beat prudnik what do you guys think man it depends on the weight i think
Paul Lynn: I think Prudnik at 95, I might take Irakli. I think Prudnik at 105, I might take Prudnik. But we're talking about right hand, and I think Prudnik's right is still on demand. I think he was banged up. So there's some variables around that. I think if they're both prime, and let's say it was a catch weight at 100.
Paul Lynn: man, it's hard to counter Rackley out right now. But if there's somebody who, you know, at that weight can match his top role, it's probably, it's probably. But I don't know. I'm not, that's, that's so tough to pick right now. But I tell you at this juncture, it's hard for me to bet against Rackley. Right. Yeah. He's looking, he's still leveling up, man. How old is he? He's pretty young, right? Oh, he's real young. He might be like 25, 24. Yeah. Somewhere. He's several years younger than I am. Yeah. He's,
Derek Smith: We're me and him about the same age, I think, so that's crazy. Becoming the old guy. Okay, so on this King of the Table card, we got Matschenko and Morozov, Michael Todd and Lars, Ongarbaev and Petro, Ravaz and Georgi Zarenov, you and Lachlan, Schoolboy and Bowen, and then Vitalii and Camille.
Derek Smith: Besides your match, obviously, Paul, which one of these are you guys most excited to see? Well, I mean, I think...
Paul Lynn: I told you I like the Morozov-Matushenko one. Yeah. And I don't think a lot of people agree with me that that's the best match on the card. Obviously, I want to see Michael Todd and Lars because of the stylistic clash there. I think we can see arm wrestling all over the table. I think we can see flash pins. I think we can see boards. I think we can see inside, outside. It could be anything. But I'm most interested now in the announcement of Camille and...
Paul Lynn: And, um, without, because, and you know, like Devin, Devin and hanging broke it down real well. And I tend to believe I like, I think Camille can be one, two, maybe three of the top guys, the top five guys. But I don't know if Camille style allows him to be all of them. And the question is, you know, like we're, we're talking about in order to be Camille, you gotta be able to grab them low, meet them in the middle.
Paul Lynn: I don't know if Vitalii can do that. And his lever length against Camille goes from an advantage against everyone else into a disadvantage against Camille. So this is real interesting because I think a lot of people, a lot of people believe Vitalii is the best, the best left hand, number one dude in the world. He just he just doesn't have that title that Marzoff has.
Paul Lynn: So Morozov's the man, but there's a lot of people out there thinking that Vitalii is the rightful owner. The question is, if Vitalii somehow loses to Camille, what does that do to his chances of getting a match with Morozov? It's kind of a weird match, because it's a replacement match.
Paul Lynn: Like as a promoter, I don't know if I would have loved setting this match in this order, you know? Right. So I think it's real interesting that it could throw everything off. You know, it could really shake things up and make that next, you know, title shot guy be it could be it could be really weird.
Derek Smith: yeah i mean because people want to see jerry and vitale forever just because the contrast in styles like how does that go up jerry's gonna go in like what's gonna happen will vitale get him outside his shoulder or will jerry bury that thing and totally can't move you know i mean that's always the question um and this is essentially i mean not the same thing but kind of the same thing right it's just like a younger jerry you know like there's there's there's you know i think
Paul Lynn: There's some people out there saying that Camille's press might be better than Jerry's. And not necessarily on the right arm, but like equivalently speaking on the left. It might be as dominant, if not more dominant. And I think the thing that separates Camille is he's not a complete one-trick pony. You know, he can pull in a traditional hook. It's not his favorite thing. But he can shoulder roll, he can flop, and he has a solid top roll. So you don't necessarily know what you're going to get.
Derek Smith: And I think that makes him even more dangerous. Well, let me throw a little bit of shade at Camille right now because that knuckles up thing, he said, I got some other moves planned in that round one. He tried some other moves and they went nowhere. Here comes the flop for us. But he tried something to his credit. He tried something different. Osunov is damn good and people don't know it. That guy's a monster. So he probably got shut down and said, no, back to the bread and butter. Yeah, exactly.
Derek Smith: Yeah, I think all things considered, I'm probably Machochenko and Morozov probably the match I'm most interested in as well. I mean, the other ones are interesting styles. I'm happy to see Rivas back on the card and see him out competing again. I think he had so much potential. He was like right there, right there with Vitalii, even though I know it didn't go his way, but like everything was so close, you know, and he was still supposed to be on the comeback, essentially. He'd gone for that many years, still kind of gaining, getting back into it.
Derek Smith: So I'm excited to see Ravaz on the card and Zarenov's an absolute unit. Zarenov is like, that dude's jacked and strong as hell. So I think Ravaz will be too much for him. I think he's just too big and will be too much. But I mean, Zarenov might be able to pull that off for sure.
Paul Lynn: The thing is, when Zoranoff stops a match, you know, like, things are, like, when he gets a stop, you're going to see a war. He's been so consistent with that since he started. He doesn't get a whole lot of credit. I think he deserves a little bit more. Justin, what do you like on the King of the Table card? What match do you like? And when are we going to see some lighter weight dudes on King of the Table? Have we even seen one other than, like, The Whisperer? Like,
Derek Smith: i don't know i'm i'm trying to iraq iraqis had matches right yeah but that's that's 95 and but those were all at 105. so i don't think have we ever seen an 85. well to me you are like oh i don't know that's to me everybody's light out here now we always you know the lighter guys always get uh you know the shorter end of the stick
Justin Bishop: or whatever you know unless they're very charismatic and can sell tickets you know or already got a big following you know but um i mean i'd be i've never been to dubai let's go all right hey it's great up there man you love it no i mean from what i was seeing was uh the one we were just talking about and then uh the artem
Justin Bishop: I don't want to butcher his last name. Morozov? Yeah, Morozov. There you go. To me, because I'm a big fan of that guy, you know. He's so young, already up here. You know, if he can stay healthy, maybe not be as active as he was in the past. I think that was one of the issues, you know, because just like MMA, man, you know, you got to have a space in between there, especially with the heavyweight dudes, you know. Yeah.
Justin Bishop: They're doing the same thing we're doing, except all their stuff's larger, you know, so it takes more time to heal. So, you know, you can't pull that many a year, but it seems like he's getting back. Looks like a tank. You think it's going to end up in a hook? You think Yvonne will set that hook, or you think Morozov will try to roll out? I think Morozov's definitely going to try to roll out. The question is, can he? But we know he can pull in a hook, too, you know? There's a big difference from shooting a...
Derek Smith: top role and getting sucked in and going in you know so people i think a lot of people underestimate how big ivan machchenko is like if you stand next to that dude he's like six four six five he's a big dude and that and there was there was a time where they were talking about me arm wrestling and left hand didn't like because you know that's me i just that's the matches i get offered
Derek Smith: and uh and so i'm watching tape on him and i'm like just like how what would be the key and like he he at some point him and batali had a crazy war at some point where you kind of put the brakes on batali and everything but he's so long and he shoots up to that corner of that pad and like i know with my length i'm good at i can get to a hook now i can't always win in that hook but i can pretty much get to a hook with most most people and uh so i understand the kind of the angles and uh that i think that is underestimated on him you think he's just like cupping people into that length and him shooting across that table like
Paul Lynn: Getting away from that is rough, real rough. The guys who can go from go to here at you and still be strong are the guys that are much harder to top roll. It's not necessarily the guys with the best cut. Yeah, that's what it takes, I think, to be able to hook at that highest level is you have to combine a little bit of shoulder forward with your wrist flexion because against these elite guys, the back pressure is such a dominant weapon.
Paul Lynn: that like you it is impossible against these elite guys to cut them down to you you know so it makes it tricky he's coming back again all right i don't know what happened i teleported i didn't even move um real quick who wins boner schoolboy what do you guys think uh
Paul Lynn: I mean, after the Leonidas, the Leonidas match shook everything up, right? If he beats Leonidas, walks right through him, somehow he probably could have walked away with that match and Bowen still could have been next, you know? Like, I think there was maybe chatter about that as being a follow-up match, no matter what, like that might've already been talked about or might've already been like, like word of mouth confirmed, you know?
Paul Lynn: Now, prior to that, a lot of people would have probably seen Bowen as a more legitimate opponent. But now that Leonidas beat him, I personally don't think that that knocks Schoolboy's stock down. I just think it boosts Leonidas. But the question is, yeah, you're right. You're right. The reason if I was to knock the stock down,
Paul Lynn: it would have been because i physically saw how big schoolboy was and when i seen this guy in the airport and i was like like i double triple take and then i walked up to him and said hi you know like i wasn't sure it was him that's how big he was and after seeing him and being around him it's like not even the same dude i remember so like i was like leonidas has no chance and then after leonidas beating him like
Paul Lynn: Yeah, he's the real deal. And I got to pull with Leonidas a little bit. I thought his left was definitely better than his right. But if he's focused on his right now, who knows what kind of gap he could have covered by then. But I still give schoolboy the advantage because of sheer stature and the fact that he's put so much muscle and everything on. And I'm just not sure that Ryan can get into his hand and wrist early enough.
Paul Lynn: to create problems but i know i know ryan is he's been very open about what he plans on doing in this match so probably gonna see an open topple slash king move um but the fact that the fact that uh that alex knows that's coming i would think he would be able to to plan around that i think uh you know all ryan's got to do is get one good stop you know but i think the length and the top roll ability of schoolboy
Justin Bishop: you know, and him coming off a loss, you know, there's nothing scarier than a man coming off a loss, you know, uh, especially when, when you're supposed to win, you know, question everything. Uh, but, and, you know, and to Leonidas's credit, I thought he pulled much smarter than most people at his, his, you know, his level. He didn't make any adjustments that I could tell, but, you know, he was strong enough to hang in there. And, uh,
Paul Lynn: To my surprise, he had the stamina. That's why I figured he was going to fail. Right. You know, but he clearly had more than a schoolboy. Yeah. Yeah, that's with all that lean muscle, too. You know, normally guys walking around at 8%, 7% body fat blow up quick, you know. Yeah.
Derek Smith: real quick jumping into the chat I'm trying to keep an eye on the chat guys if you guys follow my channel at all you know I'm pretty involved with the chat so I'm keeping an eye on it at all times um the uh someone AJ has a question says uh what is your opinion on Reichard Bornman should he get invited to East First West anytime soon so that's that like uh I'm still learning about him that's the younger kid in Australia right that's just dusting everybody there's just like absolute unit
Paul Lynn: uh like a rugby player right give me the arm wrestling but like do you play rugby yeah play rugby for real yeah out there running around yeah he's he I guess he's he's originally from South Africa and he's in Australia to to play rugby oh okay and I think it's at a professional level I'm not 100 sure so he's gonna choose arm wrestling over rugby
Paul Lynn: Well, I guess what he said was he had some form of injury or something that he had to take maybe a season off of rugby, in which time he started focusing on arm wrestling, started smacking everybody.
Paul Lynn: But I think he's one of these guys. I think he's very similar in stature to, like, schoolboy. Like, I think measurements are very, very similar. He's a young guy, but he's a beast. He's, like, all inside, right? Like, shoulder roll press? He can do everything. He can do everything. If you watch some of the training sessions that Ryan put out there, he's doing everything. His shoulder roll is probably his bread and butter and the spot where he couldn't be stopped in that round robin. But he effectively top rolls and hooks, too.
Justin Bishop: And I think it was one of the better is one of the two is either the worst thing that can happen for you or the best thing. One of the two, because Lachlan is going to level up now. Now, how fresh will he come in? You know, he's not used to arm wrestling somebody who's doing him like that on a regular basis. And when you you know, when you don't take the proper time off, you can tell. Yep.
Paul Lynn: so you're 100 right i've been and i run that through my head already a couple times like you know is it you know i don't want to i don't want to arm wrestle a damaged version of him either and i don't think he is based on i wouldn't care come here yeah that's on him that's on him yeah i think i think like you said though you you know as far as training wise justin like if your local group or whoever you normally practice with if if you
Paul Lynn: you have to wait till two hours into practice before people are redlining you. You're not getting that true, you're not redlining when you're fresh. And when you have guys where you can go and travel to guys that can redline you fresh, that's the stuff that makes you stronger and better. I might need to hold this right here again at some point. Yeah, but so what you, Justin, answer this, answer this, right? Because I thought about this because the right guard form has been like a hot topic lately.
Paul Lynn: and did a podcast and he was on it and and i almost like chimed in about it with my own thoughts so this is a guy who's been arm wrestling for like maybe under two years he's young he's incredibly gifted he's arm wrestling on a continent where there's not a lot of opportunity to arm wrestle and get experience he's had a couple super matches i think he's pulled a couple tournaments now he had to round robin that's about the extent i believe of his experience level
Paul Lynn: The original question that came up in the chat was, does he deserve a match at East versus West or when should he get one? So my question is, if he does get a match on that stage, is that a good thing or a bad thing for his development?
Justin Bishop: I mean, it really all depends on who they're giving because the experience itself is not going to be a bad thing. It's going to, you know, this is how you become, you know, used to doing these things and become a veteran. You got to do, you know, I mean, is he deserving? I don't think so, but that doesn't really up to me. If he's marketable, you know, this is a business at the end of the day. So, you know, obviously I'm going to say that I'm a lighter guy. So, but,
Justin Bishop: It depends on who they give him. If they give him somebody that's, you know, it's hard to tell, like you said, because he's coming off somewhere where there's not a whole lot of elite guys, you know. But we see what he's doing with Lachlan. We've seen what Lachlan can do in the past. If they give him, you know, they give him somebody that's strong, I think, you know, he'll do well. But if they give him somebody who's strong and has a high table IQ, I think they walk the dog on it.
Justin Bishop: But, you know, you never know. You know, I beat the best in the world at the time, my third year. You know, but what ended up getting me beat was my inexperience. You know, so he's probably strong enough. His arms still, you know, real fresh, probably very, very few aches and pains and all that other stuff.
Paul Lynn: so so so from my experience what I enjoyed the most about arm wrestling early on was that the kind of that climb and that no pressure like let's go enjoy tournaments just go pull every weight class you know pull every week practice on Wednesday compete on Saturday don't care you know what I mean I had a lot of fun doing that and like when when guys are so good or so talented
Paul Lynn: i personally worry not that they're kind of getting cheated out of that overall experience now that said i you know if i was in that position and somebody somebody offered me you know a high level match or a contract or something like that i would have been super thankful
Paul Lynn: And I 100% would have jumped that. But in hindsight, I wouldn't have traded that experience for the world, that climb, because that was, to me, when it was most fun. So I think about that a lot of times, kind of apply it to schoolboy. We're talking about a guy who was competing at WAP and the juniors and stuff. He goes viral. And all of a sudden now, every single thing he does or every time he arm wrestles on a practice day or anything is so heavily scrutinized.
Paul Lynn: to the point where he can't i don't know how that guy's supposed to be able to focus on getting better because everybody's either thinking he's he should be he's at a higher level than he is or they're wanting to prove that he's not at the level that he is at so like all that scrutiny i just
Paul Lynn: I think in Reichardt's situation, I think that he potentially is that good. And I think he might be able to step on the stage. And then we also, when you talk about the hype for deserving and stuff, when a guy comes out of nowhere like that and does what he did at that round robin, the internet picks up. And that's where a lot of the matches come from.
Paul Lynn: um i'd love to see him pull i'd love to see him pull but like again with like i i feel for the australians in general and some of the european countries because they just don't have that many opportunities to compete so i guess you know if i'm putting myself into these shoes i would love to get a match and i think i think he he probably will get something really big really really soon and i'm interested to see how he does i actually think he's gonna do really well
Derek Smith: mean the fact that he's taking on and beating like the best guys in their country i mean we want the best guys from each country like representing you know at east first west i mean so that in and of itself kind of puts him on the level in my opinion maybe he hasn't paid his dues and done all this stuff that especially we have to do in north america but like he's the man if he's the man they want the man on the stage you know i mean like if that's what he is so
Paul Lynn: In that respect, I mean, I think he deserves it for that. Well, and we can't really even talk about paying dues anymore. Like, I think a lot of times arm wrestlers like with those shade on these matches, right? Like, oh, the Whisperer and all. You heard a lot of people throwing shade on that. People throwing shade on on Leonidas. Now look what Leonidas, you know, like the reality of it is at the end of the day, especially at the highest promotions, is about pay per view sales.
Paul Lynn: So, like, if you can bring something of added value or new eyes to the sport, you don't really need to pay your dues. If you can bring a couple thousand more pay-per-view subscriptions in and new guys who've never done it, like, we can't be mad and throw shade about a guy getting some, you know, quote-unquote hasn't paid their dues or getting a shot that we don't think is warranted. I don't think that's fair. And I think, you know, I think
Paul Lynn: that King of the Table has done a pretty good job of augmenting their card with at least one of those types of matches that's garnering some type of social media hype. And I think doing that is good business. And I don't think that anybody has sold out in any way, shape, or form to just doing those gimmicky type matches. But I think one or two of them is really good. And actually, that's why I love the Schoolboy and Leonidas match.
Derek Smith: uh being on east versus west because we don't see those masks very often west yeah i mean on this card i mean technically you know schoolboy bowen in terms of levels compared to the other guys on this card you know i mean potentially that would be the mat that would be the social media you know pushing match on there and it seems yeah king table usually has one whether it was larry against somebody or you know they always make sure to have something on there that's just a little more catchy um
Paul Lynn: so i wonder you you think easter stress will start taking on to that and i mean i know they had leonidas but yeah i do i do i do and i don't think hangin's backing down from the 14 15 match cards like it's easy to throw one in there yeah right and i think it's good business i i i do think it's good business i think that you know like the reality of the sport is we these pay-per-view sales have to get better
Paul Lynn: they have to like ever like they have to incrementally improve if we want the entire sport to keep moving forward like the the pay-per-view sales are the driving force because as you know arm wrestlers keep going over there and winning a match and wanting a little bit more money the overhead is going up with every event so the pay-per-view expansion has to follow the same trajectory or that's where that's where
Justin Bishop: the promoter or the promotion winds up in trouble so getting getting more eyes on the sport is paramount like i think it has to happen it has to be prioritized yep yeah you know you gotta view it like a business you know i mean who's most marketable who's gonna you know people don't like that you know but you know i myself used to not be very fond of it you know uh but i'm kind of in between because you know i kind of
Justin Bishop: got my name early much earlier than some guys but you know i pulled 40 50 60 tournaments before that you know establishing we used to go at least once a month to a tournament around the south back then everybody was having tournaments so but uh yeah i mean i'm i'm with whatever's going to grow the sport more i'm not i'm not so far as to like that that whole uh
Justin Bishop: beer man and Uncle John match type, you know what I mean? I'm not with that, really. I think that could be a separate thing, you know, but, you know, within the realm of, you know, rational things. And, you know, like Paul was saying, you know, with the scrutiny some of these guys are taking and so forth, that kind of comes with the territory, you know. Like, when I beat Giannis in 2013...
Justin Bishop: that uh that video went to like half a million views pretty quick and i was reading the comments bro and i'm like man really they were killing you they were killing me bro like who gave this guy samantha before he walked out you know yeah i mean yeah that's when i found out you know some countries really don't like american arm wrestlers you know like it was
Derek Smith: this all this talk that actually we're doing right now kind of segues into like a point that i kind of want to touch on on this show at some point like we're talking about sport growing and things like that like man and talking about heat from people and talking about shade being thrown i mean when people are i don't know if you uh the chat people watching have been focusing on what's going on lately and all the shade been throwing it at my guy ang in here but it is super frustrating guys like i from my perspective this is my opinion that everybody has to share this it's just like
Derek Smith: I feel like a bunch of spoiled children around now. We finally got something. We got something, the most amazing thing we've had, man. They are pushing top, all the best guys in our arm, one spot, competing against each other. They're bringing in the new hottest talent. They're pushing pay-per-view sales. They're getting these guys paid. And I wish we could just be really public about how much everybody's getting paid because they're getting paid more than ever, you guys. Everybody's been taken care of. We're in a dream place right now in arm wrestling. And it's like so much due to Angan.
Derek Smith: it's so much today and he puts his everything into the sport everything he this dude makes like no money and puts everything right after the first that east west is over that night and it'll be dead tired his wife will be dead tired he'll still be talking about matches for the next one he'll still be hyped and i can't wait i can't wait i can't wait this did like if people had seen or could see that side of it and really like not think that he's just some in the background evil guy like they don't understand like he's an arm wrestler dude like he cares about this more than anything and it's
Derek Smith: it's very frustrating to see just random people just saying complete crap about it when like they there's nobody else that can do or would do what engen's doing and no one else would have the connections and the experience and care that much and be able to make this happen the way he's doing it so no it's not just we'll find somebody else to do it no we won't we'll find some millionaire who doesn't give a crap about the sport
Derek Smith: We'll find some guy that's, you know, a 40-year-old arm wrestler who people don't trust, doesn't have the connections, can't make money, can't make it happen. Like, we can't. This is a perfect storm of a guy to make this happen. And so, like, it's just really frustrating. I mean, we've been there, you know. It kills me, dude. It kills me because, like, look at some of the comments that people be like, like, these guys are only saying this stuff because they're on the payroll or they work for AIM.
Paul Lynn: And it couldn't be further from the truth. Like I've literally had this discussion with Angan. I have said to Angan, you do not have to pay me more. You do not have to continue to pay me more money. I am happy to come over here and compete at what I was paid the first time I was here because I am concerned about the business model.
Paul Lynn: you know and that if you keep paying me more and this is an unpopular perspective to arm wrestle right like but i'm saying this because he you know i have gotten to know the guy i start everybody out you know trust and integrity you start basically at a neutral scale of five and then your actions are what's going to earn you that trust or that belief in your honesty or integrity
Paul Lynn: and this guy without any prompting or without any ulterior motives has has like exemplified the fact that he is very much concerned about us as individuals and us being paid and treated like professionals and that's such a high it's such a high point of focus for him that i actually even worry about the business model
Paul Lynn: potentially failing because of that and I've kind of voiced that and I don't think we're going to fail but it's like you said Derek people think there's all this money being made um and and of course there's profits but they go right back into the next one because the overhead keeps going up and we're at such like a pivotal point too especially coming into East versus West 14.
Paul Lynn: to me that it's like critical mass like i'm i i praying so much that this thing just pops off so perfectly that the challenger series pops off and then that just follows suit because i think that could be something that pushes us to the next level and i think when when there's so much bickering and divide in arm wrestling promotion i found that at the smaller levels and i see it also at the highest levels i think the thing that everyone neglects to acknowledge is
Paul Lynn: Whatever that top league is, that top league is driving the sled, right, for everyone else. So whatever expansion that top league can get to, there will always be a trickle-down effect. Just like the NFL, everything trickles down from the NFL to college football to high school football to the systems that they run. It all trickles down.
Paul Lynn: the growth of the sport, how well the NFL is doing is directly correlated to how many kids are coming out for youth football. And I just use football as an example because it's something I know. And it just kind of frustrates me when I see like divide all the time, because in reality, we're all working towards the same thing. And if if
Paul Lynn: you know we're in support of each other everything will grow equally along with that trajectory that that top lead is following and and because I know that the engines intentions are clearly so pure about the advancement of arm wrestling and getting arm wrestlers respect I just find it so hard now I get I get the rough edges and I get some of the posts and the emotional things and
Justin Bishop: kind of how he carries himself because the man is a ball he's a ball of emotional energy that he has tied completely up in armor when you have that kind of passion you know when somebody attacks you yeah you know something you literally putting your life into uh you know you're gonna you're gonna get a little emotional about it um you know I agree with everything you said maybe I don't know if we're all working towards the same goal exactly
Justin Bishop: you know, with particular people we're talking about. Cause like, I don't know, some of the stuff people are complaining about, even outside of Egan, you know, I'm like, bro, who cares? You know, like this is why I don't even get on social media half the time, you know? Cause I don't know. There's so much negativity, um, you know, stuff like I brought up the, um, the match with, uh, the beer guy, uncle John.
Justin Bishop: even though I don't really like it, I'm not on here, you know, oh, we should never do this. This is terrible for arm wrestling, you know, blah, blah, blah. You know, they don't, half of them just hate and don't have a clue of what they're talking about. And that's one reason, you know, it's going that way because they don't really understand all the things you're pointing out. You know, how it runs, how it needs to function, you know, how much money is required, how much,
Justin Bishop: advertisements cry you know all these hours and hours and hours you know like i don't even get on social media that much and every time i scroll past a post it's like something you know negative about eating or some somebody crying about something i'm like are these grown men like i don't i don't know grown men like this you know but i don't know
Derek Smith: Go ahead. People like, I think people misunderstand that like one thing and just learn how to work the internet, like five years ago, like, you know what I'm saying? Like,
Derek Smith: yeah so like you have to understand that this is all like the most of it's a lot of it's north america guys like just and a lot of times when i see people from european countries and stuff comedy on this they're like i get again like i understand like his passion and stuff like he's from a different culture so everybody expects him to act and stuff like like he's someone that's been raised on the internet like like i've been i was a professional video game player i'm used to crap talking cool i can handle all this stuff he's passionate about it and so it's just like i when i talked to him love him to death i talked to him like i would talk to my grandfather
Derek Smith: in in the sense that I come at him with respect my grandpa smacked me in the mouth one time because I got lippy like I understand like okay that frees from a different time in a different place you respect all what it's all about so you misinterpret something as disrespect yeah he gets pissed off and like I get it he's not he's not used to this game and so like I but people don't take that into consideration like their biggest gripes are like hanging bands who got off his chat like that's it just he didn't want him in his chat room like that's like the biggest things that we hear about oh he's horrible he bans you off his chat like
Paul Lynn: That's it? He's doing everything on the occasion of the sport, and we want to talk about him banning people from the chat? So quickly we forget some of the stuff that was similar topics when WAL was around.
Paul Lynn: And look, I love WL. Like, I hope WL comes back. I hope Kaplan comes back with a vengeance. He brings a different aspect of business acumen and stuff. And it's awesome. But Kaplan was not an arm wrestler. Right. So because of that, he was very easily he's a businessman. So he's first or whatever it was, the 2017 WL.
Paul Lynn: uh wal finals they lost the sponsor so it just it didn't happen she said oh by the way all the money's gone we're canceling it what and it was only like a month ahead of it and people were outraged by it and a couple of you know travis and and uh frank and karen bean and some people got together and they saved the event and they kind of saved basically the reality of it is now like people have always kind of like speculated like well what if kaplan was an arm wrestler and he actually cared
Paul Lynn: Well, now we have that name, right? We have the guy who really cares about arm wrestling so deeply, like he's willing to sacrifice time away from his family, his life, his health, you know? So we have that. So now we're looking at these two polar opposite extremes. I think the good thing in the core sports, and we talk so much about East versus West,
Paul Lynn: But Core Sports, you know, is king of the table in East versus West. These contracts are for both. And now the more I get to know Don, Don takes a different approach. And Don takes the more, you know, backseat, like you don't see him, you don't interact with him as much. He's more of a businessman. That balance is going to eventually pan out here as their relationship continues and these promotions continue through Core Sports.
Paul Lynn: And I think that, you know, it's a learning process. Yeah, we've been through 14 iterations of these these East versus West and an 11 king of the tables. But that's only happened in like two and a half years. You know, they were so frequent that like there isn't a whole lot of time between one to learn from the mistakes of the prior. So like they're they're learning as they go. I mean, they're they're planning three, three events in advance.
Paul Lynn: And they're you know, there's so many moving parts to it. So like a little bit of grace, give a little bit of grace like that. It's getting better. It's not getting worse. I can tell you that everyone gets better. So I think most of the people hating on it, man, are like looking for clickbait, you know what I mean? Looking for their way to the top kind of thing. And that's you know, that's the problem I have. Like, you know, I get
Justin Bishop: you know, tagging a popular guy, whatever in your post to get more views. But when you got to go out of your way to talk trash about somebody, you know, to get to the top, I just, I guess a lot of arm wrestling groups I left just, just because like, I don't even think I'm in one anymore. Uh, the East versus West group, but I don't know, you know, and that's what Brian got a lot of hate for, for a while, you know, um,
Justin Bishop: Not necessarily talking bad about guys, but, you know, making controversial topics and, you know, ridiculous claims, really. But, you know, that's part of the world we live in now. You know, in 2024, you see it everywhere, really. You see guys trying to get fights in the UFC by talking trash about this guy, you know. You know, and it's entertaining sometimes, you know, when you're kind of clever and you can back it up, but
Paul Lynn: You know, a lot of these guys can't win a state tournament. So, you know, nobody really cares. So, well, yeah. And I think like to kind of piggyback where I think he was going with that, like I, I watch I watch everything on.
Paul Lynn: you know i bought the last high five i look at the arm gods i don't have a problem with beer man mats at all i mean personally i i have a little soft spot for that that entertainment level stuff i do agree it's a separate thing you know or maybe it's it's a one match a card thing or maybe it's its own promotion there's a time and a place for everything um and and just because somebody doesn't like it it's fine that's that's fine too like but the reality of it is like competition
Paul Lynn: if done in a healthy way, will grow everybody and make everybody better. Like healthy competition versus unhealthy competition are two separate things. Like if your road to advancement is to step on as many people's heads as you can along the way to get above them, that's number one, you're focusing then on that rather than bettering yourself. And that may have a negative impact on whoever's head you step on.
Paul Lynn: but if you are competing against each other you know with like an overall goal of elevating yourself or elevating together like it's it's kind of like like like i've used the football analogy i want my my inside linebackers i want them training at the same rack together
Paul Lynn: you know all of them you know the two starters and whoever's competing with them for a spot and i want them i want to micromanage that and make sure that those guys are competing in a healthy way because they're all going to get better when one makes a game that's going to give them that that subconscious motivation and then once that camp rolls around we're all wearing the same color jersey and we're going to see somebody else you know and if it's done that way you get better as a team but if one of those guys is seeking to sabotage or
Paul Lynn: you know hoping for you to fail or or trying to do whatever you can underhanded to get ahead of you then that keeps both people down and it creates a like a level of toxicity and and i think these things sometimes these situations happen organically you know you can't you can't stop them it's human nature right but the reality of it is we're in such a niche sport you know and we're at such a critical impasse i believe that like if if we were to look at it like yeah these these
Paul Lynn: leagues and promotions out there, maybe they are competing. But as that production value gets better, then so will East versus West and vice versa. And we're all learning because we're hitting that point now where we've never seen so many high level promotions and so many highly produced promotions. I think it's freaking great.
Paul Lynn: Like it couldn't be any better. Like there shouldn't be any animosity amongst people. And the reality is, is our fan base is so finite as well that most of us, me being a fan myself, I look at everything. You know, if there's an arm wrestling event, I want to know what happens, at least so I can think about it. I want to understand the entire field as much as I can. And I really don't care what promotion puts it out.
Derek Smith: And there's a ton of great promotions, guys. None of us in here are knocking other promotions, saying they're horrible or not worth going to at all. I'm constantly on my channel talking about all the different promotions.
Derek Smith: how awesome their shows are. I get them all. I buy them all. I watch all of them. Talk about all of them. They're great matches. I think that should go without saying. No one should be trying to tear down any of the other promotions. The ones that are still popping up and growing. There's still more in the future. I'm hearing about more and more promotions popping up. Ian Carnegie has the Mac coming up. There's a lot of stuff still coming up. I think it's a super exciting time for us. I'm really excited about seeing where things go.
Derek Smith: let's talk about let's talk about um the challenger series quick speaking of yeah i got the list right here oh wait oh my gosh um chad sent it to me the uh so the challenge series can be uh june 15th you guys in orlando florida um these are gonna be a series of uh matches kind of
Derek Smith: geared towards getting people, I mean, shots of East or West are getting guys that are kind of unknown, um, some matches so they can kind of move forward. Uh, chance Shaw set this up in, you know, working with Agan and, um,
Derek Smith: I got them all right here. Now, some of these names I haven't heard of. Some are just Chance's boys. No, they're awesome arm wrestlers from Florida. First one we got, Chance sent me the last name of some of these guys. Ahmed versus Daniel Sellers, right? Oh, that's supposed to be left-handed, actually. He corrected that. Daniel Sellers is a beast. I got to meet that guy. Plus, he's cool. He's a guy who brings a lot of energy. He's going to be interesting.
Derek Smith: They said, because Ahmed has two matches. I guess he's French. He's like the top guy from France or something. Chance is saying that he's been arm wrestling for a little while. Super solid technical arm wrestler. But he's supposed to be bringing some, you know, from France. We're getting an overseas puller out here, which is kind of important. But I don't like a lot of the guys Chance is telling me about. I don't know much about Dade Sellers. Do you know anything about him? No, I don't know much about him either.
Paul Lynn: So, I mean, but what Chance is telling me is that, like, that's basically a matchup of a newer guy who's, like, big and brute strong versus a more seasoned guy from France that's coming over, like, more technique. So Daniel might be a little bit stronger, but Ahmed is supposed to be just real refined. Daniel Sellers is the guy who beat Leonidas. And I was at an Olympia tournament or something. He's, like, he's a guy that looks like he looked like Leonidas. He's, like, a 250-pound, like, 7% body fat dude. And he can arm wrestle. Like, he's...
Justin Bishop: He's newer, I believe, but he's pretty versatile. And he brings energy, too, man. He gets fired up. It's good stuff. I love his name, bro, Leonidas. I wanted to name my son that. My buddy named his son Leonidas. My wife wouldn't have it. How kick-ass would it be to be in the classroom when they call your name?
Paul Lynn: yeah well i i believe you can like like i think giving a good name is like empowering a kid from birth too like if you slap the name leonidas on the dude he's not allowed to be salt no you can't be you know like listen i'm gonna call you leo from now on you're either leonidas or leo yeah the names i give these men these little boys now like hayden grading this is gonna be a grown man one day you know all right
Derek Smith: Moderators, can you guys please plug thechallengerseries.com in the chat? You guys, I think Chance is still running that special for $9.99 early bird special or the pay-per-view, and it's going to be doubling in price. And the in-person tickets are $24, and they might be doubling in price by the time you get to the event. So if you guys want to get your tickets early or pay-per-view early, then check out that site and buy the pay-per-view. He's got a VIP option. I saw some people really questioning the VIP option.
Paul Lynn: I thought that was interesting. Whatever someone chooses to charge VIP for VIP is okay because that's their decision on what they're risking on how many people is going to purchase it. It doesn't matter. I saw a list of things that come along with that VIP, but let's be serious. When somebody goes to a nightclub and they get VIP, I've been to Vegas, I've been to places.
Paul Lynn: I've spent $5,000 on a cabana at a pool party. That was a group of us. Don't worry, we split it. But I'm saying I know what those things cost. And the people who are willing to spend that money in those situations,
Paul Lynn: That's for them. You know what I mean? And again, it's one of those things where like maybe it works out with that price tag and maybe it doesn't. But I think it's awesome. I know what the guys that come over to Turkey and what they get for that that VIP experience. And I think I mean, when you look at everything that they're involved in and the amount of time that the amount of time that I've spent individually with VIPs.
Paul Lynn: Like, is amazing. And a lot of them wind up being the people I hang out with the most when I go over there. So I think, you know, it's either for you or it's not. But I think it'll be interesting. I think this is a real, a real cool beta test to see how 14 is going to do.
Derek Smith: yeah i uh i because i mean the the vip thing gets you guaranteed after pulling and like i don't after pull but chance is like all right you have to ask for the vip guys all right but hey there you go at least in for me i can't speak to the other arm wrestlers i'm only gonna have to pull with vip guys and i'm out probably so like uh if you want to wrestle with me pretty much you have to be a vip guy because i just i'm tired of me commentating the whole time i want to go like after we're done i want to head out i'm not trying to hang out so but uh i mean i'll trip up with the vips though
Paul Lynn: Carl Stanley, Shane Owens, right-handed. Ooh. And Shane Owens is a bad dude. I know. I'm a big fan. But he cut a lot of weight. He cut a lot of weight recently. I like Carl, man. I want to see Carl do well. Shane is a good guy, too. I know he might be the favorite coming to that. But I like to see Carl in that state. I've seen Carl in different forms. Yeah. You know, if he comes in in the top form,
Justin Bishop: He'll win. But, you know, I hadn't seen him compete in a while. So it's hard to say. Yeah, he usually he well, I think with the left hand, he can do all of it or do everything with both hands. I think right hand just is more shoulder, right? I think it used to be his left was just all shoulder. But the last couple of times I've seen him compete and he was, you know, going both ways with it. He seemed like he was trying to top roll more.
Paul Lynn: Well, he's been around the game for a while, and he's a pretty good-sized guy, too. He's nothing bigger than Shane. He's been around for a long time. I talked to him in Florida, and I had, you know, being that I've only been around for a little bit, I had no idea the level of experience he had. Yeah. Yeah, for a young dude, too. He was doing it when I started. Yeah, I think he has 20-some years in, believe it or not, right around my age. Your age? Yeah, I think so. Yeah, he might have 30 years in.
Derek Smith: John Doe in the chat says, I think Leo will whoop you. Don't get me started. I'll crush Leo's right hand. Don't even start this up. You don't want to. You don't want none of us. Gangling for a match. Well, they brought it up. I'm just answering. Now, left-handed, I know it's not too special. Right-handed, though, I'll crush him. I got to get back to my boy, Larry. So it's my guy. So as revenge, I need to get on with Leo.
Derek Smith: George Whitfield, Eli Sidoff. So I didn't know about this left-handed. I didn't know about who George Whitfield was until Chance had me go watch the video of them two pulling at an eight-man round robin. George Whitfield's a bad dude. And he put the brakes on Eli. Ended up fouling out of their match or whatever, but he was the only guy in the whole round robin to even put the brakes on Eli left-handed apparently. Justin, what do you think about Eli's level right now? I mean, he's top of the... I think supermatch-wise...
Justin Bishop: It's going to be a very good match, I think. I think coming out of the gate, Georgia has to be. He's a little bit bigger. I think he's probably a little bit stronger. But, you know, obviously endurance is not his thing. So if he can't – I think if he can't finish quick, if he's going to win, it's going to be 3-0. But Eli – I pulled Eli before. I pulled Eli when he won 2017 WAL.
Justin Bishop: I pulled him like a month afterwards and left-handed. I beat him 3-1, but it wasn't because I was stronger. I was just a better arm wrestler that day because I couldn't top roll him. And I remember thinking, you know, if I get this guy to the straps, I'm going to smash him because I'll just be Todd Hutchings. I'll just be pro to hog him, you know, like, ain't no way. And I get him in the strap, hit backwards, and went right to a hook.
Justin Bishop: I start leaning over and I see him looking at the crowd and I'm like, all right, let me restart this thing. And, um, yeah, I made some adjustments where I could beat him, uh, in a hook, but I would have him so far down that in his thumb turned so far over, there was no side, uh, to engage. But, um, so I know how strong he was even before that round. Um, he was one of two guys I thought, you know, would be giving me some trouble. Um,
Justin Bishop: When I pulled him, I was, I don't know, man. I guess I was just asleep. Sure, I don't know. I thought I was, you know, I even thought I failed to try to get a restart, and I didn't even do that when I watched the tape. So I'm like, oh, you know. But I pulled George, but it was kind of middle to later in the round robin, and I didn't have a lot of problem with him. But I think it's because of what I was saying. You know, Eli's not going to get up there and fight. He's not going to.
Justin Bishop: let you read him. You know, this is why I'm a lean Eli. The experience, you know, he's been to the best of the best tournaments. He's pulled the best of the best guys. Whereas, you know, right out of the gate when I grabbed George, you know, he's squeezing, he's doing this, and, you know, he's letting me know exactly what he's doing, basically. So, which sometimes doesn't matter because if you can't shut it down, it doesn't matter. But
Derek Smith: You're wasting a lot of energy there in a match that I think is going to be pretty close power-wise. Evgeny though I give the edge to George, it's not a good thing to do. I think it's going to be exciting. Either way, they're going to be explosive and fast, but it's kind of a conflicting style because Eli's more outside and George seems like he's inside, right? No. Eli's inside. All inside. Eli's all inside? I thought he was outside.
Justin Bishop: I'm sure he can do a little both. He can do a little both, but he wants to go inside. Eli's going to try to put him on his bicep. Unless he feels like George can win there. We've seen George has the ability to be there and make Eli wait on him because that's basically what Eli was doing in that match. He was waiting, which was a smart thing to do because he was so far under. George has huge hands.
Justin Bishop: If he's got the right setup, it won't matter. I just think if he goes in there and blows his load, it's a wrap. He's not a small dude. His arm is not small either. He's got a huge forearm, huge bicep. Then we got
Paul Lynn: Robbie, his last name Carson. Carson Knight. Carson Knight versus Jon Therrien. Right hand. I think that's a good match, man. I think a lot of people were sleeping on Robbie when we saw him pull some of his first big matches. We saw him pull Luke Pulcher at Monster Factory, and we saw him beat Frodo Hoglin, and then we saw him pin Coach Ray, who I think overall, arm wrestler-wise...
Paul Lynn: Ray was the one who could adjust. Robbie's just getting going right now. Tons of horsepower, man. Tons of horsepower, raw strength. He's learning as he goes. Once he starts gathering some experience, it's going to be interesting. John's going to be a real test, man. John has done some impressive things lately. I would probably give John a slight favor than that, but I also wouldn't be surprised if Robbie won't.
Derek Smith: Yeah, it's an experience thing. That's what it seems like it'll come down to. Can Robbie with strength overcome John's experience? I think that'll kind of be the makeup. Have you pulled those guys, Justin, or no? No, I don't. They didn't ring a bell, to be honest. Gotcha. And then number five, you didn't put last name's Hunter. I'm assuming Hunter Knopf versus Patrick.
Justin Bishop: He says Patrick. Yeah, I think that's it. I don't know much about those guys. It's right-handed. I haven't pulled Hunter right-handed. I have pulled Patrick at WAL. I don't know what kind of form Patrick's in. I haven't seen him in six, seven years. So based on what I felt then and what I'm seeing from Hunter, I think it would be a pretty good match. I would give Hunter the edge.
Justin Bishop: speed and inside. Um, but I don't know. Um, like I said, seven years is a long time. So, and I don't, unfortunately I don't get to keep up with a lot of, uh, European arm wrestling. And, uh, but I have watched Hunter, you know, on a tear lately. Um, I've been hearing his name a lot. Yeah. I think if he, um, I think it's time for him to level up to, you know, some, some higher competition. Um,
Justin Bishop: You know, that's because that's the only way you're going to learn. You know, you put in these spots under these bright lights, you put in the spots you're not sure what you need to do, you know, because you can sit there and practice all day on the table, you know, or do this when they do this, you know. I've seen so many guys be so, I would think they're going to win this tournament, hands down, go in there and go 0-2, you know.
Justin Bishop: I don't think that's Hunter because I think he's pulled at a high enough level stateside, but it is different. It's not exactly the East versus West card, but you're still pulling international talent now. We've got Matt King versus Vios. His last name is Antilles. He's from Sweden, but he's Greek, but he lives in Sweden now. I don't know much about Matt King.
Paul Lynn: But Chance kind of described him as a super strong dude, a little bit newer, I think he said. Yeah, he's like very Jason Merlot-esque. Oh, okay. I pulled with him in Florida. Incredible finger pressure and cupping strength. You know, like your pure back pressure top roller, who you're really not going to get through his hand. Got like that Tom Chileno vibe. He's very, very good and unknown or underrated.
Paul Lynn: i think the thing we saw most recently was was was him beating artem okay yeah yeah that's that's what uh that's a chance to mention that quiet nice guy too a lot of times those guys don't get no attention oh he's quite nice if ios is an animal on the table too that might be an interesting uh thing to watch
Derek Smith: I'm excited to see Vios back. I guess he just won nationals in Sweden, like went undefeated in classes and stuff like that. I've been a fan of him since he pulled Vladislavs from Latvia back in 2018. The supermatch was wild. He's a bad dude. After that, we have Ahmed and Paul Passmore, right-handed. Now, I'm excited to see Paul getting back to that level right-handed again. Getting back up there.
Derek Smith: uh I know after he broke his arm he broke his right arm for a little bit he was having some I think it was just mental you know obviously makes sense right like he was he was so sideways before after that broke he started kind of not not full sending sideways anymore and he was killing people and I think people forget that he was right on the cusp of being like that guy you know when that injury
Justin Bishop: So, like, I think there's a lot of us really. Who are we talking about? Paul Passmore. Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah. So he has a right-handed match against Ahmed, the guy from France, on the card. Yeah, Paul, he's one of the few people I've felt just have side pressure, weird angles like Toddzilla style. You know, he's that shorter arm, you know, gives a lot of people problems sometimes, especially when that shorter arm guy is an inside puller.
Justin Bishop: But I'm sure he's not taking it lightly. I've always kind of told him, you know, to be at that 242, 230-something weight class. I thought he'd dominate more there. Obviously, he's proven himself at heavyweight, too. But, you know, when you start leveling up to, you know, the best in the world, you know, it's different than the best in the nation. It's a big difference. I can compete at middleweight, you know, 198 here.
Derek Smith: I'm not competing at 198 international level. That's true. Those guys are monsters. Paul, can you beat Passmore? I've never pulled him. I've never pulled him. I have. David you beat him? Yeah. Yeah?
Justin Bishop: Yeah, I beat him in overalls. I've never beat him in, you know. Take it. Take it. Dustin beat him when Paul was, like, 19. He first started on my board. Paul's older than me. No, he don't like it because he lets me know the next time we aren't wrestling. I promise you, I'm thanking my L's to him. I'll never forget it. I'll never forget it.
Justin Bishop: I will never forget losing to Sam Harrison overall, like, a couple years in. Yeah, we talk about, like, demoralizing when you think you're getting better. The only thing that keeps you in those matches are two things. You know, they had a long day, you had an easy day. And technique, you know, and getting away with certain stuff. You know, so if you're up there with a guy who's got a high IQ at the table, it's always dangerous. I don't care what size he is.
Derek Smith: i i've lost some overalls in the past some guys and they still it's been like 10 years and they still message me every like the on the yearly like annual thing about that matchup that one time they beat me in those overalls didn't jamie beat you one time no no jamie never got me in overalls i made sure of it it's too close i lost to my buddy jay warren out here i don't know if you guys remember
Paul Lynn: Yeah, I'll never forget that, man. I remember losing it. I remember Sam posting this picture with his two hammers or whatever from winning the overalls. He won the overalls both right and left. It was a small tournament. But I went and talked to him. I was so new. Right afterwards, I was like, dude, what is going on? And he sat with me for five minutes and explained to me his setup and what he did to me. And it was like light bulbs going off.
Justin Bishop: And since then I've been like that, this, I can absorb things from Sam better than everybody else. And he like, he showed me everything and he was like, look, do this. You'll never, and I'll never be treated. It was like that. Sometimes it takes those guys who can explain it, you know? Cause I've, I've had guys tell me stuff. You didn't register till years later, you know? Yeah. Uh, one of the best pieces of advice I ever got was from James Ritter, like two o'clock in the morning on the table after.
Justin Bishop: I think it was 154 Super Series or something, like 2012. He was showing me how to lowhand top roll. And he does it slightly different than I do it. But it didn't register for like five years later, what he was talking about. I think you probably tried to show me that same thing, and I'm still waiting for it to register. You got to practice it, baby. You got to go to tournaments and do it.
Derek Smith: I remember there was some like Devin Laird videos. When I first started, I watched it and I was like, okay, I think I get it. And like two years later, I go back and watch the same video. I'm like, oh, now I kind of get it. Two years later, I go back and watch the same video. Now I really get it. You know what I mean? And still, it's like you keep learning from the same piece of advice. And then until finally you're like, it's fully, you know, brought in. I tell people it's like a golf swing. You got to feel it. You know, you're like, oh, that's what he's talking about. Matt Mask voting Brock left-handed.
Derek Smith: So Matt Mask and Wilton Brock. Wilton is supposedly a
Derek Smith: free left-handed yeah stupid strong yeah i think i pulled him in and when they had the wl in vegas the tournament back in the day i can't remember if i pulled him right or left but i think he was right-handed i think he beat me right-handed i remember he was just strong when he gripped me that thing was he was he's lefty and um you know i think i've seen him give devin fits left-handed at the wl thing um depends on how active he is he seems like
Justin Bishop: I'm connected with a few of those Southern Alabama guys. It seems like he's been training even before this match, getting ready. It's one of those stylistic matchups for me. It's going to go one way or the other, I think. I think Matt's going to be too fast and get too hard up top or Wilton's going to catch him because Wilton can pull with his wrist back too. If Wilton stops him,
Justin Bishop: You know, we know Matt, he's not known for his gas tank. But I think, I don't know that Wilton has pulled somebody as long and as big a hand. And, you know, that style, that's always leaned towards the low hand top rover because there's not many real good ones. And it's real hard to deal with. And usually dealing with it's not in a hook. You know, usually you have to go, go higher, stay tall.
Justin Bishop: and go over those two fingers they're dumping. If Wilton can do that, you know, but how many people have you seen, you know, do that to Matt? Not many. But it is left-handed. I don't think we've seen Matt in a while left-handed. Not that I can remember. Well, Brad Grundy's in the chat, and he's out there. He says, I pulled them both. It's close, in my opinion. Oh, yeah. Spot on. Yeah.
Derek Smith: So, I mean, I'm excited to watch that. Matt's obviously always exciting. So, I mean, he'll bring energy for sure. Speaking of energy, after that, it's Brett Rakers and Bios left-handed. That's going to be violent and awesome. Do you think Brett Rakers will hang with him? Do you think Brent's going to be too much? Man, I think Brent. Brent's one of those guys that, you know, a lot of people have been wanting to see at a high level for a long time, you know.
Paul Lynn: The guy quietly kind of goes around and dominates. I think Brent has moved up in weight classes. He's also a guy that's extremely lean, well-conditioned. I feel like he's hitting a stride. I don't know a whole lot about Bios left, but I'm ready to see Brent.
Derek Smith: like on a card like this i think he's a guy who's kind of been on that level for a minute you know oh after that uh robbie russell verse it's gabriel and i don't i can't think of the last time do you know anything about gabriel where is it from oh man
Derek Smith: forget is he swedish i feel like chance of all swedish people um yeah i was gonna say there's a lot of swedes on the card so yeah so suddenly chad spends time in sweden sometimes in florida it's all floridians and swedish dudes all over this part yeah uh but it's it's gabriel oh i'm gonna chance to try and tell him about forgetting though um but robbie russell is that that's your boy justin or no are you good yeah he's in tennessee yeah oh
Justin Bishop: We pulled several tournaments together. Robbie's one of those guys that has all the potential in the world, really. He's that strong, that solid everywhere. He's just lacking some small things here and there. You know, if he shows up top shape, I don't see it being real close. But, you know, you never can tell Robbie. If he shows up and he can get off,
Justin Bishop: I see it being real easy. You know, we've seen him hold Craig up in a hook a couple times. You know, his hand's solid. It's super solid. I don't know why he don't sit on his tricep a little more. It's like all you got to do is this, you know. But, you know, he likes to control the match. And, yeah, sometimes that's not the smartest thing, but he's definitely strong enough to be at the top.
Paul Lynn: Yeah, he's a guy I root for, man. I like him personality-wise. I click with him. I really like kind of the way he carries himself, you know, without a whole lot of talking. And he goes about, like you said, he's all horsepower, too. Like, he's a guy I'd like to see, you know, at the next level, too. So I'm rooting for Robbie always. What's up, little man? What's up, dude? You don't worry about him? He said, nah. Yeah. Yeah, give him the plaque.
Derek Smith: That's right. The chat, they asked this question earlier, and I forgot to get to it. Who do you guys think will have better hand control between Michael and Lars? I feel like odds are Lars is going to give it up, and Mike will be. So I don't understand what you mean, really.
Paul Lynn: Yeah, I don't think that really doesn't come down to, that match probably doesn't come down to what we would consider traditional hand control, I don't think. I think we might see a top roll attempt by Lars. I think we might even see a traditional top roll attempt by Mike. But I don't think either of those guys are known for traditional purist hand control. I think- The block wrist versus the king's move and then- Yeah.
Justin Bishop: And we could see Michael flopping or shoulder rolling too. It might be a race to give away your hand, you know. You know, and Mike in the last couple of matches, and he looked much better this past match. But to me, Mike's hand rotation hasn't been there, you know. And, you know, and I've practiced with Michael, you know, a couple of times. His hand was never that super impressive outside the strap.
Justin Bishop: It's inside the strap where it feels ridiculous. And that's another guy, I think, kind of the Dave Chafee, Artem Morozov thing. Too many matches, one after another, you know. And I think it took a toll on Mike. Maybe he took a step back a little bit, re-evaluated his training. I think he's got this match, for sure. Because, like I said, he's looked better.
Paul Lynn: But I don't think he'll have any trouble top rolling. Yeah, the interesting caveat to this match now is the looming match with Dottie Kahn now that Devin backed out. So I believe the winner of that match gets Dottie Kahn for a title.
Paul Lynn: And I think that's I think that's good, Juju, for for Mike. I think now he has like now he has like something direct, like right away, put it on the calendar that I'm working towards, you know, rather than like I'm making a comeback and this is going to be a six step process.
Paul Lynn: Now, feed her to the fire. And now it's not, of course, it's pressure, but it's also pressure with like a pot of gold at the end of that rainbow. I think that's good for Mike. Give him some direction, you know, and I think he'll make the best of it. Is this one that was right handed? Yes. OK. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Regardless. All right.
Derek Smith: that answers that question going back to the list um we are at andre sharkovich versus emil um emil's last name angst angst extra extra um andre's been looking ridiculous lately yeah dude look come on like i i was amazed by him against jerome i was amazed that was the match i was waiting for man that's the only one i got my camera out for you know
Paul Lynn: And the way he, I don't want to say effortlessly because there was a ton of pressure being applied, but how he was never in trouble. He was never threatened, regardless of the side of the buckle, just never in a bad position. And I didn't see that match going like that. I knew Andreev had a chance, but I mean, I rate Jerome's hand so highly for, for Andreev to be able to control it. I was like, right. Yeah.
Derek Smith: Yeah, Jerome's reminds me of Robbie Russell a little bit. Yeah. Andreev's getting as strong as he looks. But Emil's no slouch, dude. That guy's legit. He's number, what, two in Sweden, I think? I don't know which hand, though. Left, isn't it? Yeah, so...
Derek Smith: This has the makings to be a ridiculous match. I'm really interested. I guess I'm more invested in Andreev since he's in the States and we've been seeing him around and his progress. I've talked to Emma before and I've been watching videos on him. I can't predict who's going to win by any means. I'm excited to watch it. After that, Auden Laird and James English right-handed. Yep. Main event, right?
Derek Smith: um there's two more matches listed after that in in the way the order chances um okay so james is practicing out here i'm seeing james uh every at least once a month i have been for less than months because we have this big joint practice in southern california it's strong now i i'm not doubting that odd will be a better armor so than james but is james i i am of the opinion that james is stronger than odd
Derek Smith: Now, will that mean enough? Is he strong enough where the skill gap will come into play or won't come into play? I'm not sure. Odin's getting bigger and bigger. He's young. He's growing fast, you know, getting bigger and stronger. But, man, James is no slouch at all, at all. People, if anybody's thinking he's just a bodybuilder getting into this, he's been crushing it. He's been training his ass off of this. So...
Derek Smith: i it's really hard for me for me to call at this point it's just i definitely think it's strong dude with it's a you know school boy versus uh leonidas match potentially you know in a sense you know i mean experienced guy has been around for a while and i've gone around with a big name or some other guy with a big name who's kind of bodybuilding background getting into arm wrestling you know and can he pull it off
Paul Lynn: Yeah, I'm not qualified to really break that one down. I would like to see it to be, I would like seeing it like as a contested match though. Maybe one that goes back and forth. Right. That's what I'm hoping for. Yeah. What do you think about that match? Todd and James English. Justin, you got any thoughts on it? I don't know James English. I've seen him arm wrestle a couple of times. He looks very technical.
Justin Bishop: as a better technician. Normally, you know, to me, technique is, you know, obviously we're in a strength sport. But, you know, in a sport where most guys are pretty strong. So I lean towards technique because technique is taking me further than strength. Yeah. Understanding how to play, you know, take you farther than your strength.
Derek Smith: When you have both of them, you know, you're breaking up kind of kind of it's hard to tell a little bit with bad again. We're back on the Wi Fi.
Derek Smith: We only got two more matches, guys. We're going to wrap this up. We're coming up on, what, two hours? We'll wrap this up. Next week, when we get back in this, we'll wait more on East vs. West coming up because we finally got over King of the Table and Challenger Series. We'll finish that right now. Next week, we'll hang out more on East vs. West card coming up. Cody Merritt, Eric Fahlgren, left-handed.
Derek Smith: So Eric Fahlgren is basically a Swedish version of me, build-wise, right? This dude is huge, like, blonde beard, blonde hair, but is an absolute unit left-hander. He's the guy that, would he tear Gennady's bicep or broke his arm? Tore his bicep. Yeah, AWF. That was Eric Fahlgren. He slammed him to a hook, and Gennady couldn't go through him.
Derek Smith: um and he hooked the big guy that traditionally a lot of shoulder equipment sideways uh against Cody right Cody Woff champ um and uh I don't know what shape is Cody in I think that's the biggest question always is how healthy is Cody feeling obviously he has the experience and you know the accolades are ridiculous um and Cody's so strong is he gonna show up his strongest version like
Derek Smith: Cody, he's not confusing, but it's just like, man, this dude's pulling with broken arms during a match. Cody's just always jacked up, man. Where does he show up at 100%? Eric is such a big dude, though. That's a lot. Have you seen Eric Fogren pull, Justin? No, but I've seen Cody several times. He's no small guy. Going with him, I don't even have to see the other guy.
Derek Smith: there we go oh yeah definitely cody's i'm in cody's corner 100 i mean actually i'll be commentating so i'll be pretty uh unbiased but well i'm not commenting uh you know team west of course right um but yeah i just have a lot of respect for eric i mean that dude is serious um i think a lot of people see pictures and videos of them they're like oh jesus this dude he literally is just me with blonde swedish version so he's huge he's a big big dude
Derek Smith: And the last match on the card, Matt Mask and Brad Grundy right-handed. I have to say that Matt Mask is probably top two in the world right now, strongest dude ever. That's the only reason he was able to beat me. So he's definitely going to walk over Brad. No chance, Brad. Sorry. There's no chance. I got to make myself feel good about losing to Matt. Right, right. I need Matt to crush Brad.
Derek Smith: now i'm cheering for brad but i need matt to crush brad to make me look better right the question is who wins between you and brad ah man i don't know i mean he has to get through matt first yeah okay i don't know brad's super strong man i have no idea
Derek Smith: i don't the thing is i never consider brad like a super heavyweight i'm always thinking he's down like a heavyweight with like pablo and those guys you know what i mean like in my mind i don't just never consider same thing with matt they're they're heavyweights so i don't usually think about those guys you know too much in terms of like who i compete against well every time i talk to brad he's telling me
Paul Lynn: going to 242 or almost at 242 and then he's competing at whatever he is you know so i don't know have we ever i mean i know brad's ever really gotten to it he's always told me he's on his way there and everything but i don't know i think i think he might wind up look he keeps winning at that weight too you know and i i've doubted him i like i told him like when he's prepping for the pablo match like
Paul Lynn: I was pretty clear. I thought his odds were not great. And I thought he had to make the match ugly and drag him into deep water. The way he was able to win and the adjustments, the patience, the decisions, is just super impressive. And he's one of those dudes where a lot of times, the past few matches he's had, I've kind of questioned his chances. And I've been proven wrong so many times now that I just refuse to do it again. I think the guy is the future of most
Paul Lynn: of our heavyweights slash super heavyweights over here because he's another one who's so young. He's such a student of the game. He has adjustments. He's got a great hand. He's got power to go with it. And he bleeds arm wrestling. Obviously, I love Matt. You know what I mean? I never want to see Matt lose. So for me, this is a tough one. This is a tough one to really predict. But like Justin said about the low hand topple,
Paul Lynn: um and and picking your way through it and find it where you can expose it i think brad will know how to do that or or be able to toy with the lanes needed to beat matt there the real question is is will he have the horsepower to control the index pressure needed to do i don't think he's going to be out arm wrestled though
Derek Smith: Well, the tricky thing to do with Matt is that Matt's really explosive. I mean, for me, I'm a big slow guy. I've also never seen Brad exude a ton of speed from what I've seen, right? Not the fastest guy I've ever seen. And Matt is...
Derek Smith: explosive and gets real tall and backwards so it like my plan was high inside that was the initial plan but by the time i even initiated that my arm was already out here and i can't get the up pressure from out there to to climb because it was so explosive backwards so for me that ended up being a problem that the explosiveness like threw me way off i that they went in the right spots a thousand ago but i thought i'd be somewhere sooner than where i was and all of a sudden i was spread out um
Justin Bishop: So I'm interested to see how he'll deal with the explosivity of Matt Masters. I mean, you haven't seen too many guys top roll Matt. So most of the guys that beat him that are real strong cupping, real strong side pressure. I think I've seen him get beat with a quick shoulder roll before, which I think I've seen Brad do. So-
Paul Lynn: Yeah, I mean, Yorin Sagov got the hook on Matt. What, Saunders hooked him. I think back in the day, did Devin hook him at WL? I think he top rolled and eventually. Who, Matt? Yeah, I guess Matt. Just started thinking like recently. He did hook him the one year. I don't know if it was right or left, but he sat forward with his wrist flat long enough until Matt's burnation died. It wasn't a clean, but he didn't do it easily. He had to wait, wait, wait, wait. Yeah, he had to have that long arm, real strong cuffs.
Paul Lynn: Frankly, I rarely was able to post out there. Lay on your tricep. Go up, up, up. I've never relinquished the top. That's how you beat that low hand. Either way, excited to see you.
Derek Smith: brad brad is the future i i really do think that i think he's he's moving forward and uh it's uh it's awesome to see and he can choose heavyweight or or uh or uh super heavyweight if he wants to send my boy mike you guys see my boy megabyte his recent match dude what a weirdo and like i messaged him right after that dude i i was like and then i guess they did pull the the fourth match in the straps because at first like after he got that first win hanging on to his thumb
Derek Smith: then he got the second one i was like oh no we're not going to be able to see anything you know what i mean but like wow wow i i when he told me practice the week before he said i'm gonna try this thing i'm gonna try locking on his thumb and i'm just gonna clamp right here i'm not gonna get the full grip i'm just gonna clamp right here and i was like yeah cap chalk that thing up and he goes i think i can hold on to him i go all right maybe because wayne had to be the favorite going into that and you know
Derek Smith: And so I'm like, just hold on. I can't believe it worked three times in a row. I can't believe I just kept trying to slip. That's it. I didn't want to go sideways or upside anything. I was like, yo, it's third time. And then the straps. But, you know, Wade's arm had been pulled open three times right away. So straps, you know, Michael's able to pull through him.
Derek Smith: Man, my boy, and he's always around, and speaking of heavyweight, super heavyweight, he's around the cusp. He'll walk around 255 or so. So he can kind of, obviously he can bang with the big boys and super strong in the heavyweights. But he has his eyes on Pablo and stuff still. He wants that revenge on that little suit match they had. Anyway, guys, 551 for me.
Paul Lynn: We got to wrap up. Hey, Derek, just a couple things. I know we were wanting to get to East versus West 13 and a couple other topics after that. Like you said, let's hit that next time. But I just want to echo, we got some stuff coming up. King of the Table, make sure you get that. Challenger Series, get that. Afterwards, we got 13, get that. Then 14 in August in Orlando. It's going to be a huge, huge and very important. Team West, baby.
Paul Lynn: Yes, sir. And just to keep in mind, guys, I know the information is still being released, but we will be holding a tournament tonight. So if you choose, if you want to come and see the arm wrestling, we thought it would be a good idea to also provide an opportunity for you yourselves to compete because we know the fans are most of us are arm wrestlers anyway.
Paul Lynn: So now you have the opportunity to compete if you choose to. Amateur classes, pro classes, all that good stuff. We'll have all the classes there. Planning on doing maybe some special stuff too. We're making a qualifier as well, obviously.
Paul Lynn: And then you'll get the opportunity to pull in front of everybody. And it'll most likely be the actual official East versus West referees. And I think Engen's planning something to have the actual competitors hand out the awards potentially after the event. So we've got some cool stuff going on. And I think it's a step in the right direction for really bringing that
Paul Lynn: East versus West brand to everybody to have an opportunity to participate, not just be there for experiencing a great show. So we'll have more details on this stuff moving forward. I'm super excited about it. So I just want to cover that before we end it.
Derek Smith: yeah um also moderators if you guys could i see benji over there plugging the eastwest.com website and the challenger series.com thank you uh and the pay-per-view links thank you benji also can you share uh paul and justin's youtube channels a little bit of shameless self-promotion hey no that's how you get matches paul you gotta be famous man right right
Paul Lynn: And mine too. David you see that? I got roped into doing some corny videos. David you see that? If you want to see a really corny video where I look really, really stupid, that would be the only reason to go to my YouTube.
Justin Bishop: It made me think of Pee Wee Herman. I'm not going to check it out. I'm not going to check it out. Hey, you know who messaged me about it and loved it and was like, man, I want to do something like that? The last person you would ever think, Tom Toledo. Tom's like, that was awesome. I want to do something like that. Yeah, he's into that corny stuff. Like that video him and Gary made was so lame. I was like, I can't even come up with a rebuttal for this.
Paul Lynn: I could be into that. Justin, whenever you want to be back in here, man, let us know. We'll reach out to you if you're available. Fridays, same time? I don't know. Fridays, Thursdays, whatever. Let's figure it out. I mean, we're working off of it. We'll get an established time. This time is good for me. Like you said, Thursday's a lot of time for Friday. Probably good, too. We'll get an established time.
Paul Lynn: And then I'd like to keep Justin on here as much as possible. And I'd also like to toggle a few more people on that. I think, you know, I think Justin's a very, a very accurate representation of American arm wrestling as a whole. Oh, you so sweet. It's because it's from Alabama. I got you. The ladies love it.
Derek Smith: I was trying to see if I could say something about the match, but he never let me know. Maybe next time. I got a big announcement, too, about matches, but I couldn't say it either. I'm with you on that one. We're going to wrap this up, guys. Thank you for watching. We will promote next time when the podcast will be next week. We'll let everybody on YouTube know. It'll be on the same channel. Thank you guys for hanging out with me. Thank you, everybody, in the chat. Talk to you guys later. Appreciate you, bro.
Derek Smith: See you all.
