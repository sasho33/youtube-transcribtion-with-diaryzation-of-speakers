Engin Terzi: the the the kid that's kind of a little twitchy he's got like a little tick um again oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that was that to me was the the most intense you know his opponent right um
Engin Terzi: remind me of the guy from the guy that beat me in Moldova yeah so when I saw that match come up because I didn't know the other kid I was like oh this will be this will be easy easy for uh is it Marat is it how you pronounce his last name a rat oh which one
John Brzenk: Murat? I don't know how to pronounce his name. Okay, okay. The one is Petro Marharint. Petro, Petro, Petro. Petro Marharint is the guy from Moldova, and his opponent is Nugzari Shikadze from Georgia. He's from Georgia, okay. Yeah. First time I've ever seen that guy. I didn't know anything about him. Last Europeans, he beat Krasimir in strap. He top-rolled him and beat, like,
Engin Terzi: uh year before number one involved crossing the number two ukrainian he beat all of them he's very yeah yeah oh super strong yeah i know he could he definitely was uh he you could tell that he had that you know that he just wanted to get things going fast twitch um uh super strong out of the gate but yeah that was surprising that um
Engin Terzi: it switched after that second round in the third fourth and then he ended up coming out petro ended up coming out the winner but yeah that was super exciting that's probably my favorite yeah that guy is a top roller the georgian guy is a top roller but if you realize that in second round he beat him in hook
Engin Terzi: In a hook, right? Yeah, no, he had better position, and it surprised me. He outlasted him. But then again, I've seen Petro get beat by Oleg Petro, kind of like that, too. Like, he initially got the position, but Oleg was able to hang on and then just outlast him in a hook. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That kind of didn't completely surprise me, but...
Engin Terzi: Yeah, no, he had the better technique, I think. His wrists were strong. Petro's wrists were strong. Yeah, Petro would be a nightmare for anybody that's a decent top roller. I would like to see maybe him, see if he could stop Irakli. Yeah, Irakli, Ongarberg, that would be a good one, yeah. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: So yeah, no, but all the matches were really good. I mean, it's, I, I only watched the live event, so I didn't watch any of the reruns. So I'm not like super, my memory's not super good, but, um, yeah, I mean, they were all, uh, they were all, you know, there was a couple of them that were, you know, lopsided, you know, um, just crushed the other kind of, you know,
John Brzenk: I felt sorry for that match. But, yeah, I mean. You remember David Samushia and Aydar Khan, the Kazakh guy? Oh, yeah. Awesome match. Incredible match. That was probably my second favorite for sure. Yeah, that was a tremendous battle. Yeah, back and forth.
Engin Terzi: But yeah, Davit showed a lot of heart, had to pull in bad positions for a long time. He's definitely got the frame and the joints going for him because he can stay that way all twisted up like that for a long time. Yeah, yeah. This guy won eight title matches in a row. Incredible. I bring him all the best ones. He still beats them. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
John Brzenk: And was this guy, uh, someone that was, uh, higher in his weight class than normal, or did they both make weight the same way? I mean, no, both, both are like, David is normally 87, 88 kilos. Aydarhan just went up to 85 kilos this year. He was, he was 80. David you see the golds match? Um,
Engin Terzi: I did. Just a little bit, though, that I can remember. It wasn't super memorable, I guess. Arthur Macaro and the gold. Yeah, he got swept. He didn't win a match, so he didn't get a chance to get into it. Yeah, I do remember that one. That was kind of unbentful, but it kind of surprised me. Everybody, I think, was hoping that...
Engin Terzi: Madagascar was going to be able to, you know, stop it. And once he stopped it, maybe, I mean, there was a couple of places where he, he had, you know, stuck it for a little while, but yeah, it was just too far out of position.
Engin Terzi: But yeah, no, all in all, super exciting. Job well done. I mean, the production quality was great. I don't know how everybody else's fee was, but mine was flawless. Initially, I was a little upset that I couldn't get my phone to connect with my TV to watch it on my TV. I was going to have to watch it on my silly little phone, but then I realized if I downloaded it to my computer, my computer would simulcast it to my TV. That ended up working out, so...
Engin Terzi: Yeah, it was exciting. I got to watch it on the big screen. And what did you think about Ali Canmurado? Okay, remind me of this one. The one that pulled left arm with Ermes, the Kazakh. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, I kind of expected that. I mean, that guy is so... I think on our last podcast, you asked me about that. I thought,
Engin Terzi: I was thinking maybe, you know, it'd be a close match if they did it righty, but then you said left. I thought, oh, shoot, I know. I've seen him just crush some monsters, so it wasn't super surprising to me. He needs to pull right-handed. Is he an arm wrestler? He's not bad. You know the Reno Masic? Do you remember Reno Masic? He beat Sasho Staginasvili. He also had a left-arm title match with...
John Brzenk: Matyushenko, he's from Croatia. That guy, yeah, in the last WAC Worlds, Ali Can with right arm in a fresh match beat him. Ali Can's right arm is not bad, but left is not from this earth. Is he a natural lefty here?
John Brzenk: I think his right arm, but he said that he broke his arm when he was young twice. And the guy, I think he's only like 230, 105 kilo. And the thing is, I think he's ready to pull guys like Matushenko, Vitalii Laletin, if he comes back, Levan Saginashvili and Morozov.
Engin Terzi: yeah no he doesn't he doesn't look lopsided it doesn't look like his right arm is like some guys you know just that are just strictly left-handed pullers that are you know his right arm's not tiny it's he's pretty symmetrical so i would imagine he's probably a little bit of training and confidence he could be right there doing it doing the same thing with his right yeah yeah he can i mean he has never been at the same level as his left but his right was also but see they are saying that
Engin Terzi: I mean, it's great when you're competing, but when you're not competing, you should be commentating, people says. Yeah, right. Yeah. And the competition was, was awesome. I mean, I could tell that you guys had a little bit of, I'm sorry about my nose. I've got allergies going on here in Arizona. That's just stuff. Yeah. But, um, the common commentary was great. I, a few times I noticed that your microphone was dead and all I heard was Travis. David you, what did you think about the main match? Let's let's hear from you.
Engin Terzi: Oh, so you're talking about the Devin match, right? I was super excited first round when Devin seemed to have kind of stuck it in the middle. And for a second there, I thought, is LeVon, he looked really confident. I was like, is he playing around? What is he doing? Just kind of, you know, you know, just standing there with Devin, just, you know, kind of showing off. But then then he did get have to kind of throw a shoulder and get kind of kind of
Engin Terzi: lose his wrist in doing so and I thought oh shoot this this might end up being a match if if that was a real first round but then I don't know he collected himself and got his cup a little bit more focused on his cup and just just completely took it away from Devin I mean
Engin Terzi: Yeah, I mean, Devin lately has been, because he's a taller individual and has been able to pull that back pressure so well that he's a problem for almost everybody other than obviously someone that has the size, the equal size.
Engin Terzi: um you know the hand strength is just so important in arm wrestling especially when devin's doing what you know what he's doing i felt like i i really was sad that he didn't move his elbow forward after realizing that the king's move and trying to extend out like a straight arm like that wasn't going to work
Engin Terzi: When, you know, when LeVon moves forward like that, to me, from my personal experience, always moving the elbow forward in the cup and trying to stand your arm upright puts a lot more strain on somebody driving down like that than trying to, you know. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: He faded away completely with his arm. And of course, I know what he was trying to do with, you know, as much back pressure as he possibly could. But I think in that situation, it might have been nice to see if he could have maybe moved his elbow forward and try to get even stay higher.
John Brzenk: when he was getting driven down like that. Whenever you are very open like this, you are vulnerable for the pressure to the side weight. If I were him, I would try to save the center because his pronation was strong enough, but I think he was losing the wrist. I think Levan's power is coming from the back pressure and then side pressure together with pronation. I think Devin needed
Engin Terzi: this more than pronation because even he was he was holding here but he was right from the wrist yeah but we don't know we don't know what he's feeling i mean yeah yeah yeah going into it that was his his in his mind anyway that was his best move to do and he stuck with it but um
Engin Terzi: At one point, I just thought to myself, just stay tough and just move your elbow forward and try to just keep your arm stood upright so that he doesn't have that angle to really drive you sideways. He had to put some frame, right? It's easy to say, but it's hard to do when you've got a 500-pounder or whatever live on his 400-some-odd pounds crashing across the table on you. I don't know. I've watched...
Engin Terzi: an interview of Devin's one or two afterwards. And it sounds like he's, uh, um, happy and content and he's going to, you know, try to, we'll see how long it lasts. He'll probably be talking super heavyweights again, another couple of years, but as of right now, he felt like he was, uh, he did all he could do and it still wasn't enough. So,
John Brzenk: Yeah, but yeah, so now we got to find a new new up-and-comer for LeBron, right? Is it credential? I mean he looks so dominant against the Georgia. Yeah. Yeah against your gate cook Georgie had some kind of accidents Before the event he fell in bathroom or something his ankle was swolled and
John Brzenk: And he, in such condition, three days after the accident, he went to Bulgarian nationals. And he competed in Bulgarian nationals one week before the East versus West. Because there Bulgarians train every day. One week is even more than enough for them. And then he came to Istanbul. We asked him if he needed MRI or something. First he said no. But later I heard that he didn't want to show it, but his condition wasn't good.
John Brzenk: So he was taking antibiotics and everything. I don't know. We cannot take anything away from Kurdesha. But I'm not sure if also Giorgi was in...
Engin Terzi: Tick-tock form, right. Now, if your body's hurting like that, you're a little tentative about doing anything, I'm sure. It looked like, it almost looked like, was it a compound break? David the break in the ankle go out and break the skin? Because it looked like I saw something where he had like... Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think he had a surgery, he told me, when he went back. Oh, okay. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: You know, bathrooms are tough. You don't want to be just messing around, slipping and sliding in bathrooms. There's been a few arm wrestling competitors in the past that have missed competitions. You remember, right? You were set to put Rustam Babayev. You remember? Right, right. He slipped in the bathtub. 189 wall title. And then he canceled, yeah. And...
Engin Terzi: What do you think? Who can be a good opponent for Kurdesha? Think about Hermes, Laletin. Well, yeah, Hermes needs a rematch with Kurdesha. I think Hermes has got the loss on Kurdesha the last time. So for sure, Hermes. But yeah, no, Kurdesha is probably the only one
Engin Terzi: know maybe big enough frame to maybe take away some of that um that that just physical size that that levon has i mean i don't know it's almost kind of funny like that with um sometimes you just get beat because you're just not your frame isn't big enough to handle some of them that that large that thick and um is definitely you know on that level of size wise that it might not mean so much you know of course um
Engin Terzi: Yeah, there's a few others, of course. But, yeah, I mean, I think he's kind of in line if he's staying with the sport and going to stay strong and go after it. Morozov, I think, also is another candidate for sure. I mean, with his size, he might be able to deal with LeBron. It would be interesting. Yeah, there are still monsters out there. Yeah. Do you know Kilo Sarcev?
John Brzenk: He's like a powerlifter, strong man from Russia. And this guy was here. And I think one week before he came here, he had a training with Denis Diplenko. Okay. And Denis was able to take his wrist. I saw. He was, yeah. When Denis waited, he was stretching, like, Denis like this. But Denis, whenever he wants, he was taking his wrist. And this guy came here.
John Brzenk: And then he had some trainings with Kalinichenko and some other guys. And then next day, you know, Ermes competed with right arm. So he trained with Ermes. Ermes was able to beat him straight, sideway. But whenever I told Ermes to take his wrist, because his fingers are very strong, Ermes couldn't take his wrist. He said, it's very strong, is it? Right. Yeah. I've experienced that. But then Spanko was able to take his wrist. The same guy's wrist.
John Brzenk: A week before that Hermes pulled him. And now Hermes and Denis are going to pull. Of course, it cannot be exactly that way calculation. You know, you cannot make that kind of calculation. But do you think that Denis is pronated and the back pressure and the arm lock here can be problem against Hermes if Hermes doesn't, like if Hermes makes mistake or something? What do you think?
Engin Terzi: I think so. I mean, that kickback top roll that Dennis has in his bicep, Ermes is going to have to rely a little bit on his coming across the table and cupping technique to secure that, you know, to bring Dennis' kickback to this position. So it's going to require...
Engin Terzi: uh and ermy's you know he's he's got great back pressure got great side pressure but his hand isn't this you know maybe the size that it would need to be to be able to do that to dennis so i worry that it might be kind of a weird match i can kind of see both of them going out to this kind of pronated position with that you know flattened wrist and then um but i think ermy's may possibly have enough side pressure strength to you know
Engin Terzi: take dennis off center and if that happens yeah um yeah um i mean what if his wrist fails when he takes his hand i think i think his wrist is going to fail i don't think ermys will have the control in the cup to really commit to try to cup dennis to bring him over you know to bring him under his hand i think he's going to rely on his his knuckles high back pressure uh
Engin Terzi: And because of that, Dennis will do the same and kind of kick his wrist back and then rely on his bicep to hold it there. And do you think Hermes can press him like this because he is able to do those kind of things? Yeah, I don't know.
Engin Terzi: obviously has a ton of, you know, ton of side pressure. I just don't know if it's going to be enough. It's going to, I think it's going to, it's going to look ugly. It's going to be one of them both ugly matches that neither one of them has really the control of the other guy's hand. And who's going to be able to, to, you know, gut it out and outlast the other, as far as just locking in and putting the side pressure in. I think Hermes is capable. I mean, Hermes is, you know, is right there hanging with LeBron as far as,
Engin Terzi: being sticky, you know, with that, you know, upper arm strength. So I think it's going to be a great match. You know, Dennis, you would think Dennis would have the hand strength in the cup, but it's just, it's not big enough to really, he's never really controlled people like that. He's always kind of relied on kind of the similar move that Travis does and Hermes does, you know, the back pressure knuckles high, even though it feels so dominating, you know, like he can grab low and feel like he's got containment of you.
Engin Terzi: But he doesn't have that along with the twisting motion to really bring somebody upright. So he'll stay with his knuckles high, back pressure. I think that going back pressure versus back pressure against Dennis, I think it's a mistake.
John Brzenk: I think, do you remember that that one just came a little bit forward? A little forward, yeah. And then it went more like sideways. It didn't go like this way. Because I think that the left of Dennis's
Engin Terzi: very strong yeah and then i agree i think the one needs to control here a little bit before they hit this and then the hit shouldn't be back way but it should be more like sideways right yeah i know you got to turn dennis's hand if dennis is able to make in his hand like this in this direction anyway whether the wrist is you know back or cupped um he's going to be dangerous he's going to be hard to beat that strength is incredible but yeah if you can turn them completely under then then
John Brzenk: I don't care who you are. The bicep is eventually going to fail. Yeah, some people think it's an easy match. I don't see the easy match. Easy match for who? They say Hermes is not going to feel him. Hermes is going to smoke him. Oh, yeah, I know. I disagree. Listen, Devin didn't have any danger to lose that match, but Devin didn't beat Dennis easy.
John Brzenk: trust me whenever whenever he was going sideways his wrist was bouncing like this you know just like right every time he tried to press him yeah and that one has really high like leverage you know just to come forward to secure his wrist you know so i don't know hermes may win like maybe he may dominate i don't know but that that match may become nightmare for hermes yeah i think so too i think i think
Engin Terzi: Dennis is one of those guys that is just really weird. I mean, he's just an outlier as far as just, he's not, not some of that, you know, feel the same with, with Dennis. He's just, it's just different. So we'll see how Ernie's is able to adapt to that. See how, see if he can figure it out. I mean, he's a smart kid, so I'm sure, I'm sure if it doesn't go well from the first match, maybe he'll make an adjustment and try to,
John Brzenk: move the shoulder forward and try to maintain that wrist cup a little bit more. I think it's going to be a close match. I don't think it's going to be a flash pin for either one. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Chris Pontello. I predict Artem Morozov is going to be top three right-handed in two competitions. I like his chances stylistically against Levan.
John Brzenk: You know, where Artem Morozov surprised me in last event, January, he was able to hook Kurdeca without the strap. That was interesting because he didn't look as big as before since his stomach issue. He's getting bigger now. Also, Alex Kurdeca's left arm is stronger than his right arm. So I thought that he would top roll Artem. But Artem, without the strap, was able to
John Brzenk: It was very surprising. So I'm just thinking, do you think there may be something if they go strapped and Morozov versus Levan, do you think there is a chance that maybe he will kill him or something? Yeah. I mean, I don't know. It's hard for me to say, I mean, just by watching if Levan is...
Engin Terzi: Easier to deal with or with or without the strap. I'm not sure what his strong point is. I mean, for more so, it might be, you know, he's so big and different and the hand control so good that it might be, you know, worthwhile trying to, you know, at least deal with him without the strap. I mean, you have so much more control.
Engin Terzi: flexibility without the strap, of course, you know, the strap kind of limits the hand and wrist and it becomes more of an arm game and more back pressure. So, yeah, I mean, if I was Morris off, I would definitely be going into it thinking that I need to not just let it go to the strap. I would, I would really try to force the issue to get a shot or two of manipulating Levan without, without the strap. I'm curious if there is anyone that,
Engin Terzi: can beat this guy. People are talking about Devin training Brian Shaw. Oh, right. Yeah. You ever felt him? No, but I imagine he's just crazy. I mean, but arm wrestling, well, most people... Maybe different. A lot of people know this, but arm wrestling is more than just...
Engin Terzi: Hence the root strength. We have so many examples of guys that are just crazy, crazy strong but don't have that
John Brzenk: power because of maybe the the the reflex of the nervous system that that that aggressive hit the joints there's something something unique or with arm wrestling coordination coordination of the muscles the coordination of the muscle group is what made you who you are you know i'm i'm 100 sure that there like there were people whose fingers stronger than you who's just oh single part yes but whenever you coordinate them all together all together
Engin Terzi: Yeah, and then yeah, you become hunter the person becomes Hans. This is exactly Yeah, no I can go through you know a lot of my passive thinking there's that there was hundreds of guys thousands of guys that were Stronger seemingly all the areas and they just you know, even with some time they couldn't put it together or whatever whatever reflex or coordination like you said there was something some x-factor that was
John Brzenk: that you really couldn't key on with strength that made the difference. Yes, synergy. Todd and Oleg, love child. Thank you. My favorite arm masters together. I love it. Thank you very much. Thank you, my friend.
John Brzenk: Yeah, we will see, my friend. What do you think about La Lecine? La Lecine and Kurdesha are probably the tallest guys, right, in the eight-hour thing. Do you think their match would also be good, since both are like over two meters? Yeah, of course. I mean, of course. Artem they slated to pull each other anytime soon? No, you're just thinking in your head. No, no, listen, listen. I have my board, you know, on the wall. Oh, you got your board. And then riding...
Engin Terzi: I didn't remember seeing them. I thought you were referring to the king of the table. I don't remember seeing them being, you know, they're not pulling a king of the table, right? So yeah, this is future stuff. Have they ever pulled each other? No. It'd be interesting to see how they each deal with the other being like, oh shit, this guy's as big as I am.
John Brzenk: Yeah, yeah, yeah. There are incredible matches left. There are still many matches, and then we will see, you know, how it will go. So who are you choosing, king of the table, get back to king of the table? Petro against... On Garvey. Yeah. Yeah, listen, listen. I should be asking you that question. Come on. I think, Oleg... One second, one second. Do you think that Petro improved?
Engin Terzi: Yes. I think he's improved. I think his hand, even before he was improved, his hand and wrist and coming across the table, it was dangerously close to being able to beat myself, beat many people, including, I also think, Crittigalli. I think that even back then, he was like, if things were right and he got a good start,
Engin Terzi: He possessed the mindset and the way he was moving, the direction he was going and committing that he might have been able to shut down criticality a year and a half, two years ago. But I think he's on a mission to prove that he can do it. I don't suspect he's very far away if he's, I mean, obviously everybody's going to pick
John Brzenk: under buy up to be the favorite but yeah they say he's gonna smoke him or something but that guy is not a joke you know that that much is a tough guy no no yeah no i i wouldn't be surprised if it goes either way so yeah me neither be because i i know he beat chan show he beat marcio yeah yeah
Engin Terzi: So, yeah, if his hand and wrist holds up, I mean, he's like Andreev Pushkar. You know, he's obviously taught by him. So he's going to commit completely to control the match and coming across hard. And if his hand is able to hold up to that, I don't see Kurt Aghali having the arm strength to stop the side pressure that's going to come with that. So it'll all be the cupping strength of the whole leg, whether he's got it or not.
Engin Terzi: he's, he's for sure got the confidence, I think, and he's going to definitely attempt it. I don't see him backing, backing away from that hit. Where would you bet? Oh, it depends on the odds, I guess. Um, I'd still probably, I'm going to give Pritigali the, the advantage just because they, you know, they have a little history, right? I've seen him practice pull against each other. So I think Oleg probably has a little bit of a, um,
Engin Terzi: worriness or doubt in his mind. So that would give Crittigalli a little bit of an advantage. If the match stops, then obviously Crittigalli. I mean, the guys... But depends on where it stops. You cannot say that just where the match stops. It may be advantageous position for Petro. Yeah. I mean, if it stops, which I don't think it will stop if Petro is able to establish his hand and wrist, I think he's strong enough that he will bring...
Engin Terzi: uh, criticality right to the pad. I don't think criticality is going to be able to lock and stop that if he doesn't have his, you know, hand position in a, in a good spot. But if it ends up being a hand war and criticality is able to somehow get, um, you know, to make it to be hand to hand, then criticality is going to probably outlast him. I would, I would assume that he's going to come out on top after six rounds.
John Brzenk: Or what is it? Five rounds? What is the king of the table? Maybe six rounds. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Best of seven, yeah. Not best of seven. I think they are pulling full six rounds, yeah. Six rounds and then a tiebreaker. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. John, how about you? How about me?
Engin Terzi: i don't know i haven't i haven't done anything since my match with the krazy i've done absolutely zero arm wrestling uh i'm trying to stay somewhat in shape by doing a little bit of hand and wrist and just keeping the hand strong but i told myself that i wasn't gonna you know get on the arm wrestling table for a while and kind of analyze how my my shoulder felt and um it's calmed down quite a bit but
Engin Terzi: um it's definitely not healed i know if i started back up arm wrestling again it would probably be um flare up and i get reminded of how pathetic it is just doing silly tasks anything overhead it's like i gotta raise my you know you know help my left arm bring my right arm up here oh my god why am i you know even still thinking about arm wrestling but
Engin Terzi: and I haven't completely given up on it, but there are times I have to admit that I'm like, okay, no, it's, it's time to, you know, to lay down the, the, the, the goals of, of being a top, top arm wrestler anymore. So, but yeah, I mean,
John Brzenk: The Kinesio tape, I would suggest you to use them before training because they are taking some pressure from those muscle groups. So you don't get damaged as much whenever you use them. I wouldn't use them on daily life, but whenever you go to a table, I would use them. So it will protect you some. Yeah. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: I mean, there's, I guess, workarounds that I hadn't really thought about doing that I could probably try to do to still be involved and strengthen myself for arm wrestling without aggravating that and being in so much pain and then just hope that it's stable enough and strong enough on competition day to be strong enough. But I don't know. I'm not...
Engin Terzi: super excited anymore with the arm wrestling just because it's um it's getting to be a real painful endeavor yeah okay how about you what are you doing are you uh making a comeback are you you starting to train it or you just still i this east versus west takes so much time energy from me i can't really concentrate i don't even remember when i last time trained
John Brzenk: I'm planning to that my equipment is in the somewhere else in gym. So I'm planning to bring them to home. And then so I don't have to go and come back. Like whenever I have some little time, you understand, I can just train a little bit and then focus on the job. But John, I realized that the one of the keys for success is just like focusing to target. So whenever whenever I see like that, I need to do a lot of things for East versus West.
John Brzenk: I cannot really focus, I cannot really motivate myself for diet, cardio, this and that. So I need to make it
John Brzenk: like decision to choose. So I'm just thinking one side is my personal goal. The other one is something for the community, for the sport I love and for the other athletes. So I'm thinking that you are not 25, so I'm choosing that side, but I will try to do both without giving up anything from the main thing, which is East versus West.
John Brzenk: But I cannot stop. I think I'm a good armwrestler. In a few more years, I need to pull before I quit. I don't want to quit like this. Times have taken, though, if you have any desire to .
Engin Terzi: Make your mark. I mean, what would be your goal? I mean, would you consider to pull maybe like David Shemishu? I was going to pull him. I was almost going to pull him if I didn't have the accidents. But still, that would be, I mean, you just jump right in and go right for the title.
John Brzenk: I don't know. You're right. Maybe I should design something. If you can do it, you might as well go for it, right? Okay, which one are you talking about? I should directly go for the title? David, yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, if I do it, I asked him already, September, can go to the table. I cannot do the East versus West. East versus West, three hours sleep a day, you know, with all the stress. Is the cameras ready? Is the stage ready? Right, right, right. You know how I am there. I mean, you see a little bit, yeah.
John Brzenk: Yeah, there is a super chat. I cannot read. Greetings from Bulgaria to you and John. I mean, I hope so. If the conditions are well, yes. And Todd and Oleg's love child. Hearing John talk of retirement makes me very sad.
John Brzenk: It makes us sad, too. But we need to, yeah, I mean, whatever he chooses, we support him. Whatever he chooses. We cannot be selfish. We cannot be egoist. If he wants to pull, we're going to say, go, John, we are with you. If he says, I'm done, we will be sad. Well, you know, to me, I love to still arm wrestle. I love to be involved with it. I mean, I almost feel like I'm cheating the public and cheating, you know...
Engin Terzi: community by going into these matches you know at 80 at 70 just because i can't because i'm hurting it i can't nobody nobody nobody expects you to be 100 i don't have the same i don't have the same level of just
John Brzenk: just excitement and commitment that I think, you know, everybody deserves, including myself, to, you know, compete at this high level. I'm not undeserving of it. Baba, listen, you are not deceiving anyone. People know that you have so many injuries. People still love you to see at the table. Maybe more careful about the matches, not like right away, like huge injuries.
John Brzenk: number one number two guys but just like still we love to see you there you know yeah and and how do you see the the progress of the arm wrestling do you see that this is going to positive direction
Engin Terzi: Oh, of course. Yeah. Well, we've talked about this a hundred times, but I mean, the, the, the, not only is the quality gotten better, but the depth, I mean, it's just, it's just mind boggling, you know, 10, 15, 20 years ago, we would talk about a dozen guys, you know, being in contention and, and, you know, what about this guy? What about that guy? I mean, there was just a couple of handfuls of guys that were very competitive, um,
John Brzenk: Now, we could talk for hours. There's 50, 60, 70 guys that are banging on the door. And every one and a half months, we see all of these guys pulling against each other. It's not dream anymore. They are actually pulling against each other. Yeah. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, but I think just the depth is 10 times what it was just 15 years ago. And it's very competitive. It's exciting to not really ever know. And it helps that you're doing just the one-on-one super matches. And obviously, from history, it has shown to be exciting. We're in a double elimination tournament. One guy, you would just automatically think he's better than the other guy because he beat him
John Brzenk: place higher in the double elimination well how many cases have we seen where guy goes down to zero and then ends up turning it around yeah yeah yeah yeah all right but what is the right right thing how many times you think that you need to meet someone to prove that you are better in the past 20 years ago when we had the training and we had the challenge you know unofficial challenge in training
John Brzenk: we were doing like best of three. The one who beats two times, we are saying you already proved. But now if we do that, it will be too short for the spectators. Yeah. Well, it's, you know,
Engin Terzi: Everybody just has to adapt. I mean, in the past, it was just more power, being more explosive. You had half hour, 15, 20, 30, whatever time to sit down and collect yourself and rest. And stamina wasn't a big factor. But with this new format, it brings a whole new angle to the game. And these guys that are super strong and are in great shape have a chance against these speedsters that are super explosive.
John Brzenk: In a double elimination tournament, they would never have that chance. I enjoy it. I think it makes for a better spectator. John, do you think that Levan is the strongest ever guy? Yes, for sure. Do you see yourself like the times that you were really...
Engin Terzi: heavy and healthy, do you see? I don't know because I don't know. Everybody that LeBron's pulled against, he's kind of put them out of position. So I don't know. The answer to that question would be, okay, let's see him and Dennis go at it where Dennis is his strongest. I mean, or there's plenty of other guys that I could bring up. I mean,
Engin Terzi: would armies be right there and beat him if they, if armies wasn't in such an awkward position, if he was just had the, the, his hand back a little bit, I say, yeah, that's a good possibility. Right. So there's, there's probably a lot of arm wrestlers that are on equal level of LeVon as far as arm strength, joint strength, side pressure. Um, but LeVon takes so much of that away just because of the size and width and, um,
Engin Terzi: know he's not really tall but uh yeah that size factor just really uh makes it difficult for most people to really give their 100 of their power right so um i think the verdict is still kind of out in my mind that i mean obviously he's shown that he's crazy strong and and in the right areas to take take it away from most competitors but um is he the strongest i mean i don't know i mean there's
Engin Terzi: There's been guys in the past history that, you know, with the right situation, you know, might be able to hang with him. It's hard to say. I mean, the obvious answer is, I mean, what the obvious answer in the most public say, oh yeah, I know he's the strongest to ever, ever do it. But I'm still, I haven't really seen the things that tell me that, yeah, no, he's, no matter what position he's in, he's that incredibly strong.
John Brzenk: Yeah, he's around, like, 6'4". He's not that short, but he is not as big as, like, Kordachev. I mean, I'm talking about the height. I think his hand, wrist is strong. And that's what makes the matches look so easy for him. His wrist has got to be, what? I don't know if anybody's measured it yet, but it looks like maybe 9, 9.5, 10. I think 11. I heard it's 11, I think, but I need to be...
Engin Terzi: You know, I need to ask him to be sure, yeah. I don't know. We will see. Next year, he said he's going to start with left arm as well. His left was better than his right before he got injured, you know. Yeah, he didn't look like he missed a beat. I mean, he looked like he was healthy and actually more confident than he was than his first match with Devin. So he looked like he was mentally solid, ready, and confident. He said that for round one, he wasn't. He said that
John Brzenk: Devon had a better start, and he said that if he would try to go, he would lose his wrist. He lost it. Yeah. He said that he waited, waited, but it looks like he was holding comfortably. His arm was holding. Yeah. But whenever he wanted to go, his wrist was, so he probably chose to go that way. Right. But he said that his wrist got kind of, like, better warmed up. Moved up a little bit, yeah. Warmed up. Yeah.
John Brzenk: Yeah, just what he said. And I think that when Levan was pressing like this, Devon kind of really, how to say, he pushed his limits. He may get some damage there. Not the bicep turn or something, but whenever he held it like this, I think he sacrificed maybe later rounds. Right. For sure.
Engin Terzi: when your arm is as taut as it can possibly be taut and it gets driven on like that and opened up like that, that's a nasty negative that's hard to recuperate with 90 seconds or two minutes rest. I mean, it's just, even if you're Devin, it's just, it's a tall task to be able to just jump back and have that get taut again.
Engin Terzi: So the round one started in a stop. I kind of thought that it was over. David you think the same way? Yeah. No, I did too. I thought, oh, shoot. I mean, especially, you know, even when he brought him down, I thought, oh, he's worn out enough where maybe he can, you know. But then we got let down. Boom, the second match is. Yeah, but the first match I thought, oh, shoot, Devin's going to do it. He's going to pull this thing off.
John Brzenk: I think Lewand was around 30 pounds lighter than the time that he pulled against Hermes. He himself says that he was too big. He didn't have good cardio. He says that that was the reason that, you know, he didn't feel good in later rounds. That's what he was saying. This time, his endurance didn't seem...
John Brzenk: bad, but we will see. Those matches will happen. There are some people that say, why Levan is not pulling so often? Whenever you set a match for Levan, they are saying, why did you set this match? Levan is going to kill him. It's nice to know that Levan is still searching for the perfect Levan. Devin's kind of in the same boat. I think he would
Engin Terzi: I've watched some of his interviews. He said he was just as strong today at 250, 260 as he was a couple years ago at, you know, 290. So, I mean, I think there's a balance. There is a balance there of what is, you know, and we're still, everybody is still searching for that perfect formula and not really knowing, you know, that balance of power and speed and strength versus losing a little bit of the cardio aspect of it. But,
Engin Terzi: Yeah, I mean in Devin's mind, it seemed like he was confident enough going into his match with Lalonde being 15, 20 pounds lighter than we've seen him in the past, so. Yeah, but I think it was only body fat, low body fat. Yeah, but still he felt like the extra body fat didn't matter, obviously, this time around. So whether it did or didn't, don't know. Yeah, one more question, John.
John Brzenk: When you were young, when you were like 17, 18, your motivation, there wasn't so big money at that time, right? Like talking about early 80s, very early 80s. Your motivation was because you love it so much and you wanted to become the best. Is it true that you moved to where the pattern is just to learn from it?
Engin Terzi: Most arm wrestlers do that, right? They find other people to feed off of and to learn from and to train with. Who better to learn the sport than at the time Dave Patton? Maybe Johnny Walker. I would have moved to Atlanta. You search out the best to feed off of that and learn everything you can learn and pick up what you can pick up. In your later career, you...
John Brzenk: very naturally and normal that you pick of course where the uh most professional events you know like where they like financially you know it's just like satisfying but what i'm just saying that the roots of your career has nothing to do with the money at that time yeah well yeah i mean yeah initially it's um getting accepted by i guess
Engin Terzi: starting would be just my dad. He's the one that kind of got me into it. So just showing him that I could be as good as him and then also maybe exceed and be better. And then it was the whole arm wrestling community. I just wanted to prove myself as I was getting better and beating better and better people. I just continued to just want to prove that I could do it across the nation. So yeah, it's getting those notches in your belt and having that respect that was
Engin Terzi: my initial motivator but then after a few years pass by and you know when you became good then now you start to then yeah then it becomes about yeah you know maybe a little bit more about the money but um
Engin Terzi: There's only so many trophies I could have stored in my house and I was like, I don't want any more trophies. But the beginning was you loved it so much, you pulled a lot. If you didn't love it, you wouldn't do so much. And you loved it and you wanted to become the best and you became the best. Everything fell in place. It helps that I got better, I was good at it.
Engin Terzi: exceptional at it so it gave you gives you that extra motivation and pleasure of of pursuing it i don't know how i would have reacted or if i would have felt you know fell by the wayside if if i wasn't as successful if i took you know beatings here and there but i don't know i mean i would hope to think i would hope to think that i would have just struck you know fought harder to to overcome those you know those individuals that
John Brzenk: do you remember on those days back northeast message board days i asked you know like who is the person that inspires you and then people start writing john birzing or this guy that guy and then you came and you said that the people who comes to the events compete and goes back to home zero two
John Brzenk: was in two matches without winning any and then come back again training and come back and follow you say that those people inspired you and then the whole whole message board was like wow you know like you gave us a different perspective you know about yeah and and looking back those were the most exciting times for myself i mean and i'm assuming that's what feeds you know the community is is you know
Engin Terzi: the little the little personal goals you know it's not you know most people don't care okay so you beat your neighbor so you beat the guy so you're the best in the city you're the best in the county now you're the best in the state yeah but but that's i mean that's 99 of the arm wrestlers out there right they're just trying to better themselves and and prove that they're they've they've they've achieved that by you know getting that you know that next little notch so
John Brzenk: Yeah, there is a super chat, Ordinary Gamer, before we finish. Were you guys surprised Devin was able to sleep so easily? Not sure, but one thing we can agree on is Devin's hand and wrist is insane, he says. Yeah, yeah. And that's what I felt with Devin. It was hard to do anything...
Engin Terzi: sideways arm with him because he was immobilizing almost everybody's hand and rest um it wasn't the case with levon um as far as sleep goes i mean congratulations devon very there's very few armsters that have that kind of mental control to to know um to be relaxed and and not worry about tomorrow or the next day because that can sap so much energy out of you i mean um
Engin Terzi: yeah, it's, that's, it's a hard thing to overcome, but, um, the people that can do that and just put themselves in a nice cruise, relaxed mode and just, uh, understand that they're going to be a better arm wrestler. Um, they stop, you know, you know, going over it in their head over and over and over again and, uh, you know, wearing themselves out over it. Um, so yeah, no, um, I, I,
Engin Terzi: I think it helped Devin to, you know, if he's truthful with that and he slept like a baby and didn't really put a lot of stress on himself. I think that's the, in my experience, that's the better way to go into a big super match. Wake me up when they call my name, you know, type of thing. Don't be, you know, pacing in the back of the room, you know, even minutes before the match. Yeah, yeah, it would be great.
John Brzenk: And we will see you in Florida, Orlando, August 10th. I think so. I think so. Yeah, we haven't discussed any. Soon, very soon. This East versus West just killed me. It was very tough. Now there is also another event, July 6th, East versus West 13th. And then August 10th, East versus West 14th. So five weeks away from each other. And then you and I, we will talk very soon.
John Brzenk: I hadn't heard about your July match. Is it going to be in other states? No, July is in Istanbul. August is in Orlando. We are planning to do more in the States.
Engin Terzi: That'll be a new challenge for you because the coordination in that is, you've got that seemingly all down pretty well, Pat, in Istanbul. Now that'll be a new challenge to try to get everything organized. I'm not doing by myself. I'm together working like this first event we will be doing together with Chance Shaw.
John Brzenk: Okay. And he will be helping me and later we will also be working with some other people. Right now, John, we have the qualifications for like Australia, Philippines, South Africa, like all over the Europe and South America, North America, I think we had like 16. So it is just growing. It's blowing up. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, congratulations. What's that?
John Brzenk: Congratulations. Congratulations to us, John. We had this potential we just couldn't bring out. But very soon, I hope so, more people will get to know that
John Brzenk: It is not only this, they will understand what kind of muscle groups are involved, how hard it is to coordinate them. And then they respect, the world's respect will grow for us. And trust me, whenever the event finished, I look at WhatsApp, whenever I saw that, you know, you congratulated me for the event, it was a great feeling. When you say... You deserve it. You deserve every bit of the...
Engin Terzi: Excitement and praise. It's a big undertaking that you've decided to pursue. You know me. I had that passion all my life. I told you this a long time ago that if anybody could do it, it was going to be you because you had the mental capacity and the
John Brzenk: desire and the passion for it to be able to pull it off. Yeah, but I couldn't do it without the help of you guys and help of the community. So that's why I'm saying that we all together did it together and it is incredible. So if we see arm wrestling where it deserves to be, that will be the biggest reward. Last two Super Chat ordinary gamers, you are both legends. Have a good one, guys. We are
John Brzenk: Michael Workspace, came late, high legend engine, and got John Orlando. Okay, John, it is almost one hour. Thank you very much for accepting to be my guest. You're welcome. Yeah, we will keep in touch, and please take care of yourself. You are very important for us. For sure, we'll see you in Florida probably here in a few months. Okay, take care. Take care. Bye-bye. Hello to your family.
