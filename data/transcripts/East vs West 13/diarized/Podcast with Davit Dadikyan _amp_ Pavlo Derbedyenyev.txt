Unknown: Hello, guys.
Engin Terzi: hello hello hello everyone very soon uh i don't think i look 10 years younger but i just shaved when i shave my gray beard then it looks a little different but not like
Engin Terzi: Yeah, almost, almost 150,000. I think a few hundred left. Let me see how many left. I don't remember exactly what. Yeah, I think 465 more people and then it will be 150,000.
Engin Terzi: I'm tired. I'm tired, but... Hello, hello, Paul Streng. Good to see you guys. Soon, David and Paolo will join. David is supposed to pull against Devon.
Engin Terzi: And now he's going to pull against Petro Marharint. Very dangerous, very dangerous opponent.
Engin Terzi: August Eric. Hi Engin. Will Laletin vs Morozov best of 5 or 7? My friend, since it is not a world title match, it is best of 5. Only the world title matches are best of 7. Hello Jonathan. Hello. You are the man. You are the man. Get ready. You have a strong opponent in Florida. Yes, Paulo. Paulo is a great guy. Great translator.
Engin Terzi: Great armwrestler, but even greater person as far as my own experience with him. I'm drinking milk with honey. I have sore throat. I watched, yeah, I watched the fight. No, I didn't support anyone.
Engin Terzi: I mean, whoever better won. So it's kind of like, yeah, Dadecim versus Morozov is a right arm match. And they are trying to build their way to the title match. Aleyküm Selam, Samet.
Engin Terzi: I have no doubts that you will be ready, Jonathan. And it will be great to see you again. I know that you improved a lot since last time I saw you.
Engin Terzi: Jerry versus Vitalii, yeah, someday we will hopefully see, but not this time. Jerry wanted to compete in his country instead of Istanbul. He said, I have pulled in Istanbul many times, and first time East versus West is in US. And he says, let me pull in my country. And I said, OK. But it is very hard to get US visa.
Engin Terzi: Thank you, Lasha. Thank you. That is one thing for sure. It is that I'm working hard. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: I was listening to Cristiano Ronaldo and Habib Nurmagomedov and many others. They were talking about talent is important, but dedication, passion, these are more important. And whenever I think of my own athletic career and now as an organizer, yes, the hard work is very, very important.
Engin Terzi: Yes, we are. Yes, we are 115,000, 50,000 subscribers, almost. I think other channel is around like 175, near 175, yeah. Aleyküm selam, cennet kardeşimi.
Engin Terzi: Hello, Victor. Hello, my friend. Ermes already made a video. I also explained when I had a podcast with Devon, I explained what Ermes told me and
Engin Terzi: yeah other channel is growing so quick it is mostly because the shorts that roman makes um we share them on that channel yeah well whenever i had a whatsapp video call with uh georgians there was
Engin Terzi: Genadi, Rewaz, Jamal Wiblyani and some others, they said that Rewaz was 170 kilos. I hope he does some cardio because that, I mean, maybe it helps to have more power, but sometimes if the match is close, you really need good endurance. And in Dubai, all the matches have best of seven.
Engin Terzi: or i should say six rounds if it is three three goes to the extra seven pounds yeah dadikian my friend pirates live um that again is interesting uh because devon
Engin Terzi: will rest. Prudnik is pulling in 105. Rino Masic will be pulling in WAF. He's not planning to compete summer. Ivan with right arm has some shoulder issue. He will be fine, but he will not be ready for July. And then we have Sandris already
Engin Terzi: Yeah, Derekin is right now pulling against Petro Margherini to match the set. How many kilometers of cardio do you prepare? My friend, I usually don't run, but do very fast walking. Usually six kilometers, six, seven, five, depends how I feel.
Engin Terzi: Morozov is pulling Laletin. I don't think that Dalekian ever beaten Marharint. But the last time they pulled was five years ago.
Engin Terzi: Oh, they came. Hello, hello, David. Good, thank you. You? Good, good, good. Good to see you. Yeah. And Paolo also came. I think having connection right now. Hey, hey, hey. I like your t-shirts. I like it.
Engin Terzi: Look at that shoulder, look at the bicep, Paolo. Which one? Surgery would still look incredible. Yeah, but the other one, the right one. Ah, yeah. Still have it. Huge, huge. How old are you, Paolo? I will be 44 in a month. 44, yeah. You don't look like you are losing a lot when you are not.
Paolo Derbedyenyev: when you are not training. It's my natural condition. I was born like this, you know, with a bicep. I heard that. I heard that you're born with 50-something biceps. Is that true? Yeah, yeah. No, for some reason, yeah, you're right. My weight did not drop too much, a couple pounds. But, yeah, I feel okay. Yeah. Okay. You know that...
Engin Terzi: david david was going to pull against devon yes and devon said that he better take some rest and now he's going to pull against petrol margarine yes uh we can say you're your countryman and first of all let's start with uh david what does he think about uh the match cancellation his
Engin Terzi: And then we can continue talking about his match later and maybe even possibility to pull Devon in the future. Can you ask him what does he think about it? Is he upset or is he okay with it? Okay, yeah. David Dano said that everyone knows that you had a match in advance.
Paolo Derbedyenyev: You had a fight with Larratt, then Larratt said that he would rest, but he cancelled it. And now there will be a match with Marguerite, and he has a question for you. How did you react to the fact that Larratt cancelled the match? Were you okay with it, or were you upset and didn't like it?
Davit Dadikyan: Of course, I didn't like it. We agreed with Engin. What depended on Engin, Engin organized everything, agreed with me and with Larratt. Here Larratt already confirmed the fight. We all started to prepare, and then she started to refuse. Honestly, I was very upset, because the form is good, I really wanted to fight him. You know how Larratt always...
Davit Dadikyan: He said that he was ready to fight in any category. But if he knew that he would win, he wouldn't have given up the title fight and the money. That's why I say that he was afraid and didn't want to fight. He was sure that he would win in the 105th category.
Davit Dadikyan: And that he will lose. I don't put myself above him in any way. It's not high. I just evaluate. It would be very difficult. But I'm sure that I would win him in the 105th category. Okay. I heard a lot of Larratt, Larratt, Larratt in the thing. Okay, we wait for his return. That was the question, right? About Larratt, right? Yes, yes, yes. But it was a very long answer, very long answer, yeah.
Paolo Derbedyenyev: yeah so david says that uh uh thank you hanging you organize everything and everything was uh very was going very good and you confirm and he confirmed and everybody confirmed and uh david started his preparation and yeah he's a little bit upset for sure because his form is very good and he's sure that uh
Paolo Derbedyenyev: devon just got a little bit scared uh and he pulled off because if he's sure that he's gonna win and uh you know easy money for him uh he would pull up and just get that win but he got a little you know scared and david is a little bit upset because he is
Paolo Derbedyenyev: pretty much positive that he would pull the win in 105 kg category it's like my form is very good don't don't get me wrong i'm not trying to fly in the clouds but uh you know i'm i'm very very
Paolo Derbedyenyev: uh sure and positive that i would pull up the win with my preparation and my form and yeah then is that he said if he if he is sure about some of the match and he's you know positive that he's gonna pull up and win he will he would do this anyway so that's the answer
Engin Terzi: So basically he's saying that he would beat Devin and Devin knew this and then that's why he canceled the match. Okay, that's interesting. Anyway, so what do you think about this, Paolo? 105 kg.
Paolo Derbedyenyev: very tough uh very tough answer uh devon is devon don't underestimate his right arm but in 105 it's maybe different uh approach and i believe that david has uh
Paolo Derbedyenyev: very good chance to put it this way i don't know it's it's hard to say it's probably a 50 50 answer for me because we still jump pulling in lower classes so the big weight drops a lot of us so um i think it's easier drop and you know he's he's closer to that naturally to that weight uh plus it's uh speed and explosiveness
Engin Terzi: It's not for Devon. Devon is slower puller. So in the wrong position... Okay, does he think that this is a temporary thing or is it gonna happen or not now only? Like it's gonna happen but not now or...
Davit Dadikyan: This will not happen. What does he think? David, I have a question for you. Do you think he's always been like this? Or do you think this will happen one day? No, I don't think so. He's always been like this. If he plans to fight 115 and 105, no matter if he wants it or not, we will meet in any way. Of course, if we both fight for the championship title.
Davit Dadikyan: I hope he will come back soon. I understand that he has given everything he had in the past. He survived everything to fight with Denis, with Ivan. And I also have an understanding with Devon. Because, yes, maybe there are problems with his health. It is necessary to recover. But for this, it was not necessary to just agree. It is necessary to give the duty, to have respect for the athletes too. It was not necessary to just agree. I hope he will come back and we will fight with him.
Paolo Derbedyenyev: David thinks that this is still a temporary decision from Devon, it's not forever and he was still planning to pull 115-105 and David understands that he gave a lot to pull Denis and then pull Levan and
Paolo Derbedyenyev: David says, listen, I understand that he may have some health issues and he need to recover from all of this stuff. Yeah, and he's very respectful to Devon and he said the only thing I would correct in all this situation, he would have to not to agree from beginning because he need to respect
Paolo Derbedyenyev: other athletes too but otherwise uh he hope that he will recover and he will be back and he said we will meet in 105 or 115 because we are close to uh you know belt level so we will most likely meet anyway and what does he think about his uh replacement opponent okay
Davit Dadikyan: David, what do you think about the change, about Marharint? Marharint, so, the prehistory, in a nutshell.
Davit Dadikyan: When I was a junior, I fought up to 21 years old. I was always recorded among men. I won the European and World Championships in my category. I rested for two days and fought among men, seniors, 100 kg. I fought Petro twice, I lost him.
Davit Dadikyan: But I was 18 or 19 at the time. He really beat me. I didn't feel it once. I started, he caught me and won easily. And the second time, if I'm not mistaken, I fought with him. I also performed, rested for two days. And among the men at the European Championships, we reached the semi-finals with him. And he beat me in the semi-finals.
Davit Dadikyan: Unfortunately, my elbow fell off and I lost the fight. I took 3rd place, he took 2nd place. I lost twice. So when I offered to fight with him, I agreed without even thinking.
Davit Dadikyan: Because, yes, in my heart it's not calm. I treat Petro very respectfully, he's a very calm, good guy. It's just a sport interest. Just to show that David was 18-19 years old. A lot has changed. We need to show a new level.
Paolo Derbedyenyev: David said that they have a little history with Petro and when he was when David was pulling in juniors back in the days he was also pulling in the seniors so he basically was usually winning European or World Championships juniors category
Paolo Derbedyenyev: then he would have arrested there or two and he would pull 100 kg seniors and he pulled petro twice in senior category after juniors uh and both times he lost first time he lost like petro petro did not even uh felt him so he lost easy uh and second time they had a match but uh he fell out david david fouled out and uh
Engin Terzi: Petro won again so those two matches that we saw were they were senior category matches yes okay okay
Paolo Derbedyenyev: Yeah, but David was like 18 and 19 years old at that time. And he said, listen, when Engin proposed Petro, I said yes right away because I own him. And I want to prove that David now is a little bit different than David was, you know, a couple of years ago. Yeah, yeah. And what do you like?
Paolo Derbedyenyev: What do you think about Petro Marharint, Paolo? Yeah, I think he is genetically super gifted. He is an amazing athlete. If he can win this time, I don't think so, to be honest. I think I would slightly give it to David. But slightly, because Marharint... Was that 55-45? Yes, yes, close enough. 55-45. But yeah, David is favorite, in my opinion.
Paolo Derbedyenyev: that's the problem if he would constantly training can go to the tournaments he would probably be on the same level but because of the breaks and uh inconsistency in training that's why i think i think he's going he's going up right now and he still has uh not two months but one and a half months he has i think for sure he will be better than last time we saw him
Engin Terzi: And David, what do you think about this guy, Petro Marharint? Not only against you, but this guy has wins against Deserano, against Sandris, against John Brzee, against Sabine, against Ravas, Ongarbev. This guy has beaten many, many top athletes. Where do you think his level? What do you think about him?
Paolo Derbedyenyev: David, what do you think about Petro as an athlete? He has won almost all the famous athletes, like Brzenk, Dziranov, Angarbaev, Rivas. He has won almost all of them. What do you think about him as an athlete?
Davit Dadikyan: He's a very strong athlete. I don't think there are any weak athletes who reach the title and want to compete. And I hope Engin understands that he's a well-deserved athlete. That's why he's giving such a fight. He's very strong. He's genetically gifted. He has a wide palm. It's uncomfortable. I just remember these feelings when I fought for his hand. It was as uncomfortable as possible. But, as I said, times change.
Davit Dadikyan: We don't stand on the same spot. When I fought Hutchings, everyone said that Hutchings always wins against John, Irakli, Angarbaev, Ibragim Sagov. It will be hard.
Davit Dadikyan: To be honest, I'm not looking for easy ways. That's why I'm happy to fight strong guys. I'm happy, very happy. That's why I'm also gaining form. I probably didn't have this form either. I hope that this form will be stronger than the fight with Hutchings.
Paolo Derbedyenyev: uh yeah a huge respect to margarine and he said that he is very very genetically gifted athlete his uh hand is super thick and wide and very uncomfortable and he is extremely strong and uh yeah but david said that listen uh i'm
Paolo Derbedyenyev: I understand that he's been winning with a lot of people, and there is no weak people on that level, right? So, yeah, he also said, listen, when I've been pulling Hutchings, everybody's been telling that, you know, Hutchings has wins over blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, the whole list, right? And he said, listen, I am not looking for easy routes, and I understand that it's going to be hard, but I'm getting my form to the peak level where I've never been before, so we will see.
Engin Terzi: Pablo, can you ask him, compared to five years ago, now he believes that he will win, is it because he got stronger or he also has some plan? Like, did he analyze...
Engin Terzi: Petro's weaknesses, if there is anything. Does he think that there is a way to beat him more possibly than the way to different ways? Is he going to try something different compared to the last time?
Paolo Derbedyenyev: David, you haven't fought for the last five years. You fought for the last time five years ago. Engin asks, do you think you can win because you've become so much stronger? Or do you have a specific plan already developed? How are you going to fight him? And have you already analyzed the athlete and developed your own strategic and tactical scheme? I will be as always honest.
Paolo Derbedyenyev: Probably that's why many people don't like me. Everyone says I'm aggressive, I'm disrespectful to everyone, but I'm telling the truth.
Davit Dadikyan: That's why I don't like people. At the World Cup, I was on the right side. But when I became a professional, I went to the dark side. And then I was 19 years old. Without fear of this word, I probably became twice stronger.
Davit Dadikyan: Strengths, technical aspects. I finished my judo career. I trained for a year and became the European champion. When I fought with Petro, I trained in armwrestling for a couple of years. Roughly speaking. I haven't been in armwrestling for so long. I beat Pavel. Beat. Where the hand goes, it goes there. I imagined that I was a thinking athlete. There was some kind of special training. I was physically strong, I was a professional judo player, so I fought.
Davit Dadikyan: I'm not bragging, but my form is completely different. Evgeny if I don't analyze Petro's fight, I understand how he fights. I have in my head what I'm going to do in the first, second, third round.
Davit Dadikyan: Evgeny if I don't take it, I think I've changed. Because the years go by, and I'm relatively young, I'm only 25. So I think I've added a lot of things to fitness. So I'm sure, God willing, I'll win. Okay, I'll translate.
Paolo Derbedyenyev: I will try to do as close as possible." Okay, so he said, listen, I will be honest and many people saying that I may be aggressive sometimes, but I'm always telling the truth.
Paolo Derbedyenyev: so basically back in the days in uh five six years ago he was pulling involved championships and he was uh uh it was a tested events and uh david was following the rules he was not using any farm supports at that times now he became a professional athlete and he can you can you tell me that did he say that he's like a judo champion or something
Paolo Derbedyenyev: yes later hold on yeah yeah yeah you don't need to go there but more i am interested part is that what you see that's the thing to beat him in any kind of different technique so so you're coming to that and give one second so no no just just pay directly go there please paulo yes yes now he became a professional athlete and he's probably double strong as he used to be now he at that time he used to do arm wrestling for about two years
Paolo Derbedyenyev: And he was not technically, you know, technically good. He was going just into the position where he felt it's good. And he was not thinking about actual positioning. Before that, he was doing judo professionally. And he became a very strong, physically very strong and powerful human being. That's why he was able to go in arm wrestle. Artem wrestle because of his...
Paolo Derbedyenyev: yes exactly on that level but he was not technically good right now after all these years he said i'm completely different athlete competing completely different human being he believes that he is double strong and absolutely yes technical abilities and he said even if i would not analyze petro i would probably have a good chance
Paolo Derbedyenyev: yeah but he's saying that he is strong enough to win anyway but he said i did i analyzed and i have my plan for first round third round i know what i'm gonna do and where i'm gonna pull
Engin Terzi: Yeah, the thing is that Petro Marharint has very strong hand and wrist that always starts the match first because of so strong coping. And we know that David is also an aggressive starter at the table. Does he think that his start will be more effective than Marharint's or does he think that he will be put a little bit to the B side and then win?
Engin Terzi: Because the impact of Marharint is usually whenever the match starts, boom. Because he's very strong, the opponent usually loses the pronator right from the beginning.
Paolo Derbedyenyev: David, the question is that everyone knows that Petro has a very strong wrist, and at the start he always turns his wrist first, and it turns out that his opponent usually loses his pronator a little, but at the start he usually wins. But everyone also knows that you have everything in order with your wrist, and you are very explosive and fast. What do you think at the start, who is better, who is faster, who is stronger?
Davit Dadikyan: If the exhibition will be at the highest level, what happens, we hope. The main thing for Petro is not to let him get in here. I don't know how Khachis fights, but he has a uniformity. Well, with all due respect, he is not a versatile athlete. He, of course, we know, he climbs here into the hook. He has big fingers, he immediately tries to separate the pronation. Here, honestly, who will have time.
Davit Dadikyan: I don't know how he's going to react. But even if he's in the right position, as our grandfather Hutchings showed us, you can pull him out of there. So I hope that I'll get this form in the right way and not let Petro get in first. So I'm already ready, Pavel. I'm ready to fight.
Paolo Derbedyenyev: Okay. Yeah, he's saying that, yes, absolutely. If the setup will be good, then it really depends on who will start first. Because, yeah, if Petro will be captain behind his shoulder a little bit.
Paolo Derbedyenyev: That's probably said, yeah, I understand that. So basically, he's getting ready to be very effective start. But as he also said that, listen, with grandpa Hutchings, I already showed that even with a little bit losing position, I can still be effective.
Engin Terzi: yeah yeah yeah usually he was winning when when hutchings took him to do like uh that he can lose inside him to bring the match back from there it was just something that we didn't imagine did you follow no because i pulled i pulled hutchings a few months back and uh yeah i was trying to do the same uh what david did during the match and uh
Paolo Derbedyenyev: i know exactly what are we talking about i know exactly amount of power and uh explosiveness it takes to bring him from that position anywhere else it's to me it's impossible um can you ask david if he wins three world title matches he already won one if he wins three matches and then it will mean that like he will permanently have the belt
Paolo Derbedyenyev: Will he continue 105 or he will just pull heavier category? David, the question is this. If you win three belts in a row, 105 belts, three belts in a row, this belt will be yours for life. Will you continue to fight in 105 or will you go up?
Paolo Derbedyenyev: Andy, what does Hutchings mean? I don't get it. Yes, he says that he fought with Hutchings. We saw what positions David took. I told him that I fought with Hutchings in training.
Paolo Derbedyenyev: About 3-4 months ago. And I gave him a position like you did. I couldn't do anything, I couldn't get him out of there. I said, yes, I know. I represent the level and the amount of power that is needed to get him out of your position. Thank you very much. I know what you're talking about.
Davit Dadikyan: To be honest, every time I say that I'm not going to fight in the 105 category, but something happens every time. The left got injured, Irakli won, they offered a fight with Hutchings. Then now Petro, with whom there are unclosed accounts, I want to fight with him. Weight is floating all the time. Evgeny two months ago, I weighed 120 kilograms after Hutchings.
Davit Dadikyan: I gained a lot of weight and felt very comfortable. Now I started working a lot, I'm already weighing 115 kg, plus or minus. Pushing 10 kg is hard, but I'm used to it. I was a judo player, I pushed all my life. I'm used to it. For now, it's interesting. Maybe our ambitions will rise above me, and I'll just fight in the 115-105 category. I want to run forward, everything is God's will.
Davit Dadikyan: How can I put it? Let it be. I can't say for sure. I don't know. Maybe Larratt will come back in the 105th. I'll stay for Larratt. I'm 100% sure. If I win everything, I'll stay for Larratt. David says that, you know what, I cannot answer for sure because so far it's very interesting. Very interesting athletes.
Paolo Derbedyenyev: uh and he said yeah i know i did say many times uh that i will never go back again and i will not drop the weight but is that some always something happening which is you know
Paolo Derbedyenyev: promoting me to go back there in 105 which is he said yeah it's a little bit hard but he's been doing this whole year's life in judo and now in arm wrestling so he said yeah my weight is always floating a little bit and uh sometimes he's waiting up to 120 kilos but uh he said i feel pretty comfortable at 122.
Paolo Derbedyenyev: but right now he start working out a little more intense and right now he's 115. he said yeah no problem and i comment maybe maybe larat will come back he said for larat i will stay in 105 for as long as it's required i i won't learn what what what if someone else comes and beat him david yes
Paolo Derbedyenyev: He said, I hope it's not going to happen, Sever. Michael challenged him. David you hear about that? Michael Todd. David you hear what he said? Yes, Michael Todd. Let's go, my friend.
Davit Dadikyan: I think he can reach 115 kg. That's why he's so big. I think he's perfect for 115-105 kg. Michael also needs to fight for his retirement. People are getting tired. We need to give young people a place. They don't want to, but they can.
Davit Dadikyan: Yes, Michael. Well, listen, he's gaining class. He's already a good form. I'm very respectful to everyone. I love this sport, I love all athletes. It's such a small family and you can't spoil the relationship here. Only jokes, only respect for each other.
Davit Dadikyan: I'm glad. I've never imagined that I could fight Todd Hutchings. I was into this sport. I watched their fights. They were somewhere far away. I don't know, in another dimension. And also Michael Todd. I'm watching him now. You can fight with Larratt. It's a great honor for me. I'm glad. I enjoy all this. So everything works out, thank God, well.
Paolo Derbedyenyev: Yeah, David is saying, yeah, absolutely. I know, Michael Todd, let's go. He said, yeah, listen, 1.15, 1.05, whatever, it's all normal weights, let's meet. It's time to send Michael to retirement, you know, that's all. Does he not think that his style is very difficult?
Paolo Derbedyenyev: defeat hold on let me finish oh okay and then he said okay jokes aside uh i love everybody i respect everybody and yes we can pull and he said listen when i just started the sport not that long ago i've been watching those movies with that hutchinson all these top athletes and they was in some you know different uh
Paolo Derbedyenyev: scale you know you you cannot now i'm pulling them and winning and on the same level and there is a warrant there we can you know it's it's a possibility and he said yeah absolutely i would pull anybody i would challenge anybody which one would be more difficult to defeat uh michael or devon okay yeah that one is more complicated
Engin Terzi: Okay if he pulls if he would pull against Devon it would be 105 title but right now it can be 115 but interim title most likely. I still haven't decided.
Engin Terzi: It depends on when Devin is going to be back because he just got out of super heavyweight. But if he is not planning to pull in September or October, for sure the title will go away. Can you also ask him, we saw him a little bit training with Zaur left arm. Is left arm coming back or not yet?
Paolo Derbedyenyev: He says, we all saw that, well, first of all, sorry, I will translate, he says about Larratt, he says, listen, well, fight with Larratt, I still haven't decided how it will happen, when he will come back there, he says, if he doesn't come back there until, say, September, then he will lose his belt in the 115th category, because he has been saying for a very long time, therefore, well, it is not clear where you will meet, there may be a belt in the 115th, there may be a belt in the 115th, somehow differently, in general, he has decided yet.
Paolo Derbedyenyev: Yes, and then... Zaur. Zaur. Everyone saw the training with Zaur on the left hand. He says, well, are you coming back? What's going on on the left? What's the story on the left? After Prudnik, there was already a two-time fracture, a partial burr. How long has it been? Almost a year. Well, okay, not a year, but...
Davit Dadikyan: I don't think I did anything, I don't feel any pain. I went to a festival in Siberia, where I had to lift a heavy weight with a bicep, lift a heavy weight with a barbell, and do it with a hand, maybe you saw that I lifted 90 kilos. I did these three exercises in the morning, and then I fought with Zaur. And he had Zaur Arfait Silayev.
Davit Dadikyan: If he was tired, I would be tired. There is no such thing as someone who is fresh or not fresh. Yes, the hand feels good, but, you know, probably only once. After that, last week, with my left hand, I couldn't even lift my training bag.
Davit Dadikyan: The doctors told me to do an operation to completely remove it and at least a year or two to stop. I can't decide on an operation. I think I'm starting to add a little bit, add some maximum weights, fight with someone, and again the pain starts to disturb me. I don't know why. Make up your mind, David. He made up his mind at 44.
Paolo Derbedyenyev: Probably, yes. Probably, I need to do it and calm down and start preparing normally. That's how I decided for myself, too. I was running, running, I didn't want to, I didn't want to, I was pulling, pulling, I couldn't train anymore, I thought, no, well, I'll do it, we'll see, I'll recover. How long did you stop?
Paolo Derbedyenyev: maybe can we tell people because they they just don't understand anything okay translating sorry uh okay yeah david says that uh yes uh there is a little history we've been training together
Paolo Derbedyenyev: uh uh before that training uh david did some uh arm lifts like uh strict curl bicep curl and then some uh hand lifting arm lifting and then some uh handle curling and the super match with life so they both was a little bit on the tire side but you know it's he said it's it's kind of okay but uh
Paolo Derbedyenyev: for one single pull, maybe. And then next day, he's dying from a pain. He cannot even lift his training bag. So he checked with the doctors, and doctors saying, to eliminate this problem completely, he needs some kind of surgery. And he's pushing that away. And I said, you know what? I've been pushing that away for probably two years. And finally, at my age, and he's very young, I decided I'll try to fix it, and I'll try to come back, and we'll see if it's possible.
Davit Dadikyan: instead of, you know, just sitting and waiting. So I try to convince him that. Yeah, so basically, basically, without surgery, he will not be ready with left arm. He says, well, so far you're not ready with the left one, right? So far you're going to... Yes, yes, yes, I'm... I don't want to hurry, so as not to make things worse again. I'm only for... My left is much stronger than my right. Well, I used to be only for the left. Now I'm fighting for the right, only for the right.
Paolo Derbedyenyev: In the near future, I will make an operation and return to the left. Not yet, not yet. He's working on it. He will make a decision either that way or another way. He will bring it back in the nearest future because he thinks his left is much, much better than his right. So that's what it is. There is a super chat that
Paolo Derbedyenyev: What does Devon think about Denis' shape for Hermes? David he have a chance if he didn't cancel the match?
Davit Dadikyan: Well, I can't say that, because I'm with Denis, we train together, I see such a person, and we understood that
Davit Dadikyan: There is a problem with health. The fact that a person was pushed to go for an analysis. We saw that a person cannot take the right form, it affects health. Therefore, it is impossible to assess this, it will be incorrect. If the athlete had a good form, they probably would not have canceled this fight. Therefore, yes, the form was not the same, there were problems with health, so it was canceled, it's a pity.
Paolo Derbedyenyev: okay yeah david saying listen uh i cannot really correctly comment on this because there is a health issues and that's exactly why this was cancelled because dennis health did you know not let him to gain a proper form to pull aramis and that's exactly why the match was cancelled so that's that's the best comment they can make okay okay and let's talk a little bit about the dubai matches
Engin Terzi: David, who is going to win? Schoolboy or Ryan Bowen? Schoolboy or Ryan Bowen. Who will win in Dubai? Schoolboy. Schoolboy, okay. Lachlan Adair versus Pauline.
Engin Terzi: Do you think Dzeranov is stronger or is his stamina better?
Paolo Derbedyenyev: He said Zeranoff is very interesting. He's usually giving away or losing the first two matches and then he's kicking in and start winning. So probably that's what's going to happen again. Zeranoff will get tired.
Paolo Derbedyenyev: you know the guy lars from norway they beat valera you remember david lars is norwegian lars okay why because you want he wants to pull michael okay
Engin Terzi: Okay. He said, yeah, yeah, it's easy. If he will gonna lose that, you know, our match will not gonna happen. Okay. Okay. I understand. And let's go to the next one. Morozov versus Ivan Matyushenko. Morozov.
Paolo Derbedyenyev: How much chance does Matyushenko have, according to David? And what must he do to win? What do you think Matyushenko has in terms of chances to win? And what does he have to do to win? I just know how strong Morozov is, how tough he is. Knowing Matyushenko, he doesn't like to do long fights.
Davit Dadikyan: That's why Morozov has a good form. He can score 80-20. Wow! Yes, he's brave. I respect him, I repeat, both are good, but I know Morozov, I fought with him, and I look at him and say, Morozov is good, very good.
Paolo Derbedyenyev: He said that with all the respect, if Morozov will bring the form he's usually in, not sick or something, the good form, then he said like 80-20, because Morozov is very, very good. He said, with all the respect to Matyushenko, he's been pulling both of the athletes, and he said, yeah, Morozov is a different level. And he said Matyushenko doesn't even like, you know, the prolongated matches here with...
Paolo Derbedyenyev: fast match and that's it but he said yeah no not with morozov he's endured he's very strong he said yeah and i know he is friend with laletin but camille versus vitality um david don't you think that when somebody
Engin Terzi: over pronate they are vulnerable to this one because you're going this way and you are only on brachioradialis but do you think that the match may go strap and then there is a chance or not at all do you remember your your training with laletin laletin took your wrist but he had very hard time to beat you you were like this
Paolo Derbedyenyev: You don't think that if someone is playing too far, deep, then he will be strapped and the position will be uncomfortable. Do you remember when you were training with Laletin, he was hitting your wrist, but it was very hard for him to hit you. Don't you think that it can be such an uncomfortable position for Vitalii?
Davit Dadikyan: Vitalii pulled me here. He was trying to pull me. He pulled my wrist, but he was trying to pull me. He made a mistake by not being able to pull me back.
Davit Dadikyan: As for Jablonski, if you judge him correctly, it's not like he won against Larratt, when he was standing like this. If his shoulders are parallel to the table, it's even. I'm more than sure, he just needs to stretch a little from himself. That's how I see it. He's a very strong athlete, but if his one-sided movement passes, he can't offer anything else.
Davit Dadikyan: He's probably strong. If I were to imagine my good form, if he were to climb up there, I probably wouldn't pull him out. Because he has a lot of power.
Paolo Derbedyenyev: Yeah, okay. Yeah, David commented, he said, yes, that's right. But Vitalii, when he was training with Vitalii and David, he was trying to pull him straight back. He was not pronating enough to take completely his wrist.
Paolo Derbedyenyev: but he said uh you know with yablonsky it's a little bit different situation because yablonsky is super powerful and in his move this is like wow he said he realizes that right he realizes that he knows that but he said that that's the only one move and if the italy knows how to pull him and will separate him a little bit farther from his body and if referees will put both outlets you know square shoulders to the table he said
Paolo Derbedyenyev: you know this is it if he cannot go into his move it's over yeah but what if he goes into his but if he's there that's it he said yeah he said if i would pull yablonski and i would let him go into his move
Engin Terzi: He said, I don't think I would be able to pull up. I don't know if anybody can really hold him in losing position. I tried to. I tried to. I tried to in after pull at the knuckles. Too much pressure, right? Too strong pressure, yeah. If you stretch Yeblonsky a little bit here, so that he doesn't have his shoulder, a little stretch, yes, you can pull him out. But when he just sits from top to bottom on his hand,
Paolo Derbedyenyev: But I don't think anyone can pull him out of there. It's very hard. That's exactly what he said. I don't think anyone can pull him out if he's in his position. Yes, yes, yes. David, confirm what you just said. He said if you will pull him out of the body a little bit, maybe something. But if he said if he's in his position, I don't think anybody will be able to pull out. Yeah, I agree. And can you ask David?
Engin Terzi: Who does he think that... Okay, first, before that one. Which way is easier to beat Laletin? Top roll? Hook? Or this? I'm not saying when it's easier. Which one would be more effective if it is done in a good way, strong way?
Paolo Derbedyenyev: What is the right way for Vitalii to win, in your opinion? Through the top, into the hook, or through the flap press? Through the top, into the hook, or through the flap press?
Davit Dadikyan: Well, my task when I fought him, when I stood with him, he stands like this. Well, he puts his hand a little higher, he has long wrists, and it was hard for me with my short ones. So I tried to do as much as possible. Well, yes, I saw it for myself. The emphasis, of course, is on the lower fingers, to twist more. The main task, yes... Hello, Vitalii.
Davit Dadikyan: The main thing is to twist it, right? If you don't try to stretch it to yourself, it will immediately stand like a lever. If you give it to the pronation, break it a little and pull it a little diagonally here. It turns out how I tried here. There is one fight when I was able to twist.
Davit Dadikyan: And it's easy for me to put my hand on it. So the main task is to disconnect the pronation and try not to put it in the corner, but diagonally, in the corner, to stretch it. That's how I see it. Almost everyone with long elbows is almost the same. Yes, yes, yes. I don't see the point in that.
Paolo Derbedyenyev: David commented from his perspective. He said, listen, I cannot tell you in general because everybody's different, different arms and stuff. But when he was pulling with him, he said that he's being accenting on bottom two fingers.
Paolo Derbedyenyev: and just cup a little bit inside to take his pronator a little bit out. And he said, listen, when I managed to do that in one of the, you know, sparrings, he said it was relatively easy to pull in and just finish his arm. It was stretching relatively easy. He said there is not really much chances for anybody to go top roll him. It's like...
Engin Terzi: yeah also also hook him is very hard he keeps himself far low hand top row it's very hard to hook him in that's that's that's this was the only way he could you know just twist his pronator a little bit out and then
Engin Terzi: You remember, Hermes finished him a few rounds with a dead risk. Dave Sheffield with a dead risk. So I think Jerry, Jablonski, I think these kind of guys are the most dangerous for him. I'm not saying they can beat him, but I think he's the most dangerous. What? You were saying, David? Sorry. David, what did you say?
Davit Dadikyan: Yes, I remember only one Arsene Liliev. Vitalii passed through the top of the Russian championship. I remember that. And Vitalii had such a break at the very end, closer to victory. With such short arms, Arsene Liliev. Right here, he went through the top. David says he only remembers one time that Arsene Liliev taprolled him.
Engin Terzi: At that time, he was 85-90 kilos. He was very skinny. This time, it's getting a little bit harder. When the weight category is bigger, it is always in the advantage of Vitalii. Because he was too skinny for lighter weight. When we talk about Arsene,
Engin Terzi: David, do you think that if Arsene makes a comeback and becomes as good as before, do you think that he has a chance to win 105kg category? He says if Arsene comes back and becomes as cool as he used to be, does he have a chance to win the 105kg category? Of course he does, of course he does. I repeat, I grew up on all these guys, more precisely on the videos of these guys.
Davit Dadikyan: I watched it and even in some parts I compared this explosive start with the whole start, because he was also crazy about explosive. A little different direction, through the top-side, but many compared that you are also more like Arsen Lilleev, such an explosive.
Davit Dadikyan: He said, yeah, I'm pretty sure that he has very good chances.
Paolo Derbedyenyev: and he said i basically grew up on videos of him pulling and he took a lot of uh you know tips from his uh style and how he pulls with his my explosiveness i've been training to get to his level yes it's different styles outside inside but explosiveness and actual start he like it's amazing when you say like different outside inside does
Paolo Derbedyenyev: David considers himself as an inside puller? David, I said that you have different styles with Arsen, but what is it? Top or bottom? He says, he interrupted me a little bit, he says, ask David, he thinks that he is an inside puller, that is, he is more of a bottom. How again? Well, that you are more of a bottom, that is, a hook, you think.
Davit Dadikyan: On the left, yes. On the right, I fought with Irakli in the top. With Todd, the first fight was in the top, then in the hook. I think I did better in the top than in the hook.
Paolo Derbedyenyev: uh yeah david said that left for sure hook but right he said i don't know lately probably my top roll is getting better than my hook on the right hand side and and um david if car touching goes down to 95 kilo what do you think about his chances against exactly
Paolo Derbedyenyev: He asks, if Hutchings goes to the 95th category, what are his chances with Irakli? Probably he will win.
Davit Dadikyan: Maybe he will win. Because I remember when we weighed with Hutchings, I was running 14 kg for Hutchings. And he became 104 kg on the scales. 104.5 kg, in my opinion. And he said he didn't run. Therefore, with the same weight, with this physique down, he will have a great advantage. Why do I run? I train in the 115 category, I understand the large scales, I run and it turns out that I add weight and it is more comfortable for me.
Davit Dadikyan: David thinks that Hutchings is going to win.
Paolo Derbedyenyev: He's because he was not cutting any weight and he was at 104. He said that's, you know, relatively easy for him to cut to 95 and then gain back a little bit and he will be in a very good, good shape. And he said with all the respects to the other guys that he thinks that Hutchings is going to win. Okay. And another thing I want to ask him, who does he think that
Davit Dadikyan: Number one left arm in the world right now. Who do you think is number one left-handed today? What provocative questions, huh? I don't even know what to answer. It's his job. I don't even know what to answer. Well, at the moment, Morozov. Okay, don't count yourself. Get yourself out of the list. I'm sick.
Davit Dadikyan: To be honest, it would be interesting to watch Alizhan's fight. Recently, when he gained weight and won the World Championship, I couldn't imagine that he was so strong, because his roster was so-so.
Davit Dadikyan: Plus, he won, no questions asked. But I haven't seen guys like him. But when he's tough, like Hermes, and I see that he's a very good guy, I like his style of fighting. It would be interesting for me if he lifted a little weight and fought with Morozov. I'm not talking about Matyushenko at all, to be honest. I think Matyushenko will pass easily in one fight.
Paolo Derbedyenyev: uh okay uh david started with uh uh yeah he said i will eliminate myself from the list because i'm ill so uh he said morozov is number one
Paolo Derbedyenyev: as of right now but he said a lot about uh muratov he said yeah it was uh when he will even he won the worlds it was you know check mark but he said you know what there was nobody real real good and he said whatever sure but when he start pulling one another and was easy goes through prudnik through uh Hermes said he is extremely strong he said I want to see he would uh
Paolo Derbedyenyev: bring his weight a little bit up and pull with morozov that's the most interesting question
Davit Dadikyan: — I don't know. I just can't evaluate it. I see Morozov more. Because it's a controversial question with Laletin. And Morozov is not one-sided. He can already get into the hook, fight with him. These are interesting, long fights that happened. So, no, I see Morozov. For now, Morozov.
Paolo Derbedyenyev: Yeah, he said Laletin is somewhere there for sure, but he said not yet that I can tell that he's, you know, getting number one. He's seeing Morozov. Okay. How does he see the Morozov beating Laletin? He said that he is very, you know,
Paolo Derbedyenyev: can pull in very different ways and he can you know uh hook and he can do many different things and do that for a long period of time and he's very endured so he's seeing morozov to be number one okay i understand and and david did you see sasha versus samusha
Davit Dadikyan: It's a tough question. He said, I cannot answer who's going to win, but he wants that Samushia will win. Okay. Okay. I understand.
Engin Terzi: Okay, we will see. We will see how it will be and next year Levan will come back with left arm and then everything will be more and more clear and more fun, you know. And anyway, so David, thank you very much, my friend. Thank you for being my guest here. And Paolo, as always, you know that you are not a translator. You are a friend and you are an arm master and you are a knowledgeable guy.
Engin Terzi: Thank you very much for coming again and helping. And maybe hope to see you in July event, maybe, to help the translation in Istanbul. David you already talk or not? Yeah, but I don't have an answer yet, no. Oh, okay. I don't have a clear answer. It's, you know, it's still out there. By the way, your crap is screaming, you know, just like, they soon will leave here and then they will,
Engin Terzi: they will have independence from your body you know three months no training at all yeah but i i cannot believe that your shoulder is still like a watermelon look at the shoulder you know i don't understand anyways david thank you very much my friend once again thank you thank you see you next time yeah
