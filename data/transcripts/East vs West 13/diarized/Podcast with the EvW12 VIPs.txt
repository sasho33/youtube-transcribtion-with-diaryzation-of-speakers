Engin Terzi: Hello, hello everyone. I know this is a sudden one, but I have been very busy and just didn't have time to announce
Rainis: Let me share on social media and be back. Hello, David. Hello, Spitz. Hello to Portugal.
Engin Terzi: Hello, Rainis. Hello to Latvia. Or anybody ask? It is coffee with a lot of milk. Or maybe I should say milk with little coffee.
Rainis: hello p3 and j sorry about this my eyes are not good i don't have time to um your hospital maybe and then check my eye oh hello
Henry: hello hello hello pay doctor how are you it's very good yeah so also engen i never got your payment so i'm starting to think i'm sorry very frustrated because everyone on the internet is telling me that i'm supposed to be getting money and i never got it so yeah yeah yeah you never get it yeah i'm sorry i think you are the only person
Engin Terzi: in this community that i promised about payment and i didn't pay you know very sorry about it yeah not only that i want i want a raise for the next event because i did such a good job this event yeah yeah i kind of forget how much did i i promised you to pay all the pay-per-view sales every every single one yeah come on this is uh probably i was drunk when i said that even though i i don't use alcohol at all
Henry: Oh, hey, we got the other guys here. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Daniel and Tyler.
Henry: yeah so i invited daniel because i was on his podcast and then skyler i spent a lot of time with so i was like i don't know who to pick but these were my these were the two people that came to mind your buddies yeah well what can i say except thank you very much henry and obviously to you and thank you for for inviting me here hello skyler how you doing what's up what's up daniel henry engen how's it going buddy
Engin Terzi: Yeah, everything is good. I didn't realize that we were live. I thought we were just one on one with Henry. And I kind of admitted that I pay him and I couldn't remember how much I pay him. I promised to pay him to be paid actor. And he said that I had I promised him to pay all of the pay per view.
Henry: oh yeah yeah of course and also again also again that was the deal that you gave to them too you get three times the pay-per-view money you were going to give to us okay so i i i sell one pay-per-view and then i pay three paper money yes yeah i'm very smart about this business everyone who hates on the internet they were right from the beginning east first west was a scam this was some big you know from the very beginning this was a robbery you know
Engin Terzi: yeah absolutely man it was very well done very well done anyway it's great great to see you guys again great to see friends you faces again so yeah same same did you guys enjoy absolutely i mean absolutely
Skyler: Yeah, it was a great event. I definitely think that some of the matches were just so good. I think it was definitely the greatest event to date, in my opinion, for sure. And many people shared Harry's reaction. They said, Engin, I was the same way.
Engin Terzi: when i was watching paper paper with this yeah yeah i've seen a lot of people say that they were like you know doing the exact same thing at home just oh my god yeah yeah yeah i think like maybe not everybody showed that but that's how everybody felt you know yeah yeah i was like this i was like round one and devon we cannot say that devon stopped leon it seemed like more like leon stopped
Engin Terzi: Devon, you know, because I think Devon first went a little bit, you know, to the winning side. He did, proud of Serge. Yeah, and I was like, what is happening? It's round one, you know. Evgeny if it was a stop on round one, we were expecting something here, you know, not here. So I looked back at my previous prediction on the previous live stream, and I was exactly correct except for one part,
Henry: I said if Devin never got a stop, it would be like this. But I had predicted that LeVon would press him, but I never thought that he would get stopped in the center and then also be able to press him after he got stopped in the center. Okay, I checked on many people for that.
Henry: You wanted that one, right? Well, I had money on it, so I wanted LeBron to win. As a fan, I didn't care. The truth is, I'm not a fan of anybody. I am an arm wrestling fan who just shows up and wants to see a match. You know what? There's a person...
Henry: permanent permanent game for arm wrestling yeah like literally if devin uh retires from arm wrestling tomorrow i will still watch if everybody quit arm wrestling we saw all new athletes i would still watch and like i just love the sport of arm wrestling
Henry: So because of that, because of that, like going into it, I'm not picking sides. I'm just like purely emotionless. I don't care who wins. I just want to know that too. But yeah. So before the match, I was like,
Henry: you know i want my prediction to be correct so i'm rooting for lavon i have some cash so i also want to get lavon and then i was telling all the other vips how certain i was lavon to win so you can see after that match skyler's pointing at me like i told you so and i was like
Henry: You know, shit, Skylar looks a little bit correct, but, you know, I have to remain confident. And there was another guy in the audience, I believe, I think is Mike. He's pointing at me like, I told you so, Henry, I told you so. But the moment I saw that press, I was like, there's no chance because he could next round shoot for the same press.
Engin Terzi: so thank you very much i was feeling pretty good i was feeling pretty good for levon after that because okay daniel those two guys from azerbaijan the big guys who did they support they're from georgia georgia yeah i mean i know oh they are from georgia um georgia you mean they are sumanali azerbaijan but they live in georgia yeah because that's how we speak the same language yeah yeah they were they were supporting obviously levon yes oh they were from oh okay okay so the the the center
Daniel: Three was all Levan. Yes. Okay. Then we're rooting for every Georgian. Like every Georgian, you see them screaming and shouting. Yeah. Absolutely. Absolutely. And you, Daniel, who did you support? So, I mean, obviously on the paper, as many people as like Levan has...
Daniel: everything but you know under the the underdog and the beautiful story about it like if that one can make it somehow so i was like yeah i'm going to support that one but obviously i just um on the first round like everybody else when when i stopped the match there on the center i went crazy like all the guys and and then i enjoyed the match but yeah i was like okay i'm going to root for that one because he's he's the underdog and there's you know the beautiful story about separation and so well but yeah i i i supported that one on the match
Skyler: And you too, right, Skyler? Yeah, yeah. I mean, I'm a fellow North American, so of course I supported Devin in the match.
Skyler: it's just it's a very weird match to me like if you would have told me that devin stopped at center in round one and we could have made any bet after that i would have bet a lot i would have lost a lot of money a lot yeah me too skylar i'm with you too you can see my shock in that moment that's me going oh i lost you know what i'm saying that that's me thinking like skyler's gonna make so much fun of me at dinner and it will be like that's what that reaction is
Skyler: it was just a friendly bet so it was nothing like that but i will say that i i
Skyler: way i felt was i felt like devon really did exert almost 100 of everything he had in that first round to get that stop and you can see it in his face like as soon as levon started transitioning to the press devon was 100 maxed out 100 maxed out and you can also see after that each round after that levon kind of changed direction just a smidgen and it changed everything and you can tell that
Engin Terzi: once again that LaVon was the one that gassed Devin which is unheard of you know so it was just a very interesting like this it's not like you know because like it is not like they are close and that level is better in the roots but it is like one guy could apply 85 percent while the other guy apply 100 percent of the first start and get the advantage and then but whenever
Engin Terzi: that the shoulder pressure happened that all that pressure and he resisted i think there he got damaged you know i'm not saying that by there or something but he's just like you know you can hold only only 50 kilo and suddenly 70 kilo comes you know and the 50 kilo is already there the 50 kilo and then somebody puts 20 kilo more on it and then you resist
Skyler: like you understand absolutely yeah well you got levon you got levon saginashvili laying on your arm like that it's going to take something from you and not only that they had a a 15-second war at the center of the table before that even happened and i i just i think that that just took everything from devin i really do because you could you can you can easily see that every round after that he he was not the same puller as he was that first round that first round he got a good setup you could tell his strap setup was good he got a really good bite
Skyler: and a really good start it just every round after that it was different but he even said himself he still got good strap setups every round after that it's just
Engin Terzi: you know, LeBron was too strong, too good. Yeah, but we need to show respect to Devin. Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. Do you guys remember? Do you guys remember? Like, I made a video. I don't know if you guys saw, but I said in the video, basically, we're talking about LeBron's wrist and Devin's pronator, but it is actually more like Devin's wrist and LeBron's back pressure. If you guys realize the later rounds, you know, Devin was...
Engin Terzi: Like, you need to really control. I'm not saying this is easy to do something, but you need to control to separate that big weight behind his hand, you know. If you only pull his hand, you know, he will still do this. But if you just control here, if you can control. If I were Devin, I would stay at the center more tight and I would...
Engin Terzi: like i will tell you something if somebody is putting pressure or there is a weighted putting pressure here to sideway like this would you try to hold like control it this way or you would put some joint elbow joint lock behind it
Engin Terzi: I'm not saying that he needs to do supination. He needs to do pronation, but still, you know... Have a better cup. Yeah, better cup. Also, he needs to keep here close so that he could stop the pressure. But he was kind of like this. Yeah. What's your take, Daniel? Okay, Daniel, you go.
Daniel: Against, I mean, someone like Levan with the weight and the strength in my position, obviously very scary to have a breakup, I mean, to broke down. But obviously, yeah, using the bone lock and so on, it's very scary. For me, personally, it's very, very scary. That lock there.
Henry: Well, the way I look at it, I wholeheartedly believe... The belief of the prediction model I have is that some arm wrestling matches are decided before they get to the table. I wholeheartedly think this match, there was no path for Devin to beat LeVon on that day. Because...
Henry: i think even in the dream scenario which we saw in the first round devon got like an insane strap where if you if you look at lavon's hand like he's like maybe here gripping gripping on devon like devon got so deep and lavon was so shallow which i think set for the perfect moment where where devon's wrist wouldn't crack but we learned something interesting there
Henry: i think their side pressure is actually fairly similar their side pressure is not that far different i believe that round let's say you're talking about devon's and leon's side pressure devon's and levon's i don't think no no no no no no no no it's not about the side pressure leon's wrist didn't handle that that's why he couldn't go like he i asked him
Engin Terzi: If he would go, he would lose the wrist, so that is why he couldn't. If his wrist would handle, Levan's tight pressure is, I mean, much, much, much stronger. But the back pressure and pronator, just, did you guys see the photo from the top camera? If you look at their forearm position, their pronator is like equal position. But one is close and reduced by so much pressure, the other one is only hanging back, you know. Yeah.
Skyler: During this event, what was the thing that was unforgettable for you? It doesn't have to be one thing. What are the things that you couldn't forget? I'll tell you something that really got me that I was so happy to see and that was Michael's match. I loved that match. I thought it was a great match. It just shows how good Frank really is.
Skyler: and how good Frank's hand really is. And for Michael, for that to be his comeback match and for him to fight through that and figure out ways to win in bad positions. And it was just, to me, that was the match for me that really, and also Samushia's match was unbelievable. That was also an unbelievable match, but I was really happy for Michael and his comeback. I was really happy to see him get that win.
Skyler: and it just proves that Michael has to continue working his cup and working his wrist, and if he keeps getting his hand and wrist strong, it'll be tough to beat just like he always has been. That was the match that did it for me. That was a great one. I was very happy for Michael for him to win that day.
Daniel: yeah i mean yeah much of uh super frank has i like to call him on michael it was it was amazing yeah it was very good obviously poor frank obviously because i was supporting him 100 but yeah i already felt i already felt happy for for michael i mean he's a very very good guy
Engin Terzi: then from another match um i would say obviously another one that i like but listen it doesn't have to be the only the events yeah like during during this uh trip like everything like before they went after they went anything all right in
Daniel: So, in my case, I would say the training and the experience I had with Coach Ray, Paul Ling, and Odin Arad. So, that was the big thing for me. And obviously, the meeting, just say that the Paul Ling experience, meeting him and be there with the guys, that was the main outcome for me of the event and the whole experience. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, he's such a nice guy. Pauline, absolutely. If you are a good person, Pauline is good with you. If you are not a good person, Pauline is not bad with you, but he may not be close. But anyone who is friendly, Pauline just shows full friendship. That's my experience with him. Absolutely, especially because we have some friends in Cameroon that makes it easy talking to him. So it was great. Yeah, absolutely.
Henry: And from the reaction, I think that's the moment. That was maybe my most surprised, but that was maybe not my most exciting. My favorite moment was probably...
Henry: Well, okay. One, I like hung out with two stray dogs in Turkey for like an hour. That was very sweet. They were like, I was so sad having to leave them. I'm like, I have to go on the train. I can't bring you with me. But the stray animals... What was that? You had... Stray dogs. Oh, they walked with you? Yeah, they spent like 30 minutes with me.
Henry: Oh, that's good. So he became like my dog while I was in Istanbul for like a good half an hour. Then I had to go on the train. I'm like, I can't bring you with me. I don't know if he's going to bite me or give me something. I don't know. I think they're mostly safe. But anyway, and then as of the actual event, I'll say like a weird one that probably wasn't the most exciting for most people, but...
Henry: was the moment stojan golemanov and brandon el seso were walking out and just like kind of feeling the weight of like holy it's starting because i was there for a good oh because this is the first match over there yeah but just like feeling them walk out and feeling the energy of the room start to turn on and how about how about
Henry: Now, that match as well, I remember when he came out, I said to the Georgia guys, I go, I think Nugo did cocaine or something. He was like super energy. He was like ready to just kill it. So I want to, he needs to come back. That guy is like, I also spoke to them. Listen, I will tell you something. Listen, okay, no disrespect to the Atlas, but I, this is the second time that I'm doing this podcast with the East versus West 12th.
Engin Terzi: uh vips i must say that no disrespect to the atlas that i do podcasts but i enjoy talking about armwrestling uh more with you guys than with them you know yeah so i know you love me what happened is that you know looks gary like
Engin Terzi: almost seven, eight years, you know, before the pandemic, even at the European Championships, World Championships, I remember him, he was pulling in youth category. And last year in Moldova, he won the Europeans over Krasimir and some other strong guys. And so I realized it on social media, and then he wanted me to invite him.
Engin Terzi: And then we write each other. At the end, I invited him.
Engin Terzi: he promoted his match, he was so excited, like more than many others. I cannot say more than anyone, but more than many others. And I love that passion, you know, like the passion that right now we are sharing that I think is more fun to talk with you guys, you know, because right now we are not trying to promote the event or something, event finish and everything. We just enjoy talking about arm wrestling. And so this guy had the same passion about competing.
Engin Terzi: So these kind of guys really excite me. I know also Petro Marharint is the first time, you know, I was already feeling sad that like one of these guys will lose. The first time they are coming and they both are incredible. And then when Nugsgari, he lost, he went and sit, you know, in the auditorium. So he was at the other side. So I walked and I went to him and I said,
Engin Terzi: you will be invited again, you know. So he didn't, because he doesn't speak English. Yeah, later he asked to Roman, like, did Engin tell me this, like, or I misunderstood? And Roman asked me, I said, yes, yes, this is exactly what I told him. Because it is better to say this thing as soon as possible.
Engin Terzi: You don't want their mood to go down. When everything is fresh, that's the time you need to tell him this so that he wouldn't have that down feeling. So yeah, if you guys remember, I did the same thing with Dennis DiBlanco after he lost to
Engin Terzi: devon right at the stage i told him like positive things here so some things needs to be done when when persons like the perception is still open you understand at that moment anything can happen so so so harry so to answer you yes he will be invited
Henry: Well, that's good. I have a funny story about him, actually. We were at the banquet with the console games. Anyway, I'm with one of the Georgian guys, and I'm using him as my translator to talk to Nugo. And I was saying to Nugo, like,
Henry: you know, you seem like such a fun guy, I'm going to be rooting for you. I told him I saw like the video of him curling like 130 kilos. And there's people writing in the comments, oh, well, he's cheating. I'm like, dude, he fucking moved 130 kilograms with his arms. I don't care how you do it. I don't care if you're doing like the craziest cheat curl, he's still moving. And he told me he goes, I curled 150 kilos in like the same way just before this. And
Henry: And I told him, like, you know, I'm rooting for you. You know, you seem like a cool guy, whatever. And he just went like this and then gave me a hug. So he is like the nicest dude on the planet. Yes, yes. I am Nugo's number one fan, maybe only behind anger. Yeah. So, yeah, very cool guy and very good. He has the fire, you know.
Engin Terzi: Like there are some guys that you don't need to like, I many times try to hide the events, like whenever I invite and I try to steal the pot and something. With this guy, you don't need to do that. With Gennady, you don't need to do that because they're mature. You remember at the press conference, like if I didn't tell Gennady, I'd barely stop him, you know, because he would never give the microphone to Levan or anyone else because he had a personal problem with Devin. He wants to pull and beat him again.
Engin Terzi: So when Gennady Devon pulls next time, trust me, the atmosphere will be very near to this match because I'm finished business. I can't really tell or say this about Lugo because I don't really know him, but
Daniel: I really felt, obviously, that he looked like a very, very charismatic guy. And during the match, when he screamed to his opponent, like, no, during the match, it was it was a very, very, very funny moment. And from the event and so on, from the press conference and the whole experience, I take with me two moments, Fiat Racing and Nugo from from from the spontaneity of. OK, OK. Nugzari did that when when when
Engin Terzi: uh margaret pin his head like during this head up yeah yeah yeah yeah that was great that was a great moment and and skyler so what what is your favorite moment because you talk only about arm i think
Skyler: Oh, my gosh. And there was so much to be honest with you. The only word that comes to mind for me is just the camaraderie of everybody just being there with everybody and everybody being so nice. And it just the camaraderie is the only word that comes to mind other than, you know, what happened at the event. The press conference was great. Everything was great the entire time. You know, it was just incredible.
Skyler: it was great everything that's that's that's the only word that you can put on it is great it was a great event everything uh pre-event was great during the event post event
Skyler: everything about it was great you know you can't ask for anything more and and camaraderie and and friendships the friendships that i made you know it that's that's a big part of it for me i i think that that's the best part of it yeah yeah the press conference was i i got very emotional when switzerland yeah yeah i didn't know that they didn't tell me she told to neil meal pickup but she didn't tell me anything she wanted to surprise right and then and then she
Henry: when she came to the stage like I barely yeah she shook the entire room up absolutely yeah yeah like I was telling a Skyler after that I was like like I think there was a lot of people cutting onions right then because like
Henry: I'm sitting in the background just like, oh, you know, I don't care. And then like, there's just one little, you know, oh, it doesn't matter. You know, I think everybody was was crying a little bit in that moment, for sure. Evgeny if you are like not a big fan and you didn't know whatever it was like, even my dad was like, I don't even know who they're talking about. And he was like, like tearing up a little bit. So, yeah, it was a very sweet moment. It was it was a failure on the event. Yeah, absolutely. Mm hmm. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was it was incredible.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, the kid, you know, the VIP, what did he ask to Lewon? He said, is he going to need a hotel tent? Yeah, yeah. And he asked how his wrist was. During the press conference, right? During the press conference. Not press conference, room meeting, room meeting.
Henry: yep yeah see now I was actually friends with him because uh like me and him were chatting in the lobby I learned he's only been fan for like two months and in those two months he like already knew like I need to get the VIP I have to go to this event so like that was really great to see that someone in such a shorter period of time like sees our sport and then falls in love almost immediately so I was speaking with him and like
Skyler: i could tell he maybe isn't the most knowledgeable fan but he had the most fun out of anybody in that room so that was very nice yes he did very very young and has a bright future as well because he he he likes to pull you can tell that he wants to be an arm wrestler and he's very young so it's it's it's a very good start time for him as well yeah i thought he was great i i tell you what seriously talking about arm wrestling with you guys is
Daniel: great i'm repeating this all the time but because like i kind of see my passion being matched you know and then that's why i enjoy it yeah we we enjoyed as much as you're doing and trusting yeah that's that's why i enjoy yes it's amazing having on these events and you don't really picture it until you are there what is like you know walk among you guys um with the others and so on and then obviously meeting all these new people i mean here we are with henry with skyler
Daniel: Unless you don't, you, if you don't, if you don't go, you don't know what will happen. So it's like, I will never imagine that after the East versus West 12th, I will be here and meeting, making new friends, you know? So it's something really unique about this sport. And obviously at some point, if the sport keeps growing up and everything, at some point, this circuiting, perhaps with the others and so on, will eventually change. But at the moment we have to enjoy it and take the chance because this is unique.
Engin Terzi: If you're at home, and you're on the fence, go. If you're even thinking about it, maybe I want to go to East vs. West, you know, maybe if it's a go. Guys, you know, Orlando event, the Orlando event is the first East vs. West in North America. And I will explain, like I had three reasons, like one of them,
Engin Terzi: all the time north american athletes have to travel to istanbul while the eastern guys are closer you know some of them even like one and a half hour from georgia but kazakhs fly five hours but nobody flies except also the australia but uh majority of the western athletes are coming from us and canada so i thought that it would be fair this time is to go to west and that was the first reason the second reason
Engin Terzi: The North America fans, they always supported me. And they have been asking, you know, like, we are kind of, like, not upset, but we want to also join and come to the event, you know, why not doing it? No, I told them, I want to do that, but my abilities, capabilities in Istanbul, because I'm from here.
Engin Terzi: So to go another country, so that's why I talk with Chen Shuo. Chen Shuo, by the way, very good guy, smart guy, new generation armwrestling representative. You know, the guy is like the new generation, but super smart and very knowledgeable about armwrestling. So also very good guy. And the third reason is that I always say North America is the motherland of the modern armwrestling.
Engin Terzi: armwrestling. Like armwrestling is like 3000 years of sport, but the modern armwrestling homeland is North America, all those techniques that we know today, these these are Americans invented, and they teach to rest of the world. Just think about just tell me, Russian armwrestling legend from 1980. Can you?
Engin Terzi: No. But I can count you. Maybe Denis Suplankov was alive at the time, so he would go on to be an armwrestling question. Yeah, but he wasn't an armwrestling. So what I just tried to say, just think about it. Johnny Walker, John Burdink, Dave Patton, Cobra, Richard Lapkus, Gary Goodrich, and all those guys. I can count you, Bert Whitfield, many George Givens, and many guys, I can tell you. So North America deserves this.
Engin Terzi: And another thing that's very important, North Americans, they didn't compete the Waffles and Europeans, so they stayed in by themselves. But trust me, to success, the key for the success is the competition.
Engin Terzi: when when all these guys from east every year they compete wow europeans you know they go compete go home what what they learn and then they do homework come back again you know so that made the level higher so my intention is to involve as many as american possible to just increase to a level of the american army so that things will be much better you know because american armistice are
Henry: very good arm masters but they need more competition you cannot really get better without the the highest level experience wait so engen i have a question there's someone in the chat calling me out for a match so i think at the next east first west me and bold and three you know should be the opening you think yeah
Henry: yeah Henry flash pins engine I don't think you guys are ready for it yeah that's right somebody said I would be shocked by my own power like I would win and then I would I would be surprised I mean you you are shocked of your own reaction so anyway um I was also gonna I was also gonna say again um actually I just completely blank never mind I had something I was gonna say but I forgot
Daniel: Yeah, that happens, that happens, yeah. But go ahead, go ahead, Daniel. I bet that the event in the States is going to be, I mean, we thought, we think that now the East-West 12th event, it was full of people. I think wait for the United States event. I think that's going to be some energy.
Henry: Okay, I actually just remembered. Engin, if Jerry is ready to compete in Orlando, we need him. We need the full American team. Jerry is the best arm wrestler in America, and we don't have him competing there. So we need him. Okay, okay. Just now, let's listen. Do you realize that very, very, very, very small possibility a Georgian to get visa and almost impossible a Russian to get visa?
Engin Terzi: And it's still very hard for a Kazakh to get visa. So there are two Kazakh athletes
Engin Terzi: They already applied for visa waiting for the, how do you say, interview? What do you say in the embassy? But there are some other people. Yeah, I'm trying to make everything possible. But I don't think Vitalii Laletin can get visa and apply to there. And just think about this. Jerry is pulling Vitalii five weeks before.
Engin Terzi: and we cannot say that it will be an easy match we don't know what their condition will be and i don't think that you know it is it will be very hard you know to tell someone to get visa and then cancel his match you understand so trust me i i can tell you about it like 30 minutes i can tell you but i i have been already working on it so just trust me i'm doing my best
Henry: and hopefully yeah it's just difficult to set up but if it will work you will make it happen
Henry: yeah yeah okay yeah yeah yeah well if that happens we truly have every single Elite North American like he's the only guy missing like without even without him this is like the superstar best ever North American team that you could have put together it's really all right from other side I need to make East versus West 13 also good did you guys say I partially share it looks good right
Skyler: oh yeah yeah that's a very good card very good i have already begun making the keys for that event so i already have some predictions hopefully oh yeah that that jerry vitale match is going to be very interesting very interesting jerry is that's going to be he's going to be a tough guy to beat that day for vitale that's that's that's arch nemesis style
Henry: Okay, I'm glad that you say that because some people are acting like Vitalii will definitely win. I think Jerry is the favorite in this match, genuinely. If Jerry gets his wedge in, he's going to be very difficult to beat. If he gets to straps, I think there's almost no shot for Vitalii. David you guys watch the interview with Hermes and Levan? Yeah. David you guys see what Levan and Hermes did? If they tried to go outside...
Engin Terzi: And if Jerry position, it will be very hard even for them to win. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Levan said that he has to win fast. He needs to win fast, Levan said. So the part that I don't understand it, when the opponents are taking this seriously. See, I'm not saying Hermes. Hermes still believes himself that he can win easy against Jerry. And Jerry wants Hermes. Oh, yeah.
Engin Terzi: enemies doesn't trust his top rope or that he trusted you know like he drops his like little bit supinated like sky dragging you know yeah but it with top roll everyone is in trouble yeah army's arm wrestle jerry about as perfect as anybody could arm wrestle him the the first match they had that that was it doesn't get any better than that army's displayed a very very very
Skyler: It was, oh, my gosh. The perfect angle. Ernie's hit the perfect angle every time.
Engin Terzi: Jerry says that he lost because he was ill and he wants to pull him in Florida. Jerry is not bullshitting. When I say he's not bullshitting, I'm not saying Jerry will beat Hermes. But Jerry is actually ready to pull Hermes. He said he's ready to pull LeVon. David you see that on that podcast? He said if you would replace Vitalii, he's ready to go against LeVon. I don't know if that's true, but he's feeling good right now.
Engin Terzi: No, I mean, if I set him with Levan, he's not going to say no. I don't think that, you know, Jerry also wanted me to set him with Devin. So the only thing that Jerry doesn't want to do, Jerry doesn't want to pull anyone really ranked behind him. He wants to go for like golden shot. Yeah.
Henry: And people forget he beat Gennady and he beat Georgi. For some people, for some reason, people ignore those wins and they go, oh, he's not that good. Yeah, they ask me, like, how is Jerry ranked here? He beat Gennady. And he was the champion before Hermes beat him. Like, people forget. He was the champion.
Engin Terzi: Georgi, you know, Svetkov, like, I mean, these guys are, anyone who is underestimating Gennady and Georgi, they are mistaken. By the way, Georgi is fine. He's getting better and better. But he says that Engin, this wasn't my best. And I believe him. Yeah, because he was using...
Henry: antibiotic, you know, yeah. And the moment he came out, the moment he came out, I said to the Georgia next bag, oh, he's gonna lose like, I could feel his energy when he came out. He felt like, like a soda without any carbonation. Like he just had like,
Henry: It was literally like he just wasn't ready. And I could feel like he knew he wasn't at his best and he probably wasn't going to win. And you can see in the way he pulls, he just went like he couldn't lean and put, you know, top row because his left foot, he can't put any weight on it. So he just kind of went there and just tried to do as best he can. And I honestly think he did a really good job. I leave that match thinking good about Georgie.
Engin Terzi: Given everything he had going on, he did an okay job. He was very brave because he could just pull out saying, listen, I have a serious injury, which he had, and he was... This is what I wanted him to do. Yeah. I thought that he only bent his ankle, you know, like there's something happened. Just twisted it. You know, yeah, his ankle. And, like, I was thinking only this. I...
Engin Terzi: like but later he told me that he was using antibiotic and he said that he injured him his ankle when before he did you guys know that one week before the event he copied the bullet station yeah yeah and like i wasn't why you do that is that like i mean i cannot rest long time you know this is what i need to do but what later he told me that he had to rest
Engin Terzi: And not go to Bulgarian nationals, and then his ankle would be. Uh, fine, you know, so kind of, he said that I made the wrong decision and this, but everything is I asked him every day. How is he doing? But.
Daniel: It's getting better, yeah. On Wednesday evening, we were having a dinner all together and we were talking about it because I was looking at his feet and I was literally flipping out and he was telling us that he had the injury, that the doctor told him that he's crazy, that he should have an MRI. I was not competing. I still went there to compete. I was very brave.
Engin Terzi: and very bright and he yeah i mean impressive i mean hats off for doing that yeah i i think but i still think that he he should have told me like that he doesn't feel good and then because he was if you guys saw he was all the time walking you know i see him yes hallway in the hotel he was just walking around you know like hanging out you know and i was like okay if the guy is walking you know i thought
Daniel: wasn't in his mindset it wasn't his nature i mean it's like if i if i if i call to say i cannot pull he will regret himself for not being there for not being the easiest of what's 12 in such historical event so yeah probably he said like let's go and if i die i die with honor let's just say but yeah he's like his his uh food was looking terrible it was bad thursday morning it was it was a scary
Skyler: I honestly think we should see a rematch of Alex versus Georgie. I would love to see that just run back at the next one. I think it's a completely different match. If Georgie is the same Georgie that pulled Devin in December, I guess it was, I think it's a completely different match. I really do. Yeah, but do you guys remember at the press conference, Georgie said that he would still beat Morozov if his stomach was okay.
Engin Terzi: Yes, I remember too. Yeah, so if now if Kordesha says that he would still beat Georgi, even if his ankle was okay. Though I think that it's fair enough, you know. I mean, I understand from a ranking perspective, we have to look at the match result and then set the next match based on the match result.
Henry: That being said, as a fan with my biased opinion, I 100% think on that day, I think Yogi probably 3-0s Alex if he's able to lean and actually do his top roll. But I can't say I know that. I just think that. So you have to follow what actually happens. So, you know, Yogi, but definitely don't, I would say on his next match, don't give him someone way worse thinking, oh, he lost. I think he deserves another match
Engin Terzi: on that same level you know I mean yeah don't listen those guys just like for me when they rank on the paper and where they rank in my head are like not the same you know the regalia is up there you know you can pull with air mass with anyone up there you know and I in my opinion I think Georgie is number three in the world
Henry: Oh, you think he would beat Alex and Hermes? Yeah, I think he would beat everybody except for Devin and LeBron. That's it. I think he beats everybody. Like a good shape without a busted up foot and he's not sick and any of this stuff. When he's in good shape...
Daniel: We still can't discredit Alex yet. Yeah, yeah. To be fair, maybe Alex is really, really, really good. That's completely possible. Yeah, yeah, we can't. I mean, maybe two rounds for Alex, for sure. I mean, he was looking huge. You saw him in the van. He's more prepared than before. Yeah. So, yeah. Maybe. I'm very curious about Alex's next match. Very curious to see that one because I think that he might be
Skyler: better than what we all think even though he was hurt yeah and then what do you guys think about the king of table is coming if you start just say from Pauline versus Lachlan match oh I love that match oh my gosh I love that match I feel like that match is so close I I like Paul I do thank Paul my and
Skyler: It could be a 50-50 match, but I give Paul the slight edge, but I love that match. That is such a good match, in my opinion. Very good match. I expect that to be a war, for sure. I expect that to look very similar to Krazy and Lachlan. Very similar to that match, which was an awesome match. That was.
Daniel: What was I'm sorry for interrupting you before Skyler may have always good. You're good. What was the shoulder? The injury shoulder of Paul? It was right or left. Who I never even heard about this.
Daniel: Yeah, he had an issue with one of the shoulders. I mean, obviously, I think he's pulling with his obviously healthy side. But yeah, he had a lot of problems with his shoulder that he was only able to sleep in one of his sides in certain positions and so on. Yeah, he was going through... I never heard about that. I'm surprised. Yeah, yeah. I know he has some injury, you know, but I don't know how serious it is. He has been...
Daniel: yeah but anyway I I will vote for just to make it short I think uh we vote for Paul I'm going to give him a vote yeah all right I think uh Lachlan is gonna run straight through Paul
Henry: pretty sure I think it like there's a chance Paul Lynn might stop him but um every analytic I look at there's I would say very little reason to think Paul will win but that doesn't mean that he can't um but I would say Lachlan is like a 85 to 15 favorite it's pretty one-sided Paul should win but you know Pauline Pauline is the explosive one if somebody stops somebody
Engin Terzi: it may be locked and stopping pauline because yeah pauline whenever even even if you remember one round you know it actually went here of course he stopped him but he beat him but he still took him here you know like pauline start you know is very effective i think lachlan lachlan's faster than you guys give him credit for i'm not saying he's not like an explosive guy but
Engin Terzi: No, no, I'm not saying Lachlan's slower. Paul is faster. That's what I try to say. Paul is very, very... The way I see it is right on the go, maybe Lachlan like this. He kind of catches him and then kind of... That I understand. The catches, I understand. But I don't think that like...
Engin Terzi: um i don't see i don't see a uh easy match i see no either way yeah me too me too and then and then i'll talk to you about that skylar what what do you guys think the possibility of uh school boy and ryan bone i think that's cool i think that's a super cool match that's a very good question but i would say i would vote for alex they say but
Daniel: Like we said the other day, world of Nostradamus and so on. We'll see how much has improved Ryan, but I would say Alex.
Henry: yeah see with this one this is interesting I had seen someone comment after hearing about this match it said uh you know schoolboy keeps going up against harder and harder opponents and I was like am I crazy but I feel like Leonidas is way better than Ryan like I think Leonidas would run through 100 very very strong I mean he's strong you know very strong I don't think that
Engin Terzi: I don't think this is a higher level match, but of course, you know, it is still a dangerous match, but I don't think Leonidas is in, like right now he's on different paths. I think he's very serious. I talked with his trainer. He is not planning exhibition matches. He's not planning show matches. The guy is serious about armwrestling. So that's all I will say. I'm not going to go into details, but yeah.
Skyler: Well, after the last match, I totally expect that because that was extremely impressive on his part. Extremely impressive. Absolutely.
Henry: If that match were to happen, this is one where I would not give an official prediction on it just because I'm not like, there's so many random factors and I have no clue. But I would think Schoolboy would have to be the favorite. I think this is definitely a much easier match than Leonidas, in my opinion. I think Leonidas would 6-0 Ryan. And Schoolboy and Leonidas was a close match. That was like, I think it was...
Henry: I want to say three to two, or was it three to one? Three to two or three to one? Yeah, three to two. And on top of that, I think Schoolboy had a round kind of taken from him on some minor calls. So that was a really, really, really tight match. And I just don't like, like, I actually think Ryan and Larry is a really cool match.
Henry: But Leonidas is way better than Larry and Schoolboy is pretty damn close to Leonidas. So I think Schoolboy would take that pretty easily. But, you know, it's definitely a match I want to see because I don't know.
Daniel: I remember the first round. Do you remember, guys, when it was asleep and a schoolboy just hit the table, how hard it sounded? That we were like, yeah, he's going to run through, he's going to murder Leonidas. And then it was one of the matches that changed, that surprised us, most of many of us the most.
Skyler: that much it was it was beautiful much i'll tell you it didn't surprise me that much because the first podcast we had i remember us talking about this match and i said that leonidas is very sticky and if he starts stopping school boy there could be an issue and that's exactly what happened i remember talking to you before the event and you said this exact same thing now i actually have a funny story about this match you guys mind if i talk for like two minutes
Henry: yeah go ahead so I was speaking with my friend my good buddy who uh I met selling him like East versus West trading cards and we just started talking and now we're like great friends um we were talking about this match like the moment it got announced and me and him were only speaking to each other about this we hadn't seen what everyone else thought and when we were talking to each other we were saying oh yeah I think Leonidas is gonna win he's got to be the favorite we were both pretty confident about Leonidas
Henry: But then both of us got outside of our bubble and everyone's saying, oh, yeah, schoolboy, 100%. And we were like, wait, wait, what? Like me and him talking to each other, we were both like pretty good at convincing each other like Leonidas is the favorite. But then the moment I got out of my bubble, all of a sudden, like 95% of people, oh, yeah, schoolboy is going to win. I was just like, before that match, I was like –
Engin Terzi: would say probably 60 on leonidas but like i thought it was a very split very close match um i believe i even said that on the podcast i'm not just talking out of my butt but uh that was a terrific match there is there is a there is a question andre is asking how long before people are no longer considered new leonidas has been arm wrestling for five years my friend there are many people has been arm wrestling for 30 years but like being fully committed to
Engin Terzi: armwrestler is different than you know like time to time you know you just do many other things and time to time you are messed up those are different things right now the guy is um very very focused on armwrestling and he really he was really happy he was very happy yeah you could see that yeah yeah and it was good when everyone tells you you got no chance and you win you know and from now on he will
Engin Terzi: get better and better and better you know yeah anyways guys so let's talk uh some other matches as well and for example this is very very serious match very serious match this darano versus levas this match very serious match you know both of these like i i will really like two giants in my head but you know there are sometimes like one guy
Skyler: will feel sorry for the one who loses i i i'm so with you on that i i i cannot figure this one out this one has got me so baffled oh my gosh this is such a good match absolutely i know i make no comments about this one neither i mean i i have to think that ravaz
Engin Terzi: maybe he'll be exposed he will be exposed yeah he will probably position better but he needs to do that four rounds
Skyler: And we know that two matches that Zeranov had at the East vs. West, he won both matches from 2-0 to come back and beat the guys 3-2. He is very versatile. He's a very versatile arm wrestler, and I didn't know much about him until the last couple East vs. West that he's pulled, and he impressed the hell out of me. I mean, he is a great puller, and he has so much heart. He doesn't give up, and he just keeps fighting until he finds that angle to where...
Skyler: he pulls out the victory, you know, and that's, that's what I could see happening. I could see revised getting the first couple. And then, you know, he finally finds a lane to, to get the stop and it goes from there. But I don't know that that's a, that's a very close match in my opinion, very close match.
Skyler: But if it does stop, you know, if there's runoff or however you say his last name, if he stops it, it's probably going to go his way because he's very versatile, very versatile arm wrestler. Yeah. And you guys? Do you want to go, Daniel? I'm not making comments, I mean, because Skyler, most of it, say everything. I mean, it's going to be a tough match and it could be like a potential war, but
Daniel: Maybe we could be wrong. Maybe we go to the match and we see Rivas, for example, running through him, or vice versa. Daniel, did I tell you that I like your t-shirt? Oh, really? I think it's pretty familiar, you know? Oh, okay. I have a very nice memory with this one, yeah.
Henry: And, Henry, how do you see that? So, again, remember on Frank versus Michael Todd, I was like, I am 99% sure Michael Todd will win this one. I will put forth another arrogant prediction, and I'll see if I'm right. Revez is going to run him over 6-0 really fast.
Henry: I think there's a lot. I've analyzed tons and tons and tons of footage. Zonarov, I've never seen him press once on left or right hand, and I see almost no way he's going to keep his wrist against Revez. This is a total mismatch. Revez is going to run him over really fast. That's my bold prediction. Well done, brother. Well done.
Henry: But yeah, I've looked at a lot of video of Rebaz, and I've looked at a lot of video of Dzhanarov. I would see almost no way Dzhanarov can initiate the hook against Rebaz. His arm is way too long. David you know that this guy with left arm, Vitalii Levityan, involved? Like how long ago was that? Is that recent? When Vitalii Levityan was World War Champion.
Engin Terzi: yeah i mean yeah but nobody nobody is the same from that time to this time trust me it is like i can tell you detailed way but nobody is the same so what i'm just saying that when lalitin was world champion uh this guy
Henry: with left arm i remember him beating i'm not saying that he can beat him now or something but trust me like the xenon is not someone to be underestimated my prediction is yeah yeah it's largely rooted in my belief of ravaz being really good i think ravaz is top five today i even googled like part of my research for this match was googling how long it takes to recover from a finger break like i even looked that up you guys know it's good that's good so it's good
Engin Terzi: uh yeah but you are just looking to like not like pure arm wrestling point you know like how long the finger yeah i understand that's important as well but did you know that this guy in 110 kilo they both were right now the xenon is 130 kilo yeah this guy when this guy was uh 110 kilo did you know that right on left he beat ivan matushenko at the waffles
Engin Terzi: I believe it. He's really good. Yeah, so Ivan Matushenko, when he was 110 kilo, right now this guy is 130 kilo. I'm not saying this, I don't know, will win. It may go the way that you say, but if it goes different way, I will not be surprised.
Engin Terzi: i know you like yeah yeah yeah like your your predictions are as i don't know sharp as this yeah and that's why i have that reaction because every everything goes my way but the moment it doesn't i'm like
Henry: what the hell you know what it's like i'm certain like lavon's gonna kill him and then whenever it looks like uh not the way i i thought it would be i'm shocked but that event you didn't see too many reactions like that because everything went my went my way except for uh alijan versus ermys i had that reaction because it went my exact way i predicted i predicted one-sided match for alijan but i was surprised in the nature you know what i'm saying
Engin Terzi: like you don't you don't react they are in hook and then three four seconds later you react i'll explain why so okay so from my angle
Henry: Alijan, I can't even see what is happening on his face. So I thought it was like a fight. You know what I'm saying? And then I realize I go, holy shit, Alijan's talking to him. You know what I'm saying? So at first, at first I see that. And then I'm like, okay, you know, or me stop the match. I'm like focusing. And then I, I don't really have a good angle on it, but then I can kind of see that like, like his lips are moving. And I was like, he's talking to him.
Henry: like you know i i talked to skylar after that match skyler was like more shocked than me he was like dude i thought he might win but but i did not see it happening like that you know so oh no that was very unpredictable definitely your system the 13 keys and so far has been proved that it's working my friend but this is the magic of the sport sometimes you can be very surprised and think
Henry: same thing there's this guy saying he's shocked by his bad predictions my guy I went five for five and I predicted the same as last time Lavon match so I you know I I don't know what bad predictions you're talking about they're missing from that event but my predictions are very good I don't know what what this guy's saying but anyway um oh father they are me I I I bet he he before the match said that Devin's gonna sweep him I bet
Engin Terzi: Yeah, let me ask. I asked you, Alijan, by message, if he sees the message. I just asked him, you know, what he said to Hermes during the message. Somebody asked me, he goes, Henry, what did he say? I'm like, dude, I can't hear. You know, that room is exploding. You think I could hear what Alijan is saying to Hermes? I bet he said, I got some handles for you after this. Oh, yeah.
Henry: Oh, yeah. Behind the moment. Oh, my God. Yeah, I'm actually. So.
Engin Terzi: I thought that that was like him just kind of making a playful joke, but I think a lot of people took that very wrong and don't like Alishan. I don't think he had bad intentions. Do you know what? I think he started to sell equipment, arm-wrestling equipment. Just follow his Instagram. You will see. I think he just gave a gift, I think. But maybe I'm wrong. Maybe it's just as innocent as I just said now. We will see. I don't know.
Daniel: i think it was it was both i mean i think he was always trying to sell his his um his hands do some promotion and maybe trying to mock a little bit on hermes as well but yeah i remember standing there next to urchi and when when they when the guy with the hundreds came in and so on we were like right this is going to be not appropriate and you could tell that hermes was fuming at that moment like he was like yes yeah he was not happy
Skyler: no no i agree with daniel 100 i think it was a little bit of both because i think ermy's banter before the match you know he was he was he was obviously talking he said he's too big he said there's no way alejon can do anything with me you know i i saw them i i saw them when like hermes went off and say call him call him i saw the guy the gentleman is smiling we're picking up the hundreds and i was like right there we go yeah yeah yeah you just you can tell that it was
Daniel: it was a little bit of both like here i'm gonna make you learn some inside arm wrestling and i'm also gonna banter with you a little bit since you did it with me now i'm actually going to react far more worse than he did literally i thought he was going to react very bad at the moment but obviously with the cameras and so on but i remember looking at him and saying yeah yeah anyways so let's talk let's talk about ask a question again just real fast yeah yeah so hey by the way by the way
Engin Terzi: I just sent you your paid actor money. David you receive? Yes. $20,000. $20,000, right? How many? $20,000, right? $20,000 is just only like, you know, 3% of it. Okay, go ahead. That's a great acting career, Henry.
Henry: Yeah, I think on the next live stream, I'll change my name from Henry to Hollywood actor or something. Anyway, but if you look in that first round of Alijan versus Hermes, Hermes fires back pressure at like 100%. And you can see Alijan's wrist goes like this. It a little bit fell back. I want to bet the house on this prediction. Vitalii would run over Alijan because of this. Because I think if they were to get a match... You're talking about without this prep.
Henry: with and without i think vitality like you are saying almost certain yeah with the strap like if you watch it back watch it like very closely his wrist goes like this just a little bit and then he yeah but but then after that he hits and then curses yeah i agree but but i think vitality would get all the way out of that is my point
Skyler: Alijon is a problem in this draft for anybody. He's a problem, yeah. Inside that draft, he's a problem for anybody on the planet. Yeah, I'll tell you what. I mean, I was on the Hermes train. You know, I thought Hermes was going to win the match. So I'm just elated about it. I can't believe it. But after seeing that, I wasn't either. But after seeing that, you know, I mean, if it goes to a strap with him, I don't know if anybody can beat him that's across from him.
Engin Terzi: I mean, I can say that Vitalii's hand is probably stronger than Hermes'. Yeah, absolutely. But I'm still not sure if his arm is stronger than Hermes', even with left. I don't know. I see the match being closer, but I still see Aljan winning, probably 3-1, 3-2.
Henry: there's this very frustrating like square in left-handed arm wrestling with Yvonne, Morozov, Miletin, and Alijan. And Kamil is also there. And Kamil maybe. And maybe even Tobias because Tobias and Kamil was like a 51-49 match. That was very close. So like we need to get that ironed out in the next like six months to know who the actual lefty is. I think it was a very bad matchup. Like for any guy who is going outside,
Engin Terzi: that that that risk pressure is no good yeah there is one guy is asking and you know i'm from pakistan how can i join east versus west i i mean if you want to watch it it is open to everyone you just need to travel and come if you want to compete
Engin Terzi: you need to win a qualification in asia the only qualification we had uh philippines but i'm planning to do in some other countries as well but you can compete another one in europe or something if you have a chance to travel or you can win asian european or world championships in waff and then you can also be qualified for the final qualification yeah
Daniel: I think there are very good matches, yeah. Go ahead, go ahead, Daniel. A quick comment about the match between Camille and Tobias. Guys, do you remember the atmosphere during the match? There was a moment and nobody... That was incredible. It was super tense. That was the match, by far, I was the most tense of all.
Daniel: the most sense of all i mean you could feel the atmosphere that was a moment that nobody was talking at all it was so close it wasn't because everyone realizes it's one here or here like everyone understands how fast that match is going to go well and to be honest i'm going to say this in favor of um of camille i was i was very nervous for him and you know when when he had the issues with the setup the fouls the stars and so on
Daniel: like i was i was watching him very closely more or less well from from there you know and i saw him like getting nervous like getting secure and seeing him like overcoming his stops and everything adapt and get better and go for it to me was beautiful and i was i was very happy for him it was very very close match and also and hope
Daniel: It could be a potential rematch in the future because it was a beautiful match. And for Kamil Jablonski, if you're watching this, mate, I am 100% happy for you because you got the victory and obviously you beat yourself here when I felt that you were nervous and hesitating about yourself and everything. He overcome that. He got ready, focused, and he did the job. So congratulations, Kamil.
Henry: but mill's also really nice guy anybody absolutely i can vouch for a super cool guy very kind talk like talk to me for like probably 30 minutes about his training and and what he's doing differently this time and why he lost to ivan matyshenko just very very interesting guy very thoughtful guy very funny guy all right one last comment about about coming personality i one of the things that he impressed me the most is like i met him in the east west 10.
Daniel: but then later on he told me that he reminded me from the uk not from the event he actually reminded me from from the uk when he was here he actually recognized me so i was like that's cool incredible that's cool yeah absolutely that's all yeah i i used to have very good memory as well but right now when you focus you know how it is computer from one side you put new and then from other side it is
Henry: uh deleting erasing you know the knowledge okay let's go morozov versus ivan matushenko do you have a coin yeah i i have something even better than a coin daniel all right go for it for the 13 keys brother
Henry: so this match i like i'm admitting that i cannot make a confident prediction on that being said uh this is pretty confidently in the morozov camp that being another thing though so morozov this was supposed to be against alijan and morozov said he's not ready for alijan
Henry: So because of that, in my eyes, assuming if he wins this match, I do not want to see Yvonne versus Ali Jean. If he like then that match would not be interesting. But if Yvonne wins this match, we are set for like one of the most beautiful matches I think that will ever be put Ali Jean versus Yvonne Matyshenko. If Yvonne Matyshenko runs through him.
Henry: That being said, any piece of conventional wisdom pretty confidently says Morozov should win this. He's, I think, pretty clearly the favorite. I would say maybe 80-20. But when you have a guy where he runs through every guy he's been given, it's hard to say that he will lose. He has beaten everybody very confidently. You're talking about Ivan? Yeah, Ivan. Ivan, his match he had against Reno...
Engin Terzi: that was not super comfortable like it was not as easy as coming match yeah i think it was four to one right yeah yeah for one it was one round he kind of got pressed and it was like yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and then the other match was i think david arabuli i want to say left-handed yeah yeah that that was like and he like whacked him he whacked him yeah do you guys do you guys would you guys bet on morozo if both were 115 kilo
Engin Terzi: At 150 kilo, I'm certain Matashenko takes it. One is super heavyweight, one is heavyweight. That is the biggest advantage. If one wins, can you imagine?
Henry: 115 kilo guy is becoming the super weight champion and that sets up that sets up so beautifully for him against alijon for the 115 kilo left-handed title like that would be and then the winner of that takes on le latin that would be like the most excited i think i've ever been for a match maybe ever from like a arm wrestling standpoint like don't worry people have many great matches guys
Engin Terzi: Many great matches. The left arm competition is still like just happening, you know, like imagine next year when Levan comes and there will be Laletin. Imagine Levan Skagina-Shirley versus Ali Canmurado. I wouldn't underestimate the guy. I would say Levan is favorite, but I wouldn't underestimate the guy.
Engin Terzi: No, I wouldn't either. But it's going to be very hard to beat Levan on either arm. I would say 80-20 for Levan. But I'm saying this now. If I said that match, if you ask me, I would just say I'm organized. I cannot predict. If Levan is healthy on the left hand...
Henry: i will put the house that he wins i i think of his left hand because his left hand was always better than his right hand people forget that he was not a right-handed guy before his injury he left-handed i think lost to nobody except for georgie svetkov once he his left hand is more impressive than his right hand
Engin Terzi: so if he were to like be back and he says i'm healthy everything's a hundred percent if he has that left-handed press as well i feel really really really talking about who levan you're talking about levon left-handed yeah he's you know he's feeling good did you know that he had a very serious injury with the wrist yeah yeah yeah so whenever he was getting ready for dennis i think and then since then it is not his arm is incredible i think with left arm he was more dominant than his right
Engin Terzi: before he became professional. He's the expert. He said that yesterday, I didn't lose since 2015. I had to remind him, I said, but since 2018, you are not really pulling any left arm. I saw that. Yeah, six and a half years. So from 2015 to 2019, there was only four years.
Engin Terzi: So even in fact, three and a half years. So, but I really, I call him, I put pressure on him, you know, and he said, no, not the, I said, how about October? You know, he's like, no, you know, just let's do next year. Yeah. I think he's ready right now. His left hand looks so good. Every left hand practice pull I've seen him pull it. He looks amazing. Him versus Vitalii left-handed would be.
Engin Terzi: really good I will tell you something right now as of now we thought it would beat him I know his left arm I was there when he was training with Irakli I mean his wrist didn't look super good you know yeah right okay yeah I agree with that people also said his wrist didn't look good and then he whacked Devin for zero so no no no this is different different this this one his wrist
Engin Terzi: different you know trust me anyways like the left wrist injury was more serious was it not than the right for many years trust me he's just right but the good thing is that if you look at him his right left side not so much difference because every time he does pull-ups chin-ups every time he does those barbell curls he's doing it to arm but he is not specifically focused on
Engin Terzi: So, let's go to the main event. Ermes Gasparini vs. Denis Siplenko. Denis Siplenko, I saw him training against Kirill Sarchev a week before the East vs. West.
Engin Terzi: When Denis really wanted, he was able to take the wrist of Kirill. But sometimes when he waited, he was just, you know, stretched this way. But whenever I asked Ali Can to top roll, he couldn't top roll this way, but he was able to go to pin path. Levan and Ermes think that, you know, it doesn't really matter.
Engin Terzi: your take. I won't be surprised if this is a very tough match. Majority of people says that Hermes is going to win, but if Hermes makes any mistake, it can become a nightmare. What do you guys think? Go ahead, Daniel. Carry on, Skyler, please. You first, my friend. Well, I mean, the
Skyler: That's kind of what I see. I think that Ermes is the favorite, but he can't make any mistakes. I definitely think he's going to knock Dennis off center and you're going to see Dennis holding on probably like he did against Devin. Does Ermes have the tools to work through
Skyler: you know dennis's wrist and cut the way devin did does can he come in and jump on his pronator and sit there and then roll back out can he can he work all those angles to work through dennis he can but if he can but will he will he will he do that like yeah that's what i'm saying yeah if he becomes impatient it could be a problem it could be a problem if he becomes impatient
Skyler: I don't think that he will just because Hermes does have weapons. I mean, obviously his back pressure and outside game is so good. And then he obviously has the press as well. We've seen that against Vitalii. So it's just going to be very hard for Dennis to beat him, I think. But, you know, Dennis, if Dennis wears him out enough and Hermes makes a few minor mistakes, then we could see a really good match and Dennis could possibly win. I mean, you never know. But I do see a 60-40 Hermes in that match for sure.
Daniel: Right. So, I mean, obviously Dennis has the experience. Dennis has the confidence on the table because he has, I mean, tons of experience. He is what he is, but I mean, obviously I will support Hermes. I mean, it's right that, um,
Daniel: I mean, you cannot really tell this because you are not able to read Hermes' mind when he's on the table. But in the past, obviously, you could see that maybe he was a little bit hesitating, right? And I'm buying the point of if he commits a mistake and he gets nervous, lose confidence on himself, he could really have a problem. Obviously, Hermes is not new in this sport at all. He's...
Daniel: there for many years and now he has a lot of experience pulling with big names and so on. He has improved a lot since he lost against Devon. So I think obviously that Hermes is going to win. He's going 100% and that's it. I mean, Dennis could surprise us, yes, but I'm going with Devon.
Henry: with hermes i comment hermes devon devon is devon superman he can't even win a match between hermes and dennis yeah he wins matches that he's not a part of yeah okay all right so i hate constantly giving these arrogant confident predictions
Henry: i literally don't hate it come on just don't tell her well i hate it i hate it you love it no no i hate it because if it is a little bit close i look like i look dumb even if i'm right but i have to be arrogant and confident again i am almost certain that ermys is just gonna absolutely run through dennis i like i just when i close my eyes and i imagine the match
Engin Terzi: i don't see how dennis saplankov actually pins armies i could see him kind of stopping him maybe but like yeah don't show your arm like this go like more like this no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
Henry: way i think it was i think irma's back pressure would instantly take take uh pull him to his side and then i think he'll maybe side pressure maybe he'll have a little resistance and he can transfer to the press but like dennis would somehow need to have some center table strength that is like leagues above how it was against devon
Henry: I'm not saying he can't train up and get way better. And I also think that his endurance will be much better than Hermes. So if it kind of were to stop and maybe, you know, I don't know, but I'm quite convicted Hermes will win. I'll leave you an answer. Hermes. I'll leave you an answer. And he said what he said to Hermes. Artem you guys curious? Pineapple belongs on pizza. Is that what he said? He said, he said, he said bad moments, bad moments.
Engin Terzi: because because because Hermes says that you know when you're a bad moment and you feel good he said the bad moments you know this is what he said that's hilarious that is awesome oh yeah yeah he said he said yeah uh quick quick question nothing related to arm wrestling but how talking about Hermes and Vitalii sorry guys I need to ask this have you ever tried carbonara have you ever tried carbonara
Skyler: Pasta a la carbonara. What's he saying? It's a type of pasta? Yeah. Not that I know of. I mean, I might have, but not that I know of. What is it exactly?
Daniel: It's probably one of the most traditional or famous recipes from Italy. It's done with the pasta and the sauce, which is pecorino, egg, guanciale. Guanciale is like the kind of bacon from the face and the neck of the pork. And a bit of pepper, yeah.
Henry: Super tasty, super delicious. That's great. I was wondering if you ever try it. When I think of Hermes and Italy, I start to think about food. When I come to Italy, I will definitely be up for that because that is on the agenda for us. I feel like I probably have just living in LA. I live in LA, so there's all kinds of authentic food from around the world. I've probably had it before and I maybe just don't even remember, but I don't know.
Engin Terzi: okay guys slowly slowly it has been one hour and almost 15 minutes and guys um people ask me like is there anything with the reaction of this guy is there anything money involved paid i said yes there is money involved the guy paid me one thousand five hundred dollars
Henry: oh my gosh that's that's great again that's great that's exactly what you should be saying now yeah i think next time i think next time i understand you will not pay me but i maybe get a discount next time it's like one thousand one thousand for me for me to come back as long as you have the same business yeah yeah but but but i will sit there and i will do the exact same things again you know okay okay okay yeah
Engin Terzi: Anyways, guys, thank you very much. Thank you very much, Skyler. Thank you very much, Daniel. Thank you very much, Henry. It is always great to talk with you guys. And maybe we can do one more before the East versus West, 13, 14, whatever, you know.
Henry: I still want to come on and talk about the 13 keys of arm wrestling sometimes because I know they're here. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Can you like in two minutes short to say and then we talk maybe. I'll give a very short explanation. So the 13 keys of arm wrestling is a prediction model based on the 13 keys to the White House, which predicts American presidential elections.
Henry: I have a background in predicting American politics and predicting movements in financial markets. And the 13 keys, the White House is predict on earthquake prediction. So I made a model that predicts arm wrestling matches. It went five for five at the latest event, predicting every single match, all of the big matches. And then it retroactively has gone 31 and 32, predicting the biggest matches from the last year.
Henry: I believe that this prediction model will be fairly well known in the community and maybe one year from now when it shows that it is very, very, very good at predicting matches. But it has 13 questions that I answer the exact same way every single time into the past and into the future that can help you predict arm wrestling matches better.
Henry: So most people, when they make their predictions, they'll look at one or two data points. I like backing up, looking at the whole forest, not just one tree, looking at the whole story of the match, analyzing all of the different things to make the very best unbiased predictions possible. Interesting. Very interesting. Very interesting.
Henry: Yeah. And I have made one last thing. I made predictions for King of the Table 11. So I guess if I come back on, I will share those predictions, how I got to them and a little bit more about how the model was designed. Excellent. Okay. Sounds good.
Engin Terzi: Thank you, guys. And you all take care. Tell to your families. I say hello. Thank you so much. You're welcome. Thanks for having us on. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Have a good one. Take care, guys. Ciao, ciao. Have a good day, guys.
