Coach (possibly Engin Terzi): hey guys um coach right here uh we should be live here from East versus West Chance um today I'm gonna do a podcast to get a good chance show anybody give Sagov so maybe someone doesn't know uh engine head
Coach (possibly Engin Terzi): um emergency appendix surgery a few days ago and uh we still need to keep on working on the event that was like he he sent me a message I think 20 minutes before going into surgery uh so you will see some podcasts from me from Roman you will see also some uh from uh melon Madeline Bankstrom um she's gonna do with all the female pullers so yeah
Coach (possibly Engin Terzi): put your eyes out support East versus West uh at this point it's more than more than ever we need your support especially for this event uh if you're interested in a match if you're interested in something please share it send it to your friends you know just make sure everyone knows um okay
Coach (possibly Engin Terzi): uh let's see ibrahim sago is right now gonna join us here ibrahim i don't see him yet so guys if you have any questions um some super chats we're going to answer them we're going to talk about the event and everything else
Coach (possibly Engin Terzi): We are already waiting for Charles on the live broadcast. Charles! Let me translate it for you. How do you feel now? How are you feeling? I feel great so far. The mood is also fine.
Ibragim Sagov: Hey, hi Chance. How's it going? Hey. How's it going, Ray? How you doing, Ibragim? Hey, Chance. Hello, brother. Hello, hello.
Coach (possibly Engin Terzi): I asked Ibragim and I'll translate right now. I asked him how does he feel? He said he feels very good. He said mostly all the big training has been done. Right now it's just some small workouts and then just resting for a week before the big match. I want to ask you the same thing.
Coach (possibly Engin Terzi): uh you've been busy with uh challenger series definitely right how has been and and i have a question are you cutting down 115 kilos yeah so this morning i was uh when you look 5.
Chance Shaw: much 121.5 121 okay yeah so i can already water cut and be there but yeah slowly i'm cutting down when ingen called me i was like 140 141 like a month and a half ago so i've been taking cutting like extremely serious yeah like i have i have been perfect i hired a nutritionist i haven't gone off at all um as far as training goes like i'd be lying if i said i had an amazing training camp because
Chance Shaw: I don't know how Ingen does it, but running an event is like the most stressful thing I've done in my entire life. And so I didn't get to train as much as I would have liked to. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Chance Shaw: Could you not hear me? No, no, no. It was much better. Yeah. So, yeah, I was just like I was saying, I didn't get to train as much as I want to, but I'm feeling really healthy. Like as my weight comes down, like my numbers haven't changed at all. They've gone up a little bit. So I think I think I'm in good shape, not the best, but it was impossible to put 100% into training and event preparation.
Coach (possibly Engin Terzi): I'll translate for Ibragim, maybe he has some comments. I'll translate for you, Chance. I also asked him how he felt. He said he was 142 before Engin called him. And now he's 121 in the morning. He said he can go up to 115. He just did the Challenger Series, I don't know if you saw it or not.
Coach (possibly Engin Terzi): he was the main creator and he said it's a lot of stress there, maybe he didn't train as much as he wanted, but because the weight went down, how to say, the weight didn't change, he feels good there, but I don't know if there will be any surprises there, maybe there is some kind of comment on this, I don't know what I can say, well, 142 is a lot to throw away,
Ibragim Sagov: Well, I would, yes, if I'm not against it, if he's going to be 120 or 118, 120, I think you can leave it like that. I don't have a problem if he leaves it at 120.
Ibragim Sagov: I think we just need to calculate it on heavyweights. We need to be somewhere around 115 kg. I mean, there's not much of a difference. I don't feel like it's going to be 120, 122, 115. I don't care. I don't think these couple of kilos can stop me from winning.
Coach (possibly Engin Terzi): so he said the chance no problem if you want to come 120 we can like he said it's not a problem if you don't want to cut anymore it's fine you know you don't have to come down to 150 he said it's it's not a big difference it's cool if you but I said most likely you just want to do it to test yourself how you feel in that way right
Chance Shaw: I mean, the truth is, Ray, is regardless of what happens with this match, I plan on continuing to go down. I might even try for 105 in the near future. So, yeah, I'm happy to make 115 for this match. Okay, I'll translate for him. He said he wants to know that he can do it himself, so his plan is to go down to 105. How much do you weigh?
Ibragim Sagov: Last time you were against Saunders, 105 categories, now 115. Right now, in the morning, I'm around 116-500, in the evening 117, sometimes 118. 116-118.
Coach (possibly Engin Terzi): So he's right now at 116 kilos, 118 in the evening, something like that. So he just doesn't eat for a night and he weighs in. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He should be like that. Awesome. Chance, you definitely have seen the last two matches Ibragim has had in East versus West, right? What can you tell me about strategy-wise coming into this and where do you feel...
Chance Shaw: because it's very hard to turn you on the inside and i think this is why this match was so interesting for engen to put on together right yeah yeah i mean i definitely have a game plan and i have a backup plan as well um i i think that hooking with ibrahim is
Chance Shaw: really stupid. If I just went in and hooked him, I don't think that that would be very effective. So obviously, I'm going to try to keep him from hitting his press slash hook. So whether that's controlling center table or going back pressure or, you know, whatever, I'm not going to expose exactly what I'm going to do. But obviously, I feel pretty comfortable when someone tries to go inside with me. So we'll just see if my strength is high enough to keep Ibragim, you know, out of his strength position.
Coach (possibly Engin Terzi): Well, you saw him in the match with Sanders. Sanders tried to top roll him two times. David you learn something? Yeah, yeah. First two, like he was sucked into the hook. Only the last round he went against him. So it didn't look like Sanders set up like too low. Yeah, Sanders set up a little bit differently because he was trying to...
Chance Shaw: he was trying to get him off the side yeah just go back because if you go back with him he still gets something right i mean you don't want to be over here right then you're still going to lose because he can press through it but yeah yeah no i mean sandras is is amazing he's very versatile but i do i do personally feel like when it comes to keeping someone out of getting uh inside i feel like i'm i'm better than sandras there however i think sandras has a lot more fight inside
Chance Shaw: like i believe if ibrahim turns me inside i won't i won't really have much for him there
Coach (possibly Engin Terzi): Okay, I'll talk to him and ask him the same questions. Ibragim, I just asked Chance how he thinks about your technique against him. Why did Engin make this match? Because we see that Chance is very difficult to twist inside. He is very good at staying on his pronata. David you work on something else or will you show every time what you know?
Ibragim Sagov: Well, brother, I, in principle. Well, he chose Sanders at the top. I saw how it didn't work out for Sanders to come in here. Well, as for me, I could still try it with him at the top. I know that he has this strong movement. He fought like a slave. I saw him in the fight. Here's the side movement with the pronator.
Ibragim Sagov: Well, I have a trauma. I can't. I've been through trauma for a long time. I've been fighting for 30 years. Well, everyone knows about it. I won't risk it. I don't need it. I'll try to get into my own movement. Well, Sandlis couldn't get in. Zurab couldn't. Zurab's hand is small. His hand is small too.
Ibragim Sagov: Maybe it will be easier for me to get into my movement, since I don't know who kicked me in the top.
Coach (possibly Engin Terzi): I forgot, I wanted to ask you something. You watched the match against Andris, he watched the match against you, you watched the match against him. There's a lot of information there. I'll translate it for him.
Coach (possibly Engin Terzi): So he said he also watched your match with Sandris, your match with Zurab. And he said that those guys were not successful trying to get inside with you. You were very good at keeping on outside. He has an injury. So I asked him, like, will we see maybe something else? And he said, like, I can say I might do something else. Everyone knows what I'm going to do. He says that he knows you're very difficult arm wrestle to turn inside.
Coach (possibly Engin Terzi): I have a question for him. Can he fight if you take his hand? Ibragim, if there is a chance to take your hand, will you fight? Yes, I fight without a hand, of course. I fought with Tautil in a losing position without a hand.
Ibragim Sagov: I don't know. I'm fighting to the end. You know me. I'm fighting to the end. I can't say that I'll go into my movement confidently. I didn't stand with him, I didn't hold his hand. Everyone says that. Many people write in the comments. I saw that this is an easy victory for me.
Ibragim Sagov: Ibragim will win without a problem, but I don't think so, because I'm already, first of all, every opponent of mine, every athlete, but I don't know, I didn't fight with him, maybe I he will win me in the easy, yes, there he will take the brush and will push it into the easy there, maybe the first two rounds, maybe then I will take it, and what I don't know,
Ibragim Sagov: I didn't stand with him, I didn't hold his hand. He also didn't hold my hand. He also can't say that I won't be able to come in here. Those who stood with me, especially the top fighters, who fight, they know in what position and how I enter. It's kind of unusual, right? Not like the others.
Coach (possibly Engin Terzi): so he said uh first of all like uh i forgot from the last conversation we had he said uh there's not a lot of top rollers that actually top rolled him or beat him with a top roll so he feels confident there uh and he said if if chance takes my hand uh i i can armor so he said i have many matches in an in a defensive in offensive position he said it's not a problem uh
Coach (possibly Engin Terzi): he said like i cannot confidently say that i'm gonna just go there and get inside and people think like it's an easy victory or something like uh he knows you're strong he knows you're very difficult to turn in very difficult to get them there but he said you know me and um
Coach (possibly Engin Terzi): he arm muscles till the end he will like we saw it in a match versus todd hutchings he was just giving his all right he was giving it all to win that match and todd win it in the end and um definitely and i think he has done his homework he has seen all your matches so all the matches and i i have a question for you chance now because a lot of times you get the hand control you get the positioning and then the guys go for a flop
Coach (possibly Engin Terzi): they stretch you out and beat you have you had any chance to work on it and
Chance Shaw: Yeah. So originally when that became a problem is when I pulled the VR bully and in round two, when I pulled him, my elbow ripped like something in my elbow ripped. So I felt I didn't have the side pressure connection to go sideways. So that flop really hurt. And that's why that became an issue for me. Uh, however, since then, uh, luckily Vita cell biologics, they are by a global, they hooked me up and my elbow feels really, really nice. So, um, I don't think that'll be an issue. Um,
Chance Shaw: Obviously, I have a lot of strong guys in Florida to train with, and I've had them all slamming into my elbows as hard as they could. And I've tried to block that, and it hasn't hurt me at all. So I don't imagine that I will run into the same problem where if I have the hand on the winning side, that a flop press will work.
Chance Shaw: that being said if if i have the hand and i'm over here a flop press is still going to work because that's all the pressure down here but if i if i if i'm here or better i feel pretty confident i would say okay i'll i'll translate for him uh
Coach (possibly Engin Terzi): He said that when there was a match with Arabuli, he broke something here. And then, after that match, he said he couldn't hold it anymore. But now he got stem cells, Devon, like everyone else. And he says that the elbow feels very good. He feels that...
Ibragim Sagov: It's very comfortable if he looks at the position. But here he said, I don't know, but here I feel good. If you go away from the shoulder, the hand goes away from the shoulder, he will press normally. And if I'm in the composition, then I understand. I think, I don't know. As for speed, I think I'm faster. I think so.
Ibragim Sagov: I don't think he's in a hurry. He's in control. He wants control. I don't think it's good for me for my opponent to start.
Coach (possibly Engin Terzi): Ibragim said that most likely he will be faster. And then we had discussion. I said, like, most likely chance goes for control while you go for a pin. And he said, yeah, I don't waste any time. Because as a presser, you don't want to slow engagement. No, you can't. You can't. Yeah. And do you have any pressers that you have a chance to train with? Because it's like, you know, like real pressers are a weird thing, a really weird thing.
Chance Shaw: Yeah, I mean, luckily in Florida, we have pressers, top rollers and hookers, and we have pretty, pretty high level. I wouldn't say they're at Ibragim's level. There's not too many people in the world that are at Ibragim's level, but I have very strong pressers that I was able to train with. And like I said, I feel very comfortable. And when you're training to go against a presser, in my opinion, it all has to be ready goes. It cannot be slow because slow it's.
Chance Shaw: I mean, if the presser doesn't get what they want, it just usually doesn't work out. So yeah, everything has been ready goes, or in this case, it's been don't move goes because this is the East versus West rule. So I've been training for that. And again, I feel good. Artem they Ibragim? No, but we'll see how much it translated. I'll go with him. I asked Lucian if he had a chance to work with someone who also does press.
Coach (possibly Engin Terzi): He said, there are strong people, but there are very few people like you in the whole world. He said there was some kind of imitation, but this time he worked to take a quick start. He worked in a new way, because there is no ready go, there is don't move and only go. You are all in the top, you are in the top, it doesn't matter to you.
Ibragim Sagov: No, I don't have a special top or a circle there. I fight as I fight. I have one movement, everyone knows me. And no one will expect a special surprise from me, right? It's much easier for them. I have one movement. I work out in this movement as clearly as possible and go in there. But there may be such a top there.
Ibragim Sagov: Well, like Vitalii Laletin, yes, these are the terrible ones. With him, I don't know. Have you ever tried Vitalii? Yes, I tried. I was with him at the AMC, we fought absolutely. I wanted to, but I was afraid to come here. After my weight category, I became a champion at 50 kg. Then I went to the absolute, met Vitalii, and that was the final.
Ibragim Sagov: And I was afraid to come in here like this. I have a elbow, he can tear something there. And I just wanted to take it like this, from here. Well, it's just unreal. The hand is huge, very strong. And Vitalii is even faster. There are few top players like that, right? Also.
Coach (possibly Engin Terzi): so I asked him about like uh he's uh who's he working with and he said he works with all different kind of guys and he said but um there's not a lot of top rollers that actually can get out from what he's doing and he said and then I asked him about vitality and he said yeah of course yeah there's no chance like with Vitalii he said like he was even afraid to go inside from the center they met on AMC open
Coach (possibly Engin Terzi): And he said, I was trying to catch him because I thought it's better. And he said, even then, it felt like my arm is going to be ripped off because Vitalii is so weird and long, right? Yeah. Yeah. Let's talk about some matches and...
Coach (possibly Engin Terzi): let's pick some things uh we'll not we'll be maybe 20 more minutes ibrahim needs to go to sleep and i don't want to take chances time too and everyone's watching uh the big match the the let's start with the main event we have vitali latin artyom morozov uh ibrahim yeah
Ibragim Sagov: It's really hard. I respect both of them very much. I'm friends with both of them. Vitalii too. Artem. These guys are great. I'm even afraid to offend someone. Do you think Morozov can come in or do something to this top player? Well, you know, if he comes in, Morozov in the hook,
Ibragim Sagov: But there, well, I'm 90% sure he'll win, yes, this movement. Well, to go to Vitalii, to the hook, to twist him, all the more, damn, without a wrist, it's clear, if in the triceps, like this one, Yablonsky, yes, fought with him on the left, like that, then it would still be possible, yes, well, well, just twist him. I don't know how Artem will fight with him, but it will be very difficult. I will be in pain for both somehow.
Coach (possibly Engin Terzi): so he said it's uh for him it's hard to pick this match up because he he knows both guys and uh he spends times with those guys and he he hopes for best and then I asked him like is there like how does he see a possibility for Artem getting inside with Vitalii and he said like if Artem gets inside he wins 90 percent
Coach (possibly Engin Terzi): But getting there is the tough part. And getting there, keeping his wrist is even harder, right? So maybe flop wrist. And he said like 50-50. He thinks it's an amazing match and very hard to predict at this point. What are your thoughts, Chance?
Chance Shaw: I mean, I would agree. I think if Morozov is able to sink it inside, I mean, I wouldn't even say it's 90%. I think it's almost a guarantee 100% that he's stronger there. But sinking Vitalii is quite difficult to put him inside. So in my opinion, I think on paper, Vitalii, I pick 60-40, but I'm a huge Morozov fan, so I'm really rooting for him, and I hope he pulls it off.
Coach (possibly Engin Terzi): yeah it's a it's a really good matchup like yeah when they pull on left arm it's even better right that's what we all want to see for forever but that's that's definitely coming but at least we're going to see right arm and oh I I like that matchup because more I think about it more difficult it gets yeah right um Sasho and uh David chance yeah Sasho's coming down to 85. I know that I think that's the best class for Sasho um
Chance Shaw: it's incredible. It's an incredible match. I found myself picking against our bully, Samushia, I found myself picking against Samushia too often. But I will never pick against the guy who's like eight no, like he has beat every single person that Ingan has thrown his way. And it's never it's never by a large margin. They're always close. But
Chance Shaw: i don't know i just think i think sasha might be the guy to do it i don't see sasha losing if it goes inside and i don't see uh samusha taking him outside it's a really interesting match to me really interesting uh it's some samusha 55 45. it's an awesome match right because it's incredible it's so crazy good um ibrahim samusha
Ibragim Sagov: I think Sasho will fight in both hooks. Sasho is too strong for this weight. Plus, it doesn't matter if he loses weight.
Ibragim Sagov: How much strength will he have left? I think that Sasho was always 87 kilos when he participated. Well, yes, well, lately he's been 90, 93. That's how it was. Yes, yes, yes. He was 95. Well, I think that Sasho, without offense, I think that Sasho looks normal.
Coach (possibly Engin Terzi): If David wins Sasho, I think David is one of the coolest of all time. Definitely, eight times in the title defense. This is monstrous, this is unreal. He's the coolest. This is a co-main event, I can't wait. Last time against Nur Daulat Aydar Khan. It was scary, it was beautiful.
Coach (possibly Engin Terzi): so uh we talked and he said like uh well it's hard to bet against sasha mostly it's gonna be inside and it's it's very hard for uh sasha now we see him top roll and it's very hard to beat him at that weight uh let's see
Coach (possibly Engin Terzi): how much the weight cut does for him because he still needs to cut some weight to go down to that weight class uh and I said like what if he wins and he said like then he might be in a conversation of one of the best of all time right because it's like quite unbelievable achievement like
Coach (possibly Engin Terzi): he's not facing like the he's facing the some of the best of the best like literally at some point is like who else like where do we find the next one right and it's like I think he's uh putting pieces together and then we talked about uh with his match with right and he said that was like the best match of the last event and it definitely was yeah absolutely um David dadikian Oleg Petro
Ibragim Sagov: Ibragim, what do you think about Dadikyan? It's difficult, really. It's a very cool fight, especially after Petro beat Kadragali. I still give David more points. I think David will win 60-40.
Ibragim Sagov: I don't know if it's dry, of course, but I think the fight will be like that. Well, yes, it's very fast. Yes, that's what we all know. That's what he did there. There will be a fight, it will be very spectacular. And it's due to the speed, due to the side of this fast movement.
Ibragim Sagov: заберет думаю ну насчет выносливости петренко тоже очень выносливый да да да да но это принципе можно сказать непредсказуемо да вот очень 40 давиду я все-таки опять ракурса незнакомстве не знаю тоже от давида знаю давиду уже буду болеть
Coach (possibly Engin Terzi): So he said he knows David very well and he's supporting David, of course. And he said like 60 to 40 in David's favor. He believes David has the speed. Endurance might be somewhere even between them both. But he expects a war and he don't see that one guy will win. There's going to be pins on both sides. That's how he sees it.
Chance Shaw: Yeah, I mean, I mean, I would agree. I just want to say Petro has been looking like absolutely incredible. His first match against John didn't he didn't look so good. But after that, he's just looked unstoppable. He beat me 3-1. Then he beat Marcio 3-0. Then he beat Ungerbeid most recently 4-0. It's like incredible. And then, you know, on the flip side of that, we just saw Darakian beat Todd Hutchings, which is amazing.
Chance Shaw: i i think i think uh daddy khan is probably the favorite as well but it for me it's a coin toss i i i'd say it's almost 50 50 just a slight edge to daddy khan one of the matches i'm looking forward to most on the card yeah that's these three matchups that are like yeah at the end of the doc all incredible it's not just three right we have to go iraqli versus prudnik yeah yeah yeah
Coach (possibly Engin Terzi): right as great as iraqli is a top roller rudnik is right there with cook right how do you see that match i mean
Chance Shaw: don't know i don't know it's it's really it's a hard match for me because um i don't know if rudnick is back to where he was before he took some time off so for me that's the biggest question mark like um i saw him doing some after pulling not too long ago with uh kalinichenko and i saw kalinichenko was was pinning him and um i mean kalinichenko is a super heavyweight and whatnot but i feel like
Chance Shaw: two years ago that that wasn't really possible so i don't know if prudnik isn't back to where he is i think iraqli is going to shock some people and going to win this um i remember east versus west too after pulling i was recording uh iraqli and prudnik and it was just like whoever set their lane so they each pinned each other one time and i don't know it's going to be really really interesting i'm picking uh
Coach (possibly Engin Terzi): I'm picking Irakli, 60-40. Okay. It's another one, right? Yeah. Irakli against Prudnik. Prudnik didn't participate. I think Irakli will win. Yes, yes. Well, he said a little bit, 55. Yes, yes, yes. I don't know what form Prudnik is in now. We all don't know. Yes. If...
Ibragim Sagov: I don't know, in a bad shape, probably 100% Hercules wins. If Prudnik is in a very bad shape. But if he's just like that, I don't know, it's even hard to say. Hercules has also gained a lot lately. I think, too, probably 50-50.
Ibragim Sagov: I'm not sure. I know both. I don't know who will win. Heraklion also picked up very powerfully. I would like to say one thing, so that the audience can hear. Many people write to me. I had a fight with Heraklion backstage. I stood there. Everyone writes that Heraklion won me.
Ibragim Sagov: He couldn't do anything against Irakli. I just want to explain. There was a moment like this. We didn't fight Irakli. It wasn't even a sparring. He asked me before the fight, Sasho, to warm up his hand. Since I also fight in a hook, in a tricep, as well as Sasho. I put him like this, as Sasho will push. And carefully here.
Ibragim Sagov: It wasn't a fight, it wasn't a sparring. Everyone knew what everyone knew. I'm not saying I'm stronger than Irakli, but you don't have to think that Irakli won me over. Especially since he won't feel me. Messi, I don't know. People just need to understand.
Coach (possibly Engin Terzi): For this match, for him, it's also 50-50. He also doesn't know what kind of shape Prudnik is in. If Prudnik shows up and he's not in shape, then it actually has been looking very good. And then he said a small remark is he needs to get this out. So everyone watching. So there's a video of Ibragim.
Coach (possibly Engin Terzi): pulling with iraqli and people are like iraqli is kind of just smashing him and everyone was like oh iraqli beat him and easily so he said we didn't pull it wasn't after pool it wasn't nothing i was warming him up before the match versus sasha
Coach (possibly Engin Terzi): said then someone filmed it and put it out like we were pulling he's like i was helping him because i'm not saying i can beat him but we didn't we didn't arm wrestle at all just so you know i was helping him so yeah he just needed to get this out because uh he gets the comments and you know chance how it is right yeah yeah yeah i get it uh let's um grassy crossy and todd do you have todd as heavy favorite i i have todd as like
Ibragim Sagov: 85 15 favorite okay okay he said that 85 percent i can't say that i'm sure 85 percent you know why because we don't know how that one is now in what form yes after dadikyan we don't know right away and krasimir is gaining i see gaining
Ibragim Sagov: all the same, I think that he will win, but not with such a large percentage, I think I don't know the round, at least the round will take the world at least in the fall, so he will win, well, so my opinion is that he will win,
Coach (possibly Engin Terzi): so he believes he said that there's definitely going to be a fight and he believes Krassi will take at least one round but Todd will win at the end that's how he sees it yeah I mean I I hope I'm wrong but I I really don't think that this match is interesting I think Todd is like one or two levels ahead of Krassi and I'm a huge fan of Krassi it's just
Chance Shaw: One of those things where Todd is hard to go inside with. I mean, Ibragim should know that. And Crassie, as strong as he is, I mean, he just had a war with Lachlan and then Paul Lynn kind of walked through Lachlan. So to me, it's kind of different levels.
Coach (possibly Engin Terzi): Yeah, just for me, looking at those matches, I see it too. And plus, they pulled how many years ago? 10, 15 years ago, right? Yeah, exactly. Todd was very dominant. Let's see what cross he brings. Let's see what cross he brings. We have Travis Bajan coming back facing Kalinichenko. You just saw Travis. He competed on your event. Look, I saw him on the video. It's a different Travis Youngman. That's a different Travis Youngman.
Chance Shaw: so how do you feel about this travis uh i don't think that travis is quite back enough to beat sergey like if i was travis's manager i would have picked someone a little bit easier to start with um i think sergey is looking incredible lately like he's very powerful very strong hand if his hand gets taken he has a flop press he's very fast for a super like i think sergey's a bad matchup for travis like
Chance Shaw: I wish Travis would have taken his time a little bit more. Don't get me wrong. He looked amazing this weekend. Like, his timing, his speed. Like, he looked back and shaped that way. But I just don't think his power is going to be enough for all of those factors to matter. Too quick, right? Too big, too quick. Yeah. Yeah. I have Sergey. You have Sergey. I hope I'm wrong, but I have Sergey. Yeah.
Coach (possibly Engin Terzi): I asked Chance that he thinks Travis is coming back. Last week he participated with his left hand against Derek Smith. He won against Duko. But now he will be with Kalinichenko on the right. Chance said Kalinichenko. And he just saw Travis. I will definitely vote for Kalinichenko and Sergey. I will vote.
Ibragim Sagov: Travis, as far as I remember, he had a strong left. At the end of 2017, when both of them were at the same level. There were always a lot of lefts, but the right one... He has such big victories on the right, I don't think he has enough on the right. And how much he doesn't fight anymore. We don't really know what kind of form he has.
Ibragim Sagov: Well, I think it's Kalinichenko, of course. I don't even know what technique Travis is going to use. I don't know. I think it's going to be a fight at the top. I'm for Kalinichenko. I think Kalinichenko will win. 60-40. Kalinichenko.
Coach (possibly Engin Terzi): okay uh so he also said like uh he he he believes Travis has all his big wins on left arm his right arm is as good as it is has never been like as big as his left so and he believes kalinchenko is in showing and like every time better and better and
Chance Shaw: uh he'll he also picks Kalina to win yeah hey I will say though if Travis was in his best shape I think he would like destroy Sergey like I don't know if people know how good Travis was like in history uh on the right arm but he was he was one of if not the top guy in the world for certain periods of time so if he's close to that he'll run through Sergey I just don't think he is yet
Coach (possibly Engin Terzi): I want to see what happens, right? I want to see. Because Travis winning is awesome. Travis losing is also not that bad, right? Because there's going to be a lot of, a lot of. So just everyone just prepare. There's going to be a lot of things happening there.
Coach (possibly Engin Terzi): I guarantee you that. We're going to take one more look at one more matchup, and then I'm going to call it quits for today. We have Daniel Prokopchuk versus Bozhidar Simeonov. I think you both know these guys on the left arm. Last time they pulled, Bozhidar won.
Chance Shaw: yeah at the combat games right yeah yeah yeah yeah um even though bozidar won last time i am i'm never picking against prokopchik left-handed in his weight class like i don't care about the circumstance i think prokopchik is incredible um and i don't think it'll be a repeat of combat games i think prokopchik wins um bozidar might be able to find elaine one time but
Coach (possibly Engin Terzi): I don't know. I think Prokopchuk like 65-35. Okay. Ibragim, Daniel Prokopchuk versus Bozhidar Simeonov. Do you know them? Bozhidar won the World Combat Games last time.
Ibragim Sagov: This time to the left. But now we saw that Prokopchuk showed against Alan... Well, he showed it to the right. Yes, yes, yes. I won't guess for a long time. I think 50 to 50 too. Evgeny if he scored to the left, he won it recently, right? Yes. I think that what he scored is enough to score 50 to 50.
Coach (possibly Engin Terzi): Okay. He said, even though he lost not so long ago to Bojadar, the thing that like he definitely showed in a great shape versus Alonzo Lui, and he said that what he gained there is enough to make it 50-50 and make it a war. Guys, we're going to finish up maybe some last wishes to each other. I'll start with Ibragim. Ibragim, let's finish. What do you want to say, Chance? Chance, first of all,
Ibragim Sagov: I want to say thank you to him for taking my fight. I want to wish him good luck too. I respect him as an athlete. I will be glad to meet him as a person. We'll meet there. See you very soon. Well, I'll show you an interesting, beautiful fight.
Coach (possibly Engin Terzi): He said, first of all, he wants to thank you for taking this challenge. He respects you a lot like an athlete and he can't wait to know you as a person. He said, we're going to see each other very, very soon. And let's hope we show everyone just a great match.
Chance Shaw: yeah yeah well uh now you go full heel no no uh like same thing thank you to ibrahim for accepting this match um it's it's a very big challenge for me and uh i'm very excited for this match it's a sort of a comeback for me i haven't been
Chance Shaw: to East versus West in almost a year now. So I'm very excited to get back on the stage. And also it gave me, this match gave me a lot of motivation to cut down and wait and get healthy. So thank you to Ibragim for accepting it. And I hope that I'm strong enough to come out victorious, but I think the better man will win.
Coach (possibly Engin Terzi): He also said thank you for taking this match. This match gave him a lot of motivation, not only to train, but also for his health, to lose weight, to feel good. He hopes he will win, but he will win a strong one. Yes, he will win a stronger one. Okay, guys, I want to thank you both.
