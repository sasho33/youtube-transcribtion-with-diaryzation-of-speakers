Pavlo Dobrydeniuk: How are you, Pavlo? I'm fine. I'm recovering. I had an operation on my left elbow. It took me two months to recover. It will be two months tomorrow. I'm training now. I'll go to the first session and see how it goes. Do you need rehabilitation? No, I don't need it anymore.
Pavlo Dobrydeniuk: Rehabilitation. It's already been lifted. You said you had to prepare. Well, yes, yes. I don't have time. I have to prepare. When is the fight? Well, it's scheduled for September 7th. I haven't replaced him. Scott Merritt. First place in America. We'll see. I don't know. Well, it doesn't look bad yet. We'll see. Maybe I won't get to what it was, but it will be close. It will be close. Because I already got to 75% somewhere. It's okay.
Oleg Petrenko: Well, it started 24 weeks ago. Good. Well, I think the victory will be. Yes, it will be. You need to save yourself. How are you? I'm fine. I'm ready. I'm ready, bro. I see, I see. You're there, packing, holding such a form. Tell me, what are you doing? Yes, yes. Ryan, how are you? How are you doing?
Raymond: Everyone joining us on our podcast. We have the challenger for the 105 world title, Oleg Petro. Pavlo Dobrydeniuk will help us with translation from Ukrainian. David Dotykyan will join us a little bit later. Maybe Engin is coming. Maybe Devon will join us as well. So we'll see.
Raymond: Pablo, thank you for doing this. You already explained to Oleg your situation with your arm. You had surgery. Tomorrow will be two months. You have a match in September. Tell everyone, how do you feel? How is your form? And when we will see you back?
Pavlo Dobrydeniuk: my form yeah yeah come on hey listen listen we have to give you thank you and we have to give you yeah i'm okay my my right is actually very good i'm getting to the big form my left is still a little bit behind i'm at about 75 now but gaining really really fast i'm happy with what's going on a couple of concerns you know with a grip a little bit and with a riser a little bit but um
Pavlo Dobrydeniuk: yeah my super match is September 7 in Toronto with Cody merit left for number one in North America because he's number one now yeah so we'll see I'm I'm getting ready I'm getting ready yes you look good you look almost almost as big as you look when the last time I saw you yeah my weight actually is almost the same it's a little bit different here so I still have it but I'm working on it
Raymond: working on transformation from here to here. That's very good to hear. Let's go to Oleg before everyone else joins. So you will fight for the title versus David Dadikyan.
Raymond: You had amazing performance in King of the Table on your debut there versus super, super, super impressive Kidrigali Ongabayev. How did you feel in that match? Talk us about that match. Were you nervous or you knew you're going to be level ahead?
Pavlo Dobrydeniuk: We say that soon you will have a title fight with David. He says that you performed very well on your debut in Dubai on the first match on the King of the Table against such a cool opponent as Kedar Gali Andreev. How did you feel going into this match? Were you confident in yourself, were you worried, or did you know that you would dominate higher on the head?
Oleg Petrenko: Thank you, it was really my evening. I calculated that we would have a 50-50 fight. I prepared well for Pederhali, I taught him. He is quite a one-sided athlete. It was hard for me to understand how he would fight.
Oleg Petrenko: He's saying that, yeah, thank you very much. And yeah, he was expecting that it will be like 50-50 match.
Pavlo Dobrydeniuk: But Oleg did his homework very well. He gained his probably best peak form of his life. And yeah, he knew that Kedar Gali is very, you know, good athlete and he can arm wrestle any angles. He was getting credit very well for that. And that definitely was his night. But now he's maintaining the same form and not only maintaining, but trying to progress.
Raymond: so he's in very good shape best in his life still okay so uh david is joining us uh david uh motivation you
Raymond: We have the champ here in the house. He will set everything up. I still want to ask a little bit to Oleg. What concerns me, you think you definitely deserve the title match and it's awesome that you're getting it. Artem you a little bit afraid that it's so close? It's just been, what is it, three, four weeks and it's five weeks preparation. Is that a little bit of concern or you felt you didn't waste any energy and you just continued?
Pavlo Dobrydeniuk: He says, yes, you deserve such a title fight, great performance, everything is great. He asks if you are a little worried about the fact that there is little time between matches and that this may affect your preparation. David you not spend too much energy and just continue your preparation?
Oleg Petrenko: Yes, I would like to have more time, but I could not refuse such a proposal, because I have been waiting for this proposal for a long time, I am going to it, I do not have enough time. Emotionally, yes, there may have been a bit of exhaustion, but now I feel good, in good shape. This month I had an appointment at the table, I fought a lot.
Pavlo Dobrydeniuk: Yeah, Oleg's saying that, yeah, absolutely, I would love to have a little bit more time, but, you know, I'm not saying no to proposals like this because I was getting to this proposal pretty long time and it was, you know,
Pavlo Dobrydeniuk: uh my goal and uh he said yeah on the very beginning i was emotionally maybe a little bit uh you know uh tired but now i feel very very good and he's doing uh lots of uh table time he does what's need need for david but uh uh he doesn't really do much uh base exercises he's getting ready on the table mostly okay um i want to ask david uh david
David Dadikyan: I'll ask in English and then I'll translate it. What do you think about Oleg's performance versus Kidrgaly? David, what do you think about Oleg's performance versus Kidrgaly? It was very good. Oleg killed Kidrgaly. I knew it. I thought he would win.
Pavlo Dobrydeniuk: but not so strong or easy. But well done. David saying very impressive, very good performance. He expected that Oleg may win, but he never expected that it's going to be that big of the gap in domination. So it was a surprise for him that it was so easy for Oleg. Is that a concern now to him because you have to face him five weeks later?
Pavlo Dobrydeniuk: How do you feel now that you'll have to face such a strong opponent in five weeks? Very strong. I can see how I feel. I'm sweating. David's saying, yeah, yeah, very, very much. I'm nervous very much. I'm all swearing, you can see that.
Raymond: Oleg, you saw his performance versus Todd Hutchings in the match. Where is David most dangerous and where do you believe you have the best chances of beating him? Oleg, you saw how David fought with Todd Hutchings, in which angles and how it all happened. Excuse me.
Pavlo Dobrydeniuk: No problem. I forget where I'm going. How do you think, in which corners will you have the easiest or most difficult fight with David? I think my easiest fight will be if I open David's mouth. The hardest will be in a deep cry.
Pavlo Dobrydeniuk: He's saying that the easiest way is if I will be able to open up his wrist, and the hardest one, it will be in a deep, deep hook. I have a feeling this is where the match will go, in the deep hook. He says, I have a feeling that it will be deep, deep. Well, it can be, I refuse it. I'm ready to fight there.
Pavlo Dobrydeniuk: Yeah, it's possible. He's saying that he's ready to pull anywhere. David, the same question. Where does he think Oleg Petro is the most dangerous? And where does he believe he has the best chances of beating him? David, where do you think Oleg Petro is the most dangerous? And where do you think you have the best chances? I know Oleg Petro is going to the top, to the hook.
David Dadikyan: Oleg's crown fight is probably more in the top. Because, as I saw, all the movements start from the top.
David Dadikyan: I think I'm the same as Oleg. I can fight with my upper hand, with my right hand, with my hook. So, where will the fight go? You know, after the Radikov team, who will impose what kind of fight, either he will succeed, or I will. But after that, it will be clear who will enter what kind of fight. And so, we'll see, I don't know. And where will you try to succeed? Well, my strength is the same.
David Dadikyan: I don't think I'll fight with a hook, because everyone on the Internet knows how to fight. And everyone knows that I fight with a hook. I'm not such a top fighter that I can fight with a hook. Yes, I can try. I tried it with Irakli, it worked out somehow. But of course, I'm a hooker, I fight with a hook, I want to try a hook. He's a top fighter, he's trying to open my wrist, but on the contrary, to twist it. That's our fight, I think.
Pavlo Dobrydeniuk: for our english speakers ray ray yeah yeah yeah yeah sorry you want me to translate everything yeah maybe don't don't just sum it up sum it up okay uh so yeah david is saying yeah it's not a secret that uh i'm uh better in a hook puller
Pavlo Dobrydeniuk: But I also can pull and tap roll and I tried with Irakli, very successful. But I will try to hook. Oleg most likely will try to tap roll me. And whoever will get the best position is basically the winner. But we both can pull in both positions. So we'll see.
Raymond: yeah i like uh the story is easy like everyone's no one's gonna make something new right and like david said if the match everyone you can watch the videos and then kind of know what everyone's gonna do and uh like he said he wants more in a hook he will try top pro sometimes it worked uh he stopped robot perfectly where sir actually that's like um i i was surprised by that uh oleg um
Pavlo Dobrydeniuk: When David pulled with Irakli, he top-rolled him all rounds pretty much and dominated that match. Was that a surprise to you? Yes, it was a surprise. I didn't think that David could fight so high.
Oleg Petrenko: Against Irakli, such a top player, very good, he is one of the best. In 1995 he was the best. It was very strong. I think that maybe David tried to win with me.
Pavlo Dobrydeniuk: yeah yeah he's saying that yes it was a surprise and he said yeah luckily he's very good top roller and he's the best top roller at 95 kg and uh he was surprised that uh david can uh do such efficient tap rolls and he said he probably can try top roll with me we'll see
Oleg Petrenko: He's saying if we're going to turn into the hook, it's going to be for a long, long time and nobody's interested for a long, long pulse there.
Pavlo Dobrydeniuk: we are oh yeah that's right we are it's it's about that everybody knows everything in arm wrestling uh watch uh watch match uh between wilton brock and uh matt mask yeah it's about what we know we know nothing right yeah yeah you're like there's no chance matt will hook him and matt hooks him
Pavlo Dobrydeniuk: What's a big surprise for me, David? I'll ask you this for David.
Raymond: That you're a world champion on the right arm, not on the left. Is that also a surprise to you? I always won the World Championship on the right and left arm.
David Dadikyan: But in the warfights, I only fought on the left. I fought with Zhokh. And after breaking my arm, I had to rebuild. I had no other option. Either I had to give up and not fight, because I still don't train the left, or rebuild. I rebuilt. The left was always on my right. It was always working. But I was lagging behind the left.
David Dadikyan: Paolo, can you please translate this? Yeah, David saying that, yeah, I...
Pavlo Dobrydeniuk: I used to win left and right on a World and European Championships, but after he broke his arm, he did not have too much choices, but either, you know, give up or just bring his right arm to the point where it's the same as left, so he can be competitive on the right arm. And now he's saying that his form on the right is very good and he's, by lifting weights,
Pavlo Dobrydeniuk: he is the same as it used to be on his left arm in his peak well i know we're having a right arm match but i would be super interested in a match between both of these guys on the left arm can you just translate to russian and ask their thoughts about it ray говорит что говорит я знаю что у нас матч на правых руках говорит но мне было бы супер интересно посмотреть матч на левых руках
David Dadikyan: Yes, I literally started rehabilitation today. Today I had my first procedure, or rather two procedures.
David Dadikyan: I will go through 10-15 days of these procedures. After that, I will do a second MRT and I will see if my arm gets better or worse. If it gets better, then I will start training and preparing somewhere. If not, then, probably, it will be an operation. And after that, I will restore it. Well, in the plans, of course, I am already doing it with my left hand. It's been a year since the Prudnik fight.
David Dadikyan: That's why we're waiting. I can't wait to come. We have Alizhan in the first place, so we need to create competition. I've been waiting for a left-handed fight for a long time. How? I didn't understand what he was saying. He says he's been waiting for a left-handed fight for a long time. That's why, especially if someone saw it or didn't see it in 2019,
David Dadikyan: Oleg beat me on the Zloty Tour. It was the 95th category on the left hand. So you have to fight Oleg. And with everyone. You can fight a lot of things. So everything will be.
Pavlo Dobrydeniuk: david is saying okay first part of it is that he is working on rehabilitation his left arm he did the two procedures already and he's watching uh the progress in about two weeks he will have another mri and uh he will see if it's a progressing then he will start training and will progress it if it's not then it's uh unfortunately surgery with which will be a little longer rehab but he is planning to be back because he said
Pavlo Dobrydeniuk: David, did you fight in 2019 with your right hand? Yes, you did.
David Dadikyan: Yes, I became 3rd on the right and 4th on the left. You didn't meet, right? No, Oleg and I didn't meet on the right. So you have never pulled each other or have you pulled on WAF? No, not on the right. When I fought in the 100 kg division, Oleg weighed 75-80 kg.
Raymond: okay so they never pulled and when uh when david was pulling 100 kg it wasn't for 85 kg 85 yeah so now now both are very big boys very very strong boys um it's it's hard for me to uh to because i know how great both of you guys are it's hard for me to pick this match i'm looking at people and uh
Pavlo Dobrydeniuk: they're saying that uh not not by much but david is 60 favorite right uh i want to ask david does he feels like he is the favorite in this match he is watching the statistics right now who is voting online for what and it turns out that you david are about 60 percent favorite how do you feel do you feel like a favorite or not or do you think differently
David Dadikyan: I don't know. I always prepare well. If my form is good, I always feel confident. It doesn't matter if the audience thinks I'm an underdog or not. My form is good. I don't have any excuses. My hand doesn't hurt, thank God.
David Dadikyan: The preparation went well, so yes, I am confident in myself, I am confident that I will win, so I am performing as I think any normal athlete will think so. Yes, I am sure that I will win this fight, the victory will be mine, of course.
Pavlo Dobrydeniuk: Yeah, David is saying, listen, my training is going very well. There is no pain. And when I'm in good shape, I'm always confident that I'm going to win. And he believes that every athlete going into the supermatch, normal athlete, he said, will feel that way because otherwise, why going there? And he said, yeah, I'm pretty confident and I'm pretty sure that I'm going to win.
Oleg Petrenko: Oleg, how do you feel about what David just said? Oleg, are you feeling good? I feel good. I have a good form, as I said. I went to that fight a month after the last one, because I understand that I'm ready. Ready to win, ready to fight.
Oleg Petrenko: I'm not very interested in statistics. I understand that viewers consider David to be the favorite, because he is now the winner of the title. And I like it even when I'm not a favorite.
Pavlo Dobrydeniuk: Oleg is saying that, yes, I feel very good. My preparation, as I said, I'm at my peak. I'm in very good shape. I'm very confident. And he said, yeah, listen, if our online watchers thinking that David is a favorite, it's normal because he's current holder of the belt, right? Of the title. And that's normal. And Oleg said, I even like to be a little bit on underdog position. It will motivate me more. Okay.
Raymond: I like the both guys are very, very confident and I know how both they are on the table. I'm super excited for this match. I think this is probably one of the, for me, one of the most interesting matches on the card because both of them are so great and the last performances were just absolutely amazing.
Raymond: I have some questions coming in from a lot of people, but we're going to get to them and then we're going to talk about other matches. But I want to get to one thing. So David was supposed to pull Devin Larratt before this. Is this an easier match or harder match?
Pavlo Dobrydeniuk: David, before that, you had to fight with Larap, but it was canceled. Which of the matches do you think is more difficult? This one or that one? Of course, with Oleg Petrova Saluslavov. David is already behind.
David Dadikyan: Devon was given a chance to fight in the 105th category. He let it go. I suggest that he monitors the fight in the 105th category all the time. Let's win, and the champion will decide who to fight. Devon will have to give a couple of fights.
David Dadikyan: not title fights. He wins a couple of fights, then you can only do title fights. Listen, I'll drop it to 105, I'll take it with him. By the way, the 105 category is very competitive now. I think it's the biggest competitor for right-handed fighters. That's why it's not very honest to give him a title fight right away. Therefore, Devon will go through a couple of fights, then he will fight for the title.
Pavlo Dobrydeniuk: okay david is saying that uh listen uh for sure uh oleg petrenko match is much harder devon is far far behind and he lost his chance he got the chance to pull 105 championship match and now he david is thinking that he needs to pass uh at least a couple matches before he got a title match you know to deserve that match in that class and he said yeah it's very competitive plus at 105
Pavlo Dobrydeniuk: which is yes it is that's why I commented that you know what I will eat better and sit in 115 kg class yeah it's it is super competitive class and uh um
Raymond: like okay david will have another match i think it's already set right after this one so it doesn't like he he got that match no matter what uh engin thursday is right now trying to join us uh
David Dadikyan: Yes. What's the match? It should be in America with Michael Tone in August. Well, depending on the fact that, God willing, we will perform well here, we need to be without injuries. I say, thank God, God willing, that without injuries. And after that, you can... I honestly don't even think about it yet. We agreed. But in general, I threw it out of my head, tuned in to this fight. God willing, we will win here.
David Dadikyan: And then I'll think about it. The main thing is no injuries.
Pavlo Dobrydeniuk: yeah he's saying yes it's uh the match was set with uh Michael in August Michael monster Todd in August in the United States but he said I I'm not shooting for this did that match yet I don't think about that match yet uh I'm very concentrated on this match and then uh if I win and uh I wish I win and then uh I will start preparation for the next
Raymond: I want to ask Oleg how does he would feel like if let's say he wins the title and then he has to face Devon Larratt in his mind which is easier match Devon with his style or David with his style? Oleg, I have the same question for you. If for example you can win this match and you are offered a match with Larratt, which match would be easier for you? With David?
Oleg Petrenko: And with Larat? I haven't fought with David yet. And I haven't fought with Larat. I think the problem is that they are on the same level. When Larat drops to the 105 category, he won't be the Devon that he is now. And this was in the last round of the fight. Because we didn't fight that Devon with David. But when Larat drops to the 105 category, I think there is a chance to fight him.
Pavlo Dobrydeniuk: Yeah, he's saying that, listen, I think that David and Devon is somewhere on the same level, but he's saying, listen, that Larratt who was pulling in super heavyweights, it's a different Larratt when he's dropping to 105 kg. Probably he doesn't have too much of the chance to pull that super heavyweight Devon, but in 105 kg, it's very, very achievable, he said, and it's very possible. Okay.
Raymond: We have Engin Terzi joining us from the other side. Engin. Hello, hello, guys. How are you? Everyone wants to know how you're doing. Is it getting better? How do you feel physically, mentally? It was getting better this morning.
Engin Terzi: little bit bleeding you know from the stitches and i went to a doctor and it's okay you know um yeah everything is fine so i missed that part while being connected how did you end up david and uh uh larat
Raymond: David said Oleg is a harder match for him. He believes it's not the same heavyweight that it was at 105 it's going to be, and he believes Oleg is stronger and more difficult opponent. So am I now better? Yeah. Yeah, okay, okay. So hello, guys. Hello, Oleg. Hello, David. Hello, Oleg.
Engin Terzi: well hello hello uh paulo how are you my friend i'm good how are you good good good good good also hanging also he said that uh he doesn't believe that devon deserves straight away title match he should had some matches and to prove himself at that weight before he gets a title match for 105 yes david said that but but like he is actually a weight champion
Engin Terzi: I mean, yeah, you know where it is. He is just dropping the title, not because somebody challenged him and lose, okay, except David, but he had some, okay, that's interesting. Looks like we are just going through a very heated press conference. Can you ask David, is he planning to say these things to Devon's face at the press conference?
David Dadikyan: David, are you going to repeat the same thing to Larratt right in front of the press conference? Tell me, when are we going to refuse our words to Engin? We always answer for our words. We gave Larratt and Engin a chance to fight for the title without any in-game fights. As long as I'm the champion, God willing, I'll stay that way. Then he'll fight a couple of times and come for the title.
Pavlo Dobrydeniuk: David says, yes, I never give up on my words. And he said, listen, me and Engin give Larratt a huge chance to pull for a title belt straight from, you know, from this title. And he, you know, lost his chance. Now we will give him another chance, but he has to pull a couple of matches before that to prove that he did it.
Engin Terzi: And Oleg, what do you think about in Orlando, Michael versus Dadikyan match? Is it going to be a world title match or no? Oleg, what do you think about Michael's monster match in Orlando and David? Will it be a title match? No, it won't be a title match. But it's 115, right?
Engin Terzi: no no it's 105. oh no no no no no no no no no no it is 115 but listen this is a title match it could be a title match it is because david is the champion of 105. so if that is not the one of five champion if it is already the champion that they will not be a title match because the only reason that i said david
Engin Terzi: Devon has a title match. It is because one was the heavyweight champion, one was the light heavyweight champion. So you are saying that, Oleg, that is not going to be a title match? It won't be a title match, because I will have the title. And it will be hard for David to fight Mike, because after me, he will be with you, I think.
Pavlo Dobrydeniuk: He's saying, no, it's not going to be a title match because I will be holding the title after that. And David will be so tired after me. It's going to be a very tough match for David. This is bad news for Michael Todd. Michael Todd will fly to Istanbul to be in David's corner just so he wins, just so he can get the title shot. Can you translate that, Paolo, to their language here? No.
Pavlo Dobrydeniuk: What fascinates you in this match?
Engin Terzi: what what is uh because it's this match is incredible much incredible like I really hope that there will be a time that majority of the community will be arm wrestling fan more than the fan of an arm master that their interest is limited with only with that person because this match
Engin Terzi: After what Petro did in Dubai, and after what David did against Tata Chinks, I mean, this is just off the roof. I can't imagine. Just imagine the pressure. Just put them in the strap, and just think that you are also strapped with them.
Engin Terzi: like don't didn't you feel already paying you know just like you know you don't want to feel the pressure when they start the power over there it's just like like like nuclear you know just like i mean both of them are incredibly strong and i'm very happy for them no matter who wins who loses they both are uh great bullers
Pavlo Dobrydeniuk: Engin says, listen, this is a great, amazing match. After Oleg won and how he won in Dubai at Kidr Ghali and after what David did with Hutchings, I can't even imagine how it will happen. I can only imagine that if we tie them in a strap, what kind of atomic pressure there is. I imagine myself in some kind of fight, everything hurts right away.
Pavlo Dobrydeniuk: And he also says that our whole society will soon be armwrestling fans, that not only will they watch some championship fights at the very top, but also all the fights that take place at the top level, that all this will change soon, that everyone will watch all the matches that take place.
Engin Terzi: Yeah. Guys, I feel a little bit like no energy. I go. Thank you very much, Paolo, for the translation. Raimon, thank you very much for running this. Petro, see you in Istanbul, my friend. David, see you in Istanbul. Bye again. Bye again. Yes, take care. Bye-bye. Get better. Bye. Thank you. Thank you. Bye again.
Raymond: I just want to say we are like, Engin is very special person enormously. I think he doesn't feel good at all, but he just wants to be part of this. We text every day and just to get in touch and talk about some things that are happening.
Raymond: it's just insane his love for the sport and like east versus west is his baby and this is what he's giving to us to the world and these guys are what is it like i would say they deservingly are part of the main event this match i'm very excited for for both of these guys but let's talk a little bit about some other matches that aren't on the card and uh guys thoughts about some big matches and
Raymond: David, what do you think, Samushia vs. Sasho? Samushia. Samushia? Yes. I want Samushia.
David Dadikyan: I don't want to talk about the fights and all that, but Samushia has been a fighter for a long time. He keeps his character in such places. And thanks to his strength, his character, his perseverance, he wins. I'm very surprised. He's very good, very. He always hits with his fist. I don't know. I believe that Sasho will win. David Samushia will win. Oleg? I think...
Oleg Petrenko: I think Sasho will win, but I root for David Samushia. David said that his character, his fighting skills are very similar to Samushia. His fights are very bright, I like it. But I think Sasho will win. But I root for David Samushia.
Pavlo Dobrydeniuk: so uh so yeah david says that uh he thinks and he wants that samusha will win because of the his uh his uh character on the table and how how he's performing uh all the things that's a show will win but he's still gonna cheer for samusha because he is a real fighter
Raymond: i just want to say like if if some like if samushia pulls this off he is in conversation with one of the like the most the greatest pullers especially in that class like that would be his nine title defense it's which is insane right um i have a feeling like like um
Raymond: samushi can put it in another gear when he wants to like he can he drives fast and he's like i can go faster that's how i feel it's a super super just amazing match um
Oleg Petrenko: You both know these guys very, very well. Prudnik, Irakli. Oleg. If Prudnik stops Irakli, I think in the second or third round he will be able to stop him and win. But the first round, maybe the second, will be for Irakli. Because Irakli is very strong. And maybe Prudnik will be uncomfortable.
Pavlo Dobrydeniuk: David, what do you think about Irakli Prudnik?
David Dadikyan: Irakli is very strong, but it seems to me that Irakli just lacks power and weight. As I understand, he has a problem gaining weight, you know, for 105 kilograms. 105, yes. And this will be 105, it will not be 95. Therefore, it seems to me, if it were 95, I would put Irakli. This is his weight. And here, it seems to me, he just, well, maybe, well, there is not enough strength, power to fight with Prudnik. Because of the weight, I think so.
Pavlo Dobrydeniuk: so david's saying that uh it's very possible that uh iraqli is just not powerful enough for 105 kg 95 kg it's definitely his class but 105 kg he said yes he's very very strong but maybe it's a little bit lacking of that weight and exact power so he thinks that prudnik have a slight slight edge in 105 kg
Raymond: David, have you ever fought Krasimir? No, I have never fought him.
David Dadikyan: I don't know. It's hard. I can't answer honestly. 50-50, I think. You know, when I fought Hutchings, everyone said, oh, Hutchings, get into the hook, he'll break you. Yes, very strong. But I know Krasimir, he's been fighting in the hook for 100 years, and he's also very good. So I think it's a very spectacular fight there, 50-50. I don't know, honestly, I can't answer.
Pavlo Dobrydeniuk: he's saying that that's really 50 50. he cannot say because yeah he's he he he thinks it's really really close because it's gonna go into the hook and Krazy is super super good in a hook and that Hutchings he pulled him is very very strong and he said that's that's gonna be one of the best matches
David Dadikyan: I like how David said that Krassik has pulled in a hook for a hundred years. If Hutchings stops dancing this chicken dance, maybe he'll get together and win. I've rewatched my fight, when I did a fall special, and I saw that he was dancing this chicken dance. I said, what a grown man. I need to watch it. I saw it myself recently. I said, what is he doing?
Raymond: Let them not do it and it will work out. David says that Stade Hutchings has to stop to dance his chicken dance and then everything is going to be achieved. I have to go and re-watch the match. I don't know what he's talking about. Do you know, Pavlo, what is this chicken dance? No? Okay, we'll go watch it. We'll see it. Oleg, what do you think about Todd vs. Krasimir?
Oleg Petrenko: Well, I'll give a little compliment to Krasimir. Because of the fact that he is gaining weight with every match, he is growing, gaining his best form. And Hutchings was already at the peak with Narabayev, with Dadikyan. I think this is his peak and he will not hold it for so long. Plus, he has to finish the dance.
Pavlo Dobrydeniuk: Other things that Krazy probably will have a slight edge because he's gaining constantly match to match. And he doesn't believe that Hutchings will bring better form than he was before. That it's impossible, you know, to peak every time that high. And he said, yeah, and he have to stop dancing. Serhii Kalinichenko versus Travis Bagent.
Raymond: travis is coming back uh he just had a left arm match this is on the right arm um travis uh
Oleg Petrenko: I know that Kalina is now in his best form. He has gained a lot of weight and strength. But the question is, what kind of trevis does he wear? No one knows. I think that Kalina wears it. It depends more on the trevis and the match than on the knee.
Pavlo Dobrydeniuk: both both of them saying that uh kalina gonna win and uh oleg uh commented that uh polina is in his best shape and he gained a lot and he's super super strong but he said you know it's never let's never underestimate travis because it's very depends on in which shape travis gonna show up i think we're all wrong pablo you are part american now so what do you think
Pavlo Dobrydeniuk: i i will not uh predict this because it's unpredictable but it's it's does not matter how good kalina is at the moment it's only matters if travis will win that set up and start game that's that's all that's all about that's all about if if if travis gaining his position of the goal
Pavlo Dobrydeniuk: there is not too many people on this planet who will pull him off that position so it's it's going to be very very interesting on the left I would say Trevor is going to murder him on the right side I pulled Travis many many times and I practice pulse and I know what's up but when it's ready go it's different it's just different yeah he's he's very very unique in in some ways right um
Pavlo Dobrydeniuk: yeah and what i saw in challenger series like that's uh pretty in shape travis right yeah he's he's getting in shape he's training he's you know uh eating he's what creating he said right so he's yeah he shaped i think he's created
Raymond: um that sounds exactly like uh travis um okay uh we have tomorrow for tomorrow podcast i have artem tainov but kill you on iani roman's gonna join us there as well um artem tainov but kill you on iani on the left arm david uh
David Dadikyan: Well, it depends on what form he is in. If he has a good form, it will be very difficult for Artyom. I myself fought with Sonny Anin behind the scenes. He has very long levers. He goes very deep into the hook. And Taynov has short levers. It will be difficult to fight with Sonny Anin.
David Dadikyan: Evgeny more so, if they get hooked, I think they'll get hooked because of the endurance. He's so wild, so thin, and he's so strong. I'm afraid he'll overdo it.
Pavlo Dobrydeniuk: he's saying uh yeah that because of the difference in the livers on the hand livers or arms livers and yani is very long uh livers he's very deep deep inside the hooks you know very comfortable and uh artyom has shorter arms forearms uh it's going to be very hard for our job to pull any any um
Pavlo Dobrydeniuk: I think Oniani will win. I like this fight and I saw that he was fighting in this tournament. It's a very good fight. He's in his peak form. Oleg's thinking is the same that Oniani is having edge and he will win because Oleg is like his style and he saw Artyom pulling on a tournament recently and he didn't like what he saw.
Raymond: um oniani looked insanely good versus target active i i expected it to be like he would stop him a little but he dominated that match and absolutely just insane performance would earn him a title shot and i think very well deserving um we have chance shaw versus ibrahim sago chance is coming down from 140 kilos he was 120 kilos last week
Pavlo Dobrydeniuk: So, and Chance's best weapon is he's very hard to hook, to get him outside, like to get inside his hand, to get inside, turn his pronator. What do you guys think about that match? Can you translate? What do you think, guys? Ibragim Saghav vs. Chance Shaw. Chance Shaw is losing 140 kg. He's already 120 kg now. And everyone knows that his crown is hard to twist into the hook because of his...
Oleg Petrenko: here in the hand and the pronator is very good, he just pulls on himself, so no one can turn him into a club. Saga will win. Saga. I have a chance to fight him, but I don't think Saga can win him, because I didn't manage to do it.
Oleg Petrenko: I will try it myself. I think he will reveal it. I bet on a chance. Obviously. Oleg, do you bet on a chance? Yes, on a chance. And Sakhov will lose? Yes, Sakhov will lose. And you think he will win, right, David? Yes.
Pavlo Dobrydeniuk: ah okay ah it's different it's different okay i'm sorry so all the things that sagov will not win he will lose to chance because uh sagov will try to do this thing to chance and he will open up his own risk basically and then chance will pull him out but david thinks that
Raymond: okay okay that's interesting because he has pulled him right so he has some oh it pulls him and he has some idea how it works yes yeah yeah uh zurab tabaridze is coming back with right arm after his arm break pulling petrol marketing uh i would like in my mind i'm thinking maybe it's way too fast especially such a tough opponent as petro margarine but i think um
Raymond: Because Zurab, like Petro just pulled Nugo and I think Zurab has access to Nugo and maybe he felt that, okay, I could arm wrestle with him and now I can arm wrestle with him. What do you guys think? Is Zurab ready to pull after an arm break versus someone like Petro Marharint?
Pavlo Dobrydeniuk: Zurab is coming back after a broken arm with his right hand and he will have the first supermatch against Petro Marharint. And he says that, well, how do you think, is he ready for such a powerful return? And after all, his opponent is very serious after such a trauma. Or did you need something simpler? I think not yet. I think he's not ready for Petro Marharint yet, because Petro is probably, I think, Adam.
Oleg Petrenko: all the things that it's a little bit too fast uh to be to get the outlet of that level because petra uh
Pavlo Dobrydeniuk: won his last match but not really dominant and so he is adding cup and he will add up for the next couple matches that is for sure so after that type of injury uh all the things it's a little bit too fast to get that level of the athlete um
Pavlo Dobrydeniuk: Well, from my experience, it seems to me that little time has passed for such performances. Yeah, they're thinking the same way. He thinks that Petro will win and he thinks it's not enough time after this type of injury to be on that level. OK, we have three female matches on the card on East versus West, but the biggest one is probably for the number one
Raymond: number one overall women right arm title on the planet we have barbara by choa versus egla white kuta two probably the greatest super heavyweight pullers in armwrestling female history uh would you guys think this egla has a chance against barbara right now because back in the day egla was one who was dominating the super heavyweights for years
Raymond: And now we saw last time she pulled Sarah. She was in a great shape. What do you guys think?
Pavlo Dobrydeniuk: We will have three women's fights, and the most important of them, of course, is Egle vs. Barbora. And she says, what do you guys think, does she have a chance to win against Barbora? Because Egle has been a dominant in the super heavy women's category for years and recently won against Sarah. And everyone saw that she was in good shape. What is your opinion on this fight?
Pavlo Dobrydeniuk: Okay, they think different. Oleg thinks that Barbora is going to win and David thinks that Egle is going to win.
Raymond: Ok. One very exciting match. Not a lot of lightweight matches, but we have Bozhidar Simeonov vs. Daniel Prokopchuk on the left arm. Last time they met in World Combat Games, Bozhidar won. So, do you guys have thoughts on that match? Do you have any thoughts on Bozhidar and... Prokopchuk. Prokopchuk and Daniel. What's the weight? The left arm.
Raymond: Last time they met, Bozhidar won. It was at the end of last year. It will be up to 77 kg. Prokopchuk will win. Prokopchuk. They both beat Prokopchuk. To be honest, I also think that Prokopchuk will win. Will he?
Raymond: I'm just saying that even I think that Prokofchuk has better chances of winning. I don't think it's going to be easy.
Raymond: He was like in a super shape. So guys, we're close to finishing this up. I have like the main event. We have to talk about the main event and then maybe last messages to each other. Artem Morozov, Vitalii Laletin, David. With all due respect to Laletin and good communication, Morozov will win. I want Morozov to win. He's my friend, I'm friends with him. And I know and I'm sure, I believe, I want Morozov to win.
Raymond: How will he win in your opinion? Through faith? Yes, through faith. He said that all respect to Vitalii. He hopes that Morozov will win and he believes Morozov is in good shape and he will win. And I asked him like how do you think he's going to win and he will get him in a hook. Oleg? Morozov. I think it's Morozov.
Oleg Petrenko: Well, it's going to be a tough match, but I give Morozov a small advantage. Because he's gaining momentum. He has nowhere to progress, but he's progressing with every match. He's switching to some 10 passes.
Pavlo Dobrydeniuk: Pavel thinks that Morozov is going to win. He's giving slight edge to Morozov. And he said he's still progressing. There is no room for progress. And he's already probably in the number 10 gear, but he's still progressing somehow. So, yeah, he thinks that Morozov is going to win. What do you think, Pavel? I think Morozov is going to win because of the design. Ray, what do you think? Ray, what do you think?
Raymond: Only you ask us questions. I think that in the first round it will be very difficult to twist Vitalii, but then everything will be open, I think so. And then we saw that Morozov can even press, he can do everything.
Raymond: But at first, if you don't expect that someone will just go like Vitalii, no one does it like Vitalii. There are top players who are long, good stretch, but he will also go sideways. I don't know. In the first round, I see that Vitalii should. But I think Artem is super.
Pavlo Dobrydeniuk: You can see that Vitalii's opponents weren't that tall. And Morozov is tall too. He's 196 cm tall. Yes, yes, yes. I showed Blonsky that you can fight him.
Pavlo Dobrydeniuk: Well, yes, but you know, Yablonsky, yes, Yablonsky, well, Yablonsky, well, he's completely different. Morozov will be the savior. He will be the savior of this Kamil. Morozov is right here, right here. Well, go punch. Go punch. Yes, yes, yes. And the arm is long, you know, that is, he too, he will no longer be like that, you know, Vitalii, in order to keep all normal people like us, yes, not like you, Ray, but like us.
Raymond: the main event interesting okay i'll translate all this that i said so i said that uh in my opinion i think vitale will be very dangerous in the first two rounds like most likely uh because he has a like his leverages is
Raymond: in crazy and like he he posts really hard and he hits side which is very dangerous if you don't expect it like and if you you want to add rotation you kind of help him to go there but like pablo said like uh morozo
Raymond: is tall and big like most opponents are much smaller than vitality and it's very hard for them to get the cup that their fingers cannot reach anything so this will equalize it and uh there's a good chance i i believe it's going to be an absolute war i think it's going to be back and forth like
Raymond: Artyom will never give up. He's always in the fight. We even saw that he had big problems with his stomach when he fought Tsvetkov. But he didn't give up. He held on for a long time, as long as he could. And he was small, he didn't have any... I don't know. I think it will be a very beautiful fight. Okay. The last...
David Dadikyan: Last message to each other. Last message to each other. Well, I'm glad that I'm speaking. Thank God. My colleague is highly respected as an athlete, as a person. I'm glad to fight with him, to share the table. So I wish that he and I, God forbid, have no injuries. And so, by the will of God, let him win strong, who is worthy of being a champion.
Pavlo Dobrydeniuk: David says that thanks God I'm pulling and I'm very grateful for this and nothing but respect to Oleg as an athlete. And he said I wish that there is no injuries on the table and the strongest to be a winner. Good luck. I think we will have a great fight.
Oleg Petrenko: And if we will fight for a long time, I think it will be sincere from our fight. I want to see David without injuries, my son too. And I read on patience. I have to take the train.
Pavlo Dobrydeniuk: David knows that I will fight till the end.
Pavlo Dobrydeniuk: That's why it won't be easy. David, do you understand that you need to translate something a little bit, don't you? So that I can clearly understand, please. He said that we will have an awesome fight. He said that sparks will fly when we will fight. He said the same thing without injury. And to you, David, and to me, of course. He said, of course, I hope that I will take the belt. He said, well, that's it, and good luck. Great, let's see.
Raymond: Everyone wants what they want. It's all up to God. Of course, it won't be easy for anyone. We'll see who can do what. Super. You both are great athletes. I can't wait for this match. I'll see you both next week. Thank you, Pavlo, for doing this. You're the best. Tomorrow, Betkely Oniani and...
Raymond: Who do we have? I'm getting lost here. And Artem Taino and Roman will help us there with the translation. So tomorrow about the same time, tune in. We're going to make the post and everything. Thank you. See you in a week in Turkey. Thank you guys for watching. Everyone stay strong, love armwrestling and we'll see you guys soon. Thank you.
David Dadikyan: Thank you, guys. Bye. Good luck. Shaw us your brushes. Bye, everyone.
