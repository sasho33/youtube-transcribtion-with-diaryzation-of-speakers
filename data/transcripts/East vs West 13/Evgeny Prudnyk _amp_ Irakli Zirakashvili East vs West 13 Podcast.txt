SPEAKER_02: Guys, all those matches will happen, sooner or later. Hello. Who came? Uh-huh, Irakli is here. Hello, Irakli. How are you? Irakli, did you like Tornike's video? Yes, yes. Funny, yeah. You saw that, Tornike? Yes, yeah. Yeah, that's very interesting.
SPEAKER_02: I didn't expect such a video from him. Yeah. I mean, he has the potential, but I didn't expect it. It was very surprising. And let's see. I think in a few minutes he will come and we can have a nice chat. Irakli, today you are still with Levan? Today? Yes. Table training today? Okay.
SPEAKER_02: All together. Yeah, they all together had a sparring session today. Yeah. If Prudnik sometimes can't express himself as much as he wants, you would help him, right?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, of course. No problem. I could invite Paolo, but I don't want to keep him busy all the time. Also, five guys doesn't make a square, so it doesn't look so good. We get smaller on the screen. Anyways, so where are you, Bruno? You are one minute late.
SPEAKER_02: So exactly, Krutnik is one minute late, he will start like this as a punishment. Punishment, yeah. If he gets two minutes late, he will also start his tornado, his turn that way, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Let me check where he is. But he's a superstar. It's normal that he comes late, right? The superstars are always late. Hello, Prudnik. Where are you? I should say Evgeny, right? Not last name.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, anyways. So, Evgeny, you said that your weight is around 100 kilos now. And it looks like you didn't gain so much weight. And it looks like you don't plan to. Can you share with us? No, no.
SPEAKER_02: It was 10 kilos, and now it's going to be at least 3 kilos, which means that it's going to be a lot of work for me, because it's going to be a lot of work for me, because it's going to be a lot of work for me,
SPEAKER_02: At the moment I'm 100 kg and during the match day probably I might lose 3 kg. So I plan to be around 97.
SPEAKER_02: He wants to be 97, yeah, okay. The thing is that he feels better at that weight during and after the match too. And he feels that it doesn't bring any difference in terms of strength or power. He has all of it. But at this weight, he feels even better himself. So he plans to be 97. Okay, let me see. Evgeny said that he doesn't let him go in.
SPEAKER_02: and let me send him by email sorry guys uh yeah i think he came yeah he came yeah that's good hello hello hello hello mr mr mafia how are you fine and you uh good good good you know before you come here i talk with you directly
SPEAKER_02: stop smoking iraqi said that iraqi said that cancel the match engine i i don't want to arm wrestle with a mafia i don't feel safe he said yeah you must do it he he he should be scared right he should be scared yeah yeah don't worry
SPEAKER_02: You will not feel pain. It will be without pain, okay. Can you translate what I said and what he said? Because I didn't say the truth, you know.
SPEAKER_02: I will not hurt you, Evgeny, don't worry. Whenever you want translation, Tornike can help you. Yes, Evgeny, I can help you in Russian. It's great when polyglots are in Syria.
SPEAKER_02: Mafia doesn't need a translator. If the word is finished, something else starts working. You should feel it with your heart. Yeah, if the mafia speaks, you should feel it with your heart, right? Yeah, you're right. We are family. Yeah, okay. Anyway, so, Evgeny, how is your form?
SPEAKER_02: Is that good? Yeah, yeah. He wants to take care. It's okay. You see, it's okay. I didn't know that you were smoking. It's bad. I didn't, I don't smoke. Today for video and now for, if you're... I like... Don't get used to. Maybe I...
SPEAKER_02: I will take away with my cigar after fight in lobby outside. Or at the press conference when it is your turn. It's possible at press conference. No, it's okay. They would just kick us out of hotel. No problem. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, they would just tell, you know, get out of here. But it's okay. We can get out. No problem. Anyway, so how is your form? Like, you didn't look super good when you train with Serhii Kalinichenko. But how are you right now? Fine. Normal form. I'm great here.
SPEAKER_02: Irakli will feel my new wrist. Your new wrist? Yeah. I would feel it anyways. His wrist is going to bend back.
SPEAKER_01: He said that your wrist is going to go back. He's not going to feel you anyways. Yeah. That's what he says. No, no, no. Film and the fight, it's different thing. And in the fight, you will feel the wall and power. The wall. The wall and power you'll feel. Did you hear that directly?
SPEAKER_02: That's even better. I like the challenge. I like a good match and Engi knows that I don't want even a rematch if I won easily.
SPEAKER_02: I'm only looking forward to it. Okay. Evgeny, today Irakli told me, he said, Engin, today I had the training with Levan. If Prudnik would see this training, he would make that video. Are you scared? No, no.
SPEAKER_02: Because I know Levan, on the training, he's tired every time and he's like a junior, like a little warrior. What does he do? Yeah, Levan during the sparring sessions is always tired and he gives the matches to the juniors in the gym.
SPEAKER_02: It was not only Levan, it was Bacho there, Arabuli, Vala, everybody was there and my level is very high now. Did you hear that?
SPEAKER_02: Everyone was there and Irakli was in great form. So now you, now you are scared? No, I am ready. You're ready? Levan didn't, Levan didn't try my form now. Oh, okay. Levan didn't try your form. So you would also do terrible things to him right now. I understand.
SPEAKER_02: So can you tell this to him that Levan didn't try him so he would experience something terrible? Yeah, we will see on the 6th of July. You seem nervous.
SPEAKER_02: My only mission is to bend the Prudnik's wrist back. I'm not nervous at all. No, it's not possible.
SPEAKER_02: again is it possible to turn the phone or yeah i know you are the special one you should be different than we are but it would be good you know um iraqli evgeny told me that you know this is best of five he needs to win three rounds and you need to win three rounds so he said that after he he makes two zero against you on the third round
SPEAKER_02: He will hold you, look at you, and he will say, go back to 95 kilos. What do you think about this? Evgeny, I think that this will be a 5-5 match, and the second we win, I think we will be able to continue like this until the end of the year.
SPEAKER_02: I can promise you, Evgeny will not be able to say any words at all during the match. Maybe some screams and emotions, but he will not be able to speak at all. Did you understand Evgeny? I will not speak.
SPEAKER_02: Yes, Irakli says that you can't say anything during the match. You can't say anything during the match. You can't say anything during the match. You can't say anything during the match. You can't say anything during the match. You can't say anything during the match. You can't say anything during the match. You can't say anything during the match. You can't say anything during the match. You can't say anything during the match. You can't say anything during the match. You can't say anything during the match.
SPEAKER_02: he said that he will beat you so quick and he will forget to talk about it and he said next time yeah i will beat so quick and uh forgot about to say something
SPEAKER_02: The way I will beat you is that on the third round you will pick up the microphone and say yourself that 105 has the new king and it's Irakli. You will say it yourself.
SPEAKER_02: In the third round he will say that he is the new king? Yes, he says that in the third round you will take the microphone and say that he is the new king. In the third round. Okay, when I will win him, when I win him three rounds, I will say you are a new king.
SPEAKER_02: okay uh you're a new king okay if you want okay but after just just after my week okay you're gonna beat him three rounds and he will say okay you are the king yeah yeah just to make him happy uh because you want to make him happy after you beat him three zero you said okay okay you are the king

SPEAKER_02: There is Super Chat. Rektos. Great match. Big love from Macedonia to Brudnik. Yeah. He wants to... He shows a big sport for you. And here... Let's see. Is there anyone in the chat that didn't watch
SPEAKER_01: Did you watch the Rudnik's video? Anyways. Irakli, you should thanks to the Dikyaner and Herbaev for your 95 kilo world title.
SPEAKER_01: They beat you at 105 and you realize that 100 is too hard for you. Looks like you need to lose again. Don't worry. On July 6th, I will remind you why you need to stay
SPEAKER_01: This guy is an incredible actor. I mean, he's not exactly a great actor.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, very good acting skills. If you even had a part of those skills to show on the 6th of July, maybe you could even get lucky with it. Okay, okay. So he says that he is good at acting and he wished that he was as good at arm wrestling. Yes. Did you understand, Evgeny? Tell me.
SPEAKER_02: Irakli says that he has acting skills and would like at least some of them to be on July 6th. Maybe then it will work. The same skills as in acting? Yes, yes, yes. Don't worry, Irakli. About this, don't worry.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, who is this? Who is this? Uh, it's, uh, like, uh, uh, uh, no, no, no, no. Uh, it's, uh, open up.
SPEAKER_02: What do I smell? Is this the best guys? Are you the best guys in the 105? Is that what's going on? Are you guys the champs? He's coming for you. He's coming for you. Even for you, he says 95 kilos, Devon is coming for you.
SPEAKER_03: There's only one Georgian that I'm scared of. Only one Georgian. The rest of you. I don't even like to say his name anymore. I call him the Death Star. Yeah. Yeah. But the rest of you Georgians, big problems. Big problems. So, what is this for? Is this number two? What do you think? Jenny?
SPEAKER_02: How was your weight now? What do you think my weight is? 75
SPEAKER_02: it looks like your legs looks like 75. uh evgeny seriously do you know what his weight is this morning this morning he's like he's like 106 kilo probably six yeah yeah okay then you're very good very good guessing but you're wrong you're right you are right no no it is it's exactly 106 kilos
SPEAKER_02: 233 233 yeah 231 is 105 and then 233 yeah today 233 i feel amazing i feel great i've been training every day i think i may be stronger then you take a third place after me and uh iraq what about daddy cam okay right now right now daddy can is number one touching is number two
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, he just had the title. When we talk on here, let's not go off the piece of paper. Let's say who's the... And leave my name out of it because I'm an old man and I'm not really around. But who's the real number one? Who's number one in 105? Right hand. Is he? What do you think about that, Prudnik? Is he number one?
SPEAKER_02: He? No, I'm number one. That's what I thought maybe. And you're number three. You're number three, Irakli number two. Irakli two? Because you don't know about the fight between Irakli and Saganashvili today. You don't know about the fight. Oh, yes.
SPEAKER_02: if you know if you knew about this you said you will now you say uh i i number three was it easy was it easy if it was easy it's because i tired him out today pull it with uh saginashvili and he do do like this and say oh
SPEAKER_02: He didn't hurt him, did you? Irakli, did you hurt him? Irakli, I don't know about Levon, but I think he hurt him a lot. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
SPEAKER_02: Who's the real number one, Irakli? Who's the number one? Who's number two? Who's number three? You are number three. Me? I'm not even in the class. I'm retired. I'm retired. Irakli, Irakli.
SPEAKER_02: Who is number one in 105? Who is number two? Who is number three for you? Yes, so far what the ratings say, that's how it is. Yeah. In the future. I'm so confused. I'm so confused by all of it. Okay, so that he can
SPEAKER_03: beat you at 115 or 110 was it 105 105 that he can't beat you up and Kurt Agali beat you up at 105 and Petrenko beat up Kurt Agali and I think everyone can make 105 no problem and what about Michael Todd I don't know
SPEAKER_02: Are you sure that Daddycan has won? Are you sure? I mean, Daddycan and Michael are going to pull in 115. And we don't even know. And what about Petrenko? I don't know. Petrenko right now doesn't have the American visa. If Petrenko beats Daddycan, Daddycan versus Michael will not be for title. But if Daddycan beats Petrenko, that match will be for interim title. All this mess, it needs to get cleaned up.
SPEAKER_02: Yes, it is all your fault. This is a big disaster. You just left, and then now we are the good champion in 115. Nobody knows who the champion is because everybody is not really that good, I think. I don't know. In 115, you were champion, and you were going to defend your title, and then you got scared of Dadikyan, and then‚Ä¶ Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Come on, man. Come on.
SPEAKER_03: How is that even possible that that comes out of your mouth, Engin? I don't know. That is all I see. I mean, I was thinking different. Daddy Can was not important enough for me to leave my vacation. Okay? It's not important. And I love arm wrestling. I love arm wrestling. But my vacation is more important than Daddy Can. That's how scared I am of Daddy Can. I have a question. This guy right now, 106 kilos.
SPEAKER_02: He is coming down to 95 kilos as well. It's not a joke. And he said he will crush you. What do you say? Show me at least one Georgian you have beaten. What are you going to do?
SPEAKER_03: Iraq, Lee, go ask your father about me. Okay. Used to beat him up every time he left the left the country. All right. Don't you worry. There'll be many Georgians. I'm going to change it. Remember when everybody was like, Oh, Devin, you can't beat Europeans. And I did a tour. I'm just gonna, it's just Georgians. Now I only will beat Georgians one after the other, after the other. And then there'll be an army at that point that is circling Lavon.
SPEAKER_03: Won't be me this time. But we're coming for you, Georgians. We're coming. We're coming for you. But the thing is, none of it matters because you are going to lose to Prudnik. And then Prudnik is going to lose to Michael Todd. And everybody knows that Michael Todd has no chance with me.
SPEAKER_02: But I'm not arm wrestling. This is just all hype. Michael Todd lost to Angerbaev and I won Angerbaev also. This is Michael Todd 2.0. We are now Michael Todd 3.0.
SPEAKER_02: three version three version three is undefeated against kurti galley hasn't lost yet evgeny if you pull devon in 105 kilo instead of 115 kilo would you beat him of course of course yeah i agree with you yeah
SPEAKER_03: I'll have to sing you another song. Do you remember the great songs that I used to sing to you, Pritnik? For you? Yeah. Do you remember the songs that I used to sing to you? Do you remember the song that I sang to you? I don't think it's you that I would sing songs to this time. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: And you remember my song? Very inspirational, very inspirational. Are you going to sing a song to Irakli or does he even deserve it? Does he even deserve a song? I don't know. I will think about it. He sang one, but it sounds a little bit gay.
SPEAKER_02: Who did? Who sounded gay, Engin? I didn't know who you were talking about when you said gay. Can you translate? I didn't fully understand.
SPEAKER_02: i i said that he said that is he gonna sing for iraqi and i said he sang already but it it was a little bit gay you know the song and he said that and then devon asked who is gay and he said iraqi is the gay and so he's looking for trouble i didn't say iraqi was the gay you said that
SPEAKER_02: Oh, I, oh, I didn't, I didn't hear that part. Okay. You want, you want to, okay. I will tell you directly what's the problem. Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,
SPEAKER_02: Devin, why are you jumping between the weight classes? Are you afraid of losing the 115? No, no, no, no. Listen. Something that you can look at. Go back.
SPEAKER_03: And look at me in the WAL when I used to pull 225. This is what I'm coming back to. My natural shape where I am truly what I'm supposed to be. Okay. And at that weight, I can pull 115. But if I weigh at 230 pounds, why wouldn't I pull 105? And I can probably pull 95 too. So I'm just arm wrestling everybody.
SPEAKER_02: Under a certain weight. Everybody. I'm going to be able to wear tight pants just like you, Irakli. Super tight pants. Yeah, can you translate to Irakli, please?
SPEAKER_02: When you were born in 1995, you said that you had a lot of weight and you didn't have a lot of physical strength. When you were born, you said that you had a lot of weight and you didn't have a lot of physical strength. When you were born, you said that you had a lot of physical strength. When you were born, you said that you had a lot of physical strength.
SPEAKER_02: When I beat you at 95, everybody will say that he won because Devin was too skinny and too weak. I don't want that. I will be 97. You can be 105. After I beat Prudnik, I will beat you too. No problem. I have a question for Ragli. I have a question. And I want to know if the reason why he always weighs so little is because his pants are so tight. Like,
SPEAKER_03: Is this part of his weight loss? Is it like compression? Does that keep blood from going into his legs? And would he consider selling an item on NoLimitsArmWrestling.com? A raclette pants. Compression leg. Yes, you're right. It's not like he's going to continue doing this. If he does, he's going to lose weight.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, guys, just listen here. One second. What do you do? You have clean fingers or no? What? Your fingers are clean? Yes, but I don't... Are my fingers clean? Yeah, clean? Pretty clean.
SPEAKER_02: Did you wash your hands? No. I don't want my hands. What do I need to watch my hands for cosmic punch? I was gonna punch. I was nothing that's gonna hurt me out here. There's nothing that's gonna hurt me. I was gonna let you guys to listen to the song but he deleted it. Why did you delete your song? Just sing here.
SPEAKER_02: Because it needs a good performance. Yeah, it needs a better performance and a better recording. And it should be less gay. Who is gay? I mean the song. Angan, wow. Angan, you are turning over a leaf, man.
SPEAKER_02: no seriously i told him i told him i told him already i i i listened it was a strong you know the take on me from aha i think it was yeah and it was it was just it was just it sounded gay but yeah i mean the the the words was just there's nothing wrong with being gay okay if someone on here is gay that's okay
SPEAKER_03: That's okay. So you got him to take it down. You as his manager said, this is not the image we want for Prudnik to portray. It's a bit too gay. I mean, the song was, it was just like, can you stop? Please stop because Irakli is scared now. He will, he will in full with me after this speech.
SPEAKER_03: Stop, please. He is scared. Look at him. I feel like Irakli at best is fourth place. I think... What's your ranking? Oleg Petrenko, Michael Todd, Evgeny Prudnik. Maybe Irakli fifth place. And he's got the belt. But how is he like fifth place? What is this mess?
SPEAKER_02: What is this mess? Yeah, and Todd Hutchings. Oh, my God. I feel like anybody can beat Irakli. Anybody can beat Irakli. Except for LeBron. Yes. Yes, you prove. You're right. You're right. You're right. Maybe fifth or sixth place.
SPEAKER_02: Irakli is fifth or sixth. Okay, go ahead. Yeah, you're just hoping. I have never fought with Petrenko yet, so you're just guessing now. No, but Petrenko beat Kredigali.
SPEAKER_02: You should be more professional about this. You know it doesn't translate like that. What do you think, Pranik? You're right. You're right. Devon asks, what's your name? Petrenko or Irakli? Petrenko.
SPEAKER_02: Now Petrenko. Yes, he is a machine now. Yes, he is a machine now. Petrenko is a machine. Yes, he is a machine now. Petrenko is a machine.
SPEAKER_02: Then let's agree like that. When I beat Prudnik now, and if Petrenko beats Darikyan, I'm ready to fight him for the 105 belt. He means Petrenko. If you beat now, if you beat... If you beat now, if you beat...
SPEAKER_02: And according to his prediction, Petrenko and I will be in the top 15 in October. No, no, Irakli, Irakli, one win is not enough for the title. One win is not enough. Also in October, you have a title match in 95 kilos. Remember? Very good. Irakli, you won in October 1995.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I will defend 95. No problem. Against who? It's his secret. Is it the Bulgarian guy? I didn't say anything. Not Bulgarian. I bet you it's him. It's not. It's not?
SPEAKER_02: No, it's not. But don't start guessing. Oh, is it the Kazakh guy? Or is it the Georgian guy? Or is it the Russian guy? I'm not going to say it. But it is a Bulgarian guy, isn't it? It is not. Is it Zoloev? Is he coming back? Look at the guy. It is not. Just stop. Stop. I will not answer from now on. But it's not Zoloev. It's not Bulgarian guy. Anyway, so Iraqli, you're going to crash this guy in 105 kilos. Devon, you want to pull against him?
SPEAKER_02: Well, I'm retired. Look, hang on. I'm at a spa right now. I don't even train anymore. I'm just curious. I'm just curious who the best is. Evgeny, Evgeny, this guy supposed to pull you in Florida event with left arm, but he told me that he's scared of you. So that's why he will skip that event. Who are you talking about? Who are you talking about? You. Me? Yeah. Scared of who? Evgeny with left arm in Florida, Orlando, Florida event.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, is that what you want to do? Evgeny, would you beat him? 105 kilo in Florida? Yeah, yeah. First time, first left hand and after right hand. You really think so? When you train with him in France with left arm, who was winning? I will win. You were winning, right? Yeah, okay.
SPEAKER_03: So that is why he doesn't want to pull again. Now listen, ask another question. Ask one more question. Who was winning with the right arm? I mean, right arm, you beat him in an event. In an event, but who was winning in France? I mean, you. No, I never did anything. I never pinned him one time. Not one time I pinned him. Yeah. Anyways.
SPEAKER_03: anyways this isn't about me i'm so excited to watch you guys i'm going to be there i'm going to bring so much money and i'm going to try and bet all of it and i have to know which one wins that's all i'm curious i'm curious exactly tell us how many guys under 105 kilo can beat devon if the category is 105 anyone can beat devon if yes how many people and who are they
SPEAKER_02: Do you have a favorite song by Daewon? I have a favorite song by Daewon... All of them are me. All of them are me. All of them are me. All of them are me. All of them are me. All of them are me. All of them are me.
SPEAKER_02: I think I just can't beat him in 105. Just me. Just I. Only you? Just me, yeah. Yeah. Daddy Ken also thinks he can beat. If I ask to Petrenko also, you are in trouble. I think Devon is going down to 75 kilos to pull Mindaugas. Maybe I'll pull David first. Maybe I'll go 85. Yeah. Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Guys, I gotta go. I gotta go. I'm with Jody. I'm at the spa. I love you guys. I can't wait. I cannot wait till July 6th. It's hilarious. I love the promotion today. It made me so...

You're not going to see me. I'm not going to be back. Don't even worry about it. Don't even think about it. I'm not that shadow. I'm not that shadow that's in the distance. That's not me. It's somebody else. Don't worry. 105 is safe. If he talks like this, you better be careful, guys. Anyway, so...
SPEAKER_02: Bye, Loran. Okay, Irakli. Should we announce your match in October? People are curious about it. Let me announce. October 26. It may move one week.
SPEAKER_02: late but october 6 95 kilo world title match iraq is rakashvili versus georgie tautier impressive
SPEAKER_02: I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so.
SPEAKER_02: I think that for Tautiev, he doesn't deserve the title match. The AMC winners, they think too high of themselves, but they have to know that East versus West is a much higher competition.
SPEAKER_02: Irakli, come close. Come close. Hello, Georgi. You see them? You see them? Yes, yes. Yeah. Tornike, can you translate it? Irakli says that Georgi Tautiev doesn't deserve the title match. Yeah, he said that Georgi doesn't deserve the title match. No, no, no, no, no. Russian, Russian.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, Irakli says that Georgi didn't deserve a title match and that East vs. West is a much higher category than AMC. And not only me, but others will be able to beat Georgi. Is Irakli saying that? He said so, yes. Well, the thing is, first of all, how many years have we been to the European and World Championships with Irakli?
SPEAKER_00: And at the European and World Championships, he was always second. And I'm the first. I mean, not in any weight category at all. And he knows me. Naturally, he is worried about this fight. Because it's better than me to fight at the top. It's better than me to fight at the top. In the world, probably, I don't know, a few people,
SPEAKER_02: Moreover, he fights with armwrestlers, but with armwrestlers it doesn't work out very well. And he is afraid, of course, he is worried. That's it. Translate, please. Irakli knows me very well from the European and World Championships. He always has been second and I always was first. It's true, it was a different weight class.
SPEAKER_02: But he knows very well that I'm one of the best top rollers. And his style is good with the hook. But against my best top roll, he doesn't have a chance. And he is scared. And I understand that. Okay. Yorgi, sorry for calling you. I just wanted to say hello. Take care. Bye-bye.
SPEAKER_02: Irakli is very good at playing in the European and national championships. He was in the second and I was in the first. He was in the same class, but he is good at saying that he has a very good technique and works very well. And my technique is the same. I agree with you. I think that if the players understand that they can play reality, then they will be able to play reality.
SPEAKER_02: Irakli is saying Gyorgy should probably clean up his glasses because he can't see the reality clear. Oh, these guys are incredible. Yeah, okay. They will be fired because you guys don't know that whenever I was setting this match, they were talking a lot, you know, like...
SPEAKER_02: so at the beginning iraq said that he doesn't deserve the match and because west is a different level yes
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, he says that it makes no sense for him to give up the fight. So he was scared. He just knows me. This was before I matched. And I said, Iraq says that you will be punished for these wars in October. And he says, thousands of kilometers away, I can feel how afraid he is.
SPEAKER_02: and iraqis said he's a good boy he has a big ambitions but he's too small for the belt yet and anyway so these guys will also have some crazy crazy crazy um how to say uh trash talk i believe anyways evgeny
SPEAKER_02: What are you going to do to this guy, Irakli, on July 6th? Seriously, are you healed up? Are you okay now? Yeah, yeah. Yeah? How good are you? I feel good. And I want to say that I tried to pull with Irakli after pull. And I know him weak point. I know what to do with him.
SPEAKER_02: And he lost me an after pool. That was two years ago. Now this is a different Irakli. Yeah, he will think he just think such.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, we will see. And Irakli, you're going to beat him 3-0? Something else, maybe. Of course. And then third round, are you going to talk with him, say a few things? Yep.
SPEAKER_02: I will hold him in the third round like I did with Sasho on the fourth round. I will beat him easily and after that he will have to say that I'm the new king of 105.
SPEAKER_02: You need to hold him before you finish. And you need to say, tell me I'm the new king. Tell me I'm the new king. Okay? No, no. In third round, now I say how will be. In third round, I will hold him easy and will sing song for him.
SPEAKER_02: during the match. He will be what? Saw? And I will sing song for him during the match. Oh, you will sing song? In third round. In third round, I will sing song for him. Which song? I will hold him and will sing. Okay. Can you little bit sing now? What you will say? I don't know.
SPEAKER_02: I have a time one month for I think what song exactly I will choose. Can you sing us a little bit the other one, Take On Me? No, I don't remember the word. You don't remember. Okay. Okay. Anyway, so there are some superchats very quick. Let me have a big road goals. Evgeny, are you stronger than when you pull against Todd Hutchings? But just say the truth.
SPEAKER_02: yeah yeah are you stronger than the time you pull against yeah yeah you swear swear like you you you say the truth ah yes i'm strong now i'm stronger than uh uh fight with hutchins ooh iraqli
SPEAKER_02: And I'm in the peak of my shape. I'm being honest. I have not been this strong ever and I'm in my best shape at the moment.
SPEAKER_02: I'm very, very sorry that he will have to lose in his best form. Prudnik is saying that he's very sorry that Irakli has to lose in his best shape. Oh, that's interesting.
SPEAKER_02: Kevin Tomkey, question for Engin. What tournament did Sergei Kalina break his arm and to whom? It was left arm, my friend. It was Loketurk, probably either 2017 or 2018. I'm not sure who. Evgeny, who was Sergei Kalinishenko armless when he broke his arm? Was it Alam Makayev? Alam Makayev, yeah. Alam Makayev, right? Yeah, okay. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: To who does he still at arm muscle and will be, he will be at arm wrestling with right arm against Travis Badgen, my friend. Sean Crowther. Everyone hit the like button. Thank you very much, my friend, for the super chat. And I think I missed one more. And David Toms. Thank you, Engin. Hello, guys. Thank you for super chat, my friend. Maybe one more.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, Samk789. Devon has a tattoo on his left hand that says what Irakli will do. Show him Devon. Sorry for the late reading. It was very hard to cut. Did I miss anything? Yeah, he has quit tattooed on the left arm. Okay, okay.
SPEAKER_02: anyway so let's let's quickly go to the like this this was very very uh high level um podcast especially after devon joined and let's go for the matches okay carolina peterson olga terpelova uh olga terpelova
SPEAKER_02: Olga will beat Karolina? Yes. Yeah. Evgeny? I don't know. You don't know. Okay. Let's go the next one. Artem Taranenko, Toms Rozic. Yeah, I don't know their shapes. Hard to say.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, I know Tom's shape for sure. He beat one match Oleg Dzok with left arm and right arm he won the European Championships. Taranipo just won it. He's Latvian, right? I think I remember him. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I think he will win. Evgeny? Me too. You too? You think that, what, Toms will win? Yeah, yeah. Okay. And let's go another one. Chansho versus Ibrahim Sagov. Oh.
SPEAKER_02: It depends on the style of the player, but I think Ibrahim Sagov will win. I think Chen Shou will win.
SPEAKER_02: Zurab Tawberidze, Petro Marharit, another Georgia versus Ukraine.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know what the form of Zura is, but I don't know what it looks like. I don't know what it looks like. I don't know what it looks like. I don't know what it looks like. I don't know what it looks like. I don't know what it looks like. I don't know what it looks like.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know Zurab's current shape. If it was before injury, I would definitely say that Zurab would win. Now it's hard to say, probably 50-50. Of course, I'm rooting for my fellow Georgian. Did you not talk with him this week, last weekend at East vs West? Did you talk with him? Did you not ask him? How is his shape? I don't think he's in good shape.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, he said that he's feeling good and the gym lifts are feeling strong. But of course, this is a competition. This will be the first one after the injury. So we'll see. And Evgeny?
SPEAKER_02: What is hand will fight right? Right arm. Right arm. Right arm. Margarine will win exactly. Because he has a good shape now. How do you know he's in good shape? From the last match? Or you talked with him? Yeah, yeah. About last match. Oh, from the last match. Okay. And Dimitri Petrov, Ayane.
SPEAKER_02: Ayane Takenaka from Japan. One is 55 kilo world champion. The other one is 60 kilo world champion. Do you guys know these ladies? Dimitry Demogorgon. Yeah, he thinks that Dimitry will win. And you? Dimitry from Bulgaria. She was competing 55 kilo in the past. Now 60 kilo.
SPEAKER_02: She is the current European and world champion. And Ayane is a girl that's doing one-arm pull-up from Japan. I've never seen a woman doing one-arm pull-up before, but that's interesting. Yeah. And let's go to the next one. This is also very interesting. Adam Borzinski versus Vladimir Mairov. Vladimir Mairov. Vladimir Mairov.
SPEAKER_02: Evgeny? I'm also Vladimir Majorov. Okay. And let's go to Artem Tainov, Betkili Oniani. I'm very happy to be in Betkili. I'm very happy to be in Betkili. I'm very happy to be in Betkili.
SPEAKER_02: This is going to be a very tough match. I think if Betkili manages to even stop for a little bit Tainov's hand, then he will win. I think that Betkili will manage to win this one. And what do you think, Evgeny? Giuliani. Giuliani. Giuliani. Giuliani? Giuliani?
SPEAKER_02: okay uh i think the the thing that he was smoking has had some effects on him i think he calls only any giuliani okay okay and let's go to the next one
SPEAKER_02: barbara baggiova versus egg white quitter yeah she's she's very strong she can't compete with anyone and evany egg or barbara yeah okay now it's getting a little bit more heated
SPEAKER_02: Sergei Kalinichenko or Travis Bergens? Sergei Kalinichenko. Kalinichenko. I also think that Kalinichenko will win on the right one. Okay, they both say that Kalinichenko is going to win. Yeah. Okay, let's go. David Samusha or Sasho Andriy?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, this is a very interesting one. Can you ask him, is it the toughest match of Samushya from outside looking?
SPEAKER_02: Guerdigan Musakhidina, Samushiyashvili will win every single match, right? Yes, whatever happens, he will win every single match. Yeah, this one will be the toughest one. Yeah, I think Khabrazebul's match was also very tough, yeah. Go ahead, sorry. What do you think, Irakli? I think Khabrazebul will win this match, and it will be interesting to see what happens. It's not like he's going to do something that's going to hurt everyone. Who knows?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, also Sasho will be angry after his last match. But I still think that Samusha will find the key. Okay, Samusha will find. And Evgeny? Samusha will win. Samusha will win? Really? Yeah, yeah. Why not? No, no, because you pulled with many times with Sasho. Usually Sasho beat you, so I thought that maybe you had some psychological, you know... Nothing.
SPEAKER_02: Nothing. Okay. Okay. Okay, so this one is also very big one. I only asked for score. And just tell me how every round will be our number, round number one, round number two, round number three will be Irakli versus Prudnik.
SPEAKER_02: How do you feel about the second round? I don't know how to put it in words, but I don't know what to say
SPEAKER_01: I have a very big problem, I have a very big problem, I have a very big problem, I have a very big problem, I have a very big problem,
SPEAKER_02: I think it's a good thing that the world is changing with Magida. I think it's a legend. There are legends, there are legends, there are legends, there are legends, there are legends, there are legends, there are legends, there are legends, there are legends, there are legends, there are legends, there are legends,
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I don't like to talk about my own matches, and I have to say that I respect Prodnik a lot. He's a legend. I've watched him arm wrestle since I was a kid, and I think he's one of the smartest arm wrestlers. Maybe after John, he's one of the smartest at the table. But legends are legends. Their time goes away, and the new generation comes.
SPEAKER_01: So I think I will beat him. And Evgeny? Okay, if he said that I'm a legend, thank you. Okay, I will beat him one time. Maybe first, maybe second round. But the rest of the round I will win.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, okay. He says that because he said he is a legend. Because he said that I legend here. Yeah. Okay. So he's going to give him as a present gift one round. Yeah. Okay. No need for presents. No need for presents. Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, don't refuse, please. OK. So he says that Iraq is going to take his own three, right? OK, I understand. OK. I may have a surprise now. Evgeny, Oleg Petrenko versus David Dadikian.
SPEAKER_02: very interesting fight uh 50 50 but i think now now petrenko has more chance for win and he must to prove that he's more strong okay okay
SPEAKER_02: If Petrenko manages to recover enough from his recent match, I think he's a slight favorite. 55 for Petrenko, 45 for Dadikian. The question, were they surprised?
SPEAKER_02: When Petrenko won like that. Yeah, everybody was surprised. Me, I'm sure Engin, and I'm sure Prutnik also was surprised. For me, it was a surprise that he
SPEAKER_02: did it such easy yeah i was thinking both had chance to win but i didn't expect such domination that that was very very interesting yeah um okay and let's go morozov versus vitality right right arm right right arm yes
SPEAKER_02: Just don't tell me who's going to win, but just tell me how the match will go. It's March. Yes, it's March. Yes, it is. Yes, it is. Yes, it is. Yes, it is. Yes, it is. Yes, it is. Yes, it is. Yes, it is. Yes, it is. Yes, it is. Yes, it is. Yes, it is. Yes, it is. Yes, it is. Yes, it is. Yes, it is. Yes, it is. Yes, it is. Yes, it is. Yes, it is. Yes, it is. Yes, it is. Yes, it is. Yes, it is.
SPEAKER_02: If this was on the left hand, I think Vitaly would win. But on the right, it's really hard to say.
SPEAKER_02: I think it's close to 50-50. If it goes into an endurance war, I think that Morozov will have an edge and should be able to win. If you were Morozov's trainer, would you tell him to try top roll, hook or flop? Top rolls. Yeah, top roll.
SPEAKER_02: And what do you think about this match, Evgeny? I think Morozov should win, must win. Because I won Morozov and after I will win Morozov also. And for me it will be better. Okay, for you it will be better. Okay, I understand. Yeah. And Evgeny, a question for you.
SPEAKER_02: Like, look who came, Irakli. Gyorgy, Prudnik and Irakli put in 105 kilo category. Who do you think is going to win? I think... Do you speak English?
SPEAKER_02: A little bit. Oh, I didn't know that. I thought you were going to speak Russian. I was expecting Tornike to translate. How will it be more convenient? No, no, it will be much more convenient for me with the translator. Yes, go ahead. I think I should win against Heraklis, in theory. Yes, I always root for the top players, so I think Heraklis will win. Yeah, I still think that Heraklis will win.
SPEAKER_02: I always support top rollers and I think he will manage. Thank you. After so much trash talk on WhatsApp through me, now it's a warm hand. Evgeny, what do you think?
SPEAKER_02: What did you say at the end? Maybe in the future with Prudnik at 105 kg?
SPEAKER_02: Yes, I will fight anyone. I really like to fight in warm-wrestling, especially with strong opponents. Right now, probably most people think that Irakli is a favorite.
SPEAKER_02: in my fight with him. But, of course, I don't think so. I consider him a strong athlete, a good, strong athlete, but, of course, not stronger than me and not better than me. So... But it will be, at least, a very interesting fight. I think Prudnik is a very strong athlete, but I'm saying that there is no...
SPEAKER_02: I love to fight. I love a challenge, so I'm ready for anyone. I know that many think that against me, Irakli is the favorite, but I don't think so. I am stronger, and I will prove it.
SPEAKER_02: Against Prudnik, of course, Prudnik is very strong, but I still think that his wrist, he will lose the wrist against Irakli's top role. Maybe if he manages to press, that might be an outcome, but it will be tough for him. Okay, I understand. So, he said that
SPEAKER_02: You said that fans think that Irakli is a favorite, but you will win, right? Yes, I think so.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, many think that Irakli is the favorite, but I will beat him. I am strong. Well, of course, many people write to me that I am stronger, but these are my subscribers, who follow me, who support me. And many people write to me that they want to see this armfight, so that I can fight Irakli. Many people ask in the questions who is stronger, Irakli or me.
SPEAKER_02: That's why I say that... Well, of course, they think that Irakli is stronger because he's in the lead, he fights in the East-West, he beat a lot of strong athletes. I'm not saying that I didn't beat a lot of strong athletes, but the East-West and the King of the Table are considered more prestigious, and everyone, of course, looks more closely at the East-West and the King of the Table, and that's why people think that
SPEAKER_02: uh yeah actually my fans and supporters uh they all think that uh i am stronger and uh i think that this will be a very interesting and a good match for the fans to see whose top role is stronger because this will be a very much
SPEAKER_02: two top roles against each other. I think that Irakli is considered favorite because East versus West and King of the Table are more prestigious events and Irakli is more popular and I understand that. But this is just being popular. Can you translate that to Irakli? Let's see what he says.
SPEAKER_02: Many people think that Gherakli is a favorite, but it is true that he is a very popular and prestigious player. He is also very popular in the field of football. From my point of view and many others, he is a very interesting player. He has two top roles. Okay, and what do you say about the fact that at AMC
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, let's not go there, like... Yeah, no need, yeah, just because we don't want to...
SPEAKER_02: I want to ask what he said. I have a question for you, Georgi. You are two metres tall.
SPEAKER_02: Yes, yes, yes. Two meters. So I think that whenever you gain weight, it is you are improving a lot, right? Like Lalit, when he was 100 kilos, he was very good. But when he gained weight, because he is 205, he was very strong. So what is your normal weight? 100 kilos or 100? What was your everyday weight? Now I weigh... My normal weight is about 95.
SPEAKER_02: 7, I guess. The average weight is 97-98 kg. My usual weight is 97-98 kg. So when he competed in the AMC, he took second place in the Rhyme Saga. What was his weight? In the AMC, when he took second place in the Rhyme Saga, how much did you weigh then? About 103-104 kg.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, 103 and something. Okay, so anyway, so it will be great. And I want to also do a podcast with him. And Georgi, when I speak with you, do you understand everything I say? Not everything, but the majority of things.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, okay, okay. Okay, I understand. And a question to Evgeny. Evgeny, you talk a lot of trash before Ali Can match. And the trash talk didn't end very good. And now you started with Irakli. How confident are you that you will not experience something like you experienced with Ali Can match?
SPEAKER_02: Did you understand? Did you understand? Let me clarify a little bit. He says that you had an experience with Olezhan in the Trash Talk, right? Yes, yes. And how are you going to do your Trash Talk now, considering your past experience with the loss and the Trash Talk with Olezhan? Now, how am I going to do it with Irakli, right?
SPEAKER_02: Yes, yes. How sure are you that it won't be the same now? Damn, I don't even know how to say it. I won't pay attention to the outcome of the fight, because it has nothing to do with Trash Talk.
SPEAKER_02: Trash talk is separate, and the fight is separate. In any case, it's not interesting to be silent and not say anything. Something interesting to show, something interesting to make fun of, I'm always for it. After our fight with Alizhan,
SPEAKER_02: But before and after the fight, we were still friends. Olezhan didn't get mad at me. Everything was fine with his coach and he didn't get mad at me. He understands humor, but it depends on the person if he understands humor or not. But in any case, if you keep silent or say something, the outcome of the fight will not change.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, for me, the fight and the result of the fight is very separate from trash talk. I consider this to be two different things. And with Alijan, before and after the match, we are friends, both with him and his trainer. I think trash talk is to keep the fire going, to keep the interest of the match.
SPEAKER_02: But the fight itself is separate for me. So that's something that I need to keep the interest going. And I will do that anyway. And one more question for Evgeny. Evgeny, are you planning to pull only 105 or also 115? My plan now is to take 105 pull. World title?
SPEAKER_02: And after, when I do this, I will think about the next weight. Next category. And another question for Georgy. Are you open to pull 95 and 105 or you want to pull only 95? Where do I want to start, he asks. Are you going to pull only 95 or 95 and 105?
SPEAKER_02: Yes, I will fight as they say. I can fight there and there. Of course, I would like to fight there and there more, because there are many athletes with whom I would like to fight. But depending on what it will depend on, I probably won't be able to change the weight so sharply.
SPEAKER_02: I'm ready to fight in both of the weight classes, and I can do both. Actually, there are many athletes in 105 class with whom I would gladly fall. So I'm good with both.
SPEAKER_02: I would like to start with 95 and then maybe later move to 105. But I don't want to jump too much, but I can do both. And Irakli, you think that you're going to win also 105 category title soon or late? Irakli, do you have such goal? Yes, I have such goal.
SPEAKER_02: Yes, I achieved my number one goal which was 95 and 105 is my next big goal and I'm starting fully to commit to it. And Gyorgy, now Devon Larratt is going down to 115, 105 and even 95 kilos. Do you think that he can win these categories?
SPEAKER_02: I don't think so. I don't understand how he wins.
SPEAKER_02: Irakli, yes, let's say, I think Irakli should, if he goes down to 95 and compare Irakli and Devon Alorata to 95, then I think Irakli is stronger. But I'm still sitting, I noticed, when he asked me, but this is if Irakli will fight him there, let's say. 105...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I really doubt it. If we consider at 95, him, for example, against Iroquois, I think Iroquois is stronger.
SPEAKER_02: Against 105, I also think that it will be very tough for him to win. Against me, I think I can beat him at my weight class. But it's hard to say. When he had a fight against Gasparini, I also thought that Hermes would easily beat him, but that didn't happen. So it's tough to say with him.
SPEAKER_02: Can you ask him if he is a surgeon? He is a surgeon, a vascular blood vessel surgeon. Wow.
SPEAKER_02: And armwrestling doesn't affect him? No? Okay, that's good. That's good, that's good. Okay, very quickly, I will ask. Gyorgy, who is winning? Laletin or Morozov? Laletin. Who is winning, Dadikyan or Petrenko? Dadikyan, I think. Did you see the match, Petrenko and Ongar were?
SPEAKER_02: Yes, I watched it. I was surprised, of course, but I think there was something wrong with Angorbaev. I don't know. He lost very easily. Of course, it was a long time ago. I also fought with Petrenko, but it was a long time ago. I won him with my left hand.
SPEAKER_02: It is clear that he is much stronger now, but he is faster than Dadikyan, more technical than Dadikyan. Only Petrenko can be a little stronger. Gorbayev is also much faster and more technical.
SPEAKER_02: It's different. If you fight Petrenko, you have a lot of chances to win. And you beat Dadikyan with your left hand in a very difficult fight. I think there are the same chances. Is Dadikyan stronger on the left?
SPEAKER_02: I don't know. I don't know which of you is left and which of you is right. I'll come and be right-handed. Can you translate? It was a very interesting match because I didn't expect Ungerbaev to lose this easily for this match to be so one-sided. Maybe there was something wrong or injury with Ungerbaev.
SPEAKER_02: I have fought with Petrenko in the past, but this was a long time ago on the left and I won. But yeah, I understand that Petrenko is much stronger now. But let's see who's faster. Probably Daddy can. Who's more technical? Probably Daddy can. Who's stronger? Maybe Petrenko is a bit stronger.
SPEAKER_02: But it's hard to say. And then with the Prudnik, Prudnik said that that he can is stronger on the left rather than on the right. And to which Georgi said that, yeah, it's very hard to say. Yeah, but he will be touching. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, so my position, one seat out here, you like. OK, thank you for your support.
SPEAKER_02: And the last one, Sasho vs Samusha. Who's winning, Georgy? We're finishing. Sasho will fight Samusha? Yes, yes, yes. 85 kilos. Oh, damn. Samusha, damn, I don't even know. Damn, it's hard to say. It's very hard to predict for me.
SPEAKER_02: Probably Sasha. I don't know. I just said it on a whim. Most likely Sasha. Because Sasha probably has more experience, 85. Samusha, 85. For a long time? In short, I don't know.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it's very tough to say. I'm just guessing. Maybe Sashro says he's more experienced in 85, but I'm just guessing. This one is really hard to tell. Yep, yep. When I start talking, Irakli starts to worry. When I start to speak, Irakli gets nervous.
SPEAKER_02: Is he saying the truth or he's dreaming? He's just sleeping. Is he sleeping? Yes, he's sleeping. Marta is sleeping. Marta is sleeping. Marta is sleeping. Marta is sleeping. Marta is sleeping. Marta is sleeping. Marta is sleeping. Marta is sleeping.
SPEAKER_02: Come on, I just had a hard training and I'm just sleepy. Yeah, go ahead. I will beat him like a 9th grader school kid. Translate it. Translate him. He said that he trained today and fell asleep. He's just tired. I'll beat him like a 9th grader. Okay. Good.
SPEAKER_02: I have the belt, and you should be nervous. I have the belt, so you should be nervous. I think Irakli will win.
SPEAKER_02: Who do you think will win? If I go to 105 in our match, who will win? I don't think
SPEAKER_02: I don't think I will have to fight you. I don't think I will have to fight you.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I don't think that we will have to fight each other. I think that you will lose to Irakli and I will beat Irakli, so I'll be above you. Okay, okay. So what I understand from this, Irakli beats both of the guys because Prudnik thinks that Irakli will beat Georgi and Georgi thinks that Irakli will beat Prudnik. So it looks like Irakli will win. Both, both.
SPEAKER_02: no no you're actually you're actually just sleep just sleeping yeah you're actually saying i will i will beat both of them they don't have to be they don't have to worry or nothing it will be yeah it will be easy and they they will they will feel no pain
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, no pain. He will be very gentle. Okay. Okay, we will see. We will see how it will be. It will be great. And Georgi, welcome, my friend. Welcome. It's good to see you. You're a great arm master. And look at the bicep. Ooh. Everyone is showing bicep. We don't see Evgeny's. Evgeny, one last time.
SPEAKER_02: Are you serious about your shape being better than the time that you beat Tata Sings? Say the truth. Yeah. You believe that? Okay. Okay. Irakli, he said that his shape is better than the time that he beat Tata Sings. It means that if you beat him, you will beat Evgeny that would even beat the Evgeny who beat Tata Sings.

Boom, boom. One second, telephone. Boom, boom. Yeah, solves everything right away. Yeah. Five minutes, I set the match. Yeah. Anyways.
SPEAKER_02: Thank you very much, guys. Last words. If you want to say something, Irakli, last words. Say and we finish. Irakli, what do you think about the result of the competition? It's not a big deal. The athletes did a great job in this sport. And to be honest, the people, the fans, the fans of the club were very happy. Both me and the team.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I wish both athletes health and no injuries. And let's show the arm wrestling world two great, beautiful matches. Is Sigan already apologized for beating both of them? Yeah, I will apologize to their face. Okay.
SPEAKER_02: And Evgeny, what's your last word? I'll say that Irakli is getting tired too quickly. That will be during our match also. He will just get tired and I'll beat him.
SPEAKER_02: Can you tell Irakli? Irakli said he's tired. He'll be back after the match. I hope so. I see now. Don't you even hope for that? I'm just tired now, but I will not be tired during the match.
SPEAKER_02: okay and the last one and can you ask georgie to say his last force before we stop does he have any message for the fans or for iraqi or anyone
SPEAKER_02: Well, I think, no, seriously, of course, Irakli has a belt, I want to take it from him, and I think that both one and the other should, well, worry, at least, as much as possible, be afraid that I will go to 95 and 105, because, well, it's true.
SPEAKER_02: I'm sure both of them are worried about it. I came here to win. They have some titles there, they need to keep them. I'll come and take them. No problem. I'll take them, most likely. It's good if I don't take them.
SPEAKER_02: Just to be serious, I know that Diracli has the belt and I want to get that belt. And I think both of these athletes should be at least worried. But to be honest, they have to be scared of me because I can pull in both weight classes and they both have to be worried. I'm a real threat and I think I can take those belts.
SPEAKER_02: That's good. That's good. That's good. I like his confidence. And Tonico, thank you very much, my friend. Irakli, thank you very much. It was a long time. Sorry. And Evgeny, thank you very much, my friend. And don't forget to prepare the song for Irakli. And don't make it so gay. And thank you very much, Georgi. Welcome again. And hope to see you in October, my friend. Take care, guys. Thank you.
