SPEAKER_01: Yo, what's going on, YouTube? What is going on? You guys, welcome to the Team West podcast here on the East vs. West channel. We're going to talk about all things West. You know, we don't need any translators here. We can flow clearly, all right? Keep it moving for you guys. We want to talk about all popular topics that are going on in the world right now, all the big things coming up with Challenger Series, King of the Table, East vs. West events, things of the like. Today, I'm joined with Mr. Chance Shaw himself, the tugboat.
SPEAKER_01: captain. And Mr. Paul Talbot, the assassin, the left-handed monster. Yeah, make sure to join us, Paul. Chance, you're supposed to be here every week. Paul, thank you for joining us and hanging out. Yeah, no problem. Thanks for having me. So, I mean, before we get into everything, Paul, where you been, man? What's going on with you?
SPEAKER_02: I've been around just training. I don't know, my injury a couple years ago kind of set me back a little bit. I went through a divorce and had to kind of restart my life. So that was a minor setback. But besides that, just my kids and training just quietly and not just waiting for an opportunity, you know what I mean, and finally got that match with Artem. But besides that, too much. You feeling pretty strong right now?
SPEAKER_02: yeah yeah it's feeling pretty good you looked really strong against arto yeah i know last time you guys pulled i i think you got got a win on you right like before that yeah he beat me probably about a year year and a half before that down in south carolina yeah and then you avenged that one three zero looked pretty easy for you too yeah yeah i was feeling pretty good that day so
SPEAKER_01: um yeah the uh a lot of people always think especially when like outside perspective they think us as athletes like that life should just be like this we're always getting stronger we're always training right there's nothing in life that can happen that could slow us down or no excuse to not be in top form at all times which is like wild like when people say things like what have you been doing why are you not better like dude there's life there's real life that's happening like why are you not always better than last time it's not easy we're not millionaire paid athletes in some sport where
SPEAKER_01: We have personal trainers and all this shit and everything's paid for. I'm sorry to be nice, but it's like that's not what it is. And so I hate when, you know, we're we're normal. We're normal. Joe's trying to make it. That's the sport is still growing. We're we're average dudes trying to make this happen. We have relationships and things that can help hold us back, you know?
SPEAKER_02: if there's 98% of us work nine to five at the very least. So we can, and everybody knows that the majority of us, whether it's once a year, twice a year, five times a year has that off day. And sometimes it's out of practice. And unfortunately, sometimes it's at a big tournament. So, I mean, he's got to take them on a chin sometimes. Yes, sir. Absolutely. And then come back stronger, right? That's right.
SPEAKER_00: So, Chance, I know you're in top form right now. How's your gym been going? You ready for any matches? You know what? I have been training the last couple weeks, Derek. You should be proud of me. I've been off the couch. I got my pulley system set up in the garage. I've been hitting some arm wrestling-specific training. I got up the gym. But, no, it's been going good. I just got back from a walk. I'm doing walks now, too, an hour a day. Chance, you can't have the dad bug yet. You're not a dad yet.
SPEAKER_00: i know i gotta i gotta tighten it up you gotta wait because what's the dad bug it was like when you had the kid then it's gonna be a double guy it's gonna be scary no no training's been going good uh ibrahim sagov called me out yesterday on uh instagram so i've been trying to uh spark that match hopefully i can land that we'll see dude that is a scary man
SPEAKER_00: like there's no joking around remember when todd couldn't rub his head he like he said do not rub my head on the stage whatever it was like me a big problem like that's it that's a serious dude strong so strong super strong yeah yeah yeah when he just smoked sandrus i thought i had him winning against andrus but three zero dominant was kind of scary although zarab did beat him
SPEAKER_01: beat zero so you never know it could be a style well i mean yeah stylistically he's a deep inside puller you're the slow hand top roller i mean you have the you have the edge stylistically it's just is the strength level you know you know and the strength has to be close for your style you know you know engen set it up we'll find out uh what what other matches that you have set up right now paul
SPEAKER_02: Or are you allowed to say? Is it all secret? I don't really know what I'm allowed to say, what I'm not, really. I do plan on attending East versus West. And I guess I don't know why I haven't been added to the card or not, but I've got word of a possible match. So I guess, I don't know, I guess we let Ingen decide whether he wants to publicize it or confirm it or not. I don't know.
SPEAKER_02: we'll do or we just say it is hope that it happens but it's it should happen 99 sure it'll happen so is it uh july or august or do you know august yeah nice
SPEAKER_02: july he was he was him all around about the july one which which really realistically wouldn't have worked out for me just because of work and stuff and i i told him in the past that like i kind of need a little bit more heads up than like a month just i mean not only for training purposes but work purposes too i don't get an expendable amount of time off work so i need like at least a month and a half two months so
SPEAKER_02: um he was able to say if i do then it will be august so yeah well august is a lot shorter travel too so you should have to take off less time uh right exactly it works out perfectly especially um the weight cut and travel which i shouldn't have to cut much weight if i get into 85 kilos but um the travel is big too i
SPEAKER_00: i hate flying it's terrible yeah it's it's like a two and a half hour flight from ohio to florida i think versus what like 12 hours to istanbul right right yeah finally we have the advantage yeah finally well we better better put out then because yeah yeah we can't be complaining now yeah yeah we can't use excuses that then get crushed like that'll be terrible
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it's crazy. The job I used to have before I started working where I'm at now, it was like I worked at UPS, man. I was a supervisor over there, and it was requested time off. And I always thought, man, my schedule sucks. It's so hard to arm wrestle and stuff with this. But now that I work only on the weekends and I have no paid time off,
SPEAKER_01: It's like now if I leave for arm wrestling, I get screwed out of money because there's no guaranteed money. It's like tips there. So I only worked weekends. So it was actually easier. You only worked the weekends. That's it. Yeah, just Thursday, Friday, Saturday. I was all excited. I was like, work three days a week, man? Like, hell yeah. But it's like proving to be more difficult now to travel and do that because I'm assed out of money if I leave. Like, I just don't make money. There's no pay time off. But it's more free. They'll give me time off. Yeah, whatever you want. But that means no money. I'm just assed out. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: like it's kind of making it more difficult which is weird in terms of travel training is way better i get to sleep eat train that's great but yeah traveling is a little more difficult all right so i definitely want to mention again you guys uh east first west 13 coming up july 6th in istanbul you guys if you do if you guys do not have the pay-per-view or anything like that it's going to be on the core sports app
SPEAKER_01: um moderators if you guys are in here please share the link to where people can find that oh lobby already did already on top of it thank you loggy appreciate that uh you guys anybody in the chat i'll try to keep an eye on it you guys know i always keep an eye on the chat but um
SPEAKER_01: guaranteed Super Chats will get a read. 100%. Just want to put that out there. You know what I'm saying? This is on the East from the West channel. This isn't even going to me. So I'm just saying that pops up because it makes it colored. So I'll definitely see it is what I'm saying. But yeah, we're going to hop into all that. I do want to touch on King of the Table. That's coming up very soon as well. And I also invited Shane Owens in the chat. I sent you a link, Shane, if you want to pop in here. We talked about your match a little bit. Talk some crap if you want about the Challenger Series and other things coming up.
SPEAKER_01: um the chance you're super active right now man you're mr promoter yeah i'm mr promoter now i'm just a washed up athlete i had to go promoter we gotta get you some more bling that ring isn't gonna be enough do we need some necklaces we need some stuff man yeah yeah i think you have to make money to buy rings oh you're the wrong sport money wait what
SPEAKER_01: i don't want to say that i don't want to joke around about that because our wrestling is doing great in terms of where it's ever been yeah yeah money-wise right i have to say that i don't i don't want we need to stop making fun of ourselves about being a broke sport all right we're doing better we're doing better if you compare now to 10 years ago it's crazy right right
SPEAKER_00: it's crazy yeah we've had a lot of growth which is amazing i made a lot more money 10 years ago than i am right now arm wrestling so just to let you know you know i'm i'm sure like individuals there's people that were doing better 10 years ago but i feel like as a sport as a whole more people are making more money you know what i mean 10 years ago i wasn't even arm wrestling so i guess i shouldn't really speak on it but 10 years ago you're like 15 years old bro
SPEAKER_00: Ten years ago, I was 15 years old. That's on the money. That's when I met you. Were you 15 when you came out here when I met you? Or you were young? I was 16 or 17 when I came here. Oh, okay. I started in – what year did I – I started in 2015. So I was 16 when I started. I think that's the year that I met you, Chance, in Riverside. Yeah, yeah. That was the same time I met Derek as when I met you when you pulled Daniel Worley. You beat him, what, 3-1 that day, I think. Yeah, yep. Wait, you were out there in Riverside too, Paul? I don't even remember. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah. Man, I met like Mike Aiello, Matt Mass. Matt beat Mike. I beat Cody. Jeez. Yeah. That's been a long time. It wasn't a long time ago. It's crazy. So screenshot this. Artem there any matches on King of the Table that you guys are particularly excited about that are standing out to you guys?
SPEAKER_00: So I'm excited about Ravaz and Georgie.
SPEAKER_00: Like, I don't hear anyone talking about that match, which is crazy to me. Because, like, I guess neither of them speak English. Neither of them have social media. So I get people not really following it that much. But it's such a good matchup. Like, both of those guys are monsters. Rivas is right there with those top five guys. And Georgie, we've only seen once, right, against Sergey right-handed. And he beat Sergey pretty convincingly. And that was right when he came back, too. Real quick in the chat.
SPEAKER_01: I don't mean to interrupt. Sorry. People are asking where Paul Lynn is. Paul is on his way home. Hopefully, he'll pop in here in a minute. He has the link. You can't seem to get all three of us that are supposed to be on this podcast at the same time. Hopefully, Paul will pop in any minute. He has the link. I'm just waiting for him to join up, guys. Sorry. Also, Justin Bishop has the link and Shane Owens, so they might just pop in here at any moment. We'll see. It's cool if it's just us three, but hopefully, they all can join up.
SPEAKER_01: um but yeah so georgie's right off dude he obviously he's a mom physically one of the most intimidating dudes in the world when you see him in person this dude is seething whatever and just like angry people in walk he he would take it to machi uh machi shanko often he's one of the dudes that would always be machi shanko in the finals and just in a hook just and just brick wall yeah left in his left hand as well right was he beating my struggle left hander
SPEAKER_01: um i don't remember he pulled left-handed at uh at east versus west seven maybe so i know he's good both arms but this is a right-handed match i can't remember his left-handed laugh i know there's some people in the chat that will know the answer that was he beating much i knew i think he beat him a few years in a row in the finals uh yeah if he was left-handed or right-handed i'm not sure i mean check and help me out with that um but then obviously ravaz he's okay you know he's all right
SPEAKER_01: I think his biggest win is you, right? Yeah. His biggest win is definitely beat me. Barely, barely got that. He just squeezed it out. He got lucky that day. Uh, like he says, right. I used to beat him both. Yeah. So he had a much check those number. I don't think a lot of people want to hook with Yvonne. They were, they're always running, you know, he said, let's do it. And like that thing's crazy. Um,
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I think that's a really interesting match. That's definitely one I want to see for sure. What about you, Paul? Do you look forward to anything specific in there, or do you know all the matches? I do know of the matches, but I've just been so out of tune with everything and how everybody's been doing, really. I don't really have anything to comment as far as favorites or anything like that. I'm excited to see all of them, actually. Paul and Lachlan should be
SPEAKER_02: obviously we're cheering for our boy you know but uh that's good lachlan's a beast but so is paul but lachlan's a bigger frame dude normally right he's cutting down yeah yeah yeah what what is he what did he come down like 20 30 pounds yeah i think before he was around like 250. yeah that's right 230 230.
SPEAKER_02: 231. Yeah, so it'll be interesting to see if Lachlan holds that power and Paul gains something, because I heard he's coming up, right? Yeah, yeah. I don't know how much weight Paul has gained or if he can possibly gain anymore. The last I talked to Paul...
SPEAKER_01: Last I talked to Paul, he was like 228, so he was pretty close. Oh, really? Yeah, so he's good, man. I think Paul's more well-rounded than Lachlan. I think Lachlan's a great armor slayer. I think Paul's more comfortable being well-rounded. They can both attempt different things, but I think Paul's top role is at a good level and his hook's at a good level. He's a little more polished. I think it'll be a strength thing. Will Lachlan's weight and just mass carry over enough, or will Paul be able to just pull off some kind of
SPEAKER_00: I don't know if Paul can go through Lachlan's power. I don't know. Maybe he can. Hopefully he can. I'm cheering for Paul for sure. Who do you think has the most endurance? That's my question. What's the rule set for you? Artem they running fouls right now? No, it's the same rules as East versus West, I think. It might be three. It's not three fouls. No, I'm pretty sure it's the same rules. It's just best of six. Six rounds instead of...
SPEAKER_01: rounds. Oh, we got to check out in the chat. What's going on? What's up, Sergey? What's up, Sergey? I need revenge on you soon, buddy. Hey, I'll let you know how Travis feels. I'll let you know. Adam, I wish I had some time to prep for this. Go for it. Yeah, so what's up? Talk to me a little bit about that there. I've seen your YouTube. Yeah, I...
SPEAKER_01: I was supposed to have a match with Kyle Hutchings. He got injured. He tore his left rotator cuff, so he can't really even hold onto the pig. So he kind of got, he's out. And we were talking about matches and, um,
SPEAKER_01: uh we couldn't agree on finding a right-handed match and then i was like uh well i'll be there left-handed i mean hey tech my right my left is ranked seventh my right is ranked eighth in north america so it's okay it shows up sometimes uh but i hadn't been training it specifically i mean i'm only doing two-handed stuff it's there but i everything everybody cares about right arm you know but uh traditionally
SPEAKER_01: But I was like, well, I got the left arm. And I was like, Travis is there. I was like, I know he's making a comeback. He's training and stuff. And people want to see him have a match. And so let's do it. Let's run it. And I'll see if he's strong enough yet. We'll test it out. But it's healthy. Luckily, my left arm is healthy. I've never had my wrist injured ever in my left arm. It's never cracked or popped or anything like that. So everything's healthy in my left wrist. It's making sure the rest of it can all hold up. But
SPEAKER_01: I mean, I'm interested to see, you know, he has a match coming up in East vs. West pretty soon with Kalinichenko. I think their match is right-handed, though. Right-handed. Either way, this will kind of show, you know, people where Travis is at. Obviously, nothing would be better than getting a win on Travis Bajan. Oh, it would just, just seeing him show, I would, I'll start dancing. Like, remember how he danced against Lepke's where he's like, I told you I'm going to start doing that while I'm holding on to Travis if I beat him.
SPEAKER_01: now i know he's oh wait i said in my stream i'm not going to give him respect i know he's like top 10 maybe left-handed ever i'm gonna keep saying that just to piss him off the top 10 lefty ever but uh yeah if i if i get that win man and i'm gonna give you everything i have for sure on the table i'm gonna leave it all there so uh so when is that that's in um june 15th at the challenger series in florida
SPEAKER_01: By the way, moderators, can you guys plug thechallengerseries.com, right? And get your guys' pay-per-view or in-person tickets. Is the sale already over, Chance, or is it still going? It's over. You guys might have missed the sale, but either way, go over there and get your guys' pay-per-view tickets and or in-person tickets. If you guys are interested in getting any of the VIP experience or the General Mission Plus, then it's on the website, right?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, everything's over on the website. Just check it out. All the descriptions are there. June 15th. The price is higher than it was yesterday, but it'll still be more expensive day of. So make sure... This is the early bird stage two tickets, if you will. So you still have a chance to save some money. What is it right now? I think it's $14.99 for pay-per-view and $29.99 for in-person tickets. Gotcha. Yeah. Yeah, so...
SPEAKER_01: That's how the Travis match came about. And then I'm going to have to commentate with him the whole time before. We're going to be talking crap to each other. And then we're going to have the match and then talk crap afterwards. And it'll be a fun lead up. Whatever. I'm used to Travis. He's just that guy. He's that guy in your friend group that just runs his mouth all the time. You know what I mean? Like, that's just who he is. So it's like, you can't take anything he says personally. I know he's like, oh, whoop your ass. You're like, your mom raised a sissy. I don't know. He's going to say all types of stupid crap. He's just going to run his mouth. Whatever.
SPEAKER_02: paul didn't didn't you almost have a win on him back in the like yeah i think i remember that i gave it a good fight to say the least i guess i don't know that was 165 too oh you talking about that i thought you were talking about last year at his uh at his tournament
SPEAKER_02: uh yeah i pulled him in the overalls there i actually did a lot better than that 165. 165 that was probably like 14 something like that and i would just i held on yeah he couldn't he could fit me for like five ten seconds maybe but i don't know i was proud of it at 165 pounds yeah and that was also like peak travis bajan that's when he was in top of the world
SPEAKER_02: I did actually did the same thing in 13 to Devin in the overalls, too. But he kind of baited me into a hook, and it ended up a lot quicker than that Travis match just because he baited me in there. I thought I felt a lane, and I didn't. He just baited me in a hook and then took me right over. Yeah, I don't know if I saw that one. And introduce you to the stream.
SPEAKER_01: The weapon himself, Mr. Shane Owens joining us. Shane, what is up, man? Another day, man. Just a good day to be above ground, you know what I mean? I didn't even know your head was shaved. Was the shave last time I saw you? Or is this new? Yeah. Yeah. Bro, I went bald at like 23, man. Okay. Yeah. All right, well, thanks for joining us, man. I thought we'd maybe chop it up about other matches. We can get onto your match a little bit, the Challenger Series, things like that.
SPEAKER_01: You don't have to hang out in the chat all the time. You can join us sometimes, Shane. It's okay. You can hang out. All right. Hold on a second. I unplugged my shit. Eric, I just shared the link if you want to throw up Paul's match with Travis. Oh, okay. We're doing that, huh? If you want to. It's up to you. Oh, in the...
SPEAKER_02: got to find the the devin lorette one too i think it's on like a little little uh first generation box phone but it's on youtube too somewhere i love this here i'm gonna put it up here on the screen here i mean a lot of these new fans might not know who paul talbot is they they need to realize how serious this dude is now even though old fans don't even know who called out his chance they they need to
SPEAKER_01: Yo, this is 165 here, Paul, and this is top form Travis. Yeah. What year was this? The look on Travis' face. What was that, 13 or 14? 14. Should say 14. Yeah. That's strong Travis, too. Yeah. Oh, it's good. Yeah, he's like, he's getting frustrated. He's getting scared. You know he's getting scared right here.
SPEAKER_02: What was he saying, Paul? Was he telling him to stand up? No, I was just holding on, hoping he'd screw up, but he never got out of position. That's serious, though. At 165, that's crazy. That is absolutely wild. I cut to 165, but I'd never gained all my way back, so I was probably at 175 that day. That's still really good.
SPEAKER_00: What's up, Shane? What's up, Chance? How you doing, brother? Can't complain. Living the dream, you know? Hey, Chance is feeling strong. He's acting like a promoter right now, but Chance is an animal right now. I'm just a promoter. Don't tell anyone. Don't blow his head up, man. We don't need to give Chance compliments right now. Chance feels terrible. I got to pull with Shane, what, about a month and a half ago?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, it's been all that round robin that under one. Well, the second one that he won. Yeah. Yeah. You're feeling strong. I'm excited to see you and Carl Stanley. I think it's a good matchup. I really do. Yeah. style was, you know, I think I think everybody kind of knows that it's just going to come down to whether or not I could stop this press. Yeah, like, yeah. You're like now you're like a little dude, right?
SPEAKER_03: I'm down 79 pounds. Yeah. Good for you, man. What do you like? Yeah. 251. Nice. I'm trying to gain a few back. I'm trying to just hover in that 253 to 255 range. I mean, that's what I'm waking up at. You know, by the end of the day, I'm like 258. Yeah, I'm just trying to stay in that range. I've done that for the past couple weeks, and I'm trying to keep that throughout the match tomorrow, just so I'm not coming in too depleted. Yeah, right. And too big of a deficit.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah, yeah. You don't want to give Carl an advantage, right? Yeah, hell no, you can't. No. He looks mean right now. Yeah, he's feeling strong. I'll tell you, like, one year ago, he was not feeling that great. But today, he's feeling like old Carl. So that's – you got to come in serious. Oh, yeah, I definitely am. I'm definitely taking it serious. Like I said, I think all around it's a good matchup. He's a little bit bigger, but –
SPEAKER_03: I think if we go frame to frame, I like my chances, but it'll come down to whether or not I could stop Chris. He's going to have to dive into it at some point. That's the big if factor. Yeah. So you win this match, and then what? What do you want to do? Where do you want to go? What are you looking for? You know where I want to go. What's that?
SPEAKER_01: I'm trying to go back to Colorado. Oh, that one. Okay. Yeah, man. That was a great experience. Well, dude, yeah, I'm still working on that. Still talking to Brian. He's so busy. It's just hard. Communication is harder than I'm going to mess with him again in the next couple of days to start trying to iron out a name. It's just we plan as of right now, and I think we can hopefully talk about it, is that Angan wanted to set two East versus West matches there.
SPEAKER_01: he said, okay, I'll think of the athletes and I'll let you know. That was the last thing I heard from Engen. So we're kind of in this waiting period. But I also, I don't think, I know Brian is down to offer what he offered last time to the athletes in terms of what he was paying. I don't know if Engen's going to want to throw something at it or how we're doing that in terms of getting athletes there and things like that. So we have to figure that out because there's not a lot of funds to pull from. There's no pay-per-view for the arm wrestling and things like that. So we have to iron all that stuff out. But
SPEAKER_03: I always want you there Shane for sure if I can get you there hey man like from an athlete standpoint we was treated like amazing it was just an amazing experience from the time we I mean I didn't even have to book my flight you know what I mean just like from the time that we said it's a go to the time it was over and I was home it was like everything was handled everything was taken care of it was really good experience um so yeah I'm down to go back but as far as like
SPEAKER_03: other than that after the match with carl i'm probably still going to cut down some more um i want to compete in the 105 110 kg classes you know but i figure if i could be around there some of the local tournaments that do the 253 class well i could just i could be well fit going into it still double class and supers
SPEAKER_03: I don't know that I'll be looking for too many more super matches at super heavyweight. Standing beside Chance and Dylan Williamson kind of reminded me that I ain't got the frame. Them's some big boys. Big boys. I'm too small for that. And then you see Derek and you realize why I'm getting out of supers. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Derek was standing taller than all the guys at the Shaw Classic. He was taller than Brian. There's a picture of him beside Tom Stoltman. He was like a half inch taller than him. I mean, it may or may not have been the shoes. It may or may not have been the shoes. But we won't talk about that. I chose the wrong spot. I should have done strongman, man. Maybe I should have done that instead. Um...
SPEAKER_01: So we got the comeback of Michael Todd and Lars. Oh, not comeback, but he already had Frank Lamparelli. But Michael Todd and Lars coming up, that's going to be a wild match. There's no way it's not a crazy match in terms of movements and crazy things happening. It's going to be a very extreme match, I guess I'd say. Mike, I love Mike's death. His match with Frank Lamparelli did not look the way I thought his arm was going to look.
SPEAKER_01: it opened up more than i i was like i was a little i mean he won he came out with the wind and graduated the mic for sure i just with his uh after he had a surgery and everything i thought it'd be more like i don't know i was expecting more in more more drive more success in here and not as much out there i thought he'd be more offensive and stuff and be more proficient with that i guess yeah but to be fair frank's hand is ridiculous i mean he has wins on a georgie svetkov
SPEAKER_00: right-handed i mean like his hand is it doesn't get much better than frank lamparelli's hand the the thing holding frank back is his arm so like when you take michael's hand he's going to open up a lot more than when he has his hand and it's also going to be a lot harder for michael to come in i feel against frank versus lars like lars has a strong hand but he's going to be able to access his arm a lot more i think yeah that makes sense he's probably gonna die but didn't he try like he tried a king's move last time like yeah yeah
SPEAKER_01: Double kings. Or maybe we see Michael pressing through Lars' Kingsman. Oh, yeah. They both have a press. They both have a Kingsman. Dude, this is going to be a wild match for sure. Oh, yeah. Hopefully no one gets hurt. And then I think most people are excited about Machesheko and Morozov.
SPEAKER_01: uh that's the one last last time we had the the show we were talking about that one a lot um I mean to see where much checko is left-handed I mean no traditionally he's been a certain level I don't know uh what how his training has progressed if he's gaining weight if he's getting made stronger um whereas more as I've had we haven't seen him compete uh left-handed super recently and you know he was sick uh for George Svetkov like where's he at a little bit um
SPEAKER_01: But, I mean, it's going into a hook. Matsushenko's getting into a hook, for sure. If there's one thing that dude can do, it's sink in a hook against anybody. Because he's like 6'5". Matsushenko is way bigger than people think. You see my video, you understand how tall he is. You stand next to him, you're like, oh. So they're probably about the same height-wise, Matsushenko and Morozov. But, I don't know, man. Morozov's jacked. Jacked and, whoa. Who do you think wins that? Paul, who wins that match?
SPEAKER_02: I'm going for Morozov, really. He just looks, just like you said, he looks jacked. Who wins that? Morozov. Morozov? Yes.
SPEAKER_00: All right. Chance, you think so? Yeah, I hate to agree with everyone, but I think Morozov has it. Until proven otherwise, I'm going to pick Morozov in left-handed matches. That's just my thinking. Just like right-handed, I'm going to pick LeVon to win any match until proven otherwise, right? You've got to go with the guy who's winning. Yeah, makes sense. And then, yeah, if you guys have any comments, there's Vitalii and Camille, Schoolboy and Ryan Bowen. Um,
SPEAKER_00: Irakli, Angerbaev, and Oleg Petro. I think that's a good match. Angerbaev and Petro? Yeah. Petro has the horsepower. I just don't know if he's going to, number one, be fast enough, and number two, be able to figure it out. Because I think Angerbaev's probably the most technical arm wrestler. But as far as power goes, if it goes anywhere inside, Angerbaev's going for a ride. Yeah, that's true. And I have to root for Oleg because he whooped me.
SPEAKER_01: I like Camille in the other match. Camille and Vitalii. Yeah, I like Camille. Do you guys think that if Camille beats Vitalii, that that means Jerry can beat Vitalii? Although this is left-handed, right? And there must be, right? Yeah, it's left-handed. I think Vitalii pulls pretty similar in both hands, right? Stylistically, yeah. So do you think that if Camille takes it to him, that that means that Jerry would really have something for him? It's hard.
SPEAKER_00: mean the difference though is camille is is more like coming over top cupping and pressing where jerry's jamming so it's not like they're both presses but they're a little bit different yeah camille pins you on his side of the table jerry pins you on your side yeah yeah exactly yeah presses to me are not pretty techniques but i think camille does a damn good job of making pretty like technically his press is really really fun to watch even though i'm not a fan of presses normally yeah
SPEAKER_00: And Camille has to have the fastest rise of all time. Like two years ago, nobody even knew who this guy was. And now he has a match against Vitalii for essentially the number one or number two spot in the world. It's crazy. Yeah. A lot of people are saying Vitalii should be number one, like yada, yada. What's he actually ranked in the world? Do we even know? I don't know off the top of my head, left-handed. In East versus West rankings or in the world rankings?
SPEAKER_01: Both, I guess. Does Engen still run the armed sports news rankings? No clue. He used to. I don't know. He still does that. And the export news one?
SPEAKER_00: And the export news one, they have Vitalii at five. They have Morozov one, Alazan two, Prudnik three, Darakian four, Vitalii five, which to me is a little bit off. And they have Kamil six, so it's only a... And then we have Alex Grudetcha up there, and he went toe-to-toe with Morozov and, like, back and forth. Grudetcha they have at nine. What?
SPEAKER_00: mean i guess in terms of who's beaten who but like he was right there with morozov like it was neck and neck like that match was insane yeah honestly we haven't gotten a like enough high level left-handed matches to really know the exact order but yeah i i think i agree with most people it's like morozov and vitality kind of one and two somewhere and then you got guys like kardeccia maybe uh i was on where where is holler all john yeah all john could be one to five who knows yeah he could be anywhere in there yeah
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, left-handed, and then now Travis can be trying to hop in the mix, shake things up. Yeah. Where do you think he's going to land? Like when he tops out, like a full-form Travis back there? Assuming he doesn't get hurt, you know? I'm saying within the next few matches, where do you think he's going to land, or everybody's going to think he's going to be? Ask me again in a month. Ask me again in a month, and I'll have a better answer. You don't get that, Derek. You don't get that.
SPEAKER_01: Travis' technique is so unique in how he executes it and stuff. It's just not something you come across normally. And I think that poses a lot of problems for people. But there's so many long dudes now. There's so many big guys with my height, as much muscle mass or more, that are going to be able to stay there with Travis, that that might pose a lot of problems for him. Like if Morozov, with my length, but with a ton of bicep, can just... That's a lot harder, I think, for Travis nowadays than the basic guys that were like...
SPEAKER_01: smaller, but ballooned up to different weights. Man, if I put money on it, I'm thinking top five. I'm thinking about top five in the next year. Top five in the world? Just coming back into it? Wait, are we talking about soon or right now? You said right now? Right now. Where do we think he's going to land?
SPEAKER_01: Oh, right now, sorry. Right now, 15 to 20, top 20. So that's where you think he's going to walk in at? It's hard, dude, because he just has to...
SPEAKER_00: He has all the movement and all the tendons and everything dialed in. He just has to get some muscle on there. And who is he training with? Who could he – we even asked how his training was going. Artem came over to my house to train like a month ago and said Travis is so strong and he's going to kill everyone. So like Artem is some sort of frame of reference, but obviously there's a difference between Artem and the top five guys in the world. But they're better, man.
SPEAKER_02: There better be because if not, then I'm just going to keep eating it and be top five too. Yeah, there you go. But my opinion, I think Travis is going to be top ten within the first year of him coming back, if not higher. If he takes it serious for a full year. Yes. That's a realistic expectation, and I'm hoping for that as well. I hope he still has it. I hope he's still in the mix and can come in and still kick butt.
SPEAKER_00: Well, the good thing about Travis is his style. He doesn't really get injured. He doesn't have any wonky arms. He can't open his arm or crazy wrist pain or shoulder pain like most arm wrestlers deal with because all of his matches are so quick. So I feel like for him, if he still has the timing, he's going to have the technique. All he needs to do is add power. So Travis is in a situation where I feel most arm wrestlers aren't, where as long as he gets stronger, he's going to be better.
SPEAKER_01: A lot of arm wrestlers, yeah, getting stronger helps, but they still have to figure things out where Travis is so fluid anyways. Kalina, can you beat Travis left-handed right now, you think? Let us know in the chat. Why is it right-handed? What are you ranked, Derek? Left-handed? Yeah. I've been in North America left-handed. You say, what are you ranked left-handed? Yeah, what are you ranked left-handed? I'm seventh right now in North America.
SPEAKER_03: Artem you ranked in the world? Oh, no. No. Derek's probably top 40. Yeah. So he better hope that he beats you. Yeah, he better hope. For all this, like, top 10 in a year. Honestly, Chance, if I beat Travis, he might not come back to the commentary booth. I'm just letting you know I might ruin the rest of the event in terms of that. Hey, that's okay, because if you beat Travis, that's crazy. What's the odds Hunter Knobbs could beat Travis right now?
SPEAKER_01: uh that's i know hunter is your boy but that's that's crazy that's a tall task yeah hey somebody asked me uh recently like if i could travel or move somewhere train for arm wrestling where would i go and i said carolina yeah spartanburg come on or or utah
SPEAKER_01: Utah with Jordan Sill and all those guys, that's a good squad to practice with, too. Or Pennsylvania, somewhere near Portland. It's one of those three, the three places I was talking about. Yeah, you can move to that center. You can pull with Todd Hutchings. You can pull with me. You can pull with Paul in. Tom Toledo. Yeah. That's Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania, Ohio, yeah. That's it.
SPEAKER_00: that's a active place or i guess new jersey would be bad about marcio and there's you know yeah everybody goes there too so that'd be a good spot to go to the northeast has the benefit of population density so you have so many arm wrestlers within like three hours it's crazy we're here in the southeast like to to get to to their practice it's like to shane's practice it's like a seven hour drive for me where like yeah we got
SPEAKER_03: We got a couple guys that are driving like four, four and a half hours every week, like one way. One that comes from Wilmington down to Myrtle Beach to jump in the car with another one to ride up. And I'm like, man, they're dedicated. I don't know if I could be that dedicated. You know what I mean?
SPEAKER_02: I thought I was dedicated when I started. I used to drive two and a half hours to practice with Relentless and Dave Chafee and them. I'd drive two and a half hours. They'd only practice for like 45 minutes. I'd get in the car and drive two and a half hours. But four and a half hours, that's dedication. Yeah. Man, I bet you I have to drive more than 10 minutes to practice. I run the practice, though. I'm just staying near my house. That's not fair. Yeah, I look that, man. I used to run the practice, but I moved 10 minutes away from practice, so it kind of works out for me.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it's like right at 45 minutes to an hour for me, so I'm pretty lucky. John Doe in the chat says, Derek, from 1 to 10, how much you wanted to punch mask? Zero. Like,
SPEAKER_01: I mean, in the moment, I'm hyped up. I have a lot of aggression towards Matt. If it cracked off, I'm down. But in no way was I ever thinking I want to hit him, like, at all. Dude, that's like little kid shit. We're here to, we're professional athletes, dude. I'm here to hone my aggression on the table, for sure. So at no point would I ever want to punch Matt. That's my boy, at all. You know what I mean? Like, but yeah, I'm hyped. If he swung on me, I'd be down. It'd be game on. But I have no way of thinking that way during the match at all, you know?
SPEAKER_01: All right, so still want to get on to Easter West 13, July 6th. You guys, once again, go get your pay-per-views and things like that for Easter West coming up and Kingdom Tables coming up, which we just talked about. Challenger Series, so after Kingdom Tables, Challenger Series, which Shane Owens has a match with Carl Stanley. I've matched with Travis. Chance is hanging out. I'm the promoter.
SPEAKER_01: I want to, we need to get on this East versus West thing. We didn't touch on it last time. I want to dive into this quickly. July 6th, East versus West 13. Yeah, July 6th. So it's like king of the table next week, two weeks after Challenger Series, two weeks after East versus West 13. You get a lot of arm wrestling in the next month. It's crazy. Yep. So we'll start at the bottom. I'll go around, give you guys opinions on each match or who you think will win. We'll work our way up the list real quick.
SPEAKER_01: Artem Taranenko, Tom Rositz, Chance, who wins? David you see Tom Rositz pull Europeans like two weeks ago? He got him on Oleg Oak. Oleg Oak beat Oleg Oak. Yeah. Dude, that might be a match coming up. Tom and Paul Talbot left-handed might be a match that's going to be talked about at some point. Artem you guys around the same weight? That used to be talked about back in the day, like back in –
SPEAKER_00: 13 14 and then then he had his accident and stuff and then it went away but i mean yeah probably eventually thank you tom tom's beating oleg scared me for artem but oleg's has some lanes i'm not uh what am i talking about yeah yeah
SPEAKER_00: Tom's has some lanes that are vulnerable to Artem, I feel. Like, my boy Emil pulled with Tom's last year in Norway, and Emil had great success with him. And Emil was just here pulling with Artem, and they had some decent matches. So, like, I don't know. I still think that there's lanes for Artem, but, yeah, Tom's has to be, like, 70% favorite. You guys agree, or anybody think that Artem has a good chance of beating him?
SPEAKER_02: I just don't know. I lost to Artem, and then I also avenged my loss and won, and I just don't know if his style can go through his head. I guess I don't know what Chance is talking about as far as Tom's lane, so maybe they both know something that I don't. I just don't think his rising attack is going to be beneficial for me.
SPEAKER_01: unless he has a different plan. Any thoughts on this one, Shane? These guys are about your weight class now. I'll back the slack on this one. I don't know who Olga Terpelova is, but against Carolina Petro, right-handed. You guys have any thoughts on this? Is Olga the Bulgarian that just won Europeans?
SPEAKER_00: Someone in the chat might know. I could be way off on that. Or no, that's Dimitrina. All right. So we're going to pass on this one. This is a Team West podcast. You know, it's understandable. They're pretty far away. I try to follow it all, but it's so hard. There's so many elite athletes over in Europe to remember them all. It's just tough. Right. But speaking of women's arm wrestling, did y'all see that Jocelyn Brisson –
SPEAKER_03: at the all women's round robin this past weekend beating sarah bachman oh that's what you're talking about yeah yeah dude like i had never heard of that i never heard of her and then out of nowhere she she did it really convincingly too yeah yeah i had never heard of her either and i i like went through her facebook page a little bit and i saw her benching 315 and i was like
SPEAKER_01: Okay, that's crazy, especially for a woman. Does Maggie know you're going through chicks' Facebook pages? Whoa, stop. Come on. Hold on. Mary, Mary. Whoa, don't say that. You keep that to yourself, bro. What are you talking about? Accidentally liking a picture from five years ago. I have to scout. No, I have to scout now that I'm a promoter. Oh, that's what we call it. All right, so Vladimir Morozov right-handed against your boy Adam Orzinski.
SPEAKER_03: How's that look? How's Adam feeling? You've been pulling him recently? Yeah, I mean, every week. Yeah, I pull with Adam every week. Thank you, man. I mean, it's no secret. Like, inside, it's a bad day for anyone. The longer the match goes, the better his odds get. I mean, his gas tank goes up while everybody else's goes down. So, yeah. All right, so gun to your head, what do you put the percentage at? 100%? Come on, be as unbiased as you can.
SPEAKER_03: Well, I don't really know his opponent too well. That's the 85 kg, though, right? It doesn't have the weight on here. Probably. I don't almost imagine. Yeah. I believe he's cutting back to 85, like 85 kg is his international weight. And I like him at that weight. He looked, man, he looked great last time and seemed like the cut went well for him. And I mean, he's a strong guy. So we'll go. I think he cut back. He was a.
SPEAKER_03: He got big for the Sharkovich match. Like he was walking around like 218, I believe, for that match. But it's just too much bloat for him. So I think he walks around around like the 205, 200 to 205. But we'll say 85% chance, just so I'm not saying 100%. Okay, I got you. To a piece, Derek. Paul, you agree?
SPEAKER_02: I don't know. It just all depends on what Adam shows up, I guess. I don't want to take anything away from him because last time I pulled him, he whooped me. But it seems like some days he's on fire and he has that gas tank that has an endless pit to it. And other days he's not there. So I would probably go – I'll go 60-40. I don't know.
SPEAKER_00: All right. Chance? I'm not going to lie. I'm not super familiar with Vladimir. Is Vladimir the guy that pulled against – what's the seven-time East versus West champ? I'm having a brain fart. Samushia? Samushia, yeah, yeah. He pulled Samushia like a couple East versus West ago. Is that the Vladimir that we're talking about? I believe so. Isn't it? If that's the case, that Vladimir –
SPEAKER_00: That Vladimir nearly beat Samushia. That was really – I mean, all of Samushia's matches seem close, but I don't know. I don't know. I don't want to arm wrestle a dude named Vladimir. I know Adam's legit, and I'm rooting for Team West, and he's looked good the last couple times he's went over there. He beat Arthur Muratov or whatever. 50-50 to me. 50-50? Yeah. All right. Yeah, I have no idea. Cheer for Adam.
SPEAKER_01: go Adam. I don't know much about Moira. Team Adam, for sure. Dimitrina Petro, Ayane Takenaka, right-handed. Anybody know anything about these names? No clue. No clue. Sorry, sorry, sorry. I'm sorry. All right, that's fine. I like it. That's all. Daniel Prokopchik, Bozhidar Simeonov, left-handed.
SPEAKER_02: That's interesting. I'm excited to see it. Daniel's better left-handed than right, right? Yeah. Okay. I hope Bojadar wins just so everybody can figure out if Daniel's an actual human being or not. That's the only reason I'm rooting for Bojadar. I just want to see somebody beat him, right?
SPEAKER_00: daniel's left is like ridiculous uh i got to grip up with him like two years ago in italy i couldn't even move his left arm not that i'm a left arm specialist but he's 160 pounds i'm like 305 at that point and i cannot even push him off center uh he like lets me work an inch to the pad and then pulls me back i'm like this guy is not a human being it's it's insane um
SPEAKER_03: Again, I'm not a left-handed guy, but that's just crazy to me. So I'm picking for Kopchick in every single left-handed match he ever has. After talking to Adam, I know he's been on the table with Daniel before, and he competed against Bozhidar. And just from hearing him speak, I mean, I'm going to pick Daniel. Yeah. I'm going to Daniel, too. It seems like a safe bet.
SPEAKER_01: Like what you just said, though, Chance, is why people are like, Derek, why don't you after pull? So you get a clip of a 6'8", 350-pound man against a 165 dude just getting held? But no. By the end of the night, there will be viral clips of me getting held by some small dude from some country I can't pronounce. I'm good. The crazy thing, Derek, this wasn't even after pulling. This was fresh for fresh. Like, I have no excuses. Chance.
SPEAKER_01: Well, yeah, it's your left arm. He wouldn't have done that, right? You would have crushed him, right? What do you mean close? I mean, we pulled right as well, and I was pinning him right, to be fair. Attaboy. Add that in. I should be anyone that weighs half my weight, right? Ooh, okay. Artem Taynov and Betkili Oniani in left cannon. I'm an Artem Taynov fan. That dude is exciting. He's strong as hell. He's been around for a long time. I hate that we're just starting to see him on East vs. West, but, dude.
SPEAKER_00: he he's way bigger than bet kelly isn't he part of him kind of uh pulled 95 kilo to be and he beat uh who did he beat to take that he beat sasha andrea to take that um world title belt and then bet kelly just pulled that 95 as well 25 yeah i don't think i've seen them both in person but art i mean just visually bet killer looks pretty skinny and martin looks
SPEAKER_00: well bet kill he's coming down from i think three years ago he was pulling in the 80 kilo class in waft and i think he's coming up from from that gotcha yeah that's when he pulled like fresh and stuff right left-handed yeah yeah okay yeah and now he's now i think he walks around around that 209 95 kilo weight so i mean they'll be similar weights
SPEAKER_01: Oh, Lagia said Bozhidar beat Prokofiev at the World Combat Games. Yes, he did. I watched it. Left-handed or right-handed? Left-handed. Really? Oh, so there's a mix. Something looked off. Oh. Maybe I'm making excuses for the guy that beat me, but something looked off. Okay. So that's probably why they're having the match. Gotcha, gotcha. Yeah. Any thoughts on Taynov and Oniani there, Shane? It's going to be killer. No thoughts? No.
SPEAKER_02: Paul? I don't know most of these Europeans, man. I'll just be honest with you. You cut out, Derek. What'd you say? You got any thoughts on that match, Oneyane and Tanoff? No, except for I just like to see it. I don't really have a favorite in that match, but I'm definitely excited to see it.
SPEAKER_01: I think Taynov's more explosive. I think he'll bring it. And Oneyone is a little more patient. The grinders he gets in and stuff like that. I think he's more posting and stuff like that. But Taynov, him against Sasho, he was very aggressive. I'm an animal.
SPEAKER_01: There's that I mean Taino I've got I think most well-known at least on this side of the pond when he pulled a crazy George back at Arnold's back in the day you see you saw George beat him because he was like You know the European guy is supposed to beat everybody came out here at Arnold's and he got a hold of crazy George I don't think you knew George was or what he was bringing to the table at George get that spot Wasn't open up. Yeah, but George is different. Yeah, he's that guy's not human he won Arnold's until he is what like 65 and
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, he won it years and years in a row. David he eventually leave Arnold's, or did he just stop going? I think he just quit. I think he just quit. He lost Arnold's, he just stopped. He's like, I'm good. I won that. Check that off the list. Arnold. We were talking about him at practice last week. Chad was talking about pulling him, and he was like, you know, that took years off of his life. You know what I mean? Pulling crazy George. He's like, that's one of those matches, like, part of you stays on the table. It's over.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, okay. I didn't know this was a match. Barbora versus Egle, right-handed. Okay, so we all kind of know who those girls are, right? They're the top two in the world, right? Artem they top two currently? So, Barbora's one, Gabby is two, Egle is three. Yeah. So...
SPEAKER_00: Last time Egle pulled Gabby, Egle, that was off the couch, Egle. She had never lost to Gabby, and she wasn't taking it that serious. And then Gabby beat her, and she looks different now. She looks crazy. How dominant she was against Sarah Backman in, what, East versus West 9, I think. Was it 9 when you were there? Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: I don't remember the numbers, but, yeah, I remember her being dominant. I can't remember which one. Yeah, anyways, Egle was, like, so dominant over Sarah. It was scary. I think that a different Egle showed up, and I actually think that she's going to pull off the upset over Barbora. To be fair, Barbora's, what, like, 22? Like, four-time WAF champion already. She's dominating everyone in WAF, so... I don't know. I think she's, like, taller than me and heavier than me and has more muscle than me, so I'm like...
SPEAKER_01: I love Barbora. I think she's awesome. She's my twin with long hair. Dude, I'm all about it. I'm hoping Barbora wins. I'd like to see her on top over there. Yeah. For a long time, so it'll be kind of cool to see them clash. Have you seen these ladies, Shane? You know about these two? Yeah, I know who you're talking about. Barbora's the favorite. If I had to pick, I would say Beth.
SPEAKER_01: yeah physically i think barbara's gonna be pretty a lot bigger than england even if the egg is being sized it's not short but it was 5 11 i think and uh barbara i think is 6 2. yeah awesome that's so great yeah yeah um after that travis major sergey kalinichenko right-handed i don't know sergey still in the chat or not
SPEAKER_03: um right-handed travis never i mean what what's the highest peak he got he was he ever number one he was up there he won a world championship he beat uh 2016 and beat chafee and michael todd yeah and that was when those two guys were like the top guys in the world so what was it like 2000 like 2003 or something didn't win a world championship in canada against uh the russian yes vivota i think that was 2005 right yeah 2005 so yeah that was right-handed
SPEAKER_01: Yeah. Yeah. So peak form Travis right handed. He's in the mix at WL days. They weren't, you know, he wasn't born with a spike on them, you know, but beat Chafee top form Chafee. So we'll say what we think we can all agree.
SPEAKER_01: peak form travis top five right-handed minimum top ten maybe top five yeah so now what form travis do we have right now i think we said uh by the end of the year we're hoping top you said top ten you pretty much guaranteed top ten yeah okay so somewhere around there that would put his right arm according to our shitty math here uh what like top 20 ish so i think i think sergey right now last time i checked the world rankings was ranked 15th right
SPEAKER_00: so wild probably off Matt that should be a close match yeah I mean I think Travis has a great style to pull Sergey obviously I pulled Sergey not too long ago uh where he beat me four to two but I think Travis's style matches up with Sergey a lot better than mine and if he's coming in strong I really think he can get the win he has to be the underdog though coming in against a guy who's super active super strong and Ukrainian like that's that's a tough opponent
SPEAKER_02: Okay, so give me the odds. What are you betting on? 51-49, Sergey. Sergey. Paul, what do you think? I'm going to 60-40 again. I'm going to pick our man Travis. Travis. Shane? Travis said I was going to lose to Carl Stanley, so Sergey. Okay.
SPEAKER_01: 60-40. 60-40. Prove me wrong, Travis. What do you have, Derek? Man, it's just where's Travis, right? I think stylistically, it's a good matchup. It benefits Travis. Like you said, I agree with that. Man, but Sergey's been... Can Travis over-suit match with Sergey being down to flop press and all that stuff? Can he do it over rounds? Um...
SPEAKER_01: We all know if Travis gets stopped, you don't like that stop match at all. I think off the top of my head, before I've seen Travis's form, I'm going to say I'll favor Sergey. 64, I'll favor Sergey off the top of my head right now. But it might change. I wish somebody knew what Travis was doing at this point in time. Right. I don't know. Yeah, I don't have access to that. Nobody, Artem's the only one that's felt him, right?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I think so. Well, there's big guys at those tournaments. No offense to Artem and their friendship, but you can't pull guys like Artem to get ready for these Europeans. Like, it's just – it doesn't work. Yeah. I mean, Travis has been pulling those tournaments, but I think the finals every time has been him and Artem or something. So, it's like – Right. Right. So, realistically, it's him and Artem practicing at these somewhat – Well, the thing is, like –
SPEAKER_01: I bring this up about like whenever any of the guys are these legends or guys have been around for a long time, Travis, John, Jerry, any of these guys have been around for a while when they say that they're ready for a match.
SPEAKER_01: like I just on they've been there so I trust their word yeah I mean I should because they've done it they know the level they know they say they're they're ready and they should know their numbers in the gym or whatever they they're based that off of they should know what they're talking about so Travis says he's ready I'm gonna take his word that he's ready but he knows what he's doing whether or not he has he can be trained with nobodies if he says I'm ready then I
SPEAKER_01: okay he should know himself by now enough to know what that means you know what I mean so I'll take his word for it same way as I would take John's word for those guys like they say they're ready give them a match you know they've proven themselves time and time again so but I still think Travis might lose but I'll I'll see uh when I talk to him Todd Hutchings Krasimir right-handed that's a hook match for sure yeah yeah but yeah I mean what's Hutchings record against Bulgarians like three no and he's first to the West
SPEAKER_00: I got 80-20 Hutchings on now. 80-20? But Kratzy, oh, sorry, Kratzy, he's been doing really well lately, hasn't he? He beat Lachlan 4-2 at King of the Table. He beat John Brzenk, I think, 3-0. Both names that Todd Hutchings beat as well. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. I think Todd runs away. I agree.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, I like Krazy. Krazy's a great puller, but that's another level. And I think Todd's been leveling up too, especially with his little top roll thing he's been doing last year or so, his little ugly wrist back. So I think I'll go with Todd too, although I feel like this might be a little closer than people think. I'll still favor Todd. In my mind, 70-30 Todd.
SPEAKER_00: but i think it's even a little bit closer like crassi has the move to make todd work i think because todd's hook is you know almost through his pronator this way a lot of the times like sometimes he's here but todd's not a really big bicep guy like a lot of the time he's dragging sideways if crassi applies enough down pressure into todd's arm that might cause problems i don't know i still think todd wins uh but i think it's like 60 40.
SPEAKER_01: Okay. Todd's a man. Oh, this one's in Istanbul, as I say. He doesn't have to travel. You know what week that is? I guess 231, right? Yeah, it doesn't say on that poster. I would imagine the 105. Yeah, 231. Okay. Prove naked in Rockley. Right-handed. Jay. Jay.
SPEAKER_03: Well. It's not a lighter weight, too. It's not a heavy weight. I mean, I favor Prudnik in the match, but I like Arachne. I'd be pulling for Arachne, but I think Prudnik would be better. Gotcha. Paul, what do you think? I'm not giving any numbers, but I like Prudnik, so I'm going to say Prudnik. Derek, you don't have to say. We already know what your opinions with Prudnik are.
SPEAKER_01: Who's Bridget pulling for? Who's Bridget pulling for? That's the question. I'll say...
SPEAKER_01: Prudnik is, in my eyes, more well-rounded. I think he has more options than Rockley. He won't be super heavy Prudnik. And so I think that will even things out for Rockley a bit. Rockley's been looking super impressive. But I do think Prudnik will have enough tools in his bag to come out on top. So I'm favoring Prudnik to win this match. It's a 231, though, right? That's also 105? Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: uh no it's uh 95. oh it's it's not 105 it's it's 95. yeah i could be wrong but uh iraqli is the champ at 95. because he just beat sasho he dropped down and wait yeah oh yeah so devin gets down there starts arm wrestling all these guys yeah 95. yeah so i'm going for nick and um 55 45.
SPEAKER_01: I think it could be close. I think Iroquois is young, getting stronger and stronger, looking more and more impressive. But Kurnick's going to be too polished, in my opinion. The lighter the weight goes, the closer that match is, in my view.
SPEAKER_00: yeah at uh east versus west two i actually i recorded them after pulling and they pulled twice and once prudnik was able to set the hook and pin him and once iraqli was gonna top roll him and uh pin him so i really think it's 50 50. like i that was yeah two years ago but i don't think that that has changed at all like both guys have gotten lighter for it so i don't think either guy is going to be much stronger than they were
SPEAKER_01: I could be wrong, but I have it 50-50. I'm not rooting for anyone in that. I just want to see a really close 3-2 match. It's exciting to watch. Two people in the chat are saying it's 105. Oh, it's 105. That favors Prudnik a little more. Yeah, I agree. It puts a bigger gap, in my opinion, if it's at 105. So yeah, heavy Prudnik for me. And then last one,
SPEAKER_01: Right-handed, Morozov and Vitalii Laletin. Shane, who wins this? Vitalii. Vitalii rolls him out. Right-handed. Right-handed. Right-handed. Yeah. All right, you seem pretty confident on that one. All right. 70-30. 70-30. Paul, what do you think? I'm going Morozov. You think he'll snatch him up? Because he likes to hook right-handed mostly. Thank you.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I'm going Morozov as well. I think that he's going to be able to come around, catch him, and drag him back. Like, Morozov lost his last match against Georgie, but he was super sick. Like, I was there in the hotel with him, and he was, like, walking around like this and eating soup and, like, looking extremely depleted. So him losing, I didn't really take a lot away from. And that's not to take a win away from Georgie. He's looked great. But, like, don't get it twisted. Artem Morozov, right-handed, might be the strongest hook puller in the world.
SPEAKER_00: I think that that's probably the case. Vitalii's awesome with his low hand, but I think that Morozov's going to catch it low and drag it back. 60-40. Or 55-45. You think he's going to catch Vitalii right here? Yes. I do. I do. I mean, he's long. He's like 6'5". He's not a little dude. He'll have some length on there, but Vitalii's going to have more height. They're pulling left-handed first, right?
SPEAKER_01: No, left-handed? No, no, no, wait. No, left-handed is Vitalii and Camille. Yeah, and that's King of the Table. That's King of the Table. King of the Table, okay. A month after, so that match shouldn't affect this. Man, I've seen, like I said, there was a Machysheko video of him pulling Vitalii and slowing him down in that hook and the straps and, like, really making Vitalii have to work. It was a close match. Machysheko is an artist at sinking that hook. I think even better than Morozov in terms of sinking in the hook.
SPEAKER_01: But, man, if it goes inside, I think, obviously, Morozov wins. But over rounds with endurance, and Vitalii cracks it. The only time you see it. Yeah. Dude. And I think Vitalii's something to prove right now. I think he's on the warpath a little bit.
SPEAKER_01: But Morozov also is on the comeback. Oh, man, this is really close. It's really hard to predict. I'm going to go with my boy Vitalii, 55-45. But I think he'll take that risk and wear it down over time. Because Vitalii does have a good amount of side pressure, especially after he's taken that risk. I think he'll be able to wedge it over enough to get Morozov out of it. Yeah, I think. Once that hand goes, though, it just compounds after that over the round. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: yeah but the good thing about morozov like going into that is when his hand goes he can still press through he's not super hand reliant so i mean he felt okay in the hook i mean i got in there with him i was feeling about a little bit yeah and you had him redlining eric yeah for sure 100 i was able to slip i was able to slip i mean it's a long time ago and stuff but i was able to get away from more love fully opening my hand and doing this i got away from me that means something
SPEAKER_00: Aren't you supposed to pick the guys that beat you? Aren't you supposed to pick the guys that beat you to win? That way you look better? I took that match at like a week notice. And it was what, a year and a half ago? Two years ago? Oh, we lost Paul. Oh, why is it like this? Alright, well, I don't know if Paul's come back or not, but it is 5-10.
SPEAKER_01: We've been going for about an hour and five minutes. Chat, you guys have any crazy questions you want to throw in there right now? Moderators, while you guys are in here, please take this opportunity to share more of the links to the Challenger Series, King of the Table, and the Core Sports League. It's the Core Sports League and thechallengerseries.com. Let people know where they can find all these pay-per-views and find these matches that are coming up. It is June 1st.
SPEAKER_01: King of the Table. It is June 15th, Challenger Series. And then it is July 6th, East vs. West in Istanbul. That is the date, you guys. Oh, wait. Paul's back. So, we lost our first date, Paul. But we're starting to close things up here a little bit. Do you guys have any last comments you guys want to say or anything you guys want to point out? No, I don't think so. David y'all talk about the...
SPEAKER_03: Who is it that Hunter's pulling, that Swedish national champion? Patrick Berg, no, we didn't talk about the Challenger Series, but we can talk about that match if you want. I was just curious what y'all's opinion. Yeah, that's my boy. I mean, we already know that y'all know I'm going to beat Carl, so we ain't even got to discuss that.
SPEAKER_00: you know how bad do you think hunter's gonna beat the the swedish national champion i guess i think it's close i mean obviously hunter's your teammate he's your boy yeah you're gonna be rooting for him and thinking he's gonna crush patrick but patrick berg is not only the swedish national champ but he's been he's been around a long time he's been on arm wars um he had a match against coach ray and they had like dog fights inside and ray is no slouch um like
SPEAKER_00: Patrick is not the top of the European guys, but this is a really big test for Hunter because, you know, over in Europe, they're a lot more used to speed, I would say, than we are here. Like in the U.S., we're a bit slower than they are in Europe. So Hunter's speed probably is not going to catch Patrick super off guard, and it's going to turn into who's stronger. And then we'll really find out kind of where Hunter stands. But I really think it's a good match. I mean, obviously, that's why I said it, but I really think it is. It is a good match. It really is.
SPEAKER_03: I'm looking forward to it. Who's going to win, Chance? It's 50-50. Hunter. He said Hunter. Oh, okay. Every match is 50-50. I don't know about Patrick. All right, Shane. I'll put $20 on Patrick right now. $20? Yeah. That's cheaper than buying your dinner. So, yeah, we'll do $20. All right. There you go. $20 bet. I don't know anything about Patrick. I'm just going to take the opposite side of this. All you have to know is who he's pulling, and you know he's going to lose. So, I mean, it's not a –
SPEAKER_02: What do you think about that match, Paul? You think Hunter's going to beat Patrick? I don't really, like, I've heard about Hunter, but I've been so out of the mix, just concentrating on my own stuff, that I haven't really gotten to see him compete as much as I would like to. But I've heard that he's a stud and he's killing it. So hats off to him, and I wish him the best of luck.
SPEAKER_02: On the other side of it, I have known Patrick for a while, and I've seen him compete. And I know, just like Chance said, he's been in the mix for a long time, and he's a well-decorated athlete. So, yeah, it's definitely going to be a test for him. Like I said, I wish Hunter the best because he's up in cover and he's doing great. But we'll definitely see.
SPEAKER_01: I'm not picking anybody, and I just wish you the best of luck against Patrick. But, yeah, we'll see where he stands at the end of the day, though. All right. A couple questions popped in the chat. I want to get through these just real fast. Real quick, you guys, who wins, Prudnik or Reno Messick? Assuming right-handed. Give me the winners right now. Chance. Prudnik. Prudnik. Prudnik. Prudnik. Prudnik.
SPEAKER_01: I agree. I think Brunic wins. Second question, is it true Derek is a sacrificial lamb for Travis? No. This is what it is, guys. We're all walking through this forest, right? We see this cave that's dark. We don't know what's in there. We haven't explored this cave. I'm the one taking the flashlight, so I'll go check this out, guys. We'll see what's inside here. That's what I'm doing. I'm being the one that's going to check out the cave, the dark cave that could be crazy. I'm going to go check it out. I'm not a sacrificial lamb, all right? I'm just the man with the balls to check it out and see what's going on, see what's cracking. All right, guys, so let's have questions.
SPEAKER_01: Thank you guys for hanging out. Chance, Shane, Paul Talbot, you guys, thanks for hanging out here on the podcast. Love to have you guys back sometime. Hopefully, Paul and Joyce, we get to meet Chance and Paul at some point. I just appreciate the invite to the chat. Shane, we're going to have you on here.
SPEAKER_01: We will be having next Friday, same time as what we're going to aim for, guys. Team West. We'll probably find some other people as well and talk more about arm wrestling.
