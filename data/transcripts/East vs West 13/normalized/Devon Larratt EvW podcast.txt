SPEAKER_00: Hello, Damon. Like this? Or like this? No, opposite way. Yeah, that way, yeah. This way? No. This way? Yeah. Okay. Looking good, looking good. You got a nice hoodie on there. I'm not used to seeing it. Yeah, I'm copying from you, you know. Yeah. Man, where's my hoodie? Where did I leave my hoodie at? There's no hoodie anymore. I gotta go find my hoodie. Oh, come on.
SPEAKER_03: Come on. Engin's wearing a hoodie today. Listen, you gave your hoodie to Levon. You don't have a hoodie. Just sit down. No, no, no. I gave Levon a nice, new, clean hoodie. My dirty, rotten hoodie I still have. Jody doesn't even let me wear it anymore because it's so dirty right now. Let me see if I can find it. But why not washing it? That's the essence of its power is all the...
SPEAKER_03: But it will be new beginning, you know, new beginning. Yeah, that's not what really this thing's about. This thing is about, you know, better. You want to see how this, this is really messy right now. Like it's messy and got like, look like that. No, it looks clean. Yeah. I think so too. Because, because the color is light, you know, like bright, you know? Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: I feel cleaner when I have it on. I feel like nothing can get at me. It's like my bacterial shield. Oh, okay. Yeah. Anyway, so how is everything? You are now relaxed mode, finally? Yes, I'm feeling really good. It's all part of the process.
SPEAKER_03: I stepped on a scale yesterday. I was 250, two five zero pounds. You are like 114, 113 and a half kilo. Yeah. Yeah. And, uh, I'll tell you like, uh, I, uh, I'm still, I think I'm still maybe
SPEAKER_03: know where I'm gonna land exactly but once once I land at the weight then I'm gonna kind of start to figure out what the next steps are but I don't want to rush the process I'm I'm changing some things up I'm working both arms again yeah bracelets
SPEAKER_03: No more party arm. It's back. It's back in the mix. And I'm just looking forward to kind of settling down and really looking at these divisions, really looking at the heavyweight, the light heavyweight divisions, figuring out exactly who's who. And I'm going to pick them off one by one. I'm going to clean the division. That's the plan. I'm going to clean those divisions. You will? Dadecan is thinking that you are scared of him.
SPEAKER_03: daddy can't that's all i gotta say daddy can't you know daddy can reminds me of a kid who had his blanket taken away you know he's all right all the time he always looks like he wants to fight um
SPEAKER_03: I don't know. I thought him and Babkin were perfect together, but I heard he lost his manager and Babkin. So I don't know if that's going to make him more angry or less angry, but the guy, the guy, his time is coming. His time is coming. Yeah. Same with all these young studs. Okay. Mati Shanko, Jordan Sanev, Michael Todd.
SPEAKER_03: Man, how old is Reno Masick? I think 20 or something. I need to arm wrestle him like right away. Before, I don't want to arm wrestle him when he's 22. I want to arm wrestle him like immediately. Immediately.
SPEAKER_03: I can't wait. I'm really excited to do it. I just need to do it right. I need to settle. I need to, I need to make sure everything's good. And as soon as I'm good, I'll be back. You want to feel ready before you start again. I need to absorb, you know, it's, it's interesting. Uh, and, and I'm so happy. Look at like, obviously I wanted to win that match, you know, round one, round one.
SPEAKER_03: I can tell you 95, 98% of the people said it was over. I had great hopes. I had great hopes. But the thing is, you know, I look at that match and it's such a gift to me to get to face, to be across the table, to get to fight, you know, number one guy, to be beaten. It's a great thing, you know, to be beaten.
SPEAKER_03: Really beaten like I mean people think oh, it's just an arm wrestling match and that's not what it is for me It's it's not that it's like, you know, you put everything into something Mm-hmm, and then you're beat and then you're beaten Mm-hmm, and everything gets taken away from you and you look if you feel like you lose everything and
SPEAKER_03: It's beautiful to have to overcome that. It's beautiful to have to absorb that and heal from it. And it's like you have to reassess everything. And it's like a purification of sorts. And I like the process. It's really why you do sport, I think. It's to win. To win is great. But the process of losing, as terrible as it is,
SPEAKER_03: As long as you can stick around, it's normally good. It's normally good. So I'm going through that process right now where I just got my ass kicked, you know, and, uh, um, I'm licking my wounds and getting better. And, uh, when I come back, I'll be, I'll be enriched from the experience. I'll be, I'll be better. I think than I was in the, in the, in the light, heavy and the heavy and those divisions, you know, I'm going to take all this experience now and bring it down.
SPEAKER_00: And I'll be pulling like 20-year-olds and 22-year-olds, guys I've never faced. It'll be really exciting. Yeah. David you hear about the hip problem of Dennis? I did. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I talked with Hermes, and Hermes told me, like, I don't see any, like, nothing to be proud of.
SPEAKER_00: to win against an opponent who is not really, like, ready and wants to pull, you understand? Like, who doesn't want to pull, you know? And I think Hermes, I respect him for this, the way, because some other people would complain, but he didn't complain about it.
SPEAKER_00: And he said that he would like to beat Dennis when Dennis says he's ready, you know. And so I hope they are looking for a replacement match. And, yeah, a good replacement match. Maybe more interested than Ermes versus Dennis when Dennis is not really ready.
SPEAKER_03: it's it's interesting you know before we move on to that replacement match you know you talk about ermys you talk about dennis i would like to see dennis i everybody wants to see dennis arm wrestle yeah and everybody kind of remembers dennis as being world champion yeah you know and for me
SPEAKER_03: i really don't care if if dennis is the world champion or not i i just want to see him arm wrestle yeah yeah for me like uh i'll just if dennis is arm wrestling i always want to watch it i don't care if he's going against levon or not and
SPEAKER_03: And I hope that we can somehow shape it so that he's kind of content to, I don't even want to see him pull armies when he gets back. I don't, I would like to see him. I would like to see him just pull. And I don't want to see him pull LeVon. I want, I just want to see him arm wrestle, you know, a little, maybe a little bit less pressure, maybe a little bit less pressure. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: jeremy brown is asking devon what do you think about alex versus hermes before you answer this i would like to say that hermes first of all he said he doesn't want to pull someone who is not prepared like in 18 days before the match the hermes is not anybody you know armies remember remember what happened when you stepped in
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. So, Hermes wants to pull. I talked with Hermes. Hermes still wants to pull with Denis. He will wait a couple of months and then Denis will come and he wants to pull him. He said he's prepared for it. And he sees this match as a qualification to pull Levan again. So, he doesn't want to pull someone who is not ready and he doesn't want to...
SPEAKER_00: keeps dennis much he wants to pull dennis you know this is this is what i am from i'm gonna i'm gonna throw my two cents in ermy's switch your site switch it i don't think it's gonna happen that's what i think yeah i mean i'm not yet information dennis wants to pull dennis wants to pull okay i understand you want to pull i i get it i get it yeah
SPEAKER_00: I get it. I get it. He wants to pull. But from what I understand, and I could be totally wrong, but is Dennis having surgery? We will see. Right. If there is a surgery, then the match cannot happen in two months. But I think there is a hope without the surgery. And I think that that is what they are waiting for. Yeah. David you see the July cards?
SPEAKER_03: we just did a review we just posted it oh you made a video i came downstairs i slept in this morning i came downstairs and uh a friend of mine matt oliver and uh auden they're they're here they're they're training this morning yeah yeah yeah yeah and uh i i come down i'm like did you guys see the card
SPEAKER_03: And they're like, no, we haven't seen it. I'm like, you want to do a video? And we're like, we took 15 minutes. That's incredible. And it is not, it is not complete yet. You know, it's not completed yet. It could be complete. And I think everybody's happy. It's crazy. Like for me, look at the whole card is stacked. Really? For me, the return of Travis Bajan. That's, that's awesome. How do you see that match? I talked with, I talked with Travis. I will tell you, I will tell you what he wrote to me.
SPEAKER_00: I offer him a match. He says, he says, one second, whatever you think is best, I am in and preparing for everyone. And then the everyone part is with big letters, you know. So it doesn't mean that he's ready for everyone, but he's prepared for everyone. It means that he's targeting, you know, something more than money.
SPEAKER_03: know i love to hear that that makes me so happy to hear it uh for me travis bajan is one of the greatest arm wrestlers that's ever lived for me uh i spent most of my career fighting with travis uh one way or another right hand left hand uh i feel like i learned a lot from travis i feel like
SPEAKER_00: when Travis is doing it for the right reasons, incredible. Truly. He wasn't ready, and then he just came to, I think it was 2016, he beat Jerry, Dave Chaffee, and all of them. I think that's the best I've ever seen him, actually. Just after his father died. Oh, yeah. And what I'm just saying is, if he wants, he can become very dangerous.
SPEAKER_03: That's it. That's it. He just has to decide. And I think we've all been waiting for him to decide. I think there's been a lot of times in the past where Travis has done things like halfway or for financial reasons, you know, that that's what I feel. But if his heart returns and I don't know, this time it feels like something's different. It just does. I feel like it's different this time. And, you know, to step into East versus West,
SPEAKER_03: there's no joke it's no joke you know you you you you could to come for a payday at east versus west it's not it's not even a smart decision so to me what it mean is he's coming to fight and he's coming to uh to make another run at it and uh what do you think about kalinshenko kalinshenko is not a job you know it's not the shallow end version of it
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, this is, this is not, um, this is not an easy first match, Sergey Kalinichenko. We were talking about it this morning. So the way I see Sergey Kalinichenko.
SPEAKER_03: 115 K division. Absolutely. Right at the very top. Like he'd be a problem for anybody at one. Yes, for sure. For sure. You put him in against anybody. It's a good match and he can maybe win 115 kg division. Now you take him and make him into a super heavyweight. Probably not, probably not top five, but he's going to, but he's knocking the door on top 10, you know?
SPEAKER_03: Yes. I agree. And he's really good. And this is a guy who's overcome so much, right? Broke his arm in Nemirov. He's back, right? Do you remember that match with Arif? He broke his finger. And he continued, yeah. And he won. David you see his stories? He's already talking shit.
SPEAKER_00: I love this guy. I love this guy. I said, did you see that? And he said, I hope he also knows how to handle. Oh, it's going to be good. Yeah, it's going to be fire because Travis is going to talk tons of shit as well, you know.
SPEAKER_03: is so good it's so good to have travis wanting to come back and fight uh sergey kalinchenko is a perfect he's a perfect first opponent for him it's not easy it's not easy travis is not guaranteed to win this match in any way i think it's gonna be favorite or you think close go ahead look here
SPEAKER_00: at least top roll him chan show top roll him but i don't think they were the the biggest version that he faced the face arif i think when he faced arif he was in a different level yeah i agree i remember when i walked into the hotel and i saw him i'm like sergey oh my god like he was he was huge uh oh yeah oh yeah yeah but but
SPEAKER_03: but not if he comes in halfway, like, you know, yeah, he's got to, there's no, there's no, there's no halfway. There is no halfway. He's, he has got to come in training seriously, waking up in the morning, thinking about Sergey Kalinichenko.
SPEAKER_03: eating all throughout the day thinking doing that towel rap he does all day when he's getting serious wrapping his hand up and flexing you know that's the travis that there's gonna have to be right now that he is talking i think he's gonna motivate drivers even more yeah yeah i'm so excited i really hope that he comes back in uh in the form that we're used to you know nobody is the same
SPEAKER_03: You know, like we cannot expect Travis Bajan to be the 28-year-old, 32-year-old Travis Bajan that we remember. But this guy, world champion. He's been on the shelf for a little bit. He's had a rest period, but I don't think that Travis ever really fully put it away. No, I don't think so. Yeah. There is a super chat, enlarged pronator. Will we see the old fired up Travis or a new calmer version?
SPEAKER_03: what do you guys think which one do you think we will see fired up man i think i think we are gonna see travis latch onto this match i think that he's gonna talk starting real soon i think that the hype between these two the thing is it's a great match and this is the base of the whole thing
SPEAKER_03: Sergey Kalinichenko, like when I, and when I'm like, who's going to win this match, I'll tell you, Travis better come in and drill him three times because if he doesn't, Sergey's going to pick them apart. You know, they're, they're going to get tied together. If that, the longer those matches go, the more it shifts. So of course it does. And, and even
SPEAKER_00: Like, Sergey's top end is great. This is a difficult match. It's a difficult match. Listen, Travis is a showman. Yeah. He's a showman, and he likes to do that. And he knows what to expect. He has been there as a commentator many times. And I'm sure that he is coming there to make a statement, you know, to win that match and talk and tell people to stand up, tell me that I am the greatest. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: that's what we want to see right that's what i want to see yeah uh jeremy browning is asking one second does devon what is alex chance against level today
SPEAKER_03: right now i think that levon stands alone that's what i believe yeah i believe it's it's it's crazy to me um you know how good is levon how good is he in my opinion he's the best arm wrestler that we've ever seen and i think it's by a little bit as well like i don't think
SPEAKER_03: I don't think it's close. I think that Levon is a heavy favorite against anyone. That's what I think. Right now, I think that Alex has a chance in the future. And I think that Vitalii Laletin has a chance in the future. And quite honestly, maybe even Rivas.
SPEAKER_03: but you have to be a big tall guy with an incredible hand incredible hand even just to open the conversation just just just to be in the conversation um yeah yeah levon is a very special guy in our sport very special yeah sam is asking how many states of trading cars are sold one for one event are you are you gonna get share percentage my friend
SPEAKER_00: Once it was $150, how many now? Pretty expensive there. I mean, if you find it pretty expensive, my friend, I mean, I don't think anybody is forcing you to buy. Devon, let's talk about King of the Table. Yeah. Yeah, King of the Table. Right now, we have matches because we have time to talk about East versus West. Yeah. King of the Table. Let's talk.
SPEAKER_00: like you made videos but the school boy versus uh ryan bowen we know the school boy had the top match with uh leonidas and i asked him you know he said normally it's like the leonidas but okay in english is leonidas so and ryan bowen around the same times or a little bit earlier he lost against rambas and so how do you see this match i i think i saw that you say ryan
SPEAKER_03: No, I don't think I said that. I said it's an incredible match. I said it's a very close match. I think that it's most likely that Schoolboy wins. That's my opinion. However, I think that Ryan is actually looking really good. His lifts are going very, very well. I think he has a great style against Schoolboy. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: but I think that Schoolboy has got to still be a slight favorite. And I'm not talking about a big favorite. I'm talking about a slight favorite. I put it like 55-45, so close. I think that – but I don't know. The more I think about it, I just don't know. Ryan is really – here's the real problem for me.
SPEAKER_03: I've been watching Schoolboy for many years, and I can't help but see that there's been a style change. I can't help but see this. Like, he used to always arm wrestle knuckles up, you know, swing out top roll. If things weren't perfect, he'd still stay up top and kind of fight. Yeah, he was more like this way. Now he's moving this, this, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: yeah i see this okay and i can't help but think that you know in his skiing action something there's been a slight injury his style he's super strong in there okay but but his style is vulnerable to someone who can who can top roll him and just like leonidas did leonidas had an incredible performance but i feel like
SPEAKER_03: I'm just curious, is there a problem with his wrist? Is there? Because if there is, if there's any kind of issue there, then it starts to get very interesting for Ryan, right?
SPEAKER_03: Yes. And he's got the flop too. And that's the thing. So that's why I really think school boy is going to win because I think that even still he's going to flop him. The way I think it's going to go is school boys, school boy with normal moves. Eventually Ryan gets one with a top and then he switches to flop and Ryan doesn't have the answer.
SPEAKER_03: I don't think Ryan will have the answer for the flop, but I don't think it's going to start that way. I think that they're going to start off more conventional, both of them. Schoolboy will win the first couple, potentially turn it around, but then on the next turnaround, the flop risk will not be solvable. This is my opinion on the match. Great match. Nick Holmes is asking you, what does Devin think about Levan versus him at 115 kilos?
SPEAKER_03: You would murder him, right? I'll stop. Levan, so no, no, no, no, no. I don't even like to think about that. You know, I want to be clear. I want to be very clear with everybody. The super heavyweight division, that's the crown. This whole like weight category thing, I love it. I love it. But let's never, ever impose a pound for pound. You have to diet down for Levan. Levan is a super heavyweight world champion.
SPEAKER_00: If I could be the super heavyweight world champion, I would never die. And another one, Jeremy Browning and family, Devon, you should try Brian Shaw's dumbbell grip gauntlet and have him try your formation lift on your upcoming video. It's crazy to see both.
SPEAKER_03: I'm really looking forward to it. Brian and I have been talking and we have loose plans. I don't have a plane ticket yet, but everything looks good for the beginning of June. I think the first week of June, I'm going to go down to Colorado and train with them if everything is still going according to plan. I should do a reaction video for the people at the table. Yeah, I want to do a lot of things. It's June 1st, so you need to be there very early.
SPEAKER_03: I don't think it's going to work. I think he's got an event that weekend. And then I come. Yeah. So we won't be able to watch that. I know that would be perfect. Right. But what I'll do is I'll probably pick out a couple of matches to watch with him. Yeah. Later. Later. Yeah. Yeah. I was thinking about actually watching that match, the schoolboy Leonidas match and reviewing it with because I think that that's a good one for him to watch.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah. Because I think that a lot of these guys, like a lot of the strong men, a lot of the guys coming in that guys like Brian Shaw, if they see Leonidas and they see what Leonidas did, they're like, okay, Leonidas did that. I can do that too. You know? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, so let's talk about Revas versus Di Zerano.
SPEAKER_00: And what do you think about Rewaz? Rewaz, two days ago, I had a video chat with that group, with Gennady, Rewaz, there was some other guys like Jambul Viblyani, as you remember as Roman Sindilyani. And Rewaz, they told me he was 170 kilos. It's awesome. Yeah. Every time I see Rewaz, he's eating. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, so, and I don't know.
SPEAKER_00: listen i will feel really bad for the guy who's losing this match two giants two super fighters guys yeah i mean and then one will have to lose in like the same of the many other matches that i'm watching like i wish i mean they wouldn't lose but that is the reality one needs to lose you know how do you see that i think i think that these two names levis litidzi and georgie bezirnoff
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I think that these two are the two most underrated Oh, oh you still good you still got me yeah, I lost you for a second, but you're still good. Yeah Okay. Um, yeah, I think that I think that these two guys are the two most underrated like
SPEAKER_03: So Georgie Zhirinov to me is just so freaking strong. Like, I feel like you just look at this, you see the strength everywhere, all around. He can go inside. Rivas, same kind of thing. Mostly top roll with Rivas, mostly outside. I think that Rivas comes out, comes out strong at the beginning. I think that, I think, I think Georgie Zhirinov is going to stop that match. I think he is. You got to guess him out.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe. Maybe. George Zirinov has a lot of turnaround matches. Thank you, Rebbit. Somebody says, I don't think Devin is ever going to face Super Heavyweight again. I don't think so. We'll see. They will come back. No pressure. No pressure. No, John Doe, will Devin ever paint his walls?
SPEAKER_00: the walls have been patched it's time to paint high cooker green will look nice in the living room thanks again i should probably do that i should probably do that i should probably paint we we uh who knows who knows what my house is going to look like and then josh says hey devin curious during round one versus levan do you think if you didn't try to
SPEAKER_00: hang on for so long in the stretch out position you would have had more gas in the tank later on um there's not really a lot of
SPEAKER_03: you know, it's, it's hard to have that mentality where you're going to be like consciously like giving up positions. You know, this is not really a mindset that you can kind of jump in between. So, so easily. Um, yeah, I, uh, it's never really in my plan to like back off or like to go easy and save myself. Uh, I, I,
SPEAKER_03: And I mean, look, if there was one category that I was hoping that I was going to have on LeVon, it would be the ability to out endure him. So for me to like kind of go easy to save myself, to like be fresh, was kind of counter to what my plan was. Look, the only thing that could have maybe saved me is...
SPEAKER_00: is if we had no break arm fouls, no Kings move fouls. That could have maybe done something, but. Yeah, I think I'm losing you again. Artem you there, Devon? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yes. How about now let's talk about Pauline versus Lachlan. Beautiful match.
SPEAKER_03: think nice man very close very close um i do i don't know if my coverage is that good here i might have to change where i am um yeah i i think that
SPEAKER_00: This one's going to come down to conditioning. I think it's going to be inside. I think both guys are going to get their wrist. And I think that it's going to be very close. Very, very close match. Yeah. I'm pulling more explosive. Yeah. And then if he catch, you know, Lachlan out of angle, then it would be in his favor in a close tight lock match, maybe.
SPEAKER_03: I tend to think that Lachlan is a slight favorite. I tend to think slight favorite for Lachlan, but not by much. I think that Lachlan is maybe just a little bit bigger. And I think that they're very similar arm wrestlers, really quite similar.
SPEAKER_03: Um, but I, I, I tend to think that Lachlan is maybe just naturally a tiny bit larger human being than Paul Lynn. So that, that might be the only difference we'll see maybe a little bit more like they have a slightly different style.
SPEAKER_03: But I think that their base style is the same. I think that they came into the sport kind of pulling the same way. And I see Lachlan diversifying a lot more. And I see Paul Lynn still kind of just really refining his base style. I see it moving towards Lachlan if there's a closeness.
SPEAKER_03: It's a great match. It's a great match and one that I think is going to be very close. Okay, there is Wade Mishrev. We really love to see Devin compete in heavyweight category. Who does Devin think is the right opponent in that category? Well, when I think of the 115, like that kind of vicinity, like 105, 115, the names that jump out at me as being the very best...
SPEAKER_03: Who is the guy from Bulgaria that's not allowed to arm wrestle right now?
SPEAKER_03: Jordan Sanev. Obviously, left hand and maybe right as well, Alizan. The young killer, Reno Masek. That guy, he's on his way. He's young, he's all ready. I think he versus Ibragim Sagov would be good too, the shoulder pressure guy. Also, Petro Marharint.
SPEAKER_03: Yes, yes. Tons of great matches. And the thing is, in 19, you know, hard to track a guy like that. Like, he's here, he's here, he's... Where is he? It's hard to say. The return of Michael Todd is promising, you know? Okay, let's make Michael Todd versus Lars. Who is winning there? This is the fourth match. After this, we have three more matches. Yeah, yeah. By the way, what do you think about your title should be...
SPEAKER_00: Stripped. It should be stripped. It should be stripped. Yeah, of course. I've been away too long. I've been away too long. Let somebody else listen. You are not having vacation either. I mean, you have been battling. Just let's go with the right harmony. Prudnik, and then Sandris, and then Gennady, and then Dave Sheffy, and then Hermes, and then Dennis, and then George Svetko, and Lavan Saginashvili.
SPEAKER_00: mean these these are incredibly high level matches and you have been after prudnik one you i mean especially after sundry's one all of them were uh super heavyweight matches so you are not really like you know okay i'm ignoring this category it is not like that and there was no challenger the only challenge came right now david daddy
SPEAKER_03: But I think you are exhausted. You need to rest mentally, physically. Yeah, I do. And it's only fair. To me, it is only fair that when you look at... If I was like, yeah, I'll get right back in there and compete. Okay. Hold on. Let it be for the title. But because I'm taking a small step back, don't think I'm not going to be back. But...
SPEAKER_03: I'm taking a small step back. It's only fair. If it says you are over, you cannot come back even to heavyweight. They say that you are over, you are finished. Good, good. That makes me happy to hear that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll probably, you know, it's a wave, right, Engin? Life is a wave, okay? Yes, yes. I had a high... It's more exciting when you fall down and get up, you know. I was way up there. I was way up there. Yeah, you were, you were, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: everything crumbles crumbles crumbles and it happens oh yeah not really like like you you just lost one match against someone that i mean nobody can beat you know but but but inside inside you have to let it all fall apart you know you want me to tell you something interesting yes tell me
SPEAKER_03: After every loss, I hate, you know, look, I don't ever really think so much about hating to lose. I mostly think about how much I love to win. You know, I love to win, but I really, really, it really hurts me when I lose. Like, it really hurts, you know? Especially when you won so much, and I don't think you ever won it.
SPEAKER_03: to beat anyone as much as the last one. I think it was the most important one. That victory would have been so sweet. So, so sweet. And I lost, right? And that process for me, I have to go through it. I have to go through this process of loss. And in my mind, I never want to...
SPEAKER_03: I never want to, especially when I'm hurting, especially when I'm beaten, I do not like to walk down a similar path. I don't want to do things that I feel like are work or hard on my soul. When my soul is broken, I want to be nice to my soul.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, that's time to recover, you know? Yeah, and the interesting thing
SPEAKER_03: In times like this. I always ask myself. What is it that you want to do? What is that you wanted? What will make you happy? What will make you excited? What excites you because if something doesn't excite you you should never do it. You shouldn't do it and This is very consistent for me after a big loss. I Normally start my training just with table time only only table and
SPEAKER_03: And it still, it makes me very, very happy to go on our mission.
SPEAKER_00: It's here that I will rebuild. I will rebuild myself on the table. I won't rebuild myself in the gym. You're going back to the roots, like the base of everything where it started. And I think arm wrestling for you is the same as having breakfast every day or, I don't know, sleeping or something in arm wrestling. I remember you and I, we did an interview.
SPEAKER_03: in istanbul 2012 and you said you will always arm wrestle until you die doesn't matter if you are competitive or not you know yeah right yeah that's the way i feel about it i think that you know i i have to understand very clearly that uh if i don't love it i shouldn't do it and i do love arm wrestling very much and uh you know and i have to return to that
SPEAKER_03: Every time I have to return to why am I doing it? Why do I love it? And for me to go and practice with the clubs, I love to do that. I love to do it. And this is what will rebuild me. I get by everything. You're right. You are not a racehorse. You know, you just need to do, um, whenever you feel ready, mentally, physically, spiritually, you know, Stevie guy is asking, do you frequently train inside hook right now?
SPEAKER_03: sometimes i i train inside hook uh against pressers um and if i know that i have a pressing flopping opponent i'll train hook yeah um better to control the pronator than just giving what they want once you over place you are on your brachioradialis and then yeah and i have a theory again i have a theory tell me
SPEAKER_03: So I'd say probably about, so what is it, 2024? So I'd say five years ago, five years ago, around five years ago, was kind of around the end of an era. And it's, you know how in arm wrestling, there's many techniques, okay? But I feel like there's kind of three base techniques.
SPEAKER_00: like there's there's versions of yeah yeah right there's there's pop rolling there's hooking and there's pressing okay i thought you meant inside outside outside inside and press you said yeah okay yeah that makes sense i mean yeah yeah yeah yeah
SPEAKER_03: And I feel like all these styles have, like, kind of counters, right? And I feel like, you know, there was an era when the Kings move was very dominant. And I think it was about, like, it came to kind of an end about five years ago. About five years ago. Like, it's still, obviously, it's a move. But this outside, extreme outside was, like, it's like the arm wrestling world had to adjust to it. Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_00: And I feel like right now we're in the era of the press, especially the floppers press. People say that they have a voice like they don't hear, but I hear you very well. I don't know why other people don't hear. Do you hear me very well?
SPEAKER_03: for me it's good but uh okay well let me just move around and maybe it'll be better people can update me as i go but do you hear me well totally perfect okay but people are i think they're saying that it's me
SPEAKER_03: I don't know, somebody says an engine is there or something, whatever. Anyway, so... Okay, so what's the point now? You are saying that... So I'm saying that I think that we moved to, like, an era... Like, I see right now, like, and I've seen it, like, the past couple of years, like, the past maybe, like, three years...
SPEAKER_00: Like, a lot of big matches getting won in a press, in a flop. Okay, how about now? For me it's fine, you know, for me it's fine.
SPEAKER_00: By the way, before you start, before I missilky-wilky, thank you for your generous superchat. Devon, what is your opinion on training in fail-safes for certain pulling styles for someone like Alan, who seems adaptable but hasn't maybe found his own concrete style? How much does general strength
SPEAKER_03: i don't know i think i understand i think i understand what he's saying um and i think that that's you know do you focus in on a certain style and become a specialist or do you stay more you know unspecialized and kind of arm wrestle all over the place and that'll even flow into just general strength and like just general conditioning and the balance there and i i think that uh
SPEAKER_03: It's very important, especially for young athletes, to kind of just be healthy and functional and strong everywhere. I think that has a lot to do with your base.
SPEAKER_03: but I think everything works together you know you have to train arm wrestling if you want to be an arm wrestler you got an arm wrestle I think if you want to be an overall athlete you have to be healthy everywhere and strong everywhere it's easier to build you know an incredible sword with a whole lot of metal there's a little bit of metal you want to have a lot of metal and that's that's your general conditioning but okay what I'm saying is right now we're in the era of the press
SPEAKER_03: Look at all the matches that are being won in a flop or a press.
SPEAKER_03: Not all the matches. No, not all, but I think right now there's a lot. There's a lot that are being won. Like, I see a lot of wins where I'm a little bit surprised with the flop. I think the flop... Yeah, but wasn't there, like, sometimes, like, Daniel Prokopchuk was doing that a lot, and Jerry Calderon has been doing it for, like, 30 years. And, yeah, now Kamil is there.
SPEAKER_03: uh ibrahim sago is there um lars has been doing that like for yeah yeah i just i don't know i i see that it's it's just because i feel like i don't know there's a flow and i feel like certain styles kind of rise in prominence and i don't know i think that what happened was wal influenced arm wrestling world arm wrestling league and wal made the king's move more powerful
SPEAKER_03: because of the extra two inches and then and then with the return of east versus west it brought it more into balance but a lot of people were still doing a lot of outside arm wrestling and it opened up that flop lane that that that pressing lane a lot and now i think that the next phase is going to be the hook i think we're going to see a return of hook arm wrestling
SPEAKER_00: I will tell you something. My own theory is that, not the theory, but I really believe what I say, it is easier to hook in lighter classes
SPEAKER_00: than in super heavy weights because when you gain weight build all the muscle to arms and everything all that back pressure gets in the crazy numbers i don't think hand gets henry's gets powerful parallel to this general horsepower you understand like the hand is just i mean when you are 100 kilo or 120 kilo the increase of the this hand wrist i mean not super
SPEAKER_00: Like when you put so much muscle, you do incredible ways that the hand in super heavyweight is kind of harder to cup. Just if you look at it, there are not so many guys that like Gennady goes inside, but you can top roll him. I mean, there are not so many incredible hook puller in super heavyweight when like, like, I mean, most of them goes outside.
SPEAKER_00: Morozov is probably the only
SPEAKER_00: exception right now right now just look at let's look at uh levan outside you outside hermes outside reva's outside jerry we cannot say really cup you know because it's not hook and then yeah yeah yeah you're right and even even dennis siplenko outside you know just in the super heavyweight it is
SPEAKER_00: very very hard to control the the the arm pressure because it's too much and the hand doesn't get as powerful like parallel to uh that okay so um so so you are saying the hook is coming i can say that just even even 95 kilo like i i'm curious like how many people can hook iraq i just think look i just think that we all try and be well-rounded arm wrestlers right
SPEAKER_00: we all try yeah right but we need to have a like a very like i always had a theory that like arsene lily may have a very good hook but he will never beat rustam baba inside rustam can top roll very well i have seen him but he's not gonna topple uh arsene so over here in the east people usually choose one perfect way but after now with the east versus west people are like there is no way that
SPEAKER_00: We need to do a lot of things, you know. And so I kind of see the era is more of well-rounded people. In the past, like John Bursink, he could do everything. We were saying, like, look at this guy. When you know Pushkar, he was going, boom. When you go Ferit, he was going mostly right here. When you take Rustem, hook. Oleg, hook. Arsene, side pressure outside. Travis outside. Now look at, I mean, look at Prudnik.
SPEAKER_00: look at even david and he went he beat the hutchings in inside you know and and like many of those guys sasho he toppled ravision he toppled john in the later rounds like i mean i i see now people are becoming more or well-rounded i agree i agree but but i'll say that so you're well-rounded
SPEAKER_03: I'll say that there was a big rise in outside arm wrestling. And now I think a lot of people are really seeing the press. And I think that the last one to come up is going to be the hook. And I think that people are going to start to realize if the hook is important. I hope so.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I just hope that everyone except me would be going inside. I would love that. Right? No, no, no. It's only for the people who flop. It's only for the pressers. No, no, no. Right? Because we know, right? Top roll destroys hook. If you have a hooker, oh, feed him to a top roller. Right? Right? So it's the three-way thing, right? Yeah. I will tell you something. If I would ever pull Samushia...
SPEAKER_00: Like top rolling his wrist would be my least concern. Controlling his pronator because you take his wrist, he's like, oh, finally, I don't have pressure on my pronator. And he beats you like this. So you need to really make his palm up, you know. Yeah. It is great to talk with you about arm wrestlers. That's why. Yeah, go ahead. So who is the number one left-handed arm wrestler out there? In open category?
SPEAKER_00: Listen, I will tell you something. Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Morozov is the proven one. But a lot of people think that Laletin is the actual best one. But they haven't met yet. And now Matushenko is pulling Morozov, heavyweight champion against super heavyweight champion. And I know next year Levan is making his comeback. And there is Kamil Jablonski. I tell you my opinion that, like,
SPEAKER_00: Laletin's chance against Morozov and Ali Can is really good because they need their cup. While I think Morozov and Ali Can is bad matchup for Kamil Jablonski and I think Kamil is bad match for Laletin because he is only like it is very very hard to control and handle or defend the fans do defense against
SPEAKER_00: uh, communist pressure on, on, like, I don't know how many people can handle that pressure on their break radio. It's very hard. Super hard. I feel like there's five names. But one thing, when you say like super hard, you sound like, you know, like someone who is experienced about it. What, with the, oh, with Camille? Yeah. Yeah. It's crazy. I tell you. You know, like, um,
SPEAKER_03: He's the Jerry Catarat. He's better than Jerry. That's the thing. He's better than Jerry because he actually does have other moves. He does. But I tell you, that press is smoking. It is smoking. It is smoking. I feel like there's five names and then one over on the side. Actually, maybe two. Maybe two. Tell us. Okay, so Morozov is the king.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah. Morozov is the king according to ranking or according to your judgment? We have to say he's the guy, right? Everybody is going after him. He is the guy. He's got the title. And he's defended it a bunch of times. Okay. So he's the number one. Okay. Okay. I think Vitalii Laletin beats him. I understand. I think Alizan beats Vitalii.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, no, sorry, sorry. Not Alizan. Camille. Camille. Camille will beat Vitalii. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I think Camille will beat Vitalii. And then I think Alizan and Morozov and even Matushenko.
SPEAKER_03: Anyone who is controlling Kamil's pronator is beating him. This is what you are saying. Yeah. So there's five names. Okay. I think that Vitalii and Morozov are the two tops. Okay. But he will lose. Artem you saying that Vitalii is...
SPEAKER_00: um everyone is underdog against vitale and vitale is underdog against coming i think yes like i think how much how much would you bet on camille against vitale yes
SPEAKER_03: But I think that Vitalii is the best in the division. I do. I think Vitalii is the best. I just think it's going to be very problematic. I think Vitalii is just... I haven't seen it. I haven't seen it. I need to see it. I think that Kamil is going to be a problem. I think he's going to be a big, big problem for him. I think that Morozov will beat Kamil. I think that Ali Zan. I think that Machyshenko...
SPEAKER_03: I think that they will beat them.
SPEAKER_00: But I think that he's made to give Ali problems. People say Tobias versus Kamil match and Tobias versus Vitalii match. But Tobias versus Vitalii is hand versus hand match. Who knows? Tobias may have more horsepower compared to Vitalii. We don't know that. But if you lose your hand, it doesn't help. If Kamil would attack Vitalii's hand,
SPEAKER_03: I mean, Italy would just murder him, you know, if he would attack outside, you know. Super interesting. Yeah, yeah. And just to add, the other name that's over on the side, just over here just a little bit, that might just destroy everybody, probably not might, there's a real good chance. Who? Can you guess? Levan? Of course. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course, yeah. But I will tell you something.
SPEAKER_00: Levan versus Kamil also. Yeah. Dangerous. Like when Levan gets healthy. You know better than I do. But whenever this guy puts the shoulder pressure and if his hand is flat. The amount of the pressure. Like whenever. I know I'm resting. It looks very scary. The pressure to down. It looks very, very scary. You know. And Kamil has been.
SPEAKER_00: uh provoking vitale he's sending him messages he's training or something and kamis says that he's ignoring me he says he's ignoring me and he doesn't he doesn't vitale doesn't write anything back you know and i don't know it's a problem like i mean i mean like listen i i i hope like somehow don't eat this king of the table sets this match and then we will have the all the answers
SPEAKER_00: It's a big problem. It's a big problem. It's the most dangerous match. Most dangerous match for Vitalii. And it would be a very risky match while Vitalii is going for a title. Right. I know that this is planned for fall. Vitalii versus whoever wins, Matushenko or Morozov. But if this match happens earlier, Vitalii may not get that title match. That's the thing.
SPEAKER_03: Like, if Vitalii's smart, he won't pull Kamil. Yeah. Do you know what would be best? He would pull the winner of Matushenko and Morozov and then let Kamil to pass them and come to him. Exactly. That would be smart. Because I don't think Kamil can. I don't think there's a whole bunch of people that I think can beat Kamil. But if he can get a shot of Vitalii,
SPEAKER_00: That's a problem. That's a big problem. I kind of believe that if I would try with two hands, and if Kamen puts the shoulder behind, he would open my biceps, both biceps, like easily. You know, this is what I see, you know. And there is still people saying, is it worse to be yablonked or to be bachot or drained from Devon?
SPEAKER_00: Which is the easiest way to lose, in your opinion, Engin? Evgeny if you know what to do, you have no power to change the outcome. I mean, the worst one is Drain from Devon because when this guy stops you, he starts talking with you. He just takes your soul. He doesn't only pin you. He really makes you and leaves you broken. So the worst nightmare, I remember one time I was talking with Hermes. I said, Hermes,
SPEAKER_00: Can you imagine how it would be to be stopped by Devin? He was like, oh, no, terrible. And at that time, he was thinking he was going to beat Devin. And then actually that match happened, you know. And Bruce Foslian, do you remember the Zaur and Kamil practice pool after East versus West? My friend, I don't know about that, but the only thing is that I wouldn't put so much value on that.
SPEAKER_00: practice pulls you don't even know who pulled before that how many matches they pulled before that i know that kamil and um even matushenko they pulled a lot of matches before anyone else you know that's the name i forgot that's the name i forgot zaur left-handed yeah but did you say the zaur versus uh i think who did zara
SPEAKER_00: I think they have pulled, like Zaur in the past pulled Vitalii Laletin's left arm. I mean, yeah, it would be good. Hey, do you know what happened? Today, Rewaz, before the live, Greg Nikolsky, he called me, the Genadi and Rewaz's friend. He said, Rewaz wants a left-arm match. What do you think about a left-arm match between Zaur and Rewaz?
SPEAKER_03: would be good that was his left arm is very good trust me perfect perfect yeah because yeah that's a great match okay let's talk about last every match quickly michael versus lars i i don't i it's this is so i i made a video on this last night at practice it's it's quite split it's quite split um it's 115 is it 115 kilo yes
SPEAKER_03: I don't think you can, both these guys are in such good shape. Like neither one of them has any body fat. They're both, you know, very, very strong and very conditioned athletes. Michael still, you know, even though like,
SPEAKER_03: Michael had his surgery, right? And you have to think anytime you have surgery, there's a potential loss and stability. There's, there's maybe a little bit of top end weakness. Um, but when you watch Michael in the gym, he looks very good. You know, you watch him doing his lifts. He looks, looks incredible. And, um, I really enjoyed his match versus Frank Lamparelli. Really enjoyed that match. I thought that he does. Oh yeah. Hard match.
SPEAKER_03: Hard match. And, uh, you know, he, he won that match with a lot of heart, like to be able to finish in a press like that. That's not easy to do. That took a lot of commitment and a lot of desire and a great match. Great match. Great opener for him to come back off the surgery. When you come back to heavyweight category, who do you think will be waiting for you? Say that again?
SPEAKER_00: When you come back to the table again, at the heavyweight category, who will be waiting for you for the title match? Who will be holding the title when you come back? Very interesting question. Very interesting question.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah. The way I see that division, we talked at the beginning of the podcast about the names. And, you know, so, okay, let's just say you have Ivan Matyshenko, Prudnik, Georgi Svetkov. Oh, no, not Georgi Svetkov. I always... Jordan Sanev. You have...
SPEAKER_03: young reno macek who's on his way you have david daddy can michael todd is in there michael todd if michael todd is healthy and pulling well he can beat all of those names he can the one that's the most
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, he absolutely can. I think he matches up great with Matyshenko. I think he matches up great with Jordan Sanev. I think he matches up... You know, Reno Masek is very interesting, but I think he's still too young. But very interesting. I think that...
SPEAKER_03: i think that uh prudnik i see he's pulling 95 kilo isn't he no 105. that's 105 him in iraq iraq is 95 kilo champion and right now he doesn't have anyone so he's playing with the bigger guys now so that's a 105 kilo match that they're doing
SPEAKER_03: yeah okay but but but i think that it's very easy for prudnik if he wants to to be you know a filled out 115 if he wants to go after that and i think that i think that daddy can and prudnik are most likely gonna find their way to the top of that category with with michael
SPEAKER_03: that's what i think i think that michael has a very very interesting very difficult match with prudnik and here's an interesting scenario can i just throw this out but there is also oh yeah there's anger by him as well that's right yeah he's right in there also can i throw out a very interesting scenario and hunger button yes yes of course okay so i had a match
SPEAKER_03: planned with daddy camp. Yeah. Okay. Um, about two years ago or something like that, uh, geez, maybe even longer than that. Now, uh, Michael had a title shot versus Evgeny Prudnik. Yeah. He backed out. Yeah. Because of injury. I stepped in.
SPEAKER_00: yeah i had a match with david daddy can i backed out like michael but i will tell you something okay now wait you are number one in that category but you even by august you will be inactive in that category for 21 months so we will have to be failed to other athletes and we will take you
SPEAKER_00: And Prudnik's last heavyweight match is the same match. He pulled against you. So he's also 21 months in that category. So he's out. So now Matushenko is number one. Matushenko has some shoulder issue. But he will be okay. But he said he will be ready for fall with right arm. And then next is we have Sandris. But Sandris lost against Sagov. It's not even the same category, but still, you know. Reno just...
SPEAKER_00: barely won the europeans you know he's not gonna pull before the wap either so that category when you go to the next i think there is lars and so um i think your idea michael versus that that he can already deserve the shot as someone who is the champion of the one category below and so
SPEAKER_00: If Michael beats Lars or something, that kind of match can do something. Maybe that's it. Maybe the winner of that match gets a shot against Adekan. And that's a champion. Lars already set for Florida. A match he's already set. Oh yeah? Who's he pulling? Matt Mask.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, that's right. That's tough. I'll tell you, that's a tough match for Matt. Yeah, yeah. They pulled the four. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And Jerry versus Kurdesha. And I just asked John Brzenk if he would pull against Leonidas, and he said yes. And now I asked Leonidas' camp what they think. They will answer me.
SPEAKER_00: There's some incredible matches that are coming. Let's go to the last few matches and finish. Um, Ongarbe versus Petro. Ongarbe. Ongarbe. Do you know, do you know what happened? Um, what happened is that, um, Michael, oh, sorry. Petro said to, Petro said to, uh,
SPEAKER_00: be ready for the hook war. Be ready for the hook war. Do you know what the answer of the Ongarbev? He says, if you can enter the hook, we will take a look. He's a poet. He's a poet. Yeah. Very good. Yeah. Jim Carras. Can you say to Devon,
SPEAKER_00: Much love from Greece. Yeah. What's up, Greece? Okay, so you are saying Ongarbev is going to beat Petro. Do you know what? Devon, I can't tell you, like I can't explain to you how bad I feel to make these matchups. I know they all have the dreams, you know, and like I know how they prepare. To me, they are all like mountains.
SPEAKER_00: Mountains doesn't matter. I mean, you can only imagine maybe, but for me, it doesn't really matter. They're all mountains. And to see one of them will leave that stage, bending his head, it just hurts me, understand? I wish, but that's the nature of it, you know? So what's- That's how it is. Yeah. Engin, thank you so much for doing this. You know, like our message has never been like this. Yeah. Everybody on that stage is,
SPEAKER_03: A champion, a big champion. Yeah, yeah. Can I ask something, Devin? Have you ever seen any better reality check than East vs. West stage? No, not in the sport of arm wrestling. Not in the sport of arm wrestling, yeah. Not in the sport of arm wrestling, no. And that's why it's so interesting for me, Travis's return.
SPEAKER_03: and that he's that he's choosing he could he could go back anywhere if travis wanted to just make money he could hang around north america he could pull exhibition matches he could make money the the east versus west stage is you get you're gonna lose there's a real good chance everybody who shows up on the stage is this is this is the top okay so let's go morozov versus matushenko i don't want to take so much time of your it's like one hour and 11 minutes
SPEAKER_00: you know i can talk with you three hours five hours six hours you will be sleeping but um matushenko versus morozov matushenko you can expect anything this guy actually hooked and beat vitality in two rounds i know it's incredible best hook arm wrestler on the planet
SPEAKER_03: And I would say that, and I would have said the same answer for probably the last 10 or 15 years. Like, whenever I think who has the most crisp hook, it's been that way for a long time. Ivan Matyshenko, incredible. Incredible ability to hook. Incredible. But I think that Morozov's going to win. Because of more horsepower and endurance?
SPEAKER_03: yeah and i think that he's not a guy who runs from the hook either like i don't think he's got a problem in a hook yeah but but if it wasn't best of seven but if it was best of three matschenko's chance would be more interesting better better if it was only one round it could be even 50 50 in your opinion uh yeah it's closer i just think that look at morzoff is really good like
SPEAKER_03: remember when he had that stomach issue and he came in and he lost against uh georgie svetkov yeah um i i don't think that that's normally what will happen i think that i think that uh i think that that is a very good very technical very healthy well-rounded guy with a ton of horsepower um i think he's he's gonna be very difficult to beat and this is this is for the number one left-hand
SPEAKER_03: It's an open division. For Matushenko to win this, that's incredible. That's incredible. If Matushenko wins, we're going to have a 250-pound guy as the number one guy in the open division. That's incredible. It's not impossible. It's not impossible. I just think he's the favorite. And I give it like a 60, 65, 40, 35, something like that.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Anyway, so we will see you coming to Istanbul for the East vs. West 13. Oh, I thought it was going to be a secret, but yes, I'm going to show up. Yeah, but the question, do you think that we may see you in the commentating room a little bit? Yeah, yeah, for sure. I'm going to be taking it easy, so yeah, I can jump on the mic for a bit. Look, I'm excited about all the matches, so it's easy for me to talk about. Yeah, I'd do it.
SPEAKER_00: yeah okay yeah yeah who am i going to be with what who will i be with who will i be co-commentating with uh probably neil and and maybe some matches after his match with travis maybe be great that'd be hilarious yeah very good very good yeah yeah i can't wait yeah and the press conference i just can't wait especially sergey kalnishenko and travis sir he
SPEAKER_00: doesn't give a shit he already started i saw his stories he says like i i shared his post this morning he you did you did yeah yeah and then yeah as i said trevor said that i mean i hope this guy
SPEAKER_03: knows how to take it as much as he gives it you know and looks like he's gonna also fire back you know it's serious it's serious travis was the king travis was the best and he was the best at talking and backing it up i'll tell you travis's charisma when he was at his top
SPEAKER_03: was was something i've never seen before i remember like you know way back like two remember at the do you remember at the um niagara falls event what was that 2001 or two or three or something 2002 end of 2002 when you beat him yeah yeah that was the first that's the first day i ever met travis and i was like who is this maniac i'm like
SPEAKER_03: where did this guy come from i'm like he is completely out of control i'm like the whole room everyone in the whole room is watching this guy he's completely on he's completely unhinged you know if he can get back to that level of uh of savagery well he's gonna give a lesson to a lot of these new era arm wrestlers but the thing is is the sport has changed yeah
SPEAKER_03: Evgeny since 2016, when I think that was Travis' last peak. I know he's still been arm wrestling, but I haven't seen a version of Travis that I recognize as the real champion that he is since 2016. So this is eight years later. Eight years have passed. You know, and... You know what will be interesting? Yeah. Right now, you are like...
SPEAKER_00: everest of trash talking and mind games when when he is physically ready and when you come back and finally when you guys will be opponents to each other on that stage oh it's inevitable right house it's cows you know it's just it is inevitable it's inevitable are you ready for that mental war
SPEAKER_03: Look, I think that the way it'll go is I'm going to take some time. I will return. I will clean out and dominate the heavyweight division and the light heavyweight. Travis will ascend. Travis will come back. And then I'll tell you, it's going to be tough for Travis.
SPEAKER_03: It's not like he's pulling Dave Chafee in the finals. It's not like that. There are 10 guys that would annihilate Dave Chafee in 2016 that are ahead of him waiting. We'll see how far Travis can climb. It will be difficult. The challenge is greater. It is greater.
SPEAKER_03: But for certain, even just for legacy sake, even just for old times, I would be very sure that Travis and I have another meeting. Yes, and that will be, I mean, highest level. Like, whenever you consider everything.
SPEAKER_03: That guy never shuts up. You can't even get a word in with that guy. He just blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I'll have to present the paper. I'll have to just do a video reply because I can't do a live. The guy fucking never shuts up. Yeah, but what are you going to do on the press conference? I'll just fight him. I'll just fight him. I'll throw a chair at him. So that will be two challenges for you. One at the table, one outside of the table.
SPEAKER_00: It's exciting, exciting times. And thank you so much for all you do. I thank you. And then just get the rest. Just, you know, when you plant to field all the time, it doesn't give you good production anymore, right? It doesn't give you the good vegetable because you're planting, planting, planting. You need to leave it and rest. I don't know how you call in English. And then.
SPEAKER_00: Then after the rest, everything is more useful. I'll still be productive. I'll make this time count. Yeah. Yeah. Just get the rest. Yeah. And then be back. Thank you very much, Devon. Thank you very much. I can't wait to see you in July event. And we have the king of the table. Good days. Good days waiting for us. Yeah. Thank you, Engin. Take care. And thanks to everyone who has been watching us. Later, buddy.
SPEAKER_00: Thank you, Brian. Thank you, guys. Thank you. And guys, some of you are asking why Vitalii Laletin and Morozov pulling right arm. I mean, there is no rule that these guys can arm us with right arm, especially if Morozov is pulling a left arm supermatch in June. Why would I set him another supermatch a month later? You know, just please, a little bit logic before, you know, just writing things like that.
SPEAKER_00: And it doesn't mean that they are not going to pull this year. That match or, I mean, whoever is winning before that match, they will pull eventually, you know. So no need to really, like, you will have, you will have. As far as I know, there is no replacement match because this match is postponed. It's not cancelled. And he wants to, Hermes wants to pull Dennis and Dennis wants to get ready.
SPEAKER_00: and pull i mean if he still cannot be ready and then then maybe maybe uh hermes can pull someone else later but right now he wants to pull him this summer or something we are just waiting and also i don't think it is fair to anyone to put against hermes like 17 days
SPEAKER_00: or 18 days before the event while Hermes is fully ready. And we will just tell someone, okay, you're not ready, we'll just pull Hermes, you know. I don't think it is fair either, you know. It may be replacement, someone who can be quickly ready, like Georgi Svetko. He rests usually, if he's training well, he only rests like one week, five days, six days, and then he's ready to pull. But...
SPEAKER_00: I know that he is still injured from his ankle. He's getting better. I talked with him. No swelling anymore. Everything is fine. And so that's all, guys. Thank you, guys, for watching. I need to do things right now.
SPEAKER_00: Alex said he's ready and he wants to pull Hermes. Interesting. Whenever I asked Alex if he would want to pull Vitalii Laletin, he said he went to training and his wrist doesn't feel good and he doesn't want to pull because his wrist is not good. Now he says he wants to pull Hermes. That's interesting, I think. Maybe one day his wrist will heal up.
SPEAKER_00: That's interesting. That's very interesting. Anyways, so maybe La Laletin is a bad matchup for Alex. That's why, probably. I don't know. Anyways, guys, you all take care of yourself and see you guys again. Thank you. Thank you.
