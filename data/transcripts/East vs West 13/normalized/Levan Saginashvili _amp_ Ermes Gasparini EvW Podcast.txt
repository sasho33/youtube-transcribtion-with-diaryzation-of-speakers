The sport is growing and that's a definite that we know and that's the main thing.
SPEAKER_00: and people are asking me about georgie swedco i talk i i reach him out every day every day every day and he's getting better and better and better there is no risk of becoming amputee or something this is what he told me and yeah he said that every day he is feeling better and

SPEAKER_00: I didn't know that it could be that risky, but obviously it was. I said, like, why you don't inform me, you know? And he said, like, you know, I didn't want to cancel the match or something. Hello, Levan. Hello, hello. Hello, champion. How are you?
SPEAKER_00: good good good my friend i'm happy for you that you are national hero every day yeah in georgia every day you you are welcomed by and honored by different people you know and it makes us uh feel good you know one minute
SPEAKER_03: So now you're resting, huh, Levan? No resting. You're training? No, every day TV. Oh, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: That's good. That is the good part. Good part, you know. Today I've been in Minister of Sport, Georgia. And every day some. Yeah. Is it only like unofficial people or the official people from government also meet you? Official. Official. Official. What did you say? Who met you today? You said?
SPEAKER_00: The Ministry of... He welcomed you today? Yes. Oh, that's good, you know, that's good. I'm happy that this happened, you know, this is how it should be in every country. Like, it doesn't matter if it is Ermes or David Samushia or Devon, you know, when they are best, when they go home, you know, they should be honored, you know, by their country, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I like it. Anyway, so.
SPEAKER_00: I think Hermes is going to join us a little bit late. He was training and he will also, whenever I said this live and some people in the chat room, oh, why Levan and Hermes? Why Levan and Hermes? They were like, they get excited, you know, like there is a match happening or something, which is not planned. Maybe, maybe.
SPEAKER_00: No, not maybe it should happen sooner or late, but there is nothing about it. You know, we just wanted to chat together yesterday. I think yesterday or day before, I think yesterday it was, John was my guest and I talked with him and I will try to, um, I don't know, have some podcasts just, just for fun, not always for an upcoming match, you know?
SPEAKER_00: But Levan, when you see Hermes training with Kirill Sarcev, did you see the video I told him to get out? And he said it was too strong, he couldn't get out. And then one week before, I saw Denis training with him and Denis was able to take his wrist, you know. And...
SPEAKER_00: Kirill is not arm master. One week ago when he trains he cannot recover. Evgeny day before he did some after pulls even with right arm as well. So what do you think?
SPEAKER_01: Yes, but it's not like that, because Kirill was born in the year of Teletani. He was born in the year of Teletani. He was born in the year of Teletani. He was born in the year of Teletani. He was born in the year of Teletani. He was born in the year of Teletani.
SPEAKER_04: Actually, I think that Ermes took Kirill's wrist without any issues. The thing was that Kirill was just following his hand with his whole body. That's why the wrist itself didn't bend. But if he tried even to stand the ground, his wrist would have been gone right away. Yeah, but whenever I told him not to go sideways, but just take this way, he said it was too strong. I don't know.
SPEAKER_04: Maybe. Yeah, I saw that he was just following the whole body just to be careful. Kirill was being careful there. Actually, I saw Gennady and Ermes discuss this, and Gennady also said that the way you went, you should have gone a slightly different way if you wanted to take his wrist.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I don't know. Normally, if I wanted to take only the risk, I can do this. I don't have to do this. But I mean, he said that his hand was strong, whatever, you know. So do you think that in the future, he may he may be strong, he may become an armwrestler? Mimolšek, what do you say? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
SPEAKER_01: There is no competition with professional players in any way, but in terms of competition, I think, for example, with Leonidas, I mean, I've been playing with him for a long time, I've been playing with him for a long time, I've been playing with him for a long time, I've been playing with him for a long time, I've been playing with him for a long time, I've been playing with him for a long time, I've been playing with him for a long time, I've been playing with him for a long time,
SPEAKER_04: I think that would be really great for the sport if Kirill started to arm wrestle seriously. I think if he trains and considers a match, it would be great to see maybe with Leonidas or anybody else who is just beginning their path. Probably it's a bit early to be meeting with the professional arm wrestlers yet.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, I agree with you. There is no such thing as a top 10 in the world of sports. It will be interesting to see. But I'm not sure, because I haven't been to Egypt, and I haven't been to Georgia, and I haven't been to Georgia, and I haven't been to Georgia, and I haven't been to Georgia, and I haven't been to Georgia, and I haven't been to Georgia, and I haven't been to Georgia,
SPEAKER_04: It could be very interesting to see his match maybe with someone definitely not in the top 10. But we have to consider that he has not participated in any tournaments, so he's just training and he doesn't have enough experience yet.
SPEAKER_04: So probably it will take some time for him to gain the confidence and the experience. But overall it would be very interesting to see.
SPEAKER_01: If you go to some tournaments, tournaments where you can meet other people, there are very good opportunities, for example, to go to a tournament, or to participate in something, for example, to participate in a tournament, there are very good opportunities, for example, to participate in something, for example, to participate in something,
SPEAKER_04: He thinks that for him, the best advice would be now to take part in some tournament, any tournament, maybe in Russia, just to try his hand with different types and styles of opponents, gain some experience that way. And after that, it would be interesting to see the Supermatch. I have a question, Tony. Artem you able to see the chat? No, but I will open it right up. Yeah. Can you translate this Superchat?
SPEAKER_00: my guy hello guys hello hello hello hermes are you seeing me or not i don't see you only yours your your voice come we don't see you no no i see i see ah come on leon thank you okay who are you my friend good good
SPEAKER_00: He was talking about you. That how next time he will not even... You still love me or only... Yes, I still love you. Every day. Oh, thank you so much. Now I'm more happy.
SPEAKER_00: okay there's the super chat there's this interesting i will read in english and then let tourniquet explain to you the catabolic t-rex levan would you rather fight 100 barbie doll sized hermes or one hermes sized barbie doll barbie like a doll toy you know you know barbie
SPEAKER_04: 100 Barbie doll-sized Hermeses, that would be crazy. They would just beat me up.
SPEAKER_00: Okay. Thank you for your super chat. Who do you think wins? Thanks for being great ambassadors of the sport engine. Thank you very much. You know, this is one of five category. And what do you think that when Devon loses 17 kilo,
SPEAKER_00: So both have agreed to the match, it's set? Yeah. And you know, you know, David has very strong hands. It's very, very hard to, like, Tatashins couldn't even go strap with him, you know. So when Devon loses all that weight, do you think that there may be a problem for him? Because he also beat Hutchings inside hook.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, losing 15 kg would be too much, even visually it would be scary.
SPEAKER_04: Considering how tall Devin is, 105 is very little weight for him. This is a very risky decision. I don't know how much strength will remain after that. I think too much.
SPEAKER_02: I think he can use a king move, maybe he can win. Only that's possible, but do you think that... About arm power, for sure that he can be more powerful. In that category, in that category. Maybe they can use a king move like when he fought with Sputnik.
SPEAKER_01: If you look at it from the point of view of the 15-kilogram scale, you can see that it weighs about 10 kilograms. If you look at it from the point of view of the 15-kilogram scale, you can see that it weighs about 10 kilograms. If you look at it from the point of view of the 15-kilogram scale, you can see that it weighs about 10 kilograms.
SPEAKER_04: Considering that he can lose the weight by a water cut or a crazy diet just for the weight in and he's 105, maybe two, three days later he can be 110, 112, something like that. Yeah, so the next day he can be maybe 110 and it's a risky but very interesting decision by him.
SPEAKER_00: So, does Dadikyan have a chance to win? Of course, of course he does. Okay, there is another super chat. GB19, will Lewand not lose a round, left arm too?
SPEAKER_04: It's hard to say. I haven't competed with the left for a long time. But the last time I lost on left was in 2015 with Gyorgy Tverkov. After that, or even before, I haven't lost.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, but the another thing is that when he said last time, last five years, he didn't compete. Yeah. Yeah. After round two, why Lewand got a bit angry with Lasha? They are asking. Shaw text is asking. I don't know why Lasha immediately got angry. Lasha didn't get angry. Everyone got angry because Ramudan and Damiani were fighting each other. They were fighting each other.
SPEAKER_04: I wasn't angry on Lasha. I was just telling my whole team to shut up because everybody was talking to me at the same time. And I just couldn't understand. Yeah, it's difficult. Maybe one or two people, no more.
SPEAKER_01: I would like to thank everyone, and I would like to thank all the people who participated in this event. I think that one or two people are the maximum number of people, because if there are four or five people in one room, it is not enough. It is very important, and this is a very important moment, because we are living in a very difficult situation.
SPEAKER_01: I'm very thankful to my team. Everybody wanted me to win and they only had good intentions, but I agree one or two person in the corner is a better option.
SPEAKER_00: When four or five people are talking at the same time, I just got distracted and angry, didn't know who to listen to. So that was my only complaint. There is an enlarged, enlarged pronator. Congratulations to Levan on his fantastic show of strength. But beware of the gladiator in the future. Thanks Engin for all you do.
SPEAKER_00: you very much and large tornado uh ermus should this guy be careful like he needs to be careful about the italian gladiator i don't know who he's talking about but maybe maybe he's talking about thomas monkey oh no okay and then student hakob janian
SPEAKER_01: Could Levan have beaten Devin round one without press? Could Levan have beaten Devin round one without press? Could Levan have beaten Devin round one without press?
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, probably. I think I could have won without the press. It would have taken much longer. Maybe something like it went on the left hand with Levin. Same way, but it would have taken a longer time.
SPEAKER_01: The way this goes, maybe they will ask in the future to win the match even without pulling his arm. So it's just a crazy experiment. But what was it? But what was it?
SPEAKER_04: Before the match Sam said that I couldn't press, that was my weakness, but now I showed that I can press and now this complaint, so I don't know what to do.
SPEAKER_00: no no i don't think they are complaining i think they are curious if he if he could still win i kind of felt like his arm wasn't moving he was just holding relax i i even his face was not strained you know he was just like looking like this he just didn't have the the wrist control that's what i saw there is model is asking you will aramis pull jerry cadaret again
SPEAKER_00: i'm not gonna read next time you know um do you like would you again pull against him yes easy money easy money listen jerry wants to pull against you there's no point
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah, no problem. Jerry will just waste his time traveling. Baba, what if the guy only tries to topple Jerry Levan? Then it may be a problem? Like just say Laleh Hint versus Jerry? Do you think there's a problem?
SPEAKER_01: This is the main reason for me to go to Jeristan, because it is an elementary problem that there is a lot of competition, there is a lot of competition, there is a lot of competition, and people are going to fight with their triceps all the time.
SPEAKER_04: In that case, nobody can have a good chance. Anybody who tries to go with only top roll, everybody will have a problem with Jerry, especially the person who presses with the whole body. There's just no point in going on the top roll.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah. I'm happy that Lewand doesn't underestimate Jerry like some people underestimate, you know. Because if you want to beat Jerry, you know you need to follow the different way. If you go your way just because he's giving you a risk, oh, okay, I take the risk. That's all he wants, you know. Anyways, he wants you to take the risk. Yeah, but I think without a start like this,
SPEAKER_02: if you go top roll maybe you can climb climb climb after this you need press for sure we know it is not impossible we know it's not impossible but it is it may be harder oh more a lot because if you have a three three four match like this is a lot
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, his endurance is very good. If he gets engaged in the match, his endurance is also very good. There is Rato. There is a super chat. Hermes, when will you show a back pressure PR 93 kilo? 95 I did today. It's not possible to turn the camera sideways, right? 95 is it? Yeah. One hour ago.
SPEAKER_00: really 95 kilo yeah oh okay then then does it mean that somebody is in trouble maybe you don't enough somebody is in trouble maybe not somebody is in trouble yes somebody's in trouble but that's not you
SPEAKER_00: No. Please, not me. Not my turn yet. Okay. You know what, Ermes? You want to pull him again, right? But trust me, he also, even he won against you, I think he also has unfinished business with you. Like, he wants my opinion. Maybe I'm wrong. If I'm wrong, tell me, Levan.
SPEAKER_00: But he wants to pull again and beat you, but not like last time. For sure, he want to beat me. Yeah, but not like last time. I think he wants to prove, like he wants to destroy you, that he can beat you 6-0. Am I wrong? I know. I know. I know. Interesting, Mark.
SPEAKER_01: First of all, I don't have any interest in Deon. I have an interest in Deon, but I don't have much interest in Deon. In this respect, everyone is interested in sportsmen, but I think it's a bit too much.
SPEAKER_04: To be honest, at the moment, Ermes is the most interesting opponent to me, considering the match that we had. Devin is not interesting to me anymore. Dennis can become interesting if he can beat Ermes. If not, then no. So at the moment, Ermes is the most interesting opponent for me. Yeah, I mean, sooner or later it's going to happen.
SPEAKER_01: And Levan, you did not believe that Devon will not pull you again? When he said that he's not going to pull you again? I don't trust Devon. I think he will come back. Maybe not in one or two years, but three or four, he might come back.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, Tyler, Hermes, why are your calves so big? He says, haha, strong. Why? Your calves, calves are so big. They are asking why are they so big? What is it, Kyle? Oh, you know, the lower leg, lower leg, the lower side of the leg. Like you show your forearm together, calf. Okay.
SPEAKER_00: My cows. Cows, yeah, yeah. Genetic. That's why it's so big. My father too. My father too, yeah, really. I never trained in my life, really. Yeah, but I think they, are they really big or they are small? No, no, very big. Yeah, your cows are big? Okay, okay. Yeah, yeah. Okay.
SPEAKER_00: And thorax, there, I cannot read the second part, but Levan, did your wrist feel better after stem cell? Yes, 100%. Yes. Very important, these things. And catabolic T-Rex, this is for both Levan and Ermes. What are the most overrated exercises for arm wrestling? Like people think it is important, but it is not really.
SPEAKER_01: It's all in one piece. What's in one piece that everyone likes? It's interesting. I don't know. It depends on how you look at it. It's all in one piece and everyone likes it.
SPEAKER_04: Interesting question, whatever you exercise that can be used well in the match, so I think every exercise can be good. And Hermes? Too many exercises, but...
SPEAKER_02: Some curl on the table, you know, they put the dumbbell on the table. This one, table curl. This is really shit. Some exercise of Michael Todd, I don't like too much. He push like this. Yeah, I have done those curls too. Those are just
SPEAKER_00: injury waiting to be had for me for my opinion okay john lewis is asking levant you want to see bacho versus other who wins i think it is not really good question but yeah yeah i mean i'm thinking the same way but
SPEAKER_00: I'm not joking. Evgeny if Oden goes with both his hands, Bacho will win. Yeah, yeah. I mean, but Oden needs a long time, I think. Yeah. Bacho, people don't understand, but people, he's very strong. I think on that day that Reno beat him, any other style would probably lose against him because his hand and wrist are strong, but he went, Reno went right into his bicep.
SPEAKER_00: These guys are very strong. Yeah, he has a very bright future. Levan, were you surprised when Leonidas beat Schoolboy?
SPEAKER_01: Not too much. Not too much.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, Leonidas is an exception to the rule. He's very impressive considering how large
SPEAKER_04: his muscles are and the fact that he's not a professional arm wrestler. He pulls very well. He learned very quickly. And also considering that the day before the match, he was training the shoulders together with my friend Konstantin in the gym. Yeah, really, really.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but I saw the story. What the fuck is he doing? What the fuck is he doing? Shaw the press. Together we killed the shoulders yesterday.
SPEAKER_00: There is a question, Tyler, for all. How happy were you all for Michael Todd for his win?
SPEAKER_00: I don't know. For example, I am an organizer. I'm not happy with winning. And Hermes is Italian. I don't think he was happy. No, no. Who is the strongest will win for me. But for sure I root for Paredes. And were you happy, Levan, when Michael Todd won?
SPEAKER_01: Both of them are very close to me, Frank and Michael. And they were very close to each other, and yes, Michael died and Frank died. The only thing that could have happened was that Frank died and Michael died. I think it's a good thing that Michael died at this point, and the psychological problem will be solved.
SPEAKER_04: both frank and michael are very good friends of mine so i was happy that michael won and i was sad that frank lost but even if it was the other way it would be the same i would be happy that frank won i think at the moment michael needed this victory more and was more hungry and psychologically needed the victory more so i'm happy for him yeah gb19 is asking ermis levan worked on presnaya
SPEAKER_02: Can you stop him? Because now he also trained his shoulder pressure. I don't know, but if you want to give my opinion. Yeah. A new weapon of mine.
SPEAKER_02: You can use very well pressure with some guy with a weak arm here. But if someone has very strong back pressure or biceps, it's very difficult to do this. Maybe only the final part, but still very difficult. Because he trained it.
SPEAKER_00: He tried him too if you show third or fourth match. Q. For Hermes vs Levan, Kamil vs Ali Can, they are asking our thoughts. I don't give my opinion about matches. Hermes vs Levan, they are here. I think they both believed in themselves. How about Kamil vs Ali Can?
SPEAKER_02: Who would win? Alijan. What? Alijan. For me, our favorite is Alijan. And for Hermes, Alijan? Yeah, because with Kamil, if you have a strong hook, it's difficult for him. And how about Hermes versus Levan? They are asking in Super Chat, so...
SPEAKER_00: I don't know. 50-50. 60-11. 50-50. 50-50. 60-11. Okay. Yeah. And then let's chat a little bit before the last one. Creson is asking, Hermes, are you 100% ready for Dennis? Yes, you're right, Arme.
SPEAKER_02: train everything and the power is growing up. It will be no easy match. Some people think it will be easy for me but stylistically I will be good because you know he takes the hand, the low hand.
SPEAKER_02: I think the most difficult part with him is the final part. He will stop here and I need to push him here like this, press, we will see. Do you realise that Devon didn't try to go press but he didn't want to lose? I don't know, we will see.
SPEAKER_00: It may not be easy. And Furious is asking, whose press is more dangerous, Jerry's or Kamil? Of course, this is a different arm, but which one is doing more dangerous? I think Jerry, because they have more experience. And you, Lewa? Lewa? Yes, I think Jerry, but Kamil is very strong too.
SPEAKER_01: Kamil is an athlete, you know. Jerry is like a professor in this movie. He has a question to Hermes. I love you, Jerry. I love you. Don't be angry with me, please.
SPEAKER_01: levan is asking ermis do we have a communication with dennis they are they're very quiet quiet lately nothing nothing no no i see some video right how are you good morning what you eat in the morning no no no good night i think i think this is more like you know calm before the storm
SPEAKER_01: No, there are no Z-meters, but I think there are some possibilities. It's not that I'm not in a position to say that, but it's not that I'm not in a position to say that. It's not that I'm not in a position to say that. It's not that I'm not in a position to say that. It's not that I'm not in a position to say that. It's not that I'm not in a position to say that.
SPEAKER_04: I would like Denis' camp to be more active, to be more in the conversation.
SPEAKER_04: not insulting but to be more active in the communication both ermis and dennis and i'm talking as a sports arm wrestling fan rather than a competitor i would love them to be more active in the communication and and but you were not super active either last one month
SPEAKER_01: Devin was so active the last month, he was putting out videos all the time, so I just preferred to be silent. That was my strategy.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, maybe Dennis has the same type of strategy. Evgeny though Hermes is not super active, but active, you know. John Augustine is asking, hello, guys. He is asking you, Levan, basically, if Jerry locks himself like this,
SPEAKER_00: and you cannot finish him quickly and then you got on your brachioradialis. Could he be a problem to you? Is this what... He said the armors beat him so easy, Jerry didn't have a chance to get behind his hands. If he gets behind his hands, they are asking if Jerry could give you trouble. Oh, I know.
SPEAKER_01: When you go to the gym and you don't go to the gym, you will have a problem, because it is very small. And when a person goes to the gym, there is no problem. It is possible that you don't go to the gym, but if you go to the gym, I think you will have a problem.
SPEAKER_04: Ermes was perfect in the execution with Jerry. That's the lesson for everybody, how to handle him. Yeah, for me, if I was stuck in a position, of course it would be a problem because he has a large weight and putting all his weight on my hand, it could be a problem. Maybe if I start quick and I might manage to pin him. But if it gets slow, yeah, of course it would be a problem.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, because people don't give Jerry the credit he deserves. They don't understand how strong he can be if you really allow him to do what he does. He won't be. He won't be.
SPEAKER_01: Go ahead, go ahead. He won't be with Gheorghi and Gennady, if you remember. Yeah, yeah. And one question now.
SPEAKER_04: Nobody has beaten Jerry easily, whoever tries to top roll him. Gheorghe has one of the best top rolls, Gennady has a strong shoulder, strong top roll, but both of them had a huge problem. Whoever tries to pull
SPEAKER_00: Jerry in his style, everybody will have trouble. Yeah. Tony, can you do me a favor? Can you read the second super chat? Like not the last one, but one before. Like Billy Bob said. I think my English is limited. I didn't understand what he says. Hermes, in the history of East versus West, has anyone really been far even as decided to use even go on to do look more like?
SPEAKER_04: yeah this is what does it mean it's hard to say has anyone really been far even has decided to use no i i don't understand i thought maybe something like a gold command or something but it's hard to say i mean i didn't understand either so i thought i was the only one and i don't think hermes will understand
SPEAKER_00: Neither, but I'm sorry, my friends. Thank you for your super chat. One second. Artem you going to train more with Devon because of your upcoming match with Dennis? I mean, I think Devon is in Canada, Hermes is in Italy. You planning to train with Devon before Dennis match? No, impossible. Yeah. I have only five weeks. How I can go to Canada? It's too...
SPEAKER_00: Maybe, maybe in this year, next year, I want to go to some training camp. The question, who would you want to pull first? Levan or Devon? The champion. Oh, champion. 115 kilos of weight, champion.
SPEAKER_00: Super champion. And maybe, maybe 105. Yeah. And Levan, how do you see this match, Dennis versus Hermes? To me, to me, I just talked with John yesterday. He also thinks that it is not easy match. Oh, well, he made him a focus on a whole bike never.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know if it's because of the fact that after March, tennis became a very serious sport. I don't know if it's because of the fact that it's not a serious sport, but I think it's because of the visual aspect. I don't know if it's because of the visual aspect, but I think it's because of the visual aspect. I don't know if it's because of the visual aspect.
SPEAKER_01: I'm hoping it will be a great show.
SPEAKER_04: And actually, I was hoping that after the last defeat, Denis would prepare very seriously. And looking visually at the videos that their team is putting out, I'm not seeing exactly a great improvement. Maybe he can improve his shape going forward. But today, Hermes is the favorite.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I just hope that we will have a good match. Yeah, I agree, yeah. Guys, what do you think about the recent attacks to East versus West on social media? Hermes? These people are really idiots. What's that? They are not normal people. They are very... I don't understand why.
SPEAKER_00: they need to do this. Maybe they are jealous or really, they don't understand. I mean, do you think that they cannot live without East versus West? Like they don't have a life, you know, they cannot focus on what they are doing, but they, because they cannot compete with East versus West maybe? And that is the only madras thing they can do?
SPEAKER_02: Maybe they don't think, I don't mean they don't have opportunity because other people have opportunity to compete in East versus West. No, no, no. They cannot compete with East versus West. What they are doing and what East versus West is doing, different level. So this is the best thing they can do it, that's why.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I think all the athletes, 99% of the fans, everybody are with us, with this fantastic community. I don't understand why they want to do something else, really. If you want to grow up the sport, we need to grow up together, all together. This is what I think.
SPEAKER_02: But sometimes some people have some different opinion, or they are jealous, or they are crazy, and they do these shit things. Really, sometimes it's difficult to understand these people. And what do you think, Blavan? No, it's her, but she's from anti-PRS period.
SPEAKER_01: Well, first of all, anti-PR is already a good PR. And I think that the people who are haters,
SPEAKER_01: The fact that they are hating, this means we are moving in the right direction. Yeah, I think we are moving in a good direction and those are just haters. Well, they are not bad people. I don't think they are bad people. I think they criticize me and say that I am a bad person.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know. I don't think I'm a sportsman. I don't think I'm a sportsman. I don't think I'm a sportsman. I don't think I'm a sportsman. I don't think I'm a sportsman.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, these people, they are just envy with the growth that we have, growing of the community, of the sport. If they can do better, please do whatever you can and create your own competition. But with what we do and how great we make the sport to be, that's an example and that's great for the whole community.
SPEAKER_00: So that's probably why they are doing this because they cannot compete with us with what we are doing. So like when somebody is running faster than you,
SPEAKER_00: instead of trying to run faster, you just put your foot in front of them and try to make them fall. This is what I understand, but I mean, it doesn't work. They started doing this two weeks before the East versus West to harm the reputation, harm to pay-per-view. But we broke the pay-per-view records. Everything was incredible. So I think it is a proof that majority of the community, they
SPEAKER_00: yeah that's what i think also but i don't know so they want to compete or they are competing with the what's that no no no they when i said they cannot compete what they are doing and what we are doing they cannot really you know compete against us as an organization or what they are doing so that is why they instead of working harder for the community
SPEAKER_00: they just organize people and then poison people. They sit in the mud and then they throw mud. You know, I think they don't have a life. This, this is what I realized yesterday. There was two days ago, there was East versus West qualification event. One guy,
SPEAKER_00: came from Argentina, that this guy is, he competed an event that has doping test, WAF 2022. When you compete an event that doesn't have
SPEAKER_00: doping tests and when you compete an event has a doping test you know that there is a doping test and then at least everyone needs to be clean so this guy competed there and he tested positive in master's class so he came to florida to compete this event and people said that like you are not even qualified and also you are banned you know because so using substance people says that okay
SPEAKER_00: anyone in the East versus West, we don't have that, that kind of rule. We don't have it. Hopefully we will have it, but we don't have it. So, because he couldn't compete now say, oh, they banned this guy. You know, there is another woman that competed 70 kilo took fourth place.
SPEAKER_00: And she got, I think, Pauline told me that when they announced the third place, she said, it's me. And she took the money. She took the medal. And then we said that you can only compete one category because we want everyone to
SPEAKER_00: have chance to compete different categories. You know, like everyone needs to stick one category so we can invite different people. And, but even though she took fourth place in her category, she wanted to compete in a category with Sarah Beckman and Gabriela. I mean, you took fourth place in your category, 70 kilo. You're trying to compete.
SPEAKER_00: And then we tell you that, you know, you can only compete one. The same thing happened in Istanbul last year. Sandris won two qualifications in Europe and he wanted to compete. We said in Istanbul, you can only compete one category because we want every category to have one champion so we can invite more people to the East versus West. So I don't understand. And then out of this, they started a huge drama
SPEAKER_00: you know, oh, the banning applets and this and that, you know, just like, it's just like, I mean, I need to focus on what I'm doing and this is what I will do. And these people who are doing this kind of propaganda, they are privately writing me, thinking you're doing great job, you know, we buy the paper, we support you, you know, the guy that got drunk in the East versus West.
SPEAKER_00: What was his first was six? When was it? Yeah, yeah. Anyway, so I don't remember exactly. And no, I think it was his first was four when Gennady and Gennady and Jerry pull. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, and then he's just riding me and can we make a new beginning? Like, let's make friends again and this again. And I said, you are attacking publicly. And now you're coming to me.
SPEAKER_00: privately if we did some wrong things publicly then say that you are sorry publicly not not you you don't do the wrong things publicly and then try to solve the problem and then next thing he just deleted all his messages of course i have all the copies of that but and then he goes next day and again attack you know just uh very weird people the website of uh east west
SPEAKER_02: there are some somewhat we have the rules right on some some some website no no we just we just we just clearly tell them you know you can only compete i think i think if maybe we did we see the rules written yeah
SPEAKER_00: they understand everything and they don't... Yeah, but whenever I told to Sanderis that this is the rule, he said yes and he didn't argue. And Sanderis had a chance to win two categories. This woman couldn't even win her category. She took four categories. Yeah, yeah, but it's only my opinion maybe to put in the same one.
SPEAKER_00: what you don't understand is this is not their intention this is not something to make a huge drama what do i have to do with banning people
SPEAKER_00: It's only because maybe every time you need to explain, you wish to say... Ermes, wasn't Igor Mazurenko and Asen Acitodoro for 10 years? Were they not business partners in Nepal? They were business partners for 10 years.
SPEAKER_00: And then when Assen became president, Igor was his biggest supporter to make him. And then whenever I had arguments with Assen at the Congress, Igor and Axel, who is the president now, they were always supporting and standing by Assen. And then one day they said they have a problem with Assen, and they created IFA. And now they say, oh, come to my side. Okay, whenever I had the problems, why you didn't, why you were against me, and now you have the
SPEAKER_00: Problems, you are telling me to come. I said, okay, I come to your side. What do you do? And I look at it, they created IFA. The president is the Axel, the Zlotitur announcer. And then vice president is Anna Mazurenko, Igor's wife. And then the other board member in 2019 was Kirill, which is the worker of Igor Mazurenko. So they created a federation, so-called federation to serve to Igor's business. And then whenever I look at when they did the first IFA championship, it was in Poland.
SPEAKER_00: And it was on the same date with the Zlotitur, in the same city, same date. And then they even changed the categories of IFA to make it identical in the senior category with the Zlotitur. Isn't it true? Yeah. So what I just say is that their intention was just to make an amateur federation to serve Igor's business. And these people now in America telling me,
SPEAKER_00: Engin, don't organize event in America, we don't want. I'm not going to organize an event in America because you want. Every time I organize event in Istanbul,
SPEAKER_00: The American fans, they are saying, Engin, why you organize all the time there? And I tell them, this is Istanbul. That's what I can do. They are like, organizing here too. And then now we are finally doing it. And these people, go, go, go, they are saying. And then the same people are kissing Igor's ass. And then if you are against anything that is from outside, then why are you kissing his ass? So these people, what I see, Igor Mazurenko throws them bone, and then they catch in the air, and
SPEAKER_01: I think yes. No, no, it's good.
SPEAKER_01: I think it's very important to know that America is going to win. It's all in our hands. And, of course, if we win in the World Cup, everything will be fine, because, well, it's going to be tough. That's one of the things. Besides, the studio, the audience, and us, we don't have to worry about anything.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I think you shouldn't listen to these people since the way you do this federation and this competition is very good and I support you fully. And whoever wants to be against us together, they will fail. They got nothing to do.
SPEAKER_00: Overall, the qualifications in the US, I think this is a great opportunity and it's great that they're being held. And I think it's all good for the sport. Yeah, I agree. But sometimes we need to tell people the truth, because the more you stay quiet, the more they are poisoning people.
SPEAKER_00: Like whenever they are asking why WAF is banning people, not IFA, when IFA people wanted to leave, they didn't like what WAF is. I mean, so if you didn't like it, you do something different. You continue doing it. Everyone choose their way. I tried to make peace between IFA and WAF for two months. WAF went their way, IFA went their way. Some people choose IFA, some choose...
SPEAKER_00: So why, if you choose, why you need to, like, what is wrong? I mean, if you like this side, just come this side. If you don't like it, you are the one who left. So I don't understand. And what does it have to do with me? Igor and Asen had a problem. What does it have to do with me? Some people choose Asen's side. Some people choose Igor's side, you know. So anyway, so, yeah, anyway, so let's talk about the other one.
SPEAKER_03: Morozov versus Matushenko. This is left arm? Yeah, left arm. Morozov. Morozov is training a lot, I show in the story. Shoulder press with the hook.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe yes. Favorite is Morozov. I think in the fifth round, we will see. Yeah, we will see in the first round.
SPEAKER_04: how much Matyushenko can open Morozov's arm. I think he can, but by how much we will see in the first round. Morozov is, of course, the favorite, but Matyushenko is very strong. Yeah, I think he's very dangerous.
SPEAKER_00: Mamacucinco will be arrived with 115 or more kilo? Probably more, but I don't know how much more he can be. I have no idea. Yeah. And Levan, the Desdarano versus Rewas. Oh, my pick-up row, I resume Robert Smough's Chaffees.
SPEAKER_01: there is a chance that he will come back to Zeranovo. If he comes back, if he comes back, I will definitely go to Zeranovo,
SPEAKER_01: It's hard to say. I think it will go like Revaz did with Dave Chaffee.
SPEAKER_04: If they go to strap and the match stops, then Dziranov has a good chance because his endurance is better. But I think on the start and with the speed, Rivas has higher chances. I don't think Dziranov will be able to slip.
SPEAKER_00: And I think Rivas will get him on the start right away. So he's going to beat him without allowing him to go strapped. People say that, Hermes, people say that in the chat, you need to show your biceps so we can feel better. But every time free. Free? You want money? You want money? Everybody feels good now, huh? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Anyway, so there are, there are, there is, there is also Schoolboy is going to pull Ryan Bowen, I think. They are just making some podcasts together. Do you, what do you think about that match, Levan? I don't know. You don't know? And you, Hermes? Schoolboy is Ryan Bowen. Ryan Bowen. Ryan Bowen. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Schoolboy. Schoolboy is going to win? Yeah, maybe. Is it going to be hard? Maybe Bowen can take the risk in the final part, but I think schoolboy is very good with the shoulder press. I understand, yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: anyway so there is there are some a few more matches and we can we can also uh talk like lachlan is pulling pauline at the king of the table very good fight pauline is gonna win you think yes yes 50 50 thing
SPEAKER_00: Another question to you guys. If Alezhan pulls Matushenko in 115 kilo, who is favorite Levan? I don't know, 50-50. Oh yeah, Matushenko, 50-50 Masha. Yes. And Hermes? I don't know if my life is too weak, but Alezhan is too strong. Very strong? Very strong.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know if my left is too weak, really. But I think Alessandro is too strong left. Yeah. And another question for Levan. When you are ready, what is Alessandro's chance against you with left hand?
SPEAKER_01: I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
SPEAKER_04: it's hard to hard to tell for me at the moment because i haven't even gripped up with him i haven't touched his hand um if if we take the left hand that i used to have before the injury i would definitely win nobody was beating my left hand back then
SPEAKER_02: My friend, after this match, I will never compete with the left. Maybe two years, two, three years. But really, the level is too high for me. For left-hand? Too high. Do you think you cannot beat anyone in top 10? Maybe if I started with some weaker opponent, maybe it was better for me.
SPEAKER_02: Because maybe I start immediately with the number one. I don't know. We don't know. Maybe with Zerano or another opponent, with the left, it was better. Immediately, after two years, immediately, Alessandro, maybe it was too risky. There is... Jerry Cato has sent me a message.
SPEAKER_00: I sent him the link but he didn't see. You are doing great things for this sport, my friend. I have your back with whatever you need. Also, are you okay if I call out Hermes to accept my match at Orlando?
SPEAKER_02: Okay, okay, one second, one second. I will go with the beach, summer, you know, sun, summer swimming, competition, money, everything good, bicep good. You want me to cancel your match with Morozov? For me, no problem. That is more easier.
SPEAKER_00: You are saying Jerry is more easier. Jerry, Jerry, Jerry is better. Okay, I hope Jerry is watching. I sent him the link, but he didn't see it. Anyways, guys, it has been 1 hour and 10 minutes. There is one more question, GB19. Levan, do you regret not playing John or Dennis the most? Errol? Errol.
SPEAKER_01: Both are interesting.
SPEAKER_04: But I would choose John because he is armwrestling. And you know which John I would choose? The John who beat Dennis 6-0 in... Supermatch 2019? 2009, sorry. Yeah, it was amazing. Yeah. I think the best of the best of John.
SPEAKER_00: And then it would be the first match that Levan lost in the Supermatch, yeah. Anyways. Maybe. Maybe. Levan, you are a super humble guy. You are super humble. El Toro, I have the perfect nickname for Levan. The Tweak Arms Bandit. I don't know what that means. Tweak Artem Bandit? Tweak? You know, Tornike, you know,
SPEAKER_04: Your English is better than mine. What does it mean? Tweak, you know? Tweak, maybe to adjust. Maybe the one who adjusts the best. Okay. Okay. My friend, what I showed in the last event, maybe Lewand, he don't felt
SPEAKER_02: But the first round, I felt the atmosphere. Like, you know, Manchester with Liverpool, the stadium, same, same things. Incredible, incredible. I make all the viewers and fans happy. Really, it was super.
SPEAKER_01: I think that's what we need. Uh, the, the kind of support and, uh, the fans emotions that we had in the first round, that was really great. And I think we should have more of that.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah, I agree. I never felt this atmosphere, never in my life, never in some place. I'm blushing, really. Really. Yeah, I agree. It was incredible atmosphere. Anyways, guys, Lewan, thank you for coming. And once again, congratulations, my friend. You did a great job.
SPEAKER_00: and yeah you deserve it and Devon also i think pulled great i think he did a very very good job you know and and Hermes thank you for coming my friend i i cannot congratulate you it was not yeah to participate
SPEAKER_01: I congratulate you for participation. I would like to say that Donetsk is very beautiful. Sportsmen are very beautiful every year.
SPEAKER_01: I can add that the level of athletes has grown a lot.
SPEAKER_04: Year to year, all the athletes are stronger and the competition becomes harder. I can see it in myself and in the others that we are becoming higher and higher level. This just means that I have to train more and others too. Yeah, yeah. But every fish grow it, the fans, the community, the athletes, really. We are doing very good job and you too.
SPEAKER_01: Thanks to you, Engi, for doing this. No, no, I'm not doing anything. I'm terrible. That's not what I meant. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
SPEAKER_01: And what will happen is that we will have to deal with the government and the government will not work. Therefore, I would like to say that we will not stop. There will be no pirated broadcasts, there will be only pay-per-views. And I would like to say that the people who watch these pay-per-views will not forget the people and the sportsmen.
SPEAKER_01: That's how we got involved, and that's how our pool was created. And that's how our pool was created. And that's how our pool was created. And that's how our pool was created. And that's how our pool was created. And that's how our pool was created. And that's how our pool was created. And that's how our pool was created. And that's how our pool was created. And that's how our pool was created. And that's how our pool was created. And that's how our pool was created. And that's how our pool was created. And that's how our pool was created. And that's how our pool was created. And that's how our pool was created. And that's how our pool was created. And that's how our pool was created. And that's how our pool was created. And that's how our pool was created. And that's how our pool was created. And that's how our pool was created. And that's how our pool was created. And that's how our pool was created. And
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, all of this progress is thanks to the great competitions like we have with East vs. West or the King of the Table. And this appreciation helps us to grow the sport, to grow us as the athletes. And I want to ask all the fans to support the official pay-per-view, not to support any pirate streams and
SPEAKER_00: I want them to understand that this support goes straight to the athletes, straight to the sport, and this is what makes the sport grow. Yeah, thank you, thank you, Levan, thank you. But, you know, according to the certain people, I'm doing a very bad job, and that's not good, it's versus bad, I'm bad, and...
SPEAKER_00: I mean, so what to do, you know? When we will see you at the table, Engin. Oh, I don't know. If I'm organizing these events, I think you will never see me.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe in King of the Table? Yeah, but even King of the Table, I won't have so much time. As soon as I'm organizing East versus West, we have other stands, East versus West, and then September something, King of the Table. What am I going to do? One month training, come and then pull someone short? It's very, very hard. I will do my best. But I will tell you something, guys. I so much want to arm wrestle.
SPEAKER_00: I'm 50 years old. October, I will be 50 years old. And this was not my plan. My plan was last a few years, three, four years to compete because I love arm wrestling. But just because I am organizing this East versus West, I cannot compete. You participated in...
SPEAKER_00: You participate, Engin, and we will all do the organization. We will take it. No, you guys know that. You don't even... Anyways, I don't want to say it, but yeah. But I just tried to say that I want you to understand it. I'm sacrificing my own goals, own dreams, because the dreams of athletes altogether are more important than my personal dream.
SPEAKER_00: you understand but i love arm wrestling i i whenever i see you guys i want to arm wrestle but i cannot i'm i'm weak i cannot train i'm old i'm injured you know and but if i focus like a question for you levan can you do what i do for east versus west and be successful as an arm wrestler at the same time no no no no trust me this is almost impossible you know shows liberty
SPEAKER_02: It's impossible because you need to have your mind to be focused. This level is too high to do many things together.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, very high. Yeah, it's very hard. I don't think any other athletes like Habib or McGregor can they organize the UFC, everything as I do. And then also compete and fight. You need to focus. You need to just really focus one thing, you know. You cannot do many things in that. Anyway, so Levan, thank you very much, my friend. Thank you very much. You are a great champion. And everyone agrees that you are the strongest armwrestler in the history. You are...
SPEAKER_00: the best arm master in the history in the understanding that, in my opinion, nobody could beat you.
SPEAKER_02: Don't say such things to me because I might relax and this can get up to my head. Yeah, you are the strongest in the history. You will never lose, my friend. You're too strong. Somebody wants to make you relax and beat you. Don't train too much. You're too strong to be relaxed. Don't go to the gym. Don't do too much. This is enough.
SPEAKER_00: You're right, you're right. This guy is a very sneaky guy. Don't listen to him. Anyways, guys, once again, thank you very much, Ermes. Thank you very much. And Levan, thank you very much. And Tornike, the biggest thanks goes to you because you are the god of translators. And it was very great to meet you in person. And I couldn't believe how huge you are, also how big you are.
SPEAKER_00: You saw him, right? You remember, right? His chest and everything, you know? Yeah, yeah. Artem you sure?
SPEAKER_00: yeah yeah there is one more super chat john augustine engen you are the greatest promoter and his versus us is the greatest promotion in the game right now the majority of the community and fans support you ignore the small minority of haters okay that's what i will do yeah this is we are 99.9.9
SPEAKER_00: the majority there are only 0.1 these haters but they say that they say they are 98 and we are true anyways guys no need to talk more about this haters and you all take care of yourself and see you see you next time my friends just stay healthy bye-bye
