SPEAKER_01: Hello, hello, guys.
SPEAKER_01: Hi, how are you?
SPEAKER_00: Hello, Eric. Hello, Samson. Hello, Charles. Hello, Luke, Victor. Hello, guys. Great to see you guys.
SPEAKER_00: my guests. Hello, Brainstorm. Hello, GB19. Hello, Michael. Hello, greetings to Canada. Hello, Joseph. Hello, Samsung. David you watch the Lebanese arm wrestling? What do you mean, did I watch Lebanese arm wrestling? I know some arm wrestlers from
SPEAKER_00: Who will be next for Alican Murado? Alican, I think first he will compete the Vapors in Moldova. Hello, hello, I missed the part where that is my problem. Interesting nickname, Zane Jones. Hello, my friend. Jerry versus Alex Aceh, awesome headliners.
SPEAKER_00: no doubt. Love you all. Hello. Hello, my friends. Let's see what Jerry has been doing. Okay. William says, we want Levan versus Vitalii. William wants
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, there are so many matches we want to see, but Levan is the king up there, and people need to deserve that shot. StoneGamer. Hello, my friend. Welcome. You can see the king of the table on Core Sports.
SPEAKER_00: unique for me. Okay, Big Daddy just came. Hello, Jerry. What's up, my man? How are you, my friend? Good? Good, you? Good, good, good. You want it up like this, or you want it sideways? No, no, no, no, no. The first one, yeah. Yeah, that way, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: I've got to stand. Let me figure this thing out. So you have been training. You look big, huh? No, it's probably you, David. Huge arm, huge arm. I think it's the camera. You better stay a little bit away because we won't be seeing you in the camera. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You look big, yeah. The shoulders and everything, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: and yeah yeah yeah yeah huge yeah further back or is that good i mean i i think you look good but just i'm just talking about your right hand you know just shoulder everything looks big yeah yeah yeah i bought one of those lenses makes you look bigger anyway so i i you haven't been uh active you had uh illness
SPEAKER_00: and after that you i i know you got another one you got called again as far as i remember but you have been following everything because after every event you you send me a whatsapp message you you congratulate you know yeah yeah always always throwing great events yeah thank you thank you and we miss you jeremy miss you yeah and now you're finally coming back
SPEAKER_00: And originally you were set against Vitalii Laletin in July, but it would be like when we have an event in Florida and you said, I'm the one, you know, always come over there and compete. And first time it's happening in U.S. And now why am I not there? And I was like, OK, because you are in July card, you are in. So then since Vitalii will probably...
SPEAKER_00: uh not be able to come to us um so alex kurdesha and you are set and what do you think about this match how confident are you how confident are you well you have to go into every match confident right i mean yeah if you go in thinking you're gonna lose then why enter
SPEAKER_02: um so i'm excited and i felt a lot more confident until i saw him go against georgie and then uh when he came in for georgie he's obviously he grew he got bigger stronger alex did so made me uh rethink and so now i have to put a little more effort into getting into better shape and want to come in bigger
SPEAKER_02: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. And how do you see your chances in OJ's device? Oh, no, I feel confident. I mean, unfortunately, like I said, the last time I competed was with the Hermes, and I was not healthy. You know, I had pneumonia. But so now, you know, as long as I'm healthy, I should be good to go, and I feel confident. I think it's going to be a good...
SPEAKER_00: good match um and i'm looking forward to it but i uh i'm still pretty confident um how what do you think about his recent performance you know he he he beat hermes and then he lost against dave chaffee and then he was not active for some time
SPEAKER_00: And then he came back with the left arm match against Morozov. It was a very close match with left arm. And then he has defeated Georgi. And where do you think many people believe that he is the guy who has the best hands to beat Levan? What do you think about all this?
SPEAKER_02: Well, I'd like to think I have a good shot to go against Levan. And, you know, I got to come back and prove it, right? So people can sit there and talk all the shit they want, but you got to get up on the table and prove it. So my intent is to get up on the table, prove it, and I want a shot. That part that I really don't understand, like when people are talking, like I realize that they don't give you the credit you deserve.
SPEAKER_00: I don't understand why. Is it because they don't like your style? Or is it something else? Like, whenever you are ranked up there, like, I think you are fourth place, and they are like, oh, why is Jerry there? And then whenever I remind them, you beat Gennady and George Svetko, you know? And then I don't understand, like, just because you lost against Hermes, you say that you were very ill, but even if Hermes would beat you,
SPEAKER_00: I mean, it doesn't make you number 20 or something, you know, I don't understand. But did you see, we had a podcast, I, Levan and Ernest, I talked to Levan. Levan said that if he would make mistakes, you would probably beat him. This is how seriously, like people, whenever I look at the comment section, how some people talk about you, and whenever I ask to top athletes,
SPEAKER_00: And then this is completely different, you know, like, you know, like Levan says that if he get caught, not here, but here, he said that it is very, very hard to beat you. And I agree with him. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And okay. So after this, if you win against Alex,
SPEAKER_00: seems like you want to have a title shot because Hermes had that shot and then Hermes is ranked above you and Devon is ranked above you. And so if you beat him, if you beat Alex, you will be asking for the title match? Yeah, yeah. I mean, that's the intent, right? I understand, yeah. And what is Alex Chance beating you? Do you stylistically find him dangerous?
SPEAKER_02: I think you can never underestimate anyone, right? If you go in and underestimate someone, you're giving them an advantage. So I'm not going to underestimate him. And then he definitely upped his game when I saw him against Georgie because it doesn't look like the same person that lost to Dave Chafee. He looks like he ate the person that lost to Dave Chafee. I understand, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: But I think that you feel confidence because of his style or it wouldn't matter? Well, I like people that got the longer arms, right? You like better when you're opening the full forearm? Yeah, I like a longer lever, right? Because for me, it opens them up more because they're coming to my side. And so I just...
SPEAKER_02: I know he's a versatile guy. I just don't know if he, because where he had difficulty with Dave, you know, obviously I'm going to pull off of, you know, different matches that he didn't do well with and try to emulate what they did. What did you think about Devin versus Levan match? I thought...
SPEAKER_00: When you see round one, did you say that it was over because everyone knows that Devon has great endurance and he's already stopped at round one? David you think that Devon would exhaust him and beat him?
SPEAKER_02: You know, I was confused, right? When I watched round one, I didn't know if Levan was given 100% or if he was trying to feel him out. Because Levan wasn't really given much facial expression, right? If you're trying to read someone's face... His arm was holding, but I had an interview with him after, what would happen if he would try to, he said,
SPEAKER_00: he would lose his wrist, like his arm was holding, wasn't going anywhere, but he didn't have here. If he would go, he would lose his wrist. Okay, sorry, go ahead. Yeah, no, no, no. Like you said, I just, I was trying to get a read on him, you know,
SPEAKER_02: in looking at it when when i saw him and he was just locked right there i was like is he trying to wear devin out is he giving a hundred percent because it didn't look like he wasn't giving any thrusting motions or movement this way he sat there and was just holding holding holding so i wasn't sure what he was doing at what level you know what gauge he was given and um so i was
SPEAKER_02: in awe that the match stopped dead center, right? And I was like, oh shit, Devin may have a shot, right? But then watching Levan, I was thinking maybe Levan's just messing around. Okay, holding, yeah, yeah, okay. But whenever, if he was only holding, he could finish like this. If you realize that he scratched him first and then he died to shoulder pressure, so
SPEAKER_02: Do you think after the round one, what did you think about the round one after you saw everything? After I saw him come back and then when he went in and pushed him down, then I figured that Levan had to change up his style from what he was comfortable doing and went to a move that he wasn't anticipating using, but he had in the bag and did something that he didn't think he was going to have to do to beat Devin.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, you're right. Yeah. Because the first time, remember the first time that him and Devin went, he blew through him and just ripped him open and over. And this one wasn't like that. So it means that Devin improved, but still wasn't enough. Yeah. And I think that's why Devin wants to go down in the class now, right? I heard it was because of you. I think it is too.
SPEAKER_02: He said, oh, naturally, now I'd have to go against Jerry, and Levon used Jerry's move, and if I can beat me, Jerry's going to do my move better. That makes sense. That makes sense, yeah. It makes sense to me. So you are saying that Devon is thinking that if Levon did this to him, and Jerry would even... Oh, can you imagine? Oh, my gosh. The poor guy. He'd run back to Canada and go back into a no-fly zone.
SPEAKER_00: You're trying to provoke him right now? Yeah, I'm always trying to provoke him. Since he went down, do you think he will come back to Supers again? No, he likes to stay in a class where he has a shot to win. Wow, that's interesting. That's interesting.
SPEAKER_02: I believe he will come back sooner or later. I don't know. I wouldn't think he'd want to come back into the Supers. I think he wants to dominate the class below. But whatever. He was talking shit, I guess, when he was going over the ranks and dogged me. So I'll dog him. I don't know. I understand. I understand. Let's see how it will be.
SPEAKER_00: This is incredible. Gennady is coming back. You're coming back. Yeah. Devin didn't beat Gennady. Devin lost to Gennady. I know. I know. I'm just saying this super away will be fun again, you know? Yeah, yeah. I'm just thinking, like, how Devin got owned by the Georgians. Hmm. Will you ever give Gennady a rematch? Would I give Gennady a rematch? Yeah. I wouldn't be against it, you know?
SPEAKER_00: I'm sure he's itching for it. What's that? I said, I'm sure that's what he wants. I don't know. I don't know. He wanted to pull Devin in September, but Devin decided to take a rest and he wants to go 105, 115 for now. But I kind of believe that sooner or later he will come back there. He said that he wants to go down and clean everything and then come back. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I'd like to go against Devin too. Yeah, it would be great. It would be great. You too. I think that you wouldn't get affected by his talking. No, no, he doesn't bother me. He likes to get in everyone's head and, you know, try to manipulate them. I mean, the last time we pulled was, you know, I don't know, five, six years ago. And
SPEAKER_02: That ended up going 3-2. The person on the right-hand side won every match. Oh, okay. You mean the one that doesn't have a buckle?
SPEAKER_02: Um, no, we, the, the, the right shoulder is the way the head ref is over here. Oh, okay. Right. Shoulders over here because each person, including me, I'm sure I didn't start square either when I was on the right side, but, uh, neither did Devin, right. He would start way over. So, um, I think where your Federation, the rules are strict and they're enforced and there's no, uh, no wavering. I think that it would be a different outcome. I understand. I understand.
SPEAKER_00: We will see. We will see. This week, King of the Table. Incredible event. The level is incredible. David you watch the... What did you think about Leonidas? David you follow his match? Yeah. He looked strong, huh? Strong, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. His schoolboy now is going to pull Ryan Bowen. Who do you think is going to win there? Um...
SPEAKER_02: I think Ryan's someone that a lot of people underestimate, right? And it might be because he's so ugly. But he's been coming back stronger, and I think he puts a lot of effort into training. And if I was just watching, what was it? Schoolboy was practicing with someone and getting beat, right? Who was he just practicing with? Irakli?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, but Irakli is incredibly strong. Oh, no, I agree, but I'm just saying it was making it look like he wasn't on the table. So, I don't know, I think it's going to be a good matchup. I don't know if he's going to train him, but Irakli also pulled with Laletin in Dubai after Laletin had a match with Dave Sheffield. Irakli also take him. I mean, in a real match, I don't think he can do that, but still, Irakli is very strong, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, no, no, he's a huge powerhouse in his class. And Pauline versus Lachlan. Who? Lachlan, Lachlan Adair from Australia. Against who? Pauline. Oh, Pauline. Yeah, and you know, the other match I was talking about was you putting Pauline back against Rustem, Babaya. That's going to be amazing.
SPEAKER_02: Right? That's going to be a sick match because that's what happened. We were there. Jerry, that list that I sent you is confidential. It's not announced for August. Oh, sorry. It's okay. Fuck. All right. My bad. So, Paul Lynn versus...
SPEAKER_02: I think I like both competitors, right? And I think that...
SPEAKER_02: with uh lachlan is super strong but i think paul lynn has been putting in a lot of table time and he goes to practice all over so i i think that it's gonna be paul lynn is super strong and i'm not taking any away from locking lockman i think is one of the hardest training gym rats but i think um where paul is just phenomenal on the table in practice i i think that's going to be an amazing match i think you did a good job with that one too
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah, yeah. People on the comment section telling you, Jerry, tell us more, tell us more. Yeah, no, I'm good. Evgeny that match maybe changed, switched to something different. Especially now if I said something, right? No, I was just thinking, I was just thinking, you know, maybe rematch with Paul or someone else.
SPEAKER_00: Paul already knows who else it can be, but we will see. But what do you think about the August card? What do you think about the Team US or Team West in that card in August event?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, you took... I can say something about it or no? No, no. Generally, what do you think? Is it strong? Oh, yeah, yeah. I was shocked. There's a lot of good matches on there. You fucking did a great job. Armwrestling deserves it, Jerry. If I'm not going to do all that, who's going to do it, you know? I'm not looking for a match that, you know, it's going to cost me this match, no need this or just...
SPEAKER_02: Just fucking do it. Write the history. If you lose money, you lose money. Who cares? I don't know about that, but I don't want you to lose money. But I think that there's no question that that's going to be an unbelievable lineup. And when people know what it is, that's going to be crazy. Yeah. A ton of matches. A ton of matches. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It will be great. Yeah, it will be great. Yeah. And I was like, whenever you said, how come I'm not in Florida event, you know?
SPEAKER_00: And I was like, yeah, he's right. You know, he is right. Yeah. I'm like my country, you know, you, yeah. Yeah. I want to, I want to come and compete in my country. Cause I haven't competed in my country since I've been doing young eats. Yeah. And let's, let's, let's people from East to travel this side this time, you know? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Let them see what it's like to travel 11 hours. Yeah. Yeah. You are right. You're right. You're right. Yeah. Anyway. So.
SPEAKER_02: and what did you say pauline lachlan who do you think is gonna win i think paul lynn has the advantage but um obviously i'm a i'm a huge lachlan fan right he's just such a nice guy you can't be around lachlan and not you know love hanging out with him he's just he's a great dude but um i think paul and mike have the advantage um
SPEAKER_02: because of the level of dedication Paul does to actual table time. I watched Paul go to practices and he just stays on the table. Evgeny if he's dead, he still stays on the table and keeps going and going and going and going. It's like the Energizer Bunny. Guys, on the chat, you guys put countless tongues there. What is that? Is it because of Jerry? Or is it because he leaked information? I don't know what it means.
SPEAKER_00: Because when I compete, I stick my tongue out. Yeah, that's why they are there. Okay, okay. Anyway, so this one is incredible. In your category, possibly your future opponents, Revas versus Disgarano.
SPEAKER_02: Do you remember this? I don't know. I know who he is. Yeah. I just I know. Kazakhstan. Yeah. Yeah. But Rivas has been he looks he looks like a mafia hitman. Right. Like he. Yeah. He just he looks like he's going in. He just wants to kill you.
SPEAKER_02: And he goes in there and he's like all boom, all business. I see no, no, no smile, no nothing. He goes in and he's like, ah, bam. And he looks so strong. Yeah. He's now 170 kilo. I think it is, what is that? Three, three, three 74, I think. Holy shit. No way. Really?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I think 170 kilos, 374. 150 is 330, right? 150 kilos is 330, 140. And then 20 kilos is 44 pounds. So it is, yeah, 374 pounds, yeah. This is what they told me. He really looks big, you know. How did he get... But he's almost two meters. You know, he's the same height as Levan. Oh, is he? Yeah, he's just almost two inches taller than Levan.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, okay. Yeah, huge guy, big guy, really. And big structure, you know, like the shoulders, everything. You know, right? Yeah. Have you been in the same event with him? Yeah, right. I was... I'm trying to remember who he went against. I was in what? I was in four, six, and eight. I got your shirt hanging in my gym. Six and eight. Hmm.
SPEAKER_00: But you remember him in the same place you saw him? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I just don't remember who he went against. Okay, okay. Oh, I think I know. I think he pulled against Derek, I think. Oh, Derek Smith? I think in the fall, August 2022. Yeah, I think, yeah. GB19, thank you.
SPEAKER_00: Alex versus Jerry, winner, pull title match. It is Levan. I don't know. We will see. There is one more match. I agree with you. GB19, Jerry agrees with you. There is also Laletin versus Morozov match. That is also in July, a month before you guys pulling. Anyway, so let's go. Okay, who is winning?
SPEAKER_00: I think Rives wins, especially if he's coming in at 370. Yeah, I don't think there's any question. I think that guy is a beast. Yeah, but whenever you are too big, sometimes endurance problem also happens, you know, especially in Dubai, every match is best of seven. Over here, only the title matches are best of seven. Yeah. Anyway, so Michael Todd versus Lars. You know Lars from Norway?
SPEAKER_02: i um i think i i remember him but then i was getting confused with tobias but um no no i know i know he's from norway yeah yeah i i don't know him enough to to to call the match he is he is he's like you okay yeah and he is going against michael 115 kilo 253 category
SPEAKER_00: Okay, yeah. At 115, you know, I want to bet on Mike because I like Mike. So I'll take Mike just because he's, you know, he's from the U.S. Okay. And Jerry, do you closely follow other categories as well, like Ongarbaev? I love Ongarbaev. And do you know also Petro or Petro from Ukraine? Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, they will be pulling and this is my favorite match in this card. All of them are great, but this is my favorite. It's 105 kilos, 231, light heavyweight. And if you remember, Petro in the last match beat Marcio Barbora. And then before that, I think he beat Chen Xiao. So Petro and Ongarbe was the ex-champion.
SPEAKER_00: He had title three, three matches, and then he lost against Tartasic. So now they are going to pull. The winner will be closer, one step closer to the title match, while the guy who loses will be one step back, you know? Right, right. I got you. Yeah. I think Ungubayev is a class act, good dude. I...
SPEAKER_02: I watched him when he went against John, and I don't know if John might have been a little sick, but that was a great match. Then when he pulled Michael Todd, I was shocked when him and Todd Hutchings, the match went the way it did, because I thought Ongebaev was going in as the favorite, you know? Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_02: But Todd's one of those ones who had that crazy strength, you know? So you get him in a wrong position, he can outpower you easily. Were you surprised when Daddy can beat Hutchings? Yeah, yeah. And especially inside. Yeah, the way he beat him was convincingly, right? So I was shocked, right? Yeah, yeah. Anyway, so the next one is...
SPEAKER_00: Kamil Jablonski versus Vitalii Laletin with left arm. Yeah. See, you know this better than everyone else because you look at it from Kamil's perspective and you're looking at a tall guy with the pronation style. How do you see this match? You know, Kamil has been fun to watch, you know, and he's been...
SPEAKER_02: going up the rankings and doing well. I think he's going to surprise people the way he surprised Devin and was able to pull that out. So I'm going to go with Camille for the win. He's got a strong press, and I like press, right? So he's stealing my move, but I'd lend it to him. Okay, okay.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, whenever you say dead-risk shoulder pressure, the first name comes to mind is Jerry Cadoret, for sure, last 30 years. And Morozov versus Ivan Matushenko, left-arm world title match. Ivan is heavyweight world champion, while Morozov is the super heavyweight world champion, and they are going to pull.
SPEAKER_00: David you follow Ivan Matushenko closely? Yeah, yeah, I've watched him. I've seen his matches. David you see him versus Kamil? What's that? He pulled against Kamil with right arm. Yeah, yeah. And I think Morozov is going to win, right? I think he's just...
SPEAKER_02: absolute power. Yeah. He's, he's not a, uh, I think being bigger, being stronger, I think, uh, Moore's office, once he gets one loss under his belt, it's like something snaps in his brain and he becomes a beast. Hmm. I understand. So you are basically saying that Morozov will remain. I think so. The champion. Yeah. Okay.
SPEAKER_00: And what do you think about Morozov versus Vitalii Laletin in July? I think that's going to be a tough match. That's right-handed, right? Yes. Yeah. And the winner of this match is going to Levan for title. What?
SPEAKER_02: Oh, get the fuck out of here. I'll get on a plane. That's not going to happen, right? So just everyone watching, that's not, right? So what does that mean? That better not happen. What's that? You said that better not happen. I don't know. We will see.
SPEAKER_00: The winner of you and the legend was going to pull Levan, and you rejected that match, so what can I do? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. I did not reject it. That's bullshit, right? I said I wanted to do both, right? You said no, it was too close, right? Yes, I was right. I was right. It is too close to pull two matches in five weeks. Just imagine you get hurt and then cancel the match. You let them do it?
SPEAKER_00: You let Devin do it. Devin is right now almost middleweight or welterweight. No, you let Devin do it when he went against Hermes. Remember, he went the previous match and then went against Hermes. Oh, Hermes did that? Yeah. Yeah, Hermes pulled two matches, but we didn't set that match. We set the match after your match finished.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, and there wasn't much of a match, so yeah, I don't blame you. No, no, what I'm just saying that we did not say Devon versus Hermes before that. We said it after that. No, but I'm saying- The problem is, the problem is- I didn't say you said it, but I said you let it. You let it happen. No, no, I let it because it was ready. But what I'm just saying that it is not possible everyone to get American visa and come back. You understand? It is not that easy. You understand? If Alex-
SPEAKER_00: If you cannot pull the American match, who is Alex going to pull? Yeah. Yeah, or whoever was going to pull against you, whatever. I told you, I would have beat Hermes or I would have beat Alex. You would beat Hermes in July? In July? No, I mean, what do you mean, Hermes and Alex? I said for the Orlando.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, and? You said he didn't want to go against me because he was scared. Hermes was scared of you? I said this? That's what you said. I didn't say he was scared. I said he doesn't want to play against you. Yeah, because he was scared, see? You just said it again. In fact, he says this is too easy money. He doesn't think it's fair to the organizer.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, go pull a guy out of the hospital, and then he goes against him, and then fucking he's going to claim that he beat, you know, a good version of me. So that match is going to happen. Maybe, maybe, maybe when the winner of Morozov and Ladecin pulls Levan, you pull Hermes since you are so confident. Well, stop saying you're going to give the Levan match away to one of them. But listen, do you know why I think that? Because I want to make sure that you get your revenge from Hermes.
SPEAKER_00: I'm going to, I'm going to, yeah, that's fine. Anyway, just joking aside. Yeah. Yeah. And Prudnik is pulling Irakli. What's that? Prudnik and Irakli in July. I think that's going to be a good match too. I like both competitors I like. I'm just trying to think of who I would bet on to win.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know, Rackley's been looking so dominant, right? And I mean, it's got to be a huge advantage for Rackley. He trains with Levan, right? So if you've got the best to train with, you've got nowhere to go but up. So we'll see. But Rackley also has losses. He lost to Dadikyan, he lost against Ongarbev. Yeah. Yeah. He lost against Haplos usually. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: And I don't know, Prudnik is strong, right? So you can't take that away from him. We will see what shape he will be in. Because for a long time he hadn't competed because of injury after Devon match. Yeah. And we will see. We will see how it will be. And Tata Kings versus Krasimir? You know what?
SPEAKER_02: Krazy is good. I like Todd, you know. So I'll be rooting for Todd. I just think it's going to be a war. And only because of how good Krazy always did with John. And I picture John and Todd being close to the same, you know. Yeah. The only thing is that Krazy is going inside where... Where Todd's the strongest. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm not sure he's the strongest after showing with Dadek and Mesh, but...
SPEAKER_00: Dadikyan didn't actually go there, but Todd got him there. But Dadikyan was strong there as well. What do you think about Dadikyan? If he was like 10 kilos heavier, just say he's 253, does he have a chance against Devin or in 231? He holds the 231 title.
SPEAKER_00: Do you think Devin goes down to 231 that he can maybe beat him or not? I think he has a better shot of Devin dropping down to 231 because Devin being 231 at 6'4", 6'5", you know, he's got a lot less muscle than if he was up in the 250 class, right? So the idea is if he brought Devin down to the 230s, I think he's got the advantage. So you think he will be the favorite or he will have more chance than 253 category?
SPEAKER_02: No, I think he has more chance of favorite in the 230s. So do you think that possibly he will beat Devin there? I mean, I don't know if he's going to beat him, but I think his chances are higher. Like if you were putting percentages on it, I'd give him a higher percentage to win, weighing in at 230. But I don't, you know, it's always tough to bet against Devin, right? And I mean, when's the last time he's lost two in a row? You're talking about Devin? Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Anyway, so, yeah, those will be very good ones, yeah. What did you think about Ali Can Murado against Hermes? The guy is seriously strong? Yeah, it was left-handed, and I don't know if – was Hermes training? Because it didn't look like he was training. Hermes, yes, yeah, he's training. He said he was going to beat Ali Can. He says it is 85% of his right arm.
SPEAKER_00: What? Artem you trained 85% with his right? No, no, no, he trains. His left arm power is 85% of his right. Sorry, I had to get rid of a call. Yeah, yeah. So his right arm is 15% stronger. Or I should say his left arm is 85% of his right arm. Okay, yeah. Wait, you're saying his right arm is 85%? No.
SPEAKER_00: His left arm is 85% of his right arm. Right arm is here, left arm is here. David you think that the difference was more than 15% or less than 15%? Well, looking at him there, he looked like he was a little school boy, right? Not school boy the person, like a little school child going against a man. He did not do well. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: This guy is 230 pounds, you know. Incredible, right? Yeah. Yeah, he looked phenomenal. Yeah. He has a goal to become the champion in open category in super heavyweights. Do you think he has a chance? Or no? After what he just did to Hermes? Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, so...
SPEAKER_00: Jerry, if we talk about general rankings and everything, right now Levan is number one, and Devon is number two, and Hermes is number three. You are number four. And do you think that this is, as it is proven, correct ranking? I mean,
SPEAKER_02: Everyone's opinion on rankings is always going to be different, right? So I think that Devin has to be there, right? Because he beat Ermias, but I don't feel like... I want to go against Devin, right? So you believe that you can beat Devin? Yes. And I know 90% of the population is going to think the other way, but that's okay. I don't give a shit, right? And...
SPEAKER_00: So I just, I would go against them, you know, whenever. And, and would you, would you pull against someone like Dennis? Dennis? Silistically, Dennis DiBlanco. How do you see yourself? What happened to him? He has a hip problem. It really hurts him. He cannot really train. It affects his performance at the table as well. And he...
SPEAKER_00: I hope he heals up because he's a strong person, great guy. His presence adds so much color to our nothing world. How do you see yourself against all those guys? Who do you think is the most dangerous guy for you besides Levan? Besides Levan?
SPEAKER_02: Well, I think I have to prove myself and go beat Hermes, right? And so that match has to happen. And then obviously in the fans' eyes or the other arm wrestlers, I'd have to go against Devin, which I'm fine going against Devin. And so I know that everyone's going to, you know, root on him, pick him, whatever. I love what he's doing for the sport, right? Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_00: I understand. Yeah. And so you are saying that with the results that we have till now, this top four is correct?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, the only thing that makes it confusing is if Gennady comes back and he's healthy, right, then Gennady beat Devin. So how do you twist that into the picture? Yeah, but if you look at that way, the Kurdesha beat Hermes. I know, I know. But don't you think that the reasons is more important? Like when Gennady beat Devin, Devin wasn't champion.
SPEAKER_00: When Gennady beat Devin, champion was you, and then Hermes was number one, you were number two, and then Devin beat Hermes. So he beat the champion. How can we rank Gennady above Devin? I know, that's what I said. That's where it gets a little twisted, right? So, I mean... I mean, the most recent results, like if you are beating champion, obviously you will rank above him, you know, this is what I said. Right, right. I think...
SPEAKER_02: you've got maybe eight people that on any given day depending on how how well they perform that day and if they're on could beat the other person right yeah so look at it like the top elite eight or something right and uh you throw those eight people in there and you do that uh a regular meet and if you did that three different times you could end up with three different winners
SPEAKER_00: Well, three different categories. But the thing is, we need to look at the most recent. I mean, if today is the date, if you're beating that guy, today is you are better than this guy, then what happened three months, six months, or eight months, or a year ago can't be more important than what is the most recent. This is how I see things. Like, what happened, it's just, like, different, you know? Like, sometimes style makes, you know, matches.
SPEAKER_00: Like we have Mindaugas Tarasaitis beat Daniel Prokopçuk. And Daniel Prokopçuk just only two days ago beat Alain Zolaire. And Alain Zolaire always beat Artur Makaro. And Artur Makaro beat Mindaugas. So it is just like a circle like this. And we have Cerkaso. Mindaugas beat him at least in three, four different events. Not one time. In a supermatch, in a tournament, right arm, left arm. He always beats him.
SPEAKER_00: And this guy beat Artur. And Artur beat Mindago. So, I mean, sometimes the things are not that clear, you know. I think it's the same in super heavyweight category. Yeah, I agree with you. Except Levan, that honestly it is proven. Otherwise, the guy is just the best, untouchable best, until someone proves different, you know. Like, I don't know. There are so many guys, like,
SPEAKER_00: I think Revas is not even ranked right now. I think Revas may be ranked, but Deserano is not. These guys are really, seriously, really strong guys. Yeah? Yeah. And, yeah, I don't know. We will see. Deserano, if he gets a visa, most likely he will be also in the Florida event. There is Todd and Oleg's love child. He says, so happy to have Jerry back.
SPEAKER_00: It is time to remind the world who you are. Thank you, my man. Yeah, I agree, Jerry. You are 50 years old. And I'm 49 and we cannot pull forever. So while we still can, let's pull a little bit more, huh? That's it. Do you think that you will be around like till 55 at the high level? Who knows? One meter at a time.
SPEAKER_02: I know, obviously, when the competitors are younger than my kids, it's always interesting, right? Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: We'll see. Oh, I got word, right? So I don't know if I'm supposed to say it, but I don't care. I'll say it anyway. My daughter just let me know that she's pregnant, going to have a baby. So she's going to have twins. So now I'm going to be a grandfather. Grandfather. Two times grandfather. Not before this meet, though. So it's after that. What's that?
SPEAKER_02: I said, at least it won't be before this Orlando meet. It's after. Oh, okay. After this. Okay. October. October. Okay. So you will be a grandfather. Twins. Twins. Yeah. But we don't know if they are boy or girl yet. Yeah. She just did the reveal. She did it cool too. So it's going to have one of each, boy and a girl. So I have a grandson and a granddaughter. One boy, one girl. Wow. And this will be the first time?
SPEAKER_00: First time. Yeah. Yeah. Wow. Congratulations, Jerry. Thanks. Thanks. That's great. That's great. Pretty cool. I remember, I remember the first time I met you was 96. Wow. You won 110 kilo. Yeah. Yeah. Against the, I think Brazilian, I think it was the Clovis. Yeah. He was in a hat. Yeah. Yeah. I remember. Yeah. And then do you remember Nebraska? You won the nationals.
SPEAKER_00: there was like after party or something, you put your hand to the wall. My hand up against the wall. And I did one arm pull up on your,
SPEAKER_02: Yep. I tell that story, right? You said you could do a one-arm pull-up. I was like, get the fuck out of here. No way. And then you're like, yeah, yeah. And then you told me, put my arm against the wall. So I put my right arm against the wall. And then you proceeded to grab my arm and then just do a one-arm pull-up like it was nothing. So when I tell the story, people are like, what was more amazing, that he could do a one-arm pull-up easy or you could hold him with one arm while he did a one-arm pull-up?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I think both. You were, like, leaning to the wall like this. You put your arm to the wall, and, yeah, it was incredible, yeah. But it was very hard to hold it because it's very thick arm. Oh, yeah, yeah, because you couldn't grab it like this. You grabbed like this. No, no. But I have done on the, like, tanks, you know, how do you call that thing, you know, pull-ups. So for me, the only problem was that, like, on the tanks, I don't know how you call that, you know.
SPEAKER_00: uh, battle. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It is like very nice shape, you know, with your forearm, you know, it is just, you know, you know, you, you cannot really hold it well, you know, but it was after we had so many after pools, like we pulled like so many matches, everyone was pulling it. And then, then we, we just, I remember that happened. Yeah. You were, yeah, you were incredible. And then you won 2000, 2000. Wow.
SPEAKER_00: also in Virginia, again in Virginia. And then I remember you and, uh, I think before that you and John had a long, long war at the Harley, Harley pool. I remember it was overalls. Yeah. Yeah. I still got my, I still got my, uh, my vest from that Harley. Yeah. I have it too. Mine is small. Yeah. Yeah. Mine's too tight. Right. I weighed like, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: 253 i think was then yeah 253 yeah probably but the same year you want 242s i think and love yeah i did that was the last time yeah last time and last time i was 242. i uh i didn't like literally that killed me to get down to that weight because my walking around weight was probably 268 yeah so i had to cut out 26 pounds and i was in good shape
SPEAKER_02: So all I was eating was chicken and white rice, dry chicken, white rice every day. And the day before the meat, I cut out no food, no water, no nothing. I just dehydrated myself. Went in, not the meat, the day before the weigh-ins. I flew down there. I went into the weigh-in.
SPEAKER_02: I had to strip down to just my underwear, and then I waited exactly on the button, and I was like super dehydrated. I left the weigh-in, went across the street to Wendy's, and I'm like, oh, I want a triple cheeseburger, a large fry, and a frosting, right? I get it all, and I'm trying to eat it all. I couldn't even finish it. My stomach went like that. Yeah, yeah, it gets smaller, yeah. You think, every time I go to the Waffles, before the weigh-in, I go shop. I buy...
SPEAKER_00: bags of food and then I always take back to home because I cannot finish them because you think that you will eat everything but your stomach gets smaller and once you eat a little bit you are like okay enough you know. Yeah and I felt like shit because I hadn't eaten a bad food in so long.
SPEAKER_02: so you're eating it you're trying to put it down and like oh i can't even finish it and then i don't even feel good so i'm like oh man that was a mistake but luckily with that the those world championships we weighed in on like sunday and i didn't compete until thursday so i'll bet i was back up 260 by thursday because i waited 242 on the button the day of the weigh-in and then it gave me four days to eat and hydrate yeah yeah because because there was masters and everything the first two days
SPEAKER_00: And then left arm, which you don't compete, and then right arm, so fourth day you compete. What's your weight now? 328. Oh, you're big. You're big. And you will be bigger? Yeah, I want to come in about 335 or better. Wow. So put on another seven pounds. There will be war between you and Alex. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: It will be an incredible event, yeah. Let's see how Team West will do this time. A team with incredible, incredible guys. Where... Jon Brzee, Jerry Cadoret, Michael Todd, Dave Chaffee, Matt Mask, Travis Bechant, Corey West, Justin Bishop, Pauline, Paul Talbot, Craig Tuller, and Jonathan Breda. So far.
SPEAKER_00: then there may be one more, but we will see. We will see. All but one of them are Americans. Yeah, except Matt Mask, yeah. And if somehow Devin changes his mind and decides to pull at least left arm, then that will be... You mean what? Left arm. Left arm. I thought maybe if there was a shot, I could just take him out right off. Okay, one second, one second, one second.
SPEAKER_00: Don't you ever match with Alex? You would switch it? Yeah, I'll go. Yeah, I would switch. I would go with Devin, and then I'll pull the other one left-handed. I'll pull Alex left. Come on. Alex would eat you as a lunch with left arm. Maybe. No, maybe. Yes, he would. What if you see me to be left-handed? Listen.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, if you think you can convince Devon, just go ahead. But I don't think Devon will pull. But it's totally up to you. But I need to know this at least one and a half months. His skirt got too short. He's not ready. His what? His skirt is too short. Too short. Yeah. So you think Devon wears skirt?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, no, I'm saying Devin's wearing a skirt. Like, he's trying to lose weight and drop down a category. So he's, you know, going to be too small. Too small. I understand. I understand. We will see. We will see. I'm not going to ask Devin. But if you somehow talk with him, change his mind, then anything is possible. So we can talk about it. But we need to talk with Alex. Maybe Alex would like to have a shot against Dave Sheffield.
SPEAKER_00: since he lost the first one. So who knows? Yeah. That could be late. Listen, that could be a interesting thing right there too. Yeah. I mean, anything, anything just, we need to just, as long as everyone agrees, I have no problem with it. Um, put Nick versus Iraq, the 95 kilo category is asking. No, it is in one Oh five. It's in one Oh five. Yeah. Anyway. So Jerry, my friend, as I said, uh, one hour,
SPEAKER_00: I'm not going to take your time any longer. Would you like to say anything? Would you like to have a message to anyone up there, down there, you know, anywhere?
SPEAKER_02: uh yeah i mean i just i know i have to come back and prove myself because i was reading some of the comments it's always funny right but i don't i don't really care i don't take offense it's people have strong fingers they're your keyboard warriors right so i uh i think i'll do what i need to do i'll prove what i have to prove on the table
SPEAKER_02: You put whoever in front of me, as long as it makes sense in its progression for me to go back after the title. That's what I want to do, right? I'm willing to put it in. And I told you, I'd go against Vitalii. I'd go against Alex. I'd go against Hermes. I'd go against Devin. And obviously, ultimately, the road I want is to try to go against LeVon. Because after watching LeVon go against Hermes, and Hermes did well with the press, he can't do it like me.
SPEAKER_00: And I think everyone wants a shot at who's sitting on the throne, right? And it only makes sense. So just make it happen. Okay. Okay. I will do my best. I will do my best. And we will see what happens. Now, next is King of the Table 11 next weekend. And then we have the East vs. West 13 in July. And we have the Challenger Series on June 15th.
SPEAKER_00: And then Orlando, and I think Orlando will be unforgettable anyways. Thank you very much, Jerry. Thank you. And tell your family hello from my family and congratulations. One more time. Thank you. I'm in a grandfather. I'm sure you will be a great one and take care of yourself. Don't get ill. Nope. No, no, no. Don't even say that word. Don't even say that word. It only happened one time. One time. Okay. Stay healthy. And then, and then.
SPEAKER_02: I'm going to make everyone proud. All the naysayers will eat their words, right? I'm going to put the work in. I'm going to make sure I get there. I'm going to make sure that I come in prepared. As you can see, I'm already on my way there. Yes, yes, 3.28, incredible. And I have 11 weeks, 11 weeks to get into beast mode, right? But make sure the timing is good, that you reach right there.
SPEAKER_00: on the competition day not any earlier because it's hard to stay there so long yeah yeah no no i'm just gonna work on getting big and then i'll refine it two weeks before you know boom boom yeah yeah then it'll be ass kicking time yep i believe so i believe i believe you but i believe alex as well who knows we will see i want hey listen i wanted to come in big and healthy like he was against georgie
SPEAKER_02: you know wants to beat the worst person or someone that's why i say army should be feel like so disappointed that he went against me when i had pneumonia now he's such a and won't want to go against me when i'm in when i'm healthy but yeah whatever okay i mean i think that if you beat alex and miss will say let's go yeah you mean when but that's fine okay
SPEAKER_00: You take care of yourself, Jerry. Thank you very much for coming. See you later, everyone. I'll make you proud. Don't worry. Take care. Take care. Guys, let's talk a little bit more. I think Jerry left.
SPEAKER_00: Thank you, guys. Thank you. Jerry left, but his picture is still there. So I kind of feel I need to talk with him, but I know he's not there. Anyways. Yeah, Jerry is watching all of us, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Guys, there are so many matches to set. Morozov, Gennady, Morozov, Hermes, Gennady, Hermes, like so many matches. Vitalii, incredible, incredible. Just like good times waiting for us, good times. Yes, Devon is pulling, not 65, we don't have, but soon we will have 70 kilos.
SPEAKER_00: Do you guys think that it would be fair to other guys if Devin gets a direct title shot at 70 kilos? Or he should just prove himself since the lightweight is tougher? How many matches did I set? I don't know. I don't know how many was it.
SPEAKER_00: I think with August events, I think as far as I remember, I think end of this year will be probably around 200 matches end of this year, I think. Yeah. Yeah, I think end of this year, there will be 200 matches total.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, just guys ignore the jealous people, ignore the haters. Let's, let's make our dreams come true and make arm wrestling a mainstream event. Yeah, I will do with Gennady as well. The only thing is that this, I don't know why.
SPEAKER_00: videos, this video, podcast, they are a little bit exhausting when I do many. See, after the King of the Table, I need to do 14 of them because there are 14 matches. Guys, by the way, I said Chance versus Ibragim Sagov. Before that, if you remember, I said Petro Marharint versus Dadikyan and Sasho versus Samushia.
SPEAKER_00: These are all incredible matches. And East versus West 13 will be very tough event. And Levan is also coming as a special guest. Devon is coming as a special guest. And thank you, Maestro. Thank you. I'm a hard worker of arm wrestling.
SPEAKER_00: No, he's not getting direct title. He beat the European champion, Nugzari, who beat Krasimir at the Europeans. And also, Petro has already proved himself. If you remember, Jerry, when he came first time, he had a title match. Ungar, when he came first time, he had a title match. Rustam Bava, when he came first time, he had a title match.
SPEAKER_00: And Artem Taino directly came for title match. There are some people that has proved themselves outside of East versus West. Like there will be one guy possibly. I asked to Rob Visions about Sagov match. He said that I think
SPEAKER_00: He was not available for family holiday or something, so he didn't accept Pusako. I'm happy that you like them, Benji. Thank you, Houdin Sports. Yeah, Maiorov, yeah. Not only Maiorov, there are many of them. Many of them, yeah. Huala was there directly.
SPEAKER_00: 162 matches. Hmm. So 162 matches. If I have 28 more at the July and August, so it will be 190 then. Yeah. Thank you, Unix. Thank you. Left arm. Dadikyan's left arm is still injured, my friend.
SPEAKER_00: I don't think he can pull. He said that he can pull like one time and then he has a big pain after that. So I don't think he is in a competition shape. He cannot even really train hard. Alexander Bejans, I don't know. Travis is pulling Kalinichenko. Kalinichenko is not a top 10 guy.
SPEAKER_00: But I can say maybe top 15, maybe 15, maybe 20, 15, 20 for super heavyweight. For 115 kg, Kalinichenko easily top 5, I think, my opinion. And I think he was in heavyweight shape right now. And he still has a little bit more than 5 weeks for the July event.
SPEAKER_00: And he's already been a lot of trash talk. And I think the more he talks, the more he provokes Travis. And I kind of feel that Travis will come here. I think if Kalinichenko didn't talk, it would be better for him. I'm not saying he cannot win now or something, but probably Travis would come here more relaxed now whenever he's talking to Tanzo.
SPEAKER_00: trash talk, Travis will be provoked and I think he will bring here even better shape than he would. That's how I think. Game minutes, I think Ali Can will be pulling right and left at the WAF. But I know he's going to pull WAF.
SPEAKER_00: But I don't know the details. Yeah, Kalinichenko, Matt Mask versus Kudos, yeah. You're right. Kalinichenko really surprised me with his super heavyweight shape when he beat Arif. He was in great shape. He was really big. But we know that... Travis told me he will probably bring 85% of his best shape. This is what he said. But...
SPEAKER_00: We will see, he still has six weeks, maybe even, maybe it will be maybe even 90% since Kalinichenko is talking a lot. Kalinichenko is, how to say, he's a great promoter as an athlete. He's promoting the event great. He has different ideas.
SPEAKER_00: and now he's also a contracted puller or his versus western king of the table i think we will be seeing him doing crazy things and i think that he and travis will be doing a great press conference i think and let's see let's see i just can't wait to have a special at the press conference he will be also i will have a
SPEAKER_00: uh i will also have um podcast with them let's see how it will be i'm just waiting everything you know uh king of the table 11 incredible event next week i just can't wait everything is ready on the giant screen i will be watching
SPEAKER_00: I don't have plans for Ali Can after the WAF yet. We will talk. Yeah, yeah. I don't think he's going to pull. I mean, he's going to pull a super heavyweight. Probably it will be either Morozov or maybe Laletin, maybe Kamil, maybe Matushenko. I don't know. We will see.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. Anyways, guys, you all take care of yourself, and I will be with you guys again. Tuesday, Alex Kurdecev will be my guest, and we will talk about King of the Table and Lachlan Carpenter. Any news on Leonidas? Leonidas will be playing John Bersink in August, Orlando.
SPEAKER_00: John Bersink versus Leonidas Arcona. Yeah. They will be pulling in Orlando as the main event. Orlando event will be at the noon time of US Eastern time.
SPEAKER_00: So it will be, in my country, it will be 7 p.m. So it will be almost the same, like the time that we start here, there's no time there, so no time there is here. So we cannot do that evening in Florida because here will be very late. In Europe, it will be after midnight.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, you can be sure about Paul Hutchings. But I don't think I will have to do a lot of things. Travis is a unique personality. Travis doesn't like to be controlled. Travis, everything naturally is better for Travis. Travis' personality is already, how to say, competitive. And if you push him,
SPEAKER_00: in opposite way, you know. Yes, Samushia versus Sasho, 85. Yeah. You think Krasimir beats Ali Can right hand? I wouldn't be sure about that one. Yes, Chen Shou. Chen Shou beat Zurab and Zurab beat Ibragim. But Ibragim beat Sandris and Sandris beat Chen's.
SPEAKER_00: So we don't know how this will happen. Why do I think that Travis is coming? Travis is coming because he wants to. Travis loves arm wrestling. I know Travis likes money as well, but I think Travis is making right decision. Like he's coming here as the commentator every event and he sees what's happening there.
SPEAKER_00: And he probably thinks that if I'm not going to do this now, I won't be able to do it five years later. So while I can still do it, let me do it because Travis loves armwrestling as well. Like who wouldn't want to be part of what's happening today, which is the golden age of armwrestling. Like, you don't know how painful for me to watch that event and not to be part of it. Like, I mean,
SPEAKER_00: Like I'm like hanging, like in your best times, you know, it wasn't like this. Now it's very popular, like very respected and East, West, everyone is all together, but now you're just watching. But I just think that like, it is more important than my personal goals, more than my personal dreams. And this is what I owe to arm wrestling. So I started to train.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe last one week I do very light because for me is first important thing is to be healthy. So I just do like today I did the hammer curl with dumbbell just for example, only eight kilo of motion dynamic, you know, but I will, I will go up, but not right away. Evgeny if I can do much more now, I'm not going to do it. I want to get stronger by staying pain-free. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, Travis is incredible, yeah. Liliev, I just talked with him two days ago on the phone. I think very soon, I think maybe August or something, he will be done with his job. And right now, he says five days, he goes other part of Russia to do the job. And then weekends, he come back home. And I told him, you know, like instead of not doing anything, when you come on
SPEAKER_00: We can just do at least some pull-up and do some bicep curls, hammer curls, you know. At least when you come, when you finish your job, you won't be starting everything from zero. Just do some training, you know. You don't need to do everything. And he said, yeah, it's a good idea. And I think he will be doing this. Yes, yes, yes. Roy Levary. East versus West 13 is incredible. Incredible. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: No, I don't get annoyed by Samushia. I have a huge respect for Samushia. I would like to pull him. I don't think I will be ready very soon. But Samushia, what he's doing is incredible. He just already wrote his name with golden letters. You know, it's incredible. Yeah, yeah. If Sasho loses, then yeah, I will have to pull Samushia.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, but from one side, my eyes are also looking into that 77 kilo category. It was 75, but now we added 70. So I made that one 77. And so I'm looking both categories, 85 and 77. 85 in probably short term and 77 in maybe long term. Yeah. Yeah, Samushia, incredible.
SPEAKER_00: I can't really. I'm not sure if I can go to Florida or not. I will apply very soon for visa. If I get visa, I will go. If I cannot, I will not go. I plan to travel. I plan to go to...
SPEAKER_00: Do you think Leonidas will train every day in Turkey? No, the Leonidas match is in Florida, so it's not over here. Stem cell engine. I had one stem cell. I don't think it was enough. I need more, but I don't think it's possible, so we'll see. Yeah, Victor. Yeah, king of the table. September 21st. How many months? A little bit less than four months. I'm not sure if I can grade it.
SPEAKER_00: um yeah we will see we will see yeah we'll see how it will be anyways guys you all take care don't forget tuesday alex kurdecha will be my guest and we will talk this guy is um this guy is the guy that people talks
SPEAKER_00: about being the biggest threat for Levan. But he has a match with Jerry and then we will see. I know Jerry gets upset but we have Jerry and Alex and we have Laletin and Morozov. So we will decide. Maybe they will have to pull, the winners need to pull against each other before they go against Levan. It's not that easy.
SPEAKER_00: to get a match against that guy. You all take care.
