SPEAKER_04: which is yeah exactly yeah which is that's insane right it's insane how fast it goes uh people are interested in these matches and this is the home for the East versus West right so that's what we're seeing here um we're going to be joined by a bit Killianiani uh Challenger and the champion Artem Taynov in a little bit
SPEAKER_04: We might be here longer than an hour. So for so maybe another 15 minutes. We're tied on a schedule. Artem tomorrow you also doing a podcast?

SPEAKER_04: Zurab, probably on Friday. So if I'm correct, tomorrow, one hour before this time, there's going to be Egle and Barbora with Madeline and Fiam. So right after that podcast, there's going to be another one. I'll be on road, but I'll try to join in if I can. And I think I will be able to do that. So I'll join as well.
SPEAKER_02: because uh for me because otherwise i have to find someone else because i don't speak that good russian and uh for for stream to be smooth obviously we need a good translator like yourself so either you or although if you i hope you manage ray if you can't then we will figure out something that's no problem yeah we'll be fine we'll be fine this is the team right yeah so guys uh you can always obviously uh
SPEAKER_02: be uh prepared to ask questions to us to uh champion and to the challenger and uh we'll be running super fast because like ray said we are tight on the schedule and also we don't want to uh held too long our athletes and you guys as well so yeah don't be shy ask questions
SPEAKER_04: um I'm really uh interested in this match right after oniani's last performance that we saw versus which was pretty insane right uh so I think very deservingly he has a title shot uh beat Sasho Andreev for the title um then did he face he faced Zurab right he faced Zurab with left arm
SPEAKER_02: Yes, and unfortunately, unfortunately for me as a Georgian, he crashed the world. Hey, listen, you Georgians cannot have it all. Listen, give something for the rest of the world. Okay? Kill. Yeah. I remember last event, he said that he's going to ban Georgians to participate. He was joking. That was hilarious. He did live on paper. Yeah, we are messaging our guys now. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: So we are 10 days away from East versus West 13. This will be live on a pay-per-view as usual on Core Sports. So everyone, if you have a chance to watch it by the live stream, support these kind of events.
SPEAKER_04: We are doing these podcasts, usually Engin does them, because Engin, first of all, loves armwrestling more than any person that has ever or will ever live. And he can talk about armwrestling for years and decades. But because of his help, we're taking over and we're kind of spreading the jobs and trying to do our best to help with these podcasts. So you have to deal with us a little bit.
SPEAKER_04: um eventually they will get used to us yeah yeah um okay okay so as a georgian you will know how how big star is lebanon at home is he like a mainstream celebrity there or not yet mainstream he is he is mainstream and if you noticed i'm not sure if
SPEAKER_02: you guys noticed and you ray but his instagram channel is now focused on so many more so many advertisements or to say that he's doing uh so the ones that he's getting paid obviously yeah yeah so it means he's getting more and more and more you know celebrity in georgia and not not not many it's such a such a high demand on the uh marketing as they want us in my country so
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, he's really top tier famous guy in my country. Which is awesome. That is absolutely insane. And I think well deservingly, right? Well deservingly. And I think he's a great ambassador as well for sport and strength sports in general. Yeah. So I remember he got famous like around 2000,
SPEAKER_02: uh 19 beginning of 19 and uh when he became so to say number one uh but still was unproven because he could not pull many westerns like michael todd devon and dave chafee and then one by one he did those two and i'm not sure about michael todd but now he's that one is super super famous in georgia he really really became a huge star
SPEAKER_02: But so does the others, like slowly. Gennady, for instance, people are sending him gifts like cars, you know. When he beat Devon, he got the X5 or something. Really? In BMW. Yeah, yeah. We two times, we were here on Engin's channel and Engin was constantly reminding him about that gift. And actually at that moment when Gennady was joining in from the car, obviously Georgian joining from the car,
SPEAKER_04: he was actually in that car that was the gift to him so that was really good good moment my friend very good moment very good moment i remember when kazakhs went back home after the top eight win right and they are
SPEAKER_04: the champion has joined us at tim tyner 95 kilo uh east versus west world champion uh on the left arm um i'll ask him how does he feel how do you feel how do you feel
SPEAKER_04: He sounds very happy. He looks very happy. He said the weather is good. The training is good. I'm 100% ready. I want to ask because he saw last performance on Oniani. What does he think about that? Have you seen the last match between Betkili and Oniani? What do you think about it? Of course, I've seen it. It's interesting because as soon as I found out that I was fighting him, I immediately re-watched it again. He dominated, dominated a lot.
SPEAKER_01: But I want to ask a controversial question, because it's not known what form Olga Aktaev was in, right? He fought Olga, didn't he? Yes, yes, yes. And what form is he in now? That's why I can't say what form he is in. But he won with a big margin, so you can't relax.
SPEAKER_04: He said, yeah, of course, I'm watching him. I kind of knew we will have a match. And he beat Talgat Aktaev with very big reserve, which was incredible. I really don't know how strong Talgat was, but it looks like Betkili is in a top shape. So I was very, very impressed.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, we won. We were in different categories. He fought in 1990, he fought in 1980, if my memory serves me right. But he was the only one who gave Alizhan Muratov a good resistance at that time.
SPEAKER_04: So I asked him, did he face each other when they were pulling in Woff? And he said no, because they pulled different weight classes. Talgat, for most of his career, pulled juniors in 75. Sorry, not Talgat, but Kili pulled 75 kilos. And Artem Taino pulled 90 kilos. And like he said, but Kili was the only one who was giving a real match to Aljan Murato. And we're being joined by the man himself, but Kili Oniani.
SPEAKER_04: Roman, I'm not going to take over this podcast. Hello. I just have to... You go, you go. I'll just jump in at some point. Yeah. All right. All right. Omar just paid. Omar, Omar, you're so good.
SPEAKER_02: so uh i just obviously quickly briefly uh said hello to him and uh asked how he's doing he said he's doing fine and he asked the same to us and uh yeah
SPEAKER_02: Usually, we are all doing great. So I could also ask the same questions like you asked about Taino, about how he's feeling about his opponent and his upcoming match. That's the most important one. So we can just keep going to it. But I said to keep with me what I've done, chance met orchestra. I don't know if you keep with me what I've done.
SPEAKER_00: And this is how the relationship between Taynov and Zurab will continue for the next two years. I think that all the changes will take place in a stable way, in a good shape. I think that the progress will continue, if there is a change, and if the change is possible. I don't know what will happen,
SPEAKER_00: I am very happy to be a part of this organization, and I am very happy to be a part of it, and I am very happy to be a part of this organization, and I am very happy to be a part of this organization, and I am very happy to be a part of this organization, and I am very happy to be a part of this organization, and I am very happy to be a part of this organization, and I am very happy to be a part of this organization, and I am very happy to be a part of this organization, and I am very happy to be a part of this organization, and I am very happy to be a part of this organization, and I am very happy to be a part of this organization, and I am very happy to be a part of this organization, and I am very happy to be a part of this organization, and I am very happy to be a part of this organization, and I am very happy to be a part of this organization, and I am very happy to be a part of this organization, and I am very happy
SPEAKER_00: I don't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing, but I don't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing. I don't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing, but I don't know if it's a good thing.
SPEAKER_02: So I asked him about his preparation. He said that he's stable. His preparation is having no hiccups, so to say. Evgeny though the time difference between last and this event is not optimal for him to be preparing the best shape possible, he's still saying that considering the time duration, I'm really confident that I'm giving my best. Nice mustache, Paolo.
SPEAKER_02: so um and uh he also I yeah we all right so he also said about Sura versus Taino match I asked him just like Artyom uh um analyzed he bet Gilles and Talgat's match and he said
SPEAKER_02: well i was speaking first person in his behalf he said well i cannot judge uh completely like precisely that match even though what you beat him obviously confidently i i still uh know what what was the issue with surabh uh prior to the match eight days uh so um i cannot really judge it like though
SPEAKER_02: 100% objectively, because there were some issues from the upside, and he hoped he would be recovered, but he could not. However, there is no doubt that I know is strong, and he also said at the beginning that
SPEAKER_02: at East versus West stage to have a belt that's that's really toughest job and since I don't hesitate he deserves it and it means that nobody should take him any any easy like nobody should underestimate him and he respects his opponent and he says that obviously he deserved where he is right now he deserved by beating
SPEAKER_02: his opponents like Zurab and prior to it Sasho so he says yeah we we know what happened and uh we know how strong he is and he's ready he's ready to take the title from you okay okay um I I have you could maybe you could yeah if you could also translate what but Gilly uh what I said about the medicalist opinion towards uh
SPEAKER_02: just quickly say that he like he respects and he thinks that he he deserves or he is
SPEAKER_04: He said he didn't have much time for this match, but he thinks you're a worthy opponent, a worthy champion. You beat Sasho, you beat Zurobo. He wants to show you a very beautiful and good fight. He knows how strong you are and you're a serious opponent for him.
SPEAKER_01: Thank you. First of all, hello BitKiller, I'm glad to see you. Well, what can I say? We'll show an interesting fight, I think it will be interesting, because you are actually quite strong and a little uncomfortable for me as an athlete, because I watched your fight. Well, I think I'll do something about it. Interesting, interesting opening.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, he said that I also respect you as an opponent, but you are very uncomfortable for me for your style. I have seen how you pull. So that is a little bit of concern to me. Maybe translate. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yes, I agree with you. You mentioned Easter, but I think you are right. I think you are right. I think you are right. I think you are right. I think you are right.
SPEAKER_02: and likewise but it is also sure that it will be a good good match to see and a good match for viewers to enjoy so now we can move on like uh usual usual podcast parts so we are done with the uh their match so to say and then we can move on now to the main our main card and main yeah no no wait wait wait wait wait we need a little bit a little bit more a little bit more about this match because if we come back
SPEAKER_04: i want to i want to ask like before we go to the rest of matches i i want to know where does artem thinks this um he can beat but keely fast we already saw how he dealt with someone who's really fast like he just stopped him ate him up and you know
SPEAKER_04: You were impressed by how fast Betkili actually was. Where this Artyom feels he has a better edge. Artyom, in the last match, Betkili was a very fast opponent, right? But Betkili, he was the first in two rounds, and then he didn't feel it at all, right? He twisted him in his position and that's it. What do you think?
SPEAKER_04: You have always been one of the fastest athletes in the world. You look at this fight that it will be a long, long fight. Because he can stop you very well and keep you there. You don't need to say the strategy, but how do you see it?
SPEAKER_01: Strategy is such a thing, maybe you know, when I told Sasho how I planned everything, and in the end everything went differently. Therefore, yes, there is, of course, a strategy of how to fight. I will try, of course, to win, well, quickly, but you yourself understand that this is a sport, everything can be anything, it can be a long-term fight. Of course, I don't like long-term fights, but still, I seem to have worked on my endurance, it seems to have been added to me, but I still know that
SPEAKER_01: It's not comfortable for me, because he's standing in such corners, fighting, and, accordingly, you can get discomfort. Therefore, I will try to do so that he does not go there.
SPEAKER_04: So he said like in the last match, like strategy, strategy, but sometimes you think about something and then you have to do completely different things. He said by looking at the Achilles style, he is very great at stopping his opponents and like...
SPEAKER_04: Artyom understands if he gets a stopped in that position that might not be good for him of course he wants to win fast but he understands there's a big threat of there so uh he doesn't know how he will fight it and he worked on his endurance he said but of course I don't want to get into the long long matches with someone who has great endurance like bit killy so he will try to win fast um
SPEAKER_04: Can you ask Betkili, last time he said he will be the first mover, is he worried about the speed of Taynov or it's not an issue? Most likely he will answer just like you asked this question, I think against Taynov, Talgat, but yeah, obviously I will answer that.
SPEAKER_02: Thank you very much, Tino. Petil, I would like to ask you this question. What do you think is the most important thing? What do you think is the most important thing? What do you think is the most important thing? What do you think is the most important thing? What do you think is the most important thing? What do you think is the most important thing?
SPEAKER_00: So he said he's trained in routine.
SPEAKER_02: His training routine has not changed much. He's trying to improve just like he used to prepare for the matches. And he said that I'm going to catch him successfully like I did with Talgat. And he said also when I started to translate, he also added, I'm not going to try to be faster in this round.
SPEAKER_04: In this match. I'll translate this to Artem. Artem, we asked about that kill last time. He said that he will be faster than Talbot. He was faster. I asked him what strategy he will use. He said that he is ready and working to, how to say, to catch you.
SPEAKER_01: And he won't try to be fast on the start, he will try to be fast on the position. Well, it's a kind of technique. I fight with some athletes like that, not with everyone. Sometimes it works, but I think he chose a not very good strategy.
SPEAKER_04: he said that is sometimes this strategy works i have done it myself but i don't think it will it's the best strategy for him to use against me
SPEAKER_02: He's like, we shall see, judging by his reaction. He's a man of few words. No matter how much we talk or how good we talk, the table shows the truth.
SPEAKER_04: that is why why waste the time of talking right uh table has never told lies right sometimes okay mostly well about 50 percent come on man you should give it at least 75 percent 50 percent okay 69 maximum maximum uh point
SPEAKER_02: okay because we are tight on schedule okay yeah we cannot just cheer here two hours now we can go we would like to show the matches all right let's let's start from most uh like uh the main event and then go down to the list right so first obviously our tomorrow's over in main main event um
SPEAKER_02: I will ask first Betkili, and then you could ask Daino. What do you think about the fact that Montenegro has become a part of the national team? It will be interesting to see, but... I think it's a good thing that the national team has become a part of the national team.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know if it's true or not, but I don't think it's true. I don't think it's true, but I don't think it's true, but I don't think it's true.
SPEAKER_02: somewhere around 55% he thinks Vitalii is favorite on right arm he struggled to remember if they ever had any match and he said that I don't believe they had any match could not recall and also he said they are both such arm wrestlers they can stylistically like can find something against each other
SPEAKER_02: and could adapt in between the rounds. But like he said at the beginning, he would slightly go towards to Vitalii. I think it was 55-55. All right. Artem, what do you think about the main fight of the evening? Vitalii Laletin vs. Artem Morozov. Right hand, right? Right hand, yes.
SPEAKER_01: Well, I'm leaning towards the victory of Laletin. It's an uncertain victory, because Morozov is gaining a lot of form now. So, it's not 50-50, but 60-40. Vitalii can still win. First of all, I think he's more resilient than Artem. So, I'm leaning towards Vitalii's victory.
SPEAKER_01: As far as I know, he had a small operation on his elbow after the injury, so I'm more inclined to win Vitalii.
SPEAKER_04: He said he leans more to the favor of Vitalii Laletin, about 60% to 40%. He believes Vitalii has maybe better endurance. But Arturo Morozov is all the time growing, all the time getting better. And Vitalii also had some injuries after Dave Chasey match, and he was slowly dealing with them. So he believes it will be a close match. It's about 60% to 40%, but in favor of Vitalii in his mind.
SPEAKER_04: The interesting thing is yesterday I talked with Oleg Petro and David Dadikyan, and they both said Morozov. Yeah, now they are both saying Vitalii, so it's a really good match. On paper, people are divided. Yes, I'll ask. Artem, yesterday I spoke with David Dadikyan and Oleg Petro. They said, they think it's Morozov.
SPEAKER_01: And we saw the note from that video shares the same thing.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, he said that if we would, if they would pull on left arm, I would give priority or favoritism to Artem Morozov, but they're pulling on right, so it goes to Vitalov. Nice. So second match would be Evgeny Prudnik versus Irakli Zirakashvili, that we would like to know these gentlemen's opinion. Raspi Krupetkili, Irakli, Prudnik is Karadzeos.
SPEAKER_00: In the ideal form, it is a fact, but it is very difficult. And I have to admit that, as I said before, it is very difficult to be a sportsman, and I know that. I think that you can do it if you want to.
SPEAKER_00: What do you think about Ankara? I don't know about Ankara. I don't know about Ankara. I don't know about Ankara. I don't know about Ankara. I don't know about Ankara.
SPEAKER_02: I asked precisely possible score as well, what could be, but he could not give the score. He said it would be great match. He is obviously wholeheartedly supporting Irakli. He said there is no doubt that Irakli is an awesome shape, best shape possible. He is really, really getting on the right path. That's been proven by his last several matches.
SPEAKER_02: And he also favors slightly Iraq. Could be, I'm not sure, it could be a bit biased because of how much he could support his fellow Georgians. However, there is obviously, judging by his opinion, he thinks that Iraq has skills to take the lead at this weight. Okay.
SPEAKER_02: yeah it's a it's also a divide divisive match right as more as i look at it yeah and i always i always kind of a bit skeptical rocket claims uh at 97 96 97 kg when he is he can pull anybody at 105.
SPEAKER_02: And he feels better at that weight. And if he's over 100, he feels not good. So I trust him because it's his body and we cannot tell him how he feels, obviously. So I'm intrigued. So he will come in much lighter, right? He will come in those 97, 90...
SPEAKER_04: I believe Prudnik will be at least 5 kg heavier. At least. At least. Prudnik is also not that heavy. Artem, what do you think about another super match between Irakli and Zhenya Prudnik?
SPEAKER_04: Up to 105 kg, but as I heard from Roman, he said that Irakli can be 97 kg. He said that he feels much better at 97 kg. Much more resilient too. Yes, he is thin. What do you think? Well, Irakli Zirakashvili has been surprising me lately. He is a phenomenal person.
SPEAKER_01: phenomenal strength and with not very large volumes will show just colossal strength technically he is monotonous but the technique is brought to such an ideal that it will be honestly difficult but taking into account the fact that Zhenya is a more versatile athlete
SPEAKER_01: I think maybe he'll win against Zarekishevili in the first fights, but then Prudnik will find the key and win against him. But it will be a very interesting fight. I think there will be a score, not a dry one, but a 2-4, 7 rounds, right?
SPEAKER_01: Maximum seven rounds. This is not a title. Two, three, one, four, one, something like that. Four-one is unlikely, up to three wins, but it will still be very interesting. Still, I think I'm leaning towards the victory of Evgeny.
SPEAKER_04: I'm not sure. I'm not sure. So he said this, Irakli first of all has been like all the time impressing him. The way he top rolls, the way he beats everyone is probably one of the best top rollers. But Evgeny Prudnik is so versatile and can pull many different styles and can find different keys. But he believes it will be back and forth match.
SPEAKER_04: Maybe not too one-sided. He said 3-1 Prudnik at the end. So he also believes it will not be one-sided. It will maybe take time for Prudnik to figure out how to beat Irakli. But he believes Prudnik is very impressive, especially at that weight.
SPEAKER_04: you've been watching arm wrestling forever um everyone's always been impressed by Evgeny and his ability to pull and he's probably one of the one of the best and uh how do you see that match
SPEAKER_02: oh man so there i see i find a bunch of sense so to say what artem just said that how he this how he predicted this match um and i i think like if it's uh it's good that uh artem asked if it's seven rounds or five rounds best of five i think uh as a versatility uh
SPEAKER_02: I think as endurance-wise, I believe Prudnik has an edge. I think even though Irakli is very, very good to pull three consecutive rounds, after three, we can still see there is a drop, at least what I think, right? This is my personal opinion. And so if it was best of seven, if it goes like 3-3 and then a zero bullet, I believe Prudnik has more chance to win seven-round match.
SPEAKER_02: However, this is best of five in this case, no title match, right? So I think for Irakli's highest chance is beginning rounds. So either Irakli takes this 3-0, like I'm saying it right now, because I don't think Irakli can somehow in fourth round come back with the flock press. Turn it around. So...
SPEAKER_02: if it's two two that's what uh if it's like two one and it goes back and forth like for decisive even decisive fifth round I don't think that uh tired that you directly kill could do this like he did against John because uh doing that against John is not doing that against uh so
SPEAKER_02: uh so that's what i said either iraqi wins this three no in my opinion like all three rounds uh or it could be good match great match two two nil iraqi and then three two for proving so if iraqi can't win third round i believe it will take off so first two rounds i believe you are giving me then then there is the question
SPEAKER_02: That's my opinion. We shall see. If he can manage to keep it together. Yeah, because I've seen practice pools. Yeah, I've seen some practice. Evgeny though some people claim this is just practice pool, I agree with that. That's obviously they are just practice pool. And Reno Masic, I love that guy. He is most deceiving when he's practice pooling. He roughly smashed him at practice pool. But what he did to Bacho when it came like one month later or so,
SPEAKER_02: He really surprised me. So even though on practice, Irakli was really good against Bacho, against Levan, against everybody else, it's still hard to say. But I would lean on, like I said, 2-0 and then either 3-0 or 3-2-4. Irakli, what do you think about the fact that you were able to win the match against a very comfortable opponent?
SPEAKER_00: There is one problem that I have with it. The second one is the problem of discrimination. It has been a long time since I was born. When I was a child, I used to have a lot of discrimination against me. And you still have it. Yes, I still have it, and I still have a lot of discrimination against me. That's what I think. In parallel, when I was a child,
SPEAKER_00: It's a fact, Prudnik. It's just that it's not possible to do anything about it. It's not possible to do anything about it? It's not possible to do anything about it. It's impossible to do anything about it.
SPEAKER_02: so uh basically just uh i guess he he knows uh good enough english he understood what i was saying about uh endurance when i compared these two uh athletes he said that uh the the weight that iraqi will be pulling if he will be pulling at uh 97 kg iraqis endurance will be uh elevated than he was when he used to pull david at 105 and
SPEAKER_02: john brzenk so he said that uh because of weight drop for iraqli he gained speed and gained endurance as well and he would be on pair on pair with pronix so it won't be like phoenix will win because of their endurance that's but in his opinion so yeah we could we could also move so um i remember okay go ahead
SPEAKER_02: Ray, he's asking to his opponent, how does he like that their match is not five but best of seven?
SPEAKER_04: He asks Artyom how does Artyom feel about it. Badkiddy asks you how you feel because your match is best of 7, right? It can be a maximum of 7 rounds, not 5. How do you feel about it? 5 was better for you?
SPEAKER_01: Of course, yes. For me, 5 was better. Because the fight with Sasho gave it to show. But with Zurab it was more comfortable, so to speak. There were already 7 fights. There were already 7 fights. As a result, 4-0. I will try to do everything as quickly as possible. And then we'll see. But 7 is 7. Everyone is in the same conditions.
SPEAKER_04: He said, of course, five would be much better for me. Like we saw in the match versus Sasho, the later rounds made him tired. With Zurab, he felt more comfortable there. But he said rules are the same for everyone. We're in the same boat, both of us. So we both have to fight and win four rounds to be the champ. So, yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: If I would pull Betkely, I would want the best player. If I would pull Betkely, I would want the best player. If I would pull Betkely, I would want the best player.
SPEAKER_02: And he appreciated that Taino admits that he would prefer a five-round match. Okay. Next match would be David Tarekin versus Oleg Petro. That's what I would ask. And also, like, if we are tight on the schedule today, unfortunately, guys, but if we are able, I would like to ask...
SPEAKER_02: like top five matches of this event and then also john versus leonidas for the uh um august event i would i would really love to hear their opinion that if we have time maybe even jerry versus alex it's so next match yeah we it depends how how fast we can uh how fluent we can go the next event the next match um david uh again versus oleg franco that's because
SPEAKER_00: They are very, very strong. They hit me in the biceps. They hit me in the biceps. I thought they were going to beat me. They were going to beat me. I thought they were going to beat me. They were going to beat me.
SPEAKER_00: This is a Swedish-Swedish match, right? Yes, I think so. And I think it's very obvious that one of my opponents, Dadikyan, is very close to Dadikyan. There are many years between them, and Dadikyan was very close to Dadikyan when he was five years old. Now it's obvious that Dadikyan is going to leave.
SPEAKER_02: Uh huh. He, he begun with the, um, how strong these both athletes are like sheer power. They have raw strength, right?
SPEAKER_02: uh and but the the way the reason why he leans towards to more towards to david is the uh uh seven rounds he said that uh endurance would be the key for the title defense for david and he said that had it been five rounds match uh pedrico would be favorite in betty's eyes
SPEAKER_02: But this is a seven-round supermatch, so it will be a really, really big challenge for Oleg's endurance. So that's why he thinks that David, because of the endurance, will be a good winner. Artyom, who do you think is the favorite, Dadikyan or Petro? He's also not in the match.
SPEAKER_01: It's an interesting fight. I can't predict much. David is strong, Oleg is also strong. I'll just watch. I won't make any plans.
SPEAKER_01: I'll probably choose David. He's faster, he's fast, he's good at finishing off. He has these jerks that are not very pleasant. I understand it myself, when you're fighting against them, it's very unpleasant. So I think David has a small advantage. And Pogonol is from Livyansk.
SPEAKER_04: he said he leans more to David that he can and he said that because of his style he's much faster and way he hits is very uncomfortable he said very very uncomfortable and ability to go where he wants is much better on David that he can but he believes both of them are extremely strong and he said David is a champion for a reason and Petro doesn't look much weaker in any point but he leans a little bit more to David hmm
SPEAKER_02: Krasimir vs Todd on the right hand, up to 105 kg. On the right hand? Well, yes, on the right hand. Well, due to the fact that I fought Krasimir for a long time, it's been a little more than a year,
SPEAKER_01: That's the one. That's the one that Hutchings has to win. So... And I think the victory will be... Well, confident and quite... Well, not that easy, but 4-0. If it's a starter. If it's not a starter, it's 3-0. It's not a starter, it's 3-0. It's 3-0, yes.
SPEAKER_04: He said it will be a victory for Todd Hutchings, 3-0. He said it's not going to be like very easy, but it will be very one-sided anyway. What do you think about that? It's a 2-1, 2-1. I think it's going to be a good game. I think it's going to be a good game.
SPEAKER_02: He believes it's a 50-50 match, good match. Throughout the history of their pulling, they have always been pulling good matches and he thinks that it will be close. It is really like not certain how the match will go, who will be victorious. So 50-50 is his opinion.
SPEAKER_02: all right uh and uh travis pageant versus sergey kalinchenko
SPEAKER_01: Not as strong as he was before, because even I fought with him before, I beat him, and he won't gain the form that he used to have. So, I'm just as sure that Sergey will win. But the show will be beautiful, they will give him heat, I'm sure it will be good.
SPEAKER_04: said with all the respect to travis um i have even fought with travis myself that adam said and i have beaten him the form that he used to have he most likely will not be showing it on the event and i believe sergey are gonna win but you guys gonna see amazing show nonetheless so it's it's gonna be a great match there yeah yeah
SPEAKER_00: It's been a long time since I last saw you, and I don't know what you look like. You look like you're wearing the same uniform as me, but you're wearing a different one. You look like you're wearing the same uniform as me. You look like you're wearing the same uniform as me, but you're wearing a different one.
SPEAKER_02: Thank you for your performance. It was a pleasure. I would like to thank you in the comments. It was a pleasure.
SPEAKER_02: So he said, well, he disagrees with Artem on this one in case of if Travis manages to become somewhat close to his good shapes, good times, he for sure will win. But it's a huge question mark, huge question mark, whether how, whether he manages to get the good shape or not. Plus, it's so like a high level competition.
SPEAKER_02: highest level comeback match for him from after this long pause and odds are really against him but but he still thinks it's it's question either uh travis got his good form and he will for sure wins or it will be a big trouble for him so he is not sure but he is uh kind of uh slowly um slightly towards to travis that he could manage to get close to his good shape uh i think one very big match
SPEAKER_04: Artem you going to Sasho and David? Oh, yeah, for sure. Yeah, I'm looking at the schedule. I'm thinking which match. I think you skipped it. You went under. So for me, this is probably. Oh, really? Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: What is their weight category? 85 kg? Yes.
SPEAKER_01: Well, I think David will have to give up his train, because Sasho is a strong guy, and you can't underestimate him. Evgeny if he loses weight, I think he won't lose a lot of weight, 3-4 kilograms. So I think it won't be easy, but I think Sasho will win. But if David wins, he will surprise me very much.
SPEAKER_04: He said that I think it's a time for David Samushia to give up his belt and give it to Sasho. Evgeny though Sasho will have to cut some weight, he's extremely strong, especially in his position. But if David manages to beat him, that will be extremely big surprise for me. And he's extremely strong. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: All right. Betkili, the guy mentioned the jacks in the comments that actually Prokopchuk felt how strong Betkili's hook is and he just wanted to see the reaction. And he says that he praises Betkili's hooking capability. It's coming from Prokopchuk, the king of the hook at his weight class, right? So I'll also translate this.
SPEAKER_02: I would like to make a comment on Daniel's point about the fact that the world is not the same as it used to be. Thank you. I would like to make a comment about my childhood.
SPEAKER_02: He said that he remembers that hook battle with him back in kid times, child times. Anyways, Raspi Krupp, Davit Smadze, Sasho Sinalbek, Missy Metzhre. It is ninth, right? It's ninth time on defense. Yes, ninth, ninth. Insane. It's crazy.
SPEAKER_00: It's hard to say if it's true or not, but that's the way it is. It's hard to say if it's true or not, but that's the way it is. It's hard to say if it's true or not, but that's the way it is. It's hard to say if it's true or not, but that's the way it is.
SPEAKER_00: Evgeny though he is in a new job, I think he will be able to do it. He will be able to do it. He will be able to do it. He will be able to do it.
SPEAKER_02: He's basically saying that Sasho may be feeling comfortable against David and that is why he's dropping weight and he's sure that he would beat Adam Shaw. However, in Betkili's opinion, Sasho will be disappointed because in Betkili's opinion, we have still yet to see
SPEAKER_02: Samushia's peak peak shape and he's progressing he's not like stagnating at his uh uh shape so it will be a long match he believes it will be a close battle it will be a back and forth it will be really tough challenge however he thinks that Sasho's uh um no matter how hard he would try he will be unable he will not manage to take the belt from the champ that is basically his opinion uh and
SPEAKER_02: i would obviously like to finish up uh however one one match john versus leonidas i just want to know i really want to know from the uh ovest event okay um and i'll i'll ask captain okay we'll start it martin uh august uh leonidas arcona против jonah brazenka uh ssh
SPEAKER_04: You saw Leonidas against Skubal. He won. We didn't expect it to be like this, but he won decently, beautifully. What do you think, maybe John or Leonidas at a different level? Will it be in the 105 category? No, weightless. Oh, weightless. Yes. Well, to be honest, it will probably be very difficult for John.
SPEAKER_04: He said that first he asked, will it be 205? I said, no, no, no, most likely it's going to be Levanidis will come in way bigger, not way too big, but bigger. And he said, there's a good chance that John can lose this one, but I'm 100% on his support and I hope he will win.
SPEAKER_04: yeah but I believe Leon is oh yeah I believe Leon is one one uh 120 kg yeah and he will not go bigger he will be like that I think and John I think will be 100 uh something 110 12 something like that that's what he's gonna come in
SPEAKER_02: So, and from Betkili we can hear the opinion. What do you think, in August, August 10th is the 14th of August, and the next match is Johnny vs Leonidas. So, it's not your fault, right? No. Leonidas is a good match for the club, because he's a very good player. I don't know what to say about Johnny's match, I don't know.
SPEAKER_02: he he precisely said that uh considering how leon pulled against a school boy um alexander first time ever saying his name um he said that uh i can tell leon is more like outside cooler just like you mentioned right more outside poor and uh
SPEAKER_02: He said, moreover, it is extremely dangerous to play against John's hand when you are outside puller, when you try to pull outside. And he finalized his thought by saying Leon cannot defeat John's hand three times in a row.
SPEAKER_02: and it will be hard task for him and outside pulling he cannot he cannot approach you if he's hoping if he just consistently sticks to uh leon or sticks to his uh the way he pulls he will not succeed that would be that would be a great match um oh man and this north america event vengeance phrase crazy cards but yeah that would be there would be a wrap up probably right there right
SPEAKER_04: we we have anything obviously we have a bunch of matches left out but we are all uh limited in limited times and i hope chat enjoyed i love both of these guys i think they're both awesome they both pull completely different styles which is amazing i can't wait for this battle uh whoever whoever wins it will definitely deserve it to be 95 kilo east versus west world champion that's just my opinion i think both of you are
SPEAKER_02: Awesome. I share. I share the opinion likewise now.
SPEAKER_02: so uh that would be bye bye i guess for now and soon we will see each other uh ray medu tomorrow hopefully uh we can rock their live stream with david samushia and sasho uh yeah around uh around this time that we did today but we should tomorrow also also girls gonna go live uh melon yes
SPEAKER_04: Thank you, Artyom. Thank you. I was glad to see you. Thank you for talking to me. Artyom Sutkhar, I wish you all the best. I wish you all the best.
SPEAKER_02: He said, Artyom, good luck. Good luck to you, my friend. And for me, he said himself, for Betkili Oniani, this will be the great, great, if not the greatest match. This will be a really great match for him. And he wishes all good. Thank you. Thank you. I understand. Okay, guys. Stay strong. Love Armwrestling. Bye. Stay strong at Love Armwrestling.
