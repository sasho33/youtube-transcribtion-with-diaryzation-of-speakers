SPEAKER_02: Hello, guys. Hello. You hear me? Hello, Vladimir. Yeah, hello. Yeah, can you turn your camera? One moment. Your camera, yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, you need to. Well,
SPEAKER_03: You need to push the screen for camera. Yes. Hello. Can you turn also your phone, telephone side? Yes. How are you? Good.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, yeah. Good. All right. And I think Adam is here too, but we will do, I think, without the translator 10 minutes, because we all start early.
SPEAKER_00: Hi. Hello, gentlemen. Can you all hear me? Yes, yes. How are you, Adam? I'm well. How are you? Good, good, good. Good to see you. Yes, good to see you again. Yeah, soon to see you in person once again. Yes. We're about less than a month out, huh? A couple weeks. Yeah, yeah. 28 days. Yeah. Yes.
SPEAKER_04: vladimir the translator paulo uh 10 minutes it will come okay so yeah i will talk a little bit with uh adam adam how is the weight going are you under 200 already or well i'm a little over but my weight's been great i've been sitting at about
SPEAKER_00: 203 to 205 pounds for the past six to eight weeks. And, um, you know, actually the last time I made the cut, I thought that I could have been a little heavier. Now looking back, you know, I probably didn't need to slim down as much as I did. So I'm going to see if I can do it from maybe about 202 instead of 199, 200. So, uh,
SPEAKER_00: You're talking about after the weigh-in? Yeah, well, I mean, I do a water cut like Paul, you know, and all those other guys. So last time I water cut from about 199, 200 pounds. Maybe this time a little bit heavier to a couple more pounds, if I can. Yeah. Yeah. Hello, Paolo. Good to see you. Hi, Adam. Привет, Владимир. Hey. What's going on?
SPEAKER_04: yeah not much not much all good healing training translating sometimes yeah the best translator uh shane owen says that hello engin adam warsinski is in an excellent form it will be an easy day for him um i don't know who's gonna win i i don't know he's gonna win but i i don't think that anyone will have an easy easy day um affecting one no sir
SPEAKER_04: Can you ask Vladimir? I hear that he is in excellent form right now. This is what I hear from other people. Pavlo, can you also tell him to put the phone somewhere to stay?
SPEAKER_01: Is it possible? If not possible, it's okay. Vladimir, if you have a place to put the phone, so that it doesn't wobble, so that it stands straight, but if not, then you hold it in your hands and the image wobbles. Well, it's a bit difficult. I'll try to come up with something now. In 50 minutes. Yes, I have a stand. Here it is.
SPEAKER_02: I'll do it now, everything will be fine. Okay, but what about the form? The form is good, but this is an intermediate form, that is, I can only say that the measurement or something else was done,
SPEAKER_02: made by me, that is, without rest, yes, well, as it were, I was satisfied with the results, so well, really, I practically returned my best form
SPEAKER_01: Okay, okay, yeah, Vladimir is saying that he's in good shape, whatever measurements he did, he's satisfied, but he is saying this is still a middle form, even he's in his almost best shape, but he said that it's middle form, meaning that he will get back...
SPEAKER_04: yes yes okay so he says that he may be in the best shape but he thinks that he can improve a lot more yes okay okay and adam how are you how is how is yours like how is it compared to the last time you see you you think you will be stronger yeah i'm there's no question i'm much stronger i am much more efficient at this weight than i was the last time um
SPEAKER_00: back in january december i was having a little bit of bicep issue but um i've been pain free for months now so i'm i'm ready to roll see your opponent is already training well uh well he's only at his middle form so so i would hope so you know he would need to yeah and do you think that you can be in a form that when you pull against uh bojidar
SPEAKER_00: Oh, I'm better than that. Oh, even you will cut to 187, but you will perform better than your 92-kilo shape because some of the weight loss will be temporary. Yeah, I've paid a lot more attention to my body composition. I've put a lot more into my diet, and I'm walking around with more muscle mass at this lower weight than I was at an even heavier weight back in just six months ago.
SPEAKER_01: Do you do any weightlifting? Sorry, sorry, Valdo, go ahead.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. And Adam, do you train with weights? Yeah. Yeah. I have a, I have a gym in my, um, in my home, a separate, um, a separate garage with all kinds of weight equipment, but it's more an arm wrestling gym. Uh, but yeah, I've, I've trained with weights all my life, so I'm very, you know, very conditioned. How is your form? Like with the weight, like you, you telling me your form, like,
SPEAKER_00: From table training or you talk about the weight lifts or you talk about both? More so arm wrestling form. Um, but even weight training, uh, you know, I'm moving around weights, you know, heavier weights more efficiently. I mean, I don't really train with a specific lift and try to improve it to a certain degree. I don't really measure that way. Um, my training's more integrated, so.
SPEAKER_00: but, but yeah, I definitely feel I'm in a better form. I'm a lot healthier now than I was a couple months ago. Like I said, I was dealing with some, with some issues and, you know, it's been gone for a while now. So.
SPEAKER_01: Ok, Pavel, you can translate if you want. Vladimir, they asked about Adam's training. How do you measure your form? He said he doesn't measure the weights that I lift, because it's all included in the training program.
SPEAKER_01: What do we weight now, Adam?
SPEAKER_00: um i was i was 205 pounds this morning so that's what 90 93. yeah yeah so
SPEAKER_04: Since the competition in 90 kilos, so he just needs to lose 3 kilos. Can you tell this to Vladimir? I'm joking, I'm joking. Because Vladimir is the guy that very, very tensely won for 100 grams, you know.
SPEAKER_04: and he's like either he's just like too strict so i just wanted to give him a little uh excitement you know just he says he says set me up against anyone as long as it is 85.0
SPEAKER_04: Yeah. And can you tell, can you ask Vladimir? He's talked about his form, like very good, everything, but how much increase does he think since the time that he pulled against Samushia? How do you think, how much time did you add to yourself? In short, I can say this. In strength, I added maybe 5%, 10% maximum.
SPEAKER_02: strength when, for example, I fought with my husband, I was very unbearable now, for the last time, well, all the time that I trained, in the first month of January, I quickly regained my strength conditions, and then I trained the functional, so that I had this strength, which in one good
SPEAKER_02: Yes, I could stretch for the whole fight. Not like with my husband, that I fought one fight and died.
SPEAKER_01: he's saying that his actual strength and power uh depends how to measure somewhere between five and ten percent better but he said that he grew that strength and power relatively fast and all the rest of the time he's been working on conditioning and endurance so this power will not decrease during the match like with samusha he's saying
SPEAKER_01: that he okay he did okay in the first round and then he died basically so he's saying right now he's ready to be at the same level of power throughout the match yeah that is um can you ask um alexander i'm joking
SPEAKER_01: What does he think? What does he think? How does he think about that, you know, Alexander thing? Can you ask him? Vladimir, yes. The English shooter says, ask Alexander. He says, well, I'm kidding, of course, we laughed. What do you think about this whole situation with Alexander? I, how is it called, well, positively.
SPEAKER_02: Well, if it happened that he confused me, well, I don't consider myself big, I consider myself small, yes, therefore, well, as if, well, a person, in the sense, yes, therefore, well, I was not offended, yes, because it is not surprising, yes, that there was a person who confused me, well, you think I confused, as if I was not offended.
SPEAKER_01: On the contrary, I was a little hyped about it. I even wrote about it on Instagram. Yeah, Vladimir's saying that, no, I think it's all positive. And if he made a mistake, you know, I'm not something big of the deal. I'm a little human being. So I even hype up a little bit on Instagram because of this mistake. So, no, it's all positive. It's all cool. So he finds this funny, huh? Yeah, he found this funny.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Can you ask him, did he, like, like whenever I set a match for Sasho, he is like, he is focused on himself. He doesn't really follow people generally, is what he told me. How is Vladimir? Like, he only focuses on how good he is, how well he is, good, he thinks he can beat everyone? Or does he also analyze his opponents, which is
SPEAKER_04: the normal thing to do it? And if yes, then what does he think about Adam Wozniacki? Where does he see the advantages, disadvantages, you know? What's his analysis about Adam?
SPEAKER_01: I don't pay much attention to my opponents and athletes. I focus more on myself and my style to become stronger. What about you?
SPEAKER_01: Do you watch your opponents? Do you analyze them in order to know how to fight and where to fight? Or do you also concentrate more on your training? And if you analyze, what do you think about Adam as an athlete? And where will it be easier, where will it be harder? What are the prospects of the fight? Well, let's do it in two parts.
SPEAKER_02: about I will say so I analyze I analyze the opponents in any case, yes, that is, I am a lady, too, but at the same time I always look at where I can, well, I have my strengths, I improve them
SPEAKER_02: Or, for example, on the contrary, when I have improved my strengths well, I understand that I will not gain much in them now, then, for example, I switch to the weak sides and gain in the weak side, and the strong side is just in the supporting mode. Thus, I close the hole for myself. For example, if I fought with David Samushia, then, for example, before the fight, I can give, let's say,
SPEAKER_02: Well, a maximum of 110-105 kilograms, then now, for example, in the last workout, I reached 130 kilograms in bench press with a narrow grip. I don't focus on bench press, but it was my weak side. When I grew up in my corners, gained strength, I knew that my bench press was weak, I knew that, for example, the same Adam,
SPEAKER_02: physically developed, that is, he is strong and strong, he has a good body and for this I, as it were, made a small emphasis on the direction of the push, thereby, as it were, I pulled up my weak side
SPEAKER_01: Okay, it's gonna be two parts. So first part is, yes, he analyzing his opponents and yes, he's seeing which way to go. And his training concentration himself is usually on his strong parts.
SPEAKER_01: And it's taking usually less amount of time to bring them all the way to the peak form. And then when they are basically at the peak form, he's concentrating on his weak parts to close the holes in his technique as much as possible. For example, when he's been armwrestling Samushia, he was benching narrow grip, like 105 kg.
SPEAKER_01: as a training process and when he saw and analyzed adam that he's physically uh developed and he have a very good core and strong human being overall he started concentrating on his bench press to bring his overall form uh you know to certain level and now he added up to 130 kilos at the same exercise so that's how close grip yes that's how he
SPEAKER_02: preparing overall process of preparation to some certain super pitch. Now it's going to be a part two. Yes, I'm ready for the second part. Well, about Adam himself, I watched, unfortunately, not so many of his videos, and not so many people know him. But from the videos that I saw, I analyzed that he has a strong biceps,
SPEAKER_02: I fought with such people, I have no idea how to fight with such a person. And so I made some conclusions for myself, realizing that I will have to do something difficult. I did everything I could in training to overcome his strong sides, and then it will work out.
SPEAKER_01: Okay. Yeah, after analyzing Adam, he saw not too many videos, unfortunately, and not too many people knows Adam as of right now, but whatever he could find, he analyzed it, and he knows that Adam has
SPEAKER_01: extremely strong biceps and he you know Vladimir pulled similar people before and he knows you know he had a plan he knows how to pull those people and he understand that it's not going to be easy by any you know means and he addressed this on in his training process that's all you can say
SPEAKER_02: What does he expect? Does he expect that this match will go to an endurance game? Vladimir, do you think that this match will end with a fight for endurance? A game for endurance? I think that I won't be able to... I think that I won't be able to... You see, I don't know what kind of weight he's doing.
SPEAKER_02: I didn't even stand close to those people with whom he fought. I can only theoretically see that he fought with that, he fought with that, with that, with that. And there, this chain, it stretches a lot and I can't evaluate it like that. And it seems to me that we will stand for a long time and the one who is more resilient or more technical will win.
SPEAKER_01: vladimir uh cannot uh answer this question for sure because uh vladimir never pulled anybody who pulled adam before and he cannot you know analyze direct make a direct analysis but but by what he saw on the matches he think it's yes going to be an endurance game because he he did not say this but he meant it that he it will not be possible to flash pin and then it's going to be endurance game or
SPEAKER_04: uh prolongated match who is more technical in you know in the match yeah during the match yeah okay and Adam how about you uh did you analyze your opponent or you are just so confident with yourself and you just do your thing and you don't care about you know what your opponent is doing um I mean it's a little bit of both I mean you know me again I'm somebody who you know anytime I'm paired up against somebody I make them my mountain and
SPEAKER_00: Vladimir is that to me? I mean, I, you know, I've seen a little bit of footage out there. Um, mainly the Samushia match and I've seen some Zloty of 2018. I think it was the year at a little bit lighter. Check check check Moldova 2018. Okay. Moldova 2018. I'll, I'll remember that. Um, Moldova 2018, he won 80 kilo. Second was Bozhidar. Third was Clement Dimitrina.
SPEAKER_00: Fourth was Krasovski's and fifth was Irakli Zirakashvili. Wow. So I mean, yeah. We're talking about 80 kilo Irakli Zirakashvili. Right, right, right. I mean, yeah, he's very tough. His style is, you know, he pulls very similar to me, slightly different. But, you know, it's just stuff I address. Of course, my main focus is on myself. You know, I don't really worry too much about my opponent.
SPEAKER_00: Um, but, but he's a, he's a tough guy and he's somebody who, you know, I, I definitely gonna have to utilize every single day of training up until the match to be capable of beating him. So I'm looking forward to it. I'm looking forward to the challenge and it's my second match at eight kilograms. And, um, I believe I can be a lot more efficient this time around than I was almost a year ago. Yeah. Do you, you want to translate shortly?
SPEAKER_01: I asked the same question to Adam. He said, well, half and half. Yes, of course, I looked a little at Vladimir's matches, mainly at Samushia, and looked a little at Zloty Tur, I think, in 2018.
SPEAKER_01: Engin immediately laughed a little and said, look at Moldova 2018, it will be interesting. I said, well, you know, I looked, of course, but basically I concentrate on my strengths and on the training process, on how I am ready. Because opponents say different things, sometimes I have the style as it is and I have to be ready in my style. And he says, I try to use it every day.
SPEAKER_01: okay is this something yeah ready ready for what
SPEAKER_04: continue i just translate everything okay okay proving astrology is asking thank you for your super chat and what are your thoughts on much to water cuts i have a resting background for this class a 10 pound water cut seems aggressive but reasonable however 15 even with 24 hours to recover i think he says it's too much but in arm wrestling always the way in is day before the
SPEAKER_04: uh competition so um i mean that's how it is you know even 36 hours you know you we weigh in day before morning and the competition is next day evening yeah anyway so engine is brian show invited yes he was invited but he also have show classic um and i think he's uh he's focusing there yeah anyway so
SPEAKER_04: Let's continue. Adam, is Vladimir your only target right now? I know you need to focus on the next one, but do you have a new just lay your head to bed time to time that title match comes to your mind soon or late? Of course. I mean, you know,
SPEAKER_00: everybody has a trajectory in the sport, right? And I mean, mine is to become the number one guy in the world at my weight, you know, and to accomplish that mission, I have to realize what's set before me and that's this match in 28 days, you know? So, but of course, I mean, everybody has their overall goals and that's mine, you know, at this, I think it's,
SPEAKER_04: close enough within reach to realize that it's a realistic goal, but, um, one step at a time, one step at a time. Yeah. And, and, um, there is no easy match at the East versus West. East versus West is like, really, like I was just thinking like to come back, pull 85 kilos or something like every day I see like my hopes for my own
SPEAKER_04: It's just going like, yeah, whenever I see that Aydar Khan, now Sasho is there, Samushia, yourself, Vladimir, even Greg Tuller and all those guys, that category is just incredible, you know, level, yeah. Yeah. But that is, I'm telling you, as we men, you know, we are responsible to be brave and fight, you know.
SPEAKER_00: they see what happens happens you know just we can't all win right yeah it's a big dog fight there's a lot of competitors in that pool and yeah it's it's only getting better i mean it's crazy that sasha is down that way coming down that weight now too you know that throws a big big wrench in everybody's plans yep what do you think that someday you versus tasha would be good you versus
SPEAKER_00: uh sasho you versus vladimir these are all incredible matches okay yeah all you need to do is just to balance the match you know like the stop and then then a big war that's what i'm hoping that's that's that's what i've been good at so we'll hope that that happens you know but but has a lot of endurance now and he's he's very sticky so it it may not be good it may not be wise for me to sit there so yeah um
SPEAKER_01: Pavel, can you ask... Sorry, sorry, yeah, go ahead. I'll just make a couple bullet points, so Vladimir is part of the conversation. Vlad, Engin asked Adam, how do you feel about it, do you dream of a title match? He said, of course, I dream, I make plans and so on, but now...
SPEAKER_01: It's the next step. We'll see how it goes. Then Engin said, listen, there are no easy matches at these competitions, not all of them are difficult. A lot of good athletes came. Evgeny my hopes that I will return to the level become less and less. Engin always says that. So yes, let's go ahead. They talked about Sasho, that he comes to lose weight, he will also be in the same category. Well, all the matches are very interesting.
SPEAKER_04: It was such a conversation. Engin, what's the question? Of course, it doesn't really make sense, but does Vladimir think that with this shape, if we had a time machine and go back, travel, and he puts Samushia that match again, but with this shape, does he think that with this shape he would win?
SPEAKER_01: So it means that he also has, like Adam, plans to come back and beat everyone.
SPEAKER_04: So basically, this is just like a preparation to do something tough. I really hope that people understand how great this match is, Paolo. These are very special human beings in the world and they are just there. Vladimir.
SPEAKER_01: How do you generally find East vs West competition? Vladimir, I have a question for you. How do you find, how do you see in general the East-West competition? In the sense, all together, rules, participants? Well, I would, well, as a whole,
SPEAKER_02: as they say, a five, but, as they say, you can always improve something, in particular, such an unexpected question from an ordinary person, but, as they say, I would, for example, somehow, I don't know, this one, although no, the selection is also normal, everything happens,
SPEAKER_02: I don't know, I need to think to answer. Everything is okay now, but I have thoughts, but I'm not ready to voice them now entirely.
SPEAKER_01: uh vladimir said uh if you're asking my opinion in general it's five so five out of five it's you know uh but instead you're asking uh about improvements he started thinking and he's like no this is good and that's good you know i will uh give me a little bit of time and if you need some opinion about what kind of improvements i would make i know
SPEAKER_01: the question is the level level the difficult level of the competition not not not the yeah that's what he says like the hardness the toughness he says
SPEAKER_02: but in short, I want to say really, well, how to say, it's really not just high, but a very high level and it's how to say it logically why because where there is money there and the strongest come if you take boxing like this, for example, then everyone knows that
SPEAKER_02: 99% of people who achieved success in boxing are poor people who wanted to become wealthy from poverty. The same is true here. People are strongly motivated by the fact that they have money, and this is what makes a high level right away. They raise a lot.
SPEAKER_01: And the answer is that you're trying to, he said, I understand Engin is trying to make a price for himself a little bit higher, but there is no need to. Your event is of the highest level and the toughest competitors. And every time that some event will bring the money into it, it will grow.
SPEAKER_01: all the way to the highest level and uh if you will take a look at the boxing events uh the uh usually the poorest guys making the very top of everything because they wanted the most and your event is on the highest level right now on toughest competitive competitors and most likely because the money start uh start to be involved at the certain level yeah yeah yeah and
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, let's go about match predictions. Let's start, Adam. Artem Taranenko versus Tom Rosic, left arm. Do you know Tom? Yeah, I know Tom. I don't know. I haven't seen much on his left arm. But, you know, Artem's left has really impressed me over the past couple of years. So I got to give the edge to him.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, you said that you didn't see much. Paolo, should I inform him or no? Sure, yes. Okay. Tom just sent Oleg Dzok to the B side, the Europeans, but in the final, he gave him some tough time, but Oleg won. Oh, wow. I mean... It's the same reaction. Who was it? Tatasins gave the same reaction, right? Yeah. I mean, it's... He's good.
SPEAKER_00: artem is just so versatile and you know it's going to be a great match i i don't know i can't give you a two three or one three i don't know but i i'm gonna give the edge artem i think he's gonna find a way yeah he's his unto unorthodox style maybe problem yeah and what does what does uh vladimir thing thompson artyom taranenko
SPEAKER_01: Okay. Vladimir says that I will not give you prediction because I'm not really familiar with athletes, especially from the West. He knows Artyom, but he doesn't know Thompson. Can you also inform me about that?
SPEAKER_01: Tom just won the Europeans with right arm and left arm. He beat Oleg Zhokh in one match. Yes, Tom won the right arm in the European competitions, in the European Championship. And he took the second place after Zhokh on the left arm. And one time he defeated Zhokh, but the second time in the final Zhokh didn't win. Yes, I just saw him. I can't give an assessment because I don't know in what form Taranenko is. I know that he is good.
SPEAKER_04: He doesn't know the shape of Artyom Taranenko, so he will not give a prediction. Okay, let's go. Carolina Pettersson versus Olga Terpelova. I don't know enough about either or. I've never seen. If you don't know, you don't need to say anything. I can't give an accurate prediction.
SPEAKER_04: Sorry. And Maiorov? Carolina Pettersson and Terpelova, Olga. Terpelova, of course, is Russian, from Crimea. Yeah, he said Terpelova. It's because of the... Yeah, okay. Okay, this one I only want the score prediction. Adam Orsinski, Vladimir Maiorov.
SPEAKER_02: Well, I can say that, well, I will say so, yes, that there is always a chance, but I understand for myself that I don't know in what form he is, yes, as I said, yes, or well, he will come there, he will have to drive a lot,
SPEAKER_02: But I can say for myself that I will feel a little more confident than when I fought with my husband. Because when I arrived, well, I said that I gained good strength, but I didn't have endurance then, and everything got better, yes, in general. Tell the account. What account? Tell the account, what account?
SPEAKER_00: So, long story short, he will give up one or two rounds. Everything else is his. And Adam? 3-1, either way. What do you mean, either way? Well, you said... You didn't say give a winner, so whoever...
SPEAKER_00: I can't tell you who the winner is, but I'll tell you. You are saying it's the 50-50 match, and one will win 3-1. The winner will be 3-1. Okay, but who's going to be the winner? You didn't ask for the winner. Okay, now I'm asking. Now you're asking for the winner? Well, I mean, I don't fly over the Atlantic Ocean to lose, so that's all I'm going to leave it with. Okay, okay, yeah, yeah. I need to hear that. Okay.
SPEAKER_04: Okay, Zurab Tauber is Petro Marharint. Vladimir. Marharint. Marharint. This is right arm? Right arm, yeah. Right arm, yeah. Do you remember Petro Marharint? He had a match last event against Georgian. This is Zurab's first match back, right?
SPEAKER_00: yeah yeah i gotta give it to i mean i love zurab but i gotta give it to petro because i don't know i don't know how good zurab i don't know where he's at you know uh-huh and dimitrina petrova ayane kakenaka do you know
SPEAKER_04: Okay, Dimitrina is the 60-kilo world champion. Ayane is the 55-kilo world champion from Japan. Dimitrina is from Bulgaria. But if you guys don't have any idea, then we can go on. Do you guys have any, Adam? No. Okay. And Artem Taynov vs. Betkili Oniani, left arm. 95-kilo world title match. Yes, I know.
SPEAKER_04: Taynov. Both of them say Taynov. Okay. Is Vladimir's opinion objective or subjective? Vladimir. Objective. Do you think objectively? Yes. Objective. Okay. Left arm. Daniel Prokopchuk, Bozhidar Simeonov. Left arm.
SPEAKER_04: World title, 77 kilos. Prokopchuk. Does Vladimir Maiorov know that last year at the World Combat Games, Bozhidar beat Prokopchuk with left arm? He didn't know that, but he thinks Prokopchuk will win. Okay.
SPEAKER_00: And Adam? I'm going to root for Bozhidar. What do you think about these guys? What do you think about these guys? Strong guys. About Bozhidar and Daniel? Yeah. I mean, yeah, they're both super strong. I've pulled one of them. Well, I've pulled both of them, actually, Daniel on the after table. I think Bozhidar is going to win. I'm rooting for him. Okay. Yeah. Okay, let's go to the next one.
SPEAKER_02: Travis Bergen or Alexander? Serhii Kalinichenko. Kalinichenko and Bergen Travis. Which hand? The right one? The right one, yes. Well, to be honest, I'm for Kalinichenko. But objectively, I think it's 50-50.
SPEAKER_00: He said, I'm cheering for Kalinichenko, but objectively, I think it's very close, 50-50. And Adam? I have absolutely no idea what shape Travis is in. Nobody does. A couple of years ago, just at a tournament, and beat him. But what does he say? Does he say he's in good shape?
SPEAKER_01: Okay, let's ask Pavel, what did you understand from everything that Travis said on that day and from everything that you see about Travis lately? How do you see? I think he's pretty serious. He is training, he is gaining, he is definitely not in very good shape, but he's ready to give a fight. And the way he's pulling, he has a very, very good chance.
SPEAKER_01: Very good chance. I think Kalinichenko may be slight favorite because how powerful he is.
SPEAKER_01: It's closer than we may think. And Travis is an unorthodox style. If he will do his thing, there is no way to get out of there, you know. So I think Kalinichenko is slight favorite at maybe 55% max. Okay, Paolo, let's go this. You know, Kalinichenko is outside puller. Yes. And Travis is outside. When they hit outside, who do you think is losing the risk?
SPEAKER_01: Or your prediction was exactly about this hand. Do you think that Travis may have a stronger hand than Serhii? Travis definitely does not have a stronger hand, but he may have a better timing because of his style. False start, press, false start, you know, and then at the right moment,
SPEAKER_01: he may start exactly into his position if that happened and that very well may happen then travis will win well there is no way that travis cannot have better risk in hand yeah okay he does not have a better risk at the moment no no he's not yet okay okay and and adam um i'm rooting for travis i i want him to win but i think the the i think sergey is the is the favorite
SPEAKER_00: Um, I mean, I see it possibly, it probably, you know, Travis does time it up. Right. And maybe it looks like he has hand position. Maybe they go into the strap and then maybe Sergey's too powerful for him. Um, you know, or I could be dead wrong. I, you know, like I said, I don't know what shape Travis is in, so I'm rooting for Travis, but I, but, but I think that, you know, statistically speaking, the edge probably goes to. Okay. I have a question for you guys, or I don't know, like Paulo,
SPEAKER_04: If Travis would arm wrestle now, Chance Shaw or Matt Mask, what is his chance of winning? Just objectively, you know, just no offense to anyone. Very hard question. I think with Chance Shaw,
SPEAKER_01: it's probably more chances to win than with Matt Mask. Why I'm saying that? Because styles make matches. And because of the actual start timing of Travis will be so difficult for Chance, it will not be that much difficult to Matt Mask. Okay, so his chance to beat Chance is higher than beating Matt Mask, but does it mean that
SPEAKER_04: Is he underdog or favored against these people? Underdog in both. In both matches? And he is very close to Serhii, you are saying? He is very close to everything. Only because of his timing at the start. If he is...
SPEAKER_01: able to catch that position at the start that's it no no one of those three will pull out from that position and that is a very high possibility that he will be in his favorite position at the start and then how is the underdog
SPEAKER_01: If he cannot gain that position and timing of those... But you said that it's very high possible that he will gain that position. Yes, yes, yes. So, but strength-wise, he is not as strong. If any of those athletes ready and worked on the stage starts and will take Travis out of their hands, they are stronger athletes.
SPEAKER_01: Okay. But Chavis is gaining. Don't underestimate. We don't know. It's a little bit unpredictable because of the stars. Barbora Bagriova, Egle White-Coutier. Egle from Lithuania and Barbora. Oh, these are the girls, right?
SPEAKER_00: doesn't know okay adam barbara defeated gabriella and eglett recently beat sarah yeah i think i think barbara's got the edge there yeah i think yeah i think she's a little bit probably probably a little bit too strong just too big a little bit bigger stronger maybe
SPEAKER_04: Were you surprised when Egle pulled against Tara? David you expect such a match? You remember the match? Yeah, I do. I thought it was going to be closer. Yeah, me too. Yeah. Yeah, I thought it was going to be closer. But yeah, Egle was just a little too much. And what's your opinion about this, Pablo?
SPEAKER_01: yeah i think i think the same way as adam that barbara uh not only because of the size and the power but because of her style uh she's coming she's she's not only you know here she's stopping eggly too it's interesting match but i will give a slight edge to barbara yeah i was surprised when eggly also went inside yeah yes i was like wow it was interesting
SPEAKER_02: Tad Hutchings vs. Krasimir Kostadinov. Vladimir. Tad Hutchings. Tad Hutchings vs. Krasimir. Well, I support Krasimir. But to be honest, 50-50. I think that if Krasimir's stamina is not enough to stop him, he will have problems.
SPEAKER_01: He said that I'm cheering for Krazy, but I believe that this match is 50-50. And he believes that if Krazy have not enough endurance to stop every match, he will have some problems there. And Adam? Todd. I think Todd by a good, by a solid... Marginal. Yep. Okay. Evgeny Prudnik.
SPEAKER_02: Irakli Zirakashvili, Vladimir. Well, I'll put it this way. Lately, Prudnik has become a little bit lighter. Maybe he has changed his training or something else. I think Irakli, on the contrary, seems to have improved. It seems that Irakli will win. But I would...
SPEAKER_02: To be honest, I would like to see them in both, so that they have good peak forms. Yes, it would be interesting. But I can probably, well, I would put it on Prudnik, probably. But now you think... More universal, more universal.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, yeah. Vladimir is saying that right now it looks like Prudnik is a little lighter and maybe decreased a little bit in the power and strength and Rackly is on an upper trajectory. So right now he don't know, but if both will bring the peak form, he would put Prudnik because of his versatility, he has more tools.
SPEAKER_04: guys i i i made the wrong poll sorry guys i was just trying to i i forgot to write the uh morozo versus la latin and then it's say like yes and no morozo people were confused probably
SPEAKER_01: um okay so basically he said that instead of who's winning sorry uh he said at the moment he believes that iraqli is an upward trajectory and uh down trajectory but if they will both bring a big form that yeah have a better edge because of his versatility and more tools in the box okay so if the match is close to
SPEAKER_00: And then he's going to find a way to win. But if he is too strong, he will dominate. OK. And what is your opinion, Adam? I actually have the same opinion. I think Iraq is on the upward trend, but, you know, getting might just be just a little bit too much, even right where he's at, just with all his tools and what how long ago did Iraq pull Todd?
SPEAKER_04: That was a good while ago, wasn't it? I think it was 2022. That long? Probably like it was 2022 May or something like two years. I think. I may be mistaken. So, I mean, you know, Evgeny
SPEAKER_00: kind of beat Todd pretty easily that was also a while ago and you know Todd and Irakli were closer but Todd won and Irakli's been on the upward trend yeah so I mean I think if Genni still has the edge there but Irakli's close and he's definitely on the up on the upward climb so it'll be a good it'll be a good okay then let's go to the next one David Dadikyan Oleg Petro Vladimir
SPEAKER_02: Ask Vladimir, does he think this is a good match? Vladimir, do you think this is a good match for Petro? I think so, yes. The only thing is that it's hard for me to root for anyone here. Why? Because I like both of these athletes, how they fight. Each one in his own way. It's hard to say, but I think that
SPEAKER_02: the one who can impose more of his style will win here. If you take, for example, Dadikyan, he fights more in the hook, and Petro, on the contrary, more to the top. And it seems to me that if one can impose a fight on another, someone will convince him. So to speak, who will win, and it's hard for me. Honestly, I know them very well, both of them, I've been following them for a long time.
SPEAKER_02: What to say, Petro will win now or Dadikyan, I don't know, it's hard for me.
SPEAKER_01: Vladimir is saying that he knows both athletes very well. He likes them very much, both of them. And he said, listen, I cannot predict who's going to win because they're very good athletes. And he believes that we'll win the one who will be able to bring his style on the table because they're similar but different. So Dadikyan is deeper, Petro is a little bit higher. And he said, who will be able to...
SPEAKER_04: bring his style on the table that will gonna win yeah but who does he think that he's gonna bring the style and did he think that did he did he see the ongoing match with petrenko video you know
SPEAKER_01: I saw that and Petro is probably saying that, yes, absolutely. But we don't know what form brought Angerbaev and it did not look like he was in the best shape. Adam, how do you see this match?
SPEAKER_00: very close um i was very impressed with oleg uh with the younger vibe match i mean despite whatever peter galley was in um and daddy you know we know daddy khan so i yeah i think maybe daddy khan has this has the slight edge but very close 50 50. hmm yeah this is good that you know um
SPEAKER_04: athletes from US is becoming more popular at this side of the world, and athletes from East more popular over there. That is very good that, you know, now we becoming more globally connected. This is, that's good, you know. And I think at the beginning of the UFC, I think almost all of the fighters were Americans, right?
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, now it became more global, so everyone knows who Habib is, who Fedor was, and this and that. Now, this is good that, you know, I'm sure that we didn't know as much two years ago about this, correct, Adam? Yeah, I mean, East versus West has really brushed up my knowledge on athletes from around the world. I mean, when you first had me on and we talked about matches, I didn't know who anybody was, but now I can, yeah, I know exactly. I know track records on
SPEAKER_04: both of those guys from all weight classes, you know, so you're absolutely right. You're absolutely right. That's good. That's very good. And now is an interesting one. Sasho versus Samushia. 85 kilo. Vladimir, this is your category. You both pull in this category and I think this match is also very interesting for you guys.
SPEAKER_02: I have to answer, right? Yes. I can honestly say that I would like Samushia to win. Why? Because I would like a rematch. But it seems to me that Sasho will win. He will not win him dry, but there is a very high probability that Sasho will win.
SPEAKER_02: I think Sasho will be the next person who will be the champion if Samushia wins 10 times or 8 times. Vladimir is saying, I want Samushia to win because I want a rematch.
SPEAKER_01: but unfortunately he say it's a very good probability that uh sasha gonna win and uh the same as samusha was eight-time champion uh it's probably gonna happen again with sasha he's gonna be next eight-time champion uh tell him that it's terrible to hear this from someone who is competing in that category and you yeah i just tell him that engines show you so hopeless
SPEAKER_01: And I was disappointed to hear that. No, I want to say that, of course, I want to beat Samushia, Sasho and everyone else, but how can I say?
SPEAKER_02: Everyone thought every time that Samushia would lose now, now he will lose. Someone now thinks that he will also lose, maybe he will win. I, for example, of course, I can translate it like this, DRZ, about the question, by the way, how I look at myself, at the sport. Honestly, I can say that now the first task, and I am already 30 years old,
SPEAKER_02: I want to get everything I can naturally. I want to progress as much as I can. And which bar will I reach? It's me. I don't care who else is there. Sasho or someone else. If I win, I win. If I don't win, I don't win. That's it. That's the bar I have now. Before, I didn't have such a task to find my ceiling. Now I have it.
SPEAKER_01: you know says that uh listen sure i want to win i want to win samusha i want to win uh uh
SPEAKER_01: a show i want to win everybody out there uh and everybody was having a different opinions about previous samusha's matches and somebody was always telling that samusha gonna lose this time and he was still winning so it's only our opinions my personal goal is i'm almost 30 years old and uh naturally i want to see where my plank is and next time it's going to be a match and i will do the best to win but if i'm gonna lose well
SPEAKER_04: then that means it's not enough. But it looks like since he thinks that Sasho is going to win eight times in a row, and since he's not competing in every event, he has European, World, or something, so he thinks that next three years, you know, we will not see another champion, including himself.
SPEAKER_02: So you think that in the next three years we won't see another champion, including you, because you think that Sasho will win eight times in a row, right? I'm a realist. I'm a realist and I understand that if someone comes, it will be better than Sasho, he will win. And if you don't find such a person,
SPEAKER_02: He's saying, listen, I'm realist.
SPEAKER_01: and uh uh sasho gonna win if uh there will be not somebody who is really better look at levan he's pulling for last how many years and winning everybody because nobody better than him so we're waiting for somebody show i think he's talking about iman you said oh levan levan levan so he thinks
SPEAKER_04: Well, it turns out that your main task is to be second, right? Or do we have to bring you to the 77th category or to the 95th?
SPEAKER_01: Tell him that even if he wins against Adam, no title match for him, because he doesn't believe in himself. Evgeny if you win against Adam, we won't let you fight for the title, because you don't believe in yourself. I see. To be honest, I would answer this question after Adam. Why?
SPEAKER_02: If I would pass him easily, or someone who is also very strong, I could judge myself. And so, well, who did I fight here? Maybe I'm weak at all. We'll see. But if they don't give me a match, then I'm such a fighter, not a fighter.
SPEAKER_01: vladimir saying okay uh if if possible i would answer this question after the match with adam because maybe i will go over him easy you know who knows because i'm not pulling anybody around me who is good uh but uh he said even if i'm gonna win and then engine will not give me any further matches that means i'm a bad arm wrestler okay what was that means what that means i'm a bad arm wrestler
SPEAKER_00: No, he is an arm wrestler that doesn't trust himself to become the best. Right. That's what I said to him. Okay. Adam, how do you see this match? Well, the Samushia-Sasho match? I mean, yeah, I think Samushia has got his hands full for sure. I don't think he's totally out of it. But, you know, I think he's going to have to be a little bit more versatile
SPEAKER_00: he's been in the past um you know as far as you know exploring other lanes um because you know we know how good sasho is inside and you know i mean smoosh is great there too but you know he may have to explore you know a little bit a little bit more angles on the table or or with a little bit more speed to try to maybe get around that but i don't think he's out of it and i don't think
SPEAKER_00: you know, Sasho, I mean, I think Sasho can be as dominant as Vladimir saying he is, but, you know, I mean, July 6th, you just focus on that one. That's it. And you better watch because, you know, I, we're, we're, we're coming hard at this weight, you know, we're coming hard. And, uh,
SPEAKER_00: You know, I don't know. I don't know who's going to win that match. And no matter who wins that match, you know, I can promise that we're not going to see three years of the same champion after that match. I can promise you that. See, Adam, that is the spirit. That's the spirit. So you are not coming, you are not just coming to Istanbul to end up the second best, like, as your best dream. No, but I don't understand how you could be the second best and then roll through me. That's not going to happen, but...
SPEAKER_04: You know, either way, we're coming. Yep. Okay. And Paolo, tell, tell, tell, tell, I need to tease Rila Dimesh. I didn't like what he said. So I need to be even harder on him after what I heard. Tell him that Adam is not like him. Adam is just...
SPEAKER_01: Dreaming to become the best. When I say dreaming, it's not like dreaming. Dreaming, but have a dream, you know, as we all have. Like he has a target, he has a goal to become the best. You see, Vladimir, that's it. Adam doesn't like you. He has a clear goal, a dream that he's following, and he wants to be the best. And he promised that 100% in no three years there will be a new champion. Well, I'll put it this way.
SPEAKER_02: that you can guess or say anything. I, for example, am used to answer for my words by doing. So let him say now that he is ready to gain such a form in half a year and bring everyone out. Well, please, we will meet, we will fight, and then it will be clear. If he passes me easily, then he is really right and a very cool dude.
SPEAKER_01: vladimir saying that uh he's responsible for what he's saying always uh and uh you know he has his plans and dreams uh and uh he said if adam will win easy and will pass through me then he is very very you know uh uh serious dude uh but we will see on the table very soon yeah yeah yeah can you please also tell him that i'm just teasing him
SPEAKER_04: Because I want him to say, I'm going to become the best no matter what, same as Adam says. It doesn't matter who wins, but everyone should
SPEAKER_01: that these athletes should never say that I can't become the best. That's why I'm just trying to fire him up, not that I don't have any kind of problem with him. Engin says on purpose, I'm teasing you on purpose, in order to hit you in the head, so that you have the right direction of thinking, that I want to win, that I will win. He says, you can't say that I won't be able to win with someone. That's wrong. You should always say that I will win.
SPEAKER_02: Vladimir is saying that I have a little bit different mindset and he said I will become better myself and if somebody wants to try, let him try me.
SPEAKER_04: and we are letting arthur morozov let's start with you adam this is the right arm match they are trying to build their way to the title right arm right arm yes you know i i gotta give it to morozov i think more morozov is the favorite i do and how do you see this match
SPEAKER_00: keep Morozov hooking him, dead-risk pressing him or top-rolling him? I think it's going to be all over the place. I think Vitalii may be able to get into his move in the first couple rounds. And I think Morozov may even get pinned once trying to hook him. But I think Morozov's going to figure it out. And then maybe I think he's either going to win
SPEAKER_00: inside with a press or maybe he's going to figure out how to how to how to come outside and maybe vitaly kind of over rolls like this and he's able to get on top a little bit either way i see i see that match gone um three one three two mores off and you will let me what do you mean
SPEAKER_02: Vitalii is probably the favorite, but I think he will win. But to be honest, I would like them to have such a difficult situation, so that Vitalii could see his weaknesses. Why? Because out of the two, Morozov and Laletin, I see more potential in Laletin to beat Levan.
SPEAKER_02: Vladimir thinks that Vitalii has an edge.
SPEAKER_01: but he wants to see a very hard match, and he believes that Morozov will give him a very hard match. It's a very serious opponent. Go to Vitalii, his weaknesses, because he believes that Vitalii needs to know those weaknesses, because Vladimir believes that Vitalii has more possibilities or tools to win with Saganashvili.
SPEAKER_01: okay so vitale has more tools to win against aginashvili yes i think i missed that part about the relation he wants to see a hard match he believes that morozov is very serious opponent to vitaly vitalik has a slight edge over morozov but he
SPEAKER_04: wants morozov to show to lalitin his weaknesses so lalitin weaknesses to have to became better and okay okay okay okay okay now i understood yeah during the match we tell you we'll find out more weaknesses he's very well experienced athlete i'm sure that he is aware of many things but in every event we are we are learning yeah anyways guys um thank you thank you very much
SPEAKER_00: Vladimir and thank you Adam do you guys want to say anything last to each other and any message anything I mean I hope the best for you Vladimir I hope your training is going great and I hope we can both bring our best forms and have a great match July 6th I know I'll bring mine I hope you'll bring yours
SPEAKER_01: Thank you. Does he want to say anything lastly? Good luck.
SPEAKER_02: and let him also be in good shape so that I could test myself. Because I haven't fought with anyone serious for a long time. I treated this match very seriously. Fortunately, I had time. And it will be interesting for me to fight, to check myself. Because one thing is to fight somewhere in training, and the other thing is at the match. This is a completely different level.
SPEAKER_01: Good luck, bring super form because I want to really test myself and I am taking this match very, very serious and I have enough time for preparation and I want to check myself against somebody serious. Thank you. Thank you, Vladimir. Thank you, Adam. Thank you, Paolo, for helping. You all take care and thanks to everyone who has been watching us.
SPEAKER_04: See you guys in Istanbul. Bye-bye. Thank you.
