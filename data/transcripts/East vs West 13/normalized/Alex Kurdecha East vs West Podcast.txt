SPEAKER_01: Hello, hello everyone. Today we will have Alex Kurdeca as our podcast guest. By many people he is considered as the person who has the highest chance to defeat
SPEAKER_01: Levan Saginashvili, of course. We don't know that, but time will show. Okay, I'm now sharing the link on social media so people will be informed and if they want to
SPEAKER_01: Join us. By the way, King of the Table, 11, Saturday, only five days. It will be great. It will be great. Okay, let me go to...
SPEAKER_01: Okay, guys. Great to see you all. Let's see. Engin Turbo. Engin Turbo. Benji. See you all. One second. Let me turn the sound. Yeah, I think this is better. Better than before, for sure.
SPEAKER_01: Hello, team. Hello, Hanzado. Is that you, Ibragim? Or maybe not. Hello, Carlo. Hello, Zecharia. Hello, Jesus. Hello, Engin Turbo. Hello, Adnan. Paul Hutchings Jr. Jose Antonio.
SPEAKER_01: Levan Saginashvili's left forearm. Okay, guys. So, Kuyushkov arm wrestling. Hello, Mr. Terzi. Amazing card for Eastworld Western. Yes, my friend. Yeah. I think Alex didn't want to compete for one year because probably he didn't want to be in the same event with
SPEAKER_01: Okay, never mind. Yeah, Midagos doesn't like the sleeve with T-shirts. Hello, Sybester Tallone. Hello, Sam. I think in seven minutes Alex will join us. Day is fine, all is fine. I'm training, but very light, very light today.
SPEAKER_01: Yesterday I did some hammer, no, wrist training day before hammer, day before, I don't remember, yeah, pronation and a little bit side pressure, very light. Drinking milk with honey. Okay, very soon.
SPEAKER_01: Alex will join us. Hello, Paul. You are the man. 1.4 GHS Mac. Yeah, I'm also excited for Alex versus Jerry. Thank you, Benji. It's sim gaming. Merhaba, karde≈üim.
SPEAKER_01: What if Alex gets up to 190 kg? It can be dangerous. If weight equals power, yeah. But Levan was 190 kg against Hermes. He didn't like his shape, so he lost weight. He was 175 kg against Devin. Hello, Sertsu. No, Streb.
SPEAKER_01: wasn't supposed to be signed. It was just a free strap, East versus West strap. Thank you very much, my friend. I think if Dennis fixes his health problems, I think he will be in better shape than last time I saw him. Hello, hello, Dave Anderson. Hello.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know, Kuiskov. I don't know, my friend. Hello, Adnan. Yeah, Kurdesha versus Alekh Laletin also is another good match. Hello, Luck. Okay, Alekh just came. Let me accept him. Hello, Alekh. How are you, my friend?
SPEAKER_01: Good to see you. Everything is perfect. You hear me good? Yeah, very good. Camera is good? Yeah, everything is great. I'm big enough or small? Your arms, they look
SPEAKER_01: Big, yes, yes, yes, very big, yeah, very big. Wow, yeah. I mean, it is not that easy to have arms that look so big when you have such tall arms, you know, because... Yes, it's true. It's a problem with tall guys. Like, you compare the face and everything. Not with you. It looks huge. Whenever I realize your height, and then I also realize...
SPEAKER_00: how big actually they are. So how is everything? Everything is perfect. We have good times now. I'm already starting my special preparation because every opponent needs some special preparation. It's not always the same for everyone.
SPEAKER_00: And sometimes you do very important things to be a complete armwrestler, like to not be one-sided, like you improve. And sometimes you improve, improve, improve, go to some moment and you know that you actually know nothing and you start the real journey from that point. And I believe that in the future it will continue the story when I open something new for myself.
SPEAKER_01: About a year ago when I offered you Jerry match you said you need a special preparation because it was not a long notice one. But now this time around the same time you accept it because your form is generally much better than last year. Yes, so generally yeah.
SPEAKER_00: And second time, sometimes you need to improve, always you need to improve, but sometimes you need to improve something special for your opening. Jerry's style is some special style, and I believe he is a good test for everyone. And for him, you know, you need to do something special for him. He deserves special preparation for himself.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. Do you think that the reason Hermes beat Jerry was because of the right strategy? I believe that Hermes was very smart that day and what I was watching, he was actually doing the correct thing, yes. So strategy was good, preparation plan was good.
SPEAKER_00: And the realization during the match by Hermes was pretty good, yeah. And do you think that if Hermes would pull completely out, do you think it would be a tougher match? I believe yes. I still believe that Hermes will win because Hermes can transform to the push, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: but it will be like not a pin by one moment it will be like open the wrist open the angle and after that you need still need to go by shoulder press and finish by shoulder pressure yeah but what if hermes would go out like this first move and then jerry presses and he stops him here would it be still possible to put the shoulder if he is in halfway down or but i believe he would stop i believe that hermes will not lose the angle he will goes
SPEAKER_00: by this not openly his angle he will be sharp and go here and after that go to the press I believe that he knows that it's important not to lose angle okay and the reason I'm asking this um it is will you be able to do what Hermes did or you will have
SPEAKER_00: tools to do the second one? I know, I know, I know, you don't have to say it. No, no, I will answer you. I will answer. The answer that probably, of course, I will bring some surprise, like always I want. Sometimes it's work, sometimes it's less work, but I think it will be work this time. Maybe I will go even inside. Nobody knows until we will go in the table. Maybe I will go inside. But honestly, if I need to
SPEAKER_00: be away from myself and watch the style of Jerry. So one of the good way to pull with him is open his angle, open his wrist and transform to the triceps press, to the shoulder press. It's one way. Second way is not let him go there, like not let him go to open flat press and take from the center a little bit inside and take the side and after that go
SPEAKER_00: like Hermes did in some rounds, and it was also effective. But it's also up to the size of the guys. Because Hermes' forearm is not so long, so he doesn't have this thing where you show he can lose his angle, but take the opponent's wrist, which is like you don't take the wrist of Jerry, he gives you his wrist. He would gladly do that. And I think it's a little bit of a trap.
SPEAKER_00: yeah yeah yeah actually we discussed with them the rules of arm wrestling and one of the rule was don't take what's given so don't take if somebody give you the race don't take it in that way comfortable to your opponent you need to do something else yeah i like how to say um i have seen you
SPEAKER_01: struggling against the dead wrist press in the past. We have two matches, Krasimir and Ongarbe matches as example. But I don't know if it is because of your left hand ability, but before Morozov match, we didn't know that you could do hook, you could do shoulder pressure either. So I don't know if it is because of your
SPEAKER_00: general improvement, or is it something about your left arm? You don't have to say it, but at least soon we will find out. So, yeah, the table will show the answer, but we have one thing which is always with us. It's our anatomy. Like, the bones' lengths don't change too much. It's almost the same. Like, the muscles, they change, the mass can be changed, the power of the tendons can change,
SPEAKER_00: but what the difference for myself it was like the training of side pressure because always I was more in the back pressure and I was not in the shoulder press in that moment absolutely because I was not good in that and I don't train that in that moment in the past in the past but now after it was more power of rotator more
SPEAKER_00: side so side was the key probably even like something like some percentage like 10 20 30 in the side give generally to the power big results i remember when i was training and i saw the results was good and also it helps to the shoulder it gives you more stability you have the power of the center you control more the center like not opponent hit you but you hit your opponent and the
SPEAKER_00: for me it was like the key yeah so i managed some something i have already something i need to train and inside it was i was need to train in past so it was my fault that i don't train it too much but like you know to be complete arm wrestler you need to train everything but you cannot train everything in one moment you have some priority but when you have a time you add for example flat press you add side
SPEAKER_00: You add more hand control, which is one of the most important things. You even train your start. You even train your endurance. There are so many aspects, and they are very important. And, of course, you want to be as best as possible in every of them, but you need to train every of them. I will ask you a question, but there is Paul. Paul Hutchings says, we got to give Rob Vision Jr. a match.
SPEAKER_01: at East vs. West or King of the Table, so he doesn't quit arm wrestling. He would be a PD, but he actually, about a month ago, or maybe more, he wrote me that he would like to be at the East vs. West 13. And he wanted to pull Leonidas. And I talked with Leonidas' team
SPEAKER_01: They thought that he would be, I don't know, maybe they thought that he would be a light opponent compared to Leonidas. Later, he accepted to pull John Burzink, but I think the meaning of pulling John Burzink is a bit different. This is just a completely different thing to have such honor.
SPEAKER_01: So after that, I offered him to pull against Ibragim Sagov. But it was just like maybe a week ago, 10 days ago. But he said that I think he made some holiday plans later. And so he couldn't do that. So I offered the match to Chance Cho. And Chance Cho will be pulling Ibragim Sagov at 2.53pm.
SPEAKER_01: Chance has been losing some weight, and he will do some water cut at the last minute, and they will be pulling. Anyway, so the question is, you said that you developed this later, but whenever I saw you pulling Corey West with right arm, you were still over-pronating. And right after the event, later, I saw the footage, but with left arm, you were more like... Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: with right arm you are still over pronating left arm full hand wrist control and even side pressure even maybe a little bit in you know so um let's see let's see how it will be i don't know if you want to say anything about you know it's really yeah it's it's exactly how you saw it it's weird for example in left
SPEAKER_00: I don't train it for special. Like left already have it. Like it's my hand here. My hand, my hand. Artem you originally lefty? No, no. I'm not lefty. I'm right-handed. But left, for example, in some position, much more stronger. Like it's already. And if I train left, it's improved very fastly.
SPEAKER_00: right like it's improved but you need to train it's improved by by this you know by by small step left train little bit more power train a little bit more like like this like big step you know and right right more maybe maybe a little bit why is why why did you think that i think i remember you telling me your left is stronger but why was it if you are not even left-handed something is wrong with your right arm do you know what my my
SPEAKER_01: theory about this is that if your left arm is close to your right arm, originally, even if you are right-handed, usually during the practices, we have training partners stronger with right arm and left arm, we always apply everything, you know, very well, you understand, because we are strong almost as much as right. So it is always while right arm, we, we,
SPEAKER_01: We don't always train. We can't have the control because we have training partners that they can put us. Maybe it gets stronger, but not the same control as the left arm. Because left arm, you are strong, stronger than everyone. You can curl them. You can pronate. Everything is under control. And if you need to train for power, you can let them hold with two hands. You can still do that.
SPEAKER_01: I find my left hand control is I want as many world titles with left as right. So, but I always thought that I haven't trained for the last five years left arm, but always had the better
SPEAKER_00: control i i think that it may be the reason i don't know and with me it's even you know sometimes it's like even surprise i can do something which i even don't expect for example so it's more powerful but also it can be endurable like always it's more about power or about endurance and left can be the same in one you know can be enjoyable and powerful i don't know why maybe about about trainings because maybe like
SPEAKER_00: it's always have a little bit more, you know, like more effectiveness in training. Maybe right. You Russian little bit, little bit Russian always. Yeah. And maybe left is always do exactly how much it wants, like that you will train exactly how much the best, you know,
SPEAKER_01: Training so hours it's needed to be better maybe on right you always Try a little bit more and you will become a little bit more exhausted, but I'm not sure about that And thank you for the congratulations. Yeah, we now have over 150,000 Subscribers on this channel and the other channel is forces versus over 170,000 now, so it's growing. Thank you for your support as long as you
SPEAKER_01: guys support me, I will also continue serving the sport. What was I going to say? Yeah, you really surprised me. It was very like Morozov to hook you without the strap.
SPEAKER_01: in a fresh round was surprised. You two just battled him inside to inside, power to power, endurance to endurance. It was also surprising. And so, but do you think that it is normal that people doubt your right arm abilities? Because even with left arm, we learned something new at that match. With right arm,
SPEAKER_00: Artem you confident that you can bring to the table something that we didn't know before about your right arm? I think I can make some surprises this time. I'm a little bit more confident than always. I always want a big combo.
SPEAKER_00: like love preparation table don't love talk too much table love when you patiently go to the dream
SPEAKER_00: sit there train and after that bring something to the table but when you work yeah and you see some results which good for you you compare always how strong you was how you now and you see yeah you you happy by some results and these results give you real confidence because you cannot be confident when you are not strong only real strengths give you the confidence
SPEAKER_00: and of course you need to check yourself because sometimes you think okay i'm good i'm uh set my new personal record in some exercise but how it will be on the table during the real fight and you want to check it and you see that yeah it really works um it was amazing fight i was you know uh it was the fight which shows me that real trainings give some results
SPEAKER_00: Victor loves preparation. I said before the match that I will chase for that position, for that spot number one. I will not go away. I will not go away so far. I know the rest of the guys also want to be on the same place and this is great because when you have strong opponents,
SPEAKER_00: You can work the best version of yourself because if it's easy, it's a little bit boring. If it's fantastically hard, that makes you happy to achieve that mountain. Yeah, but if you can beat everyone easily, you can still be happy, you know, because it means that you are the best in the world. It means that you train so hard and you brought yourself to that level.
SPEAKER_01: We can look for the fantasy, you know. But you know, honestly, honestly, like sometimes you won easily. Yeah. But the best memory, it's a hard match. The best in memory. What can you do? What can you do if you are too good? What to do, you know? It means that you are Levan. Evgeny Levan, you know, even Levan, you know.
SPEAKER_01: first round of the Laletin match and late rounds of the Hermes match, first round of the Devon match. I mean, of course, but I will tell you something. I went to Georgia to film, you know, how Levan is getting ready and I saw someone who is training
SPEAKER_01: as hard as anyone on this earth. He's not like, oh, I'm number one, I beat everyone, I'm genetically incredible. No, the guy really pays the price. I think after the Hermes match, he got his lesson. He needed that one probably because it was very hard for him to be motivated when he dominated everyone.
SPEAKER_01: But now I see that, you know, he's taking it seriously. You said only three minutes ago, you said that you always like to be respectful and do the talk at the table. How do you see this subject when, you know, we know that in this world, like, for example, Habib Nurmagomedov versus Conor McGregor, they fought.
SPEAKER_01: And Khabib won the match. And McGregor made $50 million. And Khabib made $6 million. What I just tried to say that like one of the reasons that Muhammad Ali is considered as the God is because he could talk.
SPEAKER_01: and walk at the same time. Like, Devon is the same way, Travis Benjamin is the same way. Of course, we don't have to be like them, but do you think that we should express ourselves, you know, as much as possible? In fact, you are expressing yourself, but what you are saying is you are expressing respectfully. You know, I understand what you said, and for me, like,
SPEAKER_00: I will say that you need to be yourself, but the real confidence, when you're really confident, it's good. It's also art to express by words your confidence. It's also like mind games. It's part of the fight because
SPEAKER_00: Fight begins not when fight, for example, it's MMA or it's armwrestling. It's not only after the goal. It's before. Because guys watching each other. Like, for example, McGregor, he was saying, I will crash you. And he goes and crash. And opponents in future know that it's not just talk. He goes with something special. He is so motivated. He is so confident. For example, Muhammad Ali the same.
SPEAKER_00: Devon also, like he brings something special in his words. His words have some special energy. And I believe that every one of us can build himself for some special moment. And when you already build your like complete arm wrestler, maybe you are not in that moment, maybe are not on the first place, but here you know that you are the best. And from that moment,
SPEAKER_00: all doors are open for you because you really believe in this by your heart and you go to do all the world by this so i believe in that moment when i will feel this really when i just not check my limits when i will go to take the place which i want to take
SPEAKER_01: i will be uh talk everything i want yeah but but i what i will just say that like i i don't think that like mcgregor is not a fake guy he is just original like that muhammad ali was the same way his personal life and everything he was what i'm just saying that i think i think people
SPEAKER_01: uh fans need to know who you guys are it doesn't matter you don't have to be like devon or something alex people need to know alex like what he thinks what are his dreams you know like how his life you know things like that like david samusha incredible like eight title matches and winning all of them and then finally he made me bring sasha down to 85 kilo
SPEAKER_01: You know, I don't know what to say about that guy, but the guy doesn't really express himself. Yeah, I mean, I have huge respect because my perspective as Engin Terzi is just pure armless in perspective. You know, I'm not super interested about other things, but as an organizer, of course, I want hype. I want, you know, third pot and things like that. But like my respect for Samushia is incredible. I wish
SPEAKER_01: people would know more about him so i plan to go to if possible i would plan to go to kazakhstan even russia and even europe all those countries including you maybe if i cannot do that maybe raymond would do it for me i go georgia do the interviews and like i i people need to see you know the people are looking more for story you know yeah
SPEAKER_00: to show naturally. Like you said, if you build naturally, you live somewhere. Some place builds your power. You have the place of your power where you were trained
SPEAKER_01: from where your power was like existed and everyone have different story but I believe like different personality different yeah some can be calm quiet but still just because you are calm and quiet it doesn't mean that you don't have anything inside of you to show you know you can you can show that calm personality as well there is a super chat top release for smart he says engine good evening sir Alex how it was training with Devon any outcomes
SPEAKER_00: It was fantastic. If it's shortly, uh, you know, guys, I can tell a lot and it will be not shortly. It will be more than an hour, but it was training. It was about mindset. It was about why we love arm wrestling. We was speaking. We always have fun. And, uh, something which I opened new for me, like, honestly, guys in that day, I see something new, like.
SPEAKER_00: really new which is important and now i'm start training more and i see some results which i happy so uh i don't want to go like run too fast but i i probably will show something i want to show something which i know and i know that it takes time but it will be not so fastly to improve in something new we can improve what we have
SPEAKER_00: but when you start train like new weapon like for example you are fast but you want to be endurable it takes time you are good in some moment but you bring some new movements and honestly it brings new understanding for me like for me it was more about more understanding arm wrestling okay i understand so you just say that you learn a lot from the training
SPEAKER_01: And the question is, how close do you see yourself to Levan? Like, I think we are different. We have different styles. No, no, I mean, to beat him, how close do you feel yourself? Do you think you have enough to pin him? Enough horsepower, enough everything?
SPEAKER_00: I think I can be that guy who will crush that mountain. I already said that. This is my dream and nothing will change until I will do it. Okay, so of course that's the mission, but are you there yet or you need a little bit more time? I think it's like about good preparation. So I am already, because sometimes even with preparation you will be not sure.
SPEAKER_00: But with preparation, I see how much I need to achieve and I see that it's absolutely possible. It's not like I will think maybe yes, maybe no. I definitely say yes. I already see how much I want to be realistic. Evgeny that day I want to go with Levan. He knows. He wants that day to go to the side table. Hermes is a good choice. Very good choice. Denis is a very good choice.
SPEAKER_00: levan if you saw you know you know who will be the good choice in future and uh you know who can test your wrist that day uh levan is absolutely deserved number one absolutely he's the strongest he's locomotive he's very nice and humble guy and uh when we watch in the past who was little bit dangerous for him it was reverse match in the votes because of the size because of the style
SPEAKER_00: Also Devon wrist in the first round was a little bit I can say dangerous for Levan because Levan go to the press not because it was the like desire. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I know where Devon like strong here but sometimes in a side or there he if he will be stronger there it will be even more dangerous. And I know how to be
SPEAKER_01: strong in that direction. Some guys say it's ambitious. Yeah, but if you want to be a champion, you need to put big goals, big aims. Of course, you are not like number 30 guy or something. You are up there, you know, in top 10 somewhere. But of course, I mean, if somebody at your place
SPEAKER_01: If it is not going to target to beat Levan, then I would suggest him to go play some other ball game or something. Come on. Lagia, you said side table. He means that he is ready to pull him in a competition, but he means on April 20th, after the event, he was ready to even do some side table training. I think that's what you meant, right? He was not warned. You asked him?
SPEAKER_00: of course oh and you said no yes oh okay you know i will tell you the story which uh three guys know three guys me at marathon level when we was sitting in a restaurant not far away from the hotel after the match no no before the match we were sitting in the restaurant before the match
SPEAKER_00: Levan come to us and we just hold the hands and say good luck to each other and like shake the hand and just take the hand. And after I shake his hand, I said to Hermes, you know, I feel like something different. I feel like this race is not the same or maybe I'm not the same. And Hermes tell me, I feel the same, like the same like you said.
SPEAKER_00: And after that, I said, maybe we feel wrong. Maybe it's not, you know. So you felt 11th and weaker?
SPEAKER_00: Like, yeah, like not the previous. Maybe, maybe he was the same, but maybe you're getting stronger. But, but it is only a handshake, right? Only like gripping. Yeah. Yes. It's not the end of the story. I will tell, I was telling to Hermes, so something wrong, maybe, maybe not the same. He says, I feel the same, but after that I say, maybe it's wrong feeling. Maybe we are not like feel correctly. And after that, after.
SPEAKER_00: The match, I come to Levan and ask, what happened with your wrist? Because I was not sure, but it's what I feel that it's not the same. And he says to me, it's not recovered to 100%. He says that he really does not feel like he won. But this is exactly what we said before the match. When I went to Georgia, I shared about this.
SPEAKER_01: and he said that it is as good but that is what he had to say before the match can he say that oh my wrist is not as it used to be of course he said that it is good it is ready like i mean he wouldn't want to give any uh psychological advantage to you know i want to say what i was thinking that day after the match i was sitting in five meters from the table where devon and levan was fighting
SPEAKER_00: and uh i know that they represent fantastic level i absolutely know that there is two guys who now this is like they fight for the first place they are very close to the first place but after that i was thinking that i just want to check that wrist like i was really excited to check that wrist that day but really your match was kind of a bit yeah
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it was not equal. He was exhausted and his first round wasn't that easy. I agree with you, it was not equal. Yeah, because he was... Some people say that, oh, Lewand was playing with Devin. Do you agree with these things? No. I don't understand. Because I kind of think that some people really hate Devin and they don't want to... Like, the guy lost. The guy lost 4-0. You understand? I mean...
SPEAKER_00: subject is close but they don't want to even give that much credit to him that that is wrong you know you know i will tell you honestly i will tell you honestly and everyone who watches us i was checking devon wrist and in my opinion it was the strongest wrist the strongest wrist ever i checked
SPEAKER_00: But I will tell you something. I don't think that... About wrist, about hand control, he's amazing. And if you lose a little bit start and he goes whenever he wants to go, it's very hard to do something without press. It's only one thing, which is work, is press, or you need to want the start. In the final position, you need to open a little bit wrist and finish like this.
SPEAKER_00: And this is exactly what Levan did. He was doing like, he was over concentrating in the second, third and fourth round. He was doing like this. And here in the final, he does like this little bit. And it was the perfect way. It was the perfect way, which is working. I kind of think that the round one, like round one, Devon had a good start and he gave his everything. He, while...
SPEAKER_01: levan was damaged here but his arm wasn't moving anywhere i kind of think that there was like horsepower difference like you understand and i think devon especially when levan went through the pressure whenever he tried to stop here that that pressure probably damaged his arm i'm not saying injury i'm not saying
SPEAKER_01: I believe it takes a lot of energy. If he goes even loose, but loose fastly, don't spend too much energy by trying to stop the machine. What I just said, this position, I'm not talking about the wrist, but the arm, it was not 100% pressure on Levan's limit of arm.
SPEAKER_00: while it was devon's everything so he kind of got exhausted but you know devon is not so strong and addicted to be here he very strong there and he very strong in the wrist so if you pull with devon you can like kill yourself by trying to beat him because hold him it's easier than try to beat him you know and that's why i go to the press it's actually smart decision
SPEAKER_00: because going to the press you're not taking care about the wrist you go deeply you go deeply and you press and that's it so that's why until that time leon was holding him in a like a muscle way you understand he was almost yeah and then if you realize that he's stretching to this side but you know honestly i was beat the same i was did the same during the practice because i i know that uh
SPEAKER_01: Devon is not so addicted to go fastly here or fastly here. Yes, he can. But in that moment, he was trying to open the wrist. He was absolutely addicted to the wrist. You're talking about that one? Match round one? Yes. Yeah, he was only focused on his wrist. Exactly. And then you realize that he even went here apart just to overpronate. But when you do this, if you don't have any pressure here, that arm here doesn't have any pressure. The only hand.
SPEAKER_01: So here is no pressure because you are only overpronated. All you need to do is just, and he put his shoulder. And I don't think that Devon's arm, I don't know. I asked him, he says he trains, but like, do you think that Hermes' arm, general arm strength is stronger than Devon's?
SPEAKER_00: If we say about, for example, side, pure side and back. Yeah, the arm power, not here. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Hermes is not so concentrated on the wrist. He's very strong, yeah? But Devon's wrist is even more stronger, in my opinion. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That is why. That is why. Like, I was talking with Krasimir. Krasimir said that Devon's wrist is weak. You know, it says 7.10 something. It's okay. Anyways, whenever I said that, but, you know, whenever they went back pressure to back pressure, and Hermes was the one who lost the wrist, you know, when two guys apply incredible back pressure,
SPEAKER_01: The one who is at risk is more solid that survives. The other one is just boom. And at that point, your risk curve doesn't matter. I'm 100% sure that Hermes has stronger cupping. But cupping is different than staying here solid, you understand? You know, the match start, there's great risk. And then when back pressure happen, the one who has a strong risk survives, you know? It is not like dumbbell curling, but it is handling the pressure, handling the pressure.
SPEAKER_01: my book that the wrist strain means that one the one who is this risk survives is the stronger than the one whose wrist is moving like this yeah exactly there is another super chat yeah boy how many times a week do you train any table time alex so honestly every time when i train out now i train three or four times a week and all the trainings including
SPEAKER_00: some trainings on the table but probably if you guys ask about sparring it's usually once in two weeks or it's like something special or sparring it's not like i just checking something but i do some special things guys holding me by the rubber or two hands and we do some training so yeah it's also like can be once a week even sometimes sooner but
SPEAKER_01: If we talk about sparring which is highly percentage by the pure power, it's like once in two weeks, not sooner than once in two weeks. Yeah, okay. This weekend, incredible event, King of the Table 11. For me, it's very, very important because I choose my future matches
SPEAKER_01: according to those those results from these matches so it's very important for the rankings it's very important for my future matchups and everything so i'm sure you're gonna get front of your giant screen tv and then
SPEAKER_00: for sure couch and then you're yeah i will be watching very patiently some special matches oh i will all like watching but some i will be like watching all details super every week yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah anyway so uh let's start with school boy and uh ryan bowen so you know school boy is this school boy lose against
SPEAKER_01: Leonidas because schoolboy is not strong or you think Leonidas is in incredible shape?
SPEAKER_00: no i really believe that leonidas was really stronger because i saw the results of schoolboy i was think that i was honestly put him like a heavy favorite i was really expected that schoolboy will will take the wrist maybe leonidas will do something but i was not expected that lenny does do great job great job yeah he was he was he was really become stronger and now if you ask me about ryan bowen and schoolboy
SPEAKER_00: I still put on schoolboy. But schoolboy, stop losing and start winning. Do this, what you need to do. You're already university boy. We'll call you university boy now. So, upgrade and do what you need to do. Cheating for schoolboy and believe he will win. Okay. And let's go Pauline versus Lachlan Adair. I really want to ask one thing.
SPEAKER_01: Before they set the match, what was the weight difference? 105 kilos. No, listen. Lachlan was around 115 kilos generally. But he decided to go 105. And I think he was 105 when he pulled against David Arabuli. So he's around those weights, you know, naturally.
SPEAKER_01: while pauline is usually 100 kilo it cuts down to uh 95 so he is 100 kilo and as far as i know he is right now 103 104 kilo so there is either one or two kilo between them as far as i know so for me like it's up to how comfortable will be feel pauline because yeah okay he had not so many kilos but it's a little bit new for him yeah always he goes to nine five
SPEAKER_00: now he goes to 105 and uh like some inner voice tell that it will be uh pauline it uh it will be in the straps but it will be not easy match it will be not easy match because so lachlan is also he can be you know very dangerous especially at the wrist and uh i think it will be about the wrist uh
SPEAKER_00: I think Paul sometimes really makes some surprises during the match. He knows, he built himself during the matches and he was also doing some surprises. And I believe he can do it now. But I don't put him like a heavy favorite. I put almost 50-50, but I give 51 to Pauline. Okay. And this match, Revas versus Di Zerano.
SPEAKER_01: one of the probably especially interesting match for you because it's your category.
SPEAKER_00: Zerano is fantastic guy. He was he have this Kazakhstan style. He always love to lose two rounds after that, stop his opponent and start to won one by one like he did already a couple of times. He did Kalinichenko and Arif matches. Yes, with Arif, with Kalinichenko also was the same. It was the same. Kalinichenko take the first round after that. But honestly, Rivas in his prime shape
SPEAKER_00: It's a very special guy. So I put Rewaz in a favorite. But I will be not surprised if Zeranoff do the same, two times lose, after that finds some magic. This is best of seven. So he has three, three, three. Evgeny more. Okay, so even more options. So we can say that Rewaz is probably in a fresh match stronger.
SPEAKER_00: But there is a possibility that match to be stopped by Deserano and go to Endron's game. And then things may change. I will tell you that there is possibility. But for me, I know Rivas. And when he does everything in a correct way, it's a guy who is very hard to stop. And if he prepared very well, I believe he prepared very well.
SPEAKER_00: that uh he's also anthropometry his size can be dangerous for his opponent and that's why i put him like a favorite yeah and michael todd versus lars hard to say honestly michael now come back after lamparelli match so we saw that he is good he is like he's comfortable on the table yeah but lars it's also like a special guy he he loved to go
SPEAKER_00: to the press, he can do the press and for me it's Michael but in the long match if he like will be control and make his opponent exhausted and avoid of the press because Michael actually can avoid the press he goes out you know but he may go to
SPEAKER_00: press as well you know he has that ability for sure yeah but i mean for example to to pin michael it's you know you need you need to do press or you need to be very fast but i think michael i think michael you know when we are talking about these matches already i am imagining to watching them and then it's already
SPEAKER_01: Very exciting. Very, very exciting. For me the same. I also like, I like see the situation. I see the pole. I see the strap. I see like sweating on their face. I see the situation also. Yeah. And this one is my favorite one. Uh, all, all these hello, Michael workspace. Hello. Hello to Texas. Um, this one is my favorite one.
SPEAKER_01: Like, for example, the last event, Apple 20, in my opinion, was the best event in history. But my favorite match was Petro Marharint versus Nugo match. Like, I'm not talking about after the event. Evgeny before the event, it was the most interesting match for me. And this event, my favorite one is Petergali Ongarbe versus Oleg Petro.
SPEAKER_00: yeah it's very special one i i also come back to the nugo and margarine i was like i was not so excited
SPEAKER_00: I was thinking, Petro, just bring your shape. I was thinking that it will be Petro. I understand how dangerous Nugo is about wrist opening, how he opens his opponent and he's a crazy guy. He beat Petro in the second round inside. I know, yes. It was also not expected. But for me, Petro was my favourite. But it was much closer than I expected. And now, when we say it about...
SPEAKER_00: Kadir Gali is so special guy. He's like a small Devon. To one with Kadir Gali, you need to be not just stronger. What I mean is that it's not enough. For example, you're stronger. It's not enough. Evgeny if you are stronger, you need to dominate him. Dominate him so that he cannot use his tools. Once he uses his tools,
SPEAKER_01: generally he finds a way to win. He couldn't do that against Todd Hutchings because Todd, unlike Devon says, the worst style, he is very, very smart guy. Todd is that very uncomfortable opponent for Kader Ghali. He's like the worst everyone. If you want to beat
SPEAKER_01: Todd, you need to have very strong coping to control his pronator. If you go, like, it's the same, like, you know, Jerry, you take his hand, you think that, oh, okay, I took the hand. The same. If you try to over-pronate against Todd and then you cannot control his pronator, he has the pronator, then you will have incredible side pressure. To make that side pressure ineffective, you need to control here.
SPEAKER_00: And here, at the same time, it will be very hard, like Prudnik did. That's why, for me, I'm also very excited about the match of Kader Ghali. It's also about Kader Ghali, but I know what to expect from Kader Ghali. And I know that it's a very difficult day.
SPEAKER_00: to be tested by Kader Ghali. So like I said, for example, you go here, you won one round, but next round everything will change. Everything will change. He will do something different. For sure, yeah, for sure. And he's sometimes so fantastic during transition. For example, remember in the match with Irakli, when he goes here,
SPEAKER_01: it was not effective he goes here just to go top row from the hook he goes for the one second for the hook and goes from his wrist wasn't comfortable position and then he came secure his wrist and then he went out but he did that he did like with the lightning speed you know he was like you know yeah it was like art of arm wrestling it was like art you know like fantastic moment like when you can watch you know i i can do that to a beginner or something but to do that to iraqli
SPEAKER_01: It's just, you know, like everyone can play football. You know, you can see outside. You can see in an amateur league, wow, this team is great. This guy is great. But once you put that team or guy, just say, against Real Madrid, then they will look so amateur. You understand? So what I'm just saying is what Ongarwev did was this level. It was the world title match. To do that at that level is the impressive thing, you know.
SPEAKER_00: So with Petro, my heart wants to say Petro. For sure, I cheer on him. That's why my heart is there. My brain says that it will be not easy. And to beat Kadyrgaly, you need all the rounds, fastly go to the strap and to be very smart on the set up with the strap to go
SPEAKER_00: inside because i don't see it will be easy to control the hand of kadir gali if you go outside and you know sometimes it's hard to go inside versus opponent who wants to make a pressure on your fingers from the all the moments before ready go and uh know how to do it that's why this time like i said something inside me it's absolutely on the petrenko side absolutely but
SPEAKER_00: I need to be aware of it. My inside fan is Petro's fan. Emotional reasons for Petro? Yes. Emotionally, my hard time with Petro. I need to go outside from there and to watch calmly and with a cold mind. And I would say 50-50. 50-50, okay. And then let's go...
SPEAKER_01: Vitalii Laletin versus Kamil Jablonski. And I remember whenever I made a poll, who is this style is the most dangerous for Vitalii Laletin with left arm. And you were one of those guys that voted for Kamil Jablonski. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Tell us.
SPEAKER_00: So, guys, it's very easy because we were speaking about style, not power in this moment, about style. Vitalii's forearm is very long.
SPEAKER_00: His wrist is very long and guys, honestly, just imagine if somebody don't want to deal with your wrist, he'll give you the wrist, but like immediately go to the press. So stylistically, I'm agree that this is the worst style versus guy with long forearm. I believe in myself. I remembered in the past that you need to add insight to control somebody who wants to go there.
SPEAKER_00: You need to be very, very tough inside. And I know that Vitalii was not supposed to be so hard inside. I know that he's extremely strong, but always he goes outside. And this will be test in inside game. So the key now, maybe Vitalii will be so fast
SPEAKER_00: that he just goes immediately in half a second maybe you know millisecond and flash pin yeah but second thing if he goes trapped and he lose the start and somebody will be sitting on his uh it will be very hard this is how i see the match so it will be very easy for italy or very hard
SPEAKER_00: I don't see like you'll be fighting. No, if Camille go inside directly by all the power, by very, you know, deeply, very hard for Vitalii. But it's also possible for Vitalii very fastly go to the pad. That's why. Question. Just say that Laletin got the start and he hit him and Kamen is not like this, but like this.
SPEAKER_00: but but no stop him but he stopped him do you think that he can bring it back and then no but he stopped him here you know not like that not like you know in my opinion on this scenario will not be okay so you are in my opinion scenarios firstly go here take the angle take the center take everything flash pin or got trapped
SPEAKER_00: and have problems if he is or goes there. I don't see this situation that, for example, Vitalii goes almost to the pad and after that some, oh, Hermes can do this. He knows, yeah, Hermes, yeah, but not Camille, not everyone. Hermes actually didn't stop Vitalii like this, but he was more like,
SPEAKER_00: But honestly, even without wrist, he can't stop somebody. I know that he can. I don't know. A few rounds that Laletin won, I mean, it was... I think that he didn't try that. I think he was... I will explain what I mean. I mean, not during the match, but I know that he has this ability. So he has this ability of the arm. If he, like, opened the wrist, he are still...
SPEAKER_01: holding there but not everyone because push it's not the hold hold is a little bit another thing when you pull you are comfortably the way that the way that hermes does even when he stopped levan he goes with the back pressure back pressure back pressure and he loses his wrist and holds like this and then you just transition with coming coming is directly coming forward
SPEAKER_01: And it is kind of a different style. One is holding with the bicep power first and then transition, while comedy is just going directly. And so you are saying, who is winning this? Who is winning this? Who are you betting on? I have no idea, honestly. So it can go either way? Yes, yes. I know somebody say that Vitalii is heavy favorite. But like I said, I see two scenario. It will be very easy or it will be very hard.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, let's go to the main event. Morozov versus Matyushenko. Morozov looks very big right now compared to the January event. And Matyushenko is also a very dangerous guy. I think he is the one who uses his flexors
SPEAKER_01: probably more effective than anyone else. You know, I'm talking about like so fast, so powerful. I know he beat Kamil with right arm, but Kamil also, I mean, beats
SPEAKER_01: Dave Chaffee, he beat Mirtale Asano lately. So Kamil's right arm is not a joke either. But Ivan was able to block his pronator and beat him. So do you think Ivan has a chance against Morozov or not? So like I will start about Ivan. Ivan is first of all a very experienced guy who knows how to use his weapons.
SPEAKER_00: remember when dennis was on the prime shape on the left hand and ivan was the guy who even during training give him the toughest matches by his technique so how he was nowhere to hold he was perfect in the needed angle he was very good in control i remember his match also with andrei pushkar and if if even go inside deeply he are so dangerous here like he can hold you
SPEAKER_01: He can hold you, how much time, and after that, he counterattacks you. I remember when he was one of the guys who was going inside with Vitalii. With Vitalii, he goes in touch. With right arm, right arm, the first two rounds, yes, he did it. But the thing is, Ivan is more effective against top rollers than the hook pullers. Like the same Ivan I have seen, I don't know, who was under Tankulet. So his hook inability to get the person in hook is incredible.
SPEAKER_01: But if the guy is also coming inside and someone like Morozov that has very strong bicep, then will he have enough horsepower or will he be so fast enough to bring him to the near pad that Morozov will be not in elbow lock but more like open arm? But I'm not finished. I was just talking about... Yeah, yeah. But...
SPEAKER_00: Like I said, the main weapon is the style, the main weapon of Ivan is experience, the main weapon that he knows how in the past he dealt with different situations. But how I see Artem is that Artem can be very explosive. Artem can be very endurable. And Artem can transform from the situation which, for example, he goes, he sees the situation is not good, he transforms very fast to the different side.
SPEAKER_00: and uh for me there is more inside me like inner voice tell me there is like a heavy pull inside and artem one all artem even can be available to flash pin oh he may he may be too strong for him and then yeah yeah so you know i don't see
SPEAKER_00: enough power to flashpin Artem. I know in the past when he was a little bit injured, something was not good because he's a real warrior and sometimes he goes to the match not in his 100 per cent. But now I see he will be in a very good shape and it's very hard to do something. You said that I disagree only one point, Artem's speed.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, Artem may win this match easily, but I'm not sure if it is only because of speed. Just think about him versus Dave Chaffee, or he beating Dadikyan, he beating Rebaz. All the match, like, he comes here and then he catches, or, you know, almost all the same with you. The first round, just ready to go, boom, he just catches you.
SPEAKER_01: right down here, you know. So usually he's the one who is catcher, you know, who catches. But you know what I exactly mean? I mean, for example, first round, almost equal, and second round, like, he's open and exhausted, but he's even faster. He's even faster. Second round, he's even faster. It's because of faster, but the guy is, as you said, a little bit exhausted, and he doesn't get exhausted. Yeah, he was just...
SPEAKER_01: I mean, every round becomes easier for him. Evgeny when he pulled against Hermes, the round one, he was just like here, if you remember. And then, yeah, I mean, once he gets the control, then the things are very well. Somebody just asked if, okay, Laguia, if Morozov ever beat this, I don't know, in hook. He knows that he beat him in top row. I haven't seen them lately.
SPEAKER_01: and it would be a good match if they go inside because i think this i don't know hook versus hook one of the strongest i i would like to see this i don't know versus genetic yeah inside i think i think i think it would just the event usually takes five hours this one would take six hours for sure you know
SPEAKER_01: That's what I believe, because Di Zerano inside is very, very strong. But also Gennady. They will be so long. Yeah, that's why I say long, because we all know about Gennady, but not many people know about Di Zerano. We will see. We will see. And if we go very shortly, what do you think about Morozov versus Adam in July 6th?
SPEAKER_00: I want to be short. Previously Vitalii was uncomfortable for Morozov. So he raised his style. We speak about this. Artem was just during that day when they practiced, they see that he is uncomfortable. You're talking about three or four years ago, right? Yes.
SPEAKER_00: So what I said about now, Artem knows where he's good and where he's not good enough. And he has a very nice coach, Getalo, who does very good work with him in the team.
SPEAKER_00: And I believe that now Artem will have a couple of moments, not only one moment, but a couple of moments. I believe he really will be unexpected. He can go to the floor press, he can go to the triceps, he can do... If he will see that wrist is not work, he can do, you know... I believe that yes, that he can do something with the floor press. Do you think that he can even in a defensive position can hold like this?
SPEAKER_00: In defence, maybe not. Maybe not, but he can be very tight, lose a little bit here, but not too much. So you are saying he cannot go out at all? I say that probably he will try, but if it doesn't work, I think he will do something else. Sometimes you can also switch to...
SPEAKER_01: dead wrist shoulder pressure after you secure your arm, your hand goes, but like the way that Hermes pulled against Levan. He did the back pressure, he lost the wrist, but his arm was still holding. Because Rivas' wrist is not so... Not Rivas, sorry. Vitalii's wrist is not super dominating wrist like this. It's just more like, you know, you see often that
SPEAKER_01: he may lose his wrist you know like i'm not saying all the time but with hermes happened with reva's first round of course he was a little bit high but and later with levan he's he's incredible but he's risked that the copying is not like a killer one like this but mostly you know you know it's just yeah yeah yeah so how i believe that for italy i believe that vitale have only one minus for example he have style which is always work
SPEAKER_00: if this style not work, he have troubles. And what I hear that, for example, for him, he wants to be bigger, but he's not like easily go to the gain some ways. But about wrist, for some guys, it's, you know, uncomfortable. For example, I know for myself with Vitalii, it's about high wrist. So it's not usual thing.
SPEAKER_00: You need to be on the strap, you need to do special thing to beat him. Because, you know, like if he has his weapon, he's actually very fast on the start. He goes from the, like, not hard wrist, but from the soft wrist, he goes very fast, yeah? And to beat him, you need to do something special. And I believe, I want to believe that Artem understands this now.
SPEAKER_00: So you are saying that Artem has changed as much as you see like a 50-50 match? I will put Vitalii in the slight favorite, but from Vitalii, I know what to expect. From Artem, I know that Artem can do something more because we don't say that Artem is still the same. Sometimes guys are already on the level when they don't change too much.
SPEAKER_01: Artem, I believe, now... Still growing. Still growing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And do you see... Do you see, how to say, yourself underdog against anyone in top 10? If we just exclude Levan, it's a different subject. Do you see yourself favored against anyone in top 10? Is there like a trap question?
SPEAKER_01: Honestly, I would say that I'm almost always not under that 50%. So you are saying that from Devon to down to the number 10, you are not underdog against anyone? I can be equal or a little bit higher. Higher. Okay. Just say that. Let me go there. How do you see yourself with Hermes? I heard that he's going to be your guest soon.
SPEAKER_00: Hermes is very powerful. I don't see too much chances of myself with Hermes. Hermes is so dangerous and with Hermes I need to be more smart than strong. Wow. Is that how you really feel?
SPEAKER_01: You know too much about every one of us, and honestly, without our answering, you already know the answer. I know your answer, but these things need to be talked. The fans need to know how you feel, how Hermes feels. I talk with you,
SPEAKER_01: I see a different perspective. I talked with Hermes. I see a different perspective. So some things need to be handled at the table sooner or later. For sure. Yeah. OK. So what do you think about Samushia versus Sasho? Sasho, do you think that finally he will be the one to finish? How much Sasho needs to cut down? How much kilos? He was 90 kilos, the Europeans.
SPEAKER_01: At the East versus West, he is usually 95, near 95, but this time he needs to be 85. You know, I know it's weird, but I still put on Samushia.
SPEAKER_00: I'm still put on Samushia. I don't know why because I watched the match Sasho vs. Evgeny when Sasho beat Evgeny on the vault, you know, in the past. I saw Sasho in the weird position, like so strong guys try to do something and he was inside. If it's inside, it was always Sasho. Always. And it will be inside. And I still believe that it will be Samushia. You know why?
SPEAKER_00: I think that Samushia is perfect in his weight. And his endurance is also very good. Yes. And I believe that Sasho loses a little bit something when he goes 285. Okay. And what do you think about Petro Marharint versus David Dadikyan? 105 kilo world title match. If Petro is in good shape, it's Petro. Yeah. Dadikyan says that
SPEAKER_01: he's just different level okay okay table show what what will be i will be in the corner of petro iraqli versus prudnik 105. uh right hand yes yes good match huh yeah good match good match very equal match very equal match hard to go anywhere yeah um
SPEAKER_00: also about motivation of evgeny i wants to see him motivated because sometimes in the past i believe he was uh in the match but like i need to be honest with you he was not in 100 preparation i was i know i saw him in 100 of his preparation and this is different prudnik uh in the last matches prudnik was dangerous prudnik was experienced
SPEAKER_00: Prudnik was strong, but Prudnik was not 100%. Do you know that his Devon match, this will be his first match with right arm? Yeah, yeah. He was a little bit injured. He tells me that it was something. Injured, injured, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's why also I don't know did he really recover or not. Like, it will be test for him because, you know. So you are saying 50-50 match? Yeah. Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Travis Bagent versus Serhii Kalinichenko. David you see what Serhii called him? Yeah, I saw everything. He called him Trans Bagent. And then I told this to Travis. Travis didn't believe. And then I sent him the screenshot and he just laughed so hard. He said, Engin, this guy knows how to throw punches, but
SPEAKER_01: Is he good at handling as well? I said, as long as you don't involve country, family or something, just fire him. Because the guy deserves it, you know. He's just, every day he's messing with... And I didn't even ask him to promote or something. Right now, we didn't start the promotion. He's naturally, he loves it. He's naturally, I'm telling you, Kalinichenko versus Travis is just like a perfect, perfect matchup. Yeah. In any way.
SPEAKER_00: And I was speaking with Sergei, and he's so excited. He got me word. I also, in the past, gave him some word, and I keep my word. It's between us. He knows what it's about. And he gave me the word he will beat Travis. I know it's not easy, but I know how serious he is. I know, I know, I know. Very, very serious. Yeah. I think he is one of those guys that really breathed arm wrestling.
SPEAKER_00: yeah he'll you know he breathed by arm wrestling he loved arm wrestling he loved the process he loved the teach he loved the pool he loved the practice he loved everything and uh he's very passionate and this day is very special for him he have some time for preparation and uh i also want to see i saw that travis won some matches local matches in the in the us but uh i'm still don't know
SPEAKER_00: What is with his shape?
SPEAKER_00: But I'm sure that we will be very intermediate. I mean, it will be so exciting because both guys will bring one of the best talking during the conference. You will see. They may bring some gifts to each other. There will be maybe some songs to each other. They will make some paintings, everything. I believe it will be very nice. I have no doubt. I have no doubt.
SPEAKER_01: Tatachins versus Krasimir Kostadinov. I see Krasimir lately is different. Krasimir is the way that he won left arm Europeans. He didn't pull right arm. He's saving his right arm for Tatachins, but the way that he won was very dominant against the current world champion. And what do you think about this match?
SPEAKER_00: i think todd will be not so comfortable opponent for grassy grassy sometimes wearing durable he can hold the pressure and after that when he he's open and exhausted he come back uh about flash pin of grassy i don't see that he will flash pin todd you know i think uh i think by stylistically it's more about todd that day okay about style
SPEAKER_00: Okay, Barbora versus Egle. Open category world title match. Barbora is 11th of the female category. I think she's power is phenomenal. I don't see anyone can beat her. Really, I don't see anyone. Maybe somebody will train, bring something very seriously. I wouldn't underestimate Egle. I have seen their practice pool. I know Egle is the real world. I have seen their practice pool, but it was some time ago.
SPEAKER_01: And Egle, especially, I was very surprised the way Egle beat Sara. I didn't expect. If I would pull Sara, I think it couldn't be any easier. Not to suspect Sara is incredible. Incredible. But Egle that day, I don't understand how she did. She was just like super dominant. I think one of the rounds she went inside and beat her.
SPEAKER_00: angela is honestly very fantastically strong but for example you know when when you already complete a wrestler you have the power to add to 100 it's not easy and barbara have so potential you know she have very big potential to become stronger than she is she already very strong but she can be even stronger and that's why i see it's very hard to beat her because
SPEAKER_01: You know, it's hard to do something with score. I don't know. Maybe some... I hope, maybe, maybe. I'm still trying. So far, no luck. But if I can bring Irina Makeva, the things will be even more fun in the female arm wrestling. Maybe. You know Irina Makeva, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And what do you think about Chance Shaw versus Ibragim Sagov?
SPEAKER_01: Chance is doing very well for the people who are coming towards to Chance beat Zurab easily and Zurab beat Sagov but it was in 95 kilo category this one will be 115 and but Sagov beat Sandris and Sandris beat Chance but that also was two years ago
SPEAKER_00: So they both are teasing each other about whom they beat. He's like, I beat Sandris, he beat you. And he says, I beat Zurab and he beat you. And what do you think about this one? So for me, before, like, Sagov and Sandris, I was putting on the Sandris. I was thinking that he will be able to take away, not to be, like, too tight. Like, he will take the wrist of his opponent. I was thinking like this.
SPEAKER_00: But Tago was available to go inside deeply, and he's comfortable when he goes to the hook or press. He even goes deeply and tries a little bit to press. But Chainz, I believe he will not let... It will be something like a flop press of his opponent, but I don't think that this time Chainz will let to hook him.
SPEAKER_00: don't see you know but because chains always little bit bigger yeah what the uh this this match will be in 115 kilo ah okay still still something says me that chains uh will be the guy who will open the wrist but if uh sago go inside yeah you know it will be trouble but but i think chains have all the chances to take the wrist but honestly i can be very easy wrong why
SPEAKER_00: because with sundries i also was thinking that sundries will take the wrist that's why like i will be not surprised if sago won even easily than with i mean sago will be won easily within the sundries with chains but like some logic tells me that chains will take the wrist and chains will take the angle and chains will
SPEAKER_01: in the saga but you know are making unpredictable sometimes this is very good matchup two different like yeah they both have they both do very well against those kind of style you know anyway so adam warsonski versus vladimir mairo oh i said vladimir so it is uh alexander travis travis calls him alexandria you always uh call everyone alexander
SPEAKER_01: And you are the only one, only Alex, so he called you only. Yeah, it was too easy, even shorter ways, that's why. You know, I think Maiorov. Maiorov? I think it will be a very long hook match because Adam is also incredible inside and he has great endurance and I think it will be a great match, yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Do you know Dimitrina Petro? Yeah. The Bulgarian girl, 60 kilo, current European and world champion. And you ever heard Ayane from Japan? Sure. I was in the same World Cup when she was fighting. I remember. She won the last year the WAF in Kazakhstan. I was not watching the WAF, but I even remember the past when, like, I know that...
SPEAKER_01: she have some spirit you know she have some spirit of warrior sometimes you know you know forearms is huge she does like one arm pull up and things like that so she is basically 55 kilo walk champion and uh dimitrina is the 60 kilo champion so they both will be 60 kilo and this is for world title how do you see this match
SPEAKER_00: so i think it will be about speed about wrist and uh some inner voice says that yes that aim can be stronger with this new waist category for her you know because for ghosts these kilos make difference and if she accept she know what she will do uh i would say that it will be
SPEAKER_00: very nice equal match but i think that who will be faster who will be taking the wrist or or like that girl will be the winner okay you ever heard olga terpelova yes she is going to pull carolina peterson oh i'm not sure you know carolina is
SPEAKER_00: very dangerous opponent so did they ever pull before i don't think so carolina is you know his dangerous opponent and uh very dangerous it's not only about the power it's about style so i think like uh carolina is the favorite but you know everything can happen but like
SPEAKER_00: Like when, you know, when you ask me, I set the match to the ready goal and something like imagination show what will be after. And in this way, imagination says that it's hard to do something with Carolina. So you are single. And then Tom, Tom Rosic, you know him? Not really too much. I watched him, but not too much. He recently beat Oleg Zok one round with left arm. Ah, now I know.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, now I know. And he won the right arm. He's going to pull Artem Taranenko. This is going to be a left arm match. Artem was 90 kilos? So how much was? The match will be 85 kilos. So Artem needs to cut a little bit, yeah? I think he's 85 kilos as of now. Really? Now? I was thinking he's at least 90. Okay. So, you know...
SPEAKER_00: Artem was not fighting in a WAF. I know a little bit his level. He's a very strong guy. He's very good on the setup. But, you know, WAF is always a very good test. So if you won WAF, nowadays, it means that you're available and measured. You find the way with different hands, different forearms, different start. When you won WAF, nowadays, it's a good test for you. That's why...
SPEAKER_01: I put VARF champion like a slight favorite. Yeah, he won Europeans, not the VARF. With right arm he won, left arm he lost to Oleg Dzhok 2-1 and he took second place at the Europeans. But you know what I mean? Oleg is very special by the... I mean, if you are taking second to Oleg, usually you won the event, you know. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, this one is also world title with left arm. Daniel Prokopchuk versus Bozhidar Simeonov. These two pulled last year at the World Combat Games in Saudi Arabia and Bozhidar beat Daniel with left arm. I remember, yeah. You know, something weird in this category.
SPEAKER_00: this is left arm this is left arm okay but still i need to i need to tell you what i think about right arm right arm yeah and you know it was honestly i need to be honest with you i was thinking that yeah arthur beat mindagos mindagos beat daniel daniel beat alan alan beat arthur
SPEAKER_01: And there is Cercasov that Minda was beating him in at least three, four different events, including Supermatch. He beat him all the time they faced. And Cercasov beat Artur, Artur beat Minda. So it is just a circle. Everyone beats everyone. So I don't know. I don't know. But this is left arm. Daniel is the champion of this category with left arm. He beat Emil Amirshadian. And now he's going to...
SPEAKER_01: pull Mindaugas. According to what I remember, they will pull with Bozhidar, yeah, now. I remember that Bozhidar was stronger on the right, but he was also very strong on the left. Yeah, he was, yeah. He also took many times against Oleg Zok, I think second place. I remember this once, yeah. So Bozhidar's left arm is also very, very strong. I remember he even has a win over Krasimir with left arm.
SPEAKER_00: so it's even said even more about his left you know this is will be for sure one of the best interested matches so it will be for sure very interesting it will be showed the level i i put steel pulled prokopchuk like a slight favorite but like you see guys do some magic sometimes like taras tight is honestly will do some magic and bojidar is a guy who also
SPEAKER_00: stylistically can be dangerous for the Prokopchuk because I think he will not go to inside he will be trying left arm left arm he pulls outside control here rescuer and goes out with right arm he was going inside he got injured I don't know how his left arm right now yeah but yeah I think he will be all the rounds he will be attacking the fingers of Daniel he will be trying everything but still still I put Daniel like a favorite
SPEAKER_00: What do you think about the July card? Amazing card. Very fantastic card. The main thing is knowledge. I'm really interested in level and some matches will be the answer to the difference between the guys. Some matches are very special for me. I'm very interested in them. You know these matches.
SPEAKER_00: But all the matches are fantastic. And now we have like, we have pretenders, we have champions.
SPEAKER_00: And we have so close level, which really professional level, when the guys, for example, when we see about Prokopchuk, Tarataitis, Alain Zaloyev and, you know, Makarov. We have the guys like this guy can beat this guy, this guy can beat this. And it makes very interesting the matches between them. Like even I think one day champion can win with another guy. But like after two months or three months, it can be opposite.
SPEAKER_00: And that's why it will be very interesting. Now armwrestling, I believe, is growing very well. Now we have more science in armwrestling, more studies, more training. Armwrestling is becoming more and more popular. And now it's like a big sport.
SPEAKER_01: In Italy, the East vs. West qualification, the Supermatch event, I think you were there, there were more than 500 athletes, not the entry, arm entry, 500 athletes. I talked with Norwegians, they said that in the history, their biggest nationals were 140 people, last one was 220. Germany was like three years ago, 90 people, last German nationals, 270.
SPEAKER_01: Romania, almost 400. Turkish nationals was over 1,700. The European championships was almost 1,000 people with the absence of Russia. It would be like 1,200 if there was a full team coming from there. And I think that it is growing. It is growing. Like whenever people says that I am an arm luster,
SPEAKER_01: they are more proud now they can they can go and show when they say arm wrestling what is it they can show just say east versus west they can show king of the table and they have something and they are more proud like even kennedy told me that he is now very proud to say he's an arm master last a few years you know and i think if we will just grow um i'm not planning to do this
SPEAKER_01: forever. It is really exhausting. But once I give the flag to the next person, next level, then I will be doing my part. And then some people are afraid that I will be doing forever. No, I will not do it. But I'm not going to leave it to people who will divide the sport again. So that's all. Anyways, Alex, thank you very much for joining the podcast. Always great pleasure. Always you are intelligent. You have
SPEAKER_01: open mind, you are brave to speak what you are thinking, except about Hermes. Just joking. He's always more my friend than my opponent. He knows this. Okay, okay, okay. Anyway, so is there anything you want to say lastly? First of all, I want to say I'm not agree what you said. I want you stay what you're doing because you're doing this with heart. Now, sometimes we have businessmen
SPEAKER_00: In the you know in the Federation sometimes we have the guys who was like not athlete you are Athletes who knows and understand athletes. That's why you know, I can tell it to you I can tend to everyone you understand us you understand what is important for us. That's why you are the beautiful bridge from the athletes to
SPEAKER_00: to the public you know how to do the show but you also can bring to the public the beautiful show the best possible i believe that i will i'm the fan fan of you guys yeah you guys you know just i mean
SPEAKER_01: you also defend but you also understand you all understand people who work but you also understand i have been an arm master as well successful arm master i understand how you feel i understand what you dream because i had those dreams exactly i don't think that anyone should be running this that that they haven't been in the same place that athletes i i know how you feel and whenever you have passion it excites me in fact you know
SPEAKER_01: like just like whenever i look at for example nugo you know the guy you see how passionate he is you know he he whenever i look at him you know like he lost the match against petro marharin he was sitting there and he was just looking down like this and during the event i'm very busy with the other matches and i just went other side of the uh auditorium and i i told him i said don't worry i will invite you again just don't bring your head down just you did very well you know
SPEAKER_01: And then he was very happy. So for me, it is the problem. Whenever I know that he's down, he feels bad. He feels like, oh, I wasted my opportunity. You know, everything finished. No, no, he didn't finish. I see your passion. I saw your performance. I see how hungry you are to prove yourself. But not everyone understand that.
SPEAKER_00: Exactly. That's why I say that it's beautiful that we have the perfect bridge. You are the perfect bridge from the people watching to the people who are creating. You are actually like creating this, but you have all the skills and you also have the heart. Because if somebody do this only for business, it will not work like this. You do it with the heart. That's why. Of course, of course. But I need to look at it from business perspective as well. Otherwise, we cannot grow this.
SPEAKER_01: We cannot take more financially and then grow. It's impossible. We need to grow. We need to pay athletes more with time and everything. Anyways, there is one guy that is upset that I didn't ask his question. He's saying that who's going to win, Levan or Alijan, when Levan comes back? This is what he's asking. Alijan is a very fantastic guy, very special. Do you think that he has a chance to become the best or not at all?
SPEAKER_00: I would say that he is the best pound of the pound, but it will be hard to beat somebody who is so big and too strong. He is the best for sure in his weight category, but to beat Vitalii or Levan or some heavyweights, you need just to be strong. Does it include you? It's including me. Including me also. One second.
SPEAKER_01: You watching the podcast? Actually, this is a good question because we speak about right, but I have my left. If I lose to Artem, it doesn't mean that I will not chase him there. I will for sure chase him there. No, no, no. If it was like that, then Hermes should never pull Levan again. Dewey should never pull Levan again. Vitalii should never pull Levan again. Of course, you're going to come back just because you lost one match. It doesn't mean that, you know...
SPEAKER_01: your chance of becoming number one finish you know it was only beginning i remember what you were saying and you know i've been away from arm wrestling and doesn't matter if i lose or win i will win anyways i will learn a lot and this will be my comeback and you perform very good that day you lost for two but whenever i remember that match i remember something like this yeah yeah yeah anyways once again thank you alex you have a wonderful
SPEAKER_00: evening and hope to see you very soon thank you ending thank you for everything you're doing i wish you all the best the same you do doing the same style and thank everyone who supports and who watching us who love our wrestling we will do all the best to keep your interest yeah like whole family thank you bye-bye
