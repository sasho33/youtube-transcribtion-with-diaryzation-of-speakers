SPEAKER_00: Just because he is ranked number one with left arm, it doesn't mean his left arm is stronger than his right arm. I have no doubt that his right arm is stronger. But the right arm competition is tougher than the left arm competition, in my opinion. Hello to Philippines. Armwrestling. JD. Richard Lapkus. I asked Michael. Michael and Richard are good friends.

SPEAKER_00: some names I can't read but hello to you guys um just Jake hello hello my friends hello I'm tired exhausted but still working the problem with me is that I don't know if it's a good nature or bad nature but I I don't know how to give up
SPEAKER_00: So that is even when I'm exhausted, I'm working. Hello, Pablo, again. Great to see you. Good to see you too. I was just talking, chatting with the fans who are here to watch. But since you are here, let me focus this side. Oh, okay.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I don't know why it is, my friend. I don't know why it was lagging. I don't know why it is now fine. But Vitalii just broke grip world record with right hand, 164. Yeah. Listen, whenever you are arm wrestling against Vitalii, I mean, if I was arm wrestle, if I was big enough and arm wrestle him, my first worry would be like how to slip my hand and go to strap. He could literally break your fingers, you know.
SPEAKER_01: could literally do you agree that the guy is just like every time somebody's trying to sleep you need to be very very strong yeah what do you think paulo yeah from vitalis grip and the size of the hand uh i don't know it's uh it's uh tough uh camille was doing a okay job slipping from him underneath
SPEAKER_00: yeah because because because he was not trying to open this way but he was just actually going here you know but this is very very hard to yeah but that's a little bit utopic because then you have to press every time because you will damage your own uh cutting unless you are coming which you you prefer to pull that way right yeah yeah well i wouldn't yeah i wouldn't want it yeah he could he could just he could just really hurt you you know just
SPEAKER_00: that I think that Morozov will also have some problems, you know. Maybe, did you see it today, Vitalii, is that gripping thing? Yeah, he shared it while Morozov shared the pronation training. And they are talking about something. I think, like, Morozov said something like, the real man doesn't top roll or something. What was that, the horseback, horseback, what is that horseback?
SPEAKER_00: horseback in russians means like top roll or something or hook hook okay i was like like what's this horseback you know so so basically morozov is saying that same like krasimir says like real men hooks and and laletin shared a video that when morozov is going outside and then he is questioning like so if you're a real man why were you top rolling you know and yeah
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, they're joking and playing around. Yeah, yeah, yeah. They are teasing each other. Same as like Hermes says that smart people top roll, Krasimir says real men hooks, you know. And I comment on that. I said, well, you know, who top roll, who cares? You need side. Yeah, you need side. Yeah, everyone needs side. It doesn't matter what you are doing, in my opinion, unless you are arm wrestling like this, you know. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: which which i call desperation move if the shoulder is like the if the humerus is down angle i call it desperation if the shoulder is above then i call it open on top roll somebody came who is that you don't know yet yes hi again how are you hello how are you good very good something can you close because i hear my voice when i talk but now it's okay yeah
SPEAKER_02: Artem you ready, Artyom? You ready?
SPEAKER_00: What's going on Vitalii? Today you share the video with the finger press. Is this a message to Morozov that you cannot sleep from my hand?
SPEAKER_01: He's saying, no, it's not a message yet. In two weeks I will press 170 kilos and then it's going to be a message.
SPEAKER_00: So it will be like, you know, there is no way to go to strap. No way. And Artem today shared the pronation with you. It means that I will open Laletin's fingers.
SPEAKER_01: He said, no, no, fingers will hold. We're going to open up the wrist. Oh, he's going to open the wrist? Yeah, but I thought that only girls would arm wrestle outside.
SPEAKER_01: He said he thought that only girls fight with the top. Well, in fact, girls mostly fight with the top, right? But my coach scolded me yesterday, made me swing the top, said we will fight with the top. Yeah, he said, as a fact, yeah, most of the girls pulling outside, but my trainer tell me, you know what, it's all wrong, you have to train your top. So he said, I have to.
SPEAKER_01: I was right. If you're going to look at the girls arm wrestling, most of it is top roll. It's very rarely you will see a hook.
SPEAKER_00: yeah yeah it is not even really top roll is more like finger to finger pulling there yes yes yeah anyway so uh and and what what does vitale think about this about the girls top roll men hook
SPEAKER_01: Vitalii is saying that Artyom can pull a tap roll like a girl and I will hook him up like I did when Artyom was visiting us at Siberian Power Shaw.
SPEAKER_02: I've been doing whatever I want. I'll give you a video. I'll give you a video. I'll give you a video. I'll give you a video. I'll give you a video. I'll give you a video. I'll give you a video. I'll give you a video. I'll give you a video. I'll give you a video.
SPEAKER_01: It's not going to happen like that, that's what he means. Artyom, now you've gained weight, you've become heavier, and it won't happen again, right? It's all over now. Steel Morozov. Steel. Steel. Steel Morozov now? Steel Morozov now, yeah. Okay. I'll put it this way. Artyom gained 15 kilos during this time, and I gained 20. Vitalii is saying that Artyom gained 15 kilos, and Vitalii gained 20 kilos.
SPEAKER_01: Or since that time? Since the Siberian event? Yeah, he's saying the last time they were pulling with Artyom, he was 120 kg. Yeah, but I think that it is not about the weight. It is more about how long...
SPEAKER_00: the athletes have been in the sport. When he did that, Artem was just like past the youth category. And now he has been competing last two, three years. And I think he is more experienced, more became like man from like, not the child, but very young to do, you know, does he not think that way?
SPEAKER_01: Vitalii, Engin says that it depends not only on the size, but when you fought with him, Artem only fought with juniors and adults, and he says that in the last few years he has been fighting at a high level, and of course he has matured and turned from a teenager to a mature man. Do you think this also matters?
SPEAKER_01: Yes, of course, it matters, but a good armwrestler is stronger only at the age of 40. When Artem will be 40, I will be 50. Then I will be afraid of him. And now I'm not afraid of him. Vitalii is saying that a good armwrestler is getting to his peak at about 40. And he's saying, yeah, well, I'm not afraid of him right now, but maybe when I'm going to be 50 and Artem will be 40, then maybe the situation will be different.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, Artem, last year you had some stomach issues and before that your shape was incredible. Do you think that you will be near that shape or at that shape? Like you were getting ready for Levan match and do you think that you will again be near that shape?
SPEAKER_01: They say that before you got a stomachache, you had problems with your stomach, you had a fantastic shape, just awesome. They ask, how do you think, will you be able to gain the same shape this time? Well, I'm already, in principle, I'll even say, I've gotten better somewhere. Well, that is, if you judge by the weight, somewhere better.
SPEAKER_02: Okay. Okay. Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Artyom is saying that he's already in that shape approximately and even some of the weights he's lifting even better. And he said the technique changes every time. And Artyom is saying that I'm already about 40 years old. And Vitalii is joking. So you're going to start pulling top rolls, right? And does Artyom think that Vitalii is in trouble?
SPEAKER_01: Artyom, do you think Vitalii has a problem? No, well, damn it. I think so. Well, depending on what. Vitalii is fine, but behind the table problems can happen. Artyom is saying, well, depends on what, but I think yes. He said, yeah, Vitalii is fine, but on the table there may be a problem.
SPEAKER_00: will be a travel for him okay and and uh artom when you see camille and dave chaffee doing this to uh lalatin now does it in your options the flop wrist
SPEAKER_01: After you saw Chaffee and Kamil Flap Press or Vitalii, did you have it as a certain option or did you include it in your Flap Press arsenal? If my stomach hurts again, I'll have to do Flap Press. And since I'm healthy, I'm not going to do that. Well done!
SPEAKER_01: he said only if my stomach will hurt then i will do a flat press but if i'm healthy no way i don't have to okay okay says you're the best we tell it can anybody on this earth hook you in your opinion italy
SPEAKER_01: It's been a long time since I've been hooked. It's been a very long time since I've been hooked. I don't think Artyom can do it. He's saying that it was a long time since somebody hooked me, and he said he thinks Artyom will not be able to hook you. Wait, Artyom, you can't hook me, but I can hook you myself.
SPEAKER_02: I think Vitalii has forgotten how to fight hookers, because everyone is fighting with him. But we'll try to show him, so he remembers. Vitalii says, Artyom, you know what, don't worry about it, I will hook you myself. And Artyom says, you know what, let's go.
SPEAKER_01: Come on, come on. Artyom says to Vitalii, you know what, you probably forgot how to pull against the good hookers because everybody is trying to tap roll your flop press. But personally, I don't believe Vitalii will hook Morozov. Personally. Engin says, I personally don't believe that you, Vitalii, will turn into Morozov's club.
SPEAKER_01: It depends on how much I'm willing to pay for it. Engin, it depends on the money amount. Money? Yes. What do you mean? What does it mean? How much you want to pay him for hooking Morozov. Listen, hooking Morozov or beating Morozov in hook?
SPEAKER_00: Vitalii is saying that he's going to win three times top row and two times hook. And he's going to win all five. Okay, listen. After three times, the match is over. It's best of five. But is he going to put him at the side table or what?
SPEAKER_01: He says, after three wins, the match is over, because it's the best of the five. He says, you will win in hooks on the afterpool, on the side table. Yes, it will be the most beautiful backstage fight. He says, what is he talking about? He says that he will wrap you up in a hook and win.
SPEAKER_00: He thinks that Vitalii is dreaming about this, but what can I do about it? Is it because of the time differences from Dubai to where he lives in Siberia? Do you think it messed him up?
SPEAKER_01: Because of what? Because of the big difference between Dubai and Siberia? He says, maybe it's a little foggy for him. Maybe. Maybe. Vitalii says, how can this guy beat you? Top roll?
SPEAKER_02: Well, he will open my fingers with his brush, as he will beat me through the top, but he will not go into the corner. Only the press remains here, but he will say again, I have a stomachache, so I have to fight in the press, right? No, I'll say that I'm fine with my stomach, I'm like this, the press, how to call it, I will not use bad technique. By the way, I recently realized that it turns out that the girls are not fighting at the top.
SPEAKER_01: Girls fight with the press. Vitalii is saying that, listen, I don't see it because he will not open up my wrist and fingers. That's impossible. It's impossible that Artyom will hook me. So it's the only option, press. And he's saying that he's not going to do it unless his stomach hurts. And Artyom says, yeah, no, no, no, I will not do it. And not too long ago, I understood.
SPEAKER_00: that the girls pulling not top roll, but press. Okay, okay. So, so then, like, how is it gonna happen? Like, Morozov, what does he say that, how is he gonna beat him? Artem, how are you going to win? Well, I'm going to win at the top. Then I'm going to hold on to the hook a little bit. Artem, wait for me, I need some noodles.
SPEAKER_01: yeah i'm saying that uh he will win top role and then he will hold him up a little bit in the hook and win again and uh vital is saying this is allegorical that he has some spaghetti hanging off his ears
SPEAKER_01: even somebody yeah yeah or lying that means in russian we are saying that we have some spaghetti hanging of the year it means that he's lying yes so like he means that he doesn't believe in what he's saying okay okay okay we tell you shortly what percentage chance this guy has against you in your opinion
SPEAKER_01: I think we have a 50-50 ratio. Vitalii is saying that he thinks that it's 50-50. 50-50. He said that he's going to beat him in hook. He cannot top roll him, and now he's saying 50-50. I don't understand that part. Alex, it's all wrong now. You said you won. I was talking about the hook, about the top 100%. Okay, the hook is 50-50, and the top 100%. Hook 50-50, but top roll is 100%.
SPEAKER_00: So Vitalii is saying that if he topples him, like he does his technique, Morozov has no chance? No chance. 100% Vitalii. Artem, this guy has no respect for you. Yeah, I understand. You understand, right? He says, this guy has no respect for you. When he said 50-50, I thought, damn, what a good guy. And then when he said 100%, I thought, that's it, you're done for.
SPEAKER_00: Artyom was saying, when I heard 50-50, I'm thinking, what a good guy. And then when I heard that there's no chance at the top rope, he's like, that's it, I'm going to murder you. He's going to murder him. Okay, now we're talking about it. Okay, now I understand. Okay, let's talk a little bit what happened last week. Vitalii, did you expect such trouble against Kamil?
SPEAKER_02: And Vitalii, I have a question for you about last week. What happened? David you expect it to be so bad and hard with Kamil? Yes, of course, I expected it to be hard for him. But after the tournament, we stood at the table and he asked me to hold him, he went up. He couldn't move me from the place at all. That is, if it was an honest fight from top to top, or he would have tried to hook me.
SPEAKER_02: I would have won anyway. But since this is a new fight for me, and the rules allow him to attack my hand, to attack my side, then, of course, it was hard for me, because I came with the WAH rules.
SPEAKER_01: okay yeah without this saying yeah i expected something like that uh after pool showed that there was no chance uh top roll or hook doesn't matter vitality was very comfortably holding him but he says yeah this is these rules are a little bit different and they allow him to you know to be so far behind and uh push all his weight on his side of the body and he said
SPEAKER_00: I used to waft rules mostly, and these rules are a little bit alternate. That's why it was very hard. So he's saying he was too close? Yes, too close. That's what he said. And Vitalii, did you expect Ivan Matushenko to travel Morozov at the center here?
SPEAKER_00: When the match was stopped at the center, I was thinking that if Morozov would stop Matushenko at the center, Matushenko couldn't do anything. But Matushenko was still effective. David you expect such power being very close? Vitalii, a question for you. David you imagine that there would be such a fight between Artem and Ivan Matushenko? Because, as Engin says, I imagined that if Artem...
SPEAKER_01: If Ivan stops him in the middle of the table, then Ivan has no chance. But he was very surprised when he fought so effectively in the middle of the table and that the level of power was very close to the level. David you expect something like this? Could you imagine that this is how the fight will go?
SPEAKER_02: I didn't expect this, I expected that Ivan would start too quickly and beat Artyom with a pillow. But Artyom scared Ivan so much that Ivan couldn't start. And Artyom kept him.
SPEAKER_01: yeah uh vitale is saying that yeah he did not expect such a thing uh he was expecting that maybe ivan would be fast enough to just flash pin you know after starting uh but yeah uh uh artyom scared the one a little bit yeah uh of the of the goals and he's been holding him at the center so that's that's how it happens and and you are tom
SPEAKER_02: David Matushenko's power surprise you? No, he didn't surprise me. We were ready for it. We were training. My elbow didn't recover after the Kurdetsh fight.
SPEAKER_02: We treated him, treated him, and then we started training. And my chest was torn up during the attack, when I was doing the attacking movement. And for two months we did not train in the block, well, lateral movement. And it was only left to keep the biceps. Why? In the center, when we got up, I kind of started, but there was no confidence that I would be able to knock down the center without damaging my chest. Well, you understand, right?
SPEAKER_01: That's why I just held on. Our task was to just tire him out. I see. There were some specific moments in training and preparation. Artyom was fully aware of speed and power. He expected something like that. But there was some injury during preparation about two months ago. They've been working on his elbow for all this time after the Krudechev match.
SPEAKER_01: and this was pretty covered so they make an accent on the side pressure and when he was working on his side starts he damaged his back a little bit yes oh and they start healing the back so there was some limitations to his movements so he looked very static at the same day he didn't look
SPEAKER_01: yeah he's been working mostly on his arm and the bicep and uh he said that strategy to hold him up a little bit to uh you know wear him out to make him tired and then it happens we tell you is your right or left stronger in your opinion if you're right and left with arm muscle against each other somehow which one would win
SPEAKER_01: Vitalii thinks that left arm would be a little bit better because that opening ability and finishing ability left side is better.
SPEAKER_00: So the leftist level is a little bit stronger. And like, if there was $100,000 on the table, and he could choose to pull Morozov right or left, which one would he choose? Because now we're talking about Morozov's left and right as well.
SPEAKER_02: Vitalii, $100,000 on the table, you have the right to choose which hand to fight with Artem, right or left, which one will you choose? Well, if he has $100,000, he can hold my left hand, and hold my right hand. Once again, sorry, I didn't get it. If he has $100,000 on the table, I can fight with him with my left hand, and he can hold my right hand.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, Vitalii is saying that if it's $100,000 on the table, we can pull left arm and Artyom can help himself with his right. Oh, Artyom, this guy has no respect for you. If there's $100,000 on the table, I'll fight like Camille. She said that if there's $100,000... Let's do 12 rounds.
SPEAKER_00: i i will pull like camille and please make it 12 uh 12 rounds ah okay okay okay so and and you artem artem i i don't know you know yourself better but in my opinion your right arm is stronger than your left arm but right arm competition a little bit
SPEAKER_00: tougher maybe, but this toughness also made your right arm stronger and stronger and stronger. But what is your opinion?
SPEAKER_01: Artyom, I have a question for you. My opinion, Engin's opinion. I think your right hand is a little stronger than your left hand. But just because the competition is a little different for the right hand and the left hand, so the rating is a little different. But again, this competition encourages you to make the right hand even stronger. Maybe I'm wrong, we would like to hear your opinion. What do you think, which hand is better and stronger?
SPEAKER_02: Well, I completely agree with Engin, I always said that my right is stronger. I don't know, there is no such exercise, for example, where the left is stronger than the right. The right always raises more, better. Well, because of the competition, of course, it is harder to fight with the right, because everyone is right-handed.
SPEAKER_01: I'm sorry, before I move on, Vitalii, what hand did you do your record with, left or right? Last month I did 160 kg with both hands, but this time I only did it with my right hand, because my left hand hurts.
SPEAKER_01: it okay uh engine yeah uh i'm saying that you're absolutely right uh and about competition about everything uh you just said about uh artyom's right and left and there is not not such of exercise where he can do it left hand but he cannot lift the same weight or better right hand
SPEAKER_01: And all you said about competition is right. And from myself, I just asked Vitalii which hand he did his record. And he said that last month he did 160 kilos on both hands the same. But this time 164 was right hand only because left is hurts a little bit. Because of the competition. And Vitalii,
SPEAKER_01: Who do you think has the biggest chance against you with a left arm if Artem can't beat you with two hands? Who's next in line? Who has the best chance against you with a left arm if Artem can't beat you with two hands? Who's left? Alex Kurdechev.
SPEAKER_01: Vitalii is saying that probably Alex Kurdeche is first in line. And he said, I would pull Kamil again if Kamil will learn how to pull properly. What do you mean how to pull properly? He wants him to pull top roller hook?
SPEAKER_01: What do you mean by fighting correctly? Top roll or hook? Yes. So it means that he cannot do well against that risk pressure? Like he wants to avoid it? But it's part of the game. Vitalii says, it's part of the game. The club press says you can't fight, it's hard for you.
SPEAKER_02: Against Artyom? No, against Kamil. The thing is, I don't fight like that, because I'm already old, my joints are worn out. I think Kamil will be enough for a long time with such a fight. But I prefer a traditional fight. But in this game, in this game that Kamil built, I will still win it.
SPEAKER_02: Look, Jerry has been fighting with his elbow for 50 years. I asked Kamil, I said, how are you going to fight Jerry? He says, we throw a coin, who wins, he gives the first brush.
SPEAKER_01: okay yeah uh vitale is saying you know i'm uh i think that uh traditional styles are uh more effective and better because of the injuries and he doesn't think that camille with his style will you know uh will be healthy for a long time uh then i mentioned jerry cadaret who is 50 and still
SPEAKER_01: doing very well so uh we did not have an answer for this because vitality said you know i'm old and my joints are uh not not good anymore and i don't want to pull this style but about you know jerry can read he make a comment listen i asked camille how you're gonna pull if you have to pull against jerry he said we're gonna flip the coin who is giving up the wrist first
SPEAKER_00: And listen, now Jerry wanted to pull in the Florida event, and we canceled that match. And he was going to originally pull against Vitalii. And does he think that it's good that the match has changed? Vitalii, what do you think? You were supposed to fight Jerry now, but the match was canceled. Do you think it's good that the match was canceled or not?
SPEAKER_02: Nothing good. I think you need to fight with everyone to find the strongest athlete. But I watched Jerry's fight. Jerry is not as strong as Kamil, he doesn't fall over too much. He holds, yes, on a broken wrist, but he doesn't put his shoulder forward too much and he doesn't throw his head at his opponent. Jerry has a secret weapon, he also helps with his tongue. Yes.
SPEAKER_01: plus that yeah uh vital is saying no there is nothing good about uh cancellation of the match because to find out who is uh better and stronger you have to pull everybody yeah but he doesn't like this style that's why i said okay commented that uh jerry's style is still a little bit different yes it's that flat press but jerry is not uh making those uh
SPEAKER_01: moves uh as obvious and he not crossing you know the center line of the table with his head or his you know the whole body so he's yet at risk but he's kind of still on his side of the table you know and then what did artem say uh artem says that uh they have a secret technique and he helping himself with a tongue he felt what oh okay you told me about jerry
SPEAKER_02: Yes. Okay. Does Vitalii think that Kamil's shoulder passed the center, across the center? Vitalii or Artem? Vitalii, Vitalii. Vitalii, do you think that Kamil's shoulder crossed the center or not? His head definitely crossed the center, and he constantly tried to push me with his shoulder. But you know what the problem was? When I said to him that it was his shoulder,
SPEAKER_02: They didn't stop the fight. Then at the end they said, give me your hand and we'll give you a rematch because you touched my shoulder. At least tell me that there was a foul. I don't know if you saw it or not. That's what the question was.
SPEAKER_01: Vitalii is saying that he's not sure about shoulder, but his head was definitely crossing the center of the table. His head? His head, yes. But he also said that there was a couple times when he touched the hand with his shoulder, which I cannot...
SPEAKER_01: i'm not sure how it's done uh so and he said that you know it was a little bit questionable moments where uh the referee says if you see that he's touching with his hand to his shoulder let the match go it always says listen i cannot do that because i'm in the match i'm not ref i don't know they saw that or maybe i'm mistaking so i need them the referees to tell me if there was a fall if he touched it then i would give it
SPEAKER_02: Okay, okay, he didn't see the sign that there was a running foul. But it wasn't a running foul, it should be a direct foul. No. Okay, yeah. I mean, it wasn't a fresh area, that's what Vitalii's saying. Okay, okay.
SPEAKER_01: Vitalii is saying, yeah, it's all good, but when he was touching his hand with his shoulder and trying to press with, you know, shoulder down, when Vitalii had been holding, he was spending huge amount of energy, you know. I understand. I understand. But basically, it looks like, you know, it went harder than he expected, probably. Yeah, this is what I'm thinking. But anyway, so Artem, do you think that
SPEAKER_01: the winner of you versus Vitalii deserves the title match against Levan? I think you can choose someone else if Vitalii agrees with his opinion. I think it's logical.
SPEAKER_02: For example, we still need to beat Hermes, I think, or Devon. Yes, Artem, I completely agree with you. Devon probably won't fight with us, because for some reason he doesn't want to fight with me. Well, okay, let it be his reasons. But Hermes, in any case, will need to be beaten. Yes.
SPEAKER_01: Artyom and Vitalii have approximately the same opinion about this. And they think that they will have to for sure pass Hermes. And if Devon will decide that he's staying in Supers, then Devon on the list too. If not, then there is an Hermes who they have to pass to get to Milan. I don't know if anytime soon there will be another Laletin versus Hermes match.
SPEAKER_00: But we know that Gennady is also coming. And we know that now Jerry and Alex Kurdeca, Alex beat Georgi Svetko. Now they are going to pull against each other. And then we will make a, yeah, there will be a decision, you know, where to do against who. Yeah, we will see. And Vitalii, do you see any danger about Alec Murado with left arm or not at all?
SPEAKER_01: I'll quickly translate what he said before. He says, yes, we will still make a decision, because Kvikvinia is still returning to the game. Plus, now there will be a match between Kurdecha and Kaderet. It is not known if Vitalii will win, then probably the match between Vitalii and Hermes should not take place again so quickly. But in a different way, he says, in general, we will decide. Here is such a mix that several athletes have returned, there will still be a couple of matches.
SPEAKER_02: And then he asked Vitalii, how do you think, is Olezhan Muratov a danger for you with his left hand? Olezhan is undoubtedly a very strong opponent, but I think it will be inconvenient for him to fight with him. But again, I think it all needs to be checked after we find out with Artem who is stronger with his left hand.
SPEAKER_01: um vital is saying that uh there is no doubt about adrian's power and that he's a very dangerous opponent and he said there is basically one way to find out to compete against him to compete against him and he said we're going to talk about future after we're going to find out who is better between me and our team and morozo you you want to rest a little bit huh you said that
SPEAKER_00: your elbow, now your pack, you know, you want to rest a little bit. People are asking me why this match is not left arm. I mean, the guy just pulled like not long ago and this match was not easy. I mean, Petro is going to pull Dadikyan, but his match wasn't as tough as this guy's matches. But he wants to rest a little bit.
SPEAKER_01: Artem, due to the fact that injuries began to appear, Engin asks, you will need a break a little, you will need to rest, recover, heal injuries, or do you think that... Well, I... I'm actually thinking about fighting a little bit on the right, because the left one in two years, it was, in my opinion, the eighth, the eighth fight was mine in two years, this one with Ivan, so...
SPEAKER_02: When I fought with Corey West, I had enough time to rest. But after Corey West, I had problems with my stomach. I lost a lot of weight, a lot of water, and my elbows started to hurt. Then, when I started training, it all made sense. Now, of course, I would like to fight more right.
SPEAKER_02: Well, Engin, you asked before, are we ready to win against Lebanon? Do you want me to defeat both Vitalii and Lebanon in one year? Let's just leave Lebanon.
SPEAKER_01: okay so uh first of all he said yeah uh i would love to pull more on the right side if possible because for last two years i've been pulling a lot he thinks it was eight matches within the last two years on the left side yeah
SPEAKER_01: because of the stomach problem and lose some water. You know, his joint was a little dry and they are not recovering properly. So he would love to pull more right this year than left if possible. And then he said, Engin, do you really want me to pull and win with Vitalii and Levan in the same year? Let's leave Levan aside for now.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, okay, okay. Vitalii, do you think that this guy knows that you are the next and that is why he is creating some injury stories to just avoid you and enjoy the title more? Vitalii, do you think that this guy is making up some injuries and stories to sit with the belt for a little longer and to avoid you or not? Yes, on purpose. As you know, Artem writes poetry very well. He makes them up.
SPEAKER_00: They also come up with different stories about trauma. You all know that Artyom is a very good writer, so he's writing a very good history about injuries too. Okay, but does Vitalii think that sooner or later Artyom is going to face the reality?
SPEAKER_01: Artyom is going to what? Face the reality. He said he was trying to run away for a very long time. Too long.
SPEAKER_02: Tell Artyom not to get upset. As a promoter, it is my job to steer the pot. Artyom says, don't be offended. I say, I'm provoking you on purpose. I'm a promoter. I need you to, you know... No, I'm not offended. It's okay. I myself want to fight Vitalii on the left. But I don't want to approach this fight with any problems. I think Vitalii himself won't be interested if I'm in a vulnerable state. Right?
SPEAKER_02: It would be interesting for Vitalii to fight Alizhan for now. I'll rest for now. Artem, I'll tell you this. Let's fight. And then I'll wait for you at the top when you fight with Kamil. If you win, we'll make a rematch. I'll win Kamil in touch, bro.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, so Artyom is saying, you know what, I want to pull Vitalii very much too, but I believe that I have to be very serious and in very good shape for this match. And he said, I don't think Vitalii will like to pull me if I have any issues either, because it's not going to be, you know, interesting. And Artyom is saying, you know, Vitalii can pull Alizhan. In the meantime, I will rest a little bit and I'll get ready. And then Vitalii said, you know what, I will wait for you on very top.
SPEAKER_00: And then you can pull Camille and stuff, you know, to get up to me. And Artem answer, you know, what I will just flash pin Camille. Easy. Don't worry, brother. He's going to flash pin who? Camille. Oh, this is what Artem said? Yes. Okay. We will see. We will see. We will see. But I just want Artem seriously to be healthy. You know, we don't want him to push himself.
SPEAKER_01: and we have just really chronic injury we don't we don't want that here and so let's let's okay there is a super chat from a guy i can read his name my friend um i don't know which one
SPEAKER_00: would be harder for Ali Can, but as you just now listen, Artem can't pull left arm for probably next five, six months, you know, in my opinion. That's what I understand. But any match is possible. Yeah. Let's talk about the card and then finish the matches that we will have. One second.
SPEAKER_00: I am now, yep, right here. Okay, let's start. Artem Taranenko, Thomas Rozet. Do you guys know Thomas from Latvia? He gave some travel to Oleg Zok with left arm. This match, Artem Taranenko, Thomas is right arm. Thomas won the European Championships with right arm.
SPEAKER_00: And with left arm, he won against Oleg Dzhog one time, and then he lost two times. But he's not bad, you know. And he's going to pull against Artem Taranenko. Artem Taranenko will fight with Tom from Latvia, but they will fight on their right hands. Yeah, sorry, this match is going to be left arm. Left arm or right? Yeah, left arm, yeah. They will fight on their left hand.
SPEAKER_02: Tom won against Zhoha once, then lost once, but you know Artem Taranenko. Well, I'll answer first, if you don't mind, Vitalii. I don't think... I haven't seen Taranenko fight with the left, actually. I've seen him fight with the right, normally. I don't remember the left matches, for some reason. A little better. Because Taranenko fights with the top,
SPEAKER_02: Yes, he's still signed with us. Top Roll King, right? And I know that Tom has very good fingers and his wrist closes very well. Therefore, here, well, 60 to 40 in favor of Rozits.
SPEAKER_01: 642 road it's uh because uh taranenko is mostly top roll uh and uh thumbs uh have a very good fingers and he can close him very well so 642 thumbs and and vitally knows that this is nice
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, Vitalii is saying that he cannot comment or predict because he doesn't really know Thames, he knows Artyom. But because he knows Artyom, he won't cheer for him. Okay.
SPEAKER_02: And Carolina Pettersson, Olga Terpelova. Olga Terpelova and Carolina Pettersson, guys. Do they know Atlas? I think they know. Do you know the girls? Yes, I know Olga Terpelova. She fought on Siberian Bear. I was there and saw her. She is a very good, strong girl who gives hope. I think the victory will be hers.
SPEAKER_01: Vitalii is saying that Terpelova most likely. He saw her in the Siberian tournament and she is very powerful, very good. First growing athlete. So he thinks that she's going to win. And you, Artem? I will root for Olga, of course. But Carolina is so dangerous, very dangerous, very strong.
SPEAKER_01: Artyom is saying that he's going to cheer for Olga and he hopes that she's going to win, but Carolina is a very, very strong athlete, so he would give it 50-50. Okay, so Adam Vorzinsky versus Vladimir Maiorov.
SPEAKER_00: Vladimir Morzinski is the athlete that beat Bozhidar Simeonov and he beat Artur Makarov, but he lost to Bacho. And he's going to pull against Vladimir Maiorov now. 85 kilos. Artur thinks that Maiorov is going to win. He has a very, very good hook.
SPEAKER_00: Do you know Vitalii, guys? Yes, I also think he's a major. Yes, Vitalii thinks he's a major too. Major, OK. And now I set a match. Zurab Tavberidze versus Petro Marharint. Petro Marharint with the right hand. What hand? The right one. Zurab, after the injury, will it be difficult for him to get out now?
SPEAKER_02: I hope he will recover. If he will be in the same shape as he was in the first tournament he won, I think he will be great.
SPEAKER_01: Vitalii said that he hopes that Zurab is fully recovered and if he will be able to bring the form when he saw him at the ANC tournament, which he won, then he thinks Zurab, but it's a question if he is fully recovered and, you know, first start after the injury. And you, Artem?
SPEAKER_02: I think so, too. I completely agree with Vitalii. If he's in good form, like at AMC, then he'll win. There will be a fight in the hook, and Zurab can even wait to hold out. Artyom is thinking the same, approximately the same way, if he will bring the good form as he saw at AMC. And he said even on endurance he may win. OK. Chance show. Ibragim Sagov.
SPEAKER_00: Ibragim. 100% Ibragim. Guys think that Ibragim is in very good shape right now. That's interesting. Dimitrina Petro, Ayane Takenaka. Dimitrina Petro is a 60kg world champion. Ayane is a 55kg world champion.
SPEAKER_01: These two champions are in the 55th category, and the second one is in the 60th. Do you know these girls? I think you're right. I was in Bulgaria when I saw how well she trains. I myself watched her training process. I think she will win. Vitalii thinks that Dimitrina Petro will win. He knows her. He saw her training process in Bulgaria. And she's very stable, and he thinks that she's going to win.
SPEAKER_02: Artem? I think Dimitrina will win, because she's heavier, and I think she's taller. Her handles are longer than Takenaka's. Am I right? I think Dimitrina will win.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, he thinks the same, approximately the same way that Dimitrina gonna win because she's a little bit taller and she's a little bit heavier and her livers are a little bit longer. And so if you're enough advantage. I think they both will be 60 kilo. I don't think there will be any weight difference. And Artem Taino, Betkili Oniani. Can you ask Artem?
SPEAKER_02: Morozov, if he was surprised to see Betkely beating Aktaev like this? Yes, for me it was a surprise that Betkely so confidently beat Tolgatov. Of course, we were all shocked when we watched it. And here, now, when he will fight Kostadinov, it's hard to say anything.
SPEAKER_02: If Bidkili scored more from that fight with Tolgatov, then he has all the chances. Well, it's difficult 50-50, but it's as if you're more inclined to the victory of Artem Taynov.
SPEAKER_01: he's saying yeah it was a huge surprise uh that he won you know that easily yes relatively easy and he said yeah if uh bitkillies keep progressing uh then it's very very close 50 50 chances uh with artyom but he want to think that artyom have a little better chance still okay and basically
SPEAKER_02: Artem, as far as I know, fought very well in the last tournament at the IMC, but you don't need to watch it either, because there was a very heavy net, there were very strong athletes, but I saw how he fought in December at the IMC, Artem, it was something, and how he fought at the E2S, too, very chic, I think he will now work on the mistakes and the victory will be for him, I bow to him.
SPEAKER_01: uh yeah without commenting that uh yes he saw his uh pulling uh december amc and now amc and he said that yeah there was some mistakes and uh you know the whole mesh was really really good and tough but archon will work under on his mistakes and he gonna pull them in this time
SPEAKER_00: okay okay and daniel prokopchuk bojidar simeno left arm world title 77 kilo prokopchuk left arm left arm uh lava but just tell them that last year in saudi arabia uh bojidar beat daniel with left arm
SPEAKER_02: I think Bojadar will win this time as well. Daniel's left hand isn't as good as his right. I think Bojadar is rested now. I'm sure he trained well and will win.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, Arkham thinks that Bozhidar will win left arm because Daniel's left arm is not as good as his right arm. No, it's not true. Like, Daniel just won his first world title right arm only last year, while he has been winning WAP Worlds since 2017 with left arm. He won, like, I think four or five times left arm WAP Worlds, only one time with right arm.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know, maybe close, but we will see. What did he say more? Sorry, he said that Bozhidar is going to win?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, Bozhidar is going to win because he's well-rested and Bozhidar will win pretty convincingly. And what does Vitalii think? Vitalii, what do you think? Prokofchuk has been training very hard lately. I think if he trains his right hand well, he will train his left hand too. Evgeny if he doesn't train his left hand, he still trains it. I think his left hand is no worse than his right hand. So I think he will win.
SPEAKER_01: Okay. Yeah, Vitalii thinks opposite. Vitalii thinks that Daniel training his left and right arms pretty equally. And he thinks that Daniel will win left arm match. Okay. And Travis Bajan versus Sergei Kalinichenko. Kalinichenko and Travis Bajan. Oh, it's going to be very noisy here.
SPEAKER_01: I think so. From Travis' side and very strongly from Kalinichenko's side. So I think Kalinichenko will win, but they will fight for about an hour. I think so. Artem said that it's going to be pretty noisy from Travis' side and it's going to be pretty strong from Kalinichenko's side. And he said that he believes that Kalinichenko will win, but the whole supermatch will be approximately an hour long.
SPEAKER_02: About what? Long? About one hour long. Oh, because of the complain and everything? Oh, okay. And Vitalii?
SPEAKER_01: Okay, yeah, Vitalii thinks that Sergey Kalinichenko is progressing very well and he's constantly training lately and he's going up very fast. And he said that he saw Travis on some videos and he doesn't look like he's, you know, in a top shape yet. And he said, I don't believe that he can gain this top shape within such a short period of time. But he said that he will pull some nerves there definitely.
SPEAKER_02: okay okay and let's go to the barbara bachiova edley barbara okay italy italy thinks that edla will just flash me that she's in a very good shape okay he's gonna beat barbara
SPEAKER_02: Wow. And you, Artem? I still think that Barbora will win, because in recent times when Daigle has fought with someone so many times, she has not fought very well. She seems to have become smaller. And, of course, her strength is also smaller. And Barbora is just... I don't know who to compare her to.
SPEAKER_01: Artyom thinks that Barbora is going to win because he was watching Egle lately.
SPEAKER_01: and uh he thinks that she is uh going down a little bit she's like gets kind of smaller and not as strong as she used to be uh but uh she said i don't know who you we can you know compare barbara to from the man's side and vitality said maybe we can compare her to morozov and she's like no no not tomorrow's maybe to dimitri's life uh okay
SPEAKER_01: Okay, and let's see, we will see. And Todd Hutchings, Krasimir Kostadinov. What's on here? Yeah, Artyom's saying that grandpa is still surprising us, so he thinks that Todd Hutchings is going to win.
SPEAKER_02: Although I'm friends with Krasimir, it's been so long since we've been friends, right? After we fought. And before that, we were friends and always fought in the same category. Okay, it's not that important. I'll put it this way, because things haven't been important with Krasimir lately. But with Todd, it's very good.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, Vitalii probably thinks the same way. He said that he knows Krazy very well. They're friends. But lately, Krazy is not doing so well. And opposite to Hutchings, Hutchings is doing very well. Okay, Evgeny Prudnik versus Irakli Zirakashvili. Actually, I think Evgeny Prudnik
SPEAKER_01: Artyom thinks that Evgeny Prudnik has more tools and with the use of those more options, he's going to tie on Irakli and he's going to win.
SPEAKER_02: And Vitalii? I fought Prudnik in 2019, and I know how good he is at spinning. If he spins, everything is very tough for him. I don't think Irakli has enough strength to spread his hand.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, Vitalii, approximately the same opinion. He said that he'd been pulling Prudnik many times and he knows his ability of, you know, hooking and twisting. And he said that, yeah, if...
SPEAKER_01: Prudnik will hook. It's very, very hard to unhook it. And he believes that Irakli doesn't have enough to open up his wrist. Yeah, but do they remember when last time somebody hooked Irakli in his category? David. David was not like this.
SPEAKER_02: i cooked that yeah it didn't like really like go supination but he was just like yeah anyways
SPEAKER_02: Vitalii said he saw both athletes and both of them are in great shape, amazing, and he said, listen, unpredictable, 50-50. And Artyom?
SPEAKER_02: And he will be able to perform on the same hand in a month. It will be difficult to maintain good form for such a long time. If he, of course, can do it, will not make mistakes in preparation, then 50-50. If not, then David, it seems to me, is faster. He can fight differently on the right.
SPEAKER_01: okay artyom saying that uh uh it's uh it's a little bit uh complicated for petrenko right now because he just have a match uh and uh the next match is in the months if he will be able to you know recover and uh no he said he said he's totally fine you know
SPEAKER_01: and he said to keep the you know peak form for such a long time it's complicated and david is very fresh on the right arm so but he said if petrenko will be able you know to train properly and keep that same shape for a month then it's 50 if not if something will goes a little south then david maybe have a little edge on it okay and now
SPEAKER_02: David Samushia and Sasho Andreev. Samushia and Sasho. 85 kg. It will be a very interesting fight. 85 kg. Samushia is very resilient and Sasho is also resilient. I think there will be a beautiful fight. It will all depend on who is more resilient.
SPEAKER_02: Yes, I agree with Vitalii. And we know that Sasho has an injury on his right hand, which the last fights he had did not let him fight like before, as he used to hold the corner well. If Samushia will attack him, then there
SPEAKER_01: Artyom and Vitalii have approximately the same opinion. It's going to be an endurance match. It's a very close match, very interesting, about 50-50. But Artyom added a comment that Sasho has some...
SPEAKER_01: and some problems right now with his arm. And he said that if Samushia will be attacking properly, then Sasho will have problems. But if they're going to stack somewhere in the middle of the table, it's going to be an endurance war and it's going to be very interesting. I'm not aware of Sasho's injury. He just dominated European Championships. Yeah, I don't... Artyom, he doesn't know about Sasho's injury.
SPEAKER_02: What did you hear there? No, I didn't hear it. I mean, he's been talking about it for a long time. I mean, it's an old injury for him. Now, of course, maybe he didn't have any serious rivals in Europe, but Samushia is a little different.
SPEAKER_01: Artyom is saying that it's an old injury he's been talking about for years and he said on the europe championship maybe he did not have anybody you know on the level of samusha samusha is a different animal so uh that's what he yeah yeah i think three years ago he had a pack injury but it was three years ago but yeah and this one the last one i want to ask them score and how the each round will go
SPEAKER_01: I want to start with Vitalii. The match is Vitalii Laletin vs. Artem Morozov. It will be 3-0, it will be very fast. I would also like to ask if people will be surprised if I let Artem go into the hook and turn him up from the hook.
SPEAKER_01: Vitalii is saying that it's going to be very fast. It's going to be 3-0. And he wants to ask a question. Is he going to surprise people if he will let Artyom to hook him and he can open up from the hook? Is he going to do it in which round? In which round? In the fourth round. Fourth round.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, after the match finished. Okay, okay. And Artem, what is your prediction about each round? Of course, I will do everything to win it 3-0, but I think the score could be either 3-1 or 3-2 in my favor. But I will try to make it 3-0. I think it won't be easy for anyone. Yes, I think so too.
SPEAKER_01: i'm saying that i will try to do a 3-0 uh but in his opinion it's going to be 3-1 or even 3-2 but he doesn't think it's going to be uh vitality commented that he doesn't think that it's going to be easy for each of us and i come agreed he's saying yeah it's not going to be easy for sure and then okay our terms it's not going to be easy and let's didn't say anything either but it's not going to be easy yes let's also said this
SPEAKER_00: He just said that it's going to be 3-0 easy every round. Flashpin? No, he did not say easy. He said fast. You said flashpin? What's flashpin? How hard can it be flashpin? Come on, you guys are really messing my perception, you know? Flashpin, but not easy. He says, what kind of confusion are you making in my head? He says, you just said that 3-0 would be fast, and now you say that it won't be easy. He says, how is that? It will be hard, but fast.
SPEAKER_01: he said without saying it's going to be very hard but very fast okay it's gonna be very hard and very fast yes okay okay and then artem can he really hook you and then toproll you from there artem you think that in nature he can turn you into a hook and then turn you out of the hook back there will be you know how i'll twist it yes
SPEAKER_01: He will try to open it. I won't let him do it. I will open it myself. One last question. Artem, is it more possible to hook?
SPEAKER_01: Vitalii or top roll him? Honestly. Flop. Flop is the easiest one. But he said I'm gonna do it. It's because he wants to give some chance to Vitalii, right?
SPEAKER_00: yes yes yeah okay okay and let's a little bit talk about uh leon saginashvili uh do you guys believe there is anyone on the earth right now that can beat him
SPEAKER_02: Let's talk a little bit about Levan Saginashvili. How do you guys think, is there anyone on the planet today who is close to defeating him? Well, I think that it is not possible today, but again, he has not tried to fight with everyone. For example, such athletes as Artem Morozov, he can hook well, and we have not seen Levan fight with a hook.
SPEAKER_02: All athletes are different, they all fight in different ways. But again, if someone can't win, it's all temporary. Or take Georgy Kadyranova. Yes, that is, Olga can also twist so much that it seems to him little.
SPEAKER_01: yeah uh guys are talking about uh they don't think that uh it's you know anybody can win him really right now but they have a similar opinion about that levan did not pull everybody on this planet right styles make matches vitaly is saying simple example example archer morrison if he will be able to hook him who knows we didn't see how signature is you know arm wrestling in a hook
SPEAKER_01: And Artyom commented the same second, Dzharanov. He can hook up, it's not going to be, you know, it's maybe enough. So who knows? Does Artyom Morozov think that Dzharanov has the strongest hook in the world? Do you think that Dzharanov has the strongest hook in the world?
SPEAKER_02: He said that maybe he's not the strongest in a bicep move or a side move, but he's super uncomfortable. Okay, who could beat him in hook?
SPEAKER_00: I don't know. I'm not going to pull him. Okay, but they talk about Levan's hook, right? Yes.
SPEAKER_00: He said that Laletin said that if Morozov hooks Levan, he can beat him, right? He said we don't know. I have seen Levan beating Gennady inside. And Laletin gives 50-50 chance to himself against Morozov. So then it means that Vitalii also has a better chance against Levan in hook since he is 50-50 with Morozov.
SPEAKER_01: He says, I saw how Levan beat Kvikvinia in hooks. Then Vitalii says, 50 to 50 chances for your fight in hooks. So it turns out that Vitalii has the same exact chances against Levan as Morozov in hooks, right? Vitalii has more chances in the top against Levan. Yeah, Artem is saying that Vitalii has better chance top roll against Levan.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah. No, no, what I'm just saying, he was talking about Morozov probably could beat Levan or something. So if Morozov can, Vitalii also can because he has 50-50 chance. That's what I meant to say, yeah. Okay, we will see. We will see very soon. Gennady is also coming back. And I want to ask this and then I want to finish. Vitalii, like we have an official top 10, but everyone...
SPEAKER_00: our ranking is made by the results. But we also have some opinions, you know, if this match happens, this would happen, but it didn't happen. So according to your own judgment, what is the world ranking right now should be? In your opinion, not that should be, but what is like, who can beat who? Like, who can you beat? And things like that. In top 10, right?
SPEAKER_00: Engin, top 10? Yeah, top 10 in the right arm, you know, as much as he wants to say. Like from number one and then who is number two in his opinion.
SPEAKER_01: Vitalii, look, there is an official ranking table, but it is based only on results. But each of us has something in his head, and we don't always agree with this table, right? Who is in which place. Could you, according to your feelings or your thoughts, name the first ten, approximately, as you think? Well, I think that, respectively, Lebanon
SPEAKER_02: If we take Devon, yes, but he has now left the lower category. Accordingly, Georgy Tsvetkov. This is the right hand, right? Yes, it is. Yes, here is Levan, Hermes Gasparini, Georgy Tsvetkov, Alice Kurdesha, Artem Morozov. Accordingly, Georgy Dziranov.
SPEAKER_00: But are these in order? Because he counted Swetko before Kurdesha, and Kurdesha just with Swetko. Artem these in order, or he's just saying... That's what he's giving in approximate order, I understand. I will ask him. Let me ask him. Vitalii, do you say it in order, or do you just... No, you just say it in order. No, Vitalii, no particular order, it's just up to them. Yeah, but can he do that particular order? Because we all know all those names.
SPEAKER_01: We just want to know where does he think everywhere is exactly ranked, you know. Let me interrupt you then. He asks, let's put places for everyone. I'll tell you what you called to say, and you tell me where to put it, okay? Lebanon, as far as I can see at the moment, I think Lebanon, for example, Kurdesha. Kurdesha the second?
SPEAKER_02: Ask him where is Laletin.
SPEAKER_00: Where is Laletin? Laletin is already waiting for the final. Laletin in the finals waiting for everybody. Oh, okay. Well, to rank is Laletin, then Levon, and then... Then everybody else. Okay, okay, okay. That's good.
SPEAKER_01: so so we got uh we used to have devon but uh we did not rank devon because he's kind of out so levan first ermes second uh kurdesha third uh tsvitkov number four because he won with morozov morozov five the run of six okay okay and and can you ask him like can he say also in order the toughest opponents for him like against who
SPEAKER_01: he would be underdog. And against who, he would have the equal chance, and against who, he would be favorite. Okay, well, it's about the same thing. They ask you, too, in order of numbers, who would be the most difficult opponents for you, where you are underdog, that is, where you are not a favorite. Then with whom of these guys do you think there would be, let's say, 50-50, and maybe someone you are confident in winning.
SPEAKER_02: So far, I think it would be difficult for me to fight with Krudechev. It would be difficult. It would be difficult to fight with Fedkova. With Morozov, it's easy. Definitely. I don't know about Georgy Dziranov, but so far it seems to me that I would unwind him. At the moment. I'm not going to fight with him.
SPEAKER_01: uh okay so vital is saying that very uncomfortable is uh uh super Morozov 100 percent uh super easy Morozov is super easy super easy Morozov yeah and then he said Zeranov is uh an opponent yes but uh as of right now he believes that it's uh he gonna win relatively not easy but uh convincingly
SPEAKER_00: Okay, is it because Kurdesha is so tall and he pulls high knuckle while the Laletin is like this because of the style he thinks that it will be very hard for him because he is very tall and then he keeps his riser up while, you know, Vitalii likes the low hand top row. Is it because of the size and the style and the hand strength of the Kurdesha?
SPEAKER_01: I think that the kurdecha for you will be difficult due to the stylistics, due to the fact that the sizes are practically the same or close, and due to the fact that you have... I have a question, I just turned off by accident, something happened to the connection.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, the question is, do you think that it will be so difficult with Kurdech because of the size? Does it correspond to the fact that he has such long levers and that your wrist is a little broken, but he still holds the lead up with knuckles so high? Or are there any other reasons? Well, the reason is not in this, the reason is that he is a heavy hitter, a very strong wrist. And with ease, in principle, he won Tsitkov.
SPEAKER_02: But my wrist is broken not because I broke it, but because the judges put it that way. I fought with Rivas, you all saw it, right? In the first fight, Christa put me out so that my wrist was at the bottom, Rivas was at the top, I couldn't even do anything. In the second fight, the shot was normal, I won it with ease. Yes, translate it. Yes, translate it.
SPEAKER_01: uh yeah and get dance whereas uh no not only because but because of uh kurdecha's power and how his top pro very good top roller and his uh power in his wrist because he said as the position of the hand is not necessarily because i want it like that but sometimes it's because the referees will put it in that uh because it's so tall
SPEAKER_01: Yes, and he said with Rivas, everybody saw when referees was very high, Rivas won. And then when we adjust the grip, then, you know, it goes other direction, so. My problem is that when I'm standing in a Sudet capture, and if I raise my first finger, I close the phalanx to the opponent, so they let me down, my hand is lowered.
SPEAKER_01: Vitalii is saying that because of the liver length, when it's a referee grip, if the referee will put my wrist up, then I will cover the knuckle of my opponent. So he's always dumping my wrist to show up. Okay, I want to ask something very quickly and I want a quick answer. Does he believe that if he pulls Hermes again, the outcome would be different next time?
SPEAKER_01: If you fight Hermes again, will the result be different? Yes, I'm in better shape than I was. I think Alex will get him big problems.
SPEAKER_00: he said that he thinks that alex will make huge problems for rms so he would bet on him yes okay let's go to the artium artium what's your top 10. oh
SPEAKER_00: Where do you think this Aronov is? Do you think this Aronov has a chance against Hermes, Kurdecha, and Svetkov? I think there is a chance, but we need to see. I think there is a chance, but we need to see. Okay, okay.
SPEAKER_01: I don't put myself in this rank because I'm not from this planet. People ask why you don't include Jerry.
SPEAKER_00: But we don't include Jablonski either, you see. Artem is saying, yeah, we're not, but we're not including Jablonski too. Yeah, but Jablonski with right arm is not in top 10 yet. He's, you know, Jablonski with right arm not same as left arm so far. He may be better in the future, but not anymore, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: um yeah not anymore not yet i should say okay and that's i promise this time the last question how about the left-arm ranking and we finish leo ranking morozov matushenko
SPEAKER_00: Vitalii thinks that Kurdesha will win, but it's going to be the same amount of problems as Laletin have.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, okay. Okay. Okay. So what's the top ten? He said the first Morozov. What did you guys laugh about? Yeah, Laletin, Morozov, Matyushenko, Jablonski. And then Artyom is asking, where is Kurdecha? He said Kurdecha in the right-hand rankings. That's it. Okay. Okay. Okay. So, okay, where is Laletin? He doesn't rank himself? He said he's number one? Laletin said this? Yes. And then he said next is Morozov? Yes.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, he thinks that Morozov beat the other guys, like you say, Alijan. Yeah, yeah, but he is also pulling supers too. He beat Kody Merritt, he beat Hermes, and he will pull more heavyweights.
SPEAKER_01: He's joking, but let me ask you, Vitalii, seriously, do you think Olezhan is in the top ten in the left hand? No, no, I just thought that the conversation was about the top three. Well, you see, he's fighting in the top three. Engin says he's beaten him. No, but Olezhan, I think, in any case, will be in the top three. In the top three? Yes. He thinks that Olezhan may be top three, if serious. And top three is, one is Laletin, second is Morozov?
SPEAKER_00: uh and then matushenko after you then yes oh okay okay he's saying that they're gonna move him a little bit okay yeah in in matushenko and uh alijan needs to pull for 115 kilo world title and and artem what is your opinion about top five just say
SPEAKER_02: Top five, yes? Yeah. My dad, me, Alizhan, Kurdecha, and Vitalii. He said, my father, my father. My father and second is who? Him, Artem. Oh, okay. His father, Artem.
SPEAKER_00: Alijan, Kurdecha and Vitalii. Vitalii is number 5. Morozov really believes that Alijan can beat Vitalii with left arm? To be honest, I was thinking at first where to put him. But...
SPEAKER_02: Vitalii is saying that I will forgive you, Artyom, but Jablonski will never forgive you this. What's that? It's untranslatable shit, I'm sorry.
SPEAKER_00: I'm dancing, okay. Okay, Mapozyan says, great podcast, great trash talk. Thank you, guys. Can't wait to see you guys pulling. And when Levan comes back with left arm, is he going to be the most dangerous? Who are you asking, Vitalii or Artyom or both? It doesn't matter. Guys, when Levan comes back with his left arm, do you think he will be the most dangerous opponent? I think he is.
SPEAKER_02: I think that when he comes back, let him go through the same path as us, for example, with Vitalii. The same path that Alizhan went through. To fight with everyone. Well, let's see in what integrity his left hand reaches the final. And then we'll see if he's dangerous or not. Well, it's just logical. Vitalii, what did you say? I'm sorry, I didn't hear it. I said that...
SPEAKER_02: I don't think he will be dangerous from the beginning, because he didn't fight for a long time. I think he needs to go through Yablonsky first, and then contact us. First, he needs to go through. Because Yablonsky said that I think Vitalii is the strongest on the left hand, and I will start with him. Then there will be Morozov, and then there will be Levan.
SPEAKER_01: okay uh yeah vitaly thinks that uh he will not be as dangerous as uh as you think uh because he's just coming back and he said that uh he will need to pass through yablonski first and then everybody else because yablonski says that vitaly is the strongest one then morozov and you know that yablonski and uh artem says that you know it's gonna be probably proper way of doing it if uh
SPEAKER_01: If Levan will start from a little bit lower ranking, then he will pass all the way to the top, and then we will see in what condition his left arm will be when he gonna reach the final level. So they will think that if Levan just comes and directly does the title match, they will think it's an unfair one? Do you think that if Levan comes back and immediately puts him on the title match, he will fail?
SPEAKER_01: Well, no. Then why did they put Vitalii right away on the title match, for example, Yatko? Well, that's true.
SPEAKER_00: He said maybe Vitalii and Levan right away. Vitalii and Levan. Look at how Vitalii is looking. Vitalii, do you think that Morozov is afraid? Oh, listen. Does he mean, Artem means that put Vitalii and Levan in because Levan is coming next year. He means that Vitalii will be number one? That's why he wants me to say that much?
SPEAKER_01: Do you mean that next year Vitalii will be number one with his left hand? Why do you want to put Vitalii with Levan right away? No, Engin says that I had an injury. Look at Vitalii. Engin says correctly that I had an injury with my left hand.
SPEAKER_02: And when Vitalii came, it was logical for him to fight Tobias, Yeblon, Matyushenko, for example. If I came and Vitalii was number one, it would be logical that I would have to go through the same path as he did to get to him, to the boss, for example.
SPEAKER_02: And if Levan comes now, he also needs to go through a certain path to get to the boss. We are going to Levan gradually, that is, we do not jump there after a few goals, right? On the right hand.
SPEAKER_01: Artyom is saying that it's logical if Levan will come back that he will have to pass, you know, some way to get to the top. He said, listen, we are going to Levan on the right-hand side, he meant, and we are passing some steps to get to him, right? That is logical if I'm at the number one. Vitalii is going his way and going through some of the super matches to get to the final boss, and that would be logical if Levan is making comeback on the left.
SPEAKER_01: he will have to make some steps to get to the top. So does Morozov say that if I set him a match against Levan, he would reject? Morozov, I have a question for you. If Engin makes a match against you and Levan, will you refuse? When? When?
SPEAKER_00: No, no. If he comes, if he comes, if he comes, what I'm just saying that like Levan is not a regular guy. Around like five years or four years, he went like with left arm undefeated. There has been times, as far as I remember, that he lost with right arm, but I think his last loss was like 2015 or something, Europeans. And then wars, 2015, 16, 17, 18.
SPEAKER_00: I think four years in a row, he won the WAP Wars with left arm. And also he won the Zloty Tour. I think he beat Laletin there. And like, does he not think that, you know, like, you know, Ongar Bey was away from Marmara since 2019. He came and he did the title match. Jerry was away from 2019. He came, did the title match against Gennady. Does he not think that like Levan is that type of guy that is just coming back, you know?
SPEAKER_01: Well, he says that, listen, Levan is an unusual guy. I understand, I understand. He won many years, was undefeated, then he just left. He says, if I remember correctly, he won Zloty with his left hand and Vitalii won. He says, if I make such a match, never, but in principle, if Levan returns, will you refuse? Well, then no.
SPEAKER_00: Artem is saying no, he will not. Okay, I understand. But he thinks that Vitalii definitely deserves the title match. Yeah, only thing that Artem needs to say is that he is ready, his elbow is ready and then we can set it, you know, whenever he's ready.
SPEAKER_00: Guys, I really, really need to go out. Okay, let's finish it. Thank you very much, Artem. Thank you so much. Thank you, Vitalii. And thank you, Paolo, for the translation. Tell these guys that I love these guys. And we are just still in the pod. There is nothing about this. I have huge respect for them.
SPEAKER_01: Thank you, guys. Thank you. Thank you, Paolo.
