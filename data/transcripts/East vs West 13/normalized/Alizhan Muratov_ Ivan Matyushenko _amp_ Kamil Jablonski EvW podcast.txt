SPEAKER_04: Hello, everyone.
SPEAKER_01: very soon my guests will be coming and
SPEAKER_01: Let me share this on social media so people can join us, and then very soon,
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, in five minutes they will be joining us. Or nine minutes.
SPEAKER_01: you'll mostly talk about naturally left arm arm wrestling okay a lot of people already here just checking the
SPEAKER_01: Comment section. Hello, hello everyone. And I don't know if Levan is back on the, in the gym, but for sure.
SPEAKER_01: We will be pulling end of this year, end of this year.
SPEAKER_01: Alicent Muradov, Ivan Matushenko, and Kamil Jablonski. Yeah, end of this year, Levan will be putting right arm, and he said he's also planning to pull left arm next year. Thank you, 1.4GH as Mac.
SPEAKER_01: training anyone but I'm the technical director of the Turkish national team but 90% of the trainers in my country they get their certificate after the course I gave to them you know yeah fans want Ali Can vs Levan and many others but
SPEAKER_01: It is not possible to set all the matches in the same event. That is why, event by event, we are serving you guys the best of arm wrestling in our capabilities. My shape, Irfan Ramzan, today I did my first training, finally.
SPEAKER_01: after three months but it was very light and I did just some 20 kilo bench press and 15 kilo each side cable cross 30 kilo we call butterfly and some very light tricep my intention is not to train but just make sure that I do some very light warm-up and I did some risers also very light so basically I did train
SPEAKER_01: like 20% of my best, something like that, yeah. Yeah, there are so many great matches, so many great matches. Just today, I said, another match.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, everything will happen, guys. Everything will happen. Just I know, like, if I now try to organize everything the fans suggest, I need to make a card with like 150 Supermatches. So that is why if I do big cards, many complaints, too long. If I do small athletes complain, why you don't invite me? I mean, I try to explain my goals. Whenever I organize more matches, just remember,
SPEAKER_01: a lot of money, but that is not my concern. My concern is to give matches as much as possible to the athletes who are waiting to be invited. And it's not possible to invite everyone either. And like a lot of things I'm considering, like am I going to cover the events, you know, like the how to do, like I'm trying to
SPEAKER_01: create a league you know league international league so you cannot do that with organizing five six matches so that is why even king of the table used to do three matches now they increased to seven matches and they are doing incredible job the next card is incredible and so all together we are trying to organize as
SPEAKER_01: Evgeny with Devin being part of the event, not the same. It depends on who Devin is playing against, you know. It is like, it can be much different, you know. It is, it can make three times difference, you know. Like, it is all about who he's playing against, you know.
SPEAKER_01: No, just paint it, change the room. No, Prudnik is pulling right now, Irakli Zirakashvili.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, that match is going to happen for sure. Yeah. I don't think Ali Cenk can have four belts on left arm. He cannot make 95 kilo. He's not planning to go below 105 category. Today, okay, the guy should be coming. I think somebody already came.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, Matyushenko. Ivan just came. Hello, hello, Ivan. You don't look super clear. Maybe you clean your camera or something or... There's some problem with my... Camera? Yes.
SPEAKER_00: okay okay we see you i think it's protective um how to say uh protection yes protection perhaps i need to rub it i'm not sure i mean i see you i see you it's not super clear but i see you no problem yeah how are you good thank you what is the weight
SPEAKER_01: So competition is coming. Can you believe that you're going for the second belt? And I know it's not easy, but even to have that opportunity is incredible, my opinion. That's why I agreed. And also want to say hello. Hey, guys. Hey, Carmen, is it possible to turn the side way? I'm done.
SPEAKER_01: no you you didn't change the um yeah no i mean i have this phone sideways now yeah but it's not about phones that way you need to also change the um
SPEAKER_01: maybe i have old phone yeah but there needs to be there needs to be a lock you need to unlock that so whenever you turn sideways then you will now yeah now better still no okay give me a second i'll try work it out yeah so how is everything
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, everything good. Oh, that's not this one. Yeah. Maybe I have a lock on my phone, I don't know. So, how is everything, everyone? How is, how is, how is America? You enjoying with your family?

SPEAKER_01: Just turn the camera sideways. Turn the camera to the side.
SPEAKER_02: You are fine now. You hear us coming? Yes, I can hear, but I think I fixed my camera or not yet. Yeah, yeah, yeah, you did, you did. Everything is great, yeah. Okay, that's great. I pressed too many buttons and I'm a little bit stressed because my wife is driving in New York from the last two minutes. Oh, come on. Hello, hello, hello. I'm listening.
SPEAKER_02: And we still didn't get to the place, so I'll be talking like that. Hopefully she doesn't hear me. I'm joking, I'm just joking. So, how is everything? I heard that Don Idris accepted your match against Vitalii. Yes, I heard that as well. I'm so excited.
SPEAKER_02: you know people saying that he will smash me but i am not sure about that i think i've got a chance to to to win him uh last night i was watching his matches and i think the way he fight i should be able to stop his uh his hit yeah so yeah so i think uh i'll be all right maybe we'll see
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, Kami, if we watch you like this, I think we all will start throwing up because you are moving way too much. Okay, we have only 10 minutes to destination. Okay, okay. How about you just now get out and then join us 10 minutes later? I can do like that. Yeah, let's get to the destination.
SPEAKER_01: We have only two kilometres, but it's traffic. So, OK, I'll just... OK, OK. See you soon, yeah. Ivan, is it OK that you would translate for... Sure. I am here for that reason. No, you are not there for that reason. You are here as Ivan Matushenko, who is going for the... The title. The world title, yeah. Let me try to set a match in front of you, guys.
SPEAKER_01: Hello Yanis. How are you my friend? Right now I am live on YouTube and I called you before the podcast, but right now I'm live on the podcast with Ali Can, Kamil Yablonski and soon, sorry, with Ivan Matushenko, Ali Can and Kamil will soon join us. Would you, are you going to compete the WAF this year?
SPEAKER_01: Okay, yeah, I was gonna ask you I was gonna ask you in Florida event. Would you would you pull against Justin Bishop? Yeah, that's great. That's good. Okay, so
SPEAKER_01: Just think about it and then we can talk about the details. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And yeah, have a good podcast. Thank you. Two strong guys. Yeah, it will be a historical match, you know, after 10 years, I think. The first time you guys were in 2014? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, okay. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, 2013 was in the UAL.
SPEAKER_01: Okay. Okay. So just, just keep in touch. We will talk about it. Let me continue the podcast. Thank you very much. Yeah. Yeah. Take care. Bye. Bye. Bye. That's how I set the message. You guys know. Yeah. So Ivan, what is your weight now? Um, 115. You didn't gain, you only gained one kilo.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe 15 and a half, yes. Maybe not more. Yes, I was usually 114 when I came to you. Now I'm a little bigger, but I didn't manage to get much. I don't know. Maybe I cannot be a true heavyweight. No, you cannot, but you are good enough to get that opportunity. You are incredible.
SPEAKER_01: And Alijan, what is your weight? 101-102 kilos. 101-102 kilos. Do you think that it is possible to also try 95 kilos world title? Or no, impossible? Comment. How do you think, 95? Would you be able to fight for the title? Or you don't want to lose weight?
SPEAKER_01: it's possible oh okay people say that you may you may win four world titles but matushenko says no way maybe maybe other titles were not 150 i'm just joking not 115 and not uh super heavyweight what do you think his chance against you
SPEAKER_00: I think he is very good. Actually, I thought, I don't know why, but before Hermes, I thought I had a little more chances to meet him. But after Hermes, I think it will be very difficult. I'm not sure that Hermes is a very good example. Yes, he's very good inside, but he was...
SPEAKER_01: A very, how to say, he looked great against Hermes, I think. Dominant, too dominant. Yeah, but just remember, I don't think Hermes made any plans for inside. And Hermes was trying to top roll it. He was hooked, you know, for a while. So it is different to enter the match with the hook. So that is not exactly the same. He is super strong, but to think that you don't have a chance, it's not realistic.
SPEAKER_00: I do not think that I do not have chances. I think I have chances but also they are rather close to Aliron's. Like 50-50? I think about that, yes.
SPEAKER_00: What do you think about pulling against Matyushenko in the future? What do you think your chance will be? 115 kg?
SPEAKER_03: No, it's a good question. I think I had 115 or not. I don't remember. There is always a chance, of course, but the fight will be in the hands.
SPEAKER_03: Well, as they always say, the table will show, of course. It's hard to make any predictions. But it's clear that we need to strengthen the trick and that's it. I don't think we need to come up with anything else. It's good that we don't have to come up with anything. Yes. Olezhan, things that...
SPEAKER_00: uh he has chances and um uh and then we will pull uh in hook for sure it will be hook for sure so he doesn't need to create anything he just needs to uh train hook and perhaps get better
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's incredible. I love it, I love it. Do you know how I play, Ivan? I play, I feel myself like I enjoy this matchmaking more than a kid enjoys PlayStation. You understand? Yeah, so where are your fighters, right?
SPEAKER_01: I mean, it's incredible because as you know, I'm a knowledgeable guy and I know the arm wrestling for like 35 years. And matchmaking is just incredible for me. I enjoy it so much. Yeah. And Ali Can, what do you think that King of the Table, we are like, you all are great with left arm.
SPEAKER_01: And of course, great with right arm as well, especially Matushenko. Right, left, very close to each other. But Kamil and Ali Can more over left arm dominant guys. And so tonight we will be talking about left arm arm wrestling mostly. But Ali Can, what do you think that King of the Table just said Vitalii Laletin versus Kamil Jablonski for the King of the Table June 1st?
SPEAKER_00: What do you think about the fight between Vitalii and Camila? What do you think about the fight between Vitalii and Camila? What do you think about the fight between Vitalii and Camila?
SPEAKER_03: He also fought Tobias. He fought Tobias recently. He also fought your opponent Cody Merritt. Yes, Cody Merritt. His last fights are surprising. His fight against the top fighters. I think his technique is very uncomfortable.
SPEAKER_03: It's very interesting for him. This fight is very interesting. He followed Kamil's win.
SPEAKER_00: He followed Kamil's fights against Cody, against Tobias, against Lared. He thinks it will be interesting and his style is uncomfortable. But also Laletin is perhaps another level.
SPEAKER_01: So it will be very interesting for him. Do you think that Laletin is another level compared to the other athletes because of his hand and style? Or is it because of the arm strength? I'm asking you. And what's your opinion, Ivan, about this match? About the same. I think that Kamil, his style perhaps is most effective against Vitalii.
SPEAKER_00: But on the other hand, Vitalii, his level is great and perhaps the highest in the game. So I think that Vitalii is the favorite, but still Kamil is very dangerous. Do you remember the sparring?
SPEAKER_01: Vitalii and Dariq Ahmed left arm at the end, you know, he took his hand, but he was having a very hard time to finish. Do you remember the sparring? Yes, but it was sparring. Yeah, I understand. But once he took the hand, it was not so comfortable, you know, for him. Like, it's not like I took the hand, the rest is like this. What I just tried to say that what is scary
SPEAKER_01: about Kamil, if somehow he passes the center this way, then I don't know who can stop him, you know, in a defensive position. His pressure to down, I thought that if somehow even he puts the shoulder like this and then Tobias stop him like this, he would just, you know, at least, you know, hang him. But that just goes like the pressure is so deadly to down, you know. So anyone who is caught on his brachioradialis,
SPEAKER_00: This is a big problem. It doesn't matter if it is Vitalii. The match needs to pass the center to this way to catch Kamil. But do you agree or you think differently? Absolutely agree. The only thing in favor of Vitalii is that he has rather good side pressure and he is also quick. And his side pressure, I think, is better than Tobias'.
SPEAKER_00: So in this case it will be more difficult for Kamil to get to his position. If he gets, for sure he has chances, yes. Do you think his left arm has better side pressure than his right arm? Because with right arm I saw him having problems with... Yes, his left is better.
SPEAKER_00: His left is better. I remember him losing to Dzeranov with left arm, but beating Dzeranov with right arm. You remember that year? Yes, it was maybe 2017. Yes. But it was the time that he was dominating me, right, left, right. Yes, and I think Dzeranov won him with top row, with post and top row. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He went and beat him, yeah. But you talked about side pressure, that is. Yes, now Vitalii is 50 kilograms bigger.
SPEAKER_00: 50 kilograms i think no 40 40 sorry he was uh in 100 i think when he was true oh okay yeah uh and uh right hand vitaly had injuries with shoulder he could not use side pressure after dave i think or so somewhere in that i think before they match maybe yeah
SPEAKER_02: Okay. And Kamil, how do you see your chances? Hi, guys. You hear me, yeah? Yes. Okay, good. Yeah. So it will be like a top of the top matches for me with him. And the most interesting me will be the length of Vitalii's hand.
SPEAKER_02: because he have longer hand than me for sure and how far he will have to set up with the elbow on the pad and i am not sure how much he can pull me back before he will use side pressure and if this will be enough for him to stop my power from center and it's very interesting for me the match as well you know because how do you see how do you see your chances
SPEAKER_02: it depends how much Vitalii have the side pressure because Ivan just say Vitalii have more side pressure than Tobias but if you look them much it was like a year ago almost it was like maybe 9-10 months ago and I'm pretty sure both of these guys are a little bit stronger but I don't think there will be much big difference and I don't know really if
SPEAKER_02: if the side pressure of vitaly is so big so strong uh to stop my sideways press so i think i have a lot of chance but it's it depends how um how i will feel comfortable with this such a high uh i mean long hand you know
SPEAKER_02: This will be a little bit... I already feel the difference with Tobias because I don't put guys like Tobias before and I feel the length of his hand making it a bit difficult for me. And now Vitalii has probably longer hand and I am very interested how this will end up on the setup and with the Vitalii move, you know. When I watch his moves, he's doing like...
SPEAKER_02: know pulling back and if i will let him pull back i will be interesting if he will have enough space to take me on side you know it's it's um i think it will be like with tobias 50 50 you know that much i think i've got chances and i feel pretty good i have no damage after tobias which i have a little bit damage after cody and devon maybe because was too many fights there
SPEAKER_02: So I've got like six weeks pain in the fingers, but now I have no pain and I have it now again. So I will do a couple of trainings of pressing. And yeah, we will see. Yeah. And Alizhan, when do you plan to be back? You're playing Dwarf, right? Alizhan, are you going to fight in Amir? And when are you going to take part in Warfight after?
SPEAKER_00: Preliminary plans. Alizhan, are you here? His microphone is off. When is the next armfight planned? Engin asked, are you going to fight in the world? Yes. Artem you going to fight in the world? Yes. And if you fight, when will you theoretically be able to prepare for an armfight? And there, in my opinion, he has, if I'm not mistaken, I may be wrong,
SPEAKER_00: And when is the East-West and the code in autumn? September code, November East-West, right? September 21 is the King of the Table. End of October is East versus West. And then I think the beginning of December is the King of the Table. At the end of September, the code?
SPEAKER_03: At the end of October there will be East-West, and in December there will be King of the Table again. If the World Championship takes place in August or September, I don't know the exact date, usually it is in August or September.
SPEAKER_00: Is he competing in WAF? Yes, he is competing in WAF.
SPEAKER_00: uh he says that uh he will get ready for war and uh he may use that preparation for the um fight as well so he doesn't need any time uh to get ready who does he want to pull who does he want to pull uh
SPEAKER_00: uh he didn't think about that yet uh he says engines engine knows better i understand anyone you how is your shape right now uh it is better than it was against uh reno against david uh it is for sure better but not that much i think it is maybe five percent better
SPEAKER_00: I want to get 10%, but it is only 3-5% better, I think. And how do you feel? What do you expect? Do you believe you will win? I prefer not to think about it. I just get ready and do my best.
SPEAKER_00: I think it will be difficult. When we started the match, Artem was smaller and now I look at him and every day he is bigger and bigger. I think it will be difficult, yes. But your experience and speed is your biggest weapon, that's how I see it. Yes. But anyway,
SPEAKER_00: I think the strongest will win because it's a non-fight and there are many rounds. Well, the table will show. How do you feel about your endurance? Well, I think that it's not too bad. But perhaps Morozov's endurance is better. I'm sure that his endurance is better.
SPEAKER_01: My... Well, his endurance is really good. Yeah, but just endurance is something that depends on in which position the match goes. Just if you are in this position and if you are in this position, like the one that is in bad position gets more exhausted. This is how I think, you know. But if it is an equal position at the center, that's a different story, you know. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I'd like to get him in that bad position. Yes, this is exactly what is your chance. I see that, ready go, boom, and then he is like this. If you allow him to lock himself at the center, put the shoulder and everything,
SPEAKER_01: He is a bigger guy. He is not in the same category as you are. But your speed, the speed of hand and speed of moving sideways, experience, your control inability or the pronator and everything, when I think it's possible, it's possible to put him into that position. Because, I mean, Kamil, what would you say about Ivan's hand,
SPEAKER_01: ability of controlling pronators. You pull him right arm, not left arm, but I think he's one of the best about controlling pronators.
SPEAKER_02: yeah i would say even say something like stronger will win but i will say better one will win you know not the stronger one because our fight you have to be clever you have to be uh like fast on the setup on i've been fast on ready go and stuff like that you know even surprised me he was faster than me so uh
SPEAKER_02: so he surprised me with his speed that's one thing then second he surprised me with his knowledge how he's clever on the table because he changed the techniques whenever i do something whenever i try to do something different he find the way the best way he find the best way to stop me and this really surprised me how good he is it's not only about the power it's about his experience
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, he doesn't give himself credit about intelligence. I told him last time, he's like, oh, I don't think so, but he's super smart at table. Yes, exactly. He's super smart.
SPEAKER_02: You know, I'm not really sure how this will end up because after last match, what Ivan do with Rino, he didn't surprise me so much. Maybe he wasn't focused so much, but I think this time he will be like with me on the right hand, just fully focused and he will try to do his best, really. I think he a little bit, how to say...
SPEAKER_02: um he didn't think reno is that good i would say like that something like that he just think he's a young boy coming to to big stage but he reno surprised him a bit and then he have to you know put his ass together and and do the best to show who is that who is the daddy
SPEAKER_02: And Morozov, like he said, we all can see he's growing. He's coming back to the shape. So not sure if he will be 100% in the shape, but also we don't know how good is Alex to just look at the last match what he has. So very interesting match, to be honest.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I really want to see Ivan and Morozov to see where is the level because, you know, it can happen. If Ivan wins, this will be a shock for everyone. And I will understand that all of us are on the equal level, you know, very close. But if there will be big difference, then we are in big trouble. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ali Can, if you are ready, if you have enough time to prepare,
SPEAKER_00: Do you believe that you can beat anyone on this earth with left arm, including Levan? Do you think that if you are ready, you will be able to beat everyone on Earth, everyone in the world, including Levan? Well, if there is a chance, will you be able to?
SPEAKER_03: There are always certain chances when there is a goal. If I see a goal, then I work on it. Now I see certain goals that are sitting here. When I achieve these goals, then I can already declare more.
SPEAKER_00: Definitely, yes. If he has a goal, he starts to work and realizes this goal. Just now, his goals are in our podcast. And after us, he may think
SPEAKER_01: about maybe other bigger guys. Okay, so he says that right now, Jablonski and Matushenko are his next goals. And then after that, he can think, you know, bigger guys. But you know what is interesting, guys? If 105 kilos, if one guy who is 105 kilos and right arm guy, if he would say, I'm going to become
SPEAKER_01: the overall champion in the world. I'm going to beat all the super heavyweights. We would all laugh about it. We would just say, come on. Well, if Ali Khan says that he believes he can become number one in the world in super heavyweight category,
SPEAKER_01: I mean, we may think that he doesn't have super chance or something, somebody, but nobody can say that he doesn't have chance at all. At least I cannot say. I don't think it is something laughable after the things that he has been doing. Do you guys agree or not? Exactly. You also, you think, you think like even if it is 10%, 15%, the guy has a chance to become the best in the world with left arm, Ivan or no?
SPEAKER_00: Sorry, what's the question? The question is, like, if Alijan says he believes he will become number one in super heavyweights, would you say that it is impossible? Not about Alijan, because I see him already in top five, six, maybe, overall. I already see him there.
SPEAKER_01: So there are only several names that can stop him, maybe. And we're not sure whether they stop him or not. Yeah, that's what I say. If another guy, a 105 kilo guy or 115 kilo guy with right arm, if he says this, then we would just think it's not possible.
SPEAKER_01: But with Ali Can, it is possible. But I'm just saying that there is no other one. Evgeny Devin better not be 115 kilos if he's putting a superweight match. He needs to be a little bit heavier. But he was close, right? He's close to 115. He's only 120, so maybe he's one of those guys. Yeah, but this guy is 105. Yes.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but we don't know if it's going to happen or not. Evgeny 100, he says, 100. Yeah, but I don't think he will be weighing that low if he has a match yesterday with Levan. I think he will make sure that he will be a little bit more than 105 kilos. Can you translate him, what I just said about this subject? Because he's just listening and we are only translating what he says, but we don't translate what we say here.
SPEAKER_01: What's the main thing? I mean, we just think that he is very special. He is 105 kilos, but we believe that he can become the best while there is no body, right arm or left arm, can say the same thing, you know. Oleg, we just discussed with Sengev that you are one of the few, and even probably the only,
SPEAKER_00: a person weighing 105 kg really has a chance, well, really claims a possible title, yes, the best, regardless of the category. That even with the right hand, there are no such people now, who at 105 or even 115 could claim the title of the absolute. But at 105, of course, there are several athletes who
SPEAKER_00: I have a question for Ivan.
SPEAKER_01: Do you remember the times that Oleg Zvok was at his best, that was pulling against everybody? What do you think that he's changed against Oleg Zvok today? No way. Oleg had problems against good hookers. Have you ever lost to Oleg?
SPEAKER_00: I beat, no, I didn't lose him. I beat him. Tokarev beat him. I even saw that Zahilov managed to enforce hook. So there were some guys. And I'm sure that Alizhan would enforce hook 100%. Okay, okay, I understand. Not that level. Maybe also high, but not that. Alizhan is, I think, stronger.
SPEAKER_01: different case right yeah yeah i agree yeah i agree and okay let's talk about some of the messages quickly about the king of the table yeah i want to say something about alijan i think i think
SPEAKER_02: who can stop alijan is a guy 160 plus with huge hand and strong strong power like 11. I think this this can stop alijan from his hook this is only the one everyone who is smaller have normal hand like me they will be hooked by alijan that's what I think and how is your left arm hook
SPEAKER_02: Oh, it's hard to say because I don't train much. I train like side pressure, which is amazing. But the biceps is like, you know, 60 kilos I can move, but I think I needed like 80 kilos to move to fight against Alijan. So probably it's not great.
SPEAKER_02: uh maybe you know if i will have to have a fight with him i will focus on the biceps but i needed maybe five months to keep training keep training to get the power there some way but i am pretty sure one day i will end up with him yeah yeah yeah there are so many matches incredible
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I will have to think about him as well. David you guys watch the video I shared? Samushia vs Sasho? 85kg world title match? Yeah, I saw something. What do you think he won? Samushia against Sasho? 85kg? 85kg, yeah. Sasho just made 90kg. What do you think about this match?
SPEAKER_00: i didn't see sasha that small uh for many years so i'm not sure that he will keep his strength so it makes the fight very interesting yes i think they may be very very close in terms of technique uh it will be uh very spectacular i think but um yes it depends on uh
SPEAKER_00: Sasho, how he manages to keep his strength. It's great that Samushia has so great opponents, so great matches so often. I think it's very difficult, yes. And that makes him a great champion. Yes, he is a great champion.
SPEAKER_01: I still have some more opponents, but we will see. Ali Can, what do you think? 85 kilos. July 6 East vs West. Samushia vs Sasho. 85 kilos.
SPEAKER_03: It was a very interesting fight. I'm already interested in this fight. I fought my father-in-law in 2018. On the right hand. When he beat me, I felt that my hook was very strong at that time.
SPEAKER_03: It was very good, when I checked him. And I will say that it was a very good, spectacular fight. David you fight with Sasho? No, I didn't fight with Sasho. At that time, my right hand was very weak. I just came and spoke.
SPEAKER_03: Well, not to say that she is weak, but she is very weak in relation to the left hand. At the moment I don't train her, but nevertheless, it turns out that she has gotten used to it and she is getting better.
SPEAKER_03: Wow, we had a very long opinion about this fight. I don't fight right-handed.
SPEAKER_00: Yes, we started with Samushia and Sasho and then ended with Alizhan's plans for his right hand. Oh yeah, you want match with right hand? Alizhan, which month do you want? Do you want for July? No, not now. I will prepare it on purpose.
SPEAKER_00: Not now, later. When it's ready, he will say. So he finds this match very interesting. He's always impressed how you make passes. He said that he pulled Samushia and lost him maybe five or more years ago.
SPEAKER_00: Yes, but then he said that his right is not so good as his left. And then he said that now he wants to work on his right hand more and perhaps to get some titles on his right hand as well.
SPEAKER_01: And who is winning? Sasho or Samushia? He thinks Sasho.
SPEAKER_01: David you know that Ivan, at the WAF, he beat Reno Masic in the first match? Like, their first meeting. And then he had another war with Sandris. I think he lost, but on fouls or something. Or he lost, and then he had another match with Reno, he lost. But fresh for fresh, he beat Reno right now. I saw on the...
SPEAKER_02: uh final match and thought that uh reno was stronger but you say that uh yeah first first match he beat reno yeah and and you what do you think about this man coming oh i think uh would be very interesting match and i think uh sasho if he don't lose so much power he may be stronger i think
SPEAKER_01: I understand. You know, crazy much. So what would be the difference between them weight, 5 kilos? I mean, like when he pulled Irakli, he was like 93 or something, Sasho. Now he'll be 85. So not big difference. He's going to lose like 8 kilos.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah, not a lot, not a lot. I think David will have a lot of trouble, I think, because Sasho is very strong. So you guys are saying that David is finally losing his title? Can happen for me. Sasho usually looked great against Hukpoz. In fact, Sasho lost to...
SPEAKER_01: I'm not sure that he lost in hook against Khajiit.
SPEAKER_00: It was rather complicated, that match. It was a game. And in some round, Hadji went, top-rolled him. In other round, when Sasho expected him to top-roll him, he hooked him. So it was what, he just overplayed him, I think. No, the whole first match, Sasho was trying to slip his in.
SPEAKER_01: Olga beat him. He didn't allow him. In the second, final match, Sasho didn't try to strap and hook him. And then they were like this and Haji dragged him and opened his bicep. I think you were there, right? 2019? Were you there? Yes. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Anyway, so maybe you saw different. I saw different. I don't know. Anyway, there is a super chat. BB told, we have seen the double desperation move.
SPEAKER_02: but we haven't seen double floor press press. Kamil, will you and Jerry make this happen? Would be a fun match. I don't think it's possible. Why not? I think, I don't know, I don't see this will work. It's, you know, even if we will try and say, Jerry, let's stack in the middle with floor press, I don't think this will work. I don't know. I have no idea. I never tried, you know.
SPEAKER_01: Okay. Anyways, so today I said another match. Do you guys see me? Yes, we see you.
SPEAKER_01: It seems that Engin is not with us. He is back. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, now you guys see me. Somebody just called. I put it to the, like, I rejected the call, but somehow I get out. Okay. The match, you will see now. You will see now, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: You guys hear me, right? Yeah, one second. One second. I will show you. And I'm sure that you guys will have different opinion probably about this match, but...
SPEAKER_01: Who are these? Petro. Petro. And David. Petro. No. Petro Marharint versus David Dadikyan. David. Wow. Is that for title? Yeah. Oh, so David defends his title. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Some people may think that Petro Marharint beat only Nugo. Nugo is very strong. He beat Krasimir very convincingly. And he also beat Paseka in the same event. Do you guys know who Paseka is from Ukraine? But Petro Marharint, in fact, beat Stabin Badulescu, he beat Rustam Babel, he beat Rervas, he beat Sandris, he beat John Bersink, he beat Ongarbev, he beat everyone.
SPEAKER_01: And when will be the match? What's that? When it will be the match with them? July. Wow. Yeah. July. What do you guys think about this match? What do you guys think about this match?
SPEAKER_01: In my opinion, pound for pound, Petro Marquez is one of the strongest risks, you know. And the match, I think, will go to inside. Do you guys agree? I'm more curious about your opinion, Ivan. I will ask everyone, but I'm more curious about your opinion.
SPEAKER_00: I agree with you. I think that... Sorry about it, guys. Yeah. They have been calling me from this number, so I told them not to call. Okay. I also agree that this fight will most probably go in hook. And...
SPEAKER_00: In this case, I see David a little favorite. I think that he may be stronger in hook. But on the other hand, he has to cut weight. And Petro, I think, it's his weight. Around that weight. Yeah, 105, 106. That's his advantage. He will not cut weight.
SPEAKER_00: So all in all, interesting, but I would bet on David, maybe. I understand, yeah. Because he looked really good against Todd Hutchings. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Before that, he top-rolled more against Irakli.
SPEAKER_01: uh he toppled more and uh i think that uh pietro can stop that top row but not but not hook yes but but we'll see yes i i think it will be war i don't think that like i think when the mask starts in my opinion it will go petro side with the copying you know this is my opinion i think that petro
SPEAKER_01: in July will be stronger than last time we saw him. He had some break, so I think three months after that event, now in July, I think he will be in even better shape than the last time. Ali Can, what do you think about Petro Marharint versus David
SPEAKER_01: Dadikyan, 105 kilos. Right hand. Do you know Petro Marharint, Ali Can? Yes. Yes, yeah. I don't know. I don't know. 50 to 50, I can say.
SPEAKER_01: What's that? 50-50. Yeah. Yeah. We will see. And Tom? Artem you familiar with Petro? Yeah, yeah. I mean, I saw him on the last competition, so I think... Do you remember him? Do you remember him from the past, like Moldova events? Do you remember? No.
SPEAKER_01: In the Moldova event, Kamil, this guy beat Rewaz twice. And Rewaz gave hell to Levan in 2018 WAF, of course, top role versus top role. They had like a 30 seconds match. And then after this event in Moldova, this guy, Rewaz went outside, he just, boom, hook him. And then beat him. And then in the same event, he beat Sandris, he beat John Berzing, and then
SPEAKER_01: Earlier he beat Sabin Bagulescu. I even saw him beating Dzeranov. You remember that, Ivan? No. In 100 kilos, he beat Dzeranov, yeah. Maybe if Dzeranov tried to topple him. Yeah. Yes, in this case, that's possible.
SPEAKER_01: This guy is not normal, you know. This guy is just, I mean... When I grip with him, he has a huge hand. Yeah. Yeah, he has, yeah. Yeah. Anyway, so this is another match. What do you guys think about Irakli versus Prudnik? Right hand?
SPEAKER_02: 105 kilo right i am with iraqli but it's very interesting match to be honest but i don't i don't know what is uh the what will be the shape of prudnik because now maybe he's not 100 percent
SPEAKER_02: But I think Irakli is possible. You know, when I saw Irakli can do a good game with Lewand, I don't think he's an easy opponent for anyone, Irakli. And what do you think, Ivan? I think that Brodnik will not be able to hook Irakli. But it depends, yes. It depends how the match goes.
SPEAKER_00: Yes, very interesting and difficult to say. Because Prudnik is versatile and he may go both chop roll and hook. So that will be a kind of a game. Maybe chop roll against chop roll, maybe he will have some chances. What do you think about Prudnik?
SPEAKER_03: iraq iraq iraq
SPEAKER_00: will win if he chop rolls and prudnik will win if he hooks if he manages if he manages to hook yes no no we we know that but what does he think they will happen
SPEAKER_03: It will be a long fight, these traps. Okay, okay, okay. In the end, I think the one who wins will win. Because I don't think the opponent will be able to finish the fight. He won't be able to finish the fight and hide his hand. I think it will be a very difficult fight.
SPEAKER_01: I think it will be a long fight and the winner will be the person who has more endurance. I have one more interesting question and then we can just quickly say what our prediction is about King of the Table. Alijan, were you surprised when Badkili Oniani easily beat Aktaev? Were you expecting this match to be that easy?
SPEAKER_03: Alizhan, were you surprised? Or were you sure you would win? To be honest, I thought he wouldn't be the same. Because when I fought him at the World Championships, he had these angles.
SPEAKER_03: There were strong corners in the corners, because he was very well grouped. When he fought with a person, he was very good at grouping. And it was Tolgatov, when he started,
SPEAKER_03: It is inconvenient for him when a person is fighting his technique. He is a nanny. He groups up and puts himself in a corner and waits. And for Akhtaev, this technique is very inconvenient. And you can say that I was not surprised, because I know his strength. He kept his strength in his time.
SPEAKER_03: He says that he was not surprised that he pulled a big killer. He knows that...
SPEAKER_00: He knew that Betkili has very good defensive position and that was very uncomfortable for Talgat. Initially, it was not good for Talgat. So he expected that. And also he thinks that Betkili was rather big.
SPEAKER_01: You said that Betkili was defensive. The match wasn't like this. In fact, it was like Betkili was offensive. He got the start. I was expecting Hull to get the start first and Betkili to stop and then have a wall. But he just won the match right from the start. Evgeny the start was better. That was interesting. Go ahead, Ivan. You were saying something.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, I agree that he was better not only at defensive position, he was everywhere. My next question is, now this guy is going to pull Artem Taino for world title, 95kg. Let's start with Ali Can first and then let's go with you guys as well. Ali Can, does Beth Kelly have a chance to beat Artem Taino for 95kg world title?
SPEAKER_03: Very interesting. Very interesting? Yes. So does Betkili have a chance to win? Can you translate for me? Taynov is a very technical fighter. He is very technical. He has the ability to regroup. He knows how to think during a fight.
SPEAKER_03: And Onyali also has a very strong hook. Maybe if he manages to open it with his upper hand. This is also an interesting fight. I don't like to make predictions at all. But I see this fight like this.
SPEAKER_03: He says that he doesn't like to make predictions.
SPEAKER_00: Still, he thinks that if Vitkili manages to get to his position, as he says, to group together, to get to his defensive position, he will most probably win in hook. But Artem is very technical, and if Artem manages to top roll Vitkili, then he will have good chances to win.
SPEAKER_03: So he's basically saying that both guys have chances to win. Yes, yes. Do you think both guys have equal chances? Yes. I'm surprised that every armfighter is becoming more interesting now, because they leave a lot of questions to themselves. It's hard to make any predictions because of that. We only do what we think it should be done.
SPEAKER_00: He says that it's very difficult to make predictions in your arm fights. Every time there are some surprises and you start to think differently. So it's difficult just to predict. Yeah. And Kamil, do you understand Russian?
SPEAKER_01: not really not really okay what's what is your what is your opinion about this this is another left arm match another we are gonna make left arm great you know very nice very nice but don't forget i i'll be back with the right arm i feel like it's better and better
SPEAKER_02: yes i see that and yeah and um i think exactly same like alijan exactly same that uh basically when get in his position he got a lot of chance to win it but yeah but if he lose the wrist maybe he can lost so i just think exactly same both guys are are really top so yeah great match and iman i agree with the guys
SPEAKER_00: You agree? You don't think that like Taino is heavily favorite? You don't think that way? I also agree that most probably with Kylian is a bit stronger in hook. But Artem has two other weapons, both top roll and press, which can help him. And he uses them very effectively. Yeah. So how do you see by percentage?
SPEAKER_01: I would give maybe 55. So you think it's a very close match? Yes, maybe 60, much more.
SPEAKER_01: Engin, could you consider Nugzhari versus Lin or Lachlan? Anything is possible, my friend. Thank you for your support, Chad. And Weld Mishrev. Sorry, my friends, if I didn't pronounce correctly. Travis will beat Ali Can. Thank you, Engin, for everything you do for armwrestling. Love from Kuwait. Hello to Kuwait. Yeah, they say Travis is coming.
SPEAKER_01: We talked about arm wrestling, but do you have time, Kamil? You are in a car. Kamil. Sorry, say again? We are talking, but you are in a car. Do you have time? Yeah, I have a little bit more time. Not much because we need to go out, but let's do 20 minutes more. Okay, what's going to happen? Travis is coming and he's pulling Kalinichenko. What's going to happen there?
SPEAKER_01: I think Kalinichenko will show him a lesson, where is the level. Kalinichenko will beat him? Yeah. Every time I talk with him, every time I talk with Travis, he is more and more confident. Last time I wrote him, he wrote me back, Engin, I'm getting ready for everyone. And he wrote everyone with big letters.
SPEAKER_02: He doesn't look like he's playing. Yeah, but if you don't compete many years, you need to come back. And he chose the top guy, you know? I will tell you something. Jerry, he pulled 2019 last time. He came and directly beat Gennady.
SPEAKER_01: Last time in 2019, he came back and he beat Irakli, he beat John, he beat Michael Todd. You know, when you know what you are doing, sometimes, you know, like you can just come back and beat people, you know. How long Travis didn't pull? How long? Six years? I think that in 2018 in Moldova, he was an incredible shot.
SPEAKER_01: shape i remember in 2020 when the pandemic started you know he was also in great shape but and then he didn't i think go as it was so you are saying he's in you he won who's gonna win um it depends on travis's shape if he brings his best shape i think it may be a close fight it may be
SPEAKER_01: Oh, you are saying that Travis' best ever shape may be close shape. Like the times that he beat Dave Sheffield, he beat Jerry Cadoret, everyone like... Yes, I think his right hand was not so good as his left hand. But do you remember his 2016 when he beat Dave Sheffield, Jerry Cadoret all in one second? You don't remember that?
SPEAKER_00: I should say it once again. If he beat them that easy in 2016, you said? Yeah. And in 2005, he was head-to-head with John Brzezinski, I remember. And he has wins against many guys, you know, many top guys, you know. Well, I think that he has some chances, yes.
SPEAKER_00: really good and i think he will be big as well yeah right he will be not 115 he will be more yeah he was incredible big against arif hertem in dubai he was huge you know yeah really yes but i think that uh travis has chances to uh to take uh grinchenko's wrist but grinchenko also has a good top row
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, okay, yeah. It's rather interesting. Yeah. Alizhan, Travis is coming back. Artem you nervous about his left arm? Yeah, let's do it.
SPEAKER_01: Let's make a number match, he says. Oh, okay. Okay, okay, yeah. And then, yeah, just... Tata Hachimskrasimir, who's winning? Tata Hachimskrasimir. Krasimir? Krasimir with Tata Hachimskrasimir. Very interesting. Also, an interesting fight. Both of them.
SPEAKER_03: Good kickers. That Hutchings last time surprised everyone very well. And Krasimir, I think, lost weight. What's his weight? 105, right? 105, right? Yes. Yes. I think Krasimir lost a little weight. He used to be bigger.
SPEAKER_03: He thinks it's a very good fight.
SPEAKER_00: He thinks that Krasimir has a little more chances. And you, Ivan? I remember last time they pulled. And I think that it is maybe impossible to hold Todd in hook defensive position. Yeah, but you remember that he...
SPEAKER_00: Daddy can lift him from there. But he supinated, he curled his wrist, Todd's wrist, and he supinated his forearm. It was a very, how to say, supinated position. That's how you do hook, yeah. Evgeny maybe more. It was even more.
SPEAKER_00: Well, I think that if Chris Amir pulls the way he pulled maybe 10 years ago, I don't remember exactly when it was, it will be the same. But if he pulls differently, he will have chances. Yeah. And I have the last one and then I will ask quickly, just prediction. What's going to happen Morozov and...
SPEAKER_01: Vitalii, right arm, Jablonski.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, you know, I saw Vitalii training very hard, his right arm. And this will be very interesting, you know, how much stronger he could be on this arm. Because I think, you know, a long time ago, he was top of the top. And probably he is back with his power or even more. So I will say that Vitalii can win that.
SPEAKER_00: So you are saying that Vitalii is favored against Morozov? And you, Ivan? I also think so. I think that Vitalii is very uncomfortable for most pullers. I think that Artem may have some chances with maybe Press or Flo Priest.
SPEAKER_00: But I'm not sure that he's very good at this, right hand. But I see that Vitalii Toprovs, he will probably take his wrist. And if he manages to stop without his wrist, then he will have chances. Because he has very strong biceps and he has some potential to stop without wrist. And Alijan?
SPEAKER_03: Vitalii... Vitalii is against Artyom Morozov. When did they fight? In July. On the right-hand side. Code, right? Oh, of course. The right-hand side... The same one, right?
SPEAKER_03: I don't know about the category, but both are strong, both are good. Now I saw Valitin in the stage, and I see that he gained a little weight. If he gains weight, it seems to me that his form will become even better.
SPEAKER_03: I haven't seen Morozov yet, I haven't talked to him. Now I don't know how he is in shape after your arm fight. I think it will be visible. You better go to him now, check on the left. And absolutely also very interesting, no one wants to say anything to each other.
SPEAKER_00: He doesn't want to make any predictions. It is very interesting. He thinks that Laletin may be in his best shape. Artem also is very good. He doesn't want to say who is the winner, predict the winner.
SPEAKER_01: just just very interesting yes okay just just without the the like a detailed opinion just say who is winning coming school boy or ryan bowen school boy school boy ivan uh 50 50. i don't i don't know uh
SPEAKER_01: Ryan Bowen. What's that? 50-50, bro. Okay. Dezdaranov versus Revas. Kamil. Revas. Okay. Alijan said Dezdaranov. He's from Kazakhstan, yeah. And you, Ivan? 50-50. 50-50.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, looks like Ivan is going to go 50-50 all the matches, but let's go. Michael Todd versus Larth, come in. Michael Todd. Adyjan? Michael Todd versus who? Larth. Larth? Larth, Larth, Larth. From Norway, Norway. From Norway, yes. I don't know.
SPEAKER_01: So Michael Todd. And you? Michael Todd. Okay. And then Lachlan versus Pauline Kamil. I think it could be...
SPEAKER_00: A little bit to the Lachlan, but like 52-48, very close. Is it because of the explosiveness of Pauline and the horsepower of Lachlan? Maybe. Okay. And Ivan? Difficult to say. I think 50-50. I was rather impressed seeing Lachlan pulling Krzysimierz.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, Arabuli as well, but first with Krasimir. I think it may be a very spectacular match. Okay. Alican, Lachlan or Pauline? Pauline. Pauline. Pauline. Pauline. Okay. Okay, so let's go to a very interesting one. Very, very interesting one.
SPEAKER_01: I just can't wait to watch. Oleg Petro versus Kadyrgaly Ongarbaev. I think Oleg. I think Oleg. But maybe I think wrong. 50-50. Okay. You want? Really. Great match. Actually, last time I saw Ongarbaev against Todd Hutchings,
SPEAKER_00: And I didn't like his shape. There was something wrong, I think. So judging by that shape, I would bet on Petro. But I think that Angarbaev in his best shape, he may win also. I think right now Angarbaev is in incredible shape. He is trying to make 105. He is trying to lose to 105. And Alijan?
SPEAKER_01: Hello. He supports his teammate in any case. In any case, okay. We need Tim Bresnan versus Richard Lapkus at the event.
SPEAKER_02: He says, okay, Matushenko versus Morozov, Kamil. I would love to, if Ivan will win, but slightly more to Morozov, 55-45. Because Morozov is just much bigger. And that's why this can be more difficult for Ivan. I don't know, something like that. And you, Ali Can?
SPEAKER_03: It is very interesting that the guy who is translating for you.
SPEAKER_03: We will be waiting for a beautiful fight, and thereby, I think, with the winner or with the loser, we will probably have an armfight. I don't know what kind of selection there will be. But after your armfight, I think, there will be a lot of questions.
SPEAKER_00: he will support morozov he will support morozov um and he is looking forward this match to see our strength level and uh in terms of his future opponent okay okay so he's more interested to analyze the guys for his future matches oh
SPEAKER_00: You are more interested in our fight with Morozov. Just look at our strength ratio. Weak spots and so on. Do you want to do more analysis? Well, there is no. In general, Arhat itself will be interesting for you. And yes, you can do analysis.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, it will be interesting. Also, it will be interesting to analyze as well. Okay, the last one. Kamil Jablonski, Vitalii Laletin. By percentage. You start Kamil. Oh, really? 99% for Kamil, for sure.
SPEAKER_02: uh come in is this how you really think no i think i think 60 to 40 for vitaly 60 to 40 you give yourself 40 yeah but if i will win i'll be shocked myself because i i don't know how good
SPEAKER_01: how how good uh with the setup can be vitali on the table this will be very interesting for me because if he will let me do my move i don't think he can stop that press i i don't think anyone can stop the press if you just do that move yeah i i i saw that whenever you put that shoulder and start pressing it feels like you know a building is collapsing person's arm and this is this is how i see
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, my left arm is like that. My left holding, whatever my body can push, my left arm holding. So he will have to fight through all my body, all my weight, all my everything, if I get depressed. So he better take this guy very quickly.
SPEAKER_02: If he can, because, you know, I will be fighting to make sure I don't lose that position. So, you know, I will be studying him for next three weeks and I will be more ready than actually I was ready for Tobias. Tobias gave me already some experience with the long hand and this helped me to fight against Vitalii for sure. New experience I've got from Tobias. And Alijan? Percentage?
SPEAKER_03: Vitalii Kamil. Vitalii Kamil. I don't know. I don't know. Vitalii is also very well prepared. So let Kamil not relax. Both successes.
SPEAKER_00: So he cannot say percentage, he just wishes success and not to be relaxed, to do your best, to prepare. And you?
SPEAKER_00: little more chances for vitality yes a little much but but not uh not too much i think that uh camille has chances it depends yes on the setup on the who starts first uh like would you would you be surprised if carmen just presses his
SPEAKER_00: If Vitalii sleeps for half a second or even less, I think he may lose. I will not be surprised at all if he loses. It depends who starts first, who takes the center, yes. Maybe also 55 to 45 or something like that.
SPEAKER_01: So you are even seeing this match even closer than what Kamil says. I think Kamil is right now playing a little bit mind games inside of him. The whole fire, the whole like, you know, I saw how he was climbing those ladders with the Rocky music and everything. I don't think he's going there to lose, you know.
SPEAKER_02: Now guys, you know, I learned something I try sleep with Tobias and
SPEAKER_02: he make me so much trouble with this and when i don't try sleep i grip different and i feel much more comfortable even we have no straps so now against vitaly i am pretty sure he will do everything to don't sleep with me and i will do everything to fight with him from the beginning without straps so this will be different as well and i hope this will work okay
SPEAKER_02: Anyways, guys, thank you very much. It has been one and a half hour. Thank you to talk. I have one question to Ivan. Can I ask? Of course. Ivan, what do you think? Alijan vs Vitalii. Who will win? Just, you know, right now. Say again, Vitalii and Alijan? Yes, who will win? Just, what do you think?
SPEAKER_00: Perhaps Vitalii is the only person I would call a favorite. I would call a favorite initially, but as well, it may go both ways. He's the only person I think now left-handed that I may call a favorite, yes, but not more.
SPEAKER_01: I will ask Alishan this question. Alishan, who is the most dangerous opponent for you? In my opinion, it is Vitalii. Do you agree? He agrees, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, this is very tall. He gives his hand, low hand top roll. And it is just like a circle. Like this guy can beat, this guy, that guy can beat. And in my opinion, Kamil is the worst technique for Vitalii. I think, I mean, I'm not saying he will beat, but if I would choose, like if I need to choose someone, if it was a,
SPEAKER_01: computer game or it's like a street fighter, but it's an arm wrestling, I would choose Kamil's character to be Vitalii's character. I'm not saying he will, but that, like once you are like this, and then if you have so much pressure here, you know, like diving like this, and then you are somehow turn like this, and then you are on your brachialis, it's just very dangerous thing, very dangerous thing, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Have you thought about creating a video game with Armwrestling East-West? We should, we should, we should. I mean, we should. It would be incredible, incredible. I wish we had someone, but it is not like a cheap job, you know. We need to do a real good one. Right now, I'm busy with the real game, real game right here, you know.
SPEAKER_01: And I love it. I love it. You guys are, for me, it's just like incredible, incredible just to see your abilities and you all are very strong personalities, you know, and everything just, I'm like, I, you know how much I love armwrestling. I competed many years and I'm almost 50 years old. If I compete, I can compete two, three years.
SPEAKER_01: But I am ready to give up on my personal dream just to serve this dream and just enjoy it. I think I enjoy doing this more than arm wrestling. I just think that you guys, what we are doing is much more important than my personal dream, you know.
SPEAKER_01: And I would never sacrifice my own dream for anything else, you know, but just this is incredible. Anyways, guys, thank you very much, Kamil. Thank you very much, Ali Can. Thank you. Thank you, everyone. Good luck to you guys, but also good luck to your opponents because we all are brothers in arm wrestling. I'm an organizer. Hey, hello.
SPEAKER_01: i wasn't alone yeah i know i know i know i see them i see them anyway so you all take care you want to say anything else before we close no so i will say good luck for everyone and see you soon on the table guys for sure see you soon with you thank you again for inviting it was great to be with you today yeah yeah yeah alejan take care brother
SPEAKER_03: Thank you, guys. Thank you. Thank you.
