He just does very, very light trainings to maintain his good endurance, just for only for endurance, light training, he said.

SPEAKER_01: I said in the chat that I hope that you will have enough time to rest in Turkey and you will be ready for the table.
SPEAKER_01: Of course, I will root for Zurab because we are both Georgians. I was very impressed by your match against Nugo.
SPEAKER_01: I hope that he gets enough time to be 100% ready for Zurab.
SPEAKER_01: And I told him, obviously, I will root for Zurab because I'm Georgian, but I wished him all good. And I also said that his match against Nuko was really, really shocking to me, really shocking in a good way. I was happy and I was satisfied as an Armys League fan overall. And I told him that I see his very bright and great future at East versus West, in my opinion. And he was obviously thankful for it.

SPEAKER_01: Thank you, thank you. Hello, hello. Hello, hello. Hello, hello.
SPEAKER_03: hello ray hey guys hey guys good to see you petrov hello hello
SPEAKER_01: I just told Zurab that we have missed him. It's been a long time since he competed with us and I told him that he chose the pretty tough tough match for comeback, right? And he said that yes, because I don't like easy matches.
SPEAKER_04: he said we we like we all know zura doesn't like easy matches and uh but i i ask him please like how like is he ready because it's not so long after the break right and sometimes it takes a little bit longer how long has it been uh uh he understood your question right yeah he will answer it
SPEAKER_03: How long did it take after the operation? How long did it take? From the beginning of the operation to the end of the operation, it takes about one year and two days. After the operation, it takes about two days and the operation takes about four days. After that, it takes about one year.
SPEAKER_01: It's going to be exactly one year and two days when the event day comes because last year, July 2nd, he broke his arm and July 4th was his surgery. So July 6th would be exactly one year and two days later.
SPEAKER_04: one year so to say he's uh took his time to heal up okay he didn't though he did but zurab is crazy and we all modern because of that right he takes all these crazy matches and uh i i just hope it's it's good i want to ask to petro real quick and um petro um
SPEAKER_04: Last time you had Nugo. Tell us about that match, how much it surprised you. Petro, last time you had Nugo. What was the surprise? He was much stronger than you expected, right?
SPEAKER_00: I didn't expect him to be strong. I didn't expect him to be uncomfortable for me. He turned out to be very uncomfortable. And I couldn't even take it normally. I was lowered very low. And it created a lot of discomfort for me in the fight. At first, I couldn't even turn on the fight. But then I got together and it went. He's powerful, of course. Powerful. He pulls up hard.
SPEAKER_00: Such an uncomfortable, very uncomfortable opponent.
SPEAKER_04: So I asked him, did you expect Nulo to be so strong? He said, I expected him to be so strong, but I didn't expect him to be so uncomfortable. I couldn't get a good grip that I wanted to. Every time it felt very awkward and very weird. And I couldn't even turn myself on for the match in the first few rounds. And then at the end, I turned and then I felt better. But he's also very, very strong.
SPEAKER_04: lot of pullback and uh but very very uncomfortable so this time zura we know zura will pull inside there's mostly not going to be any top pro maybe something but the most threat is going to be inside is that an easier match for you um
SPEAKER_04: We know that Zurab is more in a circle, almost always goes in a circle. He can do everything, but his iron is in a circle. Do you think it's better for you that he doesn't have to think, maybe someone can do pull-ups, he will go where you are also strong?
SPEAKER_00: Psychologically, it's better for me. But when I started fighting Nugo, I thought he would open me up. But in the second fight, I realized that I didn't have to think about it anymore, because I felt that he wouldn't be able to open me up. But it was still very difficult for me to fight him, so I think it won't give me the advantage that Zurab doesn't fight at the top.
SPEAKER_04: He's a very strong hooker, so I'm going to adjust to the same tough fight as with Nugo. He said, well, maybe mentally it will be same or easier because you don't have to worry about many different things. From Nugo, I didn't expect he would be so strong inside. This time I know how strong Zurab is and I know where he goes. So I expect him to be very strong and that's what I'm preparing for.
SPEAKER_01: Roman? Thank you very much, Letia. Zurab, I would like to ask you something, but I don't want to interrupt you. In your opinion, how did you feel when you heard the news? How did you feel when you heard the news? It's not that I was very happy, or that I was very happy, but how did you feel when you heard the news? I was very happy about everything. I understand how Petro felt about Petro.
SPEAKER_01: That will save us time. So yeah, I guess he doesn't need my translation because he understands what you say in Russian. Will we see a top roll from you? Will you try the top roll, Petro? No. Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: I can do it. No problem. But in the second competition you... Yes, because he is my son. So for me hook is better.
SPEAKER_04: okay yeah i'll translate this go ahead i asked him will we see a top roll from him and he said that uh i i might try something in in practices i usually top roll but this when i go to competition i go where i'm strongest and that's always in the hook and he said the same thing same thing about petra right he can do a lot of things but we know where he's the strongest yeah yeah
SPEAKER_01: So shall we get to their own matches or should we do like last time, just go through from top to bottom and then...
SPEAKER_04: Let's talk about some of the main matches, but I want to ask Petro something big. Zurab is coming back from a broken arm. Is that give you like, do you expect him to be like top Zurab or you will see a different version? Zurab broke his arm almost a year ago. When you have a match, it will be two years from now.
SPEAKER_00: Do you think he will be the same old, strong as he was, or do you think he's not ready yet? I understand, of course, that he most likely will not recover 100%. Well, he will not recover. I know people with such fractures have recovered a lot. But I will not count on it at all. I will erase Zurab in his best form.
SPEAKER_00: Well, he will be in the form in which he fought before. I will not count his weaknesses. I will count on what he will be in all his glory. I don't want to relax at all. Maybe he will be weaker, I don't want to count on that.
SPEAKER_04: So he said that he doesn't think that people can recover to 100% in that short of a time. But he's thinking in his mind that he will face the best Zurab possible, the strongest Zurab. So he's not putting any doubts in his mind that he should be relaxed or something. So he's going in this with a mindset that he's facing the strongest opponent he has ever faced. Yeah, which is very good. Very good.
SPEAKER_03: Do we have any questions? I just don't see the chat or something. Yeah, I'm constantly monitoring the chat whenever we go.
SPEAKER_03: If I lost, for example, it wouldn't be an excuse that I'm not 100% ready. I'm 100% ready, that's why I have an unfight, that's why I have a match. That's why Petro was right to say that he thinks I'm in my best shape. It's true, because if I wasn't sure, I wouldn't have accepted this match.
SPEAKER_03: There will be no excuse that I broke my arm, so I won't return it. There was no time. There will be no such excuse from me. Because I'm 100% ready.
SPEAKER_04: Okay, I'll translate this. So he said that if I lose to Petro, there will now be no excuses that I broke my arm and I wasn't ready or this or that. I took this match because I feel ready. I feel confident. I feel strong. There will be no excuses from my side. If I lose, I'm coming in and I know I'm ready. Okay.
SPEAKER_01: There are two questions for Zurab. One is from the Drew, our moderator. Zurab, did Zurab get metal rods in his arm? And how bad was it? It's a mechanism, isn't it?
SPEAKER_01: I don't know if it's true or not, but I think it's true. I don't know if it's true or not, but I think it's true. I don't know if it's true or not,
SPEAKER_03: I don't know if it's my fault that I don't like metal. It's my discomfort that makes me feel uncomfortable. I don't know if it's my fault that I don't like metal. It's my discomfort that makes me feel uncomfortable.
SPEAKER_03: You don't know this, because this metal is the result of the fact that you can't feel it. That is, there is no discomfort and there is no thought that there is something wrong with the metal in the hand. If you feel it, you can't feel it because there is metal in the hand.
SPEAKER_01: Well, it has no negative effect whatsoever neither on his mind nor on his physical feelings about the factor that he has the metal thing in his arm. Moreover, he said that I even think that it's just a normal arm because the way it's attached to the bone, you physically cannot feel it, that it's there and there's no
SPEAKER_01: no discomfort whatsoever whenever he's training. So he said that it has never affected me in a negative way and I barely even notice it's there. So he just feels the Drew, he just feels that it's just a normal arm for him and no discomfort whatsoever. So it was not bad. My problem is that I don't feel any discomfort.
SPEAKER_03: After the operation, my problem was that when the nerve of the operation was touched, it was a small nerve, and my arm, my shoulder, was swollen, as you can see, which means that after the operation, it was swollen, and I couldn't move the machine to the maximum speed, because I didn't have any discomfort in my legs. And that's why I'm disabled. That's why I'm 10% disabled.
SPEAKER_01: All right. So he added on top that the issue that it was with the bone because of the fracture has all 100% solved right now. It's recovered. And moreover, he said there has never been mainly issue with bone.
SPEAKER_01: but it was issue with the nerve damage that accidentally the doctor touched. It was not damaged, but it touched the way that it triggered this flexor nerve. Within seven months, roughly, the arm was like this, he could not move.
SPEAKER_01: And then this extends your flexor and extends your nerve. So after seven months, he said that it was recovered. It came back and then he started to train his wrist again. And it's been already like months that it's 100% healed. And slowly he started to get back on his weight gains, which leads us to the second question that was with Zurab asked by
SPEAKER_01: Another, I forgot where it was, but I just remembered the question. It was about whether he reached his peak in training or not.
SPEAKER_03: As you know, my maximum strength is not only in my strength, but also in the trauma that comes with it. And when you get out of the uniform, you lose weight.
SPEAKER_03: And when I put it in the form, it will be like this. In fact, my weight is 40 kg, and my weight is 220-210 kg, and my maximum weight is 130 kg. I don't think it's possible, because the weight of the key is static.
SPEAKER_03: biceps, hips, legs, and so on. Therefore, I would say that I am 100% sure that I will progress and progress. Whatever happens to me, my progress will happen to me.
SPEAKER_01: So even though he feels he's reached his 100%, he still believes that there's a rule to progress and improve as the time goes on. Regarding to the weight, he said that armwrestling related weights, he's there, especially the static moves.
SPEAKER_01: However, the static holds. However, the bench press is the training exercise, which he has not reached his peak yet. He's stuck at 170 kg.
SPEAKER_01: when he last time pulled it because of the shoulder pain he mentioned and he just did not force himself to try to reach over 200 that was his previous record so he just left it there in hopes of it would not be decisive for arm wrestling match that he is about to face against petrol so other than that he feels he's 100 percent uh back on track
SPEAKER_04: Maybe you can ask Petro the same question, like, his preparation, how long he knew about the match. Petro, how was the preparation? How much time did you have to prepare for this match? How much? And, believe me, how do you feel? David you lose weight? Or was it the same as the last time? Tell us. Well, I think I'll be in the same shape. As for the preparation, when I started,
SPEAKER_00: I came, rested for a couple of weeks, and Ingin wrote to me right away. When he wrote to me, I was already getting ready. There were still pains in my arm and shoulder. He asked for my form, and I said that I was almost recovered.
SPEAKER_00: And it turns out that I would almost never stop training for this warfight. So I think I will be in the same shape, at least.
SPEAKER_04: so he said after the last match he took a few weeks off and then he already started doing some training um nothing too serious and then engen called him asked him about his form he said i'm good uh had some shoulder issues like everyone has on elbow issues but worked on it and he said i'm not gonna be any worse than i was the last time i pulled i expect to be around the same shape yeah
SPEAKER_04: Let's go into the matches. Let's go. There's some matches, I think, that are closer to our hearts than the others, right? The one that I want to know the thoughts of these guys is Oleg Petro versus David Dedican.
SPEAKER_04: Petro, what do you think? We saw the King of the Table from Oleg. Is there a chance for Dadikyan? Of course, Dadikyan has a chance. After listening to Dadikyan, as he said about Larratt, you can conclude that Petro has no chance.
SPEAKER_00: I know for sure that there will be a tough fight. I support Petro, but it's hard for me to say who will win.
SPEAKER_04: yeah so he he said uh uh i asked him like from the last performance petrenko showed on king of the table do you think he uh that he can has any chances of beating him and he said from what uh that he can said about devon larrett in his previous uh interviews we would think there's no chances anyone can beat dadika but um he expects there's gonna be like a crazy crazy war from both of them they're both like
SPEAKER_04: crazy strong technical armors on the table so he expects it to be real real fight uh of course he's supporting uh oleg but he he doesn't he cannot tell who will win for him it's also 50 50 this match
SPEAKER_03: Fifty-fifty. Fifty-fifty? Crazy match. In Georgian, when he speaks English. For me, it's a double progression. But for me, Petro is the most important person in Dadikyan. For me. Petro is the most important person in Dadikyan. I would say fifty-fifty, but...
SPEAKER_03: Petro is the only one who is interested in this, so there is no doubt about it.
SPEAKER_01: He said it's going to be extremely tough for both guys to gain the victory in that match. However, he believes that Oleg is very uncomfortable for David. He said like, I'm 100% sure. I'm sure Oleg will be uncomfortable for David. But he couldn't say who would win. He said 50-50.
SPEAKER_01: What my personal gain from this opinion, from Zuroop's opinion, I believe is that he thinks for Dadikyan, Oleg will be a tougher opponent than Dadikyan's previous match. Because he underlined that Oleg is extremely uncomfortable for him. But still, he could not go decisive.
SPEAKER_03: Awesome match. I think that Petro and Dadikyan's game was a draw. Petro was an excellent draw for Dadikyan's game. Dadikyan's progression was similar to that of Hutchings, but it wasn't. Petro's physical performance was very good.
SPEAKER_01: He said that most likely scenario Petro will be able to supinate David's arm like this and David has to battle from there like that position. However, he also remarked that the match with Todd Hutchings, David Tavikian actually showed us that he has progressed significantly from that losing position type of supinated position to gaining back the winning position and actually even finished the round.
SPEAKER_01: um we don't know what will happen this is what rob said however uh petrenko is like extremely extremely strong like getting even tougher to go higher levels than he ever been so great match awesome match awesome match this is uh and uh the guys that we will most likely not
SPEAKER_04: get on the pod is uh two great champions uh very introvert champions they go to r um how does guys see this match uh petro
SPEAKER_04: Everyone knows how dominant Sasho is. He still is. But he will be throwing to 85. And every time we see a surprise from David Samushia. He shows us what we don't think is possible. How do you look at it?
SPEAKER_00: I look at it this way. If Samushia can stop Andreev, then most likely he will hold him back. Because it's really so serious for an athlete to throw him off. His form will be different there. He will not be in his best. I just know.
SPEAKER_00: And if he stops, if he can't get to the pillow, I think he'll lose. He's very tough, and that's why he wins. Because of his paranormal strength.
SPEAKER_04: So he said he thinks it's a huge disadvantage that Sasho is losing weight. He's cutting weight for this one. And if you lose weight, he's telling from his own experience that you will not be in your best shape. The second thing he said, if Sasho cannot get him to the pad straight away, there's going to be big problems. And I believe David Samushia can win from that. He has crazy strength right there when he catches you in the middle of the center. The hand is good. And
SPEAKER_03: He believes that David can win it, can beat him. What do you think, Dzurash? I think that Sasho will be the favorite in the first round. Everyone will be in the first round. And I think that it will be easy for Seba to win. And Samushia will be comfortable.
SPEAKER_03: The first two rounds, I think Sasho is the favorite, but the seventh round is the last. In the fourth round, Sasho is the champion. Therefore, I think Mandupe Samushia has a good chance of winning. Because he is strong and he fights like he is my opponent. The first two rounds will be dominated by Sasho. Samushia's fight, I think,
SPEAKER_01: He put Samushia as a victorious in this round. He said that first two rounds will be most chances that Sasho will have, like Sasho will be favorite in first two rounds. But after that, up to the seventh round, it will get worse and worse for Sasho and Samushia will be
SPEAKER_01: beating him in endurance game and endurance wise it will be decisive he said that because of this endurance that Samushia has moved it will play a huge role for him to win fourth round four rounds consecutive rounds so that he may need to come back from losing rounds that Sasho may potentially can have
SPEAKER_01: in first beginning rounds so he said he he believes that Sasho will win and he said that Sasho will be favorite in first two rounds
SPEAKER_04: okay okay yeah awesome match like for me this is because i'm 85 guys so i'm really interested in this one and two two amazing athletes right uh if david samushi wins this one he goes in the hall of fame of arm wrestling what he has done um i don't know like he listen his new nickname will be undertaker
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, right. Yeah. Yeah. Technically, he's taking it. I called him invincible. Remember, I called him invincible because he always was like, like, like TV show, but he's turning into an undertaker now. You know, it's nice. Now you talk about matches you like.
SPEAKER_01: I like every matches, but like you said, some of them are close to our hearts. From personal perspective, like all the Georgian matches are always closer than the rest, but I think that's inevitable. But also all Georgians are pulling in awesome matches like this one. I can't wait. If Zurab shows up in a good form, there's going to be a war there. It's going to be a war.
SPEAKER_01: I'm curious how good Zurab is right now coming back because no matter how good you are, I'm sure Zurab would agree with me. When you have a pause, you are also like, I don't know, am I in a good shape? I need to find out. And that's why Zurab is like, give me the toughest match and let's go. So props to him.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah. So I would like to ask them about the Artyom versus Vitalii, the main, main, main headliner, main event of the East versus West, main match of East versus West 13. Zurab, I'll start from Zurab couple matches, and then we can also start from Petro. What do you think about Marju Nakhelze? What do you think about Marju Nakhelze, Morozov, Vitalii Sinatik? What do you think about Morozov? What do you think about him?
SPEAKER_03: I think he's a champion. No, he's not. No, he's a champion. Yes, he's a champion. 3-2.
SPEAKER_01: He said that Morozov will eventually win the match. However, until he decides how to actually get start the round and how until he gets actually all linked up and all like switched on against Vitalii, it will take maybe a couple rounds for him. So he said possibly 3-2 for Morozov. So Vitalii will be...
SPEAKER_00: also favorite at the beginning rounds and then arthur will finally turn on and he will he will know what to do in in the in the game in the match so yeah three two he said okay um
SPEAKER_00: He adjusts himself during the fights. He's a very good strategist. That's why it will be very hard for Vitalii to win him. It's hard to say. I can't even guess which one of them. But there will be a fight like Petro vs. Dadikyan. It will be long and unpredictable.
SPEAKER_04: So he said Vitalii is great at taking the hands and opening up and doing his technique perfectly. And Artem is really great at adjusting. And he believes that he even adjusts during the match and gets better and can do a lot of different things. So he believes, and for him it's hard to pick who has better chances, but he expects it to be the same type of war we're going to see from Petro and Dadikyan. Crazy, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I hope it will be.
SPEAKER_04: believe actually it will be a very very uh not one-sided so it will i i thought both guys don't give up both guys don't give up they they won't i i don't i don't see any of them like i think plus and i think because they have options right vitaly will top roll yeah i wanted to say he will talk about if he die and artem can fight in any position right with risk no results awesome awesome match that's the main event for sure yeah that's the main event
SPEAKER_01: but yeah uh so many great matches i also i would i would love to hear their opinion about iraqi's uh shape right now how how awesome street he has uh since he lost against david he dropped down to the weight class and he said he was comfortable i was interviewing him with you array we were together when uh we did this interview and he said he feels much comfortable that way around like 97 98 around 95 kg so
SPEAKER_01: so far it looks great for him to be in this category 95 kg but right now he is challenging prudnik who is uh who could be maybe even toughest challenge that iraq has ever had so i would ask uh about his opinion about this match
SPEAKER_01: 105 kg right arm. Evgeny Prudnik, how do you feel in 15 kilos? You've been in Iraq for a long time, and now you're in 48 meters, which is very comfortable for you. What do you think? I don't know what to say about Iraq. But I don't think Prudnik is a favorite in Iraq.
SPEAKER_03: Mithunete is a great player, probably seven or eight kilometers away from being a great player. Irakli is a very progressive player, Sasho Andreev is a great player, in which Brodnick was also a very good player. However, as you can see, the math of the players is not very good. Brodnick is not a favorite, probably.
SPEAKER_03: But he is still a big favorite. He was probably born in 1985-1985. I don't know why.
SPEAKER_03: Do you think there will be more rounds? This is the third round. Of course, but I don't think there will be more than three. I think there will be at least three more rounds.
SPEAKER_01: So he favorized in this match Prudnik slightly. He said 55% to 45%. He said we have to keep in mind the weight difference. He believes there will be around seven, maybe five to seven kg weight difference, considering what both athletes told us, right, Irakli and Prudnik. So in Rob's opinion, that will play the role.
SPEAKER_01: and also that um iraqli uh even though he has beaten um sasho who has beaten prudik multiple times in armwrestling as we all know math doesn't work so just because one guy beat the other one doesn't mean that the other one will beat also the third guy who has beaten the first one so
SPEAKER_01: Long story short, he believes both guys will have chances. I asked him, would you think that it would be a clean sheet? And he said, no, it will be at least 3-1, regardless of who will win. But he thinks slightly favorite is still Prudnik. And yeah, 3-1. There will be no domination. There will be a good match, good fight. But yeah, slightly favorite Prudnik.
SPEAKER_04: There will be a match between Irakli and Evgeny. Irakli told us that he felt in the best shape when he weighed 97 kg.
SPEAKER_04: um
SPEAKER_00: But I don't think Zhenya will be in his best form yet. In the form he was when he was young. But Irakli is getting better. And Zhenya might have some problems. But I think Zhenya will win if he recovers well.
SPEAKER_04: Okay, so he said he believes that he has a good chance of winning. He has automatically have to support Prudnik and he said and also looking at the match with everything. The thing that bothers him is knowing what kind of shape Prudnik is in because he believes he's not going to be at his best shape or he believes he's not there where he was.
SPEAKER_01: but he still believes Prudnik will manage to win, but it's not going to be an easy match, no. I will live also like that, it will not be. Well, actually, I said, last time I said it was, it will be, if Irakli beats him, he would be beating him three times, because in seventh round match system, I would favor Prudnik, because of his versatility, his experience, and his
SPEAKER_01: endurance could be also the issue but in this case I'm slowly also getting more towards today actually it will be a good fight it will not be a three-note match so we'll see yeah I don't know if I have not heard because I'm like I said this is my favorite one favorite matches as a Georgian your opinion uh I don't recall you told me so could you also share with us uh what do you think about this match here at the versus Brunei
SPEAKER_04: Irakli has what Neil calls an acid weapon, where he can just quickly take care of you, right? And most likely they're going to go opposite. Prudnik want to hook and he wants to top roll. So I see that Irakli has good chances there and he can go through. But what we have seen from Prudnik in the past,
SPEAKER_04: in any class he's at the very top of that class and if we talk like 105 115 i think he's right on the top of that class as best as they can be as versatile as they can be as a strong like he has all the things he was at one point we thought he was the second coming of john brzenk right so
SPEAKER_04: I I have him as a favorite but if it actually beats him I will not be surprised I will not be surprised because it actually is like he's progressing and he embraced his style more and I feel like he's things that allow him to win and when he loses he learns from that loss and gets back that's what that's what I keep seeing yeah yeah I see I see that too as well
SPEAKER_01: Great. Speaking of Georgians, I would also love to hear Taino and Betkili's match, Onyane's match. So this time we can hear from Petro first. Betkili versus Artyom.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: He believes that Artem will have to say
SPEAKER_04: will dominate by being uh the mover of the match because he's so explosive he's uh and he's saying that he's following him and he sees that he's improving improving getting better and better and uh he believes action will win this match um
SPEAKER_03: Samushia's ability to play with the ball and Betkili's ability to play with the ball. If Betkili is able to play and score a goal, the chances of Betkili are very high. He has 90% and Shemzli has only 10%. Therefore, the style of Alfaid,
SPEAKER_01: He said that if he gets hold on to, like, if he stops Taynov's explosiveness, his chances will increase. And eventually, he believes that since because it's longer rounds,
SPEAKER_01: at some point uh artem's explosiveness will so wear down so to say and uh that killer will win however like explosiveness it's it's very uh dangerous weapon the title has so it's it's the question of that so yeah tough tough tough to call
SPEAKER_01: uh two touchings versus customer cost again this uh round this match is also very important and slowly we're gonna start to wrap up because like always we are uh um running uh uh yeah i have to leave like in five minutes i have uh i have to catch a bus so yeah yeah yeah oh so quickly let's start with yeah yeah sure all these uh
SPEAKER_03: We all know that Krasimir was a very important person. He was a very important person. Krasimir was a very important person. Krasimir was a very important person.
SPEAKER_03: Throughout the history for Krasimir whenever he was in good shape and then he dropped down he maintained the stable shape and now
SPEAKER_01: Finally, we see some signs that he's slowly also getting back into his stronger and better shape. However, for Krasimir, in Zulop's opinion, Todzilla is extremely uncomfortable. And because of that, he would take him as a favorite in this match. So he thinks 60 to 40% Todd Hutchings has the chances to beat Krasimir. Petro, Krasimir vs. Todd Hutchings.
SPEAKER_00: Well, judging by their previous fights, I have the impression that Hutchings will win. But I think that Kostadinov will be well prepared for him, because for him this is a very responsible fight. And knowing Krasimir, he can prepare well. He can take it and make a good form. Therefore, I would not say that Hutchings will win him. It will be very interesting.
SPEAKER_00: But the favorite for you is Todd, right? Well, I think that yes, after all, according to the previous fights, the favorite is Todd.
SPEAKER_04: So he said that for him, the favorite is Todd, especially if you look at their last matchup. He also said that Krasimir, he takes this very seriously, and most likely he is. He might show up in a great shape and is ready to face Todd Hutchings. And also because they pulled before, he can bring in a really good shape. So he won't say that Krasimir is going to be easily run over.
SPEAKER_01: he believes there's going to be a match but that is the favorite so guys we are about to wrap up uh i would just really briefly say that uh we need to hear just briefly from each or each of them what do they think will be a score between them so zura
SPEAKER_03: because he was a great sportsman in his early years. He was a great athlete. He was a great athlete in his early years. He was a great athlete in his early years. He was a great athlete in his early years. He was a great athlete in his early years. He was a great athlete in his early years. He was a great athlete in his early years. He was a great athlete in his early years. He was a great athlete in his early years.
SPEAKER_03: from predictions and predictions, but the results were satisfactory. Let's hear from Petro Petrova.
SPEAKER_01: So, yeah, he said that he cannot say exact score at this time, but he would say he respects so much Petro. He knows how many great names and great athletes Petro has beaten in this sport, and it would take us very long to start counting those names and mentioning them. So he says, Petro, I respect you very much and
SPEAKER_01: i i hope that everything will be great however uh regardless regardless i'm coming here to win i'm coming to beat you and i'm uh i will do everything i cannot say the score but make sure he told me make sure roman to tell him i respect him
SPEAKER_04: The last question will translate. Roman asked, what do you think will be the score at the end? He asked Zurab. Zurab said he can't say the score. He said that he respects you very much. This list of athletes that you beat is very long.
SPEAKER_04: He knows how strong he is, but he will come to win. He's there to beat you. But he respects you very, very much. Maybe you can say something for Zurab? Well, thank you both. I also respect Zurab very much. I already remember Zurab from about 2017 or 2018. I remember him constantly in the prizes.
SPEAKER_00: He was a very powerful athlete, he always ran a lot. I was even honestly amazed by his weight. I was in shock with him, to be honest. But in general, Zurab was always an example of great love for armwrestling.
SPEAKER_00: He was always on fire. I remember... He was always second. Zaloyev was always losing. And he kept going and going and going. And I can't remember exactly, but in 2020 or 2021, I came and congratulated him for the first time as a world champion. I think he was the first to win the world championship. He was always... It was in 2013.
SPEAKER_00: In 2019, right? Yes, yes. I think it was only recently. And Zurab is such a stubborn person for me. He's stubborn, I know that for sure. I've talked to him a lot in the Georgian national team. And I respect him a lot too. Thank you very much, brother. I respect you a lot. Thank you.
SPEAKER_04: So he said, I also respect Zurov a lot. And I remember him in 2017, 2018. First, I never, he was always cutting a lot of weight. And I was always thinking like, I felt very bad for him. He was cutting that weight. And what I see from him is great love for the sport of armwrestling and great passion.
SPEAKER_04: for many many years uh he took the second place in world championships and then i remember in 2000 we corrected 2019 uh won his first world title and then petro congratulated him there and was very happy for him to get it there's a lot of respect between both of these athletes and also the same things would upset
SPEAKER_01: Awesome. Awesome, man. It's great that Zurab also understands real time what he's talking. So it was awesome stream. Thank you, Ray. Thank you, Zurab. Thank you, Petro, for joining. And I will hope that we will see the great, great match between you guys and awesome event. I believe so.
