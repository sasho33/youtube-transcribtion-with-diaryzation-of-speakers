SPEAKER_02: I don't know if Zirakashvili will be number one. Zirakashvili is already number one in the world in 95 kilo category. If you are saying super heavyweight category, he will not be. He will not be. His hands, I don't think his structure is for super heavyweights. I don't think so. 105, possibly 150 in the future, not super heavyweights. He's great. He may be some of the super heavyweights, but not the
SPEAKER_02: We're the best ones. Hello, hello, Malin. I was going to invite you to Malin, but we have we needed a translator for Olga Terpelova and it had to be a Russian translator. So because the screen, I like it like up to four people.

SPEAKER_02: We can ask Ivan how his arm is feeling. Ivan was stronger than what I expected and yeah it will be incredible. What do you guys think that you know how Vitalii Laletin and Morozov lately going at each other and they have a friendly
SPEAKER_02: teasing yeah he was talking about pronator and then he said like overall power is even more important and then today lalessian said this don't worry about my overall power just worry about your own wrists they will suffer a lot during the july 60s what what vitaly said yeah
SPEAKER_02: Irakli Ongarbeov rematch. We can do many things, but we, I mean, I don't think that it is something on plan. And Ongarbeov said that he's going to have, I think, surgery, small surgery. So he will be here probably four or five months later, maybe more. I don't know. That's what he said. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Hello, Carolina. You hear? You don't see, you don't hear Carolina? Oh, he replied, Morozov replied. I am 177, I think, or 78, 77. But not a great posture, but Morozov replied. What did he say?
SPEAKER_02: It's interesting. I didn't know about that one. You're here, Carolina? Yes, I'm here. Hello. Oh, okay. Because I have been talking and you didn't hear at the beginning. So maybe you just turned the sound on or what? Yes, yes. I did now. I did now. Sorry. Okay, okay, okay. Yeah. How is everything going? It's good. I am fine. That's good. That's good. Very soon your opponent will come and Ivan Motyshenko will come also to translate. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Have you ever pulled Olga Terpelova? I don't think you did because I think these athletes, many of them started after you quit for some time. Yes, that's right. And now you come back and then they don't compete internationally because of obvious reasons. Yeah, I think, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah. So as you said, like many of these new female stars, they came during my break. But, you know, I have always been watching them. So even when I had my break, I always watched the Europeans and the WAF. So I have seen them and I have been wanting to compete with them. So really excited. So you knew her even before I said the match?
SPEAKER_00: Yes, of course. I have seen her pulling top level in... Hello, Olga. Hello, Olga. Hello, welcome. In WAF and EAF, so I know her for sure, 100%. And I've been wanting to compete with her when I've seen her. Okay, okay. And I think before she was competing like 55 in the first? Yes. Okay, yeah. Olga, can you turn your phone?
SPEAKER_02: One second. Yeah. OK, we are now waiting for Ivan Matyshenko. And then he can translate to us. Yeah, sounds good.
SPEAKER_02: I think when I have watched her, she has like similar pulling style as me. That's one of the reasons I wanted to try her, you know. I don't know who said that, but one of the athletes that I did podcast, he said that he was going to be like a top roll versus top roll, finger versus fingers. Hello, Ivan. Hello. Hello. Good to see you, my friend. Good to see you.
SPEAKER_02: People were asking in the chat, how is Ivan's arm after the match? Does it hurt? It hurts as usual, nothing worse. I think it's the same as it was before the fight.
SPEAKER_02: So nothing new, okay, I understand, yeah. I hope so, I didn't train yet. But it seems to be good. Okay, okay. And I was amazed by your performance. I must say that I was amazed by your performance more than the performance of Morozov. Because I thought that you had to be so quick and finish, you know, catch him in a bad position.
SPEAKER_02: But even in an equal position, you perform very well. And yeah, I was very impressed by your performance. Thank you. And I think this is what you were saying. I think before the match, you were saying that you want to give a good match at least. You were saying that. And it was at least a good match. Yeah, it was a very good match. Yeah, very good match. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Anyway, so let's focus on these two athletes that will compete. Can you ask Olga, when did she last time compete in international? Olga? Hi. Hi. Engin asks, where did you last compete in international competitions?
SPEAKER_04: In the last international competition, I competed at the World Championship in Romania in 2021. It was the last World Championship in which the Russian national team participated. Then I took the second place in the 55 kg category in both left and right hand wrestling. Who was your opponent? I don't remember for sure. I lost to Ezra Kiraz. From Turkey?
SPEAKER_02: Oh, is it 2021, Romania? Yes, 2021, Romania. 52nd? Yes, both times. Yeah, okay, okay. And this year, that was 55 kilos. This year she competed 60 kilos at the nationals. And this year she competed 60 kilos at the nationals.
SPEAKER_04: Yes, this challenge was 60 kilograms.
SPEAKER_01: Because she didn't want to cut weight. Because no international tournaments. And she wanted to... She said something about health. She didn't want to harm her health with cutting weight. Okay, okay. And she became first. You won, right? Yes, yes. Right. And she won with right hand.
SPEAKER_04: And one more question before I go to Carolina. Was it a hard competition or was it easy? Was it hard to win in Russia? What can you say about the participants? The roster was good, but the only difficult thing was my final fight. I won all the other fights quite easily.
SPEAKER_01: It was quite easy for her except the last, the final match against Ekaterina Prusakova. The matches were rather easy. David she beat her twice or once?
SPEAKER_01: David you win it twice? Yes, in the preliminary fights and in the final. So you didn't lose. Yes, she won twice. Both matches were tough or it was just only the final? She won first in the preliminary and then in the final.
SPEAKER_01: You said that all the matches were easy, except the final match. So should I understand that the first match was easy as well? Or both matches went well? No.
SPEAKER_04: It was quite difficult in both.
SPEAKER_02: in both matches and it was long and it was recognized as the most spectacular fight among women. So it means that both of these ladies were much above the others, even if their first match was so hard and even when they are tired, they didn't lose to anyone else. So it means that they both were too much for the category. This is what I understand.
SPEAKER_02: uh you were talking we were talking about like you knew her you follow her and and we saw you last year you did great and you pulled 60 kilo and to dimitrina you took second place and this year at the europeans you had a like a great match uh with one of my uh teammates um
SPEAKER_02: And it was, it could go either way. It was 1-1 and the last match went there, go back and at the end, I think you lost on fouls. And so you are, you are in incredible shape. And how do you see your chances against Olga? I think my chances are good.
SPEAKER_00: i haven't seen her competing internationally for the last couple years and i think that is a bit of a disadvantage for for you um why would it be why would it be disadvantage for me i'm an organizer no not for you for olga okay go ahead um i
SPEAKER_00: uh have had like um a good progress uh the last year and i don't see many people uh beat me on right arm i feel pretty confident um i feel like we have kind of the same style probably both have good endurance
SPEAKER_01: It can be a long fight, but I feel like my pronation is good enough to win. Ivan, can you quickly translate that part so she would know what you said? Carolina believes that she is in good shape. She has an advantage in the fact that she has been competing in international competitions. She believes that she is a strong opponent, that you have a similar style.
SPEAKER_01: uh and can you ask her what how does she see her chances and then and also like did he did
SPEAKER_04: How much does he know about Carolina? Have you studied Carolina's fights? Do you know this opponent? I watched the European Championship, now her performance. Of course, a great performance, a strong athlete. I can't exactly assess my chances now. I'm in good shape, I still have time, I'm still gaining.
SPEAKER_04: She watched Europeans. She thinks
SPEAKER_01: Carolina is a good opponent, but it's difficult for her to estimate her level because she didn't pull for some years internationally. And she's still going through. She's working on her form. She's getting better now. So that's it. Is she for sure better shaped than she pulled in Nationals?
SPEAKER_04: How do you think, are you in better shape than you were in Russia? To be honest, last year I fought too many Russian national tournaments, so I didn't prepare for the Russian championship at all, I didn't train for two months.
SPEAKER_04: After the Russian Championship, when I was offered to participate in the East-West, I started training and now I'm in very good shape and I hope that by the end of the month I will be able to reach the peak. She says she didn't train for two months before the Nationals. I don't know why. Why didn't she train?
SPEAKER_01: There were too many tournaments last year and that's why she was too tired and she didn't train at all before nationals for two months. And after nationals, when you offered her this match,
SPEAKER_02: she started to train and now she thinks she's in better form and she's going to peak in a month okay so she will be at the top shape okay and then like still like how does she see her chances like i mean does she have like as high hopes as karuna has
SPEAKER_02: Carolina looks very confident. Carolina, right now, the way that she talks, she's like, you know, like that song, you know, I'm unstoppable, you know, type of, like, whenever she was talking, I was hearing that song, you know. And I think that she wants to, she was last year world champion with left arm, right arm, she's this close, but looks like this is the next goal for her. And about Olga, she didn't sound super confident.
SPEAKER_01: But how confident is she? Engin wants to clarify how confident you are in yourself. Artem you as confident as Carolina, who is already planning to win with the help of the coordinator? Well, in my opinion, well, in general, about the mood, yes, you probably want to hear something else. Maybe it's interesting for the incitement.
SPEAKER_04: Well, actually, before any tournament, I'm never 100% confident in myself. Moreover, I repeat that I haven't competed in international competitions for a long time, so it's hard for me to assess my level of preparation. What else did you ask? Well, actually, he's just interested in your attitude and probably wants to hear something interesting. It's not necessary at all.
SPEAKER_04: Well, tell me that I also watched Carolina's performance, I saw that she also has weak spots, and I actually consider myself not so strong, but a thinking athlete. Therefore, for the most part, for example, if I fight, for example, I have some kind of bruise, and in principle, in 99% of cases I always win, because I always think with my head. And I think more, so to speak, mentally.
SPEAKER_01: she says that she never is 100 confident before her matches and now when she didn't pull for two years it's even more difficult for her to be that confident but on the other hand she knows that she's a thinking athlete she knows how to pull here she
SPEAKER_01: thinks she knows some drawbacks of Carolina and maybe she is working in that field. And also she thinks that if the match stops in 99%, she wins then.
SPEAKER_01: so she thinks that uh yes maybe she has a better endurance in her previous matches when she had long matches she uh mainly won she is a fighter that's what i have seen also but i am too yeah that 99 if the math stops that that is
SPEAKER_02: Confidence. Yeah, there's confidence, yeah. There is Gert, quick. I don't know. Hey Engin, when will we get updates on the matches for the East versus West finalists? I am excited for their matches. My friend, even if there are finalists, the people who are qualified already to come to Istanbul, I don't exactly know who are coming, who are not coming. So we will know soon.
SPEAKER_02: And Carolina, do you agree with her when she said that she's going to win 99% once the match stops?
SPEAKER_00: No, I don't. As I said, I have seen her fights and I know she's a fighter. She has typically quite long matches, but I can do that too. So it suits me well. And I think that I have learned also to... Before I had endurance, the match stopped and I was like, oh, what should I do? But now I feel like I know better how to adjust than I did before.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah right now you are known as like someone who can pull like minutes long with many matches you have had and people know that you can pull forever but like I would understand that if she had such confidence if you were someone who is just a flash spinner but her to have such confidence when you also can pull
SPEAKER_02: minutes long matches that that is interesting so it just it just means that her endurance is also crazy good this maybe it will be an endurance fight but um then you also need the right adjustments so that's where i feel confident yeah okay let's let's um can you also ask her was she expecting to be invited to east versus west
SPEAKER_01: Or it was a surprise?
SPEAKER_04: In fact, in the future, maybe after the summer, I was planning to contact StarZ for my candidacy to participate in this tournament. So, yes, the fact that he came out on the phone now and offered, of course, it was completely unexpected.
SPEAKER_04: It was unexpected, but you were just going to... Well, I wanted after the summer, maybe at the end of autumn, I was thinking of trying to make an agreement after the summer. Yes, it was rather surprising for me.
SPEAKER_01: and she herself wanted to ask maybe for a match to contact you but after summer and it happened that you uh offered her the match earlier so it was a big surprise and did she think that it was too early like was she panicked though i'm not ready yet did she think of saying no let me have a little bit more time or how did she accept the match
SPEAKER_02: Because before the nationals, she didn't have training for two months. Sometimes you don't train. If you train, last year she said competed so many events. And sometimes when you compete and train so hard and you rest two months, it is even sometimes better than competing and training because you recover perfectly and you are ready to start again. Can you ask her how come she accepted this after two months of no training?
SPEAKER_01: What were your thoughts when you were offered a fight? David you think you were ready? Or did you think it was too early? I didn't think I was ready at the time, but I knew I had two months to prepare.
SPEAKER_01: She says that when you offered, she thought she was not ready then, but she knew that she had two months ahead to get ready. So that was the key for her. Carolina, for many, many years,
SPEAKER_02: Russian women generally dominated arm wrestling. I remember, I think it was 2005 Europeans, Russians, Russian ladies won 13 goals out of 14 categories, right and left total. And the one that they didn't win, they took third place. So they won 13
SPEAKER_02: goals in 2014. Of course, it didn't go like that all the time, but usually they were the best. And Sweden was probably the best opponent for Russian ladies in armwrestling. What is your, do you remember your win-loss record against the Russian Bulls? You said 2005, right? Was that?
SPEAKER_00: You said 2005, they won 13. 2005, yeah, 2005. And I started the year after, so probably that's when it turned around. Oh, okay, that's why the things changed. Okay. But I remember my first Europeans, I... 2009. 2008. I think in Bulgaria.
SPEAKER_00: No, Norway. Norway, okay. In junior class, I had a final with a Russian girl. I won one arm, she won the other. I doubled in seniors and I met Tatyana Istomina. Oh, yeah, I remember. The blonde girl, right?
SPEAKER_02: Yes, yes, like short and super fit. And I lost so hard and I was like, I will never be the level that these girls are. But you were still junior, right? You were junior. Yes. You should never count your losses from seniors when you are junior. Just consider the junior. So generally, generally, were you close to them? No. They were better usually? No, no, no.
SPEAKER_00: Yes, yes, yes. Like when I was a junior, but it took some years for me when I became a senior to get to a high level. It took like two years or something. I was like fifth or sixth in the category. I don't remember a lot of Russians in 55 though. Volkov was there all the time. No, 50. Oh, you were 50?
SPEAKER_02: No, no, Volkova was 50. No, Volkova many years competed, 55. Her and Esra Kiraz, they went. Also Dimitrina, Dimitrina. Yeah, that was when I was off. After you stopped? Yes, Volkova was 50.
SPEAKER_00: Your European title was right arm or left arm? Some years ago, your European title was right or left? Left arm, but that was in 60 kilo. And then I had Irina Masurenko. I remember her, yeah. And Lucia Dednarova. So Irina Masurenko, I won against her on the left, but I lost on right. So maybe my track record with Russians aren't that good, actually.
SPEAKER_01: And in this supermatch, you're planning to change a little at least? Yes, of course, yeah. I saw, actually, Olga, you had a supermatch with Milana Baeva. Right? Last year. I'm asking if there was a fight with Milana Baeva. Well, there was, of course. A year or two ago. Olga, right? Yes.
SPEAKER_04: David you fight Milana two years ago? I think time flies fast. I fought Milana in 2021, we had an armfight. I lost to her 3-2, but at that time, it was summer, I didn't train at all.
SPEAKER_01: Before that, I won her at the Russian Championship and at two other Russian tournaments. It was the first time she won me, but then I didn't train at all. Was it in Moscow, Vladimir? Yes, it was in 2021. She lost 3-2 to Milano, but before that she won her at the Nationals and at some
SPEAKER_02: other tournaments several times, and that time she was not ready, she says. But yes, she lost. Do you know her, Engin Milanova? I think I heard her name, but when you compete like 30 something years, like if somebody didn't dominate for many years,
SPEAKER_02: Then I remember so many, so many, so many, like, I mean, I don't remember how many times I listened to Russian national anthem during those years. You know, you too, right? Now we listen in mostly Kazakh national anthems, you know?
SPEAKER_00: But I think that this girl Milana won one time against Ekaterina Larina also. So she's really high level. I think so. The Russians can correct me if I am wrong. But so Olga had good match with Milana. So I know that she is like quality. Okay. So then she's good. Yeah. I think Larina Ekaterina, I think one of the
SPEAKER_01: Legendary puller. Do you agree with that, Ivan? That she was coming in 60 kilos, she was dominating and going. Yes, she was extremely, and she is maybe extremely gifted, I would say. And strong for her category. Yes. Yes. Yes.
SPEAKER_02: Anyway, so what I understand, Carolina is very confident and I can feel that
SPEAKER_02: this match alone is not her target. She is just, she has some bigger goals. I don't know how I understood this, but this is how I feel. And Olga, Olga is happy to be here. And she said in one month, she will be in peak form. And all she needs to do, she thinks that to stop the match and then it's over. And does Olga,
SPEAKER_02: I don't know, how important is it for her to win the title and then put the belt on her? Does she have such a target or she's just focused on only this match? Engin, I'm interested in your task ahead of you. How important is the title, the belt, or do you just want to fight? What's your goal?
SPEAKER_02: One second. Guys, it would be more respectful if you would focus their armwrestling abilities. I think that because they are here and that is the reason that they are here. I think that that would be better, you know. It would be better if you don't make it like a dating chat room or something, you know. Yeah, sorry about that. Go ahead.
SPEAKER_01: But again, the attitude or the task you have in front of you. What is important for you in this fight? The fight itself or maybe the title?
SPEAKER_04: Well, first of all, of course, I am happy to finally take part in the international tournament, to fight a strong opponent. For me, in fact, the fight is more important. I always cheer more for a beautiful fight. I don't know if I can win, but I know for sure that I can 100% show a beautiful fight.
SPEAKER_01: Most important for her is to give a good fight. Also, she is very glad to pull internationally after some time of absence. And the most important for her is to give a good match. And she is sure that she is able to show some spectacular fight.
SPEAKER_02: okay okay okay just you know what now it's like 100 confidence she is sure that she is gonna show a spectacular fight it means that she won't get flash pin that's what it means and she also said that this is 99 the match stops she wins so she's coming here with full confidence of winning can you tell her please um
SPEAKER_01: you will show a beautiful fight with a high probability. And at the same time, you said that in 99% of cases, if the match stops, then you win. This means that you have almost 100% confidence in the fight. But as a result. Because he believes that a beautiful fight is long-term. That is, if someone is clearly stronger, then there will be no beautiful fight. Well, here he is.
SPEAKER_04: Does it make sense, Olga? Does it make sense, Olga? Does it make sense, Olga? Does it make sense, Olga? Does it make sense, Olga? Does it make sense, Olga? Does it make sense, Olga? Does it make sense, Olga? Does it make sense, Olga? Does it make sense, Olga? Does it make sense, Olga? Does it make sense, Olga? Does it make sense, Olga? Does it make sense, Olga? Does it make sense, Olga? Does it make sense, Olga? Does it make sense, Olga? Does it make sense, Olga? Does it make sense, Olga? Does it make sense, Olga? Does it make sense, Olga? Does it make sense, Olga? Does it make sense, Olga? Does it make sense, Olga? Does it make sense, Olga? Does it make sense, Olga? Does it make sense, Olga? Does it make sense, Olga? Does it make sense, Olga? Does it make sense, Olga? Does it make sense, Olga? Does it make sense, Olga?
SPEAKER_01: There is something true about your thoughts, but still she cannot say that she will win for sure. Yes, she doesn't say she will, only 99%. The table will show, yes, and that's it. David you feel the same thing, Carolina, if you just really bring everything together from her words?
SPEAKER_00: yeah at the beginning she doesn't sound she didn't sound so confident but whenever you bring all everything she said together like okay understand the conclusions that you made out of it um so probably she is or maybe she's more confident than she wants to spill out I don't know
SPEAKER_02: But she already said it. She said she's sure that she's going to give you a good match. And she also said that if the match stops, 99% she's going to win. So she's giving you a good match means it's a good match. And then 99%, she's saying that basically 99% she's going to beat you. Okay. That is very good. I am happy to hear that. It makes me more...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, that's good. I like when the athletes are confident. I don't like like Ivan Matushenko. I don't like when they are like, we will see. I will do my best. I'm joking. I'm joking, Ivan. I'm working on myself, but it's difficult. It's difficult. Don't never change, my friend. Never change. Be yourself because we love you. We love you as you are.
SPEAKER_02: and just don't change no no need to be fake and just definitely it's not part of you i know you for like 20 years you are this person and we respect you as you are humble is also good what's that being humble it's also yeah yeah yeah yeah don't don't be like carolina just stay the same way uh you want i'm joking yeah anyway so this is gonna be a good match so i understand um
SPEAKER_02: and we will see these two ladies there will be two other matches for ladies uh they are also incredible we have like 60 kilo this is very high level match and we also have the world title karuna do you think that ayana versus dimitrina deserves that the world title match um
SPEAKER_00: dimitrina 100 deserves it i think ayana is one of the top contenders so i think it's a good world title match i we have a reference like for both girls in uh
SPEAKER_00: You know, they have both beat her on top roll. I think it was a bit easier for Ayane. Like, Dimitrina had a final against her, like, last Europeans, and it took her a bit of time, but it was still, like, quite convincingly. Both did it convincingly. So, yeah, it...
SPEAKER_00: For me, it's super exciting. Okay, let's start from there. Since we started talking about that, how do you see that match going? I think that Dimitrina is one of the best pullers on right arm under 70 kilos.
SPEAKER_00: i think there are not under 70 kilos yes yes that's that's my opinion um do you think that if she wins do you think that if she wins this this match do you think that we should even offer her at some point the 70 kilo title match i think she had one win against fia at the wl uh yeah that was a long time ago but i think that like dimitrina was also 50 pulling in 55 at that time
SPEAKER_00: yeah and she probably she was she was around 60 kilo and probably pia was around 65 maybe yeah but i think that she could be a top contender also in the 70 kilo category that is my opinion but also uh she beat me and everything so i might be a bit biased because i see her as one of the absolute i mean she's very strong she's very strong no i mean it's proven you know
SPEAKER_02: I mean, it's not that you're biased or something. Whatever you say is correct, yeah. And you think that, do you think that, okay, whenever I talk with Krasimir, Krasimir said that they are planning for a fast win because if Ayane gets her position, it will be difficult. Do you agree with that? I think that Ayane could beat her in top role.
SPEAKER_00: uh i don't think ayan is super strong you know she does like one arm pull-ups at 59 kilos i never i never seen any any woman doing that before never me neither she does them like from straight arm and then just up like this with 59 kilos by the way uh it's incredible uh but i still think that dimitrina's like that deep hook that she does is
SPEAKER_02: like but this is incredible match incredible so they both are very special human beings the imaginer looks very calm you see her on the street you wouldn't really think that she's that strong yeah i mean you can think that yeah yeah and then but she's just and also no emotions zero emotions like you could see her when she's arm wrestling
SPEAKER_02: The same emotion you could see when she is watching news or something, you know. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I agree. Ivan is the same way. Ivan is almost the same, you know. Okay. Ivan also doesn't show. I don't remember Ivan going like, ah, you know. Ivan, have you been like this? I don't remember, but... They are both special. Yeah, you look like you play chess or something, you know, like
SPEAKER_02: like you never stop thinking you know during the match you know you you don't lose the control oh yes something something like that yeah and can you ask olga what does he think about uh ayana versus dimitrina a world title match 60 kilo uh
SPEAKER_04: I think Dimitrina will win 90% of the games.
SPEAKER_04: In my opinion, she is in great shape in recent years. I fought with her in the same weight class since 2018. We fought in 1955. Since 2018, I have never seen her lose. And I will say more about the last European Championships. I am now training with Irina Glatka. We talked with her about Dimitrina, her form, her training.
SPEAKER_04: We agreed with Irina that Dimitrina isn't even 60 years old. That Dimitrina is an equal opponent for Irina. She admitted it. That's why I think it will be a victory for Dimitrina.
SPEAKER_01: She pulled Dimitrina for several years. She never saw her losses. Now she is training with Irina Glatka and they both estimate Dimitrina as the best puller under 60 kilograms.
SPEAKER_01: And Irina thinks that she will be a good opponent for her as well. So even with a big weight. So you are saying Irina Gladkaya vs Dimitrina would be a good match they are thinking? Irina thinks that she will be a good match. She is of that level.
SPEAKER_02: Can you ask her how does Galatkaya feel now? We had a supermatch for her and then she cancelled, but is she ready now? Last time she was ready, but she said she was going to compete in the national championships. And how is she doing right now? I'm asking about Irina. How is she doing now? Because he proposed to her. There was already an agreement. Irina, I don't know why,
SPEAKER_04: She couldn't accept happiness, and now... I know, right? I said that she wanted to fight for Russia. No, Irina had some problems, of course I can't talk about them. But now everything is fine, she is in good shape, she performed at the Russian Championship, won the left and right hand.
SPEAKER_04: That's why Ira is in full combat readiness, in excellent form, she is incredibly strong, just incredibly strong. If anyone doesn't know, recently we had a tournament, yes, the World Cup.
SPEAKER_04: She took part in the absolute weight category, where she won our, well, she won with her left hand, on the right she became the fourth, but she didn't want to wear out, that is, in the preliminary fights she won. We have Laletin, the one who took the first place in the absolute weight category at the Russian championship, she won them all. Russian champion in the plus category with a weight of 63 kilograms.
SPEAKER_01: She says that Irina is in great form right now. She had some problems when you offered her that match.
SPEAKER_01: But now she is good. She won nationals and not long ago there was a tournament where Vyvoda organized something. And there she won open category left hand and won the champions overall of women's plus category. So she is in good shape now.
SPEAKER_02: okay i think that i think that it would be good if we see fear versus latkaya 70 kilo october east versus west 15. it would be a good one here i think uh people people fans you know fans are saying that we want to see one matushenko to behave like mad mask in next match it will be too expensive oh it's impossible but i have to
SPEAKER_02: to train through some classes, yes, to learn how. I don't think there is any class in the world that can teach you how to behave like mask. I don't think so. OK. Let's go to the matches. And quickly, we do the predictions. And then quickly, just one second, let me. OK.
SPEAKER_02: let's start with just directly score prediction between carolina patterson and olga terpelova best of five the one who wins three rounds is winning okay karuna what's the score um it is a free zero or maybe free one to me okay and you want to
SPEAKER_01: What do you think the score will be in your fight? Carolina suggested 3-1 or 3-0 in her favor. And how many fights? Five? Isn't it five? Five fights, more precisely, maybe five fights in total, but up to three wins. Up to three wins. That is, maybe three fights. Adam, I don't even know. Well, let it be 3-2.
SPEAKER_02: Let it be 3-2 in her favor, she says. In Olga's favor, yes. Okay, 3-2. Okay, so in two of those rounds, the 1% will happen, looks like. And even one time in the air, while we're sitting, we hold with you, and you told me that
SPEAKER_01: If you ever would pull me, you would top roll me or something, go outside. Were you serious about that? Do you remember or not? Yes. Your pronation is really good. Yes, perhaps because of weight difference and level difference, I will manage to hook or just to go outside with you. But I think...
SPEAKER_01: It would be more comfortable to go top role, yes. And are you thinking about a super match with me? No, no, no. Now you're 50% ready. Yeah, even if I'm 100% I wouldn't move with you, no.
SPEAKER_01: But I remember you were saying some good things about my pronation. I remember. It was very difficult, yes, to call. I seldom feel that pronation power. Yeah. Artem Taranenko, Thomas Roses. Does Olga know these athletes? Artem Taranenko and Holland.
SPEAKER_02: Tom's Roses. Tom's Roses. Latvia. He had a match with Oleg Zok in the last European. He won Oleg Zok in preliminary. One match, yeah. But this is a left-hand match, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: The one on the left means that Lithuanian will win. Or is he Lithuanian? I think so. Latvia. Latvia, right? Yeah, she thinks that guy will win. And what do you think, Carolina? Carolina is close friends with Latvians, so I don't think she will say different, but... I am pretty sure that Tom will win.
SPEAKER_00: is it is it is it is it objective opinion i think so because i just think his top role is too much for art and martin has this like kind of um special style he opens up very widely i can't see him but he can still he can still pull like this very interesting way i just think that tom's top role is too much for him okay
SPEAKER_02: Okay, Adam Wojcicki, Vladimir Maiorov. Does Olga know them? Vladimir Maiorov. Vladimir Maiorov. Do you know the other one? Adam Wojcicki. He beat Artur Makarov last year at East vs. West. Artur lost to Artur Makarov. He beat Artur Makarov.
SPEAKER_01: David he win Makarov? Last year. He won Makarov, right? Yeah, but the guy was 85, Makarov was 75. Yes, I remember that, yes. And before that, he won Bozhidar. Yeah, he also beat Bozhidar. He lost to Lacho, but now he's in 85 kilos, yeah. Who will win? Ah, you already said, Vladimir Maiorov.
SPEAKER_00: She doesn't know Adam. She votes for Vladimir. Okay. And you, Carolina? I think you know both athletes. Yeah. I haven't seen like Maiorov before, but... You saw Maiorov, right? You saw Samushia match. Yes, exactly. And I think that Adam should not be like underestimated, but I give it to Maiorov like 60-40 or something.
SPEAKER_04: Okay. And let's go to the next one. Zurab Tavberidze vs. Petro Makharidze. Artem you asking me? Yes, yes, yes. First you, then Zurab and then Tavberidze. I would put it on Zurab Tavberidze, but I don't know how much his hand healed after the fracture. If everything healed, then it's good for him, yes.
SPEAKER_01: She would bet on Zurab, but she is not sure that he is good after his injury, that he is back with his good form. But if he is in his best form, then she would bet for him. Okay. And you, Carolina? Marharint, who did he pull before? Petro Marharint, in fact, before the pandemic.
SPEAKER_02: um he didn't beat so strong guys he beat like ravaz lutize he beat like sandra said this he beat like kiddergali hongar where he beat like georgie de serrano you know jumbo zinc you know not not really okay and but lately lately he beat he beat uh uh nuzgari you know the georgian guy you remember georgian guy or not you know
SPEAKER_00: i'm not sure i recognize the name but i'm not okay he's a little bit hyperactive you know just like uh fired up guy okay but based on these names i i think that maharit will take this one i know surabhi is really strong but it's like a good match okay let's go to the next one chance show ibrahim sago
SPEAKER_04: Ibragim Saghav. Ibragim Saghav? Yes. But does he know Chance Shaw? Shaw? Have you seen him? Do you know Chance Shaw? Well, who will he fight, Ibragim Saghav? Have you seen his opponent? I don't know. But I'm sure in Ibragim Saghav. He is very strong. I believe that he can win.
SPEAKER_02: Not that familiar, but... Yeah, he beat Zurab. The guy that he just favored against Petro Marharint. Chance beat that guy. He beat Zurab. Chance what? Zurab beat him. I don't remember who else he beat. She still votes for... Okay, okay. Whenever I say this kind of thing, I'm not trying to change anybody's mind. I'm just trying to give idea because she doesn't know who he is, so...
SPEAKER_00: And what do you think, Carolina? I also think Ibragim Sagov. Chance didn't have a lot of luck lately with his super matches, is what I reckon. And Sagov beat Sandris, right? Yeah. Yeah. I know he had some issues also, Sandris, but I would go for Sagov.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, Sagov also gave a good match to Tatashins. I mean, Tadwon, but the rounds were not that easy. And Artem Taynov, Betkili Oniani. Artem Taynov is 100%. He is incredibly strong now, on his left hand. And I believe that Artem Taynov will have the outcome of the fight this time, just like the last time when he fought Raba Tavberidze.
SPEAKER_01: 100% Artem Taynov. He's in great form. And it will be something like he pulled against Zurab, left hand. Okay. And you? You saw the last match, the Betkili pull against Akhtar. Yes. And like my job. Were you surprised? Yes. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: I knew him from before, but I thought that he was lighter weight. Yeah, he was 75 kilos in the past. And then he went up to 80. And after the pandemic, we all gained some weight, you know. So I was pretty sure that Talget Akhtar would beat him. And he had no chance, what it looked like to us. So that was the best match for me at that event because it was just so surprising.
SPEAKER_00: yeah and i i just hope that he can do that again against the final not not the exact same thing of course but that he can surprise us you know and uh show really good arm wrestling so i will go um ivan i don't remember your prediction about this match but did you give any chance to bet killing because tino is your countryman i didn't give any predictions for this uh for this event
SPEAKER_01: oh we didn't talk about it oh really okay so you are my guest next time i think that bitkili is a very dangerous opponent and he is extremely strong in a hook position and side and it will be difficult for him uh i see that artem can uh top rope him and uh he is faster
SPEAKER_02: But if they get into something like hook position, here I would give more chance to Betkili. So you are changing Betkili. If the match is balanced, he may have better endurance? Yes. Okay. Let's go to the next one. Also incredible one. Daniel Prokopchuk, Bozhidar Simeonov. Left arm, 77kg world title match.
SPEAKER_02: Daniel Prokopchuk. Daniel Prokopchuk. Again, I'm not trying to change her mind, but does she know that last year Bozhidar beat Daniel left-handed to all combat games? Last year, on the left-hand side, Bozhidar won. Bozhidar won.
SPEAKER_04: This is just for reference. Engin teaches us. I got it. But now we all saw how easy it is. How did I forget his name? Moldovan. Daniel won against our undefeated Alan Zaloev, especially in the fight on the left hand, which is not his main. I think he is in great shape now and therefore will be able to win.
SPEAKER_01: uh still she thinks that uh daniel is in great form now especially uh considering his uh matches uh previous yeah with uh alan and uh and other okay carolina uh bushidar is he uh dropping white for this match he is he's walking around 78 79 you know we know that we changed the categories we had a 60 kilo woman
SPEAKER_02: And then we also had 70 kilo men, but we made it like 70, 77, 85, and then the same 95, 105. So this is 77 kilo category and Bozhidar is around 78, 79. But when they pull in Saudi Arabia, they both were 80 kilo. Okay. Still like...
SPEAKER_00: after daniel's match with alan but that was right arm um he seems to be in like a great um shape is is daniel uh left dominant also daniel i think he has like five world titles with left arm
SPEAKER_02: four or five, and then only has one world title with right. But I cannot say that his right is weaker than his left. Right is more versatile. He can go this, this, this. But usually right arm competition is also a bit tougher than left arm competition. Just my opinion, yeah. I think that it is like 50-50, this much.
SPEAKER_02: 50-50. Okay. David you guys know, Ivan, did you know that Bozhidar even has a win against Krasimir with left arm in a competition? No. Yeah. And I have seen Daniel Prokopchuk beating Clement Dimitrov in a competition. So these guys are very, very dangerous guys, you know. Very, very strong guys, yeah. And let's go to the next one.
SPEAKER_02: Travis Belgian, Serhii Kalinichenko. Let's start with you, Carolina. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: I would love to see Travis win, but I don't know if he's ready. He hasn't been focusing on arm wrestling and jumping into East vs. West, quite high-quality match. I'm not sure if he's ready yet, so I might give the advantage to Sergey. Okay, so you don't know if he's in good shape?
SPEAKER_01: Or not. Ok, can you ask also Olga? Sergei Kalinichenko, Travis Bagent. Right hand. Who is that? Travis Bagent. Do you remember him? American? He was good in the 2000s. He was good in the 2000s. He was good in the 2000s. He was good in the 2000s. He was good in the 2000s.
SPEAKER_01: She doesn't know this sportsman well, so... Okay.
SPEAKER_00: And let's go to the next one. What do you think about this match? I think that Egle will win. Like, after her match against Sarah, it was so convincingly. She looks like she is in her best shape ever. Sometimes she puts some training videos up also. She's really strong. Barbora is...
SPEAKER_02: I like her, she's very charismatic and she's probably second or third best, but I do think that Egle is too much for her. Wow, too much. But doesn't Barbora's win against Gabriela mean anything? Because just remember that match was a year ago and Barbora is very young.
SPEAKER_00: i know i know that's the thing because uh barbara win against the uh gabby sarah was quite close to gabby still even though it was like three zero or something no no but that match was at 80 kilo category when when barbara beat gabriella gabriella was minimum 95 kilo
SPEAKER_02: Okay, that's true. But still, like Egle, what she told us before facing Sarah, what was that she trained? She has been the most focused in her life. I love that. I love that. I love that. Yeah. Because I think when those great, great athletes who could still be number one and they just retire because they don't have anything exciting for them.
SPEAKER_02: And many people don't understand how exciting this competition is. It doesn't matter if it's, it's worse or it's not, but we, to be together, it's never happened before. Now I am time to time tempting. Time to time I'm sending her message. I say, Hey, how are you doing? You know? And that like first three, four messages, she was like, absolutely no. She's like, maybe, maybe someday the last I get from her was like, maybe someday. And many people doesn't know who.
SPEAKER_02: Irina Makeeva is, Irina Makeeva, I would say that the most successful, most dominant female armwrestler ever in the history. I don't know. Would you agree with that, Ivan? I think that she has more titles than anyone else. Yeah. And before that, there was a woman in Ossetia also. Great. Gabakova?
SPEAKER_01: yes i think she she passed she did recently i'm not sure um let's go to do oh we didn't ask okay you go olga i'm sorry
SPEAKER_04: Barbora or Igla? Igla. I think that if Igla is in the best shape for these competitions, then Igla will win, maybe even 3-0. She gives 3-0 to Igla if she's in good shape.
SPEAKER_02: wow see many people that i know has the potential and i wouldn't be so sure because barbara also beat gabriella and she's young and she's just improving probably faster than any of these other uh real top ladies like uh like sarah gabriella egle i think barbara is improving faster because of her age and
SPEAKER_02: But a lot of people, they are thinking that Barbora would win because she is bigger. And whenever I ask this to the ladies and when they are confident against Egle, so I hope that they are listening, all those people, that how strong Egle is. Were you surprised, Ivan, when you saw the way that Egle beat Sara? I mean, winning is something, but the way that winning,
SPEAKER_02: like even just going inside and waiting there and doing this. I mean, because Egle is not known as a hook puller. Right, Carolina? Yes. Actually, I knew that Egle was much more experienced, maybe. For sure. More witnesses. For sure, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Anyway, so let's go to the next one. Todd Hutchings versus Krasimir Kostadinov. Krasimir Kostadinov. Kostadinov. Okay. Yeah, she said, I think Kostadinov is going to win. Kostadinov, yes. Okay. And Carolina?
SPEAKER_00: um i think it will be quite close like the one who gets to their position might win this one um but um i think yeah i think 50 50. sorry to say 50 50. okay evgeny prudnik iraq is rakashvili evgeny prudnik
SPEAKER_00: I would give the win to Prudnik as well. I think like Irakli, I don't know how old he is. He's quite young, right?
SPEAKER_02: I can tell you he's at least 26. Because in 2018, six years ago, he was a good category. Just say he was 20, 21. So he's either 26, 27 right now, in my opinion. And he has gained some weight also, right? Yeah. Through the years. So I think he's doing a lot of progression.
SPEAKER_02: But I think Prudnik is a bit ahead of him as of now. Okay. I'm not going to ask you, Ivan. You will be my guest especially. While you're translating, I cannot get enough from you. There is a super chat. Sean Troutzer. If Olga has the endurance she claims, this could be the female match of the year.
SPEAKER_02: Carolina has no quid in her. My money is on Carolina. So there is a sport for you. Yes. Yeah. Thank you. OK. Then let's go for the next one. David Dadikyan Oleg Petro. Dadikyan. Dadikyan. OK.
SPEAKER_00: uh carolina uh i think petrenko like yeah i was you watched the last match last time yes were you surprised were you surprised yes i was but i don't think i have seen petrenko that much either like uh i haven't been watching him uh i think i have been watching like on your bio before and for therefore there was a bias like
SPEAKER_02: he would take this but uh oleg did really good and i think that he could continue his strike so you are saying oleg is gonna win and olga is saying uh david is gonna win okay let's go to david samusha sasha andrew okay i believe so too um
SPEAKER_02: He seems to be really good, so I think it will be a hard task for Samushia. Okay. Listen, I have to ask you this one, Ivan. What do you think about this match? When Sasho is losing weight down? That may be a very important factor.
SPEAKER_02: One thing I want to add before you say. Many people, I think there was a wrong information when Sasho beat John. It was written there like 88 kilos. We weighed him. He was 95 kilos when he pulled against John. So he was not 88 kilos. This time he will be much lower weight against Samushia. Okay, go ahead. And I'm sure that he will not be that strong when he goes to 85 kilos.
SPEAKER_01: and in this case it may be an equal weight and even maybe a little more chances for uh david but without weight uh cut uh yes would be the favorite yes but uh 10 kilograms is too much even five kilograms is a lot yeah he was at the europeans 90 kilo so so anyway so
SPEAKER_02: Let's go to the last one. Artyom Morozov versus Vitalii Laletin. Olga is going to say Vitalii because he's from Russia. Yes, Vitalii is in. OK, can you ask Olga, does she think that anyone from Russia would lose a supermatch? Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Okay. And Carolina, how do you see this match? Morozov versus Laletin? I will go for Morozov. You go with Morozov. Ivan, have you been following the back and forth between Laletin and
SPEAKER_02: Morozov started with pronation and then Laletin said, I would go inside hook with you. And then I asked Morozov, would you try to do this against Laletin? He said, only if I have stomach problems. If I don't have stomach problems, I don't do that. And he said, he's going to hook him. And then lately he said he doesn't know pronator, he trains pronator like a girl.
SPEAKER_02: And then Morozov put those videos, the girls are training the same way that Laletin is training. And then he said that, like, you think the pronation is important, but the general power is very important. And then today he said, like, don't worry about my general power. Just worry about your wrist because it will suffer. So I like that. I like that. It's very healthy, very friendly, Benzer. And what do you think about this match?
SPEAKER_01: I think it will be very difficult for Morozov. And really he needs to think about his wrist a lot. I cannot see him getting into hook. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe Morozov is another level now. But I think that it's very difficult to hook Vitalii.
SPEAKER_02: You did twice. You did twice. It was not that Vitalii. It was... Yeah, but this Morozov also maybe was a bit stronger than the Ivan who hooked Vitalii. Maybe yes, maybe no. Yes, maybe. I'm not sure about the wrist. For sure, Morozov...
SPEAKER_01: He's stronger in other aspects, but I'm not sure about the wrist. Because I saw also Morozov losing his wrist several times. It's not his advantage. But on the other hand, Vitalii has some problems.
SPEAKER_01: With side pressure. And Morozov has good endurance and he can also stop him somewhere. So it's a good match. So you are saying who is winning? Vitalii? I vote for Vitalii. But Morozov can give him a fight. Does he also have a chance to win? Or not at all, in your opinion? Yes, he has chances.
SPEAKER_01: If you were Morozov's trainer, where would you tell him to attack? Vitalii Ovrady, I think, made some stories about that, that Morozov has to think about floor press. Okay, so this is what you're thinking?
SPEAKER_02: Obviously, that's the way how Vitalii lost in his previous matches. Yeah, but whenever Dave Sheffield beat him, Dave Sheffield at the beginning, he pulled outside and then, you know, then later he went inside, yeah. Anyway, so do you think that the winner of this match, like if Morozov just say wins or if Vitalii wins or whatever, you know?
SPEAKER_02: Do you think they deserve a title match or they need to win some other matches as well? One or two more matches? Artem there any people left? Burdecha, Jerry, Hermes. Oh, Hermes. Once again, I think the winner will have to face Hermes. Okay, so what you are saying, but do you think that
SPEAKER_02: Kurdeca now beat Swetko. Do you think that if Kurdeca also beat Jerry, do you think that winner or if Jerry beats him, do they deserve the title match? Jerry also has win against Swetko and Gennady. He lost to Hermes, but he said that he was ill and also Hermes pulled him in a very correct way. Do you think that
SPEAKER_02: Like which match do you think they would deserve, you know, the title match, the winner? As for me, I would put them all. So they have to pull with each other. Okay, so you are saying the winner of Vitalii Morozov and winner of Jerry Kurdecha also need to pull against each other or they need to pull against Hermes? How do you see this? Because just remember one thing.
SPEAKER_02: The American event will be in August. And then in December, early December, Levan is waiting for an opponent. So they cannot pull so many matches in between. Levan needs to pull someone. Because Kurdica, maybe he pulled only once at the organization. So he deserves less of the title match.
SPEAKER_02: only because of that. Yeah, but he beat Swetko and then Jerry is right now, I think, number four. So if he also beats, after he beat Swetko, if he also beats number four, then the only people above him would be Hermes and Devon. And Devon is not there anymore. So only Hermes is left.
SPEAKER_02: So they have to pull some call. The winner against the winner. We will see. In my opinion, I think the winner of the American event, Jerry versus Kurdeca, I think the winner of that match should pull Levan. And then I think the winner of La Lettine and Morozov should pull Hermes. And the winner of that match, beginning of the next year, should pull against Levan.
SPEAKER_02: Just my opinion, yeah. But we will see. If there was some rating, maybe it would be easier. There is some rating, yes, but it is not true. Yes, it is not true. Yeah. You know. What do you think about the other argument that Levan, if Levan comes back, does he deserve direct title shot? Probably you said no, right? I think you voted no.
SPEAKER_01: My opinion is that there should be a road to the title. So the person should not get immediately. I think that it would be, how to say, in future it will be maybe better. I understand that in the situation you have now, it is difficult to organize that road.
SPEAKER_02: uh through region but later uh maybe uh no no later yes yes he would go he would go uh several steps to the yeah yeah like like listen if you are ufc there are athletes that just knew just join in the new athletes just they need to build their weight
SPEAKER_02: but east versus west is only like two two and a half years old very new and levan has a past this is not a new athlete just growing or something the guy is already there he's just started to pull in here like just think that fedor just if he would come to the ufc when he was the champion on other organization right or whatever it was and then he would probably pull the direct
SPEAKER_02: title match but yeah he has been inactive as well you know anyways so we will see but i think that the first match of the left arm in super heavyweight category should be laletin versus morozov and i think the next match for alijan it would it should be 115 kilo world title against against against ivan matushenko ivan started to smile already he knows of course what's coming
SPEAKER_02: After this match, I was thinking Ali Can was the heavy favorite against you. After I saw you with Morozov, now I see very, very good match. I think it will be a good match. Yeah. Maybe harmful for our elbows. Yeah, but that is the nature of the sport we have. Artem wrestling, you'll be hard on the elbow. There is no easy success. You need to feel the pain. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: let's see anyways so carolina do you have a message to your fans and to olga anything you want to add uh before we finish it is we will be seeing you ladies in a bit more than three weeks yeah no just um we keep training hard and um
SPEAKER_00: Carolina says that she is looking forward to a fight with you. She offers everyone to buy a broadcast. There will be great fights.
SPEAKER_04: Well, she will be happy to fight with you. Engin, I ask, what is the last thing, if suddenly there is something to say? Probably Olga will also ask. I, in principle, want to say the same thing. I will be very glad to meet in a fight with Carolina. I hope that we will show a beautiful fight with her. And see you in Istanbul.
SPEAKER_01: She wants to say almost the same. She's looking forward to the match. She's excited to have this match. She hopes it will be a spectacular match and see you all in Istanbul. Yeah. And last thing.
SPEAKER_02: Ertuğrul Çimen- Evgeny what do you think about the level of the event like our tomorrow's or we tell you that it in the with some of your social data, they can let Petro have been approved in Iraq is records really. Ertuğrul Çimen- Hutchings cross me posted you know barbara but you're a good way to take the rest of agents that you can you can go Daniel broke up to go to Darcy Meno. Ertuğrul Çimen- Our 10th I know, but you're only on it, you mentioned a petro Ionica can occur.
SPEAKER_01: What do you think about the level? Is it a good card as before? In terms of sports, it's great. As usual, even maybe even more great matches than usual. But it's difficult to estimate. No, no, I'm asking just your opinion.
SPEAKER_01: Like, would you enjoy watching? Yes, I would enjoy, I think, all the matches. 95% of the matches are very interesting to me in terms of sport. And also the girls' arm fights as well. Usually, I was not a fan of women. I'm risen, but now I'm becoming.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, we're coming. It's good. It's good. Yeah. Anyway, so thank you very much, Ivan, for the translation and your opinions. And Olga, thank you very much for joining. Carolina, thank you very much. And see you in three and a half weeks. Thank you. Thank you. Bye-bye. Thank you. Goodbye.
