SPEAKER_03: So everyone who's joining us now, I'm Coach Ray. I'm here with Tuomas Rozic, Artem Taranenko. We're going to talk their up and coming left arm. What is the class? Is it middleweight or welterweight? I don't even know. It's welterweight class, 85 kilos. Left arm supermatch. Let's start with the elephant in the room, Artem.
SPEAKER_00: How do you feel about the match? Why did you pick Tuomas as your opponent? Because, you know, you asked for this match. You said, like, take him. Hey, no, no. Hey, hey. I don't even know how far to start. I remember talking to Engen and just picking up whatever opponent, right? And what I was trying to arm wrestle...
SPEAKER_00: i was really trying to push for the east versus west 12 right and that was supposed to be like a title card and all that i'm like well i mean i mean if if i have to be there just give me the title you're like oh yeah that would be all like oh yeah uh i guess my connection got lost that second so then i'm like all right whatever and
SPEAKER_00: You know, he was like, yes, whatever, the card is busy. And then he's like, a couple of weeks later, hey, you want to pull Tom? European champion 2023? I'm like, oh, is he? Okay. Yeah, sure, let's go. And then, like, a couple of weeks after, Tom beat Oleg. I'm like, oh, well, it's, my request still works out. So it's all good. So, no, I didn't ask for Tom, like, necessarily, but, you know, it's whatever. I guess, like, Engin's like,
SPEAKER_00: Let's go crazy with the left hand. So... Yeah. David you know about him before you picked him for a match? Like, did you realize how high level? No, no, no. So, you know what? I think I knew. I knew, but then when he said that... Because Engen put it like Tom Trotzitz...
SPEAKER_00: eac whatever 20 23 champion and i'm like oh ward let me go look at the video and then i looked at the video and i'm like oh kiss max everybody that just been up there like a couple of stages before i'm like do people not know about this do i need to talk no i no no problem so
SPEAKER_00: no so i kind of knew but then i kind of realized oh yeah that's uh yeah that's that's gonna be that's gonna be good so i mean yeah i was kind of aware but like i feel like i was more aware than the rest of the people because now i feel like everybody knows what thomas is after the oleg thing right yeah like i was i i was not impressed i was almost not impressed with the oleg thing because what i saw before i was like i mean like you know i mean i kind of kind of already seen that every i feel like a lot more people learned
SPEAKER_00: i already knew i already knew i'm in troubles uh before that so how much do you know about your opponent artem sorry alexander it's alexander yeah
SPEAKER_01: well basically after after ranking offer me to me this much i checked some videos in the youtube and that's basically uh what i know about him so i heard that's all i checked for 10 minutes okay i accept this that's basically all yeah yeah yeah just to be clear i checked after i accept it
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I did the same. He offered me. I thought, okay, who is Artem? I don't care. Okay, yeah. Let's go for it. That's all. And then I checked. Okay, this is Artem. Okay, I've seen him somewhere in YouTube and so on. Well, listen, Artem, we are a little worried because your left hasn't been looking as great. I would say somehow it was better maybe two years ago or a year ago, and now that wrist is...
SPEAKER_00: what's that the qualifier no no no so you know what i'm like in the greatest shape of my life with like a very terrible few days in there like literally before the i mean qualifier is a great example of that too because like i was
SPEAKER_00: probably in a great shape, like, you know, like, literally, I don't know, three, four days prior to that, then a whole bunch of traveling happened and all that, and then, like, I've had, like, some really bad days, but I've had, like, my occasional checks with, like, people, so I know, like, overall, like, I'm definitely a lot better than I was, especially, and, I mean, you said about the hand, like, the hand is always a problem in the left hand, but it got a lot better, like, now that I got to, like, compete properly a couple of times, like, it definitely got
SPEAKER_00: a lot better and like especially like level wise like what i was not able to do like two years ago because like i always like can rms like with worley and carl stanley here and there over here like and they like my checkups and like i do a lot better with them like nowadays and like two years ago so it was better yeah like that and the qualifier was bad because i will never lose to ollie and i did that that day but like that was like i'm like ah i mean that was bad
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, because I looked at it, and almost all the matches, you lost your wrist, and you have to fight for it. And I thought, like... You know how it is. Like, I felt like the same day, like, at Arizona State. Like, when me and you had the Supermatch the day, like, when everybody's taking my wrist right away, I'm like, oh, man, it's a long day. So, and I felt just like that pulling Ryan.
SPEAKER_00: like, pulling around a bone, like, where the first, you can see, like, it goes sloppy right away, even with, like, Ms. Martyr, like, it's, like, it's in the first match, and then, like, after that, like, it's all just, like, shit. So, I don't know how it happened. I feel like it's been living in America for 11 years, because I remember back in the days,
SPEAKER_00: i will go like with two three dudes to the tournament and i'll be the youngest one not speaking english i'll be sleeping on the floor with no food and nothing and i'll be the only person winning right now if i ain't got like full eight hours of sleep and i've drank water day before or whatever and got five feet i sneezed that morning i'm like oh man it's gonna be a long day for me today so yeah i mean yeah i know like so yeah i know like it will look sketchy especially for the east versus west qualifier but um
SPEAKER_00: And especially right now, too late. I also, like, got sick, like, not long ago. But I figure by the time we are in Turkey, especially I'm getting there, like, early enough. Because I feel like my overall shape, like, I'm excited about the match in general. Because I think I'll be right there. But overall, I'm like, ah, fuck. It can be a little bit better with everything going on. So, like, being busy and health and all that. But it should be good. You'll like it.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, okay, okay. You convinced me, you convinced me. I feel like it.
SPEAKER_03: i was looking and i i know your wrist a lot of times goes away and then you do that second surge and that's where the money is right but uh i was kind of worried i was like because because you know like you know to him strength is just taking that hand right he's uh have you uh did you have a talk with some of the guys that he just pulled in arizona did you have some guy talk with those guys have maybe that's some some info no nothing you stayed away from that
SPEAKER_00: i didn't ask nobody i've gotten i'll probably be honest i probably got like at least eight to ten messages and they were all coming in like like day after and like probably all the way until like last week right so how long maybe two weeks i've been getting probably a message a day and they all were
SPEAKER_00: I think if and I mean by the average by right now they got to be 50 50 right but they're like hey man thumbs that was good but you're gonna look that great man and they're like yo man that's the like a beast man you better be careful and they're like oh man well so like there was so I mean it's all like it's all the same you can't really deny like the result right but people's emotions were like very mixed and I'm like
SPEAKER_00: that's why that's why that's why i didn't ask because i know i'm going to hear some dumb i'm like yo guys i know what i see and they see like delayed so it's like i don't think anybody gonna tell me anything so but hearing is like somebody was impressed or not impressed and i'm like oh okay yeah good to know gotcha gotcha gotcha yeah thanks man i appreciate you i appreciate you young man
SPEAKER_03: Appreciate you, young man. Listen, Tuomas is getting a little tired. I'll let him sleep for a little bit. Then we're going to go back to him. How is young man doing? He looks very saucy. He looked much bigger. He looked much more motivated. Like you definitely have some inside knowledge on Travis's form. But is he where close he is to beating Kalina in your mind?
SPEAKER_00: to listen up i'm not the one to brag right but if you were gonna stand up and raise your hands and just kneel down i'll highly appreciate that uh no no i mean he's good like he's uh you know like travis is one of those dudes where he has a couple like he may seem lazy
SPEAKER_00: but he has a couple of those points where he needs to do what he does to that puts him on the next level or stay consistent kind of like devon with the whole house is like the whole gym thing right so travis goes and teaches the kids football things every day right so he's in the gym every day but now he went up there
SPEAKER_00: you know, utmost step and put the whole side table training thing machine in the living room. So his wife officially hates him. It's official, there's arm wrestling in the house. So, yeah, I mean, he is... I mean, dude, he just doesn't eat that much. You know what I mean? Statistically and all that, like, and just getting stronger. Like, yeah, I mean, he is definitely serious. As far as, like, pulling Kalina, I mean...
SPEAKER_00: Dude, it all depends, I guess, on overall, like, because I'm, like, looking at seeing Travis compete and being up there against people that, like, you know, you're out there also fighting him on the table. And how much really, like, how far can you not get exhausted? I bet you he'll probably will kill Kalina for sure in the first two.
SPEAKER_00: hundred percent i mean i don't depending power wise like i really care i mean it's hard to understand the super heavyweights paul i know travis is capable of just killing him three zero but if i were like just to do a random bet i bet you travis is the guy to to win that the first two rounds hundred percent and then i bet you're gonna get really sweaty so but you only need to do what uh is that like you need to win three or four times for them uh best of five best of five
SPEAKER_00: I mean, for the guy like Travis, it is, you know, knocking those three out before you get any type of, like, tiredness and all that. You know, that's not that hard. But, yeah, I think he's viable to eventually get tired and shit, too. I think like a lot of us, too. But, yeah, man, like, yeah, but...
SPEAKER_00: It's hard to really say anything because he's stylistically such a beast and just coming all together. It's just nasty. It's just nasty. Especially considering how sloppy he was two years ago. That's just incredible.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I'm excited to see the young man back, right? It's going to be awesome. I'm going to ask and pretend like I don't know the answer to the Latvian gangster, Tuomas Rozic. Tuomas, how was the preparation? How is going preparation? You're still training. Most likely next week will be the last week of training and then just the rest, right? Yeah, basically we are doing everything that...
SPEAKER_01: all the same we are training hard training a lot doing like a lot of in one practice like two and a half hours or something yeah we're basically working hard non-stop and that's how we do let's see
SPEAKER_01: you were in a gym after Arizona you arrived on Sunday and on Tuesday you were back to training like fully to two and a half basically you just get to getting addicted from all this and it's like okay I go to home there is like no one there is like nothing to do tonight okay I go to gym yeah
SPEAKER_01: and that's how it's how it goes and like always like in the mornings you pack your bag in with that uh with that smile on your face put that towel inside and you're so excited about that and you're waiting you're working all day and waiting that that's uh five five uh pm so you know you're gonna go go back to gym and work hard so
SPEAKER_03: 5 o'clock, Janus usually finishes work a little later, so they train together. So Tuomas is there like 30, 40 minutes, just something. And then the whole training, sometimes we... Tuomas' biggest issue at the start was endurance. Like, it just wasn't there. Like, he could practice for 15 minutes, he was killing everyone.
SPEAKER_01: and after 15 minutes everyone was killing kim now it's he can live for two hours like two hours of practice so we kind of worked on that but it took us a long time right it was because you know after that 15 20 minutes my elbows was in pain like five years long and that's why i couldn't train my uh endurance uh to the table you know if uh in 20 minutes i like uh
SPEAKER_01: Pain is killing me, so how can I pull for two hours or something? That's why I couldn't make my endurance, because it was like putting cold water on my arm in the shower and with the tears on my eyes, and then, okay, the pain is gone, and then I'm back to the table and the same shit again.
SPEAKER_03: It was like literally first 15-20 minutes we practice and then you see Tuomas just he's just somewhere in a corner like finds a cold metal push it and just like and it was like literally five years like five years right right after the COVID when COVID started like then you kind of adjusted adjusted adjusted and then the practices were longer and now you even pulling is long.
SPEAKER_00: so what about what helped that uh a pain barrier transition just practicing more well what was the transition because like in five years pain pain pain and you said cover time what happened during covet did you stop practice more or how did it went from having less pain right because people always ask about basically i didn't i didn't change anything
SPEAKER_01: you just start to disappear slowly you know yeah i didn't change anything i trained trained the same just finally start to getting uh i just realized like oh i just pulled like an hour or something i don't i still don't feel any pain in my name i know differently to him i know what we did differently the storms used to practice with diamonds and all they do is hit each other just hit and then
SPEAKER_03: the covet came and I said let's slow things down and we went for control pools control pool like Tom's like arm wrestling IQ on the table is from from from like five six years in he was super strong but it was still not there he was just ready now he can take positions he understands positions I think because like now some pools we pull for a minute
SPEAKER_03: right some matches me and you have we pull for a minute and it's fine it's it's tiring but you kind of go out you continue but uh he comes that I'm on something which comes and I was like I'll beat you and then they go it's crazy it's always funny to watch but um it it arm wrestling hurts for first 10 years and then you get just used to pain right right right right do you still like uh
SPEAKER_00: yeah well because sometimes you know uh if i practice how i practice it's normal but if i go and just bang with everybody yeah i'll eventually get some elbow pains and stuff but that's what's funny like so now i always hang out with my buddy mike who is uh about to turn 50 been arm wrestling for less than a year right and we got him in the stem cell business and like you know so he had some previous pains before like this he's like
SPEAKER_00: rotator cuff surgeries right got that figured out and that'll solve now the stem cells but now he has like elbow pads and elbow like and wrist and all that and he's like well i want to do stem cells here and i'm like hey steps is going to help you with everything and all that but
SPEAKER_00: I'm going to have to remind you that you also started arm wrestling and that stem cells are not going to help for the next 10 years or whatever. You're going to be in some pain. Whatever you're discussing here, I'm always feeling it. I'm just not talking about it. I've been talking about it for the past 10 years. I'm just living with it right now. You know what? That's another thing. You probably just get tired of talking about your pain at some point.
SPEAKER_03: yeah first five years you hate it so much that you want to talk about it and you want to google it and you want to fix it then you want to realize that's fixable like i'm going to stop talking about it that's also true like you know like if you talk more about something like the problem becomes bigger but sometimes like with this sometimes they say just ignore it just ignore it like don't yeah well
SPEAKER_01: Well, but I didn't talk about that. I'm just standing somewhere next to the wall. Yeah, you all know. You knew, but I didn't talk. I didn't complain. I just stand and put my elbow somewhere in a cool place and a cold place. What will a young man tell you? Do not ever diagnose yourself with anything negative. Don't ever self-diagnose. If you can self-diagnose yourself, you self-diagnose yourself with something positive.
SPEAKER_00: So I haven't got. Yeah, I've got no pants.
SPEAKER_03: had no pains i just i just win uh you also won the second year in a row you won the tournament and qualified for another match so you definitely gonna have another match right you you oh yeah yeah so yeah the thing is thumbs doesn't work out too well i mean i can always negotiate like another one you know i mean listen and then you say right on give me give me whoever wins david or or sasha
SPEAKER_00: oh brother i have to trade my right arm it's like three months now
SPEAKER_03: uh so that's a that's a big big match in 85 kilos uh sasha coming down to 85 uh to face david coming down and away wow 85 yeah they're pulling 85 title so what are your thoughts ken because sasha is almost in everyone's eyes favorite but what david has done is pretty insane right
SPEAKER_00: what samusha and sasha oh no i think david wins that one you gotta you gotta yeah you gotta top roll david right i feel like that's what everybody like the whole game plan right i feel like david is beatable with a proper top roll but in here we don't see it or people don't try it and he's really not that winnable so i feel like going in there with him like dude i still convinced
SPEAKER_00: Like, I remember when, who did, I think Justin pulled Mendoza and Craig Tuye pulled Samushia. That was the card. And we all were training with him. We all talked about, like, Paul Lin and Samushia pulling. And then I think Paul Lin beat him, right? But I did my research video after the fact, and I'm like,
SPEAKER_00: I feel like Paul got lucky that day. Like, if it was, like, somewhere else, like, maybe it was a bad motherfucker. So, yeah, I feel like, yeah, going inside the team, it's even worse like that. So, we just think, well, I mean, and Sasho, I mean, Sasho can be tricky, I think, but more than with his left, if I'm correct. Like, he can switch it up a little bit, but, no, I think David will be, stylistically, he's the favorite as far as I'm understanding. That's an interesting take.
SPEAKER_03: Right, I mean, that's, I mean... Sancho, in his class, like, he was 95, right? He's not a 95 guy. And in a hook, it's, he almost never loses. I mean, unless it's... Really, really fast arm wrestlers can beat him.
SPEAKER_03: but like when they hit him to the side and something but samushi is is not that fast and he he cannot really top roll and I think they're gonna go in a hook and in a hook like Sasho for for me probably one of the best I mean I see what you're saying if there if it comes down to like uh Sasho really like cutting the water weight and then he's he's there like
SPEAKER_00: you know the same like 100 kilos full in 85 then sure but if it's like the same weight I don't know I feel like you need to be like a disgusting faggot ass stop roller to do something I think that definitely will take something out of them coming down to 85 right and I think uh some more she also cuts weight what I heard and it's getting harder for him correct
SPEAKER_00: Correct, correct. I mean, they're both fairly big dudes, I think, in general. But yeah, I mean, I could be wrong, but I also don't think, I disagree that Sasho's hook is that
SPEAKER_00: it's great but i think it's not that he only loses to it but i think there is a problem with the direction of the how it goes like that's why todd hodgkin can still beat him outside with side pressure with the biceps like there's vectors to it so and i mean considering how both of them are muscle they could be just yeah it could also not go anywhere hmm
SPEAKER_03: yeah I agree uh toms uh this is the definitely the class that you're gonna pull 85 and uh this is uh we were thinking maybe maybe after great performance in Europeans we'll get uh David samushia but uh right now uh Sasho is pulling you know both of these guys David you have seen before and Sasho you know uh how do you see this match
SPEAKER_01: You mean me against one of them? No, no, no. Who wins between those two? I've seen some fights, but I actually don't remember because I didn't pay attention.
SPEAKER_03: he doesn't care about a lot of these things he will he will watch the matches he will enjoy the match he will remember someone but if he's not like invested in you he doesn't give up that's right because you know as soon as one of those guys will be he have to pull then he will know everything about him that's right
SPEAKER_00: So, Artem, you will be the expert here. Vitalii and Artem Morozov. Listen, what's going on? Oh, yeah. I'm not much of an expert, man. I don't know. I'm just, I'm seeing all the trash talk. I think, like, they go awesome between both of them on Instagram and stuff. That's all I see them posting. Dude, yeah, I'm no expert. I mean, can you be an expert? Like, them two, like, almost, like, they're not arm-wrestling each other, right? Like, they have not done that.
SPEAKER_00: they're like, I mean, they're kind of touching the same people almost like slowly. I guess you can, you can be an expert. I used to be, I used to be a big Artem guy because, you know, obviously the name, but since he, every time he sees me, he thinks I'm the wish one and he is the real one. I'm like, my man, I'm, you know, you're younger than me, right? Like I give some respect here for even like the elder and it's like, come on now, something. So, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: uh so yeah i mean yeah i'm excited man uh that's uh i mean you know especially being the left-handed weirdo um that's how much i'm invested just as much as thomas so
SPEAKER_00: uh then uh dude well um what is it supposed to be actually is are is it arlem trying to like be in the same spot he was before or is vitaly going for his spot what what is the general take i think whoever wins will be very close to a title shot uh it because uh vitaly is coming from one win one loss right so it's not gonna be like instantly uh
SPEAKER_03: Because he lost to Aramis. So Aramis is definitely, in my opinion, way ahead of everyone for that, right? But there's a few guys in conversation. And whoever wins this one, because Artem also lost to Svetko. Remember that? That's right. That's right. Yeah. So...
SPEAKER_00: man that's gonna be a war i'm gonna yeah you're gonna help whatsoever i'm gonna i'm gonna think vitality is at hand and arden fights it and wins a couple of them but man it's i don't think it's gonna be clean but i don't know who wins it it's gonna be like two like three two some
SPEAKER_03: I I think it's gonna be close match and then yeah I'm interested to see like how Artem will deal with with the post right of insane the first one I think Vitalii I think there's a lot of top role yeah oh
SPEAKER_03: Because I think for Artem, if Artem can cut him straight away, right, or just not lose the hand, it's all good. But then if he loses the hand, he has to make a decision. Does he give it all on the first and doesn't have a hand for the rest of the rounds? Or he tries a better engagement and then maybe loses the wrist, you know? Because if someone takes it or you give it away, there's two different things, you know? 100%. 100%. So, yeah, he has some choice there for sure.
SPEAKER_00: um especially i mean it's hard to hold on to all that long forearm too um yeah i agree with you we totally win the first one and then uh but then it has to go to two it has to go to two yeah
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, well, we'll see. That's the main event, and it will be crazy exciting, I think. Hey, so can we talk about this? You guys have one elephant in the room, and you're elephant in the room. How the hell am I? I'm asking Tom, and I understand. I have another one that you guys don't know about, and that's what's going on here in the United States. Nobody knows about East versus West 13th.
SPEAKER_00: everybody's asking me who am i pulling august 10. i'm like hey guys there's a whole another card happening in this temple before that everybody around everybody around here are so sold and cannot play i get messages hey man i guess got my vip ticket i'll see you soon oh i'll see you in turkey right no no no i'm talking about orlando like dude do you
SPEAKER_00: Dude, everybody is so hot around here about August. It's incredible. And, like, I get it. I guess if you're the guy to be, like, you know, I guess in America or even not. But I bet you as Americans, you're like, oh, what are you going to have East versus West in North America? And, like, I mean, I always thought the logistics were too hard to do that. But, I mean, it is happening. So, dude, people are extremely hot about the whole thing. It almost makes me, like, think, I'm like, man.
SPEAKER_00: because i think the the card that we are wrestling on is it's one of the best ones also like it's the card is pretty insane like every single match yeah so like but like did everybody excited here about the 14th one i hope thomas is not going to be
SPEAKER_03: yeah they're like uh because north america has been out of really big events like crazy big events like you know king of table and east versus west for whatever people's reason is people are excited about that thing yeah i'm just uh hoping we don't they don't miss this great card with again this uh
SPEAKER_03: Great Americans pulling. We have Travis Bajan coming back. We have Todd Hutchings pulling, right? We have you, Chance Shaw, who am I missing? Adam Obrzynski, yeah. Dude, it's a strong team. They may seem like Paul Linden or some shit, but it's a good card.
SPEAKER_00: now you're just missing Paul and that's it he's not coming for this one he usually comes but I think for this one he will skip because he's a man he has a match I feel like that that card alone is so hot and to be there but like I feel like everybody around here like yeah man you ready for August I have a match man you don't want my trading card what's wrong with you yeah
SPEAKER_03: So, yeah, I mean, I'm definitely excited about everything going on so far. Well, arm wrestling is the hottest thing right now, right? So it's good. And I think in North America, it's booming like crazy. Challenger Series looked absolutely awesome. I want to go, like, we're not going to be here for long, and I want to just ask, like, first with you. I'm always going to be here for the five cigarettes of Tom's. It probably should take an hour.
SPEAKER_00: i got i i have taken message from arizona guys but i got message from world soup from some russian dudes yo this guy thompson's crazy every time i'm outside he's out there smoking a cigarette he's he is like a gangster yeah that's true
SPEAKER_03: I'm like, people say the same thing about me. I guess you guys don't see a cigarette. That is true. That's also true. I've been making fun of Torbs. At one point, he will come to table and he'll just put the cigarette on the ear of the referee, pull, take it back, and go back. Yeah, sadly, it's not allowed there.
SPEAKER_03: yeah but you know when when you are champ that's what you would when you are the champ like you get the belt you start smoking on the stage hold on hold on hold on is the cigarette still lit of course okay that's what that would make you the gangster i got you i got you yeah you just continue you just put it back yeah and if it's a slip you do a puff
SPEAKER_03: You have to do it when a freester does it. A freester is like proper height for the cigarette holder. Or Luke Pulcher. Said the tallest man in our wrestling. Okay, I go for 2 ohms. Don't you ever wrap my matches. You're going to end up with a blackened mile in your ear. I'll tell you what it is later. Listen, listen.
SPEAKER_03: too busy too busy uh toms if you are muscle toms you're gonna have cigarettes in one ear hey i your best strategy if something goes like it doesn't work out you just come to him and you say like you do you do it like a prison trade you're like seven six you get me a strap how much hey how much for the block how much for the block i got the black normal over here
SPEAKER_00: uh malboro skinny filter good good for the pool yeah do you remember there was cigarettes with no filter dude i was just explaining somebody about the bellamore canal about those cigarettes where they come from oh man you need to google those it's basically smoking asbestos with no filter on them it's incredible
SPEAKER_03: uh spare jail style so oh yeah i mean okay you kind of won those i have a real arm wrestling questions before you know youtube shuts down this stream and the police comes and comes gets us all away uh toms what is your goal in arm wrestling right now short term long term goals in arm wrestling
SPEAKER_01: basically get all the achievements built in the east versus west uh gold medals in the world yeah and what else yeah all the championships are tournament i'll take everything i'll take everything listen to how he said medals he wasn't going for a medal he's like all the medals i want all the medals yeah both arms so that's why it's not metal it's metal artem
SPEAKER_00: Well, his short-term goal is not to lose to me, and long-term goal is to beat everybody else. My short-term goal is not to lose to Tom. That's not the goal. The goal is to beat you, and the short-term goal is also not to lose to you. That's the two of them. And then...
SPEAKER_00: I don't want to talk about all my good plans, man, but yeah, I'm thinking I'm going to do something crazy left-handed regardless. I mean, both hands, but I think it's clear with everything that's being scheduled in my way, like pulling Tom Snell, pulling Matt later and all of that stuff. I think eventually, yeah, I'm going to do something crazy left-handed to where all of those matches that seem extremely hard right now, I think it's all going to pay off in a couple years later anyway. So,
SPEAKER_00: yeah okay i'll be the guy i'll be the guy that i have to steal the metal from what what's uh what's your weight now currently it's about what 183 184 so normal language yeah i'm sorry um we pulled an 85 something probably probably 83. okay so you're you're less
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I think too. I'm on. Yeah, I'm on. I'm way under. Yeah, for sure. As I say, like me, it's moving and me getting sick and all that. Like I was coming down anyway. Like when Anken messaged me about that, because I was asking, I was trying to push the weight with Thompson a little bit, right? Because when he said pull Thompson 187 at 85 kilos, when he messaged me, I was probably 97 kilos. And I'm like, can I do like 90?
SPEAKER_00: And I think Tom said, like, 85, so I'm like, all right, so that's why I'm lower. But it gives me plenty of room to where, like, I should be just at 85 the whole time until the tournament, until the Supermatch. So I'm sure 85 right now, right? Like, yeah, like 85, 86 or something. I think much over 85, basically. Okay, so it shouldn't be a problem to both of you and should be pretty... Yeah, we understand. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: So, Artem, when are you arriving to Turkey? Dude, so as I'm saying, I'm hanging out with my buddy Mike. Mike made the point, hey, July 1st is my birthday. I don't want to do no traveling July 4th. I'm like, I will get there earlier. So I think we're going to get there July 3rd. We're leaving America July 2nd. So, yeah, getting there by the 3rd.

SPEAKER_00: I don't even try to think about that and name the day. That's disrespectful. I'll do it for you. I think nine was the last one. Eight or nine. Listen, people. Artem still blames me for all the situation. I blame you for every situation in my life. I would have been in Russia if it wasn't for you.
