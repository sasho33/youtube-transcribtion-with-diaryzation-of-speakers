SPEAKER_03: So, Egla, how is the training, practice going? Now I recover. So, yeah, easy, easy. Perfect. And it's strange feeling for me because usually I train and hard train. Now I'm easy. Yeah, I see. Barbara, how does your sound go?
SPEAKER_03: not good without voice we can't hear you yeah okay anyway uh i hope that she can figure that out
SPEAKER_03: I just want to welcome everyone to East versus West podcast. We have, I actually look at three really world champions on the screen right now. I'm happy to have you Egle, Barbara and Fia. So Barbara has some trouble with her sound. So we have to train.
SPEAKER_03: on the lip reading notes. Like I'm good. I'm training like this. Yeah, that will be good. Yeah. So this is a world title match. Um, the woman that wins this match wins the belt where Barbara has the belt right now.
SPEAKER_03: Are you ready to steal it, Egle? I try. I really try and I want to steal. I have two. Yeah. That's good. My goal for this day. Yeah. And do you have had some trouble with injuries or feeling not so good so you haven't been able to train that much? No. I feel good. You feel good? Yeah. Barbara?
SPEAKER_03: Do you have a headphones or something you could maybe plug in? No. And try that. Now we hear you. Yes, we hear you. So now everybody has to be nice again. Barbara, how are you? I'm good, a little bit tired, but I'm good. I feel strength and power.
SPEAKER_01: and that's good is coming for me yeah you also have uh easy training now before the the match or do you train yes a little bit like recovery i uh working with physiotherapist now and we added some more experience and exercises on the this preparation and we were
SPEAKER_03: I'm trying to get the chat on here so I can read the questions for you. So Egle, I think that since you lost against Gabriela Vasconcelos the last time and Barbara, you won against her.
SPEAKER_03: Some people say that Barbara will play with you. What do you say to all these people, Egle? I'm not sure. No, if really we will see, I don't know. Because we never met with Barbara each other, so I can't say anything. So I don't know even how to prepare to fight with her. So it will be, I see on the table what to do.
SPEAKER_03: yeah but before um because when you met uh gabby you trained you told me that you were training like you usually do uh all the time preparing for competitions but then after that you lost her and you met sarah and you started to really analyze sarah and you started to train differently and you told me is this the same thing with the barbara now
SPEAKER_03: Of course. I train top roll, train hook. I prepare everywhere. So I feel strong everywhere. Because I don't know how she will go. And don't know how feel I this day. Now I feel like animal. Strong, very strong. But this day, I don't know. It depends how I wake up, how I feel. I can't be stronger every day. Every people. So we will see. It's my day or not.
SPEAKER_04: and how strong i am or barbara yeah is gabby the only a puller that you have to compare yourself with because you have never met uh like you have never met barbara and but you you both have met gabby is that the only match you can compare it or is there another same competitors you have met
SPEAKER_01: Do you understand my question? Yeah, I hope I understand. I think maybe Rana. I don't know. Jana? Yeah. Have you pulled with Jana, Barbara? Yeah, I pulled in European and World Champion. I was happy. She was third. Yeah, she has a bronze medal in European on Slovakia. I was happy for her.
SPEAKER_03: yeah this category yeah so barbara how have you been training and what do you think about egla at the table what are you more what have you been training to to win to beat her oh um i saw her match with sarah in uh east versus west and uh i honestly was shocked
SPEAKER_01: i thought that sarah would win correctly and dominate before the match i uh told with uh with engine and he asked me if i won't give a champion champion belt to the winner and i was honored i don't think that i don't take the first match seriously
SPEAKER_01: but when Egle won the third, I looked at Anna and what the fuck, when, why, how? But I wish Egle this title and I think it's not clean hook and top roll, her specific technique, but we will see. Yeah. I saw some
SPEAKER_03: This was before Igle was pooling and before you were pooling with Gabi. I saw that you two trained at the practice table, maybe after a competition, maybe you have been pooling somewhere, Barbara? I don't know if we did. I remember we have after pool, after European Championship in Lithuania, 2021. And my coach criticized me.
SPEAKER_01: before but i was the happiest person in the world because uh paul with eggland it was my dream because i was younger it was 30 years ago
SPEAKER_01: and yes maybe she will be dom she was dominate in this uh time and i saw with uh with dre and janice and uh yes it but it was three years ago and i know i uh did may i did make a great progress
SPEAKER_01: and i remember he carrying the tables out of the hall uh and we were pulling with bulgarian guys with christo del jacko sasho andrea and we was drank and and i asked her uh if she if she could and we will we will have after pool and my friend ivan gregorichka uh take it in the youtube
SPEAKER_01: channel on slovakia wrestling and we have i think 5 000 views maybe yeah but it was my dream because uh me did the the best in my beijing i uh knew only lucia rebecca and the slova girls uh i uh do i'm wrestling seven ideas
SPEAKER_01: and uh but when i started uh watching the potential my potential senior opponent i saw uh irina makieva eagle and gabi yeah i knew that i would want to meet at the same table yeah so this is a really like
SPEAKER_03: i am so excited about this match i can't say who will win um i think that maybe many people think that egla or people that maybe or i think people maybe think so because of the match they can only compare with the gabi match but i think that egla you have been training so much now in a different way and when we saw you
SPEAKER_03: as barbara says against sarah and when you like you played with her um she was also like training for she wanted to win really bad and so i think that it's a different egg now
SPEAKER_03: than with gabby but what you're saying barbara also when you two were on that training table you were much younger and you're very young how old are you 24 fresh 24 years old only like just out of juniors uh so your your um peak it will go faster for you to get stronger
SPEAKER_03: So this will be really an amazing match. What do you think, Egle, about her progress, Barbara's? I will check this progress. You don't think anything right now? No, I don't know. I can't say. Yeah. I could check and then can say something or not. And Egle, you usually now weigh
SPEAKER_03: Below 80 kilos, right? 85. Now 85? Yeah. Yeah. So we are almost the same weight category. No, I'm 79, but I'm scared of you. So you can stay plus 80. Okay, deal. Thank you.
SPEAKER_04: so fia do you have um i will check the chat here and see if they have um any questions yeah i would like to hear egg and barbara what do you think is your strength um against each other like what what do you think is the the the thing you do that will make you the winner of this match
SPEAKER_01: Barbara. I saw very differences between Egle and Gabi. Gabi has strong shorthand and Egle has bigger. And I don't know, we will see. And what's your plan?
SPEAKER_04: Because we never met and we're only guessing. Yeah, but I want to hear the guesses. That's what we're doing here. We're just guessing. I want to hear, I want to go inside your heads and see what you're thinking about and how you, because I believe both of you are confident and think you will win. And that's, for doing that, you need to have like,
SPEAKER_04: what is my strength and how can I use it against this arm and against this person and and like Egle have a lot of experience pulling lots of different girls in different sizes and she have not very many losses it's like only against the Gabi and Makeva I've seen
SPEAKER_04: and and the barbara have not uh barbara have not pulled that many different strong girls um so i've never been really challenged yeah because now the russian russian girls are stop it and i don't have opponent now how does that feel for you
SPEAKER_03: yeah but now you have one of the greatest here and at east versus west it will be great for for you in the future too i think sorry what was your question fia did you say ask a question yeah
SPEAKER_04: i don't know if they want to answer that question but i can if i can say i would say that uh egla have a lot of uh like knowledge and can do different things and i think barbara have weight and power uh so and also maybe the height
SPEAKER_04: if that could be a problem or an advantage. I don't know, I would think like that. Do you agree? I try to speed. Yeah, speed also. Because it's lighter and I can... Yeah. Speed power. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Carolina Pettersson is asking, she wants to hear your score predictions. So in this match, it's the world title match. So you will actually pull seven matches if not one of you win 4-0. But what do you think, Egle? What will the score be?
SPEAKER_01: I hope in my side, better. Yes. Barbara? I have a good mentality and I'm not rich, but I have a dream I will win. Yes. But with how many do you think you will win? Four to zero? Maybe. Okay.
SPEAKER_03: maybe you don't want to get into was four one four one for me no no no no no when we met private sarah sarah was confident and she said easy yeah yeah so do you think that you don't want to say anything in advance i think us girls are more
SPEAKER_03: careful with that then when i see the men in these shows they are always like i'm so good i will beat you but but all the women is so modest and uh maybe we don't want to i don't know i think in the head it's the same yeah sorry yeah what did you say barbara we don't like trash talk
SPEAKER_03: I think that we want to raise the other person so that at least for me if I'm in a competition I want to raise the other one and say oh she's so good she's so strong and because then it makes me the underdog and I am better when I think that the other person will win is that the same for you or do you want to go into the
SPEAKER_03: like the match and say that you are gonna win for me better when nobody believes in me yeah me too barbara me too yeah yeah i like to be the underdog absolutely then i can only win like i have nothing to lose yeah it's easy he said
SPEAKER_03: Because you haven't much press. Because 100% you win. Don't worry, you win. And then, bam. Oh, my God.
SPEAKER_04: And also, if everyone believes in you and you also believe very much in yourself and tell everyone that I will win this match and then you win, there will be no, like, there will be, oh, yeah, because you already knew that. Everyone said that and no one will be, like, surprised. But if you say, oh, no, I'm not sure. I know this girl is very, very strong and I will do my best and
SPEAKER_03: And then when you win, the win will be much more worth in some way. Even if you think inside that I will win, but you don't say that loud. We were talking a little bit about in the beginning of this podcast that you said, oh, I don't know what will happen. I will see on that day if I feel good or if I don't and how I feel.
SPEAKER_03: what do you do for preparation to feel like you're gonna like be there and be ready on saturday can you do something rituals if you're asking i haven't rituals i just sleeping be alone most of time and eat good yeah that's everything i need but i don't know it's helped me it's helped
SPEAKER_03: You feel better. I don't know. But how I say it, it depends how you wake up this morning. Yeah. And for you, Barbara? It depends from me. I already done. Now, my fortune. Yeah. So you believe in the fortune. Yeah. For me, I am really like having my, I have my preparations always before a match.
SPEAKER_03: I eat mashed potatoes the day before, because I get strong. Maybe you can try it, Igla. In Lithuania now it's very hot, plus 33 maybe was today, and I eat nothing. My mother said, you saw your opponent. Eat, eat. I can't.
SPEAKER_03: I like your mom. Barbara, how about you? Before you go into this match, how will you prepare the days before to get into the day and be ready? Of course, sleep well, to be alone and maybe listen to good music and have a positive mindset in my head.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah. My game plan. Sometimes it's hard to, when you're in that day and you start to think, oh, what if this happens? And then you have to try to get back to the positive thinking, I think. Yeah. I will see if they have any questions here. They are talking about, they're talking about your match, of course. And some people say that Egle will win, that they believe in her.
SPEAKER_03: And, but also Barbara, of course, and that you learn, you will learn fast how to deal with Egle. Um, yeah. Okay. So we have a game, Mia and Fia. Are you ready? I will tell you the game. So we will start with Egle.
SPEAKER_03: And the game is called Eight Fast Ones. Can't they answer both on the same questions? Or do you have different questions for them both? No, we do it that way. It's the same question. It's the same question. You have to answer fast. But you know that my English is not very good. We know, we know.
SPEAKER_03: or your english is perfectly well but i'm gonna i'm gonna do it fast so you will choose from a word that i'm saying it can be cats or dogs and then you have to say dogs i'm just explaining the game but now you know and then fia will ask you some questions about it what will i okay yeah
SPEAKER_04: I'm ready. Are you ready, girls? Of course. Of course. Don't move. Hook or top roll? Top roll. Top roll. Okay, that's easy. You are top rollers both. But what about hook? Can you... If you get inside a hook, can you pull? It's funny because my trainer...
SPEAKER_01: In my club, in Orava, we can practice hook and we must practice top roll because my coach is one of the best top-floor hookers in the master category and I must travel to Western Slovakia and other clubs, maybe Mijava, Dobravoda, Senjec and practice hook because I can in my home club. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: And Egle, didn't you hook with Sarah a little bit? Yeah. I am universal. I can work where you want. Okay. What did you say, Egle? I can everywhere. I feel comfortable. It's normal. I will afterwards...
SPEAKER_03: uh i wrestle with you girls just to feel how strong you are anyway next question x explosivity or endurance i'm very quick you're quick yeah and you ain't gonna die i am explosivity and endurance
SPEAKER_03: Both. Two in one. Perfect. And this one you have to answer super fast. Egle or Barbara? Egle. Did you also say Egle, Barbara? What did you mean by that? Barbara.
SPEAKER_03: Did you say Egle? Yeah. Why? Because it was fun. Yeah. Yeah. And it was not the question who would win. It's just, yeah. Okay. Straps or no straps? Straps. No straps. Nice. So what will happen if there will be straps, Egle?
SPEAKER_03: Well, in straps, I have a choice. Yeah. So let's say that you won 3-0. Let's say this in the beginning. And Barbara says in the fourth match, should we start in straps? No. What would you answer? No? No. If you won 4-0, and then Barbara asked, can we do the fifth one
SPEAKER_03: We do the fifth one in straps. I just want to see how it feels. Would you do it? I think we first match will go with straps because it's... I think so. I saw because every match is slip, slip or referee grip. It's... I know what wait for me. It's normal. Yeah. I don't know, Barbara. Did you...
SPEAKER_03: take a take or searching? I just give hand. How you want to take? Okay, yeah. Others, they searching, they moving, moving, moving, moving, then referee grip. Nobody good. For her, for me, nobody good. But if you want, okay. Okay, we can do this. So exciting. We will see.
SPEAKER_03: And also because both of you are top rollers, maybe it will be easier to... Yeah. If one of you is not fast enough. Next question. Early mornings or late nights? Early mornings. Both? Ah, both.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah. Why is that? Okay, I do you train? Do you think it's easier to train in in the day time like mornings? Or do you train in evenings after work and or before dinner or after dinner?
SPEAKER_01: like i like trying early morning because i have uh i'm student and i work in supermarket and uh i start the day with uh workout and i like it i have more endorphins after them and energy and
SPEAKER_01: i like but now i prepared uh in uh now now for example i go to walk in this time because i know that tournament was in evening o'clock we start at uh eight turkish time eight nine p.m i don't know i think yeah and now uh after our call i go to walk

SPEAKER_03: Yeah, because I saw you and I thought it was a nurse. I cut some watermelon and I work on bakery and with sausages and salams and more. Okay, I'm going to have the last question. We didn't do eight because maybe people will get bored. But this is also a fast one. Malin or Fia?
SPEAKER_03: I'm bigger. I'm bigger, so I'm stronger. Or I'm not. I can't choose. Both of you are great. Okay, good. Good for the
SPEAKER_03: um so we don't get unfriendly here yeah so um what else do you have any more questions sephia do you have any questions for each other no if really what i can ask um it's nothing it's me nothing on the table it's with nothing yeah

SPEAKER_01: new kind of competition like this versus so here i am i have um targets for me too i uh thought i it was my dream to meet the best i meet uh gabby i won and now i am made with uh
SPEAKER_01: another gold uh another champion agreement and we will see and i'm uh honorable to have this match in my age yes and also now it's gonna be three three women's uh matches on uh on east versus west 13. that's amazing
SPEAKER_03: bring more women to this sport and more matches. Hopefully we can have three matches every time. Do you look forward to any other match at the East versus West? No. I think Engen is master. He knows who can. So that's why he is... He is, yeah. I think it will be the best tournament.
SPEAKER_03: in history, I think. Yeah, me too. And about Engin, I talked to him when we were at the Europeans and he told me about how he is choosing all the matches. And he told me that he has like, now maybe it's imaginary in my head, but this is how I thought that he said it. He has like a big map of different people
SPEAKER_03: up on the wall for me i was thinking like in a police uh police series on netflix that you have all the bad guys uh up there and you're trying to figure out who is the murderer but but i think he's super smart and he knows exactly i mean i talked to him and he said oh you know 2014 when you met
SPEAKER_03: Gabriella, and you did this and that. It was really good. And I was like, was I even at the Worlds? She remembers more than I do, even with smaller people like me. I mean, not smaller, but not as known as everybody else. So he's the puppet master who really does great matches.
SPEAKER_03: I look forward to all the women's matches, of course. It's going to be awesome to see. But for me, this match is the greatest, especially even more than with Gabriella and Sarah, because I have not seen you two arm wrestle. So it's going to be amazing.
SPEAKER_04: and right now you two are the the considered the two best females pullers no no no what weight class like in open category so this is the super exciting i think this is everyone is looking forward to this match yeah everyone okay very much
SPEAKER_01: Yeah. Can you feel that? Is that making you nervous or does it give you fire? Not now, but maybe in this day, in the morning, maybe I feel something. I will feel something, but not now.
SPEAKER_03: I always get nervous, even if it's other people. So I was the last day when I was talking to Dimitrina and Ayane, I was like also a little bit nervous after. I feel like I am you. It's going to be awesome. So what do you think, Barbara, about Egles? What do you think is her weaknesses?
SPEAKER_02: I don't know. I can see, I can see. If I lost, I thought about putting on weight a little bit, maybe. Back to what I was.
SPEAKER_03: somehow okay i won't feel lighter for me it's better because hot and in training i feel better yeah i can do exercises which needs my body weight so when you are lighter easier and yeah i'm happy when i can climb the rope or pull-ups dude so i'm happy yeah if i lost i will think maybe need more weight for me
SPEAKER_03: Yeah. Yeah. But not, not for summer. No. So every summer you will diet and look good. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. I am look good, but, but for me, it's better than I was. Oh, thank you. I saw you on the boat today. I was thinking she will be here in one hour. Why is she out on the boat? Yeah. I left my family, my friends and
SPEAKER_03: run home because i promise be with you that's good thank you i think everybody is happy that you came to to the show um but you were quite light when you pulled with gabby then you were under 80 kilos wasn't you yeah i was the same weight i think okay i thought you were lighter than but no okay
SPEAKER_03: maybe one kilo but it's not yeah no okay so somebody is asking about what date it is um east versus west it's uh east versus west fifth 13 and it's the sixth of july and so saturday next saturday and uh don't forget to to uh buy the pay-per-view it's probably in the in the
SPEAKER_04: Live chat somewhere. You can find it. Yeah, I can see it there. Yeah. More questions? Do we have any? Yeah, can't you... Barbara, is there any matches? I know Malin already asked this, but I will ask again and I will make you answer what other matches...
SPEAKER_01: uh this day are you looking forward to it and not if it's not your match do you know any matches going on i'm thinking uh maybe when i will uh won this match i uh who is the strongest man in the world you know leon or anything else
SPEAKER_01: and um i won't challenge the strongest guy in the world and i want to be a strongest person in the world you do not only woman that uh person wow yeah so so let's say that you win then you want to have a match against a man yeah is that what you're saying
SPEAKER_03: Or maybe we can do like, if one of you win, we can, me, Fia, all the smaller girls, Caro, Ayane, Dimitrina, we can be in a line and we can try to challenge you. And then you have to stand there until you get tired and lose. And then the person who wins will win the belt. That's a good idea.
SPEAKER_04: No? I didn't follow. Sorry, Molly. No. But I have another question. Who do you think is the top five female pullers in the world? Egle, you can start. No. Let me think. This is a...
SPEAKER_03: Okay, top five. I can see. Top five. It's heavyweight or it's all around? All around. First place. It's without place, okay? Yes. Because I, Barbara, Gabby, Sarah, and fifth. Malin is good. Fifth.
SPEAKER_03: it's more than five now so now yeah no no no from from georgia i got yes yes i think you won against reva right yeah
SPEAKER_03: i don't remember if we have mesh if really i don't remember it was if it was it was whole i met her but then she was in 70 kilos so she was so much lighter than and who won fia i won okay but she was 70 kilos ah now she's under 80 yeah 90. yeah and she goes into category
SPEAKER_01: until 90. And she's born. Do you agree, Barbara, or do you have another name? And for me, Gabi Egle, Irina Makieva, maybe Lucia Dzivnarova. And... Fia? Lucia, she's...
SPEAKER_03: She's better with her left arm. And on the right arm... Sarah. I would love to compete against Sarah. We haven't competed since she was really young.
SPEAKER_01: So that would be fun. I wrote with her and she will come to Sweden next week, I think. I planned after East vs West, I planned to go Barcelona on competition, but now when she will be in Sweden, I'm thinking... And you will come? Yeah, maybe.
SPEAKER_03: no not maybe you're so welcome sarah always comes and practice with us and we always try to meet up so you should come you are free to stay at my place if you want to yeah egla you're welcome too can i also stay in your place ah i don't know but we have good hotels here in stockholm
SPEAKER_03: thank you that's okay so um i don't have any more questions in the chat sweden is considered the west i think yeah that's true we are at east versus west um so if you sorry
SPEAKER_03: who do you think will win again like between carolina and olga um it's hard to say because uh olga uh stop no she not compete a long time yes two years three years how long so i know carolina she's um very technique and i don't know how strong is uh
SPEAKER_04: Olga won the nationals, I think. Was that Sofia? I'm not sure, but I know Olga is good and she's in a great shape now, but still she hasn't competed that much for the last couple of years. But she seemed very confident.
SPEAKER_03: And she knows about Karro and they have met similar people. So, yeah. Karro is going also up since she started just a few years ago. She's training really hard and she is super, super. First of all, she's super technical. She's smart at the table.
SPEAKER_03: Uh, she can pull, um, in different angles. Um, so, um, when she's explosive for me, I think, uh, and not only because she's from Sweden, but I think, uh, yeah, maybe she will win, especially if, uh, if, um, all gas and, um, been in the sport for some while.
SPEAKER_03: even if she has started to train and she has been competing a little bit. But what do you think about Ayane and Dimitrina? It will be very much, I think. But I think Dimitrina will win. I think so. I think size doesn't matter. Yeah. That is true and I think Ayane, she has a short arm and Dimitrina can maybe
SPEAKER_03: pole on the outside. But I think that Ayane is really strong and it will be fun to watch that match too. Because I haven't seen much of her, Ayane, more than when I have been looking on YouTube. Yeah. And at Worlds. Worlds, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: yes but uh if we don't have anything else to say girls i will see you i don't know when are you coming down to turkey on thursday thursday i will be there on wednesday so um i'll see you waiting yes okay i work with the i work with the east versus west now so i will take good care of you like i always do
SPEAKER_03: Especially at the after party. No, I'm just joking. Yeah. So everyone, make sure to buy the pay-per-view or come down to Turkey and watch it live. This is going to be the greatest match in the history. And I look forward to it. And there is other great matches too. There is like, this will be amazing.
SPEAKER_03: You will come or not? I will come. I come on Thursday too. Yeah. Yes, it is. We will be your biggest supporters. But thank you all for watching too. And yeah, see you next Saturday, everyone. And see
