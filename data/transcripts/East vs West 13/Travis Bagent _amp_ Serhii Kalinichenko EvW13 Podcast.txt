SPEAKER_03: training with your left arm yes yes i start training i'm not supposed to train heavy yet but they check all my mobilities so my mobility is basically at you know at the normal level my right and left approximately the same
SPEAKER_03: and uh yeah i started training with the lightweights i'm not going 50 yet but i probably cannot go over 50 but i did some pull-ups and i did some bicep curl and i'm happy with it so it's it's a progress it's good yeah and did you see the our special guest list for the uh east versus west 13. yes i saw that you're there
SPEAKER_04: I love it, you know, I kind of feel like more connected, you know, whenever, like, I feel like a family and then past and present, you know, meets, then I feel like, you know, it's like a family union. I don't know how you guys call over there, family union, right? Yeah, it's family union, that's what it is, family reunion. Yeah, no, yeah, absolutely, you're right. It's amazing when those guys can, you know, be together under the same roof.
SPEAKER_04: Yes, yes. And I also invited Richard Lapkus and I invited Dave Patton. Dave Patton, he said that he made family plans, like to travel, like vacation or something. And so he couldn't make it. Like, it would be great if Dave Patton was there.
SPEAKER_04: uh as well and Richard uh also had some reasons that he couldn't um I know Michael asked him what's that I spoke with Richard recently like a month ago yeah he said okay yeah so he so he couldn't make either you know I'm just thinking like a few more guys a few more guys that I forgot you know I think I think that they need to join as well um
SPEAKER_04: and you will see uh i don't want to mention the names but i will i will i will invite them i hope i hope they can make it as well so you know when when i started our messaging over here
SPEAKER_04: There were some older guys from the national team, you know, they had been competing in the world since 1988. My first world was 1993. So whenever we are training with them, they were talking about this guy, that guy, and majority of them were Americans because the modern time arm wrestling is the homeland is North America. All the techniques came from there, everything. And so.
SPEAKER_04: if you talk about early 1990s if you talk about legends of armwrestling i can say 95 of them were from north america so yeah it was popularized here more than anywhere else yeah the other part of the world they were armwrestling but they were not really like there was an organized official armwrestling you know and the school and everywhere we were armwrestling yeah but
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, even in 1997, back in Ukraine, it was already, you know, popular, but it was not really organized. There was no special clubs. Yeah, that was just starting after early 90s, after the collapse of communism, Soviets, you know, and then the things started, you know, I saw, I remember in 91 wars, there was Soviet Georgia, they were competing in Soviet Georgia, I remember, and then
SPEAKER_04: russia and then other countries i remember taras ivakin first time was 1998 lithuania uh european championships he was he was incredible and um i just had um some messages from hunger where he said that he already had some wrist injuries and i think he's gonna have some surgery
SPEAKER_04: and he will be ready for five months I told him to keep the head up you know he's a incredible puller sometimes you win sometimes you lose you know it was like everybody was at some point of time right yeah yeah we we have a national uh like traditional oil wrestling like with the olive oil you wrestle you know and we say that like don't be you know
SPEAKER_04: worries or sad just because you are under or don't think that your head reaches the clouds just because you are over you know it's just resting you know and this is yeah anyways okay how are you my friend hi i'm good my friend i'm good very good good to see you me too me too telephone
SPEAKER_04: Excellent. Yeah, so basically there was just all these guys. They were talking from the national team. They were talking about Cat Silvers. They were talking about Leslie Williams. They were talking about Ray Taglione. I don't know if you ever heard these names, but Jerry Jennings, you know, Bert Whitfield, Cobra, Dave Patton.
SPEAKER_04: You know, like many of these guys, Johnny Walker and, and so I had the arm bender magazines from eighties and early nineties. And I read all of them, all of them, like all those, like I was guy over here and just reading about those guys. So whenever I first time saw them, like I knew so much about them and I look at them, like they, we both know each other, but of course they didn't know who I am.
SPEAKER_04: and so do you understand how it was just like yeah so i looked up to them so whenever now we have an event over there we need to honor these people and who inspired uh most of the legends that came after after them you know right yeah so we are waiting for travis belgians yeah and it's a little easier when you're here in their hometown you know the short flight there in florida and
SPEAKER_03: yeah for them to fly to turkey it's the whole is far far yeah very fast yeah yeah but here it's it's gonna be cool yeah but i i kind of feel that we owe them uh we do all them yeah we owe them so that that is why you know just whenever is the possibility we need to honor these people yeah because they always did it on the pure you know enthusiasm right there there was nothing yes
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, especially at that time armwrestling wasn't so big and as you said, they did mostly for the love of the sport, yeah. And yeah, now armwrestling is growing, it's becoming very big and yeah, we need to talk with these people and say that we appreciate, we appreciate what they have done for our support, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Anyway, so where is Travis? Serhii, Travis still didn't come. Do you think he is afraid of you? Yes, of course. I know. I know. He is afraid. He doesn't want to speak with me. He's scary. I don't know. Do you think that he is getting very angry with you? I don't know. I hope.
SPEAKER_04: Oh, you hope that's what you want. Yes. You know, he asked me, he said, Engin, this guy is talking so much trash, but can he handle the trash as well if I speak to him? And I said, don't talk about country, don't talk about family other than that.
SPEAKER_00: go ahead yes for me for me it's easy yeah for me it's easy yes no problem i want i want this because i need to promote promote this fight and it's neat and of course it's a great great opportunity for for trash talk opponent because every time i had opponents with
SPEAKER_00: who don't like speak, who don't like stay national. Because in my country and I think in Russia, it's not popular. Yes, more respect. It's not popular when you trash talk. When you have trash talk, people don't like this. But people very like when American or other people do trash talk. But when you do trash talk...
SPEAKER_04: Yeah. Pablo, Travis cannot enter and I don't know what is the deal. He is asking for with a personal nickname. He's like meeting ID. Okay. Can you see the meeting ID, Pablo? No, I don't see the meeting ID because you sent me only a link. Hold on, give me a second.
SPEAKER_03: i will try to send him by email maybe it shows there it was uh no link doesn't show uh uh oh my god let me call him real quick let me send the link to my phone number do you have whatsapp
SPEAKER_04: So Serhii, what will you do to Travis? Or don't stay, wait for him to come. And after that, you can tell directly to his face.
SPEAKER_03: i have two both questions for travis you have two questions yes for travis okay did you talk with him paulo yes i just talked to him i'm helping him give me just yeah i send him by email i hope he makes difference i'm sending him uh delete on his cell phone so
SPEAKER_04: Okay, he came, he came, he just came. Oh, okay. Okay, let's go. Let's go, ladies and gentlemen. Hello, Travis. Hey, what's happening, fellas? Sorry for the technical difficulties. I'm going to turn the light on behind me. Hold on. Okay. Said he is already happy.
SPEAKER_02: yeah i'm happy travis travis come to victor hey fellas fellas hey the fucking star is here we can start them we can start the whole fucking thing let's
SPEAKER_04: go where's the guy the guy here it's right here just just pull it up you don't see him with god i only see me and you oh just like scroll the screen oh okay no that's pablo
SPEAKER_02: Pablo and Serhii. I'll kill Pablo. That's all. This is the guy? I thought that was just somebody. I thought that was Pablo's little cousin. He may be cousin. I thought that was one of Pablo's kids. I thought that was one of Pablo's kids there. That's the guy? Yes, yes, that's the guy. Yeah, but he may be Pablo's cousin. They both are from original Ukraine. So...
SPEAKER_02: So this is the guy, Travis, this is the guy that has been messing with you and provoking you. No, there's no way. There's no way that's the guy that would do that, make all them memes. Yeah. Now, that guy hired somebody to make those memes. He did not make those memes. I'm just wondering if he hired you, Ingen, to make the memes or...
SPEAKER_04: I have no idea how to do those things. I myself paying those things for someone to do it, you know.
SPEAKER_02: Well, I know one thing. When I tell a joke and somebody laughs really loud, I want them around when I tell my next joke. And I feel like whenever this guy comes out with one of those memes, you are awful happy that he did. Because I want him to provoke you. I want the master out of you, you know, to come out of you. It looks like it's coming. Look at this. Serhii, what do you think about this guy? Yes.
SPEAKER_00: what I think it's a guy like speak a lot a lot speak he's speaking a lot yes yes yes and I like this because first time in her life he have same opponent oh so you are at his level yeah yes yes of course of course and how about the level at the table
SPEAKER_02: What level is the table? I think maybe Travis have prime form. Maybe he give me something. But now I think it's not possible. No, my man. You better hope that it's not prime form. Like, prime form means I'm raping and pillaging every single person there. You see...
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I know. Now, the thing is, can I get anywhere near there? I don't know if I can. It's not true. It's not true. Because I think maybe you lose with every top 10 guys now with your prime form. Top 10 super heavyweight category. Now, level of arm wrestling, it's more big. That's it. Travis left the room.
SPEAKER_00: what is this guy talking about whoa yes yes now it's new level arm wrestling this is not an old arm wrestler when we're training biceps and pulling it's new school you need will be ready for this
SPEAKER_02: well first of all why is pablo here this guy speaks better english than me that's what i said first of all i have to apologize to everybody well not english but i sergey i want to apologize to you and pablo because when engen told me he said i got the perfect first match for you
SPEAKER_02: it'll be easy. He said, this guy can't even beat Pablo. And I said to myself, if my opponent can't even beat Pablo, then I'm good. So that's what I was scared about when I first
SPEAKER_04: Pablo, don't believe what he says. And also someone who claims to be the greatest, you know, arm wrestler, he put in his top five list, he put himself to number one. So now if he comes back, he cannot even beat someone like around 14, 15, no disrespect, but not top 10. And then just like this guy, I mean,
SPEAKER_04: set me up like this this guy you told me i could kill this guy are you afraid of this guy you're telling me that well i mean i wasn't i wasn't afraid of him but then you i see the clip
SPEAKER_04: I sent you the video. You checked Matt Mask and everything. I sent him his name. You just checked him. I thought these guys beat him. You said that he barely beat Matt Mask and he cannot do anything to you. Now you are acting like you are Seth.
SPEAKER_00: You know, come on.
SPEAKER_03: are you gonna say are you gonna tell us what the he just said pablo or what yes yes i will tell you uh sergey asked me particularly uh he will need my translation he asked me to make it as close and as hard as i possibly can and do not cut any corners this was the exact request
SPEAKER_02: Ask him if it's okay if I do the thing. He's saying that it's already 10 years when he wants to stay at the table with this human. Well, listen, it'll be good for the show if I am just 50% of who I used to be.
SPEAKER_02: Because if I show up and I am charismatic and my nerves start to go, I am going to take over that entire place. And it will most likely form this tidal wave tsunami. And I most likely will run over this guy.
SPEAKER_02: just the whole fucking thing. So I just want you to know that I am sorry right now if I fuck everybody up and am the most impressive person in the world and you feel that Engin has betrayed you and your trust by putting you up against someone as ferocious as I will be. And I would like you to practice.
SPEAKER_02: All you have to do is go outside, grab a basketball and hold it right up to your head. Just let the basketball be right here. You try to palm the ball right here. If you have some problems getting a hold of it, that's good practice for you because I am going to be so separated from you at the start. It's going to feel really weird.
SPEAKER_00: So I hope you're ready, young man. Oh, thanks. I hope you too. You too will be ready because for me, I don't need easy match. I want to see maximum level Travis because I don't want after when I win, people say, oh, Travis now nice and Travis now not good form and something like this. I want the best of the best, Travis. And I will beat you. I will beat you.
SPEAKER_04: It's kind of number one for me. Travis, you said 50% of you would make it like a close match. How about if you would be 85%? Listen, 85% with my personality, no one will know I'm not at 110. So anything over 75%, and I'm already out of this guy's class. Because I asked you before I said this match, you will be around 85%.
SPEAKER_02: so so yeah but just know when we're setting up the match between me and you all i'm thinking about is the bank my bank account whatever i say in negotiations i could say anything to you guys when i'm starting to negotiate i could say anything right now i this creatine that i am on has me so confident
SPEAKER_04: I will say anything in the world to anybody right now. Yeah. Yeah. I don't want to say the name of the creatine, but yeah, let's go. Yeah. Fem cells and creatine. Yeah. Can you see the drop? Yeah. Yeah. Everything, your shoulder, everything looks incredible. Yeah. There is a super chat. Arm wrestling experiment. Thank you. What is Kalina going to do when Travis makes that fist?
SPEAKER_00: Pavel, please translate it literally. He says, what will you do, Sergey, when Travis makes this fist? In short, when he makes his move, right? Well, at least I have three moves more than he does.
SPEAKER_00: I can fight with a flop press, I can fight with a top, I can fight with a hook, I can fight with a triceps. And I also have a very strong side press. So I need to cut, I need to bend the wrist, it's just up to one place for me.
SPEAKER_03: Sergey is saying that he has at least three more moves than Travis does. Sergey can pull in the hook, top, flop press, triceps. Hey! I would focus on that flop press if I was you. And he said that he absolutely doesn't care about his fist and about his coming. Has he watched Levon's match with Devin, the first match?
SPEAKER_02: That's the most he could hope for. The worst could be Camille and, who was it, Vitaly. Vitaly? But just know that his hand will not be available. There will be no purchase. It's best for him to study Camille and Jerry Catarat very hard. OK, I have a question for you, Travis.
SPEAKER_04: Whenever I mentioned to you about Kamil, you said with left arm, you don't remember like anyone causing you problem with the dead wrist. And you said you don't see yourself losing against someone, you know, that has dead wrist pressure. Do you still think the same way after you watched the Latin match? I think we probably need to talk about that match after that.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, you want to cancel it? That may not be a good matchup after more closer looking at it. Camille could have won the match. Yeah. Oh, man, this guy is bad. He's a bad dude, man. So we should change that match? Well, I'm just...
SPEAKER_02: Let's just hold off for at least a couple of days because I got to take some more creatine this evening. By tomorrow morning, I might be ready to go higher. I mean, he did lose. The truth is, though, you're the boss thing. And so I told you earlier, boss, whatever you say, boss.
SPEAKER_00: I'm not going to say any match that you don't think you have a chance. Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. That's a little much there. It's a little much. Hold on, Sergey. Hold on, hold on, Sergey. I have a question. Ask Travis. What level of armwrestling does he have at the moment? Has he ever stood in the top 15 behind the table?
SPEAKER_03: I feel like my charisma has caused this guy to forget his English. He was perfect before I started rapping. He was perfect 20 minutes ago. Listen to me, Travis. Translation is here. So here's a question. Can you even imagine what level of arm wrestling are you looking at and dealing with at this moment? And did you practice with anybody top 15 recently? Super heavyweight. Super heavyweight. No.
SPEAKER_04: I know. The strongest guy that I've pulled is Pablo. You think that Travis right now is dreaming?
SPEAKER_00: What is it, dreaming? Dreaming, dreaming, like sleeping and dreaming, you know. Ah, yes, yes, I think, yes, I think, yes. I think he long time don't pull with top-level guys and think he have very good level. But, of course, it's... He is confused, how it will be.
SPEAKER_04: Serhii, it was 2019 when Jerry pulled his last match and three years later he came and he beat Gennady. Don't you think that this level of athletes with so much experience, so much knowledge, they know how to make themselves ready?
SPEAKER_00: Do you understand? Yes, I understand. What I mean by my words? It's not possible to have a very good level in armwrestling without regime.
SPEAKER_00: Travis, it's not guys who train every time and have a good plan for a fight. He doesn't have... How do you say it? He doesn't have a core inside that makes him stay in the mode and so on. For the current level, you need to give everything to become better.
SPEAKER_03: uh yeah he he thinks that uh you probably doesn't have a spine of this arm wrestling at this moment but because for this level of arm wrestling for today's level of arm wrestling you have to give pretty much everything he could be on the phone hey of course you could be on the phone sergey yeah uh yeah you must have went to university did you go to university in ukraine
SPEAKER_02: no no it is no doubt yeah so i can tell you one of the sharp ones i met from the ukraine this guy you're you're exactly correct it could have passed me by there is no doubt about it we will see but you should let him know pablo that i on wrestled you not too long ago
SPEAKER_02: at Ken's house and I was as weak as you could be, I come back over there about three and a half weeks later and I'm just a little different. Well, just know, Pablo, that I have been making little different changes
SPEAKER_02: every since then that is one year ago and i am full of fully confident that right now that my left side of my body is a brick wall right now and there is no one in this united states of america that slept in this place last night that could have a chance against me right now left-handed the right arm i'm more coordinated i'm smoother
SPEAKER_02: Will see, will see. Do you understand what it means?
SPEAKER_00: You said you have two questions, Serhii. You have two questions. What are those two questions? You already asked them? Yes, first question I say about what he think about now level armwrestlers. And second, yes, and second my questions, what I want to ask. You asked if he stood at table with 115 guys.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, yeah. Travis, I have a question for you. Travis, like when you train with Paolo last time, till that time to this time, like with percentage, how much stronger you are? Considerably better. Considerably way. Well, I mean, because it's been a long time. If you were 50 at that time, are you now like 70? I'm teetering between that 70 and 80%.
SPEAKER_02: Right fucking now. I'm pretty sure I could whack every guy in this fucking video right now. Wait until five weeks from now. Just wait until I show up and this creatine is just everywhere.
SPEAKER_02: everywhere boy i'm telling you i'm a plus i'm gonna be 290 like 291. can i ask you something is is your is your creatine is your creatine stronger than devon's pancakes well i got them from the same place same place yeah travis you know you know i have two very good creatine
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, just forget about the creatine. I know, but you've been on the creatine since you were alive. I just started five weeks ago. Oh, my God. Serhii, Serhii, just tell us what are you going to do to this guy on July 6th? They will announce, and they say, Serhii Kalnyshenko, and then they will say, Travis Bergens, you go to the table. What will you do to this guy? What is the score?
SPEAKER_03: It's best of five, right?
SPEAKER_02: yeah because it's not title match yeah you need three players three yeah i'm winning the first one i'll guarantee it so forget about that you got to try to win one of the first three if you do you probably got a good chance of winning the next one okay but don't be surprised if it's not even close
SPEAKER_04: That is, like, if Sergi wins the first three, like, if Sergi comes to three wins, we will do, like, best of five. But if Travis comes to the three wins, then we're going to maybe switch to the best of seven. Oh, listen, no matter what, once I win three times, my man, you're going to get, you have a really fucking good chance of winning the next one. I almost guarantee it.
SPEAKER_02: First three rounds. Are you going to have anybody with you? Is this guy going to have anyone with him? Wife? Father? Is there anybody going to be there? In his corner. First three rounds. I don't have you zero chance. But round number four, I give you something. Oh, I appreciate that. Now listen, I promised you the same. I get to win round four and five.
SPEAKER_02: You get to round four and five if we're down 3-0. No, you know what's different there? After I lose, I don't want to pull round four and five. No, thank you. This is a three-match situation, baby. Boom, boom, boom. Yeah, I just got to make sure that I probably can only beat you one way. So I have to make sure that I'm not so fucking overconfident.
SPEAKER_02: Because I'm telling you, one small flip up in the cardio endurance side, and it's gonna be bad. It's gonna be bad. Travis, Travis, what is the possibility, Serhii, to top roll your wrist? Absolutely zero motherfucking chance in the world that my hand will not, no, no, no. Here, listen, you know, you listen, you got two chances.
SPEAKER_02: You're going to see a surprise. It's a surprise for you. Broke arm, Michael Todd, 2006.
SPEAKER_02: You can try that, but ask Pablo. Well, that's left-handed. I'm nasty when I get over there. That's why I don't think I can be pressed. But listen, you got to fight it out. Make a deal with the fucking Lord, your savior, whatever spirit that you fucking reach out to and tell him you must be willing to die in order to win in the position that your fucking hand and wrist is going to be in.
SPEAKER_02: that is a 100 fact if you have that in you well then my man i'm just gonna pat you on the shoulder and say good job but your hand and wrist is 100 compromise in the every time that you think that going higher will help it will dig a bigger hole for you and then before you know it
SPEAKER_02: it's we're going to be just hand to hand and then you have no chance you must get your wrist to touch my wrist in some portion the bottom of that thumb something must get into this crevice if we are all up in here ain't no way there's no chance that you will be able you will never felt this before and you will not feel it again
SPEAKER_02: And afterwards, you will tell everyone, I hope that fucking guy doesn't get strong again because his fucking hand is crazy the way that it felt. Now, I'm sure the referees are going to try to help you. But listen to me. If they are super strict, it will be work for you. You handle it however you want. Same with you, Aiden. Talk to them refs.
SPEAKER_04: Don't get too strict, because then they'll end up fouling the guy out, trying to fuck me. End up getting them in trouble. Nobody will try to fuck you. Just stop doing the perception game. There is Will O'Neill. Travis, you better pronate his hand so hard. This is the guy said.
SPEAKER_04: and paul lin also sent the super chat and he says travis just has to let me know when he wants to train i will bring paul talbot brandon assessor and whoever else he wants oh that'll be listen that'll be great let me let me get on that if you want me not to come again if i arm wrestle with those guys and lose to those guys i'm not coming to turkey that's for me
SPEAKER_02: to just arm wrestle my machine and right here and then work on my confidence. It's too late to include all those guys. Okay, so you are saying that you're going to beat this guy, but you may lose to those lighter guys. Well, I know if I lose to those lighter guys, what kind of confidence could I possibly have to come to you? No, thank you.
SPEAKER_02: I've been, listen, my daughter and me have been practicing, and let me tell you something. I'm killing this fucking shit. You're beating your daughter, finally? I'm beating. Ooh. Listen, two fingers high over the thumb knuckle, false start. How about in hook? Can you beat her in hook? Oh, I didn't even go there. I didn't even went there yet.
SPEAKER_02: okay okay i will pressure numbers on my machine they're they're getting ridiculous okay okay question like when you say ridiculous just let's go to 2016 when you put dave chaffee is it anything near just tell the truth i don't know ingen man come on i could have beat godzilla that day
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I don't know if I'll ever be that guy. That's like, come on, man. Now, are you telling me that that guy doesn't? That guy killed this guy, though, right? Silence. Silence. The prime Travis, could he beat you? Now? No, right? I say no, no, no. But this Travis?
SPEAKER_02: Distress? Maybe he has 50% power, it's not possible. Oh, even more? Yes, it's not possible. Sergey, do you think that you've beaten someone that I can't beat right now, the way I am right now? Like, do you not think that I would beat Chance and Dave and... Oh, listen, listen.
SPEAKER_00: Listen, Travis, I will be ready 100%. I'm now training and have six trainings per week. I'm not underestimating you. If you think you have enough of your percentage to win, you're wrong, because I'll come with 100%. That's it.
SPEAKER_02: He's saying that I'm not underestimating you, Travis. So I'm training very hard. And if you think that your 50% is enough to beat me, you're full of shit. He might be right. He might be right. I don't know. He could be correct. I don't know. I really don't know. I really don't know. Training for Travis. More, more, more. I'm anxious to see if I fold under the pressure or if I'm amazing when I get on that stage.
SPEAKER_04: I don't know which one it'll be. Pablo, when you look at Travis now, don't you think that his trapezius and shoulders looking better than before?
SPEAKER_03: yes very wrong yeah how many kilograms there is a much better shape than uh it was what eight months ago whenever we trained last time guaranteed much better shape I don't know thanks wise because we didn't but between those two training sessions he's right and that's true because everybody knows that Travis doesn't say truth ever but at this point those two training sessions it was incredible difference yes
SPEAKER_03: Okay, when did you train with him last time? Like eight months ago. Eight months? Could he do anything with you? I beat him. I beat him the last fucking time. One time I let him gain position and I could not pull him out of that. Let's go! And that's it. That was it for me for the rest of the night.
SPEAKER_04: yeah okay yeah but eight months you know for everybody eight months is eight months and how he promised eight months eight months for someone who has who has been training constantly is not super important but because he's already training but for someone who is just making a return the eight months you can be 50 stronger you know yeah that's what i'm saying and yes sessions it was like four weeks apart probably it was like
SPEAKER_04: Shit, what did you eat, Travis? Oh, there was difference, huh? Big difference. That's the creatine. Okay. And Pauline says that Travis will win. I feel it. USA is behind him. I'm a translator. Hey, Paulie, I like it. I like it, Pauline. Appreciate that. Hey, Paul looked pretty dominant, huh, Inga?
SPEAKER_04: The way that he performed against Lachlan, I was surprised. I was thinking he would be more explosive and Lachlan would be a bit stronger. But in both ways, he was the better one. It's important too. It's important when you come off a loss to not let that second tier people
SPEAKER_04: all of a sudden you're in a war and then you're in that tier anymore so that's good for paul to keep separating itself and staying relevant because listen the competition is ridiculous yeah yeah i think i think that that is the really toughest stage um this guy has been talking non-stop and you seem a little bit quiet are you intimidated
SPEAKER_00: no no no no no it's no it's no i'm listen and for me important understand what he means uh because uh of course my english style is not very good you have disadvantage
SPEAKER_03: yeah he's listening very carefully to everything he says and trying to understand every word that's why he's a little quieter you know oh man i ain't with this guy he's in a biker game he's got this guy's got tattoos i'm out i'm out
SPEAKER_04: yes very fast very fast three round easy money for me and you stop training i'm racing oh come on man is it like the one that you did it for like uh the wwe video that they return
SPEAKER_02: What if we have a big draw, though? If we have a big draw because of me, then I'm like Conor McGregor. I can take a couple more losses. Right? Not just one. No, I don't think you're coming to Istanbul to lose. I take a gun and it doesn't matter. I will be ready for everything.
SPEAKER_02: He won't fight. Let's go fight. It doesn't matter for him. Which hand's better? He broke his left arm. He broke his left arm. Right. Some years ago. Yeah. And he still beat Dave and then he got back and arm wrestled Dave after that?
SPEAKER_02: Yes, yes, but my left arm, it's not to... I thought that Dave was going to break... I thought Dave was going to break his own arm against him. Did you see that, Matt? How awkward Dave's pushing was. Very weird. Very weird. Okay, there is two superchairs and large grenade. Travis was... Okay, what is your ultimate goal in this comeback?
SPEAKER_02: I mean, listen, I mean, I don't know if I have an ultimate goal, but here's the deal. If I die 20 years from now, 10 years from now, God forbid, three months from now, and you should have thrown your name back into the fire, whatever the term that you want to use, I got a feeling that there is going to be a time when I can't do this anymore.
SPEAKER_02: So because of that... And you will regret. Yeah, what possible reason could you possibly have if you look at the overall world of arm wrestling? My father thought that it was always best to retire on top and never let anybody see any weakness
SPEAKER_02: kill everybody, be careful, hoard all the resources. That's just the type of person that he thought that a champion, that that would be the best way to keep your championship and to stay relevant. As now that I'm 47 years old, I already know
SPEAKER_02: what it is like to be at the very tip top of arm wrestling. And I'm not even talking about trying to be a conceited about the, uh, about the, the, the actual arm wrestling as the person, because there are a lot of people like me that have won world championships and that have probably went to bed thinking that they were the best arm wrestler in their country, possibly the world.
SPEAKER_02: The world's a little shaky, but sometimes, I mean, Ingen, I think you probably went to bed before thinking you were the strongest guy at your weight class in the whole world. And regardless if everybody was at the tournament or not, you kind of felt that way. I understand a little bit of what that feels like. And what I know more than anything is it's not that big a deal. You know what matters is what you're doing today and tomorrow.
SPEAKER_02: What you did is not that big a deal anymore for you to hold on to it and to hoard it and not keep living. So through my life now, I have seen John Verzink be the greatest ever, get all the accolades and spoils, and still today he is signing up to arm wrestle August 10th.
SPEAKER_04: And he's going to do it. So who am I to not participate? And why not have something to live for and to do? So, and I'm a pretty lazy guy. So this is good for everybody. You are, you are, I mean, huge respect for you. I mean, the way that you describe your return, trust me, huge respect for you. I thought you were just going to say just a little bit easy money and this and that. The way that you explain this, my friend, huge respect, huge respect.
SPEAKER_02: You know, and as long as, as long as you feel this way, trust me, we don't lose the old. That's exactly how I feel. And I still have a tremendous amount of confidence left-handed and I can't help knowing that I personally think that I was better right-handed than I am left-handed. So because of those two things.
SPEAKER_02: It's just and I'm at the point in my life where I really can handle the failure pretty easily. And I'm still going to have a tremendous amount of fun. And I still have I can still contribute. Right. So why not? And let's be more than more than that, or at least equally, there is now a platform.
SPEAKER_02: that makes human beings like me proud to tell other people about the match and send them the link. I mean, come on. How many times have you, we've all been involved in arm wrestling that we thought was cool for us, but we didn't know if we wanted our neighbors to come watch, right? Because it was in,
SPEAKER_04: It wasn't as proud a platform. Love you, brother. Love you, brother. Come on, man. You are saying that that is exactly my goal as well. I was there. I don't think it has never been at this level.
SPEAKER_04: and now someone like you as you said before you get too old to involve again just huge respect for you my friend just like huge respect trust me you will you will probably get upset but my my view to you just change a bit right now yeah that's sad that's bad that we i thought i thought
SPEAKER_02: Keep your friends close, Pablo. Keep your friends close. If you go home today and tell your wife you love her and she says, you've never told me that, but you've been telling her that every day. This is what just happened with me and Ian. No, this guy is always, always like, oh, money, money, money. They think that he has been telling me right now in the last five minutes. It's just like huge respect. Like, I mean, it is exactly how I feel.
SPEAKER_00: At this age. Anyway, so Terry, it doesn't matter, right? You're going to kick his ass, right? What? Yes, of course. In short, I think that... Not that I think, but it is so.
SPEAKER_00: How much does Travis say? 30% or 50%? He says 50%, then 70%, but it's not clear for Travis. Do you know why people say that? He's preparing a text to say after the loss, if I was at 90%, I would have won.
SPEAKER_00: And he says a lot, says that I have 50% of the form. This means that he will then say, damn, but I was only 50% ready. That's what I do.
SPEAKER_03: definitely will kick his ass and he's saying Travis already saying and he's making the ground for it for his laws because he's saying he's at 50 right now so after match he will have an excuse and he will tell yeah sure I'm at 50 if I would be at 70 maybe I would have a chance but I'm at 50 I lost whatever that's right I can't believe you hooked me up with the one Ukrainian that went to universe I can't even do this
SPEAKER_02: i can't even do this manipulation against this guy i used to i mean the most of the time man i used to walk them guys right into the right into right off the cliff but this guy right here i might have to set this guy up all right is a teacher by his specialty by the you know university
SPEAKER_02: I got it. I got it. Lucky kid. Lucky kid. Lucky kid. Do you think that you will be able to look into his eyes before the match and say that I'm going to destroy you? You know what? It is going to be interesting the way that I feel around him. I don't know. I mean, I know I'm going to fake it. Even if I'm scared to death and intimidated, I'm going to come off like...
SPEAKER_02: coolest dude in the world. And I'm going to do really good in the press conference, and I'm going to be amazing. So, you know, I just hope that he continues to be a good sport. But I don't know. I just keep growing every day, and I feel like Barry Bonds probably fell. Do you guys know who Barry Bonds is? Nope. So Barry Bonds set the home run record.
SPEAKER_02: with 89 home runs, but the previous record was 65, right? So Barry Bonds is one of them guys that he don't take creatine every day. So all the guys in Ukraine and the rest of the world, they're taking creatine every day. Well, because of that, they hit 65 home runs. But then there's a guy like me,
SPEAKER_02: he doesn't do creatine that much but when he does he's the reason the other people take creatine so when he starts taking it like barry bonds he hits 89 home runs so i just hope that
SPEAKER_02: Because I'm on the same train now. Maybe this, maybe this, maybe, maybe, maybe. I was in the car behind. I was riding. And I could see him up there, but I didn't want to partake. I didn't want to drink the Kool-Aid, but I got the Kool-Aid now. So I just feel like I am most likely going to run this fucking guy over. Like,
SPEAKER_02: You know, I just hope that he still is okay with you, Engin, when it's over. Sean, he says, Sean Crowther, he says, if I see a punching machine anywhere near the stage when I get there, I'm going to be pissed. What does that mean? He's talking about, that's what me and Michael Todd said. We were having a competition the night, the next day, we, instead of arm wrestling, we punched the bag.
SPEAKER_04: oh no thanks for bringing that up the people still haven't forgiven us for that sean come on sean sean you're talking about east versus west you're talking about england there's these events i mean come on come on sean you know me better than that um arm wrestling experiment travis bears some solid wisdom and engen recognizes that yeah i'm surprised
SPEAKER_04: And Travis, when you are talking, Sergei all the time says that maybe you are saying maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe. Like he means that, like he's meaning that, like why can you not talk sure instead of maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, yeah. Well, look at my hairline, Sergei. That's why. Because I'm 100 years old. So this is an experiment. We're going to see if I am. It's your problem.
SPEAKER_00: it's your problem it's not my problem it's your problem travis listen i know i am fighting this war inside of my body sergey do not for me for me for me uh doesn't matter how many years old you have and how you feel you won't fight with me let's go
SPEAKER_02: We'll be ready 100%. I beat you easy. Whoa, relax there, young man. What happened there? Did something happen? Come on, bro. What changed? Come on. This is friendly. This is not even real competition. This is expedition for us. Expedition. Yes. Okay. Why is it expedition? Okay, okay. I thought it was real. Because I'm possibly the strongest man in the world. It really isn't fair that you put me up against it.
SPEAKER_04: A regular fucking guy, come on. Okay, yeah, that's the talk that we want to say. Okay, let's talk a little bit about the events. Quickly, predictions and then we finish. All right, hey, are you going to make me and Sergey's match first so that I can go announce? No. Come on.
SPEAKER_03: no just forget about the commentating now focus on your effing match you know just okay what are you kidding me that's the only thing i can guarantee i gotta i can do for the rest of my life is commentate hey hey guys can we be quiet for 30 seconds he's trying to do pull-ups and i want to see how many pull-ups he can do at 275.
SPEAKER_02: cannot do it yeah maybe maybe two see he did one that was a good one listen straight forward that ain't easy right there that ain't easy for a 290 pound dude come on travis how much 319 weight now i don't know he looks not bad you know his shoulders i'm waiting to see how heavy and athletic listen i can take my shirt off
SPEAKER_02: Okay, do it. I ain't been able to take my shirt off in a minute. I doubt, man. Let him take off his shirt and show us what kind of fat he has. Sergey wants to see you naked. Yeah, that's because Sergey probably don't even need a shirt. Motherfucker probably graduated high school at 192. And now he's just... I know how the fuck it works over there.
SPEAKER_04: Okay, let's talk about it before it's too late and somehow Travis's Wi-Fi doesn't work anymore. You know I will leave abruptly if there's any problems there. Yeah, just wait. Okay, Serhii, you start. Right arm, Vitaly Laletin versus Artur Morozov. Morozov.
SPEAKER_00: For me, for my opinion, Vitalik Laliatin have more big chance win this match. How much? A lot or little? 65-35. Okay. And you?
SPEAKER_02: Exactly the same. I can't believe he said 65-35. Yeah, exactly the same. Really shouldn't be that close unless Artem, and he does have, he's got all that heart. So there's a chance that he's down 0-2.
SPEAKER_02: maybe even down, get flashed in the third match. But if he stops him and he just will not quit, that's the only opening. But to me, Vitaly looks super impressive, super tall, super long, impossible to get a hold of. So unless you're ready to commit to that from round one, but I believe if you try to do it the right way, you're going to be down 0-2 before the thing even starts.
SPEAKER_03: So I'll go Vitaly and I'll even go 70-30 just because my man said exactly the same number. And you, Paolo, what do you think? Yeah, I think Vitaly has an edge, but not as far away as the guys predict. Maybe 55-45? Maybe 5% difference, maybe not. But I think Travis explained it very perfectly and that's what I believe will happen in the later rounds.
SPEAKER_02: And we still know, we feel this way still because of my man having a stomach trouble and not being able to keep his hand open against Georgie. That all could have been different, right? If he comes in there healthy, just handles Georgie easy, we're probably thinking about this late. But from what we see, the dude's hand suspect, this guy's 7'9", with the best top roll you could ever have, it just leads me to believe it's going to happen. We'll see it.
SPEAKER_04: Sean says, I know you would never do that to us, Engin. Just a little jab at Travis. Also to Travis, you may have to get a hold of Tonya Harding for winning strategy. I hope I am wrong.
SPEAKER_02: and the old travis is back i don't know what that means why do you think you're coming that's your job you're the one that's got a handle that's on your heart do you know what he means about tanya harding do you know what he means so back in the day before the olympics tanya harding was a figure skater her boyfriend smacked nancy kerrigan the girl who was supposed to win
SPEAKER_02: gold medal they hit her in the leg and tried to break her leg before the competition oh he's telling me that we need to do something to sergey that's the only chance i have to win guys did you not did you guys know that i changed the the the title match or 105 it it changed now it is right now
SPEAKER_04: david dadikian versus oleg petrenko right-handed the world title the guy that just defeated ongarbe will pull dadikian who just defeated uh todd hutchings i know i know oleg is from ukraine probably said he will be in that side but 100 100 percent
SPEAKER_00: Is it how much objective? How much is because he is Ukrainian? He now has unbelievable form. And he is trained with unreal weight. And it's, I don't know, he now more stronger, maybe 30% before match with Alijan.
SPEAKER_04: hmm so maybe we should say that also left arm match for him again yes yes not the amazing left arm the amazing left arm yes okay okay you know and what do you think about travis david i'm saying 51 50 or 51 49
SPEAKER_02: um definitely um the champ Dagestan whatever yeah just because of what he did just because of the the strength level with Todd Hutchings and you know when he just kind of just so violently sideways but I think that Travis but I do think Petrenko is amazing but but Travis think about the the Todd Hutchings versus Ongar where match was very close I mean Todd won 3-0 but
SPEAKER_04: And he was not in a risk to lose, but to finish him was very hard. And then just look at the way that Petrenko won.
SPEAKER_02: And so don't you think that he also, yeah, you are saying like- Yeah, I don't think that. I just don't think that Ola Petrenko is as comfortable in the winning position at 10 o'clock as Todd Hutchings is. So I think that when Todd Hutchings has someone down there that was supposed to crack him, and all of a sudden now he finds himself at 9 o'clock with his wrist back, he does not know that his wrist is back.
SPEAKER_02: and all of us are thinking there's still a glimpse of hope for that guy but there's really not in the only way and i saw that with with datacon and then him just kind of another level of freaking out awesome side pressure was able to get out of it so when you say that todd was in a little bit of trouble with hunger by him i didn't i don't know if he was so no no no trouble to finish him finishing wasn't it right right but i think that's awesome
SPEAKER_02: But he was not in the risk of losing, you know, yeah. But more of a mechanical problem, like Andrabayev in a better position against Todd to kind of hold. Petrenko, listen, this guy is awesome. Like, this guy, and now that we see Alijan's last three matches since that match, we can't help but assume that Petrenko could have did the same thing.
SPEAKER_02: that that alexander did to those people that he could have done it too and he was so close to winning that match so he could have already been a superstar and i think it's inevitable that he will be yeah but i also still think he could be the second guy not the first guy right today you know what you know what paulo's like when you ask the prediction to do the commentating guy you know i mean he is uh like right now what
SPEAKER_04: Travis will never shut up if you will. Well, he will never shut up, but he's an expert about this. He's very knowledgeable. He's just watching and commenting on those matches. Usually when I talk to the athletes, they are like, oh, I don't know that guy. Travis knows everyone very well, you know.
SPEAKER_04: and i mean i know alexander alexander you just you just call dadikian's last name is dagistan and people on the chat they are making fun with you they say no problem hey if that's the worst i'll butcher that man's name that'll be okay it's saying alexander alexander alexander dagistan alexander and paulo what are you talking about uh well
SPEAKER_03: very short but but longer uh I remember Petrenko in 2019 slot it or at 95 kg with his left arm uh it's amazing and uh incredible third place overalls right uh but uh our is insane so I I would say that this is the probably one of the closest matches we will ever see uh I believe that
SPEAKER_03: Petrenko may be a little bit more powerful, but Dadikhan will be much more explosive. So it's super close. Where do you think the match is going to go? Where do you think the match is going to go? Like which style? Because Petrenko started with really strong back pressure and then goes sideways. It's going to go to the hook because Petrenko, as he always says, I don't have start.
SPEAKER_04: yeah but it's it's super close match i will not i will not give edge to anybody i mean it's it's it's 50 50 match you're saying people are asking to travis you know who would win alexander or dakistan
SPEAKER_00: Hey, hey, Serhii, what did you call him? What badge did you call him? Hey, don't even say it, Serhii! I didn't hear it! Don't let him repeat it! Don't repeat it! Hey, don't even say it, Serhii! I didn't hear it! Don't let him repeat it! Don't repeat it! Hey, don't even say it, Serhii! I didn't hear it! Don't let him repeat it! Don't repeat it! Hey, don't even say it, Serhii! I didn't hear it! Don't let him repeat it! Don't repeat it! Hey, don't even say it, Serhii! I didn't hear it! Don't let him repeat it! Don't repeat it! Hey, don't even say it, Serhii! I didn't hear it! Don't let him repeat it! Don't repeat it! Hey, don't even say it, Serhii! I didn't hear it! Don't let him repeat
SPEAKER_04: Sergey thinks that you are open little creatine manufacturing facility. That's why you're advertising that so much. This fucking guy, you can't get nothing by this fucking guy, man. Travis, let's start with you. Sasho versus David Ksamusha at 187, world title. Inside versus... Who's first?
SPEAKER_02: You, you. I will go with, to me,
SPEAKER_02: To me, the greatest arm wrestler in the East vs. West event is also the guy who is barely freaking winning each one of them. So I imagine that that difference in size with him coming down, which there's not a real difference in size, but I just feel like if it was close before, Sasha's got to win when they get down here because it's been too close.
SPEAKER_02: like way too close so yeah i'm going stasio uneventful three to zero 75 25 just because of the the the difference in weight classes even though they'll weigh the same probably that day okay just how about you
SPEAKER_00: I don't believe Samusha again wins because it's not possible every time have very good form.
SPEAKER_00: Yes, but he won eight times. Yes, I don't know. I think for him, he needs rest. He needs a big rest because of his body. I think his body is already asking for rest. And for this reason, I think he will lose. Especially Sasha. I think he will be stronger.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, he said that his body needs some rest and his body is asking for that rest because it's been too long keeping the top peak form. Yeah, I agree. I agree, but every time I ask, you want to pull October? He said, no, I'm ready for July. Just give me a match July, you know. And then I said, okay. Crazy, crazy. He's got nothing to lose here either.
SPEAKER_04: nothing to lose yeah what do you think I think Sasha will win but uh Samusha have so much heart that it's hard to believe that he's gonna lose but I I think Sasha gonna win this time and this is there you need to win four rounds in his title master we will see and Superboy is saying hi Travis hi Travis Bejan is back champion what what do you think about Devon's fight against Levan
SPEAKER_02: you knew the result didn't you how would you compare prime dennis with them oh yeah i don't know if dennis had the the coordination to get through that first match that lavon did and i wonder if lavon messed up or if devin did something amazing but i was completely floored
SPEAKER_02: I knew Devin was going to fight, and I thought that that fight in the first round was enough. I am completely surprised that that was the best of Devin and that I was unaware of the wear and tear that would take place in doing what he did.
SPEAKER_02: And after you stop trying to make excuses and look it through those angles, you just go over to the champ's angle and like, damn, the champ is a bad dude. Not because he won, but because he faced that adversity. He kept his composure somehow. Like, thank goodness that he went through. For him, him going through that episode with Ermey after round four,
SPEAKER_02: convinced him that he needed to think.
SPEAKER_02: at all times about his energy output, how much of his attention that he was going to present to something that had nothing to do with him winning or losing. And I thought he handled it well. And I was very surprised. And honestly, it's a pretty scary thing for the world of arm wrestling because when you have a dominant champ, all we're looking for is some loopholes.
SPEAKER_02: some kings in the arbor. We thought with the cardio problem, we may have had that, but then you see that performance with someone that you're probably gonna run into the most cardio problems with, and Levan handled it magnificently, so hats off to the team. Hats off to the team. That one was 15 kilo lighter than the Hermes match. Anyway, so Evgeny Prudnik versus Irakli Zrakashvili, Serhii.
SPEAKER_00: 50-50. I don't know because I trained with Prudnik maybe two months ago. I don't know if he has good form or not good form. But now probably he has been training after that time.
SPEAKER_00: yes yes uh after one week i'm uh go train with uh prudik and uh we'll see what what he have we will have a little train but i think in this much more uh more more big chance uh iraqi
SPEAKER_02: Okay, and Travis, I don't think this was very close either. I think that. Is that or is as far from as directly as. As was to Sasha and once again, we just, we see.
SPEAKER_02: We see Prudnik lose left-handed to a fucking weirdo freak. And then we see him arm wrestle Devin, who is so big, so long, was so amazing. When he pulls someone under that super heavyweight class, it's going to be almost impossible for anybody to get through him four rounds. And then as a result, we think Prudnik's not that amazing, but he is amazing. And he really is not going to have much trouble in that weight class. Yeah. And Paolo?
SPEAKER_03: yeah i think prudnik gonna win but as sergey said it's a little bit depends on the form if prudnik can uh gain a proper form of what he'd been a couple years ago absolutely um i think prudnik will take it but uh you're getting colder so we'll see iraqli is steady on uh upscale so we'll see i want to see the match but let's let's go kaka things versus krasimir you know sergey uh
SPEAKER_00: I think Krasi. Yes, I think Krasi will win. Because, in my opinion, in the last years, Todd Hutchins' form has been getting worse.
SPEAKER_04: Sergei Teng, Todd Hutchings, losing the form a little bit every year, but he's going down. Maybe he's not. Maybe the level is just so high. I don't know. We will see. Yeah, maybe. More younger people. Yeah, I don't think this one is very close either. Todd Hutchings, easy, 3-0, uneventful evening. Yeah, I mean, yeah, I don't even know. I think it's really not close at all.
SPEAKER_04: Serhii says Krasin is going to win, Travis says Tad is going to win. And Paolo was shaking his head like he was saying yes when Travis was talking. Looks like he agrees with Travis. Yes, I do. Krasin cannot win Tad Hutchins these days yet. Do you expect a domination or do you expect a top match?
SPEAKER_03: uh it's always kind of tough match with uh todd hutchins it's never too fast or it's usually not too fast yeah he's going through bone he's gonna win pretty convincingly okay who understands what's on the table big grow goals travis what are you what percentage are you of your 2016 shape
SPEAKER_02: I have no idea. That's eight years ago. Ask this guy if he remembers what the fuck he was doing eight years ago and compare himself. I have no idea. How about your weight that you are training with? Yeah, I'm heavy. I'm heavy, dude. Listen. No, no, no. I got creatine running through my body right now. I'm 290. Just say your side pressure numbers, whatever you know.
SPEAKER_02: You know what I learned about side pressure numbers? No matter what number you add, you think it's good, but you can always go higher. But it's just for whatever reason, you're so proud of this number. So I don't even know. All I know is I am excited that every single day now when I grab the machine and I start moving around, I feel better.
SPEAKER_02: And, you know, I'm just telling you, it's going to be really hard. It would be really hard for Ermes to contain me right now the first match. Like, he is going to be totally surprised by the connection that this referee gives him and claims it's fair. And all of a sudden, with no connection, I am going to fire first.
SPEAKER_02: and my elbow is likely to be four inches up and it's going to be devastating. And if you attempt to stop it, it will give me all the information that I need in order to plant my elbow the next time. So I'm just excited about being excited. That's the deal is there's a place to demonstrate your capacity that is huge and a lot of people are gonna be watching. So it's gonna be awesome.
SPEAKER_04: Okay, Luke, how do you guys see Murato versus Matushenko after King of the Table match against Morozov? Interesting to see how that Matushenko is back, but man, he's impressive.
SPEAKER_02: Wow, like, I mean, listen, if you're a super heavyweight, you can't root against the guy that is that impressive because if he loses, you just got to put yourself in another category lower. So I'm hoping that every single person that Mata Shanko arm wrestles from now on, he goes straight down. That allows me to sleep at night knowing he's the top. I mean, he's got to be three or four in the world. I mean, just pound for pound.
SPEAKER_02: It's amazing. Like, we need to, like, he's the guy, he's the only guy that can beat Devin underneath the class. Okay, okay. But what does he do against Alijan Mouradou? Yeah, you know what? I think that, I mean... I have my opinion, but I don't want to say it. Once again, I'm going against Alijan, but how crazy is that?
SPEAKER_02: How crazy is for the predict against them? But after looking at what I just saw, I mean, I just think that more is often so. Coordinated with the match goes exactly where he wants it to immediately.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know. So I'm going Morozov in a war. Yeah, yeah, I'm sorry. Oh, yeah. Well, that makes it easier. I think Matyushenko, but it's very close match because before Morozov, Morozov, Morozov never pulled these very great hookers.
SPEAKER_00: Every time he pulls with top rollers and of course he has very good cupping. How about Brutnik with left arm as a hook puller?
SPEAKER_00: uh i i think maybe that again in hook yes yes but um prudnik uh not ready for this okay uh and therefore with daddy can it's very great much maybe more much for alijan and but with matushenko i think it's very close much but uh my opinion matushenko yeah
SPEAKER_03: Okay. I personally, I'm not going to say, but I'm not sure even Morozov can beat Alijan. And what do you think, Pablo? Yeah, I think you're right. I don't think by what Morozov is saying on social media, he's not saying it straight, but by what he's saying, I don't think he can beat Alijan. He's not joking. He's not joking. Okay, okay. I think Alijan will probably beat anybody on this planet. I think Alijan is underdog only against Vitaly Laletin.
SPEAKER_04: it's probably because of the liver links leverage and he keeps it far i don't think he will have cup and then i don't think he will have the communist this i think this is my opinion but once he has the power application position i don't know because he holds the guys talk with them and whenever he pins them he doesn't pin them like this he pins them like
SPEAKER_04: Unless he's going to play a little dirty and he will dead move Vitaly, you know, grip very low and we'll be able to twist it a little bit. Yeah, but Vitaly just keeps him really far, you know, really far. He doesn't have this high knuckle, but he just keeps him far. I don't know, we will see. Yeah, but we also saw with Petrenko, we saw with Petrenko that once Aljan lunges,
SPEAKER_04: and it doesn't pin the guy he doesn't really get any fancier he just stays out and does it again listen travis travis that ali john and this ali john trust me difference he's getting bigger he's getting bigger trust me
SPEAKER_00: think no my opinion no 95 more stronger weight now he was 105 kilo 10 kilo heavier when he won the second uh waffles in the supreme weight category i don't know maybe maybe but my opinion a little different i think uh matushenko it's uh
SPEAKER_04: very good we will see these matches here yes yes i want i want this i'm gonna set all of them all of them here you guys will enjoy you know for me this interesting maximum maximum interesting match yeah listen before i saw
SPEAKER_04: how Ivan performed in Dubai, I was thinking that Ali Can would be very heavily favourites. But after I saw what happened in Dubai, I think that it is like I still would give Ali Can the edge, but I wouldn't be surprised because Max Tushenko really surprised me with his performance. I thought that when the match was at the centre and stopped, he couldn't do anything.
SPEAKER_04: Round one, they were in hook. Morozov even smiled. And then the second thing we saw, his arm was going like this. I was like, what the hell? You know, he had the bicep locked and still his arm was opening. And later he figured out the shoulder pressure. And then he got the things, you know. Okay, let's go. Artem Taino versus Betkili Oniyani. Betkili Oniyani, Travis, is the guy from Georgia. The last event he beat Akhtar, which we thought that it would be a long match. But he dominated.
SPEAKER_02: I'm going with, yeah, I mean, anyone who beat me, I got to make sure that they keep winning. So I'm going with Arthur. Yeah. So, okay. Say again. Yeah, he beat me. I beat you. Yeah, I know. But yours, I mean, I really don't count yours, but I do count his because I did not.
SPEAKER_04: i wish i could find the video and then share it you know anyway so i have the video used to wear i give you i give you i give you a thousand dollars for that no no dude i got my son's in the nfl now he getting that numbers changed oh okay you're right i forgot go ahead kalina who's winning tyno or uh oniani
SPEAKER_00: um are you coming are you coming to florida i i think i think uh uh i saw a long long liver
SPEAKER_00: Yes, and I saw last event when pull Peino. He don't have, I think, good form, of course, with long arm. With short arm, yes, it's amazing puller. But with long arm, it's more hard for him. I think 55-45, like something like this. Close much, but... Yeah, but on your arm.
SPEAKER_04: And Travis said that Taino would win because he beat Travis in the past. I say anybody that beats me is a bad dude. Yeah. And it was overall championship. So I beat you also in overall. You are right. It doesn't count so much. And what do you think about that, Paolo? Yeah, I think Oniani. Oniani will beat? Wow.
SPEAKER_03: Would you say the same thing if you didn't see his performance against Akhtar? I believe that Tainov's best performance was about 10 years ago and since then I did not see him perform as good. I mean he beat Sasha with left arm, it's incredible.
SPEAKER_04: you know yeah i'm not saying that he's uh you know uh amateur arm wrestler i'm just saying that yeah you gotta pick one you gotta pick one and get my god he's going with the other guy no no i'm not saying that he he shouldn't pick him i mean he just said that like his performance was 10 years ago but 10 years ago he was competing with events and this and whatever
SPEAKER_04: don't want to go there travis are we going to see moldova shape that you did in 2018 furious is asking you ah you know what i was a bad dude there too boy i don't know about that i was pretty
SPEAKER_02: I will say you've been untrained. You've been untrained. Yeah, I know. But you know what else is that they had that eight man heavyweight thing there. And I let all those guys. And I saw Georgia, Georgia Fedkoff was beating everybody except me. And then I was letting all those dudes.
SPEAKER_02: You're talking about left arm. You're talking about left arm. I know. I'm just telling you, I'm usually not the guy that can go overseas and let the guy do whatever he wants and then just beat him. But I was.
SPEAKER_02: So you're saying if your left arm was that good, probably your right arm was as well if you were not injured. Oh, yes, exactly. If I wouldn't have messed up, and I should have never did that whole three-week traveling around with Ryan Bowen, training and arm wrestling every day like that. I ended up messing up my freaking pec. But, yeah, my right arm was good. I don't know if I would have beat Georgie because Georgie was good at that exact moment. But I'm telling you right now, my left arm –
SPEAKER_04: It wasn't just with Georgia. It could have beat a lot of people that day. Guys, it has been really long. I have many matches, but I will ask you a couple of them, and then we can... Yeah, I got to go. Actually, I got some kids right now. Okay, Adam Warzynski versus Vladimir Mayero, the guy that you call Alexander. Do you remember him? Yeah, I think that... Listen, I've said it before. Adam Warzynski, absolutely ridiculous American armwrestler. However, when you pull the way he pulls...
SPEAKER_02: really tough to get some wins overseas so if he is able to bring that hooking style and not only a hooking style letting you be in your hook is what he seems to do to the american pullers um i think that he will continue to have his hands full as all the americans do
SPEAKER_02: The hook doesn't travel that well unless you're Todd hunting across that ocean. Yeah, but he beat Bojidar. Bojidar Semenov in hook. There's no doubt that he did. And I'm not saying it's impossible. I'm just saying it's...
SPEAKER_04: I would rather send a silver bullet top roller over there and see if he can stay outside and work his hand than give you our American strong inside bullet. That's all. I talked lately with Vladimir. He says he is in incredible shape and he says right now nobody can beat him in 85 kilos. Because the first match he pulled against Samusha, he had like two, three months of training.
SPEAKER_00: What do you think, Serhii, about this match? Adam Borzinski versus... Maioro, 100%. You think? That's some racist shit. That's some racist shit, 100%. I'm pooled with Maioro, and he doesn't train a lot of time, maybe five years, doesn't train. And I'm pooled with this guy, and I say, fuck.
SPEAKER_00: he really stronger really strong when did you train with him when uh no it's uh before uh match with um
SPEAKER_00: Okay, you're talking about Swiss Open? Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. But he don't train. He was not even trained. He just came there. Yes, he not trained. He not trained and come to compete and win this compete everybody and go to super heavyweight category to pull with me. He say me, let's go pull and hook. I say, okay, I give you hook. I give for him hook and bet. And I need 100% my power and I often win.
SPEAKER_00: he have very very hard but he don't train before after he trained two months and go to esther's west pull with samusha and give for samusha very great matches and win one rounds but now
SPEAKER_00: I think he has more best form, maybe 50%. So you are saying that right now maybe he is right, that he can beat everyone, you think? Yes, maybe. It's my opinion. I think yes. I think he is many times world champion. And you know he trained with... No, no, no. He is not world champion. European? I don't think so.
SPEAKER_04: But he won the Moldova event, the first Moldova event. He beat Bojidar. Bojidar was second, and third was Clement Dimitrov. Fourth was Irakli, and I think fifth was the Latvian.
SPEAKER_00: But you know, he trained without creating and he's amazing. You know this? I don't advise that. I don't advise anyone to do that.
SPEAKER_04: Travis, the last one. Because there are so many matches, I will ask you the last one. This one is a woman match. Barbara Baggiova versus Egle Vajkute. Egle is the one that pulled against Sara at the East Roshan fight. And Barbara is the one that pulled against Gabriela 1-3-2 while she was losing 2-0. Yeah, I know.
SPEAKER_02: I know both well, and I'm a huge Bora Bora fan. And then I'm listening to Neil and Lil talking and talking. So he thinks that she's in trouble. So I am going to keep that healthy competition between us, and I'm going 60-40 Bora Bora. What's that, 60-40? 60-40.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, and you, what do you think about this, Paolo? I think Barbora. I mean, it's a close match, but because of the size and the style of pulling from Barbora, I think she's going to win. And what do you think about Vladimir Mayurov versus Adam Orzenski? I love Adam, and he's my teammate, but I believe Mayurov will win. In the hook, he is just something else.
SPEAKER_04: okay okay anyways guys thank you very much travis thank you very much and thank you very much paulo uh for being part of it you guys are incredible great very very entertaining and get let's get ready and see you guys pablo you better start picking your sides too this is i'll talk to y'all soon yes sir and then okay he's gone okay guys you take care of yourself and see you in four weeks
