SPEAKER_02: Good one.
SPEAKER_02: Hello, Claire. Yes, Thomas, yes. Hello, hello, hello.
SPEAKER_01: Hello John on Edge. Hello Nika Harnas in TV. Hello Ergo. Hello Xavi. Hello Enlarge. Pronator. I started training after I came back from Slovakia. Today I did some pronation training,
SPEAKER_01: Light, very light. Drinking milk with honey. It helps my throat.
SPEAKER_01: Hermes is one of the best. I don't think that he needs a handle, just because he lost with left arm. Hello, hello, David. Hello to Ireland. Greetings to Ireland. Clorox. Hello, my friend.
SPEAKER_01: It's here, Tom. Hello, Dantoo. Hello, Greg Jim. Hello, Greg. Greg, my friend from Georgia.
SPEAKER_01: Hello, Usman. to Poland. Hello, hello to Georgia. Hello, Clayton. Can I flex my arm? My arm right now is small, but I will flex for you.
SPEAKER_02: He lost so much size, but he will be back. Yeah, he will be incredible. King of the table, he will rock. It's a great event.
SPEAKER_01: Alaykum salam, Saud Ghani. Prokopchuk is very surprising. He was very dominant, very dominant. Alaykum salam, Saud Nika. Show your bicep. Bicep is small, but I will make it big, I promise.
SPEAKER_01: okay now how long time is three more minutes and elmas will come congratulations daniel hello melazer
SPEAKER_01: Hello, hello, hello. Hello, Mr. Gasparini. How are you doing? Good? Nothing. Huh? You good, good? Feeling good? Yeah, yeah, I feel good. That's good. Powerful. Yeah? Good to see you.
SPEAKER_00: Me too, my friend. Really. You look very healthy. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Now, I'm every time good. Yeah. Still good. People miss you. They miss you. Your fans. Yeah. So, how is life? How is everything? Good? Everything is good. Training is good.
SPEAKER_00: That's good. A little bit sad for the... Match translation? Yeah, for the Ennis, but... What can you do? What are you doing? You're right. I prefer like this. Now we will see what will happen. That's it.
SPEAKER_01: Not very worried. It's life, you just need to compete. Exactly. So I started training. Really? Yeah. You are in trouble.
SPEAKER_01: Side pressure? Yeah, today I did it. I did some coronation and then I did a little bit side pressure. But it was very heavy side pressure. I did 10 kilos. But you feel healthy without pain? I mean, not yet, not yet. But I'm trying to do everything so light, so light, so like nothing. This is a perfect way when you restart, I think,
SPEAKER_00: It's better not to push too much. But really, I think in arm wrestling, you need to push the training but not too much because you risk too much your tendon, your muscle after you broke something. Once you reach your potential limit,
SPEAKER_00: pushing more is unnecessary. More important is at the table to coordinate them in a better way. To find the small things you can improve. And that's it, I think. When you reach the peak, you need some details. No, no. Something more. You are right. I mean, just because you will lift five kilo more bikes than
SPEAKER_01: your wrist is not going to be stronger, you understand? Like, I mean, you need to train, but just you need to make sure that you do that without hurting yourself. That is the most important. You are done, you know, we don't see you. You don't see me? No, I see only like black, everything. Oh, okay. I see you.
SPEAKER_01: Go and come back. Now you see me or not? No, no, we don't see. I mean, I don't see you. Nobody see you as far as I know. I started training because I miss my big forearms. I don't like to have small forearms. My forearms are getting upset with me. They are like, why are you not training us?
SPEAKER_01: I think I pressed it. Now? Yeah, yeah, now, yes. Hello, Michael Workspace. Hello to Texas. Yeah, okay, what do you, what do you,
SPEAKER_01: Q. What do you think about the upcoming King of the Table? Incredible event. A. Amazing car, really. I think it's one of the best of the King of the Table.
SPEAKER_00: Because there are a lot of beautiful fights. Which one is your favourite? There are fights that are very close. Which one is your favourite one? The number one favourite match? I think the main event. Morozov vs Stenko? Very interesting. Mine is Petrenko vs Zongarbe.
SPEAKER_00: Ah, these two, yes. Incredible. I mean, if you look at it, all the matches are very good. Petrenko is very strong here, but maybe Ongarbe... I put a little bit in favour of Petrenko. A little bit. Krasimir is thinking a little bit Ongarbe is in favour.
SPEAKER_00: I am thinking 50-50. It just shows that it is... 50-50, but a little bit maybe because they have a lot of power here. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Because maybe it will be like Todaci with Ongar by a match. I think it will be like this, more or less. That is a very important match because I know the first time Petranco came, he lost against
SPEAKER_01: And after that he won right, left, all matches. And so I think, uh, he wants the title and this match is very important because he, if he loses his dreams will be a little bit delayed. And Ongarbev had the title three times and then lost against Tata Ashings. He was very, very upset. And then now he's coming.
SPEAKER_01: he cannot lose either. So they bought, they have eyes, you know, right there to the top. I think 105 kilo is probably the most competitive category. Like, super-awake, yes, also. But also 105 kilo. Like, many guys there. You know, you have Tata Sins, you have John Brzee, Prudnik, Irakli is there. Yeah, 105 is super difficult. Yeah. Yeah. It's super difficult. 95, too.
SPEAKER_01: But 105, I think, is competitive like super heavyweight. Yeah, super heavyweight is also very big. Super heavyweight, I think 105 kilos is more competitive because super heavyweight as a champion, he looks right now, until now, unbeatable. But in 105 kilos, it can go everywhere. Unbeatable, not too much.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah. Not too much, my friend. But he didn't even lose one round until today. What? He didn't even lose one round in his professional career. Oh, oh, oh, sorry. Two rounds. No, he's not very loose because I don't email him. No, no, I said rounds.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but I think... But it was very close. Not close. You won two rounds, yeah. Officially, you won two rounds. Officially, yes, but... Yes. Yeah. It will be very interesting in the future. Yes, Tilki Wilki is asking, is Ongarbe able to match Oleg in the hoop too? No. I don't know. Hard?
SPEAKER_00: No, no, in the hook I think Petrenko was very super strong. But I remember they pulled it in after the pull. There are a lot of videos. After top eight, I don't remember. They pulled it and Ungarba was stronger.
SPEAKER_00: But now Petrenko really is in very good shape and is very strong. Yeah. Yeah, it will be incredible. It will be incredible, yeah. The hook, side pressure. It is very, very, very, very strong, really. Yeah, but this match, I see both will go back, back pressure. I remember...
SPEAKER_01: Petrenko's back pressure against Chance Shaw and against Marcio Barbosa and Petrenko is very strong. From the other side, we know how great Ungarbe is, so I really don't know. If you compare the technique, Ungarbe is more. Not a lot.
SPEAKER_00: Really, sometimes it's very incredible when he fought with Irakli. He did some super movements. You remember when he was... Yeah, yeah. He came here, he was like this, he was like this. He did like this. Yeah, yeah. Incredible, incredible, really. Yeah, yeah. And I don't know, we will see. Let's start from the beginning.
SPEAKER_00: Schoolboy versus Ryan Bowen. I think now the people underestimate too much schoolboy. I think Leonidas was very strong. Leonidas, his hand, when I fought with him here in Verona,
SPEAKER_00: I felt really the hand and the bicep super strong. But the schoolboy really... Maybe... Maybe he underestimated him too much, I think. He was very close. But I think his favourite...
SPEAKER_00: schoolboy because he was bigger. Ryan Bowen really improved a lot. I saw him many times. But I think for the size, for the power, I think schoolboy has more. Pauline vs Lachlan.
SPEAKER_01: Another close match. I saw one photo about Pauline is like body be there. Yeah, but did you see also the last one? Yeah. And they both have photo. They both look crazy. I'm telling you, these people know that like every match is a step
SPEAKER_01: up to the title and see he's also big yeah yeah amazing did you not train in the past yeah yeah we we we
SPEAKER_01: We write together, yes, if we need some advice. Oh, okay. Yeah, we have good friendship together. Okay, I understand. So you can basically say that you're students versus Pauline. Yeah, more or less. Did you talk with Lachlan about this match?
SPEAKER_00: I think Lachlan, he adopted some technique and now I see him really. He won the last fight with... David Alaguli. The Georgian guy, David.
SPEAKER_00: I put, of course, Pauline in the hook is super mega strong, really, but I think Lachlan have more endurance. If he close a lot, he can win. Okay. In my opinion, Pauline is more explosive and maybe Lachlan may have more horsepower and endurance if the match is longer.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I think too, same. Okay, there is a match which is very important also for you. I'm sure you are just watching more carefully compared to the other matches. Zerano versus Ravas Lutizze. Zerano, he's super massive now, I saw. Did you?
SPEAKER_00: When did he fight last time? I think he competed against Ferit. Six, seven, eight months ago? Maybe more. After that, he injured his wrist. But I think Reba for the liver is more advantageous for this fight.
SPEAKER_00: I think it will be like when he fought Dave Chaffee. If he do like this, I think this fight is like 70-30 for Revan. 70-30?
SPEAKER_01: He's very super big and he can, you know... We don't know. In the King of the Table, every match is best of seven. So do you think that the endurance may be a factor?
SPEAKER_00: I think it will be very fast, fast rounds. All rounds will be fast? No, too much. Maybe they will go on the hook, maybe yes, but I think endurance will be 50-50.
SPEAKER_00: But in the beginning, I think Reva is more favourite. And he can go, his top is very good, very high. I think Reva is really a big favourite for this match. Yeah, Reva is 170 kilos. He was about two weeks ago. They called me from Georgia, the video call.
SPEAKER_01: And Gennady was there, many other athletes were there. And I asked them and they said 170 kilos he was. And yes, his finger is okay, yeah. It's better to put another category, my friend. I need to...
SPEAKER_01: These guys used to be... Now there are Alex, him, Lalleti... Scary? Levan... Scared? Every time. Scared? No, scared. Why I need to put another category? Gladiator never scared. Why Gladiator is saying to make another category? It sounds like you don't want to... Gladiator never scared. Yeah, but it didn't sound like this. Okay, anyway, so... I mean...
SPEAKER_01: Okay, I make for you 125kg category, so you will not be... Thank you so much. Champion forever. Maybe Devo, with Devo. Yeah, you and Devo would be, yeah. Maybe Morozov would come, other guys would come, yeah. Yeah. Anyways, yeah. So you are saying that Ray was his favorite 70-30? I think...
SPEAKER_00: When you say leverage, okay, hand advantage, you took the hand. Do you think everything is over just because you took the hand? Maybe he can hold a little bit, but because when he fought with Lallatin, Lallatin, he pronated, hold it. You remember? Yeah. And he pushed good.
SPEAKER_00: But I don't think Zerano has the same pronation as Lalletti. He doesn't have the same pronation, but I kind of feel his arm is stronger than Lalletti's. Yeah, maybe. And he will probably have more pressure. You see, it will be very interesting for sure, but for me, my favourite is Ramos for this fight. I understand.
SPEAKER_00: And Michael Todd versus Lars? I think Lars is the worst opponent for Michael Todd.
SPEAKER_00: Because Lars has his endurance crazy, he can stay like this for 20 minutes, no problem. What if Michael does the same thing? Maybe in the beginning, but I think he can do this when Lars is very tired. Maybe, you know, he can... Not in a fresh match? No. No.
SPEAKER_00: In the first match, I think Lars will go in the winning position and Michael will hold him. This is a beautiful fight, really beautiful. I think this is 50-50. Maybe Michael can hold for many times and Lars is tired.
SPEAKER_00: After this, Michael Caine will go first in the press. But in the fresh match, I don't think it will be like this. 50-50. Q. If Denis is not back, what is your next choice?
SPEAKER_00: We'll see with Engin and the King of the Table. We'll see what will happen. Now we will wait. I already did a video on my YouTube channel explaining everything. We will see. I'm not worried too much about the next opponent.
SPEAKER_00: Because there are a lot of wrestlers, they have already some fights this summer. And then you will look at the results? Yeah, we'll see after King of the Table or maybe after East vs West and maybe we can find a good opponent who will win like this.
SPEAKER_00: After this, I will wait. I don't have any problem, really. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And, okay, let's go again. Maybe this time shorter. Petrenko versus Ongarbea. For me, if...
SPEAKER_00: Do you think Petrenko has the same or less power like Todačin, only side pressure? Probably almost very near the same. This is very interesting because... But maybe not the same endurance. Maybe not the same endurance.
SPEAKER_00: Ah, amazing, amazing match, really. But I put it a bit, I don't know why, I feel this Petrenko. Okay. Maybe only, I see only the way,
SPEAKER_00: Where I can win is maybe after two free rounds for the endurance. Maybe Petrenko is too pumped and where I can go very fast. For sure, it will be a war. Yeah, for sure it will be a war. 100%. They will be like this.
SPEAKER_01: For sure it will be an amazing fight. I can't wait. I kind of see Ongarbe more of an armwrestling master, technical. If the power is close, he usually finds a way. But if Petrengo is too strong, you really need to dominate.
SPEAKER_01: Like, you cannot really play chess game with... No, no, no. If you play chess game, you need to be like, you know, chess game, no. You know, just one punch and finish, you know. If you start playing, if the match is close, and then it is very dangerous, yeah. And there is a super chat. One second. Enlarge pronator.
SPEAKER_01: Hello my friends, what does the Gladiator think of the comeback of the beast Travis Bergens? Does he have potential to reclaim the left hand throne and would he want a match with him in the future? What do you think about his future?
SPEAKER_01: Left? No, for sure. I'm done. Thank you so much. That guy was from Kazakhstan. This is not from Kazakhstan. Yeah, yeah, but really, I will go with right and more confident. It is mentally, it's just
SPEAKER_00: Not good, right, to lose like that with left hand? No, no, no, no, no. Really, because a lot of people tell me, don't worry, it's left. Yes, it's not like right for me. But he would also beat right hand too. No, right, impossible. But when you lose, you feel not very good, same. Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Because it is your left arm, but it is still you. Yeah. I don't know. You know, right now, left arm is becoming more and more. Yeah. More interesting. For me, right arm is.
SPEAKER_00: to see the importance, I think. It's a lot more important for me and I think for everybody. But left, still, now there are more competitions and it's more interesting to see, like Morozov with Matushenko, which is very beautiful. We will talk about it. What do you think right now, in your head, if Lewandowski comes back?
SPEAKER_01: Everyone competes. How do you think that the ranking would be left-arm? I think Levan and Laletin are close. Do you think that Ali Can has zero chance against Levan with left arm? Zero?
SPEAKER_00: I don't know because I think Alessandro needs to close his... He needs to go on the hook. And with Lewandowski, his hand is too big and the arm here, the wrist is too big. And I think Alessandro can beat everyone. But I don't think with Laletin...
SPEAKER_00: with Levan, with these two guys. I think Alessandro is top three left. But I don't think he can win. With Larratt, it would be very good to see. I think he will crash.
SPEAKER_01: he will win with like Kamil because Kamil is... We will talk about those matches. Okay, SilkyWilkie is asking, if you lose against Travis Bergent, would you go back to the booth with him to commentate or not? He will still be making fun. Like if you pull with Travis and then after... I lose? Huh?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, you pull him, and then you lose Travis, and then you go to... Right hand, impossible to lose. Okay, so the question is not... Okay? So you are rejecting to answer this question, because it's impossible. Yeah, yeah. Okay, just say that you pull him with left arm.
SPEAKER_01: You left arm you pull him, just say, example. And then after that, would you go to commentating booth and talk together to commentate the match with him? Yeah, yeah. It is every time super funny with Travis. Yeah, but you saw only the tourist Travis you saw. You didn't see that aggressive... I don't know. I never saw Travis could compete in real life.
SPEAKER_01: He will cheat more than Devon. He will cheat more than Devon, since Devon doesn't cheat. Yeah, for sure. Devon, he told me, he learned a lot with Travis. So Devon told you that he learned how to cheat from Travis? Yes. Okay, listen, did he tell you that he learned how to cheat or he learned technique from Travis? Both.
SPEAKER_00: Both things. Because it's surprising to hear that. GB19, Hermes, my friend, will you visit Canada this summer? I don't know. I want to go with Devon to stay together, training. Maybe in the summer, maybe after. We will see if I have some time to rest.
SPEAKER_00: But to be funny with Devon and to see everything. Let's go to the next match. Vitaly Laletin vs. Kamil Jablonski.
SPEAKER_00: Can I ask you a question? I don't know. If he was pulling Jerry with right arm, what would you think? For him, for sure, it's very hard. Do you think that Kamil is the same? Because he has long leverage and he can push more. But do you think that Kamil can be the same? Like Jerry, dangerous? I think Kamil is the same Jerry. Stylistically, same.
SPEAKER_00: And power, which one do you think is more stronger? About power? Yeah, about the pressure. Ah, Camille and Jerry? Yeah. Almost the same. But Jerry is right-handed. Yeah, I know, I know, I know, but I'm just trying to, like, if you say that Vitaly has the same power... I think Jerry because he has many, many years about this.
SPEAKER_00: When you do many years, does it make you stronger? Yeah, I think more experience. But Camille is super strong here too, with the left. I think if he will do maybe not the same, but a little bit the same as what I did with
SPEAKER_00: Prunator here, he can win easily, like when I fought with Jarry. But if the match with Toplek here and Kamil is in his position, I think it's 50-50. Okay, the match is 50-50 or if Kamil puts his shoulder, it's 50-50?
SPEAKER_00: If Kamil puts his shoulder, it's 50-50. Because Laletin's side pressure is super strong here. Do you think that Laletin can be like this and Kamil puts this and still the match is 50-50?
SPEAKER_00: No, not in the last position, in the centre. Maybe he can do like this and then he can... But if Camille is in a super good position, in the winning position, for sure he's the favourite, this Camille. OK, I understand you. If you are saying the man is right here...
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it's here. This is the most important part here, the centre. Who takes the centre is more favourite. Lalletin is super fast. And the hook is strong, super strong, Lalletin. Because people don't see... I think it's right hand. Ah, right.
SPEAKER_01: But I think left too. I don't know. I don't know. Okay, he beat Krasimir in hook, right hand. But to say that he has a super hook with right hand... No, no, no. Super hook, no. But I... Good hook. He's strong, strong, a lot strong. Okay. Because he usually tries to not go there. He tries to go outside. This is the problem. If he can change a little bit, go here...
SPEAKER_00: He can do very fast, he can win very fast and without problem. But if we go in the straps and come in, he has position. It's very hard for Lalli. I understand. Okay. And the last match, Artem Morozov versus Ivan Matyshenko.
SPEAKER_00: In the beginning, I think Moro's the favorite. I show him now the photo. It's very good shape. It is like almost same as last summer. Before his stomach thing, you know, yeah. Yeah. But Matushenko, for sure, I think I show Moro he trained in the
SPEAKER_00: for with the pronation static movement in the lost position because maybe he think matushenko can uh don't believe everything you see i mean it may be true but sometimes people show what they but uh yeah i'm sure if he trains here i'm sure he also trains here too yeah yeah yeah i don't think everything you don't train everything
SPEAKER_01: I think he trained everything, but if he changes a little bit, it's because he prepared something different for this fight. I don't think he will just go inside. Try to top-roll Ivan. I saw Ivan with his right arm hooking Laletin twice in a Supermatch. It was the first two rounds, I think.
SPEAKER_01: It may be possible to topple, but it's very risky, very risky. Because if you try to topple and then get hooked, you are getting opened like this. Yeah, so it is better to feel this before the match. And then if you think that you cannot get out, it's better to go inside like this instead of trying to open yourself. I mean, you're moving your shoulder when you're outside moving.
SPEAKER_01: And your shoulder is going here, but your pronator is going here. So this is just very disadvantageous position. And I think the match will go inside directly. You think Morozov will try to topple him directly from round one? That's what he told you?
SPEAKER_00: I think he will try for sure. I think he will try first, maybe second round, a little bit. And I think if he couldn't, I think after this he will go on the hook directly. I think for sure he will try. For sure.
SPEAKER_01: Because maybe he has a lot... If you were him, you would try early rounds or late rounds? I mean, listen, you are not now Hermes. Right now you are Morozov. You can hook and you can go out. If you pull in Matyshenko and you are Morozov, would you directly try outside? Or catch him inside? In the beginning, yes. Outside? Okay. Yeah. If it is inside, who would win?
SPEAKER_00: I think Moro has more power. But is he faster? Faster? Not for sure. Matushenko is faster. It's super interesting because if Matushenko is super fast and he can go in the winning position very close, it's very hard.
SPEAKER_00: But Matushenko is 115. 15? Yeah, 15, 16 maybe, yeah. I think Morozov is favourite this far. But he's very close, close, close. Like 55 for Morozov and 45 for... But do you see anything like Morozov, boom, boom, boom, like six times?
SPEAKER_00: Maybe. Very small possibilities, no? Yeah. I don't know. Because we saw Matuschenko with Rino Marzic left. He won with Kamil Wright. And that's it. He beat also David Arabuli. Yes.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, left arm, yeah. I think we saw him three matches, if I'm not mistaken. But his first time he competed with the top three guys. This is, I mean, for the super heavyweight category, I mean, yeah, this is the... With left arm, no, he pulled Kamil. It's not top three, but he was right arm, sorry, yeah. Right arm is different. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: The other matches were 115 kilos, yeah. Anyways, very, very quickly and short, let's go to the July event as well. Really? I didn't understand what you were saying. What? Yeah, yeah. Incredible fights, really.
SPEAKER_01: Because some people think it's too much event, but the combination is really great. If you understand armwrestling, yes. Yeah. Okay, let's start. Artem Taranenko, Toms Rosic. You know Toms from Latvia? He beat
SPEAKER_00: Oleg Zok, one match. With right arm, he dominated everyone at the Europeans. I think he's favourite. I like to match Artem, but this guy is very strong. Yeah, okay. My right arm? It's his left arm. Ah, okay.
SPEAKER_01: Thank you for your support, Silky Vuki. Thank you, my friends. Thank you. Let's go to the next one. Artem with left arm is a very dangerous guy, trust me. I see that he's beaten many of the heavier guys. Yeah, he won with Toda Akin.
SPEAKER_01: Ok, Karolina Pettersson, Olga Terpilova. Olga Terpilova is the current champion of the Russian Nationals at 60 kilos. But Karolina Pettersson, you know. Do you know Olga also? Do you know Olga Terpilova? A little bit, yes. Karolina, I saw, she did a very good European. Yeah, yeah, she did. Super good fight.
SPEAKER_01: I think left arm she won, right arm she had a very long match. I think it is a favorite. Okay. How about this match? Do you remember Alexander? That Travis was calling him old-time Alexander. Vladimir Miro. You remember him? Yeah. Vladimir Miro.
SPEAKER_01: You remember Vladimir against Hamusha, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was very close. And now he's pulling Adam Morzinski. Adam Morzinski beat both Bojidar and Artur Makarov. Ah, okay. Yeah, just forever in love. Okay, okay, I understand. I think this match will be very long. I think Alexander will win. It's Vladimir. Don't be nervous. It's Vladimir, yes. Yes.
SPEAKER_01: I think this guy is super strong. I think... We will see. Dimitri Petrova, Ayane Takenaka. Ayane Takenaka from Japan. If you see her, you will be amazed. She's very strong. And Dimitri Petrova, student of Krasimir, just killed everyone.
SPEAKER_00: He won with the Turkish girl champion. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Last year in Moldova, yeah. Yeah. The name of the Turkish girl champion. Yeah, she beat Esa. Who? Yeah, I think she beat him. I mean, are you talking about the Japanese or the Bulgarian? Because they both beat.
SPEAKER_01: Dimitriina beat her at the Europeans and Ayane beat her in the walls in 55 kilos. I don't know. Yesterday I set a match and I didn't announce yet, but now I will announce. Shanshov versus Ibrahim Sago.
SPEAKER_00: I show a little bit trash-talking between them. Because Zurab is a bit Ibrahim Sago. Yeah, yeah. And then Chance is a bit Zurab. Sometimes it's not like this. Chance is very effective against anyone who is coming inside.
SPEAKER_01: Super close. Do you remember the match between Tatasins and Chancho? It was a very close match. Close. Yeah. Super close, 50-50, really. I don't know who will win. Okay, this one. Daniel Prokopchuk, Bojidar Semenov. But this is left-arm world title. Last year in Saudi Arabia, World Combat Games, Bojidar beat Daniel with left arm. And now it's for world title, 77-kilo world title.
SPEAKER_01: Prokopchuk, I saw him in Russia. Beating Alan Zolev. Amazing. This is very interesting right now. Only four months ago, Mindaugas beat Daniel. Yeah, yeah. Now, Daniel beat Alan, and Alan beat Arthur, and Arthur beat Mindaugas.
SPEAKER_01: And Mindaugas beat Xherkasov in every event they beat in history. Every event. Every event. Three, four events he beat him. And Xherkasov beat Arthur, and Arthur beat Mindaugas. So, it's just like a circle. Yeah, yeah. It's too difficult to say.
SPEAKER_01: But if I need to put some, I think Prokopchuk a little bit more. Yeah, they didn't pull before. Only one time they pulled last year at the combat games and Bojidar won. This time we will see. Anyway, so let's go next one. Artem Tainov, Betkili Oniani.
SPEAKER_00: Left-hand 95-kilo world title match. Ogniani is Georgian. Ogniani is the Georgian that beat Aktaev in the last event. Did you see the match? I saw, but I think Tainov is super fast and strong. I think he's my favourite Tainov. A little bit. And Barbara Baggiova versus Egle.
SPEAKER_00: Egle, White, Kutche, Barbora for the super weight. I should say open category. I think Barbora is a little bit... Stronger, bigger? Yeah. But maybe, we don't know because Egle, she won with...
SPEAKER_01: Sarah, but after that we didn't show too much. Yeah, but she knows, she has experience to bring to table. She knows what to expect. The way that she beat Sarah, very surprising. I mean, I couldn't beat Sarah easier than she beat, you know, because Sarah is very strong. Sarah is very strong.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know how Eglip won like that. I have no idea. I have no idea. And this one is very interesting. Last five matches. Travis Bajan versus Sergey Kalinchenko. Travis too weak. Too weak? I fed him like...
SPEAKER_01: But I don't think... Left or right, Haim? Left or right? Right arm. Ah, right. Yeah, but listen, you felt his left. His left is supposed to be stronger. And your left is supposed to be weaker. I don't know.
SPEAKER_01: I think Kalina. Kalina is going to beat him? Do you follow the things that Kalina is doing to make Travis? Do you follow him? No. Oh, he's crazy. But don't... You didn't see? He did some video. He did some video, crash you, like this. Many, many. He already did five, six of them, you know. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: And then Travis wrote, Travis wrote, Travis wrote, let's fucking go, he said. Okay. Because, but we'll be close, because Kalina, he has sometimes some problems in the wrist. Trevi will start like this.
SPEAKER_00: No, no, no. And we will see. We will see. Okay. Tata Kings versus Krasimir Kostadinov. I think if...
SPEAKER_00: Because now Krasimir is in good shape. I think 50-50, if we have more endurance, we'll win. Maybe we'll win, maybe first Dodacin or maybe Krasimir, but I think maybe they will go like...
SPEAKER_00: Five rounds. Or six. Five rounds. Yeah, best of five. The one who wins three times, you'll win. Maybe, you know, maybe Todaci will win the first and the second. After this, the hooker who has more endurance has a lot of potential to win, really. 50-50. Irakli Zdrakashvili, Evgeni Prudnik.
SPEAKER_01: Amazing. This is amazing. 105 kilo. Hey, your arm looks huge. Show me your forearm. Ooh. Animal. And I'm lighter now. Yeah, yeah. But the quality, huh? Incredible. Yeah, yeah. Very big. Yeah. Yeah. The brachioradialis also flexes. Yeah, yeah. Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_01: The brachioradialis from here looks like there's another forearm here, one more. Yeah. Back pressure, my friend. Yeah, yeah. He's only back pressure. Okay, the other day I was talking, I was talking with, with, I think, Krasimir, yeah, Krasimir, and he was saying that you're,
SPEAKER_01: Back pressure is not strong enough. That's why you lost or something against Devon. I told him that it is more about here, here, here, here, you know, more here. He said, no, if you had more arm, you would take his wrist. And I don't think, yeah, this is what I told him. I told him like this. Because I felt already his head up, my wrist like this.
SPEAKER_00: Because he was too strong in the pronation, the rising, and I pulled it, but I pulled it with the... If you see, when I pulled it like this, my wrist was already broken. And you can't... It's possible to push. Yeah, yeah, yeah. This is exactly what I told him, yeah. Okay, let's go to Irakli versus Prudnik.
SPEAKER_01: Because now Rakhli really improved a lot with the hooker I showed. Somebody just corrected me. Did you lose to Devin because of here or because of your pronation? More capping. More capping, right? This is exactly what I mean. For pronation, I was strong.
SPEAKER_01: This is what I'm saying. I don't even see last time who hooked you with right arm. No, no, no, no, no, no. I think capping. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Capping more. Capping and maybe a little bit even riser. Riser, I think it was strong. Not like now, but it was 80% capping, I think. Yeah. Do you think that in the shape that you pull against Devon,
SPEAKER_00: Could you beat La Leche? No, right? No, because really, in the three, four months, I had a lot of improvement. I showed the weight here, here.
SPEAKER_00: I started after Devon when I lost the training and some exercises my wrist shaking a little bit like this because you know when you don't train your muscle too much when you restart it's a little bit you know you don't have endurance. How much progress do you have with here in the three months?
SPEAKER_00: How much progress? Here I started with 37 kilos and with Laletin now it's 57, but with Laletin it was 55 kilos. 55 is still a lot. It's probably 27, 28% probably. It's a lot.
SPEAKER_00: It was only to restart to train because I don't train for one year, maybe more. I taught only about back pressure. But here it's too much important. It was a very good lesson to learn today because now really I'm more completely in my arm. Okay, let's go directly to Spurudnik. Who is winning here?
SPEAKER_00: I think, I don't know why, but I think he's a little bit more of a favourite than Irakli, because he has more competition, he's more active, but his hooking ability is super strong.
SPEAKER_00: A little bit, a little bit. But it's 50-50, I think. 51-49, maybe, you say? Yeah, like this. And do you think... It's only because I saw Prudnik not in good shape one month ago, last period. Only about this. But I'm sure he will get into good shape.
SPEAKER_01: You know how it is. When Amansky has a match, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Do you think that Prudnik doesn't have a chance to top-roll Irakli? Like Dadikian did, like Ongarbev did, or not possible? Maybe yes. Maybe yes, because Irakli, with the hooker,
SPEAKER_00: is super because he has a lot of back pressure, pronation here, but sometimes he loses here. He's not very strong in the rising here. And if you see when he changes the technique in the top, he won't be easy. Yeah. Okay, let's go. This match is very, very important.
SPEAKER_01: like, historically, you know, like, one of the most important matches, in my opinion. Do you think Sasho, very young, but already, because of what he has been doing in VAR for 10 years, in my opinion, he is already a legend. Because, like, he's winning, you know, right, left, right, left, you know, he's incredible in that category. And whenever I look at David Samusha,
SPEAKER_01: that Dawid Samusha has won Worlds, he has won Europeans, then won Zloty Tur, and then eight matches in a row. It's like I'm tired of counting. Was it seven, eight, or was it nine? The guy is just coming and beating, coming and beating everyone. And now they are going to put... He needs only one thing, Samusha, to promote more himself.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah. Because he's a super champion, but nobody cares about him because he doesn't promote. Nobody knows anything about him. Really, it's interesting to see how he's training, what he's doing to prepare for the match. I think most likely I will just fly to Georgia again. And then this time also, you know what I want to do?
SPEAKER_01: I hope I can do it. I want to go to Kazakhstan. I want to go to Georgia. I want to go to Europe. Maybe Europe I will ask to Rymus and just go and then start doing the interviews and talk, training, filming, you know. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Even if possible, I will go to Siberia. I want to go. I need to do these things. And I have a lot of work to do, but I want to do all these things.
SPEAKER_01: to maybe La Latin, you understand? We will come there. And I will also talk with Samusha. I want to spend time and talk here. So, what do you think about this match? 85 kilo world title. Do you think that finally Samusha will be in South Korea? 85? 85 kilo world title. Because Samusha, Sasha just was 90 kilo. 89 point something kilo. On the Europeans.
SPEAKER_00: Ah, okay. It's not a very big problem for Sasho to go down. I mean, he needs to lose three, four kilos, four kilos maybe. Ah, okay, okay. I thought maybe 10 kilos. No, no. At the last Europeans in Slovakia, he was like 89 points, something, you know? Ah, okay. Yeah. Okay. This fight for Samusha, I think it will be the hardest. Hardest, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. And I think Sacho has a lot of endurance, the hook is amazing, the ability to hook is amazing. If Sacho comes prepared, in good shape, I think he will win. Hmm. OK. I understand.
SPEAKER_01: But do you expect a war or do you expect domination? Yes, yes. But Sancho is my favourite. Okay. And Vitaly Laletin vs. Artem Morozov, right? This is one of those really big matches, especially after you saw Artem Morozov, how he looks. I think that
SPEAKER_01: I think that, I mean, the guy is right now huge. You saw how he looks and... Yeah, yeah, show this photo. Yeah, so this is not normal. This is really, really, really top shape Morozov. And, you know, he has one more month, one more month to...
SPEAKER_01: Laletin, after his Dubai match. And from the other side, we know Laletin is very difficult to open. Very difficult. Very difficult to hook him. Very difficult to top roll him. Hook, I think, is almost impossible. To hook him? I think almost impossible for everyone.
SPEAKER_00: Yes, really. And to go on the straps, I almost broke my finger with him, really. I felt my finger crash, really. I never expected because my back pressure was super strong and when I pulled with him, I really
SPEAKER_00: It's like to have the finger blocked in some mechanic... Yeah, yeah, yeah. You need to be very careful. He can really break. It's not a joke. He can really break somebody's... If you pull directly inside pressure, maybe he... He will break it. He will break it, yeah. For sure. You need only to...
SPEAKER_01: Ah, too difficult to say. First of all, what is the best way? Do you think Artung can go to the strap like this? Because I think, listen, to get out, Laletin's hand to back here, you are just going against his fingers.
SPEAKER_00: But once you go here... This is a very dangerous movement because if he takes a little bit down and then he does this... When did you see Ladecin doing that? When did Ladecin do this? No, no, no, no, no, no. In the side, maybe you do like this. But if you are like Jerry... No, no, but you don't do like this. You don't do like this. You just go like this and then boom, you know, like this.
SPEAKER_00: But it's very dangerous to do, really. Maybe you lose one round because maybe he can hold it the same. Straps. Just say he went to strap. Straps.
SPEAKER_01: I want to see. Yeah, yeah, you want to visualize. You know, I want you to make it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know, yeah. Yeah. Now, just imagine you are in the auditorium. Auditorium. Yeah. Yeah, they came to the table, and then now they are putting the strap. And now? I think Moro.
SPEAKER_00: I don't think he take the risk of lality, maybe a little bit more lality. And then Morozov like this? And then Morozov can hold like this. War, huh? Chaos. Yeah, more or less like this. And then listen, I think Morozov has better endurance, but in this case,
SPEAKER_01: If Morozov is in a bad position and Vitaly is in a good position, maybe Morozov will be spending more energy. Maybe. So, it is very, very hard to calculate. Very hard to calculate. Five rounds. Yes, you need to win three rounds. It's not a title match. Yeah, yeah, yeah. By the way... 50-50, really amazing. Amazing, amazing, really.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, I understand. I will talk only about the Florida East vs West 14 main event match, Jerry vs Kurdeca. Same thing. It depends.
SPEAKER_00: After my match, the people underestimate too much Jerry. People underestimate too much Jerry Fink now. Do you think Alex Kurdeca is able to do what you did? This I don't know. But he has a connection here, Kurdeca, I think.
SPEAKER_00: to do press. But if you do a mistake, maybe you go here and Jerry, he goes inside, he will lose like Kivini did. You remember when Gennady
SPEAKER_01: he went inside and the judge pressed him. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He went like this and he pressed him down like this. Yeah, listen, you need to be very careful with Jerry. People think that, people think that, like, you remember you, I and Levan, we were talking about, and Levan said that even if he makes a mistake, it's possible Jerry, you know, to press even Levan, you know, he said. Yeah, yeah. I don't understand why people doesn't give,
SPEAKER_00: credit to Jerry? I don't understand. Because he lost very badly with me and the people immediately put him down. He won with Kivinia, he won with Gheorghi and if you aren't this
SPEAKER_00: position war with him is you are very big trouble really you need to push maximum immediately to win more faster than him more fast possible if you do some mistake with him it's very big trouble for everybody and i i think that you are um i think that
SPEAKER_01: very dangerous opponent for Jerry because you are very strong here. You know, he's coming to your arm. Once you have your wrist, you're a very dangerous guy. Very dangerous. To beat you,
SPEAKER_00: I think really it's not to put myself too much up or to be, yeah. But I think if I have control, I never lost with nobody. When I have control, I can do press. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Once you have the wrist, yeah. You lost two times, Levan and Devin, those times you lost your wrist. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. That's it. Yeah. There is a super chat.
SPEAKER_01: Kevin Tamke, Engin, to qualify, do we need to win East versus West tourney or do you still follow WAF for future talents? I would like to see Daniel Ustinov and Mikhail Infantrov. My friend, top two finishers like this year from the European Championships in seniors and top two finishers from the Asian Championships.
SPEAKER_01: uh they are qualified to compete the east versus west finals yes i also follow the wav and everything but i mean it is uh i think more fair to other people uh so that they they can get qualified uh like we will have on july 6 we will have the finals and i heard that mikhail and daniel just you know they both went to the
SPEAKER_01: Uzbekistan now to compete the Asian Championships, if it is true, and if they place top two, and they will be qualified to compete East versus West in Istanbul, July 6, maybe you should come. Yeah, maybe. Yeah, we can talk. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. But I cannot I cannot pay you $20,000 like last time, you know, just to watch the event.
SPEAKER_01: You charge too much, 20,000 euros, commentating two matches. I'm joking. It's very difficult to commentate, really. I expected... Maybe with Coach Rey, maybe it's better, but with Travis and... Travis is competing. Listen, Travis competes and you do commentating. Give him tons of shit. Oh, shut up, Travis.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, like when he did this time. Yeah. See, people over here say that 19,000 is enough. Yeah, 19,000. Anyway, Hermes, it was great to see you again. It's great that you're laughing, your happiness, your positive personality.
SPEAKER_00: is unreplacable in the community and good that you are part of us and thank you for being my guest thank you so much for you hanging you do every time super good job really
SPEAKER_01: You are one second. Really? Thank you, my friend. Thank you. I missed the Super Show. I'm sorry. I sometimes just go into the... Yeah, I saw that. Yeah, yeah. Sorry, sorry, sorry. DB Talks. I saw the video where Matt Mask was pinning Arif Ertem right after his rematch with Hermes. Would Matt and Arif be a good match? It can be a good match, but right now Matt is going down to 105 kilos and Arif
SPEAKER_01: Arif is super heavyweight and also Arif is planning to compete with Vah. Whenever Arif needs a match, I will consider for sure. But right now, I think he's focused on Vah. He also has some wrist injury. I don't know how he has been doing lately. I need to talk with him. It is really not an easy job, Ernest, to see which athlete in which form. You understand? Because... Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Everybody has some problem. And some guy doesn't want to pull this guy and some doesn't want this guy. No, I don't listen. I tell them, sometimes you can't go easy. You think you cannot beat this guy and you're telling me this. If you want to be a champion, you need to take your balls and go to fight. That's it. You're right. You can't go for...
SPEAKER_01: for the first place without competing. Okay, this guy is okay for me stylistically, this guy is bad for me stylistically. Come on, you cannot call yourself the best if you are ignorant. If there is someone you think you cannot beat, you need to beat that guy to become a champion. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Thank you very much, Ermes. Thank you, Engi. Keep in touch. Next week, get your pay-per-view. Guys, King of the Table 11. I will just...
