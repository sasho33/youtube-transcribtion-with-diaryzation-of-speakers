SPEAKER_01: Hello, hello, Ojeda. How are you? Hey, Engin. Good, good. How is everything? How are you doing? You are not tired? I'm tired. I'm tired, but just like when you love something, like what makes you train hours and hours and hours? The love and passion you have for the sport, right? Yeah, of course, of course. You are...
SPEAKER_01: You are more active even than Joe Rogan with those podcasts. I mean, that guy, I think he's just making good money. This is what I realized. My main motivation has never been money. Whenever I started armwrestling in the early 90s, no money, nothing at all. Many years later, armwrestling became an official sport in my country.
SPEAKER_01: i even went to us to live there just for arm wrestling yeah yeah for for in 97 i stayed there six years you know i was competing from event to event you know just like i love arm wrestling just let me let me go this the door of the kitchen
SPEAKER_00: so soon daniel is coming okay just give me a second because like people are asking me where to watch so i will just give me some second to give them some link maybe i could share as well okay
SPEAKER_01: So, so how are you doing again? What's your, what's your weight right now? 94. Yeah. I mean, I mean, your arms are not big arms. I just started training like about a month ago after I come back from Slovakia Europeans, I was, I was, uh, you know, technical director for the team. And after I come back, I, I started to train.
SPEAKER_01: you know I had the hair transplant doctor told me to not to train after yeah after the transplant and then I stopped training and then you know once you stop and then you get really like this and then it's hard to start again you know so you need some time you need some time yeah yeah yeah when you when you come to 50 years old then then then you will understand better it's harder even to get up from the bed is harder you know everything is harder yeah
SPEAKER_01: But, but, uh, I still have that competitive spirit, but just, I just can't really like give my all at the same time to both organize an event and competing. But like, I am like, I'm 50 October, I will be 50. And then I'm like, you soon, even if you want it, you cannot do it while you can still do a few more years, just come on, move, move, you know?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, but to compete in a high level, you have to be fully committed. And to organize high level events, you have to be fully committed as well. So if you want, you can't keep this balance, you know. You're right, you're right. But just think about from my side.
SPEAKER_01: Armwrestling is not a hobby for me. Armwrestling is something that I see like part of me, like how my hand is or arm is, and armwrestling, me and armwrestling is not two separate thing. Like armwrestling is in me. So I feel responsible. I feel like I owe this to community. And now somehow my destiny brought me a point that after the COVID,
SPEAKER_01: like i had to do this and then once i do that so now if you were me my love for arm wrestling is huge but just if you put on scale organizing this event and my personal goals which one would be heavier of course that the one that is the uh like community arm wrestling is more important than my personal goals yeah yeah now it's something like your atlas you are you are holding the arm wrestling community
SPEAKER_01: and even if you let the one arm to pull a little bit like the whole world will collide you know like so i i kind of sacrifice i kind of sacrifice my personal dreams and you understand what i'm saying what i do or as an organizer is more important for me my personal goal right now this size
SPEAKER_01: and the other one is this side you know so there is no there is no hard choice here you know but I will try to do both of them yeah you plan you're planning on competing soon of course of course I'm training every day every day I'm training normally every three four days now I'm training every day but one thing you know just I just go to risk next day I do chess next day I do this every day I train
SPEAKER_00: and i will come back do you think that i will let you go like that at all those times you talk you know trash about me and then you're gonna do this you're gonna do that to me oh i'm waiting for you i just hope you're healthy and ready listen you look good huh for 78 kilo yeah everything's fine i'm glad everything is like going really smooth like so
SPEAKER_01: I hope I would be able to transfer all this to the table as well. I mean, you know, listen, at your level and at Daniel's level, everyone. Hello. Hello, Daniel. Hello, Tiberius. Hey, boys.
SPEAKER_01: We were talking behind you. We were just saying all kinds of negative things. Yeah, I didn't know they were here. I'm really grateful I shut up on time. Yeah, yeah. So what I just said, at the level of Daniel, at the level of you, you both know what to bring to the table. What makes the difference that the other guy's preparation may be better? Other than that, you know what to do. You know what it takes, you know.
SPEAKER_01: Daniel, this guy is saying that he is just going to destroy you. He says that... Okay, okay. Yeah. Every time we start the same. Yeah, let's start. Let's start. Okay, what's your weight now? 78? Yes, yes. 78. And how is your shape?
SPEAKER_00: I can say it's better than before, better than ever. And you're going to beat this guy? I'm not the one to say this, but... Oh, he is the one who is claiming that he is the strongest. He is the one who holds big. In my head, in my head, I am beating him every day on a daily basis. I'm beating him like a thousand times in my head.
SPEAKER_00: That's why I told you I hope I will be able to transfer my thoughts on the table as well. But this guy has some other expectations of the match, how it will go. So someone's going to eat and someone's not. So we'll see. We'll see. And Daniel, what's your weight right now? 79. 79. Okay. See, Daniel's English is getting better and better and better. You want to go to 79?
SPEAKER_01: um daniel is that true that you and you and uh your friends oleg to darian went to bojidar and said that you have the best hook 185 kilos yeah yeah true yeah was it when was this before the before the saudi arabia match yeah okay
SPEAKER_01: after the world championship yeah yeah oh okay after the world championships he said and now okay so what happened in saudi arabia are you asking me or daniel or no i'm asking daniel when i say what happened was it really a hook or he had a little bit pronation or how was the match
SPEAKER_01: at fault because i said to him he doesn't need to train left anymore after the world championship i i said you don't need to train left you know just train the right you know like so why did you say this why did he say this okay i tried to understand daniel is 75 kilo in kazakhstan and bojidar was 80 kilo correct yeah okay so why did he tell him that it is because they knew that they were gonna meet in saudi arabia why did they talk about this
SPEAKER_01: Tiberio, I am asking you, why Daniel and Bojidar talk about this in Kazakhstan? Because Daniel is 75, Bojidar is 80 kilos. They talk about it because they knew that they were going to meet in Saudi Arabia. He said the list was published.
SPEAKER_01: at the time of the World Championship. For the Saudi Arabia, yes. So he knew the opponents. Okay, so that's why they talk. So just if we go to the Saudi Arabia now, when Bojidar beat him, was it really pure hook or he had the pronation control? Hook. Pure hook, yeah. It was like really inside like this. Oh, okay. So Bojidar,
SPEAKER_01: you with left arm you do top roll like this and and you you pull against him in hook in saudi arabia he hook you he hook you or you just wanted to go inside because he thought that he said that his hook is better than yours well like personally like my left hand's hook was never that bad you know like me top rolling with my left hand
SPEAKER_00: it opened some doors you know for also inside pulling but i can say my left hook is not like fully committed hook because like all the time i'm trying to apply some pressure on the pronation as well you know in order to uh how to say to isolate the other guy's movement like this make my left hook uh more efficient against cool colors in saudi arabia he hook you
SPEAKER_00: Or you said, let's go in hook? He hooked you, you tried to top row? No, no, no. The plan was like never to top row. I mean, Daniel's hand, he's really good against top rowers. You saw him against Emil. He feels comfortable. His down fingers are so strong. So going fully committed top row against Daniel would be a really big mistake. Dangerous. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: and i mean like i wanted to pull a hook with him just because like i knew the guy is big deal so i just want to collide and cook with him and then you proved him the best hook that he doesn't have the best hook i mean this was not vendetta type of match i don't know how serious daniel was
SPEAKER_01: I was pretty serious back then. The way that you talk when Daniel is not around,
SPEAKER_00: And the way that you talk now when you say Daniel, you are more careful. Yes, yes, because me and Daniel, we have really like long-term friendship. Like since we've met each other 2017, till now, like we were good buddies. So I don't want to affect him in any way. You are just saying that I can just talk behind him as a good friend, but not to his face. Okay, I understand.
SPEAKER_02: Daniel says that's a big problem for him, you know, also because it's hard for him, you know, to get, you know, the beast out of him, you know. Yeah, but he had enough beast out of him when he went there and tell him that he has the best look. Yeah, but he wants Bojdar to talk some trash right now, if possible. Really? Because it's hard for him, you know, to...
SPEAKER_00: get the beast out you know with just friends you know so ah well i i thought i thought exactly the opposite say again i i thought exactly the opposite like if i get too cocky like uh daniel might misunderstand me you know yeah yeah but when whenever you make those videos and then you are like we will see who has the best soup you know yeah of course yeah
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, and you had enough of cockiness in those videos. Yeah, I will just show it on the table when the right time comes. Now I will speak only the truth and 100% the truth. I'm giving a note. But when the right time comes, we will exclude all the friendship, all the past, everything. We will just focus on arm wrestling and make people pee in their pants.
SPEAKER_02: Daniel lost his East vs West title with right arm and on the July 6th, is he going to lose with the left arm too? Probably. Daniel? Daniel says four titles at East vs West. He sees in the future.
SPEAKER_01: He says what? He says what? Four titles? Four titles at East vs West in the future. Wow, that's good. That's good. Listen, I will tell you something. I will tell you something. I love, I love when people are just targeting the big things. You know, I remember John Bersink had 95 kilo, high title and a superweight title.
SPEAKER_01: And then he was going down to 86 kilo to beat Rustam Babaev. He was losing the weight. He was 89 kilo. And then Rustam had an accident or something and the match was canceled. So like whenever people like me, myself, I won world title 55, 60, 65, 70, 75. My dream was 80, 85, like seven category. Now Daniel saying that four category winner, like big respect. Whenever people have that, those,
SPEAKER_00: like it doesn't matter he can do or not but to have that you know dream like look at how he is talking and look look at boys no no no i have something in my mind is he is he cutting down to 70 kilos again because like no no no when i when i when i finish 77 kilo class
SPEAKER_00: I will gladly give both belts to Daniel because I think he will be the one worthy of them. If I decide to go in 85, I will gladly give him the both belts and he will be holding four belts if he cut down to 70. It's okay. Oh, so you are saying that he needs to stop dreaming about 85 kilos. When I storm the 77 kilo class, I will gladly...
SPEAKER_00: give it back the both belts I will give it back to Daniel because I think he will be the one deserving them you know after the match with Mindaugas I really wanted Daniel to be in front of me so I could beat his ass like yeah that doesn't you know will not go
SPEAKER_01: below 75, you know, in the future. Yeah, I'm sure. No, no, no. He's not serious. He's not serious. You didn't understand. He's not serious. He's saying that he wants four titles, 77 and 85. So Bojidar is saying that he will, after he wins, Bojidar wins 77 to the right and left, he will go up to 85 to win. And he says he can give the belt to Zaniyev.
SPEAKER_01: and then daniel and if daniel was four titles he will not be 85 so maybe he can go down 70 if he wants four titles not the 85 is what he said i have a question for daniel daniel you just recently pulled uh alan zolev and the last two rounds you went inside um did you give your all his insight was stronger than yours
SPEAKER_02: He didn't pull 100% because he already won, but make no mistake, the inside of Zaloiev is very strong, so he felt big power there, but just didn't want to give a war after he...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, so he didn't give it all, but still, he could have won. So that's why in the fourth round, he just told him, go, go, and let his hand. Okay. And another question to Danijel. At the side table, did you try left arm with Alan? It was good, yeah. Yeah. And...
SPEAKER_02: Daniel, at the WAF, are you going 80 or 75? 75. 75, okay, yeah. He doesn't want to, you know, beat Boşdar again, you know, so, yeah. One is enough, one is enough, you know, so. That's why we are good friends, because we think for our well-being, you know.
SPEAKER_01: yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah anyway so uh so daniel's donnie daniel also wants to win uh 85 kilo title and can you ask daniel like what does he think right now sasha sasha is going down to 85 kilo is is that is it like would he be willing to pull sasha just say
SPEAKER_02: 85 kg? Left or right arm, like Daniel Cordovici. Yeah, in vendetta form, you know, right or left, 85, you know, 85, because you have to understand, Daniel is not going to be 85, you know. He was going to pull 85, but he's going to be around... 82, 83?
SPEAKER_02: not not really you know it's i mean i i know him very well you know it's very hard for him to to put weight you know like but i remember one time he was 82 kilos yeah what the weight and you know just not not a lot uh different on the arms you know yeah does he does he think that with the low weight he will have chance to win really four titles
SPEAKER_02: Yes, I mean, he goes against even heavier. He told me if he will not participate in WAF and Europeans, it's most definitely. If he stops competing, I will stop also.
SPEAKER_01: Any of you guys, you guys don't have the American visa, right? No. No, Daniel, you don't have American visa either, right? No, yeah, okay. Because from now on, we will be able to organize events in North America. We need to get you guys. It might not be so hard if it's for event. It might not be hard to take if it's for event.
SPEAKER_02: How long it takes for you to get visa? We have to get ourselves informed maybe first, because I don't want to talk like without knowing. Okay. I have visa, so I know the process in Romania, so I don't think it will be problem in Romania to get it, you know, but it's too close to this event in United States. Okay, one second, you said for Romania.
SPEAKER_01: Is Daniel double citizen? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, okay. So he's European Union citizen, Daniel? Yeah, it's easier to get it from Romania embassy. Okay, I didn't know that. I thought he was only Moldovan citizen, so he's double citizen. Okay, that's good. That's very good. It will be much easier, yeah. Yeah, it will be. That's good. Yeah. And Bozidar, how is your right arm?
SPEAKER_00: not bad like is it is it enough to beat daniel right now it took very long so it means well okay no no i guess he will not be able to take my wrist like he did with alan but i i can't say if i will take the win
SPEAKER_00: My side pressure is still not enough to face Daniel, right? But maybe on 6th of July, I can pull him right as well. It depends. Daniel says his top goal is very different from before. Oh, I'm sure, I'm sure. He got it 3-1, for the most part.
SPEAKER_02: He prepared, you know, specifically for a different style of Topol for Zaluyev. So he prepared in a certain way, you know, to, you know, target Alan's weaknesses, you know, what he saw in the, you know, in the matches before, you know. He was amazing against Alan. Question. If he would pull Mindaugas again, would he train Topolov?
SPEAKER_01: He's confident that he can top-roll Mindaugas. I remember one time he tried to top-roll Mindaugas in European Championships and Mindaugas flashed him. And then he got a foul. Bojidar got a foul and second start he hooked him. So he is really confident that he can top-roll Mindaugas.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, because he has a different top goal right now. And if you remember, you know, the Justin Bishop match, you know, you'll see. Yeah, it's very, you know, it's very close, very close match. And it's close because he has also good top goal, you know. But Daniel just thinks he's like different level power wise.
SPEAKER_00: Right now, I'm 100% sure I will top-roll Mendoza on the right hand without any problem. I mean, that's why I thought so much about Daniel's match. But if we both go top-roll, I'm not sure whose wrist will fall. But if Daniel hooks me on right, he will probably beat me easy.
SPEAKER_00: hmm right now against top rollers i am 100 efficient i don't know like from my side top rolling top rolling mindagas is
SPEAKER_01: like i don't know i i can play playstation with one hand and i can still topple you are different class staying in no probably now no but we will see we will see i'm training daniel i'm coming first down to 85 kilo then 77 kilo so one more guy now arthur alan you bojidar mindaugas yanis
SPEAKER_01: and terzi what's that eight man tournament that sounds like an eight that tournament tournament is no good tournament is just like daniel just say two minutes and then me first round winner and daniel now is tired you understand like yeah just example example you know because when the level is close the draw plays very important role much
SPEAKER_01: much better with the vendetta style the superman style yeah yeah the other one is a little bit if you are lucky just think that makaro and daniel pull one minute in hook and then second round anyone can beat them because they are tired now you know so or or i have a long match and daniel first round easy then he goes like this
SPEAKER_00: So supermatch is better. Supermatch is always in a professional like UFC or boxing. You know, you don't do tournaments. You know, you just need to do one on one. Yeah, that's that's why we shouldn't take the match from Riyadh about about our vendetta match. You know, like I don't even recall it back. I don't even think about this match, you know? Yeah, it just shows that it's possible, but it doesn't give you guarantee.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, because just think about it. Like many, many super matches, it is like 2-0, 3-0, and then the guy comes back and then beats the guy. In the tournaments, yeah. Like Daniel and Mindaugas? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, Mindaugas won 4-2, right? 4-2. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, Daniel, just first beat this guy and then next you ask Arthur, you ask Mindaugas, we will set again, you know. If I beat Daniel, can I ask Arthur and Mindaugas as well?
SPEAKER_01: yeah yeah yeah for sure of course but it's not really listen listen your right arm is not ready so don't ask me any title match if you just tell me listen because if you go there and lose and then you will not get a chance anytime soon you know or the title so yeah you need to be careful you need to ask when you are ready and and daniel
SPEAKER_02: What do you think about what's happening right now in 75, 77 kilo? Everyone is beating each other? What do you think about this category? Yes, it was all about training periods and the day you got it. For example, with Parasites, I didn't have the best preparation.
SPEAKER_02: His opinion is it's all about the preparation. In that category, everybody can beat everybody, but according to the preparation, they had before, if it's good, if it's bad, if it's the right choice in strategy. But the level is close, right? The level is close.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, level is close, is very close. And with the Tarasaitis match, he didn't have the right preparation. You know, the strength levels were there, you know, but not the right preparation because you have to have a certain, you know, like with Alan Zaluev, you know, we had exactly the right, you know, the game plan, you know, done specifically for Alan, not just like let's get better all around, you know.
SPEAKER_02: The question, Daniel, how is your right hand right now? Good shape? Better than the left. So, July 6th, if you would pull Arthur, what is your chance of winning? I don't know.
SPEAKER_02: he said depends on the prize money if the price money is enough it will be the same as with alan oh so if the price if the prize money is a little bit less they will lose uh
SPEAKER_01: no i'm not asking i'm not asking the match i'm just saying can he he said he can be done enough enough like very very uh you know close to the match with alan you know but but you know alan is going like we don't know where alan is going here there there alan is but arthur can especially go inside he thinks that he can keep art uh arthur outside of the hook
SPEAKER_02: uh he he will pull hook most likely wow yes just because it's easier but uh you know you you never know you know where you feel in the match that you need to go you know but um i understand i understand and and what what do you think who would win you think between daniel and makarov yeah
SPEAKER_00: I never bet against Daniel. Do you remember his match when he pulled with Samusha? I couldn't control myself. I saw Daniel struggling. I got so excited. I went on the stage to help him to get the blood out of his hands. I never bet against Daniel. Can you ask Daniel that
SPEAKER_02: right now bojidar is so lovely to daniel is that because he is just like trying to not upset him even even if
SPEAKER_02: He wouldn't be so friendly. It's really hard to motivate him because the friendship is very long. No matter what he says right now, it will be very hard for Daniel to get a little bit angry and get the fire started. I will motivate him now. Wait, today I downloaded one photo for this.
SPEAKER_01: podcast just give me a second and i will show you in a few seconds how can you how can you not be motivated he said that he made it that that say that i'm gonna show him i'm gonna crush his beliefs that you know who is his hook is better you remember that he said that he's motivated but he's not like you know like when people doesn't and you you just get a little bit angry and uh
SPEAKER_00: Look now, this is our first encounter with Daniel on the left hand. Wait. What is this? What is that? I didn't understand. He's not even holding the pack. What kind of photo is that? This is Daniel going away from the table after I destroyed his wrist.
SPEAKER_00: i think i think he's feeling sick here daniel asks if he will try uh this time to destroy his wrist yes is that photo from where
SPEAKER_00: It's from our first encounter in 2017. It was Balkans League. It was our first meeting with Daniel. You beat him before as well? Yeah, but it was a long time ago. Okay, but in 2017, this guy won the world in Hungary. Yeah, but he was 70 kilos. Yeah, but in this competition? It was a few months before the Worlds. Okay. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: And you were 80 kilos? Yes, I think I was 78, 79 back then again. And then he was probably 73 maximum. No, no, he was 77, 76, 77, something like this. Daniel was 76, 77? Yes, yes, yes. So your weight was close to each other? Two, three kilos max difference. Okay. Yeah, I remember like we go to the venue because it was outside event.
SPEAKER_02: And I remember it was... One second. Daniel now took his phone. He is looking something, you know. I think he's going to show something back. He said he doesn't remember exactly the weight. Daniel says he was not in a very good shape then. You know, he lost a lot of matches then. Yeah. But anyway, I remember how...
SPEAKER_00: like it was outside event you know and before the start like they put the big the big cup on one table and i went and i took the cup before the start like in front of all the athletes and i just lifted up you know and and daniel was there laughing at me and one guy tells me look like he doesn't accept this
SPEAKER_01: Okay, so on the July 6th, you're going to do the same thing? Yeah, but I will just be lifting the belt, not the cup. Okay, but you're going to probably tell him to give the belt already when you see him in Istanbul? No, I want to earn it. Yeah, but you took the cup before you earned it. Because I was reckless and young, now I'm like more...
SPEAKER_00: Mature. Yeah, I'm more mature now. Exactly, exactly. The right words. I'm more collected now. Okay, Daniel, you hear these things, right? And if you are still not provoked, you know, just, I don't know what to say.
SPEAKER_00: Daniel doesn't say a lot. I want to provoke him, but I don't want him to hate me, you know, because I still want to spend some time together before the match, like go smoke some shisha and all this stuff, you know, like all the other competitions. And do you think that he's taking care of your belt good?
SPEAKER_00: I hope he cleans it every day, he polishes it and all this stuff. I'm sure he's taking really good care of it. He should better sleep with it the night before the match because it will be the last night, intimate night with the belt and him.
SPEAKER_02: Daniel says, you know, he's such a good friend, even if he loses, he can give it to him, you know, but everybody will know and everybody knows who the champion is. Okay, at least for one photo. Also, some autograph, you know. Okay, okay. It's good, it's good.
SPEAKER_00: I just want to tell you one thing, just for sure, make Bulgarian passports to the belt as well, you know, just make one passport for the belt as well, because there's a really big chance that it's going to travel abroad. Okay, I think this is enough to provoke Daniel, but we will see, time will show.
SPEAKER_01: Daniel, so you are ready, if you are satisfied with the agreement, you are ready to pull Arthur on July 6th as well? Yes, yes, his level is good. Yeah, tell him if he is open to negotiations.
SPEAKER_02: It's too close to be negotiating right now, you know. But he said that he would compete if he is satisfied. Yeah, if he's satisfied, yeah, 100%. If he's satisfied. So just tell him that always the middle way is the most fair way.
SPEAKER_02: especially if he if especially if he has some previous promises yeah he said you know he thinks this match is uh 100 going to happen uh you know uh either way you know it's going to happen you know so uh
SPEAKER_02: this this event uh the next one you know like uh it doesn't matter yeah he he's not going to push you know to to to to get it you know this event or yeah yeah yeah also also it may be hard to pull right and left in the same event yeah yeah yeah does he think that way it would be hard to pull
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, he said, you know, right now is a little bit difficult, you know, because like he said before, you know, he now prepares for a specific opponent, you know, so he's been preparing for one game plan left, you know, and the right is like just
SPEAKER_02: just uh maintaining you know not nothing he's not pushing the right anymore you know so uh so better not better not this time back to back it will be you know it could be problematic you know okay okay i understand yeah and and okay does do you think that he can get visa till august 10th or london yeah i i don't i don't think he's uh
SPEAKER_02: is possible. I mean, with visa it is possible, but he said it's too close to the waqf. It's possible. We have to go to Bucharest. It's not a very long process. It will be a long process if
SPEAKER_02: It's rejected the first time. Yeah, but this kind of visa, it's no problem. Usually it's no problem. He has been in the US before? No, no, no. But just for reference, this kind of visa is no problem to get, you know. Okay. Okay. Anyway, so let's quickly talk about the matches.
SPEAKER_01: The first one, we just want, this is a title match, you guys know, right? It's best of seven, you need to win four matches. And does Daniel think that this is like four rounds to win? Is it better for him or worse for him? For Daniel? Yeah, yeah, for Daniel, like title matches to be best of seven is better for him. But you may want...
SPEAKER_02: No, it didn't matter because even if it was best of five or seven, it wouldn't matter because
SPEAKER_01: Mindagos reached 3 and 4 before them. Yes, but anyway. Okay, let's talk about the matches. First, start with Petro Marharit versus Zurab. Tauberize. Margarit. Margarit. I don't know how good it is to re-establish Zurab after Rom. Margarit, yes. Is it Margarit? Yes. And you, Bojdan? I also think that Margarit will win.
SPEAKER_00: I've been injured for more than a year and I know how bad it is to make a good comeback you know even though like Zurab is saying I'm healthy and all this stuff he hasn't been competing for one year and I also think that stylistically Petro's hook is better than Zurab's hook like no offense to Zurab like if he's in top shape like before he might give
SPEAKER_01: big fight to Petro, but right now I think that Petro is the favorite. Can you ask Daniel, he thinks that Marhanen is going to win because he thinks that Zurab is not back to his best shape yet or Marhanen would win anyways? Yeah, right now he says he doesn't think it's possible to regain back the top shape
SPEAKER_02: Okay, what if he was in prime shape? He said, you know, best shape Zurab could win. Best shape Zurab could win against Margarit. Still close, but yeah, could win. Okay, let's go to Dimitrina Petrova, Ayane Takenaka. Petrova, Dimitrina Petrova, Ayane.
SPEAKER_00: What do you think I will say? Stylistically, if you ask me like stylistically, like Ayane has really good style against pulling Dimitrina, you know? But I do believe that there is no woman who can defeat Dimitrina under 60 kilos.
SPEAKER_00: right now right hand i i'm 100 sure like there will not be any woman dominating as dimitrina under 60 kilo like she does okay um artem taranenko versus thomas roses thomas thomas and you what's that
SPEAKER_00: Well, I hope Artem can pull some tricks. He can pull this match somehow. I want him to take some rounds, but after seeing how Toms is performing lately. Against Zog and other people? Against everyone. This guy is crazy. I think he is very strong here. Hand control, side press, how he maintains the hand, the angles, everything. He seems really solid.
SPEAKER_00: I know that Artem is good in some strange positions, like overcoming his opponents. I hope at some point he can pull some tricks, he can do something, but I think no offense to Artem, but I think Tomas will be victorious on this one.
SPEAKER_02: He said, you know, it's really tough, you know, he doesn't know exactly the shape of Chen Shuo, you know, but he thinks Chen Shuo's style is very good to beat Ibrahim.
SPEAKER_01: yeah because anyone who is coming inside through chance is like this drop drop match yeah exactly yeah yeah exactly yeah even even to touching he gave very good match they had a very long match yeah and you was there if if chance uh maintain the center the center good you know not to let sagov apply the shoulder and always give oppression to to his
SPEAKER_00: Bauman to his side, like he will pull this off. But if he is not careful with Sagov, like he might throw away the victory. I have a very good one for you. You start, Bojidar. Vladimir Mairov, Adam Orzenski. You pull both of them and I think they both beat you, correct? Yeah, yeah. They both beat me pretty bad. I think last time I pulled Majorov, it was 2018.
SPEAKER_00: yeah the the mogul event but in the first round i i got slight injured against woman because i tried to yeah i remember i tried to cook him without the strap and it affected my brachioradialis a little bit but anyway i don't think i would have been able to beat my euro even if i was 100 back then like this guy hook was really solid
SPEAKER_00: i think both of them will make a really great match do you think do you think that there is a possibility myro to dominate adam or you think that the match is gonna stop well if if adam brings the shape he brought in our match and he says that on their podcast he said that he is even better right now yeah
SPEAKER_00: I think he might take the win. If he can maintain the higher position in the hook, he might take the match because both guys have incredible endurance. Something seemed off with Adam. Maybe it was from his weight loss against Makarov. He was not dominant. Even Makarov had a small shape. If he is not
SPEAKER_00: careful with Majorov, he will lose. But if he can maintain the higher hook and the better position, even if the match lasts longer, I think he has good endurance to pull it off. What do you think? He said he thinks Majorov because he's more well-rounded. He can pull hook and
SPEAKER_02: inside and outside on the right and would he would he what sorry daniel go ahead yeah he's more well well-rounded you know more more and and daniel would wish to pull these guys in 85
SPEAKER_01: he said he could prepare no problem for each you know for yeah so he's confident against these guys yeah yeah yeah wow if he wants four belts he will have to anyway yeah yeah exactly yeah yeah yeah he needs to pass kamushia he needs to pass sasho and all those guys wow incredible yeah let's go um this one i only want score prediction uh
SPEAKER_01: Daniel Prokopchuk, Bojidar Semenov. For two. For two, who's winning? For whom? And you, Bojidar? Okay, I will say also for two, we leave it like this without saying who will win. Okay.
SPEAKER_00: I told you I beat him every day. I hope like on 6th of July I will beat him as well. If you beat him every day, you know, do you think that he should ship the belt to you? No. No? Okay. Because when I beat him every day, like only I see it. On 6th of July, like the whole world will see it.
SPEAKER_02: Daniel says, you know, we have to relax, you know, don't because pulling Daniel every day in your head can be really tough. Today I've been sleeping whole day. Daniel, did you see when he did this? His arm looks so skinny. Just do it again.
SPEAKER_01: look at look at no no see so small oh is it no oh yeah look at the bicep wow right right is better no i'm just joking you you have never been a big muscular guy anyways so let's go uh carolina peterson olga terpelova
SPEAKER_02: I think that this match might take more time than Zurab against Ron Bathmatch.
SPEAKER_00: Karolina is really good at taking the other people's hands but not finishing the match early or it takes some time for her to pin her opponent I don't know if because she has really long hands and it's hard to finish but Olga is really good and in this strange position you know folding without wrist and
SPEAKER_01: Yes, really good. So you are saying that they will be stuck like this? I think that Carolina will take the hand and Tolga will get stuck and we will just sit and watch after. Okay. Then let's go to Betkili Oniyani, Artem Tainov. Yesterday I saw a photo of Betkili Oniyani. I don't remember if I've ever seen Betkili's arm
SPEAKER_01: that big let's see if i can he can if i can find it um but yeah yeah this one yeah right here um not this one but i think i think the photo is i think photo is gone on basically yeah yeah yeah yeah right here
SPEAKER_01: One second. Yeah. I don't remember Betchili's arm like this. Betchili's arm is usually skinny, but now he's looking big. Do you guys think that Betchili has a chance against Argentaino with left arm? Yes, I think so. He has a longer hand, for example, when he goes down, and he can rotate it more easily.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, Daniel says he does have a lot of chances because he has a very long forearm and he can, you know, better wrap around, you know, Tainov's arm, you know, and get into the hook, you know. Daniel, were you surprised when Betkili beat Aktaev that easily? No, no, he was not surprised. He was expecting it.
SPEAKER_02: yeah but i was expecting target start basically stop and then maybe yeah but this time he's just ready to go like really good like i didn't think that he would dominate uh he said he fought with both yeah you know and and the the level of the hook like on yani
SPEAKER_02: He didn't see anybody in the world. Okay, when did you pull Badkilei? I don't remember. World and European youth. Oh, youth competition. Oh, okay. Because Tenor, I don't remember. Yeah, but you know the style. Who won that? Him, but with Topol. Topol. Oh, Badkilei Topol?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah. Okay, but how does he say that his hook never felt like this if he didn't pull? They were blocked, you know, center, you know, in hook, you know. Oh, okay, then top roll him? Yeah, yeah. But just, you know, not only about strength, you know, just the style, you know, it will be very uncomfortable for a lot of people, you know, just a lot of people have good hook, but not like
SPEAKER_02: So, Daniel, are you saying that Taino may win with explosiveness, but if this might stop, that really means? He said, you know, Onian, even without the wrist, you know, can pull
SPEAKER_02: good and also he has a very good endurance you know so yeah it's hard but done yet whenever whenever kaino top rolls if you do this kaino also can do this yeah he said you know it's hard for him to imagine you know like yeah this happening every round you know like uh yeah i know
SPEAKER_02: would would be a little bit you know uh we'll slow down you know later rounds and then you know the the moment yeah because because this is seven rounds seven rounds yeah yeah it's it's favors sonyani you know the endurance game favors sonyani yeah so daniel thinks that if he had money he would bet on bet killing
SPEAKER_00: And you, Bozidar? I also think that Betkele will win, but I don't really think that it will be easy for him because Tainov, he is really versatile and he, as you said, like he really smooth transition between those moves, you know, like he is really comfortable with transitioning and all this stuff. He do it fast.
SPEAKER_00: But Betkili's hand is so long, it might be really uncomfortable for Tainov. But also Betkili's weakness is that his wrist is vulnerable, you know, and Tainov is a smart guy, so he will take this as advantage. So it will be a really great war, but if the match goes to strap and if Betkili put the brakes on Tainov, there is no other way. Betkili will be the winner.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, so let's go to the next one. Barbora versus Egle, Daniel. Daniel asking your opinion. He said like, you know,
SPEAKER_02: he thinks Egle has the, you know, experience advantage, you know, she will come back, you know, more, you know, more motivated right now. She's more motivated right now. So if Barbora is much stronger, she's going to win. But if the power is close, then Egle with experience probably will have more chance. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And Bojidar?
SPEAKER_01: What will be Eggless weight? Do you know? Like what's her weight? Probably near 90. Probably near. But you're talking with her. Is her shape like, is he in the best shape? She's training like crazy. Yeah. Yeah. This match probably is one of the most important match of her career because right now we're going to, you know, see the best queen.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I really hope she could give hard time to Barbara. Not just because I want Barbara to lose. I don't think that there is a woman who can beat Barbara right now in the world. So you are saying that Barbara is going to win? She is just so dominant. I just want her to get sweat a little bit so she could enjoy armwrestling more. So you are saying that she is heavily favourited?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah, of course. Like she's so dominant, so strong. I don't really think that there is a woman who can give her a hard time right now in the armwrestling community. You remember, you were not there, but Daniel was in Slovakia and Barbora, she looked really like very strong. You remember Barbora in Slovakia, Daniel? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, she was just like everything, like up to down, just like...
SPEAKER_01: Whoa, you know. Very strong. Yeah. Let's go, let's go, let's go. Travis Bergent versus Serhii Kalnyshenko. I think Daniel will say Serhii Kalnyshenko. They are very close friends. But did you see Travis Bergent yesterday or not, Daniel? He had a super match yesterday. With Derek Smith. He just like dominated like nothing, you know.
SPEAKER_01: So he won with left hand? Yeah, he won with the left hand, but he was just like nothing, you know, just like nothing. And he looked like his past days. He looked that way, you know. And today I have a podcast and Devon said that Serhii Kalnichenko doesn't have any chance. Devon said Travis is going to destroy Serhii. Yeah, Devon says, you know, that Travis
SPEAKER_02: was always good better left hand you know so we'll see because he said if travis would bring back the shape from where from moldova you know uh he will definitely win you know but you know it's uh
SPEAKER_01: He doesn't know... I mean, just one second, Daniel. What makes you think that Travis' shape of Moldova was untouchable because he beat Georges Turetko, who was injured left arm? That match, you know, it was right arm match. And then Travis had a problem with the chest, so they pulled left arm. And Georges Turetko... You know, like injured his chest with Sabine. Yeah, but Georges Turetko's left arm was injured. He wasn't really training.
SPEAKER_02: In the last moment, they changed the match to right arm. So, you saw a well-trained Travis versus not good shape. He said just the physical shape of Travis. Oh, by looking at his? Yeah, okay. Very good, you know, like, you know, yeah. Okay, okay. And you, Bozidar, how you see this match? So, the creating is working good, yeah?
SPEAKER_00: i will go with sergey you know like if if sergey like falls for travis tricks he might have a really really bad day and really hard time but if he stays focused he he even suppressed travis's like demons or how to say it he will be victorious okay
SPEAKER_01: Let's see the next one. Samusha vs. Sasho. 85 Kilo World Title. Daniel, is Samusha's winning streak is finishing? He won 8 matches in a row. What do you think now? Sasho, I think he will finish... Yes, it's possible that he will finish, that he won't be the first to win, because we fought with Andy and Sasho will be the first.
SPEAKER_02: uh he's very sad because he said it's possible that he's not the first to do you know to beat uh samusha you know so it's possible that uh that sasha will will win you know he's possible he's possible who has more chance no he is more possible so
SPEAKER_02: has better chance Sasho you know but he wanted he wanted to to him to be the first you know to to beat Samusha you know so okay so he wants Samusha to win because Daniel wants the title match to beat and then finish Samusha's yeah yeah that's that's exactly it that's exactly it but that's that's what he wants you know but you know rationally you know
SPEAKER_00: rationally he thinks uh sasho is stronger because he pulled with both you know and okay so he wants he wants samusha to win because it will be easier afterwards to beat samusha than sasho because because if sasho if sasho takes
SPEAKER_00: If Sasho takes the 85 kilo belt, we will really have to stop competing in Europeans and Worlds if we want to take this belt. Okay, so you are saying that nobody can beat Sasho under 85 kilo? Probably yes. Wow. But I will tell you something. If I would be ready...
SPEAKER_01: Sasho would be the last person that I want to pull. The last person. Like, everyone is hard. You are very hard. Daniel is very hard. Tamusha is very hard. But the Sasho, I mean... He is brick wall. Yeah, I mean, you need a very strong elbow to, you know, push that. If your elbow is just that, then no good, you know. Even Daniel's elbow, for me, is very strong.
SPEAKER_01: You know, me to think that Daniel to put outside here is okay, but to finish Daniel is problem. The same with the Sasho, but Sasho may have better, better here, you know, yeah. Yeah, he said also the hand may be a little bit bigger with Sasho, you know, so this is also a factor, you know.
SPEAKER_01: i think i think that the way that sasho and daniel with left arm like i mean yeah a little bit close close yeah but but you you train with him right like his shape how is okay how you see this match uh bush there uh but first tell me are they going to pull 85 kilos or a little bit yeah
SPEAKER_00: because yesterday i talked with sasha that is 85 flow category 85 so they they both yeah yeah i mean i mean before when sasha was cutting i remember when he was cutting to 75 he was cutting from 81 82 kilos and it has never been a problem for him it's
SPEAKER_00: didn't really affect his shape and his trends. So right now I think that he will just clean some fat and he will be ready to go. Like it will not affect his trend. And such hand control is way more dominant than Samusha's. I think Samusha might be a little bit better in terms of endurance.
SPEAKER_01: But if Sasho is more than 5% stronger than Samusha, the endurance won't be a winning factor. Okay, I understand. I understand. But these are incredible matches. I just can't wait. Writing them at the table, they are coming. Imagine that Sasho, like last 10 years, the guy, except a few times, he dominated Europeans and Worlds.
SPEAKER_01: And now we have Samusha who won Europeans, Worlds, even Zloty Tour. And then eight matches in a row, he won all the world title matches. And these guys two competing, it is just like, it's like, like for their weight category, it's like almost like Muhammad Ali versus Mike Tyson or something, you know? Yeah. Let me, let me tell you something about this match, you know, because, uh,
SPEAKER_00: I think it's a little bit personal. This match is a little bit personal for Samusha as well. I'm pretty sure he hit your phone like, I want to pull Sasho, I want to pull Sasho, yes? Or no? He told me to pull Sasho for 95kg category. Yeah, because you know, before Samusha's left hand was good as well. Until 2015, Samusha had final with Sasho.
SPEAKER_01: In Malaysia, yeah. And this was really the final for Samusha's left hand. So Sasha injured him and then finished his left arm. Because in that event, Samusha was in the final with left arm but not right arm. Probably his left was even better than his right before this. Okay, let's go to another one. Crazy one. Daniel Prokopchuk. Who is winning? Irakli Zrakashvili, Evgeny Prudnik.
SPEAKER_02: He said, you know, Irakli, you know, progressed a lot lately, you know. But, you know, Prudnik has the key. He thinks Prudnik has the key to beat him, you know, knows how to pull with him, you know, like...
SPEAKER_01: will have he has many different ways to find yeah we'll have a very good strategy he's very smart and he will he will win so you are saying that Iraq is very very strong but only one way while rudny can find different ways okay and how do you see that match probably I I have I have the same thoughts like
SPEAKER_00: in 105 kilo like prudnik was so big so dominant even though he lost weight against todd like he was so huge so i don't think it will the weight loss it will be problem for him about iraqli for the 100th class i think the experience and the versatility of prudnik will be
SPEAKER_00: winning factor of this one i really hope that iraqi will give him hard time even take his wrist first rounds but as so you guys are basically saying that if iraqi wants to win he needs to dominate if the power yes exactly exactly he has to fully control brodnick's hand which is not so easy if he wants to win this okay okay okay
SPEAKER_01: Just so you guys know that I love chatting with you guys and it's finishing, but I love it. You know, you guys just great arm wrestlers and it is very fun to talk with you guys. Right now we have another match. Very important match. Very, very, very, very important match. Oleg Petrenko versus David Dadikian. Daniel, what do you think about the level of this event?
SPEAKER_02: just generally generally all these matches together this one you know this event you know this event is from all the events very close like very very close each each uh each match you know is very close you know it's it's um even though he he told you the you know what he thinks he
SPEAKER_01: can happen anything but what i'm just saying that the the the atlas level is very high right yeah yeah yeah yeah you know the best of the best yeah i mean the bad part about east versus west the level of the match is so high that one person cannot focus on this one like when he pulled at amc he pulled alan alan's goal there and that was the main event at the east versus west
SPEAKER_01: This match is very important. Bojidar versus Daniel, very important. Petrenko-Dadikian is very important. Sasha Samushev is very important. There are many, many, many, many important matches. That is the problem, but I cannot really organize one good match every event, you understand? Very good problem. That's a very good problem. Yes, yes, yes. But I don't want athletes to feel that they are not important or something, but it is just that everyone is important in this event.
SPEAKER_02: So what does he think? What do you think? Dadikian is the champion? He said, you know, he really doesn't know, you know, like who will win, you know, but he will root for Petrenko. He really, you know, he really likes, you know, his work ethic, you know, like how he trains, you know, and he wants this really, really hard, you know. So he wants him to win, you know, but
SPEAKER_01: Anything can happen, you know, can go either way. Let's just look at Daniel, look at the category. You have Dadikian, you have Prutnik, you have Tatachins, you have Irakli, you have Petrenko, you have Ungarbev. Look, it's just like a crazy, crazy competition. But 77 kilos, same, you know, Bojidar, you, Makaro, Alan. I'm just coming, I'm just coming.
SPEAKER_00: And then you're going to crash Daniel, right? You're going to crash him. No, I mean, I mean, those guys, I let them and they can decide who is the winner of the category. So I have to step in, you know? Yeah. So they were just too comfortable and you come down from 80. Why, why, why they're still playing games? Like I just need to come and school them, you know? And then go up to 85. You will give the two belts to Daniel, right? Exactly. Okay.
SPEAKER_00: What do you think about this match? This match is completely like a clash of titans. Both guys have really strong hand control. This match they will not need strap at all, just their hands will do the talking. But if the match starts in Dadikyan's side, Dadikyan will win.
SPEAKER_00: If the match starts in Petrenko's side, Petrenko will win. So if Petrenko manages to pull and stop the hit of Dadikyan and maintain the center and overcup him, Petrenko will win. So the one who has better start will win? Yes, and better maintenance of the center. Or in the later rounds, if Dadikyan doesn't flash pin Petrenko first rounds...
SPEAKER_01: Or if he beats him hard in the first round, I think that Dadikian might run out of gas before Petrenko. Did you guys see the Ongarbe vs Petrenko match, Daniel? Yes. You were surprised? No, no surprise?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, he said it's always happened that way, you know, so he wasn't surprised. I mean, I thought that, you know, maybe Petrenko would win, but did he really expect that kind of domination? Yeah, not that kind of domination, but he expected to win, you know, expected. Okay, yeah. No, I wasn't surprised if Petrenko would win or Ongar would win, but I was surprised that he was just... Yeah, yeah, that's what's surprising, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: okay the last match archon morozo michael did we miss did we miss grassy and hutchings on purpose yeah yeah no no sorry one more we will have yeah i stopped looking at the poster and i was just looking at just the chat
SPEAKER_02: this is my my second second podcast in a row so yeah we talked about this at the beginning yeah daniel said uh you know if morozov is able to stop the match doesn't matter if uh one position you know if he stops the match that that will be the the biggest uh problem for for morozov you know stopping the match because uh um
SPEAKER_01: um is very fast you know daniel the match started and morozov stopped him like this he still wins if he stops him right there daniel thinks he will win more also okay he will he will still do like this okay okay and but what does he think that what is his possibility to stop the match
SPEAKER_02: He says the chances are high that Morozov will stop the match. This is why... Especially because it's seven matches, you know, so... No, it's not seven. It's not title match. He still thinks Morozov has the edge.
SPEAKER_01: Very close, very, very close, but still, you know, favors a little bit Morozov. And you? So, I thought Vitaly and Morozov, they will put three rounds? Five rounds. Five, yeah, best of five. Best of five, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, okay. This is not the world title match. It is your match, because you are good enough to put the world title match. They are not yet.
SPEAKER_00: Not yet. They need to work on their way to reach Levan. Okay. Anyway. Morozov. Morozov. All the way up for Morozov. Morozov. You like him since you saw him in Istanbul when you played against the Kazakh guy. I'm really a big fan of Morozov. Okay. I would never bet against him.
SPEAKER_01: Okay. And the last one, Tata Sings versus Krasimir Kostadinov. So this will be the main event, yes? This is not the world title match, but Daniel. After I saw how Krasimir worked out yesterday and the dedication and the shape he is in, this match might really be the main event. No joke. But you also told me something else that I don't want to mention here. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: but yes yes don't because it might give some yeah yeah you don't want to give any any kind of information exactly exactly but i will tell you one thing like 2015 uh 2015 i think it was uh on the left hand do you remember how matushenko dominated grassy on left arm like at european center
SPEAKER_00: Do you remember what happened next year? How Krasimir dominated? I mean, he didn't dominate. You are saying that Krasimir takes lessons and then do what is necessary and he doesn't lose two times. I mean, I don't say he doesn't lose two times, but for a long time, I can say I didn't see him in this state. Is it only mental or also physical state? Physical as well.
SPEAKER_00: mental state is also different exactly exactly i mean his hook right now under 100 kilo very strong do you do you know his weight well 102 three kilos something like this as usual you know he was i asked him but the numbers now in my head are okay and daniel how you see this match
SPEAKER_02: I still think it's Krasimir because I saw his physical form at the European Championships and he's much better than before. He also thinks Krasimir because he saw him at the European Championships. He had very good physical shape and he beat everybody left, which is a non-dominant arm.
SPEAKER_00: From that, you know, from the shape he was at the Europeans, you know, he's very good. He's very good shape. And he thinks he's going to win? He's going to beat Todd Hutchings? Yeah, yeah, yeah. If Todd wants to win, he has to pull Irakli-style type of shit, you know? Why you call that shit? It's just for the, you know, the...
SPEAKER_01: slang is like this okay okay okay i understand anyways guys thank you very very much uh for being here we have been chatting for one hour 20 minutes and very soon in in two and a half week uh i see you guys in istanbul get ready and wish you the best stay away from the injuries and see you in istanbul thank you daniel prepare your wrist daniel
SPEAKER_01: it's it's gonna fall even in the hook thank you thank you thank you thank you guys take care bye-bye
