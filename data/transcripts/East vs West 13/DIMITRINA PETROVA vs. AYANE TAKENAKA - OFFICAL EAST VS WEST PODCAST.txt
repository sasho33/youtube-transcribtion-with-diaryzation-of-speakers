SPEAKER_04: doing this. Why are we doing this, Pia? Yeah, why? Because Engin is not feeling well and we hope he will recover good and feel good very soon. But yeah, we are doing a jump in for this and maybe for a few others. Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm just hoping if
SPEAKER_01: I'm looking if we're on the computer. Are we live? Doesn't look like it. Are we live, people? Can you see the chat stream? Yeah, I can. Yeah, we're live. Great, thank you.
SPEAKER_01: So we're having a great match that we are going to talk about today. And we invited Dimitrina Petrova versus Ayane Takenaka. That's a great match. Yeah, I'm looking forward to talking to them and see what they are expecting and how they feel. Yeah, me too. It's going to be, I don't know if they have met each other before in a competition. Do you know?
SPEAKER_04: No, I don't think so. But they have met the same opponents. Yeah, I know. Ezra, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's going to be really interesting. And a little bit more also, but Ezra is like the one to compare with. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, of course. What are you most curious about? About this match? Yeah. Uh...
SPEAKER_04: no i think i would like to see uh dimitri dimitrina is her name sorry yeah yeah i would like to see dimitrina having a good fight yeah hopefully they have a a hook match in some fight um yeah i'm i'm excited i i think ayana is super super strong and i hope
SPEAKER_04: we can see that and do you know that she almost has as big forearms like egg almost it's like a few centimeters off yeah you can see that on her pictures yeah she had very strong arms yeah
SPEAKER_01: So I can see that Dimitrina already is here. I'm going to push the button so that we can invite her. This is the match 6th of July in Istanbul, East versus West 13. So by the pay-per-view. I'm going to let her in now. We will see.
SPEAKER_04: Can you still see me? No, you froze for me. But I hear you. Now I see you. I can't see Dimitrina though. Dimitrina, are you there? Maybe it takes a while for
SPEAKER_04: Yes, so Ingen is sick, huh? I really hope that he will be well enough to do East vs West 13. We will all help him. Yeah, I saw the video and he said that it will be a competition, even if he can't make it, but he thought he could make it. Yeah. Hello, Dimitrina. Hi, Krasimir. Hey. How are you?
SPEAKER_01: Very good, very good. Nice. How are you guys? Also good, very good. Are you in Bulgaria? Yes. Yes? Nice. So Dimitri, how are you? Very good.
SPEAKER_01: I'm fine. Thank you. Yeah, perfect. We have celebrated Midsummer's Eve in Sweden. It's a big party weekend. We were talking to Coach Ray too, and they also celebrate this there. But how do you feel about this match with Ajane? It's just the same.
SPEAKER_02: She said, like any other competition, she's preparing very seriously and nerves from time to time, but totally normal. Everything's under control. Perfect. You look strong. As always. Fantasy. Yeah. 16.
SPEAKER_02: So how have you prepared for this match? We have just made some adjustments to Ayane's style of pulling. The guys that are pulling with her are imitating Ayane's way of pulling.
SPEAKER_04: but he but she's preparing everything let's see how this will go are you uh dimitrina's like coach training coach yes have you always been yes cool are you still sorry uh
SPEAKER_04: is is the training still uh very focused on on table time are you like only training on the tables like you did before yes 98 of the training is on the table she should try some lift from time to time but the 98 of the time is just table practice and also several times a day
SPEAKER_01: or or two times a day right now okay that's impressive so dimitrina what do you think will happen in the match with the ayane you said that you were preparing by having other arm wrestlers do what you think that ayane will do in a match so how do you think that will be
SPEAKER_02: She's expecting Ayane to go just to the side.
SPEAKER_02: with some back pressure and to the side not pure top roll not pure hook she's expecting and just to back pressure her a little bit and go to the side and it she says it depends if i'm able to curl her or not most likely if she's able to curl her she would just flash her if the match goes here you'll see yeah you can pull outside also dimitrina
SPEAKER_02: You're quite good top roller too, aren't you? Yes, she's good if her opponent is hook puller. Then her pronation and back pressure are pretty solid. If her opponent is top roller, we are not pretty sure what would happen if Dimitrina is also trying top roll. Just here in Bulgaria, she has no other women to experiment with.
SPEAKER_04: Yes, she's training her top row, but we're not sure at what level she's against other top rowers. Against hook pullers, her top row is good. Yeah. We got a question from Carolina Pettersson before now when Ayane is not here yet. Have you ever lost a final in your weight category before or ever? Yes.
SPEAKER_03: 2017 at the Europeans from Alina Volkova. Yeah, okay.
SPEAKER_01: So people are also asking where Ayane is and she was supposed to join us with a translator as well. I will see if she has sent me some message about it. While she's here. You can keep on talking. Okay, then I keep on talking. I have another question also from Carolina to you, Dimitrina.
SPEAKER_04: And that's how you would think about going up some categories. Like, how do you think it would be to pull in 65 or 70? But you mean at the Europeans and Worlds or at the Supermatches? Yeah. Yeah, whatever. You can... Like, at Worlds, I think...
SPEAKER_02: We think that Dimitriina could do a great job, but I would like to hear what Dimitriina thinks. She says, I don't see any reason to go there. Maybe I could, but I'm 60, so I don't see any reason to go there. She says, if there is supermatch,
SPEAKER_01: Maybe she could pull some girls that are 65. But for Europeans and world, when they're 60 kilos plus, she doesn't see any point to go 65. Yeah, so... Reasonable. I checked and I don't see Ayana hasn't answered anything. She was supposed to be in this interview.
SPEAKER_01: so i don't know um maybe she's scared dimitrina but you you haven't pulled against her right before she was in her category before but she lost back then so they never pulled
SPEAKER_02: I see. So what did you think, Dimitrina, when you were invited to this match at East vs. West? She was hoping that sooner or later she would get a chance to go at East vs. West stage. And when she was offered this match, she immediately said, OK, I'm in.
SPEAKER_01: So in the chat, people are talking Fia versus Dimitrina at like 65 kilos would be cool. Somebody said, what do you think about that match? I wish. Yeah, maybe we will see what happens in this match. Yes. Is there any other East versus West matches that you look forward to?
SPEAKER_02: yes you mean east versus matches that you or to watch to watch yeah from this event now yeah yes was it interesting
SPEAKER_04: She says there are so many. Almost all of them are made to be interesting. What do you think about Egle and Barbara? That's an exciting match. She doesn't know in what shape Egle is. Egle seems to be in a great shape. I think she looks confident and
SPEAKER_04: she's training a little bit different now uh i i think she's in a great shape yes she thinks that if eileen is in her top shape she would take that much
SPEAKER_01: the experience is on her side and she believes that if she's in top shape she would be the favorite so uh dimitrina how does a normal day look like for you at your arm wrestling practice
SPEAKER_02: you mean just the training or today yeah just the training when you go into the gym or to the army well i can tell you it's just for you five six guys training together and for example we're holding each other with two hands and uh
SPEAKER_02: For example, there is a junior who is holding her, and he's imitating Ayane's style of pulling. And Dimitrina goes to the table, she pulls once, twice, she leaves the table. In three, four minutes, she goes again, she pulls once, twice, she rests. And when her arm starts to hurt,
SPEAKER_01: just start stop rolling when the hour starts depart from the book just start stop rolling that's great so you are you are training like it was a super match very similar to that that you go up on the table you pull one time and then you go off and rest a little bit is that how
SPEAKER_02: Yes, it's pretty much the same, actually. Just for this match, we know approximately how per opponent is pulling, and we're imitating exactly that move. While for Europeans and Worlds, we do everything. We go hook, we go top roll, we prepare every position. But right now, we are focused more on bond.
SPEAKER_01: yeah but what if ayana would change totally and you have been training one thing and she has also been training in a different way that would be a surprise that would be not so nice surprise but but but she she has uh prepared in any position more more or less
SPEAKER_02: Actually, the way she's pulling, I mean, Ayane, is the most dangerous for Dimitrina, actually. And if Ayane changed something, that would be good. And how about pulling in straps? Dimitrina loves those straps. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: 99% of the time she prefers the straps. Yeah. You don't see much of Dimitrina on social media or you can't see so much about how she's training. Is that on purpose so that we can't see where she's at and how she trains?
SPEAKER_04: just she's into it she doesn't show her so much to the people yeah i think not to show so opponents can can really study your training and technique it's only from competitions we can see how you pull
SPEAKER_03: i'm watching uh ayane take out she came and it's nice to see you guys she just said that it's nice to see how your opponents are training but i don't want to show them clever but ayane she can like do uh one arm pull-ups um
SPEAKER_01: many of them i think in a row how about you dimitrina can you do it she can no not actually no no a lot more chest and shoulder but not so strong in the back
SPEAKER_01: yeah but it's not pull-ups that they will compete in uh at east versus west so that's good but um since dimitrina you are a little bit introverted as you said uh do you feel very nervous when you go up on the stage
SPEAKER_02: Last year, when she came back after she gave birth, she was very nervous in the European and world because of her absence for two years. I can't hear you anymore, can you? I hear them.
SPEAKER_04: and this year her nerves were way better there she was way more calm yeah malin are you with us we lost malin it's on us now no but that's it's hard to come back from uh
SPEAKER_04: from not pulling and don't have like, you can't, you don't know how good the opponents have turned for two years. It's reasonable to think that it's like what have happened in the world, but it didn't change so much for Dimitrina, I think.
SPEAKER_02: Yes, just she is maniac and she is training. I love her. She would like to train three times a day, but because she has a baby and she can only train twice. Now I'm back again. I had some problems with my microphone.
SPEAKER_02: so uh how in bulgaria uh how many women are pulling not many actually there is no other serious is pulling at the international level
SPEAKER_02: Bozo's wife. Bozo's wife. You mean Bozo's wife? Yes. Bozo's wife. Yes. She will start to pull now again. Are you training together? Or is she far away? Right now they live in another city.
SPEAKER_01: okay so but from what i heard she's now starting to train again so so uh i heard before when we were talking about preparing for this match that dimitrina you are um
SPEAKER_01: really analyzing Ayane, how she's arm wrestling. But when you prepare for a tournament, is that a lot different? Do you just practice everything or what you, how you like to pull or how do you prepare for a tournament like the World Championships, for an example? Marlin, I already answered this question. You don't hear me?
SPEAKER_02: For the European and world, we are preparing everything. Yeah. We imitate hook, top roll, everything. And everything is about 50% against top rollers. And right now, for example, 78% of our opponent and 20-30% for the other possibilities.
SPEAKER_02: yeah yeah that's right how do you train endurance at the table when you're stuck with somebody in the middle of the table and you hold there and you get endurance okay how is it i i mean you you do something different for endurance
SPEAKER_04: No, but I thought you said that now for this match you are pulling like it sounded like fast two matches and then rest for three minutes and then back and do too fast. Is this like explosivity training for this?
SPEAKER_02: Or you mix together with the endurance? Most of our training is for exclusivity power because we believe that the strength is the most important factor, not the endurance. If you're stronger than your opponent, most likely you will win. If you're pretty close, then the endurance comes as a factor. But we believe that the strength is the most important.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah. But we train differently, right, Fia? I mean, we go to the gym and we train like, I guess, most of them. This is a different view, I think, that not many people are training like Dimitrina in this way, but it has been really successful to do it. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: If you want to be good at one thing, you have to practice that thing. So it's understandable. But I think we have problem to get together coolers for like several days a week. It's very hard. People can't make it. Yeah. And also I think maybe that would be like
SPEAKER_02: you get used to it but for me to arm wrestle several days in a row it really hurts my my joints a lot the thing is that this type of training that we are practicing we don't pull with equal opponents we use two hands to pull each other and with three specific movements we don't pull for real if you pull
SPEAKER_02: For Rio, you just get hurt. Rio armwrestling is part of the career. Dimitrina, do you work with something else or can you just live on your armwrestling?
SPEAKER_02: She has a daughter who is two years old. And until two months ago, she was, I don't know how to say it, but from the government, when you give a birth, they give you money for about two years. And right now, from two, three months, she's just depending on the arm wrestling. Nice. That's a dream. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: For me, yeah. So, Fia, do you think, what matches are you looking forward to, East versus West 13? Oh, I'm glad you asked. I have prepared for this. Oh, that's good. Yeah, of course, I'm looking forward to the lady matches. That's my... That's...
SPEAKER_04: what i'm most excited about and it's uh barbara against eggly and carolina against olga and dimitrina ayane so it's three ladies matches that yeah very cool um otherwise i i have um like it uh prudnik have had some uh fun
SPEAKER_04: at social media and that's why I'm very excited also for that match. It's Prudnik against Irakli. Krasimir has a match. That's cool. Against Todd Hutchins. How do you think about that, Krasimir? I'm preparing very seriously. I've been wanting this match for already
SPEAKER_02: years so i'm giving my best on the training so let's see how cool then this match will be very exciting too this is the the most uh awaited match for me so so long so many years i didn't know i have not heard you talking about thoughts he beat me 2012
SPEAKER_02: Bulgaria. After that he beat me in 2015 in Russia and after that he beat me in 2018 in Moldova. So he beat me three times. Was that supermatch or was it tournaments? The first time it was supermatch and the other two times it was tournaments. Okay. Okay. So you want revenge? Very bad.
SPEAKER_02: And Travis Badjant is having a match too. Yeah. Coming back to the big stage again. Yeah. Did you see that meme that Badjant will destroy Kalina? Have you seen this? I haven't seen that one. No? No.
SPEAKER_02: it's hard to see he's unplugging something where did travis put that out somewhere on his uh actually it was uh colin echenco that put this i think okay and um right there here up
SPEAKER_01: The guys think Pagent will destroy Kalina and then the father decides to turn off the machine. Somebody in the chat is asking Dimitrina if she trains with other top Bulgarians besides Krasimir.
SPEAKER_02: whoever comes here to train with us she she's training with them how many usually are at your practices six people yeah well yeah i'm sorry what did you say me her and four boys yeah yeah
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, so people are asking where Ayane is and we don't know why she did not join us today. We were setting this time because Japan is having a big time difference to us. So she was supposed to come and I don't know why she didn't come.
SPEAKER_01: But is there anything else, Dimitrina, that you want to say about the match that you will have that we haven't talked about? He's just expecting it. Yeah. It will be... It is the last week for training right now. The next week is the last week.
SPEAKER_04: one more week of training and after that one week for rest. And that's it. Nice. I think I sent you a message on WhatsApp. Okay, I checked earlier, but I will see. Are you confident, Dimitrina? Do you believe you will win this fight?
SPEAKER_04: Did we lose them? Yes, but I'm prepared for anything. Confidence is good. Now we have... We'll see here. Keep on talking. Okay. What matches are you excited about, Krasimir, other than yours?
SPEAKER_02: Hello, Ayane.
SPEAKER_01: Can you see her? So she told me on WhatsApp that the translator wasn't there yet and that the time difference, they thought it was one hour more till this podcast. Ah, okay. But yeah, and she didn't have the translator there at 11. But she's on now? She's on now, but she doesn't have the sound on.
SPEAKER_02: Hi, Ajane. Can you hear us okay? Yes. Okay, perfect. Would you prefer if it's horizontal or is vertical okay? I think this is good. I can't do it. Okay, that's fine. Sorry for the slight delay. No problem, no problem.
SPEAKER_04: uh everything about the time difference is a challenge can you turn the camera sorry because they said they told us to turn it yes thank you
SPEAKER_01: Okay, so whatever, everything, we're all good to go here, so. Yeah, we're so happy to see you. Thank you. What did you think, Ayane, when you got invited to this match against Dimitrina?
SPEAKER_02: She was really happy to hear that she had the opportunity to be able to participate at such a stage. She's really glad to have had the opportunity.
SPEAKER_02: How does she train now? How does she prepare for this match?
SPEAKER_03: So essentially her main approach to training for this match is she's essentially been trying to come across the strongest opponents that she can.
SPEAKER_02: So particularly at the table. But the way that she's doing that is by pulling with the male competitors that she can sort of get her hands on. So I think as well, you know, with certain leverages and things like that, she's been trying to replicate that by using stronger male opponents. Because hopefully it'll be a bit more representative of what the actual match will be like. So quite a lot of table time, it seems.
SPEAKER_01: lot of table time that's what dimitrina is doing as well you missed her training so um but do you train we have seen you do one arm pull-ups do you train a lot of other things at the gym or is it only preparing on the arm wrestling table for this match
SPEAKER_02: First of all, you are in the same class as Ayane, so you are strong in table time. I have a question for you. Do you do any other special muscle training after watching Ayane's gym lift? Special?
SPEAKER_02: um again it's just kind of conventional sort of gym lifts um so again with the sort of pull-ups you know pull-ups are quite a fundamental movement so as well as sort of the one-armed things you spin quite really heavy um you know with this two arm settings trying to get the sort of
SPEAKER_02: know that they're focusing on the weight um essentially but apart from that nothing particularly special i guess um well apart from the fact that it's very strong but um yeah no sort of secret techniques for them aware so uh does she prepare in a different way now when she has one opponent to pull against or
SPEAKER_02: if you compare to when she prepares for a tournament. How many times do you practice before a WAC or a tournament? Is it different now? How many times do you practice before a WAC or a tournament? Is it different now? Is it different now? Is it different now?
SPEAKER_03: This is a small sense. No, no, no. So.
SPEAKER_02: It is, it is different between compared to sort of a competition and towards the super match. I mean, obviously the big focus being that it's trying to, you know, assess the opponent and obviously she knows in advance that she's going to have that one opponent. So sort of assessing their weak points. I'm trying to sort of determine what type of practice is the best with regards to that. I mean, just having more time, whereas it's sort of a more general approach that she will take, um, towards her tournament preparation.
SPEAKER_02: sorry sorry just when you translate please talk a little bit slower because we don't understand you you speak very very fast and we cannot understand sorry sorry sorry sorry my apologies yeah absolutely and let's see i've got to the house sorry you know uh dimitrina is quite uh
SPEAKER_04: She doesn't show much on social media and stuff, what she's training and how she's preparing. And so how have you studied your opponent for this match? I don't know.
SPEAKER_02: How do you study such a player? How do you make sure that the player has a good shot? Do you watch the previous matches? I've been watching this player since 10 years ago. I watched it on YouTube.
SPEAKER_02: So Ayane has been aware of Dimitrina for a very long time. So she said around 10 years. So she's been able to sort of reference the previous sort of footage that would be available, whether that would be on YouTube. So it's essentially by just having had that knowledge, she would have already been
SPEAKER_02: you know, studying her opponents and she's sort of using those resources again in order to sort of try to get the best idea of what she may face in this upcoming match. So what does she think that she will face? How will the matches go when they meet on the table?
SPEAKER_02: How do you do it? I do it like this to win. What do you think I should do? I want to win. So in your case, you do this. What do you think about this?
SPEAKER_03: I don't think I'll be able to win if I don't get into the point of the kick. If I get into the point of the kick of the opponent, I probably won't win. I don't think I'll be able to win if I don't get into the point of the kick of the opponent.
SPEAKER_02: She thinks that probably the best approach for Dimitrina would be her hook. So Ayane says that she doesn't think that for her going into a hook would be a good idea. So she imagines that if Dimitrina might try to go into a hook, at which point
SPEAKER_02: know with that in mind she thinks maybe it's best to try to avoid the hook so she thinks maybe it might if it's if she gets drawn into a hook that she might find it difficult um and therefore she is going to try to avoid the hook and sort of been changing her training for that purpose so dimitrina what do you think about that what she's saying is it a good strategy
SPEAKER_03: it would be super to see this uh this match it live right yeah what do you think yeah i'm super excited about this match
SPEAKER_04: I think they have prepared good for each other. It seems like this is great girls with great coaches. What do you think, Malin? It's going to be super interesting just hearing them talk about how they will
SPEAKER_01: how they have been training and also to see who trained the best for this match. Will Ayane be able to keep Dimitrina away from the hook? It's going to be very interesting. I'm curious how many hours a day does she train? How many? Yeah. How many hours a day?
SPEAKER_03: So essentially, on a normal day,
SPEAKER_02: it will be one to two hours. But then there will be sort of maybe during the week, a couple of sort of slightly longer training sessions, but it's sort of about one to two hour region, which is currently training. Yeah. And engine that is asking here if and I hope you're feeling better engine.
SPEAKER_02: If she can show us one arm pull up right now. With her left hand.
SPEAKER_04: I'll just try this. All good? Very good. Can you do a pull-up also? I don't know. I'll try it.
SPEAKER_01: She says she'll give it a try. She doesn't know. Yes! Nice! Dimitrina, do you get scared? No. No. That's awesome.
SPEAKER_02: I said before about Ayane's forearms, that she has almost as big forearms as Egle. It's just a few centimeters less. Egle, for you, Shunji-senshu. For the other players, Ayane-san has the same height.
SPEAKER_02: She says that she's like, what? She doesn't believe it, but so we believe it. So she's surprised, but in a modest way. Yeah. Does Dimitrina have any questions for Ayane or the opposite?
SPEAKER_02: How many years it took to Ayane to be able to do an R pull-up? How many years did it take to do this? This? One or two years. That's a lot of practice. That's about two years.
SPEAKER_02: She said in her case, about two years. Two years? Yeah, two years. When did she start doing pull-ups? When she was 12, 13? Futsu no pull-up was her first time. She was a student.
SPEAKER_02: um so she started obviously she started training pull-ups when she was about 10. uh and at what age she was able to perform one arm pull-ups
SPEAKER_02: So about two years ago, she was first able to do a one arm pull up. And what age she is right now? Now she's 24. So that means that it took her 12 years to be able to perform one arm pull up.
SPEAKER_02: But that's amazing. I haven't seen any other woman do that. Thank you. Ayane, do you have any questions for Dimitrina or something to say to her? Is she left-handed or right-handed?
SPEAKER_02: um so she says that it's she doesn't really know they're basically the same strength um she doesn't focus on one arm only that's interesting um the other question was uh
SPEAKER_02: Do you have any other matches at East vs. West that you would like to see that you're excited about?
SPEAKER_02: Do you have any other matches from the events? Do you have any other matches from the events? Do you have any other matches from the events? Do you have any other matches from the events? Do you have any other matches from the events? Do you have any other matches from the events? Do you have any other matches from the events? Do you have any other matches from the events? Do you have any other matches from the events? Do you have any other matches from the events? Do you have any other matches from the events? Do you have any other matches from the events? Do you have any other matches from the events? Do you have any other matches from the events? Do you have any other matches from the events? Do you have any other matches from the events? Do you have any other matches from the events? Do you have any other matches from the events? Do you have any other matches from the events? Do you have any other matches from the events? Do you have any other matches from the events? Do you have any other matches from the events? Do you have any
SPEAKER_02: Sorry, it's just the translating the names directly into
SPEAKER_02: But I have a question. Ayane, what do you think about Egle and Barbara? Who do you think will win? Who's your favorite? So she thinks Barbara is going to win.
SPEAKER_02: reason is because she thinks that this the weight difference um is just going to be too much um proportionally maybe might be stronger but she just thinks that the sort of the weight difference and the power that comes with that she thinks is going to um be a bit too much in this um in this match
SPEAKER_01: It's going to be interesting for sure. It's many people thinking that Barbara will win. And there is some that thinks, I think to me, Trina thought Egle. It's going to be a really interesting match. I don't think that Barbara is that dominant that people think. And that it will be a great fight. And Egle looks super strong right now.
SPEAKER_04: I think it's mostly women that think that Egle will win. Actually. We don't know. Of course.
SPEAKER_02: Maybe not everyone, but a lot of people are the same. Even if you're the strongest, you still have to win. Now F.E.A.R. is... Everyone knows that F.E.A.R. will win.
SPEAKER_01: What do you think about Dimitrina and Ayane? How do you think? How do you see this match? Oh, I see. This is so hard because it's hard when you
SPEAKER_04: when you hear them both talking about the match and they seem both confident and they have trained for this match and I know more about Dimitrina than I know about Dayane and I know that Dimitrina have been very dominant in the lower weight classes so for me
SPEAKER_04: i think it would be surprising if dimitrina lose but um i still would like to see a war
SPEAKER_02: That's something that I've seen before. I haven't seen Ayanee-san before, so it's not like Ayanee-san hasn't won. Because you haven't seen him win?
SPEAKER_02: The time is starting to run out here. Is there anything else you want to say?
SPEAKER_02: to each other or have a stare down. Last words. Not particularly on this end. There's nothing INA wants to particularly say. It's time to go. We need to train.
SPEAKER_01: I am super excited for this match and it will be great to see you both up on the table and be there live.
SPEAKER_01: uh i start to get nervous when i'm talking to you i also want to be up there um but thank you dimitrina and thank you ariana and hope that your practices will be good and that you can rest and that it will be a real fight up at the table it will be awesome um thank you all the best
SPEAKER_03: see you soon see you soon thank you thank you
