SPEAKER_04: Hello, are you an old armwrestler? Yes, my friend, I'm old. And I used to be an armwrestler. Yeah, Travis. Travis look strong and tricky and I think this match right before his match against Serhii Kalnyshenko. I think it built his confidence habits. Because when you are away for many years,
SPEAKER_03: doesn't matter you know you feel a little bit stranger did you watch the event yesterday roma unfortunately no but i will re-watch the uh i bought the paper i will watch today i was working yesterday entire day i have multiple jobs you know but don't don't spoil me please but i will get spoiled anyways i'm sure by the results yeah it it uh
SPEAKER_04: it helps me to choose athletes for the just you understand of course i understand yeah for the main stage for the real elite level you know it would it helps me to see how the clear picture yeah yeah
SPEAKER_03: i think i think you obviously i don't want to get spoiled or spoil anyone but i think you are somewhat satisfied with how it went yesterday from their manager's perspective from the organizers perspective from the uh uh armistice fan perspective as well i hope oh who do we see
SPEAKER_04: i don't know if they're asking much rumors you hear me well or not yeah we hear you very very well hello okay nice my friend my friend good to see you my friend bambino
SPEAKER_04: How are you guys? Everything good? Yeah, yeah, everything is good. Listen, what happened? Bambino, what is it, Bambino? I don't know. You always say Bambino. Yeah, he's scared, maybe, and he changed his mind. I don't know. He will join us, he will join us shortly. I asked Gennady, I said, do you want to join the podcast with Hermes?
SPEAKER_04: And he said, okay. And he said, do I make him nervous? He said that he makes him nervous. Yeah. Listen, we all know that he's going to come and destroy all of you, including Levan one after another.
SPEAKER_04: you and then devon and then levon he will just destroy all of you and then he will go oh see if he will start with me it will be very bad return for for him
SPEAKER_04: I think that you say this because you are scared of him, so you want him to pull someone else. Oh, come, come, come. Listen, everyone saw what he did to you in the last two rounds. Boom, boom, boom. And then you were, ah, my Brachialis. Oh. Yeah, I saw it. What? After you win, that are not important.
SPEAKER_04: Is it possible to keep the phone sideways or not? This? Yeah. No, now he will scare Gennady for sure. It's better vertically, but now we see bigger Hermes. But listen, listen. At that time, Gennady was injured and he was just trying to pull this way. Now Gennady is pulling sideways and then he will hit Hermes two times and Hermes will say, enough, enough, please, have mercy.
SPEAKER_04: Impossible, Michael. With my back pressure now, impossible to do. He doesn't care about that. He goes like... Yeah, for me it's a good technique with me. Yeah. And then next six months, your brachialis out of service. Just joking aside. How are you, Hermes? You feeling good? Yeah, yeah. Now it's a bit vacation.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, you're on vacation, yeah. Yeah, but still training a little bit. My shoulder has a lot of pain now. I made a video I think tomorrow we'll post on YouTube. During the preparation with Dennis, I had this problem. And...
SPEAKER_04: And now I feel still some pain. And now with this hammer, I want to recover very well after these two. Hermes, you have this shoulder problem. You have this shoulder problem for a long time. Is it the same place? Is it the same place? Okay, yes, I remember. When I found the lever, it started a little bit because I pushed it too much. This position.
SPEAKER_04: and now i have a time i want to to to recover 100 after this to to restart hey guys who are in the chat just stay in the chat there will be a surprise a little bit later you will see there will be a surprise about that
SPEAKER_04: That's not Gennady. Gennady is coming. Where is Gennady? Five minutes. Okay. Just call him and say, Hermes said that he is a scared guy. He's scared of Hermes. Right, Hermes? He's scared, right? He would come, right? Hermes is afraid to say that. Hermes is afraid to say that because if he says that... He will not have another time with me.
SPEAKER_04: What's that? Too much scary. Okay, how about you versus... You have too much scary with me. You versus Gennady in October. No, November. Beginning of November. Maybe we can do. For sure. Maybe or sure? After I check my shoulder. Yeah. I need him in two months.
SPEAKER_04: I think and after this we can do for sure when did we talk with you on the WhatsApp three days ago you show your forearm it was three days ago yeah you remember that you you show me your forearm like this like three days ago or something
SPEAKER_04: yeah yeah i think at that time you were training yeah i see training but very with very low waist elastic cable and without push too much side pressure because i feel pain but one second
SPEAKER_04: I showed yesterday the East vs West in Orlando qualification. Challenge, yeah. Challenge. Very beautiful. Yes, yes, yes, yes, my friend, yeah. He did very good. Yes. He did a very good job. Again, Hermes says that you are scared of him. That's why you are not coming.
SPEAKER_04: He doesn't need my translation to understand it. Did you reach him again? Oh, yeah. Yes, yes, yes. Tell him everything that Ermes said. Ermes said that his style is no problem. His side pressure doesn't work on him.
SPEAKER_03: He's scared of him. Just tell him everything, Roma. Everything. Okay. Gena, I'm glad you're here. I'm glad you came. I want to say that I don't have a problem with Gena's style. I don't have a problem with his style. I don't have a problem with his style. I don't have a problem with his style. I don't have a problem with his style.
SPEAKER_03: Yes, and I agree with what you said, that it is not a problem for me to go to the gym, to go to the gym, to go to the gym, to go to the gym, to go to the gym, to go to the gym, to go to the gym, to go to the gym, to go to the gym, to go to the gym, to go to the gym,
SPEAKER_00: He started answering, giving the reply, but then he was like, no, no, no, actually, first of all, let me say hello to guys. He was like, hello to your brothers. Okay, what's he saying, Roman? Just translate, tell him to talk.
SPEAKER_00: So he said that when I meet you Bambino, Hermes, I will say ciao Bambino, which means like he meant goodbye Bambino. He will beat you and then...
SPEAKER_03: and the the rankings he will be below here right below uh gennady hermes will be he's just breaking it hermes will be below gennady yeah yeah he's gonna beat you and then you will go down on rankings when when yeah okay tell him is is end on october he versus uh hermes
SPEAKER_00: No, I don't want to talk about this situation. I don't want to talk about this situation. I don't want to talk about this situation. I don't want to talk about this situation. I don't want to talk about this situation. I don't want to talk about this situation.
SPEAKER_03: he said uh no not like say October it's too early for him he needs to really really prepare for uh Hermes so he said cannot said that he would prepare uh for someone else just to warm up right before Hermes so in October no yeah after that he will come and crush Bambino arms oh okay
SPEAKER_00: Okay. I'm not 100% now.
SPEAKER_03: So, Hermes here, Gennady wants to remind you. He said that right now you are like very light with me, like you are joking and stuff. We get it. But he don't forget what I did to Devon and what Devon did to you. How about what Hermes did to Gennady? Did he underline that it happened after? Jerry, my friend. Okay, remind me the Jerry.
SPEAKER_03: He said that it all happens after Jerry. So after Jerry, Gennady got stronger, then he destroyed Devon and then Devon destroyed the rest. Yeah, he's going with the reasons, like whichever is most updated.
SPEAKER_00: That's it, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it, that's it.
SPEAKER_03: Gennady said that right now, Ermes is playing smart. He knows he's a smart guy and he knows that I'm coming from the injury and it's the best way to beat me this time. But no, no, no. When I face you, Ermes, I will be in the best shape possible. Okay, Ermes, do you have any opinion about this?
SPEAKER_04: He's offering you left-hand match. I don't want to wait too much. Then, Hermes, he told you if you don't want to wait, we can do left-hand match.
SPEAKER_04: Roman, ask Gennady. Can he pull two matches in one and a half months? One in September and one beginning of November?
SPEAKER_00: I don't know. I don't know what the situation is. I don't know what the situation is. I don't know what the situation is. I don't know what the situation is. I don't know what the situation is. I don't know what the situation is. I don't know what the situation is. I don't know what the situation is. I don't know what the situation is.
SPEAKER_00: . . . .
SPEAKER_03: he uh gennady doesn't want to give like false promises because he's himself not sure he said it's possible but he's coming from the very very strong uh heavy injury he said that this operation surgery was like seven hours long they did really good it allowed me to prepare very very well and recovery process is going very good but if he says that okay i will do like that and then something may happen yeah yeah yeah
SPEAKER_04: but he said it's possible no we are not making a deal here we are just like discussing of course and whatever he says there we i'm not gonna do a match you know set a match this way we're gonna talk privately as well you know um yes can you can you ask him who he wants to pull against
SPEAKER_00: Tota, you have to be honest with yourself. You have to be honest with yourself. Somebody who is not as good as Hermes. Somebody like below Hermes level. You have to be honest with yourself. You have to be honest with yourself. You have to be honest with yourself. You have to be honest with yourself. You have to be honest with yourself.
SPEAKER_03: He's open with suggestions. We are four people here. We can just discuss. No, no, no. I had him. We will decide. But I was just curious if anyone on his mind, you know, because just- He didn't have anyone specific. He's saying just no specific names.
SPEAKER_04: Okay, okay. Gennady, who is the greatest armwrestler of all time? You know, well, as I would do this, you know, it's greatest of all time. So did they see? Oh, John, John, John, John, John, number one, forever.
SPEAKER_00: John was a great player. He was a great player. He was a great player. He was a great player. He was a great player.
SPEAKER_00: In the course of a long period of time, this is the genre. I would say that in the past, people used to sing and dance, but now they don't. In the past, my favorite Levan song was Muda, but now people sing and dance, and this is the genre.
SPEAKER_03: So in Gennady's opinion, there could be many different talks about hypothetical talks who would have beaten like Prime, this guy versus Prime, that guy, he mentioned names, right? That's obviously, we cannot answer that. It's all hypothetical. But what John has done with his weight and during this entire long time period, the largest time period, nobody has ever done. And in Gennady's opinion, nobody will be born
SPEAKER_04: Okay guy like this to do. Yeah. Yeah. No, there is no doubt about that. There is no doubt, but again, impressive. Yeah. Just, just, I cannot see anyone. Yeah. But can you ask him again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again.
SPEAKER_04: Gennady was armwrestling like around after like half of the 2000, you know, like after 2005, Gennady knows. Can you ask him? He also pulled him. I think right arm as well. What does he think about that? Forget about the career, but armwrestling quality. Is the answer still John Brzee?
SPEAKER_03: This is a very specific question. You and I have been talking about this for a long time. This is your opinion on how you see John's career in the future. What do you think? How do you see the future of John's career?
SPEAKER_00: Is this also the case in the ocean? Yes, it is. In our case, it is the same as in the case of momigo, mag, stili, mere, me, dawa, mu, ga, me. It is the same as in the case of metuiton, when you take the bag out of the bag, the bag is the same as in the case of metuiton, and the bag is the same as in the case of metuiton. It is the same as in the case of metuiton, and the bag is the same as in the case of metuiton, and the bag is the same as in the case of metuiton, and the bag is the same as in the case of metuiton, and the bag is the same as in the case of metuiton, and the bag is the same as in the case of metuiton, and the bag is the same as in the case of metuiton, and the bag is the same as in the case of metuiton, and the bag is the
SPEAKER_00: I don't want to say that I don't want to say that I don't want to say that I don't want to say that I don't want to say that I don't want to say that I don't
SPEAKER_00: He is a professional in the field, he is a very good player. He is a very good player. He is a very good player. He is a very good player. He is a very good player. He is a very good player.
SPEAKER_00: There is a lot to be done, there is a lot of work to be done, and I think that one of the things that will be done with Maga is that I will be in charge. Because Maga Damiani is a very good person. He is a very technical person, he doesn't have a chance to do everything, and he is very good, but I don't know what to do with him, he is not a good person.
SPEAKER_04: wow my ears were burning what's going on yeah we were talking about you roman is gonna now translate
SPEAKER_03: Fadi Bardawil, Ph.D.: And then go ahead. What do you know? What do you mean with pleasure? So hello, Mr. President. So I will translate what Gennady just said right about you. He said he was asked specifically about the quality of your armless link, and Gennady said that
SPEAKER_03: with your matches, like you versus him, he learned very much. And until his injury, he used to do the technique. He meant that pulling through the thumb. That's how Gennady described it as he was talking. He said that until this day, even though you may not be the strongest shape that you have ever been, still you are impressing him. And he said that until this day, he's learning from you personally.
SPEAKER_03: the way you pull against elite young studs right he also said that uh uh at that time in his opinion when you guys pulled last time uh he thinks that there was the only way to beat him for you and you used it precisely so he remarked how precisely technique wise you um
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, Gennady said that maybe not in hook, not in top row. He mentioned several ways that John would not be able to beat him, but John found the exact spot where to hit Gennady and beat him. And that's when he learned that technique as well.
SPEAKER_03: And so he said he also mentioned there are guys like Devon, very technician guys. Some people may say about me, he said himself, cannot be said. And other guys, Hermes and everybody. But technically, like quality wise, that pulling the way you pull, John, he said that you are flawless.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, well, go ahead. Well, it just it comes from just arm wrestling at just a ton of people. And I realize what was effective by doing that. But yeah, I appreciate that. But yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I don't know. I don't remember our last match, what I ended up doing. Probably my typical pulling through the thumb and exposing people's wrists, which were typically weaker than their arms. I mean, it's funny, even the strongman, I mean, their weak point was the wrist. And I think that's what separates great arm wrestlers from, you know, just powerful people.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, yeah. There is a super chat. Just give it. Hey, and you love from the United Kingdom. From what you know, is Bursin coming back to the East versus West? Are you coming back to the East versus West, John? Oh, unless you cancel me, I think. Yeah, I'm sorry.
SPEAKER_01: scheduled to come back yeah listen I would cancel anyone's match except yours I mean you're the last person yeah no you got me you got me lined up with uh Leonidas which I'm really excited about um someone that's super strong that um maybe it's not fully developed yet as far as arm wrestling skills go but uh and then we'll see what the future holds after that but yeah no I'm still trying to chug along and hang in there I've been
SPEAKER_01: doing more shoulder work. And of course, I did that rehab for a while and then took about three months off of just trying to let it rest. But it's still a problem for me. But I'm trying to figure out little ways to work around it. The guys have been coming over. I've had three or four workouts now.
SPEAKER_01: I'm excited to get back in there. So I'll get probably another five, six workouts in before, uh, August and then. Then we'll go from there. I mean, it sounds like, uh, you're expanding throughout the world, not only just doing it in Istanbul. So that's exciting. Uh, some maybe other international spots and, uh, America. So yeah. Yeah. This year, this year, uh, just, uh, just be, he also sent a boat, uh, picture and he means you.
SPEAKER_04: of course this year most likely like almost 100 john will have two super matches but most likely he will have three super matches as long as john is healthy and still willing to compete but there is that it looks like that way right joe yeah yeah yeah yeah i'll be a senior citizen i'm turning uh as probably everybody knows i'm turning 60 and and uh less than a month's time so we're actually exactly a month's time so um
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I'm hanging in there, trying to hang in there. Yeah. Is your arm all back? Are you back to full force training again?
SPEAKER_03: Roman? Gena, it's your turn, Marta. Tell me, how did you get into the regime of war? Did you go to the maximum? Or did you go to war? What was your maximum? I didn't go to the maximum physically. I went to the concentration camps. I went to the concentration camps. I went to the concentration camps. I went to the concentration camps. I went to the concentration camps. I went to the concentration camps.
SPEAKER_00: If you don't like something, you don't like something, you don't like something, you don't like something, you don't like something, you don't like something, you don't like something, you don't like something, you don't like something, you don't like something, you don't like something, you don't like something, you don't like something, you don't like something,
SPEAKER_00: Yes, for example, if you want to lose 50 kilos, you have to do this, you have to do this, you have to do this, you have to do this, you have to do this, you have to do this, you have to do this, you have to do this, you have to do this, you have to do this, you have to do this, you have to do this, you have to do this, you have to do this, you have to do this, you have to do this, you have to do this, you have to do this, you have to do this, you have to do this, you have to do this, you have to do this,
SPEAKER_03: He said right now his training regime is not as his peak training routine, but he's taking it slow and steady. He said he's following the doctor's advice. Obviously, he's always keep in touch with him.
SPEAKER_03: He's taking it very slow and careful to really prepare and recover from injury. Well, he mentioned the weights that he can, for instance, like good, some good, decent amount of extension, biceps curl, like 50 kg he can do. And also mentioned wrist curls around 60 kg. He's saying that he's like on average of his shape right now, but he's taking slow and he's keep progress.
SPEAKER_00: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,
SPEAKER_03: OK, he said. Moreover, to his training, he said we have around one one.
SPEAKER_03: 110 kg it could be like 220 22 pounds those guys champions in in Georgia he's beating them uh with uh with ease so to say but he's saying that I know the level of East versus West and I know the level I was and for me to come back fully and like take on the real good challenge at East versus the stage right now my shape is not enough that's what I know this is that's good that's good that he realizes that you know he doesn't rush
SPEAKER_01: Yes. Am I the only dummy that's got the camera on the wrong spot? Okay, I'll try to fix it. Try to be like the rest of you guys. Is that better? Still working on the figure, figuring out how to work.
SPEAKER_04: And Hermes, John, do you remember the match between Hermes and Gennady? When I destroyed him, yes. How long has it been? I guess maybe I don't remember. Here we go, here we go. It was two and a half years ago.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, no, I don't remember. Yeah, set me up with what was going on at that time before the match. Okay, okay. Gennady was injured for many years. And then this was his coming back match. And he was he was afraid to go sideways. He was only pulling his elbow like this. Even then,
SPEAKER_01: Even then, Hermes barely beat him. And then, last two rounds, Gennady was like, okay, let me try. And then he started hitting, and he destroyed Hermes. Right, right, right. Oh, no, no, I remember. I remember it exactly like that, actually. Yeah. Look at Hermes. Yeah. That was at a King of the Table, though, wasn't it? Was that in Dubai? Yes, yes, it was King of the Table. Roma, Roma, Roma.
SPEAKER_03: Guys, please let me also translate to Gennady. He's saying that he's eager to know what you guys are talking about. Gennady, let's talk about your relationship with Hermes. Gennady, let's talk about your relationship with Hermes. Gennady, let's talk about your relationship with Hermes. Gennady, let's talk about your relationship with Hermes. Gennady, let's talk about your relationship with Hermes. Gennady, let's talk about your relationship with Hermes. Gennady, let's talk about your relationship with Hermes.
SPEAKER_00: In the end, in the fourth round, he was like, oh my God, he's going to win. And I was like, oh my God, he's going to win. And I was like, oh my God, he's going to win. He remembers also like that. Where are you?
SPEAKER_00: I want to see the background of the work.
SPEAKER_01: i don't i don't know hermes guys hermes i don't i don't remember hermes where are you at you on the beach somewhere on the coast yeah yeah scan let me see the the water the ocean where are you at where are you at on the beach on the ocean beach
SPEAKER_01: I'm on the ocean. He wants to see where you are. Oh, the toilet. That's funny. Basically the ocean. It's Devin that would do the toilet scene. It's connected to the ocean. It's connected to the ocean. Oh, gotcha. Italy is. Yes, I knew. I didn't know where on the coast he was. Down south in Sicily or
SPEAKER_00: As you just joined, Gennady was saying, Gennady read your name and he was like, the guy who has been fallen by me. And he's asking you to
SPEAKER_03: He's asking you to talk with him with us guys outside from your living room, so to say. Are you scared of him and that's why are you in the bedroom or why are you joining us from the bedroom? My boys are sleeping. They're sleeping. I'm in a hotel room right now.
SPEAKER_01: I came in here so I could just be a bit, a little bit quiet, a little bit quiet. Are you, uh, are you still training, uh, Brian, are you still out in the. No, no, no, no. We're the East versus West. Of course. Of course. Yeah. I didn't get a chance to see yesterday. I was busy doing other fun, fun things besides arm wrestling, but people are asking you, how do you see your chances against Leonidas?
SPEAKER_01: Just depends. I think my cupping in my hand is going to be solid enough to maybe control the match. Whether or not I have the drive and aggressiveness to go sideways is going to be the difficult thing. If he can stick me, then it's going to be a tough battle. But I think I can get maybe some advantage as far as the hand and wrist goes initially, but that'll fade quickly if I can't execute going hard to the side.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, I wish my, I wish my hook was stronger. I wish my shoulder was stronger, my elbow, my torso, because I think that his vulnerability at this point in time is probably in a hook. And I would love to just try to turn his hand upright and pull him, you know, wrist to wrist, but we'll see. I've got a couple of different ideas that I'm going to try against him, but I don't suspect it's going to be an easy match.
SPEAKER_04: Hermes, who is winning, Vitaly or Morozov? I think Vitaly. You think Vitaly is going to win? Maybe Morozov can do something with endurance, maybe have more endurance, but about the wrist, I think Vitaly is stronger. Okay, and Gennady?
SPEAKER_04: I have one question after this for one guy. I don't recognize him very well, but for this guy. You don't recognize him very well? Not too much, but one question.
SPEAKER_03: Did he look skinnier than before? That's why you don't recognize him? Okay, Gennady, what is your opinion? Sorry. Gennady said that he's not sure of a victorious guy between these two giants, but for sure he said that Morozov will tire Vitaly. Morozov will really challenge Vitaly Zenduris, he said. Morozov?
SPEAKER_01: he said the morozov will probably win by the endurance probably probably yeah and and and what's your opinion john right arm yeah i mean i think this is kind of the first time that uh battalion will have someone as big as far as heights
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I was just saying that Vitaly is going to be up against somebody that he doesn't typically go up against, someone that's got his length and reach and size. So it might be a little awkward for Vitaly because he normally just gets the advantage by going, you know, the high ground. I know Morozov likes to control the match and he's got strong cupping. So I can see it going either way. I mean, if Morozov gets a hold of him, I think that he'll win the match. But if Vitaly can, you know,
SPEAKER_01: keep it on the outside, then he's going to have a little bit of an advantage. Do you think that there is a possibility, even if he takes out, do you think this is possible for Morozov as Dave did it? We haven't really seen Morozov do that very often. So I don't know if that's in his head to be able to do that, pull that off. And I mean, it's tough for a big man to be able to pull that off. That's a lot of strain on the upper arm.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but until Dave did that against Laletin, we didn't know that either, that he could do it. Right. And Devin, how do you see that? Close. Close, close match. I think Vitaly's going to have to win quick. For him to do it four times is going to be difficult. Yeah, close, close match. Close. It's too close for me to call. I really like it. It's too immediate.
SPEAKER_04: very close do you guys think that if levan is going to pull someone end of this year do you think that this should be jerry versus kurdecha match winner or morozov versus laleti match winner i think he should be able to pick i think he can just go wherever he wants you want whatever levon wants i think just put him in so levan should choose yeah
SPEAKER_01: And the winner of the winner of those two matches are the very two top guys. So, yeah, I mean, it's it's probably best if he pulls each one of them individually. Right. Instead of having them pull to see who would pull the bomb. But. Yeah, but he's not got it. He can show you what he want to do. He won. He's the champion.
SPEAKER_04: I think the promoter needs to show who deserves more in this fight. I think those two matches should happen and one of the winners of these matches should pull Levan and then the winner of that should pull you, Hermes.
SPEAKER_02: And then the winner of your match should be the next match for Levan. Like beginning of the next year. For me, the massive question mark right now is Georgi Dzernav. How good is Georgi Dzernav? That guy, when he beat Rivas like that, I don't know. Yeah, he would probably destroy Hermes.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, but we can bet on him. We can put 20,000 for each of you. And we can bet for this fight. Me and you. You and after this with Gheorghi. One second, one second, Hermes. What did you just tell me? Listen, wait, wait. Did you just tell me the other day your weight is right now 120?
SPEAKER_04: Did you not tell me three days ago that your weight is 120? 21, 22, yeah, more or less. Oh, come on. 20 if I want, 20 or 50 if I want. If you want, you can make 150. And then they will have nowhere to escape from you. I can pull 95 right now.
SPEAKER_02: 80 kilo now. 80 kilo. I can pull 95 kilo. I can make 209. How many days you don't eat now? I don't need to eat anymore. Yeah. Very little. Very little.
SPEAKER_04: okay you were going to ask a question to devon you remember you said five minutes ago wow twenty thousand dollars what you want to bet you you look like 20 20 20.
SPEAKER_02: 20, me and you, if I lose, I give you money. If I win, I take money from you and from organization. Let me consider, okay? I don't want to say it right now, but I will seriously consider that bet. Which category? Very nice. Open, yeah. That guy looked very dangerous. Very dangerous.
SPEAKER_02: You might be in trouble. You might be in trouble. You're talking about you versus Devin? No, no, no. He's talking about Georgie DeZernoff versus him. Oh. Georgie would beat him, yeah? That's what I think. And that's what I said. And that's why he's like, I'll bet you $20,000. What then?
SPEAKER_04: No, no. He also agrees that he would beat you. I actually, I asked you, I don't know if he would pull you. He said, just give me some more serious opponents. He said, yeah, that's a scary match. That's a scary, scary. Yeah. I got, I got, you sure you want to bet $20,000 for me? Um, 20 million.
SPEAKER_02: really you really want to know i don't i don't joke him up okay okay we talk about it or dubai take money and you put on the table me and you okay okay this is not me this is not me agreeing to the bat yet but
SPEAKER_04: You have a very good chance that I will take that bet with you. But the match is not organized yet. I love, I love this. Love it too much. Yeah. Wow. Wow. 20,000. You were in Dubai, Gennady. You saw the match between Reval and Deserano. What do you think about Deserano? Do you think that right now he is in very good shape? What's your opinion?
SPEAKER_03: Roman, are you planning to translate or? No, sorry. I was answering the chat here. Thank you. I have to moderate as well, guys. Who is? What Hermes? I'm not asking.
SPEAKER_00: I am asking what he thinks about the desire to have to leave Reva. I am asking him. I am asking him. I am asking him. I am asking him. I am asking him.
SPEAKER_00: Zeran is a very strong player, he is in a very strong team. He is a very strong player, he is in a very strong team. He is a very strong player, he is in a very strong team. He is a very strong player, he is in a very strong team. He is a very strong player, he is in a very strong team. He is a very strong player, he is in a very strong team.
SPEAKER_03: So he said the way Rewaz and Zerano pulled each other, it was surprising for him, but it happens. He knows how good Rewaz is. And he said that probably it was not maybe a good day for him. Sometimes it just really depends on how you put yourself at the match table and at the day of the pulling, you may be in good shape, but on the day of the match, you may not pull at your best.
SPEAKER_03: So he is not obviously finding any excuses for Revas. He said that Zerano really did beat impressively. And he said that based on that fact, how Zerano handled that match, he believes that Zerano can have ambition to pull any of these guys. And he mentioned Hermes, he mentioned Devon, he mentioned himself as well, because he sees Zerano to have a really good perspective of pulling those top, top, top guys.
SPEAKER_01: okay thank you roman um yeah and john did you watch the last thing on the table you showed that i don't know against the robots no i didn't see that no i saw the after well i didn't actually even watch that one um i saw the uh which very impressed me a lot was morozov and metrashenko i mean holy cow i didn't think maestro had that kind of control
SPEAKER_04: um lefty but no i didn't see uh i'm not even familiar with that guy is that the guy that pulled todd hutchins in the 105 class yeah no this i don't know is the guy that beat perit osman and also before that he beat sergey kalnichenko but sergey kalnichenko was his comeback match after some long time okay yeah i'm sorry i'm not sending he's where is he from kazakhstan kazakhstan okay yeah
SPEAKER_04: Yeah. With huge arms. He beat Wagner Bortolato, left arm, and Serhii Kalnyshenko, right arm, in the same event. And then later he pulled against Ferit. And then he injured his wrist. Now in his comeback match, again, he beat Ravas. So come for two years. By the way, people are asking, Hermes, did you mean to pull Devin for 20,000? Or this, I don't know. People still didn't understand. No.
SPEAKER_04: Zerano usually like a contract. Plus, money from Devon. Okay, so you're going to pull against Zerano. The bet is about we'll be rich. Bet is him and Devon. Between him and Devon. A lot of money. Ah, Marta. Yeah. Yeah, I like that bet. I like that bet, Hermes. I like it. Yeah, me too, my friend.
SPEAKER_02: I like when I will see your face, give me your money. $20,000. I'll tell you, I think I'm going to take you up on that. I think I will. I think I will. No confirmations.
SPEAKER_04: No confirmation yet, but I think I will take you up. That guy, he looked crazy strong. No, no, no. I'm for sure super strong. But what I think for me, Reva was not in bad shape. He was too much weight, not the quality weight, I think. And when you are like this, it's not very powerful.
SPEAKER_04: yeah the match is that beginning of november rms gasparini versus george is i don't know okay the rest is between you guys i i don't really get involved if you're bad you know just yeah okay okay let's let's let's talk about travis's return what what did you guys think
SPEAKER_04: John, did you see the match, Travis versus Derek? I don't understand why you have too much scary for Travis. Now he come back and you leave immediately. That's how it always goes. Travis comes back, I get light. Why he come back and you leave immediately? I don't understand. When Travis shows up, I go down.
SPEAKER_02: When I come back, Travis retires. Maybe. Sure, whatever way you want to look at it. But I will pull Travis 100%. It's just, will he still be here? Travis is going. He looked good. He looked really good. His setup was just like he used to do.
SPEAKER_02: So, yeah, when Travis has that ability to set up right from high knuckle, he's super dangerous. I wasn't sure about him versus Sergei Kalinchenko, but now I think he's going to destroy Sergei Kalinchenko. Are you serious? This is what I was going to ask you. You believe really he's going to be steady? Yes. I think he will. I think he's going to kill him. Bang, bang, bang. 3-0.
SPEAKER_01: I don't think so. I think Travis just whack him three times. That's it. Done. It's hard to control Travis's back pressure when he's ready and strong. It's very difficult to control that upwards top roll he has. And he has three more weeks.
SPEAKER_04: Three more weeks. Well, three weeks is nothing. He should be resting now from now on. John, when I say that I'm not talking about training, every moment, if you are making a comeback, like if you have three months preparation after a long comeback, that three weeks, just seriously, if you have been active for the last five years, that three weeks doesn't mean anything. But if you are making a comeback, every week really matters. I'm sure he will be
SPEAKER_04: a few percent more stronger than the one we saw him yesterday. Was that Travis? Not bad. Do you guys think that Travis' left arm is stronger than his right arm?
SPEAKER_04: like what i just did i am i'm not sure about that left arm just remember his best years the competition that he had against the guys and then remember the level of the right-hand competition you know right-hand competition is always in my opinion tougher tough yeah just but yeah but his but his but he's a natural lefty his brain is wired for his left to be his dominant arm i mean i don't i don't care how much arm wrestling you do i think it's still
SPEAKER_04: know in his everyday life is he's he's a left brain left lefty arm wrestler question question like do you believe that morozo with left arm could be number one in the right arm rankings with that level i i am barely maybe top ten i don't think his left arm can even be his right arm my honest opinion yeah
SPEAKER_04: right arm competition is just a little bit different the only guy that just if you look at the one of five rankings i think that the left arm champion alijan murado is probably if you compare is not any less probably stronger than the right arm guys you know in the same category ranking okay well you're right i mean most people compete with right arm and focus on the right arm because that's always been kind of historically the the you know the prize arm but um
SPEAKER_01: Yeah. I mean, so yeah, in that respect, you're right. But Travis, Travis is like Dennis. I mean, he's a natural lefty and he's, you know, that left is, you know, super dominant. I have a question. If, if that house that he Kalashnikov stops Travis, but Travis takes the risk, Travis would still win that match. What do you guys think? No, it depends on where it stopped here or here.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, no, Travis, once he gets the hand and wrist, has a ton of side pressure. I mean, he can get rid of Dave Chafee. There's no reason why I don't think he can get rid of anybody on the planet as far as Zach goes. So once he establishes that high ground with the post, I mean, he hits hard to the side. Yeah, Chafee is not Jerry. I mean, he can do this, but not Jerry. Even Jerry had a very hard time to beat Travis that way.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, Jerry's unique in that respect. Oh, I have another question. I have another question. Sorry, Devon. You were there yesterday with with left arm with that coming versus. Travis match August and then we we are not sure because Travis said he's not sure what you saw yesterday and then we have two more months to do August 7. Two more months still not enough for no. I think that I think that.
SPEAKER_02: While it might be doable, I'd give Travis a few more matches. It's a big jump from Derek Smith to Camille. I'd slow it down a little bit. Slow it down. What do you think about Travis versus Brudnick left arm? That's much better. Or Travis versus Wagner Bortolato. Which one would you prefer? Well, I'd say that Brudnick is better.
SPEAKER_02: So, you know, Wagner's probably still probably an easier win for him. But I think Prudnik would be a good test. A good, good test. Yeah, I agree. And that one, that's a good match. Prudnik versus Travis, left-handed, that's a good match.
SPEAKER_04: That's a great match, because even the workup would be hilarious. Yeah, Brodnick is a funny guy. Funny, funny. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Genadi. Genadi. We had Brodnick and Irakli as the guest for the podcast, and we talked with them. And Irakli said that he had a very good training with Levan.
SPEAKER_04: But Prudnik said that his shape right now is better than the time that he'd be touching. Roman, can you ask what Genadiy thinks about this? Genadiy, I would like to say that this is not a joke.
SPEAKER_03: First of all, I would like to thank you, Prunik, for taking part in our video, as you said, you were with the Lebanese and the Bacheviks. Prunik, I would like to say that I am not the only one, I am not the only one who has experienced this. Prunik, you are a great man, you are a great man, you are a great man, you are a great man.
SPEAKER_03: Gennady said that Prudnik is a good actor. He can say many things here and there. He's just like Devon Larratt. He has no issues with saying anything. Yeah, but does Gennady think that Devon and Prudnik are the type of guy that only talk but never walk?
SPEAKER_03: Gena, do you think that Prudnik and Deoni are the kind of people who will be able to do it? No, no, there are a lot of people who will be able to do it, and Prudnik will be able to do it.
SPEAKER_03: No, no, no. He's saying that obviously these guys, Larratt and Prudnik, they both have done huge and they have succeeded their last part of their armwrestling career. Obviously, they have achieved much and they proved themselves as well. But, however, he said that their tongue
SPEAKER_00: is like in advance of their actions so they first talk and then they become so okay
SPEAKER_03: He keeps talking about this subject. He said that, for instance, if you talk too much to Hermes, you will be affected. Hermes will get affected about this. But with me, no. He is telling you, Hermes, you have a weak mind. That's what he is saying. Yeah, he has a weak mind.
SPEAKER_03: Kenadi, remember one thing, you will never beat me, never your life. With Devon, he came, but with me, impossible.
SPEAKER_03: How do you know, Hermes, that it was actually intentional that Gennady was giving you the wrist because he wanted to push that style? Have you seen Larratt taking his wrist?
SPEAKER_00: he was saying that he was giving the wrist up he was giving up the wrist because he wanted to pull that style okay no problem no problem better bambino
SPEAKER_03: What's he saying? Bambino, from this distance, even from this distance through the cameras, I see that whenever I look into your eyes, I see the scary guy. I'm scared guy. So you are afraid of me. That's what Gennady said. And last time in Dubai, we were friendly. You want to put this fight, but you don't want. Why?
SPEAKER_04: No, no, he didn't say he doesn't want. He just doesn't want the first match as a comeback match. He said that you are high level. You are too high level for his comeback match. He will come back with other guys and then he will put. No, high level, my friend. Easy. Listen, you versus Di Zerano, beginning on November. You accept? Let me know if you accept.
SPEAKER_04: privately and then I will talk with this. I don't know. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Beginning with, uh, Devon, what do you think about Leonidas versus John Nash? John, you better train buddy. You better train. I've been doing my best. I mean, John, I hope you win, but, but.
SPEAKER_02: I just made a $100 bet with Brad Grundy that Reganitis was going to beat you. Oh, no. So I should win then. Yeah, you got to win now. In effect, you're taking my money. I said, John will probably beat him round one. He might beat him round two. I said, it's going to be tough to beat him all those times. He's fully converted.
SPEAKER_01: Like, that's a strong dude, and he's a hard wrestler. Yeah, I don't understand it. I think I need to take away that hammer curl move that he has. That's very good.
SPEAKER_02: somewhat pulled with brandon allen that i can kind of understand how that feels especially when they get in the strap strong guys like that so he's absolutely like he's absolutely not too strong for you you know if you come in any kind of shape he's not too strong but there's resistance the whole way down the final party have a lot of power like what's same little bit same little bit king move
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but if John goes like this and if he goes like this, if he's here, John is here, he can still do it. Yeah, yeah, he can do it. Look, John can win. Absolutely, John can win. But the thing is, it's not going to be easy, and Leonidas has really good stamina. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: You don't have to be in good shape, John. I'm going to have to go for some morning walks to get my cardio up a little bit. Just a little bit. Just a little bit. John, just ask Devin. What did he think last time, you know, when you pulled against Alexey Voivoda? Oh, well, yeah. Yeah. He was fucking curling like 200 pounds. Like, I was like, what the fuck is this? Maybe the weight, it was perfect.
SPEAKER_04: You don't know. He was fucking curling like 100 kilos. I'm like, how can he lose? I thought he beat everybody. Yeah. There is a question for Devon. Just a question for Devon. After his training with Brian Shaw, how much of a threat is he? And who should he be his first opponent? He's ridiculous.
SPEAKER_02: ridiculously strong I think we need to take good care of him I think that uh his first few matches should be like exhibition matches like against like you know popular people or like uh you know other strong men like there's tons of strong men that we can put them up against like Eddie or half Thor or Magnus bring Magnus back you know matches like that that will kind of get them on the table
SPEAKER_02: Before we throw them against any arm wrestler that can hurt them. Cause that's the thing you worry about, you know, hurting a guy like that. But, you know, I think we give him like a year and a half, two and a half years. And then, you know, we start to, it's too early. He's too strong. And so we don't want to discourage him. We don't want to discourage him. I'll tell you, I'll play it. He's ridiculously strong, ridiculously strong.
SPEAKER_02: so he just has to get hardened up in the ways too strong everything everything is all strong if this is strong the rest is easy to build trust me where is the where where he need to improve um it's just it's i'd say just in the specific angles like you know like yes the wrist is strong but but
SPEAKER_02: It's crazy strong, but it's not the way that we train. You know what I mean? Like, like he's like fucking three times as strength as a normal person. Like, no, not even like he's three times as strong as like an arm wrestling athlete and all these weird ways, but it's not like donation. He doesn't do rising, but he can do it all. He mostly is grip stuff, like grip crush blob, like, you know, all the grip stuff.
SPEAKER_01: he's got to convert he just got converted all over um i think it would take him like a year and a half that's what i think i i agree the guy like you know he needs to build his frame of it the guys that normally hurt themselves badly are the guys that are strong enough to do it i mean he's he's got the strength that you say i mean it's easy to start snapping bones and detaching attendance at weird angles so yeah yeah
SPEAKER_02: I told him, just get on the table with weak people, like every week, like nobody that can beat you. He needed to train on the table a lot. I said, with weak people, like nobody that can really beat him, just get on the table, you know. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: It's not going to take long. I'm going to tell you, he's fucking strong. He's fucking crazy strong. I noticed just even the little matches that I watched you pull with him. His palm is like ridiculously long. He's like Richard Lepke's. That kind of thing. That kind of feel. It's going to be awesome. It's going to be awesome when him and all his big buddies start showing up.
SPEAKER_00: Gennady didn't answer who is winning, Irakli or Prudnik. He just said that they talk and this and that. I will ask. I think we all agree that Prudnik is better than Irakli. Irakli is in a very good form, he is a good player. Even if he doesn't play well, he is better than Prudnik.
SPEAKER_03: He said that had you asked him six, seven days ago, he would be not sure. He would say maybe possibly it would be, but recently he saw, he met Irakli. He knows how well Irakli is prepared right now. And he said, if Irakli delivers this shape, he will win.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know what the form is, but I don't know what the form is, but I don't know what the form is. I don't know what the form is, but I don't know what the form is.
SPEAKER_00: I would like to say that, according to the report, there is nothing wrong with the Georgians and the Magyars. They are fighting for their rights, but what are they fighting for? They are not fighting for their rights.
SPEAKER_03: Okay. He doesn't want people to misunderstand Gennady. He said that I'm not saying that just because he's Georgian. I said that I will speak in first person on his behalf. I said, I don't know how good shape Prunik is. I have seen Prunik's shape and I have seen how much Iraq has progressed. And Iraq's current state, in my opinion, will beat Prunik that I have seen and I know at 105. But don't get me wrong. I'm not saying just because I'm Georgian and Iraq is my fellow.
SPEAKER_01: And I don't know how good Prudnik is right now. And John, how do you see this match, Irakli and Prudnik? Well, I mean, if we're just going by history, Prudnik is, I think, always been a little bit of a level above. If we just compare some of the matches that Evgeny's had, you know, like the Todd Hutchins match that Irakli had. So I think if Prudnik even comes in at 90, 95%, I think he's
SPEAKER_01: Capable, definitely, of beating Irakli. So I would give it to Brutnik. I would say that he's got to be the favorite going in. But Irakli's so young, like Gennady said. I mean, he's progressing, so it's kind of hard to say how much he's gotten better. Good match. Another quick question, quickly. Todd Hutchings and Brutnik is set for Orlando. Wow. Do you think that something different will happen? Absolutely.
SPEAKER_01: i don't know i don't i've never had any first-hand experience with evgeny i mean on the table so i don't know where he's going and the directions he's pulling but it boggles my mind to know that anybody could take todd hutchins off center like that that easy but you know uh david did it and uh predicted it so there is a key to doing it um yeah so uh i don't know i haven't i haven't spoke with todd hutchins i don't know if he's you know mentally ready to
SPEAKER_01: you know, to redo that match. He's obviously gotten way stronger in the last, you know, year or so. He's really, I mean, Kamani looks incredible. I expect he's going to just, you know. That match was two years ago. That match was two years ago, yeah. Yeah, yeah. But Todd was at the top of his game a few years ago. I think he must be mentally ready to try something different or he's got something figured out for sure.
SPEAKER_03: He's redoing that match. Devon, what's your opinion? Very close. Go ahead, Devon. Sorry. Yeah, close match. Initially, I was thinking Prudnik,
SPEAKER_02: Um, but, uh, yeah, I think that, uh, the Rackley's back pressure is just becoming completely ridiculous. Like I think that his hammer ability is just getting, it's getting really, really just silly, silly, silly. So I'm not sure anymore. Um, but if I had to bet, uh, I would very cautiously bet on Prudnik, but it's, I don't think it's, I think it's really close. Like, I think it's like 51, 49. It's at this point. I don't know. I don't know.
SPEAKER_04: And Hermes? I think he's in the same shape as when he was with Toda. He said he's better now? I don't think. You don't think? No, not true. Oh, so he's just playing mind games? Yeah, yeah. He lost with Kalinchenko. Yes, it was not a competition.
SPEAKER_04: Hermes, in two, three months, things may change sometimes. Especially if you are changing your decisions, you are making decisions different than before. No, not one month ago. It was more than that. It was the time that you did a left-arm training with Kurdeca, I think. No?
SPEAKER_04: No, it was Italy event. This one was what? Switzerland or Italy? No, it was at least two months ago. Come on. Two months ago. Listen, April event was almost two months ago. April, April. The Devon versus Gennady match was April 20. It was almost two months ago. This was long before that. It was probably three months ago. Okay, whatever.
SPEAKER_04: I think Brüning has more advantage to hook. For power, I think Irakli. I think Irakli is a little bit favorite, like 51%. This is at 105, Ingen? 105, but 105.
SPEAKER_04: No championship, John. No championship. It's just 105. This was like, exactly right now he said that he is 100 kilos, 220. And he is going to cut to 215 or less because he said that he feels better when he loses the unnecessary water. But Frutnik for sure will be 105, maybe even heavier.
SPEAKER_04: When I say heavier, after the weigh-in, don't get me wrong. Okay, refresh my memory. Who holds the 105? Is David giving up the 105 title, or is he still the 105 champion? No, he's pulling the world title match against Petrenko. But listen, listen, John. I know you're not following closely, but at least you followed what happened, right? Ongarbe and Petrenko. Yeah, I saw Petrenko just kill, yeah, Ongarbe. So now, Dadikian and Ongarbe were pulling, and they...
SPEAKER_04: If Dadikyan wins in August event, he's going to pull for the world title against Michael Todd. Okay. If Petrenko wins, then Dadikyan is going to America, but not as a challenger for the title because Petrenko doesn't have the visa, Dadikyan has the visa. Okay.
SPEAKER_04: Petrenko is the 105 champion now, or David is? No, it's David, David. But Petrenko is now challenger. Next month, yeah. Like, not next month, just three weeks later, 20 days later. Right. Yeah, there's so many guys in the mix in that 105. I mean, Prudnik and, you know, Reckley, the winner of that definitely deserves a shot at the 105. So, yeah. So, who's winning, Reckley? Or Prudnik, you said? I think Prudnik. Prudnik, yeah, yeah, okay. What were you saying, Devon? Sorry.
SPEAKER_04: I got to go. I got to go. Easy day. I'll see you guys soon. Good luck on your morning walks. Before you go, very quickly, Samusha or Sasho, 85 kilos? Sasho. I think Sasho. Sasho? I think so. Yeah, Dave is asking you the last question. Devon, was Arun...
SPEAKER_04: baiting james in left arm like he's saying that he was just letting him go with left arm no probably no right no just right arm is different two different right compared to the james right and left difference out on with right arm much dominant than the the left arm yeah yeah we're really happy we're really happy with how it went we it's great everything worked perfect yeah
SPEAKER_04: Once James beat him in strap, I thought that when he went to strap the second time, he could again win. But I think the buckle, I don't know if buckle made that much of a difference. It did. It made a little bit of difference and Auden adjusted his technique a little bit. Auden was the better arm wrestler. Technically, he's a lot better.
SPEAKER_02: James is really strong. I think it was a great victory for Ogden, you know, technically speaking. I think, you know, we're really happy. We're really proud of him around here. Yeah. Devon, the last one. Mindaugas. If Mindaugas pulls Hunter, is it too early for Hunter? Look, I am such a huge fan of this young Hunter Knopf. I think that he's really got something special going on. Really, really.
SPEAKER_02: I think Mendoza is still a little bit of a step personally. Now, Hunter thinks he can beat everybody, and that's great. That's great. But I would like to see him progress just a little bit more slowly outside of the USA. You know, I think that he has incredible potential. This guy is really like...
SPEAKER_02: Anybody who's arm wrestled him, you feel it right away. He's quite unique. He can really, really hook. Really hook. It's rare. I don't feel a lot of guys who can really force a hook like he can. And he's got a lot of really, really powerful, unique characteristics. But I think right now Mendoza will probably still be a bit too much for him. But I'd like to see him get... How about someone like Christo?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, perfect. Yeah, yeah. Okay, Devon, we are not going to keep you. Yeah, take care. We'll see you in Istanbul in a couple weeks. John, get that walk going. I want to lose my money. I want to lose my money. Hermes, tell us that you are coming to Istanbul. Take care, Devon.
SPEAKER_04: Tell us that you are coming to Istanbul. I don't know. I'll buy you spaghetti, Hermes. I'll buy you spaghetti. Okay, so let's do the prediction for every match. John, Hermes is the guy that I can joke.
SPEAKER_04: as comfortable as possible he knows that you know i see him like a younger brother and i you know he knows my intention so he is the one that i i tease the most but he knows that i love him you know right no i think you know the login okay okay so john samusha versus sascha very quickly
SPEAKER_01: It's 85, you know, 187 world title match. You see how he's beating everyone. When Sasha pulled you, he was 209. Now he's going to 187. I don't think that'll be hard for him. I think he'll maintain every bit of strength that he has. I mean, you know, the 95 was a stretch for him. I doubt if he even weighed anywhere near that. So I have to agree. I would think Sasha is probably the favorite going in. I mean,
SPEAKER_01: yeah i mean it is just because of his size and i mean it's that's going to be a tough order for uh david to david to you know go up a class so he is his eighth title win in a row and now your thing is ended well is that his class though i mean or is he jumping up a class
SPEAKER_04: Oh, no, this 187, this is the category that Samusha won eight title matches in a row. Okay. So Sasha is losing a weight to make that class. Yeah, Sasha is losing. Sasha usually pulled 198 at Woff and Europeans, and now he's making lower category, and Samusha is going up. Well, I guess it just depends on how much it affects him, the weight loss. But, yeah, I would think Sasha was probably going to be the favorite going into that one.
SPEAKER_01: But I have no idea. And I don't I don't mess with those other than I did pull Sasha. I mean, it's hard for me to gauge when you don't have firsthand knowledge on how they are strong there by pulling with them on the table. I have zero. So I'm not. What was your what was your prediction? I forgot Morozov versus Vitaly.
SPEAKER_01: I say if Vitaly can keep it outside, Vitaly will win, but if Morozov's able to have any kind of control at all, any kind of cup, then Morozov. I think Morozov's stronger, but Vitaly does have that high hand top role, but
SPEAKER_01: Morozov is just as big a guy as Vitaly. So it's going to be very, you know, new to Vitaly to be dealing with someone as big and tall as him. So I wouldn't be surprised if Vitaly has a hard time. But if he's able to keep it outside, then yeah, Vitaly. Okay, Ermes, you about Sasho versus Samusha? Sasho. Sasho. And Travis versus Serhii Kalinchenko?
SPEAKER_01: Your mind a little changed since what you saw last night or not at all? 50-50, really. 50-50. And you know that here, right, John? I think Travis, if Travis's hammer curl is back anywhere close to what it was when he pulled Chafee at the WAL, which I have no reason to believe it's not, even though, you know, yeah, he's, you know, if...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I think I think he's going to be able to keep it outside. I don't think. Yeah, so I'm going to go with Travis. OK, OK. You know. Todd Hutchins is looking super strong right now, but I've seen a little bit of video of. I'm drawing blank.
SPEAKER_01: What's that? Just a little bit video of what? Of Hutchins. He looks like he's in super, super shape. President Mayer looks big also, so it's hard to say how strong he's coming in. I know he wants it. Yeah, no, that's going to be a close one. It should be a fun one, too, because it should go inside. I don't think either one of them are going to go outside.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, and do you think that Krasimir has endurance to do that? Yeah, no, he's shown in his past that he has the ability to go super long matches, but Todd Hutchins is also the endurance king, so this could be a long, drawn-out hook match for sure. And Hermes? I think it's Hermes' internet connections. Okay. Hermes?
SPEAKER_04: I think so that. So touching is going to win. Okay. Okay, guys. I don't want to keep you guys so long. It has been like almost one and a half hour. And John, see you in August, Orlando, hopefully. I'll be there. If I can make it, just get ready. And so thank you very much for joining. All right.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, we'll see. We'll see you all in August. Yeah, yeah. You take care of yourself as well, my friend. Thank you very much. Thank you. I see you soon. Roman, thank you very much for helping my friend. Thank you. Yeah, thank you. And I must try to make it Istanbul. Even even for today's try to come to Istanbul even for. Yeah, if I can for sure, I would come. Yeah. You look good, by the way. You look good.
