SPEAKER_01: How are you, my friend? I didn't forget about what you just asked me. I'm going to do some calculations before I answer you. No, I won't be going to Dubai, Adnan. Hello, hello, Richard.
SPEAKER_01: um the plan is to do the preparation for east versus west 13. hello hello enlarged pronator look at the skinny arms i can't believe that they got so skinny you know i need to really i can't believe that i don't know when last time i had this skinny arms you know
SPEAKER_01: I will start training. Yes, yes, Sergei is just all the time attacking Travis and Travis just
SPEAKER_01: wrote a comment under the video on the Armwrestling Engin Facebook page, group, I should say. He said, let's fucking go, Travis wrote. Nobody's prime was unbeatable. Now they look so small, Adnan. I measured, it was like not even 37 centimeters.
SPEAKER_01: I have seen them 41 centimeter cold. Now it's 37. It's just Travis versus Maradona. Lefty maybe, maybe in the future. Hello, Ricardo. Hello, my friends. Yeah. Yeah, Sergei. Sergei is thirsty. Sergei is hungry for success.
SPEAKER_01: Hermes versus Levan match will happen after you beat Levan.
SPEAKER_01: Travis, I think he told me he will be 85% of his best shape, best ever shape. After you beat Levan. I don't know where.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, he still has two minutes. I think soon he's going to join. Yeah, Dennis Open YouTube channel. I heard about it.
SPEAKER_01: Hello, Marko. Hello. Hello to Croatia. Yeah, if I didn't know that Travis would be in very good shape, he told me he's getting ready for anyone. I wouldn't say that much.
SPEAKER_01: I will be drinking coffee and milk. Yeah, here is good. Here is good. The weather is classic spring weather. Classic spring weather. Not super hot, not super cold. It's in between.
SPEAKER_01: Okay. Still waiting for Qasi. Thank you, Allah. Did you guys see the video
SPEAKER_01: that Tata Ching posted on Facebook today about Krasimir. The video is a little interesting. Maybe I should let you guys watch if you guys didn't watch. And then, aha, Krasimir came.
SPEAKER_01: Hello, Krusty. How are you, my friend? I am good. How are you? A little bit exhausted, but still fine. So, your cat. Do you hear me? Yes. Yeah? Okay. So...
SPEAKER_03: How is the shape? Getting ready? Yes, yes. I'm doing the correct movements on the training. How sure are you about the strategy? From all my experience, all my experience is saying that this is what I should do against
SPEAKER_03: will be enough i cannot say but yeah my experience is saying that this is the correct thing that i should do what i'm doing so you are sure of your strategy but the power will be enough or not the time will show yes yes yes yes yeah actually i'm confusing about the strategy if i have to be honest because there are two types of uh
SPEAKER_03: pulling that it's possible for me to pull against him. Play Babaev beat him and play the decanter. And I think one will be more effective for me.
SPEAKER_01: Let's see what happens. The way that Babaev beat him, do you think that it would be something that the way that you pull against Lachlan in later rounds? Yes, exactly, exactly, yes. Yeah. While the decant beat him more deep. Yeah, yeah, yeah. In fact...
SPEAKER_01: That was not the strategy of Dadikian, but he had to pull in that way. Like, he wanted to win in a different way, but when Todd catch him and bring him here, so he had to... Do you think that you have the ability to pull that way if he puts you in a losing position like that? Maybe, maybe. I don't know. I'm training this position as well, so we'll see. I'm not sure about the power, but I think that...
SPEAKER_01: Right now, I have the right moves to do this. Both styles. This one and this one as well. I have an opinion. I believe that without controlling Todd's pronator, it is impossible to beat him. Even with top roll, it is very, very hard. Because once you try to take his hand, then he also pronates. And then you both go that way.
SPEAKER_01: The way that Ongarbe pulled him? Yes, yes. Yeah, you need to control the pronator. But the thing is, when you control his pronator, can you protect your pronator? Or you need to give up from your own pronator just to say, control his and give up here. So important is to control it without losing your own. Yeah, on paper, I know what to do.
SPEAKER_01: yeah yeah i will be able to do it i cannot say but we'll see i understand we will see we will see and did you see the video of todd yeah yeah that's that's interesting i need to clarify a few things um
SPEAKER_01: He says that I am going to give him a sandwich if he beats you. Yes, it is true. I will give him a sandwich, but not the Turkish sandwich, but this is a big sausage sandwich. And he also says that I promised him a land for the farm. And that is an imagination.
SPEAKER_01: I'm just, you know, just joking, you know. And what did you think about the video? I don't find it that funny, actually. I don't know. The previous songs that he made for Kud and for Irakli were way... Way creative? Yes, I think so.
SPEAKER_01: i don't know just my sense of humor was not touched by this video yeah i somehow people loved it people were different yeah he sent me the video and i didn't know if you expected me to post it i kind of find it a little bit offensive so and so he posted himself
SPEAKER_01: I don't find it offensive. You don't? Okay. No, I'm not sure. Let's see, let's see. But this match is very important. Looks like he has beaten all the Bulgarians around his category until today.
SPEAKER_01: for this for this or that reason did you also have a super match with him you had it right you had a super match 2012. okay how how what was the score of that one zero he won what fortune or six zero it was six zero six zero it was four new and i stopped i understand yeah yeah um for the moment i
SPEAKER_03: against all the top pullers under 100 kilos, except for Hutchinson. So if I beat him, I can say that I beat all the top pullers for the last 10 years in hook. So he's the only one. He has the only scalp that I miss in my collection. Probably there are some others.
SPEAKER_03: From the last 10 years, I don't think that there are others. Like Arsene? Yeah, no, Arsene. I mean, hook pullers. Oh, hook pullers, hook pullers. Sorry, sorry. I missed that part. Yeah. That will be interesting. And actually, I think that he beat...
SPEAKER_03: I think there is a problem with your microphone. Maybe is it touching anywhere or something? No, right? No? I said that... Now it's better. He beat all the other hook pullers under 100 kilos except for Rustam.
SPEAKER_01: And I beat all the others except for him. So let's see what happens now. Yeah, that's a big one. And I think it's just a little bit personal from the Bulgarian side that he's all the time talking. Now he owns something from Bulgaria. He beat Golemanov, he beat Sasho, he beat Jordan Stoner.
SPEAKER_03: Yes, the thing is that he has the right to talk because he had beat all the other guys as well. But I can tell you one other story. Until 2016, until the LAWF 2016, I beat all the Georgians that I met at that point. You never had a loss against a Georgian? Until that moment, until the LAWF 2016. Oh, you mean the 11 match?
SPEAKER_03: No, no. At the Europeans 2016, I beat Levan and Gennady. Yeah, and the Worlds? And at the Worlds, Gennady beat me, damn. Oh, Gennady. He was the first Georgian to beat me. But the point was that until that moment, they were calling me the Georgian killer because I beat all the Georgians in 90, 100, 110 and plus 110 kilos. Wow.
SPEAKER_03: In every category, I didn't have loss against Georgian guy until that moment. But after that, many Georgian beat me, guys. So let's see what happens with Todd Hutchins. Until this moment, he has only wins over Bulgarians. Let's see if something will change. Yeah, people say that something is wrong with the connection or something.
SPEAKER_03: i don't know it may be mine maybe mine i i will change internet and let's see if it goes better i just changed my internet let's see but i'm i'm hearing you good i don't know it's the same same here same here okay did you understand that part with the all the georgians yes yes yes it's incredible it's incredible like
SPEAKER_01: You two beat Georgians up to super heavyweights. And when you talk about super heavyweights, you are not talking about regular super heavyweights. You're talking about Gennady Kvikvini and Levan Saginashvili. And you're beating them while weighing under 105 kilos. It is amazing. It is amazing. And you deserve all levels of respect, my friends. Trust me. Incredible. Incredible. No, that is no need to thank. It's the truth, you know.
SPEAKER_01: one can only imagine you know one can only imagine being a little bit more than 100 kilo and then winning the uh winning against the best georgians and you're beating everyone 85 90 100 110 and over just just seriously i'm not extreme it's incredible achievements achievements yeah anyway so let's see let's see people people gives more chance to thought and less to you
SPEAKER_03: and how do you see your chances i don't know actually if i have to be honest i don't know you don't know but you are not coming there to lose for sure of course of course of course but i can i can show you something you're gonna show me your daughter no no i will tell you i will show you something interesting okay
SPEAKER_03: I'm sure you don't expect this. Just a second. How can I change my camera? Okay, what's that? Do you recognize this guy? Is that hot pink?
SPEAKER_01: Oh, yeah. Tata means. And the other one is you? Okay. Okay. Where is it from? This is from my birthday cake. Is that a cake? This is from my birthday cake, yes. Oh. So what is it? Is it like chocolate or something? Yes. Okay. Okay. When was it?
SPEAKER_01: A few months ago. Oh, and at that time, did you know that you were going to pull Hutchings? No, the match was not set yet. Okay, who made it? My girlfriend. But why is that? Because she knew that I want to beat him so badly. Okay, so that's what I wanted to hear, yeah. So she made this for me? Yeah, that is...
SPEAKER_01: That's interesting. That's interesting. Yeah. And she made that cake while there was nothing about you versus Hutchings. And then were you surprised when I offered you this match? I knew that it will come soon or late. I knew that this match was coming.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, and what was your last two matches at the rankings that we used? You beat Lachlan and then you beat John, right? Yes, that's it. Yeah, two matches, but those two are top guys. What was your score against Lachlan, 4-2 or 5-1? 4-2, I think. 4-1, it was 4-1, actually. Oh, okay, you guys didn't pull the last one. Okay, I understand. He pinned me twice, but the second time he was on the running foul.
SPEAKER_01: oh okay okay okay okay they are asking here uh which one is for the real man hook or top roll no need to ask this and you just won the europeans with left arm and it was very dominant performance and you beat the current world champion uh elchin
SPEAKER_03: He was the world champion from Kazakhstan, right? Yeah. The world's there. But it was a tough match, huh? Am I wrong? Yes, yes. Yeah. I thought that I'm going to win that match as well, but just he had better endurance at that point. Uh-huh, uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, anyway, so... I have something in my wrist and this is a huge hole.
SPEAKER_03: at the europeans now because for example when i attack after the goal with all my butt and if i lack a little bit wrist it's way more difficult to finish the match but if your wrist is iron yeah you curl more your
SPEAKER_01: opponent's pronator and it's easier. Yeah, that's the pronator that is just making all the connection. Once he returns, I mean, it doesn't matter how many kilo biceps you can hold or something. Just imagine that you have a dumbbell, but you put the weight a little bit more this side and it turns this way. I mean, it doesn't matter because you can't hold anymore. Yes. Yeah. So that is, in my opinion, the wrist flexion is the most important thing.
SPEAKER_01: First, the wrist handling, because at the start you need to be very strong here. If your wrist is already moving before the start, it will be hard to curl. You need to keep here everything strong to be able to curl. And this is the most important part, even more than pronators. You can, I mean, you can, but the more you lose your wrist, the lesser the pronator you can use. Yeah, but it depends on the style, actually. It depends on the style. There are some people like...
SPEAKER_03: for example, and Vitaly also, that they are not using that much cupping, but more pronation, so much pronation. Yeah, but they put the opponents into the similar position. I mean, if the opponent could do that to them, you know, I mean, they are not really taking the risk. When we touch this topic, I want to say something. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: on the these cards that you make the that you sell the cards yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah on that card devon's wrist is 10. in my opinion in the in the heavyweight is 10 in the supreme weight is 10. i think so and his wrist is seven maybe seven
SPEAKER_01: In my opinion, yes, he's not known for solid wrist, he's known for solid pronation. No, no, but for me, the wrist is something that you remain like this. For me, the wrist power is not curling power. Wrist power is...
SPEAKER_01: here or here to to to not to lose the wrist is my wrist power like you you lose here it's weak you you keep here it is like look at the first round with levan versus uh devon i mean it was not um but the thing is that he's not curling the thing is that he's he's not losing either but you know which one is for me two guys they do bad pressure
SPEAKER_01: The one stay like this, he doesn't have to do this, but he's not losing the wrist. But also this, I include the riser as well. Like this area. Devon stays straight and he just pronates. He doesn't curl at all. I understand, but he doesn't lose the wrist often. I mean, like whenever he pulled against, like Gennady, the match started, directly he hit.
SPEAKER_01: Whenever with Hermes, like Hermes curse, Hermes curse much stronger than
SPEAKER_01: Devon, like curing power is much longer. But once they put up by the back pressure, Hermes' wrist failed. Devon's didn't fail. But do you know why? What? But this happens not because Hermes' wrist is weaker. This happens because Hermes' back pressure and pronation are weaker than Devon's. No, Hermes' back pressure is stronger than Devon's. Just ask Levon, you know. That is why he was able to hold him like this, you know.
SPEAKER_03: But his pronation is not that good. If they both do like this, if Hermes catches his hand with the other... Yeah, this would fail.
SPEAKER_01: No, I don't think so. Yes, yes. Hermes' back pressure is much stronger. Do you follow the lifting? Do you see how much back pressure he applies? I mean, I even talked with Levan. He told me that he is not worried about his arm. He said his arm, Devon's arm, is nothing close to Hermes' arm power.
SPEAKER_03: Again, back pressure, pronation are different stories. Because just pure back pressure is not that effective for somebody like Devon who is going like this.
SPEAKER_01: He gives the center and this pure back pressure is fighting if the other one is posting. You have a dumbbell, you have a dumbbell, you understand? Just say that you put weight here, you may lift heavier than someone else. You give a dumbbell, the guy, somebody's hand may fall down if it is not strong enough. His hand is not strong.
SPEAKER_01: Trust me, I'm a top roller for 30 years. If both guys apply pressure, the one whose wrist is more solid, the other one fails. It is all about here. Coronation, riser, and handling power. Depends on the way you pull. If you are posting, it's one story. Trust me. The MS lost against Devon, the first thing we start talking already.
SPEAKER_01: how to make sure that he just trained. He didn't, he forgot about arm. He said he knows how strong he is, but he just focused here. He just focused here. And after the training, good that he did that between his Devon match to the Laletin match. That is how he beat Laletin. If he was in the same condition,
SPEAKER_03: With the hand and wrist riser, everything, against Vladez, he will lose that much too. Trust me. He barely, barely didn't lose his hand and wrist. He was just barely. It's not the wrist. The pronation was the problem. Have you seen Hermes' pronation lift when he tried to copy Devon's lift? No. No. He's losing because his pronation is lacking, not the wrist. This is my opinion. No, but what I'm just saying that
SPEAKER_01: It is like Devon didn't do this to Hermes. Hermes lost from his riser and everything. They just apply a little bit back pressure. Hermes' hand and wrist didn't handle his own back pressure. He just lost.
SPEAKER_03: it's because he doesn't have pronation he has super strong wrist and back pressure but not pronation if you lack pronation you lose the wrist i'm like this with my right arm when i go for top roll if i pull gergitsvetkov like this i beat him two heads versus two hands i beat him my wrist is stronger than him than his but if i try to do it with one arm
SPEAKER_01: I cannot do anything, anything. I mean, you talk about probably the strap, but whenever you apply this, this side of the strap is also enabling his wrist. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You are not doing it because you hold him and try to do like this, you will also lose your wrist. You just do that because of so much pressure you put from here and neutralize his hand control.
SPEAKER_03: So trust me, like I, Hermes, we both are doing like this. Two hands, two arms, two arms. And I take his wrist. I mean, I'm more solid than him. But when I try to pull him with one hand, one arm, and he's with one arm, I cannot do it.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know about your experience, my friend. I only know my experience. I know the conversations I have with Hermes. He knows exactly why he lost against Devon and what he thinks is exactly the same as me. Not like yours, trust me. I mean, if it was about hook, I would just trust me. I would just say, okay, whatever. But if it is about hand, wrist, pronator, just... I don't agree with you.
SPEAKER_03: just like devon who doesn't care so much about the reflection they just want their pronation pronator active and even if they lose a little bit from the wrist they compensate it here because they stop the match here
SPEAKER_01: And they are okay with this if both pullers are with a little bit back wrist, dropped wrist like this. Trust me, my friend. We are just talking for nothing because I know what I'm talking about. And no matter if you talk three hours, I mean, it will not change anything. If you say that the back pressure, trust me, the only reason the Levan couldn't beat
SPEAKER_01: uh ermine it because it he could not really control his back pressure and his pronator he still had this that is how he stopped him and that is how he did the transition he's here the pressure was very strong ms's back pressure incredibly strong probably even if you ask levan he will tell you his back pressure may be even stronger than the ones you know but here here is different
SPEAKER_03: that's the first part what's that i agree on that first part i don't agree i in my opinion hermes pronator is not matched with his back pressure his pronator is way less than his back pressure but when did you see him getting hooked my friend i mean i i don't remember hermes is getting hooked with right arm
SPEAKER_01: maybe even rustam bave in his prime you know and hermes was just a kid still even then he couldn't really you know he could his elbow went out the thing is that when your opponent is hook puller you don't need
SPEAKER_01: that much pronator. Sometimes you may just top roll him with pure back pressure. I mean, I'm a pronation master, you can say. I need my pronation so much, trust me. How can I not need my pronation? If the opponent is a top roller, I need more hand and wrist because he's trying to get my hand. If I have the control here, this will not be so hard. If the guy is coming
SPEAKER_01: directly in me then it is like the hand is not so much it just comes slides and it directly hits here you know it is the pronator of course you need it depends anyway if you are after four you don't need that much pronator you can just
SPEAKER_01: top rocking with pure back pressure. If he curves you a little bit, then yes, then you need pronator. But if you are straight on the go, you can just top rocking with pure back pressure. Just trust me, trust me. You need to have pronator against a good hook puller. If the opponent is good, you need your pronator. You cannot just say that, okay, I don't need pronator. Maybe I do only this. Oh, okay, he hooked me. That is why a lot of people, they just depend on their back pressure.
SPEAKER_01: Like, whenever I pull against Arthur in any fresh match, I don't even feel his wrist. I just, boom, his wrist comes like this. Of course, he won't. But, like, fresh or fresh, in fact, in his second super match, I would beat him 5-0. No need to be humble if I didn't tear my bicep. But taking his wrist, for me, I mean, it was like walking in the park. But whenever someone like Minda was, who says that, who needs pronating? Back pressure is enough. We saw the results.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, you understand that that pronator, you need it. Like if you are a top roller, if you say you don't need pronator. I agree partly on that. Let's talk about the thing on the table. Okay. To me, in my opinion, Krasimir, it is the best...
SPEAKER_01: King of the Table card, just my opinion. Maybe there was a match like Levan versus Devon, Levan versus Hermes, and Denis versus John, and things like that. But whenever I look at the number of the matches, and generally, I find it very, very high-level event. It is. It is. Yeah. Especially, there are a few matches
SPEAKER_01: that I'm very curious about it, but the most curious about Ongarveyev versus Petran Gomez, that I will be talking about it with you, which is your category, and I'm sure that you... Your interest is on the top rowers, and my interest is on the hook pullers, Lachlan versus Paulin. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: But how do you personally see about those two matches? Which one is more dangerous for you? We are on the same topic.
SPEAKER_01: on the back versus petrenko on that match we will see pronation versus no but why would i just forget all of my experiences and then just go and you say oh look at this mess and then we will just say no no just forget about that we will be arguing i crack my head with pronation top roll and everything you understand nothing you will say that will be will change my mind you know just
SPEAKER_03: I just said this match and I say that I see it for Petrenko like somebody who doesn't rely so much on pronation. He relies on super strong cupping and super strong back pressure. But also pronator is also there, you know? Yeah, but not that high level pronator. And on the other side, it's on Garbaev who is focusing mostly on the pronator in the defensive style.
SPEAKER_01: Also back pressure? Who says that there is no back pressure? He started with full back pressure and then he pronated. Yes, I don't say that no pronation. But Ongerbaev is focusing mostly on the pronator and Petrenko is focusing mostly on the cup and back pressure. And people like... Also Reiser and everything. You can't really squeeze the subject into one example, my friend. It is much bigger than that. Let's talk another time because we will not have time to talk all the matches.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, just another thing. People like Petrenko, who rely on the back, pure back pressure and wrist cupping, they want the match to finish quickly. If the match stops, it goes in favor of Kidergaly. This is my opinion. It depends, you know. It depends, like, so many things, so many things. It depends which angle, which position, what is just, like, there are, like, tiny bit, like, one centimeter things can...
SPEAKER_01: change the result, you know, it is just like, it is so hard to, as far as I know about arm wrestling, it is much more complicated than, you know, just like, like it can be a little bit mistake, a little bit, a few kilo more pressure to this side, that side, like, I mean, it is just, it has so many variables, you know, so many, so many things to consider. Anyways. I agree on that. Let's start with the school boy and Ryan Bowen.
SPEAKER_03: In my eyes, schoolboy is way stronger, especially now when I saw the way he beat Georgi Haspekov. That was super impressive. Does it mean that Leonidas is very strong? Yes, yes, exactly. I think he's very strong, yeah. He is, he is. The kilograms that Leonidas is pulling are just amazing. Just amazing. He uploaded yesterday, I think.
SPEAKER_03: With 70 kilos, hammer curls. Yeah, it was not that clean, but it's 70 kilos. Are you talking about the way that Devon does? No, no, no. Another video. 70 kilos, hammer curls. With dumbbells. With dumbbells. Oh, that's interesting, that's interesting. 12 repetitions.
SPEAKER_03: If that guy somehow transfers his power to arm wrestling, it will be very dangerous. He's becoming better. The way he pulled the schoolboy was very impressive to me. I thought, in my eyes, that was mismatch. I thought that schoolboy would just crush him. Yeah, I mean, I wasn't thinking like that crush, but I thought that he was gonna win, you know. I thought that he was gonna win, yeah. Yeah, but... And for me, it's strange how schoolboy...
SPEAKER_03: The match he lost against Khaled and the match he's lost to Leonidas now, I don't know. In my eyes, he's the favorite. He knows how to pull. He will just be the better man and the stronger man and everything. And somehow he loses the match. So... Just one second. I will bring charging. Really?
SPEAKER_03: So yes, guys, you should know that sometimes when you're a top rower, you need more pronation and not that much back pressure.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, in my opinion, Schoolboy is the favorite of this match. He is naturally bigger guy, taller guy, heavier guy. Yes. He's rich. I think that the best Ryan can do is this. And I think that he will be tall enough to reach. And I think that King of the Table also doesn't allow this.
SPEAKER_03: but he needs to be above the table and so then I heard that the schoolboy will dominate the first rounds but if the endurance be enough I cannot say because from what we saw lately his endurance is not that great and like yeah yeah but maybe maybe Leonidas has different level of endurance for some reason we will see very soon
SPEAKER_03: Yeah. Anyway, so let's talk about Pauline versus Lachlan. In my eyes, this can be a hook war. Yeah. I think that Lachlan is the favorite, but most likely it's going to be war. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: The thing is, I think Paul is more explosive. I think he will start more aggressive. He will start offensive. But it depends where the match stops. If the match stops somewhere that Lachlan can have his luck, then I think he has the edge. But if somehow the way that Paul pulls...
SPEAKER_01: would be the way that you pull him, drag him, and open him. And then if Lacan is out of his sweet angle, and then Paul can finish him. I don't know. I'm not impressed about this one. I think this will be the best match of the night. You think it will be the best match of the night? Yes. I don't see any of it going down.
SPEAKER_01: My sound is not great. Okay. One second. People say that your sound is not great. Let me try somewhere else. What's that? Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Do you guys now hear better, or is it the same, or how is it? Yeah, I was thinking, Krasir. His sound was coming to me a little bit cracking, but.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, so is it still bad? Okay. Hmm. Okay, sorry about it. Hmm, audio issue. I wonder why. Maybe, maybe, maybe the microphone has problems.
SPEAKER_01: That's good. Yeah. And okay. I went inside. People said that they couldn't hear me very well.
SPEAKER_01: I will put the phone right here. Sorry, guys. And now we can talk. Okay. So it is going to be the match of the night. And then the next one, Di Serrano versus Revas Lutuize. I think it is incredible match. I will really feel bad for the one that losing this one, two giants.
SPEAKER_03: and two guys that are really giving their all. What do you think about this match? Against posting style versus defensive style of top rolling. I believe the first rounds, Rivas will have the edge. In the later rounds, Dzeranov. I say 4-2 for Dzeranov.
SPEAKER_01: Is it because of the endurance, better endurance? Yes, and because of the style. You think that he's going to get him out? So you're thinking that Rivas is going to win probably early rounds? Yes, most likely. Incredible. I just can't wait. June 1st, I will just sit down. I will have my IC and some hazelnuts.
SPEAKER_01: What do you think about this match? Who is the favorite in your eyes? I kind of believe fresh match Revas will be stronger and I do not know how much stronger he will be. Will he be strong enough to dominate him four times in a row or not? That is the question. So you say 2-4, it can be that way, it can be 3-3 and then 4-3 or it can be
SPEAKER_03: all 4-0 just because he is too strong to win. Maybe in his fifth round he couldn't win, but maybe he wins the first four rounds. Anything can happen. I don't think that he will be able to win four rounds. I don't see it. Zeranov is versatile. He can hook as well. So I believe if he tries top row one or two rounds and Rivas just flashes him...
SPEAKER_01: I think in the third round, Dzerhanov will go inside. Anything is possible, Krastev. We have seen tons of things in this life. So the more you see, the more you know, the more you see many possibilities. Exactly, yes. But we just can't be sure until we see. I'm sure that even in the last event, there were some surprises. The last event...
SPEAKER_03: We were watching it with my kids in the fitness. We were training, and we took a paper, and everyone gave his predictions. And I guessed five matches out of 14. And the kids... Yes, right? You were wrong in the nine matches? Yes, and the kids, they... Seven.
SPEAKER_01: from 14. It takes me more than that. Yes. And you are arguing with me about the top role. I'm joking, joking. Just joking. And let's go. This one is also incredible. Like, I mean, you know what's going to happen, but, like, you do not know who's going to end up winning. Michael Todd versus Lars. People underestimate Lars, but Lars is a very dangerous footballer.
SPEAKER_03: He's very dangerous with that style, especially if he puts the shoulder. I'm not sure what will happen because we saw that Lars has also top roll. And before that match with Matawarangi, we all thought that Lars is just a presser. But that match showed that Lars can top roll as well. Yeah, but he tried to do the same thing.
SPEAKER_03: against valera and then he didn't end up with so i really don't know what to expect from lars and michael it's gonna be fun for sure it's gonna be fun and it's gonna be a war yes but what if michael also i don't think so especially not the first round later rounds it's possible do i remember something like this that
SPEAKER_01: Lars pinned Richard Lapkus in arm wars, and then later rounds, Richard also starts putting his shoulder and then start pressing him. Yeah, something like that, but I believe Richard's press is way stronger than Michael's. Yeah, for sure, for sure. No, I'm just saying that, like, similarity that
SPEAKER_01: Like he was pressing and then he came back and started pressing him. But Michael's press is also fast, quick. Yes, it's not that strong. He does it when the opponent is already tired. And so who's winning? I have no idea. Michael is the favorite in my case. Michael is the favorite.
SPEAKER_01: And the match, Kedirgale Ongarbay versus Oleg Petrenko. We talked a little bit, but let's go a little bit deeply. If you argue about the top, I will remind you of your prediction. Only five of them was right. I'm joking. I say 4-2 for Kedirgale. You know, this match is very, very important, Krasi. Petrenko asked me to set him a title match.
SPEAKER_01: in January event after the January event he beat Marcio and he wants to be champion he is really burning with the fire and from other side on Garbev he was three times champion of east versus west and then he lost against Tatachins he was so upset so disappointed and now if if
SPEAKER_01: If Petrenko loses, he knows that his title shot opportunity will be a little bit later, and he needs to win some other matches. And Ongarbe, can he handle two losses as the champion, three-time champion? He lost. So this will be a little bit heartbreaking match. I'm too emotional.
SPEAKER_01: So you are saying 60-40? Okay. I say 4-2 for Kidergale. 4-2, yeah. And then let's go to Laletin versus Kamil Jablonski. To me, people see Laletin as a super heavily favorite. To me, this match, anything can happen. It totally depends on the start. Yes, for me too. Actually, in my eyes, Kamil is the favorite with left, with right.
SPEAKER_03: I believe that he has the hook to beat him in hook. Because to beat that style with top roll, it's very hard. To beat Kamil, you need to have strong hook. This is my opinion. You need at least control.
SPEAKER_01: at least block with here his arm and strong copying and beat him i mean if you cannot do this at least you need to have some press but to do this for formation and then here the guy will just be here you know and it is very dangerous yes it is that's why from what i know that when he was here in bulgaria he said he doesn't have such a powerful hook
SPEAKER_01: With right, his hook is better, but with left, not that much. And that's why... Yeah. I mean, I'm not saying Laletin cannot win, but if Laletin wins this, he needs to come there with a very good homework. And he needs to apply his homework without any mistake, because if that guy puts the pressure, that pressure...
SPEAKER_01: maybe stronger than the pressure that Jerry's applied. I think it is stronger than Javis. Yeah, I mean, I'm not saying it is, but it's just so dominant pressure. But maybe, maybe he's applying to the left arm of other guys, you know, just say like Devon's left arm, which is not even trained. And maybe if it was right arm, maybe they will just stop him. But I'm just saying that, but Devon also said that with top roll, he cannot beat Jerry.
SPEAKER_01: He said that if he ends up like this with Jerry, he said that Jerry would win him. The only way to beat Jerry is that he needs to, you know, like the way that Hermes did it, yeah. Yes. Yeah. So that's an interesting match. That's an interesting match. I can see Tali flashing him four times as well. Yeah, that's the only way. If somehow he stays like this and Kamil is like this, then trust me, Kamil is not the one who's going to get tired. Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_01: Your brachioradialis will get tired eventually. Because when you overpronate, you don't even get support from the biceps so much. Your bicep gets affected this way. Once it is turned this way, this is all about brachioradialis and some joints. Do you remember his match against Alexander Getalo? Yes, of course. Kazakhstan. 10 minutes. Yes, I know. 10 minutes. It was a minute and a half foul and another 10 minutes.
SPEAKER_01: yeah yeah and did you remember the table like from the giant screen you ship it was like a lake lake like you know i don't remember this yeah they were just leaking like you know like or waiting like crazy yeah it was incredible but what i'm just gonna say that's not the same knowledge but communist pressure is not the pressure of alexander getalo alexander ghetto is more of
SPEAKER_01: but still he did well with his way. So, I don't know. So, you are saying what's the score prediction? I don't know. I can see 4-0 for Laletin, but I can see 4-0 for Kamil as well. I don't know. But any match that Kamil wins a round, later rounds will not be looking good for Laletin.
SPEAKER_01: Do you understand? Once he stops him. You understand? Once there is a small war. Yeah, there will be. Anyway, so last match. Morozov versus Ivan Matushenko. Matushenko is 115-116 kg. And Morozov will probably a little bit more than 130 kg. He will probably be
SPEAKER_01: um stronger than last time we saw him against kurdecha i don't know in my eyes matushenko is the favorite wow that is interesting i i this is the first time i think i i hear this is it because of his speed and power of his wrist and moving to just what i saw from morozov against kurdecha was not impressive for me at all
SPEAKER_03: He was not able to use his gestural. I don't know. It looked like he had no side pressure. It looked like he had only biceps and pronation and no side pressure. I don't know why. Maybe Kurdeco was so strong. No, no, no. It was just the way he pulled. No side pressure at all. And there was one interview.
SPEAKER_01: that I heard that he say with right I can pull anywhere. With left, just top row. And... Who said this left top row? Morozov? Morozov, yes. Yeah, but he won many matches with left arm in hook. With who? He beat Kudecha in hook. Yeah, but after Kudecha was tired. No, no, but he still went inside that right away in round one. The thing is that... He also hook.
SPEAKER_01: Corey West. But he didn't beat them when they were fresh in hook. No, I think the first match he did to Corey, I think, did he not do the risk? I think he tried to topple Tobias, he couldn't, and he beat Tobias in hook. Yes, maybe, with Tobias, yes. Yes, with Tobias, maybe.
SPEAKER_01: what i saw lately from him and that's why i believe so you are saying that matushenko is gonna be double champion you flash him four times he will beat him four times yeah this is what i think wow yeah if he stops the match he wins who
SPEAKER_01: If Morozov stops the match, Morozov wins. Does it depend, you know, if he stops him like this or stop him like this? Most likely, if he stops the match, he will win, this is what I think. It doesn't matter what position? I think so. That's interesting. That's interesting. Anyway, so it is 53 minutes. You want to quickly go?
SPEAKER_01: We can talk about 10 minutes more. Okay, so let's go to the July event as well. Okay. Dimitrina versus Ayane. What does Dimitrina think about this? Does she take her seriously? Of course, yes. The woman is not normal either, the Japanese girl.
SPEAKER_03: With the forearms and everything, you know? Ajani has the right style to beat Dimitrina. But I just think that Dimitrina is too strong right now. She's way stronger than when she stopped two years ago or three years ago when she was pregnant. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Right now she is wasted. She never looked that strong. Yes, right now at the Europeans it looks like it was warming up for her. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And in my eyes I am very biased here. I cannot be neutral. But I just think that Dimitra... Do you know Olga Terpilova? Yes, of course.
SPEAKER_03: She is versus Carolina Patterson. This is going to be a war, in my opinion. War? Yes. This is going to be, they both like to pull like this. They don't care so much about the wrist. They rely on back pressure. And it's going to be a minutes-long match, in my opinion. We'll see. And they both are warriors. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: While we went with woman, incredible match, Barbara versus Egle. Do you agree that Egle is one of the GOATs in female armwrestling? Of course, of course. For sure, right, for sure. The left, maybe, is the GOAT. The GOAT. Yeah, with left arm, yeah, she is the GOAT, probably. But the right arm is also one of them. One of the best, yes. Yes. I don't know what to expect.
SPEAKER_01: Barbara is huge, but the last match of Egle against Sarah Beckman, look. Yes, yes. Incredible. I never expected that dominance, you know. Yes, me too. Me too. I don't know. I don't know what to expect from this match. Okay. You know Adam Warzynski. You remember his match with Artur and Bojidar. Yes, yes. He is pulling Vladimir Mairov.
SPEAKER_01: Hulk War, I expect. Oh, I should say Alexander. I don't know this joke about Alexander. Because during the match, Travis always called him Alexander. The guy's name is Vladimir. But during the match, as a commentator, Travis says, Oh, Alexander, Alexander did this, Alexander that. Did he do that on purpose or he just messed up? No, no, no. He just like...
SPEAKER_01: He didn't know what he was saying, yeah. So, what do you think about this match? I said it's going to be a hook war. War, yeah, yeah. So, I don't see a dominance. But it will be, yeah. Me too. It's going to be incredible. Okay, how about this one?
SPEAKER_01: Bojidar vs. Daniel Prokopcik, left arm, world title. You know, we changed the categories now. 70, 77, 85, and it goes like this. Because I wanted to make 70, but I didn't want to make 70, 75, 85. So I made 70, 77, 85. So this is going to be 77 kilo left arm world title match. And you know, in the last World Combat Games, Bojidar beat Daniel Prokopcik. There's no video from that match.
SPEAKER_03: I really wanted to see that match, but there's no video from that one. Something happened with the streaming at that moment. I saw it. I saw the match. You did? Yeah. Whoa, I didn't. I don't remember where I saw it, but during that time, when the match was happening, I saw it. Somebody sent me video, probably. I need to go back, check. Because Bozidar said to me that there's no video from that match.
SPEAKER_01: I saw it. I saw it. Somebody send me. I don't know who sent me, but somebody sent me. Anyways, how do you see? So you didn't see the match? No. His classic way, you know, he went, you know. I believe the same thing will happen. Same thing will happen? Do you think if it is the best of seven match, Bojidar's endurance will be better than Daniel's? Yes, yes.
SPEAKER_01: So you are saying that Bozidar will be the new champion? Most likely. Most likely. There is a way that Daniel's endurance may be better. I'm not sure. Okay. So some other matches. Some other matches. One second.
SPEAKER_03: Very good one. Sasha versus Samusha. For sure, Sasha will be the better match. He has more horsepower. If he will be able to finish the match, I don't know. But for sure, he will be able to take the center and he will be on the winning side. I guarantee this. If the match stops,
SPEAKER_03: then it goes in the favor of Samusha. You think Samusha has better endurance? Yes. But when did you see Sasho losing a hook war? It's rare. It's rare, but Samusha's endurance is incredible. I think that if Sasho wants to win that one, he needs to do it
SPEAKER_03: I can see Sasha winning the first 2-3 rounds quickly. So you are expecting a war? Yes, yes, actually. I don't see Sasha winning the first rounds. I don't see this. But after 2-3 rounds, I don't know. How about Sasha's top reliability?
SPEAKER_03: is very good against hook pullers. Yes. The thing is that he's able to take the hand, but after that he's not able to do this. Do you realize that most of the times when somebody tapas Samusha, he beats them even easier? Yes, yes.
SPEAKER_01: And what did you think about Tom's, Rossi's performance at the last Europeans? Incredible, right? Iron. Iron. And what do you think about him versus Artem Taranenko, left arm? I think it's going to be a good match because I believe Tim's arm is stronger than
SPEAKER_01: Maybe he may go inside. Yes, yes, yes. Because hand for hand, totally way better in my opinion. But Artem may be able to put him. There is a very interesting match I would like to ask your opinion. Very interesting one. Artem Taino versus Betkil Oniyane. Were you surprised with Betkil's performance against Aktaev?
SPEAKER_01: Did you expect it to be that easy? I thought that Akhtar would start and then Bekir would stop. I didn't think a dominance from the right started. Me too, me too. Artyom is the favorite in my hat. But if the match stops somewhere in the middle,
SPEAKER_01: then it's going to be a tough one. Guys, you guys say that sound is bad. This is probably my sound, right? Not Krasimir's sound. There is something.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, she's coming from the oven. The food is cooking. I came to the kitchen. Sorry, guys. Yeah, it is finishing. Sorry. In my eyes, Kalyshenko is a huge favorite. Oh, you think? Travis said that he will be in very good shape. He said he is getting prepared for everyone.
SPEAKER_01: I don't think so. I don't think so. In my eyes lately, Kalnishenko is totally to the right. So you are saying that Kalnishenko is going to beat Travers? Yes, I think so. Let's see. This one, I only want percentage. Papachins versus Krasimir Kostadinov. I really don't know.
SPEAKER_03: how this will go, but I'm giving my 100% for the training. And I can say just one thing, that I want this match for 12 years already. Wow. And you think your shape will be better than 12 years ago?
SPEAKER_03: I don't know if my side pressure will be stronger, but my side pressure will be stronger. And my cupping, maybe. No cupping, okay. Evgeny Prudnik versus Irakli Zerakashvili, 105 kilos. Irakli. You think Irakli will win? I think that under 105 kilos,
SPEAKER_01: Hutchins may be able to beat Irakli and maybe me. How about Dadikyan just beat him and Ungarbe beat him? Yes, yes, and Dadikyan. Ungarbe also beat him, 3-0. But, sorry, sorry, guys. I mean from the hook pullers. Yeah, hook pullers. Me. Listen, Hutchins beat him, but he couldn't hook him. He beat him inside.
SPEAKER_01: know it is very very hard to hook him i i think two rounds russian babaya hook him oh no one round hook him one round i think he beat him in top row yes yes yeah i think rustam was so far the closest guy oh i remember the losses but but lately the he's improving i think that he is the only thing that we can say he's improving the matches he had in 95 kilo we didn't see any match at 105 kilo
SPEAKER_01: to prove that he is improving because the reason he went to 95 was his loss against Dariq Khan. He was a very dominant win. Yes, the thing is that he lost against the top rowers. He lost because Dariq Khan was top. He lost against Ongar Baev. He lost against the top rowers. Yes, that's true. Okay, so you are saying Iraq is going to win.
SPEAKER_03: Yes, because I don't think that Rudnick is going to be able to top-roll him. And if he tries to hook him, I think that Irakli will be able to take his risk. So you are saying that Rudnick cannot go outside and balance the match and win? He can, of course. But just in my eyes, for the moment, Irakli is the winner. I will not be surprised if Rudnick beats him 4-0 as well, but...
SPEAKER_03: just i think that as you already understood i'm terrible at predicting so i don't know why i'm here talking with you why i'm predicting guys you you already know that my juniors are better than me listen i will tell you something you can go outside on the street you can tell a guy to predict
SPEAKER_01: everybody who knows armwrestling and who don't know armwrestling they have 50% of chance to predict the match correctly so it is just we know that it doesn't mean that they know armwrestling better uh because anything you know all the possibilities yes and yeah but and the thing is that when you know even you know the possibility there are so many other factors
SPEAKER_01: Who had flu the last 10 days? Who slept good the last 10 days? Maybe injury, but he cannot say before the match that I have this much. If he says, opponent will be more motivated, you understand? Okay, he hurts. Oh, my wrist hurts. If he says, oh, my wrist hurts, what's going to happen? The guy will be even hitting harder there probably. Yeah. There are so many. Yeah. Trust me.
SPEAKER_01: Everyone that I know who knows arm-wrestling very well, they are mostly are the people who have doubts about many things. Because they are knowledgeable enough to know all the possibilities. But there are some guys they go, oh, I know this. Oh, I predicted this. So I know arm-wrestling better than this guy. This, this, this.
SPEAKER_03: I have friends who are telling me like this, oh, listen now, this match, this will happen. How do you know that this will happen? I know arm wrestling from 20 years. You're pulling to the first and you think that you know better? Yeah, and if somehow they are right, they will just say, see? Anyway, so let's left and just pass it. Artem Morozov versus Vitaly Laletin, right arm.
SPEAKER_03: interesting match very interesting match yes yes and um i i told you i don't know what to expect man i i i can see uh tom trying to top roll
SPEAKER_03: And top-holding Vitaly as well, losing the wrist. Maybe the arm would hold? Yes, maybe. I can see him trying to hook Vitaly as well. Do you think that this is possible to hook Vitaly? Or it would be just hanging like this and Vitaly is like this? It's possible, it's possible. His arm is very long and his wrist is short, so it's possible.
SPEAKER_01: But there is a possibility that he may lose his wrist as well while trying to hook him. I don't think that he's going to try to hook him in the first rounds. I'm sure that he will try to top roll him the first round. I think that he may still protect his pronator even if he loses his wrist.
SPEAKER_01: because his arm is strong, I think we will see very interesting things. I can see both guys winning. Me too, me too. But who do you think has more side pressure, Morozov? Yeah, with right side, I definitely think that Morozov has more side pressure. But with the starts, maybe Vitaly, but if the match stops, and then Morozov probably.
SPEAKER_01: Because I think his wrist will not allow him to have a hit with the start. He will fail, I think. I mean... Me too, me too. Morozov needs to post or to go deep in hook. If he goes somewhere in the middle, he will lose the wrist. I think, in my opinion, in all three,
SPEAKER_01: options, he will lose the list. But I'm talking about the very fresh match. You don't see him top rolling, Vitaly? I see him going, but I don't see him like this. I don't see him like this. I don't know. I don't see that. I think it's possible. I think it's possible.
SPEAKER_01: Anyway, so this was the last one. And one last thing before we go finish.
SPEAKER_01: August, Jerry Cadoret versus Alex Kurdeca. You and Ungar BF, you both beat Alex with. Do you think that Jerry has the same possibility or things change and now Kurdeca is different and he is not vulnerable that way anymore? I really don't know. Where would you bet? The way that Kurdeca beat Gokce was super impressive.
SPEAKER_01: And I really don't know how strong he is right now. Yeah, but don't you think it's a different challenge? The pressure direction, one is to his hand. Now it is going to be having the pressure to this way. In my eyes, Krudeche is a slight favorite. Slightly. But he cannot finish the match quickly. It's going to be a tough day for him. If the match stops,
SPEAKER_03: his elbow may get out from the back side. We will see. One other thing that is super, super, super important when there are two people like this, like Kudecha versus Iberi. It depends how tight the strap is. Very important factor.
SPEAKER_03: So tightness is better for Kurdeca? No, tightness for Jerry. Oh, okay. Because if it's loose, if the strap is too loose, Kurdeca will be able to climb and go to the side. I understand. Anyways, Krasimir, thank you very much for being my guest. And very soon, what's that, six weeks?
SPEAKER_01: a little bit more than six weeks maybe see you in istanbul and if you are having such birthday cake and if you have been waiting 12 years for this moment you better be ready my friend you better be ready i'm i'm trying i'm giving my best yeah you take care of yourself my friend thank you you guys
