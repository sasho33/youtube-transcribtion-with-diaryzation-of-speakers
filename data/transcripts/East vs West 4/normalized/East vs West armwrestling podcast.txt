SPEAKER_04: Hello guys. Hello.
SPEAKER_00: Sandris, hello, King. How are you guys doing? Today, Herman Stevens and hopefully Joshua and Paolo will join me hopefully very soon in probably less than 10 minutes. Today, like I will have
SPEAKER_00: normal chat but in the evening uh three hours later i will be guest of alex kurdeca um is not coming to east versus west he will be going somewhere else
SPEAKER_00: hello john hello my friends i think he said he's gonna go belgium or something he said
SPEAKER_00: Hello, Roman. How are you, my friend? Thank you, GB. It was yeah, it was nice interview yesterday. I enjoyed it. Hello, what's that? Sion, how do you pronounce it? Hello, Andreas. Hello, my friend. Boston. What's the story behind the Japanese sword? Oh,
SPEAKER_00: They invited me to Japan in 2004 as an honorary guest, and there they gave me the sword. Yeah, old school labs, yeah. They sent me yesterday. I mean, yesterday I received, and so .
SPEAKER_00: Why you didn't offer to Devon as guest? Who told you that I didn't offer him to be my guest? I invited him many times, you know. Evgeny two days ago, last time I offered him some super matches and he didn't even reply. So that for sure was the last time that I invited him. Hello, Victor.
SPEAKER_00: Hello Trevor. Hello. Hello to Canada. Will you release your personal rankings or do other weight classes other than superweight? I may do that. I have been very busy, my friend. I have been trying to do this events
SPEAKER_00: It's not that easy, as you see, I'm trying to promote mostly by myself. I have been asking, you know, Atlas to help me as well. Uh, yes, it is only 11 days. Larry Wills is not coming, but Adam Sewellers, uh, I think he is coming. Arsene Lelievre coming, Ermes Gasparini coming, Alex Kvileka coming. Um,
SPEAKER_00: Arif's left arm had been terribly injured, you know, from year before when he pulled Kody Merritt at WAF. And he was not doing well, but he said, okay, let me try. And then he pulled, round one, he got injured. Satellite, yeah, this is, we already, I already paid for this for satellite doing. Everything is paid.
SPEAKER_00: yeah hello hello hello how are you my friends i'm good how are you uh tired tired not that easy to organize such events oh yeah i don't know how you're doing it it's uh that's a huge respect for someone who can organize something like that it's uh i don't know how you're doing this hello hello ryan thank you for your support my friend thank you for your support uh
SPEAKER_00: Yes, sometimes I'm thinking, Paolo, should I be more elitist, like fully elitist? And if I had like just a $100,000 budget, should I pay only to a few athletes just for the sake of having more of arm wrestling views than trying to serve the generally community to give
SPEAKER_00: as many athletes as possible to also make them popular as they deserve or this this everything should be turning around a few elite guys all the time you know like this this circle and then five guys there and then the whole world is around them and no no no no chance to in other guys
SPEAKER_01: no i think you're doing this right and uh you found that golden middle where you're not doing this for anybody but you're doing this for a circle of elite athletes but not five how many athletes uh was uh
SPEAKER_00: you remember five atlas different atlas it's not five it's yeah it's a little bit should i do that way should i should i should i divide the budget to a few guys only instead of trying to help support many top athletes to have athletes like morozo tobias and many new ones you know that i see now that like
SPEAKER_00: zurab who knew zurab in the west side six months ago now everyone knows him right yeah six months ago they were like who the lsc now everyone knows who zurab is everyone knows who who's ravaz is so i just believe that these people also deserve they are our masters as well and they are good our masters and they need to be known they need to be given chance at that stage
SPEAKER_00: It's up to them if they use that opportunity good or not. I cannot support them. They are going to go and prove themselves. But I'm just thinking that we should give more options to the community. More options. Like there are this guy, this guy, this guy, this guy, this guy as well. That's why absolutely everybody loves you because you're doing this properly.
SPEAKER_00: i don't think everybody everybody loves it people people i don't know they they i i see those like um like haters i will i will tell you honestly of course i don't expect everyone to love or something but uh but i if i will be very happy if i can cover 70 75 percent of this event by per per view
SPEAKER_00: If I didn't look for sponsor for this event, I would be probably losing up to $20,000, $25,000 from this event. It's my own stupidity. But what I just tried to say that I'm not looking, you know, money, money, money, money, you understand? I'm not. I can give that money a few guys and probably would sell twice pay-per-view. You understand? Yeah. But then what am I?
SPEAKER_00: I mean, I'm not blaming anyone else. I'm saying as Engin Terzi, who gave 30 years of his life, should he walk on the path that he believes and he owes something to this community? Or should he just think of himself alone and only? Hello, hello, Herman. Herman, it's good to see you. Hey, Pablo. Hey, how are you, Herman? I'm doing good. I'm doing really good.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah. So the last event, I don't know this one, let's, let's see how it's going to go, but I, I am just, so how, how are you now? I'm on continued. Well, Jonathan, Jonathan is resting. Um, he's competing this Saturday. Um, so I have no other training partners. So I, I lifted weights twice Sunday, twice yesterday, once today.
SPEAKER_02: Um, I feel amazing, still a little bit sore as I, you know, get over some of the injuries, but, uh, very strong. Like even when I do pull-ups now, like things were working right before it was like, I knew I was, I mean, I can do, I've done pull-ups with 150 pounds. I've done one on pull-ups, but for the past year, whenever I do pull-ups, things just didn't want to move. Right. Um, and like I said, right now I feel pretty damn good. That's good. That's good.
SPEAKER_02: I think you and Paolo would be a good one in North America. We pulled in 2020. I won super heavyweights left hand. I won super heavyweights right hand. And I beat Wayne twice in the finals. And then I pulled 235 or something. And then Paolo beat me. But I think he's much better now. So I don't know if I'd have a chance.
SPEAKER_02: you always do have a chance brother normally i would just say that it would be hard but now when you say like you feel super strong then i am like you know why not why not because you have a dangerous guy as well you know yeah i yeah i feel really good what are you waiting on i'm probably 235 right now and like it's just going down so it's going down and i'm getting stronger so i'm doing really good
SPEAKER_00: same weight same weight yeah yeah but we look a little bit different yes yeah maybe maybe maybe joshua will also uh join us he is working at the moment but he may join us yeah let's see let's see how it will be only 11 days and
SPEAKER_00: very busy days are waiting for me, very busy days. It's not, I really need to lower the numbers. It's because 29 athletes, very, very hard, you know, because I'm the one that from our side is dealing directly, only me. So I need to organize everyone from the airport to there. And then, you know, many things, many things, it will be very hard, but let's see, you know, how it will be.
SPEAKER_00: Delegate a little bit. Come on. What's that? Oh, we talked about this. Engin can't delegate. Engin, you have to delegate. You have to have a few boss boys who can run some small errands for you and pick up people. They don't have any connection with them. They don't have any connection. I don't think that I know anybody that have that ability to, you know, do this for me, you know. Of course, I have friends. They are helping me. But mostly about the stage and, you know,
SPEAKER_00: those kinds of things, but, um, let's see. Very stressful to do it yourself. Very stressful. Yeah. Yeah. That that that's, that's the interesting things are happening. I just want jumpers things, uh, program with chance show chance show said that he, he already talked with Genadi and he will be at his corner against Jerry. Okay.
SPEAKER_01: I can't believe that he went that far, you know? Sure. Yeah. I mean, do you think he would do that? He may. He may. I would do it. I'm not a fan. I'm not a Jerry fan. There was some good sparks between them lately, so yeah, he may do it.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I have a question for you, Paolo. If an American guy would be pulling, just say, Prudnik or Oleg Zog, would you be at the corner of an American guy? Easy. Easy, yeah? Same, I can be in Prudnik's corner when he's pulling an American guy. It doesn't matter. Really? Yeah, for me, absolutely not.
SPEAKER_01: yeah as i said i uh if i will ever arm wrestler arm wrestle on uh you know international arena again i will pull for united states but uh it doesn't mean that i cannot be a friend with uh prudnik or anybody else or you know absolutely or zambalot so if whatever or whatever whoever it doesn't matter or yours i understand yeah
SPEAKER_01: That is interesting. I think it's just from nation to nation. It's changing. I don't think you could do that. Like, for example, a Georgian guy would do this against another Georgian. That's my opinion. Yeah, you see, I'm a little bit different because I immigrated and my mentality is very international. And how to say this politically correct?
SPEAKER_02: citizen of the world let's put it this way i'm a citizen of the united states but i don't mind at all to do you know anybody's corner anybody's corner yeah and i was uh i was in crossy's corner when he pulled corey west uh because he needed someone there he was a little he asked like if you if you ask i'll probably be in you know in the corner you know um
SPEAKER_02: But I would say this though, like compared to Georgians, Americans, I mean, there's some camaraderie. Like, you know, I feel like I'm part of the team when it's me and Todd Hutchings and some of these people, but we don't have a team. You know what I mean? Like we don't train together. You know, we're all five hours away. Like that doesn't exist, right? We talked about it last time. Those Georgians, they all like a lot of them live in the capital.
SPEAKER_00: national team or things you don't believe in those we don't have a real national team yeah everyone's so spread out like we're we all compete against each other you know that's how the national team is just national team normally even in other countries they came out from the national championship they compete but they come from different regions they get qualified from this club that club that city this city this state
SPEAKER_02: And then they come together and represent one nation, you know. That's how it is. Correct me if I'm wrong. I think some of these countries, you actually have a lot of your better pullers in the same city and they train together, right? In the United States, you might have Herman Stevens in Louisiana. You got Rob Vigit 2,000 miles away. You got Tom Nelson 2,000 miles away. You got Todd Hutchings 1,500 miles away. Everybody is like this.
SPEAKER_00: And we may come together to compete against each other, but we don't ever really train together. Whereas some of those places, you still have really good pullers that work together. But it applies to other countries too, like school boys. Do you know where he is from? He's from the North Korea, from the other side where the Japanese, you know, they're there. But when they come compete, they put the Russian uniform and then they compete. They're not, they are not always,
SPEAKER_00: um do you think that there is no team splits in this kind of things like for example like mba you know they have different teams but they they send a team to the olympics right from that in this team that team but they of course it's a team sport it's different but still you know because of that
SPEAKER_01: Engin, it's exactly because of you said, because it's NBA. We just talked about Tom Nelson. We talked about Kerman. We talked about Todd Hutchings. No one of those athletes will pull the same national tournament because there is two or three national tournaments for two or three organizations. And Todd Hutchings will never pull a national tournament.
SPEAKER_00: doesn't but these guys in the past they they pull same events all the time you know exactly i'm sure that he has competed same events with jumbo zinc yes who didn't you have like competing the same event which is exactly what i'm saying you used to have a valve
SPEAKER_01: or USAF in this position until probably 2006. It was not solo, but it was a triple A, but it was a smaller organization. But USAF was the organization where you pull your national title and everybody was going to Worlds and to Arnold Classic and stuff like that from there.
SPEAKER_00: now it's a kind of uh spread out too thin so that's why there is no uh no conglomeration of the athletes pulling the same organization i think i think in the past you know that the flag alone was enough to to make uh probably you know yeah it didn't matter you know who is from where or this and that you know but i think maybe maybe time is changing here yeah hello my friend josh
SPEAKER_00: Hello, sorry I was late. How is your arm? Still hurt or getting better? Yeah, still hurt. It's getting better though, little by little. Today I did some heavy work with it and it did not hurt as much as last week, so I feel like that's a good sign. I understand. I was at the beginning of the program, I was talking with Paolo, then Herman joined us. I want to ask Herman and John, like,
SPEAKER_00: If just this is only example, if you had $100,000 as prize money award, should this be divided 45, 45, 55? Or should it be divided like 15, 15, 10, 10, 7, 7, 5, 5, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1 to do elite athletes
SPEAKER_00: for their level, of course, the numbers to change, or should we just have arm wrestling to circle around a few very elite selected people, like as an organizer, I'm asking. I'm not criticizing anyone who is thinking differently, but as Engin Terzide, who has pulled 30 years all over the world and come to this point and had the same breath, same sweat,
SPEAKER_00: same injuries and everything, same hopes, same disappointments of all these athletes. What should I do? I can do both ways. I can just focus a few athletes, just give all the investment, all investment right in one or two points instead of giving opportunity to other possible future stars. What should I do?
SPEAKER_00: Are you spreading this money around amongst super matches or as far as like tournaments and weight classes and placings? What are we talking about? I am talking about super matches because I need to be realistic that these events needs to be sold with like pay per view to be financed. Some people think that this event is totally financed by pay per view.
SPEAKER_00: like i will say that i'm i will be more than happy if i can cover 75 of this event by pay-per-view the other 25 is you see i'm like a like a street you know guy you know selling t-shirts trying to sell table people things and you know you are just trying to make money no i'm just trying to cover the event you know
SPEAKER_00: So that I can organize more, so that I can organize more. Some people don't understand that. I will tell you honestly, did I plan to do something like this, Herman? David it start like that? No, not at all. You know it, Bex. Yeah, because you, I, John, Ryan, Derek, we were in the same group. You know how it started. We just like it is.
SPEAKER_00: Like bad times, COVID, everyone is at home, let's do something, you know? And then we started something. It came to this point. So what I am just saying that I'm 47 years old. This has never been any part of my dream or plan or anything. It just came to this point. So what I just tried to say, if I don't organize anymore, don't get me wrong, I don't lose anything. My life is not dependent on it, you understand? But in my honest opinion, the community,
SPEAKER_03: would miss it. This is my honest opinion. I agree with you. I think you filled a hole that was a big hole. For two years, nothing was going on and you stepped in. And I think now our community is used to it. And if it was gone, it would be a big loss for everybody. So I'm glad you're continuing to do it. But to answer your initial question, I think if you look at
SPEAKER_03: you know the ufc which is probably the biggest organization doing combat related stuff similar to this they put all of their money into the top couple of matches and everybody else gets peanuts but the result of that is most of their fighters are not happy so i think maybe it would be good for a couple guys if you had that kind of prize money for the top few matches but i think for the community it's better to if you had a hundred thousand dollars to spread it out over as many matches as you can
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I think there are other organizations that have the big money covered, right? So if Devin or LaVon or whoever wants to make $50,000, I think you should let King of the Table do that, right? And they are doing a great job. Yeah, so I think you should let them do that.
SPEAKER_02: and i think spreading the money out would fit what you've been doing so far which is giving kind of more people the spotlight right in that case you'd be giving more people a piece of the money uh but there is a limit right there's probably um you know a certain tier of match that you might have on your car where they shouldn't get any money they're either too new not good enough whatever but the money has to be meaningful so i wouldn't spread it out so thin
SPEAKER_02: that the money doesn't matter, right? So I don't know, is it minimum 2,000? Is it minimum 3,000? But the money has to matter. But that's kind of how I would look at it. I'd leave the big money stuff to King of the Table or WAL, and I would try to help as many people as possible, especially considering that I think for a lot of these non-American guys, that money goes really far.
SPEAKER_02: Right sounds like $2,000 to I don't know Bulgarians worth a lot more than $2,000 to an American. So you can really have a huge impact when you spread it out like that. Whereas spreading it out in the United States for WAL probably doesn't really help a whole lot. I understand. Yeah, but what I'm just saying, I always saw it, I saw, you know how I saw?
SPEAKER_00: I saw East versus West, like you know that the pure elite professionalism that you said that let them do. And there is WAF, pure amateur. When I say amateur, people don't get me wrong. When we say this amateur, this amateur has the 90% of the best athletes in the world
SPEAKER_00: would kick their ass. Every elite athlete that you see almost, like Laletin, Prudnik, Rustam Babaev, Barbosa, Lewand, all these guys came from WAF. So when I say amateur, I don't mean like they don't know how to arm wrestle. They are the best ones. But no money in movement. That is how it is. So there is WAF amateur, and there is the very elite one.
SPEAKER_00: but if you realize that there is not much in between, a bridge between them. So this is how I try to do. So if I organize that way, the way that I am doing it, I can help people who has potential to be one of those very, very elite athletes if they have the potential. So then my event will be a good pool for those very elite ones
SPEAKER_00: to choose from, you understand? So that is good for them too. There needs to be. You can pick your athletes all the time from the training videos that you see the guy post dumbbell. Okay, you come, you need to see them. So I am offering 16 super matches. Someone you like it, you see the light, just invite them to your very, very, very, very elite level that where you are just dividing the, you know,
SPEAKER_00: the cake to a few portions. You know what I mean? Yeah. But it can forever go in between four or five selected ones. Absolutely. There needs to be something from down there to grow to keep the popularity. You know, we can't always go with the guys from 47 to 60 years old. You understand? The new ones need to come. So that is what I try to do, you know.
SPEAKER_02: You did invite Ryan, and all he's done is lift weights for two years or 10 years. Ryan? Bowen. I saw something that Ryan in USA have beaten some good guys too, Herman. Yeah, it's always like situational, Ingen. Like they either pulled a class already or they had a super match before, something like that. Now, he beat Chance fresh.
SPEAKER_03: You know, so I don't think there's any, uh, excuse there, but it was always situation. There's definitely one excuse for that match too. You must've, uh, you must've missed out those, the hustle strap match. Remember with the strap. Yeah. So there's something for everything.
SPEAKER_03: But I mean, you know, Ryan is definitely you have to acknowledge him as a very powerful force on social media, if nothing else, and that has value in and of itself. Correct. Ooh, Herman, do you read the comment section? I see what Ryan said. Yeah. David you read that? Yeah. Yeah. So you better, you better be careful. I'd be, I'd be confident too, if I've been training for six years straight with no injuries, cause I don't pull.
SPEAKER_02: Should I understand that you are not confident against Ryan? Oh, probably not. I haven't trained seriously in years. It's just been off and on. Only 10 minutes ago when John wasn't here, but Paolo was here, you said you're feeling super strong. Yeah, but Ingen, I don't have the time. That's why I wouldn't take a match with a Rockley, Gamtanadze or whatever. You remember you asked if I wanted to pull him?
SPEAKER_03: I don't have the time. Yeah. I don't have the time under my belt training. Okay, okay, Ryan. Herman talked about you and now he backed up, so sorry about it. I like the other match that we have with Ryan. Ryan and Nengen. What did you say? What did you say? I said I like the Ryan versus Nengen match that we had originally set up. I would still like to see that maybe in November if you decide to come back. Um,
SPEAKER_00: I will tell you something, you know, I like Ryan. He's, I think, you know, good for the community, but no disrespect to him. Like after playing 30 years and like, don't get me, Ryan. I know you want to just like, you will not like what I say, but I really need to, I don't care if I lose or win, I need to pull someone that
SPEAKER_00: is like a big target for me i'm not saying the ryan is not big target or something but he needs to be someone that like after 20 years with all this pain you know like i'm i need to motivate myself i'm not going to kill myself to get ready to beat ryan i'm not saying i can beat him but i'm not going to get like ready for that match if you just tell me hajim razolev oh yeah bojidar simeno yeah
SPEAKER_00: I would pull Ryan also, but Ryan also needs to prove himself in the Eastern Europe where around his weight category, all the best guys are. And then I would just say, okay, let's go, Ryan. That all makes sense. That's very logical argument. It's a very logical argument, but my argument was not coming from a place of logic. It was coming from, I think it would be fun to watch.
SPEAKER_01: I think maybe you and Genadi can have a match after Genadi and Jerry pull in a couple of weeks. That would be fun too. And Paolo, what are your opinions about all this? Everything. I don't know personally, Ryan, but I think anybody who is doing popularization of armwrestling in any methods is good. So...
SPEAKER_01: if you're inviting him as an athlete i'm not sure i don't know i i really doesn't follow his arm wrestling uh uh performance as an arm wrestler but uh the videos i'm watching i think their popularization good for popularization i mean even if it's a hate or fun or whatever is that
SPEAKER_01: uh it's popularized that's it same as uh devon uh all the hype around their uh levan match you saw how it's been swinging between uh levan will win then it swings to devon will win why why because devon did his balloon around this and it's bring lots of attention to our sport and i believe that only because of that our community grow by 20 percent
SPEAKER_00: We also need those kind of matches as well? Yes, absolutely.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I understand. It's not necessary that you have to spend your take a second mortgage for them. You can invite those athletes and make a deal. Maybe you cover their, I don't know, flight or hotel or whatever you're doing. It doesn't matter. But yes, absolutely. You need those measures. If those guys have something to prove and you believe that it's not going to hurt your event, absolutely yes.
SPEAKER_00: Cobra is in the chat. I said Cobra. For example, Cobra is not even active, right? He's not even training. He's not even pulling, nothing. The other day, he called me for some other reason. And then I offered him a super match in November because he's a legend. So legend status. I also write to Dave Patton. He was very happy that I talked about him.
SPEAKER_00: because he has been one of the greatest of all times. And he inspired us. And I said, if you come as a competitor, I know you are over 60, someone that is in your condition, that not training, but in the past was great, you know, we can do. If not, then come as our honor guests. You know, we will host you. You know, they're petting, you know, just, I mean, come on, you know. So, like,
SPEAKER_00: Haydar Gildil from Turkey, he's also three times WAP champion in seniors, will pull Cobra Rose in November. They had the WAP final in 2000. Cobra was first in 165, Haydar was second. So now Haydar is not training. He's in 154 now. I saw Cobra is not training. They have four months to train and they will meet there. For me, it's a very important match. For some people, no, I mean, maybe this and that. For me, I mean, we need it.
SPEAKER_01: what's the start of the match legend started that's what that's it you know hey not too long ago in michigan state i saw him pulling so he's uh yeah he's he still can do it absolutely as a legend yeah i would love to see that match yeah there is a super chat um how do i pronounce your name
SPEAKER_00: jcg thank you for your super chat the community grew and found youtube anyone who has john on their card has a hit yeah i mean john i mean you don't invite john uh because of the the the pay-per-view you i invited john my friend many years ago against krasimir i why there was no pay-per-view
SPEAKER_00: There was no ticket to enter the event. I found a sponsor. I said, Arsene versus John. I said, Krasimir versus John. So my view to John is nothing to do with pay-per-view or sending. The money does not shape my view. I just look at, I try to judge, of course, that I would want it to sell pay-per-view so that I cover the event so I can serve our investing world even more.
SPEAKER_00: But but again, you know that that if you are thinking that you know because of the john the paper, of course, it helps it helps a lot, but that that that is not the case my friend yeah. yeah I think you are going back and forth with Ryan Herman what's going on. No, no, we I mean we really didn't go back and forth there's just some other comments is the one guy said i'm anti American, which I think is interesting but uh.
SPEAKER_03: Well, you get that anytime that you make any kind of comment that's viewed as disparaging towards American pullers. But I mean, reality isn't everybody's favorite subject, Herman. But for those of us who have pulled overseas and we've seen the difference in the background culture, we mentioned this last week. If you look at where arm wrestling is for the average person in the United States versus, for example, Bulgaria that you mentioned earlier, there's no comparison.
SPEAKER_03: It's similar to American football here. If you go over to wherever, Moldova, and you look for an American football team, they're going to be terrible.
SPEAKER_03: because nobody gives a crap about it over there. But in the United States, where there are not nearly the same number of people that are able to earn money for arm wrestling here than there are, say, for example, in Kazakhstan, of course, you're not going to have any comparison in the average level of skill. That's not an insult. That's just a reality. It doesn't mean that, like we said last week, some of us can still go over there and win. But per capita, person to person, their level is higher.
SPEAKER_00: yeah after after you know i i will tell you guys something uh that will probably fire rob visions if he hears this okay should i say or not yeah let's do it okay because i asked zurab should i share this
SPEAKER_00: And he said, go ahead. You know, he said he wants this to be known. So what happened is that I am planning to set, if everything goes well, I'm planning to set East versus West five in November 19. And there is one event in Canada that bringing, uh, I think Jeff Frank. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: yeah i think yeah he's bringing a few georgians there for super matches and that event is only one week after east versus west three uh five only one week so i didn't say anything to drop because it is his business because he is pulling here first how how he goes to canada after after pulling rob visions is his problem you understand it's not if he was pulling someone one week before my event then i would say something you know
SPEAKER_00: And he wrote to me, he said, Engin, on 26th, they are inviting me to Canada to pull, you know, this and that. And I said, I hope you will be, you know, fine, you know, recovered, you know, in a week. And he said that, you know, I mean, on November 19th, it will be very easy day for him. So he's not worried about it.
SPEAKER_02: Now, can we expect Rob to make a video about it? Maybe. He's probably going to just call me and say that I threw him under the bus or something. And I said nothing. Don't answer the phone. Yeah. This JCJC guy, JCG guy just sent you $5 Super Chat to call us un-American. Me and John anti-American.
SPEAKER_00: So you're welcome. I just made you $5. And you mentioned firing up Rob. I think we should start every show with a list of names and just fire everybody up. But this is a true story. This just happened, you know, naturally, you know. I said, like, you sure that you're going to recover in one week? He said, you know, don't worry. It will be very easy, you know. So now I can expect Rob to make a video with
SPEAKER_02: about 3000 F word. Probably, there is a there is a super chat. You want to read it, Herman? I think it is. Yeah, he said, JCG spent $5 to say, Look, you anti Americans can blow smoke to England. But American athletes still support America with pride.
SPEAKER_03: Thank you, JCG. $5 will go towards the next East versus West, and hopefully keep Engin out of debt. Hey, whatever works. Looks like no answer. Oh, John already answered. But I think people who haven't seen Rob Vigent when he's in top form, which is most of Europe,
SPEAKER_00: Maybe they're underestimating him. Zurab could be in that group too. We shall see. Yeah, people are comparing. Again, no disrespect to Zurab. Zurab and Samushia, if they pull, my money would be on Zurab because they will go arm to arm. But I think that Samushia's wrist handling against Topolov
SPEAKER_00: is better than Zurab's. So I kind of think that Rob has more chance to top roll Zurab than he has chance against Samushia. So that is why I'm thinking that it may not go as easy as Zurab is thinking. I'm not saying that, you know, it cannot be, but it's not my opinion. If I would think that way, I wouldn't say that much.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, and I think I said last week, I think Rob is stronger than Ron Bath and maybe more well-rounded, I think. So I think he'll give Zurab some problems. But on Zurab taking a match a week after that, I think it goes back to the money thing. I don't know how much money Zurab is making on either match, but I think the money makes a difference to him. So he has to take.
SPEAKER_02: a match the week after. But if you told me, hey, Herman, go have a death war with Rob Goodman. And then next week, I want you to pull, you know, Pablo, and I'm gonna pay you $1,000. I'm not gonna do it. You know what I mean? It's not worth $1,000. What's that? How about if it was $10,000?
SPEAKER_01: I don't know. I'm sure there's some number, but that number is much lower for, let's say, a Georgian than it is for an American. Engin, I have a question for you about this. How many times did you personally pull WAF Worlds in Masters and Senior Division at the same event?
SPEAKER_01: was there when you did it in 2018 i think and you won both i think three i think okay how much money did you get to do that and how many days between your masters and senior was i i don't understand you you are curious about the money i made or you're curious about the how many days well what's your it sounds like
SPEAKER_00: Two different questions. First, how many days apart was there between those two divisions? In Malaysia, I won both Masters and Seniors. It was only two days later. Okay. And then in Antalya, I still won. There was four days, I think. No, it was again two days. Okay.
SPEAKER_00: how much money did you get to do that you know i remember in turkish lira but i don't remember how much the dollar rate was at that time because it changed a lot so i i don't i don't remember exactly but i don't remember exactly maybe maybe okay that's that's fine but maybe ten thousand dollars no maybe not i don't know
SPEAKER_00: Maybe $5,000. But you did that with a two-day separation. Yeah. What's the question? I don't understand. The point is that Zurab doing that with a seven-day separation for X amount of money. Yeah, but just remember, you're talking about masters. Sorry.
SPEAKER_00: in the senior you know whenever whenever i go to masters for my category i say the masters is just like you know like like like this but you're talking about rob visions i don't think that for zurab it is something like that no no no i i know you're talking about provision that has wins against even not the full event but
SPEAKER_01: Matt Hutchings, John Burzing, Barbosa, you know. I understand the difference. I'm just saying that many people, including myself, I'm not saying this is right, but I've been there and I did it before. And to say that it was successful, no, it's not really. I have a voice.
SPEAKER_01: and losses on a second event of the next week and it's was it hard yes it was hard but uh on a regular basis i'm pulling the tournaments with uh sometimes with multiple places like every two weeks every three weeks sometimes so i it's it's a little bit depends how uh how your training and preparation for exact event are going let's say uh there is a people like
SPEAKER_01: i don't know let's put the top athletes so everybody understand what my point is let's say levan he will pull probably three times a year or dennis used to do that three times a year very serious super matches and there is a people like john berzang or todd hutchins who is a top atlas too and they can pull every three weeks or once a month at the age of 57 8 years
SPEAKER_00: you know it's it's very much depends on your training and preparation styles and it depends on how hard the match is my friend and that's the best how much how much damage you have in that mess absolutely you remember rambet pulls you up yes i think i think five weeks later he pulled pauline i'm not taking anything away from pauline he just won but i can see that
SPEAKER_00: run was not 100 even five weeks later i'm not saying that paul couldn't win even if he was 100 but what i'm just saying that there wasn't like so much resistance when he hook him he just he was just you know um five weeks yeah you understand um when when john will cross him here when i organized that event a week before he competed he competed senna kent only a week before yeah and it was
SPEAKER_00: nine years ago. And he and Stoyan Golemanov, you know Stoyan Golemanov? Yes. Yeah. He and Stoyan Golemanov had like 10, 15 seconds, if I remember, you know, just, and then John controlled it, beat him. A week later, John was not ready. He was asking me painkillers, you know, anti-inflammatory, you know, when he came here. So he was not ready. So it totally depends, you know, how hard to open this, you know, what level.
SPEAKER_00: But it is up to Zurab, of course, you know. I mean, I'm not saying that he shouldn't take the match, but I'm just trying to stir the pot because I know that Rob gets pissed off about these kind of things, yeah. And that's the dangerous part about Rob is, you know, people give him a hard time sometimes because they say that...
SPEAKER_03: you know, he can get into his own head sometimes. That's probably true. But I mean, really, that's true of everybody. But the thing that is also true of Rob is that when he feels like he's getting a lot of negative attention about something or people are kind of downplaying his ability or telling him that he has no chance, that's usually what fires him up and makes him more dangerous. Yeah. To be honest, that's when he's triggered that way. That's when he's going to be in his best condition. So I think. Yes, that's my intention.
SPEAKER_00: You know, I respect Rob, but I want it to become a little bit, little bit, tiny, a little bit personal, you know, but not personal, personal, but he doesn't take you seriously. Hey Rob, just go train and prove the guy who you are. That is my intention. Somebody wrote that Zurab is about 10, 15 kg heavier than who? Are they talking about Sasho or they are talking about Rob? If Rob, I don't think so.
SPEAKER_00: I don't think that in any of these events, Zurab was more than 100 kilo in those two events I'm talking about. And I think Zurab is about 100 kilo right now, 220. Yeah. Yep.
SPEAKER_03: Well, it's going to be interesting anyway. It's just like, well, RBJ is one of those trigger people. Whenever his name gets brought up, people have strong feelings about it one way or the other. And that's part of what makes it fun to talk about him because everybody is 100% sure they're right. Oh, he's washed up. All he cares about is making donuts up in Maine.
SPEAKER_03: And you have the other people who are like, he's an absolute monster. He's going to surprise you. I've trained with him a lot because we live in the same state. And, you know, I've seen multiple versions of Rob. And when Rob is on fire, he's an absolute wall. And he'll give anybody a hard time. And it's just a question of, does he have the time to train that way? And is he going to be motivated enough to do it? And if he does, I think Rob is underestimating him.
SPEAKER_03: But I mean, it could go the other way. I just hope I'm texting Rob constantly. It's like I do for Jerry to try. We all are. It's not just me. It's the whole Massachusetts group, because obviously we want these guys to do well internationally. And it's a great opportunity for both of them. Hey, John, how far are you from Rob? And when was the last time you pulled with him?
SPEAKER_03: So the tricky part is it's summertime, right? So you may, I think you know that he has a business that he does at a camp way up north that he's there for the entire summer, literally selling mini donuts. They make a huge amount of money and they basically pay their expenses for the entire year. So this period of time, nobody sees him unless you go up to camp.
SPEAKER_03: So I haven't trained with him since this match was announced. We had a huge practice up here at Granite Arms last week. I hope that he might be able to make it down, but I know Saturday and Sunday are his two busiest days, so he was not there. So I actually have no idea what shape he's in. But I do know that he's texting a lot of people asking when can we meet up to train, which is something he only does when he's serious. So I think that's a positive sign. When was the last time you pulled him? The last time I pulled Rob was probably right now.
SPEAKER_03: It would have been Christmas. Gotcha. Okay. How was he then? He was a wolf. He was a monster. Like at the end of the, it was another huge practice. And the only person that was giving him a hard time, this was probably a couple hours in. I don't know if you know Nick Stone or not. He's an up and coming Connecticut guy. He's a 300 plus pound power lifter.
SPEAKER_03: very, very, very strong person. But, you know, Rob toys with everybody else. I mean, there's a lot of world champions, both senior class and masters and everything up there in that area. Rob toys with everybody. I mean, if Jerry Catarat shows up, that's going to be the only person that gives him a hard time. Yeah. Lately, lately, I see Jerry is...
SPEAKER_00: very very i don't know how to say confident you know that i have never seen jerry this motivated ever yeah yeah i can see that i can see that and he he says that you know he's gonna allow generally to touch it you know touch his shield you know yeah last night i had uh i said night because of our time here uh i had uh leon his guest
SPEAKER_00: and he thinks that Jerry has no chance against Genadi. But let's see, let's see. I see a wall there. Let's see how it will be.
SPEAKER_03: I think I mentioned this, I think, last week. I mean, the main thing for me that I worry about, to be honest with you, is the difference between the WAL pads, both in size and like squishiness versus the ones we use on the international scene. Because the larger, squishier pads are much more forgiving for elbow falls. And that worries me.
SPEAKER_03: So hopefully he's going to be on point with that. I know we were working with very stiff pads a couple last week, whenever it was, and that Jerry has been only training on, on WAF like style tables. So hopefully it's going to be worked out, but it doesn't make anybody who pulled successfully in WAL goes back to European circuit. Always makes me worried. Adnan says that please suggest arm masters to, you know, take the,
SPEAKER_00: I think t-shirts off and arm muscles that way. And my friend, where do you want me to put the sponsor logos? It will be, yeah. Also, I mean, I think not really, maybe tank top, but not everyone prefers it. I don't know about the shirts off thing. I mean, if I pull Pablo, I can wear a shirt. I can put all, you put all the sponsors on my shirt. Pablo can take his shirt off. Maybe that's how we'll do it.
SPEAKER_00: David you ever see me pulling Sherco? I don't know, but I'm sure you're doing a lot better than me. I'm shy. Come on. That's funny. It will be, it will be, it will be fun. You know, I can wait. I can wait. But, um, I, I, I saw, I saw,
SPEAKER_00: Ryan made a poll about the pay-per-view or something, and it kind of made me think about it. That is why I started the subject about if I should invest only very, very popular, a few guys, just say five guys, and then just circle around.
SPEAKER_00: And then the whole community should be only doing this, you know, serving this or somebody like me should continue trying to serve wider base about I'm talking about the Atlas. So let's see. Let's see. Let's see how it will be.
SPEAKER_01: will get boring soon if you will have only five plates uh treated and pulling uh it's it's gonna get boring on a second or third event it's not gonna bring uh that much interest you are arm wrestling fan there are a lot of arm wrestler fans that you know whenever i saw that a match results in the way that they didn't like
SPEAKER_00: they are like, oh, we lost our interest in arm wrestling. You lost our, you never had interest in arm wrestling. You had interest in an arm wrestler. When he loses, you also lost. You were not really an arm wrestling fan. Yeah. But you say that if he blows around five guys, that it would get boring because you are an arm wrestling fan. But for them, you know, you know. Yeah, I understand. Yeah, three months he goes like that, and then, then,
SPEAKER_00: you know what i mean yeah the drama and then you sell the drama you know that instead of the arm i think so i don't know that that's why i try to think you know if i should i should switch to that drama world or i should you know this depends on your goals and it depends on your goals if your goal my goal my goal my goal is to give chance as many uh possible athletes
SPEAKER_00: that have potential so that we can find out by giving them chance so they wouldn't lose the motivation. Somehow we can see the new Devons, new Levons, new Jones. We can see more, more, more, because there are a lot of people. So if you give chance, they can have motivation. Otherwise, after the point, they may lose the motivation and leave the sport. If everything goes around a few guys. That's true.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, so my goal is to show that there are a lot of people on this earth that have potential. And so I think arm wrestling will be richer so that we will not have to do illusion to the community just to keep them attracted all the time. Then we can actually give them something. For many years, I was discussing like guys here, wild guys here.
SPEAKER_00: our guys are strong. No, our guys are strong. We kick your ass, we kick your ass. It just continues like that, just drama. 99% of the imaginary polls that would never happen in such conditions. So why do I need that? Just bring them together, make arm wrestling united, let them pull. Who cares who wins? Let the better one win. And then we say, bravo, you know.
SPEAKER_00: We don't want to have to write a scenario. If this guy wins, it's better for our mercy. Why not? Just give everyone chance. Maybe we will have new heroes. Why it needs to be like how to call cartel. You know what cartel? Yeah. Why it has to be that way. You know what I mean? Just, I just like, it will either change or people like me will say, okay, I'm away for retirement. This is what it is, you know?
SPEAKER_00: So I can say that this is our chance as well. But I see that people are more interested in different things. I understand that maybe that needed to, but come on, that can't be the only thing. Why don't you change the whole
SPEAKER_01: and have two events where you have uh three super matches with the super top athletes or whatever five five of those stops and then another uh two times a year and then two more times a year you have those east versus west like you have it maybe that's the answer why here you have to choose between if you can do both good good good good good good good advice i would do that
SPEAKER_00: if someone else wasn't doing that. That is also needed. That is why we need King of the Table. We need it. King of the Table is needed 100%, but I'm just saying that it can't be the only option. It has its place, but if there is something like that happening, there is also something like East versus West needs to happen as well. So there is someone, thanks to Larry, thanks to Don,
SPEAKER_00: It is thanks to Adam that doing this. Yeah, but also there needs to be something. That's why I said there is amateur WAF and there is only elite event and there needs to be something in between. Atlas will come from WAF also will have the opportunity to show themselves if they are good enough. We can't make anyone successful or popular or something, you know.
SPEAKER_00: needs to show himself we give opportunity he's good enough then we see him very elite level as well you know what i mean so this is when you say that what is your goal my goal is this this is something that is missing we can't always make a few guys we can't depend on it we need some people bottom to come more more the strong one survives that that's the thing but give them opportunity to prove themselves if they are good enough or not
SPEAKER_00: yeah absolutely that's what i thought you you're you're up to and yeah absolutely you answered your question and uh that's why that's why we love you yes that that is what i try to do but again i can't make this successful only by myself absolutely if the community says and we need this they need to support me i i read the comments it says ah
SPEAKER_00: why would I support it? Three days later, it will be on internet anyways, or someone piracy, by the way, we're going to catch them because after the channel is closing, they're writing me privately. I beg you, please, you know, you know, take the copyright strike away. My channel is going to close. I invested a lot. Yeah. My friend, you invested a lot, but I also invested $110,000. You were not, you were not worried about me. Of course I helped them.
SPEAKER_00: So they don't do it anymore. But I did, I'm just warning that that was before first event, second event. And now, nothing, you know, just if you're still, then your channel closes that that's all you know. Otherwise, how am I going to cover that? I'm not a millionaire. I'm not, I'm not a millionaire. Oh, you need to you need to another guy says, you know, I will work somewhere, you know, okay, you work somewhere and who is going to cover the seven, just just say that
SPEAKER_00: This is the last time we will not see East versus West anymore. I mean, what am I going to lose? It is not giving me my water. It's not giving me my food, nothing. I'm retired as a world champion athlete. My government is paying me till I die. After I die, it will go to my son till he dies. I don't have any problem about surviving. I'm just trying to help. But if I don't organize this, I'm just looking at putting on the scale what I lose, what community lose. So I'm just thinking arm wrestling loses more. So that is,
SPEAKER_01: why i'm just saying hey guys you know i'm not a millionaire support me and let me be a bridge between you and your dreams absolutely hanging did you did you try to have uh some kind of agreement maybe or uh just uh maybe a partnership of some type with larry wills and uh king of the table do you have any no they have they have their own way i have my own way i i i do work with core sports
SPEAKER_00: And yeah, I mean, that is how we go, you know. I mean, they just do their way. I do in Turkey my way. I mean, we are unofficially that way. Like Adam is going to come here. Two times I hosted here Larry Wills. I mean, Adam will be, you know, just together with the core sports. He will be with us. It is an unofficial cooperation anyways there.
SPEAKER_01: okay perfect yeah yeah what i'm trying to say that maybe they can help financially or uh maybe they can help bring the sponsors for your event because yes i understand they're doing their event but they went as we said the very top elite few outlets and maybe i'm doing events that you know it is i'm so much risking myself right i'm
SPEAKER_00: barely covering the event or not i don't know yet we will say this one yeah so i don't i don't think that anyone would just get part of it there is there is nothing to gain you know what i mean yeah you can gain stress yeah i will tell you something you know i shared this many times but i could just organize there dave chaffee versus morozov gennady versus jerry brudnick versus uh tatashins ongarway versus john brzing all matches
SPEAKER_00: don't get me wrong but maybe if it would sell only 10 less than what it's gonna sell this time probably yeah but but but i am organizing 16 matches the flights hotel and this and that and the prize money why do i do that because you love arm wrestling yeah i love arm wrestling of course i don't want to lose money i don't want to lose money i have a family too but i love arm wrestling
SPEAKER_00: I love our messaging. I want to keep them motivated. I want to create a league so that we all together grow. Ryan, just go sleep, my friend. It is 8 o'clock here, so it must be 3 AM in Australia. Who is he arguing with? With you, Herman? Everybody. No, he's arguing with not Herman. He's arguing with everybody else.
SPEAKER_02: It's an interesting, I love the chats on these videos. They're always so interesting. I'll come on every week. I don't even have to talk. Just to read the chat is worthwhile. Yeah, this is great. I have to go, guys. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's just a bunch of mess. I mean, I'm here with like three of the most intelligent guys, you know. I so much enjoy. And then, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: You guys are like great to represent my channel, you know. I mean, it is great to have you guys. And yeah, Ryan says 3 a.m. in the morning. Yeah, 3 a.m. He's still going. He's a madman. I have to run, fellas. I would like to stay more, but I have to go to a meeting. Yeah, just go to work. We will close. Yep, it will be.
SPEAKER_00: hopefully next week but probably next week around these times i will be going to airport bringing people i will start from monday i will start from monday uh i think london is coming monday and then tuesday this guy three the next day every day somebody will be coming yeah thank you thank you for joining great to see you guys thanks for the conversation and i'll see you all soon i hope yeah
SPEAKER_00: um yep so you're gonna watch the events uh herman are you gonna wait for three days so that it will be free no i'll be i'll be watching the event i'll buy it but if you know something happens and i can't watch it you know i'll watch it later but uh i always buy it no matter what yeah it will be good yeah it will be good and and just get ready get ready for the future events
SPEAKER_00: You say like, I feel good. I do this. I do that. And then Ryan Bowen comes in and you're like, Oh, I'm not confident. No, it's the same thing with like Jonathan or whatever Jonathan says, we should go to this tournament. And I go, no, it does. It has nothing to do with Ryan. I could, it could be a tournament with nobody. I'm not going. Cause you know, I don't want to get re-injured. You know, I feel good. Why are you training? You said that you're constantly training and it's helping you a lot. Remember last time you told me?
SPEAKER_02: yeah i'm training so that when i actually feel healthy and ready to compete i'll be able to go compete maybe six months from now but i don't want to rush back into it and re-injure myself that's what i've done for the last few years you know what's going to happen you're not going to compete at all i don't i mean i'm thinking maybe in september i might do a tournament but i got to see how i feel you know but you're talking about you are not sure about that stage but
SPEAKER_00: you need to start from somewhere a little bit. Yeah, but even like this weekend, I'm not doing a tournament. In August, I'm not doing a tournament. Maybe September, you know, we'll see. By the way, that match, Jonathan Breda and Bowen Kelly. Oh, man. Don't expect it to be easy just because the guy is lighter than Jonathan. No, no, he's bigger than Jonathan. That's the scary thing. No, he's not. He's like a little bit over 90 kilos.
SPEAKER_02: no he's lighter than jonathan yeah but he's bigger than jonathan like paul talbot paul talbot is very light but that is a big person yeah he is he's bigger bigger than me actually the frame people may say well herman weighs 50 40 more pounds who cares paul talbot is way bigger than i am you know
SPEAKER_02: You also carry some unnecessary weight as well, a little bit. Yeah, but even if I was 280 or 180, I'm saying Paul is a bigger man. He's not a tall, skinny person either. He's taller than me. His shoulders would probably be maybe as wide. I don't know. But that's my point. Like the weight doesn't always matter when these guys are that big. You know, the structures are big. Yeah, his joints are strong, but he's not muscular.
SPEAKER_02: i think his muscle you know is bigger than that but i think there is a weight limit there under kilo i'm not sure jonathan's not that heavy anyway i mean he's usually around 100 105 so it's not crazy um but i i ingan i never approve of jonathan's super matches i was okay with zarab
SPEAKER_02: And I'm okay with that Keely. So I'm just lucky and happy. He's not pulling some weak guy, you know, or someone too far under him. He's pulling a super elite guy. So I told him I was happy, but usually I have to, you know, kind of do this. Cause he's, he's, she's pulling people. He shouldn't pull. I think, I think it's going to be a long hook match, a long hook match. Yeah. I'm hoping Jonathan just top rolls them. It's going to be, that's going to be hard too.
SPEAKER_02: but uh i wouldn't want to go in the book he better be careful beth can top role as well yeah yeah i wouldn't want jonathan to hook because jonathan has kind of like an open hook style whereas but keely can be sideways you don't want to pull against an elbow like that you know okay i want to see jonathan high post with uh kind of high hooked up or top yeah low top roll yeah did we ever pull him who jonathan
SPEAKER_01: yeah oh yeah we're friends yeah and we are we are i don't know we're two two probably now two two yeah so and you see i'm i'm not right really i'm not left here naturally i'm not lefty so i still pull left you guys but naturally i'm writing so it's a little bit um it's strong arm but it's a little bit uncomfortable and i cannot transition too comfortable
SPEAKER_01: so yeah uh but uh it's uh he can give problems to anybody jonathan when he's ready very dangerous opponent very dangerous opponent he was very ready when you come here but also was very strong listen somebody needs to win but yeah jonathan is very good puller yes he is up there very strong yeah
SPEAKER_00: Let's see how it will be with Betkel. Betkel, his left arm is also there. Incredible. Another guy that I invited here was Revaz. He was not available, but I would like to see him pulling against maybe Daniel Prokopchuk, Sandris Dikilo. He would be a very good one, huh, Herman? Say that again, Engin? I invited Revaz. How they count?
SPEAKER_00: oh yeah yeah yeah yeah and but he was not available but he versus daniel prokopchuk with 80 kilo limit it would be a good match oh yeah yeah that guy needs to pull i really like watching him on russell yeah they if they pull i'm i'm guessing that they will pull like you remember the cherkasov versus did you see that much daniel prokopchuk match he was like what 11 minutes or something
SPEAKER_00: i probably forgot yeah with 70 kilo left arm i was right there at the front i was doing commentary for the olympic channel it was front of me i i thought that i i thought that you know what i'm having like deja vu you know just seeing the same thing over and over and over i was like like like is it real you know the the remember there was a tv show elm street you know freddy krueger
SPEAKER_00: yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah they they go with the car and then they they end up the same place again they go whatever their direction go and i was like like what is this is it like i'm sleeping is it like like nothing is moving there that they are yeah sweden sweden sweden and i was like i'm like pinching myself is it real like wow you never watched that match daniel versus i may have i mean i've seen some long matches i just don't know if i remember that one specifically or maybe i forgot that it was 11 minutes long
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah, yeah. But I think Vresh needs to be on the card, especially after what he's done in the United States. Every elite armistice you can think of, I think I invited. If I'm missing any, I don't know. But if it is very, very elite guy, he is invited. The Russians cannot be invited because of that. I even invited Rustam Babaev. Rustam said he cannot get out of Ukraine. But Petrenko, Margarets,
SPEAKER_00: and rustam all these ukrainians you know monsters you know um if it is possible if they can get out my door is open for them but just do you understand me now yeah yeah how can i exclude these guys you know how low you understand right yes 30 years you have been one of them and then you organize in an event when they're asking engine i would like to compete your event you feel like it's your responsibility because the guy deserves
SPEAKER_00: yeah you understand my point yeah they all the names you mentioned they all deserve it yeah yeah and and another guy comes he's like oh if this guy is not there i'm not watching what can i do what can i do as i said you are a fan of an arm wrestler you are not arm wrestling fan yeah because if if there is only one guy that you want to watch on this earth then what can i do i mean it means that once the guy quits
SPEAKER_01: then you are no you cannot you cannot be good for everybody that's for sure when you're organizing the the event of this scale well you have to be a diplomat already and uh yeah go between the raindrops yeah i understand like i i really would wish to see like rushtan baba here absolutely but imagine that you know imagine that like how can you not enjoy
SPEAKER_00: right now at the east versus west what is the most competitive weight category between 100 and under 10 right yes imagine here rustam is joining i think he's joining and margaret is joining wow mess mess yeah guys like i mean just i mean i would watch them every day i would just change the pairs pull them and then seriously
SPEAKER_00: it's just i mean to be honest that's the probably uh maybe 95 to 105 kilos probably that's the most dangerous and complicated class i mean yeah some 95 plus and 105 plus those two classes yeah from i can say 95 to 110 yeah is you know there even mad mass can go down sundries can go down you know there is lachlan yourself
SPEAKER_00: john tatashins directly but everybody is there i mean come on you know just look at there you know just like wow i mean seriously and people are suggesting me if i should do some kind of like top eight typo league or something but um i think i think that i i will just let them pull
SPEAKER_00: and then slowly they will know the rankings you know because this guy beat that guy that guy beat that guy and then i think that you know there will be some matches for ranking some matches for the title it can go but do you guys think that like i shouldn't give chance like for example for 70 kilo chelka so i shouldn't give a chance like chelka versus mindagua star ascites absolutely oh my god how can you ignore paulo
SPEAKER_00: no you cannot ignore that stuff i mean i would love to see it i mean probably there is a lot of people who would love to see that happen yeah yeah yeah so this is my my intention is because arm wrestling community is like seeing only a few selected guys but they don't know these guys so if i try to bring them these guys to their attention so they will have more idea that you know arm wrestling is much much bigger
SPEAKER_00: deeper yeah what they have been seeing this this is what i try to do like bojidar versus samusha incredible mass there is no match that is better than that maybe only if you would add that alan zole under 80 kilo you understand yeah and then then you would have something anyways go ahead you missed the super chat can you can somebody read it oh there is super chat yes
SPEAKER_02: Okay, JCG, JCG says, Ingen, when I said John finding YouTube and doing events is what brings eyes to the sport, that wasn't toward you. It was in response to Pablo talking about Devin and LeVon. Yeah, I understand. Thank you for your super chat, but you are right. But it is incredible that this guy at the age of 58 just come back after near six years old
SPEAKER_00: uh, break and still can shake the walls. Like whenever I watch him, you were right there, Paulo, the round five, 40 West match from, it was like 3 30 or 4 00 AM. I don't remember here. Can you imagine that some people loves it around the same time? It's Italy, same town zone. Maybe he's one hour earlier. It was also up watching this. And as soon as the match finished, he's texting me again.
SPEAKER_00: john is incredible john is great so that guy loves arm wrestling you understand he it is in his blood i was the same way and i cannot imagine how you felt while you were there alive that when he stopped him a few feet away a few feet away seriously like you got like amazed right inspiration right
SPEAKER_00: yeah and i pulled john two months earlier yeah and i knew exactly where where who at and it was like ah yeah yeah yeah yeah and and he is the 58 years old guy he is he pushes limits so much that stop him there his head came with because of the blood pressure so red
SPEAKER_00: and he realized that he was gonna like almost heart attack you know he was like he was breathing but i mean but imagine this guy when he was 30 35. but he was so happy when he did that yeah yeah but he's still inspiring us at that age you know yeah it's up there too it's up there too he's uh he has that mentality he's a special person for sure special not normal person i'm telling you there is something different i don't believe this kind of
SPEAKER_01: mystery things you know i don't believe but about him i believe that that is there is something different i don't know what exactly but something is different with the guy yeah i love him i love john yeah and i asked him before that for my super match for my first super match there at the monster factory i didn't have anybody in my corner and uh i was walking by john and like john do you mind just stay in my corner for a minute while i'm pulling he's like yeah sure absolutely
SPEAKER_00: yeah yeah yeah okay such a good good natured guy yeah yeah he's um i have a story that maybe i shouldn't share but i will say because there is nothing bad with it um john was invited to norway to give seminar with me last year august or something and because his typo vaccine johnson
SPEAKER_00: was not recognized by the European Union or something in Europe, he was not. So at the last moment, he couldn't come. But the organizer, because the organizer Erling is also a wonderful person from Norway. He said, John, you couldn't come, but you know, we promised you something. I would like to transfer that to you. And John said, no, I didn't come. So I don't want anything. The guy just like, like first personality, you understand?
SPEAKER_00: course we all try for money but but the guy is i mean there is something more than that you understand he's just like i think you understand his uh integrity this is what i what i see with him as well um you were saying something herman we were talking about the uh super chat or you were gonna say something else oh um so you know you're talking about some of these other matches
SPEAKER_02: you know, not the big super heavyweights or the popular people, but Mendoza, Churkasov, this kind of stuff. So I think it's good to have those matches, but I think those pullers need to fulfill their part of the bargain. And I think they need to get more active on the social media, right? That way you use Ryan Bowen and Ray and you use Todd Hutchings and the popular people
SPEAKER_02: Once they're looking at Mendoza, Mendoza needs to have his channel. Cause they're going to say, wow, who is this Mendoza guy? And they can go to YouTube. No, I don't know. Yeah. I don't know the details, but hypothetically speaking, they're going to go look for him. And if there's videos there, they can go, you know what? I really like Mendoza. I think Mendoza is pretty cool and they become fans of Mendoza. Right. So then he has more opportunities to kind of get on the stage.
SPEAKER_00: You know, so I think, I think they need to do more on their part and it's, it's tough. You should be able to be just an athlete, but today is different. I think you go ahead. They need to promote, they need to promote them and they need to understand that, you know, I can do something. I can bring them here only if we can, uh, take attention from the, uh, community they watch and then.
SPEAKER_00: know that is how we finance the event that they need to understand that this this is not only by the sponsor or something but like for example matt mask just go to matt mask facebook page does matt mask have a match in august no just go to matt mask facebook page after he came here after he left here till now you will see many times he shared
SPEAKER_00: East versus West for events. The paper ruling this and that, you know, the guy just he knows that it takes only two minutes. He supports me understand his support. Yeah, even he doesn't have any match. Yesterday. Malin shared, Anna shared, Pia shared, there's Petra from all this from Sweden. They just share. Timmy Turner, time to time he just shares, you know, so
SPEAKER_00: that that is not because people doesn't want to watch this, but this information is not rich to some of the community. So that is, that is how we will grow. You know, that's how we will grow, you know? Yeah. Especially if you're a paid, like if East versus West is paying you like part of that money is going to come from pay-per-view. So it's in your best interest to promote the event, but,
SPEAKER_02: Let's say that the athletes shouldn't have to promote the event. Let's say that's the case. They should be more active so that they can, they'll actually make more money in the long term if they actually do the promotion. Because now when people look at the event, they will build their own fans. They will be more likely to get invited to not just your event, but to King of the Table, to WAL. That's how they can get some of Ryan's views, some of Ray's views.
SPEAKER_02: some of Todd's subscribers. And it's hard. I mean, I haven't done my channel. I don't really like it that much, except for some of the chats and the drama. But I think these days, if you want to be a serious arm wrestler and you really want to be on the stage, I think you have to do the YouTube part of it. And not for Ingen. And not for Ingen, but you have to do it for yourself. Just everyone needs to understand that if somehow I...
SPEAKER_00: get more money from pay-per-view, then for sure what athletes are getting will increase too. I'm not that type of person, you understand? If something more is coming, it will be shared with them. That is for sure. Believe it or not, I'm not that selfish person, you understand?
SPEAKER_00: it is already increasing some of the athletes you know some athletes think that you know i mean okay i'm not gonna go there but yeah guys i'm very sorry but i have to say bye to everybody i got around yeah we are leaving too thank you very much paulo okay thank you guys yeah can we can we invite you again hopefully absolutely anytime i'm enjoying this yeah we also enjoy you being uh part of us thank you very much and hope to see you someday at east versus west as well
SPEAKER_00: If you like me, I'll be there. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. Take care. Thank you very much, guys. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Yeah. I'm glad that we do this program with you. Yeah. Like the reason the reason just don't forget what you're going to say that like I know you and John. Good. Good enough. I know you guys and I know how much you guys help me.
SPEAKER_00: and lately i have been inviting paulo to this program and i see his intention too you understand good intention yeah so i i'm feeling more comfortable when i am around people that i can you know i mean i can more relax talking you understand more comfortably you understand yeah and you guys are smart we have something in common which is arm wrestling and it is great yeah yeah yeah
SPEAKER_02: um you know we i could mention this earlier and i don't know if it's really doable but uh and a smaller event where the athletes get a commission or a percentage of the pay-per-view kind of interesting i think the athlete would be motivated to promote and maybe they have a better chance at getting more money do you think that all the athletes from east to west are ready for such things
SPEAKER_02: Maybe not. I like the idea. But like, I like the idea to that, that way, you can push it more and more and more. Yeah. I need to ask them, please, you know. Yeah, but some people would never do it. Right. You know, some people want their guaranteed money before they even get on the plane. And they won't consider any alternatives. But it would be interesting to see what would happen in that scenario.
SPEAKER_00: um with everyone kind of pulling everyone's pushing the ship you know to get more views you know yeah i mean i i'm i'm do you know i even like i i don't do even matches like you know winner gets this much the one who loses get this metro type you know you know it is just you know most of the times fixed money you understand the reason i do that i just
SPEAKER_00: want them to feel comfortable you understand yeah i don't want to i don't want them to push themselves too hard to get even too aggressive of course for their own glory i understand but not not for the money so that is why i try to just like both iraqi and crossing were offered the same amount of money and then they made an agreement the winner takes 75 i have nothing to do with this
SPEAKER_00: but like, I just don't want them to be like, you know, the things are a little bit changing, you understand that way a little bit. So I just try to also protect the spirits about the friendly spirits. I'm sure that we will not lose it, but yeah. Yeah. I think when I did, I did a PAL vendetta, I think winner took 60%, 65%. And I think that's how a lot of the smaller super matches are. You know, one guy gets 2000, one guy gets 1000.
SPEAKER_00: So usually there's like a premium to the winner, you know, in those, in other organizations. Yeah. Yeah. I understand. Yeah. I, I don't know the, the way that I look at them is just like, so fellow, like, so not some people that I make money over them, you understand, but someone that fellow arm masters that training hard.
SPEAKER_00: they shouldn't get less money somehow. And then go home and disappointed. I want them to, you understand, like everyone to, I want only thing them to get satisfied is glory of winning, not extra money for winning. You understand? Yeah. Yeah. Or that I lost money or didn't make money when I came. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's terrible feeling. I know. Come here and then,
SPEAKER_00: then you lose okay should you worry about the match that you lost or should you also worry about you know that you lost the money and this and then but whenever the money is at least there is some uh you understand okay i lost i did my best but at least i have the money in my pocket you know that that is i i think i'm too emotional about this kind of things but that's how i see yep anyway so
SPEAKER_00: Anything you want to add before we finish? One more question. Someone asked the question here and they asked last week also, are the Gregaitis brothers still arm wrestling? From Lithuania? I think so. Yeah. Yeah. That's a good question. I know. I haven't seen them. I know the arm wrestlers in Lithuania, they are active.
SPEAKER_00: time to time they do baltic type of event or real news you know the capital of lithuania as far as i know and then with latvians and everyone but i don't know if they are involved there are some other guys i heard the name is is rinkus rinkus right his name yeah i've heard of this guy yeah yeah that's a big guy right yeah i think so his name sounds that way yeah yeah yeah but it was a good guy this um i don't know if they are active or not
SPEAKER_00: They had incredible back pressure, incredible back pressure. I remember one time, one of them top row push car. Yeah. He's like this. Yeah. You, you were there. No, I saw the video. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Let's see how it will be next week. Next week is the event and I will do my best guys. Um,
SPEAKER_00: I expect your support. If you support, we can organize more this event. Thank you very, very much, Herman. In about one and a half hour, I will be guest to Alex Kurdeca. He's his YouTube channel. Nice. Yeah. He's going to come here as well. And he will be part of the event as a guest as Arsene and Hermes.
SPEAKER_00: And let's see how Arsene will be after he comes back when the ban on Russian athletes lifted finally. The bad part is that, you know, if Russians cannot compete, you have different pressure. If they compete, you have different pressure. It's just like, it's just like... You can't win it.
SPEAKER_00: yeah yeah never never you can't do anything about you i mean you you are the bad guy you know even you have nothing to do with the war you have nothing to do with that i explained we are over here the member of waf and you know if the waf has a sanction you know then you need to follow that otherwise this and this is going to happen but that even the russian at this understand that i talk all the time with lalatin i talk with uh slayer wants to compete you know
SPEAKER_00: I would like to invite Bogoslov. Bogoslov, yeah. And there are many, many Russian athletes, great athletes. These are our friends for many years. And I explained to them that I can only invite you when the ban is lifted. It's International Olympic Committee to put pressure on the all international sport federations about this.
SPEAKER_00: but they had to follow. But there is a possibility that they may not allow Russia to compete, or Russian Federation, or Russian team. But individually, they may allow Atlas to compete. But still, we are not there. Thank you. Thank you very much, Herman. Thank you. And I hope to see you again. This is always fun. It's always fun, my friend. Oh, for sure. Good seeing you again. Yeah. Tell Jonathan I said hello. I wish him the best.
SPEAKER_00: We'll do. Later. Okay. Bye-bye. Thanks, everyone. Thank you, guys.
