SPEAKER_00: to translate oh man and all this time i thought i was going to be the best looking guy but you're going to beat me there too nah i don't think so hello guys hi hello hello hello hello paulo hello buddy have you been
SPEAKER_00: On diet? I've been trying to lose weight for you, Ingen. I just don't want to look fat for you. Yeah, you don't look fat. You look like Hollywood stars. I've lost a little bit of weight, but mainly my body's just changing a little bit. My body fat percentage has dropped down.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I can see that. Seriously, you look like easily seven, eight years younger than last time I saw you. Oh, I had a beard trim yesterday and a haircut. That's probably why. Yeah, I'm not. I'm not. I'm probably the lightest guy here by now. Engie, what are you weight now? 92, 93, like 200 pounds, around 200 pounds. I'm bigger. What are you?
SPEAKER_02: I'm 232, 233 now. 230. Wow. I was 352 the other day. Hey, I'm jealous. You're big and strong. Well, big for sure. Yeah. No, I mean, seriously, you look different. You look different. It's the mustache, Ingen.
SPEAKER_02: no i have a question paulo yes like does any of us like have some problem with the internet getting cut i think i i don't think so now yours may be a little bit it's been like vibrating but not getting cut hmm
SPEAKER_02: Kody has a perfect picture. Well, it's because I'm in it. Yes, that's right. That's right. That's right. Yep. Artem will be coming soon. Okay. We're a little early anyway. Yeah. So did you like the award?
SPEAKER_00: think it's super cool i didn't see it what it is will you will you defend it three times will you win it and i i really really want to engen i really do but uh i don't know i don't know how strong how strong artem is just such an unknown for me yeah yeah um he he looks super super strong um
SPEAKER_00: And really the only two people that we both arm wrestled were Arif and Matt Mask. And even those ones weren't very good to judge off of because I arm wrestled Matt in 2018.
SPEAKER_02: and then Arif and Artem arm wrestled when Artem was when excuse me when Arif was hurt after the world championship so it's not really a good yeah yeah yeah Arif versus Morozov wasn't something that you can judge by but I'm thinking that Artem is now even stronger than the time that he met Arif so we don't know
SPEAKER_02: We don't know where exactly he is, and we don't know where you are compared to. I only know one thing that you are now in a stronger shape than you facing face out of in Romania 2019. I am. I am stronger after I broke my arm. I've had some issues with dealing with that, but I am. I am stronger than I was then. So yeah.
SPEAKER_00: yeah this is yeah yeah you know he's really strong pop pablo is a str he is super strong we we after pulled in texas that dude it took everything in my power to beat him i heard that he beat some practice did he what you mean training or the competition you mean it was a competition after pull oh after oh okay and he felt like a tank
SPEAKER_02: No, I'm cheating. Listen, now you're confusing me. I saw him against Paul Calvert. Okay, Paul is an animal, strong, but Paul is 187, 190-pound guy. And if Paulo is doing you that kind of damage, you may be, Paulo is not weak, but for your category, Paulo is not super overweight. So if Paulo is causing that much of problems,
SPEAKER_02: Uh, one second, let me consider this. Uh, uh, can we cancel that match? Yeah, I think, I think it's a mismatch. Well, there wasn't any hitting, so that makes it a little bit different, but still. Yeah. Okay.
SPEAKER_02: I'm just teasing you. I'm just teasing because you like to play that, that like underdog so terribly. Well, it's true. I am the underdog in this match. I'm not sure how I see that the 50 50. I see. I mean, the guy has some tools that you don't have, but you have some tools that he doesn't have. I see that match. I don't know your, your side pressure, your, your, I would say
SPEAKER_02: You are like, how to say, like tough guy that you can pull in any position. And because all you do is table time, you know how to generate pressure to win inside, you know, in any position. It doesn't matter if your wrist is a little bit bent or something. So that is like, Artem needs to dominate you to beat you. If the match somehow, like if you both lose the wrist, if it stays like this,
SPEAKER_02: and then the match is over you're gonna you're gonna beat him he needs to really dominate you yeah i feel that way too if i can get his wrist straight i feel good no matter if mine's bent or not if his is straight i think i'm good yeah yeah yeah so that that's what i'm talking about yeah so it is your back pressure your back pressure before the go your back pressure will be very important yeah yeah
SPEAKER_02: Well, and one, one thing that I have that he doesn't have is this mustache. Yeah. It makes so much difference. Yeah. Especially in super heavyweight category. Look at, look at Levan, look at Genadi, look at Dave, look at Michael, you know, but there are some baby faces like Slaev, you know? Yeah. Yeah. So he looks impressive. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: see paulo why do you think that paulo suddenly got so much strong why do i think all the beers yes pablo has always been strong he just didn't all of a sudden get strong no i'm just joking i'm just joking i have seen his pictures without the beard he looks much younger i don't think pablo i've ever seen you without a beard you've always had a beard since i've known you
SPEAKER_04: no no no i started growing there it's about two years old two and a half i've been but uh i didn't have this isn't that when we met it was like two years ago in kansas city yeah it's about just about yeah yeah kansas city about two years ago you're right yeah i mean i i had the smaller one like this but yeah yeah
SPEAKER_04: my wife doesn't like the big beard so i have to cut it off yeah i don't know it's growing we'll see maybe i'll cut it off too artyom we gotta look at it like this
SPEAKER_02: Artyom looks so young again. He looks like it's still the youth category puller, like 20 years old. Turn the phone sideways. No, no, he's good now. He's good now. I don't know. It looks to me like this. We all are like... Artyom, try again. Dave the old man help him how to run his camera, his phone.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I don't... Because he's shaved, that's why he looks young. Yeah, yeah. See, Levon, Genadi, Michael Todd, Dave Chaffee, you need to grow beard. And look at Kody.
SPEAKER_04: With beards, yeah, that is why. On those things, he will beat you like this. Pushkar and Tsyplenkov didn't have any beards, so he will be fine.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, but it is 2022. That's why Denis cannot make a comeback. Tell him, please. He shaved it just to give it a new birth, so it's going to be thicker and better now.
SPEAKER_04: Like mine. Like yours. In two weeks. If you can pull out some of yours and give it to him, so it's grown on him better. Just the gray ones. He can have all the gray ones. He says you can have all the gray ones.
SPEAKER_03: Artem, did you like the awards for the title matches? Artem, did you like the awards for the title matches?
SPEAKER_02: uh before you come cody was telling us that you know how he is going to hit like you eat like you know train to you one more time
SPEAKER_03: Like a train, he said, like a train. Yeah, he's joking, he says that at the start he'll hit you like a train. David you see when Hulk stopped this big movie, Avengers, Hulk stopped this huge alien ship with one blow? It was the same.
SPEAKER_04: saying that did you see how hulk in a movie uh whatever in his hulk movie stopped the uh uh aliens ship it's gonna be the same so paulo how do you see this match my friend
SPEAKER_04: uh you know what it's uh it's the match probably the one the most interesting match for me i don't know i think that cody is a slight favorite but uh artyom is uh
SPEAKER_04: uh growing so fast so uh if it would be a year ago i would say that cody will win it easy this time uh it's gonna be interesting i think it's about 50 50. maybe cody's slight favorite maybe 55 to 45 or something like that but it's gonna be a very interesting match slide should be 51 49. uh are you going to beat cody
SPEAKER_02: Will you win against Kody? Of course. For sure. Love that. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. What did he say? Shaw us your biceps. Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Hey, has he seen, has he, has he seen a doctor about all those weird bumps? Yeah. I said, I sent him a picture the other day that I found a vein after a workout. So that's what he's talking about.
SPEAKER_02: sure um is your chance higher against dave chaffee or cody compared to each other can i answer that no i want to hear from him i'm tired of you playing underdog
SPEAKER_02: I want you to just, Kody, say that I'm coming to Istanbul and I'm going to kick his ass. I want you to say this, Kody. Artyom, do you think your chances are higher with Kody or Dave Chaffee? Dave Chaffee. Yes, Dave Chaffee is higher.
SPEAKER_04: He's saying that the most important match is with himself, so he has to win with himself first and then everything will be fine with his opponents. What kind of problem, what kind of struggle he has with himself? He has confidence problem?
SPEAKER_03: Do you have problems with confidence? Always. In fact, for example, during training, I hate myself because I always want more from myself.
SPEAKER_04: he said that during any training he hates himself because he always wants more from himself i think it's good so this is his problem with himself he's never satisfied yeah he always wants yeah that's good right i mean
SPEAKER_02: But he said that he has to win the battle against him first himself I didn't understand the relation between that my question about he versus Dave and Kody which one he has more chance against and then whenever he said he's never satisfied that that I didn't understand the.
SPEAKER_04: Let me ask him. Artyom, he is asking seriously. Who do you think you have a better chance with? With Kody Merritt or Dave Chaffee? Because you said that you need to win yourself first, but he still wants to hear. I got it. I think with Dave. With Dave you have a higher chance to win, right? Yes.
SPEAKER_00: he thinks that uh there is a better chance to win dave than cody oh he has more chance to win again then then cody wow what's happening between you two yeah we're best friends we're buddies oh okay okay okay we're we're best friends now we we just uh we're gonna go up there and hug and and wish each other the best of luck
SPEAKER_02: And then what are you guys going to play? Tom Russell? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So that's the interesting thing I just heard. He thinks that his fans...
SPEAKER_04: Hold on a second. Kody says that you are friends, we will hug before the competition and wish each other good luck, and then we will fight. But Angel started to joke a little, he says, yes, you will play this game, who will get a finger from whom.
SPEAKER_02: That yeah that's that's interesting like that he thinks that his chance against Dave chappie higher compared to his chance against cody i'm not saying that. i'm not saying that like it is weird, but whenever I look at the polls he's heavily underdog. Again, Dave.
SPEAKER_02: And then Kody is heavily underdog against Artem when we look at the polls. So that is interesting. Can you translate it?
SPEAKER_04: Yes, so Engin says that if you look at the poster that he made and all these comments, then everyone thinks that the favorite between you and Dave is Dave, that you kind of lose to Dave, but between you and Kody, that the favorite is you and Kody will lose. So he says it's very interesting why you said that, why you think so.
SPEAKER_02: uh he wanted like that that's it he want to think like that well he wanted it so he doesn't really think that well he wants to think that way yes that's interesting simple chat parker timber thank you my friend artom and cody cute little guys he says thank you and parker's one of my teammates he trains with me
SPEAKER_02: Oh, so that is what was why he calls you a little kid. Yeah, yeah. Two cute little guys. About you and about Kody. Kody, not Kody. Artyom looks thinner, thinner compared to last time. Is he really thinner?
SPEAKER_04: No, no, he actually gained a little weight, but he's leaner. That's why on the face he looks skinnier. What's his exact weight right now?
SPEAKER_00: How much do you weigh now? 132. 132 kilos. Wow, 132 kilos. Yes. Somebody is coming big. What does that translate to in pounds? No, no, no, 290. 290, approximately. Yeah, 290 pounds.
SPEAKER_00: He needs to go to the doctor and check those bumps out. Yeah, I told him already. Yeah, but it's not fair. You are 353. Yeah, but I don't have any of those bumps. Mine's all fat. His is all muscle. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yes, about 160 kilograms. And he says, no, he says everything is honest, he has only muscles, I have fat, I don't have these buggers, he says. I understand, buggers. Well, I'm still planning, I'm going to rest now, and in any case, I will recover and gain weight, that is, I will no longer be so thin. We still have a lot of heat.
SPEAKER_04: Artyom is saying that he will take a rest very soon and he will even gain even a little more weight.
SPEAKER_04: feed himself a little fatter, not fat, but a little more. But he said it's a problem because it's very hot in Kazakhstan. They have some ACs, but he doesn't like to use them because he's getting sick very fast. It's hard for him. Tell him to go ahead and start that rest right now.
SPEAKER_04: he have only three more trainings and then yes he will take a rest don't worry about it don't worry about it anyways there's a super chat sean
SPEAKER_02: Thank you for your support, my friend. I really don't know how to pronounce your last name, but Crowther, maybe. I don't know. Sorry if I did wrong. Kody and Artem are two of the nicest guys I have ever met. So much respect for those two. Can't wait for their match.
SPEAKER_04: Thank you very much. This guy is 290 pounds and ready. And I also talk with
SPEAKER_02: robert baxter i talked with bob brown they all think that you are also in amazing shape cody they say that they have never seen you this strong before i mean they have seen you but they think that you are in your best shape of your life well those are those guys are my good friends they got to tell you that stuff they're not going to lie to you or they're not going to say something that's going to make me look bad
SPEAKER_02: I don't think that they were trying to give some kind of compliment to a friend or something. We were just having an honest conversation. And they were telling us, you know, even your right arm feels so strong, they say. And they, I don't know. I don't know. Yeah. I mean, I just can't wait.
SPEAKER_04: I just can't wait. You know, that's going to be a good match. Yeah. I hope so. I hope I don't get embarrassed. How old are you, Kody? 48.
SPEAKER_02: So you are 48 years old and I think Dave is 45, right? Dave is 45. He's a couple of years younger than me, yes. Yeah. So Paulo, he's going to pull two guys. One is 48 years old. The other one is 45 years old. Would you feel bad if
SPEAKER_04: He loses against guys who are old enough to be his father. My father is much older than them, and I lose to him, so it's okay.
SPEAKER_04: saying that his father is much older and he's still losing to him so it's nothing wrong with that tell him he needs to respect his elders okay okay okay what's that tell him what one more time i didn't hear that he needs to respect his elders no sure
SPEAKER_04: Kody, he missed and said that after you beat him, just shake his hand. That's what he's trying to say. Oh, I will. I'll shake his hand. I'm a nice guy. I've been armwrestling longer than he's been alive. And if I win, will you shake his hand?
SPEAKER_04: Artyom is asking if he wins, if Artyom wins, will you shake his hand also? Yes. I'll give him a hug. It is too nice. It is too nice. How can I sell this much?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, exactly. You want me to be cocky guy here? I can. I can translate it. No, Paolo, Paolo. Listen, Paolo, listen. That's not how we talk before the program. Remember I told you that whatever Artem says nice, just say that he says he's going to break Kody's arm.
SPEAKER_04: he's gonna he just doesn't even think that he can be an opponent remember i told you to translate like that you forgot probably you didn't let me translate this to artyom
SPEAKER_04: Okay, stop, Kody, now we have to say shit to each other and we have to be angry.
SPEAKER_02: well i don't know if i can do that i'm not that kind of guy yeah yeah okay listen from now from now from now tell artem to say something in his language please but don't translate one more time i'm sorry i'm getting what says something tell artem just says some things but after he says don't translate please
SPEAKER_02: Just tell him to talk, just whatever. He said he will let you go down like this and then he will risk her and pronate.
SPEAKER_00: and bring here, make his wrist back, bring more, and then end like this. This is exactly what you said, Kody. That's what he said? Yeah. Tell Artem that even if they wake me up from a sleep, when they say, ready, go, I'm still going to beat him. Oh, yeah. Oh, finally. Thank you. Kody says, no. Evgeny if they wake me up, I'll still beat you.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, that's that's really hard for me to do. I don't feel that way at all. They will apply this trap. I will win both of you and you and him too. Oh, there you go. Pablo's the strongest person on this call. Kody, Kody, Kody. If you lose in the first round, I'll let you fight with one finger.
SPEAKER_04: If you lose to him, I'll write you a training program. He's saying, okay, if you will lose the first match in a fair grip, then the second match I will let you arm wrestle my index finger. And if you still gonna lose, then I will write you a training program.
SPEAKER_02: oh that's so generous the question is he going to charge for the training program oh yeah how much does it cost he will make a discount 50 percent
SPEAKER_00: he's such a nice guy i told you yeah it's 50 just like that yeah wow well um one thing to keep in mind that i i have been art i have been arm wrestling longer than artem's been alive so i do know a trick or two
SPEAKER_04: Actually, he's speaking Ukrainian now and he's saying that Blyant said, we'll see.
SPEAKER_02: The blind guy will see. Oh, I understand. Yeah, no, no, guys, this is not drama. We are just joking around. Everyone knows that we are just joking. Yes, these two guys have so much respect for each other. And I think that we are just trying to spend time together, you know. But I will ask some. We talked about the opinions.
SPEAKER_02: about the super matches yeah we already asked arthur about his predictions upcoming matches when he had him you know live together with dave but i would like to ask cody cody which match are you looking forward except your match to just like which one like really excites you or which ones um so maybe this is a little bit weird there's a couple of them that i really excited about
SPEAKER_00: one i want to see coach ray destroy ryan bowen why is that um i like coach ray a lot i think he's an awesome human being and sometimes ryan just bugs me when he says things i don't have anything else ryan per se as a person but sometimes i don't like
SPEAKER_02: his perspectives and how he approaches stuff so i would like to see that match i'd like to see coach ray win that match that's interesting that's interesting that you dislike something and you publicly share it yeah wow that's interesting ryan you must be some interesting person that you know even even you quoted said this and what's the other one
SPEAKER_00: Well, let me give you a little backstory. The first thing that bugs me the most about Ryan Bowen is... Remember when he was talking about the 44% increase in his strength a few years ago? I mean, I didn't watch it, but I heard about it. So at the end of 2019, he did a top 10...
SPEAKER_00: Top 10 things that happen in the world of arm wrestling. And number six on that list was Ryan Bowen's 44% increase in strength. So on his own list, he made himself number six. We're getting 44% stronger. And I thought that was hilarious. And the thing that bugged me the most is that's the year that I won the world championship. And it's the first time in like 20 years that an American had won a world championship. And that didn't even make the top 10.
SPEAKER_02: yeah not i think last nine years i think last one was dave chaffee 2010. super heavyweight super heavyweight okay when was the last time american moon super overweight it was travis pages 2003 2003 yeah yeah yeah 16 years ago yeah from 2019 yeah wow yeah that's that was interesting yeah so i thought that was i thought it was funny that he said that it just kind of rubbed me wrong
SPEAKER_02: yeah being a little bit selfish i guess i understand yeah sometimes we may forget things you know i'm i'm sure that i'm also forgetting i don't know if he did that intentionally or not but no he didn't he didn't he didn't do it intentionally it's just just me getting bugged uh okay so okay now we understand problem is not with you ryan problem is with cody yeah it is it's my problem it's my problem completely 100
SPEAKER_02: artem's got the top gun glasses on yeah according uh yeah i will be back to you now i want to ask artem um um i know it is about 10 30 evening time in kazakhstan is it the the sun is coming from the the window
SPEAKER_04: For the gangs, even at night, the sun is shining. We have a saying in America that the sun's always shining in Dushville. Dushville, yeah, that's right. Terminator, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: And what's the other match, Kody, that you were talking about? Gabi's match. I'm really excited to see Gabi's match. That's interesting. That's interesting. You have a different perspective. But it's the same for me. Gabi versus Egle match is no disrespect to anyone, but probably, in truth, in fact, is the most important match in the cards.
SPEAKER_00: They talk a lot about Gabi and Eglia.
SPEAKER_02: You know, Egle has a winning record against anyone in the history with left arm and anyone with right arm as well, except Irina Makeva. And so Gabriela is probably, she has only two other pullers that she doesn't have a better record against is Irina Makeva and Egle. So, but now,
SPEAKER_02: she looks stronger than before and so it is very interesting much i don't know i don't know how the match is gonna go um from outside gabriella looks like favorite because she has been training a lot i don't know any other match that is interesting for you um well i i'm i'm anxious to see where jerry's at after having not arm wrestled in like three years um like uh i
SPEAKER_00: don't know he he he his his move is so difficult to defend against or to arm wrestle against and he's so good at it and gannati gannati's just a bad dude like he's amazing and i love watching him arm wrestle and i'm just i'm anxious to see what what happens there because
SPEAKER_00: i just i just it's hard for me to believe that someone can pull dave or excuse me jerry through that that flop pris um but if anybody can do it he's got the tools to do it so that's exciting are you excited to be on the same stage with those guys oh yeah yeah it's a huge honor like to even be a part of this card is a huge honor there's so many amazing arm wrestlers that are going to be there i'm so excited about it yeah but just remember there are only seven title matches
SPEAKER_02: you are one of them so you are more than good enough to be on that stage my friends and we are also we are also honored to you know have you there and artom which match which matches any of what cody says to the russians actually it's not going to be a translation it's going to be just a brief explanation what you've been talking about
SPEAKER_04: First, we talked about the Supermatches that are going on, and he asked Kody what Supermatches he would like to see. Kody said that he was interested in the women's Supermatch, Egle and Gabi. And they talked about who is the favorite, what kind of record they have.
SPEAKER_04: He said that he would be interested to see Jerry Cadillac in what form he will return. And it will also be a very interesting match, because Jerry has such a very uncomfortable, such a strange technique with his flap press so fast. Well, they also discussed who has what chances. Well, of course, Genadi trains and all that, and has the best chances against him. It will be very interesting.
SPEAKER_04: Yes, then they said that, well, Kody asked, listen, will you be happy to be with these people on the same stage? He says, well, yes, it's a very cool super card, and being a part of it is already very cool. They thanked each other, and that's it. I agree with him.
SPEAKER_02: Okay. Yeah, I want to ask him. I want to ask. I want to ask him. I asked his predictions before when he was my guest together with Dave. So this time I'm not going to ask predictions, but which matches other than his matches like excites him, you know, like exciting, you know, just to watch, you know, like he's waiting, like how it's going to be. Is there any match that, you know, he's waiting to watch?
SPEAKER_04: in that card other than his matches?
SPEAKER_03: Interesting. Because Egle is a world champion, I think, above 80, above 90 kilograms. And Gabriela, she fought up to 70, I think, before. Now I don't know. It's interesting for me to see. Because I see how Gabi is trained. It's like a man training. Not bad, not bad weights.
SPEAKER_03: Again, it's interesting. I always like to watch Genadi fight. I'm always interested in watching any fight. Because it's emotions, it's very beautiful, it's like a nuclear bomb.
SPEAKER_04: okay so uh he started uh with uh the first match is very interesting for him second matches ladies uh gabriella and uh
SPEAKER_04: ugly he said that egla uh was a world champion in uh plus category right and uh when gabby was pulling him off uh he believes that he she was lighter category under 70 kilos so he's a very interesting match plus uh gabriella is training like uh he said like a man you know so means she's training very heavy so interesting match
SPEAKER_04: And then he said that Genadi Kutvinia is very interesting and his armwrestling is beautiful and it's always like a nuclear bomb. It's a very interesting match for him. Anything else, Artem?
SPEAKER_03: Who else to look at? Well, it's interesting to look at Prudnik with Todd, because no one has ever put Todd Hutchings, and he has always surprised. And I'm interested to see. I don't care for anyone, but I would like Todd Hutchings to check all these expectations again.
SPEAKER_04: Okay, and he's saying also that Prudnik and Todd Hutchings will be very intrigued because nobody ever bet on Todd Hutchings and he's proving, proving, proving everybody wrong every time. And he's saying that he's not going to cheer for anybody, but he, somewhere deep in his soul, he wants to Hutchings prove it again and win.
SPEAKER_00: I actually am very interested in that match as well. They're both hilarious. Like, they're funny guys. They're good to be around. And they're both incredibly strong. So I'm excited to see that match as well. Yeah, I think it will be a funny, funny press conference. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, but you'll be ready. I will be messing with you a lot, Kody. Hey, I'm bringing a gift for Artem to the press conference. You are? Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: he will be there with a gift too he's gonna he's gonna bring kazakhstan chocolate i know
SPEAKER_02: Can you invite me, please? Because he's bringing the Kazakhstan cognac. I'm not going to be a vehicle for that. That is probably in my beliefs.
SPEAKER_02: no no no you can come he can bring you gifts but i i i won't invite you because of that hopefully someday i will invite you for an athlete as an athlete to compete but not for vodka okay okay well that's unfortunate but i'll take it it is better it's better to be invited there as an athlete than then then for vodka trust me it is you it will be more honoring you know
SPEAKER_02: uh by the way i said cobra for november events cobra cobra roads cobra really yes cobra roads will be pulling another guy at his 50s that hasn't been training or pulling but they both have four months to train now from now on under 165 kilo both are multiple times world champion that's haidar gilded from turkey
SPEAKER_02: uh, three times senior world champion and Cobra is six times senior world champion. And these two had the final in WAF in 2000 Virginia. So Cobra won first and Haider was second. So now it's a revenge for 22 years ago, you know, so that, that is on that stage. Usually we will have not usually, but we will have the best ever athletes of today.
SPEAKER_02: But this is a different subject. This is legends. And maybe in the future, I will invite, if he comes, Dave Patton. Wouldn't it be incredible? That would be amazing. Bring in here Alan Fisher. But, you know, finding an opponent for them, you understand, from the similar times, with the similar, you understand, so that it will be very fair. But, you know, we all owe to these legends, you know. You know, just we, I mean, we grew up by watching them. You know, they inspired us.
SPEAKER_02: will be incredible so we will start with cobra cobra rose versus hyder gilded november 19th east versus west five that means i'm excited about that that means i have to win for sure so i can go back yeah you need to you need to win yeah that that's your you need to just kick his ass yes you see that that you see that like look at that that's just like a teenager look at him are you gonna baby no
SPEAKER_02: No way you're going to beat him. Translate, Paulo, please.
SPEAKER_04: Okay, which portion? Everything from beginning? Everything. No, no, no, no. About Cobra, you can do it, but I mean, it's up to you, you know, yeah, whatever, yeah. Okay, I'll tell the Russian speaking auditorium real fast about this. Engin priglasil Cobra Rhodes, Cobra, Andrew, iz Amerike na Noyabrskiy, zapad s Vostokom, i on budet borotsya s Turkom. What's the Turkish guy name?
SPEAKER_04: He was three times world champion and they fought in 2000 for the first and second place, then Cobra wanted revenge for this.
SPEAKER_04: 22 years ago, the match that was, yes, they both for 50 already and both did not train, but now they have 4 months to prepare, so it will be, well, cool, two such legendary dudes. Well, and Engin also says, then already about you, Kody says, well, what to fight with him, look, it's a damn teenager. I understood it. Well...
SPEAKER_03: I don't know. Tell me something bad. No, I'm just kidding.
SPEAKER_04: it's a it's a little bit uh russian allegoriums but i will try to translate it my best so he's saying yeah right he's old and the sand is falling off from him but i will sweep the floor after
SPEAKER_00: Oh, turning back to dirt. Punish him. Punish him. Kody, punish him. See, I told you he's not going to... Yeah, just go on. Yeah, come on. The thing is, it's true. I am getting old and just things are falling off of me. It's true. I have nothing to say. Okay. Tell him that, you know.
SPEAKER_04: He says he's old, he cannot win, and he's asking for mercy from Artem. Hey, tell him I'll take the 50% in effort. He says, yes, I'm getting old, and all sorts of different parts of me are falling off. He's joking about his broken arm. He says it will take you about 50% of the effort.
SPEAKER_00: Kody, say something bad. I'm being provoked. I treat you so well. He's saying, come on, Kody, say something bad. They're trying to provoke me, but you know that I have best intentions to you. Well, I have best intentions to him as well. But when he offered to give me a 50% discount on a training program, how about he just gives me 50% effort in the match?
SPEAKER_04: So that's the only way that you can win Kody? I'll take it, I'll take it.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah. Thank you very much. Again, Paolo is doing a great job. Probably the best translator I have seen on one of these lives. Making sure Artem knows what is being talked about instead of just translating the direct questions. Thank you. I totally agree with you, Sean. I totally agree. Yes, Paolo is... Where have you been, man? Where have you been? I've been around. Paolo. Hey.
SPEAKER_04: I mean, where have you been? Why have you not contacted before? Come on. You never asked. Hey, you should have asked here. Yeah, yeah. Right away. I wish I knew. I wish I knew.
SPEAKER_03: As if I understand something and I'm checking you. Why are you silent? Why are you silent? That's gonna be great, yeah. Everything will be great. What's that? So...
SPEAKER_02: Yep, there is what's today Friday only 15 days only 15 days and yeah 15 days later. We will find out who will oh yeah I was gonna ask you our term. Our term do you have. Something to take care with God again in back of your mind.
SPEAKER_04: something that needs to be straightened you know something that
SPEAKER_03: Something that you would like to happen again, something that needs to be sorted out, who is it after all? I would fight again with Dadikyan. No, I would fight, but there is no delay, it's just a sport interest. I said, I want to fight everyone, absolutely everyone.
SPEAKER_04: he wants to pull everybody and uh with daddy can nothing special but he would like to pull him absolutely but nothing uh except uh you know sportsmanship interest where is daddy from but he's right now living in moscow and training with sibling
SPEAKER_00: From Armenia? Yes. David I compete against him in 2019 at the Worlds? No, no, no, no, no, no. This guy is 100 kilo. He was 100 kilo category in 2019. I just remember there was a really good lefty in Romania from Armenia. And his name was David, but I don't remember his last name.
SPEAKER_02: no this this is also david but this is david that he can you know he's just he was 100 kilo in that event and in 2018 he also was there he beat artom in a youth category oh okay yeah yeah yeah yeah so so uh great answer august 6th you beat in this guy
SPEAKER_04: That's interesting. You say that your chance against
SPEAKER_02: chaffee is higher than cody and you say you're gonna beat cody easy so it means that you will not even feel dave this is what i understand from what you say i'm trying to steal the pot for sure
SPEAKER_02: Sure, yeah, okay. And then in November, straight answer, you're going to beat Hermes as well with left arm after you beat Kody? No, he won't. He won't? Why? Why? Just tell me why. He won't be there. Oh, that's what I wanted to hear. Oh, finally. You understand, right? Or translate? He says, so what, in November, you'll win, how easy. Kody says, no, he won't win, because he won't be there.
SPEAKER_04: but he doesn't need to listen he doesn't need to answer this because cody said that
SPEAKER_04: He will not have this opportunity. Okay. You don't want to hear it? No, no, no. Just tell him this so that it's going to make his answer a little bit more colorful. Okay. He says, well, you shouldn't answer because Kody said you won't be there. But in general, to be honest, it's interesting.
SPEAKER_04: It's a lot of time until November. He will gain a lot if necessary. Everything will be fine. What do you think about Kody's opinion that there will not be such a match?
SPEAKER_02: he said he's with Hermes yeah for sure it's not gonna happen so Kody and Hermes is not gonna happen that's what he said okay i understand i understand yep that that's that's interesting and okay just just just we are imagining you you you you pull of course you're gonna uh you want to
SPEAKER_02: pull and beat Ermes. He wants to pull Ermes and beat him as well. Of course, he wants to beat Kody first. The question is, like, after Zog match, Dadikyan said that he wants to gain weight and he wants to go to super weight. Like, if he still has the title, would he want to see...
SPEAKER_02: like just say that he beat Kody just say that he beat Hermes to to have the awards permanently he needs to win three title matches um just maybe not that again but does he does he have any idea that you know who he wants to pull against uh like finally finally is he ready someone like just say
SPEAKER_02: Levan, if his left arm is ready, not injured.
SPEAKER_04: Okay, well, it's a bit of a difficult question, even if I'm not quite so, well, let me translate it. He says that in order to have this prize, which he has prepared forever, you have to win three times. So, let's say you win against Kody, let's say you win against Hermes later. He started talking about Deccan, if he wins his
SPEAKER_04: And would you like to fight him? Or maybe you think that you would be ready by that time for Lebanon, if the left hand is ready in Lebanon. What do you think about this? First of all, to fight the Dadikyan, then with Lebanon. Because every person has his own individual technique in any case. And it can be inconvenient.
SPEAKER_03: For me, Dadikyan was uncomfortable, so I needed to fight him first, to understand that maybe I still have weaknesses, and then to fight the others, those who are stronger.
SPEAKER_04: So he's saying that, yes, if this will go, this scenario that he's going to win Kody, then he's going to win Hermes, then probably will be logical to pull Daddy Cam first because when he last time pulled Daddy Cam, he was very uncomfortable for him and he wants to know if he's still uncomfortable or Artyom improved that much that it's comfortable now and then he can move up
SPEAKER_02: and pull somebody who is stronger which is maybe even the one I understand I understand and in and you Kody you that doesn't matter for you on the future what do you say Artem
SPEAKER_02: he's saying come on cody is not gonna be there why are you asking this yeah see now it's getting a little bit naturally heated lit little bit naturally heated okay that's good that's good um and you you you in august you beat in cody right uh artem right
SPEAKER_02: like to yes and then you'll be nervous in november that that would be the plan and then who do you think i should pull after that is that what you're asking who are we beating next well
SPEAKER_02: yeah yeah who should we pull and beat and then so that you get those those those things that you saw i send you through whatsapp a little bit of minor changes will be there but then you will have them both of them permanently i i think they will look better on you than art you can translate power
SPEAKER_04: Yes, but Engin jokes, as always, but he says that, well, okay, if you beat Artem now, and then you beat Hermes, the same question, with whom would you like to fight later, to win this prize forever. He says, by the way, I think it will look better on you than on Artem. Well, in my opinion, I ... Waste your beard.
SPEAKER_03: He's saying that Kody said that there is a plan to do that. And that means that Kody is already, you know, not sure 100%. He said, I'm already in your head.
SPEAKER_04: it's true it's true he said that lots of respect lots of respect and uh we know both what why we're doing this and uh he likes you
SPEAKER_02: I feel the same way. Thank you very much and I think he's a good kid with a ton of potential. Yeah, but he also said translate Apollo. He also said that even though he's a good kid, I'm still gonna kick his ass. David you didn't hear the Apollo their parts?
SPEAKER_04: no it's breaking up the internet breaking up okay i'm telling you so that you wouldn't miss it i'm a terrible person terrible terrible
SPEAKER_04: yeah i can see that i will think about next time translation i don't like corruption you know why i immigrate to the united states because i didn't like corruption now i'm getting corrupted again yeah but you know we all are joking including arthur and everyone right yeah yeah i don't know that we're talking right yes i don't know i told him but he knows that cody didn't say that right yeah he knows that what he didn't say okay as long as that's yeah
SPEAKER_02: yeah i am playing the bad cup that cup so they can be good guys i'm the bad guy it's okay no problem you know anyway so we are we are about something not said yeah yeah we are about to finish yeah yeah cody we are closing would you like to say anything uh um well i i
SPEAKER_00: to your question about who i'd like to pull in the future i mean i don't have a lot of years left doing this i am getting older i don't know how much longer i don't know if i can do a john brazink and do this when i'm 60 years old um but i i've always wanted to know if i'm good enough like if i'm good enough to be the guy and uh
SPEAKER_00: So I would like to pull the people that are the best and to see if I can compete with them, to hang with them, because I've always felt like I've had the ability and I just want to know if I can. So really, whoever you line up next, if I get lucky enough to be in that situation, I will take whoever. I would like it to be who you think could be an opportunity for me to see if I am the best at what I feel like I can do.
SPEAKER_00: so yeah and i'm really excited about this match yeah from what i understand that you are saying that i mean uh like can i say that you are in one of your best ever shapes right now i feel like i'm still having a couple issues with my forearm but it's getting better every day i'm stronger than i've ever been but those couple issues have been bothering me a little bit but not near how they were um
SPEAKER_02: but I think that I'm just going to get better and better and better over the next little bit. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, but you are saying that while you are, yeah, just a few words, I will just say, so you are saying that like, while you can still pull, you want to see yourself where you are at, at the world stage. Yes. You don't want to be, you don't want to be limited to United States in the professional armistice.
SPEAKER_00: you want to see where you are internationally and yeah so that is you did you are thinking that this is a good opportunity to see where you are at yeah i i want i want to know if i can compete with the artems with the lavons with the vitalis with the salias i want to know if i'm good enough that's that's what i'm saying
SPEAKER_04: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: I will be lucky enough to win these two fights with you and Ermes. I will leave it to you, Engin, to decide who you think I would fight next. Of course, I would like to see and know where I am, for example, in comparison with Vitalik Laletin or Dima Silaev. It's all very interesting for me, so yes, decide. And I will be happy to fight on the international arena, not only in the United States.
SPEAKER_03: And does he have anything to say? Generally, about this and generally, before we close, does he want to say things before we close? Dasha, what do you want to say? Because we are about to close. What do you want to say about this and in general, if you want to say something? Well, first of all, as always, a huge thank you to Engin for organizing this event.
SPEAKER_03: something incredible in fact, because so many strong athletes and celebrities meet in one place and you can talk and fight. Well, I want to wish Kody good luck so that he comes up without injuries and we fight and find out who is stronger of the two of us. And what will happen in the future,
SPEAKER_03: We don't decide what will happen here, we just contribute to it, we will wait to fight. Thank you.
SPEAKER_04: First of all, Engin, thank you very much for so incredible event where everybody, top pullers in the world can meet, can pull and find out who is better. And thank you very much. So second of all, good luck, Kody. And he hope that you will step up to the table strong and injury-free, the most important.
SPEAKER_04: and uh about the future pooling and future events it's uh uh it's not that we can talk about right now probably but it's gonna be uh it's gonna be as it's gonna be because after after the match we will know who is who's better yeah and i also would like to thank to uh my sponsor a sponsor for the east versus west also
