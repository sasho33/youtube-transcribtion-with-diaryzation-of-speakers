SPEAKER_01: Hello everyone. Good to see you, Abdurrahman. Hello, Paul. Hello, my friends. Soon they will come.
SPEAKER_01: I think Roman came. Hello, Roman. Hi, Engin. How are you doing? How are you, my friend? It's good to see you. Good to see you too. I'm doing fine. Thank you. Good day. Hello, GM150. Latest injury.
SPEAKER_01: I'm not sure how, what is exactly happening. I think he needs to tell to people. Hello, Google. Hello to Georgia. Hello, Richard. Hello. Not my monkeys, not my circus. Okay. So I think so. Um,
SPEAKER_01: He's reading there. He's asking, Pony's asking you East versus West animation. Yes, yes. I noticed. I will try to find it in my computer. People liked it. Where is it? İsa. Valla çok fazla yorum yapacak bir şey yok kardeşim. Levan yani açık ara fazlaydı yani. Bir de hastaydı.
SPEAKER_01: Ali, who is Engin's next opponent? I'm training first. I need to train, train, train. Today I trained. It was big training. Less pain, less influence. Hello, Bozhidar. How are you, boys? I'm fine. How are you? Good. Good to see you, my friend. It's very nice to be with you again.
SPEAKER_01: So you come in to the seminar as well, right? On 30th or something, July. Yes, yes. It will be great to spend time with you. Yeah, it's very good opportunity. Yeah. Ah, yeah, it's just... I hope I will be able to keep myself from pulling. No, no, no, no, no. Joking. Yeah, you need to rest good for Samushia. That is an unfinished business. Yeah, for sure. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: that that um i don't know that that event was legendary that 80 kilo 2019 it's just like today i watched it like two times or three times and i was like wow wow but the one thing i need to say like again we said many times but hamza was the really start of the event he took third place there but he was just like yeah for sure he he deserved
SPEAKER_01: to pull with you more than a minute and then pulling with the, what was the other guy's name from Kazakhstan? Yes, I thought about him as well, but I forgot his name. Yeah, he also, then Samushia, like three matches in a row, he pulled incredible, yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: You are 85 kilo, huh? As you said yesterday. About, yes. That match, I'm not going to criticize the community, but for me, your match with Samushia, when you look at it technically, even better matchup than Devon versus Levan.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, forget about the names, forget about the size and everything. Just say that you are a fan. Which match would you prefer to watch from the technical perspective? I'm not asking about the size of the athletes, the name of the athletes. I mean, we're going to see there most likely an incredible hook work. Yeah, for sure.
SPEAKER_01: I really hope that this time I will do better, even better. Like even if I lose, I hope to do much better than the last time. You know, people also don't understand how serious this match is because they saw Samushia losing to Pauline. First of all, Pauline is an incredibly strong athlete. The way that he beat Rambat, the way that he gave that tough match to John.
SPEAKER_01: You know, John says that, you know, the guy you saw in Hook, John was shaking. John won that match, but he really pushed the limits of John. And also, you need to realize that Paul didn't make 100 kilos easy. Paul was about 100 kilos. He made 100 kilos. You understand what I mean? He made 100, but I'm guessing that he was like easily 102 kilos or something, you know, the competition time, while Samushia was 87 kilos.
SPEAKER_01: so i'm just saying that i'm not taking anything away from pauline because the match is set in there you know paul won very deserving he was the stronger better man but i'm just trying to point that for his weight samusha is incredible guy yeah he gave him a great war yes yes yeah imagine that you know this guy i mean for around 85 kilos incredibly strong
SPEAKER_01: and people knows you more than they know samusha i'm talking about generally community so um what i try to say that you realize how strong strong your opponent is even when you talk now you said that even if i lose so you're going to match
SPEAKER_01: Of course, you're going there to win. And of course, your chance is good. But you are still on your backside of your mind that there is a possibility that he may win too. From outside look, I see a 50-50 match. So I'm just trying to point out how serious your opponent is in fact. Yeah, for sure. It's the most serious and probably the strongest opponent I'm facing. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So I don't know. Hello. Hello, hello. David, can you turn the phone sideways, please? Yeah, thank you. So just can you tell to David, Roman, like the things that we are talking about?
SPEAKER_01: because he didn't listen, he was not there. Roman, we don't hear you. You need to turn. Roman, you need to, yeah. You need to push. We don't hear you. Can you hear me now? Now, yes. Yeah. So, David, . Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: that's better right yes yes can you can you can you uh explain to him the things that we talk you know before he came so that we can just continue uh talking yeah so can you briefly tell me what exactly to tell him like about this you didn't hear what we were talking with
SPEAKER_01: i was i heard but you were talking quite quite a bunch so i will translate all of them if you want okay just briefly like okay just maybe maybe i tell him that uh like i maybe i'm mistaken but like this is what i heard uh was david 87 kilo when he pulled uh paul yeah
SPEAKER_00: Between 87 and 88 maximum.
SPEAKER_00: So during this time, he was almost 90 kg. But before he arrived there at this time, and also this movement traveling and stuff, he decreased like 2 kg or something. So he was between 87 and 88 maximum. I have a question for him.
SPEAKER_01: Whenever I set the match, mostly I communicated with Zurab Tavberidze for Pauline and Samushia match. Zurab had so much confidence in David that normally we were going to set this match with 95 kilo limit. Also, Zurab told me that
SPEAKER_01: it is going to be like, now it is going to be around 94 kilo by the time of the competition, but he ended up 87, 88 kilo. So can you ask him, does he regret that that match is not set 95 kilo but 100 kilo?
SPEAKER_00: Okay. Nanu, this is a very important question. I would like to ask you, and I would also like to ask Tsona, because I think Nanu would agree with you, that it is not easy to live in London. It is very difficult to live there. I would like to ask you, Nanu, and I would also like to ask Tsona.
SPEAKER_03: Yes, that's right. It's the same for all of us. It's not possible physically. We have a limit of 10 km. It's not possible physically. It's not possible physically. It's not possible physically. In these periods, the maximum weight you can lift is 90 kg. It's not possible physically.
SPEAKER_00: so technically it would not make any difference because it was his physical limit by this time he could not gain any more weight so even if it had been like uh around let's say limit would be 100 kg it would not make any difference no no no that's not what i'm asking no no there's no what i'm asking pauline won the match but he was 100 kilo
SPEAKER_00: If it was 95, I thought that you would understand what I'm trying to say. Yeah, now I understand. Sorry.
SPEAKER_00: David he underestimate his opponents? There are no facts.
SPEAKER_03: It is true that we had a lot of problems, but we didn't have to deal with it. It is true that we had a lot of problems but we didn't have to deal with it.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, he has nothing else to say just to admit and say that Pauline was really stronger guy that day and it will not make any difference if Pauline was lighter weight that day. So he really don't want to say anything so that it would count as an excuse. He just says that Pauline beat him fair and square.
SPEAKER_01: and uh he was really stronger stronger guy yeah yeah yeah yeah of course that's not my point my point was that you know like weight yeah whenever whenever zurab said that he's just too strong you understand and then like it sounded like you know like whenever i said maybe we make the weight limit 100 kilo drop we better do it you know otherwise it's gonna be like so paul was like was paul better than what he expected
SPEAKER_03: Was it the same for everyone and was it the same for the rest of the population? I don't know. I think it was the same for everyone, but I don't know if it was the same for the rest of the population.
SPEAKER_03: It was hard for me to understand how these people were. It was hard for me to understand how these people were. It was hard for me to understand how these people were. It was hard for me to understand how these people were.
SPEAKER_00: He keeps saying that he was a really stronger guy. He could also say that basically he could be even stronger than he anticipated him. But he doesn't want to say anything else, just considering how strong he was himself, prepared for that match, and then Paulin beat him like that. He assumes that Paulin was really strong. Yeah, very strong guy. People underestimate him. I'm not talking about David, but some people are just thinking that that guy
SPEAKER_01: I mean, because his name is not that big now. People are thinking, but yeah, Pauline is a very strong guy. And Bozhidar, how do you see your chances against David? And like, where do you think that you are now? And where do you think that you will be? Do you think that you will be at your absolute best on August 6th?
SPEAKER_02: Yes, for sure. I will give my best to be at my absolute best, you know, because like I, this is probably the most serious match for the past few years. Yeah. I really hope like, uh, I've never lost a competition or in Turkey. So I hope this will not end this time in five weeks. Yeah. I will continue my win strike there. So,
SPEAKER_01: I will be probably in my best shape, but I expect the same from David. So this is the most serious match I will be facing for the past two years. I understand. I understand. Yeah. And do you expect a very close match? Yes, for sure. Do you think either of you can dominate the other one right from the fresh round? For me, there will be two ways. It will be
SPEAKER_01: very long match or one of us will win easy like do you think that there is a possibility like that do you really believe that there is a possibility either we can dominate each other yes i i really don't see that that thing like i'm i'm seeing like neither of you are like really flash pinners i mean you may be a flash spinner but if the guy is top rolling but like in the hook i see that i mean like you are one of the best hook but do you realize with how many guys
SPEAKER_01: you are just having long matches. I mean, you sometimes dominate people, but I can see that, like, I can show you five, six guys that, I mean, you had a, you know, match. And it's near impossible to flash you in hook. I don't remember anyone is doing that. So what I just tried to say that, do you really believe that, like, either of you can flash? Seriously, that was surprising to me to hear that from you. No, you may be right. You may be right, but it was surprising to me.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, if we go in deep hook, probably it will be such a long match and the better chances are on David. That's what I believe. So probably I really hope it will not end up in a deep hook. That's all I can say. But you are also known with incredible endurance. Yeah, but we both are. So this is like maybe in the last rounds.
SPEAKER_01: This could be also like a going flip. I understand. And you please let me translate that part. No, no, no. Evgeny when David lose, like with top roll or something, or somebody top rolls, he still gives incredible match with that way. You know, I remember him with Viorel. I remember him with, what was the Russian guy? Russian guy, David.
SPEAKER_01: Can you ask David who was the... I forgot his name. In the European Championship final, he toppled him and he fought this way and won. David won. David, do you remember when you won the European Championship in Russia? The Russian one? Yes, I remember.
SPEAKER_01: yeah yeah yeah so what i'm just saying that i mean it is very very hard to flash him you know so i'm just saying that you said if the match goes longer you give the ash to him don't set your mind like that i said in deep oh yeah yeah yeah i understand that point that's right that's right yeah so just ask him roman uh like
SPEAKER_01: Like he thinks that, you know, he sees that it's even possible either of them to flash each other. Does David expect such thing, a flash pin? Like for me, I just don't see. Both have incredible defense strength, incredible. And neither of them known with the flash pinners. So, I mean, I see that match is stopping somewhere and taking a long time. But how does David see this match?
SPEAKER_00: And I would like to ask you, Mr. Bosni, to talk about this, and I would like to ask you, what made you think that the two of us would be able to do it? Because I think it was a genius idea.
SPEAKER_03: I would like to say that Bozhidar is the national champion of the national team in the national team. He is a very good athlete.
SPEAKER_03: I think it is a very important responsibility. I mean, I think it will not be possible for Adul and Omarchuk to be together. I think it will not be possible. I think it will be possible to talk to each other, and it will be possible to be very close. It will be possible. I think it will be possible for both of us to be together.
SPEAKER_00: So he started saying how good Bozhidar is. To him, under 85 kg, he's number one worldwide, no doubts. And for him, it will be kind of unexpected if either of those guys will flashpick each other.
SPEAKER_00: and he expects the war, he expects a very sightful match, like deep in hook possibly, but like long matches, really both of them to fight, you know, so no flash pinging. He doesn't believe that could happen. Yeah, I agree with you. But it's good to say, like, it's for me, it's 50-50, like from this perspective, I look up to it, like it's not like underestimating, but like,
SPEAKER_01: more motivating, like to prepare better because I don't like to lose such a match fast, you know? I mean, I can give you a guarantee you are not going to lose so fast and he's not going to lose so fast. I think we will see a war there, a war that like, and I like when, when the athletes, I mean like, or the fans from UFC boxing, you know, they understand from the quality,
SPEAKER_01: That is why people like McGregor, Habib, Mayweather, these guys are very famous and they make the most money. That is because those fans come to that level and they don't really look at who's the biggest guy. You understand? Who has the biggest muscle or something, you know? So I think that with time, armwrestling fans will come to a point that they will more care about the quality. You understand?
SPEAKER_01: and then then then the size so that that is like guy says okay lebanon is so dominant i lost my interest in arm wrestling i mean the super heavyweight category is not the the only category in arm wrestling so why would you lose i mean your interest you know in arm wrestling just because some what's happening in the super heavyweight you know like for me when i go to the world championships
SPEAKER_01: mostly the categories I watch 70, 75, 80, 85, 90 kilo. These five categories, I'm the most care. Of course, I watch lighter and heavier too, but this, I don't even blink my eye between 70 and 90 kilo because I don't care about how big the guy is. It's just like the least important thing for me. I look at how smart the guys, how fast they are, how well-rounded, how technical.
SPEAKER_01: how smooth in the transition and everything. So it's incredible quality. You can translate to David what I say, Roman. Yes, I would like to, but then maybe... Okay, if you allow me, yes.
SPEAKER_00: I will translate, meanwhile, you speak. So, David, .
SPEAKER_00: and that's how CloudJet was born. My idea was to write a commentary on the fact that I wanted to find out what kind of people were interested in CloudJet, and my idea was to ask people to think about it. There is no such thing as a super heavyweight, I don't think so. I think it's very big.
SPEAKER_01: OK. You can carry on. Yeah. So do you, any of you, can you ask David if he is expecting anything different from Bozhidar than just
SPEAKER_00: Then Deep Hook. David, I would like to ask you, from your point of view, from your position, what is the most important thing in your opinion? Is it that Deep Hook is the most important thing for you?
SPEAKER_03: There is no doubt that he is a very talented sportsman. He is a very talented sportsman. He is a very talented sportsman. He is a very talented sportsman. He is a very talented sportsman. He is a very talented sportsman. He is a very talented sportsman. He is a very talented sportsman. He is a very talented sportsman. He is a very talented sportsman.
SPEAKER_00: Yes, I gave you. He's saying that he doesn't have anything like specific one to be ready for it because he's such a well-rounded guy and such an elite level guy that he must be ready for anything. And he goes in this match with this mentality that he will be ready for anything because he is so smart, maybe in one moment he will change something else. So he needs to be prepared for anything, basically what Borussia Dortmund could bring to the table.
SPEAKER_01: Not only just deep hook. I understand. Yeah, I understand. Yeah. And have you ever seen David doing anything different than just playing risker and pinning? Dave you ever seen David tap rolling, Bozhidar? Not really, at least in our category. But also, his back pressure is very good. So I could expect something from him. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: but like i don't think i'm very famous for my strong top row so but the way david is handling the top rollers as well like without the strap i mean when he's in good shape like i don't believe it will be such a good idea to go anywhere else except the hook the question is um david you asked me yesterday when you and i are gonna pull
SPEAKER_00: Would you wish such thing to happen?
SPEAKER_03: It's just impossible to say no for such a pleasure to have a match with you. So obviously he's down to match with you.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah, I would also would like to, but does he think that I could give him some challenge? It's a big question, but I think it's a good question. I think it's a good question, but I think it's a good question.
SPEAKER_03: and I think that we will have to wait for the year 2050. I think it will be interesting to see how many years we have, how many years I will live, and so on. I think it will be very interesting to see. I think that we will have to wait for the year 2050.
SPEAKER_03: He's saying that regardless of your age,
SPEAKER_00: Basically, you are in good shape all the time and he would neither underestimate you nor would say that you are really above him. He would say it would be a 50-50 match. Then he brought up this example of you beating, actually beating Makaro. It was only the injury that stopped you finishing what you started. The thing is that he would say that, yeah, sure. It would be a good match, yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So maybe, maybe, maybe I pulled the winner of this match. Yeah. See now it looks like Bozhidar is like extra motivated. Okay. Now it will be a test of the hand control. David has incredibly strong cup. Incredible. I remember before, before he started going upper weight class,
SPEAKER_01: Whenever I see him with Irakli at the side table, he always was able to hook in Irakli even without the strap. Yeah, so his wrist incredibly strong. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Anyways, I'm expecting, I'm gonna take my chips
SPEAKER_01: an iced tea and i will be watching their match for like half an hour cook match yeah there is one guy is asking where has bojidar been the past year i mean if you are talking about like the help of this year he competed the european championships and he won
SPEAKER_01: And if you're asking about 2021, he has been everywhere. He has won, he has won a super match against the Kazakh guy. And then he has won two of those top 78 kilo, uh, events, eight men event. And then you went to, uh, European championship. No, not the European. You went to arm wars and you beat in the east versus west one, you beat him right. And then you won the world championships.
SPEAKER_01: and also you went to europeans too yeah but i mean wow you were like i mean you competed countless events and all of them were like world level events but this year you are kind of a little bit slower but it's up to the offer if i would invite you you would have been there here already but yeah yeah only at the world center yes we just took competitions for this year yes yes yes yes so
SPEAKER_01: you're gonna you're gonna pull with david for the title and the question to both of you i want to start from david who else is the like does he think that has chance to pull see this is 80 kilo east versus west international title match but because they both agreed we made it 85 kilo so just say that david won this match and the russian band
SPEAKER_00: David, I would like to ask you, this is not the case that the weight was at 40 kilos, as it was in the past, but when they put it in the futon, it was at 45 kilos.
SPEAKER_00: And if you want, you can go to the border with Bosnia-Herzegovina. And you can go to the border with Russia, and you can go to the border with the other countries. It's only 40 kilometers. You can go to the border with the other countries. Well, I think that in the second part,
SPEAKER_03: As you can see, the megawatt-hours are all in the 40 kg category, right? So, what do you think about this? It's in the SPA category, right? It's the third generation. If it's in the new generation, it's 15,000, right? Think about it, it's the third generation, and it's in the Zlovakian category. What do you think about it? What do you think about these two things? What do you think about them?
SPEAKER_03: Yes, that's right. Yes, that's right.
SPEAKER_00: so uh he he said that uh his plan is to increase his weight to gain weight as of you already know he's been competing at 80 kg but he plans to go heavier and different category and all this depends the match against uh alan would depend on how soon it would take place
SPEAKER_00: But he believes, like he thinks most likely it will be dilated in time. So there is this contradicting two parts. He agrees with Zola, but if it's very soon, if it's not soon enough, basically he wants to gain weight. So then it wouldn't be possible. Okay, I understand. But for the future, he would want to see himself under 90 kilos at the East versus West, not for the 80 is what he's saying.
SPEAKER_03: In your case, you were talking about 40-50 kg, as you said, but it wasn't 40-50 kg. It was 40-50 kg. Yes, it was 40-50 kg, but I think it was 45-55 kg. Yes, it was 45-55 kg, not 40-50 kg. It was 45-55 kg, but it wasn't 45-55 kg, but it was 45-55 kg, but it was 45-55 kg, but it wasn't 45-55 kg, but it wasn't 45-55 kg.
SPEAKER_00: so he's saying that it depends how comfortable he will feel himself but he will now uh not now he doesn't have a correct answer but he would think that he would change uh between uh to 85 or 90. he's not sure yet yeah so but not not 80 he doesn't want to no no so definitely so so and if he wins this match like it's 80 kilo and if if i set a 90 kilo match for the future
SPEAKER_00: East versus West, who would you would he want to pull against under 90 kilo? If Moege is the best, then Moege. And then, let's see, in the category of 50,000 kilometers, who will win? Who will win? Who will win? Let's see. Let's start with Dimitrov.
SPEAKER_01: Simeonov Dimitro would gladly pull him. Yeah. And anyone else like Sasho? Sasho? Or someone else? Haji Murad? Tautia?
SPEAKER_03: It's not my fault that Dimitrov and Flamand Dimitrov have a relationship with me. It's not my fault that Dimitrov and Flamand Dimitrov have a relationship with me. It's not my fault that Dimitrov and Flamand Dimitrov have a relationship with me.
SPEAKER_00: So since we are talking about under 90 kg category, and you mentioned several names there, again, he as an athlete obviously will be preparing for anybody else of those names you mentioned, but he would like to have this. Yeah, I mean, he said that he remarked that Flamme Di Vito has a win against him, so he wants this revenge, you know, like. Oh, Flamme beat him in the past?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, that's what he said. When? 2014. 2014 in Azerbaijan, everywhere. He was 79 kg, but he went up to the limit of 85 kg.
SPEAKER_01: And Bozhidar, you are flexible for both 80 and 85 kilo categories for the title or you wouldn't want to pull 90 kg? Do you think it would be hard for you to like someone like Sasho maybe? Still, I don't believe I can face Sasho in a match. I feel more comfortable between 80 and 85 kilos. For now, I've been staying
SPEAKER_01: at 80 to wait for my match with David, but I'm very glad that we both agreed to go up to 85 now. Yeah. So I would like to try with 85 kg. I don't know. And same question to you. Just say that you won the match and just say that Russian ban is lifted and athletes can compete. And if Alain Zola wanted to pull you, but he said he wants a strict 80 kilo because it's 80 kilo class.
SPEAKER_02: if no agreement so would you would you do that yeah for sure why not like because i know people want to see this match but mostly i would like to face uh tau tf like for me it's more interesting yeah i would i in my personal opinion i would like to pull with him more you know yeah but that would be probably for the 90 kg category not the ad yeah he's above yeah
SPEAKER_01: Because he can make 85, but just say that he won't, he will never make 80 kilo to pull, just say Alain Oleg or anyone else, you understand? So, I mean, so you are saying that maybe you cannot pass Sasho at 90 kilo, but it doesn't mean that you cannot pull the other guys in 90 kilo. Yeah, I'm sure like... If you're open to pull 80 and 90 between them, you can pull in either category. I prefer to pull with like
SPEAKER_02: uh the heavier guys you know like if i'm 85 i wouldn't bother to bother to pull with the heavier guys like for me it's better you know like to try to improve more and more yeah but you also need to defend your title if there is any challenger or lady i mean if you win if you beat david yeah but for sure as well like into let's see what happens this match yeah yeah that's what opportunities come after so
SPEAKER_01: And the question is, who do you think is the, can you ask, Roman, can you ask David, but does he know that Sasho was injured and he didn't pull at 12 last year when Plymouth won? I'm not saying that if Sasho was there, Plymouth couldn't win or something, but who does he think that is the best 90KG in the world, including Zolev, healthy Zolev, Sasho, Plymouth, who does,
SPEAKER_00: Who does he think on his eyes that who is the best best 90 kilo in the world? David, I would like to ask you, you have been in the category of 90 kilo, but I would like to ask you, Samushia, because I have heard that you have been in the category of 90. But I don't know what you would like to say more specifically. I would like to ask you, as the number one in the world, who would you like to be in the category of 90?
SPEAKER_03: He thinks that Zolov is number one in under 90 kg category. So he is saying that like normally he would beat anyone under there. Yeah, but he got injured recently again.
SPEAKER_01: Again? Yeah, this event, like, his elbow again got hurt. Oh, you mean in the Russian event? Yes. Oh, I didn't know that. See, whenever the time is passing, you're getting older. He's only 37, but it's happening, you know. It has been happening to all of us. Yeah, yeah. Very sorry to hear that. And did you guys know that Arsen Ilev is coming back? Yeah, you said it in your
SPEAKER_00: Last podcast. Yeah, I also heard it.
SPEAKER_01: said he was not sure but he was also thinking uh from some rumors you know he has heard some stuff yeah oh he didn't hear from anywhere because i have been talking to me that's right from whatsapp that i try comments he says no you're trying to bring the death from the grave he told me i said i said no no no no you're gonna do it and then i just convinced him some days ago if he heard that from internet maybe that's what he heard but he had no intention at all to come back yeah so
SPEAKER_01: let's let's see thanks to you thanks to you he's coming but i feel like so bad there's some such a great i mean guy 34 years old and he's already i mean retired you know just why you know just when i see that people near 60 years old still kicking ass you know that's that's what i was thinking so i will ask them quickly about their prediction but i will again ask to david as i asked you directly
SPEAKER_01: Whenever, whenever I ask him, will he be answering politically? Like, I mean, I mean, like honestly, you know, because I mean, objective way or because of is because I asked him because there are five Georgian again in the car. So ask him, you know, just, just, just in case.
SPEAKER_00: I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to
SPEAKER_01: okay i guess he's ready okay okay i didn't hear any response from him so this is why i was just um okay i'm asking him what does he think for oleg zog versus david daddy can first uh david
SPEAKER_00: 100 and 2 kg, right? That's what you are saying. Yeah, yeah. David was more than 110, but he's going down to 102 kilo. And I expect to be near 90 kilo. Yeah. Engin, I think you secretly know Georgian. He just asked about kg, and you said it's 102 kg. So yeah, .
SPEAKER_02: Well, he thinks Oleg will be 102 kg, 102 kg. 70 to 30%. Well, I believe that he can win because like the way Talgat was keeping Oleg at the Worlds. Like, of course, Oleg will be in better shape, but I don't know if it will be enough
SPEAKER_02: like to stop Dadikyan because lately he has been kicking us a lot, so. Yeah, yeah, I understand. OK, so what should I ask you first? Egle versus Gabriela, right and left? Well, like for me, it's 50-50, like for Gabi's unfinished business, because last time, as I remember, Egle beat her, so it will be interesting. Yeah, and can you ask to her?
SPEAKER_03: He thinks Egle will be victorious. All the competition he has seen, Egle's competition, his meaning,
SPEAKER_01: we would he he would go with eggless this time 30 70 to 30 30 would be gabriel yeah thanks and and another question versus chance shop by the way chance is in the chat be careful yeah well i don't know it's for me it's like 50 50 because like the rap is like pulling
SPEAKER_02: like, willing to give his pronator, like, every time, you know? So it depends, like, how Chance will play his cards. So for me, it's unpredictable. Like, the last time I saw Zurab, it was, like, in 85 kg. I never see him under 100. So, like, until I see him visually, not on the screen, like, I could give better prediction. Okay. And can you ask him?
SPEAKER_03: Davit, what do you think about Surabhi? I think Surabhi is great. Surabhi is one of the greats of the country. I would say he is one of the greats of the country in terms of category.
SPEAKER_03: It's not as if we're in the middle of a war. We're in the middle of a war. We're in the middle of a war. It's terrible.
SPEAKER_00: He thinks Zurab is in tremendous good form right now. He even said that under 110 kg, he thinks Zurab is the strongest by poor strength. He thinks Zurab is strongest and he knows how well Zurab is preparing and he would think that Zurab will win this time. But how is he strongest when John beat him?
SPEAKER_00: That's a good question, he's saying.
SPEAKER_03: There are many opportunities in other categories, and this is not the case with our students. There are opportunities, right? Yes, there are opportunities for all of us, and I think that in August this year there will be an opportunity for all of us, and we will be able to meet our expectations. There will be many opportunities.
SPEAKER_00: So he's saying that this time was kind of transitional time for Zurab to go to the higher weight class. And when he said by strength number one, he meant by the potentially, because we should give him a time to adapt to this weight, to Zurab. And he believes that this time in August, we will see even stronger version of him than we have ever seen. He will get more used to this weight.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah. What does he think about Dave Chaffee versus Artem Morozov, right, Aram? What does he think about Dave Chaffee versus Artem Morozov, right, Aram? What does he think about Dave Chaffee versus Artem Morozov, right, Aram? What does he think about Dave Chaffee versus Artem Morozov, right, Aram? What does he think about Dave Chaffee versus Artem Morozov, right, Aram? What does he think about Dave Chaffee versus Artem Morozov, right, Aram?
SPEAKER_00: So he said that Chaffee would win, even though last matches we have seen Morozov was like really good form, but he would say 60 to 40% Dave would win this time. And Bozhidar? Like I like both guys, you know, like since Dave beat Dennis in 2013, I think it was, like he became one of my favorite arm wrestlers, but I like both guys.
SPEAKER_02: but I really give this one to Chaffee. I really hope Morozov will be well prepared for this one. Like I want Morozov to win, but like if I'm from realistic point of view, I think Chaffee will take this one. I understand. And what do you think about John Brzenk versus Ongar Beyer? For me, John is the favorite. John is the favorite. And David?
SPEAKER_01: uh and and very very very important match uh prudnik versus patashins prudnik will win that's what david's saying yeah oh david said yeah wow
SPEAKER_01: And how much is this percentage? 80 to 20% for pruning. I'm just curious in which way he is expecting him to beat him. Like, for example, can he even beat him in a hook or he needs to stay away from there?
SPEAKER_03: What do you think will happen and what will happen? Will there be a problem in the future? I don't think there will be a problem because at the beginning of the pandemic, there will be a problem.
SPEAKER_03: It is not surprising that the ZDP members, Mark Nanakhi, Tzina Shejibrebbebi, Prudnik Shejibrebbebi, and then Sayar Toysimitsko and Ekiden Kalpneri, they all agreed that they would agree. And Prudnik Matkhwaro said that he was from the south. Does he agree with that? I think he agrees.
SPEAKER_00: So he's saying that he has seen previous matches from both sides. He also has seen their matches in the past. So he relays on that data and that information. He's saying that
SPEAKER_00: he will not even let Prudnik will not even let the match to go too, too long. You know, just, he will try to pin him as fast as possible, as soon as possible. Then I made sure to understand correctly. Then I asked, I told him that Prudnik, we know he said that he would even go in hook and beat him in hook. And then David said that if Prudnik said that he would do it, then he will do it. So he will win also in hook. That's what he believes. Okay. So anyway,
SPEAKER_02: I think like if Rudny goes like cupping him sideways to isolate his hand, like not to let him to apply his style, like he can direct pin him. You mean without the strap? Yes, without the strap. But if the match goes in strap, like there's a big chance for Hutchings to stop the match. So you are saying that if the match is in the strap, Hutchings has the higher pin?
SPEAKER_01: the bigger chances of winning this one oh okay okay yeah yeah you you you kind of a little bit felt after pull with todd and he was strong right yeah for sure like he let me to do everything i can and like broke me back with this yeah yeah but there was about like 15 kilo difference though yeah yeah anyway so so if we go to do next match do you think that jerry
SPEAKER_02: And Genadi, anything is possible? Or Mujdal? I think Genadi will beat him. Like, will control his hand. I don't know if it will be easy. But I haven't seen Jerry in a while. Like, I don't know how active he has been. Like, I see on social media he's preparing well, but I don't know if it will be enough for Genadi. So just say that he is in his best shape ever.
SPEAKER_02: Still, you say that Genadi is favorite. Yeah, I do believe Genadi is more hungry than Jerry. Yeah. Because Jerry hasn't been given like such opportunity in a while and Genadi is into this. So for me, Genadi will be better because he will be more prepared. And Roman? Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: He thinks that Genadi will take this match, like no chance for Jerry whatsoever. I understand. And while both are here, there is another Georgia versus Bulgaria in the cards. Yeah, Irakli versus Krasimysh. I know when I said this, like now the little bit patriotic feelings will get involved with the opinions, you know. Let's see how it will go.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, my opinion is Krasimir can't afford to lose this one. Yeah. That's all I can say. Yeah, because it's in his own weight class. And then now this time is no excuse. You know, whenever he loses 250, 200 kilo guys, then it's something different than, you know, pulling against someone who is potentially even a little bit lighter than him. So that is like something, it's not an adventure. This time it is just like, like,
SPEAKER_01: Very important. It's time to get the job done now. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Perfectly said, yeah. So is this what you are saying? So you are saying it's not really opinion about prediction. It is just like what he has to do and what it means, that match means. But so you also believe that he's going to win? Yes, like for sure. Like how to believe otherwise, like if we don't support each other.
SPEAKER_01: Sport is different. Objective opinion. Listen, would you bet your competition prize money on Krasimir? Would he bet his on me? He already gambled most of them on the match. We're talking about your confidence in him. I try to understand if it is just like,
SPEAKER_02: teammates sports or is it like uh objective like opinion this is what i tried to uh well i do believe that he will take now this match more serious than he passed matches so for sure i believe he will pull this out like because there's no other way like he needs to win this i understand and roman can you ask him yeah for sure
SPEAKER_03: What do you think about Krasimir and our battle in Iraq? I don't want to say that I want to say that I want to say that I want to say that I want to say that I want to say that I want to say that I want to say that I want to say that I want to say that I want to say that I want to say that I want to say that
SPEAKER_03: We know that it is a very important sport in the form, but it is not the case that it will be possible to compete in different competitions. I think that in 2050-2030 there will be a lot of competitions, a very big competition.
SPEAKER_00: so even even though he wants really bad to iratli to win and he's cheering for iratli obviously he he still thinks it will be 50 50 match as far as he can say so it's like 50 50 match and then he also mentioned how good crossy is especially in this weight class like he is in his category right now so so he said anything can happen
SPEAKER_03: This is a very important piece of information. There is nothing wrong with Barbosa. There is nothing wrong with reality. There are some nuances to it. There is nothing wrong with that piece of information. There is nothing wrong with that piece of information. There is nothing wrong with that piece of information. There is nothing wrong with that piece of information.
SPEAKER_00: So, and he also, for Irakli, he mentioned, Engin, you already know what he said, but he said that how good was he prepared to Barbosa, different from Todd Hutchings. Todd Hutchings match, Irakli could not perform well.
SPEAKER_01: But he exploited his mistakes for Barbosa match and he performed quite well optimally. So he expects something the same, very good form of Irakli against Krasimir. But still 50-50, he remains like this. Yeah, I also see the same thing. I see that, I mean, you can, if you are in the same way with Krasimir, you cannot underestimate him. I mean, that's for sure. But it doesn't mean that Irakli cannot win. I mean, right now, as of now, Irakli looks, I mean, good, very good.
SPEAKER_01: but we will not see like 150 kilo World Super Heavyweight Champion against Krasimir. We will see somewhere like 100 kilo guy, you know? So that is, that's why it will be very, very good match in my opinion. And so what else did we have? Like, what do you think about Lachlan versus Sandris? Should I ask David first?
SPEAKER_02: Well, I think Sandris will pull this off. It's possible to be a very good war, but for me, Sandris, it's like he has more weapons in his arsenal, so he has better chances if the match goes in a war, and even if Black One takes one or two rounds, he can still
SPEAKER_00: pull something from his sleeve and to win this. I understand. Does David know who Lachlan is? Unfortunately he is not aware of how good a sportsman Lachlan is.
SPEAKER_01: By the name, he cannot remember who that guy is. Maybe he has seen... You know, Sandris is the guy that he did the, I think, semi-final match at the Zloty, when he took third place. The Latvian guy. No, he was talking about Lachlan. Lachlan is... Sandris... Obviously, he knows Sandris, but not Lachlan. I thought he didn't know either of them. Okay.
SPEAKER_01: okay yeah so and and and the other georgian yesterday i was talking with revas last time i talked with him he said like he was 40 percent and then he sent me a video training video and he said 60 percent so yeah so it is like whenever like i like the shape that he i saw him like and then like much greater shape of derek smith yeah like we will see now like
SPEAKER_01: how do you think uh bojidar whenever but just remember this way whenever uh revas tried to top roll uh michael i mean round one i'm talking he couldn't do anything like all like his chance was with the you know this like whenever you remember the round one yes yes michael just hold him and just like wait it wait it wait it so uh what i'm just saying like revas is known with the top roll and like the question is if revas cannot top roll direct
SPEAKER_01: Can he be same effective against Derek that way? You know, Derek wasn't in great shape. That's true. Only like two weeks to two, three weeks to get ready because, you know, the Ongar way of doing comments, I had to do some changes with the card. So, what do you think about this? Yeah, for me, Ravas will be a lot dominant like on this match. I do believe because like
SPEAKER_02: For me, this match with Michael, he got adapted to the atmosphere and everything, coming back onto the table because he also wasn't so active for the past years. And when I hear Rivas, what pops into my mind is his match with Levan, their last match. So if he says he can bring such shape,
SPEAKER_02: For me, he will be more dominant if he claims that he's improving more and more with time. The question is, what do you think about Derek's win against Tim Breslin? Dave you seen that match? Yes, yes. What do you think about that? Yeah, it was quite impressive. But anyway. You are saying that's not enough? Yeah, for sure. I do believe that Rabas could do it easier.
SPEAKER_01: uh and and david probably will not say anything different than this but can you ask him yeah yeah can you ask him if if you know whenever i had the i had the interview with revas he said that in the past
SPEAKER_01: it was levan's dream to beat brevas and now he said that levan is now so good and reva said that right now it is my dream to beat levan can you ask him like is there any possibility potential that he sees with brevas in the future to beat levan is there any does he see that potential with him
SPEAKER_00: Yes, it is clear that the relationship between Revaz and Lewan is very important, and if Lewan was not there, Lewan would have known that Revaz would not be there. Revaz would not have known, if Revaz was not there. What do you think, how does Revaz have the potential to do something that would make Lewan want to go to Revaz? I would like to know.
SPEAKER_03: I think that this is a very realistic idea, that competition can be achieved, and that there is a lot of work to be done in Lebanon. Anatomy has a lot of implications in Lebanon. I think there is a lot of work to be done in Lebanon.
SPEAKER_03: There is a lot of resources that can be used to create a new environment. I don't know if it's possible to do that.
SPEAKER_03: So he really thinks that there is a chance at some point in future for Revaz
SPEAKER_00: It obviously depends how well prepared Revaz will be and how better shape he will be, but as of potential, exactly what was your question, he sees that potential for him, Revaz, at some point to be, it's very realistic prediction to call that Revaz will be able to handle Levan's
SPEAKER_01: hand recent stuff in future but it all really it will be take some time it depends how much price he pays this is what he's saying yeah in time he has that built he has that potential he's not anywhere close but if he really believes and does everything he you know necessary and he says that there is a possibility exactly what do you think about this buddha yes i think the same like
SPEAKER_02: The build of Revaz, it's like the closest potentially beating Levan. Right now, for me, it's not possible right now. Because as we saw the last match of Levan, like everything, even the slight chance of we were expecting for Devon to do something, like Levan just didn't give it a chance. What do you think about that match?
SPEAKER_02: Like, I don't know, like, if Devon got injured really the second round. Maybe that's after the third round he was going only, like, for insight, relying more on the joints, like, to make the stop. Or he realized the Kings move will not work. But Levon was playing by his rules from the beginning. He was patient with Devon, letting him do this stuff.
SPEAKER_01: And he was feeling quite confident and calm doing all this. So we really saw a very big improvement. Do you see anyone or who is potentially the match for Levan as of now? I don't see anyone who can give him a big fight. Don't you think that the last show, the Slayer, not at all? I don't know.
SPEAKER_01: we can't say like in what shape it's quality right now i understand but the same letting still beat to rubin like nothing well i don't believe that so i feel has the side pressure to end the one like problem ending is not problem i'm talking about like to be a challenge you know because the guy just dominates everyone and so like even he may not have the enough pressure to finish him but
SPEAKER_02: someone who can give him some challenge i don't know anyone really like no one pops up in my mind like i like i really tried he cannot even like for 10 seconds stop for me it's too much for the one right now it's too much time for him or like he has been proving and in your opinion who is the number two right now in the world just open it
SPEAKER_02: in my eyes like still Dave Chaffee even like he lost to Genadi like I do believe he could have done better like in the first rounds he proved he's stronger but that's not like the Vendetta only one round or two rounds like the win went to Genadi but I still believe like Dave Chaffee or Revaz right now Revaz? Yes I
SPEAKER_01: the belief right now. Because you are saying that he probably improved because he was inactive for years. For years he was inactive. And you are saying that if two, three months he went that far. So you say that last three months he's probably even better now. That's what you are thinking. For sure he leveled up. And can you ask the same question, David, that, you know, before we close, like what does he think that, who does he think that is the closest man to Levan right now?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah. If he was an organizer, and if he had to set a match for Lewan to make sure that to excite the community, who would that person be? Okay.
SPEAKER_00: David, you said that you don't know how to organize events, and you don't know how to organize events, and you don't know how to organize events, and you don't know how to organize events, and you don't know how to organize events, and you don't know how to organize events, and you don't know how to organize events, and you don't know how to organize events, and you don't know how to organize events,
SPEAKER_03: Larratt was one of them. After all that, it was clear that the people of Saginashvili were all interested in Khivandli. One of them was Lalitin's son, Lalitin, I think. What do you think about the Georgians and what do you think about their relationship with Canada?
SPEAKER_03: He's saying that maybe
SPEAKER_00: italy could have done something against him right now but basically uh as as the match to be a winner obviously lebanon will take everyone he doesn't want to say this like like that's it and uh it's gonna be a very outrageous to say maybe for some people but he's saying that it's the truth and um some some type of um hard matches could have been potentially against canadi and revas as well for lebanon but uh
SPEAKER_01: but at the slightest so basically he thinks that uh today there's no one to like challenge level last two matches i'm gonna ask you watch the corey miller versus yanis uh yes and do you think that we say like you know how how quick the guy starts and do you think that do you think that um with a good start he can give like
SPEAKER_02: hard time to Daniel? I think he can take the first round but Daniel will adapt and like he will be ready next time so it's only like for me Corey has only one like very good weapon and Daniel has full arsenal so I believe Daniel I think that Corey will start good but he will run out of gas yeah it's very possible like
SPEAKER_02: We saw how, but Yanis is very good tactician, you know, and he readapted. I don't know if he even underestimated him the first round, but maybe Yanis would never do such a thing. So Gori was just too fast and too good the first round. Can you ask David, like, what does he think about? Does he know Kody Merritt? Kody Merritt? Okay. Kody Merritt, it's not true. It's not true that Kody Merritt is here.
SPEAKER_02: No, unfortunately not. So that's why I didn't want to ask. And what do you think about Kody Merritt versus Morozov Bozhidar? I think first, Kody is the nicest guy in our sport. I met him in 2019 when he became a world champion. With left arm, he's amazing. Or he used to be because I don't know. I haven't seen a recent match of him.
SPEAKER_02: And it will be a great opportunity for Morozov to face him. And who is winning that? I don't know. I can't say for sure about this match. Yeah, so you very seldom said your opinion. It's just that it's a great card and all the great arm wrestlers, I can't give a proper opinion. And the most important match?
SPEAKER_02: Coach Ray versus Ryan Bowen. Who's winning there? What do you think? Probably, I don't know. I will ask David. Maybe Coach Ray because he wants his channel to grow bigger than Ryan's.
SPEAKER_00: I think it was bigger, but then at this last event, KOTT event, then it changed, switched the sides. Ask David if he knows them. David, Tuitzi, Koutrey, Raimonds Leibniz, and Raimonds Amatatsa are the ones who participated in this event. Thank you very much. Do you want to say something? Yes, of course.
SPEAKER_03: Yes, we have heard of them. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so.
SPEAKER_00: so he has uh heard of them both of their names uh but uh he has not seen that much of their arm wrestling actually to predict so in this case he would say just 50 50. okay then one guy before i close says edgar allerman what was in levan's iv anyway that magically made him better in 24 hours my friend i i talked with levan uh privately all the time he said
SPEAKER_01: He probably got a virus or something day before. I mean, he said that he was fine when he left Georgia. He's thinking that maybe on the way while he's traveling. But he's not sure. He said that maybe in the air conditioner in the room, whatever. But he said that day before, he couldn't even move. He's thinking that some kind of virus or something.
SPEAKER_01: And you are asking what was in the Levan's, the intravascular thing, you know? Probably he doesn't even know because they came from the Dubai hospital. Doctors came and then gave him, and I asked him, Levan, like, how much were you? He said, not even 90% when he pulled down. This is what he told me. He didn't say anyone this openly, but privately, maybe I shouldn't even say this, but he said that,
SPEAKER_01: day before he couldn't even move. But he told me that he was fine after I asked him, you know, are you okay? He said, I'm fine. But only two, three days ago when I talked with him, he said he wasn't even 90%. This is what he told me. Anyway, so thank you very, very much. And just bring best of you to Istanbul. And with the go,
SPEAKER_01: I want to just you guys to hit bone to bone. I'm sure Bozhidar doesn't want to go there. He wants maybe not that big pool, but we will see. I wish you both the best. And thank you for being my guest. And thanks to everyone who followed us. And if you want, you can say your last words, Bozhidar. Like you should make Ryan and coach match like influencers title match.
SPEAKER_01: What title? Influencer's title match. Influencer. Influencer. Yeah. So there should be a title. Okay. That's good. Can you translate what I said to David before we close? Roman? You hear me, Roman?
SPEAKER_01: Oh, do I have a problem with Wi-Fi? I think I do. Yeah, you are frozen, I think. Ah, so are the others. There are such nice guys. Yes, they are very, very nice outside of the table. But once ReadyGo comes, they are not that nice. Trust me. They hurt. Anyways, yeah, you can translate now.
SPEAKER_00: Anu, thank you for coming to this show. And thank you very much for the opportunity to talk to you. It was a pleasure to meet you. It was a pleasure to meet you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
SPEAKER_00: He's also very thankful that you gave him a chance to compete at this level and to perform his best and gave him a chance to prove his armwrestling skills. And also thanks for the invitation of this show. And he's saying that you are a legend, what you are doing. And he's also thankful for that. Yeah, yeah. I thank him. Just tell him that Bozhidar is already here. So tell him that in my eyes,
SPEAKER_01: All those guys that I invite for heavier weight classes and Bozhidar, David, no difference. These guys are superstars as well, but our community right now is not there yet to just care about lighter weights as much as the heavier guys. But on my eyes, you may say that, if it is like that, why don't you set more matches? I'm setting, but I also need to give people
SPEAKER_01: what they want to see since they are financing this event. So I'm still trying to put lighter weight matches. I will be putting more because I want community to know these guys, how good these guys are. So with time, I think we will be doing more and more and more. All I care is just like these guys to get what they deserve. That's all I care, you know.
SPEAKER_00: I will translate, OK? OK. So I will translate, OK? OK. So I will translate, OK? So I will translate, OK? So I will translate, OK? So I will translate, OK?
SPEAKER_00: Two more questions I answer from here. One guy said, if Tobias is competing, Tobias, I offer the match.
SPEAKER_01: And, but his, his, his trainer said that they need to a little bit train more. And, and the question, if, if Hamza Zipak, I, I would invite, I have been inviting Hamza Zipak many times. As of now, he's not training. He's not arm-wrestling. I don't know why. Before I close, David, what do you think about Hamza Zipak? David, Hamza Zipak said us before.
SPEAKER_03: In 2005, when I won the European Championship, I was very happy and I was very happy that I was able to participate in this project. And I think that this is one of the most important sportsmen in the world.
SPEAKER_03: It was a new experience for us. Because of the pandemic, we didn't have a chance to participate in the 2015 World Cup. It was a great experience for us. We had a chance to participate in the 2015 World Cup.
SPEAKER_00: So he's saying that he's very good because of the last time they met officially, it was 2019 Worlds and there he performed as good as me and Bojda did. So he's saying that he is one of the top elite middleweight category guy. Unfortunately, because of COVID and restrictions and stuff, he could not perform.
SPEAKER_01: in futures events but last time we saw was in 2019 and he's right there with us like he stopped yes yes yes yes yes anyways thank you very very much thank you for being our guest david thank you very much my friend i will see you guys in istanbul and you guys will rock thank you it was nice to see you thank you guys for watching us thank you guys thank you bye bye thank you roman for all translation my friend anytime my friend thank you
