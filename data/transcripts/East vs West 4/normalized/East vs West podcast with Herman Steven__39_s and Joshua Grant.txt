SPEAKER_01: Hello, Herman. Hey, can you hear me again? Yeah, I hear you well. Okay. How are you? Are we live? Yeah, we are. No, your answer is going to depend, huh? Well, no. I mean, some of these things people want to hear. So, you know, I'd rather just do it live than a private conversation. I understand. It's easy. Yeah. Yeah. Man, I feel good, Engen. I think I figured out my elbow problem.
SPEAKER_01: And, uh, over the last couple of weeks, my elbow is night and day. Um, I went from pain in any position, like palm up or defensive, you know, Jonathan and I would only kind of arm wrestle in the center of the table. Now I can arm wrestle everywhere and, uh, I feel really strong. So I'm pretty excited. So, but, uh, just because you are strong, you are healthy. Uh, does it mean that like you trained enough?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, well, Jonathan and I, we're arm wrestling five days a week, probably minimum. Yeah, so, like, I'm still a little bit sore, but I think it takes time. So I think I have to be strong because we're pulling a lot, and Jonathan's a very strong training partner. Yeah, Herman, you use your training. By the way, hello, hello, Joshua. How are you? Good, good, good. Good to see you guys. Yeah, same, same. Great to see you guys.
SPEAKER_00: I was going to ask you, Herman, your training always only like table time. You don't do anything else. That's what we're doing right now. But if you look at the best version of myself, I was typically lifting weights three times a day and arm wrestling one time per week. That's what I've always done. But do you think that you can continue doing this like five days a week?
SPEAKER_01: Uh, table time and then you can still be healthy. It's interesting that you do this and you feel healthiest ever. Yeah. Um, I think it's sustainable. I don't see any reason why I would stop doing it. Um, what changed was Jonathan moves five minutes away. So it's easy for him to come to my house every day. And when Crossy came down, he was, he said, you need to arm wrestle every day. You need to arm wrestle all the time.
SPEAKER_01: And so I said, okay, well try it. And, uh, personally right now, I'm not too motivated to go to the gym by myself, but if Jonathan knocks on my door, I really don't have a choice, but to arm wrestle. So right now that's easier than lifting weights. So I mostly arm wrestle. I mostly arm wrestle for him, you know, but it helps me. Yeah. But that's interesting. Evgeny when I was very young, like 20, 22, 23, everyday arm wrestling.
SPEAKER_01: I don't think I could recover. And I think you are over 30, right? Yeah, I'm 33. And I'm shocked too. I'm surprised. I mean, because we're going pretty hard. So I'm really surprised that it's working. That's interesting. Yeah. Wow. And you, John, how is your arm? Yeah, it still hurts. I mean, it's getting better, but very, very slowly. I'm hoping it's going to be okay by October.
SPEAKER_03: Um, but I'm training, it doesn't affect me too much in practice as long as I avoid two specific positions. So I've been practicing as usual and I just have to be careful with my range of motion when I lift. Um, so it hasn't been like a huge detriment, but it's definitely, I'm probably like somewhere between 20 and 30% weaker than I was, uh, at worlds last year, right-handed. So anyway, I'm hoping it's gonna improve continuously in October lefty. I feel great.
SPEAKER_00: so no big complaints i understand victor um my friend where did you see that joan is gonna join here it is because i put one of the posters of the uh east versus west yeah i mean it's a clearly sense here east versus west podcast with herman stevens and joshua grant i didn't say joshua augustine grant because it doesn't have enough room for all the
SPEAKER_00: you know letters yeah so but i don't think that i said that i'm gonna go in live with john you know it was only one of the post posters i found and i just put it there you know because i don't have i don't know how to make thumbnail and to already with joshua and herman um so so are you do you guys miss being part of the event yes
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I mean, I keep definitely, you know, I mean, first of all, there's some of us that arm wrestle and take it really seriously and love it probably as much as any of the other guys on the card, but we're not at that elite level. We're like sub-elite people. So, you know, for us to be involved in a stuff like that, just because we might have a match that's going to end up being really good or it makes sense for where we're at in our careers, it's a great opportunity to have. And, you know, it's certainly something I'm very grateful for and it
SPEAKER_03: So speed around all those guys. I mean, I know, obviously, I know a lot of the East and West tourists from being at World for so many years and obviously living in the States. And it's just, it's super fun to be around. And so, yes, I miss it. Yeah, it was, it was, I would say, I mean, how do you see, Herman, the progress of East versus West? Do you think it's progressing in some ways or...
SPEAKER_00: It's definitely progressing in the fact that you have the less matches. So like, so, so I don't know about you, but personally I sleep better at night. Oh, okay. Okay. Yeah. But I don't have it. It's 16 matches I have in August. The first event was 16. Yeah. First event was 16 and then the.
SPEAKER_00: no 11 first event that you guys completed was 11 and then he went up to 16 went down to 13 and now up to 16 again so it is okay i thought you had cut it down to 10 or something or maybe next time next time november november yeah yeah yeah yeah i'm i'm doing my best to do that i'm having some fight with myself you know like
SPEAKER_01: Mind says something, emotion says something, you know? But this time, mine is gonna win. Yeah, nice. Yeah, I think the events are great. I think you got a lot of good matchups. I mean, you know, I question sometimes whether I should be on the stage, like even the couple of times you invited me, because the talent level is so high.
SPEAKER_01: um i might even question the uh coach ray and ryan bowen match but it's a good mix you know what i mean like you have some really super high level and you have some matches that i think people really want to see so i think it's a good balance i agree yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah having matches like that gets people to watch and you know sometimes you want to see people that are you know just popular um
SPEAKER_00: youtube to see what they're doing in real life so it's good to have a mix you know it's fun to have the superstars but it's also fun to have matches that you know are going to be enjoyable to watch i mean i was gonna put uh i was gonna pull uh ryan and then i cancelled i like i mean it is very very hard to organize and compete and i'm still recovering from bicep injury and i owe ryan a replacement match
SPEAKER_00: And he choose Ray. So I think it is like a good opportunity for Ray as well that, you know, he's going to be, I mean, of course, Ray is a great puller, but it will be even, you know, great, greater for him to be on the, you know, competing on the same stage with all those legendary pullers, you know, it is, you know,
SPEAKER_00: Ray is also one of the guys that have been helping me right from the beginning, as you guys do. And I will always appreciate you, Herman, and you, Joshua, right from the beginning. You guys are the, I'll say, the founders of the East versus West. I mean, everyone should know this. I owe you guys a lot. Likewise. Thank you, man.
SPEAKER_01: And then you asked if, you know, if we miss being in that environment. I always tell people, I don't think they really understand. I know John has been to Worlds. I've been to Zloty. It's completely different. And I can't speak for other countries, but it's completely different than what an American would feel here. I mean, I've been to the big WAL tournaments. I've been in the big UAL ones and they're crazy.
SPEAKER_01: But typically, even at those events, I would go in a room and I'd go, okay, maybe there's like 10 people like me in this room. You know, serious back then, serious training all the time. When I went to Zloty, like you could just feel the energy in the room. There was a hundred people more serious, you know, about arm wrestling. It's just completely different. And like, you can feel it.
SPEAKER_00: You know, I don't speak almost, I mean, I didn't talk to anybody because most people don't speak English, but like you could just feel the energy in the room, you know? Yeah. Yeah, see, one guy wrote that he didn't know that Herman and Joshua helped with East versus West. Yes, guys, Joshua and Herman are the people also, Derek Smith helped us right from the beginning. Ray helped us.
SPEAKER_00: and but yeah mostly the the mind guys uh with these guys here and but they just couldn't handle me they were like you're out of control they were right about it they were right i have i have control problems i'm i'm not i'm not denying i i i have problems but i mean i'm trying to like can you imagine like can you imagine i did like
SPEAKER_00: I will tell you how my problem, serious problem I have. I organized East versus West 3 in May. In the next five days, I set the matches for East versus West 4. And I said, why are you doing this? This time, I set the East versus 5 even before East versus West 4 happened. Already two weeks before, I already set eight matches. I don't remember. I think you said after three, you set the four matches in five days?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah. It was after one of them. After one of them, Ingen, I said, Ingen, take some time off, get some sleep, write down everything you did good. I said, write down everything maybe that you need to work on, you know, organize yourself. And you said, okay. And then like the next day, you had a whole card full of matches. That's exactly what happened. We woke up and the whole plan, the card was planned already. Yeah. It's not because I have any
SPEAKER_00: Like whenever I talk with you, I say yes to you. I don't have anything behind my mind. I say I agree with you. But whenever I stay alone, then something controls me. And then I just lay on the bed and I'm like, okay, this guy should pull this guy, this, this. If I said this match, community will be happy. And this and this, this match needs to happen. This guy was needing a match. If I don't set him, he will be upset. You know, just all the emotional reasons, you know.
SPEAKER_00: But at the end, then whenever you see the price of it, then you are like, you know, oh, what did I do? What did I do? I'm glad that you guys are here, you know, because I consider you guys as friends. And also it is also you guys are very, very special people.
SPEAKER_00: uh person and but it's also because you know everything in from the kitchen you know right from the beginning yeah yeah yeah it's been a wild ride and it's been a lot of fun i think we should do this we should do this weekly we i tried to do that before before devil mercy 11 match but there was so much hate you know and i was like okay i had i didn't want headache you know just so much yeah
SPEAKER_03: that's true there was a lot of hate but now that that match is over most of that yes people that were barking disappeared you know there's a few of them out there still but most of them i think a lot of people you know were kind of shocked by the outcome because they really believed that uh devin was going to pull off a miracle yeah better better change the subject before before we start getting i don't want to anyway so that's good that's good that's good and
SPEAKER_00: what do you what do you guys expect from this uh card you know like if we talk about the specific matches we talk about it but just if we talk because we are like about a little bit more than two weeks away from the event and like like which match are you guys looking for forwards if you guys remember the whole cards yeah
SPEAKER_03: I mean, well, having just trained with Jerry last week, I've got a lot of thoughts about that because he's really been training at an insane level for the last month and a half with the practices that we've been putting together. Dave you been in all the trainings with Jerry? No, I haven't been in all of them, but I went because there was a big one that we did on Wednesday. I went to one a couple of months ago and then one
SPEAKER_03: this week so like the difference how do you see the the progress i'll tell you honestly i mean first of all whenever you're pulling somebody like jerry and you're a normal person like me it's kind of hard because he is an absolute wall but you know even against people like when i've had the opportunity to pull dave chafee too and you can sometimes you find like a little bit of movement somewhere in the hand and you're like oh there's a tiny opening there
SPEAKER_03: And with Jerry, sometimes you feel that too, but this, at the beginning of practice, especially, there's two things I noticed. One, his shape is different. So he is more muscular than I've seen him when he was in WAL and his weight looks more efficient. So I feel like even though his weight is similar to WAL weight, I feel like it's more muscle. And in the first hour, he was absolutely immovable by anybody.
SPEAKER_03: And we had a lot of big guys there. You know, Tiete was there. Some other, you know, Fitzy was there. There were a lot of big people and big names there. Frank Hurst and all of us were just like, it was like pulling a building. And it wasn't until we finally got him to stay on the table for I think it was 45 minutes straight, just pulling people over and over and over again. At the end of that, like if you watch the practice that Paul Italia put up, you'll see a few people starting to take
SPEAKER_03: uh his hand and that was after 45 minutes of continuous pulling of the 50 or so guys over there so i was really impressed but what's your intake you know like you you can you say that he's in one of his best ever shapes right now i think he's i think i you know i only have a small memory of him when he was in his waf form you know around 240 when he was incredible
SPEAKER_03: But he's definitely, I would, I definitely, I'm confident saying he's in better shape than he was in, you know, for WEL with Devin or Michael Todd. So I think his shape now is better than it was for either of those two matches. Okay. Okay. Yeah. And so do you expect a war from that match? He kept telling me, he's like, I'm not going there to lose. I'm not going to lose. It was like, almost like a mantra. Cause we were talking about, what do you think?
SPEAKER_03: know Genadi's gonna do he's gonna do this I think he's gonna do that and he had a lot of thoughts about it which I won't share but I mean he just really seemed committed to going over there to win and even that was different like when we were training for Devin or training for Michael Todd he was like I think I'm gonna beat these guys I'm gonna give him a hard time but it wasn't like that same like determination that he had
SPEAKER_00: You know, I think part of it is he knows he's kind of been training for the last two or three months and Genadi's been training straight for five years or whatever it is. So that's an uphill battle for him. So I think it's really motivated him. Yeah, I mean, as long as he's healthy, he is experienced as well. I don't think that, you know, he really needs to start everything right from the beginning. Whatever I saw, he looks big. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: And, and you are one of the, uh, a few people in the community that likes to talk what is in mind, you know, just straight away, you know, just, and so how do you see this match? Yeah, I'm most excited about this match because I'm a huge Genadi fan. Yeah. Because Jerry hasn't been pulling.
SPEAKER_01: But he acts as if he's been pulling and he acts as if he's, you know, the best guy in North America or something along these lines. So I'm just glad for him to get on the table so we don't have to talk anymore or listen to the comments. You know, we'll see if Jerry's good or Jerry's in shape and all that stuff. I'm just really curious. You know, I think he's going to be healthy and rested. But I think some of the training when you're like these really big guys or the tournaments or the matches,
SPEAKER_01: you know, like WAL Jerry, he had, he was pulling, you know, every couple of months or three months. I think he was in good shape, but I mean, it's been a long time since I've seen him pull. I mean, John, I don't know. Has he pulled any local tournaments with any real super heavyweights? I mean, I haven't seen it. The closest he got, he helped run a tournament in New York city, but I think he only after pulled it that he wasn't in the event. So he hasn't pulled an event or a super match since WAL. Gotcha. Yeah. That's a long time. And then like, uh,
SPEAKER_01: you know, I know you said his shape is completely different. He, he definitely looks different, you know, so I don't know what's changed if it's training or supplementation, but I mean, when people change stuff like that, uh, their body tends to respond differently. You know, I've had training partners over the years, they get really big, they get really muscular. And as soon as they get on the table, they get a pump, you know? And, uh, I don't, I just don't know if Jerry can simulate Genadi, you know, in the gym or at a local practice.
SPEAKER_03: So I wouldn't be surprised if this gets, if it's really bad, like Genadi just beats him really bad. But I hope it's a war. Well, you know, I mean, the thing is, is that with Jerry, he loves when people try to top roll him. Yeah. And because, I mean, Genadi is a very diverse puller, as we've seen over his last three matches, but we know his top roll is amazing. And I feel like he's going to try to test that.
SPEAKER_03: And I think that if he does, and you know, Jerry tricks them into like a long bleed out match, Jerry can be in a, almost a resting position when he's in his full flat press and the top rolling person has to be expending almost maximum effort to hold them. So if something like that happens, it could be bad. Yeah. Hmm.
SPEAKER_00: My question to you, Herman, you were questioning if Jerry is in his best shape or not because he hasn't been pulling as he used to pull regularly. So what if he is in that shape, in his best shape that you have ever seen? Does it make difference in your opinion? Yeah, it can make the match tough. But, I mean, we've seen Jerry in good shape.
SPEAKER_01: Lose to Ron Bath, John Brzenk, Dave Chaffee, et cetera. I think Genadi is as technical as any of those guys, and he can hook with some of those guys. So Genadi could kind of just push him sideways. Genadi doesn't have to top roll him. And I really haven't seen Jerry in like any super elite cook matches. Like I don't want to hook with Jerry.
SPEAKER_01: the number seven guy in the United States doesn't want to hook with Jerry, but I don't think I've seen Jerry hook with Dave or Dennis or, or even like early Lavon or even Genadi. I haven't seen him get into a hook match with anyone at that level. Um, so I really don't raise his hook that highly. Again, he might beat some of our better super heavyweights in a hook, but it's possible that, you know, Genadi just goes inside and Jerry,
SPEAKER_00: You know, I don't know if you've seen it, but some people will go low on Jerry and he will still try to flop like under their hook and he just gets moved sideways. I think Genadi is good enough to do that. Yeah, if he knows and if he's strong enough to do it, yeah, there is a possibility. Do you remember last time we met who you thought that was going to win between John and Ungar Bayer, Herman? I said John.
SPEAKER_01: John, and after Corey match, do you now like even more confidence or it didn't change anything? Maybe. I think at some point after we last talked, I thought about it more and I was, I don't know if I was leaning more towards Andrabayev, but I understood your point about John not being able to control Andrabayev's pronation. So that's still a risk. But I would still vote on John.
SPEAKER_01: After you beat Corey West, like, did it make your confidence even bigger in John? Yeah, I would say so. Because he can pull a long match, and he can pull a hard match, and he can pull weird matches. You know? I mean, John was in some really bad positions. And, I mean, if his shoulder's that bad, I figured, you know, you would just quit. You know? So I think he'll be able to pull a good number by him.
SPEAKER_00: Was that John Corey was a little injured though from the match at the table. I don't know about injured. I believe tired, but you know, I don't know. But I mean, yeah, that match was crazy. Yeah. Yeah, two weeks, two weeks between in between two weeks. If no injury, I think two weeks is enough for recovery time for a young guy in. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: even i would think of recovering in two weeks like i'm all over injured and i'm 47 before the eight in october so i i about being tired i don't think so but about being uh hurt if there is anything like that then i don't know about that and what do you think josh i still think uh i would love to see john win but um
SPEAKER_03: And even though, you know, we don't really have a lot of video evidence of, um, on goodbye lately, I just, I have a hard time believing that he's going to come in unprepared and untrained. And as you mentioned, you know, he's been performing better in the more recent matches in the tournament that happened. And I think that that style is going to be really challenging for John. Um, so I mean, I would be challenging John, is there anything on this or that
SPEAKER_00: like could surprise john at the table and john john wouldn't have anything to counter back you know i mean i kind of say i kind of see that only only um if you dominate john then then then there is not much to do about it but if the guy is not like that superman superman then i always think that john
SPEAKER_03: you know, finds a way to fight back, but you know, you may. Yeah. I mean, I don't know. I guess part of it is maybe a nostalgia for me because I can still see the match with, uh, Levon and, um, and I just remember being so impressed by him because he was so much smaller and, you know, not nearly as strong in any way. And so he gave Levon some small problems. They weren't big problems, but it's still because no one really has given Levon any problems.
SPEAKER_03: still left an impression on me and uh that top role is so amazing and you know that kazakhstan style in general is something i'm so impressed by i just and he's much younger and he's much faster and i think that uh it's going to be tough but again if john wins i'm going to be i'm going to be ecstatic yeah you don't you don't always surprise us that they you know like 4 30 a.m or something here
SPEAKER_00: i was awake just to watch his match and corey brought him like that far to the pad and yeah him to fight from there and come back and just like it was incredible i agree i mean if the americans are looking for a true hero you know for sure that that that is not that that rocky or something then this the real one is right here you know yeah and how about
SPEAKER_00: Do you guys have any... I have no idea at all about one match. It is Kody Merritt versus Arthur Morozov. I really do not know. I talked today with Bob Bowen, and Bob also said that it's the same as John Brzenk. All Kody does is table training. So it is not so much possible to gauge, measure his strength. But
SPEAKER_00: At the table, we can see the difference, but we don't know how much. And so I really do not know that Arthur Morozov's back pressure and Kody's that insane side pressure. I really don't know. Yeah, but that's why we started this event, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Was to figure all this out, you know? Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. I have no clue. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: One cool thing about Kody is that, you know, and I don't think everybody remembers this, even though it was relatively recent, he just won a WAF senior title, left-handed. So he's experienced with Europeans and is used to that style of pulling. And I think that's something that worked in his favor. And he actually won that class very easily. And I remember watching and I was like, what the F word? I was like, I couldn't believe it.
SPEAKER_00: I was so impressed by him, and so I feel like that's going to be a lot for Morozov, and I'm leaning towards Kody, personally. Ingen, did Bob Bowen mention Kody's broken arm? Because he fractured something. Oh, he didn't mention anything. He said he feels so great that even his right arm feels so great. He said he beat him with right arm, people that he didn't beat, you know, he couldn't beat before him. Oh, yeah, it's because he's not doing WAF anymore.
SPEAKER_03: What do you mean? Because he's not doing WAF Worlds anymore, maybe. Yeah, I'm just saying. Yeah, yeah, that's right. Yeah, anyway, so that's it. John, do you have any idea about it? Yeah, I'm leaning, like I said, I'm leaning towards Kody. I try not to vote with my heart. I might be voting with my heart a little bit on that one. I spent a lot of time with Kody.
SPEAKER_03: overseas and uh he's a really solid person and his i love his uh daughter she competed too but um i also just feel like you know he's really really really good and he has solid experience against uh europeans in a very strict rule format so i felt all that's no one in my favor i did not group up with him
SPEAKER_03: I'm just curious, like, does he have a big hand? Like, is he like a true superhero? My hand is, he has, I mean, I shook his hand. My hand is bigger than his, but not, but his hand is much fatter than mine, but my hand is ridiculously large. So it's, my hand is, you know, the only person I know who I've ever locked up with whose hand is bigger than mine is RBJ. Um, but his hand is like a bowling ball. So I think he has what I would call, I mean, it's bigger than Jerry's, uh,
SPEAKER_00: I don't think it's as big as Chaffee's, but it's very solid, very thick. And by the way, when the subject already there, Rob Visions coming back, having four months to pull Zurab. People says that Zurab right now should be stronger than Sasho because also heavier. But the difference is that Zurab's wrist handling
SPEAKER_00: is as good as sasha's because i don't remember sasha losing his wrist uh once the strap is on and so that is the problem the the problem is not the pressure that will be applied in hook because if sasha ends up would go they would go you know inside but the important thing is that like controlling routes tornadoes um
SPEAKER_00: with a flat wrist is Zurab as good as Sasho about, you know, inner side pressure, you know, without needing to even bending your wrist and applying supinated side pressure. So my opinion, if Rob is ready and then I see there is a possibility Rob to, you know, use his pronator to stop
SPEAKER_00: Zurab's side pressure. But if that happens, then where the match is going to go is a different story. Because if you guys realize, after the match went to strap, John was easily holding Zurab. Once he brought him here to press, even with the shoulder press, it wasn't that easy until he, you know, raised up and then catch from his fingers and then pressed him, you know. What's the weight limit?
SPEAKER_00: 100 kilo. I think 100 kilo is great for both of them, in my opinion. I think at 100 kilograms, I think Rob, if he's in shape, is better than Ron Bath. That is also interesting match that Zurab beat Ron, but lost John. So, but just remember one thing, when you say at 100 kilo, Ron being
SPEAKER_00: Sorry, Rob vision being better than Ron, talking about 100 kilo Rob versus 100 kilo Ron, or you're talking about the 100 kilo Rob against any weight of Ron you're talking about? Any weight of Ron. Okay, because Ron was about 115 kilo when Rob pulled him, yeah. Yeah, and I think Rob is a more dynamic puller than Ron is.
SPEAKER_01: Uh, Ron, I mean, Ron's always been a very much a, like squeeze your hand, flat wrist, go sideways. Maybe it goes into a hook kind of puller. I think Rob has more variation in his top roles. I think he'll be able to maybe take through Rob's hand easier as if he's in shape. Um, also also will drop, be able to sleep, but the only thing in other events, any sleep, as long as you don't elbow fell or you don't come to parallel pin.
SPEAKER_00: his strap so but it is not that easy to get away from his fingers either you know yeah so it's going to be interesting alex i i think rob's better than ron so i think zurab's going to have some problems because because people writes like you know zurab is going to destroy him zurab is going to kill him the same thing about jura versus chance show at east versus west for here august
SPEAKER_00: I don't know who's going to win, but people say that Zurab is going to destroy chance. I just don't see that. I mean, I'm not saying I don't see Zurab winning, but destroying, like dominating, I don't see that. Do you guys remember the match between Chance and Taka, I think, lately? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, like, it should give you some idea about, you know, that Chance, people are
SPEAKER_00: have I mean big time underestimating that guy you know the guy is a dangerous guy you know yeah and but stylistically I see incredible match one with the you know incredible pronator one is incredible inner side pressure with the lower standard curling I mean incredible match I am thinking that chance will have the position but once he wanted to go for the pin I don't know
SPEAKER_03: if he will in him or if he will slowly go inside you know while you're pressing your tornado maybe you know turning in but i don't know how do you guys see that much go josh for me um i mean i when i think of rob i don't know if you guys know rampage jackson the usc fighter but uh they are like similar in my mind because they're both very very committed to their families and they both have
SPEAKER_03: such an unbelievable amount of natural talent and whenever they really committed to training they were basically untouchable and for me it's going to be how motivated is rob going to be and how serious is he going to take it over the next few months and if he does both of those things i agree with you and i think it's i think he has a really good chance of winning um he better take it seriously he better take it seriously yeah
SPEAKER_00: I agree with you on that. He needs to make a good comeback. Well, I'm going to do everything in my power to make sure that he does. I mean, I live only 45 minutes from him. He needs to realize that people love him. I mean, he's not an easy personality like me. I'm not an easy personality either. But he needs to realize it. I personally enjoy watching him
SPEAKER_00: i think he has incredible potential and in my opinion arm wrestling world needs the existence of rob yeah yeah so he needs to know this not only he needs arm wrestling i think arm wrestling world also needs him i need to just make a good comeback like how mathematics asked me and
SPEAKER_00: one more time, you know, give me a chance to show myself. And I said, yes, Matt, why not? You know, but just come prepared, you know, just good thing. Now he says he's training every day. So he's also coming on November. Sorry about that. You continue. No, I mean, I think, you know, I know we have a plan up here between the three major teams that are within an hour of him doing everything we can to get him ready, like we're doing for Jerry. So I feel like,
SPEAKER_03: we're going to keep the pressure on him. And I'm going to keep saying the things that you just said, Anken, to remind him that he is, he's definitely a beloved figure here. And he's also, he's a figure that, you know, some people, I don't personally feel this way. I don't find Rob frustrating, but I know he frustrates other people because of, you know, how well he did against Hutchings in the 195 class at WAL when Hutchings was completely smashing everybody else. And people like
SPEAKER_03: like he was right on the cusp of like exploding but i was i know him and he's got a lot of kids that he's taken care of that he loves and that's his absolute primary and most important goal and that's like it's really hard that's really hard for me to listen to people say things like that knowing that he's taking care of his kids um but anyway this is a perfect opportunity because all the summer stuff that he does up at that camp is going to be over he's going to have a few months to put his nose to the grindstone so to speak but i think it's
SPEAKER_00: I'm really excited that you were able to talk them into doing it again. And then I think it's, I'm just very excited about it. Yeah. There is one super chat. I cleaned pink. I don't know. I can't see. Thank you for your, uh, super chat. And again, thanks for all you do. We need to get more lightweights over to east versus west, like the American cycle.
SPEAKER_00: How do you pronounce it? Tuggle? Tuggle. Yeah, sorry about it. Yeah, Corey Miller is coming. I tried to reach that. I have COVID, if you guys don't know. Oh, wow. Yeah, yeah, right now. Yes, yes, yes, again, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: four or five days ago, I felt like, you know, somebody beat me with a stick. My spine was just, I thought I was dying. First two days, I did the test. What do we have? PCR and antigen. I did antigen, and it was negative. The third day, the pain was unbearable, and I checked. It was positive. Yesterday, I checked again. It's still positive. Anyway, so Harris, Harris,
SPEAKER_00: What was his first name in my mind is just because. Travis. No, no, Harris. No, no, not Travis. Harris. What Harris? The WAL champion? Sam Harris. Sam Harris, yeah. Sam Harris, yeah. Sorry about it. I'm telling you, I'm ill, so my memory's not good. Sam Harris, yeah. We tried to reach, but we couldn't. It would be good to have him here.
SPEAKER_00: And while we're talking about it, how do you guys see, John, Chance versus Zurab? I think Chance wins. You think Chance is going to win? The Georgians and majority of the community, they think Zurab is going to win. I see that 50-50 match. It can go anywhere. I don't think that either of them will win.
SPEAKER_01: Dominate the other one. I don't see such a match. It'll be hard. I think it'll be a hard match. And John, do you think chance will if he wins? Do you think he'll just top roll to the pad? Or do you think he's going to have to come up and book or press? I don't know if I've ever seen him press. But it looks OK too. I think I think it'll be in the straps first of all. Yeah, and I do see him being able to maintain. I think he's going to be able to pull off his number one move, yes.
SPEAKER_00: answer your question so i think it will come over like that i'm just thinking about his wrist against for zinc you know and what happens and i feel we see something similar to that yeah by the way i wanna i wanna uh say that i'm so happy that you guys are my guests uh i i love chatting you guys seriously yeah likewise thank you for joining
SPEAKER_00: And while we're talking about the lightweights, Corey Miller, does he have potential to surprise the community? Because majority are thinking that Daniel is going to win, even though Corey is going to surprise him by putting him in especially early rounds in terrible positions with his explosiveness. How do you guys see that match?
SPEAKER_03: I'm very confident about this one. Um, and I just saw Corey at nationals a little while ago, so I don't want him to be mad at me, but I do think that, uh, Daniel's going to win. And I'm basing that on a couple of things and all the matches that Daniel has had with Mendoza over the years. And then the times that we've seen Mendoza pull, um, elite level Americans, they got almost.
SPEAKER_03: I collected information I have on both of them. I think right now Daniel is too much for Corey. I think Corey from 10 years ago or even Corey next year might be a different story because I think Corey is on the way up right now. But at this moment in time, I think Daniel's favorite. And do you think that Corey Miller versus Minda was both top roles would be a better match? No.
SPEAKER_03: I think Mandaugas is not at that weight with his move. I don't think he's touchable by any Americans. And it does pain me to say that. That's what I think. No offense to anybody, because I love Corey. And I actually think, like I said, Corey is coming up. And I feel like in a year, it might be a very different situation. But right now, this moment of time, go to 15.
SPEAKER_01: And I have a similar opinion. And I think, especially at the lightweights, I would think someone like Corey or Sam, you would have to pull these guys a few times to really get adjusted. Like you'd have to pull Daniel, maybe lose, go back to training, pull another guy, lose, go back to training. And then I think you could probably grow to the level, but just being in the United States and then just going to, uh,
SPEAKER_00: know a waf champion in the lightweights it's really not it's not likely but but the the category being 80 kilo limit would it give some kind of advantage to corey since daniel heavy's ever competed was like uh 165
SPEAKER_00: But what's, what's Daniel's current weight or what, what do you, do you know? He will be near, he will be near 80, but you remember that last was people 70 kilo one 54. I'm sure that, you know, he will gain weight to, you know, be around there. But, uh, like one is like, Corey is almost everyday weight, like all the time competing weight. Like they are actually meeting at Corey's weight category.
SPEAKER_01: not 165 or something you know yeah i think when you're gaining weight like that it could impact daniel's endurance but i think he's going to be so strong that it might not matter now i thought earlier that corey would have an advantage because i thought corey was a lot bigger not weight you know but i think you told me i think daniel was like five feet eight inches or something like that i thought daniel was much smaller you know frame wise yeah so if they're similar in height and structure
SPEAKER_03: I don't think the weight's really going to matter. I don't know how tall he is. Five, nine, five, ten. Yeah, I would say he's around. He's tall at 5'8", but not by a huge amount. Yeah, I mean, I agree with Herman. I feel, you know, I think, again, the amount of tournament pulling and the quality of tournament pulling that both have done is also a factor.
SPEAKER_03: But I think Corey, I mean, I'm really happy that he pulled Giannis and there's even a chance to pull Daniel because Corey is definitely one of our athletes who has the most growth potential. I think it'll inspire him and whatever happens that he's further in the West, it's gonna end up setting a fire under him, I think. He's also, he does a lot of other stuff for the community. Like he runs tons of the events, like he has his own bracket system and most of the bigger events in the Midwest, he runs them.
SPEAKER_03: Um, and a lot of other people use this bracket system. So he's done a bunch of, and he's also trying to set up the first ELO ranking system for the United States, which would be incredible. Um, so he's doing a lot of cool stuff and I just think it would be good for him to get a more exposure. How do you guys think that Paul Talbot November meeting, uh, Daniel at, uh, one 87. I think Paul Talbot is amazing right now.
SPEAKER_01: yeah that's i've i have a hard time not voting with my heart on that just because i feel like oh man let me think about it for a minute yeah yeah so again paul talbot's pulling for kupchick yeah in november yeah left arm so paul talbot is also pulling jonathan brita in september and yeah well i don't know he might be pretty damaged after that i mean
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, September, but November, there's two months in between. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I was thinking a month. Yeah, you're right. Two months. Yeah, I don't know. I think Paul likes to do this sort of weird stuff with his elbow. Yeah, hopefully he's not injured after pulling Brita, but he's definitely going to lose that match. So, yeah, we'll see what happens. I think he might still be tuning in to Brita to pull Daniel.
SPEAKER_01: Herman, what was your opinion about the Zurab versus Breda match? Oh, Zurab was just too strong. I mean, that's... No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Before, before. Before the match. Oh, I thought Jonathan was going to be able to give him some problems because of how Jonathan was handling Ron Beck, you know, in Alabama when they pulled, right? So that's where my data was coming from there.
SPEAKER_01: Clearly, Zerob's on another level, though. I understand, yeah. But it's like I said, even if Jonathan was strong enough, I don't think you're just going to go and have the success. I think you have to pull with these guys more to really understand what you're doing. Or Jonathan and I would have to change our training to get ready for that. This is what I try to say to people. The reason that right now is...
SPEAKER_00: looks like has the edge generally the first of all we need to you know set this you know we're talking about west mainly one country and some canadian athletes when you're talking about east you're talking about 10 different countries you're talking about so it is like just imagine instead of us there was georgia and you say you know west and then
SPEAKER_00: then you say east you're talking about usa kazakhstan bulgaria you know russia and turkey yeah so that is just like very unfair to the american arm masters you understand they are like one against world you know type of thing we're talking about but second all thing that i want to uh talk about is that um east has the edge but
SPEAKER_00: Do you realize how much competition in last 30 years, like every WAAF, every European Championships, every Zloty Tur, do you realize how much they learn from those three tournaments every year? They go all each other's different styles and everything. They go home and with more knowledge, they progress.
SPEAKER_00: and everyone does this and then three times a year these people meet again and again and again and again the competition is just make them incredible level so what i'm just saying that if you guys agree or not you know you both have been here a lot and don't you think that this east versus west is good about the um
SPEAKER_00: both sides learning from each other, but most for the American pullers learning by pulling all different because they have been pulling only with each other. While these people are pulling with all many countries, but these people are still learning. I mean, pull against Rambet, you learn a lot. Pulling against John Burzing, I mean, like how much confidence was Zurab before the match? He was saying he's 50%.
SPEAKER_00: stronger than the time that he pulled rambets because he said he had covid now it is because he doesn't have covid he trained better he's much stronger but still he could not control john his pain was just like while trying to sleep his hand and john was holding on first one was questionable second one even john didn't question joe said yes i shouldn't try to hold on and he just but it was not really controlling john and beating it's because john didn't want to let him go you know
SPEAKER_00: but do you realize how much he learned from that match he felt something that he has never felt before and most likely he will never feel again you know that kind of end control and everything he was like how the hell is possible a 58 years old man he doesn't even have the gym training while i'm lifting whole gym every day and then how this guy generates such a power you know you know what i mean right yeah yeah yeah
SPEAKER_01: No, so I agree with you on the impact. I think it's definitely going to help the United States become better. I've told people before, and this isn't the only case, but Voskin coming here as a WAF gold medalist at 132 pounds, I think he set the level for our lightweights. I mean, he was beating our 54 guys, our 176 guys. He was beating some of our top 198 guys. And I think everybody had to get better, right? So just having that one guy come live here,
SPEAKER_01: I think changed, uh, United States arm wrestling. I'm sure when Roman came for the short period, he was here or John bull, uh, Viblyani that made everybody kind of step up their level when you see such a small person, you know, being our super heavyweights. So I can do the same thing. Yeah. Yeah. But you know, about the, the population logic, um, I don't know, John, like then that understanding China would be killing.
SPEAKER_01: Every country, every kind of sports. If it's not the population, I agree with you. I think it has to do with the cultural significance of the sport in every country. Yes, yes, yes, yes. A lot of the countries are smaller, and so you have these, like, cities. So, you know, you talk to Krasimir, I mean, they can go to practice, and you have Krasimir, Bojadar, Jordan, all in the same group. I've been on wrestling for 12 years, and I just found a training partner that's almost equal in Jonathan. Yep, yep, yep. That's another thing, yep.
SPEAKER_00: And I finally have a training partner on this level. Yeah, many of those Georgian athletes in Tbilisi, around Tbilisi, some of them are in Batumi, but most of them, I think, around Tbilisi. And so they can meet all the time, you know. So that also matters a lot, yeah. Yeah, so there are many, many, many different matches. I just saw Egle. David you guys see the video that, you know, she was climbing the rope? No, I didn't.
SPEAKER_00: Oh yeah, it was on the Instagram. If you check her Instagram, maybe a few days ago. And I say, I just saw, but, um, people also knows like Gabriela, she's very popular. She's also very active about competition and about social media. Uh, and Egle was kind of away from arm wrestling. She just pulled us to European championships and, and she's not that active about, you know, as an athlete on the social media.
SPEAKER_00: And people underestimates Egle. I'm not saying that Egle is going to win. I'm not saying Gabriela is going to win either, but people should not underestimate Egle. Do you guys know Egle well enough? I mean, I don't know her as much. I think, you know, my initial impression when you first announced it was that she had the edge over Gabi, but
SPEAKER_00: I also thought, like what you said about the tournament experience recently, Gabby has been obviously doing really well. But I still think maybe Egle has an advantage. Yeah. One guy, Andreas, I think, from Greece, wrote that, I think back in 1990, Zaur was competing in a unified team with the Russians. I remember
SPEAKER_00: Fadi Bardawil, Ph.D.: and national uniform, it was saying in I think the world championship was in 1991 Israel I didn't go I my first was was 93, but I think I remember. Fadi Bardawil, Ph.D.: On a like a professional video filming it was saying Soviet Georgia, I think, Soviet Georgia, they were represented in 1991. Fadi Bardawil, Ph.D.: Not really so it's not Georgia, but Soviet Georgia.
SPEAKER_00: So this is what I remember, yeah. Yeah, anyway, so that that that is also that's also interesting match and I don't know there is there is there are there are Iraqi versus Krasimir. How do you guys see that much? David you guys have any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any any
SPEAKER_03: I was shocked by that. The one match I was most confident about on that card, other than obviously Levan and Devin, was that match. I was really shocked that Irakli did that to Marcio. So as a result, it changed my opinion about this match also. Yes, I think Irakli. Irakli and Armand?
SPEAKER_01: I'm not sure. So Crossy's going to lose his hand. It's going to go to the straps. Crossy's probably still going to lose his hand. And then can he beat Iroclite then? Yeah, it's going to be tight. I don't know if I'm like sold on Iroclite just having the arm power to drag Crossy across the table. But I think that's what it's going to look like. It's going to be Crossy here pressing.
SPEAKER_01: and then Rothley trying to get a pin. I'm not really sure what's going to happen. I mean, Crossy said he was healthy, you know, so who knows? But also, I think in some ways, I've talked to Crossy about it. His arm range is so limited that I don't know if he's better now than he was five years ago. You know, his arm goes to about like here and here.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah. You know, whereas when let's say Todd, or let's say if I was going to go sideways with no hand, I can do this. Right. You've got a lot more sideways pressure here than you do out there. So, um, yeah, it doesn't really sound good from Crossy just because of his arm limitations. Turner just made a good point. When was the last time Crossy actually lost to somebody lighter than him?
SPEAKER_00: I think he went back and forth with Sasho, but that was a number of years ago. I can't think of anybody else that was lighter than him that beat him recently. Marcio, we said that he lost to Marcio, but I saw Marcio, how he looked there. I don't think that Marcio was lighter than Krasimir. I'm sure he was heavier than Krasimir. I don't know. That's interesting.
SPEAKER_00: You guys want to finish it? Do you guys have a little bit more time to cover a few more? I have time. It's really until you guys get bored of me. I think it's the main thing. Let's cover a little bit more. Yeah, okay. There's always batches on here. Dave Sheffy and Arthur Morozov. Does Arthur Morozov have any chance to surprise Dave? And I was thinking the same logic. And then somebody asked...
SPEAKER_00: you know, with the super chat or something to Artem, they said, Artem, you could not move Prudnik. How are you going to beat David Sheffy? And Artem says something that made sense to me. He said that Prudnik is so technical with such a great hand control, with the incredible start that he puts you out of position so quick so that you can apply your power.
SPEAKER_00: you're out of position already. While he said Dave Chaffee is probably stronger than Prudnik, but it's all about the side pressure, he said. So he said, I will be able to use my power, what I have against Dave, but I couldn't use it against Prudnik. This is what he said. Any opinion about this? It makes sense. Go ahead, John.
SPEAKER_03: I mean, it makes a lot of sense, but I still don't, I don't, I don't think he can beat Chaffee. I'm not, I'm not giving up on Chaffee yet. I mean, the last match with Genadi, I mean, I still feel like Chaffee is getting an advantage over, over Arthur, but, um, it does make a good point. And I think he's a hundred percent right about Prudnik. Prudnik is absolute genius on the table, which we've all seen when he was in the one 98 class, nevermind, uh, now with a super heavyweight level. So it's an excellent point, but.
SPEAKER_00: think people underestimate still i don't know why but they still do underestimate the amount of force dave creates in that direction and how hard it is to stop it even once and yeah the way that the way that he beat the way that he beat uh gennady in first two rounds imagine that is the way that gennady went against hermes outside you know you know first four rounds he tried to go outside
SPEAKER_00: And Hermes had the control. But to pin him, Hermes had to work a lot. While, when I say a lot, you know, he just like had to go shoulder pressure, this and that. While they just clearly dominated Genadi in first two rounds. When Genadi wanted to go outside. Yeah. You understand what I'm trying to say? So, I think that they, with that side pressure is incredible level. I think this is
SPEAKER_00: And imagine that Genadi, Herman, do you think that Genadi that pulled Hermes in last December and Genadi that pulled Dave in May, same Genadi? Or you think he improved a lot? No. So he improved a lot. So what I'm just saying that Dave pulled against stronger version of Genadi, those first two rounds that I'm talking about.
SPEAKER_00: So Genadi was stronger than the time that he pulled against Hermes. But still, Dave, when Genadi tried to pull the same way he wanted to pull against Hermes, Dave just dominated him, you know. And Genadi is probably more technical than Morozov. Yeah, yeah. So what is Morozov going to do? And the other thing is, it's like Dave has a lot of side pressure, but he's really posting and going back. He's not going straight sideways.
SPEAKER_01: when he's beating these people. So I think when Marazon grabs his hand, it's not gonna be just pushing sideways. Dave is gonna like rise over his hand and go sideways. And I think it's gonna be a problem. I agree. And John? Yeah, I agree. I think he'll beat him much more easily than, I mean, he lost to Genadi, but I think it'll be a similar start
SPEAKER_01: and that the finish will be easier for Dave. I could see Morozov getting around, but I think Dave is going to win relatively easily. Yeah. And then, like, the real complicating factor is Dave's health. Like, I still don't know what happened. I didn't talk to him. I don't know what happened after the first two rounds. I don't know if he was tired. I don't know if it was like... His hand was pumped, you know. He was out of gas, he said, you know. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Because I know he had neck issues. I've had neck issues. Sometimes you feel 100% and you wake up and your arm is like 60%. Yeah. I experience it all the time. All the time. I have the same problem. Do you guys think that Chance Shaw is getting paid by Jerry Catherett to make Jerry's PR? Every time he comes to the show, he's talking about Jerry.
SPEAKER_03: No, I don't think so. I want to say something about Chance's defense. Because I remember Chance was willing, I think it was the last New England, or maybe the one before. I think it was last New England. Chance was willing to fly up the morning of New England's, and I was willing to set up that he and Jerry could pull before the event so he could fly up, do the match, and basically get out of here. Chance was going to pay his own way up. And I couldn't get Jerry to, like,
SPEAKER_03: agree to it chance was 100 willing and jerry was like oh my son's got a football game that kind of stuff come on man this dude's willing to fly up here he's gonna be 20 minutes away from you just pull him but uh jerry was being a pain in the ass about it um but i always respect that chance is willing to go anywhere and pull people hey uh you could maybe correct me if i'm wrong josh
SPEAKER_03: But I know Chance called out Jerry once, and Jerry said that he had to ask his boss if he can get time off from work. Doesn't Jerry own a car dealership? Like, isn't Jerry the boss? He's not the boss. He's got a high-level position there. But, like, in that field, you basically have to be shot in the stomach to not go to work on a Saturday or Sunday because that's when they sell a vast majority of their vehicles.
SPEAKER_03: So, like, in order for him to be out of there on a weekend, it's like, you know, it's like major surgery kind of thing. Gotcha. Okay. It's not that bad, dude. By the way, Chance, I'm just joking with you, my friend. Don't get offended. We all know that. Chance doesn't get offended. Chance has thick skin. You got to have thick skin if you're going to be on social media and be an arm wrestler, I'll tell you, because people are all over your media. It's all the potato chips. They still wear it thin.
SPEAKER_00: i know you're an exception though yeah and okay something that you guys would also know because the the eastern guys don't know a lot about the western guys and western guys don't know much about the eastern guys but you two are exception you know i mean because you have you guys have pulled around you know zloty and waft you know and
SPEAKER_03: What do you guys think about Samushia versus Bozhidar at 187? I'm never betting against Bozhidar again. That's my opinion. I think he's... I said this the last time we did this show. He's one of the most impressive arm wrestlers to me. And actually, I don't think I've ever really bet against him. There was a time I didn't really know him that well. And since I've seen him pull so many times since then, anybody that's within 20 pounds of him, I'm not betting against him.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. Yeah. I would love to get him over. I would love to get the tour of the United States. I had dreams. Now I remember about two matches. I should I should I share? I'm organized with me. Okay, I will say but normally I hope Bush therefore gives me but I see
SPEAKER_00: Bozhidar underdog against Samushia. 52-48. My opinion. Also, I see Derek a little bit underdog against Revaz. But I see both of them having a chance to win. But in my dream, both Bozhidar and Derek won. Interesting. I don't remember what was the score with Bozhidar.
SPEAKER_00: But in my dream, Derek was beating Revaz Tricho. Just dream, you know, just don't take it seriously. Derek had the same dream. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Well, you know, it's because if you're dreaming about it, the thing that I think is like, is it all of your technical knowledge of the sport, like working on your brain as you sleep and that's what your brain said, this is how it's going to happen. So it could still be, there could be validity to that, you know? Yeah. So I guess we'll find out, but it's a lot of people blame me, you know, like, how can you set that match? It's a mismatch, you know?
SPEAKER_00: Revaz kept saying that, I said, Revaz, I'm going to set you a match in November. He said, no, I want now. I said, sorry, but my budget is, you know, this much. He's like, that's okay, you know, you can pay me less. And I was like, okay. And we need to find you an opponent from North America. You already pulled with Michael. And Jerry is already pulling. And Dave is already pulling. So who would you set?
SPEAKER_00: Rebels against North America. Yeah, there's really not many people. President might be fun. Oh, yeah. Derek beat him. Wouldn't people tell me that? How come you didn't say Derek, but the team? Yeah, no, no. If you look at the rankings, Derek's ranked ahead of Tim.
SPEAKER_00: And so it makes sense to pull Derek on that, in that, in that perspective. Also, also their match, Derek was like convincingly winner. I mean, I cannot take opinion over the results. This is what I said. Maybe, maybe if Tim comes stronger, better shape, the things may be different, but there is some results, you know? So that's what I try to say.
SPEAKER_00: Anyway, so I think that's all. I thank you very, very much for being part of it. You guys want to add something more generally? As I usually say, I just want to again thank you for... Mithat, put him into trouble. No, I won't put you in trouble. No trouble. I was just going to say, again, thank you for continuing to put these events on. I'm not even going to mention that person, so you're safe.
SPEAKER_03: But yeah, I think I'm just psyched you're still doing it, Mangan. I'm glad that you're, you know, that the community is really rallying behind it and that the interest level is going up and up and up and you have a big part of that. And I think this event is going to be bigger than the last one and hopefully it will continue and continue. And as always, I appreciate the invitation. I love talking with you guys and have a lot of fun. Yeah, I hope to see you again here. And you can be proud of yourself by being one of the
SPEAKER_01: founders of the East versus West, my friend. And I will always appreciate, always. And Herman? Thanks for having me. I think the only thing I would comment on, someone asked, when's my next match? I have no matches scheduled. I don't really want to schedule any matches. I finally feel good. So hopefully I can train for the rest of the year and then see where I am. I think as you start, continue competing, that is how you will see yourself.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, yeah. Yeah. So like, like, Jonathan, five days a week, you know, that that high level, intense level, why would you put all those miles on your arms right now, instead of just one week taking, you know, break and just competing somewhere and just some actual pulling, you know, because you're still I'm still injured. Technically, I still have some pain. And what I don't do in practice, we don't do any ready goes. Right.
SPEAKER_01: if I go to a tournament in the United States, I'm probably going to pull super heavyweight just because, and I'm going to do ready goes. And that is way more damaging, I think, than what we do at practice. Um, but Jonathan's going to be pulling, I'm sure I'll be going to tournaments with him. Um, maybe Mississippi state in September, maybe. And really it's just to kind of see what I feel like, but I think the ready goes are harder and different than the practice. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: anyway so i would like to thank to my social media uh sponsor and old school apps and guys on the description you will find the link if you uh shop from there you will have 10 discount you will use the uh engine uh password and then then you you can support
SPEAKER_00: me and my sponsors. And there is one more question. Big Grow Golds, thank you for your super chat. Engin, how much are the signed tables selling for in US dollars shipped? My friend, we ask for the, first of all, the tables are incredible solid tables. Arm Fight Factory, there are table sponsors. Thanks them very much.
SPEAKER_00: incredible tables you saw the top design with the atlas pictures and atlas will sign them and we asked for the ship into us this is about 500 my friends and the table is a thousand dollars and yeah also i want to do do you think it's a good idea to do auction you know because we already sold five tables that the atlas will sign with that special cover and but do you guys think i should do auction
SPEAKER_00: that for the table that will be used actually used at the stage people think that you know i'm like looking for money or something with guys it is this one i don't know if you guys i told you guys uh it's the first event was 75 000 this event is 110 000 so it is really yes yes yes
SPEAKER_00: unfortunately unfortunately i realized it after i said all those matches i said all those and i was okay let me calculate now and i was like what's wrong with you you know how are you gonna cover this and so i'm trying to cover and so i don't want people to think that i'm trying to make money or something i'm just trying to uh cover the event only the tickets are very near thirty thousand dollars you know um it's august
SPEAKER_00: 29 atlas you know and you know some okay i don't want to go uh the details but um so this is this is what it is so i would definitely sell or auction the tables i don't know technically like what's the easiest thing to do josh may know like an auction service just one of them the one of them definitely worth auctioning it'll go from i have to have to do the auction you know what's that
SPEAKER_00: Well, I think eBay may do auctions I don't know, but then like can Turkey use eBay I know that that's a large part of the problem is Turkey using some of these websites, you know. That we have them, but I don't use it personally yeah I know that yeah yeah anyway so let's let's. Let's meet next week again. If you guys are available. sounds good to me.
