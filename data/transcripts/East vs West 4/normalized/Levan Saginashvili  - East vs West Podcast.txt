SPEAKER_02: we need to we need to honor tourniquet we need to honor uh the people who inspired us we can't forget that if you forget that if we go like okay i only care about today i don't care about past there will be a day that people will ignore today and it will go there but we are not gonna forget we will be grateful to all those people who has been inspiring us um of course
SPEAKER_02: Many forget how long armwrestling has been around. It has many legends. It has a great history. And we definitely have to refresh our memory. Yeah. By the way, when I was going to Irakli and Krasimir interview, Irakli gave me your number. And he said, this is the WhatsApp number that he reaches you. I saved it as it is. And I also call you.
SPEAKER_02: It didn't connect. I don't know what was it. Probably, Irakli has the older number. I'll give you the newer one. Oh, okay. Okay. Yeah. You somehow, you get the email, right? That's how you get the... Yeah, yeah, yeah. I did. From there, you can send me. Yeah, yeah. Yep. So, how do you see right now, Kornike,
SPEAKER_00: levan do you see him all alone uh well uh i i've met him when he came back from king of the table uh and we talked during that time uh i haven't talked with him since uh live but i talked with him on the phone um overall his his resting is taking his time visiting some local tv shows uh doing the interviews
SPEAKER_02: So yeah, at the moment he is more relaxed than in the rest of the moment. Yeah, when I say all alone, he seems untouchable. From one side it is an honor, but from one side it is a little boring. You need something to push you. Well, that's definitely true, but we also have to consider examples from other sports.
SPEAKER_00: When you have a clear greatest player in the game, it brings so much potential to the sport and so much new attention that people know who to focus on and who's the greatest and who can challenge him. That's also very interesting. I agree that the playground changes a bit. It's hard to find the worthy opponent, but now they have a clear target. They will train, they know who is the top guy and they will do their best. So it also brings the motivation up.
SPEAKER_02: yes yes yes it will it will it will push them to push their limits that's how it will be yeah exactly exactly exactly it will take time uh but definitely the overall the sport will go forward and i really hope that we will have uh good matches uh upcoming yeah i i have been in contact with gennady because of the east versus west and he is yes
SPEAKER_02: You know, he saw the award that we are going to give for the title matches. You know, it's a helmet with a shield. And he said, okay. I've heard about it. It's a great idea. Yeah, yeah. He said, it is mine. I said, you need to win three title matches. I said, you have Jerry. You need to beat him. And then you need to beat Hermes. But who is the third one? He said, Levan.
SPEAKER_02: and yeah looks like i mean that what what makes me happy about it is that i mean no fear nothing you know just like yeah all forward no reverse nothing of course yeah yeah he's a great guy yeah yeah yeah he's a he's a great fighter he's a great guy and uh if he puts the goal i'm sure that he will he will do everything to reach it yeah people are asking where is levan uh friends i
SPEAKER_02: and Tornike, we just deceived you. He's not coming. Yeah. So we just wanted to have some, uh, crowdy, you know, chat. So that is, we said, you know, why Levan is gonna come. Sorry about it. You know, joking aside, I think anytime he's gonna come. He's not late. It's exactly 10 o'clock. Yep. And let him be a little bit late. He's the, he's the superstar now, so it's okay.
SPEAKER_00: Let me ping him also. So Tony K, are you an armwrestler? No, I wouldn't say so. I train, but I train mostly for powerlifting and for more basic barbell movements. Are you a fan or just a friend of an armwrestler or something?
SPEAKER_00: yeah yeah yeah i'm a fan of arm wrestling i've been watching it for i don't know 10 years now uh so quite a while i have tried arm wrestling on the table with the official rules just for fun one guy is asking when is east versus west it is august 6th my friend um i'm sure that uh the moderators will will share the
SPEAKER_00: uh link how to purchase a purchase uh pay-per-view well how how do you see east versus west you see you you does it excite you of course i i have watched each of them from the beginning from the first one uh each of the cards were were perfect so entertaining the whole day of fun yeah yeah four or five hours
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I haven't missed any of the events and this upcoming one, I think it's one of the greatest. It has fun matches, it has interesting matches, it has title matches. What else can you wish for? Yeah, I consider myself as a bridge between the fans and their dreams. And their dreams are these elite athletes. But I can't focus on a handful of athletes that are
SPEAKER_02: a lot of other ones that, you know, they need to be brought to attention of the fans so that they can have a richer arena to watch. Yeah. That is how I think that we need to, we can't always think of today. We need to plant seeds for tomorrow as well. That is why I'm trying to bring the absolute best ones and the ones that are just coming, you know.
SPEAKER_02: So that now whenever I said like match for Zurab, like I can tell you that 99% of the people from the West didn't know who he was. So now when you say Zurab, they know who he is. The same applies to the Revaz and the Samushia, all of them. Of course that, you know, some Kaldraks and with time, you know, when everything is okay, hopefully when the war ends, you know, the Russian,
SPEAKER_00: athletes and so there are a lot of a lot of uh arm masters that you know deserve to be at the main stage and that is what i try to do um definitely and you're great doing a great job um you're bringing so many new names to the spotlight and it's overall uh i think it's best for everyone it's better it's good for fans it's good good for the athletes
SPEAKER_02: And the event level is only going up and up. And I definitely think that this should go on. And we will try to support as much as possible. Thank you. Thank you. So this is what you are doing right now. After donating $120 on GoFundMe, are you guys reaching out, everyone separately? You will have an automatic message you will receive. And then you will receive an email address
SPEAKER_02: to send your address to receive the t-shirt. You write to that email address that we are gonna provide. And then you will also receive your pay-per-view code. The reason that we do this way, my friend, because GoFundMe, we can run in my country. GoFundMe, so Chance Shaw is helping me, but I don't want him to deal with everyone.
SPEAKER_02: he's he only open and helping me but i i want to do the job you know uh that that to you know give the address pay-per-view code and this and that so he's gonna give you an email address soon and then you will start receiving your pay-per-view uh codes and then the ones that you know received under 20 or more they will um also receive the t-shirt after they are signed in the competition
SPEAKER_02: Hello Lewan, can you turn to the side way my friend? Yes, thank you, thank you. Hello, hello. Hello. The king is here. I'm fine my friend, I'm fine, yeah. It's good to see you after such a
SPEAKER_02: stressful period that, you know, it finally ended. Yeah. Yeah. So how have you been? Are you right now totally resting or are you a little bit training as well? No, no, totally resting. Totally resting. And how long you will rest? Maybe, maybe two, two months. Two months you will rest, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah. You will do any kind of cardio, anything or not at all? Maybe I'm starting a little bit, but I need the rest, not physically, but mentally. Mentally, yeah, I understand, yeah. Yes, one minute. Yeah. I mean, it is impossible to arm wrestle with Devon and not to be tired mentally, you know.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yes, yes. And stronger you are, bigger pressure Devon puts on you. And that is probably as hard as the physical challenge against Devon. I'm back, sorry. Yeah, so Levon, I was saying that that is the thing when you arm wrestle with Devon, it is,
SPEAKER_03: hard mentally as much as physically it may be maybe mentally even harder huh um
SPEAKER_03: Basically, the training has been quite rough for Levan preparing for the match. As many know, he was
SPEAKER_00: shooting a movie, playing a role. He, of course, tried to do some training during the production of the movie, but here and there. Then all the trash talking and hiatus started, which, to be honest, became quite annoying to Levant because it was repetitive, always around the same topic.
SPEAKER_00: So he was mostly mentally tired from this repetitive overall revisiting the topic again and again. So that's why he wants to take a break mentally in the first place. Yeah, he is not used to getting involved in such thing. I think that anyone who never pulled Devon is used to, you know, in such stress, you know.
SPEAKER_02: I mean, I'm not saying bad, but Devon is a master guy about, you know, those mental things, you know. So... This is Devon's unique story, but it's very different from Devon's. It's very different from Devon's, but it's very different from Devon's, but it's very different from Devon's, but it's very different from Devon's, but it's very different from Devon's, but it's very different from Devon's, but it's very different from Devon's, but it's very different from Devon's, but it's very different from Devon's, but it's very different from Devon's, but it's very different from Devon's, but it's very different from Devon's,
SPEAKER_03: Of course, it has its own ups and downs and it might be sometimes annoying for the opponent, but he thinks that overall for the sport, probably it's beneficial.
SPEAKER_02: since it brings more eyes to the sport, more attention. So overall, he thinks it was a benefit. Can you ask him, has there been a time that he thought that maybe he would lose? Because I kind of know this. I think it's no, because even when I talked with him privately, he was confident. He was confident. But has there been a time that we don't know that
SPEAKER_03: . . . . .
SPEAKER_03: That's why I thought that this song would be a secret for me. I don't know what I'm going to do with it. Well, I think Deon is very motivated to work hard and reach a new level. Because now all of my private records are going to be released everywhere.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, he got really motivated during the preparation. He thinks that also probably Devon's games played a role in this, that it pushed him even further. He made a personal recommendation
SPEAKER_00: hurts in all of the movements and he feels like he definitely unlocked the new level of power for him. So for himself, he made this match really important and he got really motivated. That's why he didn't even foresee the lose as the option. So he was motivated to the maximum. He didn't even wanted to think of losing this match.
SPEAKER_02: So probably all these mind games played a positive role in terms of his motivation. Yeah, yeah. I mean, if you are weak-minded, those kind of mind games make you weaker. If you are strong-minded, then it just makes you more aggressive, more strong in mind. Levan, you were a heavy favourite before the match. Very heavy. Everybody said that you were going to win.
SPEAKER_02: people were thinking that if Devon can win one round or no, you know, they were until Todd Hutchings beat Irakli in Istanbul. And after that, people started to make calculation. They said, oh, Irakli sometimes gives problem to Levan and Todd trained with Devon in Canada. And he said that he's just like,
SPEAKER_02: 50% stronger than last time you saw him. So people start to make calculation. And after that, the poll results change in Devon's favor. David it have any kind of effect on you, that kind of touch? I think it was a big priority. It wasn't easy at all. The goal was to get a maximum of one round in Devon. But when Irakli came to Tatarstan,
SPEAKER_00: Are we online?
SPEAKER_01: some connection problems but you see me right well oh yeah i do i think it's on the one side yeah
SPEAKER_00: As a friend of Levan, you probably followed those times. David it have any kind of effect on you? Well, to be honest, it didn't change my opinion at all. Because I know that the training for Levan is all different ballpark than he prepares for the main match. So not for me.
SPEAKER_03: Let's hear the last. Levan, you don't understand the question? .
SPEAKER_03: Yes, of course, there is some logic in it. There is, of course, some logic. But after that, Tevon put me at a very high level. And he was very kind to me. And he was very kind to me in the sense that he helped me a lot. I would say that he was very kind to me. Of course, there was logic in it.
SPEAKER_03: So basically, he was really surprised.
SPEAKER_00: and impressed by the way Todd Hutchings handled that match. And indeed, he thought that maybe Devin is quite impressive at the moment. So he says that such a logic from the fans could be reasonable. He understands why many fans thought that way.
SPEAKER_00: And for him also, he understood that Devin, it's not a joke. He is in an impressive shape. So as a result for Levan, it was just more motivation to keep on training, to keep on improving. As for Irakli, he thinks that he had made mistakes both in preparation for the match and during the match. And he thinks that if this match repeats sometime in the future,
SPEAKER_02: Irakli should bring a better result, and he thinks that he can win this match in the future. I understand. Yeah, I understand. I want to say that round one, Levan, when you go for fully outside attack Devon's hand, you came to do pin, but it was just like barely.
SPEAKER_02: And round two, you went more sideways. Am I correct?
SPEAKER_03: In the first round, you started from the beginning and there was a short interval in the beginning. In the second round, you started from the beginning, right? Yes, yes. In the first round, I started from the beginning. I didn't want to lose my emotions. I didn't want to lose my technique.
SPEAKER_03: On the other hand, it was clear that he was going to leave the country, and that he was not going to leave the country for the first time, and that he was going to leave the country for the first time, and that he was going to leave the country for the first time, and that he was going to leave the country for the first time, and that he was going to leave the country for the first time, and that he was going to leave the country for the first time,
SPEAKER_03: I think it was something like that. I think it was something like that. I think it was something like that. I think it was something like that. I think it was something like that. I think it was something like that. I think it was something like that. I think it was something like that. I think it was something like that.
SPEAKER_00: During the first match, indeed, he went more on the outside and probably he was more emotional and nervous during the first round. And he is not happy with the technical execution. He could have done better. And indeed, in the second round, he went more inside and with full power and more focused.
SPEAKER_00: And Devin just couldn't handle it anymore. In the first round, he felt that he reached the pad and it was definitely a win. But he also felt the pause at the end. So he could definitely see it. And also he watched the video multiple times. And maybe it was something after the hand touched the pad. I think three times. One time came.
SPEAKER_00: didn't call one more time and then three times and then they they hold but i saw three pins but those pins were not like this it was just like barely yeah yeah yeah and also levan says that overall uh his first rounds in the super matches are usually like that with vitaly with other super matches he probably blames the nerves because of this the emotions
SPEAKER_02: and he has to adjust to make the technique perfect for the... Yeah, my opinion is that I think it is not sure about the nerves, but it's about the choosing the wrong way. With Vitaly, he wanted to go sideways, but Vitaly applied low hand to his little finger, so he couldn't go, so he switched outside. Here, first he tried outside, and second he tried the side pressure. It was just, you know,
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it was too strong, the side pressure. But it was not full side pressure, but a little bit outer with pronation side pressure. It was very effective, yeah. Anyway, so Levan, people, majority of the people, people who knows arm wrestling, I'm talking about, majority thinks that you are the strongest arm wrestler who has ever lived. I know from your side, it is not, it may not sound humble,
SPEAKER_00: to say such thing, but with the objective eyes, do you also agree that you are the strongest army officer who has ever lived till now? There are many people who think that I am the strongest army officer in the world. Yes, there are many people who think that I am the strongest army officer in the world. Yes, there are many people who think that I am the strongest army officer in the world. Yes, there are many people who think that I am the strongest army officer in the world. Yes, there are many people who think that I am the strongest army officer in the world. Yes, there are many people who think that I am the strongest army officer in the world. Yes, there are many people who think that I am the strongest army officer in the world. Yes, there are many people who think that I am the strongest army officer in the world.
SPEAKER_03: I don't know what to say about that, but it's not a big deal. That's what I would like to say. Thank you. Anyway, this is a series of films that I have been working on for a long time, and this is not something that I would like to say to anyone else.
SPEAKER_03: Zloty Turi, Marjwina Martschena, Mdzi Mmea, Meri Apsoli Turi, Meri Dabrunevul, who won the European Championship, Isseni Tsmoyegos, who is a player, and then there was Isseni Tsmoyegos, who won in 2000, and then there was a series of players, there was Bruce Coyne.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, he thinks that probably Engin is the best expert in the world to judge this and probably he knows the best from his standpoint.
SPEAKER_00: Looking at it statistically, he can't remember any other armwrestler who has such a clean sweep of victories altogether. Also, considering that he participated in the Zloty Tour, won it in the heavyweight and absolute, both right and left hands, then went back to the World and Europe Championship,
SPEAKER_00: wanted also on both hands and then the series of the uh super matches so uh in those uh statistic points of view he can't remember any other arm wrestler with such a statistic maybe engen could tell here uh but yeah he looks at it like with i mean i i look at it not only because of that i look at it how dominant he is you understand whenever he beat
SPEAKER_02: Turubi in a super match, Lewand wasn't this strong. It was lower Lewand, still beat him. And at that time, Turubi in time to time caused problems to Pushkar as a lot of Turubi. Rest in peace. But now, Lewand that I see now, if Lewand, was it 2017 or 18, 18, right? 2018, when you beat Turubi, Lewand.
SPEAKER_02: If Levan is here, now Levan I see here. So it is just totally different Levan that we see. And I don't know. I don't know. For me, this is the best, strongest guy I have ever seen. Nobody in the history can be. It's my opinion. But again, no disrespect, being the strongest and most dominant in the super, everything,
SPEAKER_02: and being goats are not exactly the same thing, you know, like John Bersink being 90 kilo, 100 kilo and still being absolute best for many years, you know, is different than Levan being super heavyweight and beating super heavyweight different. So, but Levan is, I mean, on his way to be considered in that conversation, even though John is clear the goat. And I want to ask,
SPEAKER_02: Levan, like, if it was possible to do this, I know it's not possible, but I will give you names. John Brzing of 2006, Alexey Voivoda of 2004, and best shape of Pushkar, best shape of Deniz, best shape of Alankarev. If it was possible in their best shape, who, you know, out of these five,
SPEAKER_03: would you would want to pull? Or who would be the toughest opponent for you in your opinion? Well,
SPEAKER_03: John was the only one in the team. He was the only one in the sport. So, it was hard for me. David you have a strong opponent? John or... Strong? I think I had a strong opponent. I don't think I had a strong opponent. You had a strong opponent.
SPEAKER_00: Levan definitely agrees with you about John being the greatest of all time. From the interesting point, he would definitely love to pull the strongest version of John Brzenk. It would be an honor to him and it would be really interesting. As for when I asked who would have been the toughest opponent, he said probably none of them.
SPEAKER_02: I love his confidence. I love his confidence. That's okay. It's not just his mind. He's just saying that is how he needs to believe because he made his mind up. About two years ago, we had an interview with him. I, Coach Ray, Yanis, and Levan. He said his dream is to have a career as a professional with losing no rounds against anyone. So if he has that kind of dream,
SPEAKER_02: on his mind, he needs to like, remember, I was like 65 kilo guy, and then I was competing European championships, winning easy. Evgeny when I see Alan Carrer, 180 kilo, he would kill me. But whenever I look at him, I was thinking, you know, okay, if I pull him, how would I, where would I hit? Where should I attack? Evgeny if I was doing that, of course, Levan, at the level he is, I mean, he should be feeling like Terminator, you know, just like no chance for anyone.
SPEAKER_03: That's what I wanted to say. Well, it's been a long time since I've been here. It's been a long time since I've been here.
SPEAKER_03: I think it's very interesting to think about how the project was created. When you were in the 2000s, 2000s, and then in your 20s, how do you think, how was it created and how did you create it?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, Levane agrees with you and definitely honors all of the five great athletes that you mentioned. All of them had their great time periods, even though John probably had the longest one and always have been great.
SPEAKER_00: And Levan wants to ask you, how do you think has the level of our wrestling has changed throughout the years? How would you compare 2000 to 2010 and maybe now? Would you say that it has changed, increased or decreased the overall level? Yeah, I will say something like this. I am a believer. Okay, I will answer this, but it will not be so short. I'm a believer that special people
SPEAKER_02: can come in any decade. It is not up to the calendar if it is 2020 or if it is 1989. Special people, special people. There is no, in my opinion, there is no exercise outside of the table is better than the coordination you can get at the table. For me, the best exercise is the table exercise if you know how to do coordination.
SPEAKER_02: So in my opinion, there are so many things. You hold the handle, you do this, and you do pronation, right? I mean, it does not perfectly apply at the table. At the table, everything is, if you have many different training partners, different hands, different arm size, and if you are competing all over the world with different hands in different directions, there is no better machine.
SPEAKER_02: than a human being who is armwrestling great level. So what I'm just saying that John, the way that he understand armwrestling, the way that he performs and the way that he was competitive all over the world, he had the best training for armwrestling. So what I just tried to say that just because it is 2023,
SPEAKER_02: it doesn't mean that you hold a belt or a rubber band here you do this it makes you better arm master than what john used to have you understand all over the world the guy pulled richard lucas clevedine gary goodrich alan kare pushcard dennis this and that you know so um what for me the judgment of the progress is what you do at the table so what i just tried to say that special people
SPEAKER_02: came in 80s 90s 2000 2010 you know but i agree with him if he says that number of the elite pullers today is more than pests but i cannot say that today a 75 kilo guy would be 2007 arsenal at 75 kilo in my opinion you bring 2007 arsenal just put today it would kill them
SPEAKER_02: You bring Haji Murad Zola of 2007, just bring today again Sherka Zola, it would kill him, my opinion. So I am just saying that, but today more armless. In the past, Levan, if for medal, there was three, four guys in each category. Now in each category, I talk about WAF, there is 10 guys that can get medal. So more guys, I agree about that one. But about super heavyweight, I think today is more progress.
SPEAKER_02: And I have never seen, this is not because I'm saying to your face, Levan, I have never seen a super heavyweight like you. You are very technical. The way that you are arm resting is as smooth as a lightweight. I say lightweight because in lightweight, they are like, you know, crazy technical. But you are very, very technical guy.
SPEAKER_02: You are fast. You are well rounded. I have seen you doing shoulder pressure. I have seen you do hook. I have seen you do side pressure, top roll. And the way that you do is very high level. And the electric you have at the stage is also like a lightweight. You are just, I mean,
SPEAKER_02: like i know i'm small guy but even if i was a big guy i wouldn't want to be front of you at the other side of the table just oh you know so what i'm just saying you are an exception you are an exception but again just look at levan 58 years old jumbo zinc look what he is doing today imagine that guy at 30 years 35 years you understand so he was also special but i am saying that he was not
SPEAKER_02: i don't think he could do something this is different the guy is 100 kilo guy you are your bigger guy he couldn't do much some people things that he could in my opinion he couldn't i i am i 100 believe that you are the strongest uh arm master ever and i hope somebody comes that can be a good challenge for you
SPEAKER_03: Right now, I'm thinking maybe a bigger Gasparini, I think he's doing better. I'm just pushing myself, not that he can be... Yeah, I have an interest with Gasparini, because we're not cool. I mean, we're not good at sparring.
SPEAKER_03: It is very interesting for me. In this regard, it is very interesting for me, because I don't know how to say it, I don't know how to say it. I don't know how to say it. I don't know how to say it. I don't know how to say it. I don't know how to say it. I don't know how to say it. I don't know how to say it.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, he finds Gasparini to be... Just one thing. One guy says here that Levan is not even close to being one of the best armwrestlers in the world. He is number one because of strength. He is number one because of strength, but trust me and don't teach me of armwrestling. Understand? Don't... I mean, I know what I'm talking about. I give all my life. I train not only because I have won double-digit number of world championships. I also train more than 10 world champions.
SPEAKER_00: know arm wrestling that guy is for super heavyweight he's very very very very good arm master my friend yeah just okay you go yeah yeah definitely uh no levan said that gasparini is probably the most interesting match for him at the moment uh he has never pulled with him even in during the after pool or for training uh so that's why he finds this match to be
SPEAKER_00: the most interesting because it's some kind of a mystery and new to him it's a new challenge so at the moment he thinks that this match would be the most interesting for him considering all the all the information that he has and most probably that match will happen sometime yeah i i think i think that next month we will see la latin versus uh slayer that match will give us an idea slave beat
SPEAKER_02: If this happens again, we will realize that it is not because of a one-time thing and Slayer is better. But if LaLatin beats him, then he will secure his place, you know, somewhere up there, you know. And I saw their last training video, LaLatin was better than Slayer. But I'm sure the Slayer will go in a different shape. Yeah, there are a few guys. Yeah. And yeah, I think Hermes Gasparini for sure, one of them. And I talk with Hermes.
SPEAKER_02: uh privately as well hermes wants to pull levan he's he's serious about it yeah he doesn't mean he's gonna win but he is serious to face him so um i have another question for you levan are you here levan uh i think you went offline but uh probably he will join soon back um
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, that is, that is, yeah. These are, these are Devon, John, LeJuan. I mean, you may have different favorite athletes, but you don't need to bring them down or throw shit. You know, you can just say as much as they deserve, you know. For me, like Devon is one of the, I always say this, one of the top 10 guy
SPEAKER_02: greatest of all time list, you know. I mean, like, I would give him that one. But when you say greatest of all time, then I go different opinion. When you say the strongest of all time, different opinion. Okay, Levan, has any arm master inspired you? When you are becoming a best arm master from the beginning to the top, has any arm master inspired you internationally or locally in Georgia?
SPEAKER_00: David you have an example?
SPEAKER_03: Yes, of course. He was a very good player. He was a very good player. Pauline Jones was a very good player. He was a very good player. Pauline Jones was a very good player.
SPEAKER_03: That's what I wanted to say. I wanted to tell you that I think you will find the answers to your own questions. One more thing. John was a great motivator for me. If you don't know John,
SPEAKER_03: Me, my father, my mother, my father, my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother, my mother,
SPEAKER_03: I was very happy and I was very happy. I don't want to say that it was very bad. It was very bad. I don't want to say that it was very bad.
SPEAKER_03: If you want to do it, you have to do it, and that's the way it is. It's not easy to do it, and it's not easy to do it, and it's not easy to do it, and it's not easy to do it, and it's not easy to do it, and it's not easy to do it, and it's not easy to do it, and it's not easy to do it, and it's not easy to do it, and it's not easy to do it, and it's not easy to do it, and it's not easy to do it, and it's not easy to do it, and it's not easy to do it, and it's not easy to do it, and it's not easy to do it,
SPEAKER_03: So right from the beginning, when he just started to train, he watched the Pulling John movie. It inspired him a lot, got him fired up.
SPEAKER_00: when he watched how John Brzenk, Voivoda, how they all pulled together, Travis Bajent. And this really inspired him to become an arm wrestler, to get to their level, to really become great in the sport. So he would say that probably John Brzenk was the most motivational and example for him.
SPEAKER_00: But he would also like to add that probably unlike John, he always tried to get as dominant and as powerful as possible. So to reach the high weight, of course, with the quality and to gain mass in terms of also having the strength in terms of arm wrestling. Probably maybe if John could have gone up the weight class, he could have
SPEAKER_00: probably flashed everyone he has ever had a match with. So probably he took all the best examples from John, but also he says that from his standpoint, he always wanted to strive for being the most dominant that he can within his weight class. Yeah. So he wanted to be himself, but at the beginning, he inspired him. But as of now, he is on his own way. You know, this is what I understand.
SPEAKER_02: In your opinion, who is number two in the world? And if you are not sure, which match needs to happen to determine the number two in the world?
SPEAKER_03: This is the second time I've been here, and I'm very happy to be here, because there are a lot of people who want to come.
SPEAKER_03: It is a very difficult situation. Many people have lost their jobs, they have lost their jobs, they have lost their jobs, they have lost their jobs, they have lost their jobs, they have lost their jobs, they have lost their jobs, they have lost their jobs, they have lost their jobs, they have lost their jobs, they have lost their jobs, they have lost their jobs, they have lost their jobs, they have lost their jobs, they have lost their jobs,
SPEAKER_03: I would like to say that this is a very serious situation. If you look at it, the first, second, and third generations are living in this situation.
SPEAKER_03: At that moment, it was clear to me that Vitaly Laletin would be the second to be elected, and Sileima Mougo, who would probably be the last one to be elected. It was clear to me then that he would not be elected. Genadi Mougo, David Chaffee, who was elected by a lot of people,
SPEAKER_03: There was a resolution that Berot Maglamuris was very proud of, and it is very important, and I think there is a concrete plan for this year. There will be a tournament, and there will be some kind of competition with the NDP, and there will be some kind of competition in the year, and I think that this will help us.
SPEAKER_03: He can say exactly a concrete name and overall he thinks that it's really hard to tell because there are a lot of great guys who are developing but also there are there have been
SPEAKER_00: a lot of unexpected losses during the last period. Nobody expected for, for example, to see live to be the Latin who was considered to be number two at the time. And maybe because of the long pause, maybe it was considered around somewhere around the 10th place. Nobody probably expected Genadi to beat Dave Chaffee considering the rankings.
SPEAKER_00: And overall, he thinks that there is no one match to answer this question. And probably and definitely there is a need for either a tournament or more matches to happen. And probably East versus West could be could be a great place to find this out.
SPEAKER_00: But there are definitely a lot of questions to be answered here because of these unexpected losses. So he definitely sees a need for such matches to happen. I understand. I will ask him, Levan, is it true that I heard something, I don't know if it's true or not, but if you cannot find enough competition in super heavyweight,
SPEAKER_02: Is it true that you will go down to 110 kilo? Joking, joking. So let's little bit talk about East versus West matches and then we finish Levan. I will ask your opinions about, you know, the matches that you would have, you know, you want to have opinion, give your opinion.
SPEAKER_02: first of all before everything do you think Revaz with really serious serious training have potential to be good enough to someday face you for a title match yeah yeah yeah so the guy has the potential he only needs to pay the pay the price right
SPEAKER_03: Yes, very big potential.
SPEAKER_03: There is no doubt that he will win the European Championship. He has a lot of potential. He is capable of anything.
SPEAKER_03: Revaz has a great potential.
SPEAKER_00: Evgeny though he had a long period of inactivity, he has been training. And when we saw his victory against Michael Todd, this showed us that he's a great candidate. He can do a long fight. He's a fighter. And overall, if he continues competing, he can fight with anybody.
SPEAKER_02: his potential is unlimited in that regard. I understand. So I want to ask you, Levan, each match, Jerry versus Genadi? No, no chance for Jerry, I think. No, no chance. No chance? No. I understand. Yeah. And Dave Chaffee versus Artem Morozov? No.
SPEAKER_03: I think Dave. You think Dave is going to win? Yeah. I understand. And Derek versus Revaz? Oh, Revaz 100%. I think Derek is not that level who can fight with Revaz. Yeah, but did you see Derek's match with Tim Bresnan?
SPEAKER_03: Yes, but I think he's not trying to like the profession, you know. He's trying... He's not trying to be a professional, he's not trying to be a professional. He's not trying to be a professional. He's not trying to be a professional. He's not trying to be a professional. He's not trying to be a professional. He's not trying to be a professional. He's not trying to be a professional. He's not trying to be a professional. He's not trying to be a professional. He's not trying to be a professional. He's not trying to be a professional. He's not trying to be a professional. He's not trying to be a professional. He's not trying to be a professional. He's not trying to be a professional. He's not trying to be a professional. He's not trying to be a professional. He's not trying to be a professional. He's not trying to be a professional. He's not trying to be a professional. He's not trying to be a professional. He's not trying to
SPEAKER_03: Derek has a great potential. He has shown this many times, but from Levan's standpoint, he's a bit inconsistent in his training.
SPEAKER_00: And probably that's his weakest point, that he should put more emphasis on training and getting the consistency in his shape. But other than that, he sees the great potential in Derek. Yeah, but do you realize that, Derek,
SPEAKER_02: uh some match was canceled and derek was last minute uh replacement he came here like with maximum one week training and then he rested another week or 10 days or something so last time we saw him here he was noticed like less than 20 days you know i told him like would you come so he was not really in super shape
SPEAKER_02: now he's training you know oh yeah he said that right now he is in his like from that time to today he has been training non-stop training so but the only thing is only thing is that there was also training because when michael and ravel's pool rivers came here with two months training and now ravers will have another two and a half months so i think that ravers will not be the same ravers either you know i think that was is also yeah that is the thing you know
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I would say that, you know, it could be something, you know, yeah, but let's see. Also, how do you see, do you know Kody Merritt? This Australian guy? No, no, no, Kody Merritt from United States with left arm, very strong left arm. I don't know. Maybe I know, but I don't know names. Maybe when I see him, I know, but don't really know.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah. And do you know Bozhidar Simeonov? Yeah. And Bozhidar Samushia under 85 kilo. How do you see that match? 85 kilo? Close match? I don't know. But I will ask you something, Levan. Like, what is that level of that match? It's like highest level possible, right? In 85 kilo.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it's close for Heist, yes. No, no, I mean, who is in 80, 85 kilos better than those guys in the world? Those are the best guys under 80 kilos.
SPEAKER_03: Unfortunately, because of the lack of tournaments like Zloty Tur,
SPEAKER_00: It has become probably, unfortunately for the lower weight categories, it has become hard to tell exactly who is the strongest and who are the new names. But probably Engin's tournament is dealing with this now and maybe we can find the answer.
SPEAKER_03: But I would like to say that I am very happy to be able to participate in such a big tournament. I think a lot of things will happen.
SPEAKER_03: This is a very important thing, but from this point of view, I think that Sabolov's goal is very important. It is very important for him to be in the game. It is very important for him to be in the game. It is very important for him to be in the game. It is very important for him to be in the game.
SPEAKER_00: uh lebanon thinks that overall uh the east versus western tournament uh tournament is really great uh but uh it would uh maybe be more uh beneficial or it would answer more questions if all the matches were uh made in like the tournament so uh the winners tournament there is draw factors
SPEAKER_02: sometimes two best guys run one kill each other kill each other and then somebody guy and beats him you know i think no no i i say uh tournament like top eight maybe top 16. oh i understand but top eight is also we are doing something like top eight here i mean we let the guys pull
SPEAKER_03: And then the winners, next time they pull, you know, it's his name, it's not Tafi, but the winners are pulling each other. I see.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe as an advice, it would be good to have like a visual structure of who won who and who is meeting in the future, just like a tournament tree.
SPEAKER_00: of ones who won, ones who lost, just to have this maybe more hierarchical tournament-style visual of the rankings. I mean, tournament? You mean like double elimination tournaments? Yes, I mean like double elimination tournaments. Yes, I mean like double elimination tournaments.
SPEAKER_03: In other words, it's like a graphic that shows that it's broken and now it's broken, right? And it shows that it can be repaired, that it's not broken. So, I think it's important for sports fans to know that it's like this, that it's broken, it can be repaired, and it's like this, that it's not broken, right? Right?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, he means to have the same matches as you already have, but just super matches, but to have them more structured and visual so opponents can know who they might meet in the future. Yeah, but I don't know that way, but I have rankings. The more I will do the matches, I'm making rankings, who is number one, number two, number three. But I need to do more matches, more matches. But for now, I know.
SPEAKER_02: David Samushia is the world champion, one previous world champion. And Bozhidar Simeonov is the latest world champion. Like the last world championship, Bozhidar won. Won before, David won. But David couldn't compete the last because Georgia is banned by WAF. So that is why they couldn't compete. So this is the last two years world champion pulling each other. And from 55 kilo to 90 kilo, all the best guys in the world are in WAF.
SPEAKER_02: when you go above 90 kilo then some involve some there some there some there so that is how i do until 90 kilo i try to choose the waffle like i did cherkasov versus yusuf cherkasov is 70 kilo world champion you should be 65 kilo world champion like for example now we will have oleg zog versus dadikyan and then we will have oleg zog versus alijan murado in
SPEAKER_02: November event. So don't worry, Levan, I'm doing rankings, and then, you know, once they have the title, and then someone else will be invited. And I would like to ask you, Levan, a few more, like, how do you see John Brzenk versus Ongar Bayev match? Ongar Bayev and Robert Pormashchiyat.
SPEAKER_03: I don't know if I will be able to do it in the future or not. But I think I will be able to do it in the future. Because, as I said before, there are a lot of people who are interested in Hungarian music.
SPEAKER_00: Ongarbaev had a long break, so it's probably hard to tell the exact shape of his. He would probably say that John Brzenk is a favorite, since because of this break, it's hard to gauge how strong Ongarbaev is today. I understand. But you know, he has been away, John also has been away for six years. Is that a cat? What's that?
SPEAKER_02: i think it's a dog you also need a bigger one for the garden that one a big one we need to give you one kangal you know kangal oh yeah they are from turkey very big dog very nice friendly dog shepherd yeah
SPEAKER_02: Also, another important one, and then we can finish. We don't want to take you so long. Prudnik versus Tata Cings. I think this is the best match. It's the best match? I think it is the best match.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, when Tatashins pulled, exactly he was 100 kilos. Yesterday, Tatashins and Prudnik were my guests. I asked him, he was 105 kilos. So he was five kilos heavier. Yeah. Close match? I still think Prudnik. Yeah, but just remember the match will be 107 kilos.
SPEAKER_00: under seven kilo limits uh-huh uh yeah he still thinks that prudnik will be able to top roll him top roll him do you think that eleven top rolling touchings alone is solution to beat him
SPEAKER_03: He thinks the best solution is going without the strap and with the fast top roll is the best solution to beat the touchings.
SPEAKER_02: I understand. Levan, do you believe that when you, like, for example, when you right now meet the number two guy in the world, and then there is a world title given to you, you don't think that like in the professional, like in boxing, we have amateur boxing or the fighting, we have amateur ones, you know, there is tournaments. But whenever it is professional,
SPEAKER_00: then it needs to be a one-on-one supermatch, correct?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, he doesn't know exactly how it is, for example, in boxing, but he thinks...
SPEAKER_02: mike tyson just say you know muhammad ali for a month they compete at tournaments or they just do a title match one-on-one they do whenever it's professional like habib and then mcgregor right they don't compete they come in amateur yes it's tournament but whenever it's professional yeah you you bring the number one ranked guy yeah they competed this match
SPEAKER_03: It's not tournament, you don't do tournament because... On the title match, I think, one match. Yeah. Title match, yes. This is... I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
SPEAKER_00: He thinks that title matches are very important in terms of sports popularity and it should be one-on-one since it's a more entertaining format. He's saying that to become a professional world champion, it needs to be a one-on-one match.
SPEAKER_02: But in amateur, you cannot do it in one match. Because in amateur, from 50 countries, people come, 1,500 arm wrestlers. How are you going to do that? Of course, it's going to be tournament. In amateur, as a base, there can be world championship tournament as well. But whenever you want to make the absolute best one, you bring the number one guy against someone number two, number three, whatever. They do the title match.
SPEAKER_02: you know if you say that you know you don't become a world champion but that event in my opinion needs to be big enough to offer enough of super matches and invite everyone to be open everyone so that they can determine the best ones you know that is that is uh what i believe anyways last question to levan is uh you see this competitive we saw levan even in a tv show beating a woman enormously
SPEAKER_02: So, I see that he's obsessed about winning enormously. So, is he this obsessed about winning in his life, about everything, or only enormously? As far as I understand, you're a perfectionist, aren't you? Yes, I'm a perfectionist.
SPEAKER_03: And my business has a very large amount of work and money. I can't say for sure.
SPEAKER_03: Well, in reality, I would like to say that I have been a champion since I was a child, and I have had a lot of opportunities, and I have been able to do a lot of things. This is the reason why I am very happy, and I am very happy that I have been able to do what I wanted to do.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, he's very determined. He has very determined character. He can work for a long time and be patient to reach the goal. And probably that's why he was able to reach this level. During his career, he has seen many losses, many disappointments, and he has been through all. But he thinks that his determination, his consistency,
SPEAKER_02: uh his ability to work and put in the work uh uh brought him what he has is it limited to arm wrestling or about everything he does is he is that obsessed or winning in everything okay i understand yeah yeah yeah there was one super chat uh suyan java karen
SPEAKER_02: Engin, please ask Levan, after winning against Devon the fifth round, why didn't he give away six rounds as a consolation for Devon? But I think we all know the answer because he said that he will never lose a round in his professional career. Is that the reason? Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: He has to keep keep the word keep the promise and overall he likes the idea of being unbeaten. So he overall does this for overall record and not for the specific
SPEAKER_02: I want to tell to guys, you know, guys, I don't know how many of you competed tournaments, world championships, super matches. I have done that for 30 years. So please stop preaching me or just because you do some ranking or something, talking like an expert, please. You have no idea. You don't determine the absolute best in a tournament format. Tournament is harder than super match. Let me preach you.
SPEAKER_02: because there are many different guys. Two guys may meet on the round one, they may kill each other, and they may be the best two. They may not ever even reach to the final. So that is different. For amateur, it is, yes, tournament. You cannot, they need to compete there. From many countries, that's how the format. It's not about only boxing or something, but if it is a combat sport,
SPEAKER_02: You determine the best guy by one-on-one match. It will not depend on the draw. It will not depend on like somebody's tiring you or somebody's injuring you and then you facing another guy who had the easy draw earlier. Trust me, you have no clue. You have no idea. One-on-one match to prove who is the better one, that is the format super match.
SPEAKER_02: Don't worry about it. Everyone will have their chances. If you are good enough, you will be invited and you will pull someone, maybe not directly the super match or the title, but you will pull someone, you will beat that guy, and then you will climb up. Eventually you will pull the super match for the title. So just please, you know, just preach somewhere else, not to me, not to me. Anyways, thank you very much, Levan. Thank you very much, Nornike.
SPEAKER_02: Levan, I wish you the best, my friend. I wish you the best. I hope you will find the opponents that will really trouble you. I cannot say that, you know, I hope that they will beat you or something. But let the better one, best one win. But I really hope that you will be pushed. And one more thing I want to ask. Is this the best Levan we saw in Dubai? Best ever could be? No, I can be better. You can be better.
SPEAKER_02: yeah so that that's the scary part that's the scary part yeah anyways thank you very very much thank you you all take care thank you thank you
