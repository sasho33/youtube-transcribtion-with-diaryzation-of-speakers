SPEAKER_02: Hello, guys. How are you guys?
SPEAKER_02: Hello, guys. How are you guys? Good to see you guys. Hello, hello, hello, everyone. Soon my guests will come. I think Raimonds is in.
SPEAKER_03: Hey, Engin. Hello, Raimonds. How are you, my friend? I'm good. I fell asleep. It's good that I woke up in time. Why? I was just tired. I just fell asleep. I'm fine.
SPEAKER_03: So, oh, we are live already. Okay, good, good. We're waiting for Artem and Dave to join. Dave, yeah. I just reached both of them and they are coming soon. Okay, good, good. Looking at videos where Ryan was destroying his elbow. I was like, thank you, sir. Thank you, you're a great job.
SPEAKER_00: okay that that was interesting like i have like weird muscle type it was 39 something before the training but i trained so good you will reach up to 42 something but very heavy very heavy train yeah
SPEAKER_00: just that normally three something happens when i do table time but yesterday somehow with the lifting um just i don't know how it happened somehow you exhausted the muscle you you put on so much stress on the muscle that you drain the whole dextrose and everything yeah it usually happens that way but usually do something when i train forearm
SPEAKER_00: then three something when i do very tough uh table training but i have friends like if his forearm is 36 something he trains like crazy crazy crazy table time and only helps something just changes here different type of muscle i think i think you can just that you because you can isolate it you know a lot of people cannot find the muscles they're training they just do the movement but you
SPEAKER_00: you know in your brain where it is and you can you know the same way you can contract your forearm i think you can do that with the pronator maybe not the same but mind muscle connection yeah um thank you will levan be at east versus west um i invited him as a guest he said that like probably in 10 days he's gonna uh answer uh he will see like
SPEAKER_00: what is ahead of him and he would like to come. And I also invited him as an athlete for February. Let's see. I can also do the same muscle control with my leg muscle and the shoulder like I can do. I don't know, maybe everyone can do it,
SPEAKER_00: We got a movie. That is impressive. That is good motor skill control. Hello, Dave. Hello, my friend. Can you turn the camera sideways? You hear us, Dave? I hear you now. I'm good.
SPEAKER_00: Can you turn sideways your phone? Yeah. If possible. Better? Yeah. Soon your provocator opener will come as well. Let's see what his problem is. Okay. Let's see if he really means that or he is just trying to steer the pot.
SPEAKER_03: It's funny, but Morozov speaks like in, I forgot what's the word, in poems. All the time, he's like, he will tell me something, he's like, translate. I'm like, I have no idea how to translate that, man. It's like, you know. But it's, everything is so deep, you know, so. Yeah. There is one, two balls, thanks, super chat.
SPEAKER_00: and new to arm wrestling best methods to start training copying strength between table practices things i mean just go to go to voice of arm wrestling your videos about training just do any kind of forearm training just do train just train your forearms no no they need to find out the right training so you can yeah there's which channel you have two channels i think but on the voice of arm wrestling go there there are all kind of trainings
SPEAKER_00: Yannis and Raimonds, I mean, like for sure Latvia is one of the places with proven methods. Yeah. It will help you, my friend. Thank you for your support. So, Dave, how have you been, my friend? I've been good. I can't complain. Working a lot, you know, spending time with the family, obviously training for this match, you know, trying to stay young, I guess, you know. Yeah. That's good. That's good.
SPEAKER_00: um um if you beat morozo um like would you like to pull gennady just say february or something again just just to like straight the things you know like you you dominated him some years ago and then you were almost doing the same thing and you know
SPEAKER_00: and somehow you ran out of gas. Do you think that match has to happen again, one more time? I think one more time would settle the score. Yeah, I would do that. Yeah, would you want it? Like, is there in your mind that, you know, that match needs to happen? Like, since it's 1-1, or you are saying that one time I won and one time he won, so that's okay?
SPEAKER_04: It's not like a burning, it's not burning inside me that I'd have to pull them right now. I just pretty much go with the flow. You know, whatever opens up, I'll pull. I'm down for anything pretty much. I'm enjoying myself pulling. That's good. Is there anyone else that you want to pull? Like, on your mind? Oh yeah, I'd like to pull Hermes. I haven't pulled him yet. Oh yeah, you would want to pull
SPEAKER_04: And if the ban is lifted, do you wish to pull like Laletin? Absolutely, yeah. I like pulling different guys, but all the top guys, definitely. I'm down to pull anybody I haven't pulled yet. You know, I love new challenges and I'd pull anybody. And where do you see yourself right now? Are you as good as the last time we saw you here? Yeah, I'm definitely, I feel good.
SPEAKER_04: I took a little bit of, you know, about three, four weeks off because I was sore. I pulled two matches right in a row. My shoulder is a little sore. Just, you know, nothing serious. But, you know, I need some time to recover. And I'm starting to, you know, have a few weeks to start training real hard again. So I'll be ready. Yeah. And training? Training for endurance a little bit? Yeah, definitely. Definitely. Yeah, I don't want to get tired again. That was not good. So I definitely added a little more endurance for this one. So definitely it helps.
SPEAKER_00: That's the bad part about being so strong and so dominant that usually you don't need such thing, you know, and then once you need it, like you are like, okay, I have to train it. Yeah, it's not a good feeling when you're up there and all of a sudden your arm, you know, just not doing what it's supposed to do. It's definitely not a good feeling. So I don't want to be there again. No.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, you were so dominant. The first two matches, I was like, wow, this is even more dominant than last time. You know, I was like that. And then somehow then everything just turned different after that foul that, you know, there was like controversy, you know, you'd say he was losing position, not losing position, that and this.
SPEAKER_00: You know, like if you've got it at that level, you shouldn't depend on that, that, you know, you should have had enough of gas in the tank to finish the business. Don't you think so? Oh, absolutely. Yeah. You know, people talk about, you know, I could have won. I should have won a match, whatever. It's my fault for running out of gas. I can't make excuses. I should have been able to finish them a third time. And I got no one to blame but myself. So I definitely got to work on that. Dave, I have a question for you.
SPEAKER_00: do you think that the the only problem was about you to run out of gas or like at the beginning he only tried outside outside outside moments and then once he tried the book because i mean he had nowhere else to go and then that work do you think that next time when you pull him he will directly try to go there
SPEAKER_04: I just think I couldn't get him where I wanted to be during the third match. I couldn't get him where I wanted to be. My hand was kind of blown up, my form was blown up, and I just didn't have the energy to get him where I wanted to be. I think it would have been different if I wasn't blown up like I was. It would have been the same thing, but it is what it is. Yeah, I kind of felt that.
SPEAKER_00: If he tried to go outside one more time that the results like would be different than it would be 30 but that he made something differently just jump in you know. And so, that is why I was curious if it was just totally because of running out of gas and or because of that, and also because he tries something different that that's what my point was yeah.
SPEAKER_00: yeah I just think I just really think I was too tired honestly I don't think it would have been anything it would have been the same outcome I just I was just too tired unfortunately I understand I understand um Artyom can you turn the phone sideways yeah thank you how how are you how are you my good good good very good yeah yeah um
SPEAKER_00: There is one super chat before we continue. Ivan, thank you for your super chat. Engin, they want to guess out because Genadi Pryor started round three and Dave called him and was about to pin him, but Genadi elbow foul saved him so hard. Thank you for your super chat. So, Artem, you, about a little bit more than a month ago,
SPEAKER_00: you did something very uh provocative like and you yes yes you know what you did you understand even without translating so you called dave old to all and his armors are like rusty um do you believe in what you said or you were just trying to hype the events can you translate
SPEAKER_01: I don't think I need to translate it. He said, of course I believe it. Oh, you just make everything worse for my friend. I tried to save you, but even I can't save you from now on. Okay, tell him this.
SPEAKER_03: Engin wanted to save you from Dave, but now he can't do anything else. Engin asks, will you need someone to save you or will you be ready yourself?
SPEAKER_00: Well, we won't fight, we will fight. And if we fight, I won't have to save myself. He said, we're arm wrestling, we're not fighting. But if we're fighting, then I'll have some friends over. No, no. He knows what he means, what I mean. Like, is he going to back what he's speaking? Because after saying all these things, how young he is, how strong he is,
SPEAKER_03: How Dave is old, his armors are rusty, and if he comes there and loses, it's not going to look good. Tell him, please. Eugen asks, what will you do if you lose because you said that you are young, he is old. How will you feel about that?
SPEAKER_01: Well, the fact that he's older is a fact. He's older than me. If I even lose, there's nothing wrong with that. I'm still young, everything's still ahead. No, well, I really respect Dave very much. Of course, everything that was said was on purpose, to warm up the audience a little.
SPEAKER_01: so he said first the facts are straight
SPEAKER_03: Dave is older than me. I am younger than him. If he wins, I'm still young. I still can do a lot of things. And he said, of course, I said all those things just to make the match bigger. I respect, I love Dave. As much as my English allows, we can communicate, but it's for fun. But he's coming in serious shape. He's coming in serious. But that's not what he said. He didn't say, Dave, you are older than me. He said, Dave, you are too old.
SPEAKER_03: So no need to twist the world. So anyway, so he's coming there to beat David. Is this what he's saying? He said, of course, he's working on it and there's still time to get better and stronger.
SPEAKER_04: I understand. Dave, do you have any response to his words? Yeah, I mean, he may have said it or says he said it or hype it up, but he said what he said. I don't take words lightly like that. Like I said, I'm a pretty nice guy, but sometimes some little things light a fire under your ass, and that kind of lit a little fire under my ass, and it's probably not a good idea. So it gave me a little more intensity for this match.
SPEAKER_04: Um, he's right. Um, I'm old enough to be his dad probably. Um, and I was young, he's like 2024 or something like that. So, and I give him credit. He's got, he's got some balls for, for saying the stuff he did. Um, it's going to be fun. I'm going to go in there fired up. Um, I'm ready. This, this was just a, you know, just a match before, but now this, this has a little meaning to me. I'm coming in with, with some little more fire now, and I actually can't wait for this match. It's going to be fun. A lesson might be taught. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: I understand. And Artem, people say that you couldn't even beat Prudnik. You couldn't do much against Prudnik. And people don't see Prudnik at Dave's level. So people are just really questioning me. Like, Engin, how can you set this match when Artem couldn't do anything to Prudnik? And how can you expect Artem to do something against Dave? And what's your response to this?
SPEAKER_03: Last time you lost, but we think Dave is much stronger. Many people ask him why he did that match. How do you feel about that match?
SPEAKER_01: Well, first of all, Evgeny is strong. It's a fact that he's strong. He took the third place in the top 8. He only lost to Vitaly Laletin. Prudnik is really strong. And I don't think he's weaker than Evachafi. They have a different technique. Absolutely. Prudnik is more mobile, more technical. Evachafi is just strong. Just strong.
SPEAKER_01: What chances do I have? Or what do I hope for? There are always chances. The thing is how the grip will be established, in whose favor it will be. I'll take it by the hand, I'll feel it. If I don't feel it, I'll still try to fight. The main thing is that no one from us will tear anything away.
SPEAKER_03: So he said he thinks again, he is very strong. He said, I believe he's the same, you know, in the same level or class as David. He's just different. He's just more mobile. He's more technical than Dave. Dave is pure strength. And he said, like, sometimes he doesn't back up that with technique.
SPEAKER_03: He feels like as soon as we grip up, we will find out, you know, what is what. And he said, even if I grip up and I feel like I cannot do much, I'll still try. Most important is that we don't get injured in this match because there's going to be a lot of power on the table. And can you ask him where he is at compared or where he will be compared to Prudnik match?
SPEAKER_03: Do you feel that you will be better than you were in the Prudnik match? Because last time we saw you, you already looked stronger than you were there at the second East vs West.
SPEAKER_01: Now I'm a little lighter, it's very hot here, so my weight has dropped a little. Well, it stays around 128-130. In May I was 135. And now, according to strength indicators, for example, in comparison with the May month, in exercises, I added. And there, already at the table. The only thing is that I don't have a fight.
SPEAKER_01: Because once you fight, then you can't train for a month. Therefore, I mostly work with iron and try to add there. Now we will add a little bit to the fight, and there you will already see how I feel at the table. But it is by strength indicators that I am stronger. I removed some basic exercises, left strictly specialized, strictly armwrestling.
SPEAKER_03: So he said that it's very very very very hot summer in Kazakhstan. So he's lighter than he was. He's about 127 kilos. In May he was 135.
SPEAKER_03: But he said he's still progressing in almost every exercise he's doing. He's lifting more. The only thing he hasn't done much is table practice because when he table practices, it takes away from his training. So right now, he said, I know how to arm wrestle. I just need to build strength. And that's what he's doing. So he's spending much more time on building strength.
SPEAKER_00: uh his lifts are going up even though his weight is going down so he doesn't know how big he will be will he be bigger or but for sure he feels like he's stronger so i mean uh compared to february he feels stronger yes yes yes yeah okay okay and dave um after after uh derek beats tim bresnan and he was a dominant victory and
SPEAKER_00: people were talking about you versus Derek. And that match didn't happen, but people were thinking, you know, to set that match. And of course, when I called Derek and set the match with Morozov, it was just like a last minute, maybe like maximum 20 days before the event, because Ongar Boyev just canceled the match, so I had to change the players and everything. So after you've seen
SPEAKER_00: Morozov versus Derek, where do you see Artem? Do you see him as a serious threat or he's still young and he still needs time? I mean, just your estimation. Or you take him as a very serious opponent? I definitely take him as a serious opponent. I don't put too much stock in his match with Prudnik. That was six months ago.
SPEAKER_04: Um, as I was probably his first really big super match, um, you know, a lot of different things go into that. Um, then he pulled, he did pulled, he looked really good against Derek. Um, like you said, that match was set up pretty quick, but he, he dominated Derek and he looked really awesome. Um, he's young and from the difference between six months, you can gain a ton when you're young and in a six month period. So I know he'll be ready. Um, I definitely take him as a huge threat.
SPEAKER_04: Um, I'm really, really looking forward to this match. Um, so anybody that, that, that wants to discount Morris off for this match is, is probably making a mistake. Cause I know he's strong. I've watched a lot of his video. Um, he's fast. He can top roll. He can hook. He's really good. Um, so I'm definitely not, not, uh, he's counting anything, anything, uh, with him, uh, in regards to the prudnik match. That's for sure. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, even from February to May, I think he looked different. From the Prudnik match to May, the direct match, Morozov looked stronger and even better in technical way. This is how I saw it. I don't know how much he progressed from May 21st till now, but yeah, I'm sure that he is getting stronger.
SPEAKER_00: He is mostly outside puller and looks like you're doing great against the outside pullers, Dave. I think in the past, your hook was doing great as well. I think because of a small injury or something, you started using more pronation. And like, I think it will be very interesting match. How tall are you, Dave? Six foot two.
SPEAKER_00: six yeah so he's a little bit taller than you i think he's a little bit taller than you yeah anyway so i i think he will be he will be a very good match and do you see him do you see him someone you know who should be ranked in top 10. i think he's i think he's pretty close i mean to to see what he did to derek um yeah he looked he looked good against uh
SPEAKER_04: mask too. So he's, he's, he's a huge up and comer. If he's not there, he's really, really close. Um, I think he has a huge, huge future in arm wrestling. If he continues to do this, um, he's going to be a force to be reckoned with for a long time. And like you said, he's 24 years old. Um, there's nowhere to go from here, but up. So yeah, I'm looking forward to pulling him where he's at. Definitely. Yeah. Yeah. I agree with you. So if, if we a little bit talk about the, the,
SPEAKER_00: other matches as well before that caroline loomis is she is asking artem will they be a harder match than direct can you translate primus what what was the question that line is asking uh artem that if they will be a harder match than direct or not
SPEAKER_03: I think we all can answer that, but I'll ask. Artyom, there's a question from Superchat. Will Dave Chaffee be harder than Derek Smith? Of course, it will be harder.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know if they fought each other in America. No, but I still think that... They wanted to do a super match with Derek and Dave, but they didn't do it after you won. I think that Dave is still stronger than Derek.
SPEAKER_01: And Dave has a lot of power. We need to trick him a little bit. We have a plan, of course. We'll try. We didn't have to trick Derek.
SPEAKER_03: okay um so so um he said of course of course Dave chafee is stronger and he even asked me like have they pulled and I said that there was supposed to be a super match but they cancelled after you win you know that that match with Derek and uh he said with Dave most likely I'll need to be very tricky I need to do
SPEAKER_03: more than just be strong. With Derek, I didn't need to be tricky. I was just stronger. So that's how he looks at this. Can you ask him if he is considering different ways of pulling against Dave? He said he has a plan for the match. He definitely has a plan, but I'll ask him.
SPEAKER_03: Don't give us too much, but for example, your plan will be to go only through the top, or will you change how you will feel? Well, I've never stood with him in my hand, I've never held the table. Let's take the grip, and there you can see how he is. If he has strong fingers, for example,
SPEAKER_01: Why should I fight him with a hook? He can just pull me down with an open hand. That's why we'll try to get into the hook. Because I initially fought in the hook. And I trained in the hook. But then, with time, when the injuries accumulated a little, I had to fight with a hook.
SPEAKER_01: Now I fight with the top, because it's quick. I haven't had such long fights in a long time, but I really like long fights.
SPEAKER_03: So he said that we have never gripped up and when we have never gripped up, I don't have much information. So when we grip up and I feel his fingers are really, really strong, most likely I will not try to top roll him because Dave's been dueling with top rollers really good. He said when he started arm wrestling, he was more of an inside puller, but then he got some injuries and then he started top rolling. When the injuries went away,
SPEAKER_03: he still stayed with the top role because that's the fastest way to victory but uh he said he loves long matches he loves to be in a grinder match and if he can make that happen he will be very happy to get in that in that match with dave dave do you remember when you when we were doing like this podcast with ganadi you were talking a little about your hook you know the little problem and then finally ended up there
SPEAKER_00: you know, about for Genadi, like, do you feel little bit like how to say, like there is a weakness there that like opponent may find, or are you fixing that, that thing that, you know, so they cannot top roll you. And if they, they just jump in a hoop, they are more than welcome, you know, in that way as well.
SPEAKER_04: or you are avoiding? I know I shouldn't ask this, but. If I got an up and down, I have no problem going into a hook. I like the top roll better. My injuries over the year, my elbow isn't right. It hurts me to do just about anything. So it's less pressure on my elbow to top roll. I try to stay away.
SPEAKER_00: from the hook, but I have no problem going there if it goes there. If I feel I got to start there, I'll start there. It just depends. I'd rather not. As long as you have enough endurance, you are ready to pull any position. I understand. I understand. Anyway, if we go to some other matches, Dave, I know you time to time train with Todd and he's your countryman, but do you think that
SPEAKER_04: He is a very serious opponent this time. Um, I think, yeah, that's, that's gonna be, it's a tough one. Um, they're both so strong, um, inside Todd side pressure and permits hook. Uh, I'm really looking forward to watch, watching this match. It's probably one of the, one of my top ones to watch this time for sure. Um, we're really looking forward to, to seeing an inside battle.
SPEAKER_04: I think Todd will take it. He's so strong, just powerful, but obviously Prudnik's going to come ready. I'm definitely picking Todd, though. Do you expect it to be, for sure, a hook match, or do you think there is a possibility for Prudnik to try outside as well? Well, there's definitely a possibility for Prudnik to try to go outside. If he feels Todd's too strong inside, he'll definitely, because Prudnik can top role, too, so he'll definitely go there if he has to, for sure. Yeah, but it doesn't mean that he's going to win.
SPEAKER_04: because he actually tried to go outside it as well, but it didn't work. Exactly. Todd can pull without his hand. It's crazy how he can pull with his hand back. It's insane. So, you know, even if by chance Prudnik takes Todd's hand, doesn't mean he's got the match. That's for sure. It means Todd's going to battle and battle and very well, you know, still come out on top. So this is a title match. So you are saying that Todd is going to win, you know, in your opinion?
SPEAKER_01: I think so, yes. Artem, what do you think about Prudnik and Todd Hutchings? What do I think? I think Prudnik will win. In all positions, Prudnik will develop harmoniously. Todd Hutchings
SPEAKER_01: Only his crazy power in the side movement. And Prudnik can fight everywhere. If he doesn't go to the hook, he will go up. He has a good enough up. If he can't go up, he will go to the side calmly.
SPEAKER_03: So he believes that Genni Prudnik will win that match. As he said, there's more harmony in Prudnik's techniques than there is in Todd's. The transitions are great. He can pull outside, inside, press. Everything is there. With Todd, you still have to deal with one similar thing in all the rounds. So he believes Prudnik has, you know, more of the technical arsenal as well as he's really, really strong.
SPEAKER_01: I understand. And Artyom, that's also your countryman, so I don't know if you can be objective, but what do you think about Ongarbaev and John? About Ongarbaev and John? Yes. Well, I support Ongarbaev, of course, because he is the first earthling. And you know, this is probably our John Bowen, from Kazakhstan.
SPEAKER_01: Ongarbaev is our John Brzenk. He is also quite technical. Also everywhere, in all techniques, developed well. He can also fight in the hook. If, of course, he doesn't have any problems, any injuries. But the crown, crown, crown technique is, of course, top crown. I think that Ongarbaev
SPEAKER_01: Evgeny if it's not a dry score, he will win. And of course, I want John to win a couple of rounds too. Then it will be much more interesting to watch. Because John is a great man and I want to see him for a very long time at the table.
SPEAKER_03: He said, of course, he's rooting for his countryman that is Ongar Bayev. He said Ongar Bayev is our version of John Brzenk. He feels that he's very technical. He can pull in different areas. His top role is his main weapon. That's what he most likely will use. He hopes the match will be very close fought and that Ongar Bayev will win at the end.
SPEAKER_03: But he said he wants John to get some rounds on the board and he wants Ongarbaev to do the same. So he expects a very technical war in this one. And Dave, do you know Ongarbaev? Yeah, I know him. A few years back, he was pretty awesome. I used to love watching him. Very explosive, fast top roller. Hasn't been around, you know, for, you know,
SPEAKER_04: probably a couple of years. I want to say it's been, I haven't really seen much of, I know he pulled a small event. I seen a little bit of them recently, but, uh, I think, I think that the match will probably end up in the straps. Um, if, and John, I think John can contain him with his, with his, with his control. Basically. I think John, John wins a three, nothing, just my opinion. Uh, in this step, John is going to be, you're saying, I think so. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I'm expecting a very even match. And if it is like totally in an equal position, then as you know, we expect Endurance will play the most important role. But I'm expecting John to win. But if Ongar Bayev gets advantaged a little bit, then he has a chance to win. It's just my opinion. Let's see how it will be.
SPEAKER_01: And if we continue with some other matches, maybe not to cover all of them, but Artem, what do you think about Krasimir and Irakli? Well, it's hard to say. I know Krasimir, because I was standing at the table. He has a problem. His arm doesn't bend.
SPEAKER_01: He can't go any closer. Yes, that's the only problem he has. He has a very strong biceps. But because the angle doesn't shrink, it will be hard for him to fight Irakli. So I think Irakli can open his fists and beat him.
SPEAKER_03: But I'm not going to fight for anyone because I treat both of them well. So he's saying that he can stand on table with Krasy and he knows that the big problem for Krasy is that his arm doesn't come closer. So it stays very far away. He cannot bend it more. So he's usually like this.
SPEAKER_03: That's the most range of motion he can get. And as someone who pulls inside, you need to be close. So Artem believes that there's a good chance for Irakli to take the hand and to get him out of position. And it will be very, very hard for Krasimir to set anything good or beautiful to be containing Irakli inside. So he believes Irakli has the edge on this one.
SPEAKER_00: You just wash it actually in Istanbul and you wash it actually against Marcio and you have even pulled against cross image and how do you see this much you know cross lately been pulling against like guys, you know.
SPEAKER_00: 50%, 100% bigger than him about weight, you know. Corey West and then Arif. Arif is 150 kilos. Corey is 200 kilos. But this time he's going to pull someone around his size. How do you see this match? Yeah, it's nice to see him pull someone his weight class. I know he's got a ton of heart. Definitely super strong inside. But Irakli, he's looking real good. His hand is so strong.
SPEAKER_04: It's going to be hard. I think it's going to be hard for Krazy to contain him. If he can get him into his position, I think Krazy has a chance. But I'm going to have to give Irakli the edge on this one. I think he'll take his stand. I think that the outcome will be for Irakli as a winner. I understand. Artem, there is a question for you from Caroline. Thank you for the question, Caroline.
SPEAKER_01: Artem, are there any other Americans you would pull? Would you want to pull another American? And if yes, who would you want to pull? In general, I would like to fight with everyone. Of course, not in one day, but I would like to fight with everyone. Because if you want to prove something,
SPEAKER_01: that you are really worth something in this sport, you need to fight with everyone. Therefore, I am ready to fight with anyone. If I win, it will be good. If I lose, it will be even better, probably, because I will see my weaknesses and I will be able to work on them and grow further.
SPEAKER_01: I haven't fought with Marcio Barbosa yet. It would be interesting to meet him. With Matt Mask, for example, on the right hand, if he prepares well and is ready.
SPEAKER_03: He said he would be very happy to pull with anyone. He said like many times, like anyone. He said he didn't get a chance to pull Marcio. He would love to pull Matt Mask when he shows up ready. Those are the names. But he said
SPEAKER_03: I'm so young that I need to pull all the best guys to prove who I am in this sport. If I win, that's great. If I lose, that's even better because that will show me where I need to work on, where I'm weak. So he said he would be very happy to pull against anyone. There is another Super Chat. Andre in Mayer. Thank you for Super Chat. Would Dave Chaffee consider gaining 30 to 50 kg
SPEAKER_00: which is 66 to 110 pounds to be even bigger mass monster. He could face the one with a lot more weight. Do you consider that or is health or a good look more important to you? I could never gain that type of weight. I have enough trouble getting over 275, 280. I think 287 is the most I've ever weighed, 287 pounds.
SPEAKER_04: um i'd be way too unhealthy for me to try to to gain that weight i'm 45 years old um i have to you know look at that in life and it's just there's no way i could i could physically you know and be physically impossible to to gain that that type of weight on my frame so yeah that's that's a definite definite no so that that is this your max probably right
SPEAKER_04: What yeah that's my match yeah to pray to 85 to to yeah. yeah even to 85 is yeah about 100 130 kilo almost. yeah. Most of them was like 287 I want to say, or something like that, maybe. As begins last time you were in Istanbul or you are a little bigger or.
SPEAKER_04: um right now i'm probably just a few a few pounds smaller right now um but i'll probably i'll probably be about the same i'm guessing but my weight fluctuates every day depending on how much crap i eat so i don't really know the best diet but yeah i'm not the worst though so it doesn't really matter a few pounds up every pounds down it's basically the same weight just maybe maybe different training uh methods or something you don't understand okay i understand you
SPEAKER_00: I want to ask another great match to Artem Morozov. Oleg Zhokh versus Dadikyan. How does he see this match? And does he see any of these guys, I mean either of these guys, a possible opponent for him in the future?
SPEAKER_03: How do you see Oleg vs. Dadikyan? And if you see one of them fight with you later? Because it's with the left hand and you're in rank number one. They are strong, I think. How do you see it?
SPEAKER_01: Well, first of all, I don't know who ranked me number one. It's all good. It's all good. It's all good. It's all good. It's all good. It's all good. It's all good. It's all good. It's all good. It's all good. It's all good. It's all good. It's all good. It's all good. It's all good. It's all good. It's all good. It's all good. It's all good. It's all good. It's all good. It's all good. It's all good. It's all good. It's all good. It's all good. It's all good. It's all good. It's all good. It's all good. It's all good. It's all good. It's all good. It's all good. It's all good. It's all good. It's all good. It's all good. It's all good. It's all good. It's all good. It's all
SPEAKER_01: That's why I would be interested in David and Oleg. Why David is more interesting? David has speed. He's very fast. I've already fought him once at the World Championship in Turkey in 2018. He took me away without a chance. I was small then, still skinny. Oleg has...
SPEAKER_01: Well, first of all, it's an uncomfortable hand, and it's a very strong top. I don't know how it is now, but earlier he beat Andrey Pushkary. And he really was the best on the left, I think. I don't know now. What do you think, who will be the favorite there? Now...
SPEAKER_01: I still think David will be my favorite. Because everyone knows that it's difficult for Oleg to train and prepare. It's understandable.
SPEAKER_01: I don't think that his form is so... He can support it to be good. And he can train as well as before. So now I think that David will win.
SPEAKER_03: so uh i asked him and i said like do you know your rank number one on uh i think exports news rankings with left arm he said i don't know who put me there because i haven't beaten all those guys so he wants to he said like uh i want to arm wrestle with everyone and uh uh that wasn't my question right one
SPEAKER_03: yeah yeah yeah but it continues yeah but you know because he he's ranked number one there and it's like uh do you he said yeah i have my own ranking so why would i talk about the rankings why i have my own ranking okay so uh he said um
SPEAKER_03: If we look at this match that he can in Oleg Zhokh, he believes that that he can is in better position to win. He said the Oleg Zhokh is in a difficult situation. He he has been extremely strong in the past, but with all the accident with all the situation in Ukraine, he doesn't believe he can train properly to get better and stronger. So he believes in that match that he can is the favorite to win. But he said, of course,
SPEAKER_00: you know sets him up with lefty arm he wants to pull all those guys you know okay um there is one question for you uh dave ivan is asking and could you convince dave to make a youtube channel there is a lot of us who are fans of him that would like to see more videos of him training um i thought about it um i'm not a big video guy
SPEAKER_04: I post a few videos here and there, training stuff on Instagram, but I've had many people ask me. It's possible. Maybe in the future I might dabble in that, but like I said, I'm not a big camera guy. I don't like to be doing stuff in front of the camera, but it's the possibility. We'll see. You never know. People, you know, you're not really so social.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, you very seldom share something, but people really love you. I think because of, like, your, of course, the level of, you know, armwrestler you are. And also, I think because of your personality, the respectful, I mean, like, after you lost against Genadi, I haven't heard from you anything, like, any excuse, nothing, you know, just the wild, some people say...
SPEAKER_04: Just like I ran out of gas. I should have just trained my endurance better. Probably that that's why, you know, just people, people really likes you Dave. Well, that's, that's how I am. I don't like to make excuses and it was my fault. I mean, I could, I could point at this or point at that, but in, in, in all reality, it's my fault for not being, you know, a hundred percent trained in on endurance is my fault. It would, it would have been different. So I have no one else to blame, but, um,
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it's possible. You never know. Like I said, I've had quite a few people ask me about the YouTube channel. It's probably just that first step of trying to get started and doing it. So you never know, maybe in the future. Yeah. I'm not going to keep you guys here long. So I want to also ask your opinion about what happened in Dubai about two weeks ago.
SPEAKER_04: You were expecting that if Devon pulls in his way, there was possibility for him to win. And how did you see that match, Dave? I kind of expected if he couldn't really stop him, that's how it was going to go. I pulled both guys. I knew how strong Levon was. I knew how strong Devon is. I thought there was a chance if Devon could possibly get into Kingswood that he had a shot, but
SPEAKER_00: other than that like i said that it pretty much went how i kind of expected it was going to go so do you do you see there is there is no one close to leon right now or do you think that with better preparation in a strap somehow like you would want to try you know against him one more time
SPEAKER_04: I would say both. It doesn't look like anybody's anywhere near him right now, but I definitely would like to get a shot in the strap as a competitor. I've been pulling a long time. I would definitely like a rematch, whether I'm there or not, I don't know. But he looks so strong. But yeah, I would like a rematch in the future sometime down the road, for sure. I understand. And who do you think that he should pull next? I mean,
SPEAKER_00: except you, like, do you think that this person like Slav or Laletin or Ermes or, you know, someone who do you think that, like, of course, this guy used to pull someone, even he was a really favorite, you know, do you think that, you know, like if you were an organizer, who would you set him against? That's a tough one. Like, I mean, a few years ago, Laletin gave him a little bit of a challenge and then Laletin lost recently to Silev.
SPEAKER_04: Then Ermias beat Genadi and then lost to Alex and I beat Alex and then Genadi beat me. So it's hard to even tell who the top guy to go against him is, to be honest with you. How about throw all those guys in a tournament and the winner faces Levon maybe? I don't know. That's a tough one. Yeah, I understand. I understand. And another question for you. Do you see yourself
SPEAKER_00: possibly the number two in the world? I think I'm close. I think there's no way that there is no reason that like to think that someone other than Levan for sure better than you or something, right?
SPEAKER_00: That's how I see infected, Rich. I mean, I think that, I mean, it doesn't mean that nobody can touch you or something, but I'm sure that, you know, you have a very good chance of beating anyone else in the world, you know, except Levan. Do you agree with this? I feel the same way. There's a bunch of us right there, I think, right behind Levan. You could give number two to anyone of like, you know, like myself, Devin, Genadi.
SPEAKER_00: Alex is still up there. I beat him, but then he looked good a couple weeks ago. All of us are right there, I think, right behind him. That's just my opinion. So, yeah. Yeah. Dave, there was a conversation that, you know, like some people thought that, you know, Mitchell said many matches may not be good, killing the excitement or something, but I just want to ask your opinion. The reason that I disagree with this
SPEAKER_00: Um, it is because, I mean, there are like way so many matches that, you know, right there is they are waiting to be set. Like, I mean, you know, like, it is just like, if, if you said like two, three matches or four matches, you know, in, in a, in every six months or a year or something, you know, I don't think that we will find, I mean, like, look, look at you that you're talking about, like, look at you there. Michael is there. They, one is there. Jerry is there.
SPEAKER_00: just say Morozov is there, Hermes is there, Slav is there, Laletin is there, like many guys, you know, I mean, like these guys needs to pull to, to, you know, and, and, you know, even they pull today, like, we don't know if the things are changing six months later or not, because like you may be the guy today, but six months later, he may be in better shape. So I think just constantly these people need to pull each other in different pairs.
SPEAKER_04: I agree. I like, I like what you're doing because you're a hundred percent right. Like, you know, I could beat somebody, you know, today and then even three months down the road, someone could figure something out, get stronger, do something differently. And he could beat me the next time. There's so many guys that are so close that it's, it's hard to decipher who, who the top guy out of that, that group is. So I think it's awesome that you're, you're, you're doing this, these events every few months. It's, and I hope that you continue to do them. It's, it's,
SPEAKER_00: really cool i mean i will do my best i will do my best because i mean you guys you guys deserve i mean you guys deserve even better than what i offer but i think together we will we will grow together you know uh more more more i grow i will also you know support the athletes more um uh raymond what do you think this guy is what does he mean james stewart thank you for your support need closer weight classes versus competition what does that mean
SPEAKER_03: in closer weight classes versus competition um i think he he just means guys need to be closer and wait when they face each other but what's the versus competition it's i think it's still everyone's talking about like devon and and levin and they kind of throw it out that they were fighting for who's the number one guy on the planet the weight doesn't matter i mean if devon wanted to be number one in the world
SPEAKER_00: mean he had to pull who is the best against if he says that he's too big for me he's automatically accepting that i don't belong there but i can pull in my own weight class but if you are saying that i challenge everyone that i am the best in the world then then that guy exists you know you need to be that guy but if you are saying it's too big for me you automatically accept that there is one guy is better than you so it's up to the person to pull there or stick it
SPEAKER_03: 250 260 pull someone at his own weight you know that nobody is forcing anyone to pull the problem is every armistice knows it the problem is people they try to make excuses for you know someone who's not making excuses you know when when they was facing 11 even though he was bigger they believed he could beat him you know you have to believe that you can beat him if you beat him you're number one on the planet you know so we just saw alex versus corey alex was 50 kilos lighter
SPEAKER_00: 50 kilos lighter he won that match and then he was like well it doesn't count there it counts everywhere you're good you're gonna be better that's that that's the thing um big grow gold uh thank you for your uh super chat Dave who have been the people you look up to most in the sport who are your arm resting heroes um just when I first started probably uh John and Ron
SPEAKER_04: um definitely um the two top guys in the united states for so many years they battled and battled they're the probably in my mind the two most legendary um arm wrestlers from the united states so when i first came and i watched videos of john over and over again you know try to emulate some stuff he does basically so definitely those two guys for sure yeah that's not only of course they are like great great great great bulls but also their attitude
SPEAKER_03: Oh yeah, they act on the table too. Class acts, very class acts, respectful. And that's how I emulate myself for sure. Yeah, you are one of them as well. Thank you. Imagine how crazy it is that when Dave started, he was looking up to those guys. If you start now, still keep looking up to those guys. And if you started 20 years or 10 years before Dave started, you could look up to those guys.
SPEAKER_00: crazy people don't understand how crazy that is it's it's ridiculous and they're just like well never that good or shut up yeah yeah I mean just come on I mean just they don't know what they are talking about yeah they have to see those those guys you know in their time that they would understand better they came to near 60 still kicking ass right you should give them some idea what what to do
SPEAKER_00: they say age is just a you know number or something you know no it really takes a lot away from you you know um ivan thank you for your support engine have top 10 guys basically one back to back no not that that far not that far and i think no more super chat yeah so i would like to uh ask artem before we close artem what is your like
SPEAKER_00: Roozbeh Gharakhloo, biggest goal, do you have. Roozbeh Gharakhloo, A dream of becoming number one in the world, right and left and, if yes, in how long time do you think you can you can make this possible.
SPEAKER_03: What is your final goal? Engin asks, do you want to become number one in the world? If you think you can, how many years will it take? How many years do you think you can become number one? Or what is your goal?
SPEAKER_00: Gold? What does it mean? It's not football, bro. No, no, no. Artem, like this, like this. You go back, you dream. Oh, I beat Levan, I beat Slayev, you know. What do you want...
SPEAKER_01: I understand, I understand. It's a dream, a dream. Of course, I just want to win everyone and become like Ivan Saginashvili. Because I believe that at the moment he is number one both on the left and on the right hand.
SPEAKER_01: In fact, it was always difficult for him to fight with his right hand. He won everyone with his left hand without any problems. That's why I don't think his left hand is weaker. I think it's even better. That's why my dream is to win everyone and go to the sunset, build a house. What is your ultimate goal? The goal is not to work.
SPEAKER_03: Okay. He said, of course, he wants to try to beat guys like Levan because he believes that Levan is the number one guy who holds arms on the planet. And I asked him, what's the goal? He said, the goal is not to work, but to arm wrestle. The goal is not to hold, but arm wrestle? Not to work, but arm wrestle. Oh, okay. To make a living by arm wrestling. I understand. I understand.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, but that's possible only if you reach to that level. It's almost the same thing. Anyway, so Artem, do you have a final word to Dave before the match? Is there anything you would like to say to Dave? What do I want to say to Dave?
SPEAKER_01: he said i'll see you in istanbul there's no need to say anything when we'll meet you'll read everything from my eyes so he's telling this to you they were you realize right yeah no um
SPEAKER_04: I'm ready. I'm looking forward to it. I can't wait to pull him. He's very explosive. It's going to be fun. Like you said, he's a little of a fire under me with some of the stuff that he said. So it makes it much more interesting. And I'm looking for a heck of a match here. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But I think it will be the tension will be a little bit more than the tension between Derek and Artem in this match.
SPEAKER_00: I think it will be a good one. Let's see, just Dave, teach him. Teach him that he needs to learn much more before he talks like you are too old and this and that. Please. Artem, I organized the event, but I am even older than Dave. So when you are saying like you are too old, your armors are rusty or something,
SPEAKER_00: just remember the organizer of this event is also an arm master so so i support dave as an organizer you have a problem with this artem tell him tell him
SPEAKER_03: He said that you should remember that Engin is older than Dave. And he took it all very seriously. He will fight for the old guy. Well, damn, that's normal. It's okay. He said that's normal. I actually cheered for Engin Terzi when he fought John Brzenk. So he said he was supporting you when you were fighting John Brzenk, just so you know.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, now I'm like, okay. Just ask him, ask him. One time he felt my pronator. Ask him, did he feel anything on my pronator? Just ask him. I was injured, though. You, in my opinion, took a hold of Engin. Engin asks, did you feel his pronator? How did it feel?
SPEAKER_01: It's very hard. You know, we have this tree called karagach. It's very strong. And the older it is, the stronger it is. When I took Engin's hand, it was as hard as karagach.
SPEAKER_03: he said that there's a name karagachi the older it gets the stronger it gets he said your your arm felt really hard when you you take you put your pressure on the pronator he said he felt really really yeah tell him i will gain weight and kick his ass just joking anyways last question and we'll be finishing our arm wrestling he kept up the great work and you're doing an amazing job
SPEAKER_00: Ray beats Bowen and Mr. Chaffee rules the world. Yes. Yes. Chaffee is the hope of the humanity against the monsters. Chaffee first will beat Artem and then he's going to face Levan. But we're going to make a rule, Levan. The match is going to start in the strap as you did with Devon. Let's see. I want to see that. I want to see that in the strap.
SPEAKER_00: I still would give the edge to Levan, but I think that it will be a little bit more difficult. I'm down for that. I'm definitely down for that, so. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Because I think, I mean, there are a handful of people I think should try this right now. You, Naletin, Slaev, and Hermes. Maybe Alex as well. Yeah, I mean, like four or five people in the world. You are for sure one of them.
SPEAKER_00: yeah and i let's see let's see how it will be anyway so and ryan bowen anyway so thank you very much dave it was it was an honor my friend and hope to see you in istanbul thank you for having me on i'll see you in about a month yeah yes yes my friend artem you take care of yourself
SPEAKER_00: I'm joking when I say supporting Dave. I'm an organizer. I'm neutral. I have to be neutral. But everything will be fair and square. But just get ready for something serious coming towards you. Dave. Be ready. Something serious will happen. This is Dave. I'm always in a serious mood. Always ready for serious things.
SPEAKER_00: yeah thank you guys thank you ray thank you ray sunday sunday would you join us one more time with daddy can insult if possible let's see if i can do it okay okay guys bye
