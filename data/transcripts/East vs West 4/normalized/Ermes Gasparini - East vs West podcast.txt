SPEAKER_03: looks huge wow it looks good huge seriously
SPEAKER_02: Anyway, so let me check the YouTube chat. Engin, I sent Hermes the video what you and Neil were having a discussion over a year ago. You said he's probably your favorite poor at the moment. He was so honored. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I have been saying about three people I have been mentioning in the last three years. Not now. Three years ago, they asked me, Engin, do you see any future hopes? I gave three names.
SPEAKER_02: one was Hermes, second one was Irakli, and third was Mindaugas Tarasaitis, and all are doing better and better every day. Good position as well. Will Lerik pull in his first defense? I have no idea. I invited him a few times.
SPEAKER_02: I need to get him to follow you with my tactics. Yes, Ermes is a big boy now. I saw him doing some heavy lifts. Yeah, he looks like he's in great shape. Yeah. I'm not saying he can beat Levan or something, so don't get me wrong, but he's one of those guys that's like candidates, you know, like Slav, Lalecin, Ermes.
SPEAKER_03: Hello to Georgia.
SPEAKER_02: Hello, guys. Nice to see you all. Are you trying to get another top European guy? No, no, no, no, no. If you are talking about what I was talking, I'm bringing, I hope, I'm not sure if I can bring or not, but I sent a message through a common friend and he said he is interested. I'm talking about a North American friend.
SPEAKER_02: American again hello hello hello how are you my friend i find you good can you turn your phone sideways so you can have bigger why okay yeah that's good that's good uh john interview very soon i think i will i will ask both guys and then greetings to czech republic
SPEAKER_02: Yes, people are talking about your forearm dance, you know. Well, one second, one second. Are you the real Hermes or the China one? No, I'm China now. China one, okay. Engie, can you get Hermes to give us one of those, what does that mean? One of those what? I don't understand that thing.
SPEAKER_02: Yep. So, Hermes, you're getting bigger, getting in better shape. You are not too early, right? You are not too early. Like for November. You have like almost four months. Yeah, yeah. But now I'm starting my training and other things. Yeah, that's good. That's good. That's good. That's good.
SPEAKER_01: I want to grow up with more muscle quality, no more too much fat and water, you understand, when you eat too much carbs. Yeah. But today, today I eat McDonald's. What's funny? You ate McDonald's?
SPEAKER_01: Two hours ago, free double chicken, free McDonald's, free hamburger, two Coke. Yeah, looks like you're on a good diet. Yeah, as you said, you don't want fat. Yes, I checked the calories. This is 3,066 calories.
SPEAKER_02: 600 calories. Only this. And you said that you don't want extra fat and extra water. No, no, but it's only for today. No, no. That's your cheat day. Cheat meal. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's good. That's good. Hermes, Pradip will be your Italian translator. Is that okay? Okay. Super.
SPEAKER_02: You are ready, Pradeep? Ready. Hi, Hermes. Yeah. Anyway, so let's have some conversation. So where are you now, Hermes? Like 80%, 90%? How do you... I think 85%. 85%. I have a question for you. I have a question for you.
SPEAKER_02: 90 90 percent listen so you are saying 90 all best and for to to beat leon you need to be like 110 or even more another thing but yeah yeah the match of my life this yeah that's
SPEAKER_02: When I started armwrestling, this is my dream to be number one in the world. You know, the only problem is today we have someone that, in my opinion, the strongest armwrestler of all history. That is the problem. If there was nobody like Levan,
SPEAKER_02: it would be much more possible for you. Yeah, yeah. I'm not saying that you would beat everyone else, but it would be very possible. It would be very possible. Now, still, Levan is not unbeatable, but it is not that easy to beat him. No, no. Yeah, so that is unlucky people. People are unlucky now that they are in the time of the greatest, strongest guy in history, you know, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: For me, this is better for the athletes who grew up on the level of the standard. Beating someone like Lewandowski would be amazing, right? In history, your name would be written in golden letters. Or only one match is really...
SPEAKER_01: If you beat only one match, it's already super. If you lose five matches, it's already fantastic. Maybe he will come to Istanbul.
SPEAKER_01: you you may you may a little bit train or not yeah i want to feel his hand i i remember i remember in turkey when he he was uh 2021 when you come from dubai yeah yeah yeah
SPEAKER_01: I remember his hand is very big, but when I shake the hand of Levan, yes, he's big, but not very impressive. But when I shake the hand of Tsiplenko, he's very, very impressive.
SPEAKER_02: of Tepenco is very impressive when you you shake the hand there yeah yeah but the shaking hand and holding this yeah she's different very different yeah yeah I I hold many people's hand they shake my hand like they're gonna break my hand but whenever we arm myself it's different story yeah yeah the other day two days ago when you were doing live on your channel when I come I wrote there
SPEAKER_02: Hermes, it is me, a real Indian, and I said, you send me a message from WhatsApp 3 a.m. in the morning to say, John, this thing is incredible. And you're still asking me if I'm really Indian. No one else can know that. Oh, my God. Yeah. But whenever you meet Levan in Istanbul, he was 165 kilos and no disrespect, but he was kind of fat.
SPEAKER_02: now he is over 175 and he is more you know muscular yeah so it's different of course you are also different i think at that time you were like what 120 kilo maximum no one hundred and ten fifty one hundred twelve when i told it to be celality i would 111 120 no more kilo oh yeah the people continue to talk about 100
SPEAKER_02: 120 kilos, but it's not true. It's 100 and 120. I mean, I think that after you started using your wrist like more this way instead of like this, I think you are now more effective. I mean, when you train with Alex in Belgium and then because you were just right slowly starting to train while he was almost ready for Kody match.
SPEAKER_02: And then the way that, I mean, I saw you, of course it's training, but I can see that your wrist is getting, but I still don't, I still don't think that you can control Levan's pronator like this, but still, I think you both will hit outside because it's not that easy to control like this. Yeah. But your pronator also very strong, but I think that, I think you really need to train hard. You are right now behind. Yeah, sure.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, you need to catch up there, yeah. But if I were you, in your position, I would also try to beat him. 130 kilos, full muscle. Yeah, I mean, it's big enough, you know. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I had one question for Ermes. So, Ermes, at King of the Table 3, when you faced Genadi, and you did, I think, an interview with Alex,
SPEAKER_00: you said that about a rematch with alex you said that you need maybe one more year to beat alex but right now you seem to be very confident so do you think you can beat alex right now because earlier you said you need one more year to do that i don't want to make excuse because i lose it's normal to lose when you compete many times in a year if you lose one time it's normal
SPEAKER_01: and but when i competed with kurdeca i think it was a or the wrong day for me you understand because i i was a sick here a problem influence what is the name flu and
SPEAKER_01: And I underestimated him too much, very too much. And this is a big problem when you fight in this level. Because all the people continue to talk with me, you beat 6-0, you beat 6-0, and it's normal. You train with not very focused, very good mentality, you understand?
SPEAKER_02: and this is a very very long day for me i mean i think i think that you know you should just say sorry but you know just say that that day alex was better yeah yeah you pull him again next time yeah i won't i won't yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and then now you should pull him again you know you should pull him again
SPEAKER_01: Soon or late? You should pull him again, you know? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I think that whatever you say now, you should prove at the table. No disrespect, but you need to pull him. No, no, no. Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But same like Matt Mask, I lose in USA. And after this lose, I want a rematch and you compete again. But for me in the bedroom,
SPEAKER_02: It's very good test for me, for my shape, you understand? Yeah. For my wrist, you told me before. Hermes, you are still very young. You have a very bright future. Important is, right now, if you are going this way or this way. We know that you are going this way. So that's what's important right now. You're going up, we see that. So that is what matters.
SPEAKER_02: Yes. As long as you are improving, you're progressing. I mean, the progress is not only about the power, sometimes about experience, sometimes about learning from mistakes, you know, whatever, you know. But for sure now you have more you pull, more you are experienced, more knowledge. Sure. Yeah, yeah. I see that. I see that you're progressing. Do you agree, Pradeep, or no?
SPEAKER_00: Yes, definitely. And I was about to talk about the practice that Hermes had recently with Alex. I know Alex said that Hermes was in better trained form and Alex himself was not very well trained when you guys practiced. But you were looking very strong against Alex recently with Issa and Prudnik. Hermes, people are asking you, did you say that you test your power in the bedroom?
SPEAKER_02: bedroom yeah did you say such thing people on the chat says something that i probably missed it they they they say that did he just say that in the bedroom it's a good way to test his strength did you say such thing i didn't get it i don't understand
SPEAKER_02: And I don't know who is in the red bedroom. I don't know. I think we misunderstand. I don't know. Whatever, you know. Someone will go back what Hermes said and someone will correct it, what he actually said. Okay, okay. Whatever, whatever, whatever. Yeah. And Hermes, honestly, where do you see yourself right now, in your opinion, my friend?
SPEAKER_01: Like, I'm not talking about you and Lewand, but do you feel like you could beat the rest of the guys? Yes. You believe that, right? Yeah. Yeah. And the reason that you want to... I don't want to grow up myself. I think like this. I want to try now.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, no, what I tried to say. Only one I think is more difficult than Otar. Yeah. Laleh Ting, in good shape, very good shape. But I think I have a chance to beat him. And David Sheffield.
SPEAKER_02: And you think that Slayer is no problem for your team? No. Seriously, Slayer look very dominant. Yes, but I think I have more control hand. And how do you see yourself against Devon? Not my level.
SPEAKER_01: I repeat, I think I have a big, big possibility to beat him. But I respect Devo, he's a legend, he's the best.
SPEAKER_02: a wrestler for community, for the community, blah, blah, blah. But I think... Listen, listen, Hermes. I think... To believe that you can beat someone, it is never disrespect. You know, why would you not believe, you know? I mean, Devon believed that he can beat Levan, right? So is it disrespect? No, it's not disrespect. I mean, why would it be disrespect? He is in super heavyweight. He wants to become the best. He has a super match.
SPEAKER_02: and he wants to beat him he said i can beat him it's normal he lost but it's not disrespect and there is nothing shame to have confidence you know so you are also someone that is one of the super best super ways in the world and you want to become the best it's normal that you believe that you can be yeah yeah it's normal yeah i'm just trying to understand what is or who is more
SPEAKER_02: or most difficult for you before Levan? I mean, I'm sure soon already you're going to pull Levan because Levan needs to pull someone, right? Levan needs to pull someone. So you are one of them for sure. But there are also people that... Yeah, I want to try. Yeah. I want to try with Levan. And maybe it's very difficult with Devo
SPEAKER_01: for the set-up. He's very smart, like Matt Mask, you know. He's very high with his hands and if he cheats, your set-up is very difficult to pull in the correct way. Yes, I understand. So, before the match,
SPEAKER_02: east versus west two from february uh you were saying that you were saying that uh devon didn't have any chance against leon and even i had doubts but you were saying that it's not possible yeah yeah it happened like that but you were saying that in the dubai rules it was a little bit like one percent you said possible yeah one percent but my question is is it the same for you like to pull
SPEAKER_01: But with something like Wafu's and the other rules, is there any difference you think that you would have with Devon if you pulled him? Yes. In Dubai, you have a little chance to cheat, very little, because Bill Collins is a very good referee. He's very correct. But in your tournament, the rules are more strict.
SPEAKER_01: He's got strict rules. I mean, last event he didn't look so strict, but I think this time he will be a little bit more strict. No, no, no. It's not the same. It's not the same. A little foul, stop the match and continue like this. But your tournament and the King of the Table is no big difference.
SPEAKER_02: You can cheat a little, very little, not too much. What did you think about John's performance two days ago? Incredible, right? You were amazed. When I saw this match... Round 5 was interesting when he hooked him. Yeah, incredible. Incredible. Incredible, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Whenever you stop him like here, right here, and then you hold, hold, hold. At the end, Corey hit his hand. Crazy, crazy. I mean, he did everything he could. Corey was stronger. For me, this match is the best match of this year. For the comeback, we understand. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: For me, especially the fifth round, last round, it was incredible. People say that, oh, John didn't beat Corey because he didn't pin. I mean, because there was a foul before the pin, but they don't understand probably that Corey did that because the match was going there anyways. And people may say that in East versus West, Dave and Genadi happened, but the rule was there, difference. There was no running foul in East versus West, and here's a running foul. Ah, running foul.
SPEAKER_02: I mean the different rules like I watched and Michael explained it day before that if somebody does like that then they will continue so that they follow the rules there and they follow the rules here so the only difference was the rules you know yeah and did you see John Brzenk's live stream John was comparing Corey's hand with
SPEAKER_02: denis aplenkov's hand and john was saying that corey's hand at stopping the top role containing the top role was better than denis aplenkov like dennis was easy to talk i mean i mean like of course like i respect john's opinion so much and um i'll say i would not argue with him but if john is thinking that uh
SPEAKER_02: John is the John of 2009 when he pulled him a super match. I mean, then there, maybe there is a, like, if John is thinking that he is at his best, he was, I mean, respectfully, I disagree, but respectfully, I disagree. Um, but the same John in 2010 pulled Dennis Cipranco with Zloty or was it 2010 when Dennis just beat him like this. So what I just tried to say, um, the best of,
SPEAKER_02: best of Dennis and best of Corey. I really don't think so. But of course, I respect John's opinion. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, sure. Hermes, you only went to USA for once in 2019. And after that, you like Bartwood and Matt Ma so much that now you like loose rules. I always see Hermes talking about slightly loose rules are better. Now he doesn't like strict rules anymore once he went to US after that.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, I learned a lot with Matt Mask. Incredible. When you lose, you learn more when you win. You understand? I understand, yeah. I understand.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, somebody wrote that Michael Todd criticized East versus West rules while his rules were terrible. Yeah, I read that. I kind of didn't like that on the rules meeting he did that. So I thought about doing the similar thing in the East versus West rule meeting and address in his event. But I'm not going to go there. I'm going to I'm not going to go there. I will I will just not be provoked. And I will not respond that I so much one of the
SPEAKER_02: uh respond but then i said better not no need no need yeah anyway so uh ermez would you um share your predictions with us about the east versus west upcoming match yeah yes yeah yeah and and you know that hopefully arsen lillev is also coming yes yeah
SPEAKER_02: very nice yeah i never meet him i'm very very happy to meet him i suddenly convinced him in a few hours and then he was kind of like shaky and then he then he was like even more interested he said send me someone with in november and then yeah yeah but some days later i talked with him i said do you really believe that you know you could be ready in november
SPEAKER_02: And he said, probably I would need like a total of five months. And I said, probably February is better for you. And we kind of agreed that, you know, February for him. And so... With who? We don't know yet. Let him start training. I don't want to, I mean, after I convinced him, I want him to start and I don't want to put so much pressure on him, you understand? Let him train and yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: because now i don't know if he so if he said the late level of pharmacy now is completely different for me you know you know because because you you see the dodging and
SPEAKER_02: but for me now the dodging is the strongest is there look at look at the best shape is pulling since 2000 and this guy is 55 years old and you say today is the level is so good how is the 55 years old man is number one if the level is so incredible
SPEAKER_02: I don't think 58 years old coming and beating everyone. If the level is so good. How did I beat last year? The current 85 kilowatt champion. I'm injured all over neck, back, shoulder, elbow, everywhere. I mean, I talk, I talk about the super heavyweight.
SPEAKER_00: Oh man, super heavyweight is different. I agree, I agree. No, no, another thank you. Yeah, because it is a visible thing that like super heavyweights are more fit. If you watch a 150 kg guy in any strength sport now compared to 30 years ago, 40 years ago, now the super heavyweights are more fit. They are moving faster in every sport. It is not just about armwrestling, but it is very clear that I also don't think that the level is better in lightweight or even middleweight.
SPEAKER_02: Those guys were equally better back then. In fact, we can say the level is higher. But I see it this way. Like, in 20-25 years ago, when you competed in the World Championships, there were 3-4 favourites, very special guys in every category. Now, when you go there, you see like 7-8 guys, 10 guys who can get medals. So, there are more guys. But the special guys can come in any decade, like John.
SPEAKER_02: Roozbeh Gharakhloo, A special guy you know you, I mean you can see that you know that there are there are some special people. Roozbeh Gharakhloo, That can come in any any any. Roozbeh Gharakhloo, Time like I think that Dave person if he was 70 kilo competing today, I think you would do great at this about I believe. Roozbeh Gharakhloo, Cobra rose would do great in 75 kilo and things like that you know, but those we talking be picking guys you know.
SPEAKER_02: like that, you know. But I think Arsene really will be successful if he really comes back. Arsene is only, what, 34 years old, not even 35 years old, yeah. But now Arsene, how many kilos have? Arsene was about... 106, I think. I think he was near 120 or something. He was very fat, but now he went down 106 or 107. Um,
SPEAKER_02: he said that he can compete around 100 kilo and and Hermes he also said he also told Engin that he thinks he can beat everyone except Levan even now no no no no no no no no no in his mind yes if he prepares well if he prepares well in his mind his arm is not ready it's what he said yes yeah yeah and whenever I ask him you know how about Hermes he said he he doesn't even
SPEAKER_02: like care about it, you know. I do this kind of jokes to Hermes. Hermes is watching me very carefully. Is he serious? Yeah. Yeah. So let's start. Dave Chaffee versus Morozov. Do you think Morozov has a chance? No. Or no? No? Not at all? 5-0.
SPEAKER_02: Moro is a very good athlete, but he's very strong. You want to bet? You want to bet with me? It will not be 5-0. You want to bet? $1,000. No, I don't want to bet. Because it's best of five. When it's three, it's finishing. Ah, three. Okay.
SPEAKER_00: I want to add one point about this match, Angin, because it is clear that Dave Chaffee is everyone's favorite in that match. But Artem is only 24 years old. And just consider, just have a thought, if Artem beats Dave Chaffee in this super match, a 24-year-old guy beating Dave Chaffee, then there is absolutely no way that in three, four years, he's going to beat Levan for sure. If he's able to be at Dave Chaffee's level now, then two, three years, I don't know why he cannot beat Levan.
SPEAKER_02: Because that is why I don't think any 24-year-old guy can beat Dave Chaffee right now. Yeah, but I will tell you guys something. Do you guys think that Artem Morozov looks a little bit stronger in May compared to February? Yeah, sure. Very solid. But the question is if it will be enough for Dave or not. But you say it's not enough, right, Ernest? For me, Dave doesn't beat very easily.
SPEAKER_01: Morozov, but maybe Morozov open little risk of Dave Chaffee, but Dave Chaffee continue in this way with the shot pressure. Do you think that Morozov may hook him? No, any hook is impossible. Okay, I understand. And what's your opinion, Pradeep?
SPEAKER_02: While you are here, I want to help you. Fred, if you need to open the microphone. So if we think about it,
SPEAKER_00: Prudnik versus Dave Chaffee. Like, I know that match was about three months ago, but how much can someone possibly improve in three months? Like, he lost to Prudnik. But if we talk about Prudnik versus Dave Chaffee, do you guys think Prudnik can beat Dave Chaffee right now? I mean, it can be close, but Dave Chaffee should be the favorite in that match. I will tell you one thing. I'm not going to go into details. Prudnik in February was much stronger than Prudnik in May.
SPEAKER_02: That's all I will say. Prudnik in February was much stronger. In May, he was still strong, but in February, I know the details, he was stronger.
SPEAKER_00: Just because of the age and the maturity that experienced armwrestlers get when they are 10-15 years in the sport. Just because of that, I don't think Morozov is ready yet for Dave Chaffee. Because if he is, then this is the only guy that we should be looking forward to challenge Levan right now. If he is able to beat Dave Chaffee at 24 years old. Why only guy? You're saying this while the Hermes is here. Hermes, what is he talking about? What is he talking about?
SPEAKER_02: because hermes is already arm wrestling for at least 15 years and more or less that doesn't matter he's still picking anyway so i i think hermes like right now as of now most likely he cannot beat levan but i think that he has chance to beat
SPEAKER_02: anyone else. I'm not saying he can beat everyone else, but he has chance to beat. You cannot say that Ermes cannot beat this guy for sure. There is no guy like that. So if we go to do another match, this is about your opponents, Ermes, Geri and Genadi. How do you see their match? Say honestly, say honestly.
SPEAKER_01: It's very difficult, but I saw the interview about Lewand in Dubai. Lewand said Genadi beat Jericho very easily. It's very difficult to predict this match.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe there are many fouls for Jerry, because maybe he wants to start early like this and for a foul. But I think Genadi is stronger. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Chance Shaw is here. He said, Genadi 3-0 Italy, because he had some beef with Nigeri, right? Last time I did the interview with Nigeri and Genadi, Chance again jumping like this, and then Nigeri was like, oh, did he go to school today or something? He was saying something like this. Yeah. What was I going to say? Nigeri, Genadi, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Hermes, I will tell you something, but don't get offended. I think that there is a possibility. You are stronger now than the time that you beat Genadi. But whenever I think after round four, last two rounds with Genadi, when he pulled different way to the sideway, it kind of a little bit was
SPEAKER_02: I know you were like 4-0, you lost concentration because it was over. Very serious. Yes, so serious. But whenever he hit you, the sideway, like the same way that he did against Dave, of course, he couldn't hook you, but he hooked Dave. But with you, he hit more like this way. And it seemed like a little bit effective.
SPEAKER_02: Just remember, you are getting stronger since that time, but he's also getting stronger in his confidence. So, like, do you feel like, you know, if Genadi Bizgeri comes to front of you in November, you are like, okay, I beat him once and next time will be even easier or you're taking him seriously? No, seriously. Sure. Seriously. Very, very seriously. And
SPEAKER_01: I know now Genadi is stronger than last year, but me too, sure, me too. For me, it's the same as last year, the match.
SPEAKER_01: Only I don't want to do wrong one thing because when you are confident, when you want, you are not with a strong mentality, you understand? But I want to go very serious and I think I beat him again. If I'm not mistaken,
SPEAKER_02: I asked Jerry, which one is more dangerous for you? I think I asked this question. I think I asked Genadi or Hermes, and he said that you are more dangerous for Jerry than Genadi. Yeah, I think. Jerry said that. One guy said that, like, yeah, he said Hermes clearly had the pain in brachialis. He pulled without round five and round six.
SPEAKER_01: But it seemed to me that it happened in round five, not round four. No, no, four. Your brachialis hurt in round five? No, no, no. My hurt started when I pulled it with Kurdeca.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, yeah, you were telling me it was hurting here. Yeah, you remember. I have a problem. How come you won the first four rounds with no pain and you hurt? Yeah, for the adrenaline, like Dylan, but when you won... I think the first four rounds, he was pulling your hand like this. So he didn't hit your brachialis, but whenever he started ground five, he did it sideways. Yeah. It hurt even more, yeah. Yeah. But now your brachialis is right now okay?
SPEAKER_02: Super. Oh, super. That's good. Yeah, that's good. That's good. It's the same meta. Yeah. And do you, would you want to wish, would you wish to have Gery or Genadi in November as an opponent? No problem. Doesn't matter. It's what I think. If you have a goal to beat Lewand, you beat or not, but you have a goal to beat him. And if you cannot beat these guys, then it means that you are not ready for Lewand anyways. Yes.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, so you are, okay. Who is winning? Genadi or Jerry? Genadi. Genadi. Genadi is winning. So you are thinking that Genadi will be your opponent in November. Yeah. And I want to explain to people, people say, okay, they pull only one year ago. If we compare November to December, you know, um, they said like, like why they pull, why, why not?
SPEAKER_02: Dave Sheffield and Ernest Poole, but I need to explain to them that Genadi beat Dave, now Genadi ranks higher, so you want to hit someone who is ranked higher. Am I correct? Yes. I want to go in the first position. When you disempoised
SPEAKER_01: In this sport now, in this level, it's important to go in a better position, not to fight another guy. You understand?
SPEAKER_00: Dave you seen Jerry's interviews? In every single interview, every video, he's saying that he just wishes, he hopes that Jerry tries to go inside with him. Jerry or Kennedy.
SPEAKER_00: jerry is saying always that he wishes that you are saying that you wish that jerry goes inside jerry goes inside you mean oh correction yeah yeah jerry was saying that he wishes that gennady goes inside with him and jerry is very confident that gennady cannot beat him inside so he's he's saying that his only way his only hope to beat me is with a top role maybe it may be like a mind trick
SPEAKER_02: yeah this is exactly outside and then so he can go yeah we don't know this is exactly what i was also thinking that maybe he doesn't want him to maybe he doesn't want him to go inside that is why he's saying he's good inside i have no idea i have no idea i mean i'm not gonna go there as an organizer but uh i i think that you can imagine imagine that you know jerry putting his head and turning
SPEAKER_02: he used to do that on the yukon check events setting himself you know you know with you together with gennady like does it not make you a little bit like nervous to see yeah that excitement getting gennady at the table wow especially if that match is good if that match goes to the endurance game wow wow yeah yeah bring your chips and drink you know
SPEAKER_01: very very beautiful when i come only for watch the the yeah amazing yeah without stress without zero only watch for youtube 25 years i completed and then when i go for like training or something i just go sit here especially the last time i went to africa
SPEAKER_02: i i did the the the commentary for the olympic channel olympic channel i sit here asking what president is right by me you know we are at the front i just see it and ah just talk that's nothing you know normally you go there you know stress you need to make the weight you need to eat maybe you need to do sauna and everything you know just like come on uh chance though thank you for your super chef he says predips silk shirt
SPEAKER_02: Three, Jerry, zero. And Silver, how? No. I thank for your support. Hi, great discussion. Keep up the great work, guys. How does it feel, Hermes, when John said he respects you a lot and your approach to the sport? How do you feel?
SPEAKER_01: Water, water, please. Somebody says, how does it feel that John respects you? John respects me. Yeah. Yes. He's an honor for me, he's my idol. For me, John is a... Arm wrestling, arm wrestling, arm wrestling. John equal arm wrestling. Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: And he still bruises at the age of 57, 58, whatever. Impressive. Very impressive. Yeah. And Hermes. Yeah. John also said that he wants to do after pulling with you, Hermes. When? Whenever you guys meet. Whenever you are in the same room. Ah. See, Chance Shaw says that Sarah Beckman would beat Hermes. Is that true? Yes. Yes? No. You can say that. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: But Sarah Baikman don't come in your tournament. First East versus West event. Yes, I remember, yeah. And no games. Engin, do you remember Igor Mazurenko as an athlete? How good he was? No comment about it, no comment.
SPEAKER_02: um so if we go to do very important match but we talked that before i think uh remember we were talking about iraqi versus tata jinx and at the same time we were talking with prudnik as well that he said that he is gonna beat him inside as well right okay after you saw iraqi versus tata jinx um how do you think honestly i know prudnik is your friend but how do you think that tata jinx versus prudnik with the weight limit of 107 kilo
SPEAKER_01: For me... My toe is not big chance. My toe is not big. Okay, what's the reason? For me, Prudnik, the first and the second round, he will put it in the top row. And he will open the risk of dodging and after this, go inside. He's going to beat him?
SPEAKER_01: I think, yes. Very difficult, but I think it's possible to win. Yes. I understand. And how do you see the pre-dip? But not immediately in the hook. Not in the hook? Not in the hook immediately. Oh, okay. If Brüning goes immediately in the hook in the first round, he loses, I think. Maybe if he can start in the top row,
SPEAKER_00: I think that everyone talks about Todd Hutchings hook. Todd Hutchings does not lose in a hook. But whenever Prudnik loses, that is always why a top roll. Nobody hooks and beats Prudnik. At least when he crossed the 100 kg mark. Dave you seen him lose in a hook after that?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, Baba, who did he pull in hook? So, like, very incredible hook puller. Rustam was lighter when he beat Rustam, but that match was very, very comfortable and easy for Prudnik. So, everyone is top-rolling. Vitaly top-rolled him and Ongar Bayev top-rolled him two times. So, even left-handed. Those guys are top-rollers. Top-rollers, yes, top-rollers. You cannot expect Vitaly to beat Prudnik in hook, you know. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: But left-handed also, again, same thing. Yes, Tobias was a top roller. But he's... Prudnik is getting top rolled. It is not like he's getting beaten in a hook. So, I think it is the same thing. I think that Prudnik can beat Todd Hutchings in a hook as well based on speed. So, you are saying that Prudnik is going to win? Yes, Prudnik will win. There is a question. How do you think a match between Prime Liliev and Hermes will go? Liliev will kill him.
SPEAKER_02: linear lily and air mass at same weight sorry i would give a little bit edge there yeah same weight yes 130 kilo air mass versus lily i mean no need even that much sorry yeah but it is yeah i mean yeah yes penguins low audio should i scream more
SPEAKER_02: Hello. Oh, you guys hear me? Yeah. Anyway, so the chance shows account account hacked or what? I don't know what is happening in the chat. Yeah. Chance chance is just writing whatever Conor McGregor three zero zero.
SPEAKER_01: um people are thinking that you are afraid of dave cheffy that's why you don't want to pull him and pull gannett no they don't ask oh my friend no no yeah angry remember this yeah i told you uh when is the last uh your last evening may not me may may may may yeah yeah i'm a
SPEAKER_02: I'm ready to fight to Dave Chaffee. You remember? Yes, yes, yes. If Dave would beat Genadi, now he would want to beat Dave. Yeah, Dave, yeah. So you're calling Genadi only because Genadi beat Dave. Yeah, I understand. Yeah, you remember the deal. He's only for the ranking. Yes, yes, yes. There is a question. Engin, what do you think about Devon's daughter calling out Jerry and claiming she would whoop him?
SPEAKER_02: three zero um i mean no comment about that yeah anything is possible but even if devon's fourth is watched by tens of thousand times in the elevator then then i mean we of course we we need to uh talk about these kind of things as well um okay john brzing versus ongar web good man
SPEAKER_01: John Bersink, but how? Easy? Hard? Both go outside? What? No, very easy, but I think when you stop your career, it's very difficult to restart. You understand? To feel the competition, to set up and other many things. And for me,
SPEAKER_01: Maybe Ongarbaev will take the wrist of John, but I think he won't like this, with the side pressure like this. With a little open wrist, but he can beat me. Maybe both will be in the same position, right? Both will be on the wrist, both will be outside, and then they will be like this, yeah? Yes. I think the match may look
SPEAKER_01: When I saw John Brzenk, I don't know, but I saw when he competed, he looked only at
SPEAKER_02: He doesn't have a lot of focus on his hand. You understand? John, don't you think that it's interesting that John was able to hook Corey while, I mean, we were thinking that if he would jump and hook, he would get flashed, but he just successfully hooked him without the strap. I mean, I personally begged John to hook me without the strap.
SPEAKER_02: But he successfully hooked Corey. I was like, wow, how did it happen, you know? But I mean, Corey was himself going in. No, no, no, no. He goes side pressure like this. He doesn't go like this. He protects his pronator. And then, you know, when Krasimir wants to jump in, he just turns his pronator and just feeds him. I mean, Corey does not dip his pronator. He still...
SPEAKER_01: If he's pronated, but it doesn't mean that he pronates out, but he doesn't give here. He does. I mean, but I talk about when he go in the top row. No, no, in the hook. Oh, I understand. I understand. An example. Me when I fight, I fight with the top row. I have a lot of focus in my wrist. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. And the jumpers think
SPEAKER_02: i saw no important he's go like this and the usual pronator like this i mean he doesn't go like that he tries to control there but you know he keeps here you know yeah like a like how to say insurance like security you know he just like here like this here you know and then and then if he gets here he gets here too but he for first two that you know he protects here in the strap especially
SPEAKER_00: Yes. And I mean, this is why I think it may be a big problem for Ongar Bayev. Because of his surgery. I've also had the same rotator cuff surgery in my shoulder. And I'm not saying I'm a good armwrestler or anything. But I've heard many armwrestlers talk about it. Whoever had this rotator cuff surgery. If there are 10 different pressures in armwrestling match, the one thing that this surgery takes the most is when you're trying to apply side pressure. And if, as you were saying... John has the same, similar...
SPEAKER_02: It's all the problem, right? But John is still winning. Evgeny with that problem, he's winning all the matches. No, no. I think Brodnick Ongarbaev can pull that way too, you know. I mean, don't you remember Ongarbaev versus Kurdeika? Yes, but he recently had surgery. I'm talking about surgery. Yeah, I understand. But John, I think, had the surgery as well some years ago. But I'm just saying that he's young. 2012.
SPEAKER_02: John had it in 2012. I understand. But what I'm just saying, Ongarbaev is much younger. And I saw his recent matches and he said he's in great shape. And I think he's fine, you know. I mean, I will tell you something. If we start talking about excuses, John has more excuses than all of us. This guy has probably 10 million miles on his arm, you know. I mean, this guy, just imagine the pressure he has handled
SPEAKER_02: that just let me count, like Richard Lucas, Cleve Dean, Gary Goodrich, Zaur, Alan Carrere, I mean, Erekle Gursiani, Watanye Wahadze, Alexey Voivoda, Taras, Travis, Devon, Michael, Todd, I mean, Matt Joerner, I mean, just like, let me count, Pushkar, Ferid, you know, just like, imagine that this arm handle and shoulder handle all those pressure, I mean,
SPEAKER_02: I don't think that Ongarwaya had even a quarter of the pressure, maybe not even 10% of the pressure that John had. Evgeny the last match against Kody West, when the slip happened, did you see John? John's head was just like red.
SPEAKER_02: The guy, he put his spirit there, everything there. To make it happen, you know. That's what I am saying. This guy is incredible, you know. That spirit, you know. One guy said that he is obsessed with John. My friend, John is not my best friend. John is not from Turkey, not even neighbor country.
SPEAKER_02: Not we are like from same religion or whatever, but how can you not be amazed watching that guy and not being amazed, you know if you're not amazed of that guy sorry. Either you don't understand our missing or there is another problem just imagine it was 3.30am in the morning or 4am this is crazy guy.
SPEAKER_02: Hermes Kasparini, the first thing he remembers is me. He writes me from WhatsApp. He's incredible. Just, okay, if you think that I am the only one, then you are wrong, you know. All those guys that you see around now, including Alexei Voivoda, like we all want John, like with that obsess that you are calling me. Look at Hermes. Who is Hermes? He may be the number two in the world right now.
SPEAKER_00: but can you imagine that how he was affected because he understand from armwrestling he knows john's age whenever he sees that he's doing that fight he's also amazed i am also amazed too you know and i mean this is this is something that is really amazing about armwrestling and especially john brzing that if you remember if you all remember 2019 early january i think it was everyone was talking about top 8 95 kg and people were saying that well
SPEAKER_00: Rustam Babayev and Ongar Bayev are going to probably fight for number one spot. Ongar Bayev is going to win. Rustam will be second. And then third will be Oleg Petrenko probably. And John is going to be somewhere down five, six. This is what everyone was saying in 2019. And now everyone, John has changed everything in just one year. And everyone is saying that John is going to beat Ongar Bayev who was supposed to win the top eight in 2019. Yeah, but just remember one thing.
SPEAKER_02: Um, I think it was a good decision for John to have some years of break. I think he healed up many, many things. If he would continue, continue, continue, maybe it would be, it would be like too much for him. And, but he took some years off, probably he healed up a lot. It didn't, it took one year, right? Since he come back, it was last year, July and now July one year. So he is still a little bit, you can see picking, but yesterday,
SPEAKER_02: I watched a little bit of his Monday morning thing, you know, the chat. And I didn't watch all of them. It was live when I was sleeping. But the next day, I saw that John said that, you know, he should keep himself light heavyweight, even like middleweight or heavyweight or something he said. It is a right decision. If John would have matches like he had with Corey West,
SPEAKER_01: three times, four times, I think that it would be too much for him, you understand? Maybe once a year with a super heavyweight, it's okay. But I think he could stay in the light heavyweight, you know. It was too much pressure. I think it's already too much to put this match and now three weeks another match with Ongar Mbaye. It's too near.
SPEAKER_02: No, not three weeks, but four weeks probably. Four, okay. Four weeks, yeah. I think four weeks is fine. If it was two weeks, no problem. Yes, if you don't have a pain or injury, okay. If you don't have a pain. Yeah, if no injury, yeah, that's fine. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Anyway, so you say that John is going to win and then Pradeep, you are also saying that John is going to win? Yes, I also think John is going to win.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I slightly give chance like the edge to John, but I still think that it will be a tough match. I don't think it will be easy match. And Ongar Bayev is also very good armwrestler. Very good armwrestler, yeah. Yeah. And if we go some other matches, what do you think about Oleg Djokovic, Dadikyan armwrestler? But remember, Dadikyan was over 110 kilos, he's going 102 kilos.
SPEAKER_01: he's too strong yeah that he can't be too strong left do you think do you think that daddy can can hook sure you think he will he will not come what he will hook him or he will no no i i showed the video and i fed him a little in russia the he said he's ridiculous very very strong
SPEAKER_01: you when he he compete he have a finger very strong when you show like this not like this understand when you your your hand is like this and it is very difficult to open you understand or your arm is a double strength you open totally arm and wrist but the
SPEAKER_01: If you have the same strength, same power, if you have a very, very strong wrist and the finger, you can hook another guy. So you are saying that he can hook Oleg? Yeah. Yeah. I kind of don't see that. I don't think he can hook him.
SPEAKER_02: no i i don't think he can hook him but maybe he wouldn't lose his wrist but he will stay like this here and here like this i think he will be a good dwarf but i don't think that uh i think i i don't think that he can install enough to go around either you know but i think he will just hit like this and oleg will be like this i think they will be stuck at the middle that's my opinion because i think oleg
SPEAKER_02: is now stronger than february from february to august is six months he is still coming back and i think we will see a little bit stronger or exo but let's see but i think close match no i think andrews andrews will play but we will see i think that he can we win i i also think that they can will win you think that he can is gonna dominate him or
SPEAKER_00: So, more or less. I mean, I think that that match can look somewhat like Devon Lett versus Oleg Zhokh match. I know you just mentioned that Dadikyan is not long enough to go around him. But I think he can just stop him like Devon did in the first round with a flat wrist. Not so much of cup and without losing his own wrist. And slowly after that when he brings him to center, maybe then he can hook him. I understand. I understand. I'm not saying Zhokh is going to win. I'm expecting a
SPEAKER_02: tough match not not domination i don't think so uh zoc is special guy as well yeah yeah yeah yeah i'm sure but but i think that they can maybe top five in the world super heavyweight left-handed yeah yeah one guy says strength old school says that uh john burthing um
SPEAKER_02: same predisic yesterday when he did a live broadcast i guess you were right when you said he picked up a bad cold my friend it was not because i was right or something what i said was what john told me so yeah i was not lying um who talked about the 28 centimeters of wrist level
SPEAKER_01: All the people continue to talk that he has a 28-centimetre wrist. Who says that? I don't know. He has 25. I have no idea. I don't know about that. In many schedules, he writes 28, 28, 28. I have no idea. I have no idea.
SPEAKER_02: I'm not really interested about the size of the wrist. No, no, no. 28 and 25 is very different. No, no, I don't really care if the guy has 28 or 25. Yeah, yeah, but 28 is not human, you understand? Levan is not human? No, no, no, he's already not human, but 28 is...
SPEAKER_02: yeah when i said he's not human i don't mean disrespect but the guy is just like another level right now the way he looks yeah yeah it is 25 25 centimeter corey west measured it at dubai in dubai yeah 11 11 is a good guy as soon as he won he wrote me a message from whatsapp yeah the guy is yeah strong guy um who's the pauline pauline
SPEAKER_02: is asking me if Paul Talbot for the five. And I said, yes, if he accepts. And guys, what do you guys think about? Rossi Marine, Iraq Lee. Iraq Lee. Three zero, easy. Easy, he will win? Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: and i i show i show the you wrote about iraqli you want to put the money for the victory and the crazy 25 i don't remember yeah yeah yeah class even asked me yeah class even asked me to iraqli and then i didn't ask iraqli and then and then i started promote the events i start the poll
SPEAKER_02: And then on the poll, because after Irakli beat Marcio, Irakli was just like, and then the poll was all like 75% Irakli, 25% Krasimir. Probably Krasimir didn't like this. And then Krasimir wrote me again. He wrote me, asked me this one month ago. And then he said, did you ask Irakli that, you know, 75%, 25%? I said, I didn't. He said, can you ask please? And I asked Irakli. And then he said, yeah, why not?
SPEAKER_02: And then this is how it happened, you know. This is the agreement. Yeah, yeah. They wanted to agree with each other. Yes. And I said, okay. Yeah, finally, yeah. And then I asked Levan, I said, would you pull Hermes? And then he said, yes, but the winner takes all the money.
SPEAKER_01: Just joking. Listen. Okay, okay, okay. I put my friend behind him with a, and then he, yeah. Or a collar, you understand, for sleep.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, because we are very good friends. I am older than you and I know you respect me. I am always joking with you. No problem. So, do you think Pradeep, Irakli is going to win or Krasnoy is going to win? It is really difficult. If you asked me this question before the
SPEAKER_00: can you ask the question again somehow i just
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah. So I was asking about the matches before 2019. So when Krazy was losing in his own weight class, was he more getting top rolled or getting hooked in his own weight class? Krazy was involved in some last years. He was pulling usually super heavyweights. Like 2017, I remember he pulled super heavyweight. 2016, he pulled super heavyweight.
SPEAKER_02: I don't remember in what he's losing in hook. I don't remember. I think that I saw Trubin beat him with the top roll. And one time I remember long time ago, Arsene Lille beat him with more like dragging, you know, but not, was like 2008 or something. And I don't remember who was beating him in this category.
SPEAKER_02: I also think that Iraq will win maybe. 2018, both Ozan Kocak and Prudnik Biedem inside.
SPEAKER_00: And I know that match was in 2019, Marcio versus Krazy. But one match, maybe with a little bit of early start, Marcio was also able to top-roll Krazy in one round. So I think Irakli should also be able to do that. Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_01: So, if we go to another man, Zurab versus Chen Xiao, Hermes. Zurab. Zurab is going to win, you think? Yeah. Easy or hard? Hard. With endurance. Yeah. If you reach like this, continue, continue, continue, continue, maybe, but...
SPEAKER_01: It's 50-50, but a little more throughout. Krasimir beat you twice in Italy event, right arm? He beat me the first time
SPEAKER_01: No, the first time when I met him is in Zagreb, Croatia. And I beat him with the left hand. The first. And with the right hand, I lose. After this, I beat him twice with the left hand. But your right hand was injured. You didn't compete, right? Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I remember, yeah. I won with him in a shoot in Reggio Calabria. With left arm? Left, left, yeah. I understand. At that time, I think your right arm was still injured. You were trying to come back, right? Yeah, yeah. I remember, yeah. You had a surgery or something? Yeah, surgery with metal inside. Not my monkeys, not my circus. Thank you for your support.
SPEAKER_02: And then, what do you think, Pradeep? You have your chance.
SPEAKER_00: i think again this match can look similar to zurab versus fa comic match my my concern will be chan shaw's endurance in that match i think in the first couple of rounds chan shaw will pin zurab with one or two surges maybe but after that i think zurab will be like that and chan shaw can fade and he can slowly just like he defeated fa comic left-handed in the first round maybe are you gonna come to istanbul as you said or no
SPEAKER_00: Maybe next time. Still passport. I cannot get passport still. Maybe next time. How many centimetres you have angle? How many centimetres? Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Like this, I measure, not like this. I see you do like this and this. I don't measure like this. I do like, like, like, like this. Like this. Yeah, yeah. Sorry, but... No, my friend. All the people measure like this. This. Yeah, yeah. You don't measure like this. No, no. It's just like, it's just whatever. Like this. Like this. Like 90 degree arc.
SPEAKER_02: from brachii radialis to here. No, these you don't correct. Yes, yes. You do like this, 43 something arm, you make 50 something, whatever. Okay, my forearm is now like this, cold, probably yesterday was 39 and a half. But some, last week I trained, what did I train, pronator or, yeah, pronator. It was, uh,
SPEAKER_02: warm 42 something and then the biggest ever was 43 and a half warm and the cold was biggest in this position like this like this like this
SPEAKER_02: i don't know like this if i do like this it's a 60 something there is a there is a super chat from chan's show chan's show says that hermes corner me in my match he wants you to be his corner man no my friend he said why why he said
SPEAKER_02: then you can see closely how he beat zurab oh yeah he wants you to witness everything closely that's what okay but remember chance and i will remind you this when i did interview when i do interview together you and zurab and then i'm sure that zurab will have some answer for this i will provocate you guys as much as possible you can be sure about it
SPEAKER_02: um see one guy says that everyone wants to match someone who is ranked higher can you ask who enemies want to fight uh with them except hook who do you want to arm muscle except the one i mean for the ranking you want to do with kennedy but if you if you want to do who who would you want probably don't
SPEAKER_01: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
SPEAKER_02: When I started to pull for arm wrestling, it was my dream to pull with John. You understand? I think maybe after pull is better. In competition, you will beat him. What? No, I said maybe after competition is better. You know, for training is better. Because in the competition, you have to beat him. Yes.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, no need for that. Ah, another guy. Listen, I will tell you something. Just go down to 110 kilo. John will kick your ass.
SPEAKER_01: why why i go i i needed to go down my friend because john cannot get 130 kilo ah okay it's not my problem okay then he's not gonna fool you i'm his manager ermis i had i had one question for you
SPEAKER_00: And Engin, for you as well, how much is gap in time is there going to be in that final left-handed match of Hermes and right-handed match? Like, what will be the time duration between these matches? I mean, we didn't decide yet. I mean, I will put Hermes' left-hand match and right-hand match, like, wherever he wants. If he wants five matches difference, yeah, ten matches.
SPEAKER_01: I want to compete first with the right hand and after this I want to rest one hour. Now I don't know.
SPEAKER_02: Right hand super match. Right hand super match. Title match. Main event. How can this match be first? Main event match. You are the last match. You want the right arm match first or the left first? Yes. Right first he said. You want to pull right arm first? Yes. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Because you care more about your right arm match than your left arm match. Left is... Come on. I'm gonna cancel his match.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, it's important to win with the left, but it's not the same right for me. For me, the right is most important.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I understand. I understand. I understand that. But when you say the right is more important, it's okay. Whenever you say left is bad. No, no. Just like, you know, yeah. Anyway, so. Also, Sandris and Lachlan. Sandris? And Lachlan, out from Australia.
SPEAKER_02: You know, yeah, yeah, yeah, strong. Yeah. Any, any, any, any prediction? For me, Sandris. Sandris, because more experienced or? More experienced, more technical, more style. Yeah, I have a question for you, Hermes. You are a
SPEAKER_02: Mainly top rollers. You are one of the best top rollers. In my opinion, one of the best top rollers in the history. Thank you. I cannot say for sure best, but one of the best. Like Cobra, you, maybe Joaquin Taras, John, you know. But whenever you watch a match, hook roller and the top roller, your mind is like going for the top roller. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: yeah right he's in my team they are my team we understand yeah yeah yeah yeah i feel the same my mind is working because we all the time prepare ourselves for the hook pullers you know yeah there is a one question for you um of course it is uh
SPEAKER_02: I mean, it is how to say it doesn't make sense so much. I mean, I'm not disrespect to this guy who was asking, but I mean, you can say this way that way, but like, uh, you would, we said you would have like hands to pull. Like if there was a time machine that with this shape, you are you and Alexi Voivoda 2022 Hermes versus 2004 Alexi Voivoda would be good match.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yes. I don't know the level of Alexi in this year, but I don't know the same level when he fought with Tim Breslau. What do you think?
SPEAKER_02: mean but he was also dominant in that year in 2004 he looked dominant ah okay yeah i mean he looked like a little bit above the other guys you know he looked yeah yeah yeah yeah i think that if you a little bit more side pressure side pressure side pressure you will be more complete you are great top roller but now with more yeah side pressure i think you will be even more yes
SPEAKER_02: Yes, I think so. I think the same. Griffith, thank you for your support, my friend. Bozhidar versus Samushia. What? Bozhidar, Bozhidar. You know Bozhidar? Bozhidar, yes. Yeah, and Samushia. You know Samushia from Georgia, he pulled with Pauline. Ah, Bozhidar.
SPEAKER_02: Last time they pulled in 2019 World Championships, Samushia won. Samushia is also a very strong guy. Samushia was 78kg, he gave a very tough match to Sandris at Zlotysur. Yes, but now this time I think Samushia is very strong. Incredible. I think it will be a good match, this is what I am thinking.
SPEAKER_02: And there will be another good match. I will ask you this one, Pradeep. Corey Miller versus Prokopchuk.
SPEAKER_00: Corey vs. Prokopchuk, I think it is going to be a very bad match for Corey Miller. Evgeny if he takes his wrist, he's going to just stay there and press through. I think he can take his wrist. I think Corey can take his wrist, at least in the first or second round. But his arm will not go anywhere. Without the strap or with the strap? With, with. I don't think he can finish him without the strap. With the strap.
SPEAKER_01: I have a good question for you, Hermes. Egle versus Gabriela. Do you know Egle very well? Yeah, I remember. How do you think about this match? Gabriela, sure. Right and left? Yeah. Because I saw Egle last time. When was it?
SPEAKER_01: the world championship european championship i don't remember is a is not the same way in the past or or i wrong but but she is getting ready now let's see how it will be for me gabriella now is the best top roller the best arm wrestler woman um
SPEAKER_01: Derek versus Revaz. Oh. Revaz. Revaz is a... Volga, yeah. Revaz. Yeah. He's a giant. I don't know. Same Derek, but for me, he has more chance.
SPEAKER_02: But it's very difficult, this match. You know what makes me confused? Revaz's main weapon is top roll. But whenever he tried to top roll Michael in the first round, Michael would hold him and look at his face. Remember round one? You don't remember? Yeah, I remember. I was like, what? How is it? You just hold him like this.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah. I was like very surprised, you know, and Revaz was able to pull this way. And so, uh, but Revaz, I, Revaz sent me a video and a picture from Instagram and I, he wrote 60% because last time when he pulled Michael on the interview, he said he's only 40%. And now he said he is in 60%. Yeah. Revaz now is 60%. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: One guy is asking if Ermes will be ready for Levan in one year. Six months. Six months, right? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, if Levan would accept, you would pull him in February, correct? Immediately. Yeah. In the new year, anytime new year, you are ready. Yeah. Yeah. By the way,
SPEAKER_02: You do the forearm movement like, like, like this. Yeah. Move these. How about, how about, can you do this? Without moving the fingers. No. Honest critic. Pradeep doesn't know how to arm wrestle. Fact. Is it true, Pradeep?
SPEAKER_00: when did i say i know when did i say i know like show me one example when i said that i know i'm sure i'm sure you know someone you know at least you understand yes yes yeah he say more than me the date the the the match like this
SPEAKER_00: there is a place for everyone in armwrestling sport it is a new sport not everyone has to be an armwrestler people need more people maybe maybe journalists news guys that is what i am here for but i i i i mean i we don't agree everything but i find your uh predictions opinions good you know generally
SPEAKER_00: and this is what happens with the predictions i mean whenever i predict my my usually my rate is if i predict 14 or 13 matches i'm correct on 10 of them 10 out of 13 10 out of 14 predictions and people will only go to those three wrong predictions and comment you you are always wrong you are you're never right
SPEAKER_00: yeah like the todd hutchings versus michael todd match i i predicted it exactly as it is going to happen i said that first round michael will go to king's move he will not be able to finish when he will try to transition todd hutchings will pin him and then todd hutchings will be tired when michael goes for the press he's michael is using different muscle groups todd hutchings will be using same muscle groups so michael will press him after that three rounds this is exactly how predicted that match and exactly but nobody not even one guy commented that your prediction was right but i said that two possible outcomes in
SPEAKER_00: John Brzenk versus Corey West. John versus Corey West. I said two possible outcomes. I said John Brzenk cannot top roll Corey West. But John can beat Corey in a hook. This is what I said. So I said either 3-0 Corey West or 3-2 John Brzenk. This is what I said. And I was very clear that John has to beat Corey in a hook. And he can beat him. And everyone was commenting that you said Corey will win. If they would start in a hook, I would say that John has a chance to beat him.
SPEAKER_02: but I never thought that John could actually jump and hook him because he's so exposed to here. I remember when, when John tried to hook chance job, you know, you know, he jumped and he lost, but of course he was the very beginning of John. But I also think that, uh, chance pronator is probably not probably stronger than, uh, pronator because when Takashi pull chance,
SPEAKER_02: Chance was able to take his wrist. Yes. Scott was able to hook Corey West. So what I understand is Corey's pronator, he really needs to work. I think with a much better pronator, Corey could be much more dangerous puller. Yeah, this is what I think, yeah. Anyway, so I think that we covered everything. David we forget? Oh, the Ryan versus...
SPEAKER_02: ray coach ray versus ryan bowen who is winning here what do you think you think i'm the organizers don't ask me okay i will tell you because i said this to ray as well ryan has the edge ryan is the favorites ryan is a bigger guy bigger guy he's taller guy uh i have seen ray even pulling in
SPEAKER_02: 154, 70 kilos. He's not 70 kilos. He's now 90 kilos. But he's like, I don't know. Ryan is naturally a bigger guy. So I think now they are meeting at Ryan's weight class. Bowen? I don't understand. Ryan Bowen. Ryan Bowen, yeah. Ryan is much taller. Ryan is about like
SPEAKER_02: six one he's like 185 185. yes ryan is 185 while ray is probably 170. yeah yeah so the guy is bigger yeah this honest critic is asking you pradeep if you want even a small tournament my friend please don't use the protector uh start arguing with ready if the guy is just just joining us you know just to
SPEAKER_02: I have never competed in a small tournament. I have competed three times and all of the times in nationals, not below that. Listen, one time Pradeep travelled here to Istanbul. He came in gym, he beat me in every way, in hook, side pressure and top roll. See, now after this, what are you going to talk about him?
SPEAKER_00: actually i did beat you once in my dream seriously i had a match i had a left-handed match with you and and i did beat you again in my dream are you serious yes i did i don't know i don't know something is wrong with me in my dream
SPEAKER_02: I'm removing you from the stage. One second. In my dream, I never have a match with the guys who are at my level. I have matches sometimes with Michael Todd, sometimes with you, sometimes with Devon. I only have these matches. See, Parker says that Ray 3, Bowen 1. So, he believes that. I'm not offended, my friend. I'm not offended. I'm just joking. We're teasing each other. Don't think we all are laughing and you are saying that I'm offended. You know, come on.
SPEAKER_02: We are just friends, you know. Guys, please go to, please, please, you know, go to Hermes' channel and subscribe his channel. This guy is future star. Not the future star. He's today's star. Maybe future's very best in the overalls. We don't know. Of course, there is a big, big Everest, which is Levant.
SPEAKER_02: but this is one of the guys that you know uh will try to go over that mountain and please go and subscribe his channel uh and then let's help him to grow his channel and the new channel yeah your new channel here the big channel now he has to he has to uh get the new one new channel yeah yeah um steve
SPEAKER_02: He says, Engin, I will subscribe now to Hermes' channel. Thank you. I thank you very much. We need to support each other. Hermes needs to grow. So, guys, I think we did not forget other matches. Everything is covered. One more question. If you said that John is going to win and you said Hermes is going to win, correct?
SPEAKER_02: Correct? You said Hermes, not Hermes, Prudnik. Prudnik is going to win. And you said John is going to win, right? Yes. Yeah. And what if they meet in November? If, as you predicted, if Prudnik wins and the John wins and they meet 110 kilo in November. Together. Huh? They meet, we meet in November. Yeah. Who is winning there?
SPEAKER_02: john listen john is winning because you know he is your hero or his objective opinion come on listen listen do you feel like if you say prudnik you will betray john you don't want to predict he's very strong
SPEAKER_02: yeah yeah but you don't want to say that john is gonna lose or something right no yeah no yeah see you guys are totally obsessed see there is one more guy he's obsessed as well you know yeah it's good it's good yeah yeah john inspired all of us yeah and how what do you think about it who's winning there what do you think or john no i think i think prudnik i think prudnik
SPEAKER_00: I'm always surprised with John's one ability. John is not the fastest guy now. But he's very good at stopping other people's speed. Like he goes against Zoloev. He goes against Corey also. Very explosive. You put John against anyone. And no matter how fast he is. John is very good now at stopping other people's speed. And he kind of makes them look slow. But Prudnik I think still. His speed will be backed with so much horsepower. That John may not be able to stop him.
SPEAKER_01: David you expect John to jump and hook for the West? No. I don't expect this. Maybe in the top row like this. I don't know why. When I saw John go in the hook, I thought it was...
SPEAKER_02: I was like, wow. And he won from there. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Interesting. And one more from Anna's critic. He says, Hermes, nice that you are laughing all the time. I'm? You are all the time laughing, laughing. He said it's nice.
SPEAKER_02: It's beautiful laughing. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Your life is more longer if you continue. You think you live longer when you live? Yes. Yeah, okay. You have experiences about it from your last lives. Just joking. Anyways, guys.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, we forget about Kody Merritt versus Artem Morozov, left arm. How can we forget that? I apologize to Kody and Artem. Morozov. Morozov. So Morozov will be your opponent in November, in your opinion. Yeah, he will beat me, sure. He will beat you 3-0? Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Listen, first you said it's left arm, you know. Second, now you say Morozov is going to easily beat you 3-0. One more thing, I'm going to cancel that match. I'm going to cancel. One more thing you say. No, no. I tested my left with Urbeka. I'm very happy.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but you're training now, right? Yeah. The hook, but in the top row, I'm no better. You say your hook is better now than your top row with left? No. Oh, you say that your top row is better. In my left, compared to my right arm, or you...
SPEAKER_02: What do you mean? No, no, no. Left only, left only. If you pull against Morozov, your chance, you think it's inside or outside? Outside. Outside, yeah, okay, okay. I understand you're correct. Maybe if I don't, if I can't, I go inside. But I think it will be an interesting match. Yeah, yeah. If he beats Kody.
SPEAKER_02: But Kody also has incredible side pressure. Yeah? Yes. Yeah. I think that Kody, if Kody beats Morozov, Kody will be a big problem for you. Kody Mary. Yeah. His side pressure, without giving up on his pronator, his side pressure is very strong. Evgeny you take his wrist, he can still press that way. Very strong. Like a wall. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: My friend, you wrong. He will hit you like a box. We see my friend. We see. Sometimes I'm finishing now and sometimes I come to your channel as well. Yeah. Again, three of us. You, I and Pradeep. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, because if you and I only talk, you know, it's just sometimes we cannot find something safe. At that moment, Brady will be going, I have a question for you. Yeah. Okay, okay.
