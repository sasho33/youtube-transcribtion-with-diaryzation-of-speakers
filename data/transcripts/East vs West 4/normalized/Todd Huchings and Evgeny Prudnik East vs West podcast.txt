SPEAKER_01: you guys hear me right somebody wrote no sound okay okay that's good
SPEAKER_01: What? Okay, guys, thank you. Hello to Maine. Hello to Georgia. Hello, guys. Hello. Andrew. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: hammer training and some breast training and hello peter that's good that's good soon uh prudnik paulo and pod will join
SPEAKER_00: Today, I'm just, you know, I try to steer the boat. I don't really know if I'm doing good or not, but maybe I shouldn't do it. Maybe I should just let it go naturally how it goes. Yeah, Paolo, you know, Prudnik,
SPEAKER_00: i told brudnick that you know people like to hear you speak in english and but sometimes maybe sometimes he cannot express himself as he wishes maybe that time pablo could help him but i would i will i will ask him to speak english as much as he can and you compete when you're ready don't force yourself yeah you're right my friend but i don't even i don't even know if i will ever be
SPEAKER_00: Like ready, ready, you know, just, okay, who is coming? Somebody is joining. That's Evgeny. Evgeny, can you turn your phone sideways?
SPEAKER_00: Hello Todd, how are you? I'm doing well, hello, hello. Yeah, you are by the lake, but you are using program, right? To have that thing, you are outside. I'm at the house, I'm using the computer, but yeah, that's a river. Yeah, that's a river, yeah, okay, okay. So, you hear us, Prudnik?
SPEAKER_00: Anyway, so you send me today that picture, you look really big. You know, you know, you are, you know, people think that I was also thinking that your biggest weapon is your genetics. But I'm thinking that I said genetics because you started very late and you have incredible joints.
SPEAKER_00: I'm sure that it is because of some, because of your training methods was, I think that you have very good genetics. Not everyone can handle that kind of pressure, but I am thinking that I think your intelligence is ahead of your genetics. That is, you know how to prepare yourself, you know, you know, in what way for weak opponents, you know, you see, you know that you are saving yourself.
SPEAKER_00: the best of yourself for the toughest challenge. Yes, baby. That's me. Yeah, that's you. That's you. Yeah, the smart guy. Hello. Hello, Evgeny. How are you? Fine. Fine? That's good. You cannot turn the phone sideways, right? It's okay. Yeah. We still see you. Yeah. Yeah, that's better. Hello, Pablo. How are you, my friend?
SPEAKER_00: i'm good how are you hanging hi dad yeah we will we will ask kuznicki to speak english as much as he can and whenever he cannot express himself enough then yeah then i will ask your help but you can also be part of the conversation not only translated as we talked last time i was just saying paulo that you know thought is
SPEAKER_00: like we all think that he is so strong and this and that but as you see that he is also a very smart guy in my opinion very smart guy i mean the only good that you know he i i'm so like i shouldn't be thankful for this because he's not my opponent like if he also had such a dominant hand control then people would be in huge trouble but still they're in trouble but it could be worse
SPEAKER_00: you agree paulo yes yeah yes i always agree with uh uh smart comments yeah yes your kindness and uh evgeny your opponent was 100 kilo in istanbul east versus west three now he is 105 kilo and looks like you are in trouble now 105
SPEAKER_03: Yeah. No. Yes. My weight is... No, his. Todd's weight. Todd weighs 105. He asks, do you think you have problems? Speak English. Ah, 105. Okay, no problem. It's okay. 105, it's okay. Yeah, good.
SPEAKER_00: I think there is a problem with his connection. Okay, let's go. Todd is laughing there. Evgeny his phone is scared of me. Yes, yes, yes. That's true. That's true. His internet connection got scared of him. Yeah, but I think on your shoulders.
SPEAKER_00: your head everything just you don't you look like you don't have neck now it just goes from the head directly to the you know the shoulders you know trapezes yeah hey i have a question for you um are you in stronger shape than then when you pull iraqli i'm probably about the same after the iraqli match
SPEAKER_04: I was sick for a couple of weeks and, uh, but I'm coming back. I'm probably the same, but I, but for a Rockley, I trained because I knew he was top rolling, but I'm not so sure. Pruneck's going to top roll every match. So, you know, it's not, you get strong in one area, something else comes down a little bit. You always got to pick what you're, you know, what your strongest cause you can't.
SPEAKER_00: You can't train everything equally. There's just not enough time. So you got to trade off what you're going to train and what you're going to sacrifice a little bit. Yeah, I agree. I agree. So since he can pull in many different ways, so you had to be prepared for everything. Do you see, do you see like whenever I saw their practice pool in East versus West, uh, two in February, um, I saw that.
SPEAKER_00: like whenever they both go outside it actually seem better but whenever you pull with directly directly seem like a top role you but more you apply the side pressure more your pronators uh get in effect and then at the end he even lost his wrist am i mistaken
SPEAKER_04: I think a little bit, but I don't think he lost it. I think he was trying to adjust and it just dropped away from him. I don't think my wrist overpowered his. I think he was just, I don't think he's ever arm wrestled somebody like pulls like I do before. So he was just trying different things, you know?
SPEAKER_00: But I am sure that his wrist was like this at that point, but didn't end up like this. It ended up like that way. Because the more you apply pressure, the more he tried to stop you with his back pressure. So he did not focus on your pronator. So he focused on pulling the strap from here. At the end, he had to give up probably on his wrist a little bit. But when you pull Prudnik,
SPEAKER_04: do you expect someone with less back pressure and more hand control yeah i think i think prudnik's probably the closest arm wrestler to john ever you know i think his hand is so good and so dominant that allows you know that allows john to hook or top roller press just because his hand's so good and i think i think prudnik's probably the closest arm wrestler to john since john
SPEAKER_00: I agree. I agree. I think so too. Yeah. He's more of a control puller. He's strong. He has pressure. But I don't think that his side pressure is as strong as yours with a flat wrist. So I think that either you need to hook him
SPEAKER_00: my opinion or you need to keep his wrist flat as you were able to do it. Do you think that you will have to go to a strap? I know I shouldn't ask you. But I pretty much want to go to the strap no matter who it is. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, if I was pulling Sarah, I would put her in the strap just so you know. Yeah. But I kind of think that you improved your skill
SPEAKER_00: to sleep better after Hajumrat match. Yeah, well, when you start arm wrestling better people, you become a better arm wrestler. Whether you win or lose, better arm wrestlers make you better. Absolutely. A question to you. One more question before I ask Rudny. You know, of course, like you get prepared for Irakli. You won, but before the match,
SPEAKER_00: You didn't know exactly how it will be. You have plans, but are you more nervous to face Prudnik than Irakli? Was Irakli more simple to analyze compared to Prudnik?
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I knew a rocket was going to top role. I didn't think you would hook. I didn't think you would press. Um, it was easier to develop a plan for a rock with improvement because I know what you do, but top rollers are troublesome for me.
SPEAKER_04: know so i would much rather pull somebody who only hooks you know like i would i would much rather pull jordan than iraqli you know yeah yeah yeah but like i said you know prudnik's just dangerous like john's dangerous you know just because he's so he's so versatile and so like i said he's probably closer to john than devin ever was because as versatile as devin was i really don't think he had the depth and all the different skills that john had
SPEAKER_00: no devil devon's hand control is not as good as uh prudnik's yeah prudnik is just like he's using his hand like john was doing you know it's all super good and control risk control um and uh rudnick how do you see this match my friends uh repeat question how
SPEAKER_03: uh i don't know i think uh i feel how much it seems in first round when we take keep wrist and feel the first round
SPEAKER_00: show what happened in the future yeah but you also have your plans right but you also have some plans right plans you know you say that you will understand everything but you already have some plans in your mind
SPEAKER_00: No, I don't have a plan. I will be resting at the table. Do you remember you said that, you know, one time you said on a YouTube show and one time you said privately, when we talk like this, that I said, you know, how do you plan to pull
SPEAKER_03: You said you will even try to go inside. Do you still say this one round or not? Now I don't know because Tachin is now 105 kilos. And I decided when I see him and feel his hands,
SPEAKER_03: okay so so you are saying that mainly you're gonna focus on winning and then you will decide if if you win you you may try to go inside yeah so that's exactly what we thought right that uh prudnik have abilities to pull anywhere and he doesn't really need the plan right he can figure out things when he grip up as a tad and yeah absolutely that's that's a good plan too in my opinion right
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, but even if you are jumpersing, you still make some analyzing about your opponent and where to pull, how to pull. This is always good. Your well-roundedness is needed. It is effective only if you make right decisions. And your hook may be good, but if you don't do good analyzing, go hook against someone.
SPEAKER_00: the wrong person then then it is not going to help you so yeah that is i would go hook with uh is the one who yourself that you are the best 242 in the world
SPEAKER_04: You cut out a second, so I'm not sure I heard, but if you're asking me if Prudnik's the best... I don't know what's wrong with my... Guys, just wait. I will...
SPEAKER_03: Zheka, stop eating. I envy you. It's a chewing gum. It creates a look. How much do you weigh? 112. Wow, beautiful. Yes, serious weight. It will be necessary to gain 5 kilograms.
SPEAKER_03: Well, 5 kilos, probably not so much, right? So real, calm. You won't lose strength at 5 kilograms. And not little. Well, yes, I'll try. What's wrong there?
SPEAKER_03: Where is Tad? I had to leave and change the phone.
SPEAKER_00: uh pull the uh page sideways so that we all can be in the uh where is do you know where todd is nope somewhere in ohio i believe hmm
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. I have to change. Yeah. Sorry guys. Um,
SPEAKER_00: So I don't know. I hope he's going to come back. Okay. Yeah. David you, did you text it to him? Um, the one that I can text with him, text to him is the one that I'm using now. The other phone. I don't know. Can you, I don't know. Is it possible? Can you reach him? I can try. Give me a second. So Evgeny, are you, your, your shape right now is, uh, better than the previous one in may.
SPEAKER_00: when you pull a mask? Are you in bed with him? No, worse. Come on. And May, I had 85%, now it's 75%. Just stop, you know, stop. You know that it's not true. Seriously, just tell honestly.
SPEAKER_03: What's your shape? I can't say. Yeah, but you can. You can know by judging the weights that you lift. Weight is now 112. He's asking the weights you lift. No, no, hold on a minute. He's asking the weights you lift.
SPEAKER_00: now i work with lightweight lightweight only short angle pump that's interesting yeah i really don't think sorry todd i had to leave because of the bad connection my friend
SPEAKER_00: Now is it better? Can you hear me? We can hear you. Now Todd has a better connection, I think. You hear us, Todd? Hello, Todd? Hey, hello. You hear us? I hear you now, yep.
SPEAKER_00: yeah and yeah okay my connection was bad so i i connected with different phone um that is prudnik the person to beat you know for you so that you can you can say that i am the best 242 in the world oh yeah that's that's easily prudnik of course yeah
SPEAKER_00: So you are saying that right now Prudnik would be like better than 242 John, 242 Devon, and other 242s? Hmm. Yes. Yes. I think at 242 Prudnik would be better than both John and Devon. So you are saying that looks like you are the, you are the,
SPEAKER_00: biggest hope on august 6th all right you have to repeat that one again yeah so you are saying that you are the one to stop this guy oh yes i am the one to destroy his dreams let's do that yeah yeah yeah i am i understand i understand so i'm just trying to
SPEAKER_00: I mean, I know you're a smart guy. I know you are not, how to say, you are not stuck up. And I don't know if you would just say whatever is in your mind openly, but like, do you, like you made a song about Iraq, you're gonna hook him, you're gonna beat him, you're gonna beat him. And so are you as confident about coming to Istanbul and beating this guy?
SPEAKER_04: my prudnik song is not as confident as my iraqli song okay did you make one already or are you gonna make i am working on it the video's better but the song's not as confident okay but but do you remember on the press conference you said you will probably dance for him but you change your mind you're gonna make strong again oh
SPEAKER_00: Maybe both. We'll see. It's always it's hard. It's hard to predict the future. I'm fat now. I can't dance as good as I could when I was 220 pounds. Yeah, I understand. I understand. Yeah. Yeah, I just wanted to. Yeah, I can't wait to hear that song. I think it's going to give us some ideas about how you feel about this match. But you said it's not as confident as the other one. So I kind of feel like it's like 50 50. You see the match.
SPEAKER_04: well yeah i'll either win or i'll lose that's 50 50. no i mean did you see the same way about directly to be honest with iraqli his his training with levon scared me but i've been getting better and better against top rollers so um and you know since i wasn't worried about him shoulder pressing me
SPEAKER_04: I felt pretty confident about Iroquois. Now, it was, he did blow up my arm and he did, it was a lot harder. When I was done, I was, you know, I was sore for a couple of days ago. So he really did attack my hand and arm a lot. But I also think he was getting tired too. I think towards the end, I think we were both exhausted. I don't know if either one of us could have gone another match or two. Because I was, I mean, my hand wouldn't even close at the end.
SPEAKER_04: Um, but you know, you kind of, if you know, the guy's going to top roll and you know, he's going to top roll one, it's not like John who can top roll two or three different ways, you know, Iraq has that signature top roll style and he wasn't so tall as to, you know, give me a lot of problems with the geometry of it. So, you know, I just thought if I could keep my, I thought if I could protect my hand, I had a pretty good shot, you know? And so I was probably,
SPEAKER_00: i probably gave myself a 70 chance of beating him even though i've never met him before yeah so you gave yourself 70 chance before the match you come to istanbul yeah yeah yeah people people said that you destroyed him you didn't even feel him but whatever i hear right now is that he really pushed your limits this is what i understand yeah it the thing about super matches is
SPEAKER_04: you can have a three zero score against two people and one person's 0.5% better. That's enough to sway it to three zero. If everybody stays in their lane, you know, and it's very rare to have a three, two super match, you know, most super matches go three zero. Um, I didn't destroy Iraq. I mean, it was tough. Um,
SPEAKER_04: mean i think in a year or two it would be 10 times harder to beat him than it would now because he'll just be that much better and i'm going to be about the same do you think do you think that his problem was uh like strength or is it because of the way that he pulls his strategy i think he had plenty of power he just wasn't
SPEAKER_04: i don't think he was used to having full hand control and not winning so i don't think he knew you know i i think he was just looking for a plan b at the last minute you know um you know he might have he might have done better had he tried to come inside you know jordan tried to topple you know what i'm saying so because you know so those are my last two matches were two guys who like did who had one play you know just one trick so but
SPEAKER_04: You know, when you're young, you do stuff like that when you're just starting out. It's no big deal. I was told that you were going to pull Marcio. Is it still on in October or it is not? As far as I know, it's on. When I saw he got hurt in Dubai, I contacted the promoter and I said, you know, if Marcio's hurt, is that match still on? And last I heard, Marcio said he should be good to go by October.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, he's ready, I understand. And Prudnik said that he was 85% against Matt Mask, and he says he is now 75%. Do you believe him? Hey, what he did to Matt Mask was impressive. I couldn't beat Matt Mask the way Prudnik did. So I was, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: i didn't like watching that that that was that batch was uh that was interesting because i could i can't hook matt masking like that i don't have that kind of hand you know so brooklyn brooklyn's got a good shot i'm telling you man he's a bad he's a bad dude yeah yeah but but you you have the horsepower that makes you special that that is
SPEAKER_00: I mean, you don't really get one by the goalie once in a while. You know, your your side pressure is so strong that you are making people losing the control. Evgeny if they have the control, they have the control in Orthodox style of match. But once a huge pressure is coming that way, and then when your hand is going outside of your shoulder, and it is not working, as you know, it should be, you know, so your horsepower, and
SPEAKER_00: Can you ask Prudnik, just to translate it so he would understand the question, what is his biggest concern about Todd Hutchings' pulling skills? What makes Todd so effective? What's the most dangerous thing with Todd?
SPEAKER_03: I think very dangerous is his hook, his high hook.
SPEAKER_00: Under his side pressure. He's looking at his side pressure, yeah. I understand. Do you think that he will have... He will have... How to say? He will have... A phone came and... And him... When he pulls against you. Renation in hook.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know, a call came and the sound... No, we can see you, we can hear you. Do you guys hear me? Yes, we can hear you and we can see you. Somehow I don't hear you very well. Somebody just called and it made things a little bit... Sorry for so much problems, you know. It's okay. Can you talk again, please?
SPEAKER_03: I don't know why this kind of thing always happens. One second, let me go out and come back again. Just one second. Tad, you're looking bigger. You really do, serious. Yeah, I'm huge.
SPEAKER_03: no no i'm just pulling the camera real close that's what makes it look bigger yeah yeah that's right when you stick your forearm to the camera right yeah like normal size now man no you're still big you're still looking very big how did 10 pounds make that big of the difference yeah wait say that i keep dropping my phone say that again how did 10 pounds make that big of the difference
SPEAKER_03: depends where you put it i suppose my legs didn't get any bigger okay here you go so what was his answer again somebody somebody called me i couldn't hear you guys he said that he will have the risk control or not when he will uh no he will repeat for everybody jacob повтори пожалуйста для всех еще раз что какой у тебя план против этого против его
SPEAKER_03: My plan destroyed Todd Hutchings. That's all. So you say that destroyed. You don't expect a hard match? You expect an easy match?
SPEAKER_00: uh no easy it's very hot it will be hot much but how is it destroyed you know when you say destroy it sounds like you know and you say hard match and you will destroy him i will try all we'll try all you when you say you will try all including hook uh
SPEAKER_00: i can't say okay then then you are not gonna try all yeah so the things are changing you know that is you know why i'm trying what i'm trying to do three months ago or three and a half months ago you were so confident you're gonna go slow hook and this and that and then a week ago
SPEAKER_00: When I talk with you personally, you said you will go always, including inside, hook. And now you see thought, huge. And now you are saying, maybe not hook, you know. So I'm just trying to see your evolution from there to here to this day. So that's good, that's good. So you are coming back to reality when the time is coming closer.
SPEAKER_03: it depends uh of um it depends yeah so but you understand his shape not by look but whenever you feel his hand right yeah okay i understand i understand what i feel yeah
SPEAKER_04: I understand you. Todd, do you have anything to say? Yeah, three months ago, he was going to hook me and just hold me there and laugh. Now it's close to close. Now he doesn't have a plane. In two weeks, he might just forfeit. So I don't even know if I'm buying a plane ticket.
SPEAKER_00: you already did you can just mail me my prize yeah yeah but i think the people who buys paper we will not be happy with this i see you very very well prepared i can see you i i don't remember that i don't remember many times that you look this big i realized this in one of those stores i saw you with art and taranenko
SPEAKER_00: together you're you know showing something teaching something on the blackboard and there i saw and i was like okay this guy knows you know how to prepare himself for different targets yeah i i realized it and then you send me a picture it just okay and now i see you as well now you don't look uh totally but uh before you were disconnected you know i saw your arm shoulder back everything yeah i can say that
SPEAKER_03: Prudnik, you are in trouble. You know that, right? Are you? Are you in trouble? He said, we will manage it. You will manage it? Okay. I understand. I understand.
SPEAKER_00: And remember, Evgeny, on the press conference day before, Irakli and Tadpul, I asked you, who is your toughest opponent? And you said Irakli. And Tad beat him. And you said that you felt Irakli and his power was very close to yours, your power. And he beat Irakli, and now he looks even bigger and stronger.
SPEAKER_03: Are you a little bit nervous? Because I didn't pull Irakli without wrist. Without wrist, didn't pull him. If Irakli open my wrist, I give you. Yeah, but let it go. Can you pull without your wrist? Are you good?
SPEAKER_00: are you good without wrist can you pull that's what he said no he's he's giving away as soon as they're not no no he gave in the practice he gave in the practice but if you want can you pull good without the wrist yeah but but do you remember when ongarbaev top rolled you you couldn't pull him that way uh i didn't uh with ongarbaev this too because
SPEAKER_03: I want to win him clean. Clean win. He wants to win clean with Ongarbaev without any mess up and cheating. Let's put it this way. If that risk pulling is cheating,
SPEAKER_03: then we have a big, huge cheater here in the program. Yeah, that's right. He says, well, I told him that you wanted to win cleanly and tried to explain cheating so as not to use any cheating. He laughs and says, if the lost brush is cheating, then we have the biggest cheater here in the studio right now.
SPEAKER_03: because tatashins can pull that way and you just call those people cheaters no he didn't call them cheaters but uh to explain what the the clean wind means i have to use this i know you do but hey i'm trying to translate it as close to reality as possible with all the uh you know with all the special uh national uh
SPEAKER_00: special language specialties. By the way, I want to explain to people who are watching us, about 400 people right now, that those helmet and the shield was the idea of Todd Hutchings. Not exactly, but I asked him, you know, what to do, like a belt or whatever. He said, give something from where you are from that should represent the nation that is the host in this event, you know.
SPEAKER_00: Thank you very much, Todd, for that. You are a smart guy for sure. Yeah. Thank you. But no, you did a good choice. That'll make it more memorable. No, you picked something good. It's very nice. Yeah, this is very, you know, handmade, good art. You know, I'm sure you will like it. I have a question, Todd. When you lost against Prudnik, people always brings this from Moldova event from 2018.
SPEAKER_04: But you had some tough matches before that, right? With both Krasimir and Samushia? I did. But that doesn't take away from what Prudnik did to me. He just outclassed me that day. I don't... I could have had zero matches and I would have lost that match to Prudnik that day. I just watched that the other day ago. In my memory, I thought it was closer to what it was. When I watched the video, I go, holy smokes, man, I wasn't even in that. That was...
SPEAKER_04: that was pretty impressive you know but that's it that was the first time i never pulled him does it play we had we had practiced around a little at zloty years earlier but i you know never officially pulled and uh how was that one how was that one that practice the practice is what i is when i knew his uh hand was good but i don't know if i was getting all of it but in that in that moldova match
SPEAKER_04: yeah i go holy this is like john this is like john getting angry at practice i mean that's that's what i felt with that hand it was uh it was pretty impressive you know i felt dennis's hand and i felt push car's hand and prudnik's hands up up there you know when when he when he fires off that that was uh that that that was impressive but you you you sure that you know uh
SPEAKER_04: you were not exhausted. Maybe that was one of the reason that you felt that helpless that moment. Maybe, and I was smaller and who, I mean, who knows, you know, it, it happens, you, you, you know, you win, you lose. Um, but yeah, it won't be a re you know, we're not going to rerun that match again. I'm not losing that fast. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, if you are not losing that fast, then the things are getting,
SPEAKER_00: you know, bad because the match stops, then Todd is just getting dangerous more and more and more. Yeah, that is. I also heard that you you came there. Not fresh enough. You had a super match or you had an event or something before that two weeks before? Yeah, I had something a few weeks before that. But that didn't you know that that doesn't back then I could pull every month or so.
SPEAKER_04: And, uh, and I still can, but I just can't pull every month for like nine, 10 months in a row. I think I'm finally, I think all these birthdays I've had are finally catching up to me. So, you know, I think I need two or three months off after about seven or eight months of competition, you know, and, and for years I've preached that you can't over-train in arm wrestling. And now I'm sitting here going, man, I have just run down. I think I'm over-trained. I got to recalibrate what I've been telling people for years.
SPEAKER_00: yeah yeah but just whenever you tell people the things for your case and case for other people may be different because of the age because of the you know different type of you know um so it's but i i i see that you are one of the most active professional armless at the elite level
SPEAKER_00: Like, you have been pulling nonstop. Like, John is number one about being active, and probably you are number two. You are just pulling, pulling, pulling. Yeah. Yeah. You did, yeah. Incredible, incredible job you are doing. Yeah. Everyone respects you. For sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. And so if we go to events, if we talk about some other matches,
SPEAKER_04: um how do you see for example john versus on garbaev you saw john last time pulling against corey west and yeah i think john's favorite against on gabaya but what i expected john to top roll corey bam bam bam
SPEAKER_04: You know, it's weird seeing John fighting back from a not classic top roll position. Now, it's weird seeing him not out top rolling people. It's scary seeing John pull without full control and still winning. Yeah, and I know how strong Corey is. So, Agabayev is probably, unless he flashes really quick,
SPEAKER_04: I think John puts the brakes on it. And I just don't think Ongarbaev is going to generate the force Corey did. And John's used to that now. So, but it doesn't look like John's top role is, you know, dominating people like it used to. And Ongarbaev should have a good one. That should be an interesting match. I think, you know, nobody bets against John. But Ongarbaev, if he's got a snappy, quick top role,
SPEAKER_04: know and force john to pull in that funny position again that could be interesting you know i just i just don't think on gabayev is big enough you know i i think john can pull these 300 plus pound people now and you know i just think i think i think what you're going to see is on gabayev is a very good accomplished well-rounded arm wrestler he's just going to look too small against john yeah i i think that he he will be using his power
SPEAKER_00: more effective than corey does and he will be more technical and hit into more difficult you know directions for john uh while corey is all about horsepower explosive you know to do pin pad uh but once he stopped the john seemed to just balance the match and won while uh ongarbaya will probably try to gain position first
SPEAKER_00: and put John out of, I think that in an equal, equally good position for them, I see John, you know, having edge. But if the match, if Ongarbaev gets much better position, then John may not survive, even if survives. I don't know how he, how it end up. So you think that John is the favorite here?
SPEAKER_04: i do i just think john's versatility and depth gives him the edge even if he's overmatched against somebody you know john just has a knack of winning tournaments and winning matches you know even against even if he's not the better guy he still figures out how to win yes yes yeah that's a championship mentality way above and beyond athletic skills i mean that's a mentality that
SPEAKER_00: You can't coach or train into somebody. Some people have it and some don't. Yeah, but it is because most of his career, like 99%, he did table training. So he knows how to generate winning pressure in whatever position he is at. He can still generate that winning pressure. He is able to do that in any, you are also able to do that in many different positions.
SPEAKER_00: But it is probably most of your career against very tough guys you were put into bad position. Yeah. Yeah. And how do you see, Rudny, how do you see John versus Ongar Bayer? I think first round will be a strap match. And I think
SPEAKER_03: It depends of shape on Ongarbaev and John Brzenk. If it will be same, they power same, I think will be this picture. Ongarbaev pulling and pull him elbow.
SPEAKER_03: uh back himself himself yes and uh less him level less him level but john brzenk must keep him little fingers and do and take a high part it's no problem for him i think he uh pulling always
SPEAKER_03: uh like this but if on gurbayev uh more will be will be in more shape good shape better shape than uh i think it is it will be problem
SPEAKER_00: So you are saying that if they come in equally good shape, then John has the chance, but if Ongarbaev comes in an incredible shape, then Ongarbaev has more chance, is what you are saying? Yeah. I have a question for you, Rudny.
SPEAKER_00: one of the rounds with with ongar where you both go top row you didn't lose your wrist right away but at the beginning you were like this this you know at the beginning with ongar web if john and ongar stops in the same position no wrist control but flat wrist both of them both of them at the middle like they stay like this who wins from there
SPEAKER_03: I think yes, it will be work. Who do you think will win? John will win.
SPEAKER_00: So you are saying that Ongar Buev, to win this match, he needs to have more control. If it is equally same position, then John is there. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, I agree 100%. I'm thinking as you do, yeah. Because John is more experienced, and I think John has probably more horsepower this way.
SPEAKER_00: i'm not sure about horsepower but ability of feeling that angle and uh find that niche where exactly to generate that pressure absolutely but uh horsepower i'm not sure that's also when you have the horsepower is not only hook horsepower it is the horsepower in that case like this is the horsepower that you can generate with pronator with outer side pressure
SPEAKER_00: you know, this is, this is also a horsepower. I agree. I agree. Yes. Yeah. I don't, I don't. Yeah. But also whenever I remember how, uh, on Garbo pulled against, uh, Alex, he didn't have so much hand wrist.
SPEAKER_00: but he was still able to. But I don't think that at that time Alex had the same coordination that he has today. He was just taking the hand, but he was getting so much apart at that time. Yes, too far. Yeah, too far he was getting. He is doing better now. His angles are better now. Yeah. So another match I would like to ask. I'm not going to go all of them because you guys, I don't want to keep you guys busy, but...
SPEAKER_00: Usually, those two matches, you versus Katachins versus Prudnik, and John versus Ongarbaev, are the ones that are personally taking most attention for me. How do you see that you pulled recently against Chen Xiao? It looks like he troubled you. You beat him, but he troubled you.
SPEAKER_00: He recently, yesterday, lost against Rambet, but with a top roll. And I don't think that Zurab has the same ability. So we know where Zurab is going to go. How do you see this match? Looks like, you know, once Chance can have the wrist control, he is doing very well. I saw that against you, Chance was, time to time, he was able to take your wrist
SPEAKER_00: but at the same time, he couldn't control your pronator. So he hit your hand, take your hand, but lost the control of his wrist over your pronator. And once he wanted to control your pronator, then he lost his own pronator and you hook him. So he couldn't do both of them. I think that in my opinion, someone to beat you, they need to do both of them at the same time. And do you think that Zurab has the same pronation control that you have?
SPEAKER_04: I had trouble with chance because the size of his hand and I think the Rob's hand is my size or smaller so if chance keeps it out of the straps, then I think chances top role will be effective but.
SPEAKER_04: I think if Zurab throws him into the straps, Zurab can pull in an ugly position and he's definitely got the power. I think if they go into the straps, Chance probably takes Zurab's hand, but Zurab just wedges his arm in there. And I mean, I'm guessing Zurab has the power to beat Chance without his own hand.
SPEAKER_04: So if, uh, if the Rob can slip on chance, I think Zurab wins every one of those matches. If chance can keep the strap, the match out of the straps, I think chance will win those matches. So, um, I think the beat chance, I just think chance has a way better hand than Zurab does. I have a question for you. Don't you think that your pronator played a role against chance? It does, but, um,
SPEAKER_04: But when you're in the straps, you know, you just need your pronator to keep your palm from going up. Yeah. So as long as you can wet your hand, I don't care if your palms straight up and down or even slightly angled. As long as your palms not facing the ceiling. Do you think that your pronator was strong enough to stop Chance fully controlling your arm? You know, because I see that more he went out,
SPEAKER_00: more his wrist get flat so do you what i'm just saying that don't you think that someone like zurab fully spinating will give zurab uh no chance ability or chance to fully cop i think uh i was trying very very hard to top roll chance i wanted to top roll him i saw right um
SPEAKER_04: Joe Piazza, If I had to pull chance again I would slip going to the straps and I would stop top rolling and I would just blast into them and see. Joe Piazza, Then I would see how strong that elbow really was I think the rob isn't going to try and top roll them I think he's going to slip and smash into them and. Joe Piazza, I think if they're in the straps chance gets pinned with full hand control.
SPEAKER_04: That's what I think happens. I think Chance has all the hand control in the world and Zurab still pins him. You know, like he did, I think the Chance-Zurab match is going to look like the Zurab and Ron Bass match. Except I'm not, but I don't think Chance has Ron Bass endurance, so I don't think the matches will be that long. So...
SPEAKER_00: Usually, if Chance is watching this, stay out of the straps, Chance. If you go into the straps, it's going to be trouble. Yeah. I mean, yeah. I'm just wondering if your pronator wasn't as strong as, you know, how it is. Like, would you have more problem against Chance? This is what I'm saying.
SPEAKER_00: Like, if he was able to fully cop your pronators, I think it would be much harder for you to beat Chance. I'm not saying you couldn't, but it would be hard. Do you realize that first round, whenever he took you and he wanted to go, when he elbow fell, he hit you and his wrist went like this. It was because of his wrist that he couldn't go. His wrist gets flattened, you know. Just watch the video. It is your pronating. Chance needs more experience with elite level people. I mean,
SPEAKER_04: Chris Steininger, Chance and doing real well lately but he's pulling a lot of elite level people sooner or later something's going to click. Chris Steininger, And then he's going to be a whole lot better what what what chance is doing right now is he's just going to school. Chris Steininger, And he's not passing a lot of tests but he's gaining a lot of that's pretty soon elite arm wrestlers pulled differently than the people at your practice.
SPEAKER_04: it takes a long time for people to separate that you know so pretty soon like like maybe next year maybe in two years all of a sudden chance is going to look untouchable and everybody's going to say he's got new training he's on new gear he's got the sub secret and all he did was got a little bit smarter you know and it made him 10 times stronger i i think a little bit dominating wrist he will be very good how do you see prudnik you know chance show right
SPEAKER_03: You know Chen Xiao, Prudnik? How do you see he and Zurab? How do you see who is winning that match? I don't know. Zurab has big legs. Oleg? Oleg, yeah. And the further the better.
SPEAKER_03: The farther the bigger. And I don't know the shape of Zurab in August. I think he will be more. Yeah, stronger. And he will win. He can win.
SPEAKER_00: And Todd, I know he's your teammate, but how do you see, if you look with the objective wise, how do you see Jerry versus Genadi? This is for the Superairway title. Man, I love Jerry. I just think Genadi is something else, you know, and
SPEAKER_04: I want Jerry to win, but I think Genadi is well aware of what Jerry's going to do, and he probably has the power to deal. I would have to say Genadi's the favorite in that match. And you, Prudnik? Genadi, yeah. Genadi. Now Genadi very, very strong. And I think I'll read Genadi.
SPEAKER_03: Virginia. I understand. And Brooding, how do you see Dave Chaffee versus Morozov? Right arm? Very interesting. If Morozov win, he very great go up my level. Yeah. Yeah. And how do you think he gonna win? Yeah, I understand.
SPEAKER_03: He will be in your level. If he wins, it means that he is in your level. And you think you can beat Dave Chaffee? But I have doubts. He's doubt that Morozov will win Dave Chaffee. Jack, Engin is asking you, do you think you can win Dave Chaffee? Me?
SPEAKER_03: uh okay we can't speak about this after much uh with touching did he say that did he say that morozov is gonna beat dave no no he said he said that he's doubted that morozov will be dead he doubted okay okay yeah so the hf is gonna win and todd yes yeah i think i think dave chafee beats morozov yeah
SPEAKER_04: this time i think so yes bro rozov's tough and i really really like him but dave chafee if i think dave chafee will come better prepared for endurance and then that level of power is just is just something else because it comes from a weird a weird position and it's unrelenting but yeah if dave gets his endurance up and catches up on his sleep or whatever but uh
SPEAKER_04: Yeah. I think, I think Dave wins that now it might go three, two, but I think Dave, um, obviously looks like he, he won that match. Hmm. I understand. And if we go to other matches, like Derek and Ravas. Man, I don't know. Oh, the first time I saw Ravas was at the last one. And that was impressive. Um,
SPEAKER_04: Derek's impressive, but I think Revaz is probably the favorite there. If Derek wins, it's an upset. I think Revaz is easily the favorite. I think he's a favorite. I think he's a pretty comfortable favorite in that match. Todd, Revaz was away from arm wrestling a few years, three years or four years. And then he came a few months later, he faced Michael Todd. And
SPEAKER_00: you think that if this guy trains constantly and pays the price do you think that this guy has chance to be like an opponent for anyone or
SPEAKER_04: I think if I think if you come back after months, I think if a few weeks training after months off and you handle Michael Todd like that, I think you're already a world elite opponent. I think a year from now, he's just in a higher club, but yeah, I think he's, uh, I think he's already achieved what Derek's trying to get to, which is why I think he's the favorite, you know?
SPEAKER_04: Because he didn't just beat Michael Todd. I mean, he comfortably beat Michael Todd. So, yeah, I think, you know. But these young kids do shit weird every once in a while. They explode out of the scene and beat a couple of top guys. So it's hard to say. But I think Revaz is the favorite. And how do you think for Nick? Revaz and Derek?
SPEAKER_03: I think when Rivas looked there, because he is high, very high. Very high? Derek is even taller. Yeah? Yeah. Derek is taller? Yes. Seriously? Yes. Okay, Derek wins. Funny guy.
SPEAKER_00: We were still winning for it. You know, I have even more interesting question to ask our coachings. Cross him in versus directly. Oh, ah, whenever the question is hard, that that's the first reaction is Todd is doing when I asked him on the press conference, if it actually beats you, will you let him do this to you? And he was like, huh?
SPEAKER_04: this question never been asked to me. And he's like, yeah, it's a rock leavers Krasimir. Huh? I? Well, I don't know. I, you know what, I could make a case for either one of those guys. I don't know. I, I, yeah, I couldn't, I couldn't tell you I can't. I mean, I could convince myself of either one. So I don't even know what to say.
SPEAKER_00: So people are saying that after they saw Irakli beating Marcio and then Krasimir losing to Corey and Arif, they are saying that Irakli is heavy favorite, but like Arif is World Superweight Champion in 150 kilo, Corey is near 200 kilo, and this is what Krasimir has faced. And Irakli beats Marcio, but about what?
SPEAKER_00: little bit five weeks ago he lost against you so how do you see this match even if you don't know like who's gonna win do you do you see iraqi top rolling crossing it or do you see like in between somewhere like stuck like this if i see iraqli top rolling krasimir krasimir goes across the table to set the hook i think krasimir loses
SPEAKER_04: I think if Krasimir fires backwards to protect his hand, stops the match, and then sets the hook later in it, I think he can win. So I think they both have the power and the capability. It comes down to what strategy they employ. If I was there, I could coach either one of them into beating the other guy, but I have no idea what they're going to do, so that's why I can't pick. But I think if I was in either one of their corners, I could coach one to beat the other.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I think that after this program, you will be called by them and offer $500 to be on the corner during the match. I think this is exactly the situation where the styles make matches and the strategic planning will make that match. That's for sure. And Evgeny?
SPEAKER_03: I think Iraq has more... Maybe say in Ukrainian? More potential. I understand. More.
SPEAKER_03: when he pull with pull it with uh todd hutchins he do many mistakes but with mario he didn't he pulled him better and he he has a very great uh
SPEAKER_03: stronger, strong power. But he studied things at the table. So who is winning? And now I think it's 50-50, but he, but Irakli has more potential.
SPEAKER_00: When you say more potential for the future or what? Potential. Potential for the future. I understand.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I would agree probably with both guys that it's unknown and it's very depends on who coaching who. But yeah, in the future, because I think Krazy really now polishing his stuff and Irakli probably still very rough and
SPEAKER_03: he just started pulling elite level even his training with uh saginashvili doesn't mean everything yet because it's the same hand all the time and while now you inviting him then where where he actually learned to pull elite athletes and uh different hands and styles
SPEAKER_00: And I will ask this to only Evgeny that maybe Todd wouldn't know. How do you see Bozhidar versus Samushia at 85 kilo, Evgeny? Bozhidar and Samushia. 85 kilo. Bozhidar...
SPEAKER_03: What country is Bozhidar from? Bulgaria? He's the world champion. Simeonov. I think Simeonov is the favorite. Yeah? I understand, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: that that is that's interesting and you you follow both atlas paulo yes and uh i probably would agree with pruning that bojidar is a favorite in this match yeah let's see let's see let's see the how the how the matches will be and it is less than less than two weeks today 13 days left which day are you arriving
SPEAKER_04: um i think i think i'm leaving i have to check i think i'm leaving thursday so i think i get there thursday and and todd you are 100 sure that you skipped november right i'm 100 sure that i what that you skipped november yeah yeah i'm uh that's that's i go visit my family i i got a lot of family reunions and uh that's deer season everything in february
SPEAKER_00: february what about february can you hear me february's good good yeah okay i'll defend my title in february oh yeah wow so in in november we will not see the title match
SPEAKER_04: no no november is just like you're just gonna wrap up the season you can do all the bloopers and all the stuff that nobody's gonna tune in for everybody come back and see east first west five that's where the excitement's gonna be this versus five is november yeah okay come back and see six five you can skip five will be free yeah okay okay so in east versus west five in november we will see john brzing and prudnik match
SPEAKER_00: as um like two of the best hand controller guy ever but not the title match yeah that's like having a drag race between two skateboards i mean nobody cares did you hear that
SPEAKER_03: Zheka, do you understand what they're saying? They're laughing and joking. They're saying that they won't watch East vs West, because Hutchings won't come, he'll only come on the 6th. Engin says, no, we'll make a match between Prudnik and Brzenk to see who's better.
SPEAKER_03: Tad jokes again and says, well, fuck it, there's nothing to watch there, it doesn't matter that there are two dudes who ride a skateboard to watch. Why a skateboard? I don't know, because no one watches skateboarding, probably. Oh, I see.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, he says that your match with John will be only show match, not title match, because he's going to beat you 13 days later. He says he will kick your ass.
SPEAKER_03: Our fight with John Brzenk will get the biggest views.
SPEAKER_03: saying that uh the fight with john brzenk will gain the majority of the views the most of the views yeah but not the title match is a title i don't understand what does it what does it mean does it matter if it's title or non-title who cares yeah when you're pulling john brzenk is it no no no no it's definitely
SPEAKER_00: John Brzee can pull someone. This guy, this guy, that guy, that guy. It's different. But John Brzee pulling for title. See, Evgeny and Todd Hutchings, they are going to pull for the 110 kilo East versus West world title. So Todd Hutchings to say that Prudnik versus John will not be a title match, it means that Todd is going to beat Prudnik. And that match will not have anything like that. And Prudnik has anything to say against or he says,
SPEAKER_03: know nothing okay i now i know why you're having me here because this stuff to translate and explain it will take me 20 minutes hold on jacob so he said that like yes john brzenk will fight with prudnik
SPEAKER_03: in November, but it will not be a title match. What does he mean? He means that he will win you now in two weeks, and therefore you will already be a loser, and it will not be a title match. So if I win, it will be a title match?
SPEAKER_03: Yes, but he said that it would not be a title match. Now you can say that everyone is bad and you will break them all. I think that Todd Hutchings does not want to participate in November, because he already feels that his hand will not recover after a terrible loss.
SPEAKER_03: Evgeny is saying that Todd Hutchings doesn't want to participate in November because he already knows that after the scary losing, his arm will not be ready for any pulling in November. Yep, see, that is what I get, you know, after one hour trying.
SPEAKER_00: Tata Cing says that that match will not be a title match. And he says Tata Cing already knows that he will get hurt in August. So that's why he's skipping November 11. So as an organizer, I get what I needed. Now we can finish here. After the last question, Tata, after you beat this guy, will you wrap his head?
SPEAKER_03: Oh, I don't know. It looks like there's a lot of gel in that. I'm going to have to wash my hands first.
SPEAKER_03: He's saying that after your match, guys, you will grow the long hair like a Matt Mask. But why is it? Because he will add his... Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: The wizard rubbing he has that the hair will start growing. Electric rubbing. I wish I would have this much. I would be just like, wow, that close. Straight the shoulder, square.
SPEAKER_00: and wrist straight, knuckle open. Wow. So to be that close witness that match, I would probably forget about calling the fouls and I would be just watching like this. So I better not ref. That's why you cannot ref. That's my problem too. I'm watching the matches. I'm not refing. Anyways, thank you very, very much, Todd, for being our guest. Same to you, Evgeny. Thank you for coming. And
SPEAKER_00: Thank you very, very much, Paulo, for being our guest and also helping for translation. I didn't help much. Yeah, about like more than 400 people watch us. I hope that you guys enjoyed it. I enjoyed it so much, especially the last part. Finally, I was just like, you know, unlike the other guys, you know, these guys are just really challenging each other, saying that they are going to do this. I love it. I love it. Yeah. Now I can't wait to watch. You take care. And I see you guys in
SPEAKER_00: probably 10 days. Thank you very much. You want the room from the sea view, right? I do not want to be looking at the sea. I want to look at the train. I just said train, yeah. Just joking. You take care. Take care, guys. Thank you very much. Bye-bye. Thank you.
