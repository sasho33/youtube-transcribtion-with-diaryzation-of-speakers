Speaker: you
SPEAKER_01: Oh, you're looking young. You're looking clean shaven. Yeah, I intentionally don't save, you know. Because I just want to save my young years for the later, you understand? I just keep them. Yeah. So I spend the old years already.
SPEAKER_01: When I come to 60, I will use the years from the 40s. That's a good idea. The same thing. I'm going to keep my hair until I'm older, and then I'll shave it. Yeah, yeah. Smart. How have you been, my friend? Training my ass off. Yeah, you better. You better. I'm waiting for Revaz to come. I got COVID yesterday. I mean, probably I got
SPEAKER_01: three, four days ago, but first two days tested negative, usually it shows a little bit later. And so I don't feel good, but I need to promote the event. So you are, you are training your ass off. You better, you better. Because,
SPEAKER_01: People have been blaming me. Oh, that's a mismatch and this and that, you know? And of course I can't, I can't hold sides, but you know, I want you to perform good. Yeah. I'm trying not to let you down. You know, I'm trying to, I don't want to be mismatchy. I feel good. I feel good. Your shoulders, your chest, trapezius, you know?

It all lifts and everything, every measurement I have, I have the strongest version of myself by a good amount. That's good. That's good. Yeah. I mean, before you pull, Artem, on my YouTube poll, you were heavy favorite.
SPEAKER_01: You lost. This time, Revaz is the heavy favorite. Right. And Revaz was the underdog against Michael. It was like 80-20 or something, you know. Right. But he won there. So, I mean, hello, Saptabi. Hello, Georgi, Sandris, Clerks, Dave, Guga. If I pronounce your names, you know, wrong. Sorry. So, just like anything can happen.
SPEAKER_01: Anything can happen, you know. Is that Revaz? Yes, that's Revaz. Revaz, can you turn your phone sideways? Thank you. Revaz, your translator will come in one, two minutes, okay?
SPEAKER_01: He doesn't have audio yet. He says he's connecting the audio. One guy says that, Coach Ray says that, about Derek being involved in some esports or something. He would like to know what it is.
SPEAKER_01: is there anything you can tell about it or not coach ray's asking about me being involved in esports no no no no somebody's saying that coach ray mentioned something about you being involved just just look at the chat chat if you can see what ray says that um
SPEAKER_01: About Derek being involved in some. yeah so I used to be. You can tell about it or not. yeah yeah. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
SPEAKER_02: um yeah i used to be a professional video game player so i used to fly around the united states uh competing in video game tournaments i did that for like six years five or six years uh for a game called halo and a game called call of duty um that was my life for a long time so it sponsors and i was on teams with jerseys and i would fly around and be on big stages playing for lots of money so that's what they call esports um
SPEAKER_02: so yeah i went from that and that's where i actually got involved with arm wrestling at a video game tournament i met uh ethan fritchie uh don fritchie's son the arm wrestler and um they taught me arm wrestling and kind of i got that's how i got into it okay hello hello roman uh can you tell us that you think oh yeah can you tell us to uh that you know we say
SPEAKER_00: He's greeting to me. So what was it you wanted me to tell him? No, first of all, we tell him that welcome. It's nice to see him. And then second of all, let's start directly deep into it. What percent is it?
SPEAKER_00: Greetings to you as well, all of you guys. Thank you.
SPEAKER_01: Now I think he will start at 35%. 65% at most. And then he still has like three weeks, so it will be about 65%.
SPEAKER_00: I changed my answer. I'm 64%. I'm 64% right now. I'm 1% less than Rivas. In November, he's saying he's planning to be 80% in November.
SPEAKER_01: In November 80% yeah. So if he was 40% last time and now 60 65 so from last time when he meet Michael to this time, he will be minimum 50% stronger than previous game.
SPEAKER_00: He says he's realist. Like he says what's real. Most likely he will be 80% in oil. He will be 80% in August or?
SPEAKER_01: In November, that's his realistic date. Yeah, but he needs to focus on August 1st, because if August is no success, Revaz may not see November.
SPEAKER_00: It's sweet. Tell him to keep focusing on November. Focus on November. It's okay.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, he ignores everything, guys. Don't worry, everything's going to be good. Don't be scared.
SPEAKER_02: So I'm definitely, I'm definitely a hundred percent. I was joking around about 64% thing. I mean, this is my first time being this strong. I know Revaz in the past has reached other heights, you know? So I understand him not being at his highest peak. That makes sense for me. This is my first time climbing this strong. So I'm a hundred percent on the strongest I've ever been, you know? I understand. Yeah. Maybe, maybe you also translate what Derek says.
SPEAKER_00: OK, no problem. He's wishing you the best. Good luck. I wish him the best as well.
SPEAKER_01: All right. Derek, the question is, if you beat Rivas, I know you focus now to beat Rivas, who would you want to pull next? Or that is nothing right now. I've been asked that a lot. All I care about is beating Rivas. About...
SPEAKER_02: I got to establish this. If I'm going to be at this level, I need, you know, I need to establish this. And if, uh, this match doesn't go too well for me, then it, you know, it's kind of back to the drawing board a little bit. It's kind of a step back in terms of what I need to focus on. Um, so it'll kind of, you know, how this match goes decides on where I start looking, you know, so I don't even want to look past this match at all to, to see who I think of next until I get it done. And then, um, and then I'll start looking after that. Yeah. And I mean,
SPEAKER_01: Last time it was less than 20 days notice. You probably rested up to 10 days. Probably you train only like one week and came here. And I mean, I have to invite you here with enough notice so that you can come here 100%, even 105%, which is like even better than your previous best. So, I mean, that is why you really needed this chance
SPEAKER_01: And some people say that Revaz is, I don't know, too big of an opponent for you. But, I mean, that is how we prove ourselves, you know. Like, we face someone if we have dreams. Like, I mean, at least you will see where you are, if you understand. If you are good enough, you're going to win. If you are not good enough, then you will see where you are. At least you will know, you know, what you need to do, how much more you need to get better, you know. That is how I see this match.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I mean, I agree. I'm trying to take all these opportunities you've given me, Engin. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I believe in you. I believe in you. I mean, we never know the result, but I believe that, like, you know what you need to do. I mean, you're getting ready inside, outside, whatever, you know, and I think that you will be ready for every possibility. And then can you ask Revaz, Roman, if Revaz beats Derek, who he would want to...
SPEAKER_00: pool in November. That is 80%. Yeah, he underlined the fact that you have already talked about it and either Dave Chaffee or
SPEAKER_00: Do you think Jerry has no chance to face Hermes in November? I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so.
SPEAKER_03: So, he just kicked him.
SPEAKER_00: He is coming from this ground that you were talking about, that it will be still unclear, but either of those two, it will depend all on this August event. And you and him talked about this, so that's where he is coming from right now to give you this answer, either Dave Chaffee or Jerry Cadraz. OK, OK, but how does he see Genadi versus Jerry? Raspikrov, Genadi is the Jerry Shekhodraz. I think Genadi is the best.
SPEAKER_00: He's saying that Genoa will beat him 3-0. Genoa will beat Genoa 3-0? Yeah. Oh, I understand. And how does he think his match versus Derek? The thing is that Derek is much better as people.
SPEAKER_00: he will leave it as a surprise he will be surprised yeah it's surprise for derek and i guess for everybody else oh if it is if it is gonna be surprised the community is thinking that you're gonna win if it is surprised so you are thinking that derek is gonna win come on man
SPEAKER_00: I cannot understand when you both talk at the same time. What do you say? He's saying that you know everything. Nobody knows armlessly better than you, so he doesn't need to say anything else. You know what's going to happen. He says that he doesn't need to convince me about
SPEAKER_01: what i think uh yeah i don't know i don't know we will see we will see i wish i knew everything i wish i knew everything like till now like i just look at my predictions are
SPEAKER_01: correct, but like when last time I said John is going to win barely against Corey West, but I thought he was going to beat him with a tornado. And whenever he hooked him and beat him, I predicted the last round he went out finally outside, but he still stopped him in inside. So I was just thinking that he was going to beat him with tornadoes. So I predicted the result correct, but the way that he won, I was wrong about it. So I
SPEAKER_01: don't care so much about the result but how the match is gonna go so i was wrong about it so even i knew this called correct so who knows you know so so derek um listen are you intimidated by ravas
SPEAKER_02: no more than i'm intimidated by all the people at east versus west and all the legends so no not really um this is more uh an opportunity for me um that like i didn't uh you know with the with the morozov match i went into that
SPEAKER_02: Unsure, unsure of myself mentally, you know, not knowing where I was at because I didn't have time to prep and I wasn't sure about things were going to go. And I'll just try my best for this one. I'm going into it. I feel confident. There's no stone left unturned. I've done all the prep work. I've been in the gym every day. I've been doing all of it. And so I have confidence in that. I have confidence in the prep. Now I just need the...
SPEAKER_02: the version of myself to show up that showed up against Tim and then it showed my previous matches mentally. I think even if I was the shape, my best shape, like I was against Morozov, if I had showed up mentally and prepared,
SPEAKER_02: I think I could have done better, a lot better. So my goal, my whole thing I've been focusing on is the day of showing up at my best self over there. That's why I'm going to a week early. That's why I'm putting all this time and effort into making sure that the best version of me shows up on that stage. So I finally found what I've been clinging to. I like Rivas so much and I have so much respect for him as an arm wrestler that
SPEAKER_02: that it was hard to try to find something that was gonna make me angry and pissed off you know towards him uh yeah so but i finally found it like a week ago i was pacing around in my room in my in my living room i was so bad i got so mad at him and i was it started it started bubbling up and uh it was just
SPEAKER_02: basically in my mind and i know in no way is he like trying to do this but i'm saying basically he's trying to keep me from achieving my goals or my dreams you know what i mean in one way because he's standing in front of me right so i'm kind of clinging on to that like this man is trying to stop me from what i've been working my butt off for 12 years and what my dreams are in my life he's trying to stop me yes yes and that's what he's there for to stop me right so
SPEAKER_01: that's what i'm clinging to and it's honestly i can barely stand still right now even thinking about it it gets me so excited to arm wrestle him and throw myself at him so that's my that's my thing just remember that you know as you said but like we cannot all only beat the people who makes us angry right you need to be motivated and then beat nice guys oh no not like angry i want to fight him i'm just saying to give me that that yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah but just just as you said remember that
SPEAKER_01: Revaz is someone who is standing in front of your dreams. He cannot be a good guy. Oh, yeah. No, I was just saying, I was trying to find something. That's the best thing I found. That's the best thing I found for motivation. Yeah. Revaz, last time when you see Derek, he just came with less than three weeks notice, maybe a week of training and 10 days resting.
SPEAKER_01: He was not even prepared when he pulled Morozov. And now this guy is coming very well prepared. And when he was prepared, he had very convincing victory against Tim Bresnan. And now when I see, look at him, you know, right now in front of me, I see like someone is in very good shape. Is there was any intimidated by the local director?
SPEAKER_00: Revo, when you talk about Derek, it's as if you're talking about yourself. It was a new generation, it was a new generation, it was a new generation, it was a new generation, it was a new generation, it was a new generation, it was a new generation, it was a new generation, it was a new generation, it was a new generation, it was a new generation,
SPEAKER_03: Are you motivated by this or are you very busy? Well, I have to say that I have a lot of work to do. I have to say that I have a lot of work to do. I have to say that I have a lot of work to do. I have to say that I have a lot of work to do.
SPEAKER_00: So basically he's saying that he's estimating...
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, he's like judging realistically, not to say too much about it. He's just saying that realistically, looking at him, he estimates him at his peak, like at most. So he's not underestimating.
SPEAKER_00: But he's trying to see in his picture that Derek will be his maximum against him whenever they pull. So right now he sees Derek as his best shape, maximum shape possible. But still he's not feeling intimidated or he's not afraid or something like that. But he's trying to realistically look at Derek and not underestimate him. He's just focused on that one to correctly estimate.
SPEAKER_03: That's why I'm telling you that I'll be back in November. I'm not saying that I'm not going to be able to tell you directly what I'm going to do. I don't think I'm going to do anything.
SPEAKER_03: I think that there is a bit of a gap in the market, because I have been in the market for five years, four years, five years, and I have been in the market for five years, and I have been in the market for five years, and I have been in the market for five years, and I have been in the market for five years, and I have been in the market for five years, and I have been in the market for five years, and I have been in the market for five years, and I have been in the market for five years,
SPEAKER_03: It's not like you can't do it, it's not like you can't do it, it's not like you can't do it, it's not like you can't do it, it's not like you can't do it, it's not like you can't do it.
SPEAKER_03: In November, I think I will be able to do it. I will be able to do what I want and what I don't want to do. I will be able to do what I want and what I don't want to do. That's it. That's it.
SPEAKER_00: so uh he's uh also um i wanted to make sure that every you again and everybody else derek and or everyone who is watching us wanted to know correctly get his answer so the reason he mentioned november and his november shape and he's prognosing himself to be also already in november
SPEAKER_00: Its reason is not that he underestimates Derek or thinks that Derek is not worthy or something like this. He doesn't look at Derek as an easy opponent, no way. The only reason that he already sees himself in November, he said because of his progression. When he was asked about percentage, he wanted to say that in November he feels he will be so progressed.
SPEAKER_00: because so far he has uh has been looking at himself how he prepares during wafts he usually prepared only two months or so maximum so right now he's saying that since like four or five years that he has never competed
SPEAKER_00: his first official match after pause was your opportunity that you gave him and since then that he started actively to prepare enormously now he sees he was 40 then now he's like under 60 65 right so he genuinely thinks that november he will be better shape that's the only reason he mentioned november not just because he knows for sure that he will be i understand i understand yeah i understand um i want to uh tell you guys that the old school labs
SPEAKER_01: uh they sponsor my uh youtube channel social media and at the description uh you will see that there is a code engine if you if you uh shop from there with the code engine uh you will have some discounts and it will also support me just i just wanted to remind you guys uh and i want to thank you the old school labs uh sorry that i'm kind of slow because of the kovitz
SPEAKER_01: um i want to again again ask to uh rewa something again once he comes and if he doesn't come now i will go and talk with uh derek so let's let's go with uh derek since where was this done yeah yeah because i i don't want to forget because of the kovic my mind is like already very busy and what do you think about all this that he's saying uh that what was he saying
SPEAKER_01: about him preparing for November? No, not only that, that, you know, like that, does it like, like, because on the social media, like people talk like it's a mismatch and this and that, like whenever people talk about like that about me, uh, usually it makes me more motivated because you want to prove people that they are wrong because when, when everybody says, oh, England is going to win, why you said that match?
SPEAKER_01: And I'm like, you know, okay, everyone is convinced I'm going to win. So what am I going to prove? It needs to be something that you need to prove. You understand people that they say you can't, and then you just try to do your best and you prove them wrong, you know? So, um, and then, but unlike the social media opinion, like 80% looks like, um, he thinks that, you know, he doesn't underestimate you.
SPEAKER_02: and he sounds like you know he's taking a little city how does it make you uh feel um the the social media thing um i mean i've been around like i said from the video game thing i did before uh to all the stuff i'm involved with now with discord and reddit and facebook and youtube and i mean i'm deeply in all the community uh for our message community so um i've handled that pretty well the social media pressure
SPEAKER_02: um more more than anything it's just as a man like uh you know i have an opportunity i want to achieve something great and so that that's that's the pressure i mean i'm just i'm happy that after my last poor showing i'm happy that i have this opportunity honestly that's what i'm clinging to i have i got one more opportunity i don't want to mess this up you know i'm gonna be on this big stage the biggest stage there is um i've worked so hard to be here like
SPEAKER_02: i it just just keeps repeating in my in my mind you know that i don't have unlimited opportunities these won't just keep showing i'm catching you i'm cutting you for a shortly but just know that when you say oh it's opportunities we are very honored and proud to have you here my friends well it's my honor to be here of course yeah yeah um so yeah i just i don't want to mess it i don't want to mess this up and if i want to achieve these goals that i've set out for myself i mean i have to win like there's no other way around it you know um so
SPEAKER_02: That's uh, yeah, that's all the pressure I need. But yeah, the social media pressure thing, that's not too rough on me. Um, I mean, I was the big underdog leading my Tim match and I'd prefer that. I mean, it's easier that way to be the underdog. I liked it. So, and I know, and I know who, I know who, um, you know, Revaz is, I know his, his track record and who he's beaten and you know, when he's top form, what he can do. I get that. I understand. I kind of think that Revaz has never ever reached to his
SPEAKER_01: like best i i always saw him but this is also what he said you know in the last time uh when we when we uh how to say uh talk about himself he said that he never ever took arm wrestling that seriously but he said this time he is going to take seriously and he said that it was leon's dream once to beat us
SPEAKER_01: he says now it's the opposite way it is rewa's dream to be level now do i think that he can beat him in soon period of time no but do i think that he does if he has potential with the size and everything he may have that so i cannot say that yeah i can you ask where was um
SPEAKER_01: Revaz is a just remember good this question Revaz is a like top roller his main weapon is top roll so now keep that on your mind please Roma whenever Genadi and Michael pulled but remember please good so we don't want to miss anything Genadi went outside and beat Michael yes then before mayor went we saw
SPEAKER_01: Genadi and Revaz training. And Genadi was trying to top roll Revaz and Revaz was beating him like nothing. And then time to time, Genadi was hooking and beating him. And then when Revaz tried to top roll Michael, Michael just looked at his face like this.
SPEAKER_01: and then there was did something that nobody expected round one after i saw the round one how michael was just holding and waiting i was like wow what a mismatch i said and then he did something different and that way like how how does he see this how does he explain but just remember everything correctly when you translate please yeah i will translate the incorrect order what you mentioned uh guess miss jamie there was really good
SPEAKER_00: So yeah, Revaz, his video may be disabled, but he's with us. So I will translate. Revaz,
SPEAKER_00: After the match between Genadi and Michael, you and Genadi started sparring. You were the only one who was able to beat Michael. After the sparring, Genadi was able to get out of the ring. You were the only one who was able to get out of the ring. You were the only one who was able to get out of the ring.
SPEAKER_00: Now I want to talk to you. What do you talk about? And I would like to say that if you, with all your hard work, and your hard work, were able to get Mike Lesinagde, Mike would be so proud of you that he wouldn't be able to do anything, and he wouldn't be able to do anything else. And I think that now, in the first round, Mike Lesinagde would say, wow, I didn't expect this to happen. But in the second round, he would get up and say,
SPEAKER_00: So I translated everything that you said. And so is your question about his political quality against Derek or? No, no, no, not quality. How does he say this?
SPEAKER_01: Genadi Toprols, Michael, Michael Toprols, Derek, and not Derek, sorry, Rewas, and then Rewas, Toprols, Genadi, you know, just like how does he see all this, you know. Okay, okay.
SPEAKER_00: Yes, there is a facet to it, that you are the father of Genadi, Genadi is the father of Michael, and Michael is also the father of you, and this is a very important thing, that you are the father of your people, that's what I would like to say. I would like to say that I am the father of my people.
SPEAKER_03: This is the first time I've been here and I'm very happy to be here. I'm very happy to be here and I'm very happy to be here. I'm very happy to be here and I'm very happy to be here.
SPEAKER_03: I don't know if I would be able to do it with Magida, but I don't know if I would be able to do it with her. I don't know if I would be able to do it with Magida, but I don't know if I would be able to do it with her.
SPEAKER_03: That's the way it is. And then there was a lot of pressure from the fans. I mean, the whole world was waiting for Mike, and the fans wanted to see what he was going to do, what he was going to do, what he was going to do, what he was going to do. And there was a lot of pressure.
SPEAKER_03: I don't want to say that I'm not a fan, but that's not my style and that's not my opinion. I don't want to say that I'm not a fan, but that's not my style and that's not my opinion. I don't want to say that I'm not a fan, but that's not my opinion.
SPEAKER_03: As I was saying, we had a meeting of 10-15 people, and we were talking about what we were going to do, what we were going to do. We were talking about what we were going to do, what we were going to do. We were talking about what we were going to do.
SPEAKER_03: When I was five or four years old, I didn't have a job. I didn't have a job, I didn't have a job. I worked three days a week, and I didn't have a job. I didn't have a job. I didn't have a job. I didn't have a job.
SPEAKER_03: Yes, you are right. But I would like to ask you one more question. You said that you would like to do something in the future. Are you planning to do something in the future? Yes, I am planning to do something in the future. I am planning to do something in the future. I am planning to do something in the future. I am planning to do something in the future.
SPEAKER_03: I would like to say that Mike is a very important person. He is a very important person. He is a very important person. He is very important. He is a very important person.
SPEAKER_03: Just only two seconds.
SPEAKER_01: guys derek has been holding his hands like this last 10 minutes and you guys are still asking if it's the real derek riding okay nothing more yeah all right
SPEAKER_00: uh first of all i will just briefly sum up what he said and then go in details and tell you everything so he's made a main point what he was answering to you was that he is still adapting to his vendetta matches and it was kind of new for him and he's also still trying to get in his good shape and eventually reach his optimal best shape that's he's in this in this transitional phase right now
SPEAKER_00: So keep that in mind and now I will start. So he started by saying that this was like after these years of his pulse, first of all, it was very hard for him to adapt and get back into the shape, especially when you have such a great top level opponent such as Michael. And he also underlined that Michael himself came to him, personally told him that the way Michael was prepared that day against him was his best shape.
SPEAKER_00: So it's also very noticeable that Michael was very, very tough opponent right there for him.
SPEAKER_00: The second point he made was that Vendetta style is very new for him. He has never been pulling on Vendetta. He's been pulling like tournaments. We all know. And he had like 15 minutes break each match. So it was quite new. And that was also the reason that he needed to adapt. And he lost his first round and we saw the match the way it was.
SPEAKER_00: Third point he also made was that he's slowly, slowly getting into his better shape. All this time he needed to prepare himself. And when you mentioned his pulling against Genadi, he said that it was basically because of the practice. So that practice was also after this Genadi's match. So he was kind of...
SPEAKER_00: better shape there and practices still practice maybe Genadi in real match could have uh shown different results so and about his top role then when I specifically asked about whether if he would have different outcome against Michael Todd if he pulled right now because all he was saying was that it was new for him this does and he made such a rocky mistakes
SPEAKER_00: yeah on that day and he said that he would for sure exploit those mistakes and would not do any more that he did against michael todd so basically first round would not be the same that we saw so now he said that he could he could even possibly go outside yeah because right now he's way better shape and he just keep progressing and going into his max and can you also ask him if he's shy of us why his camera is off
SPEAKER_00: I guess he's trying to turn it on. Maybe he's just because of internet. Sometimes I do this. I understand. I understand. Yeah. He's not home. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, so. And Derek.
SPEAKER_01: Honestly, with objective eyes, how do you see your chance against him? You give, like, of course you're going to go there and, you know, do your best and win. But do you see, like, something like 50-50 or 55-45 for you? Or how do you see this match? Don't tell me anything in Revaz's favor. I'm going to cancel that match. No, no, not that. Yeah. It's like...
SPEAKER_02: just if if the me that shows up uh the the mentally because i already know physically i'm the best shape i've ever been in yeah me that shows up against him shows up and that guy shows up the proper derrick shows up that i want the proper energy and the trip goes well um come on this is your responsibility don't be like you know if or something you're talking about yourself
SPEAKER_02: i'm just okay so when that happens when that happens yeah okay yeah that happens then i can't envision that version of myself losing to almost anyone like when i'm in that state i feel so strong and when i've been in that that spot i've never i haven't really seen my arm going too bad that direction like ever
SPEAKER_02: when I haven't actually there. So it's hard for me to imagine anything else happening, to be honest. So my whole soul goal in life is to make sure that guy shows up on stage. And that's everything I put myself into.
SPEAKER_02: um yeah that's why i said like even if it was physically the version of me that went against him or even the version the physically what i had that um went against morozov if i would have done everything correctly i i don't know what could have happened i really am interested if i what would have happened but it didn't and so this is my opportunity
SPEAKER_02: But I'm a lot stronger than people think, according to the Morozov. If you're basing anything on how strong I am based off the Morozov match, then that's awesome, because that means I have a lot to show you. Or not just you, but anybody, you know what I mean? So, yeah. But do you also believe that if Morozov was your opponent in August, the result could be different by going at least inside or something?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, there's no way it would be the same. No version of me would be the same. Plus, maybe I wouldn't get that round one, you know, mess up with the referees where they said, ready, go fast. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I started the match by getting flashed. I was waiting for a ready go that didn't happen. But, yeah, I...
SPEAKER_02: I just, I it's most people that don't follow me like really closely. Uh, that's all they have to go off of is the me versus Morozov match. That's the only thing they've seen. So, uh, that's all they've seen. Then I guess, um, I have a real opportunity here to show them something else. Yeah. And did you ask him if he's child? Kyle Ross.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, I don't know what that is, but he's asking if he's shy, if he's being shy. I heard. Yeah. Yeah. Why can't we not see him? Then I told him 220 people are here.
SPEAKER_00: to watch revas there's there is no direct fan in the world i understand because i'm prettier than him that's why he's not here even derek is a river's fan right now right now just a joke
SPEAKER_01: Just tell him that on the chat room, everyone is saying that it is kind of like they're offended. OK, now let's go a little bit predictions before we close.
SPEAKER_00: Revaz, what do you think about John Burzing and Ongarbaev? John Burzing said Ongarbaev is the last picker. I don't know much of his prediction. Ongarbaev is the last picker. He said Ongarbaev would win and then ask his call. Ongarbaev would win 3-0.
SPEAKER_01: oh he's gonna win that one will beat john he says and and he knows that i never ever go against john brazil so uh predict john i mean if the match was set between leon and john knowing john's the underdog i would still hold the job i'll hold the job okay so your your your your your uh prediction is
SPEAKER_02: based on who you support then well with john matches with john matches yes people always ask me should i should i bet on john i go that's i mean you know career-wise that's always the safe bet that has shown to always be the same bet to bet on john bruce yeah yeah yeah yeah and except against the wonderland just and ask there was there was not touch things and uh they're gonna put it in
SPEAKER_01: yes sir yeah and like what does he think about tatashi's shape after like I mean he saw him against directly
SPEAKER_03: How did you find Irakli's form? How did you find Irakli's form? Irakli has always been in great shape.
SPEAKER_03: It was clear that if Iraqis were to do what they were doing and how they wanted to do it, it would be very difficult for Iraqis. But it didn't happen.
SPEAKER_00: he's saying that uh todd is unique we all know his bicep strength is like uh in that position with side pressure is like unmatched and obviously it was a huge reason why uh match ended like that but also after match ended he was like iraq between me is my uh little brother and uh he was very angry at him like mad at him and he was saying that how could you lose like that
SPEAKER_00: And because he said that Irakli did not look himself, like did not look like Irakli action on that day. It was as if he was out of his mindset because he couldn't execute the way he pulls. And then he also said that the way I know how Irakli pulls normally and how good he is in the angles that he is, he was surprised to see that Irakli was not able to do
SPEAKER_01: yeah maybe but maybe maybe maybe todd made him look like that his power yeah exactly how do you see this
SPEAKER_02: Um, I mean, I think Todd Hutchings has been doing amazing recently. He was a buddy of mine. Uh, I, I feel that, um, Prudnik is a little too complete. I think he has too much power in too many certain areas. Uh, I think he, which gives him a lot of answers to a lot of problems. I think Todd Hutchings gives a very unique problem with his style of arm wrestling, but I think Prudnik with his speed, with his hand and, uh, with his hook as well, I think he'll be too much, um,
SPEAKER_02: 3-1, and I think the one happens if Prudnik lets Todd get a little too comfortable, too good of a spot, and then maybe you can't get him out of there. But I think the rest of it, too fast. I think Prudnik will be too fast. 3-1, 3-1 Prudnik. I understand. And can you ask him also, I think he already said that Genadi is going to beat Jerry, right? Genadi is the Jerry Zeracito. He won't move if so, Genadi won't.
SPEAKER_00: Yes, yes, Genadi should win. Yes, Genadi should win. 3-0, Genadi would win, that's what I'm guessing. But does he expect a war? Does he expect dominance? He could expect dominance or he could expect a draw, but Genadi should win.
SPEAKER_03: In my opinion, Genadi was the dominant because he had been in the national team for three years, he had never been eliminated, he had never been eliminated in the national team. Genadi is a player who is in a good shape and I think he will be able to do well in my opinion.
SPEAKER_00: He remarked that Jerry has had this long pause and to come back, we have no idea how good or how not that good shape he would be. And considering how Genadi is raising and getting back and like even getting stronger than he ever has been, he thinks that it would be dominant match from Genadi. Yeah. So especially considering Jerry has not pulled so far long. Yeah. And
SPEAKER_03: How about he versus Derek Smith? No, Revaz versus Derek Smith. Obviously, I'm coming for a win.
SPEAKER_00: but usually i don't like to speak of myself so we will see what's going to happen on that day on the match i understand and and and you derek jerry versus kennedy
SPEAKER_02: um i'm gnadi is one of my favorite armors of all time to watch always has been um i'm really interested to see what version of jerry comes back um when people keep writing off jerry um i don't understand jerry has a pretty specific style but jerry's been in the game so long and he knows what he's getting himself into jerry wouldn't be getting into this if he wasn't ready
SPEAKER_02: Like he knows what ready is. I mean, he's been doing it how many years? So I'm interested if Jerry feels like he's ready to be on this stage against someone this level. I'm really just interested to see what that means in Jerry's head because he knows what he's doing. He's been there. So I would be really shocked if Jerry showed up and wasn't in some kind of amazing, amazing shape.
SPEAKER_02: That being said, I do think that Genadi's still too versatile. I do think Genadi will win 3-0. But, man, I just, I'm really interested to see what Jerry shows up. Because it's just, Jerry's a big question mark right now because he hasn't been arm wrestling so much. So I think you have to go with Genadi until we see what Jerry's, how he's doing. And that was Dave Chaffee and Artem Morozov. David Artem. Oh, man, dude.
SPEAKER_03: He expects quite a tough match, but still would say 3-1 or 3-2, Dave would take the win. Who's going to win? Dave. Dave. Oh, Dave is going to win.
SPEAKER_00: okay finally finally he said one american is gonna win i knew you were looking for it i knew you were excited yeah i i was just wondering you know if there was this thinking that you know i will translate he's asking what you said so um he said that um
SPEAKER_03: I don't care if it's America, Georgia, Ukraine, the Soviet Union, Azerbaijan, I don't care. I don't care what they say, I don't care what they say, I don't care what they say, I don't care.
SPEAKER_00: He keeps saying that he's trying to be realistic and he's not considering the countries like Armenia or Georgia or USA or Canada or something like that. He's just trying to... He didn't say that. He said Ukraine and Azerbaijan. He said, okay, whatever, continue. He also said Armenia, yeah. Okay, but Azerbaijan and Ukraine too. Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: I'm telling you, you know secretly Georgian. I don't know what I'm doing here. No, everyone knows those names. Continue. Just kidding. Yeah, so he said that it was his realistic idea. But Roman, what would you do if you were a Georgian and you knew that all Georgians can speak Georgian?
SPEAKER_00: obviously he's with his blood and flesh he's true georgian and he wishes all georgians to win but it's not like what he wants it's like uh what would happen and what will most likely happen so he's trying to still be realistic even though hoping to georgians to win all the time but obviously i'm cheering for all americans just put that out there obviously yeah yeah yeah and and derek you dave cheffy morozov you pull with morozov and you were about to pull dave cheffy
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I feel what I'm worried about is that Morozov, although I think he has options, I've seen him post go out, but usually he doesn't just get to the straps and right-handed and then goes back into a hook. I feel I'm worried that Morozov is going to go right into Dave's favorite spot.
SPEAKER_01: I'm worried that more as I was going to crash into that hook. Dave will catch him right about here and then be right in Dave's spot to go sideways. Dave has been has been injured in her elbow or something. He hasn't been pulling hook. Sometimes I see him even avoiding touching his hook. If he is back there, he is probably.
SPEAKER_02: you know as strong as dennis blanco there but yeah i'm gonna assume dave's 100 i'm i'm just gonna assume normal normal people doing their normal thing i'm not i won't count for injury right now because i don't know the status of that uh so if he does go into dave's spot i feel like dave's gonna be too much um i feel maybe with his speed he gets one match off three one but uh three one or three zero dave i i think oh you you pull with morozo and you're saying dave is gonna beat him three zero
SPEAKER_02: three zero or three one yeah okay so so are you happy that you didn't pull dave then well i said to everybody i mean i was going for a match with dave but i said but if i get destroyed by morozov i'm going to stop going after dave because i feel i didn't feel like dave was they were at the same level so once i lost the wars off i said okay i'm backing off dave chafee uh until i feel like i'm ready again so i gotta i gotta beat ravaz and then i'll go after dave again i'm not saying that that's not official i'm just saying roman roman translates
SPEAKER_01: Derek said he's going to be Dreyvaas and after that, don't tell me not to say. You need to back this up. I know you didn't say that, but you mentioned it in a different way. I bring it to this rate and you need to back me. He said he's going to be Dreyvaas and then he will be the one who's going to pull Dave.
SPEAKER_00: Good luck. Any question?
SPEAKER_01: last time we had interview with him with rewas he said it was once leon's dream to beat rewas and now he said that after that he said that now it is his dream to beat leon does he still run after the dream potentially i believe that that guy has never been like at his best in his life
SPEAKER_01: If he's ever in this shape, then I would think that he would really have that potential. What does he think? First, ask him if he remembers what he told me. Yeah. Okay.
SPEAKER_00: You want to get out of it, you know, when you say that your job is a machine, and then you tell Prazha that you are very close to him, that is, you are very close to him, that is, you are very close to him, that is, you are very close to him, that is, you are very close to him.
SPEAKER_00: He doesn't remember saying anything like that. I have the, on YouTube, he said that it was,
SPEAKER_00: levan's dream to beat him and now he said that it is now his dream to beat levan i think i was the guy who translated so i don't want him to be in trouble so i think i was there uh i'm not sure but i think i was so uh i will translate what you said uh
SPEAKER_00: But what I wanted to say is that you said that it wasn't Levan's fault, it was your fault, and now Levan is the number one, and now it's Piri's fault. And your intention is that the number one will win and Levan will lose. If you know that, don't worry, I don't know what you're going to say. It's your fault, Tore, it's your fault, there's nothing to it. If you were to say that it was Levan's fault, I wouldn't say anything. There's nothing to your fault.
SPEAKER_03: So, he's...
SPEAKER_00: okay so he's saying that uh he may have said that but uh what he actually meant was not the word dream but as a word as a goal so he said that once upon a time he used to beat levan so it was yeah it's not about dream he's not a dreamer guy you know that's what he was kind of i mean that's basically what i meant to say yeah but does he still have the code so you know
SPEAKER_03: Do you think your career will be the same as your father's career? There is no concrete answer to this question. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so.
SPEAKER_00: so he's saying that right now he doesn't have anyone specific in in his target list but he wants to prove himself that he's getting in better shape and he's able to beat anyone who would be thrown at him so he's focused his aim and his goal is to get in the best shape possible for him
SPEAKER_00: so that he would be ultimately winning against anyone you would or anyone else would throw at him. And he also at the end said that no matter if it's a female or male, he just wants to beat everyone. So his goal is to be the best shape ever. No specific targets. And Derek, what do you think about Kody and Morozov with left arm? That's really interesting to me.
SPEAKER_02: Kody doesn't even get slowed down over here recently. I mean, lefty. I feel like he's almost out of challengers in the United States. So I'm really interested to see how his left arm holds up over there. I know Morozov is an amazing lefty. I know he poses some real threats. He's also a lot faster than Kody.
SPEAKER_02: But just horsepower-wise, I'm interested to see just who's stronger, even in a slow pull between them. Because I can't touch Kody, and nobody can really touch Kody left-handed out here recently. So, yeah, I'm really interested to see that. I can't even predict it. I have no idea. I mean, every part of me wants to say Kody's going to destroy Wynn, but I have no idea how to compare because no one can touch Kody over here. So I have no idea.
SPEAKER_00: I have no idea. I'm cheering for Kody 100%, he's my buddy, but yeah. So I'll say Kody 3-0. Can you ask him if he knows Kody? Kody Mereti.
SPEAKER_00: Was he the one who won the Worlds in Romania 2019? Reef, against Reef.
SPEAKER_01: I think Arif ended up winning the gold. I don't want to mention, but yes. He also said that Arif won him, but at the specific match, he also beat him. In the specific match, Kody won. Yes, he knows that. Some months later, it was decided that Arif won. That's it.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, that's the guy, yeah. And you want me to ask about his prediction on this match? Yeah, with Morozov, yeah. He thinks probably 3-0 would be for Morozov to win.
SPEAKER_01: I understand. And what do you think about Krasimir versus Irakli? Krasimir versus Irakli. Irakli. Obviously Irakli. Krasimir is not the only one.
SPEAKER_03: He is a very good sportsman. He is very professional. He is a very good sportsman. He is a very good sportsman. He is a very good sportsman. He is a very good sportsman. He is a very good sportsman. He is a very good sportsman. He is a very good sportsman. He is a very good sportsman. He is a very good sportsman. He is a very good sportsman. He is a very good sportsman. He is a very good sportsman. He is a very good sportsman. He is a very good sportsman. He is a very good sportsman. He is a very good sportsman. He is a very good sportsman. He is a very good sportsman. He is a very good sportsman. He is a very good sportsman. He is a very good sportsman. He is a very good sportsman. He is a very good sportsman. He is a very good sportsman. He is a very good sportsman. He is a very good sportsman. He is a
SPEAKER_03: So he's saying that he's cheering for Irakli and he also believes that Irakli would beat him 3-0.
SPEAKER_00: And then he was also saying, considering the current form of Krasimir. He started by saying that Krasimir is his good friend. They are quite close friends and a good relationship with him. But recently, somehow he also kind of was rhetorically asking this question. We see him not in good shape lately. Or maybe it's because of his opponents. That's what he said. Yeah, his opponents were like much bigger than him, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: yeah so considering all that he's saying that iraqi would beat him but now it's like krasimir's weight category so we don't know i don't know but he's still saying ricky walker says thank you for your project keep it up derek yeah sports yeah and how do you see that much krasimir in iraqi derek um
SPEAKER_02: Exactly kind of what you guys mentioned with Krasimir, he's been facing huge opponents outside his weight class and it hasn't been going well. That being said,
SPEAKER_02: it at least gives us a question mark on where Krasimir is. That doesn't mean he's weak, but I'm saying at least makes us wonder, like, where is he? We don't know because he keeps facing huge opponents. So because his strength level currently is more of a question mark, and I feel like Rock Lee is top form he's ever been in. Like, this kid is amazing. I have to go with Rock Lee until I get more information on the current Krasimir. You know, it's just too big of a question mark for me. So, yeah, I'd have to predict Rock Lee 3-1.
SPEAKER_01: Okay. And can you ask Revaz what does he think about Egle and Gabriela? I'm sure he knows both of them very well. Revaz, what do you think about Egle and Gabriela? What do you think? Gabriela is Brazilian, right? Yes.
SPEAKER_03: These two are great, this one is also great, and I think Gabriela will be the first one to come. For me, it's a big deal. I don't know if I'll be able to do it, but I think I'll be able to do it. I don't know if I'll be able to do it, but I think I'll do it.
SPEAKER_00: The two of them are in the same team. Yes, but they are both in the same team. Now I'm asking that they have their match on both hands, so to make sure. They are both in the same team. Do you think you can beat them? Gabriela. No, I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so.
SPEAKER_00: so he's saying that it's uh not that much clear for him but he would still go get give the slight edge to gabriella uh for both uh both hands but he's especially on the left one he is not the chua so it's it's not very clear for her i understand yeah and and and i want to ask derek uh corey miller what is his chance against daniel prokopchuk
SPEAKER_02: this is this is an exciting match for me because we don't normally see a lot of lightweights from the united states go over there um and compete lighter guys so i'm excited for uh someone to get uh corey to get the chance to debut his strength now last time we saw we saw him go against janice um corey go against janice and how does janice do with daniel do you think again i don't think they ever met you don't think they ever met yeah but it would be a good match it would be a good match
SPEAKER_02: Well, he gave Giannis ended up winning, but Corey, I think, got the first round pin on him, kind of like a flash. Then Giannis slowed it down, and then Giannis had control after that. But to me, at least it means that Corey's in the ballpark. He's somewhere in the conversation. I know Giannis controlled it after that, but you can still get that first round pin. That means something. So...
SPEAKER_02: I think Daniel Prokopchik is amazing, especially when he gets in that hook and he gets tight and gets a hold of somebody. It'll be all on the ready go. I think if either one of them gets what they want, what they're looking for at the beginning, I don't think the other person can stop the other person. You know what I mean? So if Corey gets hand position, I think he wins 3-0. If Daniel gets his cup in, I think he wins 3-0.
SPEAKER_01: But I'll have to go with international competition favoring Daniel because he's been on the big stage more. Uh, so I'll go with Daniel, but I'm really excited to see this, uh, see what Corey can do for sure. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that, that's how, how you will get better. You know, we need to really pull at the international level and then that is, that is why, you know, the pullers from east, you know, at the world's championship, European champion, they all the time, pull each other, different countries.
SPEAKER_01: And that's the competition that makes people tougher, you know? Okay. And so I want to go a little bit quicker. Can you ask Revaz what does he think about Raimonds Lempens versus Ryan Bowen? No problem. Revaz, let's talk about Raimonds's coach, Ray Z, and Raimonds's boss, Marjorie Nakhelze.
SPEAKER_00: No, he doesn't recognize those names and I just tried to explain.
SPEAKER_00: I asked him a different name, then a different name, yeah. Yeah. I told him all the names, like Coach Ray, Raimonds Lippins. Does he know Chance Shaw? Does he know Chance Shaw?
SPEAKER_01: He doesn't recognize them. I'm trying to explain who they are. Yeah, Chen's show had a match with John Brzenk, and he had a match with tough match with even with the glasses and the smile.
SPEAKER_00: You know, all the time. Now he knows. Now he got the idea. Yeah, with Zurab. Obviously, Zurab would be...
SPEAKER_01: why are you asking there's a big weight difference though there's a really big weight difference right uh yeah probably probably now he's about 275 or something you know and so about 50 55 pounds yeah difference
SPEAKER_00: He still thinks that Rob's going to win? That easy? Yeah, I will translate it. I was about to.
SPEAKER_00: He thinks that Zurab still would win. He's really warrior spirit and he will figure out some type of, you know, eventually to win. Can you ask your boss how much he weighs right now? 141 or 142 kg, somewhere like that. So he's actually a little bit lighter than last time.
SPEAKER_00: I think he had a lot of experience in the past. Yeah, you're right. Yeah, so roughly two kg lighter this time. He was 144 last time. So probably he lost more fat, huh?
SPEAKER_00: oh yes he keeps training so yeah most likely he wouldn't he would not lose his muscle mass he keeps training so yeah you've got the point there thank you yeah yeah i understand and how do you see ryan versus ray derek i'm really excited about this match because i can't i thought you were gonna say that you don't know them
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, who? I don't, I mean...
SPEAKER_02: i gotta i gotta think ryan's the favorite right because he's he's the bigger guy and uh but ray ray has way more more like international experience than ryan does i gotta think ryan's the favorite though but i i don't it's just a really funny match i'm really excited to see who wins because there's gonna be so much talking afterwards and uh i'm i'm really excited match i i guess i'll go with ryan i have no idea how this goes i'm going with ryan i'm gonna go with ryan just on a prediction
SPEAKER_01: Just tell Revaz that those two guys that he did not remember are two of the most famous YouTubers and arm wrestlers as well on social media. And they will be doing commentary. So they will not talk good about him after what they hear now. Okay. Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Reo, you have a very interesting story to tell. There are two people whom I would like to talk about. One is Raimonds Sleipnitz, and the other one is Armwrestler YouTubers. There are a lot of YouTubers, and there are a lot of comments from them, and the commentators say that they are very happy to see you. They are very happy to see you, and they are very happy.
SPEAKER_00: Don't tell him that I'm joking. Yes, yes. So he eventually remembered to Lithuanian guy, this Lipincis, called Ray.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, he eventually remembered after my warning, right? Yeah. Tell Revaz, I'll be commentating too. And if he beats me, I won't have any nice words for him either. So can I wait? Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: guys as long as it is clean you know in friendship you know i mean it's good to steal the pot you know it's good little bit you know i respect you i respect you yes respect with respect but there needs to be a little bit like personal competition in a good way you know not that bad way but um and how do you think there was thing that that's you know bojidas
SPEAKER_00: he's really good too he's really good what does he think he 85 kilo match he and he versus uh
SPEAKER_00: Okay, I didn't know that. So he's saying that he and Bozo were traveling from Moldova to Bulgaria with the car and all the time they were in this time of the way, they were speaking of armistice. So he clearly knows who he is. And so now I will ask about the match. Okay.
SPEAKER_03: in the 45-kilogram category, and the store is very interesting. There are two very interesting situations. In Samushia, the store is very interesting. There are two very interesting situations. There are two very interesting situations. There are two very interesting situations.
SPEAKER_03: Of course, I don't think it's a bad thing to do this, because you don't have to wait four or five years to do it. I don't think it's a bad thing to do this. I think it's a good thing to do this, because you don't have to wait four or five years to do it. I think it's a good thing to do this, because you don't have to wait four or five years to do it.
SPEAKER_00: okay he's saying that he tried to uh explain uh why some Shaw lost his idea is that uh it was the same as his own loss I mean I mean his own performance he obviously did not lose uh he said that uh Samushia has also had this pause like many years pause yeah not competing and also this
SPEAKER_00: super match style was also new for him so he took took a while to adapt like to realize where he was what he was doing and in this process he eventually lost this uh three two like this match so now he thinks that he would be prepared way better he would be more prepared for these styles and these type of farmers thing with these rules and he will win three zero he said not too easy yeah yeah also there was some some weight difference between
SPEAKER_02: Him and his previous opponent, Paul, yeah. And yeah, and I want to ask you, Derek, Sandris and Lachlan. Oh man, that's kind of exciting. You know what, Sandris always says that I'm going to lose every match, so I'm going to go with Lachlan. No, I do think Lachlan looks amazing. And he came out here recently in the United States and had some more matches.
SPEAKER_02: I feel like super strong against Austin Jaggers. He's one of our top up and coming like super heavyweights out here. So I think, I think Lachlan, I think Lachlan takes it. I think it's a really good match because I think both those guys have some options. They will go in some different directions. So I'm interested to see that could look a lot of different ways. And I think that the winner is barely the winner, but I'll go with Lachlan on it. Maybe three, two. Yeah. And, and Revaz.
SPEAKER_00: I will tell him the category is 102, right, KG? Yeah, 102, yeah. So David is moving 10 kilo. 10 kilo, OK.
SPEAKER_03: Yes, it's been a long time since the last game against Lami. But there are some downsides for me. I think that Dadikyan is a very strong player. I think he's a very strong player. And he's a great player. I think he's going to win this game against Dadikyan.
SPEAKER_03: I started to think that I would be able to do it. If I had to go back and do it again, I wouldn't be able to do it. Do you think you will be able to do it? I think I will be able to do it. There is only one summit, and it will start at the end of the summit. That's why I think I will be able to do it in this form.
SPEAKER_00: okay so he he underlined the uh the david is really good shape right now he follows his uh progress like he's the way he's arm wrestling and he said that explosivity would be the uh key for david to win means this but yeah start
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, he said start, yes. Because he's very fast and maybe would be even too fast for Oleg. But if Oleg manages to stop the battle, then he's really unclear right now who would win. So then I asked about the score and he said either 3-0 or 3-1 for David to win. Okay, he said that David is going to win. Yeah. I understand, I understand. So I think we covered everything and
SPEAKER_01: There is one more match, Yusuf and Yardolat Sarybay. But even you may know Yusuf, you may not know Yardolat Sarybay from Kazakhstan. He was third after Yusuf, but they didn't meet each other. They both go inside. I'm expecting a good match, 72 kilo weight limit. Let's see how that match will be. Yeah. And Derek, you want to add anything? You want to add anything? How you...
SPEAKER_02: I just want to make sure that Rivas is ready because when I'm feeling good like this, that's when I start Kings moving. So let him know that I'll be dropping him to the table. My head is going to disappear. Tell me how he's ready. And Derek, his move this time will not work, right? No, this time it will work. My arm is so long, it reaches to the heavens too far away. Okay.
SPEAKER_00: I will translate. I will translate.
SPEAKER_00: probably good luck he would say i don't know he keeps saying he he's pushing on that surprise so derek be ready for the surprise okay i'm curious about something before he pulled michael
SPEAKER_00: Was he prepared to do that deadless shoulder press, or he just had to do it? David he think that he would have to do that? Can you tell us something specific about this? David Mike, or the audience, or Khelso, tell you about this scenario, that the deadless shoulder press was going to happen, or how it was going to happen? Or did you think at that moment that it was going to happen, or did you think it was going to happen?
SPEAKER_00: I don't know. How is it? I don't know. I don't know.
SPEAKER_00: To be honest, I think he's quite not happy with the refereeing on his specific match because he said that he not only has to beat Michael, but also had to beat referees. So I guess he's not so happy with the setup.
SPEAKER_01: so that he said that that was the only way that he could beat both referees i understand but that's not what i am asking i am asking did he expect to pull or need to pull that way before the match was was it any part of his plan like like did he think that there was like a possibility that he had to pull in that way before the match was he expecting such thing or not and yes i mean
SPEAKER_01: mean just i will tell you something that you know when they both go outside i mean michael was i mean i need to say that you know that michael was better with his top role he took his wrist he may be not happy about michael's you know shoulder but does he think that his shoulder may have also passed the center as well because because he complains about that
SPEAKER_01: And then Michael's fans also complained that Revaz's shoulder passed the center. So I was watching from far back, not really side. So I didn't see the shoulder thing. Yeah, but what does he think about it? Does he think that there was also a little bit problem with his shoulder as well?
SPEAKER_00: OK, but for your first question, I already asked him, was he expecting and getting ready for that type of move to be done? But then he said that he figured it out on the table during the pool. Oh, OK, OK, OK. But now I will ask about the second question.
SPEAKER_00: I'm from Shuri, and I'm from Gwerdi. I live in the center of Tlatu, as you would imagine. And I think that if the press were to come out and say, you're a thief, you're not a thief, you're not a thief, you're not a thief, you're not a thief, you're not a thief, you're not a thief, you're not a thief, you're not a thief, you're not a thief, you're not a thief, you're not a thief, you're not a thief, you're not a thief, you're not a thief, you're not a thief, you're not a thief, you're not a thief, you're not a thief, you're not a thief, you're not a thief, you're not a thief, you're not a thief, you're not a thief,
SPEAKER_01: What was was shoulder, the back in the center. Yeah. You think that as well, you know, because I am, I'm the organizer and Michael was like, Michael's fans were complaining about his shoulders. And I know he was complaining about, about Michael's arm. I saw Michael's arm during the match. In my opinion, he was, he was down angled some point.
SPEAKER_01: But because I was back there, I couldn't see from the side way. Does he think that his shoulder also passed the center or not?
SPEAKER_00: Yes. I'm asking in an honest way. We are all friends, just talking about it. I will make sure that he understands you correctly, no problem.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe because I was afraid, I was afraid of Michael, and I thought he was going to beat me up. I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to do anything about it, and I could do something about it. I was very interested in the fact that if you think about it, you will find yourself in the center. You don't know what you're going to do about it, but you're interested.
SPEAKER_03: I don't know, I don't know what to say about the details. I don't know what to say about the details. I don't know what to say about the details. I don't know what to say about the details. I don't know what to say about the details.
SPEAKER_03: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
SPEAKER_03: That's what I was doing. I didn't have any emotions. I just wanted to go out and have fun. That's what I wanted. I didn't want to go out and have fun. I just wanted to go out and have fun. That's what I wanted.
SPEAKER_00: uh he said he started by saying that um he may have at some point crossed the line his shoulder of this center line but the only case would be that michael's elbow was way off the pad so there was no other way to pin him so eventually it would only be the case if michael's elbow was so out of the pad
SPEAKER_00: So technically, even if somebody would chase him off saying that your shoulder crossed the center line, still because the Michael's elbow was already way off the padlock and he also made the sign of the fingers. And then also he said that
SPEAKER_00: if those referees would be the same uh like uh same approach or same issues uh then he will know he will be like his uh his mind would be like prepared for it because he uh was not ready for uh paul michael like that because uh reba said that
SPEAKER_00: previous one day previous of the match event they spoke of the rules or something like this and they they knew that Michael the way Michael pulled eventually would not be allowed and he he was kind of also unprepared in that scenario but eventually for um he's glad that he end up victorious so he's that's his general idea why he's not okay uh with that type of why is he somewhat unhappy of that uh uh ref side of the
SPEAKER_01: uh of that match yeah go ahead yeah and then he he also kind of joked that he would bring some glasses for referees for next time to watch it more carefully you know and yeah listen listen listen i mean yeah referees can make mistakes this and that but when he said he's gonna bring glasses to referees it is also uh there was there was a joke there was okay okay because because they are the east versus west referees um
SPEAKER_01: I will do our best to have fair matches for everyone. Referees will be respectful to the athletes. Athletes will be respectful to the referees. And nobody will curse, except one guy has the exception. We all know. Matt Mask, you know. Yeah, exactly.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, I will briefly translate. Let me. Yeah, okay.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, even Matt Metz cannot disrespect referees or anyone else, even opponents.
SPEAKER_01: that this guy is just like a personality that talks with the effort all the time if you want to stop him saying that either you need to tape his mouth or i just ask him in a friendly way can you at least like minimize it he said he will do his best and that's fine matt mask is a great guy you know not a bad guy and ricky walker again says that direct keep it up you know he's the guy likes you and he likes to uh support you so like sorry if he wants to say something
SPEAKER_03: Yes, that's right. I think it's a good question. I think it's a good question, and it's a good question. It's a good question.
SPEAKER_03: There is no such thing as a human being who doesn't know what to do. If you don't like me, I won't let you go. And if you don't like me, I won't let you go either. I'll let you go for the rest of your life. If you don't like me, I won't let you go. If you don't like me, I'll let you go.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, he's saying that obviously he respects you and he knows your relationship with him and he directly said about your relationship with Revaz and he knows that you are very fair guy like trying to be the fair set up the fair matches as fair as possible and you are he understands that also referees are sometimes could possibly make the mistakes we all human
SPEAKER_00: But then he started to kind of joke around about why would they only make those mistakes about him, not about Michael. So all those mistakes were somehow reflecting bad on him, not on Michael. I mean, maybe they misunderstood.
SPEAKER_01: my expression on the rule meeting, anything, we will make everything more clear about it. Yeah, I mean, tell Revaz that I respect him as an arm master. I also respect him as a human being. We are from the same area of the world. We understand each other very well. And, you know, I'm just doing my best to bring the arm-nesting world together. In fact, as I said many times, it's not East versus West. It is
SPEAKER_01: like East and West being together, I'm trying to unite. Of course, to hype the event, you know, if I bring here two Americans pulling each other and like all the time like this and that, you know, it's not, we need some type of competition as well. That's why it's East versus West. Other than that, Derek is my friend. Chance is my friend. Rambet is legendary. Tata is incredible puller.
SPEAKER_01: john berzink matt oh great guys you know this guy how can i like michael many years of my friend people think that i have problem with michael only yesterday or two days ago i wrote michael from whatsapp michael you know right you know my door is wide open for you just tell me any opponents any match anytime you know it's ready and he also thanked me for considering him he said he has different plans on the similar same days you understand so i mean everything is okay you know of course that
SPEAKER_01: Sometimes you know something happened, we get upset, you know, I was upset about the referees trust me, Michael is upset about the referees same you know because he thought that the last round was the pin and referee gave foul but elbow.
SPEAKER_01: went down you know after the pin with the slow motion but you know sometimes you catch something with slow motion but we did like bear eyes you and say it's not that easy though don't tell rewards about this one uh because it's gonna start another argument about the last round and you know no need you know both are great pillars and and and um i will just tell him how how much you are i respect him yeah
SPEAKER_00: Well, I would like to say that I agree with what you said, I don't know if it's true or not, but I would like to say that I would like to say that I agree with what you said, and I'm very grateful to you, as well as to Claude Gidele, and to all the other Claude Gidele's, to Michael, to Matt Mask, to Ron Bethe, and to all the people who participated in these events, I absolutely agree with everything.
SPEAKER_01: um i think we lost him but maybe i hope we can close it that is already i worked i worked up until like three hours ago i know i know i'm sorry my friend but just to have you guys here is great and then that match between derek and michael had some you know uh
SPEAKER_01: know arguments after the match so that is why we had to talk and i i think thank you very very much derek if you want to add anything more uh you can just say if there is something that you thought but you didn't have chance to say
SPEAKER_02: No, I was going to ask Revaz. You said to me when we were first talking about maybe doing this match, you mentioned me, and I don't know if it was misinterpreted. You said something about Revaz mentioned my name. I was going to ask him if that's true, if that's true, why he mentioned my name in terms of asking for a match or who to arm wrestle. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. My memory is not that good, but that's possible. Yes, I think that's possible.
SPEAKER_01: um like whenever i i was we were trying to find an opponent for revas there was mentioned derek's name and what's your question about that just just i mean how or why why why my name pop up i mean all he had seen is me get destroyed by morozov so
SPEAKER_00: You know, why money? That's all he's saying. Yeah, I will ask him.
SPEAKER_00: Yes, I agree with you. It's not easy to say that you can do it, and it's not easy to say that I can do it, because I know that you can do it.
SPEAKER_00: Well, I don't know what to say. Well, what I'm interested in is that when you say that your son is dead, and you tell other people that he is dead, does that make any sense to you? Yes, I think so. That's what I'm trying to say.
SPEAKER_00: He thinks that it would be a really good match as a battle. And then he also lastly added that you can do better than he performed against Morozov. He knows that. He thought that. He was unprepared. It was not your best shape. So it was kind of testing around. And also he believes it will be a good match.
SPEAKER_02: yeah yeah somebody said thank you for the opportunity i really do appreciate it i mean uh like i had a bad showing i appreciate the anger giving me the opportunity and ravaz accepting the match i appreciate it a ton i mean this means the world to me so thank you yeah
SPEAKER_00: After we had the last interview with him, we had East versus West in May and then King of the Cable in June.
SPEAKER_00: What does Revaz think currently top five in the world? Revaz, your top five is now in the list. I think it's in the top five. Is it in the top five? No, no, it's in the top five. No, it's not in the top five.
SPEAKER_03: It's not always like that. It's not always like that. It's not always like that. It's not always like that. It's not always like that. It's not always like that. It's not always like that. It's not always like that.
SPEAKER_00: uh okay he's saying that uh it's kind of tough to declare uh top five right now because of this uh lack of armwrestling events we have for example he mentioned sly vitale and trubin from russia they cannot perform they cannot they can be in top five but he cannot say their names right now
SPEAKER_00: nor he can say who are clearly top five right now from the rest who can armistice because of this event. Some of them are missing at King of the Table, some of them are missing at here, East versus West, or somewhere else as well. So he just wanted to hold himself back on that one and not declaring any top five because he's not sure. Okay. I mean, as of now, he doesn't have any guess in his mind? Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Tell him not to be shy. He's not shy at all.
SPEAKER_03: This is a very important question, and I would like to add something to it.
SPEAKER_00: Okay. So he doesn't want to say this top five list without deeply thinking about it because he relates to this question as one of the most important ones. So he needs to take his time and think about it. So just to briefly overly say it like that, it would be kind of not legit answer and also would be most likely not the one he wants actually to say. So he needs really to take his time and
SPEAKER_00: So, he's not even sure about number one. He's not even sure about number one. He's not even sure about number one. He's not even sure about number one. He's not even sure about number one. He's not even sure about number one. He's not even sure about number one.
SPEAKER_01: commentator he's saying that who is the one the commentary he just wants to remember this raymond sorry uh someone that that should be the number one this commentary guy he said he said he said rainbows or what he just said rainbows number one no no raymonds raymonds no raymonds will be doing the the interview after the match this is the ryan will be doing the ryan and derek oh he's talking about you derek oh
SPEAKER_03: Maybe, maybe, I don't know. You will do the interview. I mean, no, no, interview, the commenting. Oh, yeah, yeah. He's joking, obviously. He's joking with everybody else on this list, not only about you. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Obviously, Levan is number one as of today's date.
SPEAKER_03: You know what it's like, when I first came to Klauči, when I saw your videos, I thought that all of you, the viewers, were in the same place, that's how it was, that's how it was, all of you, the viewers, were there, that's how it was.
SPEAKER_03: That's a game.
SPEAKER_03: I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know,
SPEAKER_00: yeah those guys yeah okay um so he's saying that uh about this uh obviously commentary uh number one obviously that was the joke he said ryan boven is number one he said raymond not ryan but okay whatever is number one that's right
SPEAKER_00: yeah that was his his guest who is this latvian commentary guy okay okay so yeah and after after after uh coach jay i guess there is the one number two and he he also wanted to say that uh as of today uh he um declares that these super heavyweight people are in the best shape as of as a history of armresting
SPEAKER_00: and he is very thankful that you and and also king of the table is uh setting up those matches it gives us opportunity to see who is uh how good and against who and so far and so on and also he wishes that those uh unfortunate political um
SPEAKER_00: situation was gone and also this great great super heavyweight Russian arm wrestlers take part of of this action you know we have here so and he also wishes to have as much as possible so many good matches you know so that it will be more entertaining and arm wrestling has best ears right now and you're one of the reason for it as an organizer and he he said this yeah oh okay thank you thank you thank you
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, this is what I try to do. I try to promote this event so we can see, you know, who is where, you know, like, and I see that Rewas is serious about arm wrestling and tell him that, you know, he will have opportunities, you know, like,
SPEAKER_01: All I want is him to do his best and take it seriously. That's all I want him to do. As long as he does that, my door will be open for him.
SPEAKER_00: He says, huge thanks to him. Yeah, thank you as well. Derek, who are the top five? The Vaughn? Yeah. Number one. Not Ray? Not Ray? Huh?
SPEAKER_01: Not Ray? Not Coach Lee. No, LeVon. I'll give it to LeVon. I had to think about it. I had to think about it. Okay, okay, okay. I got a representation. So for one through... I want to talk to you. Ray and Ryan, you guys are doing an incredible job on social media. You guys are probably two of the best promoters, and you both are very good arm wrestlers, and I am honored to have you guys

SPEAKER_02: Number one. And then it's like this, right? So for one through or two through five, Hermes, Alex, Genadi, you know, Dimitri, Slav maybe, Devin. Okay, so number two. Oh, that's that close. So you don't really favor anyone against the rest.
SPEAKER_02: yeah it's levon number one and no idea i don't think anybody has a i mean there's no nobody has a real idea after that i mean it's just kind of guesswork i think i think 10th through 15th is more accurate than the top five two to six or seven or something yeah yeah yeah anyways guys it has been like almost two hours very sorry i i love talking with you guys and sorry for keeping you guys so busy
