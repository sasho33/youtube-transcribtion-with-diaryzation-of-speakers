SPEAKER_03: Hello, Ryan. I'm just watching Ryan's newest video. It's so funny. He's like... What are you watching? You left him? Ryan's new video. He's like, I'm trying so hard to be good. I'm trying so hard. But apparently everyone thinks Coach Ray is the favorite. It's so funny. Yeah, we will talk about it. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: oh he made it like he made a video uh he did a hallelujah um rendition you know for a bit with me and just you know did a little singing and i don't know if you saw it it's funny and i try to make
SPEAKER_03: I thought he was going to talk till the end. No, no, at the end he sang a little bit. It was good. I was like, no one has showed me this much love ever. And I spent like a whole day trying to make a video, like a rap diss track. And they just couldn't. I spent 10 hours writing things and I was like, it's not good. How does it feel
SPEAKER_03: when another man is making songs for you it's kind of who else you know who else no girl is going to make songs for me i know that you take what you get if if that's not funny i don't know what is yeah so you are saying it's better than nothing huh
SPEAKER_03: i'll take it what are you guys laughing i'm trying so hard to be nice i'm trying so hard to be good it's so hard you're just sorry you just have you watched it yet i watched it 38 seconds and it's just like you're like you're like i'm trying so hard just go live again press live right now
SPEAKER_04: Are we already live? We are live. I love it. I got to say the comments. I got to pull up. Are we live? There we go. We're live right now. Let's get on, gents. I was asking Ray
SPEAKER_00: i was asking ray how does it feel uh that another man is making songs for him and he said it's better than nothing since no girl is gonna make songs for him and i i uh i'm like i'm no musician hanging as as i think everyone though
SPEAKER_04: I know that my my voice is my voice is as smooth as raised skin but I still don't think that I could actually pull it off as a musician but for special moments like this I'm so glad that someone reminded me that I used to do this in the past because I had a lot of fun with that and um
SPEAKER_03: I spent 10 hours writing down a diss track. I did that off the top of my head pretty much, man. But I wanted to make sense. Like 10 hours in the process. I have auto-tuned everything ready. I found the beat and it just didn't click. And I'm just sorry. You just put it out anyway. Don't be embarrassed. Don't be embarrassed, man. I've put out my share of embarrassing videos, as we all know.
SPEAKER_04: I was actually really surprised at the response. I think 80% of people actually liked it. I liked it. I love it. Unlike the polls. Unlike the polls where you're the clear favorite in this match. I don't know if I'm clear favorite, but most likely people believe I can win at least one round. Everybody. You're the favorite. Look at Engin's poll, the official poll. What is it? He's 54% favorite after like 5,000 votes or something. I mean, it should be 56-44.
SPEAKER_04: That's what I want. I'm like, come on, at least. You are known with 44%. Exactly. If I'm going to be the underdog, at least get me to under 44%. So 2% of you need to drop off and go for Ray. I was surprised. I'm trying so hard to be good. I expected like 65-35 for Ryan that all two.
SPEAKER_00: um don't like don't don't say it out loud again don't say it out loud let me check it i haven't seen it i will tell you something i have seen this guy six i have seen this guy pulling 70 kilo in the past i have seen him not long ago i think it was 2018 europeans in bulgaria yeah that's why i'm sure i i'm right that's why i'm practicing with 16 year olds
SPEAKER_00: pushing his limits to be 90 kilo while like it is your very comfortable weight category. And I don't know, I just like if it was left arm, I would just say like you have no chance. This is not pushing any kind of limits. I'm glad you stopped there. I thought I was worried. I'm not pushing any kind of limit. I was worried you were going to get old Devin Laredo. I looked at 70 kilos like you looked at 65.
SPEAKER_00: I have a question for you guys. Do you guys think that these poll results, like, for example, I will have a long question. The one of them is, like, whenever people voted for Devon, like, 60% or 55%, like, was it like they voted for what they believe or they voted for who they want to win?
SPEAKER_04: There's definitely some of that going on here. We know that I'm not popular in the internet space. We know that. Despite my amazing good looks, I got a haircut today. Look at this. I look more like Justin Timberlake today than I've ever looked before. And still people are voting against me. But there is a big factor on that angle. Corey me a river.
SPEAKER_04: that's another question in a short way is it because they love ryan or is it because some people hate you right i mean they hate me they're like great they like race yeah right how could you know he looks like a like a child still like everyone wishes they had his skin um like
SPEAKER_04: Look at, like, no, like, Engin, you've done well. Engin's 3,000 years old and has got the toll of the sport on his face.
SPEAKER_04: raymond's looks like he was born three weeks ago uh like i don't know how he does it but he's a popular man because of all those reasons very polite his slight accent is a hit amongst amongst all the americans as well they love him uh they really want him to win because they just want me to lose but they that's the thing i'm trying real i'm trying really hard not to talk about his arm wrestling ability because i don't want to be seen as the big bad wolf again
SPEAKER_04: Because, no, I can't say it. I'm just going to keep on saying I'm the underdog. Ryan, I have a question for you. Is it like kind of later than you usually sleep at the time over there? Or have you been drinking? I don't sleep anymore. I know Ray was talking about I'm going to struggle with jet lag. I don't even know what time zone it is for me anymore. I don't sleep.
SPEAKER_00: know that and you you will talk it'll be four in the morning for me or something we're chatting away i don't know i'll be fine you see no it's 11 it's 11 p.m you know non-stop and it's good it's good like you remember the time that john was i'm just in a good mood i'm in a good mood i got raleigh right here
SPEAKER_00: No, no, no. You have been with Ray in many different programs. You were not like this. Do you remember the time that John was part of Neil's program? He was half drunk. He was just talking, talking. Like right now, Ryan sounds the same way. I have had two beers in the last half an hour. That's the truth.
SPEAKER_04: at least it's not devil's lettuce so it's nice that's true it's too big no no i had the i had the korean number two arm wrestler he's on holidays in australia korean 80 kilo rank two hanging i like that cup i don't interrupt my story i like that cup what was the cup i missed it can i see the cup oh yeah yeah yeah yeah oh i don't get it what do you like okay
SPEAKER_04: I had the Korean number two ranked arm wrestler round. And we had some beers. And then again, I was trying to be good. They were asking me, how's your confidence level against Ray? And I said to them and they laughed at me. I said, I'm trying genuinely really hard not to do what I normally do. And just, yeah. And they were laughing at me saying, you can't do it, Ryan. You can't hold it in.
SPEAKER_04: i'm trying i'm trying i think it's going to come out there's still time there's still time but i'm going to try for as long as i can yeah hey i saw the best comment coach rey enigma of age yeah yeah and and ryan are you not ashamed to pull a sub junior guy
SPEAKER_04: Well, exactly. I feel like that's the part of me that I'm trying to suppress that that I feel that it is a bit unfair. Like I have, like I said, I've been training with 16 year olds. I've been training with the smallest people I can find. And that's no joking. And I did I'm training with the 16 year old lives near me. And I've got the Korean guys in tonight. The only reason that's happening is because no one else trains with Ryan.
SPEAKER_04: Oh, yeah. Evgeny my former best friend. All of Australia is in my DMs. Oh, I know. Jordan David, my apparent best friend of Once Upon a Time, is literally putting words in Ray's mouth. Ray put out a video the other week just talking smack. And I'm like, the dude sounds exactly like Jordan David. But literal former best friend is now helping Ray to apparently. I'll make you believe that.
SPEAKER_04: No, I know. I'm certain of it. I heard the words. I'm like, that's Jordan David talk. Jordan's been giving you tips. But you are the favorite. From the chat. Just help me. These guys are still in my show. This is what happens when you're in my two YouTubers. Engin, just enjoy the show. What can I say? What can I say? Ask your questions. I'm just watching. I like it. I'm just joking.
SPEAKER_04: do you have we got a plan you know this is the main plan have we got a plan again on how we're going to manage the commentary situation if if like ray or is heartbroken and can't i don't know like what happens if because are we are we commentating immediately after the match i'm ugly so you know i don't know i asked her but i asked about this to ray and he said that it depends on how long it will
SPEAKER_04: take you know ryan to recover after his loss that's what he's wrong yeah i'm all in all of the delusion is in on this one like i i have no choice it's been too long i haven't had an international super match in almost three years or some nonsense half of my youtube thinking half of my youtube subscribers don't actually think i can arm wrestle they think i just commentate
SPEAKER_04: Literally, I have my finger on the pulse on my channel, and there's a good chunk of people that have subscribed to me that have no idea that I've ever arm wrestled anyone international before. They just think I lose to Lachlan, and then I'm going to get smashed by Ray. He's the favorite, remember? So that means that this is your opportunity to prove yourself.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, yeah. I'm the underdog. So it's all like, Hey, all only thing I said, I'm confident because I feel good. I've been training hard. I feel excellent.
SPEAKER_03: I can't believe it. Somehow, the table switched. I love to be underdog. I love to be underdog. I do not listen to this. You keep telling me you're the underdog. Shut up. I am the underdog, okay? You're not. Officially, there's only one poll that matters. I'm losing polls on my channel, Ray. On my channel, I'm losing polls.
SPEAKER_04: Hey, there's no more of a loss than that. Are you serious? You are losing the poll in your channel as well? Yeah. Like 70% yesterday I put out a poll. I don't know if my channel's trolling me or not. But... Ryan even tried to make a joke. 70% of my own subscribers said that Ray was going to win. What the hell?
SPEAKER_03: yeah they know they know uh so i woke up today and i thought i have never staked any match i'm gonna stake myself just for heck of it can't do it this is a gift this is a massive gift to me i i i thought i was going to be coming in with the pressure i thought i was going to have to like
SPEAKER_04: be real thick skinned. But man, this is a blessing. Everyone likes to be the underdog. So I'll settle in. I'll get comfy. Uncle John's are messing show. Thank you for your support. He says under cat is bigger than underdog. Yeah. Wait,
SPEAKER_00: This is so funny. I think there's a super chat coming through, Engin. Oh, did you say? Yeah, it will be in post. OK, I get the question. The question is, hang on, hang on. We can't move on yet. There's a super chat. There's a super chat. Don't miss it. Oh, Ryan Blue Bowen, thank you for joining our program. You are very generous. He said, I hate cats. Do you hate cats or do you hate cat owners?
SPEAKER_04: no oh look look look but i have a problem with both i i oh really i genuinely i look this this people might might judge me really badly people people already say i haven't got a soul so i probably can't go any worse than this but but i
SPEAKER_04: on multiple occasions in my life. I'm someone who I don't look, I'm driving along and a cat runs out. I don't swerve. I don't swerve. I just maintain the pace and look at the cat. If the cat's that bad and dumb that it ran out, then I just let it happen. Destiny. I don't like cats. The question is, have you ever been close to a cat in your house? No.
SPEAKER_00: They're not welcome. I will tell you something. I was thinking the same way until the three-month-old cat came to my home. And then he was just like,
SPEAKER_04: I mean, just one time, give yourself a chance, you will love the cats. Trust me. That's an amazing animal. Look, children are innocent, no matter what their species. Children are children. Like a little baby cat. Look, I won't. I'll be nice to it. But the instant that cat gets over that line from being whatever you call it, baby cat. Look at that thing. Look at the eyes in that thing there. That thing is evil. No. That thing. This is evil.
SPEAKER_04: Cats are so evil. Cats literally do not give a shit about their owner at all. They pretend to care. They use them. That cat would knife Ray the first chance it had. Okay, how do we do poll here?
SPEAKER_00: I will lose it. There's not a chance I win this damn poll. Not a chance. No, no, no. Listen, I was gonna make a poll and ask if Ryan is drunk, or it's too late and sleepy. Or I'm missing something. There's another super chat. Len says lens. I'm sorry for my English. Thanks for your support. Love your channel. Brian is it?
SPEAKER_00: A different level. Ray is going down. That's what I'm hoping for. That's what I'm hoping for. That's what I'm hoping for. Dog lover. There is one guy. You have a hater here. You follow the chat? I don't have any haters. You see, he said, get rid of Bowen. He wrote about the same thing like 20 times.
SPEAKER_04: I think he needs some time to get a break. I like the comment from Steadfast Performance. He mentioned that I'm a pitbull and Ray's a cat. Dave you ever seen a cat and a pitbull fight, Engin?
SPEAKER_04: uh-huh i'll give it to the cats cats are brave like like ray in this situation the cat the cat you'll see a cat sitting on a you've seen that gif there's a cat sitting on the couch imagine my whole being is just turning people's just asleep people's asleep having a nice time minding its own business this cat just out of nowhere smack smack on on the top of the pitbull's head oh
SPEAKER_00: But we know what happened. If it all came down to it. If people didn't know who we are and they watch this podcast now, would they think that we are arm wrestlers? No. We are fighting for cats' rights. And finance won't take all those rights away from the cats. The question is, what is it going to change after this match is over?
SPEAKER_04: What's going to change? Yeah. David you ever think, will you like, like whenever Ray is going to talk about our message, will you just say, shut the fuck up, you know? Don't you see I'm here, you know? Well, there's a lot on the line for me, Engin, on this one. Like I said, I am, I'm the underdog. Let's clarify that first. I am the underdog by substantial margin on every poll that I've seen. But there's a lot on the line. If I lose this one, Engin,
SPEAKER_00: i don't know if i'll ever i don't know if i can dig myself out of the internet hole that i'll be in like what the hell happens then where do i go who how do i get a match i can't i have to start playing you just literally just take it on the chin you just take it from other countries and i literally now i understand now i understand it is ryan that made people vote for you ray so after he loses he will say i was underdog anyways
SPEAKER_04: need look that's getting that's getting way too fancy for me honestly i i'm surprised i thought i was going to be the favorite but i'm not i don't know what i've missed but like i said i don't know if my youtube account's trolling me but hey all i know is that if no i'm screwed i might as well i might as well give him my youtube channel
SPEAKER_00: okay where is the super chat kings cross and thank you for your super chat they hated jesus because he told the truth ryan is right cats are not to be trusted
SPEAKER_04: trust cats with anything are you crazy they're cats it's not like you're gonna trust your dog to do some chores around the house come on and a dog is like literally the only animal on earth where you know they genuinely love you when you look into a dog's eyes he loves you when you get home from work he's there he loves you if you die a dog will cry on your damn grave i want to see a photo of a cat crying on a grave it doesn't exist they get over things very soon
SPEAKER_00: exactly like done my cats sometimes they're the one who buried you they're taking a on the grave no the question i'm asking to do paul i mean this guy on the comment section and to you as well who has more to lose in this match oh ryan i've got it hey may even as the underdog i think even as the underdog
SPEAKER_04: I don't know if I can withstand the tirade. I'm going to have to turn my comments off for a month.
SPEAKER_03: I'm going to need to hire you, Engin, to block people for me. I won't be able to handle it. Easy fix. It's an easy fix, Ryan. You just take it on the chin and you understand where you are. You don't try to beat someone just because you think you can beat someone, but you go and actually see where you are.
SPEAKER_04: the problem why are we getting why are you getting so serious all of a sudden with me i'm not i'm not getting serious but it's like you know don't talk to me with that tone right don't talk to me with that tone i don't like that you don't like that tone okay you ain't gonna love it on august 6th as well don't can we can we bring a cat to the press conference
SPEAKER_00: I'll just go and pick them all up, you know. Downstairs, there is a lady with 30 cats living in the same apartment. Oh, no. Yeah. I feel like you're in the wrong country. None of them is like special kind of cats, but the cats from the city, she finds them when they are injured or something, when they are baby. She takes them to veterinary and she takes care, you know, that they are
SPEAKER_00: beautiful animal ryan you are so prejudiced trust me i love dogs as well i love all animals i love them when they're children just when they're children well listen listen what happened to you just to tell us you know what happened to you when you were a kid something happened to you with the cats didn't like him
SPEAKER_04: wouldn't surprise that could have been a cat like that would have done but it wasn't it wasn't a dog though definitely wasn't a dog um what happened to me when i was young and i don't know hey a lot of things a lot of things happened i have german shepherd and because i i trusted him so much they told me that i cannot give him a piece of meat front of him and take it back so i tried to take it back
SPEAKER_00: i still have the scars here you know that it will bite me from here from the wrist but i still love them it was my fault so i'm sure that if you had some experience with the cat it must be your fault as well yeah so but you're trying to compare stealing food from an animal to me just walking past like i'm gonna go to the fridge
SPEAKER_04: a cat will freaking launch at me what the hell i'll go to i'll go to a friend's place who's got a cat and literally i'll just get up i'm just gonna go grab some water from the fridge and this cat cat looks sideways at me and freaking like getting bit on the hand by a cat's not nice a little freaking rabies teeth and stuff what the hell i don't trust cat thing and i i don't trust ray anymore either
SPEAKER_00: okay i don't since you don't trust me no i trust ewing and i just don't trust castle ray oh okay so okay okay okay anyway so if we if we go back to the match um trust me like tell me the truth how do you see the mesh right
SPEAKER_00: Do you know how I feel? Why are you just talking to Ryan? None of the questions were addressed to me. Everything is just, Ryan, how do you feel today? Ryan, let's talk about your childhood. What happened there? Brian, you answer the question first. I think Ryan is drunk a little bit. So let me enjoy a little bit. My
SPEAKER_00: opinion is that you want to beat ray so quick without getting exhausted so that when you make a poll on your community page who should i pull directly after that so you want to keep yourself fresh and you mention my name there so that you can also prove that you're gonna beat me oh
SPEAKER_04: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. And you don't make more people angry at me.
SPEAKER_04: if i blocked all my if i if i blocked all my haters then you know i'd only have 10 of my channel left so don't don't let me have none anger no no no you made this poll you made this poll you made this yeah yeah yeah but you read it wrong you read it wrong and that's what yeah but listen you can read it like
SPEAKER_00: don't always write like how it is you write something but there is something you gotta imagine my voice when i'm saying it you gotta imagine my voice and the good man not the bad man like i'm gonna be drying uh no ray i'm gonna you said i'm gonna be gray so quickly after that who just think you want me to okay
SPEAKER_04: When I wrote that post, I see it as this. We all know it's a long way from Narnia to Istanbul. It's a really long way. And I haven't done it in three years. Now, after the match, I know that there are so many legends and good names in that room.
SPEAKER_04: and that they're all so freaking badass that I can't grip up with the whole room and have anything for anyone because they're all too freaking good. So I want to know, I want to know, whilst I've still got something left, who should I just have a casual practice pool with that I can go, oh, look at this. This is what it feels like to pull this person. Seeing that it's been so long, because after that, and then it's all just, it's nothing. I'm dead in the water after that.
SPEAKER_04: So Ryan, I don't want to match with you. And I just, I just want to group up with you and just, just go, oh, that's fricking what it feels like. David you make this statement on any video? Cause people will find it. They'll put it together. You know, this, I probably made it five times in slightly different ways. Which one, which one? The bench press one. It's fine. How much do you bench press again?
SPEAKER_04: Do you remember how much you bench press? 50 kilos, maybe 70 if I'm feeling good. How much do you bench press, Ray? It doesn't matter. We talked about this last week. Coach Ray bench presses one Corey West. I bench press...
SPEAKER_00: Who do I bench for? I bench for Krasimir. You bench 200 kilo? 207. My best. Wow. Wow. I think I can bench like 100 kilo. But I can, I can, I'm not really following anything, you know, just I don't, I didn't know, you know. There is a super chat, Abdulrahman, Abdulrahman Kabil. If Ryan loses this match, he probably still thinks that he can challenge Zola or Irakli.
SPEAKER_04: I need to ask you guys a question. And this super chat makes me think of this question. Surely I'm not the only fucking human in the arm wrestling world that does this. Sorry for my language, Jacob. I hope that I get you. No, no, no.
SPEAKER_04: Which part? Just listen, I've got to say it. Surely I'm not the only person who goes into their mind and imagines a certain set of circumstances where you're like, oh, if I could get to this position and it's all in your mind at this point, then I could do something. And then you reverse engineer it back to a ready go and say, how do I get there? Oh, it's an uphill battle. Todd are I can't do it, but look, there's a way.
SPEAKER_04: i'd like to try and aim for it surely i'm not the only person who does that so wait because that's my one of my biggest problem genuine problem is someone asked me directly to my face do you think under any circumstances you could beat a rackley's iraqis philly i have to tell the truth and say look yeah
SPEAKER_04: under under a certain circumstances i could but again am i saying i'd beat them no but like if if levon arm wrestles with his pinky i reckon i can take him maybe that's the circuit i don't know you get what i mean you do that again don't you surely surely you imagine how and go back from there
SPEAKER_00: No, no. Right. The difference would be no one would send it out loud. You know, you can Okay. Like to do it, right. I kind of like to do it. Instead of talking so much. That is like, I won the world championship. We were going
SPEAKER_00: yeah people were saying the teammates you know i'm gonna hopefully i can take a medal i will try to win but i never said i'm gonna win never ever and i was just my prime i mean guys let me finish i was having pictures pictures with you guys and we don't like this in the final but it is better to do it than saying that you're gonna do it yeah yeah yeah look and that's the thing this is like i said the the people will will mix mix your words and this is where i'm
SPEAKER_04: I genuinely think everyone does the same thing. I'm just the only one who says it out loud. But you have to imagine a possibility of being able to win a match. You have to imagine. And when someone says, will you, you can say, oh, look, I think it's possible.
SPEAKER_03: I think it's possible. I'm not the favorite, but I'm not the favorite against Ryan. I'm not the favorite against Ryan, but hell, I'm imagining how it's going to go. Ryan, it's you can make this. I can, like, in my head, like, yeah, I can beat Levan, like you said, you know. Then pretty much I can beat everyone. Can I do it? Most likely not. The difference comes to execution and everything else. It's...
SPEAKER_03: Like, I don't know, like, Engin knows this because Engin's been around and arm-wrestled everyone. He arm-wrestles someone, he cannot move them, and the guy that you couldn't move beats someone. There's no chance you're going to tell, like, I can beat that guy, you know? You're like, okay, I couldn't beat this guy, most likely I have to beat this guy to beat that guy.
SPEAKER_04: I get it, but I still can't help myself. I can't help myself. I'll admit it. I can't help myself. Evgeny the guy that I can't move. Evgeny the guy I can't move. The guy I can't move, I say to myself, shit, if I could convince him to sneeze at the start and look the other way and get the ref to give me two centimeters of webbing height, then it's possible. I just can't help myself. I imagine the way.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know. I guess it's just me. It's you. It's delusional. Yeah, there is arm wrestling. A full-blown delusion. Thank you for your super chat. He said, will you make Sarchel? Will Sarchel happen? I'm not planning, my friend. Thank you for your support. Wow. So...
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I'm kind of convinced that Ryan has been drinking. Me too. Me too. It's more than two beers. Or it's, hey, Ryan, how's the weight cut going? You have full cheeks and everything else. There's no... Hey, let's talk about what happens when he cannot cut to 90. What happens then? I'm 91.9 right now.
SPEAKER_04: sure it's only two kilos you need to lose yeah i can piss that out easy let's do it but what happens when you don't well then i can't win i can't win any prize money england's paying us a hundred thousand dollars to the winner of this match i can't i thought it was a million oh it's million now yeah
SPEAKER_04: i'm kidding you know but yeah just busting your balls i'm happy i'm like i said i'm happy that you're running you're taking care of yourself you're doing no no no no i'll make weight it's it's it's an athlete's obligation to make weight i'll make weight don't you worry um i won't let myself is there is there a sauna at the hotel or something like that yes all right give me give me two hours there and i'll be at wait what how what day wins wayne how how much when you arriving what day you arriving
SPEAKER_04: No, no, no. Day before all the events. Friday morning, you weigh in. Saturday evening, you compete. Okay, beautiful. So Friday, I'll get up nice and bright and early Friday, get in that sauna, I'll be awake. Yep. Easy. You might see me with a shirt off if you come in there, right? I will do it. I'll do it and sit in the sauna just with you.
SPEAKER_04: It's a rare sight. I didn't answer the question on how I thought the match was going to go, Engen. Do you want me to tell you? Yeah. Honestly? Yes, yes, honestly. Okay, honestly, I...
SPEAKER_04: No, no, okay. Honestly, I think Ray's going to attempt to hold on to me out of straps in round one. I see him investing a lot of time and energy into that in his training preparation and the way he's talking. Suggests to me that that's his option A. I think he expects me to try to top roll against it. Maybe not completely top roll, but just kind of
SPEAKER_04: Mostly a top roll attempt is what he expects. That's not actually what I intended in round one. Round one, I'm happy to actually just find out who's stronger. Wrist on wrist. Yeah, take notes. I'm just going to meet him in the middle and go sideways. If he's giving me the signals that he wants to hold on, I will just hold on as well and we'll just find out what happens.
SPEAKER_04: That's round one. I genuinely think that's the way it's going to go. I think my arm's longer than his, so he's going to be in the low hook position. I'm going to be in a high hook position. And it'll come down to a side pressure. And my side pressure and rotation up against his wrist flexion supination. The winner of that little battle will get the round one. And then I expect him to either...
SPEAKER_04: Slip and go to straps and try to do the same thing again, round two, or go to his top roll that's now apparently his new weapon. I don't think his top roll is going to be... I think his top roll will be good enough that I won't be able to hold on to it out of straps. But if he's top rolling, I'll top roll. So we'll go to straps and then in straps, if he's top rolling, I'll just go sideways. I won't top roll.
SPEAKER_00: just hook him if he's top no i'm asking i'm asking who's gonna win with what score and how i'm gonna win i'm gonna win three zero and how hard it's gonna be very convincing oh you'll be like
SPEAKER_04: No, I think raised at the level where if I hesitate, if I muck around, if I'm casual, I'll get bogged down in a grind and then it will become endurance. But I think, and what I will look to achieve, option A is just hit as hard as I can and don't even let it stop. Just bang. That's what I intend to do. If he's good enough to bring it in, tie that up and bring it into a match, then we'll play the long game.
SPEAKER_04: And I think I win the long game anyway. But the long game will be fun if it goes there. But I won't be... Usually I enter a super match straight into the long game. I usually am reeling people in and putting the squeeze on. Against Corey, I'm not going to do that. I'm going to look to kill. And Corey, you, how you see the match? It can be...
SPEAKER_03: it can be everything I allow it to be. So if I feel like we can have a nice grinder, let's have a nice grinder.
SPEAKER_03: If I feel I need to smash you three times, it's gonna happen. But I think there's- Do you really believe that, Ray? Do you really believe you can? And you do? You really believe you can just- I'm absolutely confident that I can smack you to the center. I'm absolutely, no, sorry, to the side. I'm absolutely know you have a spot there where you're really good. And if I'm not careful, you can bring me back from that spot.
SPEAKER_03: I know those things. Also, there's going to be a point in the match where I top roll you from the hook. It's happening. In one of those rounds, that's my mental note. That's what I want to do. Everything else. Well, that's like, yeah, Todd Hutchings does that to his opponents in the final round just to rub it in. Guess who allowed me to pat you on the head? Who gave me the blessing?
SPEAKER_04: yeah i'm sorry i don't i don't i i actually think ray's reaching into a realm where he's actually at risk of of of of capitulating there because he he's i i don't think he believes that he can actually just slam me to the pad i don't think under any circumstance he thinks he can do that you look strong right before the pad you you look absolutely strong there
SPEAKER_03: i will test myself i'll see if i can do it i i'm really i'm really interested in that but you're backpedaling slightly you're no longer smashing me to the back i'm i'm being real like i will i will try to pin you to the side i understand there's thread there and you're really good at that point i'm i'm giving you something are we just going like this round one yeah we can do that i'm up for that yeah let's do it yeah all right
SPEAKER_04: There is another super chat arm wrestling academia. In what circumstance does Ryan think he could beat himself? That's hacking the system there. That's causing a perpetual fucking loop in my mind. What do I do? I wish I could arm wrestle myself. That would be frigging awesome. I have a question for you, Ryan.
SPEAKER_03: i know i'm the strongest you know at least this year i don't know you never know but i'm strongest you're not your strongest when was my strongest when was my strongest i would say you know you were goodly prepared for um just looking at the cheeks and everything for lachlan very different yeah much fundamental power then
SPEAKER_04: fundamental power then way bigger than it is now for sure i mean i was 104 kilos and i was gassed up and just all like crazy uh very different now i'm back to the normal weight of myself with 90 kilos my so my face you just got used to the big fat face um i feel i actually feel amazing right now you
SPEAKER_04: Despite you thinking I look tired and that, cause I keep on doing videos as I'm like exhausted from running. Um, I feel, I feel I have a spring in my step. I feel my aerobic capacity is it's responded better than I thought it would. Um, so it's actually just genuine, genuinely as a human, it feels good to feel like this, but as far as my, my strongest fundamentally, no, but I would say if I was to, I've never taken the foot off the pedal in terms of.
SPEAKER_00: increasing my integrity of center my fingers my elbow i think they're at their best it's hard to know isn't it it's like i haven't been working on my first five millimeters you know what like i have been arm wrestling for 30 years i have heard many new terms by ryan that about arm wrestling that i didn't know like integrity or elbow integrity this like i seriously i'm not just
SPEAKER_04: it's not criticizing not making fun or something but he had the guy has his own unique way of describing uh things or i didn't know that it already existed there you go that's cool but i didn't know that that was the case so that's cool oh yeah yeah i don't know for me no no if that was just yeah elbow me talking about elbow integrity is a fact that was just
SPEAKER_04: just me listening to my own body going as i as i progressed through these matches what was the difference in that match why'd i win that match why'd i lose that match and and i've discovered in under in the last few years my elbow integrity my connective tissue however we want to put it
SPEAKER_04: If I'm dominant in that regard, it just opens up so many other lanes and gives me control and access to far many more positions. Where if I feel like I arm wrestle someone and their elbow feels like it's more conditioned to me,
SPEAKER_04: And, and that's just who can control center. Cause at the end of the day, someone's backing off from center. And that person, in my opinion, is always the person who their elbow sends them warning signals to their brain saying, shit's going to break unless you back off. Like there's going to be an injury in your soft tissue or something that just happens. So whoever doesn't get that warning sign gets control of center. And I feel like that's not even a muscular thing. I feel like that's a conditioning thing. So hence elbow conditioning. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: There is another super shed more arm wrestling corner. I'm looking forward to this to pull in each other and even more to them commenting the event afterwards. In all seriousness, they are a great couple. Great. I love it. Thank you, brother. I don't understand this, but I will while you are here, since the race also like like deep in social media, so he would know
SPEAKER_00: better than i do but like i don't understand why people would hate you right i mean i i understand if they would they would not follow you or something i understand that if they would hate me and there are a lot because i am kind of a little bit aggressive and this and that but but for you i mean you may have your own way they may not like it but
SPEAKER_00: You are not a harmful person. You are not harming anyone. You are not saying bad things about people. I mean, why would they hate you? I don't understand that part. Do you have an idea, Ray? I will ask Ray. Oh, no, I will ask Ray. What do you think, Ray?
SPEAKER_00: uh it's because ryan makes some statements that kind of don't hold any water that's the problem and you know he's like i'm gonna go you can't and then he doesn't listen listen you cannot hate someone whoa whoa because he oh why would you hate someone he's not harming anyone he may think that you know he's the best or something you know but why would you hate him you know because of this
SPEAKER_04: I don't think people hate me again. If we're talking genuine hate, the list has got to be short. We're talking people enjoy highlighting my idiocy is the way that they would imagine it. They get a kick out of it because at the end of the day, everyone gets their little dopamine boost.
SPEAKER_04: buzz when their notifications blow up. And one way for an anonymous loser in a basement to get that dopamine kick is to be whatever anonymous account, troll name, I couldn't think of anything.
SPEAKER_04: make some comment that all the people who are of that nature agree with so that's all right like I said it's I don't think people there's only a very small percentage of people who actually genuinely try to to try to just I'm wrong people say that they don't hate you but they don't like you
SPEAKER_00: Oh, yeah, yeah, that's fine. That's, that's accurate. That is I'm gonna do a poll on my channel. Do you in a way like obsession, obsession that they about the way that you may not like someone you may ignore, right? But they don't ignore you. They're addicted to my content as much as they are anything else. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: If they genuinely hated me, they wouldn't watch or get involved at all. The dislikes pay the bills as much as the likes. See, the guy says, I am bought, developed to shit on Bowen. I will ruin every chat Bowen is part of from now on. Where was that? I need to see that one. Say it again. Just read the guy, you know. What's that? Wood or something, you know.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, I don't know. Hang on. Can you read it again? I missed it. Kind of savage. Go up a little bit. Go up a little bit. Is it under the super chat? Under the super chat? Yeah, under. Somebody just deleted it already. I don't know who deleted it. What were they going to do? Is it possible to not delete? Bring it back? I don't think so.
SPEAKER_00: remove no i don't think we can bring it back okay whatever okay okay anyway so sure they'll find me on another comment section somewhere okay just uh push me one step closer okay okay ray just short score and how how difficult it will be
SPEAKER_03: don't know i don't know how difficult it will be i'm training so what happens if i three zero you with ease right what happens then uh so i think i'm pretty good now like uh the training everything this year i'm i'm getting way better i'm i'm seeing that top that i thought i couldn't scratch i see like okay so i will say you are really good i'll i'll give you that 110 million percent if that happens right you win it or not
SPEAKER_03: I'm confident I'm going to win. I'm seeing this guy. It's not the same guy. I hope it's a war because I love war. But if it's 3-0, that's good enough for me. That's good enough for me. Okay. There we go. SG Records just pulled up the comment. For a moment there, I thought it was coming from SG Records. I was like, hang on, this dude's nice. He's some Georgian nice dude.
SPEAKER_00: but then all good sg we're still good we're still good okay did you guys see the the last match i just announced yes matt mask and uh iraqli yeah yeah oh yeah some i have been you know communicating with matt he said that you know he has been training like crazy already not not after this match was said you know after he went back to canada he kept training i think he made this
SPEAKER_00: like some kind of matter of honor after his last experience. And I don't think he will come to Istanbul in any kind of bad shape. I think he will come to Istanbul as good as he can be. And some people say that, don't you see like what Irakli did to Marcio? And then I just made a search and then I watched Matt Mass versus Marcio. It was like similar way.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, Matt also beat Marcio in a similar way that he beat Marcio. So let's see. Let's see. Top rolls again. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Right. Top rolls. Yeah. That one round that Matt won against Gasparini in here, in Yalova. You were there, right? Yeah. That shape, because Hermes was near 120 kilos there.
SPEAKER_00: under 18 maybe, and that shape versus Irakli can be a good one. Yeah. I think it's a good, what's your favorite match on the, on the card. Which one are you looking forward to most? Uh, Ray versus Ryan. Is that real? Are you honest? Is that, are you kidding? Listen in, in, in, in different ways to judge the things.
SPEAKER_00: They're different ways to judge the things. It's like when you say you love your mom and you love your wife. They're two different things. You love them both the most, don't you? Yeah, yeah. This has its own interesting parts. And then when you look at the... Which one? Are we the wife or are we the mother? The one that you... With the beef, you and him. It's just like... We're the wife. You love us like you love the wife. I don't think that it's just
SPEAKER_00: Like, I cannot say it's personal, but it's kind of like friendly personal, you know? Yeah. Like, you know what I mean? So I don't think that there is another match like this than this one. No, nothing else like this. I absolutely believe this is the main event. One second. You watch your pay-per-view spike at the beginning of that showing. And then drop. It's... I'm listening. No, listen.
SPEAKER_00: Your internet. I will find you. I will find this. You guys hear me? Yeah, I will find out. You guys don't hear me. I heard you say, Oh, I will find out how come you guys are now. Then I will understand who is really confident after I asked this question, the answer. If Ray wins, Brian Bowen is gonna say I love kids. And if Ryan wins,
SPEAKER_00: Ray is going to say, I hate cats. I'll deal. Yeah, of course. I'll do it. Yeah. Okay. My cats know it's not personal, so it doesn't matter even if that happens. There is an impossibility like this, Ray? No. Why did you need to mention this, I think? Because you always have to have a backup. I think because we're starting the card,
SPEAKER_03: And it doesn't matter how the match ends. People will just stay there to listen to that, to that experience. Exactly. How good is that? Yeah. One of us is going to be sitting there. Oh my God. It's 112 kilos. I was right here. Um,
SPEAKER_00: Okay, so the other matches that you are asking me, like I think that Ongar Baya versus John, beautiful match. That's the mother match. Yeah, that's just incredible match. Also, Prudnik versus Kaka Sings, incredible match. I think that all of them are incredible. It's a lot of good matches. Egle versus Gabriela. I mean, anyone who knows arm wrestling well enough knows that that match is God versus God.
SPEAKER_04: It is just like incredible match. And so. Somebody needs, can someone, one of those graphic designers out there do some sort of banner with cats and dogs freaking morph into this somehow? I need, I need something. I just, come on, just let's. Ray, do you want me to bring some cats to the stage that day?
SPEAKER_00: I'll feel better if some cats are in my corner. Oh, okay. Okay. Should I put one, a few of them at Ryan's corner as well? No, just put, so like wherever I go, if I find a cat, I'll be very happy. I'm like, oh, this is a random cat there. I'm like, oh, I'll pet him. Um, I, I think, I think.
SPEAKER_03: we need to have a banner or anything or make a post so people understand that me and Ryan were facing each other in the first match. And then after that, we straight go to the commentary booth for the whole event.
SPEAKER_04: And I think this will bring in more pay-per-views than the back. I just want to say, I'll be honest and say that the best scenario for your event, Engin, is if Ray smacks the shit out of me. And then I have to commentate with him.
SPEAKER_04: the frickin by him that that will cause alone again, you will set records for your event. If people people will pay just to get to listen to me have to suffer through that for the rest of the event. Because if they didn't already buy the paper, no, I'm saying that they will have so much fun. I'm just saying that's the best case scenario, your retention rate will be so high. If that happens.
SPEAKER_00: understand yeah it will be interesting i think one of you will be uh very upset during the day for sure yeah it's like are you though right are you going to be upset ray you you will be doing the interviews oh you want me on stage yes derek simmet and ryan there and don underwood is the announcer
SPEAKER_03: and then you will be what then that don underwood can do the interviews he's pretty you know you gotta have me in right i will just i will just have my arms raised through the whole event in the background i'll just stand like this i'm like yeah come on come on come on somebody somebody who is speaking right we need russian speaking guy right can right can run up there right can run up there
SPEAKER_04: You can have me Ryan Derek as a triple triple contact that commentary team. It was like a cat getting a hairball in your cat. Do your cats do that? Do they do they gag when you hold up a cucumber? They will like I'll bring flowers for my girlfriend, and they will eat all the flowers and then I just go what what what what do I carry with me to end them off? Hmm. Hey,
SPEAKER_03: Katnip, they hate Katnip. I have a question, Ray. David Paul Talbot beat... Vladislavs? Yeah, Vladislavs. Vladislavs lost. He pinned him twice, but lost on fouls. Vladislavs lost on fouls. He got into the press, but his elbow came off like two times. His elbow came out? Oh, okay. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: was that 2019 worlds i think romania yeah okay i forgot what i was doing i wanted to do something i forgot about the best let's do some some predictions about the event and then and and uh
SPEAKER_03: podcast. Let's start with Jerry and Genadi. Jerry and Genadi. Yeah, I think Genadi.
SPEAKER_04: I was so confused and took my brain so long to work out who Jetty was. Jerry Catarat. Oh, man. I was thinking, hang on, am I missing the language? What's going on? You guys are making fun with my accent. Yeah, what to do? No, no, legit. I noticed that aside, we'll come back to you with 100% payback, you know.
SPEAKER_00: I'll be coming with lots of Australian gifts just for you, Engin. One more time. What day do you arrive in Istanbul? Wednesday morning, 5 a.m. It depends. It depends. You can find flights all the time. So some arrive third, some arrive fourth. Why is it important? No, I just want to know. I just wanted to know. Wednesday. Wednesday. Cool. Okay. Okay.
SPEAKER_00: You're talking about Ryan? Yeah. Oh, I thought you were asking all the actors. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. I just... I think Genadi should win. Surely. He's in great form. We have no idea where Jerry's at. Sure, he's going to be strong. He'll put up a fight, but we don't know. So you got to go with Genadi. What if he was at his best? Where the best?
SPEAKER_04: Would it change your opinion? Yeah, if Jerry's at his very best, I think he takes a round for sure. I always feel like really legit press pullers always have at least one round in them where they kind of catch their opponent or their opponent wasn't familiar with the lane that they were coming at them with. And I feel Genadi may be vulnerable to that if Jerry's at that level.
SPEAKER_00: I expect him to get one through the gate. And then Genadi, I think, has the versatility to adjust and deny that press again. Okay, so we go next one. But there is a suggestion by Phil. Phil Woody. Engin, put Ryan in the basement hotel room for that one. Because you made fun with me. See what I have to deal with? See what I have to deal with, Engin? It's just everyday, Engin.
SPEAKER_00: And you know what I will do? I will have the, since I have an agreement with the hotel, I will have the key of his room. And then in the middle of the night, I will throw inside 10 cats and close the door. And I'll be there screaming, get up! There it is. And listen, he's sleeping. While he's sleeping, the cats are all around him. He opens his eye and the cat is right there. Oh, it's the worst nightmare, I think. Terrible.
SPEAKER_04: Okay, so let's go to Dave Chaffee versus Artem Morozov. You still got to be Dave. I think Dave. I think Dave. I don't know. I don't know. It's Morozov. He's one of those guys that I feel like his trajectory is really significant. And...
SPEAKER_04: I don't know. I think it'll be closer than, like, gut and history and instinct, says Dave as well. But Morozov, it won't surprise me to an enormous degree if Morozov pulls it off. After what Genadi did, Morozov will have confidence. Dave, it's Dave's match to lose. But, yeah, Morozov, you can't write him off. You know, when somebody asks Morozov, like,
SPEAKER_00: Prudnik beat you. And then how do you think that you can beat Dave Sheffield? And he said, Prudnik is so technical that he does not allow you to use your power. While he said, Dave is all about pressure. So he said that he will be able to use his power against Dave, if it is enough or not. But he said he will be entering the match. Unlike Prudnik that
SPEAKER_00: so quickly put him out of position right from the start so it kind of made sense to me but i still think that you know uh dave is very very strong so morozov needs to level up you know from last time we saw him uh to to august so you guys are saying
SPEAKER_04: Sorry, I just needed to. I'm wrestling academia. I'm wrestling academia in the chat. I see you over there throwing little constant little cat turds at me. I'm wrestling academia as a wannabe redhead. He's got these half ginger beer and he talks with a funky accent. I actually think he's pretty good. He's consistent. But I just thought I'd throw some cat turds back at you.
SPEAKER_03: Engin, are you going to change the name or the title of this video, Engin, Ray and Drunk Ryan? You'll get more views. Yeah. Yeah. They won't be disappointed either. Ryan, Ryan, Ryan, Ryan. We were right about it, right? What? That you are a little bit drunk.
SPEAKER_00: yeah i told you i was having some beers with the the korean guys yeah they just left how many beers riot not many many i'm just in a good mood not not more than 20 not more than 20. not more than 20. okay oh my god so great i just can't stop let let's go let's go to john bersing versus on garber
SPEAKER_03: I'm not betting against John anytime soon. I'm not betting against John. But it depends against who he is pulling, right? Well, in this one, I'm not betting against John. Okay. Yeah. You cannot call down the great ones. John just, I don't know how he does it. He can just continuously step up to phenomenal opponents and just always
SPEAKER_04: just be a bit ahead of them. It's remarkable the way he does it. Like what he did to Corey West. When I think of what Corey did to Crassie. And then when I think of what Corey did to Kadecha in those early rounds. And then John walks straight into that fire. It's like, oh my goodness. Very different shape with Ongarbaev. Great back pressure, great defensive top roller.
SPEAKER_04: I don't know. Can John force him into hook? I don't think so. Maybe. I don't think so. But I don't think John will look for it. I think John will try to stay high and get control of the hand and wrist. And they're both going to stay up there. Both really good defensive. The defensive pronation of Kitagali is really good. You saw him pull Prudnik a couple of years back where he won that first round in the top eight.
SPEAKER_04: Prudnik then was able to force the rest of the matches into a hook, but when those two went top roll on top roll, it was Ongubayeva who took it. So I don't know. It's a hard match for John, but again, you just can't bet against him, can you? So who is winning, right? I think John will. John will win. I think John will win. So both of you are thinking that John is going to win? Mm-hmm. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: And so let's go to Daniel Prokopchuk versus Corey Miller. I got Prokopchuk. Prokopchuk, yeah. Can you tell me, Ryan, how you see the match? You have it, but you see a dominance or you see like Corey is giving him some damage? I think...
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I think Corey has a very small lane that he could potentially navigate through with his speed off the go. But I feel like it's highly unlikely. I feel like Prokopcik's game in the strap will be far too good. He'll very safely and securely force it into a hook. He'll get a defensive stop. And I just feel like Corey Miller's pronation will collapse pretty significantly when he crashes into that.
SPEAKER_04: that defense that Prokopchik will put up. And then from there, it'll be very easy for Prokopchik. I mean, he's a phenomenal inside puller. So I think that one's a 3-0 Prokopchik. And you, Ray?
SPEAKER_03: yeah i think uh corey will hit him close to the pad prokopchuk will stop him and then bleed him out like he always does uh the speed of corey is a real thing it's ridiculously good uh you have to deal with it but
SPEAKER_03: soon as he gets stopped especially with that one it's very hard to beat him just because he's uh he's so much inside puller that he will wait for you to drown out and you know we have seen his matches time and time after again especially the big daniel prokopchuk 75 kilos i think it's yeah it's it's so you are you are thinking that daniel is going to force him in hook or
SPEAKER_03: he will see there's a there's a chance that corey will hit him close to the pad but he will still not take his wrist and then prokopchuk will get him back uh i understand and so egla versus gabriella right and left does egla have the winning record on gabriella yes yes
SPEAKER_00: usually don't don't train you know one time i invited her here uh for super match she pulled sarah beckman and during the press conference they asked her how many world titles she has she is like oh i stopped counting a long time ago you know i was like yeah
SPEAKER_00: doesn't care she doesn't train that much i don't know how motivated she is but she's not motivated for this match she is motivated so that that is why because she doesn't train so hard usually she needs a target you know like targeted like if we are talking about someone who stopped counting how many world titles she had a long time ago we are not talking about those
SPEAKER_00: so-called world titles that people are saying like 2735 or something you know just like they are winning in their backyard and saying that i'm like something you know world champion by beating only their countrymen and the same world champion i'm talking about real real world titles i'm talking about and so so i think that right now gabriella is uh gabriella is enough of motivation
SPEAKER_03: for eggly to train don't you think right i think so i think i think we will see very we will see a little bit different eggly but and i think i i think still she is the favorite she's she's a great arm wrestler and she's strong they will be around the same like there is no there is no weight limit yeah okay last time i asked english eggly is much taller
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I can see Egle's style in my mind, but I don't know her well. Gabriela, I know a lot more about. So it's a stab in the dark for me to pick that one. I don't know where to go. Yeah, I couldn't pick a winner. Yeah. Anyway, so Zulav versus Chen Shou.
SPEAKER_03: I think I think Chance Shaw will win.
SPEAKER_03: I think Chance Shaw has all the weapons needed to beat Zurab. He's big, so he has that advantage. It will be way harder for Zurab to keep his hand in. I think Chance hits really aggressively, especially in the last Supermatches we have seen him. He can take that hand. I think Todd Hutchings' hand is way better than Zurab's, and he has better leverages.
SPEAKER_03: and still and still so i think it could be a grinder it could end up three two both sides but it could end up one-sided for chance short just by stylistically and he's way bigger like way bigger you know yeah it's a tough one uh because yeah it's gonna go like if we talk about their hands it's gonna go like like chance and todd
SPEAKER_04: And as Ray said, Chance was good enough to take Todd, so he will take Zurab's wrist, you would have to assume. Then how much side pressure? We know from Zurab against Ron and from Zurab against John that he's got a bucket load of it. Does Chance have the ability to finish? Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_03: I don't know. I don't know. That's the real question. You know, because Zurab can stay there and he can pull his ass off. He lost the hand and he still pulled him back. So for Chen Xiao, the finishing part would be the one that you really need to focus on right now. I haven't seen him transition to a press over the top of a wrist yet. It's still coming. I don't know. I got Zurab. If Zurab beats him...
SPEAKER_00: Like, because he had problem with touchings, but not to take his wrist. He had problem with touchings to control touch pronator. He couldn't really, like, whenever he does this, he was taking, but he was missing pronator. And whenever he wanted to control pronator, then he was going inside. He couldn't do both at the same time. But with Zurab, I'm not sure if Zurab has the same pronator triangle
SPEAKER_00: Tatachins because we saw Todd when he beat Irakli even he lost his wrist he was pressing and we I saw at the point one of the matches Irakli even lost his wrist a little bit so what I'm just trying to say that Tatachins has strong pronators and he's not really giving up he's not really giving like like Zurab does so whenever Zurab jumps chance to have chance to
SPEAKER_00: control his tornado totally remember the guy uh when john tried to hook chance round one yeah go flattened yeah yeah he just jumped and he just lost of course john was just coming back you know now it could be different i don't know but i think that like it is not that easy to
SPEAKER_00: uh it'd be chance by hooking him but again i agree with the way that you know i think chance will have the position but will he be able to finish because round five when we saw john versus it was not easy john to finish you guys remember right yeah yeah you don't have to climb up climb up and finish with the shoulder press i don't know
SPEAKER_03: if chance can do similar things yeah i i think it's i think it it should be a really good match and it can end three two and it can end three zero pretty much both sides it might like zoro can catch him all the time and just pull him back you know or chance can just get on and finish him straight away i think both every everything of that is in a realm of possibility and if chance loses he has to drop down to 90 kilos
SPEAKER_04: Why we, we said we will have a match like three years ago. So when I, when I beat, when I beat chance, he was telling me he was trying to get a middleweight WAL call up and he was on the way down and he, and he did the exact opposite. I think he's now like less than 130 kilos. As far as I know. Hmm. Slim chance show. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know. Let's see. I think it will be a very good match. And I want to say that Zurab is doing an incredible job. Can you imagine in one year, he will be pulling Rambat, John Brzenk, Chen Xiao, and Rob Vision Jr. Like, this guy is just a warrior. Zurab is a warrior. Incredible job. Anyway, so
SPEAKER_00: How about, how about, by the way, when people may wonder how happened between, what's the result between Egle and Sara? Egle beat Sara 5-0 and all matches were quick matches. And so we talked about Sandris versus Loughlin. That is very interesting.
SPEAKER_04: There we go. Almost as juicy as your opening match. Almost. I don't like Sandris. I don't like Sandris. I don't like him. You don't like him? Hey, I don't like Sandris either. Why? I'm kidding. I love Sandris. No, I don't like him. I don't like him. I don't like him at all. I won't welcome to smash him.
SPEAKER_04: sundry's likes to speak his mind without caring what people think you know he's just that type of yeah yeah yeah yeah he goes all mode all the time what's that yeah i said yeah he goes all mode all the time did he just call sundry's yeah i said he goes mode engine there's a difference i haven't gone as far as calling myself yet but he goes mode
SPEAKER_04: I found that he said that after he beats Lachlan three zero and then he will also kick your ass. At the table, I'd actually like to. I'd like to group up with Sandris afterwards. We can we can sort out a few of the issues we got. We will. We will all meet in Iron House. You know that I see there. Oh, OK. OK, we've got plenty of time for that. Very good. I think it's a good match again.
SPEAKER_04: Obviously, Sandris has the runs on the board. He's the EAF champ. Is he WAF champ as well, Ray? No, no, no. He's Vice champ. Okay. So he's got the runs on the board. And Lachlan clearly is looking for the runs on the board. Sandris is one of those guys that it's a great opportunity for Lachlan to establish his level in the eyes of the armwrestling world.
SPEAKER_04: Sandris will likely be looking to the top roll. Take Lachlan's wrist. Lachlan's got a very strong back pressure and fingers. I see them slipping. I slim go into straps. I see Lachlan. Uh, the match will come down to where a stop happens. If a stop happens with wrist flat or slightly back, I think Lachlan's in trouble.
SPEAKER_04: If the stop happens and there's a slight kink or a bit of supination in Lachlan's wrist, I think Sandris is in trouble. I don't think Sandris wants to go anywhere near Lachlan's inside game. I think it's a good match. I think it could go either way.
SPEAKER_03: I think he has all the options to win. His hook isn't the best one, but he still can grind it out. He's very super technical, like really technical for...
SPEAKER_03: uh what we would call heavyweight here in latvia like is ridiculous so and if i look at lachlan's matches he will sometimes stay in positions where an arm muscle with ability and technical prowess can take care of that so if anything like that happens i believe saunders can win from that
SPEAKER_03: i i hope it's a good match i love lachlan i love them both and uh i think it's i hope it's a good match but i think saunders has way more options to win and i think he will win it eventually it can be uh the scores can be different and we'll see like this is in my opinion for me this is the real coming out party for lachlan you know he was he lost a ton he kind of understood and he's been doing really good afterwards
SPEAKER_03: now you have like another world level but from different side opponent in the 110 kilo class sanders so we will see where you know how much he can or how good he can do against him so um don't you guys think that east versus west is like
SPEAKER_00: good opportunity to realize athletes from different parts of the world you know where they are their levels while bringing them together we understand more right instead of just all the time guessing
SPEAKER_03: guy would be this guy this guy would be that guy you know but now we are actually seeing you know where they are if it's contestant like if the guys are actually arm wrestling then yes but if the one guy just murders the other guy that guy could be ranked in the same class number 20 or 10 or five you don't know so always like the match is like give me more information is the ones where there are some actual fighting you know going around
SPEAKER_00: They're like, okay, but listen, without setting these matches, we will never know. Oh, yeah, yeah. I know. I agree with that. I agree with that. I have seen some super matches that on the poll, one guy was heavily favorite, but the result was different way. Like, just go to my community page, scroll down and look at Derek Smith versus Artem Morozov match. Or just look at, like, Michael Todd versus Genadi match. You know, I mean,
SPEAKER_00: Guy Coward- It is like we may be taking something, but the results, sometimes maybe different so that's it's good that instead of we talking talking talking, then it's better to set this matches and see where people actually are. Guy Coward- There is a super chat on we've been we've been we've been that's what we've been longing for in Australia, we have had such a hard time getting that so yeah we can't wait and we agree. very much.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, there is a super chat. Honest critic says, Ryan, why don't you smile more often? Ray smiles. I can't compete with Ray in that regard. Like I said, he's the best looking junior arm wrestler in the world. What am I meant to do? The beard is wearing off and I can't smile all the time. Sandris is in the chat.
SPEAKER_00: and he sent you this kiss yeah a kiss he says i love you ryan and he sent you a kiss it is and then i i wrote back to him in the chat said first beers on me and then yeah you answered him already first beer on me are we are we gonna hey we're gonna talk about the real subject here ryan's drinking problem should we address that problem we will solve that problem i will i will i will gather you know like money collect money from the people yeah for this
SPEAKER_00: I go red. I go even redder when I drink. You look like my shirt. Yeah, if I drink the wrong beer. So you are saying that Australia is going to win 2-0 and races, Latvia is going to win 2-0.
SPEAKER_04: It seems the battle lines are drawn. Could you expect anything else though, Engen? Yeah. Imagine one of us comes in, we're like, most likely our side's just got to get decimated. We got to lose. Everyone's like, no need to tune in. End of the day, we're all human. We've got the same sort of capabilities. Although I'm facing a midget.
SPEAKER_04: It's a little bit different. Why did you get to go there again? Ryan, come on. Can you set the record straight for me? What is your actual height? Because I don't know. 5'7". I've said everything from 5'0 to 5'3". He called you 5'2", 5'2", on his video. Yeah, I said 5'1", 5'2". He said 5'0". What are you? 5'7". Same height as my wife. It's 170 centimeters, but I say it's 169.
SPEAKER_03: oh yeah so ryan you want to hear like my first do you know um i was right i was writing to this song but uh do you know eminem's kill shot none of the top of my head if i heard it i'm sure i'd know it okay okay the first two lines were like this lachlan just hit me on a text last night he left notes on my desk
SPEAKER_00: Keep that going, Ray. Don't give up. We've got faith in you. I want to hear that properly released. I'll try. I'll try my best. I'll try my best. With a solid beat. So the results of these two matches will prove that either Australia is better at arm wrestling than Latvia or Latvia is better at arm wrestling than Australia.
SPEAKER_03: This is a pretty legit Australia V Latvia moment. I'm really sorry. Ryan, you want to hear more? I have more. Actually, yes, yes, please go. Okay. So you got me pinned down, but you're weak. I say I pull you back every day of the week. My reply, get your elbow yelling who? So before it dies, let's see who can outpress who with your shitty form. Oh, Ray, ooh, but you look 45 and I'm still outwrestling you.
SPEAKER_04: pretty good. I think some rhymes are pretty good. You know, yeah, look, look, you can you can you can get away with a few kind of not really working out. I know. I know. I know. Just put that to a bait and release that shit. They're asking, right? No, right. They're asking you, will you use riser? No, no, I use I use riser only on my left arm. Okay, because you go. Yeah, I understand. Yeah. Um,
SPEAKER_03: Hutchings versus Evgeny Prudnik. 50-50. 50-50. I'll say 50-50. I think it's a good match. And it's 107 kilo weight limit, so it will be tough for both of them. So I think it's, well, tougher for Evgeny because Evgeny's been bigger. Last time he was 110, yeah? In the last event, he was 108 kilo. Okay, then, yep.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but one before, he was 110, I think, or 112 when he beat Morozov. Yeah, this Prudnik that I saw last time, you know, he's just, you know, he's living in Belgium now. That wasn't super Prudnik I have seen, so...
SPEAKER_03: i'm afraid that super prudnik cannot get that big he has to be smaller and so most likely we'll not see the super super prudnik but uh you know i and i think that hutchings has good chances but i think there's more options for prudnik to win like way more if he chooses to top roll he will top roll and i'll give slide i'll not slide but i'll give 70 30 to prudnik for that one so more more your real opinion is coming out
SPEAKER_04: And you? Ask him who's favorite again at the end. I think Prudnik's the favorite. He should be the favorite. I remember watching them in Moldova. It was really significantly one-way traffic on that day. Yeah, but... All that said... Ryan, Ryan, one second.
SPEAKER_04: David Hutchings have some tough matches before he met Prudnik? He'd pulled Sasho and Krasimir. Krasimir and Sasho, some hook matches, right? Yeah, he had a few starts with Sasho. Evgeny though he was dominant, he had to do it three or four times or something. I just can't take that out of my mind when I think about these guys. I think Prudnik has the right combination of
SPEAKER_04: control strength and speed uh and he can he can he can ex half expose todd's wrist and then just go sideways before todd can find the traction of the stop if if the match stops in the straps i've got todd absolutely does it depend on the position does it depend on the position or
SPEAKER_04: it doesn't matter like even even almost yeah it does if the wrist is back you've getting will you've getting will masterfully just get over it and then close it down with a press but if it's if it's if it's if it's not fully there if it's only halfway there then i think todd will grind it out uh i think todd in 90 of stopped moments in the strap total win it but it's getting it to that stop is the biggest challenge i feel
SPEAKER_00: I understand. Jeremy, thank you for your support, my friend. Thank you. Jeremy, again, thank you, my friend. Thank you. You are generous. Okay, so Derek versus Revaz. Revaz. I don't even understand this match. I'll be honest. I don't understand this match. I don't. I will ask you something.
SPEAKER_00: ray before i said derek versus morozov he beat tim bresnan very convincingly and people were thinking to set derek versus dave chaffee you remember he's gonna be in june and this and that i wasn't one of those people yeah yeah but i'm just saying that he beat bresnan like very comfortably and
SPEAKER_00: He came to Istanbul with less than 20 days notice, probably. He spent the last 10 days resting. So he came with 10 days of training, probably. I mean, I'm sure he was training, but not specifically for an opponent while Morozov was ready for the Istanbul event. So my doubt is about this. Whenever Revaz tried to top roll,
SPEAKER_00: Michael told in round one, it was just like so easy for Michael to hold it at the center. He even hold Revaz's easier than the way that he controlled Tatashin's. I say like Tatashin, because Tat is like 100 kilo guy. And so the way that Revaz beat Michael was with the shoulder pressure. So what if,
SPEAKER_00: Revaz tried to go outside and get stopped by Derek. Or what if Derek quickly hooks Revaz? Whenever I checked the training with Genadi and Revaz, Genadi was trying to top roll Revaz and Revaz was beating him. Whenever Genadi was hooking him, he was beating him very easily. And since
SPEAKER_00: Derek is a very tall guy, he can have a good reach. You see that it's like impossible, like the truth is, if Revaz was really 40%, as he was saying in May, and now last time I talked with him, he said he is 60% now. So then, I mean, of course we will see different Revaz, but I think that we will see different Derek as well. So you are saying that it's clearly mismatch.
SPEAKER_03: I absolutely believe like, so you, you know, Revaz, you have seen Revaz. Revaz has been in some finals in Moth Worlds, you know?
SPEAKER_00: I don't think he reached the final. Okay, he left, he had one war, he has stopped guys, he's been, you know... No, no, he won Europeans, probably he may even won Waffles. But if you are talking about the time that he pulled with Levan, he was not able to reach the final because he got tired. They got too tired, yeah, yeah. But still, you know, there's been...
SPEAKER_03: my opinion clear consistency of him being very near that top beating michael todd is no easy job and it's most most of the time you need more than one talent uh i just i just for me i would love to see derek pull someone
SPEAKER_03: that we would consider weaker. So we can understand where Derek actually is. Like Derek beat Tim, then he got destroyed by Morozov. And after that match, like I even don't know where Morozov is, you know, because I don't know where Derek is. So for me, it's just like that. It kind of doesn't make sense. And I looked at that match. I'm like, just stylistically, you know, there's, I would, if Mike and Derek would have a match, Mike would win it.
SPEAKER_00: There's, I'm positive, you know, that I will say 99% sure that Mike would win it. And I don't know, Ryan. Yeah, but they're different styles. You know, whenever Rivas tried to do his best move on round one, he couldn't do anything to Michael. If he would continue that way, it would be a total domination for Michael, 3-0. The way that he beat was this. So can he do the same thing to Derek as well that way? Or can he top roll? Because he's...
SPEAKER_03: top row is his best move but he didn't work against michael well there okay there's there's could have been reasons like guy hasn't been arm wrestling for quite some time he's uh been out now he just had this experience i i ranked rivers very highly i don't know he's top 10 so some people will want him to be or say i don't know but
SPEAKER_03: I don't think Derek is there. I think in my opinion, like if I was Derek's manager, I wouldn't take that match. I would give him something different and work on it and we'll see where you are because
SPEAKER_04: don't know it's definitely it's a shot in the dark because we don't know yeah yeah it is and it it could land it could miss badly if it misses badly if it lands cool uh or if it's a close enough match but then we get a gauge um of where levels are at uh i i hear your points engen and i do agree on i do agree on
SPEAKER_04: I do agree that Rivas might necessarily have an easy day taking control of center. I hope Derek turns up motivated and ready. He didn't seem like he was last time. He seemed like he was kind of intimidated by the situation. So hopefully the aggressive Derek turns up. I feel like that. I feel like the version that we saw against Morozov was definitely an underrated or just not the full Derek Smith. So if the full Derek Smith turns up,
SPEAKER_00: I think that he could be a, he can make it a, make it a match. Uh, if the hesitant Derek turns up, it'll be horrible. That, that, that interesting part that whenever I saw the training video with, uh, Genadi and Revaz before, before Revaz match with Michael Tote, whenever Genadi was trying to top roll Revaz, Revaz was killing him. And whenever, no, no, let me finish. Let me finish. When Genadi was going inside and he was beating him easy.
SPEAKER_00: The interesting part that Genadi actually top rolled Michael. Actually top rolled Michael and beat him. And whenever Rewazm was trying to top roll Michael, he couldn't. But people are saying that he couldn't move Michael because he was 40%. But how was he top rolling Genadi during the practice whenever Genadi was trying to go out, he couldn't do anything to him. So I am just thinking that Michael probably
SPEAKER_00: got better with his riser and everything, you know, after his match with Genadi, that is how it seemed with those training matches as well. But the last match when I saw him against Tatashins, with his own move, open arm topple, he did not look so great against Tatashins. His shoulder pressure was the one that actually saved that match. So that is what I try to say, that styles make matches.
SPEAKER_00: Different days, different, whenever Derek versus Morozov, there was a poll, 70 or 80% of people said that Derek was going to beat Morozov. So anything can happen. I kind of see that there is a possibility that, I'm not saying that Derek is going to win, but there is a possibility that he may hook him, hook Ravas, maybe, who knows. Anything can happen. Yeah, I look forward to it.
SPEAKER_00: i don't think so i think so what did we not what did we not cover um uh bojidar versus samusha interesting match people people don't understand for me bojidar versus samusha is the level of tatashins versus uh rudny for their weight category
SPEAKER_03: so uh if you look at bojadar bojadar has improved i think a lot especially in his uh his abilities on you know finishing matches and i feel like uh samushia is a good armor so he will have to cut down weight i don't think bojadar has to cut down weight that much that what is the weight limit 80
SPEAKER_03: 85 85 okay so they're gonna meet at 85. samusha was 87 when he pulled uh pauline samushi is one of the one of the
SPEAKER_03: Toughest arm wrestlers, you know. But again, he's been out for quite some time. And ring rust is a real thing. We might get some different, better version of Samushia because he had like some... He's run on WF and EAF sometimes. He's been like just crazy, ridiculously good. I would still pick Bozhidar as a slight favorite because anything can happen in a hook. And most likely, it's going to end up in a hook.
SPEAKER_04: and obviously that brian the only match of david's that i'm that i have in my mind is the one against paul lynn uh he looked i've seen plenty of bojita david looked really solid in center table integrity once that hook was driven in and locked in but
SPEAKER_04: From what I know of Bojadar, that's his domain as well. And he seems to have almost an undying ability to just stay there and wait it out. I feel like, again, I'm guessing, but I feel like the pressure is going to be on David to finish the rounds. And Bojadar will be looking to just lock it out and hold it and make it a long battle.
SPEAKER_04: I don't know who's going to win. I don't know if they've even faced each other before. But I think anytime when you've got the best of the best in a weight category, particularly with a style where they're just coming straight at each other, it's fascinating. It probably could potentially be like one of just the longest matches physically with both guys going through exhaustion. Awesome match. I don't know who. Again, I don't know who to call. Yeah, these people, maybe some people maybe underestimated Samushia.
SPEAKER_00: But Samushia on the competition day was around 30 pounds, maybe more lighter than Pauline. And Pauline is the person that could be run bad convincing him after round one. And he gave big trouble to John. And people think that John beat him easy, but that hook matches. I mean, no way. No way. Yeah, that was amazing. Yeah, Pauline was incredible. And John,
SPEAKER_00: even got some little uh problem you know with his arm and he said that his wrist up to this day still hurts i think it's round one he's talking about and he had some uh small pronator problem you remember his arm get all reddish and so i think that samusha bojidar pauline these guys are very very strong guys you know especially around that weight category 85 kilo 90 kilo 80 kilo incredibly strong guys yeah i mean you can't find any
SPEAKER_00: stronger human beings around those, those, uh, weight. And we have Yusuf, uh, right. You, you follow the last 65 kilo world championships where Yusuf won. There was a third place Kazakh guy. He actually beat the second place Russian guy that, that all, uh, what was his name? I forgot.
SPEAKER_00: He beat Cherkasov with the Russian nations, this guy. Okay, yeah, yeah, I know. You know the young guy, yeah, yeah. And this guy, Egor, Egor, Egor something, Egor, I forget, Farmyev, Egor Farmyev, yeah. This guy took second place to Yusuf. But they also pull in the 21 years category with the Kazakh guy, Yerdaulet Sarybay.
SPEAKER_00: And then Yardole beat him in the 21 years old category. But when they come to the senior category, he wanted to sleep. And they said it was intentional sleep. They gave him a foul. And I think that's how Egor won. And Yusuf beat Egor twice in the, not twice, but he beat him one in qualification, one in the final. But the third place guy is going inside. He was stronger than Egor in hook. So this,
SPEAKER_00: This is the last minute match that I said between Yusuf and Yardolet Sarybay. And you remember Yardolet is the one that screamed to the referee and they disqualified him. Do you remember? Yeah, yeah, yeah. And so how do you see that match since they both go inside? Yusuf is a killer. Yusuf is a... He's ridiculously good. I keep getting amazed by him. I think it's Yusuf. It's...
SPEAKER_03: know he's some like he's the guy that they bring down the only thing is that they didn't meet each other at work yeah yeah i think it's yusuf yeah i think it's just i i would i would put money down on you so that's what i would say yeah i understand i understand good against you probably don't know that question sorry you probably don't know those guys right yeah correct i i would yeah that yeah
SPEAKER_00: And, and did we, did we miss any match? I don't want to, because we remember all of them. Oh, wow. Wow. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, is one of the icons of the sport.
SPEAKER_04: Uh, he's, I mean, he's, he's a very likable guy, uh, given all the hardship that he's been through. So he's, his story is amazing with the road to recovery. Uh, he was already, I think prior to, uh, if we go back to 2018, he was right there at the very pointy end of the overall ranks of the left arm. He was, he was beating, he was beating Pushkar at Moldova and, uh,
SPEAKER_04: He was beating Vitaly Laletin as well. And I think it was only Denis Saplenkov that he couldn't beat. So he was at that level where he was almost the all-time great. He's certainly the pound-for-pound great. Since the accident and then his recovery,
SPEAKER_04: He's slowly but surely ticked the boxes again, winning an 80-kilo title at WAF. He's done that again now. So he's building back, but he still doesn't look what he was, but he's building back. And so it's a great story. I think David is a beast at the same time, so it is a big step up.
SPEAKER_04: Um, but I ha I have to feel like, like, I mean, I'm cheering for Oleg massively here. I hope he wins. Cause I think the story is awesome. Um, but I think it's, I think it's a red line that it's going to be, it is a hard match for Oleg to win. Um, but look, yeah, we'll see if, is he back busy or is he, is he still going? I don't know. Oleg for the win. And you?
SPEAKER_00: right uh that again i i think it's that again is favorite in this one for me i i gotta run i have to do my last training session today is the last hard training session wait just two minutes two minutes left and we're finishing i will just tell you ryan uh like the time that like for example we push car at the moldo event like only a month later clement dimitro who is only 85 kilo
SPEAKER_00: gave 20 seconds long match to Oleg Zhokh. He even took Oleg's wrist a little bit, you know. Yeah, so what I'm just saying is that the key to beat Oleg, I don't think it's about the power. I think that you need to have power, but using the, like, in the right direction. In 2015, I beat Mazgan Shamiev at the Waffles in Malaysia. I flashed him. I took first. He took fourth behind me.
SPEAKER_00: Roozbeh Gharakhloo, Only only five weeks later, he went to look at your he flashed on exhaust there at 78 kilo category he flashed him and then he had a long match with the Lithuanian guy what was name Ray. Roozbeh Gharakhloo, You know, with the big biceps.
SPEAKER_00: around 80 kilo guy ah um asmonis mantis asmonis yeah and asmonas because he's going inside a incredible bicep and mazgan had like one minute and ten ten seconds match and then mazgan with that tired he came to the final and he still gave 20 seconds of match to alex jokin strap you know after one minute ten second match so zog is incredible
SPEAKER_00: probably not probably the pound for pound the best best uh ever but there has been times that even in his own weight category he had some uh trouble not that he didn't win but he had some trouble as well yeah so thank you uh guys thank you very much it took long with with when we find ryan drunk
SPEAKER_00: then I mean, it's just impossible not to, I mean, have a long one, I mean, short one. So he likes to, I mean, he gave out everything and I really enjoyed it, seriously. Same one that I enjoyed when John came to do live, you know, when he's drinking. Not because I enjoy them drinking, I don't drink, I'm also against drinking, but...
SPEAKER_00: they, they, they, they are like more comfortable about expressing their thoughts, you know? Yeah. And, and go train, go train and kick Ryan's ass. That's right. Yeah. He's the favorite. He's the favorite. Look at, look at the last word that I want to say again, for all those people who are trying to work out who's going to win is simply look at our heads.
SPEAKER_00: That's all that matters. John Brzenk has the biggest head in the world. Measure that man's head. It's like what? His head is changing. I saw him in Istanbul when he was put Zola. His head was under 30. Put on his hat. He was a little bit bigger than me. And then I went to Norway and then I saw someone with a hat like this. I don't know how he's... Yeah, anyway. His head is not looking like... I'm kind of thinking that John is not human.
SPEAKER_00: no he's not different you know no he's yeah i mean yeah i'm thinking that he's not you know like i'm seriously thinking i mean even if he's human there is something different with that guy yeah for sure can you give me one get up get up
SPEAKER_02: Okay, I gotta go. Thanks everyone for joining. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much today. Thank you. Right. Yes. Very soon.
