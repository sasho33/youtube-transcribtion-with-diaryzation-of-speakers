SPEAKER_01: How are you hanging? What are you doing? How are you feeling? You said you were busy or something. You're not feeling good. You're feeling good. What's going on? No, it's fine. I just slept late and woke up late. So that's how it is. Hello. Hello to New Zealand. Hello, guys. Hello, Jonathan, Irfan, Richard, Aris, Sasquatch. I don't know how to.
SPEAKER_01: Boston. Yeah, I mean, this the last one week to meet the guys. I think the first one, first ones that come in Krasimir and Bozidar, they are coming too. Hello, Ozil. How are you? Hello, mate. Hello. Sorry, I was a little bit, well, I think I'm early, but it says we're already on YouTube.
SPEAKER_01: Yep, we are live, yeah. Oh, beauty. Oh, sorry. Sorry I'm late then. Oh, no. You are not late. You're early, but we are earlier, so it means that we are bigger fans than you are. We just can't wait to meet the fans. Just joking.
SPEAKER_02: i was eager i was putting my little little girl to bed and uh i was you know when you just try it try and rush it because i was like oh i want to get on and have a chat with you guys so uh very honored engen thank you very much for asking me to come on the show and adam it's always it's always good to have a chat with you mate yes sir yeah i thank you for uh both of you for uh being my guest yep this this is what i was saying that um
SPEAKER_01: Two days later, I think Bojidar and Krasimir, they are coming to my city. There will be a seminar for the youth guys from Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey, and a few others. And so they are coming for that first. Fiyar Ayseg coming, Anna coming, Petra coming, also Andrei Kipriano from Romania.
SPEAKER_01: They are all bringing junior students here for a seminar. And then I think Monday often is coming. Your countrymen. Yeah. Well, you got everyone wrong with my. The guys, you see me clearly or am I freezing? You were breaking up just maybe for half a second. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I think we lost you on Who's Coming Monday. Powerful Wi-Fi in the balcony. Yeah, Lachlan, Lachlan. Let me switch to my own internet. That's the last thing we need is streaming problems. Poor guys copped it enough after the whole Wi-Fi the last day versus rest. Hey, you ain't at him.
SPEAKER_00: I've been good. It's funny that Engin's hosting it. I mean, you are clear, but being on Engin's connection, it's cool. Zoom is a beautiful thing. So now I switched to my own internet instead of the Wi-Fi at home. Is it better now? Do you guys have any problem? Yeah, you're smooth, yeah. Okay, yeah. As smooth as Turkish you like.
SPEAKER_01: Anyway, so it will be a tough week next week, tough, tough to organize and tough for the athletes. And so how do you guys see the event?
SPEAKER_02: Mate, it's going to be awesome. When you organised the first one, I thought that's a cool idea that you're able to organise it. And then when it got to East versus West 3, I was like, this is going to be the greatest card in the world. And then you somehow make it better with East versus West 4. And then you've already announced matches for East versus West 5. So I think it just keeps...
SPEAKER_02: getting better and better i i do not know how anyone cannot enjoy this event or any of the the events that you've uh that you've put on the the matches are exciting the event looks cool um and we're able to to get it on pay-per-view so we're able to watch it live man i i can't wait i'm still
SPEAKER_02: trying to figure out um how i can get there and and watch the event because it's just one well i need to be at one of your events in person i think i think it's if you're an arm wrestling fan i think it's unbelievable yeah i also enjoy i mean whenever i organize i also i mean
SPEAKER_01: um enjoy it not not like i don't feel like you know i'm organizing something but i'm like you know like let me enjoy you know that that is how it's uh that is why you know like you can see i saw myself when zurab and john was armless in the round five normally i was waiting at the corner but i came right to the side and then i saw my face that i was like this my eyes you know it was it's just
SPEAKER_01: i really i really enjoy it let's let's see how it will be what what artem what is the match that you are like most curious or matches
SPEAKER_00: okay so i'm looking at this thing right so i'm looking at everything uh the one i'm probably the most personal about is probably ryan and raymond because you know i've pulled both people ask me question every day who do you think who do you think they don't like my answer
SPEAKER_00: so you know i want to see if i'm right or not so it's kind of personal for me at this point but for bigger like in general no no no no no don't go to the next one just tell me tell me your opinion because i didn't hear yet ah well my opinion is uh they're pulling right-handed i'm assuming right uh ryan bowen three zero or four zero whatever the thing uh
SPEAKER_00: I don't think it's probably it could be close, but I'm having Ryan as a clear winner here. I didn't see if for some reason I'm wrong and coach is beating him. Oh, then Ryan has a long way to go. He's up here. He's down here with me.
SPEAKER_02: He's in a lot of trouble. He's in a lot of trouble. If Ryan loses on the weekend, this will be the biggest stitch up I've ever seen. I don't think I'll ever get off the internet for the next 48 hours for everyone really getting stuck into Ryan. They will be coming hammering down and I'll just be reading everything and being on YouTube flat out watching all the videos.
SPEAKER_00: yes like when i lost to coach ray i was like because i i was expecting that yeah i was expecting that right it was like that was personally i was okay with that but there were so many people that were like
SPEAKER_00: betting in me and saying I'm a clear favorite and blah blah blah and blah blah blah that got me mentally very confused so once I lost to him I was like well I need to see it further so once I see him on the after table and nobody was beating him I'm like yeah I was I was right he he is strong I was it was good okay another question for you you said you pulled with Ryan Ryan beat you comfortably
SPEAKER_00: Last time, right-handed, I believe he pulled a little bit of a practice pull, but he felt so rigid. Yeah, right-handed, I don't think I was even close. Left-handed, I'm stronger by a lot. Right-handed, no. He felt like a super to me. Next question. Next question. When you pull with Ryan and when you pull with Ray, your shape was about the same?
SPEAKER_00: no when i pulled with ryan i was i was in a good shape but i was lighter i think and but i was no no no no it was it was like maybe a year apart two years and i've leveled up since then i'm a lot stronger now when i pulled coach ray but i'm assuming and looking at ryan's numbers he has to level up if we leveled up on the same or faster ratio so
SPEAKER_01: This is where I'm at. And Aussie, what is the match or matches that are most interesting to you in this card?
SPEAKER_02: Oh, there's so many. Of course I'm invested in the Ryan Bowen co-trades we've been talking about. I am really eager to see where Lachlan's level is at. So when he's pulling Sandrus, very keen on that match. I want to see if Artem Morozov is entering that top 10 elite level with the right-hand match against Dave Chaffee. True.
SPEAKER_02: I think that's going to be off the charts. All your title matches are unreal. Do you expect Dave to win or Artem to win?
SPEAKER_02: I think Dave's experience and horsepower will do it, but it would not surprise me seeing Morozov at the last East versus West with his power and his high hook and pronation. I was like, oh, wow. And then when he flexed at the camera and the muscles just kept growing, the guy's in phenomenal shape. I think the experience of Dave,
SPEAKER_01: will get him over the line but i would not be surprised if adam morozov can uh can definitely beat dave chafee there is a question uh in terms of do you agree with crossy that slave is the only one that might be levan um i don't think so i don't think slave's wrist will handle when he does his back pressure i think he will lose his wrist against the one this is my opinion
SPEAKER_01: I would like to see I would like to see Gasparini pulling, but he needs to get better. But the like, bad thing about this that two days ago, Levan was my guest and I asked him, is this the best Levan Misov? He said no. That is a problem. He reckons he can get better and stronger.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, wow. Then, yeah, then goodbye to the super heavyweight division. I mean, if this is the case, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: yeah if levan could get first of all how how when i saw him at top eight i didn't think he could get any bigger and then when i saw him at king of the table i i don't know how his body is able to get bigger but the guy is just expanding and the the brute strength whether it's his lifts in the gym or uh the first two rounds how easy he took devon if he can get stronger then yeah
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, that'll do. Let's work out who number two in the world is, because that will be the new number one, because Levan's just on a, he's on a different level. Yeah. And Artem, do you think that, like, when we have Ongarbaev, John, Rudnik, and Tatachins, like, when we talk about those athletes,
SPEAKER_01: of course in the same event we have krasimir we have iraqli and we have some other guys as well uh like do you think that are we are talking about the very best of that category when we talk about these guys ah well yeah yeah you got you got all those names of the guys that will compete oh i need something my bad
SPEAKER_00: Knocking your cords, Adam. My bad. My bad. I'm very unprofessional. Can you still hear me?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah. Oh, cool. Okay, perfect. So, yes, 100%. Because all of those guys either were part of top eight already, like winners of everything, right? So they're definitely top of, you know, as far as you know, that part of the world goes, they are definitely top of the whole food chain. And as far as our side of the world goes, yeah, I mean,
SPEAKER_00: Nobody's really big in Todd Hutchings at his weight, right-handed, neither is the same as John. And yeah, yeah, you pretty much have top guys. I really, with that being said, actually, too, Corey Miller versus Daniel, that's also, that's a very interesting match. Because in America, if you probably were trying to pick up matches,
SPEAKER_00: we don't have that many through lightweights that you control with them right our lightweights are like you know 90 kilos that cut to 70 kilos so it's kind of hard to find that true lightweight and you have corey for that right and it's kind of fun to see that he's our top lightweight like truly because he's truly lightweight uh and he can go and compete versus somebody else and see where it's at i think that's also a very good one in that state
SPEAKER_01: will be it'll be cool to see sam harris but i don't think he's been active he hasn't been active so how do you how do you see how do you see daniel versus uh corey
SPEAKER_00: i have no idea i have no idea i want to see that i want to see like if he destroys if danielle destroys corey i mean that's just kind of that just kind of sad day if corey stops which i mean corey did a lot better with yanni's than what i thought so it can go pretty good uh that's and that's right-handed right as a left-handed because i'm wrong
SPEAKER_00: yeah yeah okay perfect then perfect yes then i think it can go pretty good and if it goes good for corey and he wins that which i mean he might and it's a good day for north america right then uh if then it makes corey a lot more interesting our master all everywhere especially in america too now people can actually hunt him and he can have a good international stack i think so
SPEAKER_02: I love you, buddy. I love you. But I think that's the biggest mismatch on the card. Is it? I think. Yeah, it could be wrong. I've been wrong in the past. But I think Popacek is the overwhelming favorite. And I think no disrespect to the flash, Corey Miller. I love the way he goes about it. But I, yeah, I think he'll win quite comfortably. I've got him down for 3-0 easy money.
SPEAKER_01: do you do you do you think that do you think that when you say quite comfortably like do you think that daniel will be the one that will start the match yeah yeah daniel will win yeah do you think that do you think that daniel will be the one that who does the first move
SPEAKER_02: No, he'll stop with an outside top roll. So, Corey, we all know how quick Corey is. So, if Corey does the hit, it won't go too far off centre because I just think that defensive top roll and the way Daniel can just hold there and just lean it back to his side of the table, I don't think it'll go too far onto Daniel's side of the table. He won't be doing too much defensive, in my opinion.
SPEAKER_02: So, you are saying that Daniel will stop his hit and then will dominate him right away? Yeah, I think he will. From what I've seen and the way the match is, I was very impressed with Corey Miller against Giannis, but Giannis pulls a lot differently. So, and yeah, Giannis doesn't mind holding in a defensive position.
SPEAKER_02: trying to go across the table and and play the game and janice wanted to show everyone all of his range where i feel daniel's just no nonsense and he just wants to you know he's on a global stage once again it's the first time on your card um i think he'll be out to impress impress you engen and impress everyone watching so i think it'll just be no nonsense straight down the middle i i i i kind of see daniel favorite but i i don't see
SPEAKER_01: that kind of domination, as you talk, especially in early rounds. I kind of believe that when the match starts, I think that Corey is going to hit, and I am guessing that he's going to put him to a bad position first, first, first round. This is my opinion. He may still win from there, but I don't think that he will be like ready, go boom and boom like this. I don't see that first round.
SPEAKER_01: I have seen this guy pulling with John. I don't know if you have seen it. Have you seen? You didn't see Corey Miller with John? I mean, just look at that video and then you may change your mind. I'm not saying that Corey is going to win, but that will not be that domination in my opinion. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: But you have seen, right, Artem, Corey, and John? Yeah, yeah, I might know what you're talking about for sure. I became a believer of Corey after seeing him versus Giannis and kind of like, you know, following him from that point. And yeah, I mean, his style and the way he goes, he definitely wins first round, I believe. And then it goes from there.
SPEAKER_00: like he is just doing it because he does have that uh initial start he has the good impulse on the go and uh
SPEAKER_00: and his style is kind of uh it's kind of awkward to where like it might is it'll take you a second to readjust if you can adjust that's the thing because that kind of uh it's so you know not very traditional not the whole not fully european top role to where like you go and you pronate and you cop or where you hook and you supinate it's very natural flat hand you know just like yeah
SPEAKER_01: yeah but so it's kind of like you have to defend it properly and not that many people seems to get it right away yeah somebody wrote that daniel also pulled with john you're talking about like john even before his comeback when he john came back in july end of july
SPEAKER_01: this what you are talking about earlier early june before jones come back and he was training pool which we are talking about is uh a competition real competition um so that's the difference i'm not saying that i'm not saying that corey is gonna win but the round one i really don't think that will be that easy if it will be that easy then it will be interesting that will be interesting especially the
SPEAKER_02: First starts, I would like to see, you know. Yeah, I agree. Yeah. And I love that there's lightweights on the card because we're so focused on the super heavyweights. We're always talking about the super heavyweights. So, including the title match, I was excited that this match was announced because, yeah, sometimes the lightweight pullers have some of the best matches, but they get overlooked.
SPEAKER_01: what do you guys think about oleg zog and uh losing weight from 115 kilo to 102 kilo because uh zoc is about 85 kilo so we thought that 115 kilo is too much and then we i talked with both sides talk talk talk and finally i promised both of them to meet at 102 kilo okay
SPEAKER_00: yeah that's that's what i was about to say because if we're talking about first rounds that's another first round match i would like to see to kind of to see how it goes because you know i think to beat oleg right you either you know if you are a lot bigger than him it's one thing
SPEAKER_00: If you're kind of about the same strength, same size or maybe a bit smaller or whatever, you know, he seems to you can flash him and you can curl him inside. And David does have that, right? He's a and he's actually a bigger dude, too. So he's big. He has that insane supination inside here and he's very explosive. It's a lot of explosion on the go.
SPEAKER_00: So, you know, if Oleg can stop it, I mean, then it's over. But David has the tools, everything to actually do what, you know, to defeat Oleg, if you were to probably write a plan how to beat Oleg probably, right? So I'm excited. I don't know. I don't know what to say here, but I want to see that. Yeah, I mean, I mean,
SPEAKER_01: david is not david that again um he's not that that big super heavyweight uh yeah he's not yeah probably maximum what maximum six foot six feet yeah well isn't he's like top 895 guy so he's that he's a little bit under 100 kilo good dude like he's not he can be a light heavyweight shaped guy you know and
SPEAKER_01: yeah not that tall to have like you know long reach to go around uh olex uh pronator like like how matushenko goes matushenko very tall guy and he goes right right yeah but you know we see that dadikian is more more like like wrist control guy he's using his his wrist strength so that may not be that easy to control uh
SPEAKER_01: olex pronator you know just just only with yeah it could be very susceptible to top role i see what you're saying yeah i mean his wrist alone if he had some tricep pressure or some just forward moving just going around you know then go around to break out flexion i don't i don't know how how strong his wrist i'm sure he's very strong or he can go outside i don't know about that
SPEAKER_01: um i don't know i don't see an easy match for either side because i saw in a training video when laletin top rolled uh that he can but still couldn't finish him you know he was just holding like this so i am expected but will he be the same when he goes down to 102 kilo from 115 down to 102 kilo will he be the same guy
SPEAKER_02: And so I don't know, soon we will find out. How do you see Aussie this match? Oh, I love it. I mean, first of all, how good is it that you've been able to get Oleg back on the table? I mean, everyone knows about that, you know, horrific accident. So last days versus West, I was just enjoying watching him live for the first time. Is the fairy tale true story going to come true?
SPEAKER_02: No, I don't think so. I think David Dada Khan is just too strong. Too strong in the elbow, and I think he'll be able to keep it connected on his side of the table. I think he'll be able to pull Oleg. Oleg likes to lean down and come right over. I think David Dada Khan will be able to stop it. I don't think...
SPEAKER_02: Oleg is at 100% strength. If Oleg was at 100% strength, I think the five-arm takes it. I think, yeah, Oleg wins. But I just, well, I'm only going off the last East versus West. I just feel that Dada Khan will keep it on. He'll keep himself connected. And that will keep him in the match. So whether it's through the elbow...
SPEAKER_02: i think it'll be a hard match absolutely absolutely because you know probably every round like he was saying before and he's probably going to lose his hand so to be able to come across and you through the through the elbow that's that that's hard work in in any sort of match question artem to you and to you jack um have you guys ever seen uh oleg losing with the deadrest
SPEAKER_00: Like somebody pressing him with the dead wrist, like losing the wrist and still beating him. I kind of don't remember such. No, I think people curl him in like when that small Kazakhstan guy beat him at Zloty, right? It still was. It was. It was Mazgan Shamiev. Yeah, yeah, yes, yes. But he curled in. Yeah, he didn't really got into. I is did Devon did Devon curled him in?
SPEAKER_00: was just like this like flat yeah yeah yeah yeah well i guess you know you know i guess it's uh oleg's arm build like you know if you ever been to the flop position i think a lot of that really depends on the strap position too and the opponent i think it may be too hard to be under oleg because of the size of his arm i think he covered you so much
SPEAKER_01: to really once he has the wrist flexion yeah and here gets even much bigger you you you can't really hold anything anymore it might even be a lot harder yeah you have to ask jerry yeah yeah but not lifetime yeah that that that is interesting match yeah very interesting people people um like most of the fans are focused on the
SPEAKER_01: names that are very very famous but there are some other great matches like i don't know artem if you are following closely uh since you are originally from russia right yes yes yeah but so but you have been following of europeans closely or no
SPEAKER_00: not anymore after a certain point i kind of stopped like i was like you know what but you were you know bojidar and yes yes i'm still like yes yes i follow i'm you know i'm still you know i'm i'm kind of half there like if i know i know i follow i am definitely those names been popping up so much over here so it's kind of i think it's easy to know those two right so
SPEAKER_00: for sure i was thinking about this much i mean david is a guy that just pulled paul right and the portion are just been pulling and being everybody so it's kind of you know you've seen both of them so that's a good match and uh the great match i'm assuming they compete in slightly different classes like it was no no no same weight classes in 2019 europeans bojidar won
SPEAKER_01: And Samusha, in the qualification, I've seen him losing to Viorel Dobrin. Dobrin uproar him. But there, I think he took fifth place or something, Samusha. But then the World Championship, Samusha won. Bojidar took second place. Interesting. I don't know if you know Hamza. There is a guy, Hamza Zipak. This guy and Bojidar...
SPEAKER_01: pull each other round one and the match was maybe one and a half minutes. Yeah. Oh, wow. Yeah. Yeah. And then, and then Hamza had a bad Kelly after this much, about 20 seconds, right after he was tired. And then I forgot the name from Kazakhstan that he does open on top. I forgot his name, world champion guy and Hamza pull with him again, another one and a half minutes.
SPEAKER_01: And then Hamza pulled Samusha one minute after all those, like, more than, like, near four-minute matches. And Samusha's matches were quick, you know, Samusha, you know. Right, right, right. And then Hamza lost. And then Bojidar also came from B-side after losing Hamza on round one.
SPEAKER_01: And then he beat Hamza after, again, near one-minute match. And then in the final Samusha beat, Bojidar, it was just like a nightmare there. Nightmare. Ali Can Murado, Viorel Dobrin, Wadi Makbero, Samusha, Hamza. It's just like nightmare. So now, Samusha is coming here as 2019 world champion because there was no WAF in 2020. Right. And Bojidar is coming as the 2021 last world champion.
SPEAKER_01: and georgians couldn't compete because there is a problem with the federation so so this these two are the last world champions of 176 so they are now meeting for the east versus west world title
SPEAKER_00: uh-huh because i was thinking david competed in lighter categories earlier like i think that's why this that now that they make sense they both competed 76. they will be the same way 187 they agreed on 187 but the title will be 176 title uh-huh uh well i mean i who do you have
SPEAKER_02: and i'm going i'm going with i'm going with there's no logic behind it i think just because we've chatted and been on the show i love the way both of these guys uh pull them right there is
SPEAKER_02: It's going to be an absolute firecracker. Cannot wait. Cannot wait. I picture, I kind of picture Engen when they get introduced that you've just rolled a grenade to the middle of the table and you've just turned and waited for it to explode because these two can go. And you're just mentioning all the one minute, the 90 seconds, the two minute matches. These guys can get stuck in the middle of the table and it would not surprise me if they steal the show.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I mean, I would like to ref those matches, but I'm afraid that because I will be enjoying so much that I won't be, you know, catching the fouls. I will be like this, like, there is a foul. Who cares? Just continue.
SPEAKER_02: that will that be your i know you're organizing everything engen but when because now um you're uh relieving you're giving out some extra duty to other people to help you out when the event is running will you sit like on stage and just enjoy the product that you're giving to all of us yeah i mean from one side yes from one side no i mean i would like to i would like to be there
SPEAKER_01: and just watch it as close as possible i will be in the front row you know just sitting but yeah i mean let's see let's see it's his i mean i i remember myself i just can't stop you know when when john was pulling zole around three they went to hook and then john was here and i was like john can you roll out from there he's like let me try and then he went out and he did it you know i shouldn't get involved you know
SPEAKER_01: If you just watch the video, you will see that I'm saying like, John, can you roll out from there? He's like, let me try, you know, during the match. I'm going to definitely check that out because, of course, if you're giving advice, you're clearly saying the right thing. So I'm going to rewatch that match after this. Yeah, you will see, yeah. Just turn the sound, you know, yeah, you will hear, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: yeah that'll be that'll be i don't know do you guys know how to bring it to the screen that match that the round three no right you can't uh can you you can share you can share screen but you have to do it all on your end again oh because i'm the moderator yeah um anyway so um
SPEAKER_01: and that's and that's kind of like top rule versus hook one too right like bojidar and david because david moe is like oh no both both are inside really i was thinking i know left army tuples right arm hooks sometimes tries to hook but he he uh hey just if you are listening to me apologize but you suck with me right on top
SPEAKER_00: doesn't need it he doesn't need it i got you i was just thinking his initial thing was a top role but i figured he can do both so okay the one i'm personally invested in is uh todd hutchings and oh come on you're getting approved early too early you're coming there but let's go
SPEAKER_01: Come on, it's just, you know, I cannot watch that one. You know what I mean? I'll have to turn it off and come back and somebody have to tell me that Todd won and then I have to watch it. I mean, people are saying that, you know, Brutnik is so technical, incredible hand control, but then I'm like, okay, and then I'm just thinking the horsepower, the side pressure, you know, I mean...
SPEAKER_01: like anything can happen in that much we can like people like the interesting thing is that i do that that poll on youtube it says 70 percent hutchings winning when i do arm wrestling engine page then i see the opposite way then the pruning is winning the the same percentage almost 70 percent so i don't know i see very close if that match goes to strap i think i think prudnik
SPEAKER_02: will be in trouble. If I were... Can he get there, though? Can he get there? That's my main X factor of the match, I think. If Prudnik can not let Todd go to straps, then we're on, I think. I think Prudnik, the world-class athlete that he is, will be able to take it. But if we can get the straps and Todd Zille can just engage every bit of that side pressure,
SPEAKER_02: I mean, the guy can move a tank. If I was double parked and someone blocked me in, Todd Ziller could literally just come and side pressure a car off the road. Like he's just that strong. So I think outside of straps, Prudnik will probably get the win. But if it's inside of straps, then I love the way Todd Ziller goes about it.
SPEAKER_00: I had so many thoughts on that one about the straps and non-straps because of the way Todd pulls and all that.
SPEAKER_00: I know. Yeah. I mean, it'll definitely will be technically technical. So I guess that's, I'll come back when I was thinking about, so me and Todd were just kind of messaging each other and he was telling me like how I don't need to practice right now for my matches because like, you know, it's not necessarily what not. And I disagree with that a hundred percent.
SPEAKER_00: because i know his stance and i disagree with that because i'll tell todd like todd you don't know how to arm wrestle like you don't know how to slip you don't know how to top roll your top yeah your hook your your hook is like this like you know what i mean you cannot arm wrestle without the strap like you it's hard for you to get to it like you need i i understand where you're coming from and i understand why it's wrong because you're the guy that needs practice so he told me that the other day that i need i don't need practice and i'm like
SPEAKER_00: i've listened but i disagree but i see him i see people tagging him at that ohio practice like every week now so i don't know he's just lying to me but i see him at practicing a lot more often that he normally would because you only need one two practices do you mean table practice
SPEAKER_00: Yes, like on the table, like table time. Yeah, I will say table time. Right. He he's he will tell me, like, you don't get table time. And I'm like, no, like, I'm I'm thinking table time. It's always needed because it's
SPEAKER_00: i used to think the same way now i'm the opposite and i see why and that's why i'm kind of like well i mean i see why you cannot sleep todd and why zolo beats you with the top roll it's you know no no no no you need to practice senior table time so that's why now i see him doing all this table time
SPEAKER_00: he might just be go with this beautiful, you know, Todd Hutchings, stop, roll and slip with Sputnik and go, go strategically about it. You know what I mean? He has my book, so it should help. Got them. So it is interesting match, you know, for sure, you know, and the personalities. Todd is a very smart guy. Right. Rudnick is also very smart guy in my book.
SPEAKER_01: Brutnik is the second guy about the control, well-roundedness, table intelligence. At the table after John, I think that that is the second guy with that incredible hand control. But if we talk about the horsepower, side pressure, Todd is, I think, the strongest guy.
SPEAKER_01: that category if he if he can apply if he has chance if he is not put in bad position right away and you saw how how he won the match round two when when it actually got everything even took him to here he's still he's still opening you know to their side pressure i think that people are mistaken by attacking on his hand only once you once you don't control his pronators
SPEAKER_01: don't control his pronator you are not touching anything about his pressure he doesn't i mean he still holds you with his fingers yeah it gets worse as long as he is his pronator he will apply the side pressure if you want to be taught the primary thing you need to control his pronator and make his palm facing up you need to do this
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, and you can also do is take his risk at same time. Well, that is great. You if you are not very weak guy about the pressure, you're going to win that match. But just taking his hand and
SPEAKER_00: and leaving his pronators just because you want to take his hand, you get him far from there, you're going to lose that match. I agree, because it feels like if you pull with Todd, you got his hand and you feel like, all right, we can go, but it doesn't go. It does get sticky and sticky. Yeah, you're right. If you don't control the pronator and you're not trying to turn him palm up, it doesn't get better for you, for sure.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, you apply pressure by having this angle, keeping this angle. So once you control here, he will, he will kind of, I mean, you see here, you can't really put so much pressure, but once you have here, then you can, you can still. Somebody asked if Rustam Babaev can hold Hutchings in hook. I don't believe he can hold him in hook. Rustam never, ever allowed Tattu
SPEAKER_01: lock himself, especially in early rounds. Rustam has incredible wrist flexor and explosiveness that Todd never ever had chance. Rustam exactly did what I just tried to say here. Rustam controls his grenade right away, but in a slow hook.
SPEAKER_01: in an equal position, I don't think so. We saw Zolev most of the times beat Rustam in hook, most of the times. But when you look at Zolev and Hutchings in hook, I mean, no way. Just one time in the overalls, just one time in the overalls in Zloty. Other than the supermatch 6-0 and in Yalova here, where they pull is about 200 meters from here.
SPEAKER_01: And if you guys remember the last rounds, they went inside. I mean, Todd's arm wasn't going anywhere. Do you guys realize that one round, Todd even stopped him at the middle like this without the strap? Zole couldn't move him and he was opening. He elbow fouled intentionally twice. Yeah. That match, in the strap, that match, there was no way Zole could win. Of course, it doesn't matter.
SPEAKER_01: Fereshteh Ganjavi- Slep is put there when it is needed, there was no need for step, but if somehow he could manage to go step, in my opinion, no disrespect to agi he couldn't manage winning that match here.
SPEAKER_00: yeah no no no he he are he are massive professionally he did he did the best and it's funny like that's like that changed my whole arm wrestling perspective to where like oh god it made me believe in what i was thinking because you got the world's best traditional hooker
SPEAKER_00: Top rolling, you're, you know, top rolling in general and going for that A move as a top roll. That tells you about strategies, about how you can approach matches that, you know, sometimes it's good to change things and stuff like that.
SPEAKER_00: that was very interesting for sure and zoloyev played it right and that starts fall again for not learning how to slip and do all this magical cool things early on to negotiate the match and get in the straps
SPEAKER_02: and that's it he just puts the foot the foot down and that's it anything nothing else nothing else matters it's just like i don't need hand i don't need anything i just need straps and i need to go side and and why not he's the most powerful guy on the planet in his weight category to go side so it is working but yeah you are right um
SPEAKER_02: the intelligence of Zolev at the first East versus West that was, yeah, just a bit of a masterclass for people wanting to learn the technical side of arm wrestling. It's not just brute power. And Zolev outclassed Todd in that matchup and got the win.
SPEAKER_01: It shows you how important technique is. Zoloev pulled so many East vs West to go, and we're still talking about him. That's how important the technique is, right? The most interesting thing is that I asked Zoloev in the press conference of the East vs West 2 in February, and he said he prepared, he trained for his hook before he came to here.
SPEAKER_01: And I said, wow, like you just directly top roll him and you are saying you prepare your hook. He said, Engin, whenever I felt his hands, I found there the weakness. So that's why I attacked there, but I did not train my hook, top roll, he said. I trained for hook, but then suddenly I decided to top roll. This is what he said. And another thing about going step with Zolev is not that easy.
SPEAKER_01: Like every time Tino tries, he pins him. Every time, if you guys remember, Sasha tried to go strap with him, he just pinned him. He didn't allow him to go there. His hand is so strong, very strong hand he has. So it is not that easy to slip from his hand, you know.
SPEAKER_01: That was my coach saying to my buddy Ivan from Russia, he was always, whenever people ask his opinion, he's like, no, no, no, no, no, it's that Zoyev just not allows people to sleep for the most time. Yes, yes, yes, a very strong hand, very strong grip, you know. His wrist is also strong, but most of his power is coming from hand strength. But you can see that time to time he is losing his wrist against Tautiev, against Plamen, against a few other guys, you know, in the strap.
SPEAKER_01: um sweden arm wrestling federation christian three of my favorite youtubers my favorites are all of them and it will be pleasure to watch them all have a great day or night proud nerdo arm wrestling thank you very much my friend for your uh super chat yeah great god
SPEAKER_01: you guys realize that you know there are like if we would talk deeply about all these matches like how we are doing probably would take three hours you guys yeah no no well it's just like we are not going to but i mean really it deserves to be talked about them like for example just just come to john brzing and on garbaev i mean
SPEAKER_02: What a match. What a match. I mean, it was a shame Ongubayev got injured at the Asian Championships because I'd love to, you know, get a bit of a taste of where he was at against Marcio. But yeah, anytime you see John Paul, it's exciting. And Ongubayev is...
SPEAKER_02: just so talented so talented the way he can hit from so many different angles uh yeah when i when this was when you did announce this thing and i was actually a part of me was glad that on gabayev
SPEAKER_02: was uh was injured and had to pull out against marcio because now i'm like yes let's uh skyrockets at the top and and see where see where on the bio is really really at because guy's just a stud just to start he's like a swiss army knife so many weapons that he can go and he'll and he'll make it difficult for john that is for sure it'll make it difficult i can't wait for it yeah
SPEAKER_01: guys how do you like my t-shirt old school labs yeah that's my my my social media sponsor also sponsoring east versus west uh yeah you will find at the end of the live you'll find the link and if you enter engine code you will have 10 discount my friends um so and how you see that match artem
SPEAKER_00: so y'all got me thinking because i was not too sure and i'm like i'm remembering uh hunger wives preparation for levon and you know that was a while ago but still like he is very dangerous and he's he's tall he has a good size to him you know he's the 225 guy but just kind of natural i think because he's like built so good frame now yeah
SPEAKER_00: yeah good frame tall great technique uh very dangerous very fast very yeah um you know john been looking so good where at first as i said i'm kind of never even thought about this i'm like well i mean john being just kind of picking everybody so he will win this one but i don't know like if you can't be sure right you cannot be sure right
SPEAKER_00: No, no. I mean, if I were to put my money up, I mean, I don't see why you will not want to bet on kid or the league.
SPEAKER_00: like i i don't think it's not a stupid bet you know i mean always bet on john arden always bet on john that's what you got i mean i did sleep in john's house i drank beer she's that you know i love john it's i had a great time in john brzenk's household but i mean i see what i don't you know i'm seeing uh under by do something too um i don't know yeah i don't know
SPEAKER_01: it can be it can you know you know how it happens when you see this these close matches uh the only thing we don't know like what their exact shape right so that that we know all the possibilities how the match can go but like every every possibility requires strength you know to apply you know that that that I mean you can see that he can do that
SPEAKER_01: but is he strong enough to take the risk is he strong enough to control the pronator is he strong enough to apply pressure to win so we don't know how strong they are but we know their abilities at the table i am expecting a close match i don't expect an easy match for either side
SPEAKER_02: That'll be a silver bullet. That'll go 3-2 either way. And yeah, I cannot wait. The first round, John will go in for a hook. He always loves to see where he's at against anyone on bicep to bicep. He'll go in there and see what he can do. And then it just becomes a battle of the hand control. I'm very interested.
SPEAKER_02: Because we've seen John recently pull bigger guys, stronger guys, and he's been able to handle them. Now I'm interested to see how John goes against speed. Because I don't think in his last few matches anyone is even remotely close to the pace and the quickness of Ongebaev. So...
SPEAKER_02: you know, we saw when it came to strength, you know, young fellas like Chan Shaw and Dmitry Gachan's like, yep, okay, John's coming back. And then he's pulling strong people, Zolev, you know, quality arm wrestlers. And then it became a battle of,
SPEAKER_02: against pure strength with Zurab Tabrizis and then Corey West. So we knew that one. So now it's like he's ticked that box, he's ticked that box. Now I'm seeing how John can handle speed because it will cost him around. It will cost him around. Can we say that after John's comeback, around his weight, Ongarbaev is the
SPEAKER_00: most effective guy in technical aspects like the the the arm messing quality not even so much that yes for sure that but also he's built as i think that uh anger biaf has um uh was it in the same white class yeah well
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, but Ongarbaev built differently too. Ongarbaev built so much taller, I think. At least what it seems like over here to where without the strap, Ongarbaev is your favorite without the strap, I believe. No, the match is going to go straight anyways, just trust me. Nobody is going to control the other one. You don't think Kedar Ghali has the hand control to pop John like that?
SPEAKER_01: I mean that the guy is I mean if anybody is going to do he's the one just just remember his match against prudnik at top eight prudnik won but how did he win he won by hook but whenever they both go outside outside and then prudnik's list was like just he eventually toppled prudnik and the toppling
SPEAKER_00: top eight shape of Prudnik is not that easy. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
SPEAKER_00: yeah i i have i have both i'm allowed to go back and forth i'm okay but yeah i don't want to so yeah yeah uh
SPEAKER_00: You can come and hang out in Australia. Don't worry about Johnson. I'll go to Turkey. It's cheap to stay. Hey, I'm tracking flights to Turkey. I have like direct flight Miami to Istanbul. It's like, hey, your tickets went from $2,000 to $4,000. I'm like, oh my God.
SPEAKER_01: when i was tracking them they're like they're only a thousand dollar ticket normally it's just uh the date the closer i get the price changes i'm like oh my god four thousand dollars yeah now this is to russia russia flights are i mean it's because there is no direct flight to most of the other countries so they are using istanbul airport as a connector you understand yeah so that that that is the thing that you know there's very busy
SPEAKER_01: like daddy can's flight change like a few times already you know just like i mean come on you know and 33 hours from australia to get there yeah it's just too expensive just only only the flight tickets and then some will come by land you know um near 30 000 of this event
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, Australia, Brazil, USA, you know, just like, I mean, people tell me that, Engin, why don't you do a free live stream like Michael does? I mean, this is an international event. There are 29 athletes, except one, 28 of them are coming from other countries. Like, what are you talking about, you know?
SPEAKER_02: know this is like if i would only invite the turkish athletes and do a tournament i i can do that too as well probably but this is not the difference is the the the difference is with with that uh comes from sponsorship so uh michael and rebecca they had the sponsors that covered all the the athletes i understand but i don't think that it it cost like like is there stress over a hundred ten thousand dollars
SPEAKER_01: I mean, Australia, you're bringing up this from Russia, not Russian, but you bring in Georgians, you bring from Latvia, you bring many of them from U.S., Brazil, you know, just you bring in the refugees from other countries that that that is not the same thing we are talking about. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I know. I was more defending you, Engin, because... Yeah, put it on for free, but yeah, there's a huge difference when it becomes behind the scenes. Yeah. I mean, I'm just saying that, like, only the, like, airplane costs would be almost as expensive as the other event that they are comparing, you know? Right.
SPEAKER_01: was it last east versus west free to watch or what i i don't remember this west one was uh with the donations yeah first one but but hermes versus hermes versus matt mask match were sponsored by massimo naim from italy hermes is sponsored but he they wanted me to organize it here but the expenses were covered by massimo
SPEAKER_01: But I hosted the event on the same stage. Other than that, the others are covered by a little bit sponsorship and also it's covered by the donations.
SPEAKER_00: i remember travis asking all that i'm just asking if east versus west three it was a paper view or was it free to watch was it two three four was paper two three four i don't remember i don't remember okay because i thought it was a big cat you watched it illegally adam no i mean you watched it illegally cut him off
SPEAKER_00: get him out i watched it i just remember like that you know the others don't even remember paying that's how rich i am really you know what i'm saying that's all that's all i'm trying to say i can afford 15 researchers i bought five i bought i think five or six pay-per-views i'm not buying the fifth one again because i'm planning to be there because i'm i'm going to give you money in person yeah
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah. I mean, the fifth one already, like, Hermes Gasparini versus the winner of Jerry Cadoret, Gennady Kvikvinya. So Hermes versus Jerry or Hermes versus Gennady. And Hermes Gasparini versus either Cody Merritt or Artem Morozov. And whatever the result of August, it doesn't matter. We will see John Berzing and Brudnick.
SPEAKER_01: That match needs to happen because we don't know when John will suddenly say, okay, like, I'm done, you understand? Like, yeah, Engin, you know, I don't feel so. I mean, he may say this any moment. We don't want that. We want him to be along with us. But whenever he says that, we can't really force that guy, you understand? He's doing his best to be with us. And so it is good that, you know,
SPEAKER_01: like we said that match already that the world needs to see that match evgeny prudnik and john brzing incredible match and according to tatashins it will not be a title match because tatashi says that he is going to beat prudny and he said that he's going to take the title to u.s and then he's not coming in november he's going to come in february if we continue um so he says that that match is not going to be for title but it will be just a friendly match or something
SPEAKER_02: back to the battle of pride yeah i love the confidence of toddzilla but yeah john i mean we've been we've been so spoiled the last 12 months of having another match of john and another match of john you know i thought he was only going to do three matches when he came back and i think he's up to seven eight or nine at the moment and booking
SPEAKER_02: further matches so yeah i mean and it's things like this event where people really need to buy the pay-per-view because we need to support the athletes and the promotions that are putting it on because if we don't like then we you know we're back to watching our mates have matches in in the garage at our training we're getting
SPEAKER_01: world-class athletes on a regular basis so i'm a yeah i'm a big fan of people whatever they can to help out this time people are writing that yes uh i i already pay for the satellite truck and so this time we are not gonna use the internet or anything we are gonna just do the streaming to my magic yeah yeah yeah so so you guys i mean i i do my best my friends um
SPEAKER_00: Engin, since you have all these title matches, if you have some number five female in Turkey, not number one, like number five, or maybe a loser of Ryan Bowen and Coach Trey, I will arm wrestle either one of them at East versus West number five. I think it's a good match. Either one of those two.
SPEAKER_01: me either loser of coach ray ryan bowen or like number five turkish girl right not number one i can't do that i can't do that ah you you you you're gonna be stormed after this just just already take your joke you check your whatsapp messages you know yeah michael told michael todd version 24.0 i am the strongest i have ever been
SPEAKER_01: okay thank you for your super chat um yeah so what what what were we talking about yeah we were talking about we're talking about that if if it's mean yeah november november the other one is rob vision versus drop yeah and people people are saying back on the table that was great edit did you just ring him and offer him the match
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I mean, people are saying that he lost Sasho, so it will be the same with Zurab. But just, I think that if, in my opinion, Sasho, never over 90 kilo guy. Zurab is about 100 kilo. In my opinion, Zurab would win, my opinion. Both at 90 kilo, my bet would be on Sasho. But one is 90, one is 100, Zurab. But this match will be under 100 kilo. Even though Zurab, in my opinion, is stronger than Sasho,
SPEAKER_01: I think that Sasho's wrist handling against top roller, that flat wrist, spinated side pressure, is in my opinion, like wrist handling is stronger than Zurab. So for Rab to top roll, Sasho, in my opinion, harder than Rab to top roll Zurab. Zurab may be stronger, but his wrist,
SPEAKER_01: may fail. So that is why I see that match very close because I don't think that, you know, it will be easy for Zurab to take him inside. If, if, if Rob comes here prepared, I think it will be a good match. Yeah. Did you just, did you just get in contact with him again and offer him a match? Like first of all, he said yes. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: That's awesome. Yeah. Yeah. I wrote him. That's so cool. Yeah. I mean, I mean, like I kind of like it is easy to lose people. But this is hard to hard to bring names to that level. So it is too early for Rob. So Rob needs to be involved, you know, so that is I felt like responsible. I didn't invite him. I invited him to do East versus West one.
SPEAKER_01: But it was about the summertime because of his business, you understand? So this time, November, also, I know that he didn't feel good after such a match, so he needed some time. So I kind of felt, okay, it's time, you know. So now he has four months, and I'm sure that, you know, he will be ready. Yeah. How come you didn't put him up against Ryan Bowen? Who? RVJ. How come you didn't put up with RVJ?
SPEAKER_01: Oh, Bob Brown is coming. Hello, Bob. The man. He looks asleep. Hello, Bob. Hey, buddy. Am I sideways? Yeah, we see you sideways. Oh, hold on. That's weird. Like this?
SPEAKER_01: yeah yeah yeah well um how do you guys like think about like paul talbot his left arm
SPEAKER_02: Andrew Mashman- loved it loved he's got this new aggression about him, he wants to be back in the spotlight, I thought the way he had an awesome match. Andrew Mashman- With pavlo and founder founder lane and ended up getting his pin he staying power was unbelievable for a guy that was much heavier than him yeah he's. Andrew Mashman- So. Andrew Mashman- For you another question so.
SPEAKER_01: 187 85 kilo daniel prokopchuk and paul left arm left that's great oh
SPEAKER_01: still still like you seen same like mismatch like you see corey miller or i'd probably have to get more more data on daniel's left arm i've seen a lot of daniel's right arm i'd probably have to watch a lot more uh i would probably lean towards daniel daniel with right arm never had won world championships with left arm he has won three is it enough that's up for you that's come on come on your research is weak
SPEAKER_00: Come on, man. I'm a new dad. I'm a new dad. Yeah, but you were so confident. You were so confident. And Enkin is like, well, you know what? He just dunked on me. Yeah, well, that's what happened with you and Jordan on Goodbye. Well, I mean, you know, I know better. You have a YouTube channel. I'm trying to get an East vs. West 5. Yeah, yesterday I was...
SPEAKER_01: guest for uh kurdeca and with issa and i asked both of them to count me the matches from east versus west five from november they both could only count two of them so i i rated them as the low level fan just joking joking and now you don't know you don't know about daniel uh his left arm
SPEAKER_00: So how to rate this guy, Artem? Paul is awesome. I mean, Paul, his weight is questionable because he goes kind of up and down. He's really big, lightweight, but his frame is big. And the 187 class is dangerous to him because he kind of walks around there if he can.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, I don't know, like he's very dangerous, you know, and his style is stupid for sure. Yeah, I'm excited about anybody that you can offer him left handed and that like top lightweight echelon of, you know, Eastern Europeans, I think it will be good. Yeah, the American. Yeah, I don't think well, Aussie is crazy for sure. 100%. So I'm thinking Danielle and Paul Lefty.
SPEAKER_00: it will be good i mean it can go either way you know i mean i think whenever paul did try to compete at wasp i don't think paul ever did good so i don't i'm thinking here dedicated scene maybe it can be different because he's up there but i don't think he had any luck at any of the worlds that he went to if he went to more than one daniel daniel three world titles with left arm all of them are in 154s
SPEAKER_03: And the match will be under 187, which is more natural weight for Paul and Bob. How do you see that match? You know much about Dania. Well, the only study I've done on Daniel is when I I saw him for when he's pulling Corey Miller. Yeah, I really haven't done much on his left arm, but does he pull the same?
SPEAKER_01: left hand as he does right hand, does he primarily hook? He can do both ways. Right. But what's his primary move? Is it a hook? I mean, normally it was hook in the past. Yeah. Then he can also do dead wrist pressure. And then later years, he started to develop coronation. But he can do all of them. Right. So, you know,
SPEAKER_03: if you try to hook left-handed against paul talbot it's going to go one of two ways either it's going to go into the hook and daniel's going to kill him or he's going to lose his wrist against paul talbot and then the war will ensue and it'll just be a it'll be a nasty war uh who will win the war i don't know so you are saying that paul's hook is not that good
SPEAKER_03: probably not as good as Daniel's. And especially if it goes to the hook, Daniel is a shorter man. So he has a shorter arm. So from a leverage standpoint,
SPEAKER_03: once once the shorter arm actually gets to the hook which is rare a lot of times shorter arms don't get there but when they get there they have you know a leverage advantage and considering the guys won three world titles i'm thinking his hook is really strong so probably stronger than paul's but getting paul into a hook is incredibly difficult
SPEAKER_03: Oh, yeah. And he's got the taller arm. So if Daniel starts to try to top roll against Paul, well, I think that's going to be a problem for for anybody with a shorter arm and against against Paul. So and I, I honestly think it's going to be the same route with Corey Miller.
SPEAKER_03: i think daniel's going in my opinion my guess is dan going to lose his wrist against both of those guys and then you're gonna have what i think is the best thing is you're gonna have a war you're gonna have this great epic match that somebody's gonna win i'm not sure who but you know gonna be awesome do you do you think that uh daniel will dominate corey or you think that the match will be no
SPEAKER_03: it will be good. I can't... Especially the early round, right? Especially, for sure, early round. Yes. Like, when he pulled Giannis Amos, Coach Ray asked me, who do I think would win? And I said, well, I think in the early rounds, Corey is going to win. And he asked me why. I said, because he's faster and he's stronger than Giannis.
SPEAKER_03: It's just that at some point the match is going to stop and Giannis really knows how to arm wrestle. And then I even said those words to Giannis. I'm like, look, I'm telling you, Giannis, he is faster than you and he is stronger than you. I'm telling you that right now. You're not going to stop his hit.
SPEAKER_03: so he knew it going or at least he knew it from me and he still didn't really know it until after that first match and then yannis had to switch to a completely defensive style now daniel has no defensive right hand yes he has he is he is all control
SPEAKER_03: he's he has to have control now if he loses his wrist he'll just keep going sideways you know and but if he loses his wrist again the war will ensue you know I mean
SPEAKER_03: what dead wrist what guy loses his wrist and then instantly pins everybody after that outside of todd hutchins not jerry jerry doesn't pin everyone right away no no no nobody nobody pins everyone right away but there are guys that can do that yeah right so that's my point so how do i think these guys are going to do against each other i mean if i've got to pick a winner right now
SPEAKER_03: Daniel will probably win right-handed, but it's not going to be as easy as a lot of you guys think. And I would also say that Daniel will win left-handed, but again, I think you're going to be very happy with the matches because I think there's going to be wars. Paul, you're talking about Daniel against Paul left-handed? Left-handed, of course. That's who he's pulling. Okay, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: So the guy who can lose his wrist and still fight and still be in the match, which clearly is Daniel, he can do that. I think the guy who took the wrist is going to run out of gas before the guy who's lost his hand because the muscle groups used to maintain this are a lot larger than the muscle groups used to maintain this.
SPEAKER_03: generally oh the guy with the dead wrist generally win unless the top roller really knows how to work the hand in the straps to get unbelievable leverage to then get behind and press which i don't know if corey knows how to do that
SPEAKER_01: yeah I think that also I mean top roller if top roller is when he stopped and also using the bottom side of his hand to control the tornado of the deadly sky he can also win but only taking the risk and leaving the pronator and then it is very hard as you said the brachii brachii radialis will not handle all that pressure if the guy knows how to use it but but right if you also control the the
SPEAKER_01: pronator when you are top rolling then then you can dominate that he's not going to resist so much he needs to have a little bit though here you know i i i agree i mean so those to me those matches like if if people were to vote you know on match of the day it wouldn't be one of those two matches because i think both of them are going to be very exciting they're going to drag how do you see it rap region versus uh in in
SPEAKER_03: November, do you think that Rob has a chance to crack his wrist? Crack his wrist, yes. Beat him, no. He cannot do shoulder pressure? I think he'll end up in a losing position. And to make that transition to then push him down, I don't think he can do. I think it's very, I mean, if Ron Bath can't do it,
SPEAKER_01: then I don't think Rob Vision Jr. will be able to do it. But again, I think other exciting. Do you rate Ron Beth's top role better than Rob Vision's top role? I rate Ron Beth's ability to hold in this position better than Rob Vision's. Yeah, but does it have to be in defensive position? Can he not just directly from the start go to that way?
SPEAKER_01: don't think i think rob can no i i don't i mean john pulled stronger version of uh zurab but round five instead he was just holding here so comfortably but whenever he brought here it was very hard to
SPEAKER_01: finish to finish the match but but here he was just even looking at him you know like this like without any movement you know but to finish him he really needed to go up up up up catch his fingers and then uh finish that's exactly right that's the same thing that rob vidgett will have to try to do it's the same uh corey miller and uh uh oh again
SPEAKER_01: Paul, Paul Talbot will have to do. And I don't know if I have the ability to do it. I have, I have a, I have a question, quick, quick question for you guys, holding hundred kilo. Like he's just a hundred kilo around a hundred kilo versus Sasha. How do you see that match? I know that Rob has better outside move compared to Paul.
SPEAKER_01: but uh inside do you remember the match pauline versus john that john even got some injured from his pronator john really had a hard time to pin paul there and do you think that that match could be something sasha versus pauline
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, absolutely. What would Sasho be coming in? What would, what's Sasho weighing? I mean, he's, I never seen him over 90 kilos. I don't remember. Even if he was, I don't remember. Yeah. I still think, I still think Sasho wins, but it'll be very, very hard work. I think that'd be a fun match for sure. Artem, how do you see that match?
SPEAKER_00: um you'll have to repeat on who we're talking about because i was not paying versus sasha pauline sasha oh sasha sasha wins that one i i actually i mean i love pauline but i think sasha wins that easily easily beautiful technique big biceps looks good yeah based base it's how to go into a hook
SPEAKER_01: and Sasha is going to beat him. Do you think that Sasha in hook would dominate John? Uh, well, well, that's because it's a very, I will tell you one thing that Zola and Sasha pulling hook Zola won after like five, six seconds.
SPEAKER_01: yeah but sasho's never getting john into a hook unless john wants to have the question but i saw john controlling zola everyone in hook when he came to istanbul the last round he went intentionally there so what i just tried to say uh maybe it wasn't a hundred percent zola but still um that that that is that is interesting that's interesting well see some of them matches
SPEAKER_01: i i would like to see okay so let's say we got east versus west right you put joshua but you require that in the first round they got to go into a hook they have to hook each other i mean i mean i i would like to protect the the nature and original arm wrestling well i understand yeah yeah i kind of feel i kind of feel responsible you know
SPEAKER_01: to be faithful to the result of evolution of arm wrestling that came to this point. But I will say that then who in US could be a good match for Sasha? Todd Hutchins. Not the super heavyweight, but Todd Hutchins you mean? Todd Hutchins. Todd beats him though. Exactly. Todd wins.
SPEAKER_02: yeah the weight is not well he's weight category to find someone heavier um you know at the 100 at the 100 kilos it would be yeah it'd be a hard one
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, there's a problem. Yeah, I have. There was a good question in the in the chat too about who can who from you ask can be a good match for Cherkasov Oleg and it's I'm thinking it goes back to Corey Miller because he's also like doing the light guy we have technically. And and and well, how do you think it? I don't I don't know how it's going to go.
SPEAKER_00: because technically corey here is a little still bigger guy how about jeff hale versus chelka so oh no i think oh i think oleg kills jeff i don't know it's fun to watch i love it i think jeff performs good at the high level but yeah janice didn't like easy away
SPEAKER_01: What's Oleg's weight? He's like 154 guy. Oleg is 70 kilo world champion. He used to be 65. And whenever I ask him for a super match with Yusuf here in February, he didn't want any weight higher than 72 kilo. And he pulled with Yusuf. Yusuf is my student and 65 kilo world champion. Round one, Yusuf beat him fairly easily. And round two, Yusuf bring him to that close, like here.
SPEAKER_01: And he ran, ran out of gas after like maybe a minute long match. And then after the check, as it was like, uh, he controlled the match, but he won a three one. Wow. Yeah. At 150. I don't know anyone in the States that can hang with that then.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, we don't have solid, like, I mean, Vazgen could have been it, actually. I don't know about Vazgen, actually. Vazgen is a good lightweight. No, no, no, no, no. Vazgen has never been that effective at WAF level over 60, 65 kilos. 60 kilos, he was very effective. 65 kilos, he was in the mix. When it came to 70 kilos, it was above his natural weight. I have a question for you, Bob. I said
SPEAKER_01: Haidar versus Cobra for November. And Haidar hasn't been training, and he is about 150 for now. The weight limit is 165. And Cobra hasn't been training. And so 165, I made a legend status, you know, super match. I love that match. I think Cobra would win it.
SPEAKER_01: But I love, I would love to see that match. I mean, I'm an old fart too. And I like to see the old guys bang around with each other. Yeah. I invited even Dave Patton. And then he was very happy to be invited. He was honored. He thanked me so much. He said he's busy with Jiu Jitsu. And he said, yeah, I said, you don't need to come for a super match, but you can be our honorary guest, you know, anything, you know, and
SPEAKER_01: He was very happy to be remembered, of course, we should remember him is yeah and and I hate when people are ungrateful and they act like you know oh long live the king has died, you know long live the new king yeah you know that type of thing I really hate it, you know just like.
SPEAKER_02: I mean, yeah, you gotta remember the people that passed away. I mean, without, without you guys, I couldn't, I couldn't do what I do like people. Yeah. You gotta, I'm a big fan of all sports and I always remember the people from, from, you know, the, the old guard and when they want to come back, I'm, I'm definitely excited. The Cobra's back on the table. Uh, I think that's, that's, that's great to say. And I hope.
SPEAKER_02: I, yeah, people, I don't want to call them from the past because they're still involved, but the champions, I want them to stick around for as long as possible. And you can do that in arm wrestling. I mean, look what, you know, John's doing at 57, what Ron did on the weekend at 61, I believe. No other sport is giving you that. So we should, I think I'm with you on that one, Engin. We need to be a bit more appreciative of the superstars.
SPEAKER_01: really really just trust me i'm making my dreams come true i'm not doing any kind of business here i mean i just want to remember all those great guys but of course we can't do full of those dreams in a match because i mean i need to give people what they want to watch as well you know that that is how i finance the event but i need to just remember those guys as well yeah
SPEAKER_01: yeah it will be good it will be good yeah we have been here for almost one and a half hour and and dave cheffy morozov do you guys do you guys expect any surprise from that match i said surprise because on the polls or whenever i ask people they looks heavy heavily favorites well so for me you know morozov
SPEAKER_03: to me is a relatively new guy. He's become a monster just in the last couple of years. And he's a young guy, which means over the course of just six months time, a young guy can make substantial gains. But Dave Chafee, we've probably already seen the strongest version of Dave Chafee that exists.
SPEAKER_03: Maybe he can get a little stronger just by getting a little healthier. Because trust me, the older you get, you're always dealing with some type of injury or nagging pain. And if we could just get healthy, we would be way stronger. So it would not surprise me at all if Morozov beat Chafee and Cody Merritt for that matter. Because as strong as Cody was,
SPEAKER_03: when he won the Worlds in 2019. I do think he is stronger today. Yes. But he's not 20% stronger. Probably 10%, 15% stronger. But Morozov could have gotten 10% stronger from six months ago.
SPEAKER_01: You know, he hasn't even come close to his peak. I mean, two or three, four years from now. Sometimes being stronger is important, but like our messing has techniques. So you, it is like, yeah. I mean, just because you get in strong in your way.
SPEAKER_01: it may not be enough to stop the guys using his own way. So the style of Cody may be bad for him. We don't know that. So if somehow Cody can stop, I mean, Morozov using his wrist and then keeps his wrist flat versus flat, then that match may be over. You know what I mean?
SPEAKER_01: morozov needs to have control to win that match while in such an ugly position yeah it will go this way because he can generate incredible side pressure so as far as him against dave chafee i mean i i would like to say dave chafee is the favorite
SPEAKER_03: But to me, Morozov, Dave Chafee is a known entity. He's been a known entity for the last several years. Morozov, he changes every six months that dude could be stronger. So it's a tough one to call.
SPEAKER_02: And he's young. He's young as well. That's what's scary. He keeps getting bigger and bigger. And, yeah, I said it earlier, I wouldn't be surprised if Morozov wins both arms. Like, I think Dave wins. I think Dave wins on the right arm. But if Morozov, you know, and it's a bit of a changing of the guard, that wouldn't surprise me either. He looks incredible at the moment. Right. Yep.
SPEAKER_02: Engin, do you have any junior superstars, any 16-year-olds in Turkey? I have read in the chat, they are talking about Reno from Croatia.
SPEAKER_00: why would you ask him that bro like he already have this like 154 guys from there destroying everybody now you want a 16 year old to beat somebody in america nah because i've got a 16 year old killer here in australia and i want to get him on the world stage i'll see east versus west is not a stage that you you need to like they are talking about reno here
SPEAKER_01: From Croatia, this guy has won senior Europeans. And last year, as a junior, he was second. He lost to Marharit only in the WAF wars. So like he versus schoolboy could be a good match, you know. One is about 105 kilo, other one is 120, but one proved himself in seniors.
SPEAKER_01: school boy still needs to prove himself in senior level he is great at the youth he won the wars it would be an incredible match you know yeah yeah so but i i really expect people to uh prove themselves there or there or here you know but something internationally or against some very well-known uh people because guys i really have very limited card i did 16 uh it's too long
SPEAKER_01: and i am i made a mistake this event as i said over 110 000 and some people are talking this time i made a deal with satellite truck and they they are gonna do the right that streaming everything will be good and so uh but some people are talking oh i mean we are just gonna wait it to be on
SPEAKER_01: YouTube or something, you know, and so I mean, I can't really I need to either stop organizing, if not enough sports, I also start to have some sponsors, or I need to just make the cards much smaller. But I am thinking of nine matches. Already, I said, I think, for the East versus West five, it's almost about the prize money amount, that it's almost the same as this one. But
SPEAKER_01: because now 29 atlas then there will be less than 20 atlas and i think that it will be the cost will be uh at least airplane like maybe near health and it will not be august it will be november so tickets will be hopefully uh cheaper and so i can't really i really need to put their matches that
SPEAKER_01: the the community would like to see otherwise i can cover the event and if i can cover the event i cannot organize it if i can organize it i in my opinion it's not because i am organizing the arm wrestling world will be missing something good how do you think bob am i am i mistaken bob no i i you're 100 correct i mean at the end of the day if the organizer isn't at least breaking even
SPEAKER_03: he's gonna quit doing this so uh i i i think you're correct east versus west is not a is not the place to showcase new arm wrestlers it's the place to showcase established monsters that everyone wants to see the match
SPEAKER_03: That's the place to showcase it. I mean, I think what Michael Todd is doing with his undercards, all of his undercard matches, all of us are doing those on our own dime. He's showcasing either up and comers or maybe some old timers like me against some young bucks up and coming.
SPEAKER_03: But all those under, we do them on our own dime. We do them because, you know, we just want the match. It's just the, you know, it's just the main card that, you know, you got to pay for. And that might be the East versus West can do, you know, East versus West.
SPEAKER_03: three hours or, you know, in lead up to the main East versus West, you could do a bunch of these undercard matches, but they all got to, as far as you're concerned, they'd all pay for themselves. They just all pay for the card. Yeah. Tell you to go against the 16 year old kid. Great on East versus West big show, but they're doing it 100% on their own dime.
SPEAKER_02: You know? Of course. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, totally agree with you there, Bob. Absolutely. But I think, yeah, I think for your longevity, Engin, the cards need to get smaller. Yeah. They need to have less matches. Because we'll watch them anyway. I mean, the talent that you're bringing over, whether it's five matches or 15 matches. Yeah, but that's not the thing. You know, my intention is
SPEAKER_01: like even if i break even i'm okay i'm i'm just trying to give chance to as many as atlas possible you understand so i i just try so i can i can i can um can you bring me charger please so i can how to say uh like i am also preparing something for the top you know what i mean like like are you not are you guys not impressed by uh tobias
SPEAKER_01: Yep. Love that guy. Yeah. I mean, so you understand that Tobias is not right, right, right there, but it is going there. So you need to really motivate these guys, give them chance so that at the end, even if I don't organize East or Swiss anymore, I will leave by giving opportunity for these guys like Zurab Taberize. Who knew Zurab Taberize six months ago from the, uh,
SPEAKER_01: america tell me about who would know who knew yeah but now like if they are good friends they know who he is right right yeah yeah but but it is it is only because this guy had the how to say uh opportunity to show himself um it's not black or my battery is just low so we are finishing anyways but um
SPEAKER_00: In my opinion, I think that now you suddenly have the title matches. I think that's how it will work itself out. Because the problem with everybody to do what you do is random. That's why it's hard to follow it all the way through. You're in early stages, so it has to be random. But now you have the title matches, you're going to have a winner and you're going to have official champions.
SPEAKER_00: and from there you can build your little ranking system because you keep introducing new people so you're going to have east versus west lineup you're going to have champion in your pre-assumed three to four classes and those are you guys that are going to be your top dudes and then from there
SPEAKER_00: you can keep introducing new guys and as bob and also said that can be you you will have to limit your card to what you can afford if you can know you can afford 10 matches every card then do 10. if you can afford 15 matches every card okay if 20 you have to stress and you know and it's going to be bad let's come down to 15. 10 is okay less than 10 i will feel guilty for not giving opportunity
SPEAKER_00: for the athletes i will feel like i am trying to save money you understand i don't like this as long as you know you as long as you have a spreadsheet of how much you spend how much it always comes out so you know it's not like i'm breaking even you know you're breaking even and then if you're breaking even in 20 matches every time then hey let's try 21 next time bring it to you but with you having the rankings and the official people now you can have
SPEAKER_00: you can pick people and see that you know give an opportunity to newer guys and see who needs to maybe get paid here or there and you can have a logic of who needs to be on this card and how much needs to be spent i think once you get the logic of people and champions in their classes and you're going to have a structure there
SPEAKER_00: that is going to be easier to build the classes because like, hey, you know, East versus West six, we have this and this guy, our muscle. Oh, well, why this? Well, because this is where they at now, because that's what happened in previous matches. And, you know, it's easier to follow. It's easier to promote. It's easier to sell to the public. So once you have going to have that, it's going to be easier. It's just we need to we need to grow all together, my friend. Remember, you said that you want to do something with me.
SPEAKER_00: right so that's going to be that's going to be east versus west uh five yeah i'm going to eat versus west five adam i'm going to be the announcer i have i have more i have more money oh see i can offer unlimited things
SPEAKER_01: anyway so guys it is more than one and a half hour now and i am sorry for taking your time so long and i'm finishing here i need to go to hotel and reserve room for those the juniors will come for seminar from other countries and so i thank you very much aussie thank you very much artem bob thank you for joining i know you were training you still uh
SPEAKER_01: uh had time for us thank you very very much and i think everyone who watch us and if you want to say anything last you just go ahead please is that why bob had chalk on his shirt this whole time i have it's chalk oh that's savage respect that yes yes that's an arm master that's enormous with the strap strap you know just here making so red and if you see the child get on you know
SPEAKER_03: Yes. I still have mine. I practiced yesterday. I have my strap here. You're right. I have it. Yes, we had arm wrestlers. Yes. Since we have the Aussie arm wrestler on here and, you know, he said he didn't know a whole bunch about me before I pulled Bill Logsdon. Well, now you know a little bit more about me. And supposedly, it's not official, but it's kind of close.
SPEAKER_03: I'm pulling a gentleman named Kyle. How, how worth from Australia? I really, really. Who's supposed to be the top dog in Australia under like 190 pounds at the next 90, 90 kilo guy from Western Australia. When's that match at the next monster? Michael Todd's December. Awesome. That's great.
SPEAKER_03: I want you to come here with your American team, man. Support your friends. I know. I just, like I told you, man, I'm really tired of flying long distances and I get, you know, but I'm going to make sure with you.
SPEAKER_00: oh my god hey kyle is so strong bob you better be careful i remember i was real light at 165 but he beat the to me so bad because he's nice now but he's a good one yeah it'll be i think it'll be a good match and i i just mean awesome i love he's a nice guy as well kyle he's an he's a nice guy he's gonna whoop you bob he's gonna whoop you okay
SPEAKER_02: Make sure you have your money ready when it's time to bet on. When that's officially announced, I'll get you both on the show. And we'll have a chat about it. Awesome. Anyways, thank you very much, guys. And hope to see you next time. I hope. Take care. Take care. Sir.
