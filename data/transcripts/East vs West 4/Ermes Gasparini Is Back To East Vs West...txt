SPEAKER_00: Hello guys Anyone? I know it is again Unplanned Live but Hello guys hello How are you guys doing?
SPEAKER_00: Good to see you all. Yep, Hermes, yep. He just, yeah, let's chat a little bit about, oh, it's Champions League final? I have no idea, my friends. I stopped watching football long ago. I kind of find it a little bit, I would say.
SPEAKER_00: too much fanatism there. Anyways, do you guys, did you guys follow that, uh, the news? Hermes Gasparini today was like, you know, call me again. And I was like, why don't you call me? And then he called me, I was busy and I called him back. He answered. And finally, as, as you saw that, uh,
SPEAKER_00: No, we still made some, you know, negotiations. It didn't go as he wanted. It didn't go as I wanted, but since he was pulling with both hands, so we find a... I know, I know, Caroline, you know, you have been writing this everywhere, everywhere. I'm just trying to cover the event. Once I find sponsors, Derek will be there. Sean, hello, Sean.
SPEAKER_00: Thank you for your support chat, my friend. So, we are in Hermes, you know, no matter where we are, if there is camera or not, we are just laughing, laughing like crazy, you know. The guy, you know, he's just funny guy.
SPEAKER_00: He tells me everything and I tell him what I think. He tells me. I never thought that he was wrong. I don't think he's wrong. The same case with Devon. One of the reasons that I can't bring Devon here, it is like hard to afford, you understand? Because I'm trying to organize many, many, many, many matches.
SPEAKER_00: and okay some of the elite guys may think that you know I need to give them more portion and just like this but like I also told to Hermes that you know Hermes once you were not superstar just go five years ago but now at that time I was saying look at this guy this guy is gonna be like next John Brzenk you know and now I told Hermes that Hermes I am also now looking for the new Hermeses to make the armwrestling
SPEAKER_00: elite elite league you know even stronger we will go all of them we will go that's live things you know and everything we will talk about it but
SPEAKER_00: Ermes said, Engin, I'm ready to pull the winner of Geri and Gennady in November for the title. And he also said that, Engin, I'm ready to pull the winner of Cody and Morozov with left arm as well. So, Ermes is set to pull the winner, the title holder, with right arm and the left arm. After August 7th in November, Ermes will pull with
SPEAKER_00: both hands you know for the title so if he wins both Hermes is going to be the title holder with both hands in super heavyweight category so Hermes is ready to pull it's good news I love Hermes, Hermes is a great guy again you know
SPEAKER_00: Yes, yes Wi-Fi Wi-Fi card will be there my friends. I already I already found it anyway, so As I said Hermes Hermes is also hopefully coming to the August event just to check his future opponents closely and
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, about the, you know, I also do world rankings. I'm kind of like tired to, you know, just, sorry, but, you know, some people just come in, oh, you're wrong, it's terrible ranking. I mean, I was doing ranking 20 years ago. I was the only one who was doing the world rankings. It is impossible to please. I also explained to Hermes, like, just think this way about my rankings, that why Gennady is three and this and that.
SPEAKER_00: I mean the latest result matters the most I mean just think this way Kurdesha beat Ermes and placed above him okay and then Ermes beat Gennady now we have Kurdesha, Ermes and Gennady and then Dave Chaffee came and beat Alex and then now we have Dave, Alex, Ermes and Gennady now we have
SPEAKER_00: Gennady, the beat, important is when the match happened, where these people are ranked, important. I cannot put someone, I mean, some result from six months ago over a result that is one week ago. Like, how can you say that, you know, a result from six months ago is more important or as important as what happened last week? I mean, why do we even have super matches
SPEAKER_00: If everyone is always the same, you know, if nobody is improving. Of course, the latest one, I know, I know, I know, guys, I know. Vitaly is not ranked on my ranking. Vitaly was out. He's inactive. He pulled, but it looks like Russians are banned. So Russians will be pulling against each other. So it doesn't affect. Slav doesn't enter my world ranking.
SPEAKER_00: Turbin doesn't affect, I've entered. Vitaly doesn't enter. Once Vitaly was out, then everything is out. So whatever happened today doesn't affect my own ranking. You know, so my ranking is like whatever it is now.
SPEAKER_00: yeah it's a style thing but still you know latest result is important I mean like if there is a boxing match if the guy is number one and the other guy beats him he takes first place it doesn't matter that if the third place guy they beat the number one guy lost a guy some months ago you know it doesn't change it doesn't make the fifth place guy
SPEAKER_00: take the title i mean if you are pulling with the guy you pull in for his ranking you know once you you you arm wrestle him and you beat him you take his ranking you know no point point based system it doesn't make sense you know i mean the one that competes the most can can get the more points in the combat sports i think that you know this is how it works you're ranked somewhere if somebody beats you he takes your ranking that that's what it is you know
SPEAKER_00: important is not six months ago this whenever this match is happening what's the current ranking the guy if you beat the first place guy you take in the first place if if one guy
SPEAKER_00: 10th place comes and beats Lewand he's gonna take his first place he's not gonna bring Lewand down to ninth place or something you know the guy stays in his own ranking and then the guy who beats him just ranks above him you know this is what it is um guys about about the tickets okay i will also um try to explain a few things guys um i am
SPEAKER_00: Okay, it will not sound humble, but I'm good about armwrestling. I'm good about armwrestling as an armwrestler, as a trainer. I race many world champions as a trainer. I train many, many world champions. I made myself world champion. My first world title, 94. The last world title, 2018, 24 years. There is the closest guy there is the Haji Murad Zola with 16 years. So, but I am also...
SPEAKER_00: good about this matchmaking too. But when we come to do business, I'm terrible guys. I mean, I may be not that terrible, but if the subject is about arm wrestling, then my emotions, love, passion is just overcoming my mind, you know? And then what am I doing? I just come from competition, no good sleep, and then I started setting all the matches for the next event because 70 days left. So what I do wrong,
SPEAKER_00: First I set the matches and then I calculate. So I set the matches and I calculated and this event is going to cost about $10,000 more than the last event. So I'm like, okay, what to do, what to do, what to do? So I talk with some people and then they give me, Engin, how about sponsorship? We tried to find sponsors here. We couldn't because I don't know where to find them or something. And then they said that, how about you do some special things? So what we do,
SPEAKER_00: On the t-shirts, we have the logos of the event on the Arm Masters. So instead of that logo, maybe we can keep the logo, a small one, where the heart is right here. And then we're going to give the big logo of the sponsor to the t-shirt, front side, and probably back side too.
SPEAKER_00: we are gonna find, I already announced that there will be like $5,000 for the all matches, like 15 matches, means 30 athletes, of course some pulls right and left, and then we're gonna ask like $5,000 and then
SPEAKER_00: All event long. You know the videos on my channel for the East vs West 2 watch already 2 million. And this one already 4 days ago I put it and started posting. Now I didn't post all of them yet. It's already reached to near 1 million. So I think it's gonna go up to like 3 million views. So
SPEAKER_00: And then I think that East vs West 4 is still growing. I think that maybe will be 4 million views on that. So, I mean, with $5,000 sponsorship, we can put your company's logo or whatever. So this is one thing. Also, there is at the back side, you know, when the guys, just camera guys filming right behind the referee, there is, you see those arm, you know, logo. Maybe we need to move that arm logo to up.
SPEAKER_00: So that we can put a sponsor there so that during the match all the time the logo of the sponsor will be seen. So $5,000 if anyone is interested we will put your logo everywhere maybe even on the table as well you know.
SPEAKER_00: So also we have a VIP package but this is limited to 10 people. Already 4 people is about to get it. Then we talk how it is going to be. 10 VIP, how is it? You come to Istanbul your own and then on the 5 star hotel you can come with your wife or girlfriend or your friend or you can come alone, whatever. We provide your room with whoever you come with.

SPEAKER_00: some some some guy wrote me and you are like greedy or something it kind of hurt me because i'm trying to not lose my own money and the guy calls me greedy if i was greedy i would just sit there five super matches and then would make like 20 000 profit every event that i organize guys that that is so stupid that somebody is just saying that that hurts me it kind of like it kills my motivation but i just try to ignore that and just as you guys should just i try to look at the
SPEAKER_00: majority what majority says as you guys suggest me anyways so no i just tried to explain you know how i feel you know anyways uh trash talk oh yeah yeah yeah i forgot the vip people will also have a seat on the press meeting together with the outlets like you will be also filmed with the outlets and every each vip person will have a chance to ask one question

The problem is, is about organizing and competing in the event is just like, it is no good, no good. It is just really, if you are asleep, it just kills me.

SPEAKER_00: winner of Jerry and Gennady in November for the title match and also he is ready to pull with left arm the winner of the Cody and Morozov as well he wants to pull in same event right and left and if he wins both of them the guy is going to have the both titles super heavyweight titles of east versus west with right arm and left arm yeah I saw a video
SPEAKER_00: yeah they are training partners I don't know how serious they pulled or not I don't know about that but yeah but it didn't affect my own ranking because Laletin was out of my ranking some days ago already because of inactivity now the only the Russians are pulling against Russians so I think I will keep them
SPEAKER_00: out of the ranking once they can compete again so they can compete the people who are ranked in top 10 and then they can get the ranking
SPEAKER_00: red rocket pig awesome job on the card is canadian canadians love you what is your opinion on levan sending that dress to devon not cool no he didn't i i did that interview he didn't do that threat he said that this kind of things they take in canada um georgia more seriously
SPEAKER_00: And people even may get killed. But this is talking about how it happens normally in Georgia. And I said, is this what you feel about Devon? He said, no. He said, he has so much respect for the community. He will just go to Dubai. He will arm wrestle and come back to Georgia. This is what he exactly told me. I did that interview. I don't know. Everything, everything looks good. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Also, some people, some people are 1,000 was on the, I heard 10,000 was on the line. I mean, yeah. Set up a patron page and a website for merchandising. Yeah, I think it's good. Yeah, good idea. No, he didn't say, I did the interview. I did that. I talked with him, you know.
SPEAKER_00: You didn't. I did. He didn't send that to us. Anyways. Name of the hotel is Green Park Hotel Pendik. Green Park. Let me write here. This is five star hotel. Green Park Hotel. It's the same hotel. Pendik, Istanbul. You will see here now.
SPEAKER_00: um thank you very much what's his point to having so many matches it is too much it's i don't really think it's too much expensive guy it's 14.99 it is like one dollar for one super match i see one match super matches with like six six dollars seven dollars eight dollars five dollars one one match
SPEAKER_00: It is just like an armwrestling night over here. Of course, it is daytime overseas. Mars Belts. Engin, what happened with the Zvetan Gasevski match? Do you consider to invite other Bulgarian armwrestlers like Yuriy Shvetkov, Mitko Petrov? I already invited Bojidar Semenov. He will pull against David Samusha.
SPEAKER_00: Um,
SPEAKER_00: Thank you for your super chat. I also invited Sasho to pull Zurab. I'm waiting answer from him. This guitar account, Engin, I haven't felt excitement over an athletic event in years until you start doing East versus West. Please ignore the trolls. Yes, my friend, that's what I do. I care about the people as yourself, always trying to, I'm not a, I'm far, far, far, far, far from being a perfect guy or something, but this, I have very good intention about arm wrestling.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I already invited Corey West. I already invited Corey West. Oh, it is expensive for me. I know it's expensive. Yeah, but I don't know. I don't know. Like, like whenever, whenever I make plans, I'm telling you, my love and passion is too strong that it just like, like wins against my mind. So I'm like, I need to invite that guy too. That guy is probably waiting for me to invite too, you know, and then
SPEAKER_00: I have a dream you know I'm just trying to it's just like a I'll say big big big fun for me you know to do this I don't think that I'm not planning like you know let me make more money maybe five matches six matches you know I'm trying to do something with time you know we will see more results who is where where is Morozov where is this guy where is that guy
SPEAKER_00: As long as I cover, I don't lose money, I'm fine with it. Red Rocket Pig, Vitaly just lost a match. Yes, yes, yes, my friend. Thank you for your super chat. I saw that. Setting this event super expensive. Yes, my friend. It is like the event that I just organized was about
SPEAKER_00: 15 easily 15 20 percent more expensive than the last one and then event that i'm going to organize in august is again minimum minimum 10 or 15 percent more than the i just organized so that that is the problem yeah
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I already have East vs West, the English carrying the burden, not enough. Am I getting this $1,000 and all expenses paid in Istanbul? I'm telling you, when you say all expenses paid, your breakfast is covered and then when we go dinner with the athletes, you come with us and whoever comes with you, your wife,
SPEAKER_00: or your friend or your girlfriend, also her or his room is also covered. We will have a double room, double room. So, and then your breakfast is covered in hotel. And then when you go dinner with us, then you are not gonna pay either. We will probably go two, three times while the athletes are here. So also you will not pay entry fee to the venue.
SPEAKER_00: you will be sitting at the front row, and then you will be part of the press conference, and then you will be not sitting there like a spectator, but you will be sitting together with the athletes
SPEAKER_00: So you will be part of the press conference when it's filmed. And then you will also ask questions there. Each guy, I will ask him to, I mean, tell him to ask one question. And then you will also go to photograph room, you know, and when the athletes are having official photographs for the broadcasting, you will also have photographs together with them for each athlete.
SPEAKER_00: and then we will print them and then you will sign them they will sign them for you and also you will be able to go to the the the the t-shirt signing room and then we will also give you a signed t-shirt but just one if you come there with two people you you will get only one one t-shirt signed
SPEAKER_00: not to um did i miss anything um i think i'm in red rockets you tell you just lost a match and after that yeah i need i need sponsors guys i mean yeah i do we do sell tickets when they come there you you normally enter the the venue yeah
SPEAKER_00: When you enter, yeah, you pay the entry fee, yeah, normally. Guys, forget about arguing, you know, they will just pull arm muscle. Nobody is going to kill nobody, just you can be sure about this. No, based on points, I don't think for the combat sports is a good thing.
SPEAKER_00: You can see one guy is killing the other guy, but just because the other guy put more events and collected more points, he will be ranking above him. It's a one-on-one sport. Yeah, if I can keep the pay-per-view low, then I will not be able to cover the events. There is no guarantee. I think that mask hair transplant will go well, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: um and i like this car with my company i do construction but right now i don't have money for that yeah thank you still yeah we have separate ranking system as well yeah um
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, if $10 each person sweet, yeah, that's good, but I would, I mean, then I would lose so much money. I don't know, brother.
SPEAKER_00: Thank you, thank you very much. Hello, best wishes. Thank you very much. Best wishes to you as well. I mean, I would consider many of the Russians once the waft lifts the ban, ban, then, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I think Arthur also lost at the Russian Nationals, so I think since we pulled with Arthur here, since then, he's just losing, keep him losing, I think. His style is, I don't know if something is wrong with his arm or whatever. Yes, about a thousand more people buy the pay-per-view, but the expenses was more than, more than last time, about 15, 20% more than last time.
SPEAKER_00: yeah anyways guys i wanted to share about how uh Gennady Challenge both the the winner of the Jerry and Gennady match with right arm and the Cody Merritt vs Artem Morozov match with left arm this guy is going to pull in November
SPEAKER_00: for right and left arm super heavyweight title of East vs West. Yeah, it will be $14.99 guys. $14.99 which, trust me, it costs much more than I really need to go to social media and try to find sponsor. Yeah, some, yeah, Hermes. Today I also teased him. We had a video chat today.
SPEAKER_00: through WhatsApp. I also did like this to him. He was laughing like crazy. Yeah, like brothers, you know. Older brother, younger brother, you know. Yeah, Hermes is a good guy. Um...
SPEAKER_00: No, I wouldn't do, I will not do pay-per-view $20 or more or anything, something like that. I will only do it as much as I think that it will cover the event. Why do you mismatch your Supermatch in favor of Eastern? How is it then? Why, like just because you saw one match, just won the polls, all of the polls except Mad Mask match,
SPEAKER_00: Americans were heavily favourites like 70-25, 75-25, 70-30. So it's just your bullshit, you know, nothing else. You are just trying to steal the pot here. Trying to poison people with your ill mind.
SPEAKER_00: because offering your tickets it might be financially what do you mean offer offering your tickets what's that and when should we expect this for monday monday we will be started shipping probably every day we will ship like 10 t-shirts 10 t-shirts but probably there will be 170 so just in 17 days 17 work days all the t-shirts will be shipped because when we go to the post office when we bring way too much
SPEAKER_00: um way too much um then they are complaining you know from one person that many of the shipments they are complaining um yeah okay i mean like how are you going to ask question through through live broadcasting or you will be there as a
SPEAKER_00: person, you know, in the venue and they will ask you a question. Yeah, Arif, Arif is pulling. Okay, there is, there is a change about that. I didn't announce it. Arif is going to pull Marcio Barbosa. Arif is going to pull, yeah, Marcio Barbosa.
SPEAKER_00: oh take the questions with their name before the event and then ask their questions by by their name yeah yeah i will tell you if it is possible to get east versus west t-shirt after i i count everything you know um everything uh because i don't know how many will be left so yeah you may probably
SPEAKER_00: I mean, yeah, the guy just keep asking about it in slave, like how many times, I don't know how he's gonna ask. I answered the question many times already. Do you live in a jungle? I can hear lots of crickets. No, it is, there is a river, river, river. And then there is, what's that? I don't know the name, how there is English. That's, you know, the green thing.
SPEAKER_00: What's that? How do you call Kurba? Frogs Yeah, frogs, frogs Frogs They can hear? Yeah, the one guy said that they can hear But he thinks it's crickets No Yeah It's okay Complaining
SPEAKER_00: female arm masters guys the female arm masters that I brought here for the East vs West 4 is just like the like John Burzing pulling John Burzing it is Egle White Kute if you don't know them then okay I think I will give you some time geçici olarak okay
SPEAKER_00: Egla White Kute just write on Google if you don't know him with Gabriela Vasconcelos both of them have more than 20 world titles so it is just like it will be like um how to say God versus God yeah yeah frogs yeah
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, year ticket, I meant pay a year subscription to watch East vs. West. No, East vs. West and King of the Table are two different organizations. Yeah, Egle, Irina Makeeva and Gabriela, these are the three greatest, three greatest female arm wrestlers.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know. Matt didn't look, you know, ready for the event. I really thought that he would be closer. I'm promoting Turkish Armwrestlers. Every event, three of them, there has been.
SPEAKER_00: Sparrow I'm thinking I need to find sponsors guy. I already Cannot you really I mean a risk to not to be I don't want to stop Organizing East versus West because of losing so much money Hello in dizzy busy 88. Thank you for your super chat. I
SPEAKER_00: So if I missed it, but with Coach Ray competing, will he still be commentator for East vs West 4? Have you selected the commentating team yet? Yes, he will pull the first match against Ryan Bowen and then rest of the event. Yes, he will be, he will be commentating, commentating. Yeah, I'm also trying to bring Derek here, but I really need to find sponsors guys. Like even one ticket from California to here is just around $1,500.
SPEAKER_00: Imagine how many Americans are coming here. There will be Australians coming here. The plane costs alone will be about $20,000. Guys, it's not that easy. Trust me. Trust me. Only, I will tell you this much, only, only the prize money of the athletes and airplane tickets will be very near $90,000, guys.
SPEAKER_00: And when you look at there, when you see like $13.99, $14.99 or something, if you think that it is all my portion, you're mistaken. You understand? I'm organizing this. I'm the one who is spending money to organize this. But I'm not having...
SPEAKER_00: that amount that you are paying for pay-per-view if there was no t-shirts donation money i couldn't organize this event so i don't want to go so much because i don't want to look like i'm whining you know like this but for me to lose ten thousand fifteen thousand dollars is just big money you understand some of you may have no problem with that but it's not that easy
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I want to make this event stable. After it's stable, then everything is possible. I will invite the disabled guys. Every match, every event, maybe one disabled match, one junior match.
SPEAKER_00: One, I'm not sure match. When one master's class, you understand, match. But just I need to first make sure that this event is permanent, you understand, that things goes, you understand? So, should get a chance to ask questions to the athletes via Zoom meeting or something like that during the press conference. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, we can do. Yeah, we can do something like that. Or we can record their question to the video they send us and then I hold the
SPEAKER_00: phone or whatever and then i play it and then ask the question the camera camera would zoom it and then you know everyone i call i hold the microphone and then yeah people can hear it yeah yeah that's good idea but i don't want you know so i'm trying to cover the event whenever i try to find ways to cover the event one guy wrote there oh you are greedy you understand and i'm like you know and then i'm kind of afraid to i'm even afraid to find a solution to cover the event now
SPEAKER_00: White Wolf, thank you for your super chat. Have you considered getting the Aussie armwrestler to commentate? Jack brings excitement to the table and energizes the matches. Yeah, that guy is, yeah, he loves armwrestling. I can see that. Even though it's not that easy to bring people from Australia to here.
SPEAKER_00: I tried to explain to you guys how hard it is to cover the event. But you guys suggested me more and more and more and more and more. I make probably the best card ever. And then every time I share that, people say, how about this guy? Where is this guy? So they don't see that probably 25 best arm masters in the world, but they are looking, okay, who is not here? Oh, this guy is not there. Engin, how about this guy? Where is this guy? How about this guy? Why didn't you invite this guy?
SPEAKER_00: like like you don't like what you see you know just when did you see 100 of the best athletes there you know i know i know but just come on guys like i like i at that whenever i share this like i want people i am my goal is to make people happy not to like people are oh okay this guy is not here you know that that that is not what i plan you know what i hope
SPEAKER_00: Paid spots on the cars where pullers from all over the world could pay, donate for chance to compete. Yeah, it's devastating, Caroline. If I can't bring Derek here, that tournament is just a shit, you know, you're right.
SPEAKER_00: seek for help for organizing. That way I will have to pay other people. Some people already... Ongar Bey, he's already at the tournament, he's going to play with John Brzezinski. Suggest matches, but everyone knows you already have a best card.
SPEAKER_00: Four Arms Krakow. Hi Engin. What do you think about some fans suggesting some of the events to take place in the West to make more fair LTC? See, what do you mean more fair? When it is organized in East, you imply that it is unfair? The event is unfair or what do you mean fair? Anyways, thank you for your super chat. Franklin Brewer.
SPEAKER_00: Thank you very much, my friends, for your support. Great job, Engin. I appreciate all you are doing. I thank you, my friends. Thank you, my friends. Thank you for your support.
SPEAKER_00: No, I would love to bring Derek. Derek, Chen, Shao, many guys. I would love to bring all of them. But you do not know the stress I am having when I put my head to the pillow in the night. How am I going to cover this event? If I cannot cover this event, how am I going to do the next event?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, there will be a music when we enter, the athletes enter. And also there is some of those smokes and lights, you know, turning where they are coming. Probably we need to do that one too. There will be music. There will be also slow motion replays after at least the end of the match, not the full match. But some points, you know, we need to do that.
SPEAKER_00: Johnny Boy. John versus Sasho. Bring Vitaly on guard. Russians are banned by the International Federation. They can come. And Sasho is too small for John. John is very near 110 kilo. Sasho is maximum 88 kilo. It would be very... If John was 95 kilo or something. That's five-star hotel, my friends. That's five-star hotel. It's a very nice place. Aleyna Tilki Çalacak mı?
SPEAKER_00: you need help you getting stressed out yeah anyways guys so I just wanted to share my opinions Hermes Gasparini challenged the winner of Gery and Gennady to pull them for the title in November and I accepted we made an agreement we found the middle way anyways so with left arm he also challenged the winner of Cody Merritt and Morozov
SPEAKER_00: for the title so if Hermes beats both of them he will have he will have the titles with both hands no there will not be any lagging lagging some people watch without problem except match and some people had their lagging issues but there will not be we will have the satellite car for sure
SPEAKER_00: um johnny boy do matches outside federation so you can bring russians or outside turkey it's not about that russian guys are banned if i organize an event russian guys are not banned in turkey or something it's international federation olympic committee suggested all the sport disciplines world federations to not to allow russians to compete it's not my if it was up to me i would i would invite them
SPEAKER_00: It's not their fault. It's my personal opinion. But as long as they are banned, so I... I mean, just how do you explain it when John is destroying people, when you see that Tata Shinji is destroying people, when Barbossa is winning, other guys are winning. I mean, come on, you know.
SPEAKER_00: like I have pulled like countless tournament in USA countless tournament in USA yeah about crowd also I need to but remember I don't do the video filming I need to talk with people
SPEAKER_00: No, people think I was joking. I was seriously considering to not to organize. I was almost so sure. But whenever I saw all the messages from email, from messenger, and Instagram, and hundreds of comments on the YouTube, and I was like, okay, Engin, people appreciate. It's not like...
SPEAKER_00: like you are thinking you are you're wrong about just you look at some some comments and you are like okay it's not appreciated so i better stop but whenever i see that people really loves it and appreciate i was like i mean it would be like so i mean like almost criminal against the community you know to to stop when people wants to do it
SPEAKER_00: wants to see it Ryan oh thank you for your support appreciate all you are doing for the support Engin much respect thank you very much my friend that is people like you guys I'm doing this I will continue doing as long as you guys want me to do it and I cover the event yep I need you too you we need you Engin but I need you guys too we all need each other what's the common thing between us just we love our Mustang
SPEAKER_00: yeah so we we as i said barboza will be pulling arif ertem instead of zulap taberize i mean you could open a donation link for the people who wants to donate outside of t-shirts or sponsorship so i should i should do two two um gofundme meeting like one for t-shirt and one for something else
SPEAKER_00: okay I would think thank you for your super chat Benson Paul thank you very much who is your current top I will tell you my top 10 I already saw on the arm masters arm masters only blog I don't want to argue with people because people I mean
SPEAKER_00: I breathe armwrestling. I gave my life to armwrestling. And when a guy just comes and says, okay, you don't know anything. I was like, okay, you know better. So I don't want to just go there. Willy Fatso, reach out to you via email about sponsorship. What are you looking at minimum? So I'm not wasting your time. Thanks, Willy. Thank you for your sponsorship. My friend.

SPEAKER_00: and all athletes all athletes and then where the referee is when if the camera is filming the behind the referee you see that that wall there there's our arm logo is that we we plan to move that arm logo up
SPEAKER_00: and then where the camera is filming we want to put the sponsor there so all times when the camera is filming that the sponsor logo will be there so we can also put on the table as well also for people who are interested we can put like 45 seconds long video video uh um
SPEAKER_00: advertisement between the matches also we are asking for five thousand dollars to put your logo on all athletes all competing atlas t-shirts for east versus west four i want to pay for a t-shirt with armors and not with some brands i do not care about
SPEAKER_00: What do you mean? I'm not saying. Interest in a Grand Prix Elimination Tournament. I don't know, guys. All, all, all. Guys, let me do what I'm doing right now because I don't even know, like, I can make this permanent. What my plan is, I want to make a good ranking, you know, of each category.
SPEAKER_00: and then after that we can talk about many other things but right now let's let's have the our own let's give the title and everything and then everything will be much better in my um opinion yeah will the title matches get more money
SPEAKER_00: I love having championships I think Hermes can beat Devon, Willy Pazzo so five thousand dollars I can definitely do I will email you look forgotten way okay thank you for your support you know you know my email right you know my email just just write me because some other people are also interested and then um and
SPEAKER_00: yeah so just hurry up my friends I don't know what you guys are saying some I look at like this looks like some people are arguing each other with
SPEAKER_00: You rock, keep up good work. I love it. Thank you very much, my friend. Thank you very, very much. Thank you, Dalton. Thank you. Yep. Anyways, so if you don't have any other question, yeah, Daniel and Bojidar, Daniel, we want to make it East versus, Daniel is going to pull Corey Miller and Bojidar is going to
SPEAKER_00: pull david samusha these guys have some business from the past it needs to be taken care you know and they will pull
SPEAKER_00: I didn't, Andre, I didn't get the answer from Sasho yet. Sasho has some things happening in his life, not bad things, but about the job and things like that. No, I already invited Travis Bajent for commentator. We even agreed, you know, he was going to come to my event. I was going to go there.
SPEAKER_00: even to give seminar or something you know but Trevor said that he look at his calendar and he saw that it's busy on same days you know they will be the ones wearing t-shirts with logo yes people are maybe thinking that the t-shirts fan buyers will have the same and no athletes that you know competing just say like there are 25 athletes they will have
SPEAKER_00: the business logo you know on them big big big business logo they will be competing and we will also put their logo of the business to the back side you know where they were the you know i don't know how you call it in english but you know that that back side where the big logo is and everything is there there we will put the also his um the guys whoever is just uh interested his um business logo back there as well
SPEAKER_00: My friend, if Russians ban is lifted by the International Federation, Russians are more than welcome. I try to keep the politics and athletes, you know, different. I know some people doesn't like what I say, but I kind of don't think that they have power, you know, to change some things, you know. So I kind of think that I see them, they are like lifting, lifting, lifting, armwrestling, training, lifting, lifting, but they cannot compete.
SPEAKER_00: You know, I understand what's happening in Ukraine as well. You know, I have my own opinion. I don't want to go in there too. And, you know, but I don't think that it is the athletes, you know, that we should punish, but it's just my opinion. If you have different opinions, I respect that as well. Travis would be good rep only with his own rules. He will probably, Travis is not going to follow the rules.
SPEAKER_00: Travis is the rule maker rule maker he is so unique personality strong personality he is see look at there do you realize it it is impossible to make Hermes will be in November I already made agreement it's impossible to make
SPEAKER_00: everyone happy one guy says i don't like that guy i don't want that guy other guys i don't like that guy i got other guy says no i don't like that guy just okay how to make them happy so what i will do i will just follow what i think so turkey is probably like there are there's russia kazakhstan georgia bulgaria turkey these guys are um
SPEAKER_00: We support you because you think very well. I love you all. I know I can't make all of you happy at once. I'm sure that you will have your own opinions, but imagine that, you know, like if you were in my place,
SPEAKER_00: you couldn't make everyone happy either for me Gennady is third place guy yeah we have nothing to lose Jerry is one of the guys Jerry is a new not new guy he's pulling from early 90s and if Jerry is coming I'm sure that he will get
SPEAKER_00: he will get, how to say, in a good shape. I'm not saying that he can win. I'm not saying he cannot win either, but he already won. Gennady already won against Dave and Michael Todd since Devon cannot pull. So who else is left, guys? If you beat both Michael and Dave and there's no Devon, who else from North America
SPEAKER_00: would you invite if you were me? If it's not Jerry. If you, Sweden Armwrestling Federation, Christine Whitman, thank you very much. If you want an announcer for the next East versus West, I can recommend Jake, the Aussie Armwrestler or Neil Pickup. Thank you for your suggestions, my friend. Thank you very, very much. Oh, I don't know. You never know. You never know.
SPEAKER_00: I think Dave guessed out. This is exactly what he also told me. Yeah. No, no, I will, I will invite, I will invite Light Base to last, last events. I did Yusuf versus Cerkasov. This time we are having Bojidar versus David Samusha. We are also having Daniyal versus Corey Miller.
SPEAKER_00: I am doing too, but just guys understand from little bit. As you say that, that's the reality that heavyweights take more attention. So, ... you need to cover the events. People will watch what they want to watch. So, I am giving them what they want, but I am also putting some lightweights and this and that, so that people will also get to know others too.
SPEAKER_00: So I know what I'm doing. I'm not saying that I don't do anything wrong at all or something, but I have a plan. I have a plan. Yeah. What was that? There is one angle. Just a quick. Is it guaranteed that $1,000 offer will be available for November events? I mean, we can do the same thing again for November too. Why not?
SPEAKER_00: Why not? I mean, I'm not going to lose anything. All I need to do is just a hotel reservation for the person with his wife or his girlfriend or his friends. He will come here. We will go dinner. I mean, yeah, it's a good idea just to support the event, you know. It would be better if you do for the August because, I mean, August is already bad planned by me. When I say bad planned, I just set the matches first and then calculate it. And I'm like, okay.
SPEAKER_00: Based on what data, Devon is number two. Yeah, because when Devon beat Michael, Michael was around there. Michael was around there. If you guys remember, Andrei Pushkar hardly, rest in peace, hardly, hardly beat. He was almost losing that match. He was 2-2. If he didn't figure out how to do that shoulder press, Michael was almost winning there. So...
SPEAKER_00: When somebody says that, okay, Devon beat Michael Todd, who is eighth place in your ranking, but Michael wasn't eighth place when Devon beat him. Michael was above that. Michael was above Dave Chaffee, above Devon, above Jerry. Michael was there. So another reason is that Vitaly is out. Vitaly is out. Vitaly is out.
SPEAKER_00: Hey guys, I just joined. What is the news? The news is Hermes Gasparini challenged the winner of Gennady versus Jerry match in November for title match and we made the agreement. Hermes is coming to August event just to watch.
SPEAKER_00: his opponents closely he also challenged the winner of Cody Merritt and Artem Morozov with left arm so he is gonna have two title matches in November so we will see who will be the opponent of who do you guys think that who do you guys think that would be better opponent for
SPEAKER_00: do you think I don't know Caroline thank you for your super chat I don't know Engin why not offer the West to commentate after they pull like Corey Miller anyone I don't know how good Corey Miller is about I really don't know how good he is about commentating yeah I mean if they are interested we can we can try that yeah White Wolf thank you my friend thank you thank you
SPEAKER_00: I'm gonna finish and soon as well so looks like looks like there is nothing much to talk hmm nothing much to talk yeah guys Turubin has yeah but we talking about what when yeah yeah I just joke Hermes Hermes is like my brother younger brother you know and just like
SPEAKER_00: I don't know Alex Alex thank you John thank you my friends thank you anyways guys so if you don't have any other thing to ask I meet you guys next time with new things you know just yes Thomas I saw your your
SPEAKER_00: message yeah please you can put on the chat that the ranking yeah the Thomas will put my ranking you're gonna ask me why Gennady is there Hermes beat him and guys for me the recent result matters the most that that is my logic what happened 66 months ago a year ago is important but the recent means that the recent shape of the athletes recent shape of the athlete
SPEAKER_00: let Ermes beat Gennady again and then he ranks number three if Jerry beats Gennady he ranks if he is better than that yes wait longer for posting paper match on YouTube I believe many more people will buy your paper if they know they have to wait a long time yeah I understand I understand some people don't have money Sean some people um don't have money
SPEAKER_00: and they cannot afford it i kind of feel like to make them aksai ramesh thank you for your support and support my friends um like i they are friends as well i understand may those river frogs help you sleep it's not my room it's my son's room so
SPEAKER_00: yeah anyways so that proved that Gennady was injured before we cannot say that my friend styles make matches if you realize that Gennady tried to top roll Hermes and when Gennady tried to top roll they they dominated him how did how did Gennady beat him Gennady hook him and beat him and so yeah two hundred dollars donation my friend always he always rich he always
SPEAKER_00: I don't exactly know who he is, but he always comes and donates like that big amount. He must be loving Armwrestling so much. And what goes there, maybe you do another guest Armwrestler. Yeah, maybe. By the way, I did, I don't know who is here on the Armwrestling Engine Forum. And Armwrestling Engine Forum, I ask people to do their
SPEAKER_00: prediction about the all super matches. So I deleted that post, but I video recorded all the predictions. So we are one guy donated one t-shirt. He donated money, but he said he doesn't want t-shirt. He said Engin give to people who cannot afford.
SPEAKER_00: so I will just leave the I will give the news who won the t-shirt as well soon and I will also ship the t-shirts
SPEAKER_00: Okay guys, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you very much. A lot of people watched, a lot of people supported me. I love you all, except the people who disrespects. And so see you guys next time. I hope, I hope and I know I'm gonna set this event. Everything will be fine and we're gonna do another one.
SPEAKER_00: in November which will be even better than the last one then we will do another one in most likely in February which will be even better than the other one so armwrestling will rock armwrestling will get where it deserves to be because armwrestling people think is like this they don't even realize how many how many muscle groups here are you need to coordinate and work together they don't understand
SPEAKER_00: Now millions of things are happening here. Millions of like, I mean, they don't understand. It is not because they are bad people, but they don't understand because they don't know. Whose fault is this? It is our fault. Why it's our fault? Because we couldn't, we couldn't show them. We couldn't represent our sport as much as it deserves. So now what we are doing, we are, we are more and more, more, more, more like people like,
SPEAKER_00: Devon, Michael, John, Larry Williams, and then the schoolboy guy, and the other guys, those Ray, Ryan, and this, we all are doing. East versus West is part of this. So all together, we are going to make arm wrestling great, and it will reach to, each reach to where it deserves to be, deserves to be all together.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, flex the forearm. You want me to flex that way or you want me to flex without moving my fingers and wrist?
SPEAKER_00: Anyway, so somebody asked something. Nikita, I don't know how to pronounce your last name. How much donation to rub Tata Shin's head at the event? You need to ask that to Tata Shin. Okay, I know. It's not about donation. You need to beat that guy. If you beat that guy, I am sure he will allow you to rub his head. And I'm
SPEAKER_00: for sure i cannot do it just train my friend train harder so maybe someday you may do it thank you for your super chat anyways okay arkadaşlar you all take care hope to see you next time my friends
