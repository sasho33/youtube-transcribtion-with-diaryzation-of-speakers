SPEAKER_02: where you won 242 WAF titles and easily. And same year, I think you took second to Gary Goodrich at the Yukon Jack, and Gary Goodrich at that time was kind of untouchable for anyone, including John, you know. He beat John in 94, and John, after that year, he went down to...
SPEAKER_02: calling like you speak your name is calling you you don't even like i mean sound georgian your name like you speak georgian you sure no one guy says he can help but the other guy was saying the same thing he just disappeared you know um yeah david found me david found you where is it how did you find me just let's see

SPEAKER_02: I found translators. Join us. Yep. Wow. We made it. We made it. Your opponent is coming. Yeah. Yeah. I send you link. Join us.
SPEAKER_02: zoom. So yeah, and after that, after that, you kept being one of the best North American and you won also 2000 Virginia waffles. So you have seriously, seriously, like you really look big your shoulders and everything. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: So I think, yeah, I think both are coming anyway. So, and okay, now we can focus here. So Harry, you have been away. I think your last match was against Michael Todd. Was it? Yeah. My last, uh, uh, match in a, in a meet. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I, I, I, I remember it was, it was a very long match and there was some arguments about that match. Um, it was step. What was the boss? I kind of remember what the, uh, I, I won the first match quick. Cause he tried to go inside. Then, um, I, I was, I was up two to one. I needed one more win.
SPEAKER_02: and then i got a fouled out of the fourth match can you hear me hello hello hello hello yeah yeah okay just soon soon soon uh canada will join us can you turn your your your own sideway yeah sorry sorry sorry jerry yeah go ahead
SPEAKER_04: Uh, anyway, I got fouled out of the fourth match and, um, ended up, uh, we went into the final match and we, we slipped, we went into a strap match. And when we went to the strap match, I, um, I got the hit and I was behind it with my shoulder and I was pushing and he was walking his fingers up and, uh, the strap started to expand and, um,
SPEAKER_04: there should be there should be a match to stop and then they need to put the step again that's what it should be yeah it came it came undone so when it came undone uh literally it was just my fingertips that were touching michael's hand so even if if i went for the pin or he went for the pin neither one of us could have pinned the other not that he could have pinned me anyway but
SPEAKER_04: it was inevitable. So I took my elbow off the front of the pad to try to just take the foul and get a restart. And then Michael tried to capitalize on it and end up saying I did it intentional, which I did, right? And I was okay with taking the foul because of a system failure, a strap failure, which
SPEAKER_04: after that match they implement the the rule that if the shot failed to stop and i restart thanks to my match it only cost me the title so yeah yeah yeah i understand uh can you turn your phone sideways my friend yeah thank you um can you ask gennady how we see in uh
SPEAKER_00: which is all and everything compared to the last time.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, so Gennady thinks that after the last match I didn't stop to work out, so I'm probably in better shape. And he also said that his finger is not hurting anymore. Oh, so it's just, yeah, whenever he pulled Dave, his finger was broken, right?
SPEAKER_00: Yes, I have two problems. One is that I am not used to wearing a uniform, but this problem is very serious. The first and second problems I have are that I am not used to wearing a uniform. I used to wear it on my knees when I was a child. I used to wear it on my knees when I was a child.
SPEAKER_01: So Gennady said that before the match he just broke his finger so he wasn't ready for biceps and he didn't train in a bicep technique, no. So it was a clearly surprise for him that he go inside the biceps. And does he think right now that like if he ever meets Dave again going hook?
SPEAKER_01: against him is the best option because he didn't look so effective when he tried to topple Dave.
SPEAKER_01: uh-huh so he's saying that uh i know that i'm better in hook right now i think that i can hook dave so i will go in the hook yeah i understand and can you again ask him does he ever face someone like jerry with that style
SPEAKER_00: OK. I would like to ask, how did you and Jerry Kaderoti get to know each other? How did you get to know each other and how did you get to know each other? I didn't get to know each other until I was 18 years old. I was 18 years old, and that's when I heard about the first election of Sapir. I don't know why. I was 18 years old, and I was 18 years old when I came to Lebanon.
SPEAKER_01: So he's saying that, uh, I am, uh, I can, I can pull like that, like Jerry does. So I don't need to know anyone else. Uh, I'm doing that. And so, uh, I know what's going to do, uh, for that, uh, how to say for, um, yeah, I understand. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I'm not sure if it's not applied against him. Does he think that Jerry is going to be a harder or easier opponent for him than they are? How do you feel about it? Do you think it's going to be Jerry or Martelio? I'm very happy with Jerry. I'm very happy with what he did.
SPEAKER_00: When I saw these videos, I realized that I was very lucky to have this opportunity. I am very lucky to have this opportunity. I am very lucky to have this opportunity. Thank you very much.
SPEAKER_00: My only interest is to become a sportsman. The problem with all of this is that I have to go to the gym and do this and that. Michael Todi is interested in it. Jerry Kadureti is interested in it. Magis is also interested in it. He has a lot of interest in it. I would like to say to everyone that you should do it. If you want to do it with Levan Saginashvili, you should do it. I would like to say to everyone that you should do it. Thank you very much.
SPEAKER_01: yeah so first of all he said that uh iris i have a lot of respect for jerry because when i was kid i was watching his videos how he how he was fighting uh what he is capable of and um uh he also said that uh in how to say
SPEAKER_01: uh in that technique uh i was befitting levan so uh uh also he also said that um how to say uh his most uh interesting thing is that uh he needs someone who has more endurance so uh he thinks that uh jerry has that endurance uh what can uh
SPEAKER_01: um god's how to say um he will be a threat for him uh like that so yeah jerry will be tried for him
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, he wants to be like that. He wants to fight, which will be endurance, you know, more endurance than power and flesh pain. So he was interesting like that when he met Michael Todd. So he defeated him and he thinks that he was more endurable. And he also, how to say?
SPEAKER_02: So he basically, he wants a tough match. He wants to have a war. I understand. I understand. And Jerry, you know enough of Gennady, right? You know enough of him. And you know that your opponent is not like super dominant, powerful guy. He is very strong, but he is more likely, he can pull in any way. He's just a warrior that he can pull forever.
SPEAKER_04: How do you see him and how do you see your match against him? I have a lot of respect for Gennady. He's obviously proved himself. He beat Michael Todd.
SPEAKER_04: He beat Dave Chafee and both matches came down to the last match, right? So even going into the last match and Gennady found a way to win. So he's a warrior and I feel as though I am too. So it's an opponent that I'm going to,
SPEAKER_02: have to come in 100% to win. But that has as much passion and drive to win as me. And how do you see your shape right now? Like, how do you see your shape? And like, you still have near a month to go? Like, do you think that you will be in one of your best shape ever? Or maybe possibly the best shape is possible or?
SPEAKER_04: I'm gonna come in the best shape I can so that there's no excuses, there's no anything. I still got a few more weeks of heavy training to do. Right now, I feel really good. I feel like I'm probably 75, 80% of where I can max out at.
SPEAKER_04: and uh but i'm i'm strong i'm good and you know endurance is getting much better um so i feel so i'm definitely not going to disappoint and i think sure there's going to be some wars but um i've never been one to give up right so i i'm in this for the for the dog fight but the things are coming quick right coming back quick you know because though
SPEAKER_04: like you have the old all kind of memory in your body that is just like more you train more the things are coming quickly back so you think you will be around like 100 in in a month yeah yeah i that i i planned it strategically and um i wouldn't um i wanted to see the progress each week and um i know it's a fight are you satisfied
SPEAKER_04: yes yeah i'm right on track with with my with my plan that i wanted to do now yeah it doesn't mean that i don't get sore right i uh yeah i feel as though the harder i train the more sore like it takes me like a couple days to recover yeah
SPEAKER_04: i do a hard arm wrestling practice and i've let 13 different guys keep going around on me and using a band and pulling with me it takes me a couple days to to get back to um feeling good um so i think you know that's fine because i don't care about the days after i care about being ready for the tournament right so
SPEAKER_04: that I've been able to train longer and longer and longer. I've been staying on the table and just letting people pull on my arm, pull on my arm, pull on my arm and get positions where they're super comfortable and I can just hold them with them and the band and then pin through them and the band. I'm definitely getting better. Yeah, for sure. Yes, yes, yes. In the chat, there is Chance Shaw. He said,
SPEAKER_02: Gennady is going to win 3-0. Do you have any response for that? Oh, you guys let kids in? Is he out of school? Chancho? He must be talking about all his previous matches. Has he come back up out of the 200 class yet to fight people? Chancho, you hear all this, right? See? That's what happens, Chancho, when you...
SPEAKER_02: uh see i'm rooting for the west of course but jerry will lose 3-0 i hope i am wrong but i know i'm not uh that guy that guy loves to mess with you yeah let's let's look at it this way right john whooped his ass i beat john todd hutchins whooped his ass i beat todd everyone he goes against whoops his ass and i've already beat those people but yet chance in his delusional mind thinks that he's good
SPEAKER_02: I mean, I mean, he is, he is not bad, but maybe it needs time for the, like, like, like super elite guys in the world, like yourself. Yeah. I mean, I want to hit the lottery. It doesn't mean I'm going to hit it. Yeah. I understand. Yeah. Um, can you, uh, can you tell that, you know, Jerry is about 80% and he will be about a hundred percent.
SPEAKER_04: and in a month and this is what what jerry said um what's that what make sure you tell him i'm looking forward to the match and i respect him yeah yeah yeah of what he's done you know so i think this is going to be before
SPEAKER_02: Yes, but as he said that he also respects you so much, he grew up by watching you. This is what he said. Yeah, just tell him that the respect is mutual. He is about 80%, but in a month he will probably be 100%. Does Gennady see himself possibly losing to Jerry? I need to steal the pot a little bit, Jerry. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Now, as I said, 80% is my maximum, and 10% of the population will live here. 10% of the population will live here. I would like to ask you, how do you think that this population will live in the future?
SPEAKER_00: If I were to say that I am a sportsman, I would say that I have been here for many years. I have been here for many years. I would say that I have been here for many years. I would say that I have been here for many years.
SPEAKER_01: So again, he said that clearly he says that I'm just coming to win, so it will be tough, so I will do my best.
SPEAKER_01: I don't think when I'm going somewhere to fight, I never think that I will lose. So I will win, he's saying like that, confidently. And Gennady also said that, don't have a hope that you can tire me, even if it will be a tough war.
SPEAKER_02: you heard that jelly what is what did he say don't don't don't have don't have any hopes to uh like think that you know you're gonna tire him even if it's a long war he said that you will be the one who will be the you know guessing out ask him if he thinks he'll ask him if he thinks it's going to be a long war or a short war
SPEAKER_00: Yes. Do you think that Mugle will be a strong opponent or will he be a strong opponent? Zogadat is very strong in the beginning. Zogadat. But there are two positions in the beginning. He can be a very strong opponent. That's why Mirceaul is very strong in Zogadat. That's why he has a very strong advantage.
SPEAKER_01: If I can, I will tell him. But in case, he says that I have a very good start.
SPEAKER_01: I cannot hear you. Can you speak a little bit louder? What did you say from the beginning? Okay, I will begin from the top. So he said that I have a very good start.
SPEAKER_01: There is two positions for start. He says that if I will be able to pin him quickly, I will pin. But if there will be war, I will do my best. And he thinks that I will tire him in any position. If he can stop me, then I will still tire him and win. Okay.
SPEAKER_02: you heard the jury he said he said he will try to continue if you stop him you know he will still try and beat you in any position that you put in uh also canada said that if he wants i will start slowly yeah did he did he say that if he wants if he if he wants he will start slow
SPEAKER_01: yeah yeah if he wants a slow fight i will i will start slow and if he wants uh i will start tough you know i will start yeah really i think this guy is underestimating you yeah he's uh
SPEAKER_04: Probably that Georgian water, right? They don't purify it too much. It goes to the brain, right? So I don't think...
SPEAKER_02: yeah i have to warn you last time he said something similar to dave they told him that his t-shirt was so tight that the blood wasn't going to his brain but but they ended up losing but now you're saying that they don't provide a georgian model good enough yeah it's probably not built enough so it's brain it's messing with it you know he's hey he's coming off too so you know it's
SPEAKER_02: just tell him uh i'm just going to uh make sure that it'll be the same results as when he went against ermys okay uh no no first tell him no no no first tell him that like he thinks that you know they don't they don't like the water is not like provide you know like enough so that there is something the problem with his thinking yeah to tell him that the water must be polluted and that it's messing with his brain
SPEAKER_01: I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say.
SPEAKER_01: Mark Twain said, David, and Mark Twain said, yes. Yes, and he said, it's not as if he was talking to Gaspare, as he said. Yes, that's what I thought.
SPEAKER_01: uh-huh so uh you know this uh response was that uh it is good about that uh it was uh it is good that uh you think that it will be uh
SPEAKER_01: It is good that you think that it will end up like Ermes did with me. It is good for me because that is motivation for me to get more angrier. So that is what he said. So him to think that he's going to end up against Ermes, this kind of opinion...
SPEAKER_02: will make gennady angrier is what he said yeah he said that okay and i i was almost bringing hermes to do to do this show today but he was on the way he said if you do that tomorrow i can also join because hermes is gonna pull the winner of this uh to great arm masters and
SPEAKER_02: So I couldn't make people wait because they were waiting. I already announced. And so let's see. Let's see. Let's see how it will be. Yeah. So you you you made him angry. You made him angry by by building in his name.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, yeah, right? It's okay. He can be angry. I want the best version of Gennady to come in to go against the best version of Jerry. So we know who the champion is at the end of it. I expect it to be more. But I'm ready. And I'll be ready. So I don't quit. Yeah. The interesting thing is that whenever he was talking with Dave, he was saying he was going to win. But whenever he talks with you,
SPEAKER_02: that's the truth that whenever he said that, like, he can even wait if you want that, that, that kind of, this is kind of like overconfidence, you know, overconfidence and ease. Uh, I think, I think you, you should prove him that he doesn't know you well enough. Tell him to, uh, if he's so confident, just go right inside with me.
SPEAKER_01: Ask him if he's man enough right inside. So he's asking that if he's man enough, let him start inside with him. .
SPEAKER_04: uh so gonna be said that uh ask that you don't have a strong wrist it was question no he just said that he could beat me inside outside he'll go wherever and then be able to you know out out do me so if that was the case because i know he's gonna go first move he's gonna come back and go outside he's i doubt he's gonna have the balls to go inside into a hook
SPEAKER_02: uh i think i think david i think he's trying to say that uh gennady talks like he's very confident but he is not as confident as
SPEAKER_04: it sounds this is what Jerry's trying to prove am I wrong Jerry no no exactly he said he could go outside inside whatever way you know and that he would come out victorious he'd come out the winner right so if that's the case then don't go to the back of the pad and try to go outside like everyone tries to do against me you know go right inside with me okay I will translate you
SPEAKER_01: Do you think it's a bad thing or a bad thing to do? And do you think it's a good thing to say that you're going to leave the country and leave the country? I don't think I'm going to leave the country, but I don't think I'm going to leave the country.
SPEAKER_00: I'm not afraid of anything. I'm not afraid of anything. I'm not afraid of anything. I'm not afraid of anything. I'm not afraid of anything. I'm not afraid of anything. I'm not afraid of anything.
SPEAKER_01: I will never say that what I'm going to do in the match. I can do bicep, I can go top row or back pressure. So when the match will be 3-0 in the first round, I will go in the bicep if he wants.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, after I'm ahead 3-0, I'll let him do whatever he wants. Yeah, 3-0, the match is finished. He's the best of five. Oh, no, no, no. He's the best of five. No.
SPEAKER_00: So, Gennady is saying that,
SPEAKER_01: I want him to prepare very well because I'm in a very good shape. I have never been like this. I'm the strongest version of myself. He said that. And when you invite me about on this fighting event, so I accepted this invitation because that
SPEAKER_01: I know that you are a very strong sportsman. You're a great arm wrestler because of that. I respect you and I accepted your challenge. Tom, the feeling is mutual. I want to ask Gennady another question. Does Gennady think that
SPEAKER_01: he can beat anyone on this earth except leon yeah yeah uh yeah
SPEAKER_00: I went to Levan with him, he was my friend, he was a good friend of mine. I could not go to Levan in this form, otherwise we would be forced to go to Soplios. The thing is, the people did not like Levan, they did not like the fact that it was Levan. And even if we were forced to go there, I was afraid to go to Kulisev. We were forced to go to Soplios, because I was afraid to go there.
SPEAKER_00: I don't care who he is, what kind of sportsman he is, and how he is. When I go to the 6th round and the 5th round, I give such surprises to the sportsmen, and if they give me 50-50, I will give them the same sportsman. Psychologically, physically, technically, it is not possible to say to them that I have done everything I could. I will not do it. This is not my fault. This is because I have done everything I could in Lebanon. No problem.
SPEAKER_01: So Gennady said that I can pull with anyone, no doubt. He said that I can pull anyone, even if I know that Lebanon is in great shape.
SPEAKER_01: He thinks that no matter what, who will be around the earth, I will pull to anyone. And also said that Engin knows that in the after pool maybe, I don't really know.
SPEAKER_01: uh we me and the levan he said uh we will we were pulling or something like that you may know that uh and it was like a close match maybe he said like that in istanbul istanbul yeah uh
SPEAKER_00: Yes, yes, yes, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right,
SPEAKER_00: It's been three years or four years since I've been there. It's been three years or four years since I've been there. It's been three years or four years since I've been there. It's been three years or four years since I've been there. It's been three years or four years since I've been there. It's been three years or four years since I've been there. It's been three years or four years since I've been there. It's been three years or four years since I've been there. It's been three years or four years since I've been there. It's been three years or four years since I've been there. It's been three years or four years since I've been there. It's been three years or four years since I've been there. It's been three years or four years since I've been there. It's been three years or four years since I've been there. It's been three years or four years since I've been there. It's been three years or four years since I've been there.
SPEAKER_00: So Gennady is saying that when I'm in the top 10,
SPEAKER_01: it i have a reason i have a how to say
SPEAKER_01: I'm responsible to work hard, do my best, what I can to be the best, to fight the best. Then if I am in the top 10, then why am I in the top 10? Because I need to fight with strong guys. In the match with Gasparini, he said that I was not...
SPEAKER_01: prepared enough uh i didn't rest enough he said so uh it was like three days what he was resting before the match and that was the main reason he says that
SPEAKER_01: And I will take my revenge on this match with Gasparini. And if I had not this trauma in my wrist, I would be the number first, he says that. Okay, so he's saying that he wants to beat Jerry now. After Jerry, he wants to beat Hermes.
SPEAKER_02: Yes. He is the second best right now in the world after Levan. You are probably following, right? What's happening in the world, you know, about like what was happening in top eight and then what's happening in Dubai, what's happening in Istanbul. And we just saw the Devon versus Levan match.
SPEAKER_02: how do you see how do you see that that that top 10 guys around there like do you see do you think that leon is right now deservingly number one and if yes and then how do you see the rest of the guys and how do you see yourself amongst these guys
SPEAKER_02: No, no, no, I'm asking Jerry. No, no, David, I'm asking Jerry. Oh, shit, I'm sorry. I thought you were asking him. No, no, no, I'm asking, you know, you are following, you know, what's going on, you know, last a few years, four years, you know, in 2019, Top 8 was there.
SPEAKER_02: and now istanbul event dubai event and recently we saw devon and uh like do you think that the one right now deservingly like number one guy and and do you think he can be possibly the strongest ever do you think it's possible and like how do you see the other guys like in top 10 and how do you see yourself you know compared to these people okay
SPEAKER_04: I did watch that match, obviously, with Devin and Levon, and it proved to me, you know, that he deserves that top spot. I don't think he's unbeatable, but I do think that right now he's at a higher level than most. And I think that, you know, my focus is... Higher level than most or higher level than all?
SPEAKER_02: Right now, I think he's at the highest level right I think he's. He is higher level than most you said when you say most it means that there are some people around the level is there anyone like that, in your opinion. um.
SPEAKER_04: Is there anyone that I think would go in there and beat him? No, we're not right now. Right. I don't think anyone's going to go in there and beat him right now, but I think he's beatable. Right. I think you just have to be committed to training and bringing it, you know, being devoted to it. And then no one is ever unbeatable.
SPEAKER_04: and um but i think he definitely let's say on a scale of one to a hundred he's out like 95 right right now there's the next closest person is only like a 93 right so they're not there yet they have to level up but there's plenty of um uh i think
SPEAKER_04: think my style would be tough with lavan right and um i think that um i haven't seen him like i i know that um ganadi uh he cannot he was the last person to beat him right uh i i think yes i think yes yeah i think yeah i think he got his second in 2017 was against him yeah yeah i mean before before he came to pro he has some losses
SPEAKER_04: But after Paul, he didn't even lose any even round. No, I know. And there wasn't even one that was on the wrong side of the table. Right. So that's what I said. I think he's right now. He's proven that he's number one. And I don't think anyone's at the same level as him. But I think there's people that are that are chasing and that could be there. I don't know. Like, I haven't seen Vitaly pulling in a bit. Right. So.
SPEAKER_02: he just pulled in russia and i went he lost to sly and sly beat him very convincingly but lalitin didn't look like in a super shape but maybe he was maybe sly was incredible so we don't know yet who's the who's the one that just pulled in uh in one he beat trubin and he beat uh it was it was a vitality
SPEAKER_04: yeah no slave slave with both vitally and trubin yes yes okay so yeah now is it that guy right is he that good but is he that good or is it that trubin was just not not healthy yet and uh vitality was off i i i don't know we will find out answers all these questions once the
SPEAKER_02: The ban on Russian athletes are lifted and then they can pull with the rest of the world, and we will we will find out if that item was in a bad shape. or but let it can also be to be very easily or maybe slide was an incredible shape we don't know this level also looking credible, so we will soon see, but I from what I understand it.
SPEAKER_02: like you in for yourself even though you are not saying that you you can beat leon but you are saying that your style may be difficult for him if it is applied strong enough right i think so it's good it's good that you know every superhero weight at the elite level should have that mindset i mean even if they lose nobody should go to the table oh i'm gonna lose or something you know i mean you need to believe yeah
SPEAKER_04: your body does what your mind thinks it's gonna do, right? If you think you're gonna lose, you think you're gonna win, you have a much better shot at winning, right? So if I commit to committing to it because I intend on winning, right? And, you know, demolished in any match, right? I've never, never not won.
SPEAKER_04: uh, at least, uh, one or two matches. Right. So very few people have beat me, uh, in the world. And, uh, so having that said, I think that, uh, you know, and I've been doing it for a little bit. Right. So I think that, uh, um,
SPEAKER_04: I'm going to bring everything I can to the table and prove to be that dark horse that upsets the order, you know, the one to five. Because the reason I shouldn't be in the top five, and I've got the wins on Mike, you know, and I've got, you know, I've got what it takes. So we're going to see, right? I mean, it's all bullshit to do it.
SPEAKER_02: I have a question for you. Some days ago, Arsene was my guest, Arsene Leliev, and Raimonds was translating, and he said something about Devon and Levan and everything, but I think that some things were lost in translation. So one of the Russian guys, I think armwrestling Mishurin or something, he asked me if he could use two minutes of that
SPEAKER_02: uh interview and i said okay and then i saw that he put on his uh youtube page and he translated then then he translated in a different way whenever i check it arsene said that leon did not beat number two guy in the world he said that devon may not be even in top six seven in his opinion
SPEAKER_02: Do you agree with this or do you think that Devon that we saw in Dubai is the number two guy in the world from the shape that if you measure? Now, Devon and I are friends and he told me he felt incredible going into that tournament.
SPEAKER_04: in contrast when i watched him in that tournament that to me didn't look like the strongest devon right it didn't look as though he was uh the devon of old right to to me he looked he looked thinner he looked smaller i know he weighed in at what 280 or something but uh i don't know he looked leaner and uh he didn't put enough mass on right so yeah
SPEAKER_02: right so i don't know if that version of devon is in that you know top three or four i don't know right i i was you are thinking that the day when you saw in dubai probably is not the number two guy in the world that's what you're saying right right i understand yeah okay and and and david can you ask the same thing to gennady where would he rank devon right now in the world
SPEAKER_01: with the shape that he saw in Dubai. Gena, I would like to ask you, how do you think, what do you think will happen in Dubai? What do you think? What do you think will happen? What do you think will happen? Well, it's a very interesting question.
SPEAKER_00: In reality, it is a sport, and it is possible to say that it is probably the fifth most popular sport in the world. I think it is the fifth most popular. In reality, it is the fifth most popular. In reality, it is the fifth most popular. In reality, it is the fifth most popular. In reality, it is the fifth most popular. In reality, it is the fifth most popular. In reality, it is the fifth most popular. In reality, it is the fifth most popular. In reality, it is the fifth most popular.
SPEAKER_00: But he was a great sportsman. Michael Todd was a great player. Michael Todd was a great player and a great coach. And Michael Todd was a real man. And why was this man my father? I don't know. Why did he have to be my father? I don't know. If he had been my father, I would have known.
SPEAKER_00: I gave him millions of money, but he didn't give it to me because he wanted to get rid of me and Marjona Khil. I told him that if he was going to be in the top 3 of the Magadamia, I was going to be in the top 3. I told him that I was going to be in the top 3. I told him that I was going to be in the top 3. I told him that I was going to be in the top 3. I told him that I was going to be in the top 3.
SPEAKER_00: So Gennady said that I can't really say what
SPEAKER_01: I think that maybe under five. So under the five. So he said that maybe top five or top six. And after that, he also said that if we look at the results, Devon Larratt, whom he was defeating in the last years,
SPEAKER_01: He defeated John Brzenk. We know that John was a great, great star of all time in the world, but right now he is not in that good shape.
SPEAKER_01: uh if we see if we look at the um back uh he defeated michael todd so i also defeated michael todd uh ray was also with michael todd so uh how he can be over the five top five if he wants to uh be in the top three uh firstly he must me he must defeat me he says that
SPEAKER_02: Oh, okay. I understand. And there is a honest critic. I didn't ask your first question. If you want to find out the answer of the question, you can privately ask those people. And but you can ask another question, which are super good. I will ask that without you doing anything. You don't need to pay.
SPEAKER_02: Honest Critic is asking, how much do Gennady and Jerry do for wrist curl and bicep curl? Jerry, do you do wrist and bicep curl? How many kilos? Do you work hard on them? Yeah, I do wrist curls and bicep curls I do a lot.
SPEAKER_04: Wrist curls, I do off the table. So my wrist hangs off and then I curl it back up with 120 pounds. Okay. And the bicep?
SPEAKER_04: bicep, I got the machine, right, and like two, what is it, 215, 215 pounds, one arm for sets. Like, you know, 10, 12 times. Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: do you do you remember that you you put your arm to the wall and i was in one arm pull up on your arm you know when you put on the state on the wall like this it was it was very hard to give up because it's not like like it's not like balance you know the arm has different shape and your arm is so thick it was so hard i mean for me it wasn't so hard because i always do even on the tank barrel you know that that
SPEAKER_02: one-armed pull-ups but you know it was that was interesting it was 1998 nebraska you competed the nationals that i came there to watch you remember that wrong but um i remember i i was just watching yeah it was incredible yeah and so i think i think we we uh do you know where kennedy went david
SPEAKER_01: uh he also said that yeah uh i will the battery is low so i will took the charger and i will come back he said that oh he will come back soon okay okay so let's go and also something i remembered what did you say he saw me run away yeah yeah
SPEAKER_02: oh it's okay run away yeah i mean i mean just you know you know how to use the light jerry you know where to sit you know where to where where you like sit and to make the light like your shoulders and everything you look really uh scary but but these guys all from over here you know like georgia and you know people around here they are not so easily intimidated by the look you know these guys are
SPEAKER_02: mentally mentally strong guys i'm sure you are mentally strong too but so but you really look very scary under the light that you know the shoulder you know like watermelon that's why those shoulders yeah you look you look incredible yeah yeah i'm i'm expecting a very good match i'm expecting and the question to you jerry like which one do you think is a tougher opponent for you hermes
SPEAKER_04: or Gennady? Ermes. Ermes is tougher? Yeah, because I think Ermes has the better top roll. And I don't think anyone's going to beat me inside. Everyone's move is to go outside. And I think Ermes is... But how about, Jerry, that some people do shoulder pressures over you and then just to bring your arm here. Sometimes you... If I'm out of shape...
SPEAKER_02: what's that if i'm out of shape it's only happened twice right and both times i saw devon doing one time i saw devon doing it during one round and uh like we we started with the shoulder pressure and then i saw from 10 to 11. he started he was he was already turned in if you look at that
SPEAKER_04: Me and Devin, our match, every winner was this side of the table. The side shoulder was away from Bart, right? The head ref. That person, because Bart was focused on the inside shoulder, not the outside shoulder. So every match started turned. Yeah. Yeah. But, I mean, why didn't your match, you know, his movement and then just also
SPEAKER_02: whenever you felt like you know he was going there like were you late or you wanted you expected the ref to make it squared also i missed the go right like so you missed the go okay so if i missed the go and someone gets the jump then i'm you know i got pissed right so i understand yeah so so you are saying that that is not possible gennady
SPEAKER_02: to do something like that and uh get a result positive result for himself inside yeah like like doing the same same thing that you know uh devon devon tried no no he he goes inside he's going down just as quick as michael todd did yeah yeah uh my michael tried to do the same thing to you we did a shoulder press right away
SPEAKER_02: First match. First match. That didn't work. Yeah, whenever, whenever, whenever also Todd Hutchings wanted to go, you know, like inside, you know, it didn't end up good either, you know. Same thing Matt Nass read it too. Many, many have, most have failed. I understand. So I was thinking that, you know, maybe Gennady would try such thing, but you are saying that Gennady is the only way is outside. That's what you're saying. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Can you ask Gennady, does he agree that, you know, I was thinking that maybe Gennady would try a shoulder press against Jerry, but Jerry is saying that it is impossible for him to get a result from there. His only chance is outside. Does Gennady honestly, like, does he agree with that?
SPEAKER_01: I mean, I think that all the press knows that it can happen, and that's why they think so much about it. What do you think, Triton? How did it happen? With who? With Jerry. With me? Yes, yes. You know, it doesn't make sense.
SPEAKER_00: In our country, we don't know how to use these techniques. We don't know how to use them. We don't know how to use them. We don't know how to use them. We don't know how to use them. We don't know how to use them. We don't know how to use them. We don't know how to use them. We don't know how to use them. We don't know how to use them. We don't know how to use them.
SPEAKER_01: So, Gennady is saying that I can't really say that what I'm going to do when I'm going to go in the table, when I'm going to pull. I can't say that what I'm going to do. When I stand in the table, on the table with...
SPEAKER_02: uh jv or someone else uh after that i will see i will no i'm not saying i'm not saying try or not but does he think that there is a possibility for him to go inside and win is there any possibility okay i mean i'm just i'm not saying that he will try or not try but i mean does he see there is there is no way possibility or does he think that this is very hard to go there
SPEAKER_01: As you said, I think it is possible to say that it is possible to say that it is possible to say that it is possible to say that it is possible to say that it is possible to say that it is possible to say that it is possible to say that it is possible to say that it is possible to say that it is possible to say that it is possible to say that it is possible to say that it is possible to say that it is
SPEAKER_01: So, Gennady said that before the trauma, I was doing that technique with everyone. In the match with Michael Todd, when I needed that technique, I used it.
SPEAKER_02: In general, he said that I try not to use that technique, but if it's important, if I need it, I will use it. He said that. I understand. Also, the one guy asked him, you know, the question that how much can you do wrist curl and bicep curl with kilogram? Can he tell us how much weight can he do? Because there was a super chat. This is for Gennady, right?
SPEAKER_01: Yes, yes, we are already asked to share, yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So he's asking that in what kind of motion? What about on the dumbbell or what can you do? Just ask him in which way can he do? .
SPEAKER_00: For example, in Trinazor, for example, in Tsona-Tsona, which has a weight of 40 kilos, in Tsona-Tsona, in Trinazor, there is nothing like in Nakhikvari, where in Tsona-Tsona, the weight of 40 kilos is the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the weight of the
SPEAKER_01: So Gennady said that on the machine, when he can do this on the machine, that he's doing 70 kilograms. He's saying that
SPEAKER_01: it is not like uh it when it goes uh half weight it is uh 70 kilogram he's doing like that yeah on the seated uh style in the biceps yeah he does um
SPEAKER_00: 95 in the biceps he's doing uh 95 no no 85. 85 kilo but but the half motion right half motion uh
SPEAKER_02: so he said that uh how am i doing uh that uh 985 kilogram i will send you video he's saying that okay okay the last questions i will ask and i will finish jerry since you did not pull any supermass since 2019 excluding your own self can you tell us your top five in the world right now
SPEAKER_04: With me out of it? Yeah, because you didn't pull lately, but you will, we will find out soon where you are. Okay. The top five behind me, um, would be, uh, uh, Lavon. Yeah. Then, uh, Hermes, then, uh, Gennady. Yeah. Um, and then, uh,
SPEAKER_04: Do you exclude Russians for a reason because they cannot pull or they are included in this list? Top five on the planet that I would think. I would think, right? Like I said, Levan, Hermes, Gennady, and then...
SPEAKER_02: What's his name? The one that just beat Vitaly and Trubin, Sabin? Who? Slayev. Slayev. And then Dave Chaffee. Dave Chaffee, your type five. Okay. Okay. So Levan, Hermes, Gennady, Slayev, and Dave Chaffee. This is your top five. Yes.
SPEAKER_00: Can you ask him Geno's top five? Okay. Geno, can you tell us which one is your top five? Leo, this is the first one for all of us. I don't know what the second one is. The second one is for me, because the second one is for my boss, who is also a Kurd.
SPEAKER_00: This is how it works. Levani, Mehe, Hermesi, Meremobis, Chephida, and Rewazi. Rewazi, right? Rewazi, yes. Rewazi is in the 18th century.
SPEAKER_01: So, Gennady said that I really don't think that Gasparoni is on the second place. I think that Levan is first. After that, I am number two. Then was the... Ermes.
SPEAKER_00: Yes, Hermes and Chieftain were in the same team. Hermes and Chieftain were in the same team. Okay, so Hermes is three, Dave is four, and then the fifth is Rewaz. That's what you said. Rewaz, yes. But these three teams are very similar. I really like that Dave is Chieftain and Rewaz is in the same team.
SPEAKER_01: he said that in this uh three of them uh it is very difficult to say who is who we yeah who is the level i really wanted to dave and revazi would fight you know yeah i think maybe maybe in november yeah maybe i mean it depends you know the results that they will have uh
SPEAKER_02: um okay i asked the opinions to uh opinions of jerry about these upcoming matches when we do do uh the other podcasts about a montego but if i ask if you if you met just again can you ask him what he thinks like for example but quick not not not so long analyzes but like touching versus who is winning just tell him ask him to tell the winner
SPEAKER_01: . So he's saying that 60% of .
SPEAKER_02: So Tatachins is his favorite, okay. And John Brzenk and Ongarbaev, Gennady. 60-40, John Brzenk wins, he says. John Brzenk. And Devchev versus Morozov.
SPEAKER_00: David Chaffee and Morozov. David Chaffee and Morozov. He says that David Chaffee will win. Will win, huh? Yeah, okay, yeah. I understand, yeah. And Krasimir versus Irakli? Krasimir and Irakli. I think Irakli will win. I think Irakli will win. I think Irakli will win. I think Irakli will win. I think Irakli will win. I think Irakli will win.
SPEAKER_00: I am not a Georgian, but I think that it will be.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, now tell him that I'm going to ask him a question. He will tell me the answer in percentage. Tell him. Okay. Okay.
SPEAKER_01: He said that Jerry has problems. What? He said that Jerry has problems. Oh, Jerry has problems. But what's the percentage? Tell him honestly, tell me. .
SPEAKER_00: First of all, I am very happy with the result. David Sheffy, as you know, is a very good player. He is a very good player. I am very happy with the result. I am very happy with the result. David Sheffy, as you know, is a very good player. He is a very good player.
SPEAKER_01: So he doesn't say it's about, he is not saying percentage. He says that I respect my opponents and I came to win. So that is what he's saying. Yeah, but he said that Jerry is in trouble. Yeah, and Jerry is in the trouble. He says that. Okay, Jerry. Yeah, Jerry, just come and prove. Come and prove yourself. And yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And ask Gennady another thing. Is he intimidated by the look of Jerry under that light? What I would like to say is that it's a matter of time before we get to the end of the show. Jerry, what do you have to say?
SPEAKER_02: my muscles are better so yeah anyways so let let let i'm i'm yeah i'm i'm closing i'm closing the the this uh interview i'm finishing usually do you want to add anything my friend anything that you wish
SPEAKER_02: We see you in four weeks in Istanbul and you would like to say anything about anything that we talked that you wanted to say something but you didn't. I'm excited to have this match and I'm happy that it's Gennady because I do think he's really good.
SPEAKER_04: Um, so I am going to give it 100%, but I'm traveling a long way and that, that travel that I'm doing, I'm not doing it to lose. I'm going there to win. So, uh, I'm going to bring everything I can and I'm going to give it a hundred percent and, uh, I feel confident. So I know it's going to be a war, but I'm prepared. Can you translate that, David?
SPEAKER_01: Yes, of course. I think it's important to know what you want to do, what you want to do, and then decide.
