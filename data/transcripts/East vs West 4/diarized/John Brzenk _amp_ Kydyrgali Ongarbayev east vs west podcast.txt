Engin Terzi: um hello guys no it's not about i couldn't wait but i just wanted to share something with you guys and we can even discuss about it um good to see you guys um i just wanted to share with you guys
Engin Terzi: They are gonna come soon, probably in some minutes. Hello to Georgia. Hello, hello guys. Okay, a little bit more people comes and I will talk about it. It's about calling the, you like T-shirts?
Engin Terzi: Yeah, I like it too. Anyway, so it is about, uh, calling the, uh, some of the like very best matches or East versus West world title. And, uh, some people are just saying that it should only be in the world championships. They mean what? And I agree with them. They say that it is, there needs to be a tournament and world championships and
Engin Terzi: Um, but that, that is the amateur meaning of, uh, world championships that that is a true world championships. But there is also called something called professional world championships. Like for example, if you go to boxing world championships, amateur, you will see there is a tournament. There will be like, you know, called the final final.
Engin Terzi: know okay semi-final and finally it goes but whenever whenever it is the pro events you don't see like george foreman joe fryser uh muhammad ali they just compete the tournament and then you know you know meeting each other and elimination style and then they just go up like this they don't they don't it's a combat sport so in the combat sports in the professional events there are rankings
Engin Terzi: And then the world world title is determined by, uh, uh, title match between two best athletes. And some people says that yes, pilot super matches. Yes. Uh, while did not really offer a lot international, you know, they usually choose people who can speak, uh, English, but I didn't see any Eastern months monsters there, you know?
Engin Terzi: Um, yes, I had some world title matches and I agree. Like, for example, if, if Pushkar is pulling there, if Rustam Boba, if John Brzing is pulling, that is heavy enough. They say, but East versus West is not open to everyone. It is open to everyone. It is open to every best Atlas. They, they get invited. They have their chance to pull and they have their chance to climb up to the title as well. You know, it's not that I'm not invited.
Engin Terzi: uh that they are coming i mean if chelsea is not determining the best 70 kilo if bojidar samushi is not determining the best 80 if any match with sasho or any matches with tatar things on garbaya zirakashvili john of course there is rustam but rustam cannot compete if rustam wanted to compete he cannot compete world championship either because the ukrainian situation it has nothing to do with me and also about the russian that's the same because of the war you know
Engin Terzi: not because they are not allowed to compete. And when you have events, like every event can have one title matches, you cannot have like many people competing. Like for example, John Brzenk is pulling Ongar Bayev, Brzenk is pulling Tata Ching, Egle is pulling Gabriela, Bozhidar is pulling Samushia. I mean, so this is, and just because they pull
Engin Terzi: Roozbeh Gharakhloo, title match, it does not mean that they will hold the title forever, you know if somebody is good enough, he will be invited to I mean. Roozbeh Gharakhloo, Who is not invited, you know, and who is the best very, very, very best our message in his category that is not invited here. Roozbeh Gharakhloo, I mean the only we didn't see live on with the very best or super every category other than that you see like those guys are like you know as good as possible. Roozbeh Gharakhloo, yeah.
Engin Terzi: no there will be i mean i shared many times there will be a there will be a helmet and with a with a uh um yes yes i i talk with i talk with
Engin Terzi: I told me, I mean, what I don't understand that, you know, some people, I'm not going to name it. They say like, they have like 20 something world titles and they win all of those in their own country against the same country, man. And they called nobody question. And then the, whenever they're touching some pruning is fully like, how can you question that? There is the, how can you question Gabriela versus, uh, Gabriela versus EGL match? Uh, hello. Hello.
Engin Terzi: Salam alaikum, can you turn the phone sideways? Yeah, your phone, yeah, needs to. Yeah, you need to. Assalamu alaikum. Wa alaikum salam. Wa alaikum salam. Yeah. Anyways, I think that you need to
Engin Terzi: play with those options. Is that all right? No, it still shows you. Not sideways, but it's okay. So your phone needs to load.
Engin Terzi: I mean, that way, not this way, but that way, but yeah. Anyway, so let me. I don't know how to go in English.
Engin Terzi: you will have one of these yeah i saw it i saw it this is this is for the winner winner of you and john bersink which is the world title match 100 kilo
Engin Terzi: good good that's good uh you have translated with you you have translators yeah yeah okay that's good yeah yeah can you uh can you ask him uh how is he doing how how has he been yeah john is here as well
Kydyrgali Ongarbaev: Alhamdulillah. Alhamdulillah, everything is good. Yeah, everything is fine. Yeah, how is his form now? Like you see, he's in his best shape. Yeah. Yeah, everything is good. Excellent. Yeah, so he's as good as
Engin Terzi: near to his uh top eight shape or not yeah alhamdulillah is everything is going uh on plan and uh we're doing as well as we do and doing everything so he is ready to compete against john yeah
Engin Terzi: yeah it would be better if you ask him hello john you hear us yeah i'm clear how's it going yeah hey it's nice to see you john yeah so how are you john
John Brzenk: I'm doing better. Been fighting this little bug that I've had for almost two weeks now. And I think I'm getting over it. My body's not hurting as bad as it was last week. But I'm still recovering from the Corey match. Is it possible that you turn the sound a little bit up? Is it possible?
John Brzenk: Yeah, so I tried to increase the sensitivity before I started, but I didn't see an option for it because I had a problem with that the last time. Obviously, my microphone sucks. Yeah, I hardly hear you yet. Let me see. Let me try to... No, it's better when you get closer. It's better when I actually get right up next to it and talk to it.
John Brzenk: Yeah, I wish I could figure out how to do the sensitivity, but I haven't been able to do that. Anyway, so yeah, no, I'm feeling okay. I'm glad I still have two weeks to do hot tubs and massagers and stuff like that. I would definitely be concerned if we were pulling this weekend.
John Brzenk: yeah yeah yeah it would be it would be a problem so do you think that you will be rested and recovered well yeah i hope so i'm uh like i said i'm i'm finally starting to get over this bug and um yeah i mean two weeks normally is enough time for me to you know to rest i'm not planning on doing anything now between now and uh in the tournament so um if if things are you know like they used to be normal healing and recovery i should be okay
Engin Terzi: Yeah. I mean, as I told you privately, you know, like for one year you have been probably competing more than anyone else. Yeah. On this search. I mean, in, in that level, in that level, I don't think anybody has completed, maybe, maybe Tatashny Central. And I don't think that, you know, by resting, I remember years ago, you told me that, you know, if you are very, very, very well trained, you know, even three weeks of doing nothing, you know, it wouldn't take anything from you.
John Brzenk: It's what you were telling me, I remember. Right, yeah, no, it's getting, yeah, it's definitely getting to the point now, back to my old self, where it's more important that I'm rested and healed than I am being in shape. I mean, before it was all about trying to get back in shape, but now I'm at a pretty high level where I'm just trying to not hurt myself. I mean, you don't need to...
John Brzenk: yeah you are you are already up there you know like just resting is not gonna hurt you you don't like it's not like you are losing time or something more you rest i think yeah no but sometimes i sometimes i get into the uh the the thought of you know doing light blood flow type workouts um and i'm not i'm not even positive in my own mind if that actually helps or hurts me i mean
John Brzenk: I'm, I'm, I'm, you know, in the past I would just do absolutely nothing, cold turkey, nothing. Um, and that's always worked. But as I've, you know, as I've gotten, um, people have told me, no, you need to do this and you do that. It helps the healing process. So I've been kind of messing with those ideas, but.
Engin Terzi: I still don't concrete have him in my mind like, yeah, this is the best approach for a big man. I think as long as you don't do over, if you don't overdo it, I don't think it will hurt you. If you have some pain, it will help some blood flowing. But when you do a lot, then it is,
Engin Terzi: Like your body may adopt that kind of feeling and that there's no good either, you know, because where do you go? You need to really adapt for something tough, you know, but if you do a lot of lightweights and then, then, then it's no good, you know? I mean, you can train for like a hundred meters by running 10 kilometers every day, you know? Yeah.
John Brzenk: so we'll see it's still like it's still a you know theory there there's no concrete you know right right way i think everybody's still trying to figure out the best way for them so um it it evolves for sure so but we'll see yeah i'm like i said i'm looking forward to the match so yeah yeah and can you ask uh like how he feels that you know he's gonna face john in two weeks what kind of feeling uh he has
Engin Terzi: Sorry, can you repeat the question? Can you ask Kydyrgali what kind of feeling it is to know that he is going to face John Brzee in two weeks? Okay.
Kydyrgali Ongarbaev: I think that John is a legendary person and a legendary in arm sport and I respect him and I think time has shown us what kind of wrestler he is and it will be great arm sport for us.
Engin Terzi: and I'm gonna do everything to do it's the most interesting the most grateful sports and ground for everyone I understand so we can't we can't really wait to and and can you tell him you know honestly like how he sees his chance against John uh
Kydyrgali Ongarbaev: It's going to be normal as we used to do against everyone. And we do it normally as we used to before. No, no, that's not what I'm asking. What I'm asking is how he sees his chance, winning chance against John. Does he see a chance? I understand.
Interpreter: How much will you give me? We are Kazakhs. I don't have time for that.
Kydyrgali Ongarbaev: I don't know the chance, what the chance and what the percentage will be. I'm just doing my best and I hope that the best we're going to win. The best one is going to win. He doesn't like to talk a lot, John, huh? But he's a very respectful guy. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: Well, that's all we can do, really, when it comes down to it, is just come at our best and hope it's enough, you know? Yeah, yeah, yeah. You remember, John, you were originally going to pull Irakli, but Irakli lost against Todd, and then in the press conference, Friedrich was saying that the toughest opponent for him would be Irakli. And then you said that Todd is going to beat Irakli in
Engin Terzi: and then Todd is going to beat Prudnik in August, and then you two are going to prove that you two will be the pulling in the U.S. to prove that. I think you were a little bit provoked when Prudnik discounted you and Todd, like, you know, that the most important, most strongest is there directly. And then you kind of felt like you had to answer something.
Engin Terzi: You still believe that you and Todd are going to be the ones that are going to pull to determine the best one? Well, yeah. Todd's already proven half my point by meeting directly.
John Brzenk: Yeah, I mean, Todd and I are definitely the biggest threats to Prudnik as far as the West goes. I mean, we'll see. Time will tell. It's coming up here shortly, the first part of the test. Hopefully he'll succeed. And then we're slated for...
John Brzenk: for the match in November, December. November, right? November, yeah. That will be a breath-cutting, yeah. Same as the...
John Brzenk: Where do you see Ongar Boye? Where do you see him? Well, his right arm looks full. He looks strong. He looks healed. His right is definitely bigger than his left. Maybe that's the position he's in. I'm expecting a great match from him. I mean, he's young. He's proven himself against the very top heavyweights. He's explosive. That's always a danger for me.
John Brzenk: I watched some of his matches and his style is very similar to mine back when I was a younger age. So I know how dangerous that can be and how if you're explosive and have no pain, it can be a very effective move.
John Brzenk: I'm expecting a shocker after the go. So I'm just hoping to be able to slow it down and be able to figure out a way to, you know, have the match, you know, go a little bit longer distance. But yeah, I see Ongarbaev as good, if not better than Prudnik. So this will be a huge test for me for sure. Yeah, it looks like he proved his outside skill.
Engin Terzi: being better than Prudnik's when they pull it top eight. When they both go outside versus outside, Ongarbaev was better. He top rolled Prudnik. Prudnik managed to win with a hook move. And so, yeah, so I kind of think that he is going to go outside with you and he will be in an outside battle. This is what I expect from your match here.
John Brzenk: So you also expect, yeah. Yes, I'm hoping that that match is going that direction is successful for me because I've also watched him pull numerous guys in a hook. And he seems like he's got a great defensive hook and great endurance. So I really don't want it to go there. I'm really hoping that our match doesn't end up falling into a wrist to wrist because I think that'll turn out badly for me. So
John Brzenk: um, yeah, I'm hoping that I'm going to be able to hang with his top roll and, um, and have better side pressure and be able to, you know, maintain some, somewhat of, you know, type of control. Uh, but yeah, time will tell. Um, I will switch it up if, if, if I fail with a top roll, I don't know if I have the, the downward, uh, hooking hand control capability that Prudnik, uh, has. So I'm not sure that that would be successful, but,
Engin Terzi: uh yeah i mean there's gonna be i think probably things are gonna change up a little bit throughout the throughout the super match yeah i i have a question for you when you put corey west did you go there with like having a mind to hook him right away or you felt his hand staying before the go and then you
John Brzenk: you suddenly decided to go inside. No, no, no. I, he put me inside. I, I, my mindset was always from the beginning to the end is to try to top roll him to put, always put pressure on his hand. So I never, I never came across aggressive, uh, to try to get on his bicep to, to basically hook from the start. I was always trying to go backwards and which put me out of position. Um, but my arm strength was, was enough to be able to hold off the surge. But,
Engin Terzi: Yeah, no, I didn't purposely ever go into a hook. He pretty much forced it into a hook. But whenever he hooked you, you did not seem like you were trying to top roll and open like this. It seems like you realized that in your position, you realized that you couldn't top roll him. So once he's going to control you, suddenly move there, you know? Like you were not stubborn to...
John Brzenk: Yeah. It was almost like a, it was almost not really a top roll hook, but a bicep hook. So I was coming up, up trying to protect and, and, and basically wear down his surges. I didn't feel like I had any confidence in the lat drag to actually pull on his bicep to get him in the, in a defensive position. I was just trying to get him to wear himself out by his, you know, his surges. So
Engin Terzi: It didn't look like I was trying to top roll maybe once it got to the point where it was a full hook, but I was still always pulling, you know, forcing the match up with a high hook. I understand. I understand. I understand. Yeah. Yeah. So at the beginning of the program, we asked Kıdır Gali if his shape was as good as his top eight shape.
Engin Terzi: And I think I didn't really understand the answer. Like a few years ago, he pulled successfully against even Levan. You know, of course, Levan beat him without much problem, but he performed better than what people expected. And so I know that he had some shoulder injury and even had a surgery. And from that shape,
Engin Terzi: to this shape. Where is he now? Can you ask him, you know, if his shape against Levan was 100, where is he at now, in his opinion? I don't understand. I don't understand. I don't understand.
Interpreter: Thank you.
Kydyrgali Ongarbaev: Yes, you said rightly, that I had a problem two years ago, and they injured my shoulders, but we operated, and yeah, from time to time, we just going better, and my shape is not, will not be lower, I'm doing my best. And now is 105 kilograms.
Engin Terzi: i wait what's that what was the last thing you said uh the kilogram his weight is 105 now oh he's 105 kilogram i understand yeah yeah i understand can you ask him can you ask him yeah okay say
Kydyrgali Ongarbaev: And when I wrestled with Levan, I didn't have any problems with my shoulders. But after it, I had it. And we just recovered. And it's going well. I understand. And can you ask him what caused that injury? David it happen during a match or during the training? I don't know.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, we had an injury when I was wrestling with Prudnik. Oh, Prudnik. Oh, okay. I understand. I understand. Yeah. So it must be a very tough match for him. So it is good that, you know, he is in good shape right now. He is ready to pull. And we saw that he lost. He lost at the Kazakhstan Championships. But he got the revenge in the...
Engin Terzi: uh asian championships and also there was another kazakhstan championships that he won and he looked he looked in very good shape what was his opponent's name i forgot what was the final guy
Engin Terzi: Yeah, he seemed very dominant and looks like he's coming back. Yeah, that's good. That's good, yeah. John, I know that you gave your thoughts about some other matches as well. I think you were a guest for Kurdeyka. But is there any other match that is taking your attention in this card?
John Brzenk: I mean, they all are interesting. They're all great matches. And again, I mean, which one in particular you want me to comment on? You want me to comment on the big one, the Jerry and Genadi match? I mean, very, very excited to see that for sure. Yeah, I mean, those matches, do you expect any surprise? Do you expect, for example, Morozov to do anything today or not?
John Brzenk: Um, I do. I mean, he's, he improved so much from his first, the first time that I was there when I pulled Zola up to the second time. So, um, I mean, if he is on that kind of trajectory, I have no reason to believe that he can't, can't give Dave trouble for sure. Um, I mean, his, his basic frame is bigger than Dave's. He's got bigger hands, um, probably better, you know, Dave's tough to top roll, but, um, if anybody's equipped, it would be more as a rough. So, uh, we'll, we'll see. Um,
John Brzenk: uh yeah that should be a great match i mean i think if dave controls a match and dave is able to sweep him a little bit to his side of the table that dave will just overpower him and bring him right to the pad but dave's hand has been suspect a little bit i mean if you keep working on it after six rounds you never know so um yeah it's it's definitely a possibility to crack so you have endurance
John Brzenk: endurance concept endurance concept yeah i mean everybody does i mean from just watching his his recent match with ghanadi i mean he he was so dominant so dominant out of the blocks and then kind of faded enough in the mid mid section there that it ended up you know turning the whole whole super match around so uh he just needs to stay can you talk a little bit closer to microphone yeah i'm sorry sorry sorry yeah but i gotta figure out this sensitivity thing so yeah anyway yeah so um
John Brzenk: Yeah, I mean, and with Jerry and Genadi, I mean, Genadi has obviously proven that he is super strong on a hook, so I see no reason for it to go anywhere other than just in a hook. And if Jerry is able to get his shoulder roll in there, if he is able to get behind his arm, I think, you know, it might be interesting for Genadi. But, you know, Genadi can still top a little bit, but I'm not sure if he's aware of it.
John Brzenk: the dangers of top-rolling Jerry Catarat. So that should be very interesting also, just how either one of them play it and how much homework they've done. They're both equally strong in their area. So exciting stuff. Yeah, many, many, many people say that Jerry doesn't have a chance against Genadi, but from what I understand from what you say,
John Brzenk: that you are thinking that if Genadi is ready, then there could be trouble. Yeah, no, I think Genadi, if he doesn't try to top roll off the beginning and stays in a hook and is explosive and gets Jerry separated a little bit, I think that's probably his easiest approach to take the match. But if he's hesitant at all and he lets Jerry get behind his arm, it could be a quick victory for Jerry, so...
John Brzenk: Um, it's going to be just a matter of the start and how things, uh, how aggressive they are at the table to get that offensive position. I understand. I understand. And, and, um, what do you think about, uh, Morozov and Dave Chaffee? I don't know if they hear me. Yeah. Yep. Yep.
Engin Terzi: With you. Yes. And what does he think about Dave Chaffee and Morozov, his countrymen? Can you repeat this? The Morozov, Morozov, Artur Morozov and Dave Chaffee. They will have a super match. What does Ongar Bey think about it? Morozov and Brezhnev will have a super match.
Kydyrgali Ongarbaev: the both sportsmen are good and in excellent shape uh i don't yeah i don't have any uh opposition who gonna win but i think that those men uh are possible to win and i'm just a wish good luck for
Engin Terzi: both men okay so he doesn't have any opinion about prediction but he just think both of them are very strong yeah and does he does he have any opinion about it prudnik and prudnik and tatakins
Engin Terzi: I think that the higher chance has Prudnik. Prudnik is, I think, in my opinion, Prudnik is going to win. But it's not going to be an easy match for Prudnik, but after all, Prudnik will be the winner. So he sees Prudnik as the favorite, I understand, yeah.
Engin Terzi: I understand. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's his status. Yeah. He is the opinion. I was afraid that he was gonna say that he respects all and then good luck. You are the man. Hope you recover. Well, let me show you the best. Yeah.
John Brzenk: So, yeah, between Todd and Prudnik getting back to that match, I mean...
John Brzenk: Yeah, well, I even kind of just lost my thought of what I was going to say with that matchup. If it goes into a hook, I mean, yeah, it could be a long grinder. I think Burnick's going to have to probably post and try to topple Todd's hand. I can't see Todd at this point in his career getting beat directly wrist to wrist in a hook.
Engin Terzi: So we'll see what transpires. I asked Prudnik, are you going to beat Todd? He said, yes. I said, which way? He said, in all ways. I said, including who? Yeah, he said, yes, including who goes throughout.
John Brzenk: Okay, we'll see. Do you think it's possible? I don't think it's possible, but I'll be very impressed if he's able to do it. I mean, if he does it, it's going to be a long match that lasts a couple minutes, and I think it would be a point where Todd's hand just burns out. But I've never seen Todd...
Engin Terzi: give up, you know, a wrist-to-wrist hook match. I mean, other than being pressed. Once the match is stopped, right? Once the match is stopped, he's pretty ruthless. Yeah, I don't know why. Like, if you beat Kyle Touching, it should be good enough. You don't have to beat him in a hook, but...
Engin Terzi: Bruno says he's going to do, let's see if he's going to really try. He also said that he's going to do wrist curling with Matt Mask. Remember, he said he's going to do wrist flexing. But do you realize that he tried it. One time he tried, he let it go. But he barely, barely got it back. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He better be in a lot better shape this go-around than he was when he pulled the Matt Mask. He will be. He will be. He will be. Yeah. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: My guess is he will be there about 10, 15% better shape. My guess. Is there a weight cap for the Hutchings match? 107, 107. People say that you can do 110 kilo category. Why do you put 107 limit? It is because I decided to make official weight categories after I set this match. And they agreed with each other, 107 kilo. So we can't really break the agreement. You understand? So that is why, yeah.
Engin Terzi: What's that? Lucky for Prudnik, he's got small legs. He can still make that weight. That's incredible. As big as his upper body is. He will have a hard time to make the weight, trust me. He's asking me what time is the weigh-in, which day is the weigh-in. It's the day before morning, as you and Zola did. Can you ask Ongarbaev,
Engin Terzi: My friend, what does he think about the Iraqi versus Krasimir? I'm curious because these are your possible future opponents. How does he see that match, Iraqi versus Krasimir? They are wrestling with the left or right hand? Right hand, right hand. Krasimir .
Kydyrgali Ongarbaev: uh uh is uh resting now the overhand on the top of the hands and the chance is lower than is used to before no crossing will topple with left arm with his right arm he hooks
Kydyrgali Ongarbaev: I think that's the higher chance I'm going to give to Krasimir. Oh, you're going to give to Krasimir, yeah.
Engin Terzi: John, did you know that they had a certain amount of money offered for them, and they made an agreement that the winner is going to take the 75% of the money and the other one. David you know about that? No, very, very exciting for them to do that. Yeah, this is what Krasimir offered me. Krasimir offered me this. I never told Irakli. And then I made a poll about this match. The poll was after Irakli beat Marcio, so the public was just so much impressed.
Engin Terzi: by iraqi and then the poll result was like 85 percent for iraqi 15 krasimir i think krasimir saw this he didn't like it and he reminded me again did you ask him and i said i didn't but if you want i can and i asked him exactly said yeah why not let's go right yeah and then now they are gonna so how do you see this match
John Brzenk: Well, yeah. I mean, like you like you just mentioned, Reckley looks so, so impressive against Marcio, but not so much against Hutchings. I still think is as impressive as a Reckley looked against Marcio that I think he's I think he's probably ready to take.
John Brzenk: Take Krasimir with the top role. I mean, his arm strength looked pretty dang good against Mauricio. So in Krasimir, the last couple outings I've seen him, he hasn't looked as impressive as the old Krasimir. So if I have to choose, I'm going to have to go with Erekli being the favorite in this one coming up. Mm-hmm. So Ongarbaev says that Krasimir is the favorite, and you say that...
Engin Terzi: Exactly is the favorite in this match, yeah. That's us. And how do you also see that Oleg Zhokh versus Dadikyan left arm? But remember that Dadikyan is from about 115 kilos going down to 102 kilos. Yeah, and I don't know anything about David. I mean, I've just seen a little bit of footage of how well he does left-handed against Denis Saplinkov. During training matches, right? Yeah. But remember, he was my guest. He said...
John Brzenk: Right now, Dennis is 50% of what he was. Right, right. I know David's got great hand control, and he seems to be really strong at controlling the top roll and controlling, you know, getting a hook in with his left. He's super fast, but he's been really, you know, no one's really been testing the last two, three years, so...
John Brzenk: he could come in as a monster. I mean, if he's able to get Oleg's arm at an angle and is able to grab him a little low on the wrist and force that hook, I see him winning. But, boy, that's a tough, tall order, right? Oleg is so awkward with that massive, massive hand and that massive forearm with that top roll. So, yeah, impossible for me to predict. I don't know.
John Brzenk: So you think it's a close match? Anything can happen? No information. Not enough information. Yeah, no. It's going to be close. Yeah, yeah. And can you ask the same question to Ongar Bayev? Please. Yeah. Between
Kydyrgali Ongarbaev: I don't remember the name. It is Oleg Zhokh and David Dadikyan with left arm. We know that Zhokh is good in left arm.
Kydyrgali Ongarbaev: david's we know we all know that david is younger and he's very prospective and he is doing good job in training and in sport and we will see who's gonna be he has no prediction
Kydyrgali Ongarbaev: We don't have the straight position to the one sportsman who actually expects all of them. And then we're going to see who will win. Okay. If he thinks that one guy is going to win, he thinks that it may be disrespect to other guy? Yeah.
Engin Terzi: The one is prospects and the younger. The second one is the good shape in left arm. I understand, yeah. Let me ask you again, where is Oleg living lately? Is he still in Ukraine or where is he at? Yeah, he has been in Ukraine. You said that his lifting numbers are good, but he didn't have a chance to pull at the table. Last week, I think I had an interview with him, and then he said,
Engin Terzi: the same week he was going to pull with some of the strong guys and then see where he is at. So I think that he will, I don't know what was the results of that. What are his, yeah. What are his strong guys? I know, I know he lived kind of out in the middle of nowhere. Does he pull with Petrenko or who does he pull with? I have no idea who he meant, but he said that he's going to go to his friends, the strong guys, and then there he will see himself. Yeah. And,
Engin Terzi: I don't know. I don't know. The guy, the guy is very good natured guy. Very, very friendly guy. Super, super nice guy. I just wish him the best. He suffered a lot and I hope that he is going to come strong. Of course, I don't, I organized the event. I don't, I don't really care who wins, but just, I would, I just wish him the best generally about everything. Yeah. First an accident and now the war and this and that is just not easy, you know, for sure.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, let's see. Let's see how it will be. There are some other. Okay, the most important. I say most important because you pulled both of them in last year. I mean, in a year. Oh, yeah. Last one year. Chance and Zara. Okay, who am I going to ask? Who am I going to ask?
John Brzenk: Chance and Zurab. Chance and Zurab. As long as Chance doesn't top roll too hard, he needs to be fluid and he needs to be aggressive and he needs to aim for the pinning pad when he's top rolling. So not so much hand control because he's going to easily get hand control. He can't top roll too much. He needs to also have that side pressure hit. And I don't see why Chance shouldn't be able to do what I did to Zurab.
John Brzenk: and as long as he's not hesitant and he's not stupid like me and he hits and is offensive and aggressive to the pad, I'm going to say 3-0 Chance. I think Chance has definitely gotten stronger and has definitely the right combination of tools and ability to win this match 3-0.
John Brzenk: yeah how did you how did you see his match with tatashins i was impressed by uh chan's performance yeah no very very good to be able to top roll top but you know like most people you run out of side pressure uh to try to finish but um well the other the other factor that i haven't really taken into account is that chance is pulling ron bath today and that might
John Brzenk: might take a chink or two out of his armor it depends how hard he looks right yeah how hard he pulls if ron pushes his pushes him to the limit um and and if ron wins any of the matches even um i i see that being tough to rebound you know back to full strength in two weeks i i mean i know i was
John Brzenk: I mean, I had Dustin come over yesterday. I did some light pulling after just two weeks after Corey. And I'm still a wreck. I mean, so it's... Yeah, but, John, how will this change? It can definitely make a difference. So I'm just saying that's definitely a factor to take into consideration that Chance might be a little bit beat up. Yeah, and what do you think about Ray versus Ryan? Does Ray have any chance against Ryan? I don't know.
John Brzenk: I don't know enough about Ray. If Ray beats Ryan, it's going to have to be after the go. Ready, one, two, go. One second match. If Ryan's able to stop the match anywhere.
John Brzenk: Well, if he stops the match out of the straps and then hangs on, which I don't see Ryan falling into trying to hang on to a bad position out of the straps, if he goes to the straps and the match stops, I got to go with Bowen. I mean, he's impressed me so much during our practices with his ability to, you know, stop the match and have great endurance, so.
Engin Terzi: It's going to have to be an explosive offensive victory for Ray to pull this off. Can you ask what does it concern him about Jones' abilities? David you understand my question?
Engin Terzi: like where what part about john like does he see dangerous like like his knowledge his experience his like technical abilities his top role the pronator the wrist like what does he concern the most okay okay
Interpreter: I have a question for you. What do you think about the fact that you were born in Sweden?
Kydyrgali Ongarbaev: I think that John, like I said, John is a legendary sportsman. And I think that the experience of John is very high. And he has the skills in every position. He has the skills and the power to protect all the attacks and be in every position.
Engin Terzi: So he is saying that John is ready to answer every attempt of and it will be up to the strength. So this is what he thinks? Yeah.
Kydyrgali Ongarbaev: i think that's yep uh i have and i give uh my position to straight i don't understand did you say everything you wanted to say or
John Brzenk: uh i think that's the i'm gonna give my position to the straight strange okay i did you understand john or no huh but i feel like i i mean i feel like i'm looking at a younger version of myself i mean i think his abilities are very very similar to my own um
John Brzenk: but just younger. So I know he pulls very well outside. He pulls very well inside. So...
John Brzenk: Yeah, and he seems like he's got great guts and great endurance. So I'm somewhat not looking forward to a very hard grinder. I'd rather have somebody that I could take out of position and would give up easily. But it doesn't look like that's going to be this big. Yeah, yeah. Remember his match with Alex Kurdeca? He put him in every position. He still fights. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But that is going to make us...
Engin Terzi: I mean, it's hard for you, hard for him, but for the people who will watch, you know, we will enjoy it. More harder for you, more we will enjoy because it will be a good match, you know? Yeah. Well, I'm hoping it gets into that arena. I'm hoping that I'm just not taken out of, badly taken out of position off the start. That's my biggest fear going into this match, that his explosive
Engin Terzi: um nature will um really cause yeah you know havoc yeah in my opinion you need to keep his wrist flat at all times once he a little bit risker he will hit from here so hard so i think if he hits from here you need to make sure that you also have here then then we will see the worry will be incredible mesh this this is uh my opinion yeah i think and can you ask on that way
Engin Terzi: Just honestly, I know he respects John so much, but does he expect, like, he estimate, you know, a war, like very tough match, or he thinks that it will go either way easy? Either John will win easy, Ongar Bey will win easy, or he is expecting a war from this match? Okay. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
Interpreter: i think that it's going to be war and it's going to be tough fights and i will do my best because i'm training so much and
John Brzenk: will see who will win but i'm gonna do my best yeah yeah i understand his point but he is also expect and john do you expect the wolf i do yeah i do i'm just from watching you know his previous previous matches even when he's in a bad position he guts it out so i i think he's going to be stubborn so yeah we don't we don't we don't see you giving up either when you have the position no
Engin Terzi: like like like i mean like people talked about your endurance only because of the devon match but other than the devon match look at the other matches i mean the only only last one was very very tough because he had so much horsepower and body weight he was just like i mean it was impressive that you you stopped him and you handled that pressure you became so red though yeah yeah yeah no that's that's my worry is uh
Engin Terzi: going into deep matches like that after my first match with Corey, yeah, I actually felt, I actually felt dizzy, you know, and I don't, that doesn't normally happen to me. So the exertion was quite high. I mean, it's. Yeah, but you are a warrior. You just didn't give up. David he push you to your limits? But just remember Ongar is more technical, but I don't think that he has such a horsepower. Not many people in this world have the, that kind of side pressure.
John Brzenk: horsepower that Corey has. Hopefully it's not steady horsepower like that. I mean, I envision or I suspect that Ongarbaev will have better explosive hits. I think he's more dangerous because when he does decide to turn it on, to go,
Engin Terzi: and hit, it's going to be like a little hammer hitting you. Bang, bang, bang. So I'm going to have to be more ready for those quick, hard searches and that steady pressure. I think loading a little bit, loading before the goal a little bit will help. That's my opinion. But he's not like a flash spinner, but he's just also a position gainer with the goal. That's something like that. I don't think he's going to
Engin Terzi: directly go to the pin pad, but he's just going to try to probably put you out of position. This is what he will do. Yeah, I mean, I can imagine. I'm sure that once you hold his hand, you will analyze everything. You will make the right decision, in my opinion. You will win or you will lose. It's all up to the strength after the point. The other guy is not a beginner either. He's also very experienced, smart, well-rounded guy. Looking forward to it.
Engin Terzi: yeah yeah one guy here says that anything giving john advice left my ass over do you do you think that me uh sharing my opinion anyone giving you advice is this something something silly john because people probably think that i'm a beginner or something no of course not i listen to everybody's opinion i i still you know i'd still analyze it and think about it and you know it you know it's gonna affect me for sure but it's not it's not cut and dry it's still up to me and it's still a
John Brzenk: All about, like you said, the feel of the match. I mean, you can go in with a big plan of what you're going to do and then get up to the table. And, you know, it's like the funny saying, you know, you got to put everybody's got a plan until they get punched in the face. And then all of a sudden their instincts kick in and you just do what you normally feel like you got to do. Yeah.
John Brzenk: But do you, do you, do you think this, I am someone that who knows I'm missing a little bit? Oh yeah. You, you know, you know, a few things. So yeah, you've, you've, you've given me advice that I've gone home with and went, Hmm. Okay. Well, I'll give that a try for a while and sure as shit. Hey, wait a minute. That, that does work. That does make me stronger. So yeah. You've, you've analyzed the sport as much as anybody. I'm losing you. You still there?
Engin Terzi: yeah anyway so it was it was it was um so another question then we can finish it is 43 minutes uh obviously is not someone that who loves to do the social media thing he looks he looks relaxed you know yeah yeah you know everyone is you know like um so um
Engin Terzi: So, John, how do you see the world ranking right now in the open class? In the open class? In your opinion. Oh, wow. It's just opinion. We all have opinion. And it doesn't mean that we cannot accept the super matches and we will find out.
Engin Terzi: for sure, you know, who is where, but even when we find out where everybody is ranked for sure, it also can change two months later, three months later, depending on the shape of the person, it doesn't always go. But as of now, how do you see that?
John Brzenk: Well, I mean, what's his name? Silvia? Silvia? Silvia. David you see his last training match? Training match with Vitaly? David you see? No, I didn't see that. Yeah, Vitaly was clearly better. Better, okay. Yeah, but it is only training.
John Brzenk: Okay. Well, I mean, he obviously showed the world in a tournament setting that he was more explosive and stronger than Vitale. So I'd have to put him at probably the number two guy against, obviously, LeVon being the king of the mountain right now. And then from there, you know, I don't know. I just, you know, Vitale's probably possibly three. Does he have enough top role to be able to beat Dave? Yeah.
John Brzenk: Good question is, where does Ermes fall into this? I mean, I know you were possibly setting up a match with Ermes and Dave Chaffee. That would be just awesome. I mean, we'll be able to figure out how much back pressure and how much explosive power Ermes really has. If he can bust Dave open, then we're talking about Ermes as being a possible candidate to do the same against, you know, LeBron.
John Brzenk: um which i believe that would probably be easier with ermy's style to take on someone like lavon with that high hand top roll than to try to out top roll someone as tall as fatali so yeah so it's just kind of confusing right it's they need to yeah
John Brzenk: Yeah, of course. We haven't had enough matches to really determine the top five, six guys, but that's pretty well determined. I mean, and then you've got the unknowns of, like, the Jerry Cataracts and the Genadi. I mean, yes, do they belong in the conversation? Yeah. Do you think that, like, last year Genadi lost against Hermes, but last two rounds he didn't try to pull his elbow back, but he just hit more sideways?
Engin Terzi: It seemed like a little bit hurt Hermes, but Hermes just was 4-0 already, so he did not really kill himself to win the last two rounds. But, you know, since then, Genadi has been competing. He beat Michael, then Dave Chaffee, and now he's pulling Jerry. If he wins against Jerry in November, Jerry, no, Genadi, if he wins, Genadi and Hermes, if Jerry wins, Jerry will be Hermes, he will be.
Engin Terzi: Do you think that, you know, there is any possibility that after, because it was Genadi's first match after many years of being away, do you think that there is possibility that, you know, Genadi may win this time or you think that because Ermes' top reliability is going to beat him again?
John Brzenk: Oh, I think Hermes has definitely progressed in a year. I mean, just using Alex Kordesha as a gauge. I mean, obviously, I mean, it was just practice, but it looks like Hermes has definitely gotten a level up from what he was a year ago or so. So, yeah.
John Brzenk: that would be an interesting match just because I think they, they both gentlemen have improved quite a bit. So, um, if they really improved though, I still got to maybe give the nod to Hermes, especially in the early, early rounds. Uh, you know, Genadi definitely has a better endurance and he can stick it out, but it's tough in a super match when you only get a minute, minute and a half to rest. It's, it's so tough to bounce, you know, to bounce back, but yeah. Um,
John Brzenk: It is also a little bit different than Dubai. In Dubai, you need to win four times to win. In Istanbul, you need to win three times. That one round sometimes makes a difference, right? You can lose a series based on just the first match if you're not careful and calculated. There's a few fine factors that people don't take into consideration that can make all the difference in the world from
Engin Terzi: going through here yeah yeah yeah can you ask ongar before we close how does he see the uh top five or around there like what is his opinion about the best arm masters uh in the world in open class okay
Engin Terzi: Your sound is closed, the microphone. Yeah.
Kydyrgali Ongarbaev: I think there is a lot of sports fans who can beat another, one another to another. But Levan is, I think the top one is Levan. And then what does he think about the others? Like he doesn't have to be in order two, three, four, but who are the other ones that he thinks like in top five?
Interpreter: Okay. Okay.
Kydyrgali Ongarbaev: I think that the other positions is not the 100 for sure because everyone can get and win to another. And I think that in top one, I'm going to get in John's. Top five. Top five. Oh, you think that John is in top five?
Engin Terzi: i appreciate that i have to disagree but yeah he he he may john listen he may mean it or he is maybe making uh hats for himself right right right now yeah yeah yeah yeah i i don't the last thing i will ask you and we will finish um like uh there is there is
Engin Terzi: world championship which is rough and it is like in amateur meaning when i say amateur meaning i don't mean like in a lower is that i tested like real true world championships there especially up to 90 kilo
Engin Terzi: I mean, I don't see anyone touching to WAF athletes. But when you go about there, then you see those LaLatins, Levans, Hermes, Dave, you, you know, in 100, 110, you know, Prudnik and everyone. So, like, whenever I do organize the title matches, like, for example, there is guy, Cherkasov, is the last two times, you know, like, two years, he is the WAF champion in 70 kilo. And Ongar...
Engin Terzi: Bozhidar is the world champion. One before will pull for the title. And I already invited Sasho here before he pulled Irakli. In Irakli, we have athletes like you, Zolev competed, Hutchings, Irakli there, Ongarbaev is there, Prudnik is under 10, you know, Barbosa, all those guys. And in super heavyweight,
Engin Terzi: you know, as you saw, Michael has been here, Dave here, Hermes competed, Jerry competed, Genadi, only Levan hasn't been here and Devon. But as if you say like absolute best, only Levan is missing. So do you think that, you know, it is like this matches, like for example, Gabriela versus Egle. I mean, if in the females, if you will say goat, it would be,
Engin Terzi: Pirinama Keva, Egle Vahid Kute and Gabriela. These are like, both, all of them have more than 20 world titles, incredible athletes, you know, very dominant. Like it is just like almost, I don't know who to compare you, but you're pulling someone at your level, John. So
Engin Terzi: Whenever I say that these are like world title, and then someone says that, you know, it needs to be tournament style, and then there needs to be a tournament open to everyone. But I think these people are mixing the amateur meaning of the world title and the professional meaning of the world title. If you go to world boxing championships in amateur, there is a tournament that they pull and they call the final and semi-final and the final. But when you go to do professionally,
John Brzenk: it's gonna be one-on-one combat match and do you think that this match is here do they carry the weight of being the best guys in the world yes i mean easy easy answer you know yeah yeah they're they're the rank they're proven um these are the guys that go to the waft worlds and and have won
Engin Terzi: dozens of WAF titles so I mean yeah these this is the best of the best and um yeah also it's open to WAF athletes too I mean why didn't the WAF I think they're best as well who's not here you know it's because you cannot get out of Ukraine right and who is not here he is not here not here
John Brzenk: you obviously don't have you don't have the time to be able to run a full-fledged from beginning to end double elimination tournament to determine the best guy on that particular date i mean it's just these guys have to prove themselves throughout the year and and beat the top guys and and win these tournaments and then beat the guys that beat those guys and and and
Engin Terzi: get through the rankings and get, uh, get recognized and ranked. And then, you know, that's who you got. If they are good enough, they will be invited to, you know, of course, you know what I mean? If, if they are good enough, then also like, I also watch wealth and then if they are winning or something, if they are like that dominant, we invite them to the door is open, but not every event I can, I can sit like.
Engin Terzi: Like, I know you understand what I mean. It needs to be one at a time, you know? Like, John and Ongarbaev pulls the winner, and then someone else that we see that they're on that level, he comes and pulls that guy. I mean, nobody is going to forever be the title owner or something. Everyone will have their chance, but they need to prove themselves somewhere, you know? This is what I try to say. But what I'm just saying, like, John, I organized 56 Supermatches, but you see the level. 56 Supermatches in four events.
Engin Terzi: And then there will be more every three months, hopefully. So I am giving enough of a chance to do elite athletes. And if this is not carrying the title, then what is carrying the title? You know what I mean? Correct. But by saying this, I'm not trying to give credit to the event, but I'm just trying to give credit to these athletes that they deserve. You know what I mean, right? I agree with you. 100%, I agree.
Engin Terzi: Yeah. So because they, they just like, I do, I try to do something good. And whenever I do, and then I see the, the months are coming from everywhere or they pulling me down, you know, no, you know, don't let the negative criticism affect your, uh, your, what you're doing. I'm just trying to explain everyone that so people can understand because some people doesn't know some people have bad intention or the people doesn't know. That's why I talk with you. That's what they can understand.
Engin Terzi: But for the bad-intended guys, you can't do anything. You know, just no matter what you do, it will never change. Anyways, so only two weeks left. And I am very, very honored to have you guys. And I think you guys are arriving three, four days before the event. And so just say like 10 days later, we will see you in Istanbul, hopefully. And is there anything that you want to say last before we close, John?
John Brzenk: I'm just super excited. I'm looking forward to meeting you again. Last time was probably two, three years ago in China. I'm just looking forward and excited to compete against someone at your level. He said all these things to Ongar Bey. I don't know if you heard and translated to him. Is there anything that Ongar Bey wants to say before we close?
Interpreter: Okay. I wish to join the success in training and hopefully we're gonna fight.
Engin Terzi: yeah there is two left two weeks left and i'm looking for it hopefully we're gonna see yep anyway so tell him that you know i wish him safe
Engin Terzi: weeks before it was franklin river as a fan i totally agree at this level more titles are made by select matches yes that is how it should be yep thank you for your support my friend john thank you thank you very much my friend it was an honor
John Brzenk: always appreciate the opportunity and um i'm excited to be part of the the third event that i've been able to take part in so yeah it's funny um when you know when igor asked me to pull in the pal 95 kilogram class and i saw
John Brzenk: The kids that were on Gromayev was one of the favorites at the time. I thought to myself, yeah, I'll participate. But I don't expect to do, I don't expect to compete with these guys. In this situation, and now I'm excited. So I feel like I have a chance. It's a completely different situation. I'm actually feeling like, all right, it's going to be good.
Engin Terzi: So the things doesn't go always as planned, but sometimes just life is just. It ends up, it ends up happening anyway. So yeah. Yes, yes, yes. Yeah. But I'm, I'm glad that you are in like almost best shape possible as of now and you're ready to pull. It will be great. Anyway. So thank you very much, John. Thank you. All right. Take care. Thank you. Thank you. Take care, my friend. We'll see you. Yeah. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: Thank you, everyone. Thank you guys
