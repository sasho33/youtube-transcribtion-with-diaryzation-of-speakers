Krasimir Kostadinov: Hello, Krasimir. How are you, my friend? I'm good. Waiting for Irakli and his translator, Roman, to come. So how is everything, my friend? I'm good. Started to train hard from a few days. Yeah, you need it. Just be careful. Sometimes hard is risk.
Krasimir Kostadinov: Well, I hope everything will be fine. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm sure you know what you are doing. I think we are live now. We are live, but just we in Iraqi and translators, Roman. So what kind of feeling is it to be like clearly underdog on the polls, on the community? It is surprising.
Krasimir Kostadinov: for me lately i'm used to be the underdog but usually because i pull super heavy weights yes yes yes right now to pull a hundred kilo guy and to be underdog is very strange for me yes yes yes yes i understand your feeling here most of the people don't uh don't count the losses from the heavyweights i mean they don't care if the guys are heavyweights or
Krasimir Kostadinov: normal guys they take the loft as lost that's it cross you lost his matches recently that's it he's just losing that's not one guy was 150 other guy was 200 kilo yeah they don't care about this the people don't see this yeah but um them to think about you this way is wrong but them to take uh iraqli
Krasimir Kostadinov: seriously is normal i think after his recent reasons yeah like he lost to tatashins but like it was like maybe last round or something but some like especially the round two didn't look like walking in the park for uh tatashi yeah yes yeah true and and marcio i mean
Krasimir Kostadinov: normally around your level but you know the different things you know the styles styles make differences i was surprised how easily iraqi beat marcio that was really surprising for me yeah yeah yeah yeah i did not expect that i didn't i didn't expect marcio to hook him because it's very hard to hook iraqli but i expected him to go back pressure and have a you know war this one yeah yeah
Krasimir Kostadinov: didn't happen yeah it was very strange how easily iraqi took his hand yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i was expecting iraqi to do something to marcio's hand but i was expecting marcio to also do something back and then they would both like be like this like yeah even against like daniel mosier iraqi didn't have the same dominant wrist yes yeah yeah maybe maybe iraqi maybe iraqi
Krasimir Kostadinov: uh strong but maybe he wasn't using that way but he was mostly like you know you know i don't know i don't know i was expecting marcio to win or at least to be a war on the table yeah yeah definitely didn't expect that see after after right after uh iraqi lost against uh against the touchings
Krasimir Kostadinov: Down he came, he said, like, how long should I rest? And he said, he rested only like four days.
Krasimir Kostadinov: I said, Irakli, yeah, maybe you should rest longer. But I don't think that the reason that you lost against Todd Hutchings because of how many days you rest. I mean, as long as you pull that way, you're not going to beat him. You need to really control the pronator of Hutchings that way so he cannot apply so much pressure. As long as he has it here, the pronator, he will always apply that incredible side pressure.
Krasimir Kostadinov: so just taking his risks like can you imagine that you know he's putting all his body side pressure which is incredible and then you are trying to stop him with only brachii radialis you know i mean it's you need to go to solve the problem from its root which is
Krasimir Kostadinov: like separating the forearm from the touching shoulder by controlling his pronator and maybe even rolling his bicep a little bit that way to stretch so that he won't be able to put so much so here how much can you push and here how much can you push hajimura did exactly what he needed to do yes yes but just think this way
Krasimir Kostadinov: i'm not sure he did exactly what he had to do it like as i say without the surface without the straps yeah yeah but if if that match would go because ajumma went totally also out but with very strong finger control in here making him you know sleep in an under position but he did not really dominate his tornado as i am trying to say true true yeah i understand what you mean yeah yeah yeah yeah so if that match would go to strap
Krasimir Kostadinov: of course he didn't go who cares you know people says if it goes step he would win but it didn't happen this is outside of the strap is also arm wrestling it didn't go and hashing uh zole won but you and i we both know if that match was in strap yeah but the thing is that is that he it didn't go to the straps and that's why i said that uh did exactly what he needed to yes yes but you know
Krasimir Kostadinov: also i don't think that iraqli has the same hand dominance without the strap as as haji haji without the strap you know even sasho had a hard time to sleep from his hand kaino had a hard time to sleep from his hand you know it's just a very dominant hand but not like super strong
Krasimir Kostadinov: risk like super strong risk to curl but sometimes if the pressure is applied so far he may also lose the risk you know just you know yes but the hand hand is so strong with haji yeah that's interesting hello hello roman how are you guys i'm doing fine look at this roman is just putting east versus west while what i have here see this this guy is the promoter of this first thank you thank you i have a surprise for you good good good good
Krasimir Kostadinov: I always say, I'm not a promoter, I'm just someone who loves armwrestling. Hey, Krasimir, while we're waiting for Irakli to come, I want to ask you, do you remember the after pool between Jordan and Irakli? Yes, yes.
Krasimir Kostadinov: Now we have two translators. I told Irakli that I was going to bring a translator. Looks like there was a problem with communication. He said that he can bring the translator at 22 time. You understand? Ah, okay. Yeah, Krasimir said that he is available till 8 o'clock.
Krasimir Kostadinov: so i said okay what can we do i will bring the translator for you so that is roman kane and now of course yeah yeah yeah yeah it's good it's good you both are very very familiar in the community yeah yeah but uh i'm free to let roman do the deed uh i can i can say the same okay i'm gonna flip the coin
Krasimir Kostadinov: Tail or head? That's good. I'm happy to see both of you. Yeah. Likewise. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. I was going to ask you, Krasimir. Okay. David Irakli also come? Oh, Irakli is here on the other page. Hello, Irakli. How are you? Just turn this sound on.
Krasimir Kostadinov: no no no no you need to push the button just push the screen we don't hear you probably okay okay yes yes now we hear you how have you been directly congratulations okay who's gonna translate
Roman (Translator): I don't know. I will let Roman. OK, OK. He said that he's doing fine. He also said thanks and also asks, how about you? How are you guys doing? Yeah, we are fine. We were fine, yeah. We were talking about him, behind him. So he came. Now we are more careful.
Krasimir Kostadinov: Yeah, you can keep talking, no problem. He's not gonna be offended. Yeah, I was gonna ask him, I was asking something to Krasimir. I will be very open, you know, you both are my friends and like, do you remember the match when
Krasimir Kostadinov: Jordan Sonev pulled with Irakli after the East versus West. Whenever Jordan wanted to go inside, Irakli didn't try to topple him, but mostly beat that way. So one question is, I will have two questions. One is, does it concern? Because when somebody tried to get out of your hand in the step, it's very hard thing to do.
Krasimir Kostadinov: whenever somebody is just blocking you on the pronator and going over your pronator to the side way that does it like does it uh concern you you know like uh worry you and the other question do you think that there is a possibility that you could take the same risk that you did against alex alex kurdeca
Krasimir Kostadinov: You know what I mean. Do you think that if you realize that there is a possibility that you need to protect your pronator arm and do you think that there may be a need for sacrificing your hand and just continue that way? Do you think this is within the possibilities? So, two things I can say. I believe my wrist is stronger than your dance.
Krasimir Kostadinov: His fingers are longer than mine, and his cupping without the strap is better than mine. But in the straps, my wrist is stronger than his, and also my pronator is better than his. But also, even if he takes my wrist, yes, I believe I could continue pulling with that wrist. You will fight, yeah? I think so. You will be prepared.
Krasimir Kostadinov: i hope to to curl him yeah yeah yeah but so but mentally you will be prepared for any any possibility of course of course okay okay another question when you pull alex kurdeka like were you expecting that like you may need it to pull such way like before the match
Krasimir Kostadinov: or you just you just decided and you had to do it and it never came to your mind before the match because i don't remember you in that way many times yeah the thing is that uh until that point i did not know how good he was he really is actually because uh
Krasimir Kostadinov: In the past, you don't want to beat him very easily at Moldova. And I said that I would just crush him. After the first round, I realized that this guy really leveled up. It was such a war. So you didn't expect such thing, but you had to do it. Can you turn your camera sideways, please? Yeah, thank you. Thank you.
Krasimir Kostadinov: Thank you. I want to ask Irakli. As we said, we were talking a while ago that after he lost against Tatachins, he said that he rested only four days and he was thinking that it may be too short to heal up properly, to rest enough.
Krasimir Kostadinov: Was it the only difference between, of course, Tatachins and Marcio are different pullers, but was it the only thing that he did differently or did he use his wrists more than he usually does against, you know, Marcio? Barboza, yeah, okay. Ira, as you said, we all know that Guitkhar, during the period of the Second World War, was a very good fighter,
Roman (Translator): What would be the conclusion if it was Marcius, and I think Marcius is right, and the next variant would be to say that this pro-Nazi, and I don't really want to argue with you about what the fascists are doing, whatever the reason is.
Irakli Zirakashvili: I was in the army for two or three years. I was in the army for two or three years. I was in the army for two or three years. I was in the army for two or three years. I was in the army for two or three years. I was in the army for two or three years. I was in the army for two or three years. I was in the army for two or three years. I was in the army for two or three years.
Irakli Zirakashvili: I will ask you something, Roman. I didn't ask anything about pronation. How did the pronation come into the question that you asked him?
Krasimir Kostadinov: uh uh i will explain he was talking about um no no no it was in your question as well that that's why i'm saying that i didn't ask anything about the pronation okay whatever you tell me
Roman (Translator): Yeah. So he said the main difference was his preparation. He tried to make his mistakes not happen anymore. He dropped his weight down because of endurance and also to feel more comfortable. And basically what he was lacking against Todd Hutchings was the table time.
Roman (Translator): and after todd hutchings he basically have not even curled more than 30 kg with this pronation uh move and basically he was like staying at the table and doing all the pools because that's what he felt was lacking versus todd hutchings
Roman (Translator): and uh that's that's why and also he says uh uh thank you to you and game because he did exactly what he told him about this resting period this is why i asked him he was using his wrist more before he was only pulling this way and this time he just used his wrist dominated a lot here
Krasimir Kostadinov: Yeah, he remarked and thank you for that one. Yes. Yeah, yeah, he's incredible. If he continues more risk, more side pressure, more risk, more side pressure, he will be, yeah. But now it doesn't sound good. Like, it looks like, you know, we are like teaming against Krasimir. Go, Irakli, go. Yeah, Irakli.
Krasimir Kostadinov: What do you think about Krasimir? I'm not asking about him as an athlete. He's a legend. He's very young. The first time I saw him was in 2006. He was 18 years old. He was beating everyone and showing double biceps. And then, in a very short time, he really became
Krasimir Kostadinov: legends oh i know that he had the dreams of becoming like best in the world in unlimited class but after the point you see that all those monsters and then i mean it's just like looks very hard hard thing to do but but what i'm asking him directly if you translate what does he expect you know uh does he expect anything uh unique uh like kind of different than the opponents
Roman (Translator): that he has faced till today, or is it some familiar style that Krasimir has for him, you know? Well, Krasimir, what I think is very interesting to you, and specifically in the sense that you are talking about something unique, which is not the case with other people.
Roman (Translator): I don't know if you would like to talk about it or not, but I think it's a good idea to talk about it, because I don't think you would like to talk about it. This is interesting. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Irakli Zirakashvili: Well, if you ask Marcio Savitegi to come from the south, he will come from Madloba. Yes, that's right. And you, Anu, this is what I want to ask you, from your point of view, what do you think about it? What do you think about it and what do you think about it? I don't know, I don't know. I don't know what I think about it.
Roman (Translator): Okay, so I'll translate. He's saying that he knows, well, he expects Crassi to do basically what Crassi is the best and what he does the best. So he's preparing and he's trying to be exactly the best against this style, what Crassi has and what Iraq is expecting him to do as well.
Krasimir Kostadinov: Irakli also said that Krasimir is more than welcome to try, just like Marcio said, to go outside and toproll Irakli. You're also welcome to try that. Irakli is also welcome to try and hook. Yeah, by the way, Krasimir, his hook,
Krasimir Kostadinov: uh recently he's not using but not too bad of course not not like like maybe world elite level but i don't think it's too bad you know seriously i think he has strong biceps i agree i agree on that yeah but but you would still prefer him to come inside right
Roman (Translator): I think so. I will translate that shortly. He's saying that to go inside with hook, you need very strong wrist.
Krasimir Kostadinov: so maybe he remarked that he he is capable of doing that so who knows maybe we'll expect some surprise from iraq i i was i was i was if it was full five rounds and if he was winning three zero i would suggest him to try such thing but if even if it is two zero you go inside something may happen there and then you may lose the whole thing so
Krasimir Kostadinov: Sorry, Krasimir, but I just have to say my opinion. I just tell him not to go there. It's good. That's OK. Yeah. And OK. So what happened that about a month ago, Krasimir told me, Engin, tell Irakli, like whatever money we are going to make from this event, we put to the table and then the winner takes 75 percent and the guy who loses takes 25 percent.
Krasimir Kostadinov: usually i don't do so much like things like this because i don't want any kind of like extra extra aggression at the table and i i don't but but and then what happened that i didn't say this to iraqli about a month i didn't even mention i was like should i or not should i or not and i said better not and then what happened i just put the poll on the social media and then on the social media uh
Krasimir Kostadinov: because of Iraq is recent dominance, that the poll is just like 80% or something, you know, for Iraq and 20% Krasimir. So what happened that I just wake up and I just check my messages and Krasimir, did you ask Irakli about 75%, 25% thing? And I was like, no, he said like, okay, maybe you should. And then I did it. And then Irakli just said, yeah, absolutely. Why not?
Krasimir Kostadinov: That is how it happened, you know. So, I want to ask if any of you would like to back up from that idea, Krasimir? It was your idea, but no, right? Of course, I'm for this idea. Yeah, okay. Evgeny I'm thinking for 100%, but it sounds a bit too risky. It is risky and also it is just too bad that one of the athletes goes home without anything at all, you know. It's just like, yeah, yeah.
Roman (Translator): And tell him, tell Irakli that he didn't say that, but Krasimir is saying that it's still not too late to change the mind, you know. It's not too late to change the mind. Krasimir is saying that it's still not too late to change the mind. It's not too late to change the mind. It's not too late to change the mind.
Krasimir Kostadinov: So you're actually saying that his priority is not money. Win is his priority, victory. But he will obviously go there and bring home both of them. So victory and money as well. Yeah, yeah, yeah. In the past, in our history, there is oil wrestling. It's very hard to hold on. They do on the grass. In the past, it's like 600, 700 years old traditional thing that maybe if you say 50 wrestlers come there,
Krasimir Kostadinov: everyone bring a cow or something, something, you know, and then whenever somebody wins, he takes all of them. So that, that kind of reminded me, uh, that way. Yeah. And the, okay, guys, we didn't talk about it. We didn't talk about it, but, uh, is, uh, like this match is going to be under a hundred kilo, uh, the, about the, the, the title.
Krasimir Kostadinov: of the event, but of course the athletes, they agree with each other, they make 100, 300, 400, it's okay. I want to ask Krasimir to you, like, how do you see like world ranking under 100 kilo, but with what is proven, you know, John beating Zolev, Zolev beating Hutchings and Hutchings beating Irakli and then he beating Sonev.
Krasimir Kostadinov: of course if there is prudnik and some others uh i asked john like you can make 100 you know he said yeah because john was 102 kilo against zola then they both agreed um how do you see prudnik is under 110 i don't know where exactly on garbaev is but uh he competed 100 kilo plus i don't know if on garbaev versus john should be 110 kilo under 10 100 kilo category
Krasimir Kostadinov: I'm not sure about it, but how do you see the ranking? It's very difficult to say because we never put at one competition and I don't know. The form of the different people may be changing during the time and I don't know.
Krasimir Kostadinov: the last time the last time i put in 105 kilos at zloty i just killed everyone but there was no there was no john no prudnik no hutchins so hard to judge hard to judge and in your opinion and in your opinion okay if i ask the question the different way like
Krasimir Kostadinov: who do you think that uh do you think that styles make matches in there and some people beat that guy other guy beat this guy of course there is someone that would beat all of them and who is that person uh i believe i can beat all of them in 105 kilo yeah and uh
Krasimir Kostadinov: for me exactly maybe hutchins will be the toughest one do you believe you can beat with todd yes i believe i can beat him but for me maybe he will be the most difficult one and but are you talking about as of now or you can get ready for him and then that's possible
Krasimir Kostadinov: a month preparation should be enough i think i understand and how about how about john do you think john has chance against that or not um i think he has but i think for example for todd hutchins that prudnik should be the toughest one this is what i believe because probably that's 110 kilo category okay yeah yeah yeah yeah
Krasimir Kostadinov: Prudnik will not go down to 100. He will pull only heaviest and then 110. John and Hutchings, 110 and 100. You, Irakli, also 110 and 100, yeah. So this is the categories. Do you think that if Zolaev comes in his best ever, do you think that
Krasimir Kostadinov: he would beat his Hutchings again or do you think the Hutchings took enough of lessons from that match and he wouldn't make mistake he would he would secure the strap it's possible Zolov to beat Hadji many people don't realize that even the last round in the strap the fifth round when it was already over it was three two one two
Krasimir Kostadinov: Zuloyev and the last round Zuloyev went inside, Hutchings won that match, but it was not that easy. There was a moment when Hutchings attacked and Zuloyev from here started to counter attack. And there was some moment when Hutchings was like,
Krasimir Kostadinov: so how long do you think it was i think it was like maximum 10 seconds or something you know anyway anyway you can you can see the match in zloty tour when haji beat yeah yeah exactly the same way exactly the same way he's he waited him a little bit waited here and after the attack of hutchins zolov counter attack and beat him do you know what's interesting about that match when i asked haji murad did you prepare for top roll
Krasimir Kostadinov: He said no, he prepared for hook. He said in the last moment he felt it and he thought that it would be easier to beat him in topple. He said he didn't train for topple. That was very, very interesting that he didn't do topple preparation, but just because he hold the Hutchings in and he decided to go outside, you know, that was very interesting. And okay, Irakli,
Krasimir Kostadinov: you just let me finish just let me yeah yeah sorry yeah go ahead and i wanted to say that prudnik may be the the hardest one for hutchins and irakli may be the hardest one for prudnik this is what i believe from the styles and do you do you think that john has any chance at all 110 killer against prudnik or hard he has he has chances i think yeah yeah yeah and prudnik prudnik
Krasimir Kostadinov: in my opinion it's not that good against top rowers he's good but not that good i understand i understand yeah i understand but you know ongarba tried to topple him but he hooked him and he managed to beat him still yes but ongarba was not uh
Krasimir Kostadinov: best best top roller so i understand but do you realize that the the in the recent years before he became like totally professional the the guys that beat prudnik were not the top rollers it was sasha and zola that beat him inside uh true right true yeah but i also remember when ermes took his wrist at the name of
Krasimir Kostadinov: 2013 or something here? Yeah. Yeah, it was just kind of anyway. Anyway, it's okay. Yeah. It's difficult to say. Okay. And to ask to Iraq Lee. What would he do difference against Hutchings if he had chance to pull him? Like does he think that the reason that he lost because Hutchings was
Krasimir Kostadinov: too strong or he, as he told me that he made a mistake about the resting time, or is it because of the, he didn't pull in the right way that he should pull or like, like, does he think that just, just, just, they're not going to pull. In August 6th, if he would pull Hutchings, do you, does he think that it would be, the outcome would be different than the last time or he still needs some time to prepare?
Roman (Translator): I see. Engin, before I briefly translate that, you were talking about title matches, and I wanted Irakli also to know, and I got this question. So Irakli's and Krasimir's match is title match under 100 kg or between 100 and 110? No, no, it's not title match. It's not title match? It's not title match? No, no, no. When I say title, I mean, like category. Irakli cannot pull 100 kilo title match when he lost Hutchings. Yeah.
Krasimir Kostadinov: someone is above him and then it is for the East versus West title match and this is the Krasimir is gonna pull first time in this category so we are trying to figure out you know who is ranked where so they will pull more people will pull hopefully and then we will understand who is where and then we will have the title matches but right now right now Hutchings and Prudnik is doing the 110 kilo title match and right now John
Krasimir Kostadinov: And Ongar Bayev, John is ranked 100 kilo number one right now. The truth is that John versus Ongar Bayev could very well be the 100 kilo title match since number one ranked guy is, I mean, you know, defending something, yeah?
Krasimir Kostadinov: So because Zola beat Hutchings and John beat Zola, so John should be the ranked number one. So I will talk with John. If his weight is not over 105 kilo, then I will ask him, would you want this to be a title match for 100 kilo? My idea about the weight classes, as long as you don't pass the half of the next weight classes,
Krasimir Kostadinov: if you if both atlas agree with each other they can they can like for example samushain bojidar will be pulling uh 885 kilo for 80 kilo title match because they both agree i wouldn't allow 86 87 but they could agree 82 they could make 80 exactly but as long as he doesn't go the halfway and if both atlas agree if one atlas says no i don't agree then he needs to both needs to be there
Krasimir Kostadinov: yeah okay sorry about it just ask it actually no actually it's well no need to sorry i asked you a specific question no i'm just i'm just waiting iraqi to wait that's why i said sorry yeah
Roman (Translator): Okay, so Ira, I would like to ask you, what was your experience in August, when you first came to Hutchings? What do you think, is it possible that there was something different, different, different, and different, and if so, what did you want to do? For example, did you want to do something different, if Hutchings was different, if it was different,
Irakli Zirakashvili: Yes, of course. I am very happy, but I have a problem. I don't have a job in Kelsen. I don't feel comfortable there, and I have to pay 50% of my salary to be able to work there. I see. I see that you have been working there for a long time. Yes, I have been working there for a long time.
Roman (Translator): He's saying that he already partially answered that question about blaming himself by not preparing correctly for Hutchings.
Roman (Translator): So that was the poor reason. Obviously, Hutchings is also very strong, but mainly the reason what he said is that he was not too well prepared. And basically, he said he was like now looking back at it, he thinks that he only used around 50 percent of what he could have done.
Roman (Translator): so and it's it's only because he was uh lacking his table time and could not execute all the angles vectors and stuff so that's the basic uh more main reason why he lost he thinks so and if the august match had happened let's say against todd hutchings he would definitely work on it just exactly like he worked versus barbosa and he thinks that outcome would be different
Krasimir Kostadinov: I understand. Yeah, yeah. So we just do not to be misunderstood. We are not taking anything from Hutchings. He just like barely just won. He's incredible, incredible guy. But of course that his opponents also will make adjustments. Nobody stays at same point. It's very normal to go home and just do some homework and come back stronger and believe in yourself. These are very, very normal.
Krasimir Kostadinov: So I want to ask Irakli, is he very confident or is he against Krasimir after beating Marseille in a dominant way? Or how seriously is he taking Krasimir?
Roman (Translator): Yes, it is a magical thing to be able to do something like this, to dominate your own country, and to be able to do something like this, to be able to do something like this, to be able to do something like this, to be able to do something like this, to be able to do something like this, to be able to do something like this, to be able to do something like this, to be able to do something like this, to be able to do something like this, to be able to do something like this, to be able to do something like this, to be able to do something like this, to be able to do something like this, to be able to do something like this, to be able to do something like this, to be able to do something like this, to be able to do something like this, to be able to do something like this, to be able to do something like this, to be able to do something like this, to be able to do something like this, to be able to do something like this, to be able
Irakli Zirakashvili: Well, it depends on how you look at it. After March and March, it depends on how you look at it. But if you look at it from another angle, you will see that it is a very competitive category.
Roman (Translator): Obviously, this self-confidence was skyrocketed by such a dominant fashion win against Marseille. He's talking about obviously himself. That's why he's also way more confident right now against Krasimir because somewhat he thinks that he's on the right path to make himself even better and more suitable for this
Roman (Translator): uh kind of heavyweight category and he he wants to prove himself that uh his opponents should he could have uh handled uh like heavyweight these division opponents like big big names so he wants to prove himself and uh that's why he's he thinks that uh this match is very serious did we did i understand wrong or are you talking about heavyweight krasimir is about as much as his weight
Roman (Translator): that's the thing because uh iraqis um uh he he was not that heavyweight before like years ago so oh you're talking about okay okay he wants to prove himself around 100 exactly yeah because basically yeah you understand
Roman (Translator): okay i understand and that's how serious he he thinks that against krasimir's as a win against krasimir how serious would be that's why he's completely serious about this and also obviously he's very confident because on my training video in youtube he wrote to me
Krasimir Kostadinov: top row bigger than hook who wrote this who wrote this you mean instagram i guess or in youtube youtube iraqi wrote this are you sure it was iraqi okay i will ask actually i think there are many many many troll names there are many troll names that like
Roman (Translator): Like, just ask him, ask him. I will make sure.
Roman (Translator): That was a troll name. He doesn't own any YouTube channel right now. He doesn't own any YouTube channel. Okay, okay, okay. You're not going to be so hard.
Krasimir Kostadinov: I was already thinking what should I do about this. So now you know it was not him. I even took a screenshot and I was going to show him on the match.
Roman (Translator): OK, just translate him. Krasimir said that he was going to beat him in one second. And because of this, he's going to beat him in now three seconds. .
Krasimir Kostadinov: you told him that it's a joke right i'm joking yeah because because he is much younger than us so we are just picking on him at least i am picking on him yeah that's good yeah and crossing how do you see your chances my friend how do you see like do you like you seem also very confident but you know um like you are much experienced much more experienced than iraqi
Krasimir Kostadinov: yeah it doesn't mean that we don't make any mistake you know about our estimation like do you do you push yourself to be confident or are you really inside of you you're confident i'm confident enough just uh want to say that when i'm pulling the heavy the super heavy weight guys yeah right there i have nothing to lose and a lot to win this is in my head
Krasimir Kostadinov: But when I'm pulling my size guys, now the question is not only money, it's honor on the table as well. So now I should give really all I have to win this match. So I'm confident enough and I'm looking to just to win, to show the world that in my weight class, I am still the man.
Krasimir Kostadinov: Yeah, that's very important. Like you should not lose that base. Like before you were like, I'm the best, you know, but
Krasimir Kostadinov: like i'm trying to do something even like miraculously you know just winning the overall from 2011 to 2015 five years in a row i was beating everyone europeans and worlds everyone yeah and i just started to think that i should challenge myself with something bigger and that's why i tried the super heavyweight but realized that uh
Krasimir Kostadinov: I the only chance I give is that the world sent Europeans the professionals right now right now when I look at you this camera you you're looking good okay can you show me your bicep can you show me your bicep I'm 104. you're 104. yes yeah you look good you look you look big yeah that's good for some time you were only lifting
Krasimir Kostadinov: then later you decided to arm wrestle and less lift and you said you progress but i kind of realized that you came to a point that you need to mix them am i right or wrong i realized that there's not a big difference actually you can reach the top by different ways yes so depends uh but my my best performances
Krasimir Kostadinov: at the number of 2016 and 2019, I was mostly pulling on the table. 89% of my training was on the table. So this is what I'm doing now as well. Well, you're doing on the table right now. 80% of my training. I understand. And some basic lifts, restore pull ups.
Krasimir Kostadinov: yeah yeah or bands yeah if you if you have good good training partners uh you can train many things at the table many things but you really need a good good training partner that can really train you with different can you ask the same questions to iraqli like uh he was mostly lifting and then he said that you know he just started to do more uh table training before marcio and
Krasimir Kostadinov: How does it look like right now? At this moment, right? Preparation for crash? Yeah, crash even match, does he mix it 50-50, like some days lifting, but for sure table, or is going like table, table, table, table, or lifting only? Yeah, yeah, ask me, please.
Roman (Translator): He works four days per week.
Irakli Zirakashvili: 70% table time.
Irakli Zirakashvili: If you want to work in Kelsa, you have to pay 80% of your salary. If you want to work in Adair, you have to pay 80% of your salary. If you want to work in Metzil, you have to pay 80% of your salary.
Roman (Translator): So, 70% to 30. So, 70 would be table time. These are missing specific movements as well, but table time, like table specific exercises and the rest would be just lifting the weights was 30%. How many hours a day he trains? 30 hours. 30 to 40 hours.
Roman (Translator): So, he said like four or five days per week would be for you, Krassi, right now, his plan, and also on average four hours per day. Four hours? Yeah. Wow. And, Anu, 30% of the people who work with Magida, do you work with your sparring partner? Yes, I work with Magida.
Roman (Translator): So, yeah, the 70%, I just asked to make sure the 70% was not only just by the table with the specific movements, but combined with sparring partners as well.
Irakli Zirakashvili: Like we call table time. Yeah, exactly.
Roman (Translator): he he just remarked that uh he gained this experience and he he's now sure that no matter how much weight you lift it will be all pointless if you don't imply it in the specific moments to use as a technique during the wrestling so yeah that's why he shifted 17 to 30. yeah still he needs to be careful to not to hurt himself either you know
Krasimir Kostadinov: and before before uh okay before we finish here and then i will ask the predictions of the rest of the matches uh is there anything you guys want to add to say against i mean about your match brassy you are senior guy here
Krasimir Kostadinov: sorry you are senior you have to answer first like can you believe that you are what are you now 34 35 yeah yeah yeah yeah
Krasimir Kostadinov: And can you imagine that you have been around forever and you are still not even at the middle of 30. And it just shows how great you are that you have done incredible things in such a young age. Same apply for Arsene when he left 2013. I was like, what the hell? This guy in eight years just did a lot of things. And did you guys know that he's coming back? Arsene is coming back?
Krasimir Kostadinov: he's coming back i i he said that nobody could convince him except me i just go like he's like no and you know i'm over it's just finished and then he goes like uh now i started to think and then and later he says oh i start to get excited and i continue from what's up i continue continue okay i will tell you in a couple of days pressure you know in a couple of days and i'm like
Krasimir Kostadinov: couple of days he may lose the excitement let me continue push push push more more more more and now he's like you know the next thing is just send me forearm pause looks good he's like don't share on the uh yeah yeah he was yeah he said that he was like 100 what 120 kilo or something he lost already 13 14 he was like 107 kilo or something but he looks good last time i saw him was 2018
Krasimir Kostadinov: He didn't look good. He looked old, he looked like bad, you know, but this time when I saw a picture, it looks good. He said like, you are trying to bring the dead out of the grave. I said, are you crazy? Are you crazy? Look at Todd Hutchings, look at Ron Beth, look at John Brzee. What are you, 1987? Like you are 34, 35. And you are talking about what, like, come on, come on. And you have like, these guys,
Krasimir Kostadinov: don't get convinced by just saying, oh, come on, you can do it or something. That doesn't make sense. You need to convince them with the things that really make sense, that he has a muscle memory, he needs to be patient, he needs to calm and slowly, slowly. He just needs patience. You really need to convince them by saying things that make sense. It's not like with the bullshit, I know you can do it, you got to kick ass or something. That doesn't work at that level.
Krasimir Kostadinov: um so i just wanted to say um we were asking you if you had the last last words against your match with iraqi i don't know what to say i'm just preparing as much as i can and will give everything i have to win and if you win who do you want to pull next do you want to do something do you want to do something in 110 kilo or 100 kilo category i just want hutchins that's it
Krasimir Kostadinov: want to have things yeah yeah wow that is like a national level uh problem yeah yeah and iraqi if you win against krasimir who do you want to pull next
Krasimir Kostadinov: yes yes i know i i i was you were gonna pull him but that kind of the things kind of a little bit changed but yeah anyway so i will ask the predictions um they you can answer only 50 50 or one of the guys win okay so okay uh
Krasimir Kostadinov: How about Lachlan versus Sandris, Krasimir? I say Sandris. Lachlan may be the stronger guy, but Sandris is the better puller. You think he will take his wrist? I just think that overall, Sandris is better puller. Yeah, better, but if it goes hook, I don't know if one is very strong. Lachlan really looks very strong. I think Lachlan versus you, you also would be a good match inside.
Krasimir Kostadinov: think his bicep is very strong his biceps is very strong from the pronation was not that good in the past don't know right now i understand i understand but i saw that whenever touching was beating him i'm not talking about the later rounds he was beating him but he was just the arm was like shaking like he was not like opening like this but i could see that hashings like was really pushing his limits to bring that arm down you know i saw that true because his biceps is very strong
Roman (Translator): Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. And Irakli, Sandris versus Loughlin. Does he know who Loughlin is? I will ask him. He thinks Sandris is going to top off. At the end of the day, Sandris will be victorious.
Krasimir Kostadinov: Another thing, ask Irakli, whenever I ask him, now many of the Georgians are in this event, is he going to be objective or is he going to answer with nationalistic feelings?
Roman (Translator): Under 85 kilos, Samushia versus Bozhidar, close or one of them wins? This is equal or one of them wins? I believe it will be war and Bozhidar will win. Bozhidar will win. And Irakli?
Krasimir Kostadinov: Let us speak Samushia. Samushia. There will be a huge fight, but Samushia will... At least they agree about something, it will be a good war. I think about a good war, the mind is talking, and about the outcome, then the feelings are getting... No, he said he will be honest. Yeah, yeah.
Krasimir Kostadinov: How about Egle versus Gabriela, right and left? That's a difficult one. Krasimir, can I ask you something? When I say that this is like God versus God, am I mistaken? Because in a female, there are more than one God. I think Irina Makeeva and Egle and Gabriela, in their own ways, I think they all are Gods. True, true.
Krasimir Kostadinov: yeah oh gabriel is the powerhouse but it is a better puller with bill i don't know i don't know do you have a different opinion right and left
Krasimir Kostadinov: I don't know this much. Gabriela is the stronger guy, but Egle is more technical. So yeah, last time I saw Egle beat her at Zloty, but I think one match Gabriela won. But I think Gabriela improved a lot since then. And I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. And Irakli, what do you think about it? Gogo Nebismachiro, Gabriela da Egle.
Irakli Zirakashvili: Goniaro or Gabriela? Gabriela. It's in two languages, but I don't know what you think in two languages. Goniaro, yes. Yes. I asked him. I don't know if it's true, but I think Gabriela is Goniaro. Goniaro is famous for all of his videos. But it's not true, is it?
Roman (Translator): So I asked also that they have both hand matches, right? And that's why I asked him. Maybe he thinks differently on left hand. But he thinks he will pick up slightly more. He knows more about Gabriela's strength right now. He would say Gabriela would win on both hands. Both hands. Okay. And the next is Chen Xiao versus Zurab Krasimir.
Krasimir Kostadinov: I think that Chance will win. Chance's style should be difficult for Zurab. This is what I think. This is what I am saying. People are saying that it's a mismatch. I mean, whenever I saw how Chance fought against Tata Chinx and how he pulled against John, of course John got better, but I think Chance also got much better. Anyone who is giving the pronator to Chance, maybe
Krasimir Kostadinov: travel so i think it's very good matchup very good matchup i don't know the outcome but strongly disagree that it's a mismatch and what do you think uh iraqli chance show versus uh uh
Krasimir Kostadinov: Yeah, Zurab is going to win because of judging by last matches. They are both, both of them last matches. I understand. Okay. So it looks like Irakli could be a like guy from Japan and would still pick on the Georgians, right?
Krasimir Kostadinov: I don't think that neither of them will have the risk control like this.
Irakli Zirakashvili: so but i don't i mean they both will based on tornado i think there will be a war like this this is my opinion me too i cannot say who very close very close i see yeah and iraqi john is
Roman (Translator): okay so he's also uh very unclear about this doubtful he is not sure and very he finds it very interesting match but uh if john uh kind of loses his wrist like if um manages to crack it
Roman (Translator): then there will be no chance for john to regain it that's that's how he thinks so but i guess he would say 50 50 but should i ask something else as well okay does he think that ongar where can control john's pronators
Roman (Translator): Ah, so only if Ungerberg manages to crack at the slightest, then it will go only that way, like the negative way for John. And after that, more and more, he will gain control. But John is so smart that he will find out something else for maybe later rounds. Okay. Jerry Cadorette and Genadi. Krasimir.
Krasimir Kostadinov: I believe Genadi will win 6-0. I totally disagree with you and I would bet my house on it. You want to bet? Do you know why I say this? Because the best scorer can get 3-0. I could bet something that Genadi will win this match. You think he will find a way?
Krasimir Kostadinov: i don't know i just i think that gennady will be dominant oh he will win in a dominant way yeah gennady's biceps is too strong for jerry's press but do you catch on bicep or brachioradialis like this whenever he dives i believe that gennady will just go to the side oh okay i understand
Krasimir Kostadinov: And if Krasimir is saying that, I shouldn't even ask what Iraqis think about it. Exactly. I ignore this question. I'm not going to ask you. No, ask him. Oh, so should I ask him anyways? Yeah, just ask. Yeah, OK. Maybe he will say . Who knows? That's pretty cool.
Roman (Translator): So he thinks that stylistically the way Jerry pulls is very hard to pin like that Genadi. So for Genadi it would be easier and for Jerry it would be hard. Because stylistically it's very hard to pin Genadi like that. Because when you're a guy like Jerry who is pressing down, if your opponent is with very strong biceps, you have nightmares.
Krasimir Kostadinov: So that's why I believe that Genadi is the favorite, the heavy favorite in this one. Time will show. Time will show. I think that Jerry is coming there. Big, huge, powerful. You know, the strength, strength says the last words. But who knows? He may be right. Jerry is not proven yet against European pullers. Yeah, even though he has two WAF titles.
Krasimir Kostadinov: Oh, sorry for this, but it was a long time ago and I don't know about this. I understand. I understand. Yeah. So if we go a very important match and you are probably thinking that I'm going to say Tata Kings versus Prudnik and you're right. I don't see it. I cannot say about this match. I really don't know.
Krasimir Kostadinov: And how do you see, like 50-50? Yes, in my eyes it's like 50-50. And do you think that this is the most important match in the card? Maybe the most interesting, the most weighted match. I understand. And I believe that if Prudnik wins, he will win fast. If the match stops, I believe Hutchings will win.
Krasimir Kostadinov: Does it matter the position, like if the match stops and Hutchings is like this and Prudnik is like this? It does matter, it does matter, but I believe if the match goes longer, Hutchings has the advantage. I understand, yeah. And Irakli? I think Prudnik is a very good player.
Roman (Translator): Sorry, my internet was lagging. Sorry guys about my internet, I don't know what happened, but he said Prudnik will manage this. So he said Prudnik is going to win?
Krasimir Kostadinov: Yes, yes. Yes. And can you ask me in which way he is visualizing this? Roman? You don't hear? Oh. Okay, never mind. I will ask Krasimir then. Who wins, Ray or Ryan Krasimir?
Krasimir Kostadinov: I believe Ryan is the favorite Ryan is a favorite because he's bigger guy like structure everything I find it a bit more well-rounded than Ray I understand yeah I think that Ryan's pronator is better than race but do you think that Ray cannot hook him
Krasimir Kostadinov: or it doesn't matter even if you hooks him it will be hook match but when both pullers are hooking and the guy with the with the stronger pronator has the advantage in the group okay yeah he will get better position you are saying yes yeah yeah and you know what people like like matushenko
Krasimir Kostadinov: they don't really use any kind of pronator but they just like dry more and more spinators and more they push here and that will have pressure here because more than you push here so the guy cannot really even put pressure here you know you are getting around so they he like whenever i ask him like like like do you like train your pronator he was like if i'm not mistaken he's like he doesn't need it
Krasimir Kostadinov: and I said how about the block the guy and then as far as I remember he was saying that like it's not necessary that because he's I think his hook is more on offensive pressure over the guy's pronator I think yeah but you use your pronator right that that's very important for like like if you would come to
Krasimir Kostadinov: inside move against me i i if i hang you here i mean it is maybe possibly but whenever you go there that the pronators should not be blocking me understand if you give totally away it is kind of easy to move that way you know yes so that this is what i wanted to ask you when you pull uh iraqli um
Krasimir Kostadinov: And then when I ask you the comparing with the after pool, Jordan and you, and you said that your pronator is stronger whenever, you know, somebody wanted to go sideways. Yes, exactly. Yeah, yeah. This is what I want to do. Yeah. An important match. Now, do you hear us, Roman? Yes, yes, yes. I switched the internet. I think you didn't hear what I said a while ago. Can you ask him in which way he visualized, you know,
Roman (Translator): I don't know if you understand what I'm saying, but I'd like to ask you, how did you get to know Prudnik and Prudnik?
Irakli Zirakashvili: And as you can see in Moldova, as you can see in Moldova, Prudnik is one of the biggest cities. And my opinion is that 30-40% of people live in Prudnik.
Roman (Translator): So he said, even though you didn't ask, he still said 60 to 40% that Prudnik will win. And he said that exactly the way, like he beat him already in Moldova, 2018. Oh, okay. So he will go over. He will do the same. And again, ask me the last one and I should go. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I'm finishing. Yeah. Uh, okay.
Krasimir Kostadinov: dadikyan versus oleg left arm that's difficult one so listen listen before you answer you need to congratulate me then if i'm asking you these matches and you're saying that this is difficult this is difficult so it means that i did good job huh yeah actually no one in the world ever made so many super matches in social so short period of time so really engine
Krasimir Kostadinov: Thank you and great job, man. Yeah, I thank you. I thank you guys. I thank you guys for being part of it. We all together making this possible together with the fans who are supporting us, you know. OK, now you answer me. I really don't know. This match is 50-50 for me. And then OK, then I will ask another one because you didn't answer. Dave Chaffee versus Morozov.
Krasimir Kostadinov: I will say Dave Chiffre. Dave Chiffre will win. And then the last one, Morozov versus Kody Merritt. Don't know. This one don't know. You don't know. Okay. I know you have time till one hour. We already passed. Thank you very much. And I will continue asking if you think to Irakli. You take care of yourself. Train well. Irakli is coming for you.
Krasimir Kostadinov: Irakli is coming for you. I'm coming there also for him. All the best, guys. See you. Take care. Take care. Can you ask Irakli about Oleg Dzok versus David Dadikyan, left arm? 50-50?
Krasimir Kostadinov: Dadikyan will beat, also, like I said, he is like a weight. So, Dadikyan, he picks Dadikyan. It's 50-50, but Dadikyan would be nice. But Dadikyan, around over 110 kilos, going down to 102 kilos. Yeah, so he's also losing so much weight. He's not the Dadikyan we see on the videos lately.
Roman (Translator): Yes, of course, I would like to say that there is no doubt about it, because this is the way it is, and this is the way it should be. But do you think this is the way it should be? No, not at all. I mean, now, people are dealing with a lot of problems, as I said before, people are dealing with a lot.
Irakli Zirakashvili: This is a very interesting topic. It is very interesting to talk about this topic.
Roman (Translator): so when i said that it was about 102 kg then he it was like he was like oh it's even uh less less clear at this time so he's more 50 50 right now and also he said that uh oleg is becoming uh from like he's now rising to get even better and better shape because we we know how strong he was and that's why he expects oleg to be even better than he was against betty last time so so it's like 50 50. yeah
Roman (Translator): I understand. And what does he think about Morozov versus Devkshafi? I think Morozov will win. He thinks the young start with surprises. Is that Morozov will win? Yeah. I'm asking about Spohr. Who do you think will win?
Krasimir Kostadinov: um three two one morozov will be i understand and does he know cody merits codimerity but morozov morozov will be both americans he's saying yes i understand and and this one i don't know if i should ask because it's a georgian
Roman (Translator): I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say.
Roman (Translator): He says that the Revaz will win. He also says that anybody who is really into the armwrestling and knows about the armwrestling world, currently what's going on, 90% would pick the Revaz as a winner in this case. And does he train with Revaz?
Roman (Translator): uh so for barcio he didn't but for crassi he for sure will carry on sparring uh sparring with uh see that part i don't understand that cross is gonna go inside and rawas is a top popular but how does he get the krasimir's uh technical training with
Krasimir Kostadinov: Maybe he has other sparring partners. He needs to pull with someone that is just, you know, actually going there so that he would have the, like whenever the same thing, you know, whenever he was training with the Kardashians, he was training with Revaz. Of course he should train with Revaz too, but like, like how does he like get that, that kind of pressure with someone that is pulling in different direction?
Roman (Translator): Yes, of course. Well, it's possible that you think that you can do sparring with this technique, but how is it possible to have such a sparring partner, who can give you the maximum limitation in terms of the size, that you can do it with this sparring partner? I would like to ask this question.
Roman (Translator): No, we have two Irakli right now. Irakli, I'm going to talk to you. What's your name? He can't hear us, I guess, or maybe he switched devices. What's your name? My name is Eke, I'm on the phone.
Roman (Translator): Somebody was calling, so he had to turn it off. I will reply with it, yes. Yeah, no problem. .
Roman (Translator): That's why I don't have a sparring partner. If I have one, I'll work with him and if I don't have one, I'll work with him. If you were to make a movie, you'd have to imitate a sparring partner like Krasimir Ilyich.
Irakli Zirakashvili: Do you know that Levand is one of a kind? No, I don't know anything about him. I don't know anything about him. I don't know anything about him. I don't know anything about him. I don't know anything about him. I don't know anything about him. I don't know anything about him.
Irakli Zirakashvili: For example, let's say you are in the biceps and you want to work on one side of the biceps. The other side of the biceps is not the same. Well, let's say you want to work on the other side of the biceps and you want to work on the muscles and so on. Let's say you want to work on the other side of the biceps and you want to work on the muscles and you want to work on the muscles and so on. There is no problem.
Roman (Translator): so he said that uh he answered about uh there was because uh first of all we asked about rivers if he would be a sparring partner with him but it's not like a specifically for this match because uh they are just living close by they are training in the same gym mostly so why not right
Roman (Translator): and then i asked about specifically if he has someone to prepare help him prepare against cross at this time to go inside like you uh wanted to know and uh he said that unfortunately uh there is not that many people here in that weight class to imitate like that uh zurab would be great but zurab lives in different uh cities far away in batumi right but to me yeah in batum yeah
Roman (Translator): Which is closer to you, Engin, technically? No, closer to my continent where I am. I am at the west, that's at the east border. Oh, okay. Yeah. So, and then he said that whoever he needs to be trying to imitate hook, I guess, for example, would use both hands. Oh, yeah. Other than that, he will also obviously try to imitate hook moves on the table, but with the weights.
Krasimir Kostadinov: I understand, I understand, yeah. And Irakli, yes, we are finishing now, but Irakli, like what does he dream? Like his dream is now, like his category, around his category, probably right now is one of the best, toughest one. Like imagine a group of people, John, Tata Hutchings, Prudnik, Irakli, Ongar Bayev, Marcio,
Krasimir Kostadinov: and krasimir i think i said it yeah and like zurab like many many of these guys that we can count there are there is also some will come from ukraine when they can get out some will come from russia when the ban is over and arsenic is coming back is just like a nightmare you know that that category is incredible like and i'm sure that if someone like iraqi he's dreaming to become
Krasimir Kostadinov: the best around here in a short term but does he have any kind of dream or does he think that he is kind of too small to be in the conversation of the like top five overall or is it like open weight category you mean yeah yeah
Roman (Translator): Okay, let's move on. There are a lot of very strong people in the Asatom-Detson category who are interested in what Russia is going to do when it comes to Ukraine. There are a lot of people like Shen, Prudnik, John, Krasimir, all of these people are interested in what will happen.
Roman (Translator): I would like to ask you, what kind of advice would you give to people who want to become an athlete? What kind of advice would you give to people who want to be in the open weight category, who want to become an athlete, and who want to be the first one? I mean, it's a new thing, and there are many ways to do it, and you can do it in any way you want. I mean, you can do it in any way you want.
Irakli Zirakashvili: It's not a big deal, and it's not a big deal to lose 3-4 kilos of weight. My opinion is that there is nothing to be afraid of, and I believe that Satan will take care of everything, and he will take care of everything, right? Of course, it will happen, everything will happen, and I will take care of everything, and I will work hard.
Roman (Translator): Before you ask more, can you translate please?
Roman (Translator): He said that obviously he has a big dream about being overall number one and he thinks that in time he will be able to compete against anyone.
Roman (Translator): it just takes him uh more years because he's not like you he doesn't know that much he he talks about his experience so each arm wrestling match gains him more experience maybe he will lose this against top pullers but then obviously he's young and he has the way to experience himself so he he is relying on his experience that would gain you know that he will gain
Roman (Translator): uh in future and uh he says that uh it's uh nothing is impossible in that case uh he can compete against anyone in open weight category and then i asked him because he he started this uh this conversation uh with saying about his weight he dropped four kg but he also said that he could go extra for five kg and then he mentioned that he would not gain like um
Roman (Translator): too much overweight and then I wanted to make sure what he meant by that. How much weight does he can comfortably carry still? And he has not answered it yet. I think that he wants to just grow up slowly with time instead of just pushing himself. That would be the...
Krasimir Kostadinov: the best thing he can do yeah no no need to uh push himself yeah he said exactly that he will not push himself like yeah that's the best thing best thing he could do yeah and and another question uh does he think that there is anyone or who should be pulling level next okay
Roman (Translator): Anu, let's start with you, as you said, that you are a very talented musician, and you will probably make a maximum of five kilos. And, Anu, I would like to ask you, if you were to marry Levan, would you choose to marry him or marry Levan? What do you think? Do you think that there is a woman who would marry Levan? Levan? No, I don't think so. If I were to choose a woman,
Irakli Zirakashvili: Levan was a great man, he was a great man, he was a great man, he was a great man, he was a great man, he was a great man, he was a great man, he was a great man,
Irakli Zirakashvili: I don't want to argue with Levani, but he was very strong. He weighed 130 kilos. He was very strong.
Irakli Zirakashvili: And from Deon's point of view, his 19th century, well, he was 19th century, he was born in the 19th century, and he was born in the 19th century, and he was born in the 19th century, right? But that's not the case now. I mean, Moemzada was born in the 19th century, and well, it's not like that now, right? I'm like that.
Roman (Translator): Okay, so he says that right now he doesn't see anybody else as a name against Lewand right now. And he said mainly one huge reason. I mean, two big reasons. First of all, it is that he keeps progressing against everybody else. Like we saw how comfortably and how dominantly he beat Dave Chaffee. And back then he was 170 kg.
Roman (Translator): and now he gained weight like 10 kg more roughly and he was even better shape for devon so he he thinks that no matter who comes next he will be even better shape because that's uh what history tells us that leon keeps progressing so that was the one uh big reason and another big reason is just uh poorly how dominant he is overall compared to anybody else like he's saying he's standing
Roman (Translator): above and he said that uh right now if we see take a look how any how somebody beats someone in a lead group in an open weight category we can still conclude that uh looking the looking level and beating Devon Dave Chafin so big names so dominantly no matter who beats who they cannot come close to Levan so that's why he doesn't see any name right now yeah tell him that he is not helping Levan for super
Krasimir Kostadinov: future super matches if he talks like that he's not gonna get and nobody's gonna watch i think there should be some but uh and the last question to erect it like yes until he becomes the best he wants to stick in his category or for example if i would set him a match in east versus west in future like just say november i'm not saying i will but like yes some american super heavyweights
Krasimir Kostadinov: or some canadian super heavyweight would he also consider pulling super heavyweights in east versus west or he he wins like he reaches his like best around his weight under 110 kilo he wants to stick in his his class yes okay um but first i will also translate what you said about leo okay
Roman (Translator): but not healthy so uh no no lebanon is here and this guy is here it would be a good match you know if you say lebanon is here
Krasimir Kostadinov: Tell him to be a little bit political.
Roman (Translator): Yes, you are right, but I don't think it's political. I think it's about the matches. Okay, ask him the last question I ask, please, and then we can continue. Okay, thank you very much. And I would like to ask you both, specifically, if there is a match in Kuat, because there will be no matches, but if there is a match in Kuat in November,
Roman (Translator): Yes, with you.
Roman (Translator): I would like to ask you, Anu, what do you think if you were in this category, if you were in this zone, if you were in this zone, and if you were in this zone, and if you were in this zone, and if you were in this zone, and if you were in this zone, and if you were in this zone, and if you were in this zone, and if you were in this zone, and if you were in this zone, and if you were in this zone, and if you were in this zone, and if you were in this zone, and if you were in this zone, and if you were in this zone, and if you were in this zone, and if you were in this zone, and if you were in this zone, and if you were in this zone, and if you were in this zone, and if you were in this zone, and if you were in this zone, and if you were in this zone, and if you were in this zone, and if you were in this zone, and if you were in
Irakli Zirakashvili: The real reason I'm saying this is because I don't want to talk about my own situation. I don't want to talk about my own situation. I don't want to talk about my own situation.
Roman (Translator): So he said that it depends how dominantly or how non-dominantly he would beat Krasimir. So he will wait until then and then we will see and he will see how he was against Krasimir. And if he was very dominant, then why not? He would go against openweight. But if it's like a closer match or maybe even he loses, then maybe he will restrain himself so far in this category.
Roman (Translator): Yeah, but like beating Krasimir alone, will it prove him to that he's the best in his category? Good question. I also wanted to ask that. You know, Krasimir, when he won, he was very dominant when he won against Smith Noli. It was obvious to him that he was going to win against that kind of people. When Krasimir won, it was obvious that he was going to win against them.
Roman (Translator): he says yes if he beats with us it will be enough to call out those guys so two big guys yeah okay yeah okay nice just please uh thank him
Irakli Zirakashvili: that for being part of this show. I'm so sure. He has some questions. One question for you. He has some questions. One question for you.
Irakli Zirakashvili: and what you can do, what you can't do, what you can do and what you can do
Roman (Translator): okay uh first of all he said thank you as well back to you to invite in this show and um then he was uh he wants to ask you this question it's like a personal trainer question or something like this you will understand is because you are such a legend and your advice helped him so much he wonders to know how did you expect his match against barbosa to go and the scenes after you saw how he went down
Krasimir Kostadinov: what would be your suggestions for him to make him even better maybe he did some mistakes that you think he needs to work on so it's like a you've been personal trainer for him right now to give some advice he knows that i have been supporting him his name because i believe him in him you know already for some years i am saying that look at this guy look at this guy i have been saying look at this guy and look at hermes for some years already so um
Krasimir Kostadinov: I think that he pulled great against Marcio. I told him what I think he should do. I told him after Tata Ching's match, he knows it. Down there, he was asking me about how many days he should rest. I said, your problem is not with the rest. Maybe you need to rest longer, but that is not going to fix your problem if you don't pull in the right way. He had to use his flexor more to the tornado, and this time I saw
Krasimir Kostadinov: His wrist hand was much more dominant. I was expecting him to pull like he does before. And I was thinking that Barbosa would also go and there would be a wolf. And I was thinking that in an equally positioned match, Barbosa is more experienced, more knowledgeable. He would find a way and beat. But he didn't give him any chance. He just took everything. So that he did very well.
Krasimir Kostadinov: but from now on the later, all he needs to do, so he says that now, he said that he only trains with 30 kilo now, this way. And- He said that, yeah, that was maximum that he- I would suggest him this as well, not to go so crazy about the weights, but not to think that that's not important because some of the reason that he's so successful
Krasimir Kostadinov: is because of those trainings as well. Right now he is still doing very well because he trained it a lot. But if he doesn't train such a long time, slowly he may lose that part. So there are some trainings in the gym you may not replace with the table time only. And there are some things at the table you do you may not replace with the weight. So tell him to not to give up on one of them and only one. So make sure that he trains some of that and this.
Krasimir Kostadinov: But technically, he needs to really train at the table and focus on mostly controlling the opponent's pronator and pressing the arm. When I say pressing the arm, I don't mean hook. Still with the pronator, but controlling here and then pressing. He needs to use his wrist, not with the weights only. He needs to use his wrist at the table. If he does that more, trust me, he will be untouchable. Okay.
Krasimir Kostadinov: Like more wrist control and more side pressure. Wrist control impregnated side pressure, his back pressure is already like off the roof. But that's not enough. He is only pulling that way on brachial radialis and then Tatachins is putting whole his body, the brachial radialis cannot handle this. How does the Tatachins put in this pressure? Because of the connection here. Connection here. So he needs to turn here.
Krasimir Kostadinov: and roll and open here so he cannot put so much pressure. You cannot stop this pressure only with your brachioradialis pulling that way. You need to really go to the root of the strength and then cut it and roll it so that the guy cannot put so much pressure. You know what I mean? Yeah, exactly. I will exactly translate. I hope my arm will be visible because I use this video effect. Anyways, so...
Roman (Translator): I don't want to go back to the time when Marcius was still alive, when he was still alive, when he was still alive, when he was still alive, when he was still alive, when he was still alive, when he was still alive, when he was still alive, when he was still alive,
Roman (Translator): because it is a very important source of information, but it is also a very important source of information. So, in the 1630s, as you can see, it is very important to have a second eye. But at this point, it is also very important to have a good eye, and this is a very important point, if you want to know why you are here. It is clear that if you look at the brachioradialis, that is, the pyramid that we see,
Roman (Translator): And when there was such a side pressure, Brachioradialis could not do anything about it, but he was able to do it. He said, if you go to your place, I will put my side pressure on your supernatant, and I will cut off your head.
Roman (Translator): and he doesn't want to touch anything, he doesn't want to touch anything, and he wants to touch something, he doesn't want to touch anything with his hand, that's what he wants to touch. Yes, he will be untouchable. Yes, he will be untouchable. Yes, he will be untouchable.
Krasimir Kostadinov: Thank you, thank you very much. No, that's the truth, that's the truth. Anyways, so thank you very, very much for me, and I thank you very much for your translation. It's good that, you know, not only someone who knows Georgian language, you and also Tornike is the same way, both know about arm wrestling, so it is very good that whenever I talk, if some Georgian guy would come here to translate, it would be very hard for him to explain the technical details,
Krasimir Kostadinov: since you guys are also fan of our messaging it just helps a lot thank you very much we understand stuff that you are saying sometimes yeah yeah yeah and thank you thank you thank you and you take care see you in istanbul istanbul is
Krasimir Kostadinov: okay thank you thank you and thank you everyone who watch us you all take care
