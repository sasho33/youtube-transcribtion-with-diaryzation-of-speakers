Raimonds Liepiņš: We are live. We are, right? Yes, yes, we are live.
Raimonds Liepiņš: So we waiting for Arsene to come. So how have you been? I've been good. I've been good. Training is very busy. I'm busy and doing a lot of stuff and it's but I'm spending more of my energy on training and preparing for the East versus West matchup than anything else. So everything in between has been really good so. Good.
Engin Terzi: is uh are you able to uh are you able to follow the uh like do you see me clearly or is i see a little bit like frozen is it because of my internet or your internet i see you clearly i see you clearly okay okay do you think do you see the the the chat because i i can't um i i don't have the computer right now with me yeah yeah i i see the chat that will look for where yeah
Engin Terzi: Yeah. Okay. Okay, that's good. Yeah. I did very heavy, heavy pronator training today is good. But can you imagine that since New Year, this was the second pronator training because of the COVID and this and that, you know, just, but it was very heavy. Just second time. Just second time. Yeah, second time. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Only second time. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: But I train good, good. And it's just cramping, you know, just whenever I do like this, it's cramps. I had to supinate to make the cramp out, you know, just train, see, oh, it's catching. What would be the... I can say that I am like between 80 to 90% about pronator. About bicep, a little bit behind, 70%. I was up to 80, 85, but whenever you don't train, it's again going down, you know, just, but I will, I will take time. I will take time. Hmm.
Engin Terzi: what would be your volume for for the pronator so how many exercises um how many reps would be like your normal volume i mean it depends you know if i i do the pilot today today you know just going and then down and whenever i go up maybe the reps are getting lesser because because of my injuries i i cannot start directly with my uh max i can't
Engin Terzi: Like, for example, today I ended the pronator training from the cable, the machine, with 90, but I started with 25. So I went 25, 35, 45. Okay, yeah. And then I went 60, 70, 80, 90. And so it totally depends, you know. When I do lighter, I can do more reps because it's more likely warming up. Whenever I go up, I mean,
Engin Terzi: Like different type of six, seven different type of, um, I think seven I have for pronator and all of them, like people, people, the way that they see pronator, the way that I see pronator are like totally different. Whenever I train pronator, I don't train my pronator alone. My pronator is always like with a combination with a muscle group, sometimes with legs, sometimes with fingers, sometimes with wrist, sometimes with spination.
Engin Terzi: always coordination and there is always something um like in my mind i'm armless in there but i'm our medicine against someone who is pulling with different styles because the the application of pronator is from different areas is up to the opponent if the guy is going totally deep in your arms
Engin Terzi: you are actually applying the pronator from here. But if the guy is trying to top roll you, you know, you need to control and pronate. So it just, so different, difference, yeah. I can say that I see most of the pronator trainings, even the so-called advanced ones that I see on the internet, like far behind. I'm not so much, how to say,
Raimonds Liepiņš: like challenging you know about all kind of saying i i i know how to train everything but about pronators i honestly believe that it is just like bar bottom brother your your uh bread and butter bread and butter that's your yes on your tombstone they all right thing in turkey also pronator
Engin Terzi: Yeah, maybe I should change the nickname. Anyways, how was your preparation? I watch, I follow yours. I see you confident. I saw that yesterday in like 10 minutes video, you repeated the word confidence like probably 20 times. Just go watch again. You're like, I'm confident, I'm confident, I'm confident, I'm confident. I was like, wow, the guy is confident, you know.
Raimonds Liepiņš: Yeah, it's, you know, you can, I can say, or anyone can say, I will win, I'll destroy. The only thing that I know I'm certain of is my confidence, my confidence from, you know, I put in a lot of work in this training, like this, it's been 40 training sessions already, no days off, just two days off in life. You know, so that's where I feel confident. I get on table with Giannis, I get on table with Raimonds.
Raimonds Liepiņš: confident you know and and it's it gets better so i i
Raimonds Liepiņš: thought maybe i will do like training and just share my journey but that would distract me because then people would say yo you need to do this or you need to do that or you lifted this i don't want any distractions at this point so when i'm saying i'm confident like even today i did a great training session it was hard we get on table confident i feel and more and that was like i mean i mean you know i think
Engin Terzi: I think that it is all about if everything is going smooth, if you are at your best, everything is going as planned, that's why you are confident. But the confidence doesn't always mean that you're going to win because it's also up to your opponent, that your opponent may be better. But you are as good as you can be right now. This is what I understand from the way that you are using the word confidence. I believe both my arms are the best thing I've ever been on this point.
Raimonds Liepiņš: Mm-hmm. That's good. That's good. And lately, last several years, we're doing very well. I would say January or even when I get back from East versus West, it's different. I get on table with Raimonds and Giannis, and they would be the biggest test because without them being really, really strong, they're really, really tricky. So when they know how to...
Raimonds Liepiņš: you know, fuck you up and they and I still can be better. You know, I'm like, OK, OK. And it's like it's not like they want it. Like I'm like, don't hold anything back. Make me, you know, work because they came to we we had this agreement.
Raimonds Liepiņš: guys come to the practice and we will work on what I need, you know? So they are there for me. So they are just, and we had a great practice. Sadly, I will not be able to practice with Giannis for two weeks. He did a road trip.
Engin Terzi: You know, the good part about training with those guys is that they are very technical and tricky. So, I mean, when you go to the table competition, when you go somewhere else, I mean, nobody can surprise you because you have enough of tricky training partners that, you know, you are ready for anything. You know what I mean, right? I know. Exactly.
Raimonds Liepiņš: And I think that the last time I was this, like, I felt that good was when I was for fraud. And even though I lost, I felt great. Oh, we have Arsene. Arsene just joined in. Hello, Arsene. Arsene, can you hear us? I think he says connect in the audio. Yes. Hello, Arsene. Hello, hello. How are you, my friend? Not bad, I think.
Arsen Liliev: good to see you my friend good to see you so i think i must speak russian because it's it's it's difficult come on come on listen no thank you i can understand you but for me difficult to speak english going in from prudnik is learning
Arsen Liliev: I learned English only in school, so I haven't practiced about nine years when I stopped pulling in armwrestling. So for me, I think it's difficult. I can all understand what you guys say, but for me, it's difficult to explain you something.
Engin Terzi: yeah yeah but just just try to do your best as much as you can as much as you can when you cannot explain then go to russian because you need to improve your english even speaking hermes is speaking so it's time for arsene lily to start speaking english too if you want to be world star because i i have just one question when is when is arsene pulling vitaly that's my only question
Engin Terzi: Arsene cannot beat Vitaly. Vitaly is too good for Arsene. I think so too. I think so too. So I still please translate. Remember last time we were chatting, you were saying that you are confident against Vitaly because his style is, you know,
Engin Terzi: well fit in for you yeah yeah so uh he's teasing you the raymond's already started teasing you yeah
Arsen Liliev: Ryan, please translate it. First of all, I'm still... We're just kidding. I understand, I understand. No, no, no, I'm talking about something else. For now, I'm just dreaming. I don't know where I am, I'm just dreaming that maybe one day I'll come back. There's a small possibility that you'll come back. Well, there's always a small possibility, but I haven't been back in nine years.
Arsen Liliev: So he said that there's a small chance he will come back, but still he's just dreaming about it. And I said, how big is the chance? He said, like, the chance has been always there, but we don't know. No, no, no, no, no, stop, my friend.
Engin Terzi: he said that it's just a discussion between two friends. We were not making any decisions yet. It's just discussion. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'm going to post every, every words of the, no, no, no reverse, no reverse all the way forward. No reverse in the car. We even, we even selected the possible opponents who,
Arsen Liliev: Vitaly? No, no, no. He cannot start from Vitaly. When was the last time you sparring under the table?
Arsen Liliev: It's hard to call it sparring. I could just come to the gym and fight a little. There was nothing serious. I didn't want to win. The last sparring was my last competition. I think it was 2013. I asked him when was his last day. I lost Arsene.
Raimonds Liepiņš: yeah yeah yeah we lost him yeah i asked him about uh his last training session on table he said it was 2013. he's like sometimes i will get on table but he hasn't he said today was the first day he did the cardio but he said he's doing cardio and then after after uh i think he's gonna go to antalya for the vacation and oh my tornado is cranking like crazy oh
Engin Terzi: You need some electrolytes. You need some electrolytes. After he comes back from Alanya, Alanya is a town of Antalya, and then he's going to start seriously. His opponent is even known and his opponent already accepted the match. Yeah.
Arsen Liliev: no again i said uh 12th of july i will go to the thing i will go to the boardroom and then i will come back to home and then i can understand what is my level now and what i can do and what i can do no no you said you said till the boardroom i i remember entirely wrong but till the boardroom you said you're gonna do cardio after you come back you're gonna start lifting not this side
Engin Terzi: yes yes yes but i don't know what is the level that i can do in the future yeah i mean you need to start slow you know just come on just yes yes around you're 60 years old john is 58 tazila 55 you know all these guys trust me you are like what 34 i mean you have the you have the muscle memory like when you left the sport you were right here right here
Engin Terzi: and then i'm very hooked to this thing i very hope yes yes trust me trust me everything is there just you just need time you don't need to even start right away you know you can start november you can start february just start slowly train everything will come back you don't need to push yourself he just wants you back that's all he wants he wants no not only me not only me it doesn't matter i will tell you something raymond it is not that easy to um our mess in world to produce
Engin Terzi: an athlete like Arsene. And whenever he's young, you know, were we not happy when John come back after six years? Don't you think that our missing world changed, you know, after he comes back? I mean, of course that, you know, whenever he says that it's enough, it's enough. But even John can come back.
Arsen Liliev: like 57 and now he's 58 this guy is only 34 years old this guy if he wants he can put 15 more years yeah no no no again i want i want to explain one thing uh i i think i can see you want to buy one by one
Arsen Liliev: With Engin, we periodically communicate, chat, joke about this topic. Probably the only person who could bring me back to all this was Engin. And please explain to him the fact of trying, I'm not talking about coming back, the fact of trying to return to armwrestling.
Arsen Liliev: It has nothing to do with money at all. I want everyone to understand that. Of course, I had some offer, but maybe it was more than everyone else. But he could always pick up such words to touch my interest in car racing again, which I absolutely never had.
Raimonds Liepiņš: So, Arsene said that there's only one person that could interest him in coming back to armwrestling. And that's you, Engin. And it's because of the conversations you always have. He said at the start when he left, he said maybe if there was some money involved, but now he says, like, it doesn't matter what's the money. He's like, if maybe something will happen, it's because of you, Engin, you know, because you have put an interest in him that has never been there.
Engin Terzi: And I really, I really trust him. And I really respect him. You know, he's just like a wind, you know, he just come 2005 left 2013 things in eight years that people could do in like 30 years, you know, he just like, like a wind, you know,
Engin Terzi: You know, and I, it is just, you know, like, like, don't you remember like how, when Alexey Voivodo left the sport, how sad the community was, like they wish that, you know, and up to today, how many years left and people are still like bringing him to the conversation so many years. Why? Because he was so good. And Arsene is also the same way.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, but for Alexey, we understood that he had to choose an Olympic sport discipline. I understand. But for Arsene, he is still very young. He's 34 years old. I mean, great puller, you know, he just like, I mean, he has beat Richard Lucas. He has win against John and he has win against Travis. Many, many guys, many, many guys. I mean, he was just here and Zola, Haji Murat, they were doing incredible things. And also,
Engin Terzi: Something that, Arsene, you are thinking is disadvantage for you, which is being away from arm wrestling. Yes, for a short period, it's a disadvantage. You are away. But you realize that how much your injuries and everything are just recovered because of that.
Arsen Liliev: So I want... Yes, but I want to say one thing. I... Ram, translate, please. I trained literally two workouts. From these two workouts, I lifted something on the biceps, some 40 kilograms on the barbell. In general, light weights. Nine years have passed, I haven't done anything. In my life, my hands don't hurt. But even if I lifted light weights, all those injuries that I had, nothing went anywhere. This probably surprised and surprised me.
Raimonds Liepiņš: he said that uh even though he took like nine years off when he does any kind of training even with very light weights and with the table on anything on table he said all those injuries are coming back like they're not going anywhere he's like only because if it starts quick i mean if he does very lightweight and everything trust me even with light weights he said straight away he feels all those things that were hurting because he feels it he feels it but trust me i i have been there i i
Engin Terzi: have been arm wrestling almost as much as his age trust me you will start you will feel the pain just continue like one month and everything will be uh recovered but only thing i can tell you arsene when i saw you in 2018 antalya world championships you were 30 years old but you look like 40 years old now after you're losing weight now you look much healthier right now
Engin Terzi: Oh, so you didn't look good there. You were overweight and you were like, you know, I mean, but now what's your weight? Yeah. 106. How many kilos did you lose? It's about 15, maybe 16. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: And I think it's good for your health to people think is bad, but just as long as you are careful, I mean to compete losing unnecessary fat and everything being active is just great thing you know this, this is my opinion, so, by the way, how do you find East versus West do you enjoy.
Arsen Liliev: Sorry, I don't understand. Raimonds, please translate. How do you like the matches from East vs West? Dave you watched any shows? Of course, I've watched. I'll quickly tell you about it. Some fights just amaze me, so to speak. I'm very interested. And some fights that... I, of course, read the comments, I listen to the discussions that happen. I, maybe...
Arsen Liliev: Maybe I don't understand armwrestling so well, but I understand something about it. It's funny when people start comparing names and never compare the form of the athletes they fight with. For example, let's take Richard Lucas, the world star of the world armwrestling. Let's take Vitaly Laletin. They are not comparable. They don't fight for names.
Arsen Liliev: It seems to me that all fights are very interesting, but some fights are just a disaster. Beautiful names, beautiful cover, but in fact it's 2-6-0, or rather 3-0.
Raimonds Liepiņš: uh yeah he said he follows he watches all those matches but sometimes he's he feels like uh he he said like I'm not a big arm wrestling expert but sometimes I can tell when the match is just gonna be two guys with big names where it's and it's not gonna be a like really interesting match he said
Raimonds Liepiņš: he doesn't like when that happens but sometimes and most of the time like in the last event it was great matches that were happening um
Arsen Liliev: Well, the best match I've ever seen against Estes was against Ron Bach and Zurab Tavberidze. I really liked that match. You understand the thing. He said like his favorite match was Ron and Zurab. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That was just crazy match. Yeah, yeah. Incredible it was. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I think you need to be brave and come back.
Engin Terzi: just just just tell him tell him to get up open his legs put his hand in between and if something is coming to his hand tell him to continue if not he can stay at home
Raimonds Liepiņš: what does he need to figure out between the legs what what was the right words he needs to get up just widen his legs put his hand in between and then if anything is coming to his hand let him continue if not he can stay at home so um
Arsen Liliev: he said you're you're the greatest motivator he knows if if there was just a thousand spartans they would take over the world with you in charge so
Engin Terzi: he said he's not spartans yeah oh okay okay okay he said he's not saying no he said i know i know i know i know i i i love arsene i love arsene arsene is just like very close friend very good friend we have good memories and that that's only my wish but if he i mean i want him to try i want you to try
Engin Terzi: you feel good just go for it and i'm i'm by you but if if you feel like you know you can then it's okay you know i understand for me is important your how you feel happy my friend how you feel yeah yeah yeah anyway so uh we have we have uh upcoming matches super matches can i ask your predictions your opinions arsene i will try to to say something about this but
Arsen Liliev: What do you think about, for example, John Brzenk and Ongar Bayev? Oh, I think, John, this match is the most difficult for John in all East from West. Yes, I think you agree with me because Ongar Bayev is the one of the most technical and the most, I think it's the most motivation.
Arsen Liliev: And it's not going to be an easy walk for John. The only thing I don't know is how Angerweib will react after the surgery. If he shows the form he had in the top 8, I think it will be a close fight.
Raimonds Liepiņš: It's not going to be an easy walk for John. He doesn't know where Ongur Bayev right now is after his operation, how this feels. But it will not be an easy match. Yeah, I agree. I agree. Arsene, I think that nobody will be able to control here. I think both will go like this. With the flat wrist, they will, I think, fight like this. Back pressure and pronator like this.
Engin Terzi: So if the match will be like you explained, I think John is the favorite on this match. Yes, I agree. I think for Ongarbaev to win, Ongarbaev needs to have the full control. I don't think John is going to give up. I think Ongarbaev may risk control, only like here. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Who is that? Rahman Peredip?
Arsen Liliev: Okay, can you go ahead? Go ahead. Okay, can you go ahead? Go ahead. Okay, can you go ahead? Go ahead.
Raimonds Liepiņš: So he said most of the time, the match will be, uh, Ken organ by, uh, stay away from John's hand control, but control John's wrist. And, uh, if, if he can do that, or if, if he fails to do it, it's John all day because John will just take control. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think that none, neither of them will have the risk control over the other one. I think both will go outside.
Engin Terzi: and both will have the pronator but not wrist and they will they will be like my opinion um any any interesting question can you see on the chat oh and arsene uh what do you think of uh pata chings and rudnik
Arsen Liliev: Raimonds, please translate. I don't want to offend anyone, neither my close friends. But I want to say about this match that this is the fight where two names fight, but not two athletes. That Hutchings is a very close friend to me, I love him very much. I can say that he is my friend, but most likely it will be 3-0 in favor of
Raimonds Liepiņš: He said he doesn't want to offend anyone because both of them are very close friends of his and he loves them. But he believes that Prudnik will win that match 3-0. Arsen, you think he's gonna win easy or hard match?
Arsen Liliev: Prudnik is a technical athlete and a thinking athlete. I think he just won't let him fight to get Toto Hanschitz into the hook. And most likely, maybe it won't be straight 3-0, fast, fast, fast. But it will be a fairly confident 3-0. I would like to make a mistake. Let the fight be very equal. But I think, after all, Evgeny Prudnik 3-0.
Raimonds Liepiņš: He said Prudnik is very technical, very smart. If he chooses to not let Todd Hutchings get inside, it might not be fast wins, but it will be very convincing wins. But, of course, he doesn't want to see that. Arsene wants to see a good match and with a lot of things going on on the table, even some hook wars. But he believes that Prudnik, if he chooses to, because he believes he has the power, knowledge, and technique behind it.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, I think like whenever I look at Prudnik about well-roundedness, hand control, intelligence, like he's probably the closest to John Brzenk about that way. Maybe. Yes, yes, yes. Chance Shaw is asking, what does Arsene think about Chance Shaw versus Zurab match? Yeah, Chance Shaw is asking. You know Chance Shaw.
Arsen Liliev: Yes, I know what you mean. Raimonds, I don't know what weight category it will be, but I understand that it will be an absolute weight category, right? Absolutely. Well, Zurab is about 100 kg, Chance 140 kg.
Arsen Liliev: I'll say it again. All my predictions are just my predictions. I don't want to offend anyone, to say anything to anyone. I don't know. For me, Zuratov-Tavberidze is...
Raimonds Liepiņš: So he said it's very hard to pick the winner for this match because it's uh there's a huge weight difference and he believes Zurab is extremely strong and very good armistice but Changshuo has been progressing like incredibly fast and he says at this point he believes it's 50 50.
Engin Terzi: 50 50 yeah because we have chance in the chat so i just i wanted to ask is he asked the question so yeah i understand um like i don't understand like like some people are saying that it is mismatch like zurab is going to destroy chance whenever i look at their style i mean that is for sure that's not what i see i i think it i think it differently i think the chance has better chance will be way better positions to win this match
Raimonds Liepiņš: Yeah. Because he takes the hand so easily and Zurab folds his hand a lot of times. I think Chance can do things that pretty much John could do if John chooses to do. Better things, Toprol better than Ron. He's bigger. And the thing will be, can he pin him without losing the side pressure match? Which I think he will. I don't look at this as a mismatch. I'm just looking at...
Arsen Liliev: I think we should understand that Changshuo is a natural weight. He is big from nature. Zurab has just gained weight. I say it based on my experience. For him to have a good weight, he needs 3 months, maybe half a year. Someone needs a year to work out the weight and muscles that he gained. I don't know. This fight is 50-50. We will cheer for a beautiful armwrestling.
Raimonds Liepiņš: I don't know if it will be more beautiful, but I think there will be a fight.
Raimonds Liepiņš: zurab has a disadvantage of that he's not big he's building himself to be big and chan shaw has been big forever so you know whenever you gain muscle or weight you still have some time to adapt to get bigger and the people who has that frame you know advantage will always have that advantage uh in uh he said it's 50 50 when he hopes for a good match so yeah yeah yeah i mean what i am saying that zurab is gonna go that way
Engin Terzi: i think my pronator is going to ah crazy i mean i can't um gotta get some salt get some salt drink some salt um i what i'm just thinking that zurab is gonna go that way and chance is gonna have the risk control and roll and then
Engin Terzi: Zurab is going to put in chance. It will be a great match. This is like perfectly like inner side pressure versus like wrist control side pressure. This is what I see. I mean, I think it's a great matchup, but of course you look at it like as a style and then there is something called power, strength. Then we will see. But I don't see Zurab beating
Engin Terzi: uh chance easy i mean i believe i shouldn't say i'm an organizer but the chance that uh chance winning quicker quick is higher than the chance that zurab is winning quick i'm not saying chance is going to win quick but if zurab wins for sure there will be a war
Engin Terzi: Arsene, you have been the heaviest as you dropped me 103 kg at the last A1 and you said that in 2012
Engin Terzi: the Bulgaria eight-man event, you were 100 kilos, you said, right? Yeah, yeah. And if you compete now, if you compete, you're going to pull sometimes 100, sometimes 110, you know, categories, right? Yes, of course, but still, according to my feelings, the most comfortable weight category for me is 100 kilograms.
Engin Terzi: said he feels most comfortable at 100 kilos yeah yeah but he's since he is very good i think he can he can go on competitive maybe one event 100 kilo the other event you are 100 304 kilo you can pull 110 kilo category and like arsene uh those guys prudnik ongar john tata chings iraqli krasimir you know all those guys you know like
Engin Terzi: Who would you be interested to pull most if you are in very good shape? You come back and you are ready. Which one? Yeah, but that has a story. That's why you want to pull him. It has some story, but other than that,
Engin Terzi: like about like curious interesting like which one would be would you would be good match
Arsen Liliev: Someone is just interested in you, well, statistically. I got it, yes. I got it. Probably, it's hard for me to answer. You see, I've already fallen out of the snow for a long time. You know, you look and think, could I win it or not? I can beat them all. All and always. You can't forget about that. That even in this form, I can beat them all.
Arsen Liliev: Yes, the only problem is who will be easier for me to win and who will be harder. I think it will be harder with Prudnik. I've never fought with him, I don't even understand what's going on. That is, Ongarbaev, Ongarbaev, I say it again, this is only my opinion, Ongarbaev is a perfect version of Trubin. This is my personal opinion.
Raimonds Liepiņš: So I asked him, like, your question, I asked him, like, what would pique your interest? And I said, like, do you have someone you've been watching and you think, like, can I beat him? And he said, of course I can beat him. The difference is easy or hard match. You know, that's the only difference. You know, even now, he said, I can beat them all. And he said the Prudnik would be the most interesting one because he never has faced him and he has so many weapons. So...
Engin Terzi: Prudnik would make your mind tired because he can do many things. But whenever you know someone, you know that he's going to do this or that. But whenever you put Prudnik, you never be sure if he's going to go inside or outside or side, you know, because he is very technical guy.
Arsen Liliev: Yes, Engin, please translate it. Engin will remember him. Once there was a man called Ruslan Kokoev. He was an absolute world champion in 1999. And he told me, it doesn't matter at all, your opponent is fighting in the top, your opponent is fighting in the club. If you are the strongest of all, then it doesn't matter at all who is in front of you and what he will do. What was his name? Ruslan Kokoev. Ruslan Kokoev? Yes.
Raimonds Liepiņš: he said he said uh ruslan told him that it doesn't matter if your opponent is great top roller great inside puller if you're stronger you gotta beat him yeah yeah i understand arsene do you remember
Engin Terzi: uh one time you told me that you were in your very best shape ever probably it was the last a1 you were 103 kilo and you said you were incredible shape incredible shape and you went there to be dennis cipenko and you said that
Engin Terzi: you hit him as hard as you know you have never hit someone you hit him harder than anyone and you said that you hit the wall and he beat you like this and you said next day your arm everything was so hurting like a you know bus hit you or something yeah
Arsen Liliev: That was probably the best of Denis, right? His best shape, huh? Well, Rama, translate this, please. It was our first meeting with Denis. It was in Latosha. It wasn't A1. We didn't fight in A1 because I had Andrey,
Arsen Liliev: It was the first meeting with Denis Tsyplenkov in Latoshino, in the Moscow region. That's when everything really hurt. My legs, my back, my neck. It was as if a bus hit me.
Engin Terzi: He said that was in Loto Shino. Yeah, that was the first time he tried with Denis. He said next day, he felt like he was hit by a bus because everything was hurting, the legs, the back, everything. And the match was just only one second, right? No chance for me, no chance. Yes, yes. Yeah, yeah. The question, the reason I said this, right now, the whole world is talking about Levan Saginashvili. If anyone in the history
Engin Terzi: could beat him or not uh in my opinion because dennis is like slow puller with the control we have seen him having a little bit trouble with dave chaffee a little bit you know and not little bit in fact very big yeah trouble you know even one time beat him um so almost all the time wars yeah yeah so i i just said wrong when i said a little bit i don't know what what i'm thinking but um
Engin Terzi: Besto Levan, I know you're from Russia, but Besto Levan and Besto Denis, and if you also think their technical, the way that they are pulling, how do you see their match, honestly?
Arsen Liliev: Raimonds, please explain. I've been thinking about it for a while, and I've even divided it into points. Why has there never been anyone in the history stronger than Levan Saginashvili, and no one will beat him until he gets tired of it. I'll try to note, Raimonds, do you hear me, Raimonds? Yes, yes, yes. Yes? Three, four points, literally. I, as a professional athlete myself, who really understands something in this.
Arsen Liliev: It's a super genetic monster. Big hand, big palm, big fingers. Second, it's trained constantly and always. Third, don't forget that the money that the Lebanese get now has never been in armwrestling. That's why the three components, the genetic monster, are constantly trained, that is, they are constantly progressing. At least they don't roll back.
Arsen Liliev: He receives the biggest fees in the history of armwrestling. No one would ever beat him in the past, no one will beat him in the future until he gets tired of it and wants it.
Raimonds Liepiņš: so he said he was thinking about this like a few days ago and uh because everyone's talking about it and he said he believes no one will beat 11 and we have never seen anyone stronger because he follows three steps and those three steps are he the three things first he's genetically gifted like
Raimonds Liepiņš: built for arm wrestling like absolutely everything's hands everything is big second he's work at it he trains really hard and he keeps progressing he just keeps getting better and better and better and he's very motivated and third he earns enough good money to keep himself motivated he gets like most money in arm wrestling you know and uh at least at the very high top and he will just keep getting it so you have all those three things and he said like
Engin Terzi: He doesn't believe anyone can beat him. Arsene, don't you think that Levan for a super heavyweight is also very technical?
Raimonds Liepiņš: Yes, yes, yes. He's very good. He's a very good armwrestler. Last match, nothing was opening. Everything was closed. You saw maybe, I made a video where I said, I believe, and I don't throw these things, I believe he's the strongest of all time. But it comes as a package. Armwrestling doesn't come just from bicep lifts. It comes as great technique, great speed, everything.
Arsen Liliev: he's the whole package like ridiculously yeah let's understand that uh lebanon is definitely number one but the fact that he won devon alorata is not at all an indicator of what is now called he is the king of the table the king of the table he became probably five years ago and devon laureate is far from the person who is now probably second third fifth and maybe even seventh in the world
Arsen Liliev: Devon is just a North American armwrestler. When he started, he beat Devon. He beat a regular athlete, nothing more. I would be more interested if Vitaly Laletin trained and gained 20 kg. I would be more interested if Dave Chaffee was in great shape. But I wouldn't be interested if he fought Devon Larratt.
Raimonds Liepiņš: So Arsene said, like, even though he just won Devon, he said, like, and he became king of the table. He said, like, he was a king of the table five years ago. Like, he doesn't believe Devon is the next guy in line. He's the number one from North America, and it was a big match to have. But he still believes there's guys that would be bigger threat to Levon and bigger test to him. And in your opinion, Arsene,
Engin Terzi: Where does Devon rank? Or Arsene, what is your top 5 or top 10?
Arsen Liliev: I haven't thought about it for a long time. I haven't thought about it for a long time. Well, of course, Lebanon is even, you probably need to do, you know, what rating, like in MMA, that is, there is no rating number one, there is a great champion, a great champion, this is Lebanon. And then everyone goes. Because you never, look what happened here, Alex beat Hermes. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
Raimonds Liepiņš: he said like it's it's very hard to to make rankings and he hasn't thought about he said like we should do something like you know where the number one guy the champ is on the top and everyone else is in you know in in conversation who's top 10 top 20 but there's only number one guy and everyone else kind of deals in the same because we just saw but i i kind of disagree about like
Engin Terzi: Just still thinking that this guy beat that guy, you know, Alex beat Ermes, Ermes beat that guy. I mean, I think, like, we should just look at today. The things are changing as well, you know. I mean, like, we don't know if Alex can still beat Ermes. We don't know. We don't know if Ermes can still beat Genadi.
Engin Terzi: We just don't know. What I'm just saying, yes, they did. We cannot take anything away. But we don't know if it is the fact of today or not. That is why we are setting these matches and to see where everyone is. I mean, like, you know, just in any sport, you know, today this team beats the other team, but like next week the other team beats. In arm wrestling, it doesn't make difference in one week, but in six months, in a year, a lot of things can change because we are learning, learning from
Engin Terzi: are mistakes you know these are young guys most of them are young guys they they also progress a lot and uh arsene what do you think about artem morozov with dave cheffy does artem has any chance or no um
Raimonds Liepiņš: But unfortunately, he has not yet gained the strength that he will have in 5-7 years. And in this fight, I think Dave Charpy is a clear favorite.
Arsen Liliev: And that's Jerry and Genadi match. All the matches that happen with Genadi, I always like them very much. This is my close friend, I always cheer for him, I will wish him victory. And I find it difficult to answer this question. I would like to listen to your opinion, Raimonds, and Engin. How will this fight go? What will be behind the table?
Raimonds Liepiņš: He said that he always loves Genadi, watching Genadi's matches. He's a good friend of him. And he said, like, of course he wants to, he supports Genadi in this one, but he wants to know our opinion in this match. Like, what do we think about this match? The scenario of the match, how it would go. I see the way Jerry to win this match, he needs to do an incredible start.
Engin Terzi: and he needs to bring Genadi to halfway down and he needs to catch him on his brachioradialis here. If Jerry goes and if we catch him here halfway on the brachioradialis, then he has his chance. But he really needs to bring the match there. Yes, but he will be there. I mean, Jerry needs to start so good and needs to come till here and then
Engin Terzi: the Genadi needs to like on his brachii radialis here, Genadi should not be behind, should not put his shoulder behind. If he puts the shoulder behind, then that's trouble for Gelli. So Genadi needs to be caught on his brachii radialis. The brachii radialis is not a super strong muscle.
Engin Terzi: I mean, compared to someone just putting like Jerry to put whole shoulder, press shoulder, whole body on it. Yeah. But if he is behind like this, if, if, if Genadi can involve his joints, then I think that Genadi has the edge. So Jerry's chances, uh, with his great start, this, this is my opinion. I don't know what Raimonds thinks. So I think it's,
Raimonds Liepiņš: Jerry is like, I think he's awesome, but he's very one-dimensional. Everyone knows exactly what he's going to do. And Genadi has a lot of options. He can hook or he can top roll. In my opinion, I think he will top roll from the first one. So he will see, does his brachialis hold? Can he hold the position? And if it holds and he can still bring him back,
Raimonds Liepiņš: it's it's not going to be an interesting match if it doesn't hold next match he will go straight for the hook so he will try to win the center and get on put him on his bicep then the other way around so i think ghanani has a lot of a lot of options the only thing that can save jerry in my opinion is jerry coming in two times stronger if jerry comes in like ridiculously strong where he just drives through it doesn't matter what you do then he wins
Engin Terzi: I don't think he can drive through, but he can at least put him in a better position. What you are saying and what I'm saying is exactly the same. He needs to be so strong that not to allow Genadi to apply his own game plan. So putting Genadi in a position that Genadi has to play
Raimonds Liepiņš: Jerry's game, you understand? Jerry is very good when he drops his wrist so low that it's way under your arm. So it's like it's not even on your wrist. It's so low that you cannot get it out. And if he can do that,
Engin Terzi: and be strong enough to stay there, he can win the match. I picked Genadi as favorite in this one for obvious reasons, but Jerry can surprise us. That would be interesting. Genadi is because he's a very well-rounded guy, you know. He doesn't work. I mean, he can make many others, you know. That is the thing. That's why Jerry needs to be stronger.
Arsen Liliev: And what do you think, Arsene? Yes, I agree with you, but I think one thing. In all your discussions, Ramit, I now understood one thing. I thought that there was nothing worse than the King's Move movement in the armwrestling world. But now I understand that there is one more fight that is worse than the King's Move. This is the fight of Jerry Kudraty.
Raimonds Liepiņš: he was thinking that there's nothing more terrible in armistice than king's move but then he remembered there's there's a flop risk price of jericho yeah but the flop risk is only ugly you know it's not like you know like
Arsen Liliev: No, no, I admit when the fight is with an open hand, when it was some kind of heavy fight, up, up, they are like this, like this, like this. But when you, in my understanding, when you start from the start, you give your hand and you start some kind of movement, for me it's not armwrestling at all.
Raimonds Liepiņš: he he said like it's it's for him it's okay when it happens in a match when someone loses the hand if i be without the hand intentionally from the start he said like yeah he doesn't like it yeah he's a toppler of course he's not gonna like it yeah yeah you want that connection i don't like it i really dislike i don't like it it's bad
Raimonds Liepiņš: especially if you have some elbow issues it's very bad yeah it's and it's it's it's not a lot of guys that will will do it intentionally because most of the flop risk pressers do not survive they do not survive like we we can look back at the history and there's been a lot of guys that do it intentionally from the start but they are gone and it's we still have just jerry pretty much i mean just think this way like if we are 100 people here 100 people but
Engin Terzi: knows about arm wrestling just say like dead with shoulder pressure trust me not even 99 people will say jerry all hundred the first name they will come to the mind is just jerry that jerry is the greatest flop wrist presser guy you know yes yes yes yeah yeah when you take top roll you will remember many names you will remember arthur
Engin Terzi: Taras and you know many guys Cobra you know their pets and you will remember many names but whenever whenever you say Floprist yeah and let's let's go some other way Krasimir and Irakli are saying oh it will be very good match yes yeah yeah
Arsen Liliev: I'm not asking if it's good or not. Just tell me your opinion. I think it's going to be a war. Because the whole fight is going to be in ties. And last time Krasimir was not in very good shape. I don't know what shape he's going to be in now. But I'm sure it's going to be one of the most spectacular, heavy, calm matches.
Raimonds Liepiņš: He said he doesn't know what kind of shape Krasimir is going to come in. He thinks the match is going to be a strap match for sure. And it looks like it's going to be a war from both sides because both guys have pretty much good ways to win the match. Arsene, do you think if it is a war, if it is not an easy match, do you think that Iraq can win the war if it is a war?
Arsen Liliev: This is a very good question. Engin can ask a good question. If there really is a war, a heavy war, it seems to me
Arsen Liliev: I think Krasimir will be in this fight. Because he has more experience and he is more used to such fights. He has endurance as well. No, no. You have to understand. There is endurance. When such a match starts, it's my opinion as an athlete. It's endurance that comes to the fore. There is some character, some power of the spirit, so as not to let go and to endure. Yes, yes.
Raimonds Liepiņš: So he said if it's a long match, if it's a hard match, Krasimir is going to win because he has not only great endurance, but he has character. So he has the willpower not to give up and Krasimir always has it. Like we showed, it's over his head. He has that much willpower. So I'm just thinking that if Irakli wins, I think it needs to be fairly easy. If it is just a war, I think...
Engin Terzi: I think Krasimir will have the edge if the match stops in a neutral position. You know, when I say neutral, one is like this, the other one is like this. I mean, yeah. I agree with you 400%, yes. Yeah. And another match, Oleg Zhokh versus Dadikyan, 102-kilo weight limit. Is it a good match?
Arsen Liliev: Yes. I've never seen... When I fought Dityan... Well, maybe he fought, but we didn't meet. No, he started only in 2014-15. He was very young, I think.
Arsen Liliev: He's very young. We talked about him before. I'm not going to talk about him. He's one of the best athletes in Russia. And many people told me that he's just physically incredible. But there's a small disadvantage. Psychologically, he doesn't reach the level of a top athlete. You know, where you need to be 100-101 or something else.
Arsen Liliev: Where you have to invest at least 90%, he can't show 70%. I won't say who said it and what was discussed. That is, physically, he is ready. If he pulled up his moral strength, mood, ability to give his maximum, then the match will be very close. If he can't psychologically overcome himself, then most likely there will be a defeat.
Raimonds Liepiņš: He said that he has some talks with some Russian athletes as well and he doesn't want to say any words, but he said they had a talk about Dadikyan and physically he's like incredibly strong, incredibly... But remember, Dadikyan is losing 10 kilos for this match, Arsene. Yeah, yeah. He's going down to 102 kilos.
Raimonds Liepiņš: okay listen yes i will try so he said it's it's not about him physically being strong it's about mentally being strong he said sometimes and this was the the guy that he talked to said to him that sometimes he cannot go even to 90 percent and if it's a tough match and you get in bad positions and he doesn't push through those positions he might lose the match so but
Engin Terzi: yeah but it's not my opinion it's yeah yeah that's that's yeah and how about your opinion arsen
Arsen Liliev: I don't understand, because we have to understand one thing. For a person who is not used to losing so much weight, no one knows how it will affect. I've lost weight all my life, from 7 to 12 kilograms. For me, losing weight was already part of the preparation for competitions. For a person who is not used to or does not know, but is not used to losing weight, especially so many kilograms, there may be problems.
Raimonds Liepiņš: He will not feel himself. Not only here, but here. And in the head. When your hands are getting thinner, it's hard to understand. It seems to you that you have lost a lot of strength. Dave you seen the match between Zhokov and Betkely? Yes, Betkely is a good athlete. Betkely is just great. But Dadikyan is much stronger. Much, much stronger.
Arsen Liliev: We have to understand one more thing. If the first fight is going to be heavy, it doesn't matter who wins. It doesn't matter who wins, but it's going to be a tough fight. In the belt, with a broken wrist. A person who throws off so much weight doesn't know how his body will react to it. You may have such a pump that you won't be able to shake your hand. There are a lot of small things that will make a difference.
Raimonds Liepiņš: So he said for him, the biggest thing would be the weight drop. Because if you're not used to cutting weight all the time, you don't know how your body will react. And if you get in a tough match, we talked like I asked him, did you saw the Achilles match? And he said, yes, Achilles was awesome. But that again is way stronger. He said like way stronger. But still, if the first one is a tough one and you don't know how your body will pretty much react to it.
Raimonds Liepiņš: know maybe you will get a pump like and it just doesn't go away so he believes the weight drop is you know it's not in favor of daddy kyan it's in a big favor oleg shock i understand yeah um arsen um how about uh who wins here uh pauline or arsen lillia oh but sorry i don't know who is pauline pauline
Raimonds Liepiņš: Paul in a more talkable much um who did uh this this guy is Pinocchio he knows Pauline you know I really don't know who is pulling I never I never watched me this much oh really we'll talk about a match of East versus West uh
Engin Terzi: david ramos he's playing with you i even sent him the videos of it he asked me opry opponent for november and i already sent him the videos of pauline he knows it he's just playing so again you have you have one mistake like a organizer of this great event you never speak before
Engin Terzi: You know why I did it? It is because you said you're going to come back and you are still like, you know, oh, I will try maybe. And then now I do this.
Arsen Liliev: so that you cannot escape anywhere. No, no, no. I want to say one thing. When I... Roman, translate, please. When I even went to compete and was 100-200% sure that I would win, I never said that, yes, I would win these competitions.
Engin Terzi: What? He just left. He said even for, I think something went wrong with his phone. He said even in competition that he went and he knew he would win, he never said he's going to win. I know, I know. That's not my plan. I'm just trying to, I'm just trying to, you know, just not to escape. I asked Pauline, Pauline, can you beat Arsene Lille? He said he would beat the shit out of him.
Raimonds Liepiņš: I do not believe Paul Lentz saying any of those two words. He never said that, he never said that. Of course he didn't say that. Paul would say that it was a great honor, I would love to pull him, it would be amazing. Yeah, this is exactly what he said. He said it would be an honor, yeah.
Engin Terzi: but i need to provoke arson but looks like more i try to provoke more he is running away he's acting like he's acting like he has internet problems he's trying to run away
Raimonds Liepiņš: Maybe he wants to beat you. Paul said he would destroy you without any problems. And I said, Paul, you've never said that. He didn't say that. He said it would be a bigger opportunity. Paul is a cool guy.
Arsen Liliev: Engin is a bad organizer. Engin is amateur because Engin loves our message so much.
Arsen Liliev: All he wants is Arsene to come back. That's all. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
Raimonds Liepiņš: he said uh you you are a great organizer but you should have a little bit more uh patience patience you should have a little bit more patience you know just work slowly so i have a plan we just bring him for east versus west four we just let him sit on the first on the first row watch all the matches get really itchy and then he'll get on table yes yes
Arsen Liliev: in august august yeah you come to watch yeah uh
Raimonds Liepiņš: He said he wanted to come for the first three, but there's always been some problems and he's kind of afraid of it. There's some other problems that are out of his control for him to come. I would love if Arsene was there. It would be awesome. It would be good, Arsene. The things are changing. Now, our medicine grows so much. And now, a little bit
Raimonds Liepiņš: drama needed as well this is what i see please translate raymond
Arsen Liliev: Yes, we will create this drama. We still have plenty of time. We will create this drama, don't worry. And if I get there in August, then I will say so many things that the drama will be enough for the whole world. We will put you on a press conference. I will be there. If I fly there, I will be there.
Raimonds Liepiņš: he said that there's like there's always going to be time for drama so don't worry if he has a chance and he will get to east versus west four he'll make a lot of drama there and he'll you know he'll be happy to be there i i think if you come you will come through uh
Engin Terzi: Tbilisi, or you will come to Vladikavkaz? Vladikavkaz is not problem now. Not problem. Okay, from Vladikavkaz directly to Istanbul? Yes, yes, yes. No problem. Okay, okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Anyway, so I think everything will be good. And
Arsen Liliev: So again, you must understand that I, for now, I think that I can beat all guys in this world. Maybe only, maybe only Levan. Yes, but I'm not trained about nine years and I'm nothing for wrestling now. But in my head, I absolutely think that I can beat all guys. Maybe, maybe Levan can beat me. Maybe. Maybe, yes, maybe. Not 100%, maybe.
Engin Terzi: yeah okay okay okay yeah but you know whenever whenever um um until you talk words words are your slave once you talk that you are slave of your words so people will tell you
Engin Terzi: Just do it. No, one problem that I can beat all these guys in this shape. No, not this shape. Not this shape. Just train and your arms doesn't look bad, huh? By the way, your arms look good. Not bad? No, no. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, no, no, no, no. I remember the picture you sent me. Yeah, looks good. Don't say bad, please.
Engin Terzi: Bad boy, bad boy. Engin, Engin, bad boy. Engin, the bad boy of arm wrestling. Yeah. Anyway, so, I don't know. Like, just let me know, my friends. Like, arm wrestling world really, like, will be richer with your presence. Trust me. I mean,
Engin Terzi: Like, all I want is just like, while you are young, I mean, just, you don't need to push, push, push, push yourself so much. Just stay under 100 kilo. I mean, you are a great arm master. I mean, just, if you love it, just train. You don't need to really push yourself. I mean, but just know that my door, I mean, East versus West is open to you. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Engin Terzi: Thank you very much. Thank you. Come next month here for this versus Westport. Just join us. Let's go together to restaurant, watch together. And maybe you put there will be seven title matches. It would be great if you put maybe present. Oh, it will be. It will be a big honor.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, yeah, yeah. One of the titles you can present. And I don't know, we can go together press conference. You can say your opinion. But don't be too respectful. Be respectful, but not too respectful. If you want to say this guy is going to beat the other guy, just say it. Don't be like, you know, I respect both guys. I think 50-50, you know. So, Engin, I'll say you one more time. Now it's very, very long time to the event.
Arsen Liliev: i think we can do this this video about two weeks before this event and he said in two two weeks before the event he can say who will win and what his thoughts are right now let's give some time for the guys to prepare for the matches
Arsen Liliev: Yeah, but how is he going to know two weeks later in which shape they are? I mean, he has a secret agent following the athletes where they are? He said he's consulting three of the athletes for the event, so he cannot give out all the secrets now.
Engin Terzi: oh i'm joking anyways yeah anyways so and thank you thank you for joining arsene and keep in touch my friends and please come back please come back and thank you i want you and uh ryan to be my guest as well me and ryan yeah ryan bowen and you yeah he's
Engin Terzi: he's afraid from uh doing any social media now i'm kidding yeah of course of course yeah no problem did you did you see his last challenge that you know he's he's gonna ask all of his subscribers to subscribe your channel if he loses and he said can you do the same thing yeah sure whatever yeah but you're gonna they're gonna unsubscribe your channel and then subscribe to his if you lose no they won't no they won't
Engin Terzi: yeah today i was watching his video against about about krasimir and which match he was no he's talking about corey west and western john yeah john bersing match i was watching him carefully until he said that you know jones and krasimir styles are very similar to each other both have the wrist control with pronator base and i was like no no no no yeah then then then yeah yeah oh
Engin Terzi: We don't have to talk about his expert skills. We have to talk about his arm wrestling skills. Yeah. Which are non-existent, so it's fine. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And I think he wants to... I think he is thinking that if he beats you easy, he's going to make it more interesting for the fans, you know. He's not going to beat me. I think he's not even thinking about you.
Raimonds Liepiņš: He even made a poll after I beat Ryan Mons, who do you want me to pull fresh after pull first? And he put my name there as well. Hey, Ryan Bowen is the second greatest of all time. I beat him. I have a match with Levan. That's the plan. I'm not even thinking about Ryan. I'm just thinking about Levan.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, yeah, I understand. I understand. And the last question before, because who do you think Raimonds would be the best opponent for Levan right now? I am thinking that I think that even his underdog, you know, I think a well-prepared Hermes could be. I think Hermes makes sense. Vitaly makes sense. Celaya makes sense. So whoever we can make, but I
Raimonds Liepiņš: like we need to give a guy motivation. He just needs to arm wrestle. He wants to arm wrestle. So if Ermes is the next in line, let's do Ermes. If it's Alex, let's do Alex. If it's Genadi, I don't know if they want to do it, but in my opinion, Genadi is very dangerous match for him. I asked him, I asked him, I asked him, I said, you know, Levan, who do you want to pull? He said he is waiting a match and he will choose his opponent, uh,
Engin Terzi: by the result of that match. And I said, which match is it? He said, Corey vs. Ryan. Makes sense. Exactly. Exactly. And Arsene, who do you think that Levan should pull next? I'm addressing you again, yes. Again, before that, I called Hermes
Arsen Liliev: The next one, right? When Mourinho was called a special one, I talked about Hermes. I don't know what was the reason, but I don't know what kind of defeat Hermes got recently. Who did he lose to? Kordechian.
Arsen Liliev: If you were already at that level and you were supposed to be the next challenger for the title of king, you shouldn't have allowed yourself such defeats. If he hadn't lost to Alex then, none of us three would have doubted that the next fight was supposed to be with Hermes Gasparini.
Raimonds Liepiņš: He said if Hermes wouldn't have that loss on Alex, there would be no doubt in any of our minds to make that match as the next one. Right now, he says, like, it's very hard to predict. But who do you think? Hermes, I think it's Hermes. You know, yeah.
Arsen Liliev: Most of all, at least 3-4 years ago, when Vasily Kuznetsov was asking me, even 5 years ago, who do you think could be number one after John Brzenk? We talked about it with Engin, I always said that I liked the fight and progress of Hermes Gasparini the most.
Raimonds Liepiņš: He said like he had this question asked five years ago and even with you, you have talked in the past. He said like the progress of Hermes Gasparini kind of shows that he could be on that top one day. So he might be the next in line.
Arsen Liliev: Do you understand what happened in armwrestling? For the first time in the history of armwrestling, the champion himself chooses the next fight, they impose it on him. This has never happened. As always, the champion is told that the next fight will be with this and that. No one can tell Levan now that you will fight with someone else if he doesn't want to.
Raimonds Liepiņš: said the first time in armwrestling history we kind of see where where the top guy is kind of picking his match because you know everyone is so far away from him that you know first time we see where if if someone would say like this guy is next in line levon would be like no this guy is next in line you know so it's an interesting thing yeah first time we are seeing a huge gap between like number one and the next two guys yeah yeah next guys yeah i understand
Engin Terzi: anyway so anyways guys thank you thank you arsene thank you thank you again yeah it's an honor to have you here thank you and to thank thank you raymond for coming and joining us you are not the translator you are also an authority in our messaging it's just like your presence add a lot thank you thank you for helping raymond
Raimonds Liepiņš: Thank you always. It was very pleasant to talk with you. It was very pleasant to talk with both of you. I had a lot of fun. I'll see you all on East vs. West 4. Yes, yes, yes. See you in Turkey. Bye, guys. Bye, bye.
