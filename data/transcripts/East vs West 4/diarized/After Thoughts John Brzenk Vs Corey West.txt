Engin Terzi: It's 4.20 in the morning. Hello, guys.
Engin Terzi: Just want to share my thoughts. Yes, yes, yes. He was incredible. He was incredible. Yes. Hello, guys. It was incredible. Yeah. Yeah. I... Yeah, looks like he's in top 10. Yeah, that's how it looks. Yeah. And...
Engin Terzi: corey west is a beautiful human being i mean the way that he won the way that he lost he was he was the guy was just like so good natured guy you know i really like his personality the corey west yeah and john is amazing i mean of course i wanted john to win no disrespect to corey but um
Engin Terzi: like he's incredible he again did a hat trick you know he did like he was so close to lose you know without the strap it was so close to the pin pad and he finally uh was successful to sleep and in the strap he slowed him down on his pronator and slowly turning and tired cody and one he was incredible incredible
Engin Terzi: yeah i expected if you go watch my prediction video i expected michael and john to win but the truth is i didn't expect john to win inside so it just shows that corey has a very strong wrist
Engin Terzi: I mean, my friend, about top 10, you know, I'm not saying I'm going to rank John top 10 because of beating Corey West. But in opinion and the facts, you know, like by results are different things. In my opinion, John is in top 10 probably. But he needs to beat someone from top 10. But we saw Corey against Alex. Corey, I mean, gassed out, but he was not, you know...
Engin Terzi: far away from Alex Erzviso so I cannot say that um Corey and John are far from top 10. um most likely they may be in you know but they need to pull someone from top 10 to see you know there has been fouls that side this side you know just
Engin Terzi: I don't know what's his problem with all this, but I just saw two great athletes. Of course, one of them is greatest of all times, John. And the other one is incredibly strong guy with a super good nature. You can see from his
Engin Terzi: I mean, the way that he took the loss, you know, it was just like... Anyway, so... Anyway, so again, I said, if you go watch my prediction video, I predicted Michael to win and John to win. But I, again, didn't expect John to be...
Engin Terzi: able to hook Corey it was interesting that you know he was able to hook that while it was so hard Krasimir to stop him and John's wrist didn't look so great after his comeback about the hook inability um but he he he used his experience and he
Engin Terzi: It was very interesting. He hooked Corey and stopped him. Evgeny the rounds that he lost, he still was able to hook him. That was interesting. And Michael versus Pat Hutchings. When Michael went totally outside, open arm top roll, I thought that Hutchings looked better. And that is why Michael went...
Engin Terzi: inside and but after after the match I saw Michael was saying that you know all he needs to do is just beating Levan's riser while he had these problems with Tata Shinx you know no disrespect to Todd but Todd is nowhere near to Levan's level so I mean when Michael went outside
Engin Terzi: I mean I can't say that he beat Todd's you know riser or something you know both have had lost the wrist I think maybe even Todd had a little bit even better hand position at least it seemed to me that that way so I mean I don't understand okay never mind uh
Engin Terzi: No, Corey did not toy with John. Corey just couldn't finish. I don't understand which match you watch. Nobody toy with nobody. I mean, John hook him, slow him down, and beat him. I don't understand what you're talking about. Either you or I, we don't know about our mercy. Probably I'm the one who doesn't know about our mercy.
Engin Terzi: the half sleep i don't know it was just like he was gonna go sleep anyways and corey just let it go to go to strap and they they they're getting strapped i don't know
Engin Terzi: Oh, I'm sharing my thoughts already. John's incredible. Right after the match, even during the match, Hermes wrote me from WhatsApp, like, he was, like, hanging. John's amazing, amazing. He's like, you know, wow, you know. He was, like, at this age. I mean, people, people who understand. No, there is no surprise, my friends. There's no surprise. Just go watch my prediction video. I said, Michael is going to win. And Joe...
Engin Terzi: john is gonna win but i didn't expect john to beat corey inside not that he couldn't beat him inside but i thought that if john would go inside corey would flash him as he did to cross him but somehow he just hook him at the age of 58 he was so quick probably he used a little bit pronator and everything and they just suddenly hook him i was like wow wow how what what a speed you know he was incredible
Engin Terzi: um i mean john top 10 yeah possible this guy i mean like listen alex is very high level athlete and corey didn't seem far from alex of course alex won but just watch round one and you know he was just like of course alex was better but it was not like you know like total easily domination or something so
Engin Terzi: I thought that Corey is in top 10. And, I mean, who cares, you know, if it is 9th place or 11th place or something. I mean, these both athletes are incredible, you know. I really enjoyed the match. Yeah, yeah, John just did incredible.
Engin Terzi: Brzenk versus Hutchings would be a war. War, yeah. Yeah, Corey could have won, but John could have won as well, and John did it, you know. So it was a very big surprise at the end. This is all superheroes that does that. I thought that John was going to lose, you know, and then he just did it again, you know.
Engin Terzi: Um, John versus Alex. I would favor Alex. Do I take John's chance against Ongar Bayev's higher now? I mean, Corey has more horsepower to the pad, you know. But about controlling ability, especially within the match, I can say that no disrespect to Corey, but Ongar Bayev is better armwrestler.
Engin Terzi: than Corey but Corey is of course more horsepower more side pressure uh so it's different things two different things but I'm I'm I was already thinking that the match was gonna be close on Ongarbaev and John and John was gonna win I still think that way I I give the edge to John 51 49 against on Ongarbaev but I shouldn't say of course this you guys are asking
Engin Terzi: um John versus someone top 10 yeah yeah let him let him finish what he's doing in his weight class um now on Ongarbaev and then if Prudnik wins against Prudnik in November I mean anyone who is taking anything away from John is just not the right thing to do
Engin Terzi: John literally said that he was this close to heart attack. Okay, since the match finished, I'm gonna say this. John told me not to tell anyone, but since the match is over, John said he got called in Mexico during his vacation. He said that he doesn't feel good, but he said, don't tell anyone. But since the match finished, so there is nothing wrong to say. But the guy got called before flu or something, he said,
Engin Terzi: Paul Talbot anything is possible my friend but I mean I'm not planning to set more than 10 matches so I need to be careful about the you know promising people um guys whenever you guys all time asking me how about this guy what about this guy this guy you suggest me 20 30 guys and then whenever I said all those matches you guys are saying you said in so many matches too many matches so
Engin Terzi: I mean, I do my best. I do my best to, I mean, set as many right now. I promise Pauline. I promise Matt Mask. And I promise Rambats. I promise John matches. And then we already have some other matches. And, of course, Dave Chaffee. So I'm planning to limit East versus West with five, with ten matches.
Engin Terzi: Oh, John is already gonna pull Ongar Baya, my friend. And then he's gonna, in November, he will have a match, but it's all up to the result of the August matches. How much you are happy now with Burzing performance? I mean, listen.
Engin Terzi: John has done so many things that nothing that he can do can add more than what he has done. I mean, only if he just goes and wins the super heavyweight against Levan or something, then you will say, OK, this is crazy. Other than that, he has done everything. I mean, he has done so much greater things than beating Corey West, which is also very important.
Engin Terzi: The only thing is this guy is now 58 years old, is coming and still beating someone like Corey, who gave trouble to Alex. It's amazing, amazing, you know. My friend, don't, don't, don't disrespect Corey. Please, I don't want to block anyone. Corey, Corey is a great guy. You can see he's very
Engin Terzi: Very healthy. Very good nature. You can see that guy. Very nice guy. Thank you, my friend. Hello to US. Thank you for good words.
Engin Terzi: I mean, I shouldn't say that. John will probably get angry with me for saying that, but he said don't tell anyone, but I just couldn't hold myself. So I waited match to finish, you know.
Engin Terzi: I didn't watch what they said after the matches because it is after 4 a.m. here. I just didn't want to be late. I just wanted to do a quick, quick live and then chat with you guys and then go to sleep. John Burzin can beat Alex Kurdesha. I don't know about that, but I would bet on
Engin Terzi: alex but if so quickly i mean like if you would ask me i would never say that um john could hook corey i thought that he would flash him if he tried to hook him but jones like imagine that you know it was very hard john i don't remember john getting flashed
Engin Terzi: In this match. He lost, but I don't think he got flashed. But I remember Kaka Shinks on the first round got flashed by Corey West. And Corey got much better since then. And Krasimir got flashed three times in a row. But John didn't get flashed. Evgeny he lost two rounds, he was still able to hook him and fight. It was impressive. It was just like very surprising. Very surprising John to hook him.
Engin Terzi: Yes, yes, Corey was respectful. Corey is a good guy, good guy. And he did the right thing to show respect to John. He deserves, you know. I don't see, like, loss-loss. That match was very close. It could go either way. And I think Corey also did a very good job.
Engin Terzi: Hello, Chance, my friend. I do not think John can beat Alex. Alex was more dominant. John lost the hand at the goal. Michael Todd is finishing top 10 super heavy. He's only getting wins. What do you think about Pauline versus BJ? Yeah, Pauline. Yeah, that match was also interesting, yeah. Um...
Engin Terzi: yeah yeah i was surprised i how they said it was three two when we saw that he was on the run and foul you know he didn't win that round probably they watched so many matches and they kind of probably forgot the score um michael thought put chalk only on corey's pet
Engin Terzi: was truly idiot and disrespectful. Please don't disrespect anyone. But the same people... Okay. I tell you, John is the GOAT. I watch him, John Rossi-Corey. This might be... This Spanktoe-Hutchings needs to go into ULTRA TRT. Pull in, pull in, pull in. Great. But the other guy was also very strong. If he was top-rolling, pull like that,
Engin Terzi: Yeah, it's 4.35 here. Todd Zillow is stronger than Michael Todd. I don't know how we can say that Michael beat him. What's the match of the year? Easily. Loved it. You are the best. And you go get some sleep. I will, I will, my friend. I will, I will. But, you know, we all love our match. We watch something that we enjoy and we want to share all together. We all are fans of our match.
Engin Terzi: uh i like to i like to talk with you guys monster factory can wait for the east versus your house and thank you my friend thank you i i hope that you guys will will support the event and we can continue my friends um yeah my michael kors king's movie is done since it is countered by todd todd is also very
Engin Terzi: Smart guy, very smart guy. He started armwrestling late, but he improved a lot. He improved a lot. John versus Hermes. I don't think my friend Hermes would beat John. No disrespect to John, but John should. East versus West matches bankrupt him. No, it is not. Um...
Engin Terzi: You could make a great with your break ground sounds. I have never seen red line like that before, Armand. John Sandu, second interview. Yeah, John told me that he got called before the event in Mexico. Yeah, I mean, one of the shoulder pressure attempt by Michael Todd was stopped by
Engin Terzi: And Tata Shinks, I mean, Michael was too big, too big and too, like he's very well rounded. He could find a way. He went to inside, can't stop him. And then from there he went outside. There were where Tata Shinks got fouled.
Engin Terzi: And then, but I can say that Michael did not feel comfortable with his open arm top roll.
Engin Terzi: It really bothered me that Mike and Rebecca, promoters, were coaching their baby on the microphone. I'm not going to get any older. It was very poor. Okay. Corey doesn't seem to have a lot of heart in the middle of a match. If you guys realize that... I think Corey is very explosive. Very explosive, but...
Engin Terzi: I think he needs to pull for more like endurance, you know, within the match. If you remember when he did the slow starting hook with Krasimir, he also had some problems. Yeah, but those two rounds that he won,
Engin Terzi: he did well, you know, he did well. He continues to hit, hit, hit, hit, and he didn't allow John to really lock himself at the, you know, center, you know. John was only trying to survive, you know.
Engin Terzi: You saw Michael Todd had like 9,000 live viewers. Not too bad. Yes, it was very good. Who has the best chance against Levan in your opinion? Probably Slav, a well-trained Laletin, Hermes and Dave Chappie in the strap, if he can go strap.
Engin Terzi: John should start pulling more heavy weights to see how far up he can get. Yes, my friend, but just remember that when John pulls those super heavy weights, he's putting a lot of miles on his arms. I want John to stay long time in arm wrestling. You know, we need him. We need that guy. The guy is gold.
Engin Terzi: If you all the time set him against a super heavyweight, there will be more and more damage. It's my opinion.
Engin Terzi: michael's king's move is a perfect counter to talk pressure yes yes but it didn't seem like it was going in the way that michael would want it he did not have that total risk control i'm talking about a ground one whenever he tried to get up and then press and then todd just beat him it didn't seem to me that that probably was the reason that why michael just directly went to
Engin Terzi: shoulder press Michael Todd looks better against the touchings but jump into that one is very strange yeah that part that was interesting yeah he should have beaten 100 kilo guy anyways um
Engin Terzi: No, I don't think that the move was fine. I don't think that, you know, he should have much better hand and wrist, in my opinion, against a 100-kilo guy. I mean...
Engin Terzi: I expected Michael to press Tadzilla like that. That kind of move, Jerry also did. Of course, it was different, but whenever... I think that is the most, I mean, possible way to beat Tad quickly. But only super heavyweights can do that, I think. Not someone at Tata Shing's weight.
Engin Terzi: um wow i think i'm much behind this is actually crazy that john won against korean you tell me why did he win he he won because he is he's the god he's incredible i never expected him to hook corey uh it was just very big surprise for me i must i must confess
Engin Terzi: Engin who do you think is the top two or the top two in USA? Dave Chaffee for sure one in my opinion. The other one is probably Michael.
Engin Terzi: Nino, thank you for the support chat. John Brzenk vs. Tozila is the match I want to see. I think that match is going to be set in 2023, but in USA. That is the information I have. Don't ask me more. Tozila doesn't train biceps enough. Somebody says it's not what I'm saying. Hi, Engin Saludos, Argentina. Hello to Argentina.
Engin Terzi: and didn't get Talbot a match. I would, but just my friends. Like, there are so many guys and I need to make only 10 matches. Nishant Sankar. Thank you for your support. Michael Todd versus Arif on East versus West Breeze. Let's see how it will be.
Engin Terzi: Mark says, Engin, thank you for making the amazing matches. We love you, but I will try to bring Kanayi to you in the future. Thank you so much. I mean, just somehow give me Kanayi's contact number or something, you know.
Engin Terzi: Yes, yes, the event was great, my friend. The event was great, yeah. Craig Tuller looked very good. Craig Tuller looked good. Pauline looked good, but his opponent was, I think, much heavier than him. Yeah, John in the last moment. He was 2-2. Looked like John was hardly breathing.
Engin Terzi: And it just showed how much he pushed his limits. And the round three was, wow. It was just like, wow. I thought it was over, really. That guy always surprised me, always. David you think John, do you think John is number one in his weight class if he beats Ongar Bayev? No, my friend. There is Tata Sinks there. There is, Prudnik is there. There are some other guys.
Engin Terzi: There are some other guys. Engin, some people are saying Michael Phelps started those presses. I don't see it at all. What do you think? I don't know, my friend. I need to watch again. I don't know. I mean, if you watch in slow motion, you can find out. I don't know.
Engin Terzi: I don't want to talk about something that I'm not sure, even if I'm sure, I just don't want to go there. There are enough of haters. Engin, have you ever got any interest from TV networks for air and arm wrestling? I mean, yes, yes. I mean, it depends on the offer. Yes, John was incredible, yes.
Engin Terzi: Okay, I came. Needs to see how his next match goes. Nobody is touching Levan currently, but in two or three years, all that could change. It was interesting that yesterday when I did an interview with Jerry and Genadi, and when I asked both guys that, you know, about their top five in the world, and they both didn't mention...
Engin Terzi: Devon there, that was interesting. Could Prudnik beat Corey same way as John? I think yes. No disrespect, but I think yes. We can't assume that John beats Corey. That was 100%. I believe if John pulled the version of Corey, they show up at King of... There is no excuse, my friend. If you set a match and if you pull, that is over.
Engin Terzi: john also got cold but he only told me to not to tell anyone but i just said it but he was also ill maybe that was the reason that he was heavily breathing you know because he told me he told me that don't tell anyone but i got cold in mexico flu or something you know he said anyways guys it is about like four percent or something my my uh battery
Engin Terzi: and okay i thank you guys very much and battery is about four percent my friends and it will and the charger is inside i need to bring it uh i thank you guys for following
Engin Terzi: How does your arm feel two weeks after a match, Engin? Ah, it depends, my friend. When I was young, nothing, nothing. I could just even train in between, a week later. But at this age, yeah, it's terrible. At John's age, terrible. Forearm.
Engin Terzi: pranayadir teras.
Engin Terzi: I don't know how I thicken my wrist area, my friend. I don't do anything. I just train, train, train. This is the result. I never tried to make size, never tried to do anything, you know, just, yep.
Engin Terzi: My friend, after Dubai match, three times I asked Devon if he wants super match in his weight class or lighter weight class, whatever, left arm, right arm, any opponent he choose. And one time he answers, the other two times he just show me thumb like this. He didn't even answer, so I just removed my messages.
Engin Terzi: And I'm not going to ask him anymore. Yep, see? See this? This I can do too, but how do I do?
Engin Terzi: No, Devon is not dodging or something, he just wants to make his own plans, I think. But bicep, bicep looks terrible, you see? You can see the right there, hole there.
Engin Terzi: Let's get in. No, Devon is not scared guys. See, don't write these kind of things. When you're writing these kind of things and then Devon's fans are just coming and just
Engin Terzi: oh english hater or this and that just i'm just saying that i just you ask me if i offer him a match right you said that engine offer a match at devon and i'm only answering you that don't think that i'm not offering them offering him a match i'm offering and if he wants i will set him if he doesn't want i will not sit in that that's so no need to start a drama from here you know anyways guys
Engin Terzi: Anyways, you all take care, my friends, and we will meet again. We will meet again. I will come back with interviews, my friends. Yep.
Engin Terzi: You'll take care.
