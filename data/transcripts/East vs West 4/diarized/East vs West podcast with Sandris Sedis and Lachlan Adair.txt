SPEAKER_03: Hmm.
Engin Terzi: Hello, Sandris, how are you? Hello, doing good. You hear me? Yeah, yeah. You? Okay. I hear you barely, but I hear you. How have you been? Pretty good. Training, training hard, preparing. Yep. And how is your shape?
Sandris Sedis: It's coming together, coming together, but I'm pretty strong at the moment. Had a few practices in Latvia with some guys and none really could do anything to me. So I'm definitely much stronger than I was before. So that's good. And it's not the end yet. Yeah. Hello, Phil. Good day. Hello, Kujushiko.
Engin Terzi: sorry if i pronounce wrong hello to bulgaria so soon lakun is gonna join us and i would like to ask both of you if there is really a story behind this as i am guessing um you know whenever i wanted to switch the matches
Engin Terzi: And you said that no, no, no, no, no, I'm going to block them because it was. OK, he's asking the median ID.
Engin Terzi: Well, we got it. Hello, Engin. Hello, hello, hello, my friends. Yeah, how are you? How are you? Good, good. And you? Good to see you. Yeah, I'm doing good. Yeah, you too. I just finished training. We're all at our tables. We were talking about you, you know, how Sandris is going to beat you so badly. Take your wrist and then.
Lachlan Adair: I don't know. Dave you seen my wrist? I don't think he's taken it. Only if he drops into that desperation mood, he might have a shot at busting my wrist back. But by then, I've got too much of my shoulder behind it. There is no way out. I arm wrestle a lot of Kingsmovers all the time, and I believe I've cracked the code for it. I'm a Kingsmover, so if there is a way, I will find it. Yeah, but... That low wrist...
Engin Terzi: I never seen him doing the desperation move. I think that he even has allergic, you know, he doesn't like that. I don't think that, I think that he would rather lose than trying to pull in that way. You know, he's one of those guys. But that's the only way that he's going to bust my wrist back. So we'll see. We'll see. We don't need to see, but we will. We will indeed. So Lachlan, you seem very confident.
Lachlan Adair: Can you turn your phone sideways if possible? Yeah, thank you. You seem very confident, Lachlan. I always do. I always do. But, you know, the one thing that was always an imbalance between Sandris and I is my gym numbers were always much higher.
Lachlan Adair: But what's happened over the last couple of years is my table IQ and experiences come up significantly. And I think all those numbers can actually be put down and the horsepower can be put down this time. So it's a very different match than it might have been before COVID. So you are saying basically saying that you have always been strong, but now you can transfer more power to the table because of your table IQ. Yeah. And then
Engin Terzi: You are saying that Sandris is in trouble, basically. If he thinks it's going to be an easy day, he's going to be very solely mistaken. But go on thinking that. It'll be fun. No, no, no. One second now. You think that you are saying that it's not going to be an easy day, but you are thinking that even if it's not an easy day, he has a chance to win?
Engin Terzi: Everyone has a chance to win. Sandris, with all given respect, we all train very, very hard. He's very experienced and he's an excellent arm wrestler. Okay. I thought you were more confident than that, so that's why I'm asking you. Okay. Oh, no, no. I'm definitely confident, but respect given where respect is due. So you are saying that he has a chance to win because of the respect that you have for him, not that you really believe. Correct. I'm just trying to steal the pot, you know. Don't get me wrong.
Sandris Sedis: And Sandris, what's your response? I don't know. He has to come in confident. He obviously can't come in and go, maybe I will lose, something like that. But obviously we all want to win and that's all you can do. Be confident in your powers and that you're done enough.
Sandris Sedis: And above his table IQ, I wouldn't say is that improved as much. I don't see, I don't know where you see your table IQ, but I'm definitely, definitely stronger than I was before and just getting stronger by day. Yeah, I can pull anywhere and if there's a way, I will find how to beat him. Yeah. But do you already have like a prayer plan?
Sandris Sedis: that you think is going to work instead of trying to find? Well, I have... Feel and find. Yeah, as soon as we grip, take the grip, I will basically know where I will go. And if it doesn't work, no, I will try something else. I have many weapons in my arsenal, so... I understand, I understand.
Engin Terzi: Ah, let's see, were you very impressed? I will tell you honestly that I was impressed for Lachlan even when he lost against Taka Kings. It was, he had won and at the end he guessed Lachlan out, but when he was winning, he like really pushed the limits of touch. Do you agree with this, Sandris? Like whenever he was pinning him, he was just shaking, you know, he was not like, like I think
Sandris Sedis: um uh uh touching speed lachlan um harder than he beat sonar do you agree with that or no well yeah maybe first first couple of rounds uh todd had to struggle a bit more but uh after that it was uh pretty much in control and uh
Sandris Sedis: just draining Lachlan. But yeah, against Tonev, he looked much more comfortable and much more... Tonev looked weaker than Lachlan did against Todd. I understand, yeah. Lachlan, how long will you be with my friends? Sorry? I'll be coming up to six years in August.
Engin Terzi: six years yeah yeah but but it looks like especially because of the the pandemic you did not have much chance uh to prove yourself because the years that you finally became very very good were the years that you did you could not travel correct yeah there was lots of improvements made we were obviously training um
Lachlan Adair: where we could and we tried many different things but during that time um i didn't let the pedal off the gas at all i know a lot of people spent some long time resting and stuff like that because they didn't have a chance to compete um but i
Lachlan Adair: I didn't stop at all. I didn't take a week off training. It wasn't easy ever. So that really gave me an opportunity to continue making the trajectory. And as you know, when guys get to their fourth and moving into their six years, there seems to be a fairly significant increase over that time. And then we get another kind of significant increase that's noticeable eight years and then ten years. And then it kind of spreads out a little bit more from that. But yeah, two years is a long time to be training.
Lachlan Adair: just arm wrestling specific. I haven't done a lot of powerlifting in the past three years. I probably bench, sorry, I probably deadlift and squat once every 10 days. If that leading up to competition, I've been competing often. I haven't done a proper leg session in months. This is all arm wrestling specific work has been done.
Engin Terzi: Yeah. So basically you train very well, but you didn't have a chance to compete internationally. So it was bad because of the, from the experience way, if you are thinking, because you would, you would have more and more experience by competing that, by the way, how old are you and what's your weight? I'm 32 years old and I'm 112 kilos. Under 12 kilos. And a question for you. Um,
Engin Terzi: Like, obviously, you see your chance higher than Sandris's chance. I mean, you're going there to win. And where do you see yourself, between all those guys that you see at the East versus West under 10 kilo? Like, where do you see yourself? And what is your goal? Like, your goal is to be,
Lachlan Adair: mentioned amongst them or you have a goal to become number one and it's a very normal thing you know I think we all should have a goal to beat everyone at least in our own weight category yeah that that's certainly been the goal um is to become number one in my own weight category I believe I feel it a lot better than than Sandris so I think Sandris is destined for a true super heavyweight he has the height he has the frame
Lachlan Adair: Uh, he's not there yet, but I think probably leading into his forties after many, many years of training, he probably will be a true super heavyweight myself. I'm I'm six foot 185 centimeters. Um, and I'm 32, I think I'm around that 110 kilo mark and I'm here to stay. Where do I, where do I see myself? I mean, this it's always been a discovery all along. I don't think anyone truly knows.
Lachlan Adair: where I stand right-handed just because the matches, the right-handed match that I had in the US was quite easy. No one knows where that big New Zealander, Mate Warangi, sits because he hasn't had a chance to compete internationally either. I just know that I've progressed significantly since our last match where he beat me. Obviously, I got the win on him last time twice, but it's all a discovery. But I do believe I'm high up there and beating Sandris will be
Engin Terzi: uh obviously go a long ways to figuring out just where i currently am but number one in the world at my weight class is certainly something i am aspiring to i understand and if somehow if we squeeze you with the left arm competition there who would you want to pull because a lot of people are coming they are coming only pulling with one arm like if somehow i i uh also asked would you wish to have a like a
Lachlan Adair: a hoop battle with him yeah i'll pull anyone just yeah i'd pull anyone as long as the right-handed match was first and i could use you know because when i competed in the states i i had left-handed first and right-handed i was tired that was a lot so okay so you want to basically you want to beat sundries first and have good motivation before you pull zurab
Lachlan Adair: Just a little, just a little rest, you know, cause all of my, I really want to beat Sandris's right-handed. I don't, I don't train my left arm. I haven't trained my left arm in two and a half years. It gets pull ups. It gets bench. That's it. Um, leading up. Yeah. Yeah. I didn't, I, I, I swear I haven't trained it. Wow. I haven't done the match with left arm.
Lachlan Adair: to pull someone like Paolo. Yeah, I was there. I was there. I was still a bit injured. I can't top roll with my left. All I've got, as you saw, is that hook and that press. This is very painful to me. So I had to stay in and just dig in. You are 32 years old and you started six years ago. So you started when you were 26. What were you doing before? Powerlifting. Powerlifting. Oh, okay. Yeah. I've been in the gym
Sandris Sedis: powerlifting since I was 15 years old. I understand. And Sandris, who is the better student of Janusz Sambolins? Well, me, obviously. Oh, yeah. OK. We'll find that out. From the beginning, been there longer, so I think I'm a better student for sure. Yeah, I don't, I'm no longer coached by Janusz.
Lachlan Adair: I learned a lot of things from him. I think I learned everything he was able to teach me in an online sense. I think if I lived in Latvia, I'd never need another coach. He is excellent. But the distance and the online, it's very difficult to transfer information, especially when English is your second language, though he has very good English.
Engin Terzi: a difficult format to try yeah i mean i mean i always believe that no matter who teaches us what teaches us we all should have uh our own understanding of arm wrestling because our learning should not be limited with some other people's knowledge and experiences we still need to add things from our own selves by knowing how our
Engin Terzi: body reacts, things, you know, it may be different from person to person. So probably that's what you are doing. You learn, but now you are making your own judgments by deciding what is best for you. Yeah, look, I've been really lucky in arm wrestling, partly because of Ryan Bowen. I've been able to spend and stay at John Brzenk's house. I've had a lot of time with Travis Bajan. I've had time with
Lachlan Adair: a lot of really experienced guys and obviously todd hutchins he was really good enough to give me uh tips on what he thinks i needed to work on after that match or obviously very specific to myself and i applied those lessons diligently and i think the improvements are coming every day yeah sundries i will ask the same question to you where do you see yourself like like would you
Engin Terzi: on how to say do you see yourself sometime soon or late pulling for 110 kg title match at east versus west
Sandris Sedis: Sure, sure. That's my goal. Always have been to be the best that I can be. And I think I'm already at tested events, like one of the best armwrestlers in the world. In Europe, sure, under 110 kilos. But it's obviously very exciting to pull other guys and pull for that.
Sandris Sedis: Not overall, but out of all. In your class? Yeah, in my class. For the next 3-5 years, I would want to stay in 110 kilos. See what I can do there. And I'm sure I can do very good damage there. I would rank myself in 3.
Sandris Sedis: At the moment, maybe top five. I can be. Because I'm just getting stronger now, just getting into my stride, into my prime. And it really shows on the table as well, in the gym, everything. But for the future, I don't know. I'm getting, as Lachlan said, I'm a big frame, tall guy.
Engin Terzi: I see myself comfortable at 120 kilos, 130 kilos maybe someday. And maybe I can pull with other guys as well. I understand. And if you beat Lachlan, who would you want to face at East versus West? I'm not saying that I will set you up with whoever you pick, but I would like to know. Just say that.
Engin Terzi: you you beat lachlan once in hook one is side pressure and one with top roll you know i'm just trying to provoke good luck okay who are you gonna pull next i don't know i don't really care i i i
Sandris Sedis: Could pull anyone, but obviously would love to pull such legends as John, Todd, Godzilla, maybe some of those. Marcio mentioned before as well. Probably some North American, North American cooler. So that's also more interesting for me as well. Yeah, some of those guys. Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, I mean, unless it's a title match or something, or we don't have anyone else to pull, I mean, we better not pull a lot of East versus East matches, you know, but it's more exciting to bring the East and West together and then them to pull, you know. And we have another Australian match, Ray versus Ryan, and
Engin Terzi: I watched one of the videos of Ray when he repeated he is confident, like maybe 20 times in the same video. I'm confident, I'm confident. And then I asked him, he said that, yeah, he says that he's confident. It doesn't mean that he's 100% he's going to win, but he's at his best. How is his shape now, Sandris?
Sandris Sedis: really good really good he's really good i think getting it together uh getting his top role game up to the task as well uh also can pull anywhere can press hook uh can tackle the hand he's getting getting uh pretty good and the result the results are showing as well just i think he's also coming coming into his best shape
Engin Terzi: Um, how about, how about if you, if you win against Lachlan you and Matt mass pulling each other, would you be interested? Yeah, why not? Yeah, for sure. Yeah. Yeah. That would be good. Intense match. Another question I will ask you when you pull chance, we were thinking that you were gonna try to that, that, that quick press move, or I should say maybe inner side pressure.
Engin Terzi: then you hit the pronator and then whenever you hit him he he kind of blocked it good and then we were thinking that he was gonna try to top roll you and you were gonna try to hook him and beat him and then after that one everything turned other way then he tried to hook you it seemed like his hook was better than yours and your top roller was better than his so was it surprising for you
Sandris Sedis: Yeah, it was a bit surprising at the beginning. Didn't expect he would hold there so well. But not to make excuses, but you know, I was coming into the match after armours and not really prepared. Just, you know, trying to stay in shape, trying to stay healthy. And I'm definitely much stronger now. I don't want to say percentages, but, you know, it feels like two times stronger now than I was with Chance.
Lachlan Adair: Okay, so basically you're saying Lachlan is in trouble. Okay, I understand. He has to be. Not the hook, though. As soon as you turn that palm up, Sandris says he can pull anywhere, but he can't. Your hook, he's going to be running from my hook as far and hard as he can. I promise you, he's not going to go into a hook with me willingly. It'll be crushing him straight in. He doesn't know the hook. Lachlan, if he goes through, do you promise to just hold him and look at his face before you pin him? If he's...
Lachlan Adair: If he tries to go inside, I'm going to be laughing at him. It's going to be all over. I got way too much side pressure, way too much reflection, way too much frame. It's a bad day for Sandris. Any day of the week. No pronation.
Lachlan Adair: Me? You'll find out. And I hope you keep on thinking that. Just come in nice and confident thinking it's going to be easy, Sandris. It'll be fun. Just so I can see your eyes bug out when you grip my hand. It's going to be easy. I'm just, you know, I know what I can do and I will do it. Well, I know what I can do, so good luck. Yeah, I kind of... Not much, to be honest.
Lachlan Adair: about to find out boy i kind of think the lachlan's hook is uh better this is my opinion but i still think that there is an option uh sundries to topple your wrist so let's see how it will be it doesn't matter that's the thing like i said i train with a lot of really like the guys i train with are 160 kilos plus they're all six foot five and taller they're their hands are huge
Lachlan Adair: So I'm very much used to having to hold onto a big hand. If they take my wrist, it's fine. I've been training like Todd Hutchings. Those angles that he uses are very comfortable for me. And I can put a significant amount of force through that, through those moves with my wrist backwards. Just hold on. Just hold on. I'll be pushing straight through you. Okay, okay.
Engin Terzi: yeah and and a lot on the same question to you what do you think about uh uh ryan's uh shape right now i saw a training video you two together he was like you were trying to do some shoulder press and he was blocking probably he was trying to train for uh race you know that forward pressure and how do you see that match how do you see that measure he's your countryman you probably will favor him but
Lachlan Adair: look what what ryan has is i think a lot of people don't realize how big he is like he's the same height as me six foot one and ray's not gonna have a hope in trying to top roll him it's he's gonna default to his press and look my elbow was pretty beat up after the us in that video that you were talking to but if he sets up in the right way it's uh i think he's gonna roll through ray really easily
Lachlan Adair: They're just too vast in sizes of people. I know they're about the same weight, but Ryan is very fast. He's very intelligent. He can think on the fly. Ray is excellent with match reflection and building a plan from there. But I think Ryan has the upper hand in making those quick, sharp decisions on the spot. That's going to give him the advantage on the day. And Sanj, do you see Ray beating Ryan?
Sandris Sedis: yeah yeah of course i think ray ray is better puller i think uh ryan he has that one lane where where he pushes sideways and ray can very easily explore that hand because i don't i don't believe he has the best hand ever and um
Sandris Sedis: Yeah, if you can just, you know, move through like this, that's the only way I can see Ryan winning. So you're basically... Very different, different opinions. What did you say, Lachlan?
Lachlan Adair: So we have very different opinions of the way Ryan can pull. You've not pulled Ryan. I've pulled Ray. It was many years ago, but I've pulled Ray. I've obviously pulled Ryan, and Ryan is much more than one trick pony. Much, much more. So he's got quite a few lanes that he can exert equal amounts of force in. I understand. Anyway, so basically you are saying that Latvi is going to do two
Engin Terzi: against Australia, and then you are saying Australia is going to make 2-0 against Latvia, so let's see. That's good, like, small team competition. Yeah, yeah, let's see. And if I ask you guys your opinion about the other matches, Lakan, do you closely follow the Eastern Pullers? I try to, yeah. There's so many of them, don't ask me to pronounce their names. Yeah, you don't have to pronounce.
Lachlan Adair: I honestly believe... I believe the East team, they do represent the very best arm wrestling that the world has to offer. Obviously, they have the winning record. So always trying to follow the Eastern Europeans for sure. Because you want to beat everyone, so you are following all the best ones.
Engin Terzi: If you want to learn to be the best, if you want to learn to be the best, you've got to learn from the best. Okay, the question is, how do you see, for example, Irakli versus Krasimir match? These are not only yours, but yours as well, Sam, your possible future opponents, you know, these guys. If you realize that most of the competition,
Engin Terzi: in east versus west is around that weight class between 100 and 110 kilo you know so these are like your possible future opponents how do you see that match i am asking both of you i'd love a match with classy just because it's hook on hook but um to answer your question uh a match between a rockley and
Lachlan Adair: Crassie it's a very interesting one it's a classic top roll versus hook match and I think Crassie is incredibly dominant at his weight I think he's made mistakes in the past trying to go above his weight class and it doesn't doesn't go well with him as Todd says it's somewhat of a geometry problem but I really like that match Irakli is in excellent form and the way he dealt with Barboza I mean Barboza
Engin Terzi: I'm wrestling mathematics, right? Barboza's got the win on Krasimir, and then Irakli's got the win on Barboza. But I think Irakli is doing incredibly well right now, so I think we'd have to give it to him. And who? Irakli's going to win, you think? I think so, yeah. The question is, whenever you see, like, not from your country, but from other countries, two pullers, hook versus top roll, do you naturally support the guy who is going inside because you are a hook puller?
Lachlan Adair: Well, actually arm wrestle everywhere. That's the thing. I have a very confident top roll. Yeah, I saw that. Whenever you're training with Ryan, you were doing like, you know, to your wrist. Yeah. Yeah, it's very easy to top roll. And that is my go-to move, is top roll. It's even Toddzilla's go-to move in the first round too.
Lachlan Adair: no i i think i like seeing inside matches because i know i know what it takes to have inside matches and it's just elbow and elbow frame on frame so it's it it's a it's always going to be a power match that one so it's very entertaining and sandesh how do you see that match i also see iraqi as a as a slight favorite
Sandris Sedis: uh on the second east versus west we touched up on the table and he just felt like a brick wall then and uh very strong dominant hand uh and crossing hasn't looked pretty very impressive lately uh i think he roughly can take his hand and will take crossing's hand and it's just whether he can push through from that position uh maybe
Sandris Sedis: I don't know. It's hard to say. Maybe he can get one round, but I think Iroquois will win at the end. Like 3-1, something like that. Yeah, and Lachlan, John Wurst on Darbyer?
Lachlan Adair: I'm really curious about that one, but Onge Bayev, he's something different. He's something special, isn't he? He's a dynamite. He is for sure special, but there is no one more special than his opponent. I mean, that's true. And look, losing to Corey West that John just lost to. I mean, Corey West is massive. But at the same weight, these guys are around the same weight, right?
Lachlan Adair: both with massive hands, you know, John's going to be catching. We all know that Uncle Bayev is going to be hitting really, really hard. I would have to give that one to Uncle Bayev, unfortunately. But John? Is there a weight limit? I think both are about like somewhere about 105 or something.
Sandris Sedis: Yeah, because against Corey, John looked pretty impressive. The hand control, the inside strength, it's all still there. One thing on Grbata is his speed. He's just very fast, very explosive. We haven't seen him pull very many matches lately. And John is on the rise at the moment.
Sandris Sedis: I don't know. It's hard to go against the GOAT. I think that hand control, especially in the straps, will play a big role for John. I'm going with John on this one. I understand. Langton, did you just say that John lost against Corey? No, sorry. He lost a round, didn't he?
Engin Terzi: Yeah, yeah, two rounds, yeah. Lots of matches, yeah. Yeah, but... Because on the chat, you know, people are saying that John won, John won. So, I mean, you probably said that mistakenly, yeah. Yeah, OK, you are saying that Ongarbaev is going to win, and Sandris is saying John is going to win, and let's come to the very, very important match. As important as John versus Ongarbaev match. Fridnik versus Taka Cins. Welcome. Mm.
Lachlan Adair: Oh, that's a really, I mean, it's an excellent match, Engin. You've done yourself a stellar job there with getting both those guys on the table. Prudnik in his last appearance looked very impressive, didn't he? Todd is on the rise. He's just looking absolutely amazing. And they're around the same weight. I think Prudnik is, what, 110 kilos? No, they will meet at 107 kilos. The agreement was that way. Okay, they're both at 107 kilos.
Engin Terzi: That makes it even more interesting. How it happened that we, I was trying to make the match happening and then I asked them and then they finally agreed on 107 kilo. And then after that, after the agreement, I decided to make official weight classes for East versus West. So it was 100, 110 and over. So people are asking me if it is 110 kg category, how that can be 107 kilo.
Lachlan Adair: because the agreement was made before I made the official weight classes. So they're going to put it 107. Hmm. It's like Sandris and I, we're both about the same weight. So keep it there. Um, but with, look, I always want Todd to win. You know, when you get beaten by a guy, you want him to go through and beat everyone. So I, uh, I'm going to go with Todd on that one. So you're going to ask,
Sandris Sedis: You are saying that Todd is going to win? I would like him to, yes. I'll be in his corner. Ah, okay. Okay, okay. Yeah. And you, Sandesh? Definitely a great match. Tough match to call as well. I think for Prudnik, it will be a little bit more comfortable because he's already at that weight, pretty much. And Todd usually is a bit smaller and...
Sandris Sedis: Usually when you gain mass, you lose some of the angles, but maybe Todd gains it back in power. But Prudnik, I think, is more versatile. Also very, very quick, can top roll. And if it goes inside, I think Todd, maybe. But if Prudnik decides to top roll and take Todd's hand, then I think Prudnik will win.
Engin Terzi: yeah okay do you have money who are you betting on okay okay so last last two predictions you and Lachlan bet on uh yeah yeah yeah you bet for Kazakhstan you bet for USA and then he bet for USA and you bet for Ukraine now and
Lachlan Adair: Okay. How about, how about, uh, Jerry versus Genadi? Another really hard match. I think stylistically it's a, it's really hard. It's a really hard match for Jerry. Genadi is very versatile and, um, yeah, I would like to say Jerry, I really want Jerry to win. I think he's a fantastic guy, but I think just purely arm wrestling, not personality.
Lachlan Adair: Genadi is more active, he's younger, he's more explosive, and I think his style is a difficult one for Jerry to try and counter. So I think Genadi will win. And you, Sandris?
Sandris Sedis: Jerry hasn't pulled in three years, so that's also one factor to consider. And again, Nadia lately has been very good, very active. I think if Jerry can throw that shoulder in and get past the centre,
Sandris Sedis: Then he has a chance of winning. But other than that, I think Genadi can take the hand. He can go inside as well. So I think Genadi has the edge on this one. Genadi, okay. Would your opinion change if Jerry was active in the last four years, three years?
Sandris Sedis: I think definitely, you know, we will have to see how he did, what matches he did. But yeah, that would give us a bit more perspective on where he is at the moment. So, yeah. I understand. And do you guys think that Morozov has a chance against Dave Lockburn?
Lachlan Adair: I think Dave right now presents too big of a human being. So I'm going to go with Dave on that one. He's been really active, unlike Jerry. Dave's taken some losses, taken some wins. I think my resolve is he's a very young man, and I think he's yet to really come into his prime. He's very strong now, I understand, but I don't think he's in his prime yet. So I think Dave will get the job done and get the win.
Sandris Sedis: With right arm, I don't know. Dave has really strong hand, very powerful side pressure as well. And Artyom didn't look, his right arm didn't look as dominant lately in the last few matches. Oh, he looked good against Derek. Against, well, yeah, I mean, against Tobias.
Engin Terzi: No, no, no, no. With left arm, he pulled Tobias. With right arm, he pulled Derek. Tobias was in February with left arm, and then he pulled Prudnik in February with right arm. Right arm, yeah. I still think that Dave has the experience, he has the power, and I will go with Dave on this one. And another interesting match. I will start with you, Sandris.
Engin Terzi: Dadikyan versus Zog. But remember that Dadikyan was over 110 kilos. He's going down to 102 kilos for this match. But is Zog going up? I don't think he can get to 100 kilos. No, no, he cannot. He has never been. He doesn't have to be. You know that he doesn't have to be. He was about 86 kilos when he beat Batkili in Istanbul, the East versus West.
Engin Terzi: probably he will be even heavier, maybe 80 kilos, 89 kilos. I don't know how much it really matters, you know, how heavy he is, as long as he is as good as he can be. But OK, how do you think this match? So Max, he can be like up to 90 kilos, not more, I think. And David has been looking amazing lately.
Sandris Sedis: Obviously training with Denis and all the best Russian super heavyweights and heavyweight arm wrestlers and just killing everybody pretty much. I think that David is just a little bit too powerful at the moment and maybe Oleg hasn't really found his stride yet.
Engin Terzi: Because if only Ani could turn him in, I think David will be able to as well. But do you think that, you know, there are six months between February and August and we are talking about someone who is just coming back to shape. Do you think that Oleg will be in the same shape as February or will he be much stronger since he's coming back from accidents, you know? Yeah, yeah.
Engin Terzi: No, he will definitely be stronger, but the question is just by how much. Will it be enough for Nasir? Okay, I understand. It would be enough, you know. I would give edge to David as well. I understand, yeah. I mean, if Dave was over 110 kilos, like as we normally see him, then I would just say that yes. But now when he's going under 2 kilos, then I am thinking that it will be a war.
Engin Terzi: Because, I mean, no matter how good you are, I don't know, can you control Oleg Zhokh's pronators? Like, can you really control it? Yeah. I mean, like, whenever I think about it, like, where is it going to go? Top row Oleg? Or hook Oleg? Or he will be like this, and he will be fighting like this? I see that, you know, there's something between, you know. I don't think he will curl his wrist, and I don't think he will lose, but he will just stay like in a,
Engin Terzi: Yeah, yeah. And then Oleg will be like this. So I'm expecting a war, but I don't know where it's going to go. Just remember, if Oleg is in shape, he has beaten some monsters. Of course, of course. Yeah. I mean, we don't know just where he is at. Yeah. And Lachlan, do you have any opinion about this match? It's a different one to call. We have the known, which is David.
Lachlan Adair: And then we have the unknown of where Oleg Zhokh is coming back. Yeah, sure. He's a young man who's obviously motivated to come back, so he's going to be in much better shape than he was six months ago. But as Sandris said, David, he's been in really good form. And how long does he have to weigh in then compete? The weigh in? Yeah, the weigh in. Is it 24 hours? Friday morning is the weigh in.
Engin Terzi: the next next days if the next day is evening so probably he will be hundred six hundred seven kilo my guess that he can it depends how much water he will be losing at the last moment i mean if you went down when you're over on your diet he cannot gain more than two three kilo but if he is also losing some water extra water then he can be i am sure he can gain up to five six kilos
Lachlan Adair: Yeah, at that weight, losing five or six kilos, even seven kilos isn't really that hard to do. You know, the bigger you are, the more water you can lose. So and then regain it. So if he's smart with the way that he cuts the weight and smart about the way he rehydrates and replenishes, then I don't think the weight cut is going to matter so much and he's going to come in big. So
Engin Terzi: going to go with david david yeah and what uh you pull against uh chance what do you think about his match versus people are thinking that this is a mismatch and zurab is gonna win easy it's most of the people do you agree with that sundries
Sandris Sedis: I also think, you know, chance should get, you know, someone should pull someone from his own weight class. Like he's just keep pulling, you know, smaller guys. Uh, yeah, I think, I think chance has, has, uh, people says, people says, really? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I made polls. People are saying this is gonna kill chance, you know, like majority on the poll. So that, that is the,
Lachlan Adair: Part that, you know, I disagree. Rob may win, Chance may win, but to say it's a mismatch? I don't know what his thoughts are. Isn't Chance on shutout stakes on StakeKings? I have no idea. I don't follow that. Yeah, I think he is. I think the crowd is split. I think a lot of Americans are betting on Chance, so that might be the case.
Sandris Sedis: It's also a 50-50 match pretty much. Obviously, inside, Zurab has the power. Outside, I think Chance's hand is more dominant. He has the height. Probably can take the hand as well. Yeah, I see, you know, a lot of chances how Chance can win and also Zurab. So, tough to call. Definitely not a mismatch in my mind.
Lachlan Adair: How heavy is Zurab? Maximum under two kilo, under three kilo probably. How tall is he? He's quite short, isn't he? Yeah, he's probably 5'8", 5'9", maybe 5'8". Okay. Chance is a much bigger human being, but you know. And how do you see that, Matt? I think Chance will probably win that one.
Engin Terzi: be very interesting to see what zurab feels like at least on his left hand uh when we get there but um yeah i'll go with chance with this one okay what what else do we have gabriela versus that's interesting since you are from latvia and english from the neighboring country latvia and latvia are just close right close even as the race they are close
Engin Terzi: and even the language a little bit similar and and you know egla very well you have been in lithuanian events probably you have been mature in the europeans world and you know also gabriella and gabriella is much more famous than egla and and people are thinking that you know gabriella is just gonna destroy egla generally you know new fans especially
Engin Terzi: But we know that Egle has the winning record against Gabriela. So I'm just expecting a very close match. I don't know where Egle is. If Egle is at her best, then I see very close. But Egle, for some years, she hadn't been active. So I don't know where she's at. And I think that Gabriela improved a lot from the last time they pulled to today.
Sandris Sedis: So I see a very close match. How do you see that, Sanchez? I have never seen Egle get destroyed. Never. And obviously, maybe she's not in a prime anymore or not as strong as she used to be, but still she's easily the best in Europe in her weight class.
Sandris Sedis: But Gabi also has been very active, very strong lately. On what weight are they meeting? What's that? What weight they are meeting at? No limit, no weight limit. I think then Gabi, I would say Gabi would win.
Lachlan Adair: And Lachlan? It depends how Igler plays it, because the way I watched the match that she had with Sarah Backman,
Lachlan Adair: was very similar to the way that travis watched it i think if sarah made some more tactical uh decisions in the setups and false starting and maybe some elbow fails and getting a little bit more restarts getting a little bit more uh fatigue into gabby's hand because those last couple of matches gabby's hand was really fatigued and she was having to pull with a backward wrist that potentially had sarah had played her cards differently she may have
Lachlan Adair: got at least a couple of wins and may even have won the whole thing. So it all depends, I think, on how Igler approaches that match tactically, I think. I think there are holes in Gabi's game that can be exploited. I don't know much about Igler, but my advice to her would be utilize all the advantages that arm wrestling can give you if you are creative enough. I understand.
Engin Terzi: uh alex on the chat is talking about liashuk versus morozov but there is a small story behind that match that i don't want to openly uh talk here my friend so just don't be so sure about that much anyway so uh we have we have um that very very important match on this uh bojidar versus samushia people because of this is a 85 kilo limit match
Sandris Sedis: These athletes are not so famous as super heavyweights, but these are, as you know, the two of the very best guys around that category. And how do you see this match? I think Samushia here hasn't been as active lately and maybe not as strong as before. And Bovedar has been looking amazing.
Sandris Sedis: Purely just power inside the top row as well. It's a hard match to call, but I think Bozhidar would be the favorite in this one, in my mind. Lachlan, do you know this athlete? I know Bozhidar.
Lachlan Adair: I'm going to ask though, with all this talk of athletes being more active over other athletes and therefore we give the advantage to the ones that have been more active. If you've been arm wrestling for 10, 15, 20 years, would you not think that a long hiatus might actually be quite healthy?
Engin Terzi: and perhaps we're giving the advantages to people who are getting fatigue in their arm from regular matches and you know uh accumulating injuries and stuff like that over the years it depends it depends like if you are not active for some time yes it helps you to recover everything yes but then after that how much did you train to reach to the top you know did you have enough time or not that that's what it matters if you had enough time yes it helps
Engin Terzi: If you pull for so many years, your muscle memory, everything is there, and you quit for some time, then it really helps you to recover. And I would think that if John would have continued after 2015, nonstop to today, I don't think that he would be as successful as he is today. Because he would have put in miles more and more and more at that age.
Engin Terzi: when you are young yeah and then but now he stopped for some years i think he recovered very well some of the injuries and of course he did not come back as strong as he was when he left but big time as we see today he he seems very good of course he is not at his prime like when he was 35 years old but yeah yeah i mean as i said you know if you have enough time to train
Engin Terzi: Like you quit for just some time and then you train for one year. Yes, for sure. Like for example, Arsene, he left in 2013 and nine years he didn't train. If he comes now in three months, for sure he will not be at his best. No way. Yeah. But if you give him six months, he will come close to there. If you give him one year, probably he will, he will, he can still reach to top. Yeah.
Lachlan Adair: Yeah, well, let's kind of get back to Jerry. He's been arm wrestling for, what, 25, 30 years? That's a very long time, and I don't think he... Minimum 30 years, yeah. Yeah, and he took a couple of years off, but he's been training during that time as well, just maybe not as hard as he otherwise would have if he wasn't stuck in the WAL contract. But I think...
Lachlan Adair: and i think that match will surprise us but to answer the question about this current match not to jump around too much i i know bozidar i think he's very good i think that his hook is um uh looks incredible i don't know the other guy so i can't say for sure but i'll be um i'll be reading that one that just pulled pauline at the last east versus west oh right okay yeah yeah yeah but he was 87 kilo as far as he told me
Engin Terzi: and pauline was 100 kilo so it was still very close match and i think that 100 kilo pauline uh in my opinion would also be posh i mean if paul was 90 kilo against these guys the things may be different but when he is 100 kilo then i think he would be bush that as well so and imagine that samusha was inactive but now he had another two and a half months from may 21st
Lachlan Adair: august 6th so i think i think he will be for sure stronger than last time we saw him but i asked him he was 90 kilo now so he will have to lose about five kilos yeah i think all i think all the matches you put on i mean you know i'm wrestling better than anyone i think they're all going to be excellent matches which is the whole point so i think they're all going to be i love it i love it i love it i love it
Engin Terzi: Yeah, I mean, I mean, like, there are like divided parts in our Muslim world, you know, and then, like, if we are like one world, then we should be united, you know, we shouldn't be like, Western guys pulling in WL and other events, the Eastern pool guys are pulling into Zloty and those top eight, you know, and then some pools in, like, they don't have much opportunity to come here, fully around Australia or Asia somewhere.
Engin Terzi: and then um some people pulls in love so my intention is i mean there are like great great great armrests like what can be better than you know bringing these guys together who i don't care who wins i mean let let the better one the best one win you know we all will say bravo i mean but we just have to bring them together so the the years are passing and now we're missing this beauty this was my
Engin Terzi: my my uh intention to give the fans what they want to see not only because what they want to see because i'm arm wrestling fan i want to see that too like i want to see lachlan pulling after sundries someone like like another match i want to see sundries pulling like as he said uh
Engin Terzi: maybe Matt mask, maybe Marcio, it would be good, good matches. You know, we all know our messaging, you know, we know what's good, but I don't want to be only, oh, this would be a good matchup. If I do that, it will be just like only fun. I don't care. Only fun. I care about the, how good is it to enjoy, but I also care to find out who is rank where. Yeah. Yeah. Like, like for example,
Engin Terzi: Levan Sagin actually is the best, looks like he is very dominant. But like there will be a time that like Devon match had to happen, you know, it happens. So there needs to be maybe Slav, maybe Hermes, but some matches needs to happen. This guy cannot sit and just, or like we will said soon, Prudnik versus Kachins.
Engin Terzi: I mean, people think that Prudnik used to win quick. If it goes to the endurance battle, Todd is going to win. So there is a possibility for Prudnik to win easy. Of course, there is a possibility Todd to win with the endurance and more as well. But if somehow the match ends quick, we cannot say that, oh, it was not a good matchup because it ended quick. Because that match had to happen, you know? Like Tyson had many of the title matches, right? Boxing.
Engin Terzi: i waited till the morning 3 a.m 4 a.m in the morning just to watch because of the time difference waited waited waited and then first round he knocked the guy out we went to bed you know we waited for you understand but but it had to happen you know somebody had to fight you know so as i said good matchups are important but also we need to find out who is the best so some matches still needs to happen you know and yeah if you always agree you always said 50 50 matches
Engin Terzi: How can we give a chance to surprise? There needs to be some surprises. There needs to be some underdogs. The underdog needs to be the other guy. You understand? Just look at the polls. Before I said Derek versus Morozov, just go to my community page. Derek was heavily favored. He was like 65-35 for Derek, but Morozov won. Dave Chaffee was very heavily favored against Genadi.
Engin Terzi: Genadi won. There are so many matches like this. So sometimes we need surprise, you understand? We need to send some underdog and maybe the favorite guy in a way is weak. But if this guy wins, then it surprises us. But like, for example, 50%, 50% matches, you are not going to be surprised. You understand? Like, no matter who wins. Yeah, yeah. So that is what I wanted to say. Like, for example, now Derek is going to pull Revaz.
Engin Terzi: the paper there was luke's favorites yeah but it is very excited so did bresnan and bresnan uh i mean derek did yeah very dominant against president president was favorite yeah yeah massively yeah but see people's opinions are changing so quick see after derek beat president everyone said oh we need to set derek versus dave chaffee you guys remember yeah and then
Engin Terzi: after Revaz Morozov beat Derek and then now they are saying like why did you said Derek against Revaz so people's opinion if somehow Derek comes in incredible shape and beats Revaz and then he will be again like here you understand yeah on the people's understanding yeah anyway so it's less than less than four weeks i will see you guys in istanbul i think i will see you even early right on
Engin Terzi: beginning of the month yeah yeah because the the the jet lag is terrible from australia so it's a really long flight on the on the july 31st we have a we will have here in my city one week of seminar uh fia will come here and andre kipriano grasimir will come bojidar will come and um so it is only 45 minutes with the sea bus from istanbul to here
