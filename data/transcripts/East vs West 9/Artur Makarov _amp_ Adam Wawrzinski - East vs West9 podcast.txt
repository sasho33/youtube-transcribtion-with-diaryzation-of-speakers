SPEAKER_03: It is not Tartar, it is Tatar. Tatars are one of the Turkish tribe and Arthur's mother is Tatar and father is Russian. So we are far away from each other for centuries, but we still understand each other. So his mother and I originally we speak the same language, same with the Kazakhs.

SPEAKER_03: In Turkish, yeah. Yeah. Anyway, so let me follow the chat from here. I think very soon, very soon, Adam will come and our friend Paolo will come to
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, Tatarstan, yeah. He's from Kazan. Artur is from Kazan. I'm hearing him. Yeah. Artur, Alan Zolaev is strong? Yes. Strong? Very strong. You are close?
SPEAKER_01: I think it's hard to say. Hello. Hi. It's hard to estimate. It's hard to overestimate, underestimate. I don't know, maybe 20-30 percent, but they are so strong.
SPEAKER_01: Artur is saying that when they pull on AMC, he thinks that it's maybe up to 20% difference. He and Alan? Yes.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but the match wasn't easy. It was just like, how long was it, Arthur? How long did it take, first match? He said that he caught him and it was about 30 seconds.
SPEAKER_03: he had a 30 second match right so i i don't think that during the second match you're having someone he can be 20 if you are 20 stronger you would be like used to guys yeah i i i think it's with a two three percent um yes it's my opinion if the match is that long but he he and alan had like almost over two minute long matches with starts everything in the romagna wow
SPEAKER_04: total of three three matches they had it was two minutes and 13 seconds yeah hello adam good to see you my friends hey hey how y'all doing good to see you you have you have any problem with internet um no it's a little choppy but i'm good y'all hear me fine
SPEAKER_03: um i think we'll hear you a little bit getting cut um but do you guys see him clear or a little bit lagging a little blurry but uh yeah i i see him and i hear him okay okay yeah are you there adam yeah he's breaking up a little bit yeah i'm here making up a good buddy yeah
SPEAKER_03: I'm going to come off and come back on. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. And can you ask, uh, Arthur, I know that he told me he started to train, uh, after April or something, you know, and how many percent of his shape was when he pull at the AMC and you see right now and how is his shape right now?
SPEAKER_02: Well, he asks, he says, we know that you started training so normally somewhere in April. And he asks, in comparison with April and now, where is your form, how do you assess your form, how much has it improved? If you compare it with April, then probably 30%, or even 40%. Because I haven't been doing it for a year at all. There were my problems with my hands.
SPEAKER_01: I gave them a break, but I couldn't just give them a break to heal. So I started training and automatically started to treat them. And thank God, everything went well. I think I gained a good form. This is not the maximum, but... Okay, okay.
SPEAKER_02: um yeah and then he's saying that uh after one year break he started training and uh healing the arms very well so he thinks that it's uh plus 30 compared to april and he said that form is uh the shape is very very good but it's not a peak shape yet but he's getting there
SPEAKER_03: I heard that he had food poisoning recently. How is he now? Because he told me this. Is he getting better? He's asking about your poisoning. He's asking how you're doing. My wife and I went to Turkey to rest. Two weeks ago.
SPEAKER_01: Not two weeks, but that week we arrived and it happened that I got poisoned and there were problems with the stomach. Thank God, a familiar doctor advised me to buy good drugs in Turkey and they helped. That is, it immediately went to improvement and I feel much better. I have already begun to recover. It seems to me that I have already recovered.
SPEAKER_02: okay uh yeah and he said that everything is okay now they was on vacation in turkey uh and they just came back a week ago so he got some uh some kind of uh poisoning food poisoning there and uh he called the doctor and he recommended the uh medication which he got right in turkey and uh it's take care of the things right away so he thinks that he's he's back to normal right now
SPEAKER_03: Oh, he's back to normal weight. Adam? Oh, yeah. Now I think it's better. Yeah, it's better. All right. All right. Good deal. How y'all doing? You have to apologize. I'm at work and Wi-Fi is a little slow. Yeah, yeah. I don't need to apologize. I apologize that, you know, disturbing you during the work. Oh, no, no. You're good. You're good. I broke off. Yeah, yeah. So how are you? How is diet going?
SPEAKER_00: Can you ask? Can you ask? Can you ask Adam? How did that? Oh, sorry. Sorry. Just kidding. Just joking. Yeah. It's going well. It's a little more challenging than I thought. But everything's going smooth. And it's 9192. Are you 200?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I'm about 90, 90, 91. Also, you are like between 198 to 200 already. A little, yeah, a little on the heavy side of 200, probably more like 200 to 202. 202 is about 92 kilos. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: but you are planning last four or five kilos just a water loss right so you have like only two three kilo to lose actually correct correct yeah about it's about right yeah yeah arthur was yesterday i talked with him he was like 164 or 163 and a half yeah
SPEAKER_03: and but today i asked him he's like 165 because he just recently had a foot poisoning he was 167 and he had a foot poisoning so he lost so much weight but now he's back to 165 so he is 165 and then he needs to gain maybe a few more pounds and then you need to lose some and then 85 kilo yeah that works i like it yeah yeah
SPEAKER_00: Sir, I will drop to 90 kilos and dominate. I I I heard you, but you're born 200 pounds. I was born 205. You'll have to shave your beard. Why? If you're going to make 90 kilos, you're going to. You have to shave your beard. It's like I will cut my ears. 5510 pounds right there. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Can I just bullet point to Arthur? Yeah, yeah. I don't understand what the conversation is about. Arthur, we were joking, we were talking about nothing, but the weight, they said that you're about 165 pounds. Now, after all that, Adam is slowly losing weight, but not yet fast, but he's now 91 kilograms, approximately. Yeah, I understood what they were talking about. Well, that's it. 6 kilograms or something.
SPEAKER_03: like i'm sure that right after you accepted the match you watch a lot of matches of arthur am i correct or you are just too confident to not to even watch oh no i uh i did my homework as soon as i got offered the match yep yes watched a lot
SPEAKER_00: So you already started right after Pauline mentioned you about it. Of course. I mean, anybody to not watch film is a little foolish, but absolutely. I wanted to know everything I can.
SPEAKER_03: That's part of the preparation. You got to know your opponent. Yes, yes. Sasha is not like that. I asked Sasha. He's like, he doesn't care about anything. He just like, he's like, no, like he just does whatever he wants. He says that he doesn't really follow arm wrestling even on the social media. Sasha is a special breed. Yeah, yeah. I agree. There has been no time that, you know, I never studied my opponent. If I know that who is coming there, you know,
SPEAKER_00: And what do you think about your opponent? I have no idea how he only weighs 165 pounds. That's the first thing that strikes me. I mean, just in all the videos I've seen, I mean, Arthur, you look enormous. He looks just unhuman. His legs are very small.
SPEAKER_02: I mean, even if his legs are small, he looks like this.
SPEAKER_03: uh he says that yeah i don't have legs and that's true and everybody says that i look too big for 75 kg yeah yeah yeah i think when you look at the bottom it looks like 154 when you look at the top it looks like 187 so it's just kind of in between you know yeah yeah in between that's what our muscles are right yep yep yep except they have weights yeah
SPEAKER_03: And go ahead, Adam. I got you. What were you saying? The guy doesn't look like 164. No, I was going to say he looks like a true 85 kilo puller, just from the top half. Yeah. And like 2018, he was still pulling 154s. Wow. Yeah, he was still pulling 154s. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: anyway so what do you what do you think you i kind of like think feel that you are thinking that the match is gonna stop and you believe in your endurance do you expect a match like same as uh bojidar match and by the way people think that you and bojidar had like huge weight difference as far as i remember you were 92 and he was 87 right yes yeah yeah anyways go ahead what do you think about this match
SPEAKER_00: I mean, from watching film and analyzing, it's pretty obvious that he has a very, very developed forearm and a large hand. So I think it's going to be really interesting because we almost have pretty similar styles. I think Arthur's a lot tighter and he uses his brachialis a little bit more. But I do see the match stopping.
SPEAKER_00: Where it's going to stop, I'm not sure. When you have matches like mine and Bozidar's or any long hook war, it's a game of inches. It's really crucial on where that match stops and whether that's, I mean, to say something like center or this side or this side is not enough detail. Really, the exact positioning on the table, what kind of wrist position, all those things matter.
SPEAKER_00: when that match stops, it really ultimately comes down to your ability to fight out of that. And somebody has an advantage and somebody has a disadvantage. And ideally, the goal is to stop that match to where you have advantage and you have position and you're in a good spot to either bleed your opponent or win the match. So that's kind of where I'm at.
SPEAKER_00: with this right now. I do see it stopping. I don't, I mean, unless he's just, I have seen him flash pin a few guys and, you know, my speed's not the greatest, which of course I've been working on. So hopefully I can eliminate that part out.
SPEAKER_02: Give me just one second for bullet points. Yeah, yeah. He asks him, how do you see the fight? How should it go? He says, I don't know. I think we'll probably slow down, the match will stop somewhere.
SPEAKER_02: Thank you, Ace.
SPEAKER_03: and and what does he think about his opponent whenever i ask him the match and then i show him the bush that match he didn't want to accept and he said then you'll find me an opponent at my weight category and i said after all your top opponents are going wow
SPEAKER_03: Like, Daniel is going off, Aydar Khan is going off, Minda Agos is going off, you know. So we need to find someone, you know, a little bit heavier. And he said, yeah, but just a little bit heavier, not over 90 kilos. And then I said 85 kilos, and he barely accepted, you know, barely.
SPEAKER_03: and he's taking he he's not coming to lose he's coming to win but he said that like this is very serious opponent for him and this is what i know but you ask him what does he think so that maybe
SPEAKER_02: Well, in general, yes, you accepted it, because all your main opponents go to the World Cup, to the World Cup, yes. He says, well, he accepted everything, but you think that this is a serious opponent. He says, well, this is what I know. He says, and now let's listen to what Artur himself will say, how he thinks. Well, I think that the opponent is really serious, and you can't underestimate Adam, because if you look at...
SPEAKER_01: his previous fight with Bajidar, then he Bajidar did not leave any chances. Perhaps Bajidar was not in shape and I don't want to condemn anyone, but in the fight it was clear that Adam dominated and I need to tune in to the victory and to the fight. I think it will not be
SPEAKER_02: Okay, yeah, Arthur's saying that by any means I will not underestimate Adam, very serious opponent. After he saw the supermatch, the last supermatch Adam won, he said, yeah, maybe Bojidar was not in the greatest form, but it doesn't matter.
SPEAKER_02: by the amount uh by the difference with the domination Adam won it it's it was very serious and he said it's it's not he said I hope that we will stop the match somewhere in the middle of the table and it's going to be a grinder uh and uh but he says yeah it's a very very serious opponent and I have to uh be ready in mindset for a win uh to make it happen you know yeah
SPEAKER_01: The run-up will be about 10-8 kg. I knew what I was going for, I agreed to it, and I will try to lay out as much as possible.
SPEAKER_02: and he said also that yes I know that weight difference will be there maybe even eight to ten kilos but he said I I knew that and I know that and I will try to do my hundred percent uh to to do my best yeah and how does he see his chances like does he think that he is underdog or he is the favorite or it's like a 50 50 match
SPEAKER_01: How do you see your chances, maybe in percentage? Do you think it's 50-50, or do you think you're an underdog, or are you a favorite? I read in the comments, many people write that I'm an underdog. And no one puts it on me. I sometimes read in the comments in groups what they write. What can I say about the fight with Adam?
SPEAKER_01: The fact that I haven't fought for a year is, of course, a lot, but I don't think it will affect our fight with Adam. I would like to evaluate with equal strength, but in any case, the table will show and we'll see.
SPEAKER_02: he said that i've been reading some comments uh on the internet uh which i do sometimes two times he said that most of the comments uh are putting him arthur as an underdog but uh he said i don't think so and uh i will try or i wanna think that this is a very equal opportunity for us like 50 50 and uh it's gonna be a great match but we will see on the table
SPEAKER_03: yeah i see a question arthur is right now 75 165 and how do you see adam this um how do you see i i normally i have my own predictions but i i try not to share it but how do you see this match um it's hard for me to give a prediction because
SPEAKER_00: I mean, I definitely don't see it being 3-0 either way. I see some really good matches, just stylistically. We're both kind of inside pullers that have a slightly different twist to our inside games. So I see it. I don't see it being 3-0. I mean, Arthur is, he's clearly, he's smaller, and I commend him for taking that match. I mean,
SPEAKER_00: to be accepting a match of somebody eight to 10 kilos higher and, and maybe even more than that is really admirable. And right now I'm coming off of, um, some tournaments. So I, I see it being, uh, you know, our, our shapes coming in being pretty, pretty similar. And, um, I, yeah, I don't, I, I see it. It could, it could be the match of the night really. I mean, when you have two guys that are going to go inside and,
SPEAKER_00: and bang in different ways and explore some different wrist positions, it could be a really good match. And I definitely think it's one of those that are gonna come down to some endurance because when you're pulling like that inside and there's a lot of pronation involved in hand position, it blows up everything, your arm, your hand, your elbow.
SPEAKER_03: Your shoulder gets gassed, your pecs, your drivers, everything. So I just think it's going to be a really interesting match. I can't give you a prediction. All I can say is it's not going to be 3-0. Yeah, I don't know about that. Maybe 3-0. If the guy who has the best, better endurance equals the match right by round one.
SPEAKER_03: and then like yeah I mean the the other rounds will probably go easier and easier and easier if it goes that way but I don't know um can you ask uh Arthur how does he feel his endurance uh give me just one second before I ask him this uh yeah okay okay yeah you're right you're right uh
SPEAKER_02: And he says, I think we'll fight and see who has better endurance. And he says, I think it will be a very beautiful, cool match, because together we are fighting inside, in hooks. He says, yes, we have different angles in this hook, but we will probably try different angles. There is a lot of supination, pronation, and so on. He says, well, it will probably be a very cool match. He says, I can't say what will happen there, but it seems to me that 3-0 will not work in one way.
SPEAKER_01: What was the question? I'm sorry. It's Andrews.
SPEAKER_01: Arthur said that the match with Alain Zaloev showed that his endurance is not enough.
SPEAKER_03: uh and she's working on it very hard and it's important so that's that's yeah but yeah but there was two months almost like beginning of july end of august not two months but easily a little bit more than one and a half months can we say that his endurance is better than when he pulled alonzo live and if it is can he say like how much better
SPEAKER_02: Arthur, yes, well, the question, yes, he understood you, he says, well, you work on him, he says, it turns out, it improves, for example, in these one and a half months from the moment of the duel with Zoloev, it improves, it goes forward, your endurance improves or stands still? If it improves, how much? To assess, to be honest, it is very difficult, because in order to assess it, you need to fight with the guys from the hall.
SPEAKER_01: he said that it's very very hard to uh estimate that but by by the feelings because he said that endurance can be checked on a very heavy training on a table with the guys
SPEAKER_02: uh which he did not have but he said by the feelings and the training process he said probably by five seven percent over the last one and a half years yeah he said that one and a half months is a little too short period of time to really improve your endurance big difference yeah
SPEAKER_03: I understand yeah yeah and and Adam is it possible to keep your phone sideways because very nice better yeah okay yeah gotcha anyway so yeah so I think that your plan Adam Adam do you think that do you think that because of that uh the like
SPEAKER_03: after our tour like a few times get top rolled you know and then he started to more arm muscle with brachioradialis and pronator and your main style is hook um
SPEAKER_03: and he has very strong back pressure and pronated, do you see any danger going there? Do you, you may just try to go outside as well, or like, are you feeling comfortable with your abilities to force your a game? Um,
SPEAKER_00: i feel i feel pretty i feel pretty confident in my hook i feel like if i really put my mind to hooking somebody then i can do it but um i also felt that way going into boccio and i and i kind of met my maker so uh i think this guy is an exception this is what i believe i don't think i don't think he's normal i think on that day like he could do that to many many many many top guys
SPEAKER_00: mean my point is is you know i i'm prepared going into this match to maybe not be able to set my hook there may be a chance where off go i can't do that i would like to think i can um but it's not the end of the world if i can't get it there off a go there's been plenty of times where i've been in matches where i need to match pressure somewhere else in order for the match to get where i needed to be
SPEAKER_00: And I love going outside. Everybody thinks I'm just a hook arm wrestler. And I mean, I guess I could see why based on all my footage. But I really do love to top roll. It's just not something I'm great at initiating. But if the match goes out there, I'm certainly willing to bang hand to hand and fight. And, you know, that's very well much a place this match could go.
SPEAKER_00: um, with, I mean, with, with Archer's genetics, it almost looks like he, he looks like an old leg type puller to me with a really strong ability to drive backwards with the brachialis and with that big hand, obviously a deep wrist curl. So it could go there and I'm fine with it going either place. I'm confident in both of my abilities to hook and top roll. Um,
SPEAKER_00: Again, just really my biggest weakness right now is speed and, you know, a substantial amount of speed anywhere may be able to give me trouble. But I'm confident everywhere else and I'd love to explore an outside lane. That takes a little bit more pressure off my elbow. So maybe we can start that way. Yeah. So you are saying that basically you are ready for anything?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I'm ready for anything. I mean, I'm fighting a little bit of nagging elbow pain now, just with the brachialis, nothing major. And my inside feels great. My inner elbow feels as healthy as it's ever felt. My brachialis is still recovering a little bit from Arizona State. But I feel like come August 26th,
SPEAKER_03: it'll be ready to go and I'll be ready to explore it. You may consider longer rest than usual for your brachioradialis, at least for that area.
SPEAKER_00: Are you asking if I've given it longer rest? No, no, no. Are you considering to rest your brachioradialis longer than you usually do before? Yes. Typically, my last table session would be about 13 to 14 days away from a competition. For this match, I believe it's more like 19 or 20 days. Almost three weeks. My gym training is not as hard, which
SPEAKER_00: That was kind of something I had to adapt to with this match. I realized that upon taking this match that it really wasn't possible to get substantially stronger in a three-week time frame, but the focus is more to get healthy, get crisp, sharp, faster, and really just focus on the preparation part.
SPEAKER_02: you mean give me 10 seconds for bulletproof okay yeah yeah
SPEAKER_02: He also prepared his upper body and said, I sometimes fight with my upper body, I just try to climb inside, because inside I feel better and more comfortable. Then the conversation went to the side, well, how will you rest after training? And he says, listen, a little more, he says, inside everything is alive, he says, well, all the internal parts of the elbow are fine, he says, very healthy, as never before, everything is cool. And after the Arizona state, there were competitions, he participated
SPEAKER_02: thank you guys um another question for arthur um he you know after a point i took his wrist
SPEAKER_03: one time Minda was took his wrist you know like a few times he he lost his wrist it acted Zrakash really low and then after that he started to also pull outside and then we see that he is now pulling outside is he ready for a match if Adam forces him inside
SPEAKER_03: Is he training there too or he is just making plans to not go there at all? Because in the past he was very, very strong inside. But last two, three years, even more, we see him pulling outside. And if Adam forces him inside, will Arthur be ready there as well?
SPEAKER_02: Well, the question is, in the last 2-3 years, we have seen that you have stopped forcing inwardly and you are fighting a little more from the outside, although inside you have always been very, very strong. And the question was, if Adam turns you inward, are you ready? Is everything ready for such a fight? I think so.
SPEAKER_03: yeah he said yeah i think yes absolutely and i will give a good fight so everything is ready here is ready here is ready it's good it's good it's good okay yeah and and the reason that he didn't go outside for some time was it because of any issues with the elbow or was it because he also wanted to protect his wrists by attacking the opponent's wrist
SPEAKER_02: He has a question, he says, you are more afraid outside because of the fact that there were some problems with the hook, somewhere, some injuries, maybe, or you just protect your wrist so that you don't get hit? Good question. Most likely, this happens subconsciously, probably, yes, because of your injury.
SPEAKER_01: okay yeah he said probably it was you know under his uh under his uh because of the old injury on the elbow on the inside he started more and more give uh
SPEAKER_03: pronator to load and to do the work but now he said the injury is gone it's all healed up it's just maybe a little bit under skin but he said yeah i'm ready for inside game okay okay okay i am a fan of adam and i think he is as strong as bacho but it was a big surprise for everyone that bacho was so quick next time adam will win i think trip or said this thank you for your super chat report and
SPEAKER_03: Arthur, you and I, especially the last time we met, we had very good matches, very good matches. And what do you think about our last meet in Yalova here? And do you think that someday we will meet again or not?
SPEAKER_02: Just ask him what does he think about our last meet, you know. He says, well, we had a couple of really cool matches with you. He asks, what do you think about our last match? And he says, well, maybe in the future we'll meet again and fight. Why not, Engin? I'm ready. I'll be ready.
SPEAKER_01: there will be such an opportunity, why not. As for our fight, the last one, the last fight, probably still Engin dominated more than I did, because the first two fights Engin won me and quite confidently. The only thing that Engin had was a trauma.
SPEAKER_01: It can be a trauma, it can be endurance. Engin himself knows that in the third fight I managed to hook Engin and then Engin could not fight anymore. Anyway, at that moment Engin dominated.
SPEAKER_02: uh he said yeah the last the last one you was uh dominant for sure you dominantly won first two and then uh whatever happens the injury happens uh probably prevent you uh from uh you know further think maybe endurance was uh was a thing too on the third one but he said for sure he was dominant at that day and that that this was a domination but for the future I don't understand what was the third one second one I don't understand last part
SPEAKER_02: and he he said that uh your injury your injury third one let him uh you know catch you and then it was playing an endurance game and your injury and everything else together so you cannot continue after after all of that but he said in the future if there will be a possibility he would love to pull you again
SPEAKER_03: Yeah. Yeah. Ask him, does he feel himself against me? 1-0 or 2-0 he feels like right now. He thinks that he is in a super match. He feels himself 1-0 or 2-0 against me.
SPEAKER_03: i don't understand uh like that's because we had a previous super match as well does he feel that he beat me two times or only one time okay like one zero or two zero he feels yes
SPEAKER_01: I don't know, it's hard to say. I don't know what the form of Engin is now, but in any case, you need to prepare well for Engin, I know that. It's hard to say.
SPEAKER_02: I will definitely try. He said, I don't know, I don't know, Engin is very serious. And he said, anyway, I don't know his form, his current form, but he said, anyway, I need a lot of time and very serious preparation for Engin. Yeah, but no need, tell him no need, I'm only 48 years old, man, tell him, please. He says, no, I don't need such serious preparation, I'm already old and that's it.
SPEAKER_03: he thinks that you are you know just shy guy hi guy you know maybe just pretending that way no just pretending that way anyway so arthur um adam before before i come to you i will ask him another question this match is uh
SPEAKER_03: Artur, 85 kilo, 85 kilo. This is 85 kilo match, so it doesn't really, it's not really his category and it will not affect any of his future matches for 75 kilo. Like even he wins, loses or something, it doesn't take, if he loses, it doesn't take anything from him for 75 kilo category. You see,
SPEAKER_02: Is he ready to pull Aydar Khan for the title in November for the world title of 75 kg? He says that this match is not quite the weight category that was supposed to take place, because there is a difference. And regardless of the outcome of this match, your rating of the 75 kg category will not change.
SPEAKER_02: and asks if you are ready to fight for the title in November. Engin, who was that guy? I'm sorry. The 75 kilo East vs. West world champion, the guy who beat Mindaugas 3-0, Aydar Khan. Aydar Khan. Nurdalet Aydar Khan. Nurdalet Aydar Khan.
SPEAKER_01: which Mendoza won 3-0. Will you be ready for it in November? Do you think you will win the title? Yes, why not? I would like to fight with him. I have never fought with him, not at the European and World Championships. We had different weight categories with him, but I really want to fight with him.
SPEAKER_02: uh and him I definitely love Arthur before he start explaining why and what he said yes and then he said yeah I never pulled him before but I very much want to pull him and try and I will be ready yes he said that will be very interesting and and and another question for Adam Adam who would you want to pull
SPEAKER_00: the east versus west in the future like just think about like someone like daniel prokopchik well um it's interesting because traditionally i was pulling 95 90 95 kilo matches but this is the first time i'm making 85 and uh if if making the if if i can make the weight with relative ease
SPEAKER_00: And it's something I can continue to do in the future. Then that changes a lot of things. If, uh, yeah, I would, I would really like to go for some bigger 85 kilo matches if the weight cut goes well. And it's something I can do in the future. Absolutely. I know Samusha has been sitting on that 85 kilo throne for a while and hardly anybody can knock him off.
SPEAKER_00: Could be me, might not be me. It depends how this weight cut goes and how I feel doing it. Yeah. But right now the focus is on August 26th. I'm not looking past that. Yeah, you're right. So let's talk about some of the matches that will happen here. Do you know Kyle Hutchinson? No, I actually know nothing on him.
SPEAKER_03: okay so it's hard to compare him with uh brett grounding and do you know yeah these guys uh paulo uh grandi yes i know hutchinson no i don't so it is and arthur doesn't really even follow the the international arm wrestling so i will only ask him the most popular matches and then let's ask another team
SPEAKER_03: um since you are from ukraine paulo and you are not really that young you know so you would you should have remembered but maybe you started arm wrestling late do you remember rustam when he was competing uh i do you do okay absolutely and what do you think about him versus paul uh have you seen his match with john burzing inside hook yes i saw a lot of his matches uh
SPEAKER_02: i think if it's a little bit tough i think uh if he will be able to bring the form he brought to world championship in 2010 uh then pauline will win he will need to be better than that
SPEAKER_02: but i'm not sure what his current form because i did not see him on the serious serious table uh for i don't know for seven years probably
SPEAKER_02: yeah i think no no 10 years i think 10 years maybe yeah yeah it's been a long time so i'm not sure uh what's his uh abilities right now but if he will be at the level uh he was in 2010 at waff yeah yeah this is here against john brzing yeah yeah and he was only 189 here yeah and this is john brzing in prime prime times yeah
SPEAKER_03: like endo prime i can say yeah yeah yeah at this form it's going to be a very interesting match at this form but this is not day of what 2012. i think this i don't know which year was it was it was not that easy you know 2010 name it says was
SPEAKER_03: um yeah i mean the guy the guy is uh strong yeah the guy is very strong he's he always been in uh top three in the worlds and stuff like that he's he's very good but uh but from other side pauline is real deal yeah and i saw him stop rustam i was like what okay yeah yeah yeah the thing is that people don't know about ruslan
SPEAKER_03: people already knows about uh Paul but they don't know about Ruslan so that's why I tried to many people because the names are like similar Ruslan Ruslan so many people even tells me you're writing his name wrong you understand it's like Ruslan you know it's like his brother Ruslan so they don't know the guy he was not as good as his brother but maybe like a little bit
SPEAKER_02: below you know I would say that not not far I I remember at valve I've been very closely watched uh rustan was first then uh Steve Raul was second and Ruslan was top so there you know there is a very small gap in between the two brothers I mean maybe not that small but uh it's it's not that big so it's it's a it's definitely not a mismatch if he will be prepared for this
SPEAKER_03: I understand, I understand. I'm not going to ask you, Adam. You don't know Ruslan, probably. You know, Paulo, but yeah. And probably you guys don't know Thomas Mange. No. That is very hard. Just maybe after this time, you guys will have some, maybe we go from the more famous ones, you know, like Irakli versus Adam, Irakli versus David Dadikian with right arm. Any opinion about their match?
SPEAKER_03: You know how heavy David is? They both will be 105 kilos, 231. That's a good one. Usually, David Dadikian, whenever he do those practice pulls, not at the East versus West, but at Dubai, after he pulled Morozov, I think he was about 255 or something, you know. But here, 231 limits. I'm going to give the slight edge to David.
SPEAKER_00: yeah i i think it's a close match but uh 55 45 60 40 dv more well more well-rounded yeah yeah yeah yeah just just a little bit not much how much and can you ask can you ask paulo to arthur does he follow
SPEAKER_03: professional armwrestling east versus west matches and also just say king of the table matches does he follow these uh professional matches or not and does he know about he knows directly but does he know that again
SPEAKER_01: David Dodikian and Irakli will have a match on the right hand. What do you think? Who? What? I don't know the form of neither Dodikian nor Irakli. On 105 kilograms, I'm sorry. If we take into account the last fight, I watched Irakli fighting John. He showed a very good fight and even managed to win.
SPEAKER_01: despite the fact that David is also gaining, of course, he and I are not familiar with him as with Irakli, but it can be seen that a person is preparing, I think it will be 50 to 50, but in any case, one is fighting in the hook, the other is fighting with the top,
SPEAKER_02: uh he said yeah he's following and he's he's he's watching the videos of both and after uh european super match with john he said that now he would say it's exactly 50 50 and because of the completely different styles
SPEAKER_02: of the arm wrestling arm wrestlers uh he thinks that it's not going to be about power it's going to be about uh who will uh force his style in the match I don't know
SPEAKER_03: Two favorites. Two favorites. Very interesting match. Yeah, and in the left arm, Evgeny Prudnik versus Dadykan, Adam. Evgeny Prudnik and Dadykan will be on the left. That's a hard one to predict. I don't know. When's the last time Evgeny's pulled left-handed?
SPEAKER_03: Um, he pulled against, uh, Tobias, but he lost, but Tobias was super, super heavyweight guy. Yeah. Yeah. He top rolled, top rolled him. He top rolled, uh, uh, Brudnich. I, I think I have to give the slight advantage to, advantage to David there too. Same, same as with Irakli, not by much.
SPEAKER_01: just from just from the little bit of knowledge i have of both of them um
SPEAKER_01: I would give them a preference, because it seems to me that this is generally an ideal selection with rivals, which, it seems to me, is worth looking at. I think that it all depends on who has more endurance. I don't think it will be a fight in one movement. The one who is more resilient will definitely win, and not both hookers.
SPEAKER_02: yeah he said that uh yeah he said that uh engine this is was the best matchup those two uh that you can interact in the decan and prudnik unpredictable matches uh and uh those will be the best matches for sure uh he said that again this one with uh prudnik and the decan it's not going to be one move arm wrestling it's going to be an endurance and grinder but we can improve liquid left arm
SPEAKER_03: 50-50. Yes. And what are your opinions about these two matches, Pablo?
SPEAKER_02: my opinion okay uh i would probably give a slight edge to daddy cam and both of them but very slight it's uh it's it's not not like even 64 it's you know a little bit because of his speed so i think because of his speed he will force uh his position and then if position is forced and the decan is comfortable it's over
SPEAKER_03: but i'm not underestimating neither iraqi or prudnik they're they're super close matches i mean they have potential to change the things you know yes this much edge to the detail so 52 48 53 47 yeah very close yes did you say your opinion adam about prudnik david left arm
SPEAKER_03: Yes. Yeah, I was the same as Pablo, just a little bit more to David. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You said the same thing for Iraqi match as well? Yes. Yes, little flight edge to David. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Three words. Pablo, what changed after first round in Sunday's match?
SPEAKER_02: uh sundry's figured out his way uh he is a very well-rounded arm wrestler uh he can pull anywhere and he feels he feels the weaknesses of his opponent uh and that's what changed he figured out how and when he stopped me it was he he felt my you know uh weaker parts and that's that's what's over
SPEAKER_02: or he felt your strong part and then he tried something else and he found it by guessing because if he could find it right away it would be round one but round one was plus my mistakes absolutely i i'm not i'm not saying that you know i was perfect because i did uh pretty amateur mistakes where which is unacceptable but uh listen uh with this opponent it's hard not to make a mistake when you're forced to make him
SPEAKER_01: Okay, so let's go to another match. Tatachins vs. Ibrahim Sagov. Artur. Tatachins vs. Ibrahim Sagov. Tatachins vs. Ibrahim Sagov. Tatachins vs. Ibrahim Sagov.
SPEAKER_01: And he performed very well, I would say, phenomenal. He moved on to another weight category and won it quite confidently. I will probably give preference to Sagov.
SPEAKER_02: he said that he will cheer and he thinks that sagov will win because he saw him at amc he did a phenomenal job in a category which he step up one category up and he said he was very very ready plus his uh age giving him a little advantage and he said the slight age for ibrahim and what do you what do you think paulo
SPEAKER_00: i never bet against hutchins so i think he will do his job again you think yeah you think he will find a way and then win i think so i think so and adam do you know who ibrahim sako is i don't but uh like pablo said i i just can't bet against todd hutchins i think there's a very specific way you need to pull to beat todd
SPEAKER_00: And I don't know if this guy, I don't know if this guy has it or not. I mean, can this guy top roll Todd out of the straps? If he can, then maybe he has a shot, but. The guy is just right now, probably the follow chemistry that he is just one of the best shoulder pressure guy.
SPEAKER_03: Probably. He is probably. The guy is just very strong. He's attacking on the bicep touchings. I think it totally depends where the match is going to stop. If he catches Todd here somewhere on his bicep, maybe. But if somehow he hits and Todd just gets the position at the middle, then I don't know if Todd is going to give it up after that point.
SPEAKER_02: just for the reference why i think so uh back in the days todd was pulling uh jerry yeah and jerry is a very good flop presser yeah and that's very similar to a press uh technique wise not to prevent them to go to the position and todd was waiting 90 kilos against 150 kilos jerry
SPEAKER_02: and he i don't think it was 90 kilo i think he was very heavy i think i don't think he was 90 something kilo because i pulled uh todd hutchings left next year on the same event and wl event he was uh at 88 kilo 195 pounds so yeah yeah but this was super a weight machine it was like a super heavy weight yes but he was he was not heavy he was not heavy he was 90 plus kilos
SPEAKER_03: And he was very successful. So that's why I think he feels very comfortable with anybody going inside, which is... No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Whenever Jerry applied, he just pressed Todd like nothing. I think Todd gave him trouble with top roll. Yes. As far as I remember. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. But if he top roll, you think that he's going to top roll Ibrahim Sagok? That's how he's going to survive? Or he's going to hold him with his bicep?
SPEAKER_03: he he he will stop it uh closer to the center with the top roll and then his side position okay okay okay yeah okay because i thought that maybe you you remember like his sub jerry's shoulder pressure on like like by blocking on his arm because this guy is not a flop wrist pressure that is just the guy i understand but it's you know the the weight out of it is similar
SPEAKER_03: yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i mean it's kind of a little bit easier to top roll jerry because he gives you anyways you know he just he just likes to give it the risk pull the center out so to prevent you know to stick the shoulder in that's the whole idea was uh yeah ah but let's go to another match um there are many matches but just like many of you i mean some of you don't know the guys but um
SPEAKER_00: Laletin versus Rivas match. Adam, you are familiar with both guys, right? Yeah. Yes. You said Laletin and Rivas, right? Yeah. Yeah. Two towers. You know, I can only think back to the match
SPEAKER_00: help but think back to the dave and rivas match and i i really thought dave chafee was going to handle rivas and when when it was the quite the opposite i was shocked um i'm going to give that edge to rivas i i'm going with rivas i think i think he will win i think he's on an uphill i think he's been rising and um his level and i
SPEAKER_02: i'm gonna give that one to rivas i think he'll win that top game so you think that was his favorite and you pablo uh i would say the same way i know vitality has uh
SPEAKER_02: better top roll abilities but uh it's only when we see him with uh shorter guys with uh two towers you know it's gonna be a little bit different for Vitalian with the size of the hand and the length of the fingers but rivals definitely have more power overall power and uh I believe that that will make a difference it's it's very close very interesting match to see but I will give a little edge to rivals
SPEAKER_03: understand and can you also ask arthur i know this is his country countryman and and i don't know if it's so easy to be objective but what does he think but
SPEAKER_01: I don't know what form the Georgians are in now, but in any case, if Rivas brings a good form to Turkey, I think there will be a good fight. I also saw how Vitalik participated in the AMC. I think he had a better form before.
SPEAKER_02: But in any case, I am sure that he will prepare and bring good form. I think 50-50, too. But I would give a little preference to Kvaletin. Yes, he said it's a very, very close match. And he hoped that Georgian will bring a good form. He saw Vitaly at the AMC. And he said that he will give a little slight edge to Vitaly. He will give? Yeah. Okay.
SPEAKER_03: And let's go to the world title match of the night. No, before that one, another world title match is 85 kilo. David Samusha and Vala Ichkiti. I want to ask this to Arthur because Arthur was in the AMC event.
SPEAKER_03: when while i took second place uh in the 85 kilo can you ask him what they're sitting about david samushia did he know that david samushia and zhura were like
SPEAKER_03: two days no sleep because they had to travel and they were made to wait at the russian border and then finally when they arrived they just directly competed the events just first please ask him if he knew if he knows that they were both like you know exhausted and if he considers this way in what does he think about wala and generally about david
SPEAKER_02: The question is, it reminds me of the AMC video of the athletes, and you know that David and his wife spent almost two days on the Russian border, but they didn't sleep. They were so tired, and he says, please don't forget to take this into account. But what do you think, Valya and David, who, who, who and how?
SPEAKER_01: I understand that David has been on the border for two days. This is very exhausting and breaks the rhythm and mood a little. In any case, it has affected.
SPEAKER_01: But I saw Ichikiti's fight. He gave a very good fight to Sarmat Degurov. As far as I know, Sarmat Degurov dominates very strongly in the last two tournaments. He grew up very well. And he even made good competition for him. I would still give a preference, probably, for Valik Ichikiti. I think he will be able to twist him.
SPEAKER_02: okay uh yeah he said that uh yeah i know that uh the border thing is uh very very uh tiring uh but still even considering that uh he saw uh valer pulling sarmat and give him a very good match and he said that probably he will be able to uh open up the read and uh win
SPEAKER_03: OK, so he's saying that while I is the favorite one. Yes, OK, so let's let's go to Adam and then ask about the match organized. They will let us versus. Hermes Gasparini Adam just not like short prediction, but just tell us everything you think about that much. And that's it. There's a lot of there's a lot to think about there.
SPEAKER_00: Hermes has, has now proven that he is at this current shape. One of the, I mean, the top, I can only say the number two guy in the world, um, Devin, you know, it's kind of interesting where he is right now. And it's, and it's a hard match to predict because both guys do a lot of changing, you know, they, they,
SPEAKER_00: I mean, more so Devin because sometimes he jumps down to that lighter category and then he jumps up and beefs up for these heavyweight matches. It's... Devin Larratt knows how to explain every angle of the table. Hermes is just looking extremely powerful. Hold on one second, fellas. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I'm in a meeting. Oh, yeah. Sorry. Yeah. Sorry about that. But yes, Hermes is just looking. Hermes is looking really powerful. And honestly, I don't I don't know if I don't know if Devin's going to be able to stop him because. Obviously, Hermes, his top role is immaculate and he's shown the ability to pull with his wrist back. So. I know I've said before that Devin Laird doesn't really know how to lose.
SPEAKER_00: But with Ernie's ability to fight him outside and, you know, wherever that, if that match stops, wherever that may be, I don't think it matters because I think Ernie has the horsepower and the tools to finish the match. It's going to take really a lot of heart and a ton of grind out of Devin to
SPEAKER_00: be able to gas armies out because really that's the only thing that Devin has over armies right now is endurance and I'm just worried that he may not be able to even use it that's just my that's just my initial thoughts which one do you think has a like more like solid risks right now I armies I have to say armies yeah
SPEAKER_00: yeah i mean initially i want to say devin just from his reputation and just just devin being devin his wrist has always been really solid but so do you see when they bought log back do you see david's risk going back yes you see that i do
SPEAKER_03: don't think devin is because he didn't really go back way too much even against le one but hermes is just right away he just went back when he pulled against um yeah but a lot of that has to do with uh i think the size of the hand and the wrist just sizing i think with them you are saying that le one has hand was so much bigger and then hermes couldn't have the grip
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, and plus you have to take into consideration, maybe Devin's wrist didn't go back as far, but Devin just got pinned. Ermias, yeah, his wrist got cracked back a little bit, but you can make an argument that he didn't really fight it so much in an effort not to get pinned. You understand? A question, simple question. If somehow Devin brings Ermias to the point that Devin brought...
SPEAKER_03: I'm not saying it will happen. Do you think that Devon will gas out as Levon did on round five? Devon will never gas out. So, okay, okay, okay. I understand. So you are saying that Devon somehow needs to balance the match with his power, and once he balances...
SPEAKER_00: His chances are bigger, or you also said that it doesn't matter for Hermes. Hermes will still beat him like this. That's what I'm saying. I mean, after seeing Devin lose to Gennady in that fashion, that's what I'm worried about for Devin. Once that match, let's say that the match stops. If the match stops, it's probably going to be somewhere in that outside move. Both guys are going to be fighting for wrist position. I see the match stopping on Ermi's side of the table.
SPEAKER_00: Um, I mean, if armies can jump on top of that and, and pin Devin, which armies has proved he's, he's able to use that move. That's what I fear for Devin. Even if that match stops out there, armies has the tools and the horsepower to lay it down and, and pin Devin there. So I don't know, like I said, it's going to take a lot of grind out of Devin and to, to be able to access his endurance. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: and and Paulo how do you see this match it's a cool match very interesting I uh I'm in love with uh Hermes he is a great guy he is our future for sure in our present uh his strength is enormous but there is a part Devon is Devon no
SPEAKER_02: more than the power of Hermes and uh most likely he will be able to stop the match and because Devon's wrist will not go back if it will it will be a slip strap uh restart which is not favoring uh Hermes at this point because of the endurance and uh unfortunately or fortunately I would give an edge to uh
SPEAKER_02: devon and priority was a pretty big gap i would say five percent or even ten percent like 60 40 or 45 55 for devon yes uh it's uh most likely not gonna be a three zero match
SPEAKER_02: The only thing, if Devon will start be silly again, like he did with Gennady and playful, he may overplay it and lose somehow. But if he will take every second of the match serious, then his chances is pretty good.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, yeah, yeah, but I don't think that, like, Hermes has good endurance, but not at the Gennady level endurance. I don't think there is anybody around that which, I mean, and somebody said, Eric said that, I think this one is a mismatch, the size difference is too much, think about Bojidar, he got cracked. Eric,
SPEAKER_03: um we can say that adam guessed out bojidar yes but i don't think that adam crushed bojidar i think i think at the beginning of the match them you think that did you feel yourself like dominantly stronger against bojidar or you feel like you guessed him out adam
SPEAKER_00: um when the match stopped i i felt i felt comfortable did you feel like you could beat him anytime you want or you needed to tire him it took a little bit of uh working on my end i couldn't just i couldn't just fly through him and pin him i i definitely had to work the position a little bit so i think it's a little bit of both i think uh
SPEAKER_00: you know i would i don't know if it was just truly endurance because bozdar probably could have kept pulling there for a long time longer than even than our match but i i think once i just worked certain positions i was able to overwhelm him can you ask arthur about the devon versus ermes casparini match arthur your opinion about divan and ermes judging by the last time
SPEAKER_01: I fought in the armfight, I think he will be in any case still dominate over Allarat, but in any case I really want I would really like to see exactly the kind of fight that loves a long-term struggle that can
SPEAKER_01: Hermes, in general. To impose? Yes, to impose his fight. I really hope that Larratt will succeed. I understand that Hermes will be a favorite. I assume that he will be a favorite, but in any case, I really want to see a very good fight from Larratt. I really hope that
SPEAKER_02: but he hoped that larat will stop the match and uh will you know will force his uh his style and that we will see a longer match and the grinder between what actually everybody wants to see
SPEAKER_03: Okay, I understand, I understand. Adam, if you are late, you can just go. I think they are asking you to go work. No, they're just asking me to close up when I leave, that's all. Okay, okay, okay. Just because I want to ask you another last question, but I don't want to keep you because this is not about that. Arthur, I am planning to compete against the winner of
SPEAKER_03: Valya and David Samusha on November. Do you think that I am doing this too early for me? Or maybe I should never try that? I should go down to 75 kilos? He says, Arthur, he doesn't ask, he says, you know, I'm going to fight the winner between David and Valya.
SPEAKER_02: Do you think it's too early or shouldn't you even try to return to the 75th category? Well, 75 kg is heavier for Samusha. Well, that's what he's asking. He says that he plans to fight with the winner. Exactly at 75 kg? No, no.
SPEAKER_02: I think nothing is impossible. Knowing Engin, I think he will give a good fight in any case.
SPEAKER_02: and he said that there is nothing impossible that's first of all second of all uh he said knowing you you will give a great match anyway and he said why not yes okay okay so go ahead and it's it's going to be very interesting he said yeah so he doesn't seem like if i am pulling
SPEAKER_03: he doesn't say that like no chance at all or something right yeah no no he said that knowing q it's going to be a grinder for sure okay okay after i'm done with 85 i'm coming down for 75. anyways guys
SPEAKER_03: say something okay okay yeah anyways thank you very much adam and thank you arthur thank you right yeah okay and thank you very much paulo and paulo hope to see you again here just work on the details you were super powerful but a little bit i think i'm sure that you are still learning to improve every event
SPEAKER_03: As we all do. I do. As we all do, yeah. Anyway, so, okay, guys, thank you very much. And thanks to everyone who has been watching us. And very soon, probably how many days was this? Less than two weeks. I see you guys. Okay. Take care. Yes, sir. Thanks, Angus. Thanks, y'all. Good luck to you. Bye.
