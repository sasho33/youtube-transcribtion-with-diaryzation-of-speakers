Speaker: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: Tired.
SPEAKER_02: tired guys um
SPEAKER_02: So how is everything? Just train today. I'm not tired. It's very hot lately. No, Ermes is gonna be my guest tomorrow, hopefully.
SPEAKER_02: And today, I think it's gonna happen end of this year.
SPEAKER_02: arm wrestling edit you can you cannot use the footage my friends only a month after around from each super match you can use it yeah and so let's see
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it's not about turning the phone. I think I forgot that, but when Devon comes, I think we will be side by side, I think. Um,
SPEAKER_02: I'm very tired. I'm very tired. Just normally East versus West is very exhausting to organize. And now I'm organizing two of them four weeks apart. And it's very hot and kind of very tough.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, after this event, I need a good rest. And hopefully next will be in November. And then maybe I can get some rest. Maybe I can focus on training as well. And why did I decide? This is because I said Devon versus Dennis. And then Devon said that he's going to pull Dennis only after he beats Gennady rematch. And I said the rematch. So...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah. I think production is very, very good. Yeah. Oh yeah. Balcony is good idea, but it's too late right now. Yeah. Yeah. I eat ice cream time to time. Yeah. Um, who's gonna join focus on it? Um, Devon and I.
SPEAKER_02: I'm not planning to have anyone else. Most like it is like the auditorium, my friend is about like, you can put there 2000 people. And the competition starts about 8pm and ends after midnight. And another thing is that
SPEAKER_02: This is a pay-per-view event. Devon't think that there is nobody there just because there are empty places, because it's so big place. Every event, there are easily 200, 300 people. But to make it like 2,000 people there, you really need to control all the...
SPEAKER_02: cell phones, you know, all the cell phones, because even with 200-300 people, people start, this is a pay-per-view event. Or you can say UFC allows and this and this, my friend, we are not that, UFC is a like big tree, you know, we are just a plant. So it's just different. I think the event,
SPEAKER_02: deserves to be, like, how to say, appreciated, you know. And that never changes, you know. You organize an event and they look at the event. If this guy is there, they're asking other guy. If that other guy is there, I never heard that, you know, like, whatever, it's okay.
SPEAKER_02: It's not about this. People are even listening that live streaming. Yeah, they will just send the messages as soon as joining them is 11 supposed to join whenever I announced which is 1pm Eastern Time. Yeah, there is there is VIP VIP offers. The VIP offer is
SPEAKER_02: we provide three nice five-star hotel at the hotel that athletes also stay in the event is happening. And also they have the VIP seats and with soft drink and snacks. Also exclusive dinner with all the athletes together. And then we give them as a gift, you know, one deck of trading cards.
SPEAKER_02: one Ermes Devon poster, one the event poster, and one event t-shirt. All these are signed. Each athlete signs the event t-shirt and event posters. And then the trading cards are signed by the athletes. Everyone signs their own. And so other than that, the Devon Ermes poster will be signed by them only.
SPEAKER_02: And yesterday, John confirmed that John is going to come as a, uh, as a, uh, guest, he will be doing the commentating and I will also prepare, uh, prime John trading cards and yeah. And the VIP offer is limited. It's going to be limited to, uh,
SPEAKER_02: certain number I'm not gonna do because it's hard to Yeah. Yes. I think it will be a good event. I think that Travis will be at the corner of the Americans that would like to I asked Pauline he said yeah, I would love to have Travis at my corner when I'm pulling
SPEAKER_02: Yeah. Yeah, John and John and Neil Pickup will be doing the commentating for the Devon Ermes match, most likely. Yeah. Is there a list for all the East vs West 9 trading cards?
SPEAKER_02: No, no, my friend. Only the athletes who are participating. There are 25 athletes because Dadikyan is pulling two super matches. So there should be 13 super matches times two is 26. But one guy is pulling two matches, so it's 25. And then plus John Prime, and then it's 26. Aleykum salam, Alkurtan karde≈ü. Bizden de Mersin'e selamlar.
SPEAKER_02: Yes, Volker. Proven astrology. Is Jordan eligible for this? I would love to see more action at the East 15K. Thanks, Volker. Thank you very much, my friend. Thank you. When will Devon come? As I said, Devon will come, should come at 1 PM. So he has three minutes. And if he comes a few minutes late, it's not a big deal.
SPEAKER_02: Thank you, Mark. Thank you. Thank you, my friends. Will you want either Levan or Denis again? I'm just thinking, like, I will only share the things that, like, I finalize, you know. Whenever I finalize something, I will share it. At the entrance. Ermi...
SPEAKER_02: I mean, I don't think anything about Ermes versus Devon at the 115 kg because the match is now set for the super heavyweight. So, like, I think that, like, one of the things that, like, we need to focus, we need to focus on what is ahead of us, you know. Like, I understand that just, I think we want just something new, other, like, instead of,
SPEAKER_02: like enjoying what is front of us you know like they're like in my opinion the best card ever you know and then we don't talk about that we talk about where is this guy where is that guy like what's about this like how about talking about this you know like are we like the event didn't happen you know um yeah
SPEAKER_02: I don't know. I'm trying to serve the community. Yeah. Anyone who are here to enjoy, you know, they are more than welcome. And anyone who are looking for provocation, you know, my behavior, you know, so just don't be surprised. I don't understand.
SPEAKER_02: Do you have email, Engin? Want to contact you? Yeah, I mean, they just shared, you know. They just shared. Yeah, Dennis is ready to pull Devon very soon, you know. Dennis is ready. And I think it's going to be happening in...
SPEAKER_02: I mean, a little bit drama is okay, but once you put the drama ahead of the actual, you know, competition, then what do you mean? Like explain who are the pulling the lightweight category? What do you mean? Like in this event, you're talking about Dustin Hyatt versus Thomas Mungy. Thomas Mungy is like very high quality, like Ermes Gasparini, top roller, very, very high level top roller.
SPEAKER_02: And Dustin Hyatt is the exact opposite way. Very high quality hook puller. So we will see. We will see hook versus top roll at its best. And I think they both are getting ready. And I love what's happening. The truth is, this is what we deserve. What we deserve is...
SPEAKER_02: to okay. Sorry, Devon. Sorry. I just didn't see you. He came. Devon, can you do the other way? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Do you have a computer in front of you? No. Okay. Just stay somewhere and I will tell you.
SPEAKER_02: Watch, tell me to rotate the device. Let me try again. I'm going to jump off and jump right back on. Yeah, this one. Stay like this. Like this? Yeah. I mean, just let's see. Let's see. Yeah, yeah. Like this, yeah. Stay like this, yeah. Is it okay? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's fine, yeah. Now they see us together, you know, side by side, you know. Yeah. All right. How's it going, buddy? Good to see you.
SPEAKER_02: Good to see you. I kind of feel, guys, as long as, like, normally, whenever I do the live, you know that I try to answer all the questions, all the comments. But whenever I have the guests, I try to only answer the Super Chats because I would like to have a discussion. So what I understand, Devon, you went to, you said, you're talking about roots, right? You made a...
SPEAKER_02: um uh video right roots about yeah it means that this is where where you are right now is where you grew up correct yeah that's right yeah so yeah i've been here for about two and a half weeks now yeah two and a half weeks yeah before i forget just sorry about it yeah it's really it's really healthy for me this is uh it it's a really healthy thing that i'm doing coming back home
SPEAKER_02: spending time with my mom it's just a good thing to do yeah this is where i'm gonna go after i read this super chat you want causes the card is amazing beyond imagination you are doing amazing job ermis versus devon is a match designed by fate devon is being called by his hammer i don't know oh okay by his hand thank you for your super chat it means that this is only only beginning you know right before getting the hammer back you know oh okay wow
SPEAKER_02: yeah we'll see that's still quite a step yeah yeah yeah but you know um so this is what i was gonna say like lately i see that you are now connected to your roots strongly again by going to the town that you grew up and i kind of see that mentally
SPEAKER_02: I think, or spiritually also, it helps you to a little bit, how to say, get the dust out of yourself because the world is just like so, you know, messy. And then once you go to where you grew up and then with your mom and the people that you grew up around, then I kind of see you healthier. I don't know. How would you describe? You tell us.
SPEAKER_01: yeah it's interesting you know i knew this was coming for quite a while my mom had this surgery planned and you know life gets so busy and i i don't get to spend a lot of time here in my home i don't get to spend a lot of time uh you know where i grew up or with my mom certainly not alone and uh and so i knew this was coming and i i planned to
SPEAKER_01: I was gonna do a social media fast basically for the whole time, put my phone away the entire time and the world is so crazy and it's so busy. It's almost impossible to do that, but I've done a very good job. Yeah, yeah. You are like limited, very limited. Very limited, yeah. I've been way more limited. I've gone on for periods of time in the day, but for the most part, my phone is away. I've cleaned up a lot of the things, a lot of my bad habits.
SPEAKER_01: cleaned them up um i i've led a very simple life the last little while it's been very good for me i've been focusing on myself um i've been focusing on uh you know it's it's a strange thing to talk about sometimes but i've been going back to who i was as a child and trying to
SPEAKER_02: make sure that I'm okay with everything the way I am today. Yeah. Trying to, you know, I'm just trying to be a good person down here. So it's been really healthy. Yeah. Very happy down here. This is the reason probably. This is the reason that Ermes has been wondering why this guy doesn't talk so much trash. It is not about specifically for this match, but it is mostly about right now you, your spiritually, you know, your mental, you know,
SPEAKER_01: wow yeah i'm i'm super healthy right i'm health healthier right now than i have been a long time um spiritually psychologically i feel like i'm healing down here yeah physically and it's all coming out physically my numbers on my weights i'm getting strong down here very quickly well listen ermys is so strong okay i still have a while before i get the army strength but for me
SPEAKER_01: For me, I am strong right now. I'm stronger than I have been in quite some time. But I'll tell you, the whole trash talk thing, people think I'm a big trash talker. And yes, of course I am. But if you go back, I never started. I'm not one to back away from trash talk, but I almost never started. If you can pick any person, there's an incident that they start something and then I just go off.
SPEAKER_01: But do you have to look for opportunity? Oh, listen, if somebody wants to play that game, I love to fight. I love to talk trash. I love to pick a person apart. And I imagine we'll probably get there. But right now, look at Ermes. I'm really, really so happy with what Ermes did. Ermes is the number one interim champion. He is the guy.
SPEAKER_01: he did not have to take this match um to me it speaks very well of his character that he did i i think it's awesome that he took the match he didn't have to he could have he could have said oh it's not enough time devin doesn't deserve it um i i want you know time to properly promote the match but
SPEAKER_01: Fate gave us an opportunity. There was an opportunity and Ermi seized it. And for that, I'm really grateful. So I don't feel the need to talk trash to him because he was a good guy. He's a good dude. I'm sure we'll find something to fight about. But all these other people that I talk trash to and about, they've done something to me. Like they've said something to me. The only one that probably didn't, the only one was probably Gennady. And I just wanted to have fun with Gennady.
SPEAKER_02: Everybody else started it. Uh, like, like for example, what happened like some years ago with Dave Chaffee, can that be a reason that, you know, in Istanbul, you say you call him that he is the, you know, right. So Dave Chaffee totally started our beef. Oh yeah. But it was, it was finished. And then now you started, I don't forget once, once you, once you cross me, I'll never forget it. Okay.
SPEAKER_02: whitehead go and get him devon some pancakes still need it and he's a question i feel really healthy i feel very healthy i think that everything's going to come together really well three weeks from today and my lifts are good yeah i really i did it that's interesting yeah they're they're healthy i don't think that you believe in what you are saying when you say like
SPEAKER_02: Ermes is strange you know this level and it's like oh long time to go there I really don't believe any of the things that you're saying like you know even even you like you said that when Dave Chaffee like took Ermes to do near to the pad and then like I remember the conversation with him and then you you thought that you know it gives you some idea and now I kind of think that you are at your strongest ever with the
SPEAKER_02: much experience at the same time and then i watch live what happened in dubai i watch it and only because of this i'm planning to get visa go to us and see the guy you know stem cell guy because yeah this will change your life yeah because of your life what i saw there was something that i thought that will never happen you to go like this you to go like this you to go like this this is
SPEAKER_01: This is the thing that I'm most proud of. And people, the fifth round with Dave Chastity, never, I have never, not one time in my entire arm wrestling career, opened a match with a flop wrist press. Never. I've never done it. You mean like start the match directly that way?
SPEAKER_01: I've never done it. I've tried to do a move, lost my wrist and turned into a flop, but I've never set up to flop somebody. And I think I did. This gives us some idea that you are not the same guy. The way that you did it. I've never had that capability.
SPEAKER_01: I sometimes talk about, oh, I've got all my old capabilities back. I can pull the way I used to. I can do all my moves that I used to. I can do moves now that I could never do. I've never been able. Yeah. So now you are more here and now at least as good as your youth years here.
SPEAKER_02: I mean, probably more. Come to the dark side, Engin. Come to the dark side. I will, I will. Like, what I'm just saying, like, I honestly believe that you are physically also stronger than 10 years ago. Like, before your injury. Yeah, I feel a little bit. Because your pronator, everything just so much developed, you know. So, what I saw that it just, I think Ermes needs to be very concerned. And Ermes told me that there is a possibility during the match that he would need to do this.
SPEAKER_01: know maybe maybe no no no he he doesn't plan that he doesn't plan it but he's thinking that there is also a possibility for such a you know option like it it's very interesting i i have a lot of respect for for ermys as an arm wrestler how strong he is his his fundamental his wrist is very it's all very good but yeah when i watch that dave chafee match i get a lot of hope
SPEAKER_01: because if he's somewhere in the ballpark of where he was that day and Dave is somewhere in the ballpark of what he was when he pulled me, oh my, oh my. That could be interesting if those are what we're working with. If that's what we're working with,
SPEAKER_02: This is what I try to say. I saw the round one with Gennady. People think that Gennady had better endurance, but I still say the same thing.
SPEAKER_02: he forced you to pull inside and maybe his inside endurance was better than you, but your endurance is mostly built for outside for many years. You know that, right? You just started to go inside lately. You are, because you want to be more versatile after your elbow starts handling, you know, things, but it doesn't mean that like, so what I'm just saying, the round one, the domination in strength. So that like the position, like that,
SPEAKER_01: levan put hermes it doesn't have to be like this that where hermes started but if even the match stops this way hermes winning position but you still have your pronator in wrist so i'm not sure if that match stops anywhere kind of in the middle yeah oh my oh my if that match stops i think i think it gets really crazy um
SPEAKER_01: was against oh yeah gannati was really good for me because gannati has made me start to work all my inside stuff again i do all my inside training again now like i do high cup low cup supination work press i'm training all the motions again that i left behind for for a while after i pulled levon um in arm wrestling
SPEAKER_01: there's been many times in my career where i do a lot of exercises and then there's something that makes me cut everything and makes me do less and then it grows from there again and then i cut and i do less and this happened many times in my career levon was like the biggest cut like after levon i was like the only thing that matters is rise
SPEAKER_01: That is it. That is where the match is won and lost. And that is it. And that's one of the big things that I took away from LeVon was how important it was. And that turned into rise and roll. And I think that when you talk about hand control and outside moves, yeah, it's true. Rise and roll are very, very important. If you can secure the rise, it's very, very important for outside arm wrestling. But then you run into a flopper's pressure.
SPEAKER_02: and everything changes. So, so Gennady kind of gave that to me. And so now I'm, I'm more rounded than I was, you know, a few months ago, I'm much more well-rounded. Okay. The question is, I remember six months ago, you and Devon, um, Ermes had podcast, you know, like you were my guests and Neil was there. And then you told, you told Ermes that like, Ermes, uh, do you know,
SPEAKER_01: about the king's move it's what you told him and he told you that if you try to do that he's gonna break every piece of bone in your elbow you remember or that no probably not right yeah no i do remember i do it's uh and i've seen ermys pull king's movers before so ermys does have the ability to transition very well into a press which is great and so army
SPEAKER_01: Ermes has a great style to be able to combat anybody who drops their hand. And in a king's move, one of the things you do is you drop your hand a little bit and you start to pronate. And Ermes is very good at keeping his hand high and following up with the... He's very good at it. Now, it's one thing to know and it's another thing to be able to do. Just because you know the answer does not mean...
SPEAKER_02: But he's also capable of doing it, but he never pulled against you. But he's also capable of doing that. He used those kind of presses against Gennady, against Dave Sheffield, against many other guys. Yeah, I see. My question is, basically, like mentally, I think that, I don't know, like since Hell to John, if you have pulled someone
SPEAKER_02: arm wrestling as good as Ermes. My opinion. The guy is very good, smart, explosive. He can finish, he can do many things. My question to you, are you mentally prepared? You know, like, do you have all the answers or you are still trying to figure out, you know, like the possibilities if it goes like this, that, that, like, are you already done with your game plan?
SPEAKER_01: and then counters, you know, if this, I do this, if this is the position. So this is my question. We've been arm wrestling a long time, Engen, you know. Yes, yes, yes. Long time. We still learn. Oh, yeah. We still learn. And one of the things that is really required to win at this level is bravery, you know.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. All these guys are very, very smart guys. People think that they are big and not smart. They are very smart guys. Technically, I know what the answers are. But to be brave enough and have enough commitment on the day, that will be the question. And I'll tell you, I am.
SPEAKER_02: so fearless right now i've been given such a great opportunity yeah what an opportunity what what what a great opportunity that that i've been given you know for me i get so excited i think you both have fans have the opportunity i have the opportunity and animus has the opportunity you have the opportunity i think this is great for everyone just don't be like you know
SPEAKER_01: opportunities yeah okay i don't think that there has been like when you talk about rankings when you talk about rankings and i know that lavon is number one i know that however if he does not pull for one year he won't be then that's the thing
SPEAKER_02: So he is already declared by him. So that's why he's out of the ranking right now, because last match was February 25th. And he said the earliest I can pull engine March or April. So whenever he told me this, it is already out of the rankings. It doesn't mean that he cannot come back and become number one right away or not. I have no idea.
SPEAKER_02: don't know how oh i think he could jump in wherever wherever he wants he could levon can get any match he wants i think no no no i'm not talking about that not about the match if he can be successful winning or not because we don't know you know i'm sure he will come back strong but he needs to come and do it you know so but right now hermes is yes ranked number one in the world and i don't think that there's been i really don't think that there's been a number one ranked
SPEAKER_01: who's 48 in the super heavyweight, on the super heavyweight. Today, Jerry Cadoret made a comment. He said, come on now. Yeah, but Jerry Cadoret wasn't ranked number one. I mean, at the East, it was probably he meant, but it was most likely. No, but I'm talking about the ranking. I'm talking about ranking. I'm not talking about you're the winner of this league or the title holder of that league. I'm talking about number one ranked puller across leagues.
SPEAKER_01: at super heavyweight and i believe i believe that john is the oldest and i think he was 44. yeah 2018 i i think until he lost against you he was the best right i and that puts him that i think that makes him 44 i think yeah 44 he was 44 yeah yeah right and i think that that's the oldest so far so
SPEAKER_02: So that's why I'm like, especially because it's like another thing that I can get, right? Like oldest guy to hit it. Yeah, yeah. I like to say you need motivation, right? You want to do something that never has been done before. I'm so motivated. I also have the same thing, you know. Like I'm waiting for 2024 after October. Maybe I will try one more WUF, you understand? So I won the Worlds at 19, 20s, 30s, my 40s.
SPEAKER_02: And then if I come back, even if I don't win, but they get a medal in the five different decades, you know, I will be doing something, you know what I'm saying? So that is, yeah, I understand you very well because my mind also works the same way. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: There was a match, a lot of good matches on the card coming up. The American guy, he's really good, great hooker, got a really strong right arm. Is it Adam? Dustin, Dustin, Dustin Hyatt. Just before we go there, if you should project that, I don't want them to be feeling disrespected. Silky Wilkie, Devon, I love you so much. My scales of favor are equal in size for both you and Ermes, but Ermes seems to stand much closer to impart his influence currently.
SPEAKER_02: Can you ease my mind and explain to me some of the trajectory you expect the match to take? The trajectory I expect the match to take between Ermes and I? Yeah, I don't understand. You probably understand better. I don't fully understand. I don't have the super chat in front of me. But I think that...
SPEAKER_01: Oh, Devon, I love you so much. My skills of favor. Can you use my mind and explain the trajectory you expect? Okay, well, sure. The way I see the match kind of going is we'll be very positional. With Ermes and I, we'll be very positional.
SPEAKER_01: um i think that uh the way i see it favorably is both ermys and i want our hand position we will be fighting very much for this i believe now at the same time we both have the ability to do so many things
SPEAKER_01: It may not look the way we expect. I think people are kind of thinking Ermes is a top roller. I'm a Kings mover. But a lot of things change. This match may go in a hook. It may. Because we may be unsure of our hands. Both of us may be. I believe it will likely go on the strap. I'll tell you. I'll say it here first. I will beat him.
SPEAKER_01: gonna yeah yeah and i love this guy well of course i'm gonna beat him the thing is is i have so much respect for him and i'm so happy that he took the match for me it's it's a big deal that he that he took the match we weren't planning on doing this for quite some time but i just feel right now that i'm in just impeccable form and i think
SPEAKER_01: that he's not levon levon is this thing no and the thing is if the match is close like if that dave chafee match is any kind of an indicator yeah i'm gonna beat him if if it's anything if if he's anything like he was with dave that day i will beat him because when i pulled dave quite honestly i could do anything i wanted with him anything
SPEAKER_01: Um, and I knew that within the first round it didn't matter I could do any technique I wanted against any technique of his it did not matter so And and i'll tell you it would it look close to me. Maybe maybe ermys was playing But I don't think so. He wasn't playing. I don't think this was like straight He came here and stopped him and then he lifted him And the thing is is right now
SPEAKER_01: For whatever reason, the way my life has taken me, I am in a good place. And I'm going to come and I'm going to fight him in a way that he probably hasn't had to deal with before. He's very strong. I expect it to be a glorious fight. A glorious, glorious fight. But yeah, I think I'm going to beat him. I do.
SPEAKER_02: yeah so this is good that you know you are in a mindset that you know you are coming here i will tell you something not even a year ago i remember when i did that that uh podcast with you guys like you were talking about more like 115 kg you were saying i can go down to 120. i think that the only doubt that like you had it not with your
SPEAKER_02: experience your knowledge and this and that but i think your doubt was about your physical abilities because of the damages of the decades you know but now more it comes more you are able to apply what you know about arm resting i think more you are like like how can this arm go down this is how i see it i want to show you something yeah i want to show you something
SPEAKER_02: yeah but it's only between us right yeah yeah guys just close your eyes okay this is so yeah okay so you're gonna show me a lift right lift i'm gonna show you i'm gonna show you some numbers okay so i hope it doesn't fail okay so now i don't know i hope it doesn't fail
SPEAKER_01: So right now I'm doing a 100, 150 pound pronation lift. Like I can, I can definitely do more. It's very big weight. Yeah. It's good. I think it's a good weight. It's a good weight for me to be competitive at the world level. Like if I have that and it feels good and it doesn't,
SPEAKER_01: so sometimes when you start to lift heavy it'll hurt a little bit you know like if you've got a little injury here or there you'll do the lift but it doesn't feel right but right now you are able to apply all your power in your joint handles right yeah this is yeah my joint's good yeah you feel like a reborn like reborn like you're born again you know yeah so so i i got here i got here um
SPEAKER_01: know like 15 or 16 days ago now keep in mind i do not 100 okay okay so see see the sheet of paper yeah these are my three lips that i so the the the post and the roll i don't write it down because i just keep the piles on the floor all the time but my high cup low cup and my press you see all this times i've crossed out the number crossed out crossed out see all it's crossing out the numbers
SPEAKER_01: but how is it that you're training you're still increasing the weight you're like wow it's impressive seriously i train like four times a day i don't just train every day i'm training like three or four times a day and um and the thing is is like if you look at for example my press
SPEAKER_01: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19. I've taken 19 steps since I've been here. For your press? 19 steps forward. So 19 times I've increased the weight since I've been here. I don't know how you can do that. You are there for 15, 16 days. You are...
SPEAKER_01: able to even lift heavier 19 times while at the same time you are doing table times like seriously it is not like you know to i mean almost every day we did i i just stopped doing table time but we were doing every day one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen steps high cup multi spinner so right now my trajectory
SPEAKER_02: Like, for whatever reason, whether it's my psychological, my spiritual cleansing that I'm doing, the food I'm eating. All of them. My trajectory, it's just... All of them. Because of the stem cells, physically, you are there. And because of going to the town that, you know, you grew up, I think it affected you. Lately, I see you different, you know. I see you kind of more peaceful, like something more settled, you know.
SPEAKER_02: No, seriously. We all have... No, I think you're right. I think you're right. Just so you guys know, when I take a step forward, it's a pound and a quarter. I go up a pound and a quarter every time. For some of these, it ends up being significant. About 570 grams or something is good. There is a GB19 is asking, Devon, will you cut your hair for Ermes or Dennis?
SPEAKER_01: i don't know you know i probably should but i'm really kind of liking growing it out a little bit i'm having fun just letting it go so i don't know if i will i mean i probably should just to give them the respect but um and it's getting pretty long and dirty so i should probably cut it but i don't really want to and kind of we'll see we'll see i don't know yeah it's hot over here i don't know how it's canada right now because you guys don't know probably but devon
SPEAKER_02: and his son are coming 11 days before the event. So we will just spend some time together in the gym and talk about arm wrestling. Probing astrology, the point of the spear, the greatest ambassador the sport ever seen, and the once and the future king, Devon No Limits Larratt. I hope you are taking everything champ. Fight smart and eat their souls, he says.
SPEAKER_02: All in, all in. Listen, I'm surprised. Your appearance is surprising today. I was just like, I was like today, did you see the video Ermes put on? Talking about food at the end, he said like, why they will never put the video, like talk trash talk. And he said, I think he's too much scared, you know? And then now the way that you're talking trash, but you are just like so confident. I'll tell you.
SPEAKER_02: i am in a good place that's the thing right now there's a lot of things in my life that i've done here let me show you something else again okay while you're showing i will read another one john augustine thank you for generous super chat what an honor and privilege it is to be alive in the time of devon laratening in terzi it is your kindness my friend and i'm sure they will also appreciate it and neil pickups who wires boyfriend
SPEAKER_02: hard to beat some well-made pasta with Parmigiano. Thank you for your suggestion. I saw that. Whose food is better? Your food is better or Elvis' food is better? My food is so much better. I don't know if you can see this. Hang on. Just tell me. When you talk about rebuilding, rebuilding what you are,
SPEAKER_01: know so i've been it's been really just me like my kids were here for a bit jody came down visit but you know i've seen some of my friends but for the most part it's it's just been me and my mom and so it's it's been a period when i've tried to do some reflection yeah so so i've done this thing where i write words on the mirror that i try to think about and embody try and make myself
SPEAKER_02: grow as a person you know so i don't know if you can see this one peacefulness peacefulness yeah bravery bravery virtuous okay selfless selfless yeah you this is how you call me all the time when i promote everything you are you you
SPEAKER_02: Engin, you are very selfless. I was actually talking to my mom today about you, and I said you were extremely selfless. Acceptance. Acceptance, yeah. Responsibility. Yeah. Trustworthy. Yeah, that's very important. Hey, this one I got to work on, right, Engin? No, no, you're doing well, you're doing well. You're doing well, you're doing well, yeah. Yeah, I like this, yeah. Go ahead.
SPEAKER_02: Fearlessness. Fearlessness, yeah. And last, forgiveness. Yeah, that's very important as well. So you don't carry so many weight on you by just, yeah, you're right, you're right. Yeah. And listen, I will tell you something. When you are in the city and when everything is going on, you don't have time to think about all this. But when you are alone with your mother where you grow up, then now I think that's why you are healing, you know, because we all...
SPEAKER_02: need sometimes to go back to the roots and just stay away and then think that's good yeah yeah it's important it's important not everybody has a chance to do it i'm very lucky you're right sometimes i want to just go to a cave and then just yeah but you're busy you're very busy yeah yeah yeah um
SPEAKER_01: Rambo is saying, Devon, do you think endurance is going to be a factor against Ermes because your endurance didn't look at its best against Gennady? Yeah, yes, endurance, it's a super match. So in super matches, endurance is a factor. It's a very big deal. So long as it's close. If one opponent is just much stronger than the other, unless they have a serious...
SPEAKER_01: issue with endurance normally endurance doesn't come into play but endurance becomes very important when the athletes are close so if if the strength is is close and the technique is close then endurance can become the next factor that can make you make you win yeah so yeah definitely it's it's all going to come together all the pieces
SPEAKER_02: The full arm wrestling game will come into play between Ermes and I. Yeah, it is just incredibly, like, he is also a smart guy. He also has, like, big spirits. And you are the same way. You both are strong. I think you are at your strongest. This is, I really believe. After what I saw at Dubai, then I was like, how the hell is it possible that he is just directly going this way?
SPEAKER_02: going inside, shoulder pressure, top roll, open arm top roll. You did everything. Like you wanted to demonstrate everything. It's not like no disrespected day, but the way that you were able to pull was just like, wow. I was like, and then, as I said, like, I was like, I know about armless. I wish I was just, my elbows were like as strong, you know? And there is Michael Workspace. Thank you for your super chat. Hi, Devon. So far, Ermes is winning the foot battle.
SPEAKER_01: the food battle yeah i don't know yeah look at what i got it's pretty good food here it's pretty good i've been making like big big pots of food and i'll eat the same thing for like three days with like little things on the side but right now so the last one is a split pea soup with all sorts of vegetables and ham
SPEAKER_02: so i don't think armies is winning the food battle you know it's kind of a gimmick you know and and when i'm home i'll eat a bunch of pancakes just to top it off just to finish it you know yeah by the way you know sorry for forgetting that how is your mom because last time i asked you every time i see i asked you you said she is better better better now she is even better she's incredible yeah she's working so hard every day
SPEAKER_01: She does all her work. She does all her rehab and then a little bit. She's now, she doesn't even hardly need her cane. So everything is the way it should be. It won't be long and I can leave and she'll be great. Yeah, that's good. Someone, sensation, will the winner of Ermes versus Devon face Dennis? Okay, let's go there. I didn't
SPEAKER_02: post it, but I will post at some point, not before your Ermes match, because I want your mind to be just what's ahead of you. But I asked him, you know, I asked him, like, why, you know, like, he said, like, he could ask me privately, you know, like, if I could pull an August or not. And then he thinks that, you know, you did that intentionally to put him in a hard position. He said, Devon, Devon, he said, Devon, like, I am, like,
SPEAKER_01: Am I a bad person? What have I done to you that you're pushing me all the time? That's what he said. And I said, maybe he didn't do that intentionally. Maybe they were taught that. He started it. He started it, Egan. He did? Like, he started to get all upset that I wanted to have a rematch with Gennady. That was out of respect to him. I didn't want to face him as a guy who didn't even beat Gennady. Yeah, yeah. To me, I have Dennis very high. Yeah. Dennis is one of the guys, to me,
SPEAKER_01: Who's who has a chance to beat LaVon? He could if he can get back to his old form or somewhere better or around there he's got a chance and And so out of respect to him I was like I don't deserve to face you until I clean up my if I hadn't a beacon Adi I might not have pulled him might not you know, I'd love to look at I I would love to pull Dennis any way you got it. Yeah, but
SPEAKER_01: just wanted that match first and then he starts to throw out videos about me ducking him and how i'm scared of him and i'm like okay you know that's kind of weird but all right and then so i'm like so the ghanai match is cancelled and i'm like okay wow so now this is a great opportunity for that have the match i mean he's been resting since john when when was that match when did he pull john was it like january february
SPEAKER_01: uh february 25th so i'm like and i see videos of him training like five weeks that should be plenty of time and post out who's the clown who is the clown uh you know i've been arm wrestling as much as possible like i've been arm wrestling all the time
SPEAKER_01: uh you want this great big lead up to some and you were giving me trouble for ducking you and now i'm giving an opportunity to to have the match at a time that's pretty close to when we agreed on it yeah i don't know you know that's the difference that's the difference you see this is this is the difference between a guy like gannati a guy like ermys and a guy like dennis very different people gannati was offered a match he took it and then he was gonna pull me
SPEAKER_01: to me very brave very brave um same with armies dennis is so calculating he's so calculating yeah look you can judge people however you want look the thing is that influences the sport
SPEAKER_01: Does a little bit right if he would just relax just a little bit and say, okay, I'll pull you I'll just pull more frequently Thing is there's no reason why he needs to have this four-month leap. There's no reason In my opinion in my opinion he could pull more frequently
SPEAKER_02: In my opinion. Yeah, but he'd be just fine. His condition may be better. Listen, whenever I talk with him, I'm talking from your side. Whenever I talk with you, because he's not here, so I also answer for him. Yeah, I understand. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Look, I have Dennis way up here as an athlete, okay? He's one of the probably have more fun
SPEAKER_01: And that's the thing arm wrestle a lot. He needs to do this massive commitment where, you know, he needs to take all this time that he'd have more fun. He'd do better if he just pulled more regular and he could. Is there anywhere at the home that is just wifi or something is better? Yeah, I hope. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah. While you're going down. What's that? You tell me if it's better down here. Yeah, I will tell you. I was just... Better here? Yeah, now it looks better right now. Yeah, I think, yeah. Okay. Okay. Hey, Kathy, can I sit in here? Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: all right awesome man this might work i think it's um can you talk a little bit yeah yeah i think it's better but still not super good yeah but yeah um james mack you guys are great what where the wi-fi is we'll find out exactly where it is is the router in the computer room
SPEAKER_01: Good, okay. Close. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I think it's better, yeah. Anyways. Yeah. Anyways, it's getting close, Engin. Yeah. In three weeks, I will see you. Actually, less than. I'll see you. You see me in a week or something, eight days. Eight days or something, yeah. I'll see you in nine days or something, yeah? Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah. Auden's very excited. Yeah, I'm also excited. And I'm also, as I said to you privately, I'm honored that you thought that, you know, I would be the right person to show him some things, you know, because I'm sure you show him a lot of things, but it is better to listen from a few perspectives, you know. Yeah. That's good. That's good. Yeah. Yeah. And just read a few before people get upset. James, Mac, you guys are great. Thank you.
SPEAKER_02: both for expanding awareness for arm wrestling. Now I have a sport besides football to be passionate about. Thank you both and blessing to Devon on his match. And Wednesday Athletic Club, thank you for your support, Chet. Thank you, my friend. And because Ermes faced the day that beat Vitalii, Devon faced the day that probably loses to Bartlett at the practice.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe I talked to Dave. I actually, I sent Dave a message and I asked him, I said, I know you're hurt. I said, how much percentage did you lose? He thought he said it was pretty close. He said he was pretty close. Who knows? Who knows?
SPEAKER_01: All I hope is that if that match stops and we can arm wrestle, that's my hope. Because I believe when it comes to an arm wrestling match,
SPEAKER_01: i will beat him if it and decision making and patience and taking opportunity i'm gonna beat him i'm gonna beat him so if that match is close in strength so long as i'm in that fight and once and once i get an advantage then i will test him we'll see who teaches who that day one of us will be the teacher
SPEAKER_02: Sometimes the young man can teach the old man that he's not strong enough. But if I get to teach Ermias, believe me, I'll make it a good lesson. Do not lie. Engin pronated Devon's Wi-Fi. It's bad, huh? Brad connection. What can I do? I can't just stop, you know, because my pronator is just, you know how it is.
SPEAKER_02: Devon, I was thinking about it and now I have to ask you, if you beat Ermes, will you flex your right bicep and scream two bells, two bells? Imagine if I could get three. Oh, you're talking about 231 against Ongar. Well, you are terrible person. You want everything. Imagine, imagine.
SPEAKER_02: Imagine if I could hold three. I don't know. We won't say. Devon, super glad your mom's doing better. You are the man. Ermes is getting cracked. Flying Ryan. Thank you for your super chat. Devon, how much did you gain weight for Ermes? I have no idea. I don't have a scale here that works. I have no idea. I don't feel heavy. I feel light. I think that I'm probably maybe.
SPEAKER_01: maybe I was when I left the house I was 265 266 in the morning so I don't know I don't know but the way I tell you the the weight is is one thing but and strong so yeah that's what it matters you know the Ermes also had the same type of time you know I need to get bigger I need to get bigger but now he finally realizes that it's not about that you know
SPEAKER_02: Will you read my first support chat, Engin? Sorry, my friend. I'm just trying to check. I'm trying not to cut, Devon. Mr. Brain Junkie, Devon, what is your weight right now and how heavy are you planning to be during the match? Yeah. I'll just be as big and as healthy as I can be. That'll be it. Devon, are you going to bleed out Ermes or pin him? If I can...
SPEAKER_01: lead him out i certainly will um i'm looking for victory i'm looking for victory insecure victory well we'll see after that sometimes the best thing to do in a super match is not to pin sometimes it's not depends on your opponent how about if this is the last one oh i will make him never forget i'll make him never forget
SPEAKER_02: you are in a house that you know your roots are connected and look at what you are saying just go read what's written on the mirror just go back just joking listen this is an evil thing this is a great thing that this is a gift that i give him to give give a young only make him stronger oh yeah so you are not thinking that it is a destruction for this confidence
SPEAKER_01: for many people it would be but for a champion it'll only make oh so he's gonna he's gonna come back and um you do why do you think i can break him you think that i can break kermes i have no idea i have no idea no of course not of course not some people are unbreakable yeah like for example yourself
SPEAKER_01: you when you get broken it just makes you stronger yeah that's a sign of a champion a real champion break them the stronger they become yeah some people who are not champions they get broken and it's difficult for them it's difficult and i don't want to break those people i'm not interested in that i'm only interested in breaking someone people some people he creates trauma you know they don't want to face the same guy again
SPEAKER_02: Jay Mania. Hi, Devon. Big fan of yours and I plan on going to Toronto next week. Would you mind if I come up to you for a picture? Bring on the belt. You're going to have a picture with him? Of course, yeah. See you in Toronto. It's going to be a great event. Mr. Brain. Yeah, John Brzezink versus Todd Hutchings. Matt Mass. Kalenchenko.
SPEAKER_01: Mr. Brain Junkie Devon, I remember you did high cup multi 440s before. How come you are doing less now? You know, I should make a video about it. I'll probably include it in the next video. The multi spinner is the most easy tool to cheat. Okay, so all the lifts...
SPEAKER_01: well it's just it's it's more correct it's more correct listen i could i could set up that multi spinner in a way where i imagine this is a multi spinner if you have it high up in your hand it's way hard but the multi spinner you can adjust it so it goes further down your wrist and then it just turns more into a drag so
SPEAKER_01: but i'll tell you i just started if you would cheat as when you did 140 you can still do the same thing right now i could probably cheat and do a much much bigger lift yeah now i have just started doing the inside lifts but my form is good i'm very happy with my looking at the numbers as well i know i used to do a low cup with like almost 160 i think but i was watching and the thing is what happens a lot when you
SPEAKER_01: heavier and heavier and heavier because your form starts to become compromised. And the multi-spinner tool is one that depending on where the cup, where the pipe is set. Big difference. Big difference. Paul Amfone, Engin did miss my previous chat. I asked about why Devon never puts chalk or he never leaves his arm up in between the matches.
SPEAKER_01: matches big big fan of both of you sorry guys i'm trying to not to cut devon and then the chat goes can you answer the devon please the chalk thing i do use chalk sometimes i do yeah sometimes i don't i don't normally practice with chalk but i do use chalk on occasion um you know sometimes i'm trying to slip a lot so chalk is you know still going to help depending on where the chalk is but no i do use chalk
SPEAKER_01: um you can see that i had chalk on with dave chafee when i offered him the chalk and i dropped it but uh why i don't really lift my arm and do massage i i just let the blood do its thing i i let it i let it kind of move through i just try and relax as much as i can between rounds um i don't know that rubbing my arm is going to make much of a difference i don't i don't know i don't i don't think it makes much of a difference okay okay devon's mom is cheating him
SPEAKER_01: She is unknowingly decreasing the gravity for each of his training sessions. She might be. Yeah. She might be. The laps are good because she loves you so much. So she is just doing that way. So you think that you are lifting heavy. You know, my son, Auden, before I pulled Michael, we play a lot of Mortal Kombat. And for about a week before I left, he let me beat him, and I didn't even know. So sometimes people do nice things.
SPEAKER_01: we play mortal kombat we use a video game yeah and and he's better than me so he beats me at mortal kombat yeah but for about a week before i left to go and pull michael he was intentionally letting me beat him and then when i got because when i got back he started beating me again and he's like he's like oh yeah just so you know he's like
SPEAKER_02: I'm like, oh, you. But it worked. It worked. Because I did. I started to feel like I was really smart. Asim Barakzai, Devon keeps bringing up his match with an injured Dave compared to when Ermes faced him. What about their perspective matches versus Gennady and Levan? In both cases, Ermes did much better. I'll tell you. Ermes is a favorite.
SPEAKER_01: Ermes is stronger. He's prime of his life. Many factors on why Ermes should beat me. You don't have to worry. He is the favorite. But the problem is, is the universe that we're living in, somehow fate smiles on me all the time. I don't know how it happens. I'm very lucky. For me, a small chance is pretty good.
SPEAKER_02: normally it works i don't know how but if there's a small chance quite often i find a way okay flooring moza finish him devon two weeks full throttle with with takes yeah two more weeks of training i think yeah yeah no ally in yeah i finally caught a live looking good engine devon training looking awesome
SPEAKER_01: Do you think you will shoot inside and hold Ermes instead of going outside? I don't know. I'm not sure. I know that I'm going to get up there and fight him. And the thing is, is when people talk about arm wrestling, when you talk about arm wrestling at the highest level, at the highest level, you're fighting for everything, everything.
SPEAKER_01: It's not just about top roll or post or hook or press or flop or king's move. You're fighting for every single little piece. And if you're healthy and you're balanced, you will fight from the center. You will fight from a central position where you can go either inside or outside. And that's when you know that you're healthy and good. When you're not saying, oh, it's going to be a top roll or, oh, I'm going inside.
SPEAKER_01: The best place to be when you know you're good is that you fight from the middle. You fight from the middle and you adjust as required and opportunities will present themselves and you need to be brave and secure enough to be able to take advantage of them very quickly. Yeah, I think that one of the reasons that you are also not doing so much trash talk is because I kind of think that you look confident because this is not the first time that you are telling me
SPEAKER_02: Like you are feeling with Brad lifestyle. Thank you for your support. Devon, get that syrup with the pancakes. Finish him. Florin Moisa. Eating everything. And Paul Amfone. Devon, I noticed you during the matches. You are the only one that doesn't seek out the chalk or elevate his arm hand or get arm massage.
SPEAKER_02: between the matches why is that i think this is the uh super chat that he he said that i missed it he went down right haven't you crushed talk to hermes does this have to do with you trying to be a better person or is the trash talk coming soon db talks well that's the thing that people have this misconception about people think that i always started i never started
SPEAKER_02: I almost never started. Go back. It's just how you deceive your mom when she told you that. And then you're like, mom, I'm not the one who started. There are so many misconceptions. Only your mom believes that, OK? I don't. There's so many misconceptions, Adnan. Pick a guy. Pick a guy. I'll tell you what they said to me to make me start. OK. Pick a guy.
SPEAKER_02: There's a reason I talked crap to everybody. I mean, if you are looking for a reason, then you will find a reason. But, you know, like, like. Right now, I'm just so happy. That's the thing. So right now, my. Today, you don't do trash talk because you are scared, but you still don't do it. Well, I mean, obviously, I'm not scared. That's just a silly thing.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, I'm sure it'll start. I'll probably look more closely at him and I'll find out something about him that I don't like. Devon't force yourself or anything. Just do as you feel. Here's the thing. Right now, today, what is it? I don't even know what day it is. Today, my overwhelming feeling is that I'm so happy that he said yes. And I have a shot at a world title.
SPEAKER_01: Super heavyweight title. You know what that feels like, right? I'm just so happy about it. I'm so happy. And he's the one who made it possible. So I don't really want to talk crap to him because he's given me a gift. So if he's giving you his belt, championship belt, how can you talk back to this guy, right?
SPEAKER_01: How can I? He just gave me what I wanted. He just gave me exactly what I wanted. Yeah. Yeah, you're right. You're totally right. I mean, the guy is giving you his belt, and you should just only think, you know, why would you say something better about him? Look, I'm sure that we're still three weeks. I'm sure that there's going to be something. But if there's not, then I'll just keep training and getting stronger and get ready for the fight of my life, you know?
SPEAKER_02: BKC arm, quality pancakes meets quality pasta. Pancakes versus pasta. Ivan Chuk, Devon, Ermes hand collapsed under Devon's auto straps. Is that your hope? Ermes won't get same setup against you as he did against Dave. I think I catch all the superchats, maybe, except last a few, you know.
SPEAKER_02: I don't want to disrespect some people. Wow, I went so far. Hey, Angus. Yeah, okay. Thank you so much for what you do for the sport, man. Seriously. Look at where we are. Very nice work. Very nice work. My friend, we are a beautiful sport. People don't understand how many muscle groups in this arm
SPEAKER_02: and then to coordinate them. Yeah. That's the tattoo I see. Yeah. Yeah. Anyways, how many muscle groups over here and then to coordinate them together and then with the upper body and everything, you know, people just think that, you know, arm wrestling is like this, like that, like you understand you, you know what it is, you know what it is. And then when people are so ignorant about it,
SPEAKER_02: you cannot really get angry with them because they just don't know we did not really show them enough you understand and then like this is what you are doing you have been this why we call you the best ambassador you know people may like your style may not like your style but you are just making people like you are a window to outside of honesty so what i am just doing is i see that every part is ready so we are just having
SPEAKER_02: Fun together. We are just coming and then playing together for years. I remember one time I was a guest for Neil's program and I said, Neil, you know, like, I mean, when are we going to be like pulling all together, you know? And he said, it will never happen. Look at now. Do you realize that how frequently all these top guys are pulling against each other? And do you realize that, you know, we are not doing only that. There are lightweight, there are left arm, there are middleweight and everything.
SPEAKER_02: So you remember that when John had the 95 kilo title and he won the super heavyweight title. And then do you remember that he was planning to pull Rustam Bauer by going down to 86 kilo? Do you remember? He went down to 89 or 90 kilo and then Rustam said that he fell down in the restroom or something and the match was canceled. But John was going for his third belt, but he couldn't. Yeah. And now when you talk about like,
SPEAKER_02: super heavyweight and then whatever you said maybe for the three title so i kind of realized that you may do something crazy whenever you are a little bit down you know with the heavyweight pressure and then now going down for longer but if you do that if you do that i think that i could look at if i live around 260 okay if i'm like 260 265 that's perfect for heavyweight perfect right
SPEAKER_01: right there for 115 it's not hard like if i'm like if i'm 255 260 even that's a water cut that you can do oh yeah yeah yeah i know that i know that you can do it like not many people can do that but people who knows who has experience can do that i'm sure you did for the maybe wal you did it for some time yeah okay i was doing so i would walk around like 247 248 that's my normal body weight in the morning every day when i was wal
SPEAKER_01: So WL and I do that water cut. No problem. I didn't even need to use a sauna. No sauna, just, you know, salt water manipulation. You can lose that weight. No problem. No problem. Yeah. And then you're the same weight on the day. You know, you have a 24, 36 hour weight. You're right there. So, I mean, if I'm 255, 265, somewhere around there, potentially I can, I can take a shot at any one of those three weight categories.
SPEAKER_02: at any time yeah yeah yeah this is i i believe that i believe that it doesn't mean that for sure you can be successful but you have really good opportunity um vincent valentin hey devon use some ask waganda and some bcas for recovery and strength well yeah yeah yeah a friend of mine from florida sent me some ash ashwagandha what is that
SPEAKER_01: it's a herb it's i think it's mostly for virility yeah gives you give you power that you can't believe um yeah no i'm serious no it's good oh this guy says for recovery okay yeah it's just like it it's gonna maybe maybe the second part of his super chat was about recovery i don't know yeah it's good it's it's a great herb yeah
SPEAKER_02: um and thank you for putting together great events and helping to drive the sports forward thank you my friend what were you saying sorry i caught you oh no i was just continuing yeah and bcaa yeah yeah i'm not taking anything like that right now but yeah for sure it's good stuff yeah i see you are eating tons of food you know every day i see if you live only with your mom and i see so many food there you know probably you're eating a lot um look what i have
SPEAKER_01: Just don't move so much from where you are because I don't want the connection. Oh yeah. Yeah. What is this exactly? Is that there is meat in it as well? Yeah. What's the beef? No, it's, it's, it's ham, but it's good. Okay. Lots of beans, lots of, lots of peas, lots of vegetables and just make great big pot and we just eat it all day long. And for like three days. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: let's let's read a few questions and slowly finish it uh three four while gripping tucking the thumb between middle and index fingers affect the pronation or hand control power and it often does what he does they wouldn't think uh to cover the thumb or not to cover the thumb um i find that uh
SPEAKER_01: A lot of it has to do with the hand dimensions, how your hands match up. I find when I'm arm wrestling a guy with a big hand, and so many guys in the super heavyweight division have really big hands, that to cover the thumb actually can loosen your grip a little bit, so it's not really worth it what you gain. But in the lighter divisions, like when I pull more heavyweight,
SPEAKER_01: or even lighter, I'll typically cover the thumb because the thickness of the hand is not so great. And the advantage that I'll get by covering my thumb through pronation, it's worth it. But a lot of it has to do with how big the guy's hand is that you're pulling. I mean, it's totally about how you feel comfortable, basically. And you most of the time realize this while gripping up with the guy. You don't just go there, I will do this, but you just hold it and you think, ah, maybe this is better.
SPEAKER_02: I do that once my hand is getting tired. So I cannot like, because you start like this during the match, you will slide down. You're losing your grip. So better start like where it is, you know? Yeah. Yeah. Jordan Carson, would you come to Michigan for a practice and seminar? For sure. Yeah. But not before the match. Yeah. Yeah. I'm sure that you would. Yeah. I mean, you're coming here in eight days as well. Let's do some things, you know, we go to beach.
SPEAKER_01: Vitamin D is good, huh? Vitamin D, do you like it? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, Adnan and I are so excited. We're so excited. It's going to be an amazing trip. Yeah, it will be. And then let's talk about a few things. Vitalii versus Revaz. I have to go with Vitalii. They're both incredible. But the thing is, for me, I don't know. I could be totally wrong.
SPEAKER_01: I still hold on to the belief that Vitalii can be the best, maybe. I think that Vitalii is a very, very good arm wrestling athlete. And I know that for the last year, his performances, some of them have been great, and then some of them have been not what we expect of Vitalii. But I believe that Vitalii is incredible.
SPEAKER_01: incredibly dangerous especially potentially in a match where it's going to be decided by who can top roll better um but Rivas has got an incredible hand and incredible top roll abilities I'm really excited about the match um I have a question for you I have a question for you um do you that match is going to happen right before your match will result of that match affect
SPEAKER_02: your psychology at all because they both pull against Dave Chaffee and then if Vitalii somehow beats him, will it make it like Revaz beat Deju because Deju and this and then you pull Deju and he was like, you understand my point, right? Will it affect at all or not at all? I hadn't thought of that until now. Thank you, Egan.
SPEAKER_01: ah it's not good because something but yeah go ahead i mean vitali and dave had to in my opinion one of the best matches that i've ever seen in arm wrestling like ever um that was such a great match um yeah you know there's a lot of styles but um i do believe that dave has gotten a bit weaker but
SPEAKER_01: know matchup is interesting matchups is a very interesting thing um i thought that vitality was going to destroy dave that's what i thought yeah but do you think that like it is also sometimes style yes of course i mean yeah i mean it's not like because this guy beat this guy it doesn't mean that this guy will beat the other guy you know it doesn't it doesn't always mean that no
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I'm not going to take too much away from the match, except for probably to enjoy it. And, you know, I'll break into the Dave analysis of exactly where he is probably later. Look, at that point, it's blinders on and get ready to fight. Yeah, I wish I never put this thought on your mind, but...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, you did. You just did that. Now I have to switch to, I hope Rivas kills him. Now that's what I have to say. Vincent Laletin, hey Dave, do you fear his back pressure and improve yours? He's asking you, are you afraid of Ermes' back pressure? That's probably, yeah, that's one of his most dangerous weapons, is his back pressure and his wrist in general.
SPEAKER_01: Like, Ermes' wrist, his cup, his pronation, his back presser, his rise. These fundamental pieces of arm wrestling is where Ermes is very impressive. Yeah, yeah. And, you know, the way he beat Jerry, you know, in his last, you know, appearance. Incredible shape. Incredible. Yeah. Do you think that, like, Ermes was someone whose hand was...
SPEAKER_02: ahead of his arm and horsepower. But once he pulled Levan, I kind of realized that his arm is now ahead of his hand and wrist. Like I think that he has so much horsepower back there, you know, and it doesn't mean that his hand is getting any weaker, his hand is also getting stronger, but arm just got so much strong compared to past. So when you compare round one, you versus Levan,
SPEAKER_02: like back pressure, because the other rounds, Levan went more like sideways, you know, instead of just trying to topple your hand after his experience. And then whenever we saw Levan and Ermes going back pressure, do you, like, how do you compare your wrist? Like when Ermes and you both go back pressure, like, do you see you losing your wrist or he losing, or you feel like, you know, you both being like neutral, like flat wrist,
SPEAKER_01: you both go outside well that's just it right that's what's gonna decide such a big part of the match yeah um hey if it's i am just hoping that we each hold on to pieces if we each are not fully compromised if it's a complete blowout of one or another of a wrist uh then
SPEAKER_01: But if we hold on to pieces, even if I hold on to a small piece or heat, you know, whatever, that's when it will start to get very interesting. I do believe that it will be a very difficult fight for both of us. I don't think either one of us is going to concede. I think that we will continue to fight as hard as we can for the entire three, five rounds, whoever, whatever it is. Can I ask you something?
SPEAKER_02: Do you, like, whenever I saw where the match stopped like this, when you and David Sheffield loaded, and then whenever I saw the round one with Gennady, you were like, like, usually lately for some years, we see you like here, you know, here, but now you're protecting the center.
SPEAKER_01: A little bit more. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's as a result of my surgeries. It's a style that I adopted due to injury. You know, for many years after I had elbow surgery, I was forced into a very open pulling style just because I had no elbow stability. You didn't want to have pressure on your elbow. You just wanted to get away from the... You didn't want elbow to handle the pressure. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah. So as I have regained my health and my stability now, I still, I still go that way quite often because I've become so comfortable with that style and I find it. Yeah. And I find it. It's a great start. How long have you been going that way? Seven, eight years already. Oh, longer than that. Almost 10, 10.
SPEAKER_01: when you pulled tim bradley you were still going like here 2012. but yeah right but then i had the surgery i had the surgery right after that match so i had surgery 2012 2013. yeah i had two surgeries in my right elbow right and then after that i was open i was open open open yeah i could i could get very deep but
SPEAKER_02: Central stability? No, no, no. I understand. Yeah. So how do you see this one? How do you see that? Where is it? What's your plan? You think that because you said that whoever dominates the hand is going to win. But if somehow you dominate, he said, but you are halfway here and we know that he has incredible press. So losing his wrist at such point, will it matter a lot? Just tell us. Oh, yes. Yeah. What?
SPEAKER_01: If you take it, you're going to beat him? If you take his wrist, you're going to beat him? Oh, yeah. Of course I will. But you didn't continue going out with Gennady because you couldn't really keep your elbow. You went forced inside. I don't think that Ermes and Gennady are exactly the same when it comes to their flop-wristing ability. Now, I'll tell you. In my opinion, Gennady has the ability to open as a flop.
SPEAKER_01: open. And now look, I'm not going to say that Gennady, sorry, that Ermes can't do it. But what I saw with, um, with Lavon was I saw a failed top roll, right? So he topped and then there's a transition. Yeah. And this is not the same move. The transition to a press after a top roll. Oh, okay. Okay. Okay. I understand. So what Gennady did was right away,
SPEAKER_02: And what Ermes was doing, listen, Ermes tried to do that to Gennady, sorry, Levan, went round three, he stopped him. You remember round three, he stopped him, and then he was like, and then Levan got a foul. In the second start, Ermes made a mistake. I also talked with him. He wanted to do that right away, and then he got smoked. Because that was not the reason that he stopped Levan.
SPEAKER_02: The reason he stopped him was his back pressure first. And then that one didn't have pull up. So he just go like this, but he didn't have the control over. So he slowly came and then, yeah. So it's not the same move. It's not quite the same.
SPEAKER_02: But he can do the same thing. He can still go with you, back pressure, back pressure, back pressure, and then lose it. He still has the pronator. Yeah, but it's not the same. It's not the same, really. Like, yeah, you're pulling with everything. Yeah, for sure. So you are saying that if somebody is switching to shoulder pressure after you top roll him, it's not going to be the same. But do you also remember, sorry for catching you, but you said that there was a point that round one, John could...
SPEAKER_01: do the transition period. So what if Ermes gets that opportunity? Yeah, that's fine. But the thing is, once the wrist becomes compromised of anybody, then you start to make adjustments and you can tighten things up. The second time will be much more difficult to do the same move. Like if you top roll someone and they try and top roll you and you take the wrist and then they come forward and they switch to a press and a flop and they get you, that's fine.
SPEAKER_01: But the next round, it will be very much harder for them to do that same move. Very much harder. Because you can go a little bit more inside and you can cut the option for them. Unless they can go right for the flop. Unless they can go right with the shoulder. I don't know if Ermes can do that or not. I haven't seen him do it yet. Not effective. No, not right away. Yeah, that's good. Looks like the more I talk with you, the more I realize that
SPEAKER_02: um whenever at the beginning of the podcast you said i'm gonna beat him again so it just means that like mentally you are already prepared you know you are ready you are you let me tell you what that match stops that that that young champion is in big trouble yeah if that match stopped that young champ is gonna have his work cut out for him he's got to beat me quickly he has to yeah yeah okay
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, okay. I see the same Devon. Same Devon with the more chosen words, you know. Like, old Devon would say the same thing, but if they messed up, I would destroy him, you know. But now, the young guy is in trouble. We're just getting started, Engin. We're just getting started. I'm still just so happy. Like, I'm still just very happy with these ideas. Sean, Broppy, Devon, the new peaceful warrior. Larratt. Two legends. Thanks, Engin. Thank you, guys. And...
SPEAKER_02: one second paul i'm funny why is he standing in the chat samson's trying to say hi what's up buddy yeah yeah yeah i love that guy nice he did a nice win there with uh with pablo i like that match yeah yeah see they're asking you christo versus bart who is devon your favorite your favorite reps
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, look, when it comes to, I'll tell you one thing. If I had one thing that I could say to the referees, one thing, I would say, try not to make yourself too important. This is a very difficult thing for referees to do. I think that the best referee can understand when both arm wrestlers are happy. This is very important.
SPEAKER_01: When both arm wrestlers are happy and yet the referees are still trying to make things better somehow, I think that that's where they can make a mistake. I think if two guys are like, yes, yes, let's do it, let's do it, say go, say go. Yeah, let them fight. Yeah, yeah. Hey, Dave, are you working on your triceps, especially long head? It will help you with your elbow.
SPEAKER_01: as well as your press, as it seems to be your weaker link. I've been working my press. I've been working ever since Gennady beat me. I've been working a lot of supination, like so a lot of things that bring my arm inside my body. I've been working a lot of press. I've been working a lot of like pushing motions.
SPEAKER_02: I don't worry about like long head or like the muscle. I just do movements. I just focus on the movement. I understand. You don't train the muscle. No, just the movement. You train the movement and whatever is working at that point, you use that one. I understand. Yeah. And all the strength, Devon, you got to shave your head for the match. We'll see. No promises. No promises. No promises, but okay, then I think finishing. Yeah, yeah. Everything finished.
SPEAKER_02: I thank you very, very much. There are many matches, but I'm not going to ask you tomorrow. Tomorrow, Ermes is going to be my guest. Well, tell him he's finished. Tell him he made a big mistake by accepting the match. He made a big mistake, right? After he sees your confidence, tomorrow he's going to say, oh, my elbow hurts. Maybe I canceled the match. No, he's coming at me. He's coming at you? Not this guy. He's a fighter.
SPEAKER_02: Gladiator, Gladiator, right? Gladiator, yeah. King of hearts. Yeah, yeah, yeah. All those guys up there, just look at them. Look at Gennady. I mean, just look at... I mean, all of them are warriors. All of them, yeah. Some of them, a little bit more warriors. Like, whenever a warrior comes to my mind, also, for sure, Gennady also comes. He gives his all, you know, heart, you know. Anyways, Devon, eight days or nine days, whatever, I see you.
SPEAKER_02: and and then hopefully we will have good time and then yeah yeah and then i wish you the best with your preparation and thank you for being uh my guest and thanks to everyone who has been uh watching us and so tell your mom that as a community we give her best wishes you're gonna you know i'm sorry hey everybody wishes you the best cali
