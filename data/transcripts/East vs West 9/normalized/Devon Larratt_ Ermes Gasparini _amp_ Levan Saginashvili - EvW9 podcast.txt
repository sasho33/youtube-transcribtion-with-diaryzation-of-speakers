Speaker: Thank you.
Speaker: Thank you.
SPEAKER_02: Hello, guys.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, guys, I'm here just now for a nice podcast about East versus West 9. I don't care what you call me, this and that. Some of you create enough shit everywhere, other channels. And here, if you're going to enjoy, if you're going to, I mean, have fun, then you are more than welcome if you are for our message.
SPEAKER_01: anyone who is who come here for provocation please don't cry when you get blocked so let's go anyway so hello guys hello hello hello michael workspace mustafa john warmer fly victor kim nelson hello my friend matteo new guy nomad cognome clayton
SPEAKER_01: David, hello, hello guys. A lot of messages, so. Thank you guys. I think I do my best. I do my best. I will do, I will continue doing my, hello, hello, Dr. Alex. Hello, my friends. Continue to bring the best super matches for you. And so I think everything will be,
SPEAKER_01: Everything will be great. Hello to Brazil, Nestor. One rep bicep curl. I never tried one rep bicep curl, my friends. Hello to USA. Hello, hello, hello, everyone. Great to see you all. Great to see you all.
SPEAKER_01: East versus West in the UK. I don't know. Anything is possible, my friend. Devon't you think Togurs Ongar will make some... Okay, yeah, we need to talk about this thing because Katashins wanted to pull Samushia Andreev for 95-kilo world title. But we will talk. I will talk with Katashins and then we will see what we can do. Now there will be WAF. Also, WAF results are very important.
SPEAKER_01: We cannot just go, my friends, like we cannot have a static mind, you know, we need to follow what's going on in the world and then. Thank you, Ciro. Hello to Bulgaria, Julian. Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I think most likely, most likely we will cooperate with Devon Larratt when we organize the East versus West in US, maybe in Canada, I don't know. But for all the qualification and everything, Pauline and James Reed, they are the responsible ones. Dr. Alex Straub,
SPEAKER_01: know that he's sorry for you about your last name pronunciation keep up great work yeah i would love seeing todd and go for a title yeah yeah yeah i mean todd hashing is gonna pull a title match but i mean to pull on garvey for a title under five kilo he needs to beat um
SPEAKER_01: Ibragim Sagov. If he loses against Ibragim Sagov, I don't think because Ibragim Sagov matches at 105 kilo. A mighty silverback. About Derek Smith, I can say that Derek's previous two losses are my fault. After he beat Tim Bresnan, I kind of misjudged his level.
SPEAKER_01: and I directly put him against two monsters, Revaz and Morozov. So it was my mistake. When he lost the first time, I think it was Morozov, I thought that he was a last minute replacement. If you remember, I think Marseille got COVID or something, and then it was so I thought maybe he wasn't ready. So next time I did it against...
SPEAKER_01: Revaz, so then we realized that he needs a little bit more time. So this is his next chance right now. And I don't know Brazilian armwrestler. I have no idea. Hello to South Africa. I have been there. South Africa is one of the most beautiful country I have ever seen. I went to that Kruger National Park. It was beautiful. Terence took me there.
SPEAKER_01: It was beautiful, yeah. I really love the time that I spent in South Africa. Yeah. Hello, Triceps. Thank you, my friend. How many times has John... I have no idea how many times John had that. I think Morozov needs time, my friend. I think Morozov needs time. Morozov is one of our superstars and we should be, you know, patient.
SPEAKER_01: I'm not sure. I want to pull in November, but I don't know about the level. If I feel so good, it depends on September, how I feel. If I feel super good, I don't know if I'm going to feel super good, but I may pull for a title match. If I don't feel that way, then it will be maybe a step below a title match, but we will see. But I'm getting...
SPEAKER_01: I see Zurab Korival's training. I think he's too early, too early. I have seen people breaking their arm and then again breaking their arm when they start doing early training. Zurab needs to really, he's coming here. I hope he's not going to injure himself. Whenever he comes here, I will have a serious talk with him. And I will just share my experiences, not my own experiences, but the things that I have seen. And he's a very good guy. Zurab is just a great guy, you know.
SPEAKER_01: What do you mean how to be a guest, my friend? I don't know. I don't know.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, Bacho. See, Bacho, in fact, I set a match for Bacho for November already. His opponent accepted, Bacho accepted, but I may do changes. It's very important for me to see the WAP results. Because in WAP, this year, Bacho is pulling 100 kilo. Ungarbev is also pulling 100 kilo. And we will see. Thank you, Salvatore. Thank you, my friend. Thank you. I mean, like, I know that all the...
SPEAKER_01: True Armwrestling fans, they support me. I know for sure. I know. And I see this. I receive countless messages. They are just not as loud as haters. My friend, the arena is open. I will tell you something. The arena can have 2,000 people.
SPEAKER_01: And every event there is there are like minimum to 300 people there to 300 people, but the problem is they don't sit together they sit everywhere, so maybe we should just ask them to sit at the bottom for the order. auditorium you know. But this time I will even enforce more people to come.
SPEAKER_01: Thank you guys, thank you, thank you see you look at this sport, you know sports yeah. Hello to a i'm ready i'm ready yeah Hello, my I didn't forget about you, I will invite you directly for a lifetime supermatch.

I reminded him the last time we talked on the, you know, we did the video chat. I said, you know, and so as far as I know, it is set, you know. Zaur is going to compete as well.
SPEAKER_01: Just don't worry. Zaur was set against Ermes, if you guys remember. He injured his bicep, and then he competed the AMC event. Not like we didn't invite him or something, but... More tables to the event for practice. What do you mean, Marvin? You're going to bring Ermes in table? Okay, who is coming here? This is the first person. Hello!

SPEAKER_04: Devon't lose your passport. Devon't crash your car, please. Devon't worry, Ermes. I will be there. You will see me. You have nothing to worry about. Because sometimes American people get too much scared. Some people do get scared. Some people do. I myself, Ermes, have been very scared in my life before. Okay. Nice. Yes.
SPEAKER_04: i have felt very much fear in my life nice that's why it means you get gray hair when you get older it's from fear yeah what is it fear like afraid of something you know you're afraid of something fear you know you're like yeah yeah but my guess is that none of them was at the arm-nesting table
SPEAKER_03: Can you rotate your phone, Levan? Is it possible or no? Like this? How is your wrist, Levan? Normal. Normal? Yes. Every day I go to the doctor, rehabilitation. I'm thinking about packing.
SPEAKER_04: thinking about putting my clothes in a bag tomorrow i get on an airplane yeah he's coming tomorrow he's coming early tomorrow tomorrow yeah so don't worry about me losing my passport armies i'll be there waiting tomorrow tomorrow i fly and i understand because you wanted to you wanted to learn something and
SPEAKER_04: About anything, huh? Yeah, yeah. You want some lesson for beating? I need to learn how to arm wrestle. Huh? Yeah. But it's not enough, my friend. Not enough? Too much power difference. You think? Too much power. You can lift 2,000 weight whenever you want.
SPEAKER_04: Not enough. How heavy? How heavy? You see the lift I do with the belt? 50 kilo. Yeah, like 67 or something. 68 maybe. Yeah, is good weight. What about you? How much? 102.
SPEAKER_04: 102, like that. Yeah. Really like that. I put the video, I put the video, my friend. I didn't see the video. Where's the video? Before Levan fight. Oh, no, no, no. How much you do right now? You do off the floor, 90 degree bang. 102 kilo. Yeah, 90 degree.

SPEAKER_04: 75 kilo eating 25 kilo come on yes my friend you gained 25 kilos i don't think that's possible no but do you think dave is strong like when he fought with me
SPEAKER_04: And you, I can't imagine because to me felt like kind of like a child, like no problem, no problem. So that's why I wonder, I mean, I see you lift all the big weights and that's awesome. But then I watched that match and I'm like, it's kind of weird because I think I would beat him. If I just looked at that match, if I just look at that match, I think, okay, I beat him.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, but there are other matches, my friend, to look. With Gennady, I won easy. Yeah, but even with Gennady, you know, maybe... With Levan, some difference. Good fight with Levan. Good fight, yeah. Evgeny though he killed you for nothing. Yeah, still good fight. Good fight.
SPEAKER_04: good fighter well listen you have nothing to worry about erm he's nothing to worry about oh yeah no problem no problem the only thing that i would like to see is i'd like to see you try not to cry too much no my friend not too much
SPEAKER_04: No, no, no. He already prepared everything. Look at that. Because he wants to cheat in the set-up.
SPEAKER_04: Please, don't lose for fouls, please. You don't have to cry. Devon't lose the match for fouls. I just don't want to. It'll break my heart if I see you start to cry. If you want to cheat like a kid to have the victory, if you want to cheat, I don't compete. Because I'm a professional wrestler and I want to pull with professional wrestlers. You're so strong. You don't have to cry.

SPEAKER_04: no no no show you you don't know what i can see i show everything i show everything me too my friend no you show just 92 kilo back pressure that was a long time ago but the angle 92 kilo back pressure the angle is too low 45 degree angle no good no good yeah very good no it's good it's good but i just want to see 90 degrees
SPEAKER_04: 90 degrees, you can use your back. Lewand, this is a super check for you. Lewand, this is a super check for you. With 90, you can use your back like this. It's easier for me, I think. I don't want to see 45 degrees. I want to see it pulling straight into your arm. But I will repeat.
SPEAKER_04: If it's 90 degrees, you can pull with your back too. You understand? No. Yeah, yeah. If the cable is low, you can't use your back because you can't use only your bicep like this. No, you can use your back the same way. We have the teacher here, hanging.
SPEAKER_04: What? He thinks it's easier with a low cable. Oh, it is. It is when you're... I mean, if the cable is this way, it is harder than when it is coming here. When it is harder. But sometimes they use his back like this.
SPEAKER_01: if there are 90 degrees i mean it doesn't matter you know it's already very hard you know the 90 kilo 92 kilo it doesn't matter if it's coming from down or something it's very very hard and even the guys who are lifting directly from the floor they never like lift like this but they usually go a little bit like under and then lift it i'm not talking about devon's lift but usually the guys are going so the the weight is actually coming like
SPEAKER_01: This, you understand? Yeah. Sort of like you did with your 92. A little bit like that. I did the same, man. That's why I'd like to see you do it again. Just to know. Forget about lifting, you know. Who's going to win the match? This is not lifting competition. Levan, this is super chat for you.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, first of all, Dustin B. Engin, thank you for everything that you do for the fans. You are more than welcome, and thank you for your support. And as of now, there is 2,200 people watching this live. It just shows that arm wrestling is growing, growing and growing, and you guys are superstars. Okay, J.R. Williams, for Levan, who cheats more, Devon or Ermes? Levan. There's a super chat.
SPEAKER_04: Who cheat more? Yeah. Who is cheating more? Levan? Devon or Ermes? What does it mean? Cheating means taking advantage. Who fights more? Who fights better? It doesn't mean that. Now, who cries more? Who cries more?
SPEAKER_04: Lavan, who is cheating more first, and then you answer the next one. Who is crying more? Okay, Lavan, who is cheating more? I'm afraid. Why you have to think? There are no time to think about this. He's the best of the best, him to cheat. Look, he's the best of the best, the whole time.
SPEAKER_04: I've changed my way. Ermes, I've changed my ways. I'm a new man. What is your weight now? Nice. Light. I'm light. He is 122 kilos probably. I'm light. Only? I'm quite light. Look, I have sweater. See this? I have sweater. I have pants.
SPEAKER_01: Minimum, there are three kilo of shoes. How do I switch this? But if he doesn't have shoes, I don't think it's three kilo. With shoes, maybe three kilo. It's or never. Can you see? I don't see. 272. Torment.
SPEAKER_01: okay so he is like around 120 kilo without clothes and like food 150 kilo you are 115 20. little no no it's not terrible you need 10 more 10.
SPEAKER_01: How much does he eat? 120 kilos. He's now 124 or something. But the clothes on him and the food he ate since morning. So, Ermes, you don't have to worry. You don't have to cry. Easy. Easy day. No problem. No cry. Easy. Everything easy. I have a question for Levan. When they did the interview with you in Istanbul, Levan,
SPEAKER_01: You said that it is 50-50 match, but maybe a little bit to Devon's side. And what was the reason? He was dragged, my friend. He was dragged. Die, my friend. Okay. Devon, were you drunk when you said that Devon has a little bit more chance? Were you drunk? No, no.
SPEAKER_03: So why do you think Devon has more chance? What's the reason? It is because you think Devon has a little bit stronger risk or? No, no, I think Devon has more or a little bit more strong his psychology. Oh, okay.
SPEAKER_04: because army is crying when you have the power inside your arm there are no game and psychology game my friend no no no because i will cry and with the psychology we go down zero game do you remember my good friend matt mask yeah yeah oh can you hear me help can you hear me
SPEAKER_04: We hear you, but you're... Can you hear me? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yes. Ermes, do you know my good friend Matt Mask? Yeah, he's my friend too. Do you know what I always do when he loses? One year more. One more year. No, no, no, no. He says that if somebody beats Matt Mask,
SPEAKER_01: Devon comes for revenge and he beats the guy who beat Matt Mask. So he beat Sandris, Sandris beat Matt Mask, he beat Sandris. Prudnyk beat Matt Mask and then he beat Prudnyk. And yesterday Kalnyshenko beat Matt Mask and then he took with the left arm. So he says that you also beat Matt Mask and now it's time for you to also lose.
SPEAKER_04: Completely different story, my friend. He don't understand what is the reality. He don't understand. And he don't know. But he will see. You know, every single time he loses, I have to go and beat that person. Me too. Me no, my friend. You too. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: I will put you in the reality, in reality era. Wake up to reality. Yeah, you will, you wake up and you will see the reality. But Ermes, what happens if you lose? I don't care. You don't? No. What to say?
SPEAKER_04: Something's going to happen. Only 1%. 1% you have. 1%. And if you will be angry more, we will go down 0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.3, 2, 1, 0. It's only about you. If you want more chance to win with me,
SPEAKER_04: It's better not to cheat or to speak something bad about me. I will destroy you. This is a good way for you. When I crack your wrist back, I will not pin you.

SPEAKER_04: Your mind is not very... Devon, there is a question. Ermes. Ermes, Parmesan cheese drug dealer. Devon, you were crying against Gennady. What are you talking about? What are you talking about crying? If you want to know crying, just watch Ermes in the setup of every single match. It's just cry, cry, cry, cry. We are professional. We are professional, my friend. Not in the circus.
SPEAKER_01: We need to have good rules, good fight, like professional wrestlers. Do you guys know how many people watching right now? 3,100.
SPEAKER_01: Is that a lot? Yeah, 3,000 people. Can you ask Levan, which wrist was more easy to bend? Levan, whose wrist was more easy? Levan's wrist was more easy, Ermes' wrist was more easy to take when you bent? The question is very...
SPEAKER_03: you don't want to upset you don't want to upset anyone both are already strong strong wrists but i think a little bit uh that one that one wrist is stronger or ermine but irma's you left up so much way yeah maybe yes maybe yes
SPEAKER_01: Say again, Levan. But after my match with Ermes, I think Ermes now more stronger. Oh, you are saying that he got stronger right now? Since that time? Is this your opinion? Yeah. Do you think that Devon also is getting stronger after those stem cells? Yes, yes. I think they both are getting stronger, right? Yeah. Ermes, you better be ready.
SPEAKER_01: You better be ready, Ermias. You better be ready. Last 20 minutes. Hey, Devon, I have been rooting for you since 08. If you win this match, would you like to rematch Lebanese again or go straight for Deniz? What do you mean Lebanese? You mean Levan? You mean?
SPEAKER_04: um i think for me we give levon as much time as he wants levon gets as much time as he wants but there's two matches that i very much want after i destroy ermys yeah dennis and
SPEAKER_01: i want the light heavyweight belt from kurti galley oh yeah that's good you are you are listen listen i will tell you something like i i love the mind you have that is like that crazy that the boundless boundless that you want to do that that anything that possible to reach it doesn't mean that you're gonna like be successful but but even to like fight for it is just like great you know huge respect

SPEAKER_04: hey it's a foul it's gonna stop he's gonna quit he's gonna be complaining so much he's not even gonna fight and then i'm gonna pin and he's gonna be crying that something happened that didn't happen and i win i win and then i never pin him i never pin him not one time do i pin him he just cries so much that he loses and fouls each time
SPEAKER_04: you will hold him and then as the rounds go on I get stronger so strong that instead of just taking his hand I take camera in the hook in the first time the first match camera in the hook
SPEAKER_04: You come. You come. Yeah, you come in the hook. You want? You want to go inside first round? OK. You come in, I go in. First round, right in the hook. Yeah. No, no, but Ermes, he says that you also need to go hook. Not like this, but you also go inside. Side pressure. Yeah. You hook me, I hook you. Yeah. Together. Together. Together.
SPEAKER_04: trust me army trust me yeah yeah together no problem um and you how do you see the mesh don't move go jerry jerry replay of jerry no no like jerry no please
SPEAKER_04: only change only one thing changes will change the face you put the facial or Jerry or they were same same fight you know Ermes I would have done even worse to Jerry than you did because the way that you beat Ermes the way you beat Jerry was fast and a little bit like you were scared
SPEAKER_04: you know you did it so quick you didn't want to you didn't want to give me if i pulled jerry i stop him and i laugh at him
SPEAKER_04: he had to he had to win quick so he could face you he didn't want any kind no he didn't look it he didn't have to do anything he did it because he was a little bit scared a little bit scared he thought he was worried that if the match stops he would lose me
SPEAKER_04: i pulled jerry bang i even give and take i don't care i don't worry about anything with jerry nothing nothing maybe he will beat you you don't know
SPEAKER_04: No. Hey, I beat Jerry in 2018. Yeah, but now he's very strong. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
SPEAKER_04: My friend, there are the cards. Jerry, he won with Gennady. Me, I won with Gennady. And you lose with Gennady. This is the reality. You remember when we spoke together in the King of the Table 2?
SPEAKER_04: Remember? And you told me you will lose with Gennady tomorrow. And now, my friend, you lost with Gennady. But that's because I like Gennady. I like Gennady. And you, you're a bit scared. And I don't know if I like that. Gennady, big heart, very brave. You may be a little bit scared the way you have to cry to the referee all the time.
SPEAKER_01: no my friend okay flying ryan easy day for canada no limits exactly exactly easy day oh look look where i am look at this oh you told me that you stopped right like lifting heavier this is now easier i still lift a little bit
SPEAKER_04: it's easy though no problem i'm so that the problem is i keep getting stronger so i have to still lift if i'm getting stronger i have to keep getting stronger you know i can't stop lifting weight if it's so light everything's so light from you ever felt like that where everything you touch feels like nothing do you understand no
SPEAKER_04: Like he is so strong that everything he holds, he feels like, you know, very light. It doesn't matter if it is normally heavy. Now it feels very light because he's super strong. Yeah, it's normal. He lift only 60 kilos. It's normal. Show video. Show video. I want to see you, my friend. I want to see you. Before Levan fight. No. Yeah, you show.
SPEAKER_04: Ermes, is it true that you have small hands? No, it's not true. Because I was talking to people yesterday and they were your good friends and they said you had small hands. The fingers look a bit thin.
SPEAKER_04: Like I steal my finger. The fingers look a bit... It's like I steal. Almost like little pencils. Like little pencils. I will go inside your hand with my finger, like this. You feel pain in your hand. Pencil fingers. Pencil fingers. Levan, I have the same question for you. Devon't move. Go. Now what's happening? Round one. Oh.
SPEAKER_03: King move. Here is two variants. Okay, tell us. One is Ermes win very fast. And the second is Devon stop Ermes and Devon take Ermes wrist. But can Ermes do this possible or not? With Devon?
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, we did. Well, my friend, really you think my wrist is very weak? No, I think it's very strong, but somehow it keeps on popping backwards. I don't understand. The last two years never happened.
SPEAKER_04: My friend Levan, he broke your bicep and your wrist, everything. Levan is not normal like other guys. What about Alex Krdecha? Yes, three years ago. You think I'm the same guy? What about even Matt?
SPEAKER_04: is good yeah if you feel you think i'm the same guy what about dave chafee yeah prac but my arm would never open it my friend if your arm opens anywhere near that much with me you will lose no oh yeah no no if your arm doesn't move all the way towards you
SPEAKER_04: you will lose but you think you have more endurance than me oh this is a good question no really you you you think you have more endurance armies it's not about endurance it's not about endurance the power i have more you shade i have more power okay if your arm moves towards me i will out arm wrestle you a thousand ways
SPEAKER_04: uh because you have more endurance than me no because because you will have fallen into one of my traps if the match stops it's because i have tricked you somehow yeah that'll be what happened and you will not recover you won't you better hope actually the thing is is no matter what i know that i'm beating you there i know that i will no matter how much you cry
SPEAKER_04: I will beat you there. And then it's just a matter of how fast you can pin me. But every second it goes further, the more it comes to me. Ermes, you know this is true. I hope that you show up healthy. I hope you're rested. Ermes, I'm in a very good shape. Very good. Me too.
SPEAKER_01: Me too, good shape. Thank you. Five rounds. Yeah, full five rounds. But Devon is thinking that after one round, Ermes will just quit. He will not just go for five rounds. This is what Devon says. Okay, I have a question. If any of you win the match three rounds before five rounds, do you promise that you will continue till the five rounds?
SPEAKER_01: Oh yeah. 100%. Evgeny if you lose, you will still continue, right? The next last two rounds. 100%. 100%. And you, Ermes, if you lose, you will continue? Yeah, yeah. If everything is good, yes. What do you mean everything is good? Like if you are healthy, right? No injury. Yeah, yeah, yeah. As long as he's not injured. He's worried he's going to be injured. And he says if he's injured, he won't be able to do round four and five. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: That's what he said. My friend, don't talk too much. It will be 3-0 easy. And after this, we play with you, the hook, with Ruiz, the same pronation, with a little bit of cap. And then we finish like this. You think so? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I have respect for you, but you are too much older than me. But what happened with Dave?
SPEAKER_04: Why? Why did Dave almost beat you? What happened? I'm so confused. I don't understand. If you fought with Dave at the same time like me, you never win. You think so? Yeah. Really? Really. Oh, no. Maybe with Kim Hoover, maybe. No, no, no, no, no, no. Peggy.
SPEAKER_04: uh keep up from my he he think there is too much strong this wrist super strong he will open my wrist yeah if you are like strong like these you know don't need a king move or not maybe i like the king's move you you're not worried about the king's move are you
SPEAKER_04: I already broke the key move, my friend. When? When did you break the key move? We had this conversation. We had this conversation. Then he's going to say Michael, and then he's going to ask you who won this match, and you're going to say Michael won? Yeah, yeah. Michael won the match. How did you break it when he won? I won two rounds. And he won four. What? He won the match. Michael won that match. He won?
SPEAKER_04: but now i'm 50 percent more stronger than before yeah but michael is like down here yeah michael i destroy michael if i will go in the press nobody can't stop oh knocking move no nothing really please don't hold too much i don't want to broke something please
SPEAKER_04: don't hold too much if you feel pain quit quit immediately because very really i have too much respect for you oh no lord maybe no maybe we can happen something i don't know it's okay hermes listen okay i would like you to break me please if you can yeah
SPEAKER_04: i will push i will push and if something break it's okay it's okay i'm happy i want you to actually try your very hardest to break it i will push 100 oh break it break i will break it if you break it i might not even get it fixed that's how happy just leave it broken
SPEAKER_01: happy if you break happy if you break it happy happy yes this guy is a little bit psychopath and you are threatening him with breaking the guy is gonna say okay go break him like do you think that he would be scared the guy is just psychopath i am too people people think i'm psychopath yeah i am and you are a little bit too endless we all have but you are young when you come to our age you will be more psychopaths
SPEAKER_04: The reason why arm wrestle is because I want somebody to break my arm. I want somebody to. You know, when I arm wrestled LeVon, round two, he broke my bicep. And the rest of the rounds, I tried to get him to break my arm. I tried. I tried to go in and have him break my arm, but it wouldn't break. But maybe, maybe you will break it. Maybe. Maybe. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: happy day happy day yeah guys only only three minutes left i will read the super chest and then because i don't want to disrespect anyone uh austin barakzai can we make round four and five for devon's title they are asking if you want to pull the round four and five for your other title
SPEAKER_01: Would you put other title? But I mean, it is 115 kilo title. Why would you put the 115 kilo title, you know, for that much? Yeah. And okay. And then let me read. Do you guys know how many people there are online? 3,933 people. Like, it's like, like, like a joke, you know? How is it possible? What? How much record? I don't know. I never seen something like this. Almost 4,000 people right now online watching this. Levan.
SPEAKER_01: Levan, when will you be back? What? When will you be back? When will you compete again? I think next year. Next year? Yes. Next year, April, March, like this. Flying Ryan, Ermes, don't be scared. 3-0, no limits.
SPEAKER_04: Devon't be scared. Devon't be scared. Listen, armies, you don't have to worry about anything. You're so strong. You're so strong. I know. So strong. I know you don't, you don't have to worry. You don't have to cry. You don't have to know my friend. Everything's okay. Stay calm. Relax. It's going to be okay. It's going to be okay. No matter.
SPEAKER_04: even if you lose armies you're still champion you're still a good guy even if you lose it's okay you too oh yeah yeah this question is for your family guy like do you see devon stopping hermes
SPEAKER_01: what do you see like Devon is stopping Ermes do you think it's possible they are asking super chat is it possible uh Devon to stop Ermes oh yes I think it is possible it's possible it's possible everything is possible everything is possible Levan yes this is
SPEAKER_01: Big match, big. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't understand like how some people, you know, when you said that like it is a 50-50 match and you said maybe Devon has a little bit more chance. People said that, oh, Levan is trying to make the match look exciting or something, you know, but it is just like, it's not possible to underestimate Devon. Like if Devon gets his position, he's a very dangerous guy. So the question is,
SPEAKER_01: Either Ermes is going to just dominate him or Devon is going to stop Ermes. And then if Devon stops Ermes, it totally depends where he stops. If it is that close to the pimpet and if Ermes switches to the shoulder pressure so quick, he can still win. But if it is so much above and if it is center, not sure if Ermes can do that. We don't know. Maybe Ermes is going to top roll Devon. We don't know. Anything can happen. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: I can say one for... Devon is dangerous guy. Yes, yes, yes, dangerous. And Devon is dangerous here as well. Here, his heart and physically, he's very dangerous guy. He's very fast, very strong now and amazing shape now. But Devon is very dangerous. Yeah, but Ermes is dangerous too. I mean, I mean...
SPEAKER_01: you know how it is you know the guy is just okay this question trip war if levan bet hundred thousand dollars somebody giving you a hundred thousand dollars but that money is not yours you're gonna use this money to bet on either devon or ermis and if you bet right the money will be yours where are you betting this money oh
SPEAKER_01: Okay. Listen, 50,000 there, 50,000 there and 50,000 there. Yeah. How many I can win if I bet on Ermes or on Devon? I don't know. I really don't know. Just imagine that part because it's not my question. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: I think on Ermes, I bet on Ermes. Yeah, but only two weeks ago you said it was 50-50, you thought it was merchants. Now it's changing. When on money, I go on Ermes because he's young, he's fast. Hey, money is very important. Red Bernie, pasta versus pancakes. Very dangerous.
SPEAKER_04: they won't don't worry about no no everything's okay okay don't don't go too bad and shy no no and listen and and be happy we have to cry we really have some uh watch some movies
SPEAKER_04: We go in for some bull fighting or some chicken fighting or some dog fighting. See, the dogs don't complain. The chickens don't cry. The bull, it doesn't try and, you know, appeal to the crowd. It fights. It's okay. The crowd can't save you. The referee can't save you. You and me. You and me. Just you and me. You and me, man.
SPEAKER_03: Red Bernie, pasta versus pancakes. You cut your hair or not? You go like this? I think so. I think I cut it. Yeah. No, no, no. This is good, I think. We'll see. We'll see. I mean, big match. Big match. Yeah. Once again, Red Bernie, pasta versus pancakes. Let's go. So do you guys want to have some...
SPEAKER_01: pancake and pasta competition, or you just both cook and then the other athletes decide, you know, who is cooking better. Do you have any kind of challenge, Devon, about this, or you are not that good at it? I'm cooking all the time now. I'm cooking. I can cook. Yeah. Yeah. And then... I'll make a special dish for Ermi's. Just for Ermi's. Special dish.
SPEAKER_01: Ermes, would you eat the food the devil is making? Something special in it. I know, I will be very attentive about this, my friend. Okay, and then, okay, let us stop in Ermes, and then I think one last super chat, and then we finish.
SPEAKER_01: And then I asked you the last one, because I saw one more. The chat moves one second. I'm coming there. Devon't worry about this. Everything will be fine. Everything will be fair. Okay. This is Russell Tyrone Jones, Devon versus Ermes. My two favorites guys going at it. I have 60, 40 for Ermes, but wouldn't be surprised if Devon stops him.
SPEAKER_01: Hoping for a war. Thanks Engin, Devon and Ermes. And I had also Levan. Yeah. Okay, so guys, the last words from you guys. Levan, do you have anything to say to these two superstars? Good luck.
SPEAKER_03: It is a match. I know it is a very big match. And I want to say good fight. And I know I say good fight. Because two big athletes in the world will fight. Levan, is there any chance for Ermes to win if Devon stops him?
SPEAKER_03: Oh, I want to see that. I want ... I know MS can fast win, but for people it is not good, I think. Only ... yes, I want to see maybe slowly much, not very fast.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but Ermes doesn't plan that. I don't think Ermes is planning that. Yes, I know. No, the fourth and the fifth match, yes. Oh, okay. After 3-0, 3-0 and 4 and 5, you will just let him do whatever he wants. Yeah. Yeah. And Devon, your last words? Oh, yeah. Sorry, sorry, Devon. You were saying something. And I'm very interested. Why Devon coming back?
SPEAKER_01: now in Istanbul. It is question. Why? So the reason why I'm coming to Istanbul early is because my son, Aden, is going to get trained by Engin. So we come early. Oh, it is cool. Yeah. When Devon came here for the Gennady match, before the match, we were sitting and eating and he asked me if he would come with his son
SPEAKER_01: it would be okay to be trained together. And I said, yeah. There was a YouTube. Yeah, he doesn't need anything. I will, I'll be watching. Yeah. Okay, one second, Levan. What did you mean by asking the question? What? What did you mean by asking the question that why Devon was coming early?
SPEAKER_03: Yes, because it is so far for much. Yeah, yeah. Okay. And what did you think about it? Why did you think that he was coming early? I think maybe he coming that because time for... Oh, for the jet lag and to get used to? Yes, yes. Okay. Maybe like that. Yes.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, Jeremy Coleman, Ermes, I emailed you about a potential sponsorship, so please respond. A big group of grace, love you guys. Thank you, Jeremy, thank you. Jeremy and those guys need to answer me soon because we need to do the backdrops and everything, t-shirts and everything soon. And Devon, or maybe before you, Ermes, what are your last words?
SPEAKER_04: Good luck for Devon. And do not do resistance so you don't have to break his arm. Yes. My friend, what is it? What is it? Look. What is it, my friend? Look at this. Look at the power, my friend.
SPEAKER_04: small hands small hand small hand listen levin don't be intimidated because whenever i measure his bicep and his forearm they are smaller than what he says that's normal that's normal for for people like yeah good luck i hope
SPEAKER_04: I hope we don't cry too much. Because I think we cry and need some paper to... Maybe... And that's it. Lewon, did you say something? Maybe they cry together.
SPEAKER_04: So I have recently learned the importance of consent. Consent is a very important thing. And so before we have our match, I'll tell you, Ermes, you can. I want you if you can. I want you to completely kill and break me if you can on that table. It's OK. It's OK. You can. I will be happy if you do. Thank you. Thank you. I will be happy. You will make me feel good if you completely destroy me.
