Engin Terzi: what their level was in their previous fights. Vitalii train hard lately. We might see a much better shape of him. I'm sure. I'm sure they know what to do. I have seen very old footage, maybe like seven years ago, whatever, you know, where Vitalii was beating Revaz, either European or World Championships, but I don't exactly remember. Revaz' weight, we can ask my friend when he comes. As of now, I don't know his current weight.

Back-to-back two months like this. Hello, Revaz. Hello, hello, my friend. Big Giants, yeah. Revaz, shenich marwismis. Revaz, shenich marwismis.
Roman: I told Revaz to fix his audio. Can you ask Vitalii how he has been? He has been fine. Hello, Revaz. Hello, hello, . He's asking how we're doing, guys. .
Roman: Vitalii, can you turn your phone sideways and you, Revaz, as well? Revaz, can you turn your phone sideways and you, Revaz, as well? Revaz, can you turn your phone sideways and you, Revaz, as well? Revaz, can you turn your phone sideways and you, Revaz, as well? Revaz, can you turn your phone sideways and you, Revaz, as well?

Revaz, can
Roman: Vitalii, can you deactivate the portrait mode and the landscape mode, the horizontal mode? Where should I put it? It's when you enter the settings. Well, not there, but the settings, how do you say it, somewhere in the corner...
Roman: Remus is trolling. He's saying that it's good Vitalii lived like this. It's okay. Let him stay like this. It's okay. No problem. Yeah, yeah. Thank you. Thank you. So can you ask him how he has been?
Vitalii Laletin: So first I will ask Vitalii. Vitalii Engin, you are being asked about your training, your form, how you are doing. Well, it's all good. The form is good. It doesn't differ much from the form I had when I came to Turkey, because the form doesn't change quickly. Everything changes over time.
Roman: He said that obviously he didn't gain that much significant power and got better in such small terms. By time, you don't get that much better in such a short time. But he said that most importantly is that his injury is no problem, no issue anymore. He's healthy now. Can you ask him his weight?
Roman: He's saying 136 kg right now. 136 kg, okay. And can you ask also Revaz about his weight and how he... 127 he's saying. How many? 125 now. 25, so he's losing weight. It's because too hard, right?
Roman: I think he will show up 150. 150? Yes. 150, Vitalii. 150. He will show up.
Engin Terzi: He said it's okay, no problem. Vitalii said, yeah. 150, yeah, okay. And Revaz and Vitalii, they met. I saw a video. Can you ask him? He was in WAF or European some years ago, where Vitalii won. Vitalii was in WAF. When he was there, he was there, he was there, he was there, he was there, he was there, he was there, he was there, he was there, he was there, he was there, he was there, he was there, he was there, he was there,
Roman: He's saying that there was a competition in Poland, if he's not mistaken, back then when he was competing, they both were competing 110 kg.
Roman: And he said that their match was prior to the finals and none of them had lost before. And then Vitalii beat him back then. He didn't say a year, so I don't know which year he's talking about. Yeah. Can you ask Levan? Does he remember this?
Roman: Vitalii, he talked about your match in Poland, when you won a rematch in the 110kg category. Do you remember that?
Vitalii Laletin: No, I don't remember us fighting with Rivas at all. I remember him in 2014, he came to the competition and we were just standing at the table. And I don't remember me winning or fighting with him. Officially, no matches, right? Yes, I didn't have any matches. I don't know, maybe he's confusing me with someone.
Roman: uh uh he's saying that he doesn't remember doesn't uh recall any type of match between them officially he remembers that um one two 2014 uh they met each other but uh like side table they did some uh like practice or something but officially vitale says that he doesn't remember any match with no he doesn't remember but i saw the video is remember that he beat me yeah
Roman: He said that maybe I don't remember because it was way too easy for me. It was like nothing. Translate. Does Revaz understand Ruslan? I will translate.
Engin Terzi: he said that he got what leon said yeah he understood you understand yeah okay he's only laughing about it just tell tell are we gonna see something different this time
Roman: Nothing special that much he's planning for Vitalii. He's going to just remind about the past that they had this experience. So I don't know, maybe he's planning some surprise. I don't know. He said nothing special. He will just remind him past times. Okay, I understand.
Roman: And can you ask Vitalii how does he see his chances against Rivas? Vitalii, in your opinion, what would you say about the match against Rivas? Do you think you are a favourite, or Rivas, or 50-50?
Vitalii Laletin: I've never considered anything in this situation. I know that Rivas is a very strong opponent. I can't be sure that I will be stronger or he will be stronger. The table will show, and everyone will see. You can't discuss anything in advance, because he is clearly stronger. OK, I see.
Roman: Whatever Vitalii said, Rivas said, thank you. I will translate. So I asked, what do you think? Like this word and Vitalii said that he doesn't think anything about matches prior to the matches. He's just saying the facts. Like he's saying that it's evidently that Rivas is very strong. It's a strong human being. He's saying that prior to the matches, he cannot say how will it be. He says that table will show when they whip up.
Roman: So he cannot just predict, I'm going to beat easy or Revaz will be beating me easy or 50-50. He didn't say anything about that. Yeah, but he's coming to win, right? He's coming to win. He's just confident about that, you know, like he wouldn't come, right? He's not coming with the doubts that I may lose or something, right? Like he's coming. Well, Engin still asked if you come to win, right? Are you self-confident?
Vitalii Laletin: I'm going to try. I'm not self-confident. I've never been self-confident. I'm going to try. I saw how Rivas fought Sheikhi. And it was clear that Rivas was stronger. Although a year ago I fought Sheikhi and it was hard for me to fight him. So let's see how much I've gained in a year. In what shape was Sheikhi. Let's see what shape Rivas will be.
Roman: so yes um he said he's not that much confident he's never he's just anticipating the matches obviously he's coming for the victory he said he uh he mentioned dave chafee's match reference uh with him and dave versus uh revas he said he compared those two matches he said that i had uh
Roman: prior to Revaz versus Dave Chaffee, I had my match versus Dave Chaffee and I was like, it was not that easy for me, it was hard for me, but on the other hand, Revaz was like level above Dave Chaffee, it appeared so, and then he also said that
Roman: It also depends what type of shape Dave Chaffee was against me and against Rivas, what type of form is Rivas right now. And also he lastly said, it also depends how much I gained after that match.
Engin Terzi: So he's just anticipating his summer for Viktor. But does he know how much he got better since that match because he had the shoulder issues. Now he says that he is totally healthy. And can you ask him how like to compare his shape against Dave Sheffy and today? Okay, Vitalii, but still, if possible,
Vitalii Laletin: Tell us about your progress after your fight with Dave Chaffee. My biggest progress is that I managed to heal my injuries, which worried me. And I hope for a good fight. We will have a good fight, we will have a good fight with straight arms and shoulders. Then we will fight well.
Vitalii Laletin: Okay, so yes, he said
Roman: main thing main progress that he did during this time is to make sure that he go to healthy and recover from this injury completely that was his main major progression so to say then he said that he wishes for the um good um referees like he said that uh he wishes that their match him versus was will be left
Roman: like accurately he's saying that he's wishing that there would be like fair grips uh like fair elbows everything you know in order let's say and he also said then i asked i i re-asked if he could give us some percentage wise or something about his progression he said that he could not measure that percentage right now he could not say that because he was trying to not risk his injury and he said that the majority of his like uh like if he said that 80 of the weights
Roman: uh only pulled like he did not went up to the uh 100 percent that he could okay okay okay only only only curled and only worked with 80 percent of weight so he cannot say how much he gained percent you know he wanted to stay injury free yeah so let's let's go to Revaz when I invited first time Revaz he was talking about him being 20 percent and next time we asked him
Engin Terzi: then i think 80 i don't remember exactly but yeah he didn't say 80 during morose of the the i tried to ask i remember he did not specify a percentage there so i will ask current percentage right yeah yeah just ask him like where is he at now is he finally very near to his uh potential limits
Roman: Okay. Rezo, it's your turn now. The story is that from the beginning, 20% of the population had 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 42, 43, 44, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 51, 52, 52, 53, 52, 53, 52, 53, 52, 53, 53, 54, 53, 54, 53, 54, 53, 53, 54, 53, 54, 53, 53, 54, 53, 53, 54, 53, 53, 54, 53, 53, 54, 53, 53, 53, 53, 53, 53, 53, 53, 53, 53, 53, 53, 53, 53, 53
Roman: He's joking right now. He's saying that he still has not reached his 100%. He's like lacking around 40 to 55%. He's crazy. He's joking. Tell him to take me seriously or I will not take him seriously either.
Revaz Lutidze: Okay, Rezu, if you say so, I'll say it too, and I won't take it too seriously. No, no, it's a good idea. I don't think it's going to happen. I don't know what's going to happen, and I don't think...
Revaz Lutidze: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Roman: So seriously speaking, he said that he's still not 100%. He believes that he still can progress. And before this, he was more like as if somebody got kicked in his head and he was just like disoriented in the armwrestling manner. He said that now he's getting his head straight and he knows where he is in armwrestling shape speaking.
Roman: And he said that coming from this, I believe I can still progress. So that's why he's saying 100%. Yeah, yeah. Is it even better than the time that he pulled against Dave Sheffield? He's saying yes, for sure.
Roman: he said that for sure he would be even better shape than he was against dave he said that also the major role that played about this answer he said is that um the way he performed against the hf he didn't even get any injuries it was like relatively easy so to say so he had enough time to progress from that point as well yeah and is he gonna beat is he gonna be managing
Revaz Lutidze: So, Anu, how do you think about all of this? Well, it's all in my mind. That's why I wanted to talk about it. It's all in my mind. It's all in my mind. It's all in my mind. It's all in my mind. It's all in my mind.
Roman: He's saying he's always coming for the victory. He said that even if it was him versus his brothers, he said he has two brothers, he would pull them for the victory both simultaneously because of the mindset, he always comes for the victory.
Roman: And he said that also, obviously, the table will show in what form they will both pull, but so to say, he's ready to beat Vitalii. Yeah, I mean, this is normal. Just as a promoter, I wanted to hear this. I will quickly also tell Vitalii what he said. Yeah, yeah, just tell him. Vitalii, I will translate what Revaz said.
Roman: He said that...
Roman: He is even stronger than he was in the match vs Dave Chaffee. And he will try his best to win. But of course he knows how strong you are. And he will try his best to win. It won't be easy.
Engin Terzi: I guess we thought. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. I understand. Um, can you, can you ask both Vitalii and Revaz, have they seen any time in their career when all the top athletes are competing against each other this often, like freakingly and with, with, you know, this level.
Roman: From the East to the West all together. First I will ask Vitalii. Vitalii, Engin asks about East vs West and he says that if you ever
Roman: I saw that armwrestlers, top armwrestlers, played more often against themselves. Top athletes played more often. What do you think,
Roman: I'm talking about the Supermatch format. You mean the Supermatch format?
Roman: He means that these top armwrestlers will be competing more and more often in the future. He's asking about your opinion. What do you think? Is it good? Is it progress for armwrestling? Of course, it's progress. Moreover, Wingin has a very good feeling. He chooses pairs very well.
Vitalii Laletin: who fight and in principle in every fight there are such long fights, very interesting for people, that's why they watch. Thanks to him, such fights take place and a lot of viewers are going to watch and discuss after the competition. They discuss the fights for a long time. I think this is all right, the direction is going and everything is cool.
Roman: um he said that um obviously this is very good for arm wrestling this is like a progress for arm wrestling he said that what we've seen so far so many athletes been uh competing uh top athletes competing um people are still months after the matches are talking about it so it's really uh helpful for the community they are gathering people are more and more people are gathering to watch the uh
Roman: matches and this competition so he's saying that the more engine he's doing it's uh it's it goes to the right direction he said that it's it's better because so so many matches are still talked about many many times by many many people so it's it's all good for arms that's what he said yeah that's good yeah and and can you ask the same question to ravaz you know how does where does he see today our mercy
Revaz Lutidze: Rezo, do you have anything to add to what I was thinking about? I think it's very important, as I said before. It's very important. This is the moment.
Revaz Lutidze: I don't know if it's true or not, but the way I see it, the way I see it, the way I see it, the way I see it, the way I see it, the way I see it, the way I see it, the way I see it,
Revaz Lutidze: I think everyone will agree with this and think that they will agree. And with our efforts, with this kind of effort and with this kind of tournament, history will change. And I am sure that one day it will come to pass, as it has always been. And in the future,
Revaz Lutidze: This is what I wanted to say, and I hope you will see it. I hope you will join this organization, and you will be able to do something.
Revaz Lutidze: It's very... I don't know how to say it. It's very dark and it's very dark and it's very dark and it's very dark and it's very dark and it's very dark and it's very dark and it's very dark and it's very dark and it's very dark and it's very dark and it's very dark and it's very dark and it's very dark and it's very dark and it's very dark and it's very dark and it's very dark and it's very dark and it's very dark and it's very dark and it's very dark and it's very dark and it's very dark and it's very dark and it's very dark and it's very dark and it's very dark and it's very dark and it's very dark and it's very dark and it's very dark and it's very dark and it's very dark and it's very dark and it's very dark and it's very dark and it's very dark and it's very dark and it's very dark and it's very dark and it's very dark and it
Revaz Lutidze: I would like to say that I am convinced that everything is possible and everything is possible. There is no doubt that something is possible. Marto Chaudi was there, everything was possible.
Revaz Lutidze: Everything was done by the engineers and organizers, and it was easy for us to do it. And we were able to do it. And we were able to do it. And we were able to do it.
Roman: uh he as you can tell already uh he spoke a lot but mainly he was focused on his experience how how much good he finds uh this current situation in arm wrestling uh regarding on his door success maybe that was his major points he said that it's very good for uh not only uh
Roman: As him, as an armwrestler, but also as a community, as a fan of Armwrestling, it's a really good time. It's also very good for future generations, what we are, what you are doing, he said, like East versus West. He's saying that such matches and events and organizations can only get better from this point. And he said we have to all strive for that.
Roman: He also said that like, he went even in details, he said, like me as an armwrestler, basically I get invited and the organizers are doing just fine. They are saying that they are delivering everything. They are just inviting us so that we can fight. We have everything, we have hotels, we have all the hospitality. So he has never experienced such a thing. So that's why he's saying that these times,
Engin Terzi: It is good times for armwrestling, yeah. Yeah, just one thing, tell them very shortly and we continue. Tell them that, you know, I and they, we competed in the same events for many years in the WAP championships, European championships. I competed, they competed.
Engin Terzi: So I don't see myself as an organizer and those are athletes, but I see them as brothers in armless, just short to say, and then so that tell them that it will never change you, this will never change you.
Roman: The roots are the same, roots are the same. Vitalii, he said for you and also for Revaz, but I will speak in Ruslan, Revaz also understands. He said that he wanted it to be clear,
Roman: He doesn't think that he is the organizer and you are armwrestlers somewhere here. He says that he was also an armwrestler like you and like Rewaza and he and all three of you were at the competition together and he said that he sees it as
Roman: Like brothers in armwrestling, he said. And it will never change. He sees that you are all equal. He wanted it to be clear. So Revaz probably understands. Yes, yes, yes. Okay, let's go to, because they are not going to talk about their match so much.
Engin Terzi: They say, I come, I'm in good shape. We will see, you know, type of things, you know. So this kind of my tries don't really work on the Eastern Atlas, you know, so much that they're trying to steal the pot. It doesn't work, you know, because they are just like too much on their own way of culture.
Engin Terzi: Vitalii, what do you think about Ermes vs. Devon match?
Vitalii Laletin: I think the fight will be very interesting. Devon has been doing very well lately. He's got a good grip. I know that if Ermes gets stuck, it's going to be hard for him. It's going to be hard for Ermes, right?
Vitalii Laletin: He said that there could be two possible ways. He said in both arm wrestlers' favors, he said if
Roman: more if uh hermes is strong enough to just from the start explosiveness and the strength and the speed just to pin the one and then we cannot do anything about it obviously it can go all like this but on the other hand if some some some point of the uh match some some time devon manages to stop him and hold him the one is so incredibly uh endurable and the endurance endurance is so high or
Roman: He can just hold him like for a long, long time. And that will definitely be hard for Ermes from there to gain control over the match. So that's what he said. If they will manage it to somehow at some point stop the match, it will be very, very hard for Ermes to gain control. Does it matter where the match stops? Because Ermes also has this shoulder pressure. Can you ask him, does it matter where the match stops for Devon to have a chance?
Roman: Vitalii, he said it will play a role where Devon will stop Ermes. In this position or... I think Devon will stop him with a brush. And with a losing brush, Ermes will not be able to beat him, definitely.
Roman: Oh, he said that he thinks Devon actually will be taking Ermes' wrist and stopping him right there. He did not say that Devon will be losing position and Ermes losing the wrist. He said that Devon will take Ermes' wrist and Ermes from the lost wrist position would not be able to come back. So he's saying that at the center there's a possibility that Devon may take? Yes. We talked about two possibilities. One is the domination by Ermes.
Engin Terzi: and the second that devon stops him and then holds him can you ask him like which which is like more likely to happen yeah yeah yeah yeah um
Roman: What do you think about your option? You said that if Ermes is very dominant, he will win. You also said that if Devon wins, Devon will win. What do you think, who has a better chance? I think Devon is very smart.
Vitalii Laletin: Very experienced, very clever. I think he will use his wrist to meet him, because his wrist is longer. And he will try to open Ermes' wrist. Do you think that Ermes will not be a dominant? I don't think that he will be in one touch, in one movement. I think he won't be. It will be a very interesting, spectacular fight.
Roman: Yeah, he's saying that it will be a very sightful match, like a good match to watch, because he doesn't think it will go dominantly either way. He didn't say that. He said that it will be war, he said from the beginning,
Roman: uh of this of his last question he said that because of the how long leverage devon has uh he will be managing to go deep enough to catch uh hermes in the uh like this type of wrist position so that uh neutralize uh hermes's wrist so take control like win battle of the wrists basically he was saying he will either with domination
Engin Terzi: Or he's going to stop, Devon is going to stop and beat him. But whenever we ask which one is more possibility, and then he says that he doesn't believe that it will be domination, the match will stop. So he basically is saying that he thinks Devon is going to win.
Engin Terzi: um uh i can i can also ask that question to make sure what he thinks uh uh because the way that you explained you said that this is two possibilities but that's what he said yes he doesn't think that you know there will be a domination so he says that from outside look either dominating or down is winning but whenever it comes to his opinion he thinks that you know there will not be domination they will is gonna stop and win this is what i understand but you can okay i'll make sure to know his uh opinion
Roman: Vitalii, after what you said, Engi thinks that you say that Ermes will not be dominant and Devon will not be dominant either. It will not be a dominant match, it will be a real one, but Engi thinks that you said that Devon will control the match and win. You think that Devon is a favorite, right?
Vitalii Laletin: I can't say who's my favorite. I can see it from the start of the fight. I don't know who's the best. I've never fought Devon. If I fought Devon and Ermes, I'd say who's the best. It would be interesting.
Roman: Do you think Ermes will have a chance to dominate? I think Devon will open his wrist and Ermes will try to hold it with a slightly broken wrist. Okay, so yes. So I re-asked to make sure. He said that he doesn't have the best information about either guy's wrist, how strong their wrists are, so he cannot say, like,
Roman: 100% sure answer, but he said if he had match against Ermes and then match against Devon, he would say for sure. But it all depends which, whose has more stronger wrist. And then I re-ask, re-ask. So he said that he thinks eventually Devon will be taking Ermes' wrist and Ermes will be fighting from the losing wrist side. Losing wrist.
Roman: But he said that Ermes has a chance to win from that. I asked and he said that it will be a good match to look. Yeah. Okay. So can you ask the same question to Revaz? What he thinks about this match? Revaz, I'm very interested to know what you think about Ermes. Well, I don't know. I'm thinking about the details. I don't know if I'll be able to answer if I don't know. I'm thinking about it.
Revaz Lutidze: Well, they are top sportsmen, I think, and these two are in great shape, Devon and Ermes. And I think that Israel, if I'm not mistaken, will be in the top 50-50. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so.
Roman: He's saying it's unclear for him. Without going into too much details, it's hard for him to say clear victorious guy. Between these two, he's saying that it could be 50-50. It could go either way. So, there is a general opinion on the social media.
Engin Terzi: uh people are thinking that Ermes is clear favorite heavily favorite and these two athletes don't agree with that they say that it's a very close match they both they both yes yes can you can you ask him what was Gennady's shape when he pulled against Devon like how was was it was it like best Gennady he has ever seen because he knows him close at that time
Roman: Rezo, can you tell us about Gennady's way of living when he was a child? I know it's hard for you to say what he did in practice, but can you tell us what Gennady was like when he was a child?
Revaz Lutidze: I think that in the form of Avogadro, or in the form of Gennady Dimitrov, or in the form of Devon, or in the form of Zahan, or in the form of Zahan, or in the form of Zahan, or in the form of Zahan, or in the form of Zahan, or in the form of Zahan, or in the form of Zahan, or in the form of Zahan, or in the form of Zahan, or in the form of Zahan, or in the form of Zahan, or in the form of Zahan, or in the form of Zahan, or in the form of Zahan, or in the form of Zahan, or in the form of Zahan, or in the form of Zahan, or in the form of Zahan, or in the form of Zahan, or in the form of Zahan, or in the form of Zahan, or in the form of Zahan, or in the form of Zahan, or in the form of Zahan,
Roman: Roman, Roman, whenever I asked you Samushia, Samushia said that he has never seen him this strong. You remember? I remember, I was there, yeah, I remember what Samushia said. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, but what Revaz is saying is now, we asked one more time, he's saying that during that time-specific period, usually when he was going to the gym, Gennady was already done.
Roman: No, but they talk with each other, they talk with the other training partners. Yes, and based on that and also the lifts he saw Gennady was pulling and working with, he said that he assumed that Gennady was in his best performance shape. And was Revaz surprised that whenever the match started, the control of Devon,
Engin Terzi: Because everyone was thinking that Devon was going to be the one with the endurance and Gennady was going to be the one with the fourth power. But right from the ready-go, from the start, Devon kind of like took all the control. Was Rewa surprised to see Ruslan won? And then was he surprised to see how Devon controlled the center?
Roman: Prezo, let me tell you that when Gennady and Devon were together, everyone thought that Gennady would be a tough guy and Devon would be a tough guy.
Roman: And you said that you were convinced that in the first round Devon had a little bit of control over Gennady and he was going to dominate.
Engin Terzi: Sorry Revaz, did Revaz's respect as an armwrestler, as a performance, increase when he saw the strength right at the center? You mean respect towards Daewon? Yeah, he started to give him more credit after he saw that.
Roman: Oh, okay, good question. Yeah, tell him to answer all of them, yeah. Yeah, he's gonna answer, yeah. He's starting from the first question.
Revaz Lutidze: Gennady Upruchkoyan was one of my favorites. He was the one who dominated Devon and was the only one who could beat Devon. In the end, Gennady was the champion.
Revaz Lutidze: I think it's a good job, it's a good job, I don't think it's going to be a bad job, and I think it's going to be a good job, and I think it's going to be a good job, and I think it's going to be a good job, and I think it's going to be a good job, and I think it's going to be a good job, and I think it's going to be a good job, and I think it's going to be a good job,
Roman: He already answered the first question, but wanted to... Yeah, just say the first one because it is taking so long, the people are waiting. Regarding the first question, he said that
Roman: He believes the way he looks at that match, to recap, he's saying that it appears to him that Gennady played really smart and actually he used his brain to beat Debo. He said that he
Roman: doesn't reverse doesn't think that kennedy actually got dominated in the first round like it appeared he said that he thinks kennedy made sure that demon would think that way and he gave him the opportunity to take some control and fight from that position to get more exhausted
Roman: He's saying that Gennady did the same intentionally in the second round and eventually made Devon to work in the area where Gennady was willing to fight against Devon and that's why in advance endurance was on Gennady's side and got victorious. So he's saying that he did not think that it was that much dominant by Devon.
Roman: It was just all play of Gennady. And at some point, obviously, Devon also managed to gain some control, but it was all playing of Gennady. That's what appeared to him. Now I can ask the second question about the respect that you asked. I mean, can you ask him? Because you can ask the same question. I mean, the second question, but could Gennady not win in another way?
Roman: I would like to ask you a new question. Do you have any advice for those who want to become a singer, or do you have any advice for those who want to become a singer, or do you have any advice for those who want to become a singer, or do you have any advice for those who want to become a singer, or do you have any advice for those who want to become a singer, or do you have any advice for those who want to become a singer, or do you have any advice for those who want to become a singer, or do you have any advice for those who
Revaz Lutidze: And in the end, I think it's a very good thing. Because there is no such thing as a general strategy or something like that. And I think that if there was a dominant position, if there was no such thing, then I would say that there was nothing to do with it. And that's one thing.
Revaz Lutidze: I think that the Georgii will not be able to do it, because you are the only one in the whole country who has been able to do it, and you are the only one who will be able to do it. I don't know what to say, I don't know what to say, I don't know what to say, I don't know what to say, I don't know what to say, I don't know what to say, I don't know what to say.
Revaz Lutidze: So he answered both questions actually, your previous second question. He said that
Roman: To answer your last question, he cannot answer fully. He thinks that that's the question to Gennady to be asked and he can answer if there was any other way for Gennady to win. But based on his assumptions, Rivas' assumptions towards that match, he said that
Roman: If Devon was that much dominant in the first round and gained that much control, he could have done the same thing over and over and over again, and it would be even easier to just finish it. But evidently it was not the case, so that gives him the opportunity, gives Rivas this opportunity to think that it was played the way Gennady was planning to beat, because Gennady kept saying he would beat him in endurance, and he wanted Devon to go in hook.
Roman: So he still reiterated that he thinks Gennady did that intentionally so that he would beat Devon. And then about respect towards Devon, he said that he knows like, I mean, he said that after that match Devon came to him and came to Rivas, like came to the Georgii where Georgii were, and he said that
Roman: he really respects georgians like likewise mutual and said that he jokingly said that uh he would wish to have uh also like uh
Roman: georgian son or something so that this genetic in armless link would be also really good and powerful and he would call his son if he had ever georgian son he would call uh levan genadi or something like this it was obviously a joke from them he just remembers that how much devon respects georgians and he said he respects likewise
Engin Terzi: Yeah, yeah, that wasn't the respect I was talking about. I was talking about the respect, you know, about the abilities, not the strength. I mean, the ability, there is no question. But often, some of the Eastern guys underestimate Devon's strength, so that's what I was saying. Anyways, can you ask Vitalii, he knows very well Ibragim Sagov.
Engin Terzi: And he has been in the same events with Ibragim Sabo. And he obviously knows who Tata Sings is. And how does he see this match? Like, can you ask his opinion?
Roman: Vitalii, it's your turn. He asks you about Ibragim Sagov vs. Todd Hutchings. You know both armwrestling. What do you think about this match? Ibragim is in very good shape right now. And it's very difficult for the hookers to cope with him.
Vitalii Laletin: And as a top fighter, I was worried about our fight at the MSI when we fought him in an absolutely different category. Moreover, he was fresh, I was already tired. Well, I used my top technique against him, and he couldn't do anything. But again, I was able to do it. Not every top fighter can do it against a hooker. This is the first thing. And secondly, I say that he doesn't give a chance to hookers at all. And Ibragim Asakov is in very good shape now.
Roman: okay saying that um he knows obviously bragging he saying that against hook pullers um mr sago is actually um very very comfortable he is not gonna leave any chances uh in hookers he said that based on his experience they also had a pool and he said that he managed vitale managed to beat
Roman: Ibragim because of his top roller and stylistically top rollers can do better against Ibragim. But if match goes inside, that's where Ibragim wants it to go and he would welcome Todd Hutchings every time. He said he would not leave any chance to him because he will feel very comfortable there. Ibragim is in his best shape. Vitalii remembers Sagov's match against Zurab.
Roman: Vitalii, he's asking if you know Ibragim's match against Zurab. If it was now, they would have fought at the last tournament, where, unfortunately, Zurab broke his arm. Sagov would have fought for sure. Ok.
Roman: he said that yeah if uh did not get injury back like last time we saw and they fought against as a saga went him he thinks that taco would win because he would remember the previous time when they met
Roman: But Vitalii, he still asks you if you know how the competition took place between Zurab and Sagov. Not this AMC, but the previous AMC. How did they fight? The previous Sagov was very bad in preparation.
Vitalii Laletin: He was very tired. And they were fighting in the 95 kg category. And this time Asaka fought at 105 kg without losing weight. It was much easier for him. And those rivals with whom he fought hard in the 95 kg category, he won 105 kg when he was 105 kg.
Roman: He underlined the weight difference in this case of Sagov. One was 95, other one was 105, yeah. Yeah, and whenever he faced those 95 kg guys to whom Sagov had previously tough times, he said easily because Sagov was 105 kg. So he underlined this fact that Sagov was gaining weight and also level with it.
Roman: So he's saying that because Sagov is a taller, big guy, whenever he's gaining weight, he's getting stronger. Whenever he was cutting to 95, he was losing some power. Yeah, he said that it was because of the 95 kg, Sagov was not that much in his optimum shape and good prepared for that much back then. But after that, Sagov was... So he basically says that Sagov is going to beat Tata Shinks, is what he said.
Roman: Yeah, yes, I guess so. I will re-ask. I think this is what he said. Yeah, he said that he will not leave any chances to talk about his book. That's what he said. Can you ask Revaz a hard question? Vala versus Samushia. Oh, that's a hard question in many ways. Rezo,
Revaz Lutidze: He doesn't want to talk about that. You know why he doesn't want to talk about that. It's a Georgii match. He's saying that we Georgii are in...
Roman: He said that we Georgii, we are coming from a slightly in our own unique world where they don't speak about
Engin Terzi: There is an unwritten rule. Exactly, you got it right. He wished both dudes success. Revaz thinks that someday we will see two Georgii for the title match in Super Heavyweight as well.
Roman: Yes, Rezo, and I would like to ask you, if you think that you will be able to do it, what do you think about the number of first-class Georgii citizens? Yes, of course, of course, that's what I'm talking about.
Engin Terzi: Yes, yes, maybe about the subject that we have already talked. I'm not asking who's going to win. I said, are we going to see two Georgii someday? It means that will there be like, there will be like the number one and number two. And then finally, if it is not a title match, I will never set two guys from the same country. I will never do that.
Roman: But if it is a title match, then it is like it has to be said. I'm not asking who's going to win. I'm asking, will we see this match in a superior way someday? OK, I will make sure. Rezo, I have a question for you. I don't think that the two Georgii who are going to fight each other are going to win. I think that if the Georgii number one and the Georgii number two are going to fight each other,
Roman: I was told that I would be able to speak Georgii with you for the first time and we would all be able to do it together. If you don't mind, I don't think I will be able to speak Georgii with you. If you don't mind, I will be able to speak Georgii with you. What do you think, Miho, what do you think? Well, first of all, my name is Levani. I know that I won't be able to speak Georgii, but I will be able to.
Revaz Lutidze: He's saying that... He said that, obviously, number one is his good friend, Lewan. And he himself, Revaz, is not going to stop so far.
Roman: He said that most likely we are going that direction, that it may be possible that we will pull. And then he also mentioned that about Gennady, right now he's out, but he's going to be coming back and we all three are in the super heavyweights. So who knows, maybe we all three have to pull each other one day. I understand. Can you ask Vitalii, does he think that winner of this match should pull for the title in their next match?
Roman: Vitalii, Engin asks you, what do you think, as a winner of your match against Revaz, is the winner available to fight for the title against Ermes? Well, I have to say that besides Ermes, there are a lot of worthy opponents, I think so.
Roman: The same Svitkov, Morozov, Devon, Varad. Okay. I asked, I mentioned, Engin, I mentioned Ermes's name because he's number one title holder. So he said, I asked him what you said and what you asked him. No, no, no, no, no, not Ermes. Title match. This is title match because we don't know Ermes and Devon are going to pull.
Roman: And then we don't know if that was my fault. I'm just asking that, do they think that after this match, the winner deserves to pull for the title? Yeah, I have to re-ask the question. That was my fault, sorry. It's okay. Vitalii, I made a mistake. I will translate this question. He asks,
Roman: You or Rivas, when this match is over and the winner is... What do you think, is the winner worthy to fight for the title? Or not? I thought, why not? I think it's worthy. Especially now, a lot of people have been injured. And... I think, yes. Why not? I think so, too. And...
Roman: He said that, yeah, why not? And he said that based on the recent events, recent history, he's saying that many, many tops got injured and stuff. So he believes that a winner of this match is worthy enough to go for the title. But Revaz also asked me to re-translate for him as well. Yeah, translate him, yeah. So that he can also see.
Roman: Rezo, what do you think is the most important thing for you as a musician? What do you think is the most important thing for you as a musician? What do you think is the most important thing for you as a musician? What do you think is the most important thing for me as a musician?
Roman: Revo said that it depends on the plan, how the match will be set up, but perhaps one more match and then the title. If there is a title, he would also consider himself to fight for it. It all depends on the management of the matches. I will ask them one last question, if nothing comes to my mind, because suddenly something came to my mind.
Roman: Can you ask Vitalii, in November, who does he think that is going to win? Devon Larratt or Denis Cipenko? Oh, Vitalii, a new question. Devon vs. Denis. What do you think in November? Who will win this match? Denis is very well prepared.
Roman: he believes that uh dennis is well well capable to prepare for them uh properly and in that case he will be victorious so he says if dennis is if dennis is ready he's gonna win yes that's what he said can you ask the same question
Roman: He's saying Denis will win, he just said. He heard the question, he answered it. Oh, he made a mistake, he wanted to say Devon, not Denis. OK, Revo is thinking that Larratt is going to win and Vitalii is thinking that if Denis is ready, then he's going to win. Yes, yes. OK.
Engin Terzi: Anyway, guys, do they want to say anything? Lastly, in probably around two and a half weeks, a little bit more than two weeks, we will see each other. Can you ask them if there's anything they want to add? Vitalii, now Engin is giving you and Revaz
Roman: What would you like to say before your match? If you want to say something, you have a chance before the two-week match. If you want to say something, yes. Well, I can only wish you good luck in your preparation. I hope that everything will go without injuries, that you don't strain too much, that you are getting ready and coming back in good shape.
Vitalii Laletin: Thank you. Yes, yes, yes. Usually, many people start, as they say, before the tournament, they have even more strength to get out of themselves, and then they get injured. Therefore, let them train carefully so that they come without injury. I wish him good luck. Thank you very much. Rezu, do you want to say something? I don't know what to say, but I don't want to say anything.
Roman: I will translate to reverse and I will translate to you quickly.
Revaz Lutidze: What do you think about it? What do you think about it? What do you think about it? I would like to say that we, together, from the Ruslan side, from the Ruslan side, from the Ruslan side, from the Ruslan side, from the Ruslan side,
Revaz Lutidze: As a sportsman, I had a lot of conversations with Italians. Me, Vitalii, Vasco, Dima, Levani. I had a lot of conversations with Italians. I had a lot of conversations with Italians. I had a lot of conversations with Italians. I had a lot of conversations with Italians. I had a lot of conversations with Italians.
Roman: So first of all, Vitalii said that his last words prior to their match is that he wishes the best for both of them. He wishes the best for Revaz as well. He's underlined one factor that lately we see some athletes get hyped and like training and training even more and more.
Roman: very short time prior to the match they get injured, so he wishes that Rivas trains properly and comes injured free, comes well prepared, and he wished success for this matter to Rivas. Then I translated the same thing, but Rivas already understood that
Roman: And then Rewa said all the time he had a really good relationship with Vitalii. If we take out the armwrestling, take the armwrestling away, they always were friends. He mentioned Vassili, I believe he mentioned him, Levan, Vitalii and Dimas Ilayev. They all were very good friends. Friendship was there and has always been. And they have this respect mutually. So that's what he wanted to say.
Engin Terzi: Sorry, one more thing came to my mind, you know, to Vitalii. Just John Burzin, but translate good. John Burzin, around 9,500 kilo guy during his prime. You know, Vitalii probably saw our trading cards. Someone who is 95 kilo or 100 kilo, who was beaten even the super heavyweights in his prime. What does he think that his stats should be, numbers should be on his prime card?
Roman: I think he will definitely understand what you're just saying. So Vitalii, Engin did a minute ago
Roman: A minute ago, he had this John Brzenk card, and he asked you, what do you think about John Brzenk? What kind of hook, toproll and backpressure does he use? He knows, he knows. This statistic, how to...
Roman: You have to make sure that the right percentage is accurate and accurate for the right John, when he was around 100kg. It all depends on the time, on the years. When he wins everyone's legs in the top and in the hook, the percentage is 100%.
Vitalii Laletin: Now the times are changing, and I don't know the statistics for a certain year, for a certain maximum. Do you see this, Vitalii?
Roman: John's statistic about armwrestling. He asked you, what do you think, will it be all 10s or 9s or 8s? I think at the time when I was fighting with John Dzenk, I won them all. I think there are 10s left. He was the best, right? Yeah, he's saying that's accurate because... Not only was he the best, he was also universal. Oh, that's...
Roman: Yes, that's a very accurate answer. So he said that he agrees the fact that Prime John was beating everybody, but it was not only like he was beating everybody else, but he was very universal armwrestler. He believes that it has to be all 10. He agrees on that fact. Prime John has to be all 10.
Roman: Is this what he says? This is what he said, yeah. Whenever I put 10, people are like, you're extreme and this and this. No, guys, Vitalii just said it has to be all 10. Ask quickly the same thing to Revaz and let's finish. Revaz, he's saying John deserves even 100 in all categories, not 10. Prime John, yeah.
Roman: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, guys, thank you very much for... He's saying that there will be no one... How can I say? I almost think, as a sport itself, we'll never have John Brzezinski second in its entire history and future.
Engin Terzi: There was only one John Brzezink in armwrestling and there would be never born anyone else. Let's be honest, you know, Vitalii, Revaz, Gennady, myself, we all grew up by watching John Brzezink. And we were like, wow, you know, this is how he was. You see, he smiled like he understood what you said. Yeah, yeah. Anyways, guys, thank you very much. Vitalii, thank you very much, my friend. See you in two weeks. Thank you for your time, for coming. Revaz, thank you very much, my friend.
Engin Terzi: and then see you guys in two weeks thank you very much roman thank you always yeah and thanks to everyone who watch us and i hope that you know everything will be safe and then we will have a great time thank you
