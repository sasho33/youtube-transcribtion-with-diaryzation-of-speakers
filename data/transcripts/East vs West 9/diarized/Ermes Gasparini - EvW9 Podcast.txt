Engin Terzi: Sorry guys, I'm coming now soon.
Engin Terzi: Hello, guys. No, Alijan. Yeah, Alijan holds. Yeah, that's true. Yeah. Hello, guys. Very, very soon.
Engin Terzi: according to the plan in eight minutes, he needs to come.
Engin Terzi: guys if you are going to create provocation during the already in the chat you came here you will get blocked you know that so just i mean if you don't understand certain things just i would suggest you to just shut up you understand prime bruising card is just most likely this event
Engin Terzi: anyone is anyone is saying that ufc is on the wrong way that guy is enemy of arm wrestling some some unites some separates and okay where is that guy okay oh let him go not deleted only just let him block as well you know just delete him it's not enough okay next time um
Engin Terzi: Thank you guys. I'm killing him myself here, you know, like start working for armwrestling, just I wake up and then until my eyes are closing and then just, so just anyone who hasn't done anything for armwrestling, just come on. I'm not going to, I will just block them, you know, so I'm just warning that, you know, what's going to happen, you know, I'm here to give you guys a good time, you know, that's all.
Engin Terzi: Some people have this much of thinking level, this size. That's what it is. The reason that Armwrestling is having golden years, guys, is because fans are now able to see all the best ones together. That's why it's growing.
Engin Terzi: Once they are five there, five there, three there, four there, five there, six there, then you will not enjoy arm wrestling anymore. So securing that all these will be together and saying that this is bad is only a stupid sadist.
Engin Terzi: Those people are the ones that, in fact, they are supporting to be divided. Being united is the only way for armwrestling right now to reach to the UFC level. One official ranking and title so that outside of the world, when they look at us, they will say, OK, this is a serious sport, not just a show.
Engin Terzi: not like entertainment categories lightweight welterweight middleweight light heavyweight heavyweight super heavyweight left right man woman this is the future you will see the old times when this ends then you will see that but you will see much bright future when this is secured what's happening now is secured and then what will happen
Engin Terzi: some more serious people will say guys thank you you guys did a great job and brought armless into this level now let us handle the rest and we will say okay this is about my capacity go ahead this is what it is and anyone who is against this is clearly an enemy of armistice this is what i am saying with hundred percent believing in so don't talk about what you don't understand
Engin Terzi: I'm securing what you are experiencing in the last one and a half years. And I only deserve thanks for this.
Engin Terzi: Fira Isaac, I'm going to set a title match for her, most likely in November, East versus West 10. I'm not going to mention the name, but I made an offer for a world-level athlete. She didn't accept. I will find the same level of athletes. Not many people on this earth deserve to...
Engin Terzi: Pool for the world title. Thank you, my friends. Thank you, my friend. Thank you. Thank you, my brother.
Engin Terzi: Those people who talk against, they are, they just want the old years, you know. They just want to give drama to the community, only drama. Talk, talk, talk, and then illusion. Is this all they want? While I'm giving the reality. I'm tired, I'm tired.
Engin Terzi: because I feel responsible for the community. People buy people, you know, support with merchandise, you know, and so I'm responsible. And then so that's why I need to work harder. Hello, quality. I don't see you. You don't see me? No. It is because do you know why? Because you became world champion. We crashed it.
Engin Terzi: and your nose is like up like this and then so you don't see because you are like you know i don't see the people if there are not my labor you don't see right you don't you still don't see me no okay but people's guys you see me maybe i mean i think i'm on we both are on the
Engin Terzi: I try again, one moment. Okay. So basically, you should appreciate that when
Engin Terzi: securing that you will be you will continue to see this atlas pulling against each other then now you see now i'm at your level now you yeah because i i went down yeah there are too much message yeah
Engin Terzi: Some people will just try to provoke others, like saying that it is bad that this is secure, that all the top athletes are going to keep going to compete with each other. I don't know if this is because of their jealousy or anything. There is nothing better than this, to unite all the athletes together, to pull together.
Ermes Gasparini: Yeah, yeah. This is a dream and now we are inside. Yeah, it is a dream and I'm just securing the dream. In the past you remember with America and here with many, many leagues.
Engin Terzi: the people don't know who is the strongest. Yeah. They just dream only polls. You know, they are writing who would win if this guy would pull this guy, who would be 10 years, 15 years now, every, every one and a half month, either in Dubai, either in Istanbul, they are pulling to say that this is bad is the same as saying that UFC is doing bad, you know? Yes. Yeah.
Ermes Gasparini: And Devon too, you know, he pulled it only in WAI. Now he pulled it with Gennady, now with me. Super beautiful, super amazing. But it's amazing for armwrestling, for the community. If I lose or if he loses, it's the same. But for armwrestling, it's an armwrestling win.
Engin Terzi: these things yes my friend yes i mean like how can we have a healthy healthy ranking if the all athletes are not pulling together you understand yeah yeah yeah and so this is there is no professional support we want to i think some people still want this to be like a bar sport or something you know it like there is no other sport in the world that the professional athletes
Engin Terzi: don't have the security guarantee matches this much and this much of the win for winning and for guarantee you know this is this is how about that every athlete that i talk they are like you know wow it's great you know that we feel secure you know that like this is how and then we securing them that that all the top athletes will be competing against each other and still all the waff athletes
Engin Terzi: They can compete their nationals. They can compete their European. They can compete everywhere. They can compete anywhere. You know, this is, we don't restrict, you know, but in a professional level, it is normal that, you know, a big investment to protect the ranking, protect the title, protect the athletes. You understand? Because like, otherwise it's just thinking one step below. We left there.
Engin Terzi: This is a step forward to the future of the sport. This is where we want to head. Yeah. Yeah. And then for many years, 20 years, 30 years, I wasn't even involved. Nobody really tried this way. And now when you do it, they are like, ah, it is bad. Throw mud, you know. Just forget about it. Talk about us. You remember, there is Jaleb Williams. Ermes, how long should I boil my pasta for?
Ermes Gasparini: How much? You need to cook the pasta. 10 minutes is not too much. Just tell them the truth that you don't cook them, your mother doesn't, you have no idea about it. Come on. No, no, really. I cook for you, my friend. You can cook for me? Yeah, no, I'm very...
Ermes Gasparini: Really? Like a chef? Yeah. How is everything? Everything's good. Yeah, to take two matches very close, only for the mind it's a little bit hard.
Ermes Gasparini: because usually I prepare my match three, four months before. But I want to compete three, four times a year and now there are these possibilities. My arm is completely healthy and why not? I have the possibility to compete with this legend.
Ermes Gasparini: I asked him for two years to compete with him and now I have the possibility. Why not? This is the answer. Yeah, but I'm telling you, when you say you need to prepare, you are already prepared. Yeah, my training every time is the same. Every time is the same, my training, more or less.
Ermes Gasparini: yeah it's not like if i don't if i pull with jerry i don't train my wrist i put a trainer my wish like like every time and uh yeah only i need only to prepare the technique on the table with my coach i already know how to how to compete how to pull
Ermes Gasparini: yeah i hope really i hope the the match will will not go like um lose around for four fouls i hope i hope i hope why would that be why would there be so many files why would they go because uh they want you know every every everybody know he wanted to have uh
Ermes Gasparini: more advantage with wrist and he cover your thumbs, your knuckles, sorry. If my knuckles, he will cover my knuckles, I will not start the match, for sure. Why he need to cheat? I don't understand. Why he need to cheat every time?
Ermes Gasparini: i wanted yeah you really yesterday yesterday yesterday i had a i had i wanted to to start same me and him same same say center with the with the the knuckle and everything is everything good
Engin Terzi: Who is he? Yesterday I talked with him. Probably you watched. Yeah, yeah, true. He changed his mind. He was very respectful to you and now you're calling him a cheater. And he said that he never starts trash talking before somebody starts. He already started two years ago. More, three years ago with Matt Mask.
Engin Terzi: Oh, what did he tell you? Practical table champion. Oh, he called you practice champion. I remember. Okay, now you have a point there. Yesterday, I asked him, Devon, you say that always your opponent starts this kind of talk.
Engin Terzi: and but i said in islam you directly started talk bad about about dave cheffy and he said oh because many years ago he told me this so i never forgot so now when you say like now when you say like two years ago he called you practice champion so now we can say that devon started yeah they won't stop okay okay okay okay there is a super chat for you awesome on a range of one to ten
Engin Terzi: can be Michael Todd. How delusional is Devon when he says that he can beat you guys? Let's be a little bit more respectful. Michael is a guy that beat, rest in peace, you know, Pushkar two rounds, you know, and he also beat him 6-0 before. I mean, like, I mean... The question? The question is, he is asking, do you think Devon is delusional? Delusional, like...
Ermes Gasparini: You know, but he thinks that he can beat you. My friend, it's normal. Everyone, when they have a fight, you will go to win, not to lose. Yeah, yeah. If you go to lose, it's better to stay at home. Yeah. And as he records, he says, he says,
Engin Terzi: One second, you moved again. Ermes and Devon will be doing food cooking fights before the match, Roman, Cech. Yeah, we can organize, my friend. Okay, so what will happen? Yeah, you prepare the cuisine. We prepare the cuisine. You both come to Istanbul and then you both cook. And then I will find, okay, what we will do, everyone that is competing East versus West,
Engin Terzi: will eat, taste both of them, and then they will decide who is cooking better. Yeah, my friend, but I need quality food. Quality product, yeah. Quality Italian. Devon't worry about it. We have better than Italy. Devon't worry about it. Yeah. One second. And
Engin Terzi: Rami Kersnovskiy. Ermes, you want trash talk with Devon? Admit it. You need to admit that you want trash talk with Devon. Do you want? You don't care? Yeah. Michael Ulselt Kijelhaug. Thank you for your support, my friends. And Mark Bautiller. Ermes won't take Devon's hand, so how will he win?
Engin Terzi: He says that you won't be able to take Devon's wrist. How are you going to win? I will win when I take the wrist of Devon. They say that you cannot take his wrist, so how are you going to win? I can't. They say you cannot. Okay.
Engin Terzi: you see you'll see okay top roll is for smart thank you for your support and let me finish this can we ask airmen for technical breakdown for devon match how will it go outside inside stop police for smart thank you okay how is the match gonna be can you tell us how the match will go you and devon ready not ready don't move
Engin Terzi: go go yeah and people says that you know this is done you know for jerry in your match they have the people just some people are really crazy they are out of their minds after gennady versus devon match they complained that there was like so many early starts because he says ready this is perfect and they were complaining that gennady was starting early maybe if you see if you see
Ermes Gasparini: in the match with me and Jerry, look with Jerry, he started a little bit later than me. On the second round, he started before me a little bit. So you are saying that basically it wouldn't matter? Yeah. Okay. I understand what you're saying.
Engin Terzi: We want to see Engin versus Ermes match at 85 kilos. This is what Devon was saying there. Devon, I remember six months ago, before your match with Levan, he said the best thing you ever did in your career was win an 85-kilo world title. But six months later now, you are number one in the world. Yeah, I'm number one, but I don't feel...
Ermes Gasparini: I need to beat Lewand before and after this I feel to be number one. When you know that somebody on this earth
Ermes Gasparini: cannot pull because he has some injury on the wrist but he has beaten you you feel like you need to prove yourself and beat him exactly yeah exactly yes okay yeah and for me if they will win this match if if with the one percent chance uh he will not the number one in the world
Ermes Gasparini: Or if he doesn't accept the match? No, if he will win, if with 1% possibility, this match, he will not be a number one in the world. Because he lost with Gennady. Oh, if Devon wins, he's not number one? No. No, it doesn't work that way. No, it doesn't work that way.
Ermes Gasparini: no yes i have the bet now for the first you are number one now he lost no no inside i i mean inside inside you know i like me and leva i lost with leva and i don't feel uh to be number one i understand but listen it doesn't work that way just think that after your match if they want to say then 11 just say example if you would lose to just say laletti
Engin Terzi: and and then you come and beat laletin so is it still levan is number one what was it i don't know no no no no i don't yeah yes but uh he i listen listen it doesn't work that way you don't you
Engin Terzi: beat the number one guy to become the best. You don't need to beat someone that you lost in the past to become the number one. It doesn't work that way. You don't need to beat everyone. But if the matches are very close, near, it's more these things. Guys, I will tell you something. You know, I see some of the comments about the contracts.
Engin Terzi: do you know what is the nightmare for you guys so that you can answer those those provocators guys nightmare is if if in six months later if if we don't do this and if some people just have with the five six guys and other people with the five six guys and other people with five six guys then that is a nightmare to make sure to to make sure that to bring all this together
Engin Terzi: and to secure that you guys will be able to see this more and more then this is the even securing the golden time of arm wrestling so people are trying to mess with your mind either they don't understand or they are jealous other than that what is happening right now is securing the future of the sport yeah because nobody nobody will be interested
Engin Terzi: when all the superstars are divided there, there, there, here and there and there, as in the past, to make sure that they are all together, if I would exclude anyone, like only this, but nothing more can come here, only seven guys, only six guys, only seven, eight, only East, only West, then I would understand that that is bad. But if you are saying you're all welcome to be in the one field,
Engin Terzi: To say that this is bad is the same as saying that UFC is doing bad. Yeah. Just please, just think about it. Think about it. It is only securing what you have today. This is the best way to, to be, to have a good future for us. King of the table may not have the ranking, but you don't know all of my plans. Maybe we will do a unified title.
Engin Terzi: Maybe we will start that the matches happening there, the matches happening here will be considered one unified ranking. You understand? You just only know what you hear. You don't know all the plans. The guy that who has been serving the community, trust me, is thinking more, more, more, more, more just to make it better. Armwrestling will be taken more seriously when all the guys are put in the same place.
Engin Terzi: And just come on, man. Like you, you want to see all these guys or you want them to be divided? To bring them together and unite them, how is it bad for you? Like if somebody goes like five, six, like who's holding them? It can happen. It didn't happen like last four or five years before. It happened. So did you like that? No. This is the exact opposite thing is that it's happening. And these athletes are not like kindergarten
Engin Terzi: children or something you know that you're treating them you know like was their force or something what what force they are saying they're all happy they were so happy that they were taking it like superstars you know like they they were like honored you know anyways um no my friend everything is good i have i have unofficial committee
Engin Terzi: Like John, like Devon, if you think that, you know, I'm just alone, you know, just like trying to do something, no. I'm telling you, this is for the future. If these athletes, if they don't pull with each other, after a point that only one guy just comes just for the sake of making money, gets like five, six of these guys, and then five, six is other place.
Engin Terzi: And then the same thing will start. My guys are better than your guys. Your guys are better than my guy. There will be imaginary polls on the social media, and then they pull against each other. And then people will lose their interest in arm wrestling and they won't watch it because they don't see all the best guys together. Now, when I bring them all together, not I should say I, but when we bring them all together and some people are attacking, why is that? You should think.
Engin Terzi: This only can be explained either with misunderstanding or with bad intention. I'm 100% sure that the majority of the community is because of misunderstanding that they are thinking maybe negative. But if this doesn't happen now, and if it happens by three or four different parts, then you will see. Then you will see why we cannot see the best guys together anymore. And then you will start complaining.
Engin Terzi: Okay, Ermes Gasparini, you said six months ago that if Devon tries desperation move, you said, I can even show you, it's recorded on my phone. You said you are going to break his bone, like boom, you know. Can you still say the same thing? Or is it like because he was not set now when the things get serious, you are more careful? Now it will be too fast.
Ermes Gasparini: Oh, you will not need. Huh? He will be so fast that you will not need. Yeah, he can't hold and he will not break nothing. He goes too fast. So you will beat him so fast that his arm... Yeah, it's more safe for him. Oh, okay, okay, okay, okay. So you are saying that he cannot show resistance and that's why? Yeah, it's only because I respect him.
Ermes Gasparini: And I will beat him so fast. Okay. So you are saying that likely he is respectful to you and because of the respect you have for him, you are not going to injury him? Yeah, he's older than me. He's a legend for our sport. But he was still older than you six months ago when you said you were going to break his arm. Yeah. Okay. Okay.
Engin Terzi: There are a few questions later, I'm missing them, and then people are getting upset that I didn't reach Superchat. Jaleb Williams, how hard will it be to take Devon's hand? How hard it is to take his wrist? I never shake his hand. And I think it will not be easy. It will not be easy? Not too much.
Ermes Gasparini: Yeah, you are saying it will be so easy match, and now you are saying it will be so hard. No, no, no, no. To go down, yes, but to take completely the hand. So you are saying that you don't need to take his hand, you will just go down so quickly. Down, down, one, two, three. Because so many videos, he have very strong pronation. Yeah, he lose the arm.
Ermes Gasparini: The army will open very fast, but I don't think it will be the least too. After beating Devon, Levan or Denis for next? I'm very curious too to pull with Denis.
Ermes Gasparini: If you shake his hand, you feel like already loose. Say again? If you shake your hand? If you shake the hand of Denis, you feel very bad. Because his strong and big hand? Super big. But I think it will be more easy to take than Levan or other people.
Ermes Gasparini: Because the finger is too short. And he's holding so low, right? He's holding so low. Yeah, and for me it's perfect. Yeah. So you are saying that it will not be so hard match if you pull Dennis? No, no. For sure it will be hard. For sure. But for my style it's very good. Very good. For my top row. So you're saying that you're going to beat Devon so easy and then
Ermes Gasparini: Dennis will be very hard, but easier than... No, three seconds, maybe five. Devon? Devon is five seconds? Five seconds each round. Devon, if it is five seconds, he will stop you. Five seconds, it means that the match will...
Ermes Gasparini: You know, so one, two, three, four, five. Ah, OK, OK, OK. Max, max, max. Maximum seven second with press. OK, so you go if it stops, you go boom. Maybe two second with the hook. We like Jerry. Or if he goes inside with you, you will beat him in two seconds in hook. Hook very easy.
Engin Terzi: You are just trying to intimidate him, trying to scare him. No, no, my friend. You show my match with Jerry or not? Can I ask you something? With Jerry, would you start in the hook? What? With Jerry, would you beat him? Could you beat him in hook if you start in hook? Easy.
Engin Terzi: I won in the hook. I won. No, no, no. You won in the hook, but the match didn't start in the hook. Look at the first moment with Jerry. I was like this. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But what I'm just saying that even if you would just start with the goal here, you would still beat him, right? This is what you're saying. With Jerry? Yeah. Yeah. And can you do that to Devon? Yeah, very fast like this.
Engin Terzi: But would you start there? No, no. I would start with the regular rules. So you are saying that until he comes, you just boom. Bam. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Like this. Like that. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. So Paul, I'm funny. My friends, the fans want this like Devon cooking pancakes. Can you post your cooking pasta battle of the carbonate rice? Carbo.
Engin Terzi: Can you do that? Carbon? You need to film your cooking, everything, and then post on YouTube. Yeah, we do. You will do? Okay. Yeah. Okay. Okay. He eat like a vegetarian, vegetarians.
Ermes Gasparini: Vegetarian. Vegetarians. Vegetarians is correct, the pronouns. Yeah, vegetarian, yeah. You don't have power with this food. Completely is not correct. Vegetarian, they don't have power? You show what they eat. But there is meat in it, there is also meat in it.
Ermes Gasparini: Yeah, but there are no carbs. Oh, carbs. Okay, okay. These are carbs, my friend. Okay, okay, yeah. Is that still 48 something? Huh? Is that still 48 something? 45 now. Is it smaller, 45 now? My measurement, my friend, is very correct.
Engin Terzi: I measure it every day with a good... Is it true that when you measure your height, you also find two meters yourself? Top role king. I believe even Levan does not take Devon's hand, but is highly subjective.
Engin Terzi: Top roll is for Smarty saying, Silky Wilkie, Ermes, do you do massage for your back muscles and x-rays to check that your arm bones are strong? Can you show me a picture where we see quality pasta inside? Can you show me a picture where we see quality pasta inside? Inside where? I don't know. Maybe it's in your stomach.
Engin Terzi: I don't know. I don't know. Inside, pasta inside. I don't know. Because if he says like inside, maybe he thinks about kitchen. But when he says pictures, then I... Because we both are not native English speakers, maybe. Do you do massage for your back? And do you do x-ray if your bones are okay? Do you do like roncan?
Ermes Gasparini: No, no, no. Do you go to the hospital and check your arm, you know, if everything is okay with your bone? The massage, I do every week. Every week, okay. Yeah, legs too, neck, back. And for my bone like this, if I don't have pain, why do I need to check?
Ermes Gasparini: or not maybe maybe for my future i needed to do something for cartilaging you know for to have now i want to see if there are something like yeah yeah do you use collagen yeah
Ermes Gasparini: I use, I use. Do you use glucosamine, chondroitin? Yeah, collagen, there are everything inside. But maybe it's better one time a year or two times a year to put something, you know, in your joint for your cartilage. Like acid, what is the name in English? Acid.
Ermes Gasparini: In Italy, it's acidoianurolico. It's like for the joint. It's like oil for the joint inside. Okay. Okay. Okay, there is Dragon War. The weak Canadian Devon will be crushed by Ermes. He said the weak Canadian Devon will be crushed by Ermes. Very smart guy.
Engin Terzi: Smart guy? Yeah, super smart guy. Do you think he's top roller as well? Top roller? If he's the smart guy, so he's probably top roller. Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure. He would do very good top roller. Jaleb Williams, someone called Devon right now, make it spicy. No, my friend. We will do that probably like 10 days later. Devon and his son are coming to visit me earlier.
Engin Terzi: and we will be i will be like showing what i know to his son uh so maybe when 15th 15th of this month so they are they are coming because he wanted you teach him something do you he devil wants me to teach yeah yeah for sure heaven knows everything you know he just wanted to learn the pronation like this
Engin Terzi: And then in the last 10 days he will make the difference and he will be... Yeah, maybe he wants you to go in his corner. Oh, during the Supermatch? Yeah. Do you think that... You have a very good suggestion, but it's not enough for him. So you are saying that if I go to Devon's corner during the Supermatch, you will not be angry with him? With him?
Engin Terzi: with me you will you will not bang a little bit yes but it will not change result you say no no no same after after after we will you will come with me so are you saying there is nothing on this earth that can help devon nothing
Engin Terzi: Nothing? Maybe if he will put some pillows in the water like this or... Some pills into your body? Maybe. And he makes you ill and then... Maybe, yes. I think you told me something. You said like... Really? You would beat him or did you say this about Jerry or did you say about Devon that you would beat him even if you were drunk or something?
Engin Terzi: I will beat him. I think you said something like this, but I don't remember. Yeah, yeah. If I am drunk, I will beat to change. Who? Devon? Devon, yeah. Devon. So if you are drunk, you can still beat Devon? Yeah. Oh, OK. OK. I don't want to miss it.
Engin Terzi: Vegetarian devil is not quality, Roman says. Bravo. And let's see if I meet anything before they get upset with me. Okay, not really. After, okay. Rafa, Ermes, what kind of meat do you eat with your pasta? Grass-fed beef?
Ermes Gasparini: Do you like beef? Sometimes with pasta. It's like with tomato. It's difficult to say in English. It's not chicken. It's meat with tomato.
Engin Terzi: I don't know what is the word in English. Roman also says, Engin and Ermes, your English isn't Silky Wilkie's level. That's for sure. Mine is not for sure. Does he believe he will compete world level at 48? Do you believe that you will still be like Devon at your 48 years and still pulling for the title?
Ermes Gasparini: It's very difficult to say. The most important thing is not to have an injury. Because if you have a big injury, maybe like me, when I stopped my career for three years, it's a very big problem. Because after this, it's difficult to return
Engin Terzi: like same level when you are before. What is your plan? How long do you want to compete? As long as you can be competitive? Or is there anything? I would put like 10 more years and then finish. Or you will decide later? Now in my mind, now I started to compete in the Super Heavyweight two years ago.
Ermes Gasparini: uh i think maybe 40 years old like this if i can use 10 more years yeah maybe after this i will go down with my weight and then heavyweight yeah because to be more healthy you know
Engin Terzi: We will see, we will see what will happen. Yesterday, did you watch Devon? Yesterday? Yes. How did you find Devon? David you find Devon very confident? Too confident. No confidence? Too confident. This is a very big mistake. Remember. Okay, okay, one second, one second. You said you found him too confident? Too confident. Oh, okay. It will be a very big mistake.
Engin Terzi: he will see on the table but you are also confident not too much like him okay because you give him one percent of chance of winning he said he's underdog he at least says that you know he looks underdog you you give him only one percent
Ermes Gasparini: It's a lot. Jerry, he has 0.5. Okay. Okay, okay, okay. How about Lewand? If you would be pulling Lewand, he'll do everything. What's his chance, 50%? If it will be maybe next summer? Yeah. I think 50%.
Ermes Gasparini: So it's like 50-50. A lot more than last time. Okay. Because I show my body and compare. If I compare my body when I fought with Levan, the mask, the quality. You are stronger now? Yeah. Yeah? For sure. For sure. This is your best shape ever?
Engin Terzi: I think yes. I remember six months ago on the podcast, you told Devon, Devon, don't make it so late because every day your chains are going down. Yeah, this is for sure. And next year will be grow more. If it will continue like this, I will be more stronger every time.
Engin Terzi: But do you think that Devon is also picking now because he's healthy? You saw him, right? Listen, listen. Like, listen, I'm sure you're going to tell me Dave is now different than the time that you beat him, you know, but I understand. But my question is different. Were you not surprised that Devon's ability to directly do this and everything? Yeah, for sure. I'm super happy for him.
Ermes Gasparini: he found something to be healthy and he can compete like in the past. And Dave Chaffee... Really, one thing, I can't believe if I put the same power when I fought with him, back pressure, and he was very strong,
Ermes Gasparini: If I compare with Chaffee and Devon with Chaffee, I think it's impossible. Because if I put a lot of pressure, Devon won't be at this level. If you compare the fights. You understand what I mean? Yeah, yeah, yeah, I understand very well. I understand very well, yeah. It's not the same Chaffee when he fought with...
Ermes Gasparini: Moroso, Gennady, me. It's not the same. Yeah, now I know maybe it is 20% less. I think. Because if you have a problem in your neck, your connection is not good. My friend, this guy had this problem for many years already, you know. For many years he had the problem. So it's not a new thing. I just don't want you to make a...
Ermes Gasparini: wrong calculation you know by thinking that dave chef is 20 percent less by my friend yeah you can put you can put this like when he he he shade the devil
Engin Terzi: But now I'm not ashamed when I fought with Chase. No, that's for sure. That's for sure. Completely different level. Yes, yes. I mean, if you are even stronger than the time that you pulled Levan, of course you are stronger than the time that you pulled Dave. But what I just tried to say that Devon is different as well. You are progressing because you are still young. You still have some room to progress.
Engin Terzi: But Devon is progressing because he hasn't been able to, he hadn't been able to use some of his arm wrestling muscle groups, joints, some directions. You understand? And it makes him like 10%, 15%. You cannot do this anymore. Now he's able to do, but everything is coming so back. So it is not like he's progressing this much, but he's suddenly hook is coming back. You know, like,
Ermes Gasparini: Yeah, I understand everything, but I think I have respect, but at 40 years old, it's difficult to have a lot of progression like when you are 30 years old. But if you understand this, I'm telling you, this has nothing to do with age.
Engin Terzi: This is something that some parts that he couldn't use for like 10 years, 15 years, now he is able to use that part. It is not because more power, but more parts coming back that he couldn't use this, but now he is using. He couldn't go like this. He was head to head together with Gennady. His hook and Gennady inside was like balance, you know, very close match, you know. He just didn't have the hook endurance because his hook is just coming back. His top roll endurance is very good.
Engin Terzi: For like 10 years, 15 years, he's able to do that. But his hook, for many years, he wasn't able to do this. But now it's coming back. So I think that he has now hook. I saw in Dubai, you know, I saw he did this directly, he did this directly, he did this directly, side pressure. So I know from myself, sometimes my elbow feels healthy. I'm like, wow, what's happening? You know, like different. So I'm not saying he's going to win or you're going to win or something.
Ermes Gasparini: Just don't underestimate him. It looks different. I don't know why I need it. And don't underestimate nobody, my friend. For sure. If I take some match, I will be ready 110% every time. I will do my best every time. After this, if you lose or you win, yeah.
Ermes Gasparini: Important is in your mind you did your 100%. This is important for me. Very important. And after this, yes, I'm very happy for him. Now he can use many techniques. But we will see. We will see on the table. Can I ask you something? Answer me honestly. Do you really believe his chance is 1%?
Ermes Gasparini: um to be honest it will be hard five and just let's let's agree no no no one moment uh it will be hard in the setup because when everybody know he continue to do like this but
Ermes Gasparini: I think he can do something, maybe with Kim Move. But if I take him inside, he can't use Kim Move. So you are saying his chances, he needs to stop you somewhere at the center. Once you took him here... Yeah, the first thing I want to start, same like him. With regular rules, everything's good.
Ermes Gasparini: And we can start. If there is something wrong, I will not start the match, for sure. I can wait one hour, no problem. I want to start correctly. Really, eh? Really. I will not start the match, eh?
Engin Terzi: That's not what I asked. I asked about his... What do you think about his... And then he will take fouls, fouls, fouls, and he will lose the match. I hope he will not do like this. Okay. So it looks like you have a thought in your mind that there will be some problems with the setup. For sure. 100%.
Ermes Gasparini: Every time he has a problem with the referee. I want to have the centre correct, the wrist, the knuckle, the hand to be very close. Everything's correct. I want. After this, we can start.
Engin Terzi: There is a super chat. Silky Wilkie is asking, if Engin is in Devon's corner, then Devon will have 2% more power and Ermes will be afraid. People need to understand that some athletes really don't need help. Devon is one of them. Let's see. Okay, there's no more super chats, so let's talk.
Ermes Gasparini: So basically you are saying that everything is fair and square. You're going to win comfortably. And the important is this. I wanted to do a good arm wrestling. I don't want to cheat. I don't want to cheat, but with everything fair. This is important.
None: I understand. And then he, he, he, he will speak like this, say go, say go, just say go. Devon't cry. Devon't cry like a baby. It looks like, it looks like you, you, you have been watching. Um, so let's talk.
Engin Terzi: about some other things so you are basically saying that your power now is at its best ever yeah yeah i think yeah yeah and okay so what do you think about the other matches
Ermes Gasparini: Revaz and Vitalii are an amazing fight. I think it will be a very close fight, 50-50. I think Laletin has more endurance than Revaz.
Engin Terzi: But the power is more advantage Rebas. I understand. I understand. There are some people who are saying, will you be at Devon's corner? No, I will not be on anybody's corner. Listen, guys, these are all arm masters that they train, they get injured, they heal up. I know everything they feel.
Engin Terzi: And I have so much respect. My only duty is to provide a fair competition. And other than that, I don't really care who wins. I mean, better one wins is like how it should be. Whoever is the better, if Devon is better, Devon wins. We say, congratulations, great job. You are the new champion. And if Ermes wins, we're going to say, congratulations, champion. You are still champion.
Engin Terzi: That's all, you know, there is nothing. It's arm wrestling, you know, they will arm wrestle and everyone will get what they deserve. And that's all. There is nothing more to say. Roman says, Ermes fight with t-shirts written, say go. No, Ermes is going to fight with the East versus West t-shirts. Whoa. Ermes compete against Vitalii. Revaz's winner. I don't know what that means. Ermes compete against Vitalii.
Engin Terzi: Oh, okay, Vitalii versus Revaz winner. He's saying that you should compete with the winner of La Liga and Revaz. Yes. Possible? Possible, yeah. For sure it will be end of this year or next year. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
Ermes Gasparini: Yeah, most likely probably end of this year sometime. I think it will be good. And then you want to say something? I'm happy to compete with Devon, really. It's like to compete like John Brzee, more or less. What's that?
Ermes Gasparini: more or less to compete with John Brzezinski, you know, with him. Oh, because he's so legendary? For his history. Oh, okay, okay. So you are saying that you will be playing against one of the best. The best of all time, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I understand. And after this, I'm very curious to feel the power of Devon.
Engin Terzi: to feel very curious, yes. Does he remember after East vs West 5, Pruittnick trying to describe him, how Devon does the set-up, always rise up during the grip? It was a legendary moment. David Pruittnick tell you how Devon was doing after his match?
Ermes Gasparini: He wanted to have a space between your hand and his hand. And he would cover your knuckle. And with this you have a 30% power more. Minimum. This is the same when I fought with Matamasi. Same.
Ermes Gasparini: The first time, same. You can't pull like this. You can't do power with this setup. And I'm very happy to roast with Matt Mark because I learned many things after this. Do you think that all the time talking about your concern, you know,
Engin Terzi: Do you think that you are making mistake that like Devon will be more focusing on these things that you are concerned? Concern? What is it? Like you are worried. It's a mistake for me. Is it mistake that you all the time saying that if he does this, if he does this, you know, like, like, like, is it like you think that you are showing
Engin Terzi: a little weakness by saying that and then Devon will now watch this. OK, he's concerned. I mean, he's going to do whatever he's going to do anyways. But no, no, no. This is it will be shame, my friend. Devon't change nothing. Oh, it's not going to change anything. He will do like this for sure. Another percent. But you are saying that that is his only chance from his side. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: And you are sure that he may not go to inside? He can't. Impossible. Impossible. He cannot hook you or he cannot... If I'm fresh, impossible to hook me. The first round, impossible. Okay, but you were in hook with Jerry. Is it because you hold him low and you wanted to do that, right? Yeah. Okay, okay. Yeah, with Jerry I prepared this
Ermes Gasparini: because to beat him in the hook. It's not hook, it's more side with top row. Do you think that your training for Jerry about this pressure helped you for the Devon match? Yeah. For your side pressure? Yeah, because sometimes when you have
Ermes Gasparini: I think every time when you have a fight with a different style, you will improve something more. Because you change a little bit your training. And with this, after this, you have more power in this position. For the future. Yeah. Yeah, another one.
Engin Terzi: Agent of Chaos. Get Nur Dalet versus Daniel Prokopcik left arm. Nur Dalet's left arm is not really at Daniel's level, in my opinion. But right arm, yes, possible. How often do you guys do table time? Do you do any kind of periodization, Ermes? How do you fit that with table time? How do you do that, like your lifting and table time? Do you have, like,
Engin Terzi: already planned that, you know, you train 10 days and the table time, or you do whenever you want.
Ermes Gasparini: Practicing on the table, I have too much pain after this. I don't need to do table time. You don't like to do table time? No. And Levan, he said too, because after this I have pain in my wrist, in my elbow.
Engin Terzi: And I can't train with a good lift. And for me, this is a problem. Okay. There is my friends. Thank you for your support. And there is Wadi. What is Ermes' favorite cheese for pasta? What kind of cheese do you like for pasta? Parmigiano.
Engin Terzi: And did he try some künefe baklava in Turkey? Cheers. Thank you for your suggestion. You ever ate baklava in Turkey? Amazing. You like it? Like it. Super. Yes. Super amazing. David I take you to eat künefe? Künefe is a dessert. It's hot and it's with cheese underneath. I think we did eat baklava but not the künefe. Next time I will just remind me.
Engin Terzi: Just tell me there is a sweet with cheese. Cheese, okay. Okay, okay. Remind me if it's hot. Paul O'Neill, thanks for the excellence to you both. Thank you very much, my friend. Thank you for your support. Mangee, Thomas messaged me this morning. What?
Ermes Gasparini: I'm very happy to have another Italian with me. Yeah, yeah, it's good. Yeah, it's good. Very good. Thomas Manni is a very good top roller. Very good top roller. This is the first time. He's like a specialist. Yeah, he has a lot of technique here. And he told me he now, the category is... 75.
Engin Terzi: I think he's 75. He said he's now 75 and a half or something. And the other guy, do you know the other guy, Dustin Hyatt? No. He's from the US. He won the East versus West qualifications. And he beat the WAL champion Sam Harris. But Sam Harris is still coming back. And Dustin is very good. Sam Harris, I remember. He was very strong.
Engin Terzi: Sam Harris was very strong. Yeah, this guy in the finals, he beat Sam Harris as far as I remember. He hooked him. His hooking ability to someone in hook, especially in the strap, is very good. So this will be a top role of Thomas Mungy versus the hook of Dustin Harris. So, yeah, we will see. It will be very good. I'm very happy that you guys can be. Maybe his match is first match.
Engin Terzi: Thomas is coming alone, I think. Maybe he would be at your corner as an Italian. Yeah, yeah. You guys are good friends, right? Not too close, but we have a lot of respect for each other. How old is he? Is he the same age as you? I think more.
Engin Terzi: He's older than you? 33? More than me, for sure. And he's an official in army, right? That's what you said? Yeah. Okay, yeah, perfect. That's why the guy is always fit, you know? Yeah, yeah. Good shape, yeah. Army like, yeah. Roman says, did Ermes realize there is a guy called my friend?
Engin Terzi: There is a guy in the chat that is on the super chat. His name is my friend. How do you say in Italian, mia amico? Amico mio. Amico mio, okay. Amico mio, yeah. And if you say amica, you know, amico mia, and then it's woman. Amica mia is woman. Woman, amica mia is woman. Amico mio is man.
Engin Terzi: okay okay okay so when it is ah it's a woman when it's all it's men yeah okay that's good yeah something yes my friend this guy is asking his name is my friend uh please ask ermis what will happen if the match stops what is gonna happen if the mac if the match stops where the man stops
Engin Terzi: Who's this side? Who is this side? Your winning side? Yeah, okay. If it stops, it will be like five centimeters. 92 kilo back pressure, my friend. In one time. Do you realize? Yeah. You can't. Yeah, but when you do the 92 back pressure, your angle was like this.
Engin Terzi: With this angle, you cannot do side pressure. Side pressure you can do with this angle. How many kilos can you do with this angle? That is the thing. 85. You can do seriously? 87. Wow. Then it matters. But still, important is there is no cable. There is something is also pulling your hand. So you need to be careful.
Engin Terzi: Listen, whenever I'm talking with a guest, I talk from the other guy's side, you understand? So there is a super chat. John Dustin, Ermes, my friend, after your match with Devon, will you make him a quality Italian pasta meal? Yeah, I will cook. Cook for him? Yeah. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: to grow his power. So, then a little bit more, it is, yeah, and then finish. Other super matches, Tatachins versus Ibragim Sagov. You know Ibragim Sagov. Okay, the question is, the question is, will Tatachins bicep hold Tatachins shoulder pressure?
Ermes Gasparini: Or do you think that Tadjashvili will go this way so fast that Ibragim won't be able to put his shoulder in the arm? It depends who starts first. Because, you know, it's like Wagner. If we go in the side with the shoulder... It's finished. I think, yeah. Because you can't pull with your arm too open.
Engin Terzi: Semarenko, he pulled it like this, same. So it's all about to start? Yeah. Okay, but if I put... Only John Brzee stopped, you remember Semarenko? Oh, yeah, yeah. When he stopped, like, this was one of the best matches. Yeah, he was like this, and then this, this. This is one of the best. And then Semarenko lifted his elbow, yeah. Yeah, this is one of the best.
Engin Terzi: How old were you then? 13 years old, huh? You were 93? Yeah, 93. Okay, so you were 12 years old then. You were in this league. No, I was not there, yeah. Let's go to Ruslan Mbappé and Pauline. I think Pauline. Pauline means? Because he is more active.
Ermes Gasparini: and he pulled it many times. Ruslan, many years he can't, he don't pull. Many years. But the only thing is that about the athletes that pulled in the past, he is active, he has been training. It's different when he pulls the match like this. What's that? It's difficult to compare training in your home and when you compete.
Ermes Gasparini: this level yeah a completely different time different moments yeah and let's go to another one have you been watching amc yeah
Engin Terzi: David you watch the 85kg? There was a Georgii guy with big arms, vala, Ichqiti, you know? Big, like... He's going to pull against Davit Samushia, but probably you didn't see the... This guy, I don't remember now. What do you think about Artur Makarov at 85kg? Artur is 75kg. But, you know,
Engin Terzi: He didn't want to pull someone like two weight class above. And Adam Wozniacki said he is 90 kilos and he can make 85 kilos. And so Adam Wozniacki has been 85 and Artur 75. How do you see this match? I think it will be close. Close match? Yeah. Very close match. Hmm.
Engin Terzi: uh i don't know if you could difficult to tell who is the favorite people ask me why i don't put uh someone 75 kilo against arthur but the guys at the moment they can pull against him like alan zolev
Engin Terzi: cannot leave Russia right now. And Mindagos, Daniel Prokopchuk, Aydar Khan, they all go to WAF. Like, following me, they have WAF. So they cannot compete here. So there is not many people. There are not many. And Bozidar is injured. I think he's only going with left arm. Anyway, so not many people can pull Artur at 75 kilos. No, no, no. Maybe three people, yeah, in the world, yeah. So...
Engin Terzi: Amazing, Paul. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right. I think he's the best in his category, I think. Yeah, yeah, Alain Zolev, yeah, yeah, yeah, he's very good. And there is another Superchat for you. Jeremy Coleman does Ermes have tattoos? Would he be willing to get a pancake tattoo if he loses and Devon should get a tattoo of pasta when you win? So he says that
Engin Terzi: This guy, Jeremy, is asking you, if you lose, you need to have a pancake tattoo. You know tattoo? Oh, no. And then if Devon loses, he's going to do a pasta tattoo. I don't know tattoo either. Yeah. I don't like tattoo. Yeah. I don't know why. Yeah. And then let's go. Evgeny Prudnyk, David Dadikyan.
Engin Terzi: Left? Yeah. 105 kilo. Anything can happen. On the paper, looks like David looks favorite, but David at the 115 kilo and David at the 105 kilo, may that be the same guy or not? I don't know.
Engin Terzi: If you compare when he fought with Morozov, Dadikyan is the favourite. But maybe with 10 less kilos... But just remember, Morozov had an injury, he couldn't hook, so he only had to go outside, while Krutnik is going to go only inside, because David's hand is very strong, very hard to topple him, so I think Evgeny is going to go... I think he's 50-50.
Engin Terzi: He will win with who he is. I have more endurance in this match. Oh, okay. So you are thinking that Prudnyk is going to stop him? Yeah, yeah, yeah. He will stop him? For sure. For sure. And Irakli versus David? 105 kilos. Amazing fight. People look at the practice pool, but the practice pool doesn't always represent the truth. No.
Ermes Gasparini: I think a little bit David. David? Because his hand is super strong. Really super strong. Yeah, and in the straps it's very hard to open if you don't... If the power of your back pressure is a lot,
Ermes Gasparini: you can't open. But it's close, it's very difficult to open someone who has a lot of power in the hand. You understand? Yeah, I understand. We will see. Ivan Matyushenko, David Arabuli, left arm. Do you know David Arabuli? Yeah, left arm, I don't see nothing about him. David's left arm is stronger than his right arm. Really? Yeah.
Ermes Gasparini: But Matyushenko... Also a very strong left-hander. He played with the Danes, you remember? Yeah, yeah, training. Training, yeah. Training, yeah, but Danes... My favourite, Matyushenko, because he has many more history matches. Experience? Yeah, yeah. I think he's the best hooker in the world. Hooker like to close...
Engin Terzi: your wrist. Yeah, to get the position. A hooker like when he closes immediately for the top roller, I think he's the best for this. Let's say he has the best hooking ability. Yeah. Do you know the real meaning of hooker in English? Mean?
Engin Terzi: the the meaning meaning of the hooker in english do you know what it means no so it doesn't sound so good so maybe best hook puller just say it that way not hooker but still you know you can say hooker just check it after the after the okay yeah if i write hooker and then if it is automatically translated to turkish
Engin Terzi: then people are asking me, okay, what's going on and why you write this to me? I don't know. Yeah, yeah. Everybody say the hooker. Hook puller. Yeah, hook puller is better. Hooker, I mean, you can say hooker too, but I'm just saying, you know, just like... I heard every time hooker like this. Okay, yeah.
Ermes Gasparini: Okay, never mind. Ferit Osmanlı versus Gyorgy Dzeranov. Right hand. Right, right. Yeah. I show Dzeranov now he's super amazing strong. Yeah? In the gym. And I show Ferit and last event was not very good shape. Yeah. I think Dzeranov is the favorite.
Engin Terzi: Zeno is the favorite? Yeah. Yeah. There is another super chat. John Augustin Ermes, my friend, will you eat pancakes with some maple syrup with Devon after the match? Maybe we'll give you even more power. No, like pasta, my friend.
Ermes Gasparini: Pancakes have pasta. Pasta is bigger than pancakes, right? After two hours, when the digestion is going out, you feel too powerful.
Engin Terzi: And Jeremy Coleman, of course, it would just be an excuse for Devon to get a new tattoo. I'm just joking around, but I'm super excited for the match. Love both of you guys. Thank you, Jeremy. Thank you. And then Derek Smith versus Mehdi. You know Mehdi from Ivan? Yeah. And he is very beautiful. In the hook, Mehdi will win, for sure. The hook. Okay, in the hook, Mehdi wins.
Ermes Gasparini: Yeah. Can he get hook? Can he get him in hook? The wrist is not very super strong, I remember. I think... I think Derek is a little bit favorite. Derek is favorite? 55 like this.
Engin Terzi: Do you know Brett Grundy? I still don't know. I think from Florida. He won the East vs West finals in the US to be qualified. He will be pulling against Kyle Hutchison from England. Do you know Kyle? Kyle? Kyle Hutchison, yeah.
Engin Terzi: Maybe you remember, he had like an unofficial supermatch with Larry Wills in Dubai. He was going and Larry was just opening like this. The guy was going hook from England or Ireland, I think. But from Great Britain, you know, yeah. Maybe if I see the photo, I remember. So, last match, Dustin versus Thomas. Who is winning? Thomas.
Engin Terzi: Because he eats pasta more than... Pasta, Italian quality, 99%. 99%. Okay. Anyways, thank you, my friend. Thank you too, my friend. Before we close, I want to say to the community that to secure that this dream will not end, trust me, is better than six months later
Ermes Gasparini: this dream finishing and we all are divided to the different parts. Yeah, this is the best way to be together, to have this super fight. In the past there were only dreams, now we are inside this dream. Before we grow up in our sport, we need to be together. Yeah, we need to be together. Absolutely, we need to be together.
Ermes Gasparini: And maybe we don't know in the future, maybe in two, three years, five years, we could continue to grow up like UFC. We don't know. Now for this, this is the best safe way is this, to be together. Yeah, that's the most important thing. I will tell you something. If these athletes go, five go there,
Engin Terzi: Five goes there, four goes there. Trust me. The interest of arm wrestling, rise of arm wrestling will go down like this. You understand? To make sure that to put them all together and secure this. You understand? And this is also a huge investment and big risk. We don't know what's going to happen in the future. It's a big risk. And if there is anyone who loves arm wrestling and risk to do this, then people...
Engin Terzi: should respect this because this atlas this is what they want as well they want together they don't want to be there there they're there they want to be together and they want to see who is really best instead of three are there and i'm the best and three are there i'm the best three are there i'm the best and then
Engin Terzi: the fans will say, oh, my favorite arm master would beat you. But they can never pull against each other. So they just do imaginary pulls. So the last 10, 15 years of arm wrestling was a drama. If the Eastern guys are better, the Western guys are better, or Devon is better, or this guy is better. Now they need to understand that. Now we can see the reality, who is the strongest.
Ermes Gasparini: who can see super fights like Devon with Gennady. You remember how many times they said, we want to see this fight for 10 years, maybe more. But it never happened. It never happened. Now there are many, many super fights. And the community loves them too much.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't understand how it can be something negative to make sure that these athletes are all together, you know? And then anyone who invests this match and take risk, of course they will try to secure these athletes to, I mean, commit, you know? Instead of just going there, if you have a match for him, then he gets injured somewhere else, you understand? He can be injured here too, but...
Ermes Gasparini: He who will speak, we will talk bad for this is not normal. If there is someone who doesn't understand this, it's because he's jealous or there are some problems inside. These people are thinking that they know what is better
Engin Terzi: for Levan, Ermes, this, John, this, and that, you know, they think that they are like parents like this, and these athletes are either like mentally disabled people, or they are like kids that they don't know what is best for the sport, and they don't know what is best for them, and they just go like, oh, this is terrible. But not everyone has bad intention. Some has bad intention because jealous, but some has, they don't understand. They just think that
Engin Terzi: This way will be like five years ago. No, this is set opposite way. We are doing this so not to return back to five years ago. Because during the pandemic, you realize, okay, during the pandemic, when all the measures, organizations, they stopped, who took risk? Who put their hands under the stone? You know, king of the table and east versus west. That is the reality. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's the reality.
Ermes Gasparini: and now when it is growing and they are saying that no we need to be separated again not unified no my friend this is we are already together and the athletes they want this because i talk with many athletes all all everybody want this if there are someone don't don't want this ways because you have some problem inside the
Engin Terzi: in his mind. Kirsten, I wish you the best, my friend, next week. Great interview, Engin. Ermes, amazing win against Jerry. Take care, guys. Thank you, my friend. And one more chat. Jeremy Coleman, and then we finish. I am sure Ermes prefers handmade pasta, but does Ermes have a favorite brand of pasta? We need to get them as a sponsor of
Engin Terzi: Yeah. Seriously, yeah. You have like so many fans now. If you say that this pasta is good, they are going to buy that pasta. That company needs to sponsor you.
Engin Terzi: yeah they need to give you every month every month five ten ten thousand dollars you know and then you need to start your your videos with the short clip that company yeah this is the best pasta and you need to be in the clip yeah anyways guys thank you guys very very much for following just be sure about my friend what's that
Engin Terzi: I want to be, to put some scare. You want to say something? Look. You look or not? I mean, I look at, but why you get so smaller compared to... What? I mean, yeah. Listen, what's happening to you, seriously? You started to not to eat anything? What's happening to you? Look at this. Ermes is always like this. If I say something, he shows again, you know?
Engin Terzi: Engin, look at, listen, Ermes, next time you come here, buy me glasses. Say that, Engin, you're getting old. Your eyes don't see very well. Yeah. Do you have a last message for your opponent? Just look into the camera. This is the message. This is the message for Devon? Yeah. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: Do you think that Devon should have some kind of insurance for his arms? Or you will be easy on him? It's better, yeah, it's better. But with a lot of money inside for insurance if you have some pain. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Anyways, one last thing I want to say before I thank you, Ermes. Guys, arm wrestling is in safe hands. You understand? I'm not talking about myself only.
Engin Terzi: I'm talking about all the top athletes. Trust me, we all have one main goal to bring this support to the level. We are not there yet. This is only a step. We need to be at the level of USC. The other day I was talking with John Burzy. He said that Engin, the people who does the kids, who does the martial arts are more than
Engin Terzi: Sorry, less than the kids who arm wrestle. So there are a lot of kids arm wrestle. So future of arm wrestling is bright. And we are going to bring this to the level all together, fans and the athletes, promoters, all together. Nobody is doing anything by himself.
Engin Terzi: And then we're going to give it to the next level. And then it will be the production level, everything level. It will be like a UFC level because there are some people who does this better than we do. But to show them and to the world that we deserve to be there, we need to stay united. Yeah. If we get again separated there, there, there, there, nobody is going to take us seriously.
Engin Terzi: We are not that big yet. Maybe someday when we get so big, there may be two, three organizations, there can still be organizations today. But just trust in my what I say that all the top Atlas, we need to secure them to be together. And nobody is forcing anyone, these guys are coming to the level of professionalism. Not long ago, there was
Engin Terzi: Slotitur was the best professional event. People were covering their own expenses and going there for $700 first place win, my friend. Yeah, it was great. Slotitur is great. Yeah, yeah. It was very good. But you need to accept that armwrestling is in another level. Whatever the thing that, I shouldn't say money, but the top eight guys made, today there are many guys are making money
Engin Terzi: double than that just trust me you understand in a year so it is going this level just support this idea just think that understand that people who thinks who acts like you know they are thinking of sports those are the ones in fact you know is trying to stop this dream just believe in what i say i've never done anything in arm wrestling that would harm harm arm wrestling
Engin Terzi: Armwrestling is like I owe to armwrestling. I gave my life to armwrestling, and I wouldn't do anything wrong to armwrestling and all the armwrestlers. You all take care, and thank you very much, Ermes. Thank you. You are a superstar. If there are people who are smart enough to think about this, there are no problems. Who don't understand this issue is because they have a problem inside, a big problem. That's it.
Engin Terzi: But not all of them, my friend, not all of them. Some of them doing that intentionally. Yeah, yeah. But the reason I'm talking is that maybe they don't want to, they want to do another organization or they want to. It is good. It is good. If they can provide all these actors together, let them do it. Yeah. If they can secure this. Yeah. But if a year from now on, if we are again apart like this, this, this, this, this,
Engin Terzi: then, you understand, that is not something that we want. No, no, no. Anyways, I want to tell you one more thing that you, your passion, your fire, like when we go to the war force, we don't see, you understand, many old Western European guys with like going like head to head with the Eastern guys, with the Georgii, Russians and Kazakhs.
Engin Terzi: And you showed, you know, all those years, we saw you at the stage, one Italian guy, Western Europe, and just like going head to head with them, beating them, you understand? We saw that. And now I knew that that wasn't your dream. I saw that there are some people, they're just armless. There are some people that they have so much
Engin Terzi: dreams inside of them they just they just they just like how you just remember semerenko jungles and everything yeah i'm sure you just all your childhood was watching all those guys and you dream dream dream and now hermes oh you're number one yeah if i think like this uh we cry really really because it's too much uh it's a very big dream
Ermes Gasparini: Yeah, it's very normal. If you cry, I understand you. It's not that you are showing... Yeah, yeah. This is your dream. I'm not scared to cry. Nothing. There are some emotions inside. It's very difficult to explain this. Every time when I win, I feel something incredible. Incredible moments. And, you know, maybe I have a message to John Brasing. He messaged me.
Ermes Gasparini: or now with Devon or like you. Devon't count me. You and I, we message every day. Yeah, it's incredible. Incredible. Yeah, it's good. Yeah, it's good. Yeah, I'm happy. I was born with my father to be a champion, you know. Yeah.
Ermes Gasparini: And with my family right now, my father is super mega happy. I'm proud of you. Yeah. Everything is super now. Yeah. Yeah. I believe in dreams. I like people dreaming like very big and trying to fulfill it. Now, even Devon, now he has chance to become
Engin Terzi: super heavyweight champion he's 48 years old he has the heavyweight title he wants to do this yesterday i said devon can you believe that if you win you have two titles he said why two titles maybe three titles and now i'm like oh he wants to go down on garber beat him as well see i love that this is the most important thing to have inside this is the most important things yeah
Engin Terzi: You want to do something that is not done before. You want to do more than what you did before. You want to do something bigger, you know, and bigger. Because can you imagine that his motivation? Do you see that? Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's talking about three titles. Then how can you not respect? You win or not. But to have such a goal, just like big respect, big respect. Yeah, yeah. Really, I have a lot of respect.
Ermes Gasparini: about Devon, now we have fights like this, but he did a lot for armwrestling, a lot, a lot, because... Yeah, yeah. If armwrestling today has so many fans, it is minimum 50% is Devon alone. For sure. This is for sure. He's amazing. He went everywhere to promote our sport, so many, many years. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Engin Terzi: Like for example, if Devon, I mean like Devon, there is no like anything restricted, you know, he can go seminars, he can, he pulls, he pulls left arm. He continues to post videos on YouTube, training. This is the best way to promote. He can do the television things and the documentary, whatever. To limit Devon is murdering. Let this guy be himself, you know? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Engin Terzi: because because once you limit him you are harming our mercy you need to let this yeah yeah yeah as he told you yeah yeah you know anyways we talk too much once again oh there is one last thing because i i will be he will be this is philip williams would you consider all main events to be six matches i need to talk i will sit down we talk with the whole that all atlas and then we can decide at the end we need to do a
Engin Terzi: common title with king of the table we need to do common ranking because there are matches here are matches how can you not consider the matches happening there and like how can you not consider the matches happening here and there needs to be titled or do you guys want to have two titles i wouldn't want it i would want there is one unified title you know and then the title match doesn't matter can be in there can be there yeah i don't have a problem as long as you know
Engin Terzi: we don't look un-serious to the rest of the world. I want it to be united. Anyways, Ermes, thank you very much. And thanks to everyone who has been watching us. And then make your arms bigger like mine. Yours is so small. Take care, man. Take care.
