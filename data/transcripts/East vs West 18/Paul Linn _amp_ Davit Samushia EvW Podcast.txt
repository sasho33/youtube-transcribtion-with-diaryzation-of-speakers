SPEAKER_01: Hello, hello, Paul. Hey, give me one second. Let me fix my audio. Okay, we are live, but okay, I will wait. Yeah, one sec, one sec. Okay, okay, no problem. Good to see you. Good to see you too. It's been too long. Yes, yes, yes, yes.
SPEAKER_01: Is that audio better? What's that? Is that audio a little bit better? I know if I don't use headphones, if I don't put that earbud in, my audio is usually bad. Not bad, not bad. I understand everything. Is it better than Ivan Matyshenko's yesterday?
SPEAKER_03: How are you? Good, good, good. Seriously, it's good to see you and it will be very good to see you in Istanbul. How long has it been since we didn't see each other? I don't know. Don't tell me it has been a year. Has it been a year or something? No, it can't have been a year. It couldn't have been a year. You sure? I don't know. It could. Listen, you didn't come to the November events last year. And then you were in the August event, but I wasn't there.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, right, yeah, yeah. And you were not in July events. Were you? Were you in the Devon versus Levan events? No. So we... Yeah, no, no, no, I wasn't. So probably we saw each other maybe East versus West XI.
SPEAKER_01: beginning of the last year so i think so it is like 15 months we didn't see each other everything's moved so fast that it feels like yesterday but i'm glad to be coming back to istanbul i miss it i mean yeah yeah same same i'm strangely strangely comfortable there
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, yeah, yeah, you should be. That is like, really, it is always good to see you. But as you said, you know, like, we have done a lot of things all together that, like, I don't even like, like,
SPEAKER_03: Like I don't, I lost the time, you understand? Like when was what, you know, like, I don't even remember like exactly, you know, I know the dates, but just, I can't measure the time that first time you pulled Samusha. I think it was East versus West 3, or it was like May, May 2022. Yeah. But I could say it was,
SPEAKER_03: Five years ago, I don't know. Like it feels like, you know. Yeah. Well, everything, everything's been nonstop since the beginning. I mean, pretty much from East versus West two on it's been nonstop, right? Yeah. Yeah. It's been like every couple months. Yeah. Yeah. And now, now since Robert get involved, so it is like now every six weeks and that we are heavily.
SPEAKER_03: involved you know it is yeah but this is this is going very good you know uh oh yeah and it's it's amazing it's amazing how far it's come already you know
SPEAKER_01: When you think about the beginning and the first one that was crowdfunded, you know, like during COVID, it feels like COVID. Like, it feels like that was like five years, you know, I guess it has been five years, but it feels like forever ago, but it also feels like yesterday, you know? Yeah. It's like, it's almost like weird, weird, weird. Like, I mean, sometime it looks like yesterday. Sometime it looks like it was decade ago. I don't know. I don't know. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: So, some people think that now Samusha improved a lot. And I try to tell them that yes, but also all improved a lot. Hello, Roman. Hello, guys. Hello. What's up, Roman? How you doing, buddy? Hello, Paul.
SPEAKER_04: Doing great, but a long time no see. I know, that's what we were just talking about. It's been too long, huh? It feels like yesterday, but it feels like forever. Yeah, yeah, man. I mean, time flies. We progress and we miss each other. Roman, have you reached Tamusha? I've sent him a message and I'm waiting. I'm sure he will join us. I sent him a message. He saw the link. He saw the link, but I don't know when he's coming, but...
SPEAKER_03: So, Pauline, your match with Rustem Babaev was very, very good, and that is the match that you surprised me the most. When I say surprised, it's not about winning or losing, but usually
SPEAKER_03: The Paul, we know that either wins, you know, in offensive position and then like not in the match if the match is long. But that was a match that you went back and forth. Yeah. But...
SPEAKER_03: We couldn't see the same thing against Krasimir. I mean, you still gave him some trouble. You were, again, as expected, you were offensive. But is it because 95 kilos is more of your category than 105? Well, I don't want to say that completely. I think the version of Krasimir that's pulling right now, after seeing him pull against Frank Lamparelli and just talking to him about his practice.
SPEAKER_01: His prep for Todd, I think a lot of people during that match had me as the favorite just based off of Lachlan and my match. And I think that I knew that was skewed data coming into it. And I think that Krasimir, you know, trained really, really hard for Todd. And, you know, after talking to him, he was disappointed with that outcome and continued to train really, really hard. And I think, you know, I think that his next match...
SPEAKER_01: Yes, I think like I think like I don't want to take anything away from him and say like, you know, I'm better at 95. That's not an excuse I would be willing to make. I just think his form right there was really good. And I also I learned a lot from that match without getting into a whole bunch of detail.
SPEAKER_01: His prep for me and his style that he kind of set up and loaded with was not what I was prepared for. I misjudged like the areas to focus on. And I was on Sunday morning.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, he out prepared me. You know, in my opinion, I think he took the right road. I took the wrong road. And I think he flat out out arm wrestled me. And I also think that his I have a I have a pretty good hunch that he is going to be trouble for people that people don't expect coming up here shortly.
SPEAKER_01: And I even spoke to Rustam about it right after the match. And he was like, I had a feeling you were going to have a stylistic issue with Krasimir. And he said, because he has had that same stylistic issue with Krasimir. And we have, and Rustam and I have some similarities in, you know,
SPEAKER_01: In our attack plan. So yeah, no, I think Krazy is the man and it was awesome. But I didn't, I was never able to access anything where I felt like I could really work. He just neutralized me.
SPEAKER_03: I mean, for sure, you know, he's very experienced. First time I saw him, I mentioned this before, many times, it was 2006, Manchester, he was a junior player, he was 18 years old, and he won that world title in junior category. So he has been around for 17 years. And
SPEAKER_03: Shortly after that event, he started to be very competitive in the seniors. And yeah, yeah, he's very experienced. You know, whenever we remember the athletes that he has defeated, like Gennady, like Levan, John Brzezink, you know, and some other greats, Arsene Lidia. And so he is incredible. But I think he's coming back to his best shape again.
SPEAKER_01: i think so too i i really think he's he's trending back up you know we talked about in the lead up like the peaks and valleys that every arm wrestler goes through for whatever reason maybe it's injury maybe it's life situations maybe it's you know ability to commit time to training whatever those things may be um
SPEAKER_01: Like every great arm wrestler, there are ebbs and flows in your path. And I think that he is in one of those flows where he is on his way up. And I think he's going... I'm very anxious to see him pull
SPEAKER_01: in the future against some of the top guys, especially inside. I'd really like to see him and Rustam maybe at a catchweight. That to me is kind of like a fantasy match for me. If I get to pick things, that's one I'd like to see. Did you know that they have pulled in the past? I think they pulled at the Seneca. Seneca probably 15 years ago around that time.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it's been a while, right? Rustam top-rolled him. Yes. Yeah, Rustam and outside, yeah. Yeah, and that's interesting to me. I'd like to see, you know, if that would even be something that came into play, you know? Mm-hmm. Or if that lane was even available now for Rustam. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_03: I don't know. Rustam seems like he's a great hook puller, which is true. I cannot say enough good words about Rustam. Trust me, he can do some other things as well. He can do straight side pressure, he can do top roll, he can go deep inside.
SPEAKER_01: rustam is no doubt you know just just a legend you know and customer is the same yeah yeah and that that's a match that i'm looking forward to on this card big time him and him and todd rematch like i think that's going to be awesome because i i think rustam is you know when he came back into east versus west he was coming off a hiatus you know and i think every single match that he has pulled since then he has looked notably better
SPEAKER_01: whether he was right yeah whether whether he was opposed really hard or not i think he you know even his last match against sandras was so one-sided you know and i thought like i i had him pick to win but i didn't think that would happen the one-sided i i didn't it was no disrespect to sundries but it was easy you know and it is because rusham didn't make any mistake and rusham
SPEAKER_03: attack to right lane, Rustam is close to perfect about pulling. Everything. It's like poetry, like what he does. Yeah. You don't meet someone like Rustam often because he's a special one. Yeah. Yeah, we will see. We will see. But the categories are getting tougher, huh? Absolutely. Every single event.
SPEAKER_01: every single event somebody new shows up and shakes everything up the young guys are coming into their own the rest of us old guys trying to hang on come on you you in my book you are not old guy because i know i know you you are maybe your model is old but the the mileage is very
SPEAKER_03: Little. Not very little, but maybe like 10 years. How long have you been involved in armwrestling? 10 years? No, like eight, almost nine. Yeah. Nine years you are in armwrestling and you manage to win the East vs. World title, your improvement is really a success story, you know. It doesn't matter, you know, like if you are not champion right now or something, but
SPEAKER_01: So, like, how much you progress is seriously amazing. Like, you wanna... Yeah, I've been talking a lot with Uncle Todd Hutchings. You know, he's such an inspiration, you know, in that, you know, we started at the same age and that he truly believes that he's getting better and that he has five, ten more years. So, it...
SPEAKER_01: To me, it feels like... How many years? 5 to 10. He says 5 to 10 legitimately. I don't think he's joking. He's like, my numbers are moving steadily and I'm getting better and I'm not going anywhere until I stop getting better. Imagine him being 68 years old and pulling up for a title match against a 25 years old. It would be...
SPEAKER_03: if he stays healthy, knock on wood, nothing bad happens, like, that's a legitimate possibility for that guy. You know? But listen, yes, I know it is possible, but when you think about it, like, someone, just say, 65 years old, and
SPEAKER_01: like good enough to go a title match or something. It is just unbelievable, you know, like. Well, so we've been digging into, you know, his conjugate method in Westside Barbell. And he's been calling me, you know, a dummy for years for not committing myself to it.
SPEAKER_01: And I've always like kind of told myself that side pressure training was like the ace up my sleeve that I didn't need to use yet. So I never traditionally trained side pressure at all. I train every aspect of arm wrestling except for side pressure, mainly just for joint health. And so I can continue to do the other general strength things. And he's been on me for years and making fun of me for not doing it. And...
SPEAKER_01: after the krasimir match i committed wholeheartedly to his style and the conjugate method so i really like yeah an individualistic program for for my needs based off of his recommendation so since the krasimir match it's been full-blown um full-blown conjugate method todd style and i've adapted a little bit but like what i've noticed is you know it kills your elbows because the volume
SPEAKER_01: And the intensity, but over the course of like four to six weeks, my elbows now feel better than ever. So it's interesting that I think the longevity that he has in the sport may actually be associated to his style of training that a lot of people think is detrimental.
SPEAKER_01: so it this is an experiment for me i told him i've had to pull back on some of my main gym lifts and i'm tracking those numbers less like my just general strength stuff and i'm tracking the side pressure and these one rep maxes on on the table a lot a lot a lot more closely and it's been like i said it's been interesting my numbers have steadily been going up and my elbow feels good so we'll see maybe that's the way maybe he wrote the best plan i don't know
SPEAKER_03: When will you move to super heavyweight? Never. Never. My wife will leave me. The French Ripper. What do you think of pickup versus Burzing for last match?
SPEAKER_03: John Bersink just had surgery for his back and DB talks, Paul, last time you faced Samusha, you were 100 kg and he was 87 kg. That match was close. With the weight being the same now, can you still beat him? Okay, before Paul answers that,
SPEAKER_03: Someone should just share the picture, maybe four days ago, and he said he's 88 kilos, so probably he's going to end up 90, 91 kilos, while Paul will be 95. Yeah, it will not be the same, but still, I think that since Paul cannot make 85 kilos, that was the only possibility. Do you agree to meet at 95 kilos?
SPEAKER_01: yeah I mean like so honestly the version of me that showed up um that first match at 100 kilograms I'm I'm weighing less than that now um mainly because I want to focus on that 95 and I really want to make the cuts as efficient as possible so I'm walking around maybe 97 98 and
SPEAKER_01: i think that i'm stronger um i know that i'm a better arm wrestler i can't say that i'm gonna win uh but i'm gonna do my best for sure so i i think we we'll definitely be closer in weight this time for sure um and i think really it depends on samusha whether he wants to really just dip his toes into the 95 category or if he's bored with 85 and he wants to scale up and uh enter that class completely as to you know how close we are in weight
SPEAKER_04: I think he wants to continue. What's that? Yeah, sorry, if I may. I have a quick question on this regard. By the way, Samusha is trying to join in just to update you guys. Paul, were you really 100 kilograms? Because I think you were almost there, but not as heavy as there was in the comment. That's the first thing. And second thing, your match ended up very interesting to me because it was not a clean sheet. It was like sided and here and there, like one...
SPEAKER_04: one oh then one one two and we all know so the question is um obviously that was samushia's first match at the uh this east versus west right and since then he showed us that he can do different styles like versatility wise yeah especially this dead with uh press that he turned out to have a good one in my opinion my question is after you were done with uh the victory against him since then do you feel
SPEAKER_04: that you have uh how can i say learned the key to defeat him or you still think that um since his first match which was against you he progressed and you need to adapt to it you needed to adapt to it up until this time so i think there's no i don't have a key um i think
SPEAKER_01: i think so both of us that being our first match that was um you know uncharted territory for us both of us and with the beat coming you know coming back into the game after a layoff and everything and that being my first outing we neither of us really knew what to expect other than looking at what you know what had been on film prior and i i don't like
SPEAKER_01: i think at that point i just saw him as mainly a deep inside puller and you know game plan was less in depth than the information that i have now because obviously we've seen him make a huge run and pull a bunch of different ways uh that said i don't see like i don't look at the beat and say like okay there is an area of of um
SPEAKER_01: weakness that can be exploited. We've seen him do everything we've seen him do. We've seen him show a huge heart. Like, no, I don't have like a point that I can zero in on. Like, I have a game plan, but I didn't find anything that, oh, my goodness, there's this weakness. I have to exploit the guy. I don't think the guy has a weakness.
SPEAKER_03: I'm reading the comments here, so I'm asking for a double bicep. Yeah, let me read that. John Augustine says, give us a bicep flex, Captain America, the white orc for the win. And yeah. And so, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: You asked if Paul was 100 kilo. Yes, he was 100 kilo. Was he 100? Yeah, yeah. Because at that time, our categories were different as far as I remember. And I think it was Paul's first East versus West as well, you know. You were not there in East versus West. Yeah, I was 100. And the weird part of that, too, is I didn't know how the weigh-ins were going to happen. Like, miscommunication between Engin and I. So I cut the weight.
SPEAKER_01: I only had like two or three pounds to cut, like not a lot, but I did like a water load and everything. And I didn't drink anything. And I got off the plane and drove there and I thought I was weighing in right away. And I was like confused about it. And then I was like, oh, I don't know what's going on. Maybe we're not weighing in. Who knows what's going on. So I ate some food and then I had to cut again.
SPEAKER_01: So I was definitely 100. I think that was agreed upon weight. But I don't think... Yeah, it was 100 kilos. I agree. Yeah, it was 100 kilos. My shape wasn't better then than it is now. No, no, no. It was still beginning of your professional career. I know you have pulled...
SPEAKER_03: some events, but East vs West level is a bit different. It's more international than the ones that you... A bit, you say. A bit different. Yeah, because I cannot say a lot because there are some great players over there as well, you know. But yeah, about Samusha...
SPEAKER_03: you talk about the dead wrist um i don't know which style paul is gonna pull but paul that i know really hits your pronators so hard with his wrist that that's what he does he hit here so hard that
SPEAKER_03: Unless Paul goes totally out, I don't think David will have any opportunity to do that risk because that is what Paul does, pushing this position. He attacks there. You need to be someone like Irakli to really stop Paul's attack.
SPEAKER_01: I don't think the key to beating Samusha is top rolling him. I think we've learned that through some of the matches. You need to control his pronation. Even if you go outside, you shouldn't overpronate. Once you overpronate,
SPEAKER_03: then you will be vulnerable for that. Even you go outside, you have the pronator, but you need to also block his pronator, so then you can beat. Once you do this, then you are not getting any support from your bicep, and you are not having that elbow joint that you can use ulna and radius at the same time. Like once you turn that way, you are not using ulna anymore. You don't have that.
SPEAKER_03: You are using 50% of your elbow joint for the pressure. How much can you press that way if there was a cable machine? How much can you press that way? I mean, we saw exactly that breakdown happen against Sasha.
SPEAKER_01: you know and a great great match i love that match samusha has pulled in several of my favorite matches that i've ever been in in person for and uh that sasho match was exactly that yeah i couldn't believe that that match wound up there and i couldn't believe how it finished from there yeah it was yeah do you know where samusha
SPEAKER_04: He's multiple times trying to send, then he's switching the devices. He's having a hard time to join. Even though I sent him the same link, you also sent him, I'm sure. He says that he's working on it. He wants to change. He's changing the phone now. Sometimes you can copy the link and paste it in the browser. Sometimes that works. I've had that problem before too.
SPEAKER_03: No, I will tell him also that one as a hint. He told me to give him like three or five minutes. He wants to, he needs to log in in their new device and stuff. But I'm constantly messaging with him. Yeah, is asking in case he defeats, who is next for Paul? I mean, I don't think that is like, I think it's early to talk what's next. But what do you think? I have no idea.
SPEAKER_01: no idea whatever whatever seriously enough serious enough opponent to yeah your 100 focus i i have never in my life planned one like more than one match ahead or more than one game ahead i think it's a flaw i think it gets more tricky when you're approaching the top
SPEAKER_01: you know in any sport if you start preparing or giving mind space to the next match you you you subconsciously give away some of your focus on what you have next on your plate i've always i've always been a big believer you do everything in life one one at a time yeah i mean yeah yeah for sure yeah i mean you may have a main goal which is winning title but yeah
SPEAKER_03: Sometimes you know how close you are to a title match. For example, in your case, beating Samusha is not going to give you the next match title match, but you need to beat someone between you and the title holder. Because Samusha is new in this category. Yeah, there's no rush for me.
SPEAKER_01: um michael todd and i close friends we talk a lot you know and i think we've we've talked about where he fits into the pecking order and you know i think you know in some of his his looming matches it's dangerous to think about you know
SPEAKER_01: What happens when I win or what happens if I lose? What's the next one? Where's the next path? When you get close like Mike, it can be a tricky catch 22 where you want to focus as much as humanly possible on that next match and worry as little as possible about what comes after it. But when you're at the top like that, it's so easy to fall into like, okay, the what if scenarios.
SPEAKER_01: and the reality of it is whether you win or lose things usually wind up working out and your path winds up setting itself for you anyway so for me it's been better to like just be reactive take them one at a time i'm thankful for where i'm at you know uh and i'm thankful for the opportunities that are there in front of me right now and we'll see what comes later okay so till till um
SPEAKER_03: Until Samusha comes, maybe we can start having your predictions. Paul, honestly, you don't have to make me happy. But do you think the card is good? Oh, dude, like...
SPEAKER_03: I will tell you something. It looks like I'm trying to satisfy my ego, but it's not. Do you know how it is? I like to make community happy. I like to prepare those cards. Even when I'm making, I'm thinking, oh, people will love it. People will enjoy it. I do it with love. Whenever I see people like it, I'm very happy.
SPEAKER_01: I, you know, I see the new matches coming out and being announced, and I can just envision this scenario where Robert and Dexter are like, no more matches, no more.
SPEAKER_03: this is too like i can just imagine those conversations happening like should we put them all on this card or should we save this one for later uh no i i don't discuss i don't discuss uh with dexter but i know with robert robert yeah we we we talked about it and
SPEAKER_03: And Robert is thinking that the event needs to be shorter, which from one side I agree, but from other side, if you have a league, international league, you need to give athletes matches, especially if you have contract with them. You know that there are some certain number of matches that we promised and we know that
SPEAKER_03: some of these athletes can't get visa for US events. So while the event is over here, that athletes don't have visa problems, we need to give matches to those athletes. So we ended up agreeing with Roberts, 12 matches. Originally,
SPEAKER_03: It was like 10 matches, you know, what I and Robert agreed, you understand? And Robert knows that if it is up to me, it would go 15, 16, 17, it would go. And then it has gone to 15 already. I have done 17 in Orlando. Paul knows. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. But I'll tell you the important caveat to that that I think we need to think about from the big picture is now on the pay-per-view, you have a DDR function.
SPEAKER_01: meaning you can fast forward and rewind. So I can't tell you how many times I've had to jump on to the event late. And now I'm getting spoilers mid-event, you know, through Facebook and everywhere else of who won. Now I can hop on that thing and I can rewind it. And if I don't want to watch a long setup, I can fast forward it. So if you're one of those people that complains about Devin setting up for three hours, well, you can fast forward.
SPEAKER_01: So, to me, I can take that four-hour event and I can cut out any downtime or commercials or whatever. They're dead space. And now I'm in control of it. I can make it two hours if I want to. So, there's not really a complaint on it being too long anymore because the fan or the person, the viewer is in control.
SPEAKER_03: Like, from my point of view, I do empathy with the athletes, you understand? When I know the athletes are waiting for match, so it is like, it kills me to disappoint anyone. So that is like, that is my side, you know. Okay, Zurab versus Tautier. That is, number one, I've been waiting to see Zurab back. I'm ecstatic, you know, I've
SPEAKER_01: i've been over there with these guys so many times that i've become friends and fans of them i think the match itself is super interesting but i don't know how much everybody's been following zurab's training he looks enormous yeah his arm his arm looks bigger than his quad his upper leg um he's been on a hiatus and i know yeah i i
SPEAKER_01: i know i know the guy's motivation level i think stylistically it's a really interesting match and it's going to probably be tough for zurab to keep his hand um but we know he can pull without his wrist too so i i'm i'm looking for that one to be a war i'll be rooting for zurab for sure but i think that could that's that's the type of match that could steal the show
SPEAKER_03: Yeah. Um, okay. Sanka says that I like Robert 20% less now because he's pushing for shorter events. No, no, no, no. My friend Robert is the one Robert Robert is a hero.
SPEAKER_03: You know, Robert is the one that when we needed to do U.S. events, he's the one that he stepped in, you know, by leaving some other businesses just for the love of arm wrestling. The reason he wants to do a little bit shorter, he thinks that, and I think he's right, that if you want to make the arm wrestling a mainstream sport, he says that the events cannot be that long, you know. And so...
SPEAKER_03: that is not because he doesn't want many matches or something and yeah so anyway so yeah yeah he's joking he's joking that's just that he that's just robert oh okay i don't i don't want people to have like miss misunderstanding about robert's intention yeah turker mehmet han says what is his analysis about levan versus rematch elmas rematch but we're gonna go there but not
SPEAKER_03: Now we will go later to those predictions. Paul, just remember last match and make sure your endurance is on point because you need to be ready for the long game I believe. We are all rooting for you here and you can win this.
SPEAKER_01: yeah that that's been a focus uh and again i was telling angan beforehand i've shifted training styles again um and i've kind of you know hutchings pulls on the table three times a week um and i've i've started doing that as well so yeah i mean i can see that you are looking more i don't know maybe i'm mistaken but like you look more how say not like
SPEAKER_03: muscle built and i think your weight is also agreeing with me when you say like 97 usually you're like over 100 kilo and cutting hard to 95 now you look like more translated to armless in your physical shape
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I think that that's what I was hoping to get out of it. And, you know, number one, I mean, the side pressure, the conjugate method and everything is built, you know, for not only peak strength, but also with the isometrics and some of the things that we're going with the volume days.
SPEAKER_01: Like Todd said, the endurance comes along with the training. Like we're doing one rep maxes, but everything else is endurance based. And then the three days on the table with structured pulling, timed pulling, sets on the table. Hopefully that endurance comes along with that. I definitely feel more comfortable in that area. Just hoping all those pieces fall together correctly. We'll see. You live and you learn. Yeah, one guy mentioned it.
SPEAKER_03: joining a Zoom call is tougher challenge for Samusha than defending his title 10 times in a row. That's true.
SPEAKER_04: That's a good one, right? Well, actually, I just talked with him and he's like, he's watching the stream. He's saying Paul is too big. So he's still reconsidering his decision. It's not funny. Tell him he needs to come here or he's going to start already with 0-1, you know, the match.
SPEAKER_03: okay i will message zero one i will message that yeah yeah it's not good you know i mean we set the time and he's not here why is that that comment was fun it's it's really struggling to come in
SPEAKER_04: So why is he not, how hard is it? He's also in the car, that complicates the things, but his friend is with him and his friends decide to give him the other phone and now they are trying to somehow connect his friend's phone to some Shia Zoom and stuff like this. Paul, we didn't go in deep detail about Zurab versus Taute.
SPEAKER_01: So who's winning that match? Man, I'm rooting for Zorab. I think Zorab is... So I think on paper, Tautiev poses a serious threat for Zorab. But knowing Zorab and knowing his time off and how he handled his injury and how hungry he is and how anxious he is to get back and watching his training, I just feel like this is going to be...
SPEAKER_01: I feel like it's Zerabs to lose. Something is telling me that this guy is not coming back in anything less than his best form.
SPEAKER_01: But I do think stylistically, I think this match could steal the show. I think depending on how they match up power-wise, center of the table, side pressure-wise, I think we'll see Tautiev probably take the hand. And then the question is, can Zurab control and stop it from there? And we could wind up seeing – I hope we see something similar like him and Ron Bass, which was one of the greatest arm wrestling matches I've watched in my entire life. Yeah. That's what you're rooting for. I really just want to –
SPEAKER_03: hurt or anything but i want to see a war yeah and i think i want to clarify something that like people ask even though robert and dexter already explained it uh as far as i know that atlas had microphone in arlington there was a technical issue that that is why some of the matches you were able to hear that that's
SPEAKER_03: And some matches you didn't have, you understand? And some haters wanted to relate with me. I don't know how that makes sense when I'm 10,000 kilometers away. And, you know, seriously, I don't know what kind of mental illness they have.
SPEAKER_03: Listen guys, after I made a deal with Robert, that kind of things are not even my lane, you understand? I have nothing to do with the microphone or the camera or anything. But I know that that was a problem.
SPEAKER_01: it is going to be fixed you know we are not taking away look man look look look that was the best that was the best stage set up optics venue and everything that could you know that's a huge step in the right direction we can't cry over those little things we're making steps there's going to be technical issues that happens in every sporting event
SPEAKER_03: that's been around for a hundred years, you know. Hopefully we will do everything better and without any mistakes, yes. But mistakes, yes. But whenever you are accusing people for something which is not true, then it is just becoming so like really boring, you know.
SPEAKER_03: Anyway, so you are saying that, hello, hello, David. David, you heard that you're going to start the match 0-1 and you are here now. He's sorry that he's so late. Roman, this time he was trying to fix. Roman, did you tell him about this 0-1? Did he read that?
SPEAKER_03: I have sent him a message. He's OK with that. He deserves it. So we are thinking that that's why he came. You know, he saw 01, he started. You know, I'm joking. Tell him that.
SPEAKER_03: David, your weight is 88 kilos four days ago. I thought you would be bigger. Like, are you still gaining weight? What is your weight right now? Are you still gaining weight? What is your weight right now?
SPEAKER_00: I don't know if it's a big deal that Tavari was in the form, or if it was a joke, or if it was just a joke, I don't know. I don't think it's a big deal. In any case, Tavari is a great guy. I think he's a great guy.
SPEAKER_04: He said that right now he's 89 kg, but in his mind, he doesn't need to be like 95 to perform as he plans to perform. It will eventually all come down to how well he will be on that day prepared against Paul. And he's saying that I'm trying to gain weight, but like a healthy way and it's going slow. But he doesn't need to be really 95 to be satisfied by his form performance.
SPEAKER_04: I tell him I know that feeling. I'm trying to get it on. Everyone knows that I'm in the same situation as you. I'm in the same situation as you. I'm in the same situation as you. I'm in the same situation as you. I'm in the same situation as you. I'm in the same situation as you. I'm in the same situation as you. I'm in the same situation as you.
SPEAKER_00: As he said, he's trying
SPEAKER_04: he's best to gain his weight but uh nevertheless uh it will be if happens he said it's a big if but if it happens so that he loses the match he will never blame it to the uh not being uh 95 kg he just said that he he just said that he's in shape he feels in shape
SPEAKER_03: Can you ask him if this pause since his last match helped him to recover? Does his body respond better after some break because he was pulling every event?
SPEAKER_04: Yes, that's right. David, you said you were going to take a big break, because everyone knows that you are not going to hold any events in your city, and you are going to take a break from all your activities and from everything else. How do you feel about that? Well, it's not like I'm going to take a break from everything, and I'm going to take a break from everything, and I'm going to take a break from everything, and I'm going to take a break from everything, and I'm going to take a break from everything,
SPEAKER_00: There is a lot of work to be done in Lardy.
SPEAKER_04: so he feels uh great uh it's it's been almost a six months pause he feels great uh no injuries fully recovered weight wise like when when it comes to the way uh heavy lifting he's the same roughly as he was no less so he feels that this pose was good for him in general yeah
SPEAKER_04: That's good. And then let's ask him about the Zurab vs. Tautiya match. Zurab, sorry. David, I would like to know your opinion about the Zurab vs. Tautiya match. This was the first question and now I'm very interested in your opinion. I think Zurab is a very traumatic match. There was a period when there was a lot of collaboration.
SPEAKER_00: I think it's a very good idea. I think it's a very good idea. I think it's a good idea. I think it's a very good idea.
SPEAKER_04: He's, like everybody else, he knows that Zurab is coming from the heavy injury, like a devastating one. But recovery process, he knows that it's been going well for him lately, for Zurab. They kept in touch. He knows Zurab's current shape. He feels prepared. And it's not like because they are Georgians that Samushia thinks Zurab will win, but also based on his current situation,
SPEAKER_04: information on how well Zurab is recovered and is hungry to win, motivated, and also the shape. He believes, considering Tautiev's last performance, that in his mind Zurab is favorite and Zurab will end up winning. Okay, another question for Samosia, since we had talked a lot with Paul and
SPEAKER_04: David says a few things as well. Does David expect this match to be as hard as last time against Paul? David, your first match was against Paul. What do you expect from this match against Paul? Do you expect him to win or lose? Do you expect Paul to win?
SPEAKER_00: Well, first of all, I am very sorry, but as you can see, Paoli is very sorry. I'm sorry and I'm sorry for what happened. I'm very sorry for the video web and social media. Paoli is very sorry for me and I'm very sorry.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know if it will happen, but I think it will happen in 20-30 years. I will continue my work. I will continue my work.
SPEAKER_04: Obviously he is gonna show up to win, that's his mission and he's fully motivated for it but objectively in his mind it's 50-50 because like he gained and got better in armwrestling shape-wise after their first match
SPEAKER_04: So did Paul in his mind. So it is hard for him to expect anything different or any easier match than it was first time, which ends up him saying it's 50-50 in his mind. But like I stated, he thinks that he's coming there for a win. Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: And another question, I think he is now 89 kilos, so my guess is he will end up 90 or 91 kilos. Other than Paul, does he have any plans in this category? Any winning title type of plans? Or he thinks that he will remain too light with the weight for this category?
SPEAKER_04: David, after all the matches, what do you think will happen in this category? Do you think that you will win, as you said, in 2015, because of the fact that your opponents are great? Do you think that you will win in this category? Do you think that you will win?
SPEAKER_00: Well, from this point of view, I would say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that
SPEAKER_04: It's hard for him to say prior to this match exactly about his plans on staying in 95 kg. He said that it heavily depends on results, how it will go.
SPEAKER_04: will be determining solidly so to say that if he is satisfied with his own performance he would think about staying in but right now he cannot say for sure i'm gonna stay in this weight class yeah he told me he told me that uh he was gonna win the fourth belt permanently by winning 12 world title matches in 85 kilo does he still have such plan
SPEAKER_04: So, you are saying that you are going to challenge the government to give you a second chance and you are going to do it here? Is that what you are going to do in the future? Well, it's a difficult situation and it's going to happen in the future. It's not like it's going to happen overnight, it's not going to happen overnight, but the fact is that it's a difficult situation and it's going to happen in the future.
SPEAKER_00: Yes, Engin, he thinks that this career that he's been
SPEAKER_04: cementing in East vs West stage it is like his steps that he has done and it's like his job that he has started is yet to be finished and he thinks that it is his must that he has to claim his fourth belt because since he did the last tenth defense he needs two more so fourth belt is begun in his own mind and he will pursue that goal
SPEAKER_03: and after that he will be satisfied i i don't know who else can do that you know in the future but yeah it looks very very hard thing to do you know yeah um
SPEAKER_03: For some time, you know, I want to come back, David, to arm wrestling back, you know. And because of my weight, I'm always like, okay, if I'm coming back and the weight that I can make is 85 kilos and Samusha is there. So I train and in my head, I cannot beat you. And then I quit training, you know. So I decided to come back, but with...
SPEAKER_03: Compared to you, an easier opponent, but still a very, very tough opponent against Minda Agost Taraseiti. So when I have him as a target, so I somehow continue to have motivation. What does he think about this? David, thank you very much.
SPEAKER_04: I remember when you were in the zone in 2005, you came with me and I told you that we were going to fight and you were going to fight too. We were going to fight and you were going to fight too. But the form was different.
SPEAKER_04: And one more thing is that, no matter how much motivation you have, like, oh, I'm going to lose weight, I'm going to lose 45 kilos, and no matter how hard you try to lose weight, that motivation is not enough to lose weight. In my opinion, it's not enough to lose weight. But most people think that, like, the results of losing weight, if it's a healthy opponent, is to lose weight, or something like that.
SPEAKER_04: But I think it's a good thing that I'm here. I don't know what to say. And I think that's what motivates me. I don't know what to say, but if you ask me if I'm going to lose weight, I'll tell you that I'm going to lose weight in 25 kilos. I'm going to lose weight. What do you think, Prava? I'm going to lose weight.
SPEAKER_00: I would like to thank you very much, Perik, for being here and for sharing your thoughts with us.
SPEAKER_04: if he has ever said the word yes this would be his biggest yes about accepting your match and he said that it's honor for him to stand beside like opposite side of the armwrestling table and pull with you again whenever you yeah yeah but did you did you translate correct because i didn't say i want to pull him i said he's too good
SPEAKER_04: I told him, but I told exactly what like you said that you in your in your mind, you still think that you are not able to, you know, and he said that he wishes to pull with you. Oh, okay. Okay, let's go. Lachlan versus Petromar Harent, Paul. Oh, this is going to be a good one too, because we know what's going inside. Lachlan looked, Lachlan looked great in his last outing against Lars.
SPEAKER_01: But I feel like Petro might be able to meet him in the center and probably control his pronation. I think it could be a really good match. I give a slight edge, like 55-45 to Petro. And David? I think Petro and Marharin have a good match.
SPEAKER_00: I think there is a lot of competition, there is a lot of domination, there is a lot of competition from my point of view.
SPEAKER_04: from david's point of view this is a big there's a gap relatively big gap between these two athletes in his mind he thinks that petro will be a dominant victor uh victorious in dominant fashion okay this one i'm gonna ask to paul jocelyn versus egla oh man i
SPEAKER_01: i am still learning about jocelyn so my my first introduction to her was i guess that round robin where she she beat sarah um i was not expecting that level of control in the second match between her and um and uh and sarah i was i i thought that was gonna be i thought it was gonna be a good match
SPEAKER_01: But I thought it would be a back and forth. I thought there would be a window for Sarah to find and potentially outclass her based on experience. But that level of dominance was not what I expected. So I know a lot of people in the comments and online are saying that Jocelyn is not ready for EGLA. I don't know if that's true. And I think it's tricky.
SPEAKER_01: when somebody comes onto the scene and they immediately shoot kind of like to the top, to a title match. I think, you know, it's not title, you know, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, let's say like in that discussion, in a second match, you know what I mean? Like a pivotal match that could relate to a title match or, you know, we're within a year of that, depending on how things go. I think that can be a tricky thing for anybody, but...
SPEAKER_01: Jocelyn is, I think, different, you know? I don't, like, I have a hard time making a prediction on the match.
SPEAKER_01: But I do think she is well deserving of the opportunity and would not be surprised if she wanted. I think as time goes on, even with a loss, if she were to lose and she does the right thing with that information and that experience, she's going to come back so much better because I think she has all the tools. I mean, how many young ladies do we know that benched 315 pounds? The natural skill set.
SPEAKER_01: but then also combining that with how well she clearly moves and understands arm wrestling i think she has a really really bright future regardless of outcome yeah smart woman understand from arm wrestling
SPEAKER_00: Yes, he asked if it's a right arm. Yeah, yeah, right arm. Yeah, I told him.
SPEAKER_04: Even though Kalinchenko is a very strong opponent for Ivan, Ivan's technicality or execution in technical way will be superior on the table. Roman, can you remind him that it is 115 kilo match, not the super heavy with Serhii, but the 115 kilo.
SPEAKER_04: You can say that 15 meters is a mile, 15 meters is a mile, Kalinchenko said 15 meters, and Ivan said 15 meters. I think it's a category. If I were in that category, I would probably be very angry and I would be very angry.
SPEAKER_04: Well, that plays even more advantage, in more favor for Ivan because Kalina can be, if he's bigger than 115, he would have more chances. But even now when it's 115, Ivan has advantage and more chances, according to David. And Paul?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I think I think so, like looking at Sergei, even in like his first outing that I saw with him and Serranoff,
SPEAKER_01: Sergey's great up top. If you try and top roll him, I think it's a problem. But once a match gets turned inside, I think that becomes a difficult spot for him at times. So if there is a weakness, you know, maybe it is that inside game. And I think pairing that up with the fact that, you know, Ivan is like one of the most efficient at setting a hook that probably ever lived. I mean, I've become a big fan of this guy after knowing him and studying him a little bit more.
SPEAKER_01: i i would be amazed if sergey can stay out on his hand and i think that's the only way to beat him uh i just have i have a feeling that this one is is probably going to go heavily in yvonne's favor um but you never know because sergey's young and getting better uh but i would probably put this 60 40 to to yvonne um just for your information i i don't think sir is planning to top roll uh paul well that that
SPEAKER_03: that makes it even more fun that makes it even more fun yeah yeah because i mean like wayne same with iwan and trying to top roll him and not having any plan b that is just like like i don't know yeah sometimes sometimes it's best it's best to fight fire with fire not try and avoid it just go directly into it and get there a little bit faster yeah
SPEAKER_00: Let's go to David Dadikian vs. Georgi Svetkov. David, left arm, left. David is in the middle of the fight. He has a super weight category. Svetkov and Dadikian. Dadikian is in the middle of the fight. I think it's Dadikian. Dadikian is in the middle of the fight. I think it's Dadikian. Dadikian is in the middle of the fight.
SPEAKER_04: around 70 to 30% for that again, he thinks that again, we'll take this one, considering his last performance on super heavyweight left arm. And Paul, again, let me ask you this, just because I might be not spun up. How well like, how
SPEAKER_01: how much further behind would you put it percentage wise for both of these guys right arm versus left arm in their individual categories so like just so i understand like are either of them left-hand specialists outside of focusing on the right arm as far as i know that
SPEAKER_03: When he was healthy, I think Georgi's left hand was better than his right arm. He has defeated Levan in the past. And left was Levan's better arm as well. And then Georgi had serious injuries with left and he didn't pull well. And now I still think his right arm is ahead of his left. But I think that now left arm is healthier.
SPEAKER_03: And about Dadikyan, when he was pulling the youth category in WAF, his left was better than his right. But now I think that both are the same, but right arm now I think injured. I think he is not going to put in a right arm match this year.
SPEAKER_03: And, yeah, because I asked him, you know, what do you think, you know, about right arm matches? He said, Engin, it hurts. So once he says that, until he reaches me back and says, Engin, I'm ready, I won't even offer him anything with right arm, you know, because I don't want him to push himself and make a mistake. These athletes, you can't find everywhere, you understand? These athletes are very special people, so we shouldn't tempt them, you know. Anyway, so...
SPEAKER_01: So with that information, I think I would I would maybe lean my initial gut response to that was to have
SPEAKER_01: uh to to to to think georgie didn't have as much of a chance against datacon i would have favored datacon off of gut gut instinct but if georgie has been resting his right arm and his left arm used to be better and we're definitely going to have a big weight disparity uh maybe he has better chances in this one i mean that this that that that information makes it hard to predict i initially would have thought datacon but um i think you convinced me otherwise
SPEAKER_03: um i think i for me if you ask me anything can happen because i will try to explain i explained this before kurdecha is someone with left arm is just like more like going sideways but he is not like he is more with right arm that is just taking the wrist and going with left arm i think he's so much like trust himself like he's not really going outside to top row you saw he tried to do side pin against morozov there was it was a lighter
SPEAKER_03: Morozov after his stomach injury, but he still was able to hook him without the strap. You understand? In the round one, right away he hooked him. So, and now also Dari can control Kurdesha's pronator, but Svetko is a top-row specialist. Svetko doesn't try to pin you like this.
SPEAKER_03: Like he's more specialist for taking your wrist. So I'm not saying that he's going to take Dadikian's wrist, but like Dadikian is someone that who needs to have copying. You understand what I'm saying? So then we will see how good his copying versus how good Gyorgy's pronated. People will say, oh, they won't beat Gyorgy.
SPEAKER_03: At that time, Devon was not as good as today with left arm and Georgie was nowhere near to where he is right now. At that time, he was weaker for sure. And if you remember, Devon beat him with a lot of games, not like controlling his pronator with his wrist or something. So I expect that anything that can happen, if Tadej can hold him and beat him with side pressure, I won't be surprised.
SPEAKER_03: swedco hangs him and daddy can't go because of georgie's pronated i won't be surprised so anything can happen but if if if georgie wins i think it will be a battle yeah yeah anyway so let me go to another one another left-arm match tamil yablonsky georgie desire of david
SPEAKER_00: It was in March, wasn't it? Yes, yes, yes. I think it was in the 50s or 50s. I don't know. I think it was in the 50s or 50s. I think it was in the 50s or 50s. I think it was in the 50s or 50s.
SPEAKER_04: He's saying 50-50, both athletes are going to end up in hook most likely, and neither of them are going to back down from that style of pulling in his mind. He thinks that it's going to be 50-50, hard to predict the winner. And Paul? Yeah, I feel like it's definitely going inside.
SPEAKER_01: um and and it's going to come down to speed i think jordan can stop camille um and it'll come down to if he can get those stops with his shoulder forward meeting him in you know in a solid position and i think if the mac yeah if if jordan can get there on time or early i think he can win the match uh but camille is one of those guys that are just like evolving at light speed
SPEAKER_01: so i feel like every time we see him we see a better version he's so motivated he's got so much energy he might come and just blow the doors off of it you know but something tells me i think jorge you know if you can get in there and get a stop that that he he has a good chance of meeting him in the middle and being able to pull in a hook there okay and
SPEAKER_00: David, who is more crazy, Matt Mask or Nugo? He didn't know how to translate. Nugo, Nugo, my name is David. He is a very emotional, sporty guy. He has a very positive attitude. He is very positive.
SPEAKER_00: If you look at me, you'll see that I'm very good at it. I think he's very good at dominating. He's very strong. He's one of the best in his category. He's very strong. I think his parameters are very good.
SPEAKER_00: That's a very good question. I think it's a good question. I think it's a good question.
SPEAKER_04: This match is very, very exciting to do it. He just said this is both guys are extremely crazy, as he said. And he said, like, I don't know who is crazier, but like, it's going to be very exciting match and no offense to you, Paul. But he's expecting this match. He finds exciting to himself more than his own match against you. That's how excited he is. I agree. I agree. It's like he cannot cannot wait until watch this match. Right. And he said,
SPEAKER_04: uh nugo in his mind uh is very uh in david's mind nugo is uh extremely capable in this weight class despite nugo's anthropometric parameters right we we all know that um in uh david said that we know that nugo is crazy and he's very strong lately he
SPEAKER_04: keep surprising him with his weight lifts and uh he thought in the middle of the conversation he said he thinks nugo will just destroy matt because i don't know this is what he said but it is in order to be very crazy much to see yeah and they did did did samusha see the match between matt musk and hungar where uh david shane bolus
SPEAKER_00: Yes, of course, of course, but in my opinion, the way I see it, I think the first operation was a post-traumatic one, and, you know, there was a lot of speculation that he was going to lose weight, and he was going to lose weight, but now he's not, he's a strong man, he's a strong man, he's a strong man, and he's a great athlete, but I think, and my opinion, the way I see it,
SPEAKER_00: It was not the intention of the Hungarians, which was actually the Hungarians' intention. I think there is nothing wrong with that. I don't want to talk about the fact that the Matmaski family and the brothers are in a relationship, but the Hungarians, who were the Hungarians, were very close to the Magrida family. I think there is something wrong.
SPEAKER_04: Obviously he has seen this match, he said yeah I know for sure I watched and I know Matt Mask is very strong but he doesn't want to diminish any achievements that Mask has been done in that match on that day but
SPEAKER_04: In Samush's mind, Ongurbaev, considering that he was coming from this elbow injury, he was not at his best shape. In David's opinion, Ongurbaev could have pulled better and prime Ongurbaev is yet to come.
SPEAKER_04: So he said this, but he also kept saying, I don't want to take away anything that Matt Mask achieved. And he beat in a very dominant fashion. But in David's opinion, this match would not be just conclusion driving force to say, hey, he's going to do the same thing to Nugo. So he thinks that Nugo is going to win. That's what he said, right? Nugo is going to win. That's what he said, right?
SPEAKER_04: very confidently and without any shadow of a doubt wow let's see what paul says as the representative of team west i think um i think
SPEAKER_01: this is really interesting and i mean when you talk about energy that's gonna be you know put out during a match like this is regardless of who wins there's gonna the stage will be on fire with these guys oh it's gonna be some dramatic some dramatic stuff especially if it goes back and forth it's gonna get great you know as far as entertainment goes um both of them are natural at that they're they're being themselves they're not putting anything on
SPEAKER_01: so i i think you know this is one of those like like card stealing matches for sure when when when you look at it from like who's gonna win uh perspective i think it's interesting we talked earlier about krazy and the ebbs and flows right we've seen matt mask do some amazing things in arm wrestling like we forget you know some of the wins and and how far he's gotten
SPEAKER_01: um and then you know we've seen some some ebbs where there were some back-to-back losses and things like that um from talking to matt and knowing matt and seeing what he's doing and where his energy and head's at i think he is also in one of those good spaces that i predict krasimir being in right now i think he's back on that upward trajectory the flip side of that is cops
SPEAKER_01: I think, in my opinion, Matt would know himself better, but I think he is in his best shape ever. I think you're possibly right. But Nugo is such an X-Factor. Like, his style, his energy, like, his pure back pressure and pronation, I would venture to assume that it's probably close to, like, Heracles.
SPEAKER_01: like if not right around the same range. Then you look at the anatomy of the whole thing. Matt's a long lever guy who tends to have his knuckle low. Nugo is a shorter lever guy who can be on the front of that pad and have his forearm vertical. So it comes down to how they negotiate the setup because I do think it's going to be close.
SPEAKER_01: like whether Matt can get his riser and keep his riser or if he's forced to dump it, depending on his elbow position, like those little things right there, I think could decide the outcome of the match. I think Nugo is incredible. I think he's amazing for the sport, but I have a feeling that, uh,
SPEAKER_01: the anatomy might play a bigger part in this one. And I think Matt is just on fire right now. And I think he's riding his momentum. And of course, I'm going to support my buddy from the West. The one thing that they both believe in themselves, like a hundred percent, a hundred percent, like they are coming like this without any doubt, you know, they are coming like, like,
SPEAKER_01: hundred miles an hour you know yeah right and that that's what makes the match so interesting so round one somebody's gonna win and somebody's gonna lose and then what happens with that confidence after that regardless of of which side wins or loses you know that to me is going to be the interesting point how does the energy bubble up after that win and that loss
SPEAKER_03: Which we should let them like 10 rounds, you know, because until their energy finishes, they can't scream anymore to each other, you know. Anyway, so there is... Number one arm wrestling fan, Engin, great card. Thank you, my friend. Thank you, my friend. Thank you to you fans that are supporting us. And let's go to this crazy card.
SPEAKER_00: Artur Makarov vs. Daniel Prokopchuk. David, you go. Good match? Very good match, very good match.
SPEAKER_00: I am very happy that this account has become one of the most dominant in the category of sports. What do you think about the results of the movie?
SPEAKER_00: It's a great opportunity for all of us. It's not like we don't have any other opportunities. What do you think will happen in the future? Will you be able to do it in four years? I don't know. I think it will be a great opportunity. I think it will be a great opportunity.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I think so, bro.
SPEAKER_04: he said very good match like miraculous match it is like in his mind he has kind of surprised he was surprised that this has never been this has never taken place before like he was like how on earth we are getting this much so late but like he's he's saying absolutely great match he said it will definitely not be one-sided it will be a great war um some different trajectories could go he said
SPEAKER_04: there will be adjustments from both sides. It's a seven round. I said, it's a seven round, obviously, and reminded him. He said, obviously, I know. He said, for sure, it will go about the endurance. And in his mind, Prokopchuk also will end up winning, finding some key moments in some key times. And in a great battle, finally, Prokopchuk will end up victorious, in David's opinion. Paul?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I'm rooting for Daniel. I think this has no choice but to be a war.
SPEAKER_01: you know i think it's going to come down to you how well daniel can probably control uh arthur's arthur's pronator um i i i'm rooting for daniel i to me this one's 50 50 i don't know you know i'm i'm very much looking forward to it because i think there's there's no way out of a long match i think it's going to be long
SPEAKER_01: I think it's going to be interesting. I don't think either guy has any quit in them, but I think it'll come down to pronator control and endurance and hook. I don't think it's going to be a fast finish, but 50-50 for me. Scott Pequot says, you got a match for Ryan Ballinger. He is ready to smash another East opponent. Anything is possible.
SPEAKER_03: Ryan is a good guy and a good armwrestler, strong. Yeah, very impressive guy, yeah. I think he's improving too. I've been watching him and the stuff he's doing. I think he's getting better. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And, OK, so... Gennady Kvikvinia Ibrahim Sago. 115 kilos. That's 100 kilos.
SPEAKER_00: I would like to say that I love Gennady, I'm sorry that Gennady and Tavostava have a relationship with each other, but I would like to say that my relationship with Gennady started in 50-50. I would like to say that Gennady was in Cimetrona and he is not a big fan.
SPEAKER_00: Of course, a lot of people say that it is the fate of the nation, but a lot of people say that there is no reason for me to say that it is the fate of the nation. I think it's 50-50. There is a 15th category. I would like to say that it is the fate of the nation, but it's not 50-50.
SPEAKER_04: He would estimate this match 50-50. Obviously he's going to root for his good friend Gennady. He didn't want to disclose all the role playing details that he thinks will play a big role of Gennady's preparation, considering he's dropping down the weight. Also, that's another factor.
SPEAKER_04: uh that doesn't allow some mushiya to like 100 say that uh this is gonna be again this match he wanted to say that it's gonna be 50 50. both ways could go and it will come down to how each guy is prepared for the opponent and paul well as an honorary supporter of the nation of georgia
SPEAKER_01: I believe that Gennady is going to win this match. I think there's a lot of factors involved. And I really like Ibrahim. His lane is so tricky. But I feel like Gennady coming down in weight, a lot of people question that weight cut.
SPEAKER_01: and it's hard not to and i don't know how that's going for him but i can lend him some assistance in the sauna before the weigh-in and we can eat together afterwards oh yeah yeah well i mean i'm i'm 97 and like
SPEAKER_01: i'm i'm like i'm gonna need to sauna a little bit for sure i gain at least two three pounds when i'm on the airplane so i'll lend him some assistance and then we can eat dinner together afterwards um but i think i think gennady i think in order to to be ibrahim you got to have the courage to meet him in the middle and gennady is a ball of courage you know as long as he can make that weight
SPEAKER_01: Like I don't see this guy getting flashed like multiple times in a row. I see him meeting that match with bone structure and at a bare minimum, making it really, really good. But the guy is, doesn't have any quit in him. And it's like really hard not to like him and not to root for him. And I genuinely think that when he makes that weight, um,
SPEAKER_01: that that i think he is the favorite but we'll see you know best of luck to both of them yeah okay last two matches russian baba ever touching david
SPEAKER_00: It's a legendary book. As I said, my father's grandfather, I don't know, I don't know Hachinsk, but Hachinsk's political form is in a very good shape.
SPEAKER_00: In the 50s and 50s, there was a lot of good news, but I think there are a lot of legendary sportsmen out there. And there are a lot of people in the sport. In the 50s and 50s, there are a lot of people who are very interested in this sport. There are a lot of new people.
SPEAKER_04: This match is very close. They are both legendary pullers. We all know their history as well. He knows that it has been one-sided till this day, but right now when he estimates both athletes' current shapes and performance, he finds it very extremely close. He said 50-50. I cannot determine the winner in this case. Paul? In Todd we trust.
SPEAKER_01: listen this guy so uh now honestly if you take out the fact that you know I'm friends with both of these guys I really love both of them they're awesome people um it's easy to look back on previous outcomes and say why can't Rusum do it again of course he should be the favorite and I do think Rusum is also coming into like back into that peak form
SPEAKER_01: That said, Todd has evolved. He's changed as a puller. He's changed as far as the things he focuses on. He's protected weak areas for himself. I don't think there's a vulnerability in the guy right now. In that, I think if you're going to beat Todd, you have to control his pronator, and sometimes you have to go at him.
SPEAKER_01: I think Rustem is one of the few people in the weight class that's willing to even test that water out. That's what makes this match so interesting. I don't think we're going to see a top-roll attempt from Rustem. I think we're seeing an inside match unless Todd has success in the first round in there.
SPEAKER_01: um that said uh we we we've seen todd lose to in in a deep hook to datacon dot account only who was probably i don't know how big he was on the day of competition but that was a war so i i do think that even though todd is approaching 60 years old i think he's bringing probably his best form that he has ever been in and i do give him a slight favor
SPEAKER_01: And the guy, like, I can't say enough about the guy. We talked about him at the beginning of the podcast. I just don't think, you know, especially with the history and knowing what I know about Todd and how he approaches things, he's going to get his best form for sure. Paul, the question. How did you feel Rustem's hand and wrist when you tried to go outside against him? The first time I pulled him, it's impossible.
SPEAKER_01: It's impossible. Like I mean, only like Iraq Lee was able to top rolling twice. rooster was also was also able to execute. He definitely contained him on the good side of the strap. Yeah. So like we're talking about the best top roller, probably maybe ever in that category. I don't know, you know, that's yet to be determined. But if you know if you can effectively hook
SPEAKER_01: the best dude that Todd didn't even attempt to hook. He just Todd rolled him. I don't think top roll is an option against Rustam. I think it's wasting a round. So if you are saying this and he thinks you are very close to Todd, so you must be knowing something.
SPEAKER_01: yeah so so if i'm breaking the match down completely the way for ruthum to win like if i'm being objective not it's not saying anything that he doesn't know already the way for him to win is to beat todd on the go and get him outside of his shoulder and onto his bicep if there is pronation control and isolation of bicep that's the only chance he has in my opinion if todd turns his shoulder
SPEAKER_01: Even with his pronator taken, completely supinated, he will win the match. If he can get this clicked in, it's probably over. But if on that go, Rusin can take him here before shoulder engagement, now there's a window. Okay. Soon to find out, you know, how it will go. And let's go to the last match, David. Vitaly Laletin versus Michael Todd. I'm curious about this, about your opinion.
SPEAKER_00: Well, in general, it's not a big deal. It's not a big deal. I'm sorry, but I think it's a big deal. I think it's a big deal. It's a big deal. It's a big deal. It's a big deal.
SPEAKER_04: It will be very difficult for both guys. In David's opinion, the match will be still in favor of Vitaly Laletin, around maybe 70%. He said 70% to 30%. But it will not be easy. Definitely, there will be a war. There will be two-sided, like back and forth.
SPEAKER_03: They both have to show their best, and eventually he thinks Vitaly has the tools to finish the job. That is interesting, Roman, because like he said, it is going to be a war, and Vitaly is going to be... And Vitaly has more chances.
SPEAKER_03: When he looks at these two athletes, Michael and Vitaly, who does he see with better endurance in a war? I got your point.
SPEAKER_04: It is very interesting what he says. He says that there will be a second war and he will go to Italy in the second war. What does he say? He says that if the situation gets worse, he will leave and he will go to Italy.
SPEAKER_00: I don't think so. I think it's not as bad as it was before. I think it's not as bad as it was before. I think it's not as bad as it was before. I think it's not as bad as it was before. I think it's not as bad as it was before. I think it's not as bad as it was before.
SPEAKER_00: It is possible to say that in the past, there were many people who said that in the past, it was important to have a whole team and such a team, and to have a unique team, a universal team, where everyone could play in the same position. I think it is possible.
SPEAKER_04: He explained himself why he thinks that in a tough battle Vitaly could still find the key and victory.
SPEAKER_04: He expects Todd to do Michael to do his thing.
SPEAKER_04: in an open-topper way, open up his arm as far as he can and do his thing, basically what Michael is good at. And in David's mind, match will end up being there and fight will be there. But in his mind, he used specifically the word universal when it comes to estimation of Vitaly's arm, like hand and arm. He said that...
SPEAKER_04: Vitaly's hand is universal in terms of pulling dead wrist as well. We have seen that Vitaly has pulled different styles. He can do good top roll. He can flop press. He can do hook as well. Except Morozov. When did he win with the flop press? I think he means when he flop pressed Chafee, but I will ask him. Chafee match he lost, you know.
SPEAKER_03: And it was champion that more times pin him in such a way. And also we have seen Vitaly losing against, in a strap match to Farid and then Zaur, I have seen him losing and he losing his wrist and he couldn't press Hermes either.
SPEAKER_03: But who knows? Maybe he's right. But I'm just trying to remember the matches that Vitaly won with the right arm. Can you tell him which matches he remembers?
SPEAKER_04: It's not a new thing, but there are nuances and nuances. I think it's important to talk about it. Yes, I agree. I would like to ask you something. If we talk about the story of Morozov, how did Vitaly Moro end up with this character? If you think about it, what do you think about Vitaly's relationship with Michael? Because I think it's very interesting.
SPEAKER_00: That's what I think, but I don't think so. If you look at it from a sportsman's point of view, a lot of people think that I'm going to lose weight, but the truth is that I don't think that I'm going to lose weight. I think I'm going to lose weight, but the truth is that I'm going to lose weight, but the truth is that I'm going to lose weight
SPEAKER_00: That's right. I mean, it's been a long time since I've been there. It's been a long time since I've been there. I mean, it's been a long time since I've been there.
SPEAKER_04: Other than Morozov's match, I asked the same question as you wanted. He could not name any specific match that Vitaly ended up flopping the guy and beating, but he heavily trusts right now on Vitaly's estimation during his preparation that Vitaly would assume the match would end up being in...
SPEAKER_04: such a fashion that he has to flop press. And when Dawit predicts that Vitaly will end up beating is based on Vitaly's
SPEAKER_04: distinctive specific preparation for that position for Michael. Because in David's opinion, Vitaly should assume that match would go that way. And he should be prepared. And he thinks that Vitaly is preparing for that one. And also he said based on last matches, we are seeing some tendency of Vitaly using different styles other than just top rolling. So he just
SPEAKER_01: no no no no i understand i'm just trying to understand and paul how you see this well i think this one's super interesting because of the the title shot implications that are behind it it's kind of like one of those like fork in the road matches like the do or die matches
SPEAKER_01: um i i yeah i talk to michael all the time and i think you know every time he takes the loss he goes back to the drawing board and and figures out where do i need to improve you know he's changed some focus in his training um i know how much it means to him personally and i'm sure it means exactly the same to the tally
SPEAKER_01: on paper anatomically it's not even close right as far as like body structure size all those things um but you can't measure heart and I think if that match stops it's going to be a measurement of heart so um
SPEAKER_01: I believe Michael has the tools and the ability to pull this out. I am going to be 100% in his corner and behind him through this. And I do think Michael, especially after listening to other people break it down, I thought Ermi's perspective on the match was very interesting.
SPEAKER_03: um but i think you know this is a match that has to happen i can't wait for it uh but i'm i'm supporting michael all the way and i do believe that was a chance he has a chance for sure and he has a good one okay so let's go to the last one and there is a super chat gp winters says engie can we see a match with looking he won at arling anything is possible my friend anything is possible but
SPEAKER_03: uh no guarantee um last one levan saginashvili hermes casparini david levan
SPEAKER_00: It's a big deal. It's a big deal. It's a big deal. It's a big deal. I'm not saying that Kasparin is a big deal. I'm not saying that Kasparin is a big deal. I'm not saying that Kasparin is a big deal. I'm not saying that Kasparin is a big deal. I'm not saying that Kasparin is a big deal. I'm not saying that Kasparin is a big deal.
SPEAKER_04: He said Levan, then he paused and then he said again self-explanatory Levan would be the winner. Then he added up that
SPEAKER_04: Both guys are progressing since their last match, considering Lewand also had some performance issues last time. It came down to the help of the oxygen and stuff like this. He remembers that, obviously. But he, David Samusha, thinks Lewand has worked on that one.
SPEAKER_04: and Lewand is aiming to outperform himself in their first match versus Hermes. He believes this time it will be even more one-sided towards Lewand than it was last time. Paul? Well, as somebody who once lived in Italy and somebody who would like to live in Georgia at some point,
SPEAKER_01: I'm kind of torn on this one. I think Ermes has gotten better from the first match. And I love the dude. But I'm kind of with David. I don't think LeBron's ready to give up that crown yet. But I do think it's going to be very, very interesting as far as Ermes' focuses and how they've shifted in that riser lift.
SPEAKER_01: i really really think this is gonna this is gonna be an interesting match where it those first few rounds are not potentially gonna look like the first meeting so i i don't i think i think when it comes down to the title it's it's almost like levon's choice whether he wants to keep it or not based off of his own motivation level and like we you know we've seen the recent podcast and heard what he said
SPEAKER_01: about motivation and everything. I hope that that's not a factor. My gut tells me that his motivation isn't gone. And I think this is one, honestly, that even though he won 4-0 or however you want to look at it as 4-2, I think he probably wants this one as much as he wants any of them. This might
SPEAKER_01: realistically be the last match where he has that fire you know that true motivation to get something back I don't know it depends on how long how long that motivation sticks but I do believe it's here for this one and I think it's it's really LeBron's match to lose so I will tell you something this match may be like the highest level of motivation for LeBron
SPEAKER_03: after the reaction of some people who made fun with Levan. And I think this is very personal. This is not only personal between Ermes and Levan, but Levan and the people who made fun with him. And I think that Levan is really coming here. And Levan said he's going to ask Ermes to pull
SPEAKER_03: all six rounds you know and then he's gonna force him to come to the table you know so it just shows that even he said oh it's nothing personal or something i mean i can see that you know and he he wants you know to prove that he will be there even on this round six and he will make hermes in fact quit or something wild
SPEAKER_03: Hermes is different. Hermes has also a warrior spirit and Hermes knows armwrestling very, very good. Very, very good.
SPEAKER_03: he knows what to expect and he is, I don't know if it's going to be enough or not, but trust me, he's going to come there at his best ever. And you see how Levan started to steer the pot. He said, you know, like the take weights. And then he said he can come to Tbilisi and I teach him how to properly train and things like that. And, and Hermes says that those weights are real. And if Levan is thinking they are not real, it means that,
SPEAKER_03: Levan is not capable of lifting those weights. It just shows that he's in trouble. This is how Ermes, you know, took those words. We will see. Trust me. That is another match that, trust me, that match...
SPEAKER_03: From Hermes' side, you know, I think Hermes didn't go to Dubai to win that match last time. I think he went there to do his best. But in my opinion, now, I don't know if he can do it or not, but Hermes is going there to win that match. But we will see. Maybe Levan is going to beat him. Maybe. I don't know. We will see. Number one armwrestling fan, I watched my first Supermatch, 2003, Tuller versus Celaris. I think...
SPEAKER_03: get a grip. And I have been hooked ever since. I say thank you to all these great artists. Yeah, I remember. Greg Tuller started to pull 85 kilos and they had a war, you know, Greg and Michael Celaris. Yeah. Anyway, so thank you very, very much, David Samusha. David, you are incredible. And one last question for David. Who do you want next in 85? We don't want to
SPEAKER_03: talk about future matches but the match that you have with Pauline now is 95 kilo while you said that after this one needs to be 85 kilo who do you think that would be the best matchup for you?
SPEAKER_04: I would like to say that it is possible to be a sportsman, and I would like to say that if you want to be in the 95th category, you have to be in the 95th category. Do you agree with me?
SPEAKER_00: I think it's Aydar Khan. I don't know if it's true or not, but I think Aydar Khan is very good. But I don't know if it's true or not, but I don't think it's true.
SPEAKER_00: I think that there is a chance, even if you don't have it, there is a chance that the two of you will be able to get out of it, even if you don't have it.
SPEAKER_04: I'm sure you guys heard two names that he mentioned. I will translate exactly. He said... He has been following the social medias and posts. He may not be active, but he's following actively. He's seeing that people are mentioning Eiderhan's name constantly.
SPEAKER_04: And he thinks that Aydar Khan could be his next or one of the next opponents. And on the other side, also on the other side of the world, he mentioned the name. Yeah, he said that Craig has been
SPEAKER_04: gone through the some steps he used that word as well he has done some steps he has taken some steps and gone through the phases of which based of which David assumes that Craig also has earned his chance against him to give give a rematch so those two names he mentioned and as I started to translate he quickly also added up that he's gonna be ready to smash anyone
SPEAKER_03: Oh, he's ready to smash anyone. So he says that these are only details, you know, before he gets his sport belt, you know. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Two more matches, 12. And ask him one last thing, you know. Who is winning? If I come back, I or Mindaugas? Not to be nice to me, not to be nice to me.
SPEAKER_04: Now I am 91 and a half kilo.
SPEAKER_00: The lowest I can go 85. I don't think I can lose 15 kilos to make 77, but maybe in the long term, yeah. Now, in 1993, you were told that you were going to be born in 1995, right? Yes, I was told that I was going to be born in 1993. I think it's a good chance. I mean, I was born in 1995.
SPEAKER_00: He said 50-50, but he's kind of unsure. Is Mindagus able to pull up 85 kg? I mean, he's coming near to 80 kg, you know, but that is... Maybe 79 kg or something, yeah. Maybe 79 kg or something, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Engin, he doesn't want you to take it as if he's nice to you, but he says that if Minda was going to only show up 79-80 kg, it will not be enough for him to beat you. But if it's 85 or close to 85 at least, it will be hard. Listen, listen, I will be 85 but with tons of fat still, you know.
SPEAKER_04: I was born in 1995. I was born in 1995. I was born in 1995. I was born in 1995. I was born in 1995.
SPEAKER_00: My opinion on this topic is that if I were to go back to 1995, I would be very disappointed. If I were to go back to 1995, I would be very disappointed.
SPEAKER_00: I know that my maxim, maxim, maxim, maxim, maxim, maxim, maxim, maxim, maxim, maxim, maxim, maxim, maxim, maxim, maxim, maxim, maxim, maxim, maxim, maxim, maxim, maxim, maxim, maxim, maxim, maxim, maxim, maxim, maxim, maxim, maxim, maxim, maxim, maxim, maxim, maxim, maxim, maxim, maxim, maxim, maxim, maxim, maxim, maxim, maxim, maxim, maxim, maxim, maxim.
SPEAKER_04: and he said uh he reiterated that if if mindagus pulls up closer to 85 kg then match would be very good and entertaining but uh if he's 80 kg or like less maybe even it would be very hard for him to beat you and also he said he trusts uh no he said he knows that if you decide to pull
SPEAKER_04: Mindaugas. Mindaugas is a huge name. Pull Mindaugas in 85 kg. At 85 kg, David Samushia knows that you will be capable of beating him in that one. So it's hard for him to say that you will lose, but 50-50 would be if weights are close. Yeah, when we were the same weight, I beat him 12 times anyways, you know.
SPEAKER_04: It was 70 kg, Zloty finals, he has seen it, he has watched it. Yeah, only four weeks before that event, I was 65 kilos.
SPEAKER_03: at the WAF so I was still really recovering and still I took him even pin him they didn't give it well it's okay he won those two times with the dead wrist but then we played super match I beat him right and left 5-0 5-0
SPEAKER_04: He also remembers that Mindaugas had some loud mouth and couple of times recently, recent years, he challenged you also. He remembers that Mindaugas challenged you a couple of times.
SPEAKER_03: yeah yeah yeah since your last matches yeah yeah yeah anyway so interesting for him yeah yeah we will see we will see now i have to write down finish and go downstairs and train pronation thank you thank you very very much david and see you in istanbul and roman take care my friend thank you very much for translation
SPEAKER_03: yeah i was 75 he was 73 and a half if you think that that one and a half kilo made that the difference that i flashed him anyway so
