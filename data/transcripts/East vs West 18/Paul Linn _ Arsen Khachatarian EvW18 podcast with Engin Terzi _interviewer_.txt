SPEAKER_03: He will be with you or he will be coming? No, he is in other, I sent the links to him, he is in other city. Paul, do you know David Stepanian? Yeah, I think we met before, once or twice. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: He was one of the top 65 kilo puller in the European and World Championships. And then he moved to US. And now what are you now, David? 70 kilos, 75 kilos? Do you hear me, David? Yeah, I hear you. What's your weight now? 70, 75?
SPEAKER_03: 75 75 okay but if you need it you can you can go down to 70 kilo right
SPEAKER_02: yeah it's not a big deal for me just uh i had a surgery on my right elbow uh like a year ago it was on the august that's why i didn't compete in any competition it almost one year that's why i gained a little uh weight but 70 kilogram is a that would make your weight from sideways you know like
SPEAKER_02: hey paul how are you good how are you my friend good to see you brother yes yes we were waiting for this much yeah how is your elbow healing up what was the injury getting better getting better
SPEAKER_02: it was right here and right here both both ways i got the surgery yes yeah but now it's getting good i am doing that exercise very well anyway i can do but in the march it's a little hard so is it possible that you you raise the phone and we can see your face yeah yeah yeah yeah and did you did you check arsen if he is coming because we are four minutes past yes
SPEAKER_00: Okay. So, Paul, what's your weight now? About 218, 217 in the morning. Right around where I normally am coming into these matches. So, starting my water load right here. Two more of these to drink a day, so we'll be good. Okay. Okay. That's good. And, like, you just had a match five weeks ago.
SPEAKER_03: and like how was it you know you you pulled and how many days did you rest and then train no rest no rest we went right back into it so you come back as soon as you you arrive next day you train yes yep yep right away yep and then right back to table time on friday and saturday so
SPEAKER_03: Short camp, short camp, so no time to waste, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. But you were already in shape, so it didn't really, like, you can't really say that you didn't have time to prepare, unless you would be exhausted from the match before. Right.
SPEAKER_00: No, I try and maintain a good level the whole way throughout the year. But each opponent, I usually tweak things to train differently. You know, it's good to have eight to ten weeks to pick your approach. So I didn't really have that, but I feel good coming out of the Samusha match. I think, you know, similarities in what I was doing for Samusha can carry over into the prep for this one.
SPEAKER_03: I understand. So, David, did you reach to Arsene? David? Yes. Engin, I hear you so slow. I mean, I think I and Paul, we hear each other very well, so there must be something at your end, but did you talk with Arsene? Is he coming?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I think he's calling me, let me give a call, leave the chat and deliver, give him call, help him to join and come back. Okay. Give me a second. And the form is about the same, Paul, still very good? Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah, probably better, probably better. Better, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I mean, I'm healthy, I didn't really sustain any damage in that match, like nothing to really slow me down in the training, nothing I had to avoid. So I've been keeping the exact same cadence, you know, still doing the conjugate method through Todd, just changed a few exercises, you know, and I'm still pulling twice a week on the table with the two groups of guys I work with. So, yeah, I feel good.
SPEAKER_00: yeah um do you think that if you didn't change your training methods uh do you think that you would lose i don't know i don't know it it's hard to say i definitely feel stronger in different spots you know uh with the tweak i mean i think overall general strength movements like
SPEAKER_00: They're still on par with where they should be. But now spending more time on conjugate and side pressure, I think I've kind of shifted those general strength efforts into more arm wrestling specific stuff. So I feel good in certain spots that I didn't, you know.
SPEAKER_00: So I think it just depends on the application on the table. It's hard to say, but you know, the Samusha match was the beta test run for this style of training. So having success there, I'm going to continue on. So this probably proved that you improved more than he did since the last time you guys met each other.
SPEAKER_00: maybe maybe um i think there were there were spots that that he felt better than the first time like i felt like his his fingers and his overall like containment felt better um i think i felt a little bit better in the side pressure area you know so like i i didn't i think i learned a lot from the first the first match too and i had a lot to go off of so avoided some some mistakes i made in the first match i think that that helped
SPEAKER_03: But he definitely, Samusha is unbelievable, man. And his hand, his containment felt great. Yeah, yeah. But probably 85 kilos is his category. This is how it's looking, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: i think so i mean i think there's definitely great matches for him at 95. i think there's definitely people at 95 that he can he can beat um but i think it's it's kind of the same scenario where i'm in like i i have no problem taking matches in 105 but that's not necessarily home home is 95 you know hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello paul
SPEAKER_04: Hello. My friend, David. So, how is everything, Arsene? Good. Good? Yeah. Yeah. Can you speak English or...? I speak, but little bit English. I understand, but my English not very well. Sounds good to me. Sounds good. Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Arsene, what is your best, most successful finishing in a competition? I think you took second to Sasho. And then at the AMC, which place did you take? Arsene, the most successful competition is the one you won. Which one did you win? When did you win and which one did you lose? I think I beat Sasho in Europe, which was my second place.
SPEAKER_02: He's thinking it was the European Championship. It's 2022. The final match was with Sasho Andrei. Yeah, and which place did he take at the AMC? Where did he take us at the AMC? I have only one third place. And that's the absolute third. Where did the finalist come from?
SPEAKER_04: The finalist was Boguslav, Sergei Boguslav. But I was absolutely in the third place. I was against Dmitry Silaev and Lalezin.
SPEAKER_02: It was MC. He got second place. He lost to Sergey Bogoslav. But in the absolute weight, he got third place. He lost to Laletin and Umut Ervecik. That is one guy who is asking.
SPEAKER_03: When can we expect to host Reno Masic? He recovered from injury and with 80% strength won European 110 kg. No, my friend. His injuries with right arm, he won the Europeans with left arm. Right arm he didn't compete. Okay, so Paul.
SPEAKER_03: Do you think this is a tougher match than the Samusha match because you are pulling against someone who really belongs to that category? Yeah, I think this is a tougher match for a couple reasons. I think number one,
SPEAKER_00: Yes, it's in the weight category. But, you know, Arson is largely an unknown. There's videos out there. There's some things to study. And his accomplishments are incredible. He's young. He's fast. He's versatile. We're not talking about a one-trick pony and pulling Samusha. We know where he's going, you know. And so this, to me, this match presents like,
SPEAKER_00: a really fun opportunity because I think it might be a scenario where both guys try different things. So I'm looking forward to just seeing kind of what unfolds. But he's definitely got me on my toes as far as how I'm trying to prepare for him. So yeah, no, I'm very much looking forward to this match.
SPEAKER_00: uh the whole team out there with reg and and david egan you guys are awesome um it was sooner or later our paths have to cross today today i saw some north american rankings and the rankings i think you were ranked number one and he was ranked number two i think so one of them i think that's in the hook probably yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that one i think yeah yeah and and arson
SPEAKER_04: Are you in a better shape than when you pulled against Andrei Sharkevich? Arsene says that you are in a better shape than when you pulled against Andrei Sharkevich. I think I am. The problem is that I am 100 kg heavier than Andrei Sharkevich. I don't know how I will feel, but I think I will be better.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, he thinks he's feeling better than before, but against Andrei Sharkovich, he was at 100 kilogram, but now he's getting five kilogram lesser. So, he doesn't know how he will feel, but right now he's around 98 kilogram and feels super better.
SPEAKER_03: Mm-hmm. Arsene, can you turn your phone sideways? This one is good. I think you need to unlock the . And what did you say your rate is now?
SPEAKER_03: I'm I'm right around the same way to the same way, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah, 99, 98, 220 is 100, so 216 is about 98. So you said you are 218 or right? Yeah, 1718 in the morning. OK, every day will be less. Every day will be less. I sent. How do you see your chances against Paul?
SPEAKER_03: very high level puller but taking second at AMC is also a huge success and so we don't exactly know how to compare you because you pull Andrei Sharkevich but it was also first time we see Andrei Sharkevich at the East-West stage and how do you see your chance against Paul?
SPEAKER_02: As they say, everyone is a very high-level professional in the big MC. You were also in the MC, which is a bit difficult for them to coordinate.
SPEAKER_02: Because you participated in this association for the first time, you won the competition, but it is difficult to understand whether you will win or not. How do you assess the chances? I know that the team is very strong, very strong, very creative.
SPEAKER_02: He knows that Paul is a very good competitor. It's going to be super tough for him, but he thinks he's getting very well and he will find a way to get clean.
SPEAKER_02: And what does Paul have that concerns Arsene the most? What's that?
SPEAKER_03: He doesn't want to speak what kind of style he's going to use? No, that's not what I asked. I am asking like what does Paul have the most dangerous? I'm just saying that like what is
SPEAKER_02: What would worry him about Paul? I'm not worried.
SPEAKER_04: There is no such thing. For me, it's arresting. And what did you do? What did you do? What did you do? What did you do? What did you do? What did you do?
SPEAKER_02: He doesn't want to speak about it because he knows the pole is very tough competitor and he's getting ready and he doesn't avoid to any position because he's using like top pros using inside both ways is good for him. So he gonna to
SPEAKER_02: use both ways which one is getting better but he's not scaring because paul i say he's uh checking he has already checked it with that paul that uh he knows how is he's working how which better way is better for him so he knows everything about the poll yeah but but david he understood that i'm not asking him which style he's gonna use he understood that right
SPEAKER_03: yeah okay okay as long as he understood that is okay because i don't want him to think that i'm trying to find out which style he's gonna use like if somebody would ask me if i'm pulling pauline i would just say his wrist and his explosive into the side way you know
SPEAKER_03: It's the Paul way, but whatever he's going to use against the technique of the Paul. No, that's not what I asked. I wouldn't ask it. But he already knows how Paul is going to use. But it's okay for him. No, I was expecting him to answer that Paul is very explosive. First, I need to catch him and then make it endurance game and win or something. But it's okay. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: And Paul, what do you think about this young guy? I think he's a stud, man. I think he's the future of arm wrestling. I think he's got probably one of the best teams in the country to learn from and work with. Like, the sky's the limit for the guy, you know? I'm just an old guy trying to hang on by a thread. Oh, Arsene, don't believe this guy. Don't believe this guy.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah. So, Paul, let me stir the pot a little bit. You say that he's the future, but you are saying he's not today. I see what you did there, Engin. I see what you did. That's not what I meant, but if that's what we want to go with, we can go with that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. So, basically, Arsene, Paul is saying that
SPEAKER_02: You are the future, but next Saturday, no chance for you. This is what he is saying. Pavel says you will be one of the best fighters in the future, but not today.
SPEAKER_04: Just tell him that Paul didn't say that. I'm making up, you know. Oh, yeah. Too strong.
SPEAKER_01: he's uh he's telling that paul is already a little elder and i don't want to say that he's wrong maybe david i didn't understand what
SPEAKER_02: He's saying that Paul is already elder than me and I have respect, I will be quiet. Maybe he's not wrong. He doesn't want to say that Paul is wrong. It's okay. Out of respect he says that Paul is right. I'm old, I'm old. Paul is right. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Actually, Arsene has a lot of respect to the pole because we have seen the pole a lot. He's supporting all the United States team who is competing in any competition. We are checking already. Whoever is getting a win in any competition, in any match, it's a very big pole.
SPEAKER_02: Paul supports them a lot, everyone. He doesn't know what state they are living in, how they are closing. So this is very important for Arsene. He has a lot of respect and really it's going to be tough for Arsene to compete with Paul because he knows everything about armwrestling. He has a lot of experience and it's going to be super tough.
SPEAKER_00: yes this this is this one's tough too this is my first match in east versus western king of the table against a fellow team west person um and you know we he's not team west he's from armenia oh he lives in the united states it's the same like you come here you come here and then you become okay
SPEAKER_00: It's okay. Well, yes, except everybody. If Arsene is pulling against, I don't know, Iraqli, I'm rooting for Arsene. No, I understand that part of this. This guy is still American, Armenian citizen. And if he would just go compete, probably,
SPEAKER_02: Anyway, so that is the East versus West match. You shouldn't be sure about that one. That's why I am telling the gang, Paul accepting everyone, I'm supporting everyone. In the United States, all the competition, where is Paul? He's supporting all the team who is representing the United States or living here. So this is what I was talking about. Paul is the guy with the responsibility. Paul understands.
SPEAKER_03: the how to say the deep meaning of East versus West. And, and then Paul is also, I say all this, not because of what I see, but I also have a lot of times on the phone talk with him. Paul, Paul is also on a mission that, you know, to level the North American arm lasting up at least maybe not North American, but the American, because maybe
SPEAKER_03: North American, they don't really, I mean, train together all the time. But in the US, a lot of times you guys met each other and then had training together before East vs. West Masters. So I'm 100% sure that Paul, most of the times, are giving calls to his teammates and then probably they are discussing. Am I wrong, Paul?
SPEAKER_00: No, no, I, I, I try and do all my due diligence and, and learn as much as I possibly can. Cause if I don't, that's not showing my opponent enough respect. So I try to learn as much as I possibly can. And listen to like, if, if, if United States, North American arm wrestling is going to catch up with the rest of the world, we need European pullers to come and learn from.
SPEAKER_00: You know, like the guys that I work with, the Georgians in New York and stuff, these guys are huge. They've upped my level. They've taught me so much. So it's great. Anytime we have a foreign puller coming to the United States, that's a blessing to us, you know, and it just strengthens the core unit.
SPEAKER_03: But I think during all those matches, you guys also learned a lot from all those previous events. And I see that armwrestling is at a crazy, scary level. From my perspective, it's a scary level. I'm now training probably almost two months. I skipped some trainings because I went to
SPEAKER_03: during the East vs. King of the Table and then the European Championship, I skipped. But I don't know how I will do because even if I'm at my best, I see that the level is incredible. I see that the limits of
SPEAKER_03: uh, athletes are pushing. Like, Michael is saying that, like, he's, like, doing PRs, you know, still, while we see Levan is getting...
SPEAKER_03: stronger, Hermes is getting stronger, Devon is getting stronger, all other athletes, you're getting stronger, everything. So I think that this competition level is bringing Armwrestling to a crazy level, scary level. I went to the European Championships, Paul, all the youth competitors,
SPEAKER_03: I mean, they competed huge. And then only with a few days rest, they also did great at the senior categories. They didn't have enough rest. And they are muscle. In the past, when you say youth, junior, you know, it's different. Now they are like...
SPEAKER_03: they are well-rounded, they are fired up, you know, incredible. I can't imagine what will happen in five years. But that pressure, that pressure and that elevation is going to keep your feet to the fire too, Engin. So when you're training for your comeback, I'm sure that's going to make you better too. For sure, for sure. I wish I was just like a little bit
SPEAKER_03: healthier and I'm already, listen, my advantage most of the time was just knowing arm wrestling, like it will not sound humble, but in my prime, I was just 10, 20 years ahead, like about understanding arm wrestling. Now, when that understanding level is coming here, I don't know if I will still have that advantage. And when you don't have that advantage, then when it goes everything to the,
SPEAKER_03: power then you have like young stars you know they are very strong and now it is hard to hunt them all you got to do is think about that every time you're training you'll be just fine yeah i will do my best like i'm i'm motivated like a few times i started now i'm motivated after this podcast i came from romania i did pronation yesterday i did the chest tricep
SPEAKER_03: Today I will go down and do biceps and we will see, you know. And okay, so I don't think that I will,
SPEAKER_03: get a lot from you guys to say to each other, because I see whenever I see the 100% respect, it's good, it's a good thing, you know, but just, I mean, it makes things art, but we can talk. Arten, what is your goal? Like, what's your goal? Like, I'm sure you come into Chicago to beat Paul, even though you have respect, nobody's coming there to lose. And...
SPEAKER_02: Do you have a dream to win the title?
SPEAKER_02: You want to see the title of the song? What is the song? I understand that you have respect for your opponent, but what is your intention? I understand that you want to win, but what do you have against Pol?
SPEAKER_04: I don't have anything against the world. You know, I'm at a higher level now. I have to win, man. I came to win. I won't come because I like to fight, I won't come because I want to. I came because I want to win. I don't want to lose anything. I respect everything you do.
SPEAKER_02: uh uh arsen is coming to chicago for winning he doesn't come to work he's not coming there for showing any beautiful match or something like that he's coming here for getting the title getting a high level fan poll but with respect to everything is there's nothing nothing against the poll just this is competition and he's going to
SPEAKER_03: go forward, getting ahead. My friend, my friend, that's not disrespect. Anyone who is not having such a dream, I mean, I don't think that, like, I don't know, I don't know, I don't think that they should even ask for a match at this stage. Like, we all need to have that dream. I don't think politics is a disrespect, you know.
SPEAKER_02: I understand. Paul has a very high level in this weight in the United States.
SPEAKER_02: So, Arsene is a new guy here and Arsene thinks he's going to win and get a higher level. So, he doesn't think he's going to lose. He's going to lose by showing a good match, something like that. He's going to win this match. Yes, he's going to win this match.
SPEAKER_02: he's saying that in the last four years whatever i have gained we like power he's coming and uh using in the in that stage okay so unfortunately the competitors is the poll okay and paul um
SPEAKER_03: you have won the title then you lost and then the the in in 95 kilo category you only lost twice rusum and iraqi exactly yeah yeah yeah yeah and as arsene says he's coming here to win i'm sure that you are also coming to win i i know you i mean nobody comes to lose um
SPEAKER_03: And what is your, how to say, short-term goals? So the short-term goal is the one at hand. It's always the next one.
SPEAKER_00: Um, and it's important for me to achieve those short-term goals, to be able, even to be able to be considered again, to have a rematch with Iraq Lee at some point or, or, or roost them and then eventually the title. So every short-term goal is the most important goal is the only goal. So, uh, ideally as it stacks up.
SPEAKER_00: as long as I can continue to get better at every short-term increment, that'll take me to where I need to be to be able to be competitive at that championship level again. That's the goal. And, you know, being an older guy, I can't afford to take any time off or to have any missteps. So got to take them one at a time. Yeah, yeah, I understand you.
SPEAKER_03: and let's let's talk about the rest of the event let's start with alan ford and ryan how do you pronounce it he told me but his last name bellinger bellinger yeah okay you can you uh tell me your opinion uh man this is a tough one because i've talked to ian carnegie quite a bit about alan ford and he believes alan ford is at his all-time best
SPEAKER_00: And we've seen Alan do some pretty impressive stuff over the years. And he's telling me right now that Alan is the same speed, doesn't lose any speed, and he's just more powerful now. So I do think that if Ryan, if we see this hook,
SPEAKER_00: this match go into a hook, I think it's probably Ryan's world. But the question is going to be, is he going to be able to get the timing down to set that? Are we going to see a wrist-to-wrist hook? Or are we going to see Allen be able to get out on his fingers? This one's really hard for me to predict.
SPEAKER_00: What I'm hoping is that it's really close and we see it kind of go back and forth and it goes into that deep water. But it could be one of those matches that you can't predict, but goes 3-0 one way or the other. Big Grove Gold says, Paul, have you ever pulled Andre? Probably talking about Sharkovich. Yes. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: years ago, and then I practiced with him not too long ago. But I pulled, I pulled, I beat Andre in the WL amateurs many, many years ago. I beat him right and left. And then we pulled again at one of Travis Bajan's events in the overall, and then we practiced together a couple of times. Okay. Arsene, Irakli versus Mad Mask.
SPEAKER_04: I think it's 50-50 match. I think it's 50-50 match. I think it's 50-50 match.
SPEAKER_02: he's talking about the last match of the iraqi and he's saying that he is he's very good and uh but uh it's gonna be a little 50 50. he's telling directly name a little more but mostly the 50 50 he thinks okay and
SPEAKER_03: This one I will ask to Paul. Joseph Maranto versus Ivan Portela. Did you have any chance to check who Ivan Portela is?
SPEAKER_00: yeah i looked a little bit um this is a tricky one too i i really like joseph maranto man i think joseph is an awesome puller i think he adjusts well he he's he's done really well on that big stage and a lot of this match comes down to like where is yvonne really at you know like if he's that close to his peak it's going to be a tough day
SPEAKER_00: for joseph but i i tend to kind of give the edge to youth in this one uh the good news is they're both going probably to the same spot so it's probably going to be a really entertaining match i i got to give the edge to joseph i i mean and i but i wouldn't be surprised if divine comes in in like amazing form and and it goes the other way but i i'm i'm definitely rooting for joseph for sure because i think he has a real big future and he's a great representation
SPEAKER_04: Okay. And Arsene, Artem Morozov and Alex Kurdecha. Morozov. I think 100% between Morozov. It's left arm, right? Right arm. Right arm. I think Morozov. Morozov in which way?
SPEAKER_02: With both ways. Marzov is a universal puller and he thinks he will... I think Topol. He thinks Topol. And Paul, what's your opinion about this match?
SPEAKER_00: i think i think it's close and i i think i think i actually think we're going to see more adult have to hook alex and the question is can he get him there i think if moris off turns them into a hook i think it edges to moris off for sure i mean we did see alex pull very competitively inside with him in the past but um
SPEAKER_00: I think there was a slight edge. Yes, yes. Yeah, but if we're assuming that both of them, both of their arms are similar. But yeah, I think I give a slight edge to Morozov, a slight edge. But this again is a tough one to predict. Great match. Yes, yes, yes, for sure. And I will also ask you,
SPEAKER_00: Wallace Dilley versus Ricard Bormann. This match is super interesting. This is like my sweeper match. This is the one I really want to know for a lot of reasons because Wallace Dilley is really, really strong. I got the pull with Wallace Dilley at the Florida qualifiers afterwards. Now, he had pulled the tournament and I had after pulled a bunch, but that guy is tough. He is diesel, diesel strong.
SPEAKER_00: um and then you have ricard ricard borman who is killing everybody in you know in in australia and new zealand and everywhere else he's so far above everybody that it's hard to know where his level is really at
SPEAKER_00: So to me, this one is going to be super interesting. I think there is a world where Ricard could shoulder roll and go right through Wallace. But I think if Wallace can win center a little bit and stop the match, it could be interesting. But nonetheless, we're going to find out where Ricard is. And that could mean Wallace...
SPEAKER_00: you know, winds up winning the match comfortably. And now everybody's talking about Wallace. So super interesting. I'm excited because it's a newer American puller that I think has a lot of, a lot of potential. Yeah. Um, Arsene, Michael Todd versus Giorgi Di Serrano. Arsene.
SPEAKER_04: I think Michael will stand in his position if Zeranova doesn't lose a lot of weight. 60-40, I think, Michael will win. Because in these recent times, Zeranova has always been in form, but in the face of failure.
SPEAKER_02: He thinks Michael Todd will win because he thinks Michael Todd anyway will stop his famous position and make him tired and get pink. So he thinks Michael Todd. And Paul?
SPEAKER_00: I think the same thing. Um, I'm a hundred percent behind Michael. My rationale is, I think, like you said, Michael's hitting PRS. Um, we saw him perform as well as you possibly can, could perform in losing every round against Vitaly. He was able to be fast enough and get to a position in the center of the table rather than on the losing side. I think Michael's pronation is a difference maker. I think, um,
SPEAKER_00: Georgie's so good in that supinated hook position, but there's just no way to get Michael there.
SPEAKER_00: So, Georgie's going to have to, if Georgie wins, it's going to be through probably some form of a flop press that we haven't really seen him do yet. So, I think the head goes to Michael. I think he probably wins this. And also, I know Michael, and I know he is not trying to lose this match at all, especially in the current standings. It's probably a nice high-pressure match for Michael, which I think will bring the best out of him.
SPEAKER_03: Um, I want to ask you also, did you check, uh, about Elin? Elin Janheim, that is going to pull Fia Reissig? No. You don't know? I asked around, I asked around. Um, so it's correct me if I'm wrong. She has beaten Fia in the past, right? This is kind of like... Left arm, left arm, Siobhan ended up winning.
SPEAKER_03: Right arm, she beat Fia once and Fia beat her twice. But this was probably three years ago. And at that time, I think since that time, Fia improved a lot. But this girl is very, very young. So she is probably like 23 now. At that time, she was 20. So from 20 to 23, to me,
SPEAKER_03: But Fia is also in her best. And so personally, I don't know. Yeah. I don't pick against Fia, especially in the past couple of years. I don't pick Fia to lose. So we'll see. But I have a feeling Fia is on a mission. Devin versus Alex Arsene. Left arm.
SPEAKER_04: I think Devon. I think Devon.
SPEAKER_02: He thinks for sure Devon. Devon is going to control with his wrist and win this match. For sure, Devon. And Paul? Yeah, I think this is really interesting because we've seen Devon and Alex compete in practice a lot, right? And anybody who knows Devon,
SPEAKER_00: The version that you get at practice is not the version that you get on the day of competition. So I think, and Devin also is one, obviously everybody knows he's one of the most cerebral and intelligent arm wrestlers in the game. So Alex having practiced with Devin the amount of times that he has is a disadvantage for Alex, in my opinion.
SPEAKER_00: And I also think it's going to be tricky with Alex, you know, still gathering experience and everything. He's not set up with somebody like Devin. He hasn't dealt with trying to get a grip with them and feeling all those things that he does. We all see it. But to experience it is two different things. But I think what makes it interesting is how smart Alex actually is.
SPEAKER_00: Devin made some videos and talking about his IQ and overall intelligence level. I'm interested to see how that'll come into play. And if Devin actually is able to, you know, play any mind games or gain any advantage in the lead up to the match. But I think that's already a mind game to put the opponent into like the comfortable position. Alex, you are super smart. You are incredible. Like the same that he played with Hermes. And I think that's what it is, you know.
SPEAKER_03: but this is from different ways. Sometimes he tries to crush, he calls them stupid, you are not smart, and these kind of things. So now it's different here. Another one I want to ask you, Wagner Bortolato versus Manuel Batalla. Manuel also with left arm was superweight champion. And what do you think about this, Paul? Oh, man, Wagner.
SPEAKER_00: And I'm not picking him because I necessarily think he's going to win, but because I want him to win.
SPEAKER_00: I just want Wagner to win and go crazy, you know? This isn't a scientific breakdown. I just want to see Wagner go nuts and not pass out. Yeah, but not to break the table, right? No, no, no, no. Well, we don't want to see him get too worked up where, you know, somebody has to feed him gummy bears in the corner, so he got to keep going too. But I told guys to prepare another table just to make sure. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: I already said it, yeah. And Arsene, do you know this athlete, Manuel Badalian? Yeah, yeah. And what's your opinion about this match? I remember Manuel Badalian during the European Championship when he beat our friend Madojan David. One of them was very good, the other one was very bad.
SPEAKER_04: I remember it very well, but I know it's hard. But in my opinion, Bortolaton is physically stronger now. And I think there's a bigger chance that Bortolaton will win, because he's a player as a player, or physically stronger.
SPEAKER_02: He's remembering the Portolato from the European Championship.
SPEAKER_02: He remembers Manuel from the European Championships. His competitor was Armenian. Arsene has checked some styles of him. So he's a very good guy. He remembers whenever he starts first, he's super strong. But when he starts second,
SPEAKER_02: He wasn't good before, but now he has seen a lot of improvement of Manuel and he thinks he's going to win because he's very smart, he's very strong and when he's comparing like before and now, he sees a lot of difference. He thinks Valtellato will win.
SPEAKER_03: okay and paul gladiator versus the king oh my goodness man oh my goodness okay first of all first of all who am i speaking with uh paul's mind or heart so you want me to answer it both ways both ways okay
SPEAKER_00: so my mind my mind says LeBron like four zero that's what my mind like looking at everything my mind says there's no reason not to think that LeBron can't repeat everything that he's done in training you know people are talking about this this uh 400 kilogram
SPEAKER_00: or 400 pound curl and everything else that we were discussing that specific lift the other day. And I come to the conclusion that I don't care how you move 400 pounds from your waist to your shoulders. It's super impressive. And, you know, I don't care. Is it really specific? No, it's not. But it's a representation of extreme power that most of us can't even comprehend.
SPEAKER_03: So I believe that this guy is in great form, and I believe that Ermes might have pissed him off just enough to make him better. But Ken, I have a question. When you lift 400 pounds, it's not specific. So how many pounds for each arm? 200. And Ermes also does the back pressure, which is more specific, with the same amount of weight and eight reps.
SPEAKER_00: and do you do you really see so much difference in the power when you calculate that way no not necessarily not from those specific lanes but i think overall i don't think like levon is an overall to in totality he is just one of the most powerful humans ever to walk the planet so my my scientific mind says that levon wins 4-0 my heart
SPEAKER_00: says the underdog you know my heart says everything that ermine's is doing he's he's improved his riser lift he's improved his pronation lift his back pressure is at an all-time high and my heart says like
SPEAKER_00: when you see a champion win, win, win, win, win, even if you like him, like I like LeVon a lot, I don't want to root against LeVon, but my heart is like rooting to see if it is possible to beat this guy, you know, because as competitors, we always want to see, you know, the unbeatable be beaten, even if we like the guy. So my heart says,
SPEAKER_00: Ermi's got a chance what I what I really want to happen is I want it to be really contested early on in like round two and three and I want to see how the endurance plays in and just to even if LeBron wins if if he's contested by Ermi's early on then all these other guys who are chasing LeBron they get another breath of hope you know that there's going to be a way
SPEAKER_00: So, yeah, I think scientifically LeBron wins 4-0. I think in a perfect world scenario, we see a 4-3 silver bullet match, basically. But can I ask you something, Paul? When they pulled first time, what did you expect then? I expected 4-0. Okay, but when you saw those rounds,
SPEAKER_03: You know, which ones I'm talking about, like round three first start and round five, you know, this started, but the halfway stopped. Were you shocked? I was shocked. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. Yep. Yep. At that time, your, your mind was also saying like, yeah, you know, domination, but, but that, that happened.
SPEAKER_03: So what I'm just saying that, so I think that we need to think who improved more. There is a possibility because when you say that your mind says 4-0, my mind says there is a good possibility for 4-0, but there is a possibility. I can say, I don't normally give a number, but okay, I better not. But there is something that it may finish as you say, but there is a possibility that the math stops. Right.
SPEAKER_00: things can change it so i don't think that like mine should say 100 you know four zero no no i'm not putting it at a hundred percent yeah okay put a percentage on it no i'm not putting a percentage on it i'm just like like just overall prediction um but i think you made a good point about who improved more and it's tricky because ermes is pretty much showing us everything he's doing he's showing us his style of training
SPEAKER_00: he's showing us the numbers improvement so it's right there for us we know but we don't necessarily know with LeBron because he hasn't really he hasn't shared a whole lot of those PR type things and what it what it's going to do is after the match is done we're going to potentially have a better understanding of how much those specific PRs did or didn't play into the match
SPEAKER_00: So I think that's really interesting, too, because by the numbers and by what we're seeing, I think most people would say Ermi has definitely improved more since the last time. And the other thing is that before the last match, Ermias didn't believe that he was going to win.
SPEAKER_03: He didn't even really believe one round he could win, but he said if this would happen or something. This time, even yesterday, I talked with him. He believes he's going to go there and win. And that is very important. Because once you have that doubt, you're going to lose that match, for sure. So he went that way to the first match, he gave trouble. This time, he's just going there to win.
SPEAKER_00: And I think he's going to fight till the last drop of blood. I do think that that first match and the way all that played out gives Ermias a big advantage psychologically. So that's kind of why I said he's kind of been poking Levan and calling him out. I think that if that poking and that, you know,
SPEAKER_00: If he poked that bear enough and he created the same advantage for Levan that he has for himself, that could be a difference maker too. Because Levan is not the type of guy you want to piss off before you got to compete against him. I mean, at the end, it's arm wrestling. You piss off or not, you know. Sometimes being pissed off just makes your...
SPEAKER_03: mind blurry, you know. Sometimes it gets you an extra 2-3% of power too. It may give to Hermes as well. Hermes told me that he was losing 2-0 to Levan and then he looked at Levan's corner and Irakli was laughing at him. And when I saw that, he got angry. There it is. What's that? That's it. That's a prime example. But that's what happened on the round three, you know. So what I'm just saying is that being angry
SPEAKER_04: I think that it works both ways, you know. It works both ways, yeah. Anyways, Arsen, what's your opinion about this match? Well, everyone was very honest. I think Levan is going to win because he has a very big advantage.
SPEAKER_04: Ermes knows one thing that he has to do, that's the top role he has to play.
SPEAKER_04: Levan already knows what to do, that he doesn't want to go there. As you said, Levan is already a few steps away, and Ermes has that one chance. In my opinion, Levan doesn't give that chance to Ermes. In my opinion, Levan will win. Also, watching the last videos, you said that his level is higher, he was specifically prepared
SPEAKER_02: He thinks Levan will win, absolutely Levan will win because last time Levan surprised with the Ernest skills but now Levan will get much more better, will get ready much more better than before because
SPEAKER_02: He thinks for everyone it was a surprise match that Ermes got some win some match after Levan and Levan will not give any more chance to get the same position and here Levan has a lot of in every position he's pulling very well, very good and he will
SPEAKER_02: improve every position but as the Hermes has a triple position and if he will take it he maybe he can do something but Levan will stop him and will not give any chance to take any better position for uh winning so he thinks Levan will win absolutely understand um we can talk about the
SPEAKER_03: But we don't know if it's going to happen or not about La Lettine or Devon. So that's all. Paul, do you have any last words to Arsene?
SPEAKER_00: no i'm looking forward to chicago guys if you're watching make sure you buy the pay-per-view you buy it early uh if you can make it to chicago come and join if you're a puller come compete on the tournament that's going to be ahead of it it's going to be an awesome time arson thank you for the opportunity travel safe and i'll see you soon
SPEAKER_04: What do you think about Paul's last words? I want everything to be as important as possible. It is a great honor for me to be able to meet Paul as a sportsman. I would like to thank him for organizing everything.
SPEAKER_04: Thank you for everything you've done for me. We'll see each other in Chicago in a week.
SPEAKER_02: First, he's thankful to you Engin for organizing this competition and inviting him to compete in this stage. It's a very good honor to be a competitor of De Paul. It's a very good honor for him.
SPEAKER_02: Getting ready to against Paul, but by the way, it's very good, very high honor. It's honor to him to compete against Paul. So see you in Chicago. Thank you very much. And mostly he wish whatever will happen in the match, just avoiding with the injuries, nothing to happen. Whatever is going to happen without injuries.
SPEAKER_03: And Paul, one last thing I want to ask you. We just passed two days ago the 40-year-old East vs. West. How do you see it from the beginning? It started with the donations and everything during the pandemic. Yeah, like, do you remember all those numbers from your post? Do you remember them?
SPEAKER_00: like what do you remember you posted the four years the highlights of everything that was done how many athletes competed like near 150 different athletes but only 148 148. yeah that's just think about that four years starting with crowdfunding going through the pay-per-view route how hard that that is you know and the growth
SPEAKER_00: you know, is unreal.
SPEAKER_00: you know the amount of athletes that are getting opportunities you know the amount of places that have have helped have hosted events the countries that have represented their country at the events um in in four short years um that the numbers were staggering i remember just looking at the post almost 450 super matches almost unreal yeah and and you know the four-year mark is like an interesting thing too because when you look back in history of some of these promotions
SPEAKER_00: that's usually right around the time where they fold you know or something happens or something yep but we're still going yeah because because of unifying all the top athletes just like if we were not unified
SPEAKER_00: Like, we wouldn't be that successful. What? Nobody knows all those, you know, those bumps in the road that you don't tell everybody, you know? All the struggles that it took to get there, all the conversations that we've had over the years, you know, about the current state of things. How many obstacles have been overcome just to get where we are right now? How many traps? The general public will never know. How many, yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: But we never gave up, you know, strong will, you know, and this will continue to be successful as long as we are unified.
SPEAKER_00: Right. And it takes that initial passion coming from you to ignite the passion of the other arm wrestling supporters and the other arm wrestlers. And that unity is more important. The unification of support, you know, of the entire community. And it takes somebody like you who's doing it for the right reason.
SPEAKER_00: because nobody you can't do that when you're doing it for money. You can't do that when you're doing it for fame. The only way it works is if it's coming from a pure place. And we got a lot of people to thank for that. And hopefully we just continue on the same path and keep growing. Yeah, I really hope that, as you said, you know, we stay unified and we continue to make
SPEAKER_03: that mainstream dream come true i don't see i don't see any reason i mean the most most important thing is that all these top athletes being together yes yeah yeah but trust me whenever we signed a contract with the athletes i mean atlas never saw this as a
SPEAKER_03: business agreements. They saw this as an agreement for a mission. Like making our power together for a common goal. That is what Levan told me, what Hermes told me. Maybe a few athletes were just focused on self goals, but the majority of the athletes, they were all
SPEAKER_03: here only just for a common goal. Trust me. That's what makes me very happy that all these athletes, they have never seen me like a boss or something in the past or today. I have always been their brother in arm wrestling. They know that Engin has good intention for us. If Engin is doing it, he's doing it for a good reason and things like that. They trust me. I trust them.
SPEAKER_03: And that is how we came to, as long as we have that amateur spirits. Yes, business is professional needs to be, but the spirit inside of us, which is the intention, as long as we have that good intention, nothing can stop. But if we ever lose our intention and lose the spirits, it can't go any further. Right. The contracts are like signing to be a part of a team.
SPEAKER_00: You know, it's like making a team, you know, and there's an acceptance level to that, too, where most of I think a lot of people see it from the wrong perspective. And we talk about united like focus and everything for me to to to be able to be a part of East versus West means that I'm being a part of a world level team of athletes that I'm just happy to be associated with.
SPEAKER_00: I'm just happy to be able to be associated with the best European pullers in the world. That's where I wanted to be when I started arm wrestling. So for me, there's never even a thought. And not to mention the East West and King of the Table team, that team that's putting it on, it's the best that there is. Why would you ever want to be? You never were in this for money. I know directly from long phone calls and everything, you know, I mean,
SPEAKER_03: I think you would even pull without money. I'm not saying that, but you would. This is the thing that I get from you, you know, like you were just happy. You don't need the money that comes to you from harnessing. You make your living. But the pride of it, the excitement, the dream, you know,
SPEAKER_03: That is worth much more than what you are making. There's no value. There's no value you can put on that. Dollars don't pay for that type of stuff. And Arsene, you really wanted to be part of East vs. West for a long time. You sent me messages, Arsene. There were some difficulties, but everything finished now. And now, are you happy to be on that stage?
SPEAKER_02: yes of course of course yeah you deserve it you deserve it well deserved um
SPEAKER_04: There was a time when I used to say that I was part of the competition. Now it's the time when I'm part of it. I'm thankful for everything, for organizing those competitions, those matches. I understand that this armwrestling is a big family for me.
SPEAKER_04: I love you all. I'm very happy and thankful for everything. Let's try to be stronger so that we can move forward in the family.
SPEAKER_02: So, two years ago he was thinking about when he was chasing this march, this stage. He was thinking about it when will come a day when I will appear in this stage or not.
SPEAKER_02: So now he's super happy that he's competing in this stage. Right now he has a competitor like Pauline and this is already... He's very surprised, very happy for all of this and he's very happy, he's going to continue
SPEAKER_02: this uh to be in this stage uh as much as possible she's planning to get much more uh level has much more uh much again in this stage and uh the mostly this is even uh this whatever is he's not going for like uh the goal is not to make money the goal is to be here and
SPEAKER_02: The goal is the performance, what he can do in this stage.
SPEAKER_02: This is the most important thing for him and this is whatever is happening in this stage it's because of Hewitt Engin and we understand it's super hard to negotiate a lot of the competitors a lot of these athletes to take them in one stage some people are asking a lot of strange
SPEAKER_02: uh questions so we are it's very hard so now you are very hard yeah he's smart like smart he understands yeah it's very hard but we appreciate it and we are doing whatever we can just make you uh something easier for you for the association for uh going forward together yeah thank you
SPEAKER_03: Anyways, Arsene, the last word is that you said that you want to be on this stage as soon as possible. This is the guy there with the hat is standing on your way. You know, I'm not saying anything else. I had to, I had to steer the boat. I know, I know. I'm used to it now. You guys, you guys take care and thanks for being part of it. And let's do a bicep flex before we.
SPEAKER_03: yeah yes yes two strong guys take care guys and thanks to everyone guys take care guys
