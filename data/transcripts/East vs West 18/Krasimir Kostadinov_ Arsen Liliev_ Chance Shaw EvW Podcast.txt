SPEAKER_03: Hello, hello everyone. Today we will have special guests. Krasimir Kostadinov, a legend in my opinion. Arsen Lilliev is another one. And Chance Cho, in my opinion, one of the most knowledgeable guys, especially about North American armwrestling.
SPEAKER_03: And they will be our guests. And we will be talking about upcoming King of the table. The truth is, and everyone, everyone says this. That is one of the best cars I have ever made. And it is a great event for sure. I really hope that it
SPEAKER_03: I mean, it will be same at the table as it is on the paper. Let me share the link on social media. And then I think very soon our guests will be joining.
SPEAKER_03: I'm very curious about their opinions, especially Krasimir's opinion for Nugo versus Matt Mask match. That is a very important match and people are very curious about the action.
SPEAKER_03: sharing on Instagram as well and then we will start and I will start reading your messages and
SPEAKER_03: Let me start reading the chat. Todd and Oleg's love child. Engin, how is your training? Ah, training is good. Response is good, but now a little, this area a little bit hurts, so I need rest.
SPEAKER_03: be more like chest and tricep. And today also after the training, I started to have some physiotherapy, especially for my neck and upper back. I have a lot of issues there. I'm 100% sure that like without this kind of help, I don't think that I can handle a serious
SPEAKER_03: training session. Will King of the Table 14 be in East versus West 12 stage? Yes, my friends. Yes. Hello, hello, Kamil. Hello, my friends. I love Kamil. Kamil and his family is a very good example of arm wrestling family.
SPEAKER_03: And let's see. K-70 says, Hello, Engin. Hello, Maaz. Zaid says, Salaam Alaikum, Engin. Alaikum Salaam. Herhashi says, Is Arsene coming back? I don't think so, but we can ask him. If you guys remind me, I can ask. And hello, Mohammed.
SPEAKER_03: Voxel, my friend, yes. Today, today, Hermes sent me some pictures after training. And, of course, I'm not going to share. If he wants, he can share. But he looks dangerous. He really looks dangerous. But, you know, being dangerous alone is not enough to beat Levan, you know.
SPEAKER_03: I'm not saying he cannot beat, but just because he's dangerous, it doesn't mean that because his opponent is the most dangerous one. No, we are not going to see the VIPs on the stage, my friends. Oh, my friend, if you have a wrist injury,
SPEAKER_03: You know, those people for many years they study and they would know, even they sometimes don't know what it is without MRI, you know, results. So I wouldn't, you know, ask people, you know, I have this injury, so what to do, you know. Like people may mislead you, you know. Sometimes we all need to know how to say we don't know.
SPEAKER_03: Hello, gummy bear guy. Yeah, hello, Engin. How are you, Chance? I'm doing well, and yourself? Good, good. Good to see you. Good to see you. You as well. Jiren says, hello, Engin. Is Ozan Kocak still training? Yes, he just won the Nationals in 242s. Where is Liliev? He's going to come soon. Liliev and Krasimir...
SPEAKER_03: So how is everything? Training or still no training? No, not so much training. Come on.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I'll be training soon. I'll be training soon. You know, I hurt my back. I have an excuse. What's your excuse? I hurt my back. I have three herniated discs. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I've heard about that one. Yeah. Yeah. So I'm just I was not walking for like a month. So I'm getting back to walking. And plus, my daughter is born now. So I've just. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Once again, congratulations. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: And I'll be training. I promise soon. Yeah. I mean, you're, you're, you're a very good arm master. You should be training. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. Felipe says, hello, greeting in expecting a great podcast. I'm sure because guests are very good. Yeah. Hello. Obelisk, the tormentor. I don't know what that means, but what's tormentor means? Uh, like someone who's, uh,
SPEAKER_03: I don't know the best way to explain it, maybe. Commentary, like someone who's messing with someone. Oh, okay. I think Arsene just came. But we are waiting. Hello, Arsene. You look good. You look young. Good. Hello, Arsene. Say hello. Arsene, you have some little bit maybe internet issues. So how are you, my friend? Thank you. Good, good.
SPEAKER_03: I'm on the mountains and maybe some problems, some problems. Oh, okay. But now it looks good. Yeah. I think Krasimir also came. Yeah. Great guys. Yeah. Let's see. So you look good, huh? Like before you didn't look healthy, like are you training or what's happening? You know, you look again, younger. Hello Krasimir. No, you know, because when you,
SPEAKER_03: Hello, Krasi. Hey, guys. What were you saying, Arsene? When you have my job, it's problem for you, you know. But when you relax, your face is younger. Oh, okay. I thought it has something to do with the general health. So, any training or no?
SPEAKER_03: no thank you no no right yeah we were this close almost you come back almost yeah yeah we need one step like is is there anything that i can do so that you can come back or no no no no you don't oh no no and for you it's you you where is krasimir it's difficult to me to speak you on english with you
SPEAKER_02: I'm here, Arsen, I'm here. Hello, hello. I wanted to say that Engin did everything and no one else in this world could do anything to make me return to armwrestling. Engin, Arsen said that you did everything and no one in this world could do it better than you, but...
SPEAKER_03: He just didn't come back, but you almost made him come back. Almost, almost. I was that close. Yeah. You know, you know, Tracy, like, it is not easy to race people like Arsene Lille. So it is sad that he disappears when the time is, like, really good for our machine, you know. So I just wanted all the old legends to come back. But if it doesn't happen, it doesn't happen, you know.
SPEAKER_03: So how are you, Krasimir? I'm good. Just finished training session with Georgi Tsvetkov. Okay. Give us some information. How is he feeling? He is very, very strong right now. Is his left hand strong? Yes, yes. I couldn't do anything. Do you think he's going to beat David? In my eyes, that he can.
SPEAKER_02: may have the edge in the first one, two rounds, but I believe in the second or in the third round, Georgi will be able to top roll him and to take his wrist and eventually will win the match. This is what I think. So you are expecting a close match? Yes, yes. But Georgi has very good endurance and most likely
SPEAKER_03: He will win with endurance. This is what I see. I have my own opinion and I have shared before, but I would like to know about your opinion. What does Georgi have that Alex Kurdecha didn't have? Pronation and top specialist? With left? Yes, I believe Georgi's pronation is way better with left.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, Kurdesha is more like side going while the... Yes, yes. ...Georgi is a specialist to take the risk, you know. Yes, yes, exactly. Yeah. I think with right hand, Kurdesha is also specialist about taking... Yes, with... Left is more side, you know. Yes, yes, yes, exactly, exactly. Yeah, yeah. And Arsene, have you been following the matches? Yes, yes, yes, of course, indeed. And you asked me where the event is going to be. Are you coming?
SPEAKER_03: You know, I very want and maybe Tzakhilov, Tamraz, he will come too with me. Tzakhilov? Oh, yes, yes. Wow, another legend. I'm very curious, you know, like the people over here, how many people right now, 140, you will go more, in these 140 people, how many people knows who Tamraz Tzakhilov?
SPEAKER_03: Another legend. You don't know, Chance? I don't know. Wow. Maybe if I saw a picture or a video. That is also an incredible guy, yeah. I think eight times WOC champion. Yes. Yeah. Which category? He's 60, 65, 70, 75, yeah. Wow. Four different categories, yeah. And so, Arsene, what do you think about Dadikian versus...
SPEAKER_03: You were in Tbilisi and you saw the match live, you know, Kordesha and Dadikian. Were you surprised? Yes, very surprised, Engin, very surprised because I think the leftâ€¦ Engin, I will speak Russian. Okay, yeah, go ahead. I mean, Krasimir, would you mind to help? I will try to translate. Okay, thank you, thank you, Krasimir.
SPEAKER_00: Thank you, thank you, Krasimir. I was very surprised by this match, because it seemed to me that Kurdech's left hand was very good. And even my friend Krasimir says that Cvetko is in very good shape, but this is probably the only match where the favorite, well, it seems to me, is more obvious, and this is Dadikyan. Especially if he gains 100, how he fought, if he gains good weight, then with his left hand, it seems to me, he will be a favorite in this match.
SPEAKER_02: So he said that in Georgia when he saw Kurdecha he was very surprised at what the decant did to Kurdecha because he was thinking that Kurdecha's left is very solid and that's why right now most of the matches are pretty close but this one for him is the decant is the heavy favorite. Against Yogi Svetko? Yes, this is what he thinks.
SPEAKER_03: like Kurdey was very big. He was like a mountain in Tbilisi, huge. Whenever you see him, you would be intimidated. But the same with Dadikyan. Those arms look like he's from a science fiction movie. They just put it from the sides, you know, two arms, just with the forearm and everything. They say now, Arsene, 130 kilo ihertz right now he is.
SPEAKER_03: This is what I heard. We will see in Istanbul. But this is Denis Splenko told to one of our common friends in 130 kilo. And I said this before, I'm going to say again.
SPEAKER_03: David has the goal to become number one. Whenever I offer him the match against Kurdesha, he's like, Engin, you know. And then two days later I said, yes, Engin, that was my main dream, to become the absolute champion. Why not? Okay, let's go, you know. And now he has another challenge and he's growing. And he told me that he wants to beat Vitaly Laletin.
SPEAKER_02: And again, I want to say something. Yes. In my mind, David Dedikian's left is world's second best arm by hooking ability. The first one is Yurdan Tzonev, the second one in my eyes is David Dedikian. Because I'm judged by watching Dedikian and Yurdan Tzonev against Vitaly Oletin.
SPEAKER_02: because the decant was close to hook Vitaly with left, but still Vitaly was able to top roll his left. Yeah, but when was it? When was it? Like, he's very young right now. I mean, like the time that you saw the training you're talking about?
SPEAKER_02: Yes, yes, but still, I'm talking what I have seen. When Jordan Tonev pulled with Vitaly with left, Vitaly was not able to top roll him with left. He was beating him to the side, but he was not able to take his wrist. Yeah, but you know how the difference, I will tell you, Krasi? Tarek Young goes without giving up on his pronator, he goes like this, while Jordan is just giving up so much and coming forward and giving up on his pronator.
SPEAKER_03: And then you understand. So I would like to see his wrist when he tried to protect his pronator and do the wrist curl. Because I think I have seen Devin took his wrist, I think, if I'm not mistaken. Yeah, but it was a very, very solid match.
SPEAKER_04: uh we'll see what will happen okay and let's go to chance chance how do you see this match daddy kian versus georgie swedco i think uh i think it's a really interesting match i'm really excited for it um i i have to agree a little with crassi i think uh daddy kian in the first round or maybe even the second round might just be too much uh but once every round that goes by georgie's chances get get higher
SPEAKER_04: I think Dadikyan has more horsepower, but we'll see. In my eyes, it's 50-50. I'm rooting for Giorgi, though. Giorgi is a friend of mine, so I'll root for Giorgi. Okay, okay. So let's go to with Krasimir. Zurab Tavberize versus Giorgi Tavutie. Okay.
SPEAKER_02: This, in my eyes, may be the only mismatch on the card. It will be interesting, at least the first round, but I think that Gheorghi will take Zurab's wrist and we will be able to beat him.
SPEAKER_03: Is there any possibility that, you know, like, you know, how Sasho just really supines and press like this? Do you think that Zurab can do similar thing? No, I don't think so. I believe Zurab is better than Sasho against hook pullers, but against top rowers, not even close. Okay. And Arsen?
SPEAKER_00: In my opinion, I agree with Krasimir. I think Georgy will be able to beat him, but I think the question is whether he will have enough power. Zurab is an athlete, he has the power of the body, chest muscles, strong shoulders. Will it be enough for Georgy to beat him even with a broken hand? But I will root for him and I will hope that
SPEAKER_00: yeah a sense that that most likely
SPEAKER_02: will happen what I just said, that Gheorghi will take his risk. It will be maybe interesting to see if Gheorghi will be able to finish because Zourabh has very solid body, very solid chest, shoulder and his side pressure will be way stronger than Gheorghi's. But he will be rooting for Gheorghi and he hopes that Gheorghi will be able to finish the match.
SPEAKER_04: Is this Zurab's first big match since his break? No, no. He pulled Petro Marharin. Oh, right, Petro. Yeah, yeah. I think Georgie will have too much outside.
SPEAKER_04: Zurab's hand is, from what I felt when I pulled him, he doesn't have that great of containment. And Georgi is, or that's how you say his name? I think it's Georgi. It's Georgi, yes. Georgi. Yeah, my American friend. Can I ask you something? In Bulgarian, is it still Georgi or Georgi? Georgi. Georgi, right? Georgi, yeah, okay. Okay, Georgi, sorry.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I think Gorgi will win pretty convincingly. Now, if Zurab is somehow able to stop it for long enough with his side pressure, like Arsene is saying, maybe it could be interesting. Zurab also has the press, but I just think that his hand is going to get opened up and probably 3-0. Yeah. Okay, now...
SPEAKER_03: We have two matches that I'm going to ask in a row. I think Krasimir is the most knowledgeable guy to answer this.
SPEAKER_03: The first one is Petro Marharins versus Lachlan. When you pull Lachlan, you beat him, but you said that Lachlan was very strong. You know, you said that he was very strong and you had to use some speed and you had to do a little bit adjustments and experience to beat him. This is what I saw and I think you said the same. So, and from other side, we have Petro Marharins.
SPEAKER_03: like, near impossible to top roll this guy. I'm not saying impossible, but near impossible. His wrist, like, probably his topping power is just probably strongest pound for pound. Yes. And so these things,
SPEAKER_03: Lachlan is someone who has very strong bicep, you know, arm power. So, looks like they are going where they like to go. So, how do you see this match, Krasi? And I'm very curious about your opinion. This is the second match that I believe. There are how many matches there are totally? Twelve.
SPEAKER_02: I believe 10 matches will be super exciting and these are the two matches that won't be that exciting because I believe Petro will be too much for Lachlan. Just for Petro, you need super solid wrist.
SPEAKER_02: Even though he's a hook puller, he puts so much pressure on the wrist and the fingers. Oh, he still uses pronator? Yes, yes. And his hand is huge. Yeah. And you need very, very solid hand to be able to curl him deep. So I believe these are the two matches that will be not... I believe 3-0, 3-0. All the other matches I cannot say, but these are the two matches that I would bet money. Hmm.
SPEAKER_03: I may lose, but... Krasi, I have a question for you. In a professional armwrestling, I mention this especially, like Petro, what kind of chance does he have in 105 category? He has all the chance to be the champion. Even against Devon? Devon...
SPEAKER_02: I don't know. Devon is very hard to beat if you don't have press. Petro doesn't have press. Do you think 100% Petro is going to lose his wrist? Against that shitty move under the table, yes. No, no. Under table is not allowed. This much is allowed. This, no. This, yes.
SPEAKER_02: Still against Devon, I believe you need to have strong side pressure and pressing. Without pressing, I don't see anyone beating him.
SPEAKER_00: He said that he cannot be objective because he doesn't know Lachlan. He knows Petr, but he doesn't know Lachlan and he cannot see.
SPEAKER_04: okay then then chance show i'm sure he has opening yeah i i think uh petro's heavy favorite maybe 90 10 i agree with crassy uh i don't think like if it's only arm power then maybe it could be close but petro's style i think it
SPEAKER_02: think he'll beat lachlan pretty easy yeah arm to arm to arm they're pretty so pretty close yeah what i think but just the petals petrus wrist when he cups he leaves you in so bad position that
SPEAKER_03: You and Petro had a very long match in Antalya, very tough match. You lost that match but you ended up winning the gold medal. Yes, actually the first goal I was going to beat him. I stopped him and I started to take him back and he saw that he is losing and he air-wolfed out.
SPEAKER_03: And the second time he didn't go so much back. He moved more forward and curved my pronation. Yeah. Anyway, so let's go to the next one. And this one also, you are probably the best guy to answer. I already asked you this. Nugo versus Matt. You said that when you pull Matt,
SPEAKER_02: Like I think you said, when you pulled against Nugo, you were in better shape. Yes, yes, yes, yes. In my eyes, Nugo is the favorite in this match. Matt Mask, there is a huge possibility to take his wrist, but I believe even if Nugo loses a little bit the wrist, still his side pressure and back pressure may be enough to win the match. I don't know.
SPEAKER_02: Do you think is there any possibility that Nugo to top roll, Matt? Yes, yes. From this match, I can expect anything except Matt for hooking Nugo. But I can see Matt taking the wrist and winning convincingly. I can see also Nugo taking the hand and winning convincingly. So, anything is possible. And what is the chance for Matt to win?
SPEAKER_03: It's very close match in my eyes. You just said that even he takes the risk, Nugo can still win or something. I don't know. I misunderstood. Just Nugo is not that strong here, but his back pressure and pronator, everything is super solid. And it supports the hand, right? It supports his hands. Yes, yes. Yeah. And Arsene? Arsene, you there?
SPEAKER_00: Yes, yes, yes, Ngin. As for such amazing natural data as Matmask, I think Krasimir is probably the best.
SPEAKER_00: Who can solve any match and even add something difficult to me. Amazing physics, side pressure, nougat. I think even if Matt Musk can beat him, he won't win easily. Therefore, my favorite in this match is probably a Georgian athlete.
SPEAKER_02: He is totally agree with what I said that even if Matt takes Nugo's hand, Nugo is so strong here that most likely to not be enough for Matt Mask to win even if he takes the hand. I have never seen Nugo losing his wrist and still, you know, have you? I remember the day that you did final with him.
SPEAKER_03: Like one start, Andre Capriano took his wrist and pinned him. Yes, yes. So once he took the wrist, he quickly pinned him, you know. But, I mean, the second start was different, of course. But, like, are you convinced, are you sure that if his wrist is taken, he can still... No, I'm not, but this is what I'm thinking, that he may still be able to pull.
SPEAKER_02: Because I felt that here he's very solid. He's very solid here. Okay. And Chance? I think... I can add something to this match. Go ahead, Arsene. Arsene will add something more. What's that? He will say something more. Okay, go ahead, Arsene. Go ahead.
SPEAKER_00: After what I saw in Georgia, I came to the conclusion that armwrestling has already changed. If in our time there was an obvious hooker, Rasimir, an obvious top scorer, then now armwrestling is all about physics and side pressure. This is what concerns this match. Matt Musk is a great top scorer, but he is a one-sided athlete.
SPEAKER_00: And in this match, it seems to me that these are the new trends, the new, how to say, the flow in armwrestling, that everything is decided by the side movement, and even with a broken wrist, all athletes can fight.
SPEAKER_02: He said that back in the day, it was more likely to be to see a hook puller or just a top rower. But lately, in Georgia, when I was there, I saw that today, the most important move in the arm wrestling, this is the side pressure. Doesn't matter if you're a hook puller or top rower, you need the side pressure to win the match. This is what he said. I agree. Ken?
SPEAKER_04: yeah um i think i think nugo definitely possesses the tools to beat matt mask um if if nugo executes perfectly i think that he has the chance to sweep matt mask but um it's it's difficult to pull matt he's so fast his hand is so big and he goes backwards and sideways so hard like uh i'm like krazy has pulled him as well i think he can agree like it's it's just a lot to deal with um
SPEAKER_04: i thought i thought matt would lose his last match and he proved me wrong and this time i think matt will win on paper nugo's the favorite but i think matt will win okay uh krasimir jocelyn versus eggly i believe eggless experience uh eggless experience will prevail
SPEAKER_03: So you are saying that doesn't matter how strong Jocelyn is, Egli will find a way to win. I believe the match will be close when it's strength to strength. I think Egli's experience will prevail. Okay. Arsene, have you watched the event from Texas, Arlington? No, Egli, no, no, no. So you don't know Jocelyn, right?
SPEAKER_00: No, I only know Egle. The Egle I knew in the past was an amazing athlete. She's lost some weight over the years, but I think her knowledge, her strength, her endurance will win this match.
SPEAKER_02: He said that what I knew from Eglia from the past, she was just incredible. And maybe she lost something during the years, but still her experience and strength will be enough to win this match. And Chance? I for sure think...
SPEAKER_04: Egla, by far, has a lot more experience. That's obvious. But I think Jocelyn is quite a bit stronger than Egla. Jocelyn's coming in super powerful. A lot of strength background. It's been carrying over to arm wrestling well. I mean, she just dominated Sarah Backman, and Sarah is obviously no slouch. Obviously, Egla dominated Sarah last time they pulled as well. I think it's an interesting match. I would give the edge to Egla, but it could be...
SPEAKER_03: either way in my eyes okay let's go to the next one we already talked about that one kamil yablonsky i'm very curious about your opinion i really don't know what to say i expect anything from this match no favorite in my eyes but do you think that if kamil can do this and go to the winning position and if
SPEAKER_03: Zerano's bottom side of hand fails and then turns on the brachioradialis. Do you think he can beat him with the outside hook? No, no, no. So you are saying that Zerano needs to keep the match inside? Yes, yes. Zerano definitely needs the matching hook. If he tries top rope, he will lose. This is what I think.
SPEAKER_02: But if he hooks, I don't know who will win. Because we didn't see Kamil's hook tested yet. Yeah, but I believe he is very solid because we saw Kamil's right arm hook with Morozov and it was pretty solid as well. And we know that Kamil's left is dominant, so I believe even in hook he will be very good. Arsene?
SPEAKER_00: It's hard for me to add something after Krasimir.
SPEAKER_00: I have the same opinion. Georgy needs to fight in the hook, and I think he has a lot more chances there. In general, the fight of Kamil Jablonski... I don't like this fight. I absolutely don't like it. It's a fight when a person doesn't try to control his hand. I don't know. Ivan Matyushenko completely showed how to fight such athletes. And I think there shouldn't be...
SPEAKER_02: uh he said that it's very difficult to add something after what i said but he just he doesn't like the way camille is pulling but obviously it's very successful and ivan matushenko showed to everyone what
SPEAKER_03: a man needs to do against such a technique. Just to be strong in hook, this is what you need to win against that move. Otherwise, you lose. Ivan told me that after he beat Kamil with right arm, they at the side table, they pull also left.
SPEAKER_03: And whoever was faster was winning. He said that when Kamil was faster, Kamil was winning. When Ivan was faster. So he felt like Kamil's left was not his right. And Ivan tells me that, especially recently, his left is better than his right. So Kamil's left is a little bit different level, you know, compared to right. And chance.
SPEAKER_03: sorry can you remind me uh georgie's last left-handed match uh he he beat wagner bortolato uh three two right yeah but it was just after some covet breaks like he trained it's been a while yeah yeah two months and then and then training he just came and he was very close match
SPEAKER_03: But trust me, that is not the best of Deserano, especially now. He's very near to 140 kilos. Very strong guy, yeah. I mean, Vitaly made him look like not super strong because Vitaly, you know, but now when he will have his cup, probably he will show all his power. But we don't know if it's going to be enough or not.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, it's hard for me to pick anyone against Camille. I think Camille has the chance of, he can give anyone in the world a good match and he can beat most people. I mean, Georgie to me is like a bit of a question mark. I don't really know how his level is now compared to before. So for me, I'll pick Camille. I have a question for all of you, if you guys can answer quickly.
SPEAKER_03: um how would you do top five ranking in overall left arm crossing oh this is very hard question i cannot answer fast i don't know no need detail but just just rank them you know like
SPEAKER_03: I don't know. You don't have to if you don't want to. It's very hard for me. I may say something stupid, so I prefer to don't answer. Because you need to think a lot about this. Yes, yes. But listen, listen, nothing you will say will be stupid. Who can prove otherwise? Like what you say may be right. What people think is stupid, like maybe it's stupid. You understand? Maybe not. We don't know.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but still it's very difficult to rank the guys. That's why I like tournament singing. That's why I like tournaments. And I think someday you should do some tournaments. Yes, yes, but Krassi, Krassi, the tournament is just like...
SPEAKER_03: Like, you need to be a little bit lucky with the draw. Yeah, but this is life, endgame. This is life. No, I know it's life, but just what is the professional sport that you see them like boxing? Do you see them like boxing? Like it goes like a major Olympic that you have like quarterfinal, final, final. Professional, two guys goes, whoever better, better. You want to beat the guy? You need to beat the guy. You know, you need to beat someone like Kamil. You need to beat someone like
SPEAKER_03: uh uh laletin but but why do you need to have a like just imagine round one laletin versus morozo the the first round in tbilisi and then kamil would beat the out of them the second round yeah yeah i agree but if you want more accurate rankings no that doesn't make it accurate equity is a super match
SPEAKER_02: But we need so many super matches that it's not possible. That's why I organized. Do you know how many I organized?
SPEAKER_02: Yes, I agree with you and that's great, but just with left, for example, in the Super Heavyweights, we just had a few super matches in the last few years. It's not enough. What do you mean? How many super matches in the last few years? A few. A few? What are you talking about?
SPEAKER_03: I believe for rankings, we need a lot more super matches or just a few tournaments a year, two, three tournaments a year. This is what I believe. I think I'm organizing a lot of matches, but of course it needs to go more. But community needs to support. Community, if they support, we can do every one month. Instead of eight events, we can do 12 events a year. I mean, if community says, let's make armwrestling even
SPEAKER_03: And then we do it, but that is like right now, why we organize eight, not because we can't organize more. It is because that is what is requested from the community because we have, we understand how much they want, but of course, maybe with time, you know, we will do more. Chance, do you want to answer anything at least top three? Just like quick off the top of my head, if I had time to think, maybe my list would change, but I would say Vitaly,
SPEAKER_04: Morozov, Darikian, Kamil, and maybe Sparung. How about Alijan? Does he have a chance? Oh, yeah. So many, huh? So many. It's good. And imagine if also Levan comes back. Yeah, yeah. Levan, I will never count until he pulls, though, because he hasn't pulled left in so many years. But Alijan, I could, I mean, he may be number one even. I don't know.
SPEAKER_00: I agree with all this that Chen said and I will add Yurdan Sonev as well to that list with left. Arsene, how about you? As for the left hand, I want to agree with you, Krasimir, because now the left hand is more interesting and more competitive than the right hand.
SPEAKER_00: As for the left hand, a lot of athletes are on the same level. Vitaly, Morozov and Dadikyan are on the same level. But since Dadikyan is making progress, I would like him to improve.
SPEAKER_00: He became number one with his left hand. But you're absolutely right, we need more tournaments with our left hand, because it's very interesting to look at the left hand. The right hand is clear, it's a favorite, it's Lebanon, and the left hand will change from tournament to tournament.
SPEAKER_00: Yes. And again, Alsen just said that he's agreed with me that we need a lot more super matches to be accurate with the rankings.
SPEAKER_02: and he said that with left actually the super heavyweights is way more interesting than the right because with the right we have Levan who is already for seven years above everyone with the left is different story with the left there can be way more matches that are so close that would be so interesting to see yes yes yes
SPEAKER_02: yeah but we need a lot more super matches too i'm doing my best if i'm not doing it nobody is doing it yeah no we don't we don't say this singing just uh the uh the tournament system may include way more competitors yeah but but trust me i don't like tournaments it's not gonna give you the the the pay results always
SPEAKER_00: As for the left-hand side, what I want to say, and what you said about tournaments. The most, probably, for me, very bright fight was when Morozov and Lletin were fighting. It's just interesting. This is from the side of those who don't even understand armwrestling. We'll get to this match, but it was so insanely interesting for me to watch.
SPEAKER_00: As Sen just said,
SPEAKER_02: The match between Morozov and Vitaly was just amazing. Amazing. Especially round one when he was like this and he was like, Davai Vitaly, Davai. And he said that even if you don't understand armwrestling, you would love to see this match.
SPEAKER_03: and also the match between Gasparini and Michael Tocchi. These two matches, it doesn't matter if you're an armist or not, you would love to see. Yeah, I agree. It was incredible. I said this many times, I want to repeat again. A lot of people disrespected Morozov. He made it so personal. Not to Vitaly, but to some haters. And then...
SPEAKER_03: Whenever he stopped him, and then whenever Vitaly couldn't pin him, whenever he was screaming Davai, he was not screaming only to Vitaly, but all those people that disrespected him. And he was just like, it was incredible. I was there, right there. I was like, wow. I loved it. I loved it. And Vitaly also showed huge heart. But anyway, so let's go.
SPEAKER_02: Pauline vs David Samusha I really don't know what to say as a result of this match. I believe Pauline is the stronger guy. Maybe he will be dominating the center in the first rounds. But if he will have the finishing power to
SPEAKER_02: to pin him three times. I don't know, I don't know. He needs to be fast, very fast. Yes, the guy with better endurance is Samusha, so I believe Samusha is the favourite because his endurance is better. Pauline is the stronger guy in my opinion, but I don't see him winning three times. I think, you know what happened the first time they pulled, if I'm not mistaken,
SPEAKER_02: Samusha was winning 2-1. I thought it was over because of Samusha's endurance. No, it was 2-0 for Paulin, then 2-2 and then Paulin found the strength to win the third round. Okay, but he won the last round, right? Yeah, but he changed. The first four rounds, they were pulling in hook and the fifth round,
SPEAKER_03: uh paul top road here no he didn't take his wrist no but he top rode him and pushed him to the side so just because you have endurance it doesn't mean that there is a guarantee that you're gonna meet no no no guarantee no guarantee yes yeah and arsene
SPEAKER_00: For me, Samusha is a quiet superhero. He's never very emotional, but he does his job so well, 85 kilos. And I think, yes, guys like David Samusha or, for example, Todd Hutchins...
SPEAKER_00: To beat them, you need speed. If they catch you, if he can hold you, his endurance will be enough. You need to beat them quickly. Krasimir, I know that for sure. So I think David will be the favorite in this match. Not an easy favorite. The match will be very interesting, very close, but I think the score will be 3-0.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, so he said that for him Samusha is like a quiet superhero. He doesn't speak too much, he's so calm, but he does what he does as full professional and so impressive. Guys like him, he has so good endurance that if you want to beat him, you need to be fast. Otherwise, if it's a dogfight, most likely he will win.
SPEAKER_03: By the way, you are wrong about this. You see the result here? 2-0 for Samusha or 2-1? 2-1 for Samusha. As I told you, 2-1 Samusha was winning.
SPEAKER_04: And then Polin came back and won round 4 and round 5. Okay, so how do you see the chance? I think Polin is going to win 3-0. Wow. Yeah, I don't think Samusha, like if this was 7 rounds, then maybe Samusha will win 4-3.
SPEAKER_04: but I don't think Samusha is going to have the power to stop him. That's just my opinion. I think Samusha probably improved a little bit since their last match. I think Paul has improved more since their last match.
SPEAKER_04: don't think samusha is stronger than lachlan for example uh i don't think samusha at 80 well no this is 95 right 95 yeah yeah so what's samusha's weight gonna be he's walking around like 90 or 90 yeah yeah yeah no i'm taking paul 3-0 hey just just if this happens it will make me feel really good yeah yeah exactly it would
SPEAKER_03: It's funny how you and Lachlan were so close, and then Paul and Lachlan were so easy, but then you and Paul were so easy. But whenever you say that it's going to make you look so good, I mean, we don't have any doubt that it would be Samusha. I mean, Samusha is
SPEAKER_03: right here 85 kilo when it comes to 95 kilo different and when we are talking about 105 kilo it is about samusha's you know so yeah yeah but still anyway i mean listen krasi you are someone
SPEAKER_03: who has beaten even Levan Staginajvili. So, come on, you don't need to prove anything. Yeah, I just did it for fun. Okay, for fun, I understand. And it has some point of truth. Listen, Krasimir, do you know who this guy always wanted to pull against you? Many times when I asked you, you said Krasimir. He wanted to pull against you because of his style. Like, he feels like it's going to be like a Zurov match. He will go and then...
SPEAKER_03: Mm-hmm. Yeah. Is he dreaming, Krassi? Don't be too humble, Krassi. Just sometimes be challenging. Krassi knows the truth to what will happen. Did you hear what he said? Did you hear what he said? I think that he may give me trouble. What? I think that he may give me trouble, but I believe I will be with him. No, you know better. Oh. You know here and here. Krassi, I'm a prostitute.
SPEAKER_00: Do you think you can do it in 95kg? Yes, I can do it if I want to, but I don't feel my elbows well when I lose weight. And I don't want to do it. I wish you to lose 95kg and become a champion in Uptown.
SPEAKER_02: 95 kg, then 105 kg, and then you do what you like to do. I don't feel good when I put on weight. I see.
SPEAKER_02: Sen just asked me if I would go easy down to 95 and he said you should go down to 95 win there and then win 105 but I said that I don't feel my elbow good when I cut weight anymore so you told me that your left feels good at 95 but not the right yes are you listen are you open to
SPEAKER_03: left arm matches for 95 kilo or you would pull prefer to pull uh 105 105 even if there's yeah you don't want to cut weight anymore you look a little bit like teen you know like small yeah i prefer to stay 105. grassy i think you would be uh the champion on 95 left i think i i believe i have chance to be the champion with left 105 as well
SPEAKER_03: Wow. So you want to challenge him? Yeah. Yes, I would pull him. I can pull him. Can I ask you something, Krasiv? What's happening to you that you are, again, after some years, like you didn't feel as your prime, but now you look really good. I saw your match versus Paul. You beat Paul more convincingly than Rustem did.
SPEAKER_03: and and then i saw your last match with frank and you also hook in frank is not easy and you are probably lighter than him about 10 kilo yes yeah well uh
SPEAKER_02: in the life and in sport you always have ups and downs yes yes i had some downs but now it's time to go up again okay can you say that you are like coming near to your best shape or you are already or against hook pullers yeah i i believe right now maybe i'm the strongest i have ever been
SPEAKER_02: wow that's good that's good against top rowers i'm not i'm not sure against top rowers i'm not sure because back in the day i was able to stay closer and to push down stronger yeah so against top rowers i'm not sure if i'm better now maybe the same or maybe a little bit less than my best years grassy i have a quick question uh what is your record with john brzenk
SPEAKER_02: He won almost all matches probably. He won just one match against me in Russia because I didn't pull him because I had a war with Anatoliy Skodaev first and after that against Sergey Tokarev. So I had two very long matches and he had two fast wins and I didn't pull him. I let him beat me there.
SPEAKER_02: This is the only time he beat me. Other than that, I beat him at Nemirov after that in Turkey in Supermatch and now last year again. So he beat you in a tournament and you beat him in Supermatches? I beat him in the tournament first 2012. Can I ask you something crazy? Nothing to take away. You have a very big record against him. Do you believe that you have pulled against his prime?
SPEAKER_03: I don't know, but I believe I could still win. Wow, against his prime. Yes. Okay. Wow. Okay, we have Ivan Matushenko versus Sergei Kalnichenko. For me, Matushenko is the slight favorite, but I believe it will be a very good hook match.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, what if Serhii tries top row? I think it's a bad result. He will not be able to top row, Ivan. Yeah. Ivan's hooking ability is... I mean, like, listen, like, if you ask me...
SPEAKER_03: Who I wouldn't want to pull against is like Ivan Matushenko. I know a lot of guys would beat me bigger, but like that is the guy that like my biggest weapon is pronator. That, that, that, no. And also long arm, long reach and very quick. And I wouldn't like it. Yeah. And who's winning that match? I don't know, but I think Ivan is the slight favorite. But I wouldn't be surprised if Sergey wins.
SPEAKER_02: And Arsene?
SPEAKER_00: I think Ivan is going to be a favorite here. And Sergey has to fight. I think only I could fight Ivan Verkhov. I picked up the key to him, it was convenient for me to fight him. I knew what to do with him, where to meet him. If you don't have a fight with Ivan, you don't know what to do, and you're trying to fight as usual,
SPEAKER_00: then he will win 99% of the game. He is very fast, very strong. I think Ivan is the favorite, but it will be an interesting match. Fighting against Ivan is a very bad idea, I think.
SPEAKER_02: He said that it's very difficult to pull against Ivan with toproll. Maybe I was the only toproller who was able to toproll him and actually I knew what exactly I need to do to beat him. But usually it's way better to just hook him. If you try to toproll him, most likely he will turn you inside. Arsene, do you think you toproll him or you just drag, you know, just beat him?
SPEAKER_02: Please translate it, Krasimir. He's asking if you forgot the brush, what do you think, or just played through the middle.
SPEAKER_00: No, you know how it was? I didn't let him get into the hook completely, I controlled his fingers and his wrist. And then I won with the side movements. The main task was not to let him into the deep hook, so that he wouldn't twist it to the end. And I fought him a little differently than with the others, when I fought with the top. I didn't try to win him quickly, I tried to control his fingers and his wrist. And then I won him with the side movements.
SPEAKER_02: He said that, actually, I was not able to fully top roll him, but I was just putting him so much pressure in the wrist and the fingers, and then finish with my side pressure. Yeah, yeah, that's how I remember. And Chen?
SPEAKER_04: Hmm. Uh, I think Mata Shanko is the favorite. I think, uh, Sergei does better with top rollers. Like Sergei pulls well against top rollers. Like he beat Frank and he beat myself and he'd be RF and he does really good against the top map mask. I'm not sure how he does against such a strong hook puller. I don't know. Uh,
SPEAKER_03: I hope Sergei can win. I'm rooting for him, of course. Anytime someone beats you, you want them to beat everyone. But I think he's the favorite. Yeah, okay. Arsene, can I try one more time to bring you back to arm wrestling?
SPEAKER_02: Can you translate it, please? Ingin asks if it's a good idea that he tried to bring you back to farmwrestling again.
SPEAKER_03: Arsene, before the podcast here, YouTube podcast, Krasimir told me Arsene is not coming back to armwrestling because he knows that now the level is too high and he knows that he has no chance. This is what Krasimir said. I can easily answer this. Tell me now who is the champion in the 105 kg category.
SPEAKER_02: Sen just said, I can easily answer to you. Tell me now, who is the champion in 105 kilo class? Devin. 95. He said, so 95, the champion is Todd Hutchins. So exactly in 95, I could easily become the champion.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but right now, I think it is not possible to, according to the East versus West rules, you can't become champion by talking.
SPEAKER_00: I got it, good joke, I agree. You know, when we met in Turkey, Devon Larratt came up to me and said, let's make a 115 kg match, everyone will be interested to watch. But to fight 115 kg again, especially with Devon Larratt, it will probably take me two years, and I will have to start, I don't know,
SPEAKER_00: Of course, I have armwrestling in my heart and in my soul, but it takes a lot of time to get back to the level I was at. And when you have a lot of work, a family, children, it's hard to combine it.
SPEAKER_02: He said, when I was in Turkey, Devon Larratt said to me, come on, let's make a match in 115 kilo class. And Tarzan said that...
SPEAKER_02: If I want to be back at the shape that I was, I know that I need maybe two years or more and I know how much time it requires from me and when I have business and family and kids, so it's so much time that I need to separate for this and...
SPEAKER_02: I expect anything from this match. I don't have favourites and I don't know what to say. I think that it's going to be a war, but who is going to win, I don't know.
SPEAKER_00: I think that in order to win Prokopchuk, Makarov, no matter who he is, he still lacks something to be a champion. And Prokopchuk can get caught up in anything, he has a rod, he is a real fighter, so Prokopchuk will be a little bit of a favorite.
SPEAKER_02: He thinks that the slight favorite is Daniil because he says Makarov always lacks something to be the champion. But he's already champion, two times. And he said that Daniil has more weapons than him and he's warrior on the table and most likely he will win.
SPEAKER_04: And Chance? For me, this match is super close. Maybe it's the closest match on the card. I'm really excited to see. I don't really have a favorite. For me, it's 50-50. 50-50. Okay. So let's go another one. Gennady Kvikvinia versus Ibrahim Sago.
SPEAKER_02: If it was in the super heavyweight, I would easily say Gennady. But since it's 115, I really don't know. Maybe the slight favorite becomes Sagov when Gennady has to cut 15-20 kilos. And Arsen?
SPEAKER_00: It's the same. If it was in the super-heavy category, there would be no questions. But we don't know how Gennady's body will react to losing so much weight. I don't even know. It's hard to answer. It all depends on how he recovers.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, he just said the same. If it was the super heavyweight, I would easily say Gennady. But we don't know how Gennady's body will react to all this cut. So we don't know how Gennady will feel. Ben? At 115 kilos, for sure Ibrahim. For sure.
SPEAKER_04: For sure. Do you think there is no way Gennady is to stop? There's no way. No way? Oh, Zagov will win. Oh, because Zagov beat you, right? Yeah, exactly. Yes. If chance can do it, Gennady can do it. Exactly, exactly. Hey, listen. Last time Gennady pulled Devin, how many rounds did he get? I got you, I got you.
SPEAKER_03: In Georgia, how many rounds did Gennady? Oh, okay, okay, yeah, okay. So you are saying that you gave tougher match to Devon than Gennady did? Exactly. So if Ibrahim beat me, then of course he can beat Gennady. It's easy arm wrestling math. Yes, yes, yes. Sorry, sorry. And let's go. Todd Hutchings versus Rustam Babaev. I'm very curious about your opinions.
SPEAKER_02: just tell me i i really hope rustam wins this one why why because uh i believe i have better chance against rustam and are you planning to go 95 no no just uh would you like to pull rustam in 105
SPEAKER_02: Yes. Wow, that would be good. Another legend match. Yes, I would love to book him. For me, Rustam would be a way better match, I believe, stylistically than Todd Hutchins. Because Todd Hutchins is hitting me exactly where I don't feel that comfortable. With your current shape, do you think there is a possibility for any different outcome against Todd? Against Todd?
SPEAKER_02: Right now, if you offer me this match in two months, I would not accept it. For Todd, I need four months. Okay, but what do you need exactly? Just can you tell us? I will tell Todd not to listen to this podcast. Just for Todd, I need to...
SPEAKER_02: Pull more in hook. For example, the last two months, two months and a half when I understood against that I will pull frank, I was mostly training my wrist and side pressure. If I'm going to pull tots, I will mostly train side pressure and pronation, not that much wrist. Right now, the last two months and a half, all my focus was here.
SPEAKER_02: And for example, if this is my hook, this is my top row against hook and against top rowers. When I focus two, three months on top rowers, this goes here, but this goes down here. And if I want to concentrate against hook pullers again, definitely I need three, four months to reach my peak. You don't think you need your wrist to beat Todd Hutchings? Of course I need it, but...
SPEAKER_02: For example, the last time he beat me, I don't think I had lack of power in my wrist. I lost because my side pressure in the pronator was not good enough. Okay, so who is winning? Other than your hope? I don't know, actually. I really don't know. Arsene? I can talk about this match for a very long time. A match of my dreams.
SPEAKER_00: I want to translate. He said that for this match I could talk really long.
SPEAKER_02: It's like a dream match and I would like something like this to happen. Four of us, Arsene, Krasimir, Todd Hutchinson, Rustam Bobaev, we all four could win a tournament, we could pull a tournament, it would be a dream tournament, something like that. And Arsene, so who is winning?
SPEAKER_00: He said that this is one of the best matches, definitely.
SPEAKER_02: and Rustam is maybe a slight favourite because he is super fast and definitely if he wants to win the match he needs to do it fast because otherwise if Todd Hutchins stops him most likely he will beat him. Do you agree that if the match stops Todd is winning?
SPEAKER_03: Just saying the hook, it stays stopped. Yeah, but when we look back in the past, it stopped and still Rustam won. Yes, yes. So I don't know. I don't know. When I had the podcast with them, when I asked them if the power was close and Rustam said it was not close.
SPEAKER_03: Like, when he beat him 6-0, he said that, like, and then I asked Todd as well, and Todd also said that he didn't think it was close. Yeah, it was not close at their supermatch, but it was close at Nemirov. Yeah, yeah, it was just, like, really, with a light category. So, their supermatch is more recent, like, about 12 years recent, I think, compared to the other one. So, the time from 2005 to their supermatch,
SPEAKER_03: went into the favor of Rusta more than the favor of Todd. Of course, now it has been seven, eight years more. And yeah, I don't know.
SPEAKER_00: Yes, can I add to what Ergin said? You know, the years go by, but the most surprising thing is that after so many years, Rustam didn't get better, but Todd Hutchins definitely got better. So at least he didn't get worse than he was in 2005 when they fought. So don't throw in Todd Hutchins. You, Krasi, probably know best of all how dangerous he is, how strong he is and how he can fight.
SPEAKER_02: He said that with all these years, we see that Rustam is not getting better. Maybe he's the same, but definitely not better. And for Todd Hutchins, we can see that he's improving. For the last years, he's improving. Or if he's not improving, at least he's at his peak. So we should not count out Todd Hutchins. No, no, nobody's counting out him.
SPEAKER_03: um this is like what do you think like rustam's performance against uh sundries i expected a closer match but me too me too yeah yeah but but i saw what i saw like reminded me the old rustam that is just finishing all the way to the pimpet by dominating the
SPEAKER_03: the pronator of the opponent, the crushing power. Actually, Rustam is the only guy from all of us who tried to curl Irakli, Zirekashvili and Cook. Only Rustam was able to do it. Rustam just said that in the podcast that he said that he has never been this strong before. Yes, I heard that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And Chance?
SPEAKER_04: I really don't know. Historically, Rustam has always had Todd Hutchings' number, but Todd has been looking incredible lately. For me, it's...
SPEAKER_04: I think Rustam is actually the favorite. And I think if Todd is able to beat Rustam, then at 95 kilos, nobody can beat Todd. Rustam is the only person I think that can. Yes, definitely. I agree with you. How about Petrenko? No chance? No. No chance.
SPEAKER_03: in my opinion okay i don't think that's the style i i respect all the opinions yeah anything i don't know we will see but yeah i can see todd beating rushtam i see rushtam beating todd we will see yeah do you think that this match is a historical match i know they pulled before but at this uh
SPEAKER_03: like era like i think the arm wrestling is in like really different levels you know and and like don't you think that todd is just because of technical improvement whatever you call he's still more effective you know you just pulled him recently well yeah for me this is the main event of the evening so yeah okay so this is very important match for me too yeah
SPEAKER_03: And so let's go to the last match. And I'm also very curious about your opinion. And a lot of people think that Vitaly Laletin is just going to go through Michael. And a lot of people say that Michael puts brakes to everyone and he will put brakes
SPEAKER_03: Maybe I'm being unfair to you, always asking your opinion first. I cannot see in my head Vitaly beating Michael. So you are saying that Michael is favourite? Yes, yes. But people right now, some people will say, oh Vitaly is saying this just to hype and help East vs West to sell paperware.
SPEAKER_03: This is what they say. If you say that the match is a good match, they say no. This is we are trying to hype. I just cannot imagine Vitaly doing what just Hermes did. I don't think he's capable. But does he have to do that? Yes. If you want to be that ugly move, you need to do that. Do you think there is a possibility that like him to just go, go, go?
SPEAKER_00: go go and then no no so you are saying that michael is winning this one yeah i don't want this to happen but most likely this will happen oh arsene
SPEAKER_00: Just an impressive fight was Gasparini, when he won in Venice. For me, it was just the beauty of armwrestling. Secondly, now they've already learned how to fight Michael Todd. Once again, I say, that same Vitaly Oletevich,
SPEAKER_00: He is not only a top fighter, we all saw how he fought many times without a wrist, that is, he fought with his shoulder. Therefore, I do not agree with you, he still has a good chance. Maybe even, I would not say that 50 to 50, maybe still 60 to 40 in favor of Vitaly. He gained 140 kilograms, and even if Michael stops him, I think, according to the example of Gasparini, he can win him.
SPEAKER_02: He said that the first time on this card he will not agree with me and he said that according to him Vitaly is capable of doing what Hermes did. I mean like Vitaly to get height and get the hand position, yes.
SPEAKER_03: But to have the same amount of the pressure as HermÃ¨s did, I'm not sure about that one. But I think that Vitaly has different tools as well, my opinion, but we will see. Chance.
SPEAKER_04: I was actually talking to Michael on the phone a few months ago about these potential matches before it was locked in. And I told him my opinion was Ermias probably is the toughest opponent for him, period, out of anyone. Because he has the key, right? Key.
SPEAKER_04: uh yeah i think he has the key i mean he always has even back uh when ermys was like 100 kilos and they had a match ermys was giving michael a really difficult time then and now he's just bigger and stronger so i think uh i think this match
SPEAKER_04: will go in Michael's favor. I think Michael will be able to stop Vitaly. I don't think Vitaly has the tools to finish the move. And as time goes on, Michael will become more and more in control. Maybe we'll even be able to press at some point. But yeah, I think Michael wins this match. Maybe zero. Okay. And then the last one, Hermes Gasparini versus Levan Saginashvili.
SPEAKER_03: I don't know what to say. I'm expecting a good match. You are expecting a good match, not the domination? Definitely I'm expecting a good match. That's enough to hear. So you are just saying it can go either way? Yes. Arsene, what do you think about Ermes Gasparini? To me, when I watch
SPEAKER_03: His side pressure, his hook, is not like how John's prime was. But his outside ability, his shoulder, everything, his table IQ, to me, is like this level. Like, I mean, I really enjoy, I love watching Arsene Lille. Do you like Arsene Lille, Pauline? Please translate it.
SPEAKER_02: He is asking how you like Hermes Gasparini. Because...
SPEAKER_00: I'll remind him that even 8 years ago, maybe more, we were talking with Engin and I said that for me, Ermes Gasparini can become the new John Brzenko. So for me, he's my favorite armwrestler now. He was and he is. I really like how he fights, what experience he gained, what strength he gained. I respect both Ermes and Levan, but we need a new king.
SPEAKER_02: He said, Engin, maybe you remember that seven, eight years ago we were talking with you and I said to you that I like how Hermes is pulling and what everything he does on the table. This is my favorite arm wrestler and I definitely think that we need a new king in arm wrestling. Listen, we need is a different thing, but what is your opinion?
SPEAKER_00: I don't know what to answer. I'll be rooting for Hermes, not against him. I'd be happy to train with him if he prepares for Lebanon. Maybe I'll be able to give him some knowledge.
SPEAKER_04: He said that maybe still the favorite is Levan, but I would definitely root for Hermes. I think it's a really good match. I think it has the potential of being even closer or maybe going a different direction than the last time they pulled.
SPEAKER_04: Hermes is incredible. I think he has the best chance at beating Levan. That being said, I'll never pick against Levan. I think Levan should still be, in my mind, he's still going to win 4-0, 6-0, whatever. Casey Bryan says, Engin, you're a legend. I am an athlete, but a non-armwrestler. I have been watching you.
SPEAKER_03: All four years through, we are out there, great sport. Yes, it is a great sport and thank you for your opinion. This was the last Super Chat. Please don't send anymore.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I mean, a lot of people also have negative opinions about me, but what I heard from John Bersink at the end of the Arlington event is enough for me. I would say that for me personally, this card that is coming on May 10th is the best card ever. For me, all the matches are super, super interesting. And Krasimir, do you think that
SPEAKER_03: I have a chance to beat Mindaugas if I come back, or not? Of course you have a chance, but Mindaugas is the favorite in my eyes. Favorite? Yes. And Arsene? About you? Me versus Mindaugas, who is winning? But listen, Krasi, I'm like 92 kilos, 50 years old, the lowest I can go, 85. I don't think I can go to 70s anymore.
SPEAKER_03: If you're 85, then you're the favorite. If you're up to 80, it would be 50. 75, Mindaugas, I would say. 75, 70 kilos. At the age of 50, I don't think I'm losing 70. Who's winning, Arsene? I win or Mindaugas win? I'll say it like this. Translate it, please.
SPEAKER_00: To win a match, you need to be not only young, not only strong, but you also need to be strong. I don't know how to say it. I don't get it. You don't need to be young, but...
SPEAKER_00: So he said that to win a match you don't need just to be young.
SPEAKER_02: To win a match, you need to be a lion in the heart. So if you remember that you're a lion in the heart, then I would give the edge to you. That's what he says. Okay. Okay. And Chess? If you are in the shape, when you pull Mandelgus, if you're in the same shape as you were when you pulled Makarov, then I think you'll win pretty easy.
SPEAKER_03: How do you see him beating me? Top rolling me? Hooking me? If you are not able to finish the match, if he stops you down here. Which position? Does he have this position or he has this position? What kind of position he has?
SPEAKER_02: i can't see your hand yeah like this maybe maybe with a little bit lost hand but still he can hold here and then he's gonna beat me like this maybe from here and then to drop this is something that may happen well you are saying i will have the control but but he will he will stop me with arm power
SPEAKER_02: This is possible, but it's totally possible you to be able just to finish him. The history may repeat, but it also may change. It would be no shame if you lost to the GOAT.
SPEAKER_03: Anyways, Krasimir, thank you very, very much, my friend. Thank you. And just listen, once you're ready, just let me know, Krasimir. Just say that, Engin, these days I'm not available because of Europeans and the wars, but these days I'm available. And then, yeah, we can set a match. Just let me know whenever you want to pull it.
SPEAKER_03: Arsene, thank you very, very much, my friend. We miss you. Thank you, my friend. Thank you. Thank you, my friend. Yeah, we will never forget about you.
SPEAKER_03: And Chance, thank you very much. We need an American perspective as well. We can't be only from the east. And I consider Krasimir somewhere in between, while Arsen is more east, while you are west. And it was a good, good one. Yeah. Thanks to everyone. Thank you, Engin. Please just let me know whenever you want me to whoop Krasimir.
SPEAKER_03: It's no problem for me. I know you're trying to cook it. I'll go down 105. Chance, how about you stop asking match and then just start training and just kicking some asses around and say, did you see me?
SPEAKER_04: know you do you understand my point yeah of course yeah just just just start pulling man start pulling and let me see how they're out trained and i'll just fly to bulgaria and then i'll pin crassi 100 times in a row i'll send you the video oh and then then i'm gonna set that match no no no no then oh you don't want to match okay no no no i'll just be here cheers how many kills you are now well now maybe 130 but i'll pull you 105.
SPEAKER_02: I would definitely, I would say immediately yes if you're 110. I would immediately say yes. Crassi, actually, I've been thinking maybe I'll just show up at WAF. Oh, nice. And if I do, I'll be 110 and then I can beat you there. Okay? In WAF, I would pull most likely 100 kilos. Smart move. Right away. But for a super match, I would pull you 110. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: okay thank you guys thank you and
