SPEAKER_01: Let's start now. We are live. Hello, hello, everyone. And hello, Ivan, Ivan Portela, my friend. How are you? Good? Como estas? Bien, bien. And you? Muy bien. And hello, hello, Joseph. How are you, my friend? I'm good. How are you?
SPEAKER_01: Good, good, good, good. A nice day. I just wanted to do outside, balcony, because nice weather. And how are you, my friend? You will help us today to translate? As much as I can, sir. Yes. Glad to be here. Yeah, yeah. You have your own podcast as well. And yeah, let's start. So let's start with Joseph. Joseph, like till your match,
SPEAKER_01: uh against kevin palco i i didn't know about you i didn't know about you and you had a lot of people and i i knew about kevin and i because i know kevin and how successful he is so i didn't think someone that i have never heard of would just come and beat him i mean i didn't think that way but but it just happened and then
SPEAKER_01: The rising star, Cody Woods, and he was your next opponent at the East versus 17. And again, like he was favorites. I think even you mentioned that he was favorites on the paper. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think we did the podcast and this is what you taught and, but you also beat him. The only, only thing that like, I would just, uh,
SPEAKER_01: have how to say excuse about my opinion would be that like at the beginning very beginning I just know that you were the training partner of John Bersink. Can we say that you learn a lot from the guy while training?
SPEAKER_01: yeah yeah i would say so yeah he he suggests you because whenever i've hit the match and then whenever i found out that he was like like you guys were training together and he told me that like sometimes like if he's not feeling so good or tired or something even he has hard time you know uh opinion yeah and yeah so that that was that was yeah and now like the things are changing you defeated kevin palco and you were
SPEAKER_01: underdog against Cody Wood and you also defeated him and of course Cody Wood is also still young and also new for the sport and he will also have more opportunities hopefully in the future but right now you are in your third match and you are going to pull against Ivan Portela. Did you have a chance to
SPEAKER_00: see who he is? Like, did you, did you check who he is? I, unfortunately I did. Yeah. Yeah. I thought you were going to say unfortunately I didn't, but no, I, unfortunately I did. He's the Spanish goat. Um, I didn't know, I didn't know too much about him before this match. And I see, yeah. Even you told me Yvonne Portela and I, I went and I looked it up. Oh man. Yeah. He lives up to it.
SPEAKER_01: I think 10-time world, 10-time European champion. Yeah. The only thing is that I don't think he won in his prime, but it doesn't change anything about what he has done and about that he is for sure a legend. He is not a legend in his country. He is a global one. This will be the hardest match of my life. Yeah, yeah. Hands down.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know. I don't exactly know where Ivan is about his current form. The only thing is that you are going to pull against someone who is extremely experienced. Extremely. Compared to your first two opponents, this guy is another level about the experience. No disrespect to others, but he has been pulling for almost 30 years. He's been arm wrestling way longer than I've been alive.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, how old are you? I'm 23. 23, you are 23? Like, Ivan, how long have you been in the sport? 30 years? 31, 32, but nearly most close to 33 years in the sport, yes. Okay, okay. And yeah, so Ivan,
SPEAKER_03: As we mentioned, do you want to translate very shortly, quickly, what Joseph and I talk? Could you repeat that, Engin? I couldn't hear you very well, sorry. Like, can you quickly translate to what we just talked? To sum up a bit of what he said, this is his third fight against a great sport legend, which is you. A sport legend, a very well-known person internationally.
SPEAKER_03: In addition, Engin asked Joseph if he knew who Ivan was or who he was, Ivan Portela, to which he replied that indeed, unfortunately, he looked on the internet who you are and he was very impressed, mentioning 10 times world champion, 10 times European champion, and that also, apart from being very surprised, Engin said how
SPEAKER_03: Ok, where is your phone? Where are you now?
SPEAKER_04: Right now, obviously, I am not as good as I used to be, obviously, but I am still training and I am not unprepared at all. He knows me and he has seen that whenever I go,
SPEAKER_03: It's because I'm always there. You know me, Engin, and if I accept the match, it's clearly because you know that I'm always there. Yeah. Yeah. And, like, does he know his opponents? Did he check? Did he watch last events?
SPEAKER_04: Do you know who you are facing, Iván? Do you know your opponent? Have you seen the last events? Yes, because if I remember correctly, as I follow and I am a friend of Emil, I seemed to see him in a vendetta. And I saw it by chance. And then when I saw that I was against him, it was typical, I entered the profiles to see who it was.
SPEAKER_03: So, yeah, I saw him obviously pulling in a supermatch. He saved Endeta, actually. And obviously, after finding out that I was going to face him in a supermatch, that's when I really started to look into his social media profile and try to dive in, yeah. And what does he think about him?
SPEAKER_03: so rather than only about him but in general talking about the younger generations they are all coming strong but he mean joseph is obviously very strong he looks like now is his moment but experience is a huge grade and that counts
SPEAKER_01: And will it be enough, Ivan? Do you think it will be enough? We'll see that. We have to see that. And physically also you are in good shape, right? I mean, like maybe not prime, but still good shape.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, not in my prime, but yes, I'm feeling good. Oh, look at that forearm. Even when he was 55 kilos, he had a huge, huge, huge forearm. And yeah. Yeah. And Ivan, your opponent is also a hook puller.
SPEAKER_01: Do you think this is an advantage for you or disadvantage for you? You are a hook puller. Would you wish that your opponent was a top roller and you would just hook him and beat him, no problem? Or it would be bad for you if he top rolls you? Would you prefer your opponent to be a hook puller? I want a spoiler. I want a spoiler. I want a spoiler.
SPEAKER_03: So, did you understand what I said, Wengen? Yes, but translate it so that it stays the same. Right. Portela understood what you said and he's like, do you want the spoilers? Like, do you want me to tell you what really I think about it? Like, you want the spoilers? I mean, yeah. You want the spoilers? Are you going to top roll him or something? Did you become top roller after 25 years? He's going to top roll me. A surprise. Bro, a surprise.
SPEAKER_04: Surprise. Surprise. No, Ivan, no. Yeah, surprise. Look. No, keep moving. Really, keep moving.
SPEAKER_01: oh no no no no it's called desperation if the shoulder is like this it's okay open arm double this yeah yeah foul yeah yeah yeah that that that is statue of liberty yeah but yeah yeah anyways so yvonne both of us we asked yeah just foul both of them at same time no winner anyway so guys
SPEAKER_03: So, Ivan, you didn't really answer me. I said, is it good or bad that your opponent is the hook puller? For me, it's good. It's always going to be a good war.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, I thought there was a surprise. I thought there was a surprise. Anyways, yeah. Anyways, so how about you, Joseph? Do you like feel yourself this time favorites? I wouldn't say favorite again. I mean, just from the
SPEAKER_00: what he's accomplished and what he's done. I knew if he took this match, he felt like he was ready. So no doubt in my mind, this will be the hardest match of my life. I've kind of got a little reputation of comebacks at the moment, you know, coming back to zero against Cody. Some people say I'm the favorite.
SPEAKER_00: You know, I feel like it's mostly guys in North America and America that are like, yeah, Joseph, if it's a, if it goes into a hook will be pretty good. But I, there's a huge Spanish fan base that is saying Yvonne is going to crush me. So, uh, listen, um, you don't, you don't win with what you accomplished in the past. You need to pay the price. Like you need to be as good as when you were winning.
SPEAKER_01: those WAF wars. And what is your, Ivan, what is your heaviest category that you want WAF? I'm talking about the seniors, not masters.
SPEAKER_03: Do you want me to translate it for you? Translate it for the people in Spanish. Enkin has asked Joseph how he is physically and if he is considered the favorite. There were a series of comments, very quickly, guys, that obviously he is not considered the favorite, but that he is going to go all out and that he is perfectly aware of everything that Iván has achieved in the past.
SPEAKER_03: You did ask what was the heaviest bodyweight category he competed, right? No, no, he has won the, well, probably it is not more than 143, 65 kilos. I think either 60 or 65 kilos.
SPEAKER_03: Can you ask him? I used to compete in 70 kilograms, senior. No, no, no, but when he won the WAF, what is the heaviest category that he won WAF? Senior, I think it's 60.
SPEAKER_03: Senior, I think 70. When did he win 70 kilograms? No, no, I'm talking about the senior. No, senior didn't won in 70 kilograms. My friend, I'm not asking if he won 70 kilograms. What is the heaviest category that he won in senior category involved?
SPEAKER_03: What is the category that you have won in senior, in the WAF, in which you have more weight? The one that I have won in senior is 60, because then I retired seven years and returned to 2010, something like that. Probably in the 60 or 65.
SPEAKER_03: even has said that um the heaviest he uh competed and won it was 70 kilograms in WAF and then he retired for several years but when did he win the 70 kilo ball 70 kilos in WAF is
SPEAKER_01: No, I'm talking about senior. Senior. It shouldn't be this hard to find out. I mean, just as simple like me, I want 55, 60, 65, 70, 75. He's the heaviest. What's his senior category he wants? 65? Ivan, did you win it? I lost weight the moment I retired. So when I came back, it was another weight. Daniel. He cut himself a bit.
SPEAKER_04: I say that when I retired I was in 60 and when I came back I had already gained weight. I was in 70 when you retired. No, in 60 and when I came back, I came back in 70. So I already did a couple of world championships that I think the fourth or something like that. I don't remember well. Because I was starting again and already after the accident.
SPEAKER_03: so he was pulling in 70 kilograms as we say and then when he then when he got retired uh because of the accident and then he started to pull in master um
SPEAKER_03: okay sorry for the confusion I apologize we had a little bit of misunderstanding there so he said uh seven to make it clear 70 70 kilos in master he won
SPEAKER_01: I'm asking my friend, what is the heaviest category he won in Seniors? You are still telling me what category he won in Masters. I don't understand how hard it is. What is the heaviest category he won in Seniors? I'm asking. You're still telling me it's Masters. What is the heaviest category you won in Seniors?
SPEAKER_04: 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 60
SPEAKER_01: right he's not very sure right now that he doesn't remember very well he will have to look at it okay okay it's okay i just wanted to find out what it took like five minutes so let's continue so basically joseph like uh iwan's wins are mostly in like 55 and 60 kilo yeah which is 121 and 132.
SPEAKER_01: maybe 143 but we somehow couldn't find out what it is but but not how tall is ivan ah ivan is probably 170 or how tall are you he wants 169 69 yeah around and you
SPEAKER_01: I'm 5'7. I don't know what that is. 5'7 is about 170, almost, yeah. Okay. So you guys are almost the same height, yeah. Yeah, that's a first. What's your weight? Right now? Yeah. Oh, I'm...
SPEAKER_01: little heavier i'm like 161 pounds at the moment under like 161 so you are about 73 kilos so you need to lose three kilos yeah yeah and then what's your weight you want you said you said like what's your weight now
SPEAKER_04: 69, 68, 9. 69, 68. And then will he be 70 kilos when he comes to Chicago? ¿Vas a estar en 70 kilos cuando llegues a Chicago? Sí, con uno a este. Hay que darle a la creatina y va a comer.
SPEAKER_01: what's that he said yeah yes and he's going to take as well creatine okay so let's let's uh ask let me ask uh maybe a few more you want if you would just talk with the percentage what's your chance of winning according to you what's that
SPEAKER_04: so he said obviously as um
SPEAKER_01: I didn't try him out. I don't know really what Marantov is and I am the kind of person that until I don't get into the table... Don't know much about it. Okay. And Joseph, right now, Ivan is your third opponent in this league. And if you win this one,
SPEAKER_01: Do you want to face someone like one of the current best of today, internationally? Or you think you still need time to step up to that level?
SPEAKER_00: Whatever you feel is best. Because even coming into this, I had no idea I was even at the level of Kevin or Cody. So I really surprised myself. I never faced those guys. So if everything goes well with Devon and it's decisive maybe, yeah, I would give it a shot. I'm not afraid of losing. It makes it better. But I would give it a shot, yeah. I wouldn't turn it down.
SPEAKER_01: no no i know i know for sure but i i would like to be fair with you you are still fairly new uh for this uh level and but it doesn't mean that you can't be there there are some extraordinary people that without so much experience they can better themselves come and surprise everyone um and how about that that that you you are planning to become a policeman
SPEAKER_00: Is that correct? I am. Yes. Yeah. And in such case that you are hired, will you be away a little bit? For about, about five to six months, I'd have to be away. Yeah. Five to six months. It means that you won't be able to compete, but after that, you know, you will be away. After that arm wrestling will be the rest of my life. Yeah. That's good. That's good. It's great to hear that. Yeah. And I plan on coming back 10 times better than I am now. Okay.
SPEAKER_01: I hope you won't be that good. We won't be able to find open defense ten times better. But when do you think that's going to happen? After this match? Hopefully. I'd like to get hired as soon as possible to get situated in a career and then be able to really focus on arm wrestling. So you are saying that maybe beginning of 2026 you will be back? Like to be ready? Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And I'll be in touch with you too, and I'll keep you updated with everything. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But let's see, let's see. Maybe the guy that's sitting right there will really make you think about it again after Chicago. Maybe. You never know. Yeah. And let's talk about the other matches, Ivan. Ivan, let's start with the match that we announced today. Do you know Elin Youngham?
SPEAKER_03: Let's talk about the fights we announced today. Do you know... Can you repeat her name, Engin, please? Elin Janhem. Elin... Thank you. Yeah, I think that's how we pronounce, but I may be wrong. But she's going to pull against Fira Isaac for the world title.
SPEAKER_01: Do you know, from the fights that have been announced today, do you know Elian who is going to face Fia Ryzec for the title? I know Fia. I know Fia. Yeah, okay, so if you know Fia and you don't know the opponent, so probably you will not have a good, good prediction. And do you know this Atlas, Joseph?
SPEAKER_00: I know Fia, and I saw the other lady that you set up the match with today. I went on her Instagram. She looks incredible. So I hope it'll be a good match.
SPEAKER_01: right yeah the the thing is that in 70 kilo the the title match before this one was also between two ladies from sweden malin and fia they pull in tbilisi and now again two ladies from sweden and sweden has a lot of strong yeah yeah strong pullers uh
SPEAKER_01: especially in female categories. Okay, so let's go to some other matches. Ivan, Irakli, Zirakashvili versus Matt Mask with left arm. Irakli. Irakli. Irakli? Okay. And Joseph? Joseph, correct me if I'm wrong.
SPEAKER_01: about these kind of predictions you were like you were telling me whatever you are thinking this is how i remember you or was it was it cody or you know i'm brutally i'm brutally honest with him i'm gonna say matt mask okay his left is insane
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but he puts himself underdog. I think either he's playing that game or we had a podcast and he said that he is underdog. But he said that his left arm is not as good as his right arm. But the same thing we can say about Irakli as well. Irakli, since 2019, he didn't pull any left arm match. Yeah. Yeah, okay. So let's go to another one.
SPEAKER_03: Ivan, Georgi Desgarano versus Michael Todd. Michael is a warrior. I think it's going to be Georgi.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, is it that Zeranoff is going to win? Zeranoff, do you think Zeranoff is going to win? Okay, in which way? Michael is my friend, I appreciate him a lot, but he's very strong. And I'm saying this even though Michael is my friend, but really Zeranoff is very strong. But which way do you see Zeranoff winning?
SPEAKER_03: Is he going to top roll him? Is he going to side pressure hook? Deadlift pressure? How do you see? How do you think the fight is going to be? Is he going to take him by side pressure? Is he going to go up? How do you think the fight is going to be? With Michael? It's going to be a disaster fight. Because Michael Todd is an expert in that. So...
SPEAKER_03: or wins over him, he's not going to have a problem. He sees... Or in a direct press that with the heel of the right hand. One of the two. Right. Van said that this is going to be like a war, especially in endurance, or either Serrano press him or he goes on the top.
SPEAKER_01: Either press or top roll? Either, or top roll, or press, or top roll. One of them. Ivan, did you see the matches between Michael and Hermes and Michael and Lalecin? Because both Hermes and Lalecin are very good top rollers,
SPEAKER_04: They couldn't manage to beat Michael with the top roll. Have you seen, Ivan, Michael's fights with Hermes and the Latin? Because if you see the fights, Michael couldn't go up on top roll. That's why I say that if they attack Michael from above, they can attack him. That's why the same is true. If they attack him from above, then he can go. Because Michael doesn't go up.
SPEAKER_04: in general. And it is that you have put on an ethyl arm, which is the arm of the longest there is. Getting up to these people is very complicated. He said that it is very difficult to get on top of Michael's. You mean above Michael's arm, right? Or the hand.
SPEAKER_04: I understand that they couldn't get the height and that's why he lowered it. It's because how are you going to get the height? Okay, yes, but let's talk about Michael.
SPEAKER_03: Yes, yes, yes. He said that it's very difficult to get on top of Michael there and it's going to be very difficult. So that's why. I just translated what you said and that's why, because it's very difficult to get on top of Michael, that's why you think it's going to be one of the two ways, or on top or press, right? Is that what you mean? No, regarding what he said about the fights with Ernest and...
SPEAKER_04: and the team is that Michael did not get to them from above, they are two very long arms, he does not have an incredible back and the arm of the team is one of the longest as the height
SPEAKER_03: So he mentioned that obviously Michael with Hermes and Vitaly, he struggled to go on top because they are very long arms. That was his mentioning. That was exactly what he said. Oh, so he said Hermes was struggling because Hermes is long arm? No, in the case of Hermes, it's more because of the pressure he has towards the back.
SPEAKER_00: In the case of Hermes. So in the case of Hermes is because of the back pressure, because the flexor fails and the height drops. Okay. And how do you see this? If Zhirinov wins, it's going to be in a dead or it's pressed. He's not top rolling Michael. I think Michael's got a fire lit under his butt right now. And this is in the US. I think Michael's going to win.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, okay. And let's go to Wagner Bortolatto versus Manuel Battaglia. Ivan, do you know Battaglia? From Italy, the world champion. I don't know how Bortolatto is, but he's always been a tough guy. Battaglia is currently in his prime.
SPEAKER_03: so um he said that bortolato is a very tough opponent uh he doesn't know how he is right now and batalia is looking very good but if he he does he press him the match is his
SPEAKER_01: What if Manuel takes his risk? Can Wagner still press like this or not, according to him? Yeah, he said that yes, he thinks so, yes. So he thinks that even Manuel takes his risk, he will still press him like this? Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Okay. And how do you see this match? Do you know Manuel? I don't. I know I don't. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I can't really comment on this one. Okay. I know Wagner, though. I know Wagner's an animal. Yeah. Yeah, he's strong. And he starts hitting the table. Wagner's winning. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He almost broke one of my tables, and I was kind of upset with him. And...
SPEAKER_01: not because of the table but because of the like uh because the show had to continue yeah and yeah but we get along very well we keep in touch all the time but anyway so um ivan alex kurdecha devon art left arm
SPEAKER_04: Devon. Cordelia, Devon, Devon. Devon. Okay, but just give us some detail. How do you see the match? Like, how is it? Devon is just going to hold him and beat him like this, or? Devon is a bit unpredictable. So, he would win, and when he sees that he wins, he will play with him at his strongest point of Cordelia.
SPEAKER_03: So Devon is very unpredictable and he thinks that once Devon gets
SPEAKER_03: that he is going to win, he will allow Kurdecha to go into his strongest and play with him because that's what Devon likes to do with his opponents, like demoralizing, humiliating. That's how he sees it. And he doesn't see any chance that Alex is winning? No?
SPEAKER_01: Okay. And Joseph? I think Alex is going to blast through him the first two rounds. And I think after that, Devin's going to get that stop. I think he's going to take it. Have you seen Alex's match against Artem Morozov? Mm-hmm. In that match, unlike his right arm, with left arm, he can hook. He can side press. He can top roll. He can deadlifts press. I think in one of the rounds, I think he even beat Morozov with deadlifts.
SPEAKER_01: Do you think in the case that Devon stops him halfway and Alex puts his shoulder behind, do you think there is also a risk for Devon to lose the round? Yeah, absolutely. I do. And I know Alex is ranked, I think, fourth in the world left hand. He's super high up there. Devon's working his way back up.
SPEAKER_00: It's hard to bet against Devin, you know, once he gets that stop and he is so smart and he's able to keep people outside of those lanes. I still think if Alex doesn't blast through him, it's going to be Devin. I kind of think that it is going to be a war. I think it's going to be a war too. Maybe early round Alex may win quick, but I don't know how the rest will go, but
SPEAKER_01: Even if Devon wins, I think there will be some serious war there. This is what I think. Oh, yeah. And Iman, Alex Kurdeca versus Artem Morozov, right arm. Kurdeca. Kurdeca.
SPEAKER_04: Alex Furtensha. Alex Furtensha. And how does he see this match? ¿Y cómo ves este combate? ¿Se refiere a cómo crees que va a ser? ¿Cómo lo ves? Sí, sí. Es que es fuerza contra un flexor grande, alto y una buena mano.
SPEAKER_04: Or it can be very fast because he catches Kurdecha in some way. Kurdecha because he thinks like he's dealing with a tall arm flexor. Moratov is the last one I've done with Devon, right?
SPEAKER_03: Or am I wrong? No, Morozov, no. Who is he then? Is it the Ukrainian or the one with the blue shirt? The one who, let's say, shot the last fight against the Leti. Do you remember? The one who was injured. That shooter, I mean. Kurdecha against Morozov, with the right hand. With the right hand? I think it's Morozov.
SPEAKER_03: Okay. Yeah, sorry. But he won't even was mixing names at the moment. So yeah, he changed and he said that Vasco Morozov. Yeah. Morozov. Yeah, not Morozov. It's Artur Morozov. Yeah, Morozov is different. Morozov is different. He's pulling against Morozov. And who is winning? Alex Kurdecha against Artur Morozov, which is this red hair that he threw against Daletin. Who wins, actually?
SPEAKER_01: And how do you see this match, Joseph? I think Artem Morozov is going to win. In which way? He's going to hook him. Oh, he's going to hook him. Yeah, that is a very surprising thing. It's not that easy to hook Alex with right hand. I have seen him losing.
SPEAKER_01: against some of the guys with dead wrists. I think Krasimir beat him, Ongar Bey beat him, and Jerry beat him with dead wrists. And Dave Chaffee, when outside move, he beat him. But hooking him with right arm, I think his left arm is stronger, but the right arm, I think he's better top roller. But you are thinking that Artem is going to hook him.
SPEAKER_00: I think so. I mean, their leverages are about the same. They're about the same size arm, but around the same height. Like in the case of Bobaev, that's just getting him in a proper hook would be damn near impossible with his lever size. But Morozov's got the height advantage on him, too. So I think, yeah, I think he's going to wind up sucking him into a hook. And Morozov has insane endurance as well. I mean...
SPEAKER_01: I don't think it's going to be one-sided at all. I don't think really any of these matches are going to be one-sided. I think you got a card full of wars coming up. Yeah, yeah, yeah, a lot. One guy says that... One guy says that... One second. He says... Ivan retired after Joseph hooks him to the pad. Oh, my goodness.
SPEAKER_03: Ivan, is it going to be a retirement match or is it a new beginning?
SPEAKER_03: Is this, Iván, your retirement fight, or is it a new beginning? Well, I hadn't even thought about it, really. Wow, I didn't even thought about it. Which one? Retirement or the new beginning?
SPEAKER_01: Which of the two? About the fight to retire or a new beginning? Neither. Neither of them. Neither of them. Okay, okay. Okay, so now you didn't think about it, but I reminded you. What's your answer? What do you think he will be? I'm trying to provoke him, Joseph, so just he can say something. I know you are. You're stirring the pot. Okay, so let's go.
SPEAKER_01: Let's go. Pauline versus Arsene Kacetarian. Ivan, do you know Arsene Kacetarian? No, right? Okay. So I'm not going to ask you because when you know one opponent but not the other one, it is impossible to predict. Joseph, you saw him against Andrei Sharkovich. You were in the same event in Arlington. Were you impressed with the guy?
SPEAKER_00: Oh, yeah, he's incredible. I mean, especially he's like 21 or 22 years old, something like that. He's super young. But I think Paul Lin's a different level at the moment. So do you think he's going to sweep? Maybe. I mean, I know I said that, like, I think every match is going to be a war. This might be the only one that Paul Lin could sweep.
SPEAKER_00: he could but i i mean arson is very very impressive so i wouldn't be surprised either way but i think paul's gonna end up winning that inevitably paul's in really good shape yeah okay dino says in one and a half year joseph will be champion thank you dino and let's are vika
SPEAKER_01: I don't know how to read that, but Engin, if Devon starts with good sides versus Kurdesha too, will he finally suspect foul play? And what if he gets it again versus Laletin Wright, my friend? I will be as...
SPEAKER_01: informative as possible uh my friend we front of every athlete front of all the athletes we flip coin to the air and before we we flip it we ask athletes which side they choose and the both athletes agree on something just say head or tail and then we throw the money in the air
SPEAKER_01: and the money falls down and it is filmed in front of all the athletes, not only these two athletes. And if athlete wins, wins. I can't, I don't know. I don't know. I can't do anything. Whenever he was pulling against Petrenko and they will choose one side. And then whenever I throw the money and they will kick the money in the air and
SPEAKER_01: And then the side that he chose came. I canceled it because he kicked the money in the air, the coin. So I throw it again. And again, he won. So what can you do about that? You know, like his opponent is right in front of him. And like, do you understand?
SPEAKER_01: So to make you happy, we can ask his opponent first which side he wants of the coin. And then the other side will automatically be Devon's and we throw it to the air. And then whatever comes, comes. You know, what can you do? If Devon wins, Devon wins. If Kurdesha wins, Kurdesha wins. There is nothing to suspect, you know.
SPEAKER_01: Engin was commenting on the subject of throwing the coin into the air, Ivan, about the fight between Edebon and Kurdecha. Yeah, and also he lost against Gennady about the coin, but Gennady told him, oh, you start however you want. And in such case, you need to go and talk with Gennady, you know, because he's the one that is just one and he can be at whatever side he wants.
SPEAKER_00: Anyway, so, and then we have Alan Ford versus Ryan Ballinger. Are you familiar with this athlete, Joseph? Me? Yeah. I've watched a lot of Alan Ford growing up whenever I first got into the sport. I know he's not one to be played with, and I've heard a lot about Ryan. I haven't seen Ryan pull personally, like live or anything, but I've heard he's super, super strong.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, he's worse. Yeah. If he hooks him, I think he has better chance. But there is a possibility Alan to go for a flash pin. We will find out. Yeah. And how do you feel? Alan's fast. Yeah, very fast. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: His nickname is, I think, Hitman. Yeah, Hitman. Alan Hitman Ford. Yeah, yeah. And he's a very dangerous guy. Very dangerous guy. I mean, I have seen him giving very hard time to very top bowlers. You know, all his career wrong. Yeah. And so let's go to the main event. Ivan Portela. The legenda. Legenda.
SPEAKER_01: How do you say it in Spanish? Legend. Leyenda. Leyenda, okay. So, Iván, who is winning there? Are we going to talk about the night fight? Levan Zaginajvili or Hermes Gasparini? Let's see. Levan. But it is true that the only one who has made the topic complicated
SPEAKER_03: So Levan, but nowadays the only person who has put in serious trouble Levan was Hermes. So still Levan, but Hermes is getting there.
SPEAKER_04: So, do you think LeBron is going to win for sure? Do you think he's going to win for sure? I don't know about the first one. The first one, I don't think it's going to be that easy. The others, if we look at the last one, it wasn't easy at all.
SPEAKER_03: i mean i mean it's tricky because i mean if we guide ourselves by the last match that they both had and saying that they will have been proven it's like the first the first one could be
SPEAKER_01: like he said like could be like very difficult match round sorry uh and the rest we'll see so we're very tricky okay big grove goes says joseph how much training have you done with jumper zinc i've done quite a bit i've seen him in a lot of practices we pulled like did you guys do like 20 times till today
SPEAKER_00: yeah probably 15 to 20 times because he he also has like a little specific group that he's super far from me with um so he has like every other week i'd see him at eric wolf's place and he's also asking engen do you have any updates on how john's recovery is doing do you have any information about that joseph i don't no i i wish i did i i don't have information either
SPEAKER_01: And El Zurdo Aymen says, Ivan is the Spanish-speaking god with the most titles in the world. And under all forecasts, he will fight to present his country, Spain, go Spain. Probably he says not present, but represent probably means. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: So, can you read the super chat for him, please? Sure. Engin has read a super chat from iMEN, Zurdo iMEN, saying that Iván is the greatest of all time and that he will continue to fight representing Spain, basically. Yeah. Yeah, okay, okay. And...
SPEAKER_01: Is there anything you guys want to add to tell each other? I think this will be one of those super respectful competitions. Joseph is always respectful and Ivan is a legend.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, and I see the full respect. So that's good. That's good. We will see a great arm wrestling match. That is what most matters since we love arm wrestling. What's that? I hope there's no secret top rolling surprises. I hope he sets up just like me. I hope we go right into the hook and have a phenomenal fight.
SPEAKER_01: So hook pullers are cheaters, right, Joseph? Top rollers are cheaters. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Top rollers are cheaters. I'm sorry. So top rollers, we should ban them, right? We should. We should. I think so. Yeah. Straight inside. Yep. Ivan, your opponent says that he doesn't want any kind of surprise and he wants the pure hook work.
SPEAKER_01: so don't bring any surprise and we just decided that any top role will be called well so thank you basically
SPEAKER_03: saying that if you have something to say to each other that he intuits that it will obviously be apart from being a great fight that it will be that what you are going to say to each other right now that it will be very respectful that he intuits that of the two of you Joseph has said that he does not want any unsuitable surprise with the topic of the top roll and he has said that the top rollers are cheaters basically that I would think a fault that I would think a fault
SPEAKER_03: So yeah, if we go outside, it's going to be a foul. What's that? So in regards of no surprises, cheating surprises, we go in top role that is cheating. If we go outside, it's going to be foul. Okay, yeah. So we agree. Okay, that's good. And Joseph, your opinion about Levan versus Hermes?
SPEAKER_00: First, I want to ask, who do you want to win? I want Hermes to win. Is it because of some changes? Oh, yeah. It would stir the pot huge. I think it would stir the pot. I think Levan's going to win. But either Levan's going to sweep him or Hermes is going to win. But Levan's a heavy favorite, of course. Uh-huh, uh-huh.
SPEAKER_01: But how heavy do you see him as a favorite? Do you expect, like, Hermes to win as well? Like, not more than Levan's chance, but do you, like, hope Hermes wins, that there is something that you are expecting or wishing? Yeah, I would like to see Hermes win. I mean, Hermes is such a character, and they're both in the best shapes of their life at the moment, I feel. I think Levan...
SPEAKER_00: LeBron's going to do what LeBron does to him. But if Hermes wins, I will be a happy boy. Yeah. I'll be shocked. Because then that would open up the rankings to everything. Because I personally think Devin beats Hermes. I think Hermes takes it.
SPEAKER_01: If Hermes wins, I think Devin would beat Hermes. I think LeVon would beat Devin. I think it'd be this whole roller coaster. We never know. I know we never know. You never know, but I can tell you something. I won't go into details. Do you follow the drama? Did you see the video that Hermes shared? Yeah. Yeah. This is now...
SPEAKER_01: probably the most personal super match that I have ever said as of now. I'm not going to share everything that is going on, you know, behind the scenes but
SPEAKER_01: So fireworks are going to be going. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I mean, I wish I could share with the community, but that is right now very, very, very serious issue. Some people think that it is just a hype or drama, but those people, you will know, never call me and say, you know, whatever it happens, happens. You know, they will just, they don't want the World War III will start. They will say, no, no, no. That is just for like, you know, for...
SPEAKER_01: news or something, you know. So you can convince those people they are a bit problematic. But this is very serious. And I think that from now on, we won't see any trash talk, at least from Levan's side. This is what I see. And Levan is coming there with different mindsets. It was already a bit personal, a bit personal because of
SPEAKER_01: all the mockery you know people made you know about the oxygen and this and that and so that one was coming there just to prove that it will not happen again it was just one time thing but i think after after hermes's video and now the things are very serious and we will see we will see you will be there
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I hope the things cool down. I'm trying to cool it down, but we will see. Anyways, Ivan, my friend, Legenda, thank you very much for coming. And you're going to show this Joseph Maranto what his experience is. And he's going to remind you what it is to be young.
SPEAKER_01: And then we will see. We will see if strength and youth will win or the experience will find a way to win. And my friend, thank you very much for translation. And at the beginning, we couldn't understand a little bit about the category thing, but I appreciate, I appreciate. Probably it was my fault that I couldn't explain good. I appreciate. Yeah, yeah, it's okay. Yeah, no problem, my friend. And yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Thank you very much. And Joseph, thank you very much. And Ivan, do you guys have any last message to each other or to the fans or anything? Yeah, Ivan, Trent, good. I can't wait to meet you. I'm excited for an amazing match and everyone supporting us. Thank you. Love you guys. Hope to see you there.
SPEAKER_03: Obviously, Engin is closing the show, saying, well, Ivan, legend, thank you very much for being here. Let's see if the youth and strength of Joseph Meranto will be able to do something against the experience. He also made a comment that we didn't understand at the beginning with the issue of weightlifting and all this about the championships, but that's okay. And Joseph said,
SPEAKER_03: I hope you're doing well, that you're training well, that he wants to see you, that we meet and that we have a real war. I say the same. Nice to meet you and we have a good dance.
SPEAKER_01: same it's been a pleasure and see you soon okay one last super chat the guy just sent i think it's dirt miyagur excited for this match joseph's joseph is a great guy met him at the east versus west 17 vip dinner and got me into a club and started training see you in chicago bro we are rooting for you
