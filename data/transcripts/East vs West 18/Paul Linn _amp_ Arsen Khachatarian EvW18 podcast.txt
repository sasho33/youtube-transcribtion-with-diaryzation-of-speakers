SPEAKER_03: think he will be with you or he will be coming no he is in other i sent the leaks to him he was he's in our city uh paul do you know david stephania yeah i think we met before once once or twice yeah then we
SPEAKER_03: He was one of the top 65 kilo puller in the European and World Championships. And then he moved to US. And now, what are you now, David? 70 kilos, 75 kilos? Do you hear me, David? Yeah, I hear you. What's your weight now? 70, 75?
SPEAKER_03: 75. 75. Okay. But if you need it, you can, you can go down to 70 kilo, right?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it's not a big deal for me. Just, uh, I had a surgery on my right elbow, uh, like a year ago. It was on the August. That's why I didn't compete in any competition. It almost one year. That's why I gained a little weight, but 70 kilograms is sideways, you know, like
SPEAKER_02: Hey, Paul, how are you? Good. How are you, my friend? Good to see you, brother. Yes, yes. We were waiting for this match. Yeah. How is your elbow healing up? What was the injury? Getting better. Getting better.
SPEAKER_02: it was right here and right here both both ways i got the surgery yes yeah but now it's getting good i am doing the exercise very well anyway i can do but in the match it's a little hard so is it possible that you you raise the phone and we can see your face yeah yeah yeah yeah and did you did you check arson if he's coming because we are four minutes past yeah
SPEAKER_00: Okay. So Paul, how, what's your weight now? About 218, 217 in the morning, right, right, right around where I normally am coming into these matches. So started my, my water load right here. So two more of these to drink a day. So we'll be good though. Okay. Okay. That's good. And like you just had a match, um, five weeks ago.
SPEAKER_03: And like, how was it, you know, you pulled and how many days did you rest and then train? No rest, no rest. We went right back into it. So you come back as soon as you arrive, next day you train? Yes. Yep. Yep. Yep. Right away. Yep. And then right back to table time on Friday and Saturday. So,
SPEAKER_03: Short camp, short camp, so no time to waste, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. But you were already in shape, so it didn't really, like, you can't really say that you didn't have time to prepare, unless you would be exhausted from the match before. Right.
SPEAKER_00: No, I try and maintain a good level the whole way throughout the year. But each opponent, I usually tweak things to train differently. You know, it's good to have eight to 10 weeks to pick your approach. So I didn't really have that, but I feel good coming out of the Samusha match. I think, you know, similarities in what I was doing for Samusha can carry over into the prep for this one.
SPEAKER_03: I understand. So, David, did you reach to Arsene? David? Yeah. Engin, I hear you so slow. I mean, I think, I and Paul, we hear each other very well, so there must be something at your end, but did you talk with Arsene? Is he coming?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I think he's calling me. Let's give a call, leave the chat and give him a call, help him to join and come back. Okay. Give me a second. And the form is about the same, Paul, still very good? Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah. Probably better, probably better. Better, yeah?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I mean, I'm healthy. I didn't really sustain any damage in that match, like nothing to really slow me down in the training, nothing I had to avoid. So I've been keeping the exact same cadence, you know, still doing the conjugate method through Todd, just changed a few exercises, you know, and I'm still pulling twice a week on the table with the two groups of guys I work with. So yeah, I feel good.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. Do you think that if you didn't change your training methods, do you think that you would lose? I don't know. I don't know. It's hard to say. I definitely feel stronger in different spots, you know, with the tweak. I mean, I think overall general strength movements like
SPEAKER_00: They're not like I could, they didn't, they're still on par with where they should be. But now, spending more time on conjugate and side pressure, I think I've kind of shifted those general strength efforts into more arm wrestling specific stuff. So, I feel good in certain spots that I didn't, you know?
SPEAKER_00: So, I think it just depends on the application on the table. It's hard to say, but, you know, the Sumushi match was the beta test run for this style of training. So, having success there, I'm going to continue on. So, this probably proved that you improved more than he did since the last time you guys met each other.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe, I think there were spots that he felt better than the first time. I felt like his fingers and his overall containment felt better. I think I felt a little bit better in the side pressure area. So I think I learned a lot from the first match too, and I had a lot to go off of. So avoided some mistakes I made in the first match, I think that helped.
SPEAKER_03: But he definitely, Samusha is unbelievable, man. And his hand, his containment felt great. Yeah. Yeah. But, but like probably, probably 85 kilos is his category. This is, this is how it looking. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: I think so. I mean, I think there's definitely great matches for him at 95. I think there's definitely people at 95 that he can beat. But I think it's kind of the same scenario where I'm in. Like, I have no problem taking matches in 105, but that's not necessarily home. Home is 95, you know. Hello, Arsene. Hello, Arsene. Hello, hello, hello. Hello, Engin. Hello, Paul.
SPEAKER_04: Hello, my friend David. So, how is everything, Arsene? Good. Good? Yeah. Yeah? Can you speak English or? I speak but little bit English. I understand but my English not very well. Sounds good to me. Sounds good. Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Arsene, what is your best, like, most successful finishing in a competition? I think you took second to Sasho, and then at the AMC, which place did you take? Ars says the most successful is the competition where you won, where it was, when it was and with whom it was. I think it was in Europe, in Sasho, where I came second.
SPEAKER_02: He's thinking it was the European Championship. It's 2022. The final match was with Sasho Andrei. Yeah, and which place did he take at the AMC?
SPEAKER_04: The finalist was Sergei Bogoslavov, but I'm absolutely third. Dmitry Silaev and Lale Tzinin.
SPEAKER_02: It was MC, he got second place, he lost Sergei Bogoslav, but in the absolute weight he got third place. He lost Laletin and Umtartarik. And Tsylaev, yeah. There is one guy asking,
SPEAKER_03: He says, Engin, when can we expect to host Reno Masic? He recovered from injury with 80% strength on European 110 kg. No, my friend, his injury is with right arm. He won the Europeans with left arm. Right arm he didn't compete. Okay, so, Paul.
SPEAKER_03: Do you think this is a tougher match than the Samusha match because you are pulling against someone who really belongs to that category? Yeah, I think this is a tougher match for a couple of reasons. I think, number one,
SPEAKER_00: Yes, it's in the weight category. But, you know, Arsene is largely an unknown. There's videos out there, there's some things to study. And his accomplishments are incredible. He's young, he's fast, he's versatile. We're not talking about a one trick pony and pulling Samusha, we know where he's going, you know. And so this, to me, this match presents like,
SPEAKER_00: a really fun opportunity because I think it might be a scenario where both guys try different things. So I'm looking forward to just seeing kind of what unfolds. But he's definitely got me on my toes as far as how I'm trying to prepare for him. So yeah, no, I'm very much looking forward to this match.
SPEAKER_00: The whole team out there with Reg and David Egan, you guys are awesome. It was sooner or later our paths have to cross. Today I saw some North American rankings. And the rankings, I think you were ranked number one and he was ranked number two. I think so. One of them. I think that's in the hook probably. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That one I think, yeah. Yeah. And Arsene,
SPEAKER_04: Are you in a better shape than when you pulled against Andrei Sharkevich? I think yes.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, he thinks he's feeling better than before, but against Andrei Sharkovich he was at 100kg, but now he's getting 5kg lesser, so it's gonna be a little... he doesn't know how he will feel, but right now he's around 98kg and feels super better.
SPEAKER_03: Mm-hmm. Arsene, can you turn your phone sideways? This one is good? I think you need to unlock the rotator. And what did you say your weight is now?
SPEAKER_03: I'm right around the same weight. Same weight, right? Yeah. Yeah. So 220 is 100. So 216 is about 98. So you said you are 218 or? Yeah. 17, 18 in the morning. Every day will be less. Every day will be less. Arsene, how do you see your chances against Paul? Paul is,
SPEAKER_03: very high-level puller but taking second at AMC is also a huge success and so we don't exactly know how to compare you because you pull Andrei Sharkovich but it was also first time we see Andrei Sharkovich at the East-West stage and how do you see your chance against Paul?
SPEAKER_02: Arsene says that Paul is a very high-level figure in our MC. You are also in the second place in the MC, which is a little difficult for them to compare.
SPEAKER_02: because this is the first time you have participated in this association, you have not won yet, but it is difficult for me to understand. Will you go up or not? How do you assess your chances? I know that Paul was very strong, very brave, very smart.
SPEAKER_02: He knows that Paul is a very good competitor. It's going to be super tough for him, but he thinks he's getting very well and he will find a way to get clean.
SPEAKER_02: And what does Paul have that concerns Arsene the most? What's that?
SPEAKER_03: He doesn't want to speak what kind of style he's going to use? No, that's not what I asked. I am asking, like, what does Paul have the most dangerous? I'm just saying that, like, what is...
SPEAKER_02: Like, what would worry him about Pol? Like, explosive...
SPEAKER_04: foreign
SPEAKER_02: He doesn't want to speak about it because he knows that Paul is a very tough competitor and he is getting ready and he doesn't avoid to any position because he is using top rolls, using inside both ways is good for him so he is going to
SPEAKER_02: use both ways which one is getting better but he's not scaring because Paul I say he's uh checking he has already checked it with the Paul that uh he knows how is he's working how which way is better for him so he knows everything about the Paul yeah but but David he understood that I'm not asking him which style he's gonna use he understood that right
SPEAKER_03: Yeah. Okay. Okay. As long as he understands that, it's okay. I don't want him to think that I'm trying to find out which style he's going to use. Like, if somebody would ask me if I'm pulling Pauline, I would just say his wrist and his explosive into the sideway, you know.
SPEAKER_03: It's the Paul way, but whatever he's going to use against the technique of the Paul... No, that's not what I asked. I wouldn't ask it. I wouldn't ask it. Yeah, but he already knows how Paul is going to use. But it's okay for him. No, I was expecting him to answer that Paul is very explosive. First, I need to catch him and then make it endurance game and win or something, but it's okay, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: And Paul, what do you think about this young guy? I think he's a stud, man. I think he's the future of arm wrestling. I think he's got probably one of the best teams in the country to learn from and work with. Like, the sky's the limit for the guy, you know? I'm just an old guy trying to hang on by a thread. Oh, Arsene, don't believe this guy. Don't believe this guy.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah. So, Paul, let me stir the pot a little bit. You said he's the future, but you are saying he's not today. I see what you did there, Engin. I see what you did. That's not what I meant, but, you know, if that's what we want to go with, we can go with that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. So, basically, Arsene, Paul is saying that
SPEAKER_02: You are a future, but next Saturday, no chance for you. This is what he is saying. Paul says you will be one of the best people in the future, but not today.
SPEAKER_04: David, tell him that Paul didn't say that. I'm making up, you know. I am telling you.
SPEAKER_01: He's telling that Paul is already a little older and I don't want to say that he's wrong, baby. David, I didn't understand what?
SPEAKER_02: He's saying that Paul is already older than me and I have respect. I will be quiet. Maybe he's not wrong. He doesn't want to say that Paul is wrong. It's OK. Ah, OK. Out of respect, he says that Paul is right. I'm old, I'm old. Paul is right. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Actually, Arsene has a lot of respect to the pole because we have seen the pole a lot of a lot and he's supporting all the United States team who is competing in any competition. We are checking already that always whoever is getting win in any competition, in any match, it's very big pole.
SPEAKER_02: supporting them a lot of everyone doesn't know what state we are living how we are closing just so this is very important for Arsene he has a lot of respect and really it's gonna be tough for Arsene to compete with the Paul because he knows everything about armwrestling he has a lot of experience and it's gonna be super tough
SPEAKER_00: Yes, this is, this is, this one's tough too, but this is my first match in East versus Western King of the Table against a fellow Team West person. Um, and you know, he's not Team West, he's from Armenia. Oh, he lives in the United States. He lives in the United States. It's the same like you come here, you come here six months ago, Paul, and then you become Team West. That's okay.
SPEAKER_00: it's okay well yes i accept everybody if arson is pulling against uh i don't know iraqi um i'm rooting for arson no i understand i understand that part of this this guy is still american armenian season and if he would just go compete well probably
SPEAKER_02: Anyway, so that is the case versus West Massy, you should have heard that one. That's why I am telling, Gengin, Paul accepting everyone, I'm supporting everyone. For in United States, all the competition, where is Paul? He's supporting all the team of the, who is representing United States or living here. So this is what I was talking about. Paul is a guy with the responsibility. Paul understands.
SPEAKER_03: the, how to say, the deep meaning of East versus West. And then Paul is also, I say all this not because of what I see, but I also have a lot of times on the phone talk with him. Paul is also on a mission that, you know, to level the North American arm wrestling up, at least maybe not North American, but the American, because maybe
SPEAKER_03: North American, they don't really, I mean, train together all the time, but in U.S. a lot of times you guys met each other and then had a training together before East vs. West Masters. So I'm 100% sure that Paul most of the times are giving call to his teammates and then probably they are discussing. Am I wrong, Paul?
SPEAKER_00: No, no, I try and do all my due diligence and learn as much as I possibly can because if I don't, that's not showing my opponent enough respect. So I try to learn as much as I possibly can and listen to like if United States, North American arm wrestling is going to catch up with the rest of the world, we need European pullers to come and learn from.
SPEAKER_00: You know, like the guys that I work with, the Georgians in New York and stuff, these guys are huge. They've upped my level. They've taught me so much. So it's great. Anytime we have a foreign puller coming to the United States, that's a blessing to us, you know, and it just, it just strengthens the core unit.
SPEAKER_03: But I think during all those matches, you guys also learned a lot from all those previous events. And I see that armwrestling is at a crazy, scary level. From my perspective, it's a scary level. I'm now training probably almost two months. I skipped some trainings because I went to
SPEAKER_03: during the East vs King of the Table and the European Championship I skipped but I don't know how I will do because even if I make my best I see that the level is incredible I see that the limits of
SPEAKER_03: athletes are pushing like Michael is saying that like he's like doing PRs you know still while we see Levan is getting
SPEAKER_03: Stronger. Hermes is getting stronger. Devon is getting stronger. All other athletes, you're getting stronger, everything. So, I think that this competition level is bringing Armwrestling to a crazy level, scary level. I went to the European Championships, Paul, all the youth competitors,
SPEAKER_03: I mean, they competed huge, and then only with a few days rest, they also did great at the senior categories. They didn't have enough rest. And they are muscle. In the past, when you say youth junior, you know, it's different. Now, they are like...
SPEAKER_03: They are well-rounded, they are fired up, you know, incredible. I can't imagine what will happen in five years. But that pressure and that elevation is going to keep your feet to the fire too, Engin. So when you're training for your comeback, I'm sure that's going to make you do better too. For sure, for sure. I wish I was just like a little bit
SPEAKER_03: healthier, and I'm already, listen, my advantage most of the time was just knowing armwrestling. Like, it will not sound humble, but in my prime, I was just 10, 20 years ahead, like, about understanding of armwrestling. Now, when that understanding level is coming here, I don't know if I will still have that advantage. And when you don't have that advantage, then when it goes everything to the,
SPEAKER_03: power then you have like young stars you know they are very strong and now it is hard to hunt them all you got to do is think about that every time you're training you'll be just fine yeah i will do my best like i'm i'm motivated like a few times i started now i'm motivated after this podcast i came from romania i did pronation yesterday i did the chest tricep
SPEAKER_03: Today now I will go down and do bicep supination and we will see, you know, and okay. So, so I don't think that I don't, I don't think that I will.
SPEAKER_03: get a lot from you guys to say to each other. Because I see whenever I see the hundred percent respect, it's good. It's a good thing, you know, but just, I mean, it makes things hard, but we can talk. Arten, what is your goal? Like, what's your goal? Like, I'm sure you're coming to Chicago to beat Paul, even though you have respect, nobody's coming there to lose. And
SPEAKER_02: Do you have a dream to win the title?
SPEAKER_02: He took his title as a politician. He said, I know, I understand that you have 100% respect for him, but what is the reason? Of course, you come to win, but what do you have as a politician?
SPEAKER_04: I don't have anything against the world. You're doing it in a professional way. Now you know that this is a professional level. I have to come and win. I came to win. I'm not here to show off. I'm not here to say anything like that. I came to be able to win with the goal of winning. I don't know if I can do it. So Arsene is coming to Arsenal. First of all, I respect him.
SPEAKER_02: Arsene is coming to Chicago for winning. He doesn't come to work. He's not coming there for showing any beautiful match or something like that. He's coming here for getting the title, getting a higher level than Paul. But with respect to everything, there's nothing against Paul. This is competition and he's going to
SPEAKER_03: go forward, getting ahead. My friend, my friend, that's not disrespect. Anyone who is not having such dream, I mean, I don't think that, like, I don't know, I don't know, I don't think that they should even ask for a match at this stage. Like, we all need to have that dream. I don't think politics is a disrespect, you know.
SPEAKER_02: I understand. Paul has a very high level in this weight in the United States.
SPEAKER_02: Dav, tell me what did you collect in these 4 years, I will come and get it.
SPEAKER_02: he's saying that in the last four years whatever I have gained we like the power he's coming and using in that stage again so unfortunately the competitors is the pole okay and Paul um
SPEAKER_03: You have won the title, then you lost, and then the... In 95 kilo category, you only lost twice? Rusum and Irakli. Irakli, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And as Arsene says that he's coming here to win, I'm sure that you are also coming to win. I know you. I mean, nobody comes to lose. Um...
SPEAKER_03: And what is your, how to say, short-term goals? So the short-term goal is the one at hand. It's always the next one.
SPEAKER_00: Um, and it's important for me to achieve those short term goals, to be able, even to be able to be considered again, to have a rematch with the Radcliffe at some point or, or, or Rustom and then eventually the title. So every short term goal is the most important goal is the only goal. So, uh, ideally as it stacks up.
SPEAKER_00: as long as I can continue to get better at every short-term increment, that'll take me to where I need to be to be able to be competitive at that championship level again. That's the goal. And, you know, being an older guy, I can't afford to take any time off or to have any missteps. So, got to take them one at a time. Yeah, yeah, I understand, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: And let's talk about the rest of the event. Let's start with Alan Ford and Ryan. How do you pronounce it? He told me, but his last name. Belanger. Belanger. Yeah. Okay. Can you tell me your opinion? Man, this is a tough one because I've talked to Ian Carnegie quite a bit about Alan Ford and he believes Alan Ford is at his all time best.
SPEAKER_00: And we've seen Alan do some pretty impressive stuff over the years. And he's telling me right now that Alan is the same speed and doesn't lose any speed and he's just more powerful now. So I do think that if, if Ryan, if we see this hook
SPEAKER_00: this match go into a hook, I think it's probably Ryan's world. But the question is going to be, is he going to be able to get the timing down to set that? Are we going to see a wrist-to-wrist hook? Or are we going to see Allen be able to get out on his fingers? This one's really hard for me to predict.
SPEAKER_00: What I'm hoping is that it's really close and we see it kind of go back and forth and it goes into that deep water. But it could be one of those matches that you can't predict but goes 3-0 one way or the other. Big Grove goes, has it pulled? Have you ever pulled Andre, probably talking about Sharkovic? Yes. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: years ago, and then I practiced with him not too long ago. But I pulled, I pulled, uh, I beat Andre in the WAL amateurs many, many years ago. Uh, I beat him, uh, right and left. And then we pulled again at one of Travis Bajan's, uh, events in the overall, and then we practiced together a couple of times. Okay. Arsene, Irakli versus Matt Mask.
SPEAKER_04: I think it's 50-50 match. Both teams have a strong upper hand. I think Irakli should win, but it's 50-50 in my opinion.
SPEAKER_02: He's talking about the last match of the Irakli and he's saying that he is very good and but it's going to be a little 50-50. He's telling Irakli name a little more but mostly the 50-50 he thinks. Okay and
SPEAKER_03: This one I will ask to Paul. Joseph Meranto versus Ivan Portela. Did you have any chance to check who Ivan Portela is?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I looked a little bit. This is a tricky one too. I really like Joseph Moranto, man. I think Joseph is an awesome puller. I think he adjusts well. He's done really well on that big stage. And a lot of this match comes down to like, where is Ivan really at, you know? Like, if he's that close to his peak, it's going to be a tough day.
SPEAKER_00: for Joseph, but I tend to kind of give the edge to use in this one. The good news is they're both going probably to the same spot. So it's probably going to be a really entertaining match. I got to give the edge to Joseph. I mean, and but I wouldn't be surprised if the vine comes in and then like amazing form and and it goes the other way. But I'm definitely rooting for Joseph for sure, because I think he has a real big future and he's a great representation.
SPEAKER_04: Okay. And Arsene, Artem Morozov and Alex Kurdecha? Morozov. I think 100% been Morozov. It's left arm, right? Right arm. Right arm. I think Morozov. Morozov in which way?
SPEAKER_02: With both ways, Marzov is a universal puller and he thinks he will... I think Topr. He thinks Topr. Okay, and Paul, what's your opinion about this match?
SPEAKER_00: I think, I think it's close. And I, I think, I think, I actually think we're going to see more adults have to hook Alex. And then the question is, can he get them there? I think if more is off, turns them into a hook, I think it edges tomorrow's all for sure. I mean, we did see Alex pull very competitively inside with them in the past, but, um,
SPEAKER_00: I think I... But there was left arm. With right arm, Alex. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yeah. But if we're assuming that both of them, both of their arms are similar. But yeah, I think... I give a slight edge to Mordredov. A slight edge. But this again is a tough one to predict. Great match. Yes, yes, yes. For sure. And I will also ask you...
SPEAKER_00: Wallace Dilley versus Ricard Bormann. This match is super interesting. This is like my sleeper match. This is the one I really want to know for a lot of reasons. Because Wallace Dilley is really, really strong. I got the pull with Wallace Dilley at the Florida qualifiers afterwards. Now, he had pulled the tournament and I had after pulled a bunch. But that guy is tough. He is diesel, diesel strong.
SPEAKER_00: And then you have Rickard Borman, who is killing everybody in Australia and New Zealand and everywhere else. He's so far above everybody that it's hard to know where his level is really at.
SPEAKER_00: So to me, this one is going to be super interesting. I think there is a world where Ricard could could shoulder roll and go right through Wallace. But I think if Wallace can win center a little bit and stop the match, it could be interesting. But nonetheless, we're going to find out where Ricard is, you know, and that could mean Wallace
SPEAKER_00: you know, winds up winning the match comfortably. And now everybody's talking about Wallace. So super interesting. I'm excited because it's a newer American puller that I think has a lot of, a lot of potential. Yeah. Arsene, Michael Todd versus Giorgi Di Sereno. Arsene.
SPEAKER_04: I think, I think Michael will stand in his place. If the jury is not very deep. 60-40, I think, Michael Dodd will win. Because in the last few years, the jury has always, I don't know, lost form, but I think it will be difficult.
SPEAKER_02: He thinks Michael Todd will win because he thinks Michael Todd will stop his famous position and make him tired and get pain. So he thinks Michael Todd. And Paul?
SPEAKER_00: I think the same thing. I'm 100% behind Michael. My rationale is, I think, like you said, Michael's hitting PRs. We saw him perform as well as you possibly could perform in losing every round against Vitaly. He was able to be fast enough and get to a position in the center of the table rather than on the losing side. I think Michael's pronation is the difference maker. I think
SPEAKER_00: Georgie's so good in that supinated hook position, but there's just no way to get Michael there.
SPEAKER_00: So he's going to have to if he wins, it's going to be through probably some form of a flop press that we haven't really seen him do yet. So I think the head goes to Michael. I think he probably wins this. And also, I know Michael and I know he he's not he is not trying to lose this match at all, especially in the current standings is probably a nice high pressure match for Michael, which I think will bring the best out of him.
SPEAKER_03: Um, I want to ask you also, did you check, uh, about Elin? Elin Janheim that is going to pull Fiya Raistek? No. You don't know? I asked around, I asked around. Um, so it's correct me if I'm wrong. She has beaten Fiya in the past, right? This is kind of like... With left arm, left arm, Siobhan ended up winning.
SPEAKER_03: Right arm, she beat Fia once and Fia beat her twice. But this was probably three years ago. And at that time, like, I think since that time, Fia improved a lot. But this girl is very, very young. So she is probably like 23 now. At that time, she was 20. So from 20 to 23, to me,
SPEAKER_03: like world, you know, like, but FIA is also in her best. And so personally, I don't know. Yeah. I don't pick against FIA, especially in the past couple of years. I don't pick FIA to lose. So we'll see. But I have a feeling FIA is on a mission. Devon versus Alex Arsene. Left arm.
SPEAKER_04: I think Devon.
SPEAKER_02: He thinks for sure Devon is going to control with his wrist and win the match. For sure, Devon. And Paul? Yeah, I think this is really interesting because we've seen Devon and Alex compete in practice a lot, right? And anybody who knows Devon,
SPEAKER_00: Uh, the version of you get that you get a practice is not the version that you get on the day of competition. So, um, I think, and Devin also is one, obviously everybody knows he's one of the most cerebral and intelligent arm wrestlers in the game. So Alex, having practiced with Devin, uh, the amount of times that he has is a disadvantage for Alex, in my opinion.
SPEAKER_00: Uh, and I also think it's going to be tricky with Alex, you know, still gathering experience and everything. He's not set up with somebody like Devin. He hasn't dealt with, um, trying to get a grip with them and, and feeling all those things that he does. We all see it, but to experiences two different things. Um, but I think what makes it interesting is how smart Alex actually is.
SPEAKER_00: Devin made some videos and talking about his IQ and overall intelligence level. I'm interested to see how that'll come into play. And if Devin actually is able to, you know, play any mind games or gain any advantage in the lead up to the match. But I think- I think that's already a mind game to- I agree. Put the opponent into like the comfortable position. Alex, you are super smart. You are incredible. Like the same that he played with Hermes and I think that's what it is, you know.
SPEAKER_03: But this is from different ways. Sometimes he tries to crush, he calls them like stupid, you are not smart and this kind of things. So now it's different here. Another one I want to ask you, Wagner Bortolato versus Manuel Batalla. Manuel also with left arm was superweight champion. And what do you think about this poll? Oh man, Wagner.
SPEAKER_00: And I'm not picking him because I necessarily think he's going to win, but because I want him to win.
SPEAKER_00: I just want Wagner to win and go crazy, you know? This isn't a scientific breakdown. I just want to see Wagner go nuts and not pass out. Yeah, but not to break the table, right? No, no, no, no. Well, we don't want to see him get too worked up where, you know, somebody has to feed him gummy bears in the corner, so he got to keep going too. But I told guys to prepare another table just to make sure. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: I remember Manuel Batali during the European Championship when he lost to our friend Madojan Davit. He was a very good player and a very bad player.
SPEAKER_04: I remember it very well, but I know that it was very strong. But in my opinion, now Bortolato is physically stronger, and I think the chances are greater that Bortolato will win, because this genius as a player is physically stronger.
SPEAKER_02: He is remembering the Bortolato from the European Championship. What did Bortolato do in Manuel Batalia?
SPEAKER_02: Manuel, he is remembering Manuel from the European Championships. He has, his competitor was Armenian. Arsene has checked some styles of him. So he's very good guy. He's remembering just whenever he's starting first, he's super strong. But when he's starting by the second,
SPEAKER_02: uh he's he wasn't good before but now he arsene he arsene see a lot of improvement improvement about of the manuel and he thinks he gonna to win because he's very smart he is very strong and when he's comparing like before and now he see a lot of difference so he thinks vortalato will win
SPEAKER_03: Okay. And Paul gladiator versus the king. Oh my goodness, man. Oh my goodness. First of all, first of all, who am I speaking with? Uh, Paul's mind or heart. So you want me to answer it both ways? Both ways. Okay.
SPEAKER_00: So my mind, my mind says LeBron like 4-0. That's what my mind like looking at everything. My mind says there's no reason not to think that LeBron can't repeat everything that he's done in training. You know, people are talking about this, this 400 kilogram
SPEAKER_00: or 400 pound curl and everything else that we were discussing that specific lift the other day. And I come to the conclusion that I don't care how you move 400 pounds from your waist to your shoulders. It's super impressive. And you know, I don't care. Is it really specific? No, it's not. But it's a representation of extreme power that most of us can't even comprehend.
SPEAKER_03: So, I believe that this guy is in great form and I believe that ermines might have pissed him off just enough to make him better. But I have a question. When you lift 400 pounds, it's not specific. So, how many pounds for each arm? 200. And Hermes also does the back pressure which is more specific with the same amount of weight in eight reps.
SPEAKER_00: And do you really see so much difference in the power when you calculate that way? No, not necessarily, not from those specific lanes, but I think overall. I don't think like Levan is an overall totality. He is just one of the most powerful humans ever to walk the planet. So my scientific mind says that Levan wins 4-0. My heart,
SPEAKER_00: says, the underdog, you know, my heart says, everything that Hermes is doing, he's, he's improved his riser lift, he's improved his pronation lift, his back pressures at an all time high. And my heart says, like,
SPEAKER_00: when you see a champion win, win, win, win, win, even if you like him, like I like LaVon a lot. I don't want to root against LaVon, but my heart is like rooting to see if it is possible to beat this guy, you know, because as competitors, we always want to see, you know, the unbeatable be beaten, even if we like the guy. So my heart says,
SPEAKER_00: Ermey's got a chance. What I really want to happen is I want it to be really contested early on in like round two and three. And I want to see how the endurance plays in. And just to, even if LeBron wins, if he's contested by Ermey early on, then all these other guys who are chasing LeBron, they get another breath of hope, you know, that there's going to be a way.
SPEAKER_00: So, yeah, I think scientifically LeBron wins 4-0. I think in a perfect world scenario, we see a 4-3 silver bullet match, basically. Can I ask you something, Paul? When they pulled first time, what did you expect then? I expected 4-0. Okay, but when you saw those rounds,
SPEAKER_03: you know, which ones I'm talking about, like round three for start and round five, you know, this started, but the health ways stopped. Were you shocked? I was shocked. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. Yep. Yep. I just say that at that time, your, your mind was also saying like, yeah, domination, but, but that happened.
SPEAKER_03: So what I'm just saying that, so I think that we need to think who improved more. There is a possibility, because when you say that your mind says 4-0, my mind says there is a good possibility for 4-0. But there is a possibility, I can say, I don't normally give number, but OK, I better not. But there is something. It may finish, as you say, but there is a possibility that the math stops.
SPEAKER_00: things can change it. So I don't think that like mine should say a hundred percent, you know, for zero. No, no, I'm not putting it at a hundred percent. I put a percentage on it. No, I'm not putting a percentage on it. I'm just like, like just overall prediction. But I think you made a good point about who improved more. And it's tricky because Ermies is pretty much showing us everything he's doing. He's showing us his style of training.
SPEAKER_00: He's showing us the numbers improvement. So it's right there for us. We know, but we don't necessarily know with LeBron because he hasn't really, he hasn't shared a whole lot of those PR type things. And what it's going to do is after the match is done, we're going to potentially have a better understanding of how much those specific PRs did or didn't play into the match.
SPEAKER_00: So I think that's really interesting too, because by the numbers and by what we're seeing, I think most people would say Ermi's definitely improved more since the last time. And the other thing is that before the last match, Ermias didn't believe that he was going to win.
SPEAKER_03: He didn't even really believe one round he could win, but he said if this would happen or something. This time, even yesterday I talked with him. He believes he's going to go there and win, you know. And that is very important. Because once you have that doubt, you're going to lose that match, for sure. So he went that way to first match, he gave trouble. This time he's just going there to win.
SPEAKER_00: And I think he's gonna fight till the last drop of blood. I do think that that first match and the way all that played out gives Ermies a big advantage psychologically. So that's kind of why I said he's kind of been poking Levon and calling him out. I think that if that poking and
SPEAKER_00: If he poked that bear enough and he created the same advantage for Levan that he has for himself, that could be a difference maker too. Because I don't, Levan is not the type of guy you want to piss off before you got to compete against him. I mean, at the end, it's arm wrestling. You pissed off or not, you know, sometimes being pissed off just makes your
SPEAKER_03: mind blurry, you know. Sometimes it gets you an extra 2-3% of power, too. It may give to Hermes as well. Hermes told me that he was losing 2-0 to Levan. And then he looked at Levan's corner and Irakli was laughing at him. And when he saw that, he got angry. There it is. What's that? That's it. That's a prime example. But that's what happened on the Round 3, you know. So what I'm just saying is that being angry
SPEAKER_04: I think that it works both ways, you know. It works both ways, yeah. Anyways, Arsen, what's your opinion about this match? I think that Levan will win because he has a lot of things in common with me.
SPEAKER_04: Uh, uh,
SPEAKER_04: Levan already knows what to do so he doesn't go and do it, as you said. Levan already has a few positions, and Hermes has that one chance, in my opinion. Levan doesn't give that chance to Hermes. And I think Levan will win. Also, looking at the last videos, I feel that his level is already higher. He is specifically prepared for his
SPEAKER_02: He thinks Levan will win, absolutely Levan will win because last time Levan surprised with the earnest skills. Now Levan will get much more better, will get ready much more better than before because
SPEAKER_02: He thinks for everyone it was a surprise match that Ermes got some wins, some matches after Levan and Levan will not give any more chance to get the same position and here Levan has a lot of in every position he is pulling very well, very good and he will
SPEAKER_02: improve every position but as the Hermes has a topple position and if he will take it he maybe he can do something but Levan will stop him and will not give any chance to take any better position for a winning so he thinks Levan will win absolutely understood um we can talk about the
SPEAKER_03: But we don't know if it's going to happen or not. So that's all. Paul, do you have any last words to Arsene?
SPEAKER_00: No, I'm looking forward to Chicago. Guys, if you're watching, make sure you buy the pay-per-view. Buy it early. If you can make it to Chicago, come and join. If you're a puller, come compete on the tournament that's going to be ahead of it. It's going to be an awesome time. Arsene, thank you for the opportunity of the match. Travel safe and I'll see you soon. Any last words, Arsene?
SPEAKER_04: What do you think, what is your final message to Paul? I want everything to be without injuries. It is a great honor for me to meet Paul as a sportsman. I would like to thank him for organizing all this.
SPEAKER_04: I'm grateful to you for everything you've done for me. We'll see each other in Chicago in a week.
SPEAKER_02: First, he's thankful to you, Engin, for organizing this competition and inviting him to compete in this stage. And it's a very good honor to be a competitor of the Powell. It's a very good honor for him.
SPEAKER_02: getting ready to against Paul but it's a by the way it's very good very high honor it's honor to him to compete against Paul so see you in Chicago thank you very much and mostly he wish whatever will happen in the match just avoiding with the injuries nothing to happen whatever is going to happen without injuries
SPEAKER_03: And Paul, one last thing I want to ask you. We just passed, two days ago, the 40 row East versus West. How do you see it from the beginning? It started with the donations and everything during the pandemic. Yeah, like, do you remember all those numbers from your post? Do you remember them?
SPEAKER_00: Remember you posted the four years, the highlights of everything that was done. How many athletes competed? Like near 150 different athletes, but all 148. 148. Yeah. That's just think about that four years starting with crowdfunding, going through the pay-per-view route, how hard that that is, you know, and the growth.
SPEAKER_00: You know, it's unreal.
SPEAKER_00: You know, the amount of athletes that are getting opportunities, you know, the amount of places that have have have hosted events, the countries that have represented their country at the events in four short years, that the numbers were staggering. I remember just looking at the post. Almost 250 supermatches, almost. Unreal. And, you know, the four year mark is like an interesting thing, too, because when you look back in history of some of these promotions,
SPEAKER_00: That's usually right around the time where they fold, you know, or something happens or something. Yeah, but we're still going. Because of unifying all the top Atlas, just like if we were not unified,
SPEAKER_00: Like we wouldn't be that successful. What? Nobody knows all those, you know, those bumps in the road that you don't tell everybody, you know, all the struggles that it took to get there, all the conversations that we've had over the years, you know, about the current state of things. How many obstacles have been overcome just to get where we are right now? How many traps? We'll never know. How many? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: But we never gave up, you know, a strong will, you know, and this will continue to be successful as long as we are unified.
SPEAKER_00: Right. And it takes that initial passion coming from you to ignite the passion of the other arm wrestling supporters and the other arm wrestlers. And that unity is more important. The unification of support, you know, of the entire community. And it takes somebody like you who's doing it for the right reason.
SPEAKER_00: because nobody, you can't do that when you're doing it for money, you can't do that when you're doing it for fame. The only way it works is if it's coming from a pure place and we got a lot of people to thank for that and hopefully we just continue on the same path and keep growing. Yeah, I really hope that as you said, you know, we stay unified and we continue to make
SPEAKER_03: that mainstream dream come true. I don't see, I don't see any reason. I mean, the most, most important thing is that all these top athletes being together. Yes. Yeah. But trust me, whenever we signed a contract with the athletes, I mean, athletes never saw this as a
SPEAKER_03: business agreements. They saw this as an agreement for a mission, like making our power together for a common goal. That is what Levan told me, what Hermes told me. Maybe a few athletes were just focused on self goals, but the majority of the athletes, they were all
SPEAKER_03: here only just for a common goal, you know, trust me. That's what makes me very happy that all these athletes, like they have never seen me like a boss or something, you know, in the past or today. I was, I have always been their brother, you know, in armwrestling. They know that, you know, Engin has good intention for us. If Engin is doing it, you know, he's doing it for a good reason and things like that. Yes. They trust me. I trust them.
SPEAKER_03: And that is how we came to, as long as we have that amateur spirits, yes, business is profession needs to be, but the spirit inside of us, which is the intention, as long as we have that good intention, nothing can stop. But if we ever lose our intention and lose the spirits, it can't go any further. Right. The contracts are like signing to be a part of a team.
SPEAKER_00: You know, it's like making a team, you know, and there's an acceptance level to that too, where most of the, I think a lot of people see it from the wrong perspective. Uh, and then we talk about United, like focus and everything for me to, to, to, to be able to be a part of East versus West means that I'm being a part of a world level team of athletes that I'm just happy to be associated with.
SPEAKER_00: I'm just happy to be able to be associated with the best European pullers in the world. That's where I wanted to be when I started arm wrestling. So for me, there's never even a thought. And not to mention the East vs West and King of the Table team, that team that's putting it on is the best that there is. Why would you ever want to be? You never were in this for money. I know directly from long phone calls and everything, you know, I mean,
SPEAKER_03: I think you would even pull without money. I'm not saying that, but you would. This is the thing that I get from you. You were just happy. You don't need the money that comes to you from armwrestling. You make your living. But the pride of it, the excitement, the dream.
SPEAKER_03: That is worth much more than what you are making yet. There's no value. There's no value you can put on that. Dollars don't pay for that type of stuff. And Arsene, you have really, you really wanted to be part of East vs. West for a long time. You send me messages, Arsene, you know, there were some difficulties, but everything finished now. And now, are you happy to be on that stage?
SPEAKER_02: yes of course of course yeah you deserve it you deserve it well deserved
SPEAKER_04: There was a time when I used to say to people around me that I am a participant. Now is the time when I am a participant. I am thankful for everything that is organized, the competitions, the matches. I understand that this Armwrestling is a big family for me.
SPEAKER_04: I love everyone. I am very happy and grateful for everything. We will try to be stronger so that we can move forward with this family.
SPEAKER_02: So two years ago he was thinking about when he was seeing this march, this stage, he was thinking about it when will come a day when I will appear in this stage or not.
SPEAKER_02: so now he's super happy that he's competing in this stage he has a right now he has a power competitors like Pauline and this is already he's very surprised very happy for all of this and he's very happy to he's going to continue the
SPEAKER_02: this uh to be in this stage uh as much as possible he's planning to get much more uh level has much more uh much again in this stage and the mostly this is this whatever is he's not going for like uh the goal is not to make a money the goal is to be here and
SPEAKER_02: The goal is the performance, what he can do in this stage.
SPEAKER_02: yeah yeah this is the most important thing for for for him and this is whatever is happening in this stage it's uh because of you at Engin and uh we understand it's super hard to negotiate a lot a lot of the competitors a lot of the of these athletes to take them in one stage some people are asking a lot of strange
SPEAKER_02: uh questions we are it's very hard so now you are very hard yeah he's a smart guy like he understands yeah it's very hard we appreciate it and we are doing whatever we can just make your uh something easier for you for the association for uh going forward together yeah thank you
SPEAKER_03: Anyways, Arsene, the last word is that you said that you want to be on this stage as soon as possible. This is the guy there with the hat. He's standing on your way, you know. I'm not saying anything else. I had to steer the boat, Paul. I know, I know, I'm used to it now. Anyways, guys, you guys take care and thanks for being part of it. And let's do a bicep flex before we
SPEAKER_03: Yeah. Yes, yes. Two strong guys. Take care, guys. And thanks to everyone. Take care, guys.
