SPEAKER_03: Let me let me do the. And then and then we can talk here, but just let me. So we are live now, right? So once again.
SPEAKER_03: Hello Matt, hello Irakli, hello Roman. We thought that we were live and then I realized that we were not live and then at that moment Irakli asked Roman to translate and to tell Matt that you know he hopes that Matt is not scared of his arms and Matt said that he's not scared of anyone.
SPEAKER_03: And Matt, am I correct? You said that he's the one that is not pulling everyone. What did you say? I said, I'm not scared to pull anybody or anybody's arms, and I'm sure you can contest that, Engin. Yeah, yeah, yeah. If you ever set me up across the table against or asked me who I'd be willing to pull, I said, sure. I mean, you even pulled Arthur Morozov. What's that? You even pulled against Arthur Morozov.
SPEAKER_03: yeah yeah and i'd pull them again if you wanted me to pull them i'd give a yeah yeah yeah that that that was a big mistake from my side you guys were not even close with left arm and he was super heavyweight while at that time you were heavyweight well you went on to be number one in the world after that yeah yeah yeah yeah you kind of led like number one super heavyweight on left arm to the one 15 kg guy yeah yeah yeah that's what happens and and it actually
SPEAKER_04: ask you what's your weight matt yeah he just asked i just stepped on the scale fully clothed right now i'm 231.2 so you are you are even less than 105 yeah yeah i'm probably like 103 and a half kgs right now 103 kgs um we are now live roman
SPEAKER_03: yes yes we are right okay and we already got a super chat oh one second i don't know why i can't something is wrong with my home but yeah 100 people watching already okay so just can you read that the super chat
SPEAKER_02: For sure. So Dickson Nass is sending us $2 super chat. He's saying, Matt takes Iraqis risk 99 to null. And he got four likes on that comment. 100, 100. Maybe 100. Why only 99? Roman, would you like to read the chat?
SPEAKER_03: Like if Super Chat comes, yeah. Okay, so let's talk. Like, Irakli, am I wrong that you are bigger than usual, your arms?
SPEAKER_00: I think, as you said, it's not a big deal for us. Yes, yes, it's a big deal. It's a big deal. It's a big deal. It's a big deal. It's a big deal. It's a big deal. It's a big deal. It's a big deal. It's a big deal. It's a big deal.
SPEAKER_02: I've been training a bunch and lately even heavier weights than usual. And I also gained weight. I'm around 102. And in my arms, I noticed that. And even other people also constantly telling me that I look bigger. So, yeah, currently I'm 102. And I train even heavier weights than usual.
SPEAKER_03: okay a little bit louder if you talk roman and then yeah and and and math do do i mean i'm sure you don't care about his arm size right all you care about i don't care how big a guy's arms are so it's up
SPEAKER_03: Do you think that Matt, stylistically and because of his arm length and everything, Irakli is a better matchup for you than Nugo?
SPEAKER_04: Well, I think maybe in the right arm, yeah. The left, it's hard to say. I don't know where the heck he's at with his left arm. I'm not really 100% sure how he pulls with his left arm. So it's all kind of up in the air right now, right, on how it's going to go with the left. My left, I'm not really sure where it's at. It's feeling pretty good right now. It's usually up and down. I'll feel good for about a week. I feel like shit for three months.
SPEAKER_04: And this is a time where it's actually starting to feel half decent right now. So we'll see. We'll see. My left is completely different than my right does. I'm sure Rakhli's left is completely different than his right. So it all depends on what's going to happen when we get to the table. I really have no clue what angle, what direction we're going to be going in. Am I wrong that you have some pins on Devon?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, in the left. Yeah. Yeah. Years ago. Years ago. Yeah. And in the Orlando, the Challenger Series, you won with your left arm. Can you remind us who you beat? Wilton Brock. Yeah, Wilton Brock. The guy is a strong guy with left arm. Yeah, he's good. Yeah, he's good. He's a strong North American bowler. So, yeah, I don't know if he's Georgian level, but...
SPEAKER_03: Listen, it actually is left arm and right arm. How much difference do you think you have with your right and left, between your right and left? Like me?
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I'd say my my right is way more. I can pull more angles with it. It's more fluent. It feels more. It has a lot more finesse. My hand is more dominant to my right than my left is. My left is is got a lot more sticky spots to it than my right does, and in areas where I'm weaker with my right, I'm stronger with my left so.
SPEAKER_03: When you say you have a sticking point, it is like since Iraq is dominant, the army is not on the left either. So do you think it will be a plus for you to stop him to get your position?
SPEAKER_04: to say i've never really pulled with a left arm so like it's really really really hard to say so where where exactly okay if his left arm and right arm is just the same style
SPEAKER_03: the way that he's playing with uh right and left same and like how much do you think that like if if he's like just say that if his left is 70 of his right arm uh do you think you would beat him uh i really don't know if i'm gonna beat him i think i personally think he's the i'm the underdog of this one
SPEAKER_03: I believe 100% that I'm the underdog and he is the favorite to win. Why do you know about his left arm? What's that? What do you know about his left arm that you think that you are underdog?
SPEAKER_04: I don't. I just know about my left. That's all. I don't know. I have seen you toppling down and even pinning him, you know. I don't know. Yeah, but it's the confidence level, right? The confidence level with my left. Every single match I've pulled in my left with the last couple of years, I'm not confident in any way whatsoever. And for some reason... Yet you are winning, right? Yet you are winning. Yeah, except I always end up winning.
SPEAKER_03: but it's yeah like it's it's my little brother right i know i remember i remember rambet won the walk wars uh in manchester with left arm senior category uh masters he won right and left and left arm he won the uh seniors and right arm he didn't win he took
SPEAKER_03: And around those years, I remember this guy, Wilton Brock, beat Rambet with left arm. That's how I heard his name. And then whenever you and he were set for the Challenger Series, I thought that he was going to beat you. But I kind of remember that he was confident winning that match. Am I wrong?
SPEAKER_03: uh no i was more confident in winning the right arm match than it was the left arm match i had that day no no when you're confident i mean like within the match like after the mess like you you had the control like this is how i remember you beat the three right i think it was three zero yeah i can remember yeah and yeah and you are saying you don't know much about iraq you never check his videos with left arm
SPEAKER_03: Well, he doesn't really have a whole lot out there with his left arm. Yeah, yeah. Irakli, when was the last time you pulled with left arm? Was it 2019?
SPEAKER_00: It was in 2009, wasn't it? Yes, it was in 2009. When the match was held, as you know, I didn't want to participate in the competition, because it was the biggest European championship in the new years. And the match was held at the Magnitsky-Svobodny Championship. The match was held on the eve of the World Cup, and the match was held on the eve of the World Cup.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know how to explain it, but I understand it. I understand it, and that's why I don't have any doubts. I've been doing it for a long time, and I've been doing it for a long time during the whole period. I have a lot of resources, but I don't have a lot of competition. That's why I've been doing it in this form. I don't have any doubts. I'm a very good player, and I have a lot of confidence that I'll be able to win in both games.
SPEAKER_02: Yes, I think you're correct. It was 2019. I pulled last time on lefty. I actually end up even competing really good at seniors back then. However, I kind of injured my left wrist. I don't even remember how can.
SPEAKER_02: Somebody injured wrist during the sleep out, but that's what happened. So I injured them since then. I didn't even kind of have any coverage nor any type of a wheel to just pull lefty. So it's kind of was like left on the shelf. So say, but and also, I was not like, trying to get it in the competing level shape. So I never really hard trained it, but lately I started to train because I had enthusiasm and wish to.
SPEAKER_03: compete on both arms like why not if i if i'm capable to beat uh and become number one uh on right let's let's go with lefty as well yeah yeah yeah and his last time uh before love wars did he take second place to bet killing at the europeans
SPEAKER_00: Was it Bulgaria? Or? Yes, yes, yes. Yes, I mean, after that, in Europe, when he won and became a champion, he was in the European Championship in 1975, and he was in the European Championship in 1990.
SPEAKER_02: Ah, right. That's correct. But after that one, there was another European after Bulgaria. It was in Greece. Greece, yeah. I end up number one, but I was 75 kg and Betkili was 80. Okay. He won the Seniors? Yes, yes. Samzat Khutmeti, senior in my game. Good, good, good. Hmm. Wow. I couldn't remember. Yeah. I'm 78 kg right now. Can't believe that Betkili was 75.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, he was even 70 kilos. He was very, very strong. And Irakli, how would you compare your right and left?
SPEAKER_00: As you can see, Martskina and Marjuena are in the same group. The results show that Marjuena and Martskina are in the same group. The results show that Martskina is in the 10% group. Martskina has a lot of muscles. She has a lot of muscles in her lower back, in her biceps, in her hips, in her thighs.
SPEAKER_00: For example, let's say that you have a lot of money in your pocket and you want to spend it on something and you want to spend it on something and you want to spend it on something and you want to spend it on something and you want to spend it
SPEAKER_02: There's a difference between my both arms in technique-wise and also strength-wise. I would say my right arm is around 10% stronger. So if I would compare, my left is around 90% of my right arm strength-wise. However, my left arm has advantage over the right. So when it comes to technicality, I'm versatile there. I feel myself more fluent when I can pull with...
SPEAKER_02: sideways, back pressure, hook. I feel it's more like fluid when it comes to the movements. Whilst on right arm, majorly, I pull in my style that everybody knows outside. That's the difference. I'm kind of noticing the fear in Matt's eyes. Is it something?
SPEAKER_03: It's not fear. I'm tired. I'm tired and hungry. And Matt, like when you say that you are underdog,
SPEAKER_04: in this match, is it on the paper or is it in your mind as well? Both. I would say both. I would say both. Like, I don't know, anybody that knows me and knows my left and, you know, just assuming Irakli's telling everything that he is truthful about his left and where it is and where it's at would suggest that I'm probably the underdog. So what does it mean that you're coming to Chicago to lose?
SPEAKER_04: I'm not coming to lose. I never come to lose. I come to fucking prove myself. I come to test myself. I want to see where I'm at. Even if I lose, it doesn't mean I'm going to fucking run away or I'm going to hide or I'm going to fear. I'm going to learn way more from a loss. I'm going to pick way more up from a loss than I will going in spanking everybody any day. That's why I don't ever deter away from matches on people that I think probably will be me.
SPEAKER_04: So because then if I do end up beating them, then it just makes me gives me that much more confidence and everything else about myself. But at the same token, if I do lose, there's a little bit of information that I get from that person every time that I do so. So at the end of it, even a loss, I'm still going to become a better arm wrestler because of it. So I'd be crazy. I'd be crazy not to take the match. You're not coming there to learn from your loss. Are you coming there to beat this guy?
SPEAKER_04: well, I'm coming there to beat this guy, but at the end of the day, at the end of the day, it's going to be a win-win situation, whether I win or I lose. Losing doesn't scare me. I'm not scared to lose because I know I'm going to end up coming out better at the end of it, whether I win or I fucking lose. Can I ask you something, Matt? If we judge by the right arm,
SPEAKER_04: Do you see yourself in a higher level than Irakli, since you beat Ongarbev and he lost against Ongarbev? Do you see it that way? Like, would you see yourself under him? Loss, I would say no. But prior to that loss, I would say, yeah, that we're definitely right on the same fucking level. If not, I believe I should be ranked above him prior to my last loss. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: So, so you are, you are like, if it was a right arm match, you would see yourself like favorites? I would see myself as the favorite, whether, whether I'm going to go in super cocky and thinking that I'd fucking completely mopped the floor with him. That's a different story because every single time I've ever had that thought go into my mind, going into a match, we know what the outcome is.
SPEAKER_04: And on that MF, you were more careful? I was worried as fuck about Angubayev. Angubayev is Angubayev, right? Yeah. Like, look at what the man's accomplished. Look what he can do on the table. Look how technical he is. Look at the areas that he was getting Iraqli pulling and everybody else that he's pulled. So it's, yeah, I was nervous as fuck.
SPEAKER_04: I wasn't even really concerned at all. I wasn't even hyped up until five minutes before they called my name to the table. I just couldn't fathom.
SPEAKER_03: Except the fact that a guy that size had the amount of power and smarts and every table IQ that he did to him. He, I completely underestimated him in absolutely every single way. Surprising with such a size, you know, the, the power is coming. Like, like I was very surprised when he, when he beat Krasimir at the Europeans final, it's uprooted him and beat him. And I was like, wow, you know, and, and exactly.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, one more question before I go to Iraq. Do you think that Nugo would beat Iraq right now? I would say that Iraq probably has a little bit of experience with Nugo, seeing as how they're from the same country. He's gripped up with them. He understands where his strengths and maybe some of his weaknesses are. I don't think they train. They've never trained. They've never gripped up. I haven't seen this at least. Maybe when they were younger, but recently I've never seen it.
SPEAKER_03: Irakli, have you trained with Nugo in recent years? No, right? No. No. No. Nugo lives in different city, different part of Turkey. I know, I know, different city, but yeah.
SPEAKER_00: And in the past, when you were young, did you train with him?
SPEAKER_02: On Right Arm, we have actually competed against each other two times. We ended up fooling each other. It was 2019 and 2020. And they won one and one?
SPEAKER_00: In 2009, he was the only one to make it to the final, and in 2008, he made it to the second place.
SPEAKER_02: So 2019, they end up at the tournament, they end up facing each other three times. First Nugo took, then they had two finals because both Irakli was the winner. And next year, 2020, two times they faced and both times even easier Irakli. Easier than it was 2019. In 2019, at the end who won? Irakli? Irakli. So both years Irakli end up winning?
SPEAKER_04: Okay, I understand. I would say anybody that is going to take Nugo likely in any way, no matter what weight class they are, if they're stepping across the table with Nugo after his last performance, I think they're committing suicide.
SPEAKER_04: I don't think Nugo is somebody that should be taken lightly in any way. The amount of connection that he has with his arm, even his table IQ with the different hands set up, he would be coming at a different angle. He's very, very smart. He's very, very strong and he's very, very technical. And if you do have a longer arm and you're not...
SPEAKER_04: used to competing with a shorter arm and you don't take him likely he's going to run circles around you i think so like i think nugo has definitely hit a different level even even with me not taking him as serious as i should have he's way way stronger and way smarter than i ever had anticipated
SPEAKER_03: Iraqli, so UN thoughts again pulling? And most likely September, most likely, and we will see. And how do you take thoughts, thoughts, response to you about your complaint?
SPEAKER_00: I would like to ask you a question. How did you feel when you saw your opponent? I was not serious and I didn't want to hurt him. I was not serious and I didn't want to hurt him. When my sportsman told me that he was going to beat me, I didn't think that he was going to beat me and that I was going to beat him.
SPEAKER_00: I don't want to go to the gym, and I don't want to go to the gym, and I don't want to go to the gym, and I don't want to go to the gym, and I don't want to go to the gym,
SPEAKER_00: It is impossible to say that Samartlian will be the only one who will be able to do it. It is impossible to say that he will be the only one who will be able to do it. It is impossible to say that he will be the only one who will be able to do it. It is impossible to say that he will be able to do it.
SPEAKER_02: Well, I didn't take him lightly, seriously, because, I mean, he keeps acting like not a sportsman, what I would call as a sportsmanship, because that's not what champions do when they get called out, and basically you have not even one pin, legit pin, against the ex-champion, and out of four pins, none of them are legit, and you're still kind of calling out the other guy as a crybaby, that's, to me, it's not a sportsmanship, and
SPEAKER_02: that's not what Champions do uh he should have just stayed silent and just said that yes rematch should be done because there are some questions need to be answered so I would gladly do rematch that's what he should have said but he did not do so but uh regardless of that I'm gonna go there September uh and take the smile away from his face
SPEAKER_00: I would like to say that one of the things that I would like to say is that I would like to say something that I don't want to say, because I don't want to say something that I don't want to say because I don't want to say something that I don't want to say.
SPEAKER_00: If after a match you decide that you don't want to fight me, I will fight you no matter what and there will be no problem, because you will be able to fight me.
SPEAKER_00: I was afraid that I would not be able to do it. I was afraid that I would not be able to do it. I was afraid that I would not be able to do it. I was afraid that I would not be able to do it.
SPEAKER_02: Well, I'm going to call it right here right now. Matt is listening and it's our show. Can you speak a little bit louder, Roman? Yeah. So, Matt, I'm going to state it right here right now for our match. If I ever see that I somehow end up beating you even at least one round,
SPEAKER_02: with the uh not correct way and like by fouls which were not called i would personally come to you and say that we're gonna have a rematch no problem i'm just calling you right now because this is the sportsmanship obviously during the match there are some adrenaline i may not uh find it immediately because of the adrenaline rush and i may miss it but once i rewatch it and i definitely see that there is the uh uh some
SPEAKER_03: not legit calls that led me to victory, I would definitely offer you a rematch right then and there. I want to say that as the matchmaker guy, I don't plan to set this match one more time, no matter what the outcome is. So, but yeah. And Matt, you are saying that your left
SPEAKER_03: Like, you are, like, underestimating a bit. Like, if your left wasn't that strong, do you think that they would set you the match against Devin? Because Devin's left arm is also, like, very good. He used to be number one in the world, at least on the rankings. So don't you think that, like, you are a bit underestimating your left arm? I always underestimate my left, though.
SPEAKER_04: It's like I said, it doesn't. It never feels coordinated. Good for like I'm strong as fuck. Usually for the first two to four matches and then injuries, tweaks and everything else come into play and then for the next.
SPEAKER_04: two months i'm usually icing it i'm doing light lightweight i'm not doing much table time with it i'm pretty much it feels like i'm always trying to recover it even when i'm getting ready for a match with my left arm and it's feeling crisp and it feels like it's on point
SPEAKER_04: I still feel like I'm trying to always recover it for some reason. Even though I've had way more injuries with my right, my left always seems to be in a lot more pain and it always feels like I'm trying to get it motivated to do something, right? I got to have pep talks with it before we go up to the stage. Okay, when the referees close their hands and they say go, you're going to move, right? You know what I mean?
SPEAKER_04: it's not really there, right? But I think that majority of the arm wrestlers in the world, their left isn't as good as their right. So even if you have a decent left, it's still a phenomenal left arm, right? I don't think that, like when Irakli said that 90% of his rights may be with the waist, but for someone who has not been pulling for six years in a competition,
SPEAKER_03: I don't think that without seeing that pressure,
SPEAKER_04: in the competition. Going from zero to 100 is different than grabbing a weight and slowly easing into it. You know what I mean? Zero to 100 and the weight's only pulling one direction, like static holds are one thing, but when you're getting your arm twisted, pulled, and dragged into three different directions, it's a different situation, right? Without competing, it doesn't matter how much you're lifting.
SPEAKER_03: I mean it is for sure like he has been pulling against Todd like and and all those like Ruslan Bavev and other guys Sasho and all those matches and their preparation like it is impossible to be inactive for six years and then be only 10 percent behind maybe with the weights maybe with the weights because whenever he's doing those barbell curves he's he's training with with both arms you know all the time you know it's yeah but we will see
SPEAKER_03: We will see how it will go. Irakli, are you not worried about the jet lag? I'm going to translate it. There's one super chat, maybe you can also, in the meantime.
SPEAKER_02: Well, I mean, I'm going to be traveling there five, four, five days earlier than the event day. So it should be enough to recover. Yeah, but he has never been.
SPEAKER_03: other side of the ocean. I'm just looking at Matt's performances against Lars and Marcio and then lately Ongarbe. I think it is just a little bit...
SPEAKER_04: do you think it makes a difference even just the the adaptant to food and everything else i don't know what it is about turkey every time i go to turkey when i'm there for the first four or five days i'm pissing out of my arse right just the change and adapt to the different meats or chickens or whatever it is i'm not sure but every single time i've ever gone to turkey maybe four or five days i got the runs yeah maybe something about you because
SPEAKER_04: majority of the athletes i don't hear such thing yeah yeah i've never i've never had an issue going to dubai i've never any anywhere else i don't know what it is about turkey but every time i'm there i'm pissing out of mirrors feel sorry for the clean ladies of the hotel room i tell you yeah yeah but again as i said that like this is the first time i'm hearing from an athlete the other at this they love it
SPEAKER_03: yeah oh i like the food don't get me wrong i'm not complaining i just don't know why my guts don't like it right so my ass for about a week afterwards something you may be allergic or something because the other people are threatened as well weird kind of yeah and mark aurel says leon and iraqi kept crying until engine agrees um do you do you want to
SPEAKER_02: Do you want to answer this, Irakli? Yes, it was a great chat, right? That Levan and Irakli are very close to each other, they are very close to each other, they are very close to each other, they are very close to each other. Yes, Engin is a great organization, he is a great partner of Engin, he is my friend.
SPEAKER_00: And of course, the fact that I was not the only one who was involved in this, I was also the one who was involved in this, because I was the first person to be involved in this, and I knew that I was going to be a part of it, because I was the first person to be involved.
SPEAKER_02: Well, Engin's initiative has never been to show the results the way it was shown between me and Todzilla in Georgia. So had I lost the match like I did in the first time, I'm sure Engin would never even
SPEAKER_02: agree to set the rematch but i think he actually kind of already knew once he himself without me and leon's uh interpretations he or he knew that i deserved the chance to answer some questions so that's why i end up getting rematched
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, yeah. Irakli sent me those photos and he said, you know our nursing, you know our nursing, that you know how much, you know, how much it makes difference, you know, when you are doing this. And I said, I told him that if Todd is going to, you know,
SPEAKER_03: agree and I'm gonna set this and I asked to talk he said okay let's go so Tatashin said let's go and then when when both athletes agreed so I also agreed yeah and yeah and okay so um so let's talk about some other matches Matt uh we we so you saw that uh Alan Ford
SPEAKER_03: Ryan Ballinger. You saw the poster. What do you think about the match? I think it's going to be interesting. I think Ballinger definitely has more torque.
SPEAKER_04: A lot more torque, especially if he gets his hook set. I believe he's got more power in there. Allen has real long arm, real explosive hit, really good at maintaining that hand control. So it all depends on how Ballinger is going to fare with Allen's hit.
SPEAKER_04: I believe if he gets to stop on Allen and can turn him inside, I think it's going to be a long day for Allen and it's going to be a good day for Ballinger. But Allen's hit for many, many arm wrestlers is very, very difficult to deal with.
SPEAKER_04: Not only is he fast, but the crispness and the finesse that he has, there's not really any legs or anything in there for you to be able to have a chance to actually grab and all your muscles and everything tighten up. So it's actually going to be a really, really interesting match. It's either going to be a clean sweep 3-0 for Alan Ford.
SPEAKER_04: Or we're going to see a grinder and we're going to see Ballinger come out on this one. But I think we're going to see Allen come out of the gate talk the first couple rounds. And then round three is where we might end up seeing shit start to turn around. I was told that Allen has never been this strong. This is what I was told. Everybody says that, right? Yeah. Only a few years ago when I offered him a match, he was around 90 kilos and now he's
SPEAKER_04: 100 kilo, I think he's really bigger than before. Like if Alan is on, if Alan is on, Alan is a phenomenal, phenomenal arm wrestler. 10 years ago, he was right up there with Hutchins, banging with Hutchins, giving him nothing but fucking grief every time they went to pull each other, right? Yeah. And Irakli, do you know this athlete?
SPEAKER_02: Alan Ford and Ryan Bellinger. Hello? Unfortunately, he's not a familiar either of them. Unfortunately. He doesn't know? OK. Yeah, he unfortunately doesn't know.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, okay. Sean Croucher, how confident is Irakli? Is he willing to put his M5 on the line? Irakli, how confident are you? Are you happy? Are you satisfied? Are you happy with your M5? I'm happy and I'm not afraid to put my M5 on the line because I have the best packages and I have the best packages in this market.
SPEAKER_00: Well, I'm not the only one.
SPEAKER_04: I'm not the gambling guy, usually. Everybody's not a gambling guy as soon as something's on the line. You were waiting for that one. Oh, fuck. I whooped your ass. You don't stand a chance. Hey, let's go. Well, you know, I don't really agree with gambling. My mother always told me it was wrong. You know, it's part of the devil, right? Roman translated. I'm curious about Iraqi's reaction. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: exactly yeah i'm gonna i'll keep finna i will finish up what iraqi said uh i'm usually not a gambling guy who bets uh such a stuff but definitely i'm gonna win and i'm coming here i'm coming there from this long way not because to lose so it sounds like you got yourself a deal sean hey
SPEAKER_02: Roman, are you going to translate what I said? Yes, I'm going to translate now.
SPEAKER_02: If you are talking loudmouth, Matt, how about your car versus my car? Let's bet on that. What type of car do you?
SPEAKER_03: Look at the left arm of Matt. I think he's going to bring a toy car. I got one here somewhere. I think you are correct.
SPEAKER_02: I think my dog ate it my dog ate my car I don't I don't own a car I got a company truck but if we ask Packers Plus very nicely maybe they'll be willing to wager my truck for you so
SPEAKER_03: Irakli, that left arm of Matt looks big. Which arm are you talking about? I barely even see it. Oh, he thinks that they are skinny? Look at the shoulder, everything. I think Irakli is playing a game.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but I think Matt has longer arms, and they look really big to me. I don't know why. Look at the shoulder head of Matt. Like, look at the left shoulder head. Look at, look at, yeah. It's too tiny.
SPEAKER_04: Too tiny. You need a bigger phone. You need a bigger phone. Maybe you should be looking at me on an iPad or something. My arms aren't big, Engin. It's just because I got a real small head. Look at the shoulder. No, no, no, no. I can't be the only one that's seen it. No, no, it looks big. It's just because I got a really small head, Engin. That's all.
SPEAKER_02: I'm 228 fucking pounds. I ain't got no fat on me. I don't know. I don't know.
SPEAKER_02: That's actually a bad thing. You're not going to play well if you are only 1-0-2 because it's going to lead you to the defeat. Maybe we should just meet at 95. You want to just meet at 95 then or what? You can't just meet at 95. You can't just meet at 95. You can't just meet at 95. You can't just meet at 95.
SPEAKER_02: You look already weak at 102 and 95, I can already imagine. So let's stick with what we have, because I'm coming a long way. I don't want you to end up like a fraction of yourself. He doesn't want to cut. He doesn't want to cut, eh? I've been coming for like four, five times. I've been coming for like four, five times.
SPEAKER_02: I've been cutting weights like four or five times. Last matches I had. So I really don't want to cut right now, actually, to be honest. Yeah. Doyle Conrad says, Irakli, if you beat Matt, Devon will be coming for you.
SPEAKER_02: um
SPEAKER_02: That's crazy. That's crazy.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, as soon as we turned on the video and I saw his face, I acknowledged that he's kind of scared. I looked immediately at my arms. They look quite big, so I just want to double check. How fucking full are you of yourself?
SPEAKER_04: Where you're fucking sitting there and go, oh, you must be scared because I got the little biceps. You know what I mean? You think this is fear? This is not fear in my eyes. I'm at peace right now.
SPEAKER_04: so when they call my name to the table you'll see the fear man on this planet there's no let's put it this way okay there's not a person on this planet with a that i'm scared of
SPEAKER_04: You know what I mean? Women scare the fuck out of me. Some women are fucking nasty as fucking hell and scare the shit out of me. But there ain't a fucking dude with a pecker between his fucking legs that I'm scared of. Unless... Unless... Arakli has recently chopped his fucking dick off.
SPEAKER_04: and he's switching fucking groups, then maybe I might be a little scared of him because that shit freaks me the fuck out. Let me translate that one. I would just say that Matt is not scared of him.
SPEAKER_02: In short, there is a lot of history about it. It is not possible to do it. If you do something wrong, you can't do it. If you do something wrong, you can't do it. If you do something wrong, you can't do it. If you do something wrong, you can't do it. If you do something wrong, you can't do it. If you do something wrong, you can't do it.
SPEAKER_02: that's good that's good i want you not to be scared that's great let's clash like a real man and pull like a real man and show the good good show and good match all right for sure absolutely it's gonna be a war don't don't think you're traveling all this way just for an easy win so
SPEAKER_02: There's no easy match, absolutely, I agree with that. There's no easy match on stage. Irakli, were you surprised when Matt beat Ongarweb?
SPEAKER_00: Well, why not? I would like to say that it is possible, but I don't want to say that it is possible. I don't want to say that it is possible. I don't want to say that it is possible.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it actually did surprise me. But to be honest, not because that he's right now on the other side, but really like every time I end up talking prior to that event with my fellows and we did some predictions on this match, I always my hunches and my guts were telling that Matt would win. I don't know why, but I always kind of thought so.
SPEAKER_02: but still the way he beat him surprised me i'm not saying this because he's here listening to us i i i i think he is afraid of math and and that's why he's saying all these nice things i think i think he's just trying to butter me up
SPEAKER_04: And he doesn't want the wild horse to come out on the fucking table. I think that's what bothers him. That's what sets him a little uneasy. That's kind of more what he's scared of is the unsportsmanlike conduct I tend to, I guess, portray, I guess, when I'm on the table. And it's just because I let all my emotions go. Maybe in Georgia, they're not used to their emotions flowing.
SPEAKER_02: But when my name is called to the table, all my emotions are going to be let know. And I think that's what Iraq is scared of the most. I agree with you. It's not my fault that I'm afraid of being called to the table. It's not my fault that I'm afraid of being called to the table.
SPEAKER_02: And there is a strategy like this, that is, when you are in a bad mood, and as my friends say, I am not the type to be in a bad mood, but I have to admit that I am the type to be in a bad mood when I am not feeling well and when my emotions are in a bad mood.
SPEAKER_00: Well, I think that it is very important for Georgians to be able to speak our language, and our language is not like ours, it is not like ours, it is not like ours.
SPEAKER_00: It's a movie, when you have to deal with the Georgian emotions, when you have to go to the bathroom, and when you have to go to the toilet, and that's not our problem, because it's not our problem at all. I don't care what happens to me, it's just a matter of time.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know,
SPEAKER_02: Since you are mentioning Georgians, we all know your recent experience about you with your all motion invested, how can I say, expressions, how it worked against Georgians. So I'm definitely not worried about that as a Georgian.
SPEAKER_02: uh yeah i'm definitely not trying to uh um like get on your uh soft side and make sure that your strategy will uh uh become something different no just bring bring yourself i'm gonna come there and just make it make sure that i will defeat you convincingly so that there will be no questions and uh yeah speaking of georgians i will be another one who will meet you from
SPEAKER_03: okay there is another super chat doyle conrad says met and walk the spirit of tozilla and beat him do you need something what's up can you read the super chat roman the last one i didn't read it no uh
SPEAKER_02: yeah doily conrad is saying matt invoked the spirit of tozilla and beat him they've got some likes as well so this one's for toddzilla okay
SPEAKER_02: It's actually really, really good and very kind of you to devote your loss to Todzilla. That's going to make a good solid ground for my match against him in September. You've got four weeks left yet.
SPEAKER_02: Four weeks, bask in the glory while you can, my man. Once I'm going to beat you, I will end up like a king as I am right now. Irakli, will you feel comfortable pulling in front of probably 1,500 North Americans?
SPEAKER_02: I tell you right now, I wouldn't be surprised if there's just as many Georgians in the room as there is Americans.
SPEAKER_04: the last time Lavon pulled on American soil, I'm pretty sure you could hear the Georgians a lot more than you were able to hear the Americans. There's probably about 200 Georgians in the room, but the decibel level from the Georgian side to the American side was almost uncomparable.
SPEAKER_00: I'm just kind of a bit worried about Todzilla's fanboys because they are flooded in the internet since I mentioned our matches
SPEAKER_03: these falls and stuff, so I'm kind of worried about that. They are commenting quite wild stuff, but other than that, I'm good. Yeah. Okay, so let's go to another match. Irakli, Wagner-Bortalato versus Manuel Batalla.
SPEAKER_00: I think Batalya won the European Championship as well. I think Batalya is better than Portolato.
SPEAKER_02: He said Bortolato is favorite. As I recall, Bataglia is an outside puller, top role. But statistically and strength-wise, I still think Bortolato is favorite in this. And Matt, do you know Maneo? I don't know a whole lot about him, but I know...
SPEAKER_04: Bortolotto is an absolute lunatic and willing to risk life and limb on the table. And I think he's hungry, hungry and really hungry because he's had quite a few losses lately and nothing I think would get him going more than a win. So I think he's, he's digging deep for this one. So I'm going to go Bortolotto. Uh, Matt, how would you like a match? Um,
SPEAKER_03: Like, just imagine that at arm wrestling table, you are there, Wagner is there, and Nugo is there, and two of you are arm wrestling and one of you is referee. Yeah, I'd do it. I don't give a fuck. No. Yeah. Yeah. It would be fun, huh? Yeah. I would pay for you better. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Anyways, yeah, so let's go to another match. Michael Todd vs. Gyorgy Dzerano. Irakli, let's start with you. It's not a bad match, but my favorite match is against Dzerano.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know about Georgi, but he didn't have a lot of technique, but he had a lot of power. And I think he had a very good match with Michael.
SPEAKER_02: It's kind of hard to call, but I would still consider Zorano a slight favorite. There's the fact that Michael Todd had a very tough match against Vitaly recently, right? A couple of weeks ago. And also,
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, no offense to Georgi. He's very strong, but not as much technical. However, strength-wise, I think it's going to be a bit enough to be a favorite, slightly. And Matt? I'm excited to see this one myself, honestly. Georgi is...
SPEAKER_04: he's one of my favorite people in the sport. I've gotten to know him on a personal level. One of the nicest dudes you've ever met. Uh, and the size and mass that that man's put on the last year and a half is pretty impressive. Uh, the strength, his hand is super, super massive. I don't know how well Mike is going to be able to deal with his hand. Mike has retarded amounts of pronation when he gets into his King's move. Um,
SPEAKER_04: And Georgie is more of a powerhouse, not as technical, I don't think. But Georgie is also willing to risk his elbow, risk his shoulder,
SPEAKER_04: whatever part of his body, it doesn't really matter, to try to get that win. So I'm honestly completely up in the air on this one. I think Georgie's going to suffer a little bit just because he doesn't have as long of an arm as Vitaly does. So when he does get into that position where he does need to press him, he's not going to be so much more over Mike's side of the table where it's easier for Mike to defend himself.
SPEAKER_04: but the heart that georgie has uh i i'm 50 50 on this one honestly 50 50 i don't know who's gonna win so he already said uh slight favorite would be toronto but like but like louder roman
SPEAKER_02: So I think it's my microphone. Sorry about that. It's a different camera. Anyways, according to Irakli, Zerano is a powerhouse, just like Matt said, and less technical. So his advantage over Michael is the power and strength that he has and can generate at the goal. But also Michael has this recent very tough match against Vitaly that will play the role. So slight favorite will be Zerano.
SPEAKER_03: I understand. And Irakli, do you know Ivan Portela? No. Ivan Portela is probably 10 times World Champion in lighter category. He is going to pull against Joseph Maranto.
SPEAKER_04: Matt, do you know, I'm sure you know Joseph. I know Joseph. I've seen him at the last couple of few events. Every time I've seen him, he tends to impress me more and more each time. Yeah. Where does this other fellow, what angle does he usually pull it?
SPEAKER_04: inside he goes he's an inside polar too so we know where it's going right yeah i mean yeah yeah 100 100 we're gonna have a banger right in the center of the table right so um i'm i'm not really sure i think this is gonna be uh i think this is gonna be his biggest test yet uh for sure so we'll really see where he's at obviously i'm i'm going for monroe he's
SPEAKER_03: The dude's been kicking ass, taking names. We need another North American to start making some waves in that lighter weight category. So yeah, I'm going with Josh all the way. So, okay. Since you're actually Iraqi, do you have any opinion about this? You know? Okay. Okay. Iraq. I'm sure, you know, I'll think. Yes. Yeah. And now he is pulling, pulling against Paulie.
SPEAKER_03: and 95 kilo. And you know, Paul has proved himself many times, but Arsene Kachetarian is also very serious puller, strong puller. How do you see this match, Irakli? I think it's a very good match. I think it's a very good match. I think it's a very good match.
SPEAKER_02: Well, this time it will be 60 to 40. I would say Pauline would win. He's the favorite in this one, in my opinion. But Katarzyna is good. Again, how many? 60 to 40. 60 to 40 percent. 60 to 40. Pauline is the favorite. Okay. Yeah. Okay. And Matt? Arsene, he's more of a top roller, isn't he?
SPEAKER_03: No, he goes everywhere, but he goes usually inside. You know he beat Andrei Sharkovich. Yeah, you remember he beat Andrei Sharkovich in Arlington? Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's a little heavier too, isn't he? Isn't he a bigger guy, 105 inches? He's about 100 kilos. He's about 220. He needs to make 209. So I think both Paul and him are about the same weight on their daily life. Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Uh, he was pretty impressive against Andre Sharkovich. That's for sure. Uh, he definitely, he's a lot thicker, bigger in person, as opposed to seeing him on the poster and seeing him on the table. Uh, the dude does have some mass to him. He's definitely got some strength, but, uh, inside, inside that's Paul game. I got to go with Paul, especially North American soil. There's no way Paul is going to lose this one on North American soil.
SPEAKER_04: especially when he's going to be jumping right inside with him. Paul's arm right now looks pretty, pretty freaking impressive, especially the way that he ended up pulling with David. Even though David is coming from a lighter weight category, David came up to that weight class. David's arm, as far as I'm concerned, pound for pound, one of the best hookers in the world. And the way Paul was able to handle him the way he did, cutting the weight that he did, I'm going to say Paul. Paul's 60-40 for sure.
SPEAKER_03: so okay so you agree with uh with directly you both have the same opinion yeah and i love seeing paul win so oh yeah yeah obviously no doubt and let's go let's go to morozov versus alex prudential right arm directly oh
SPEAKER_00: But he was a very, very powerful man. He was a very powerful man. But in the end, in the end, in the end, in the end, in the end, in the end, in the end, in the end, in the end,
SPEAKER_02: I think this match is very close, 50-50, maybe slight favorite Morozov. It also would come down to how well prepared Kudecha ends up. I mean, by looks, Kudecha always seems to be ready and well-trained and good shape, but performance-wise, it really is close this time, and maybe slight favorite would be Morozov. And Matt?
SPEAKER_03: How is Morozov's right arm? Because he ended up injuring it, didn't he? No, it was left arm. Oh, it was left arm? Okay. You remember when he pulled against Vitaly Laletin in Tbilisi left arm? Yeah. That's the time he injured his left arm. Right arm, I didn't hear anything recently that he was injured or something. He was going to pull against Jerry.
SPEAKER_03: And Jerry, because of some personal issues, he couldn't. So Alex Kurdeca is going to pull.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, yeah, I think I think Alex is nuts. Honestly, myself taking on two matches the way he is pulling Devin and pulling mores off. Credentials left, I believe, is definitely way better than his right. The battle that they had in the left arm impressed the hell out of me with credential with how versatile he was. Not only just doing his top role, he was driving into a hook. He was doing a press. He was all over the table.
SPEAKER_03: Whether or not he is as versatile with his right as he is with his left, I don't think so. Right arm is one way. Right arm is top roller, but right arm is better top roller than his left arm, in my opinion.
SPEAKER_04: But against the versatile, you know, he's not yet your right. And I think Morozov is a lot more versatile with his right. Morozov, we've seen him tall pro, we've seen him hook, we've seen him press, we've seen him pull in any angle on the table with the right. Very similar to how their left arm match went. I think Morozov is just as versatile with his right as he is with his left.
SPEAKER_04: um and i think i think morozov is one of the baddest dudes on the planet left and right arm uh the projectile that that guy's going is insane he's still a puppy like he's still only like 25 isn't he again like i will tell you something you know six
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, he's probably like between 25 and 30, but probably 26. He's still a fucking puppy. You know what I mean? Yeah, he's young. Yeah, he's still a fucking puppy. And the waves that that dude has made already in the super heavyweight division is absolutely insane.
SPEAKER_04: um i i love both the dudes but i honestly i gotta go with mora's off on this one i think uh i think mora's off is on a different level both his left and his right arm than majority of the super heavyweights in my eyes so i'm gonna say i'm gonna say 55 more is off 45 credential
SPEAKER_04: so just because of the versatility and the amount of brute brute strength and the longer a match goes on the more it tends to go into morozov's favor so yeah 55 45 more is off okay but super exciting match exactly kurdecha versus devon left arm oh uh
SPEAKER_02: This one is going to be definitely tough. Tough for both of them. But I still think Devon will be victorious. Devon is going to win? Yes, but not easy. It's going to be a tough match. What's the score?
SPEAKER_02: It's five rounds. I mean, best of five. I was guessing. And Matt?
SPEAKER_04: Your brother. Of course. Of course. Well, I got to go with my brother. Come on. Would you ever bet against LeVon? Fuck no. Right? Of course you would never bet against him. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's for sure. But what I want to ask you is. But honestly, honestly, my opinion, I think this is going to be, I think of everybody that there is for Devin Armwrestle,
SPEAKER_04: I believe that this is going to be his toughest challenge with his left arm. That was Devin's toughest challenge so far in this era. I think out of everybody. I think stylistically, I feel it doesn't matter who Devin pulls. I think Morozov is Devin's toughest opponent. Morozov or Devin?
SPEAKER_04: Sorry, Kredecha. I agree. I think Devin has a better chance of beating Morozov left arm than he does beating Kredecha left arm. Okay. And what does it mean?
SPEAKER_04: I think if Devin pulls us off, I know... Is he an underdog? Is he an underdog? Seriously. Objectively. Seriously. Well, anybody that's watched any of the fucking videos with the power, strength, wise, any time those two have ever gone on the table, I think you're an idiot if you think that Kordech is an underdog. I would say everybody in their right mind, doesn't matter if they're listening with their head and not their heart,
SPEAKER_04: Bredeccia is the favorite. Devin is definitely going in the underdog on this one. Stylistically, I think this is probably the hardest stylistic puller for Devin to pull with his left arm. Devin's left arm right now is on a different level than I feel it's been in the last five to 10 years. Like it's definitely on a completely different level.
SPEAKER_04: is it on credential's level i don't really know am i cheering for devin yes do i think devin's gonna win yes of course i think that was gonna win because the that he's able to pull off is absolutely insane the way that he handled the way that he handled corey's power and corey is i think corey left arm is one of the strongest arm wrestlers in the sport even kredecha had issues with corey's power no that was right there was right time yeah
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but Devin and Corey just ended up pulling left arm in Texas. No, no, I know, I know. But Kurdesha and Corey pulled right arm. I thought they pulled left too. No, Kurdesha right arm and...
SPEAKER_03: But I think Corey is one of the strongest dudes on the planet, power-wise. Kurdesha told me that after pool, he said that last time he was very dominant against Corey. This is what Kurdesha told me. I don't know. I wasn't there. Yeah, I don't believe a fucking thing he says. I will tell you something, my opinion. There are a few things, like the heights.
SPEAKER_03: of the hands, you know, the forearms, usually Devon has good advantage there. This time he's pulling against someone who is taller than him. Second thing, second thing, Kurdeca lost matches with left arm against Morozov and Danikyan, they both were, you know, like not attacking his hand, but just controlling his pronator.
SPEAKER_03: And this time there is someone that is attacking his hand, Kurdeca's hand, and his wrist and side pressure looks very good. So the height and then the side pressure Kurdeca has is just automatically making me thinking that he will go to the winning side with this start goal. And then there is the real struggle starts when Devon is open on top rolling like this.
SPEAKER_03: Whenever I saw Kurdeca against Morozov, I saw that with left arm, he was able to even press. So that is why I agree with you that I don't know who's going to win. But Kurdeca has, looks like on the paper, has necessary tools to give, to be the most dangerous opponent for Devin's left arm. And I believe he does. I believe he is the most...
SPEAKER_04: dangerous opponent for Devin out of everybody in that super heavyweight division for the left arm, I think he is probably going to be Devin's toughest challenge. In my eyes, if Devin does end up beating Kredecha, which I think he will, just because Devin's able to pull shit out of his ass when you don't think he's able to, when you think he doesn't have a chance.
SPEAKER_04: So I'm definitely going to go with Devin. I don't think it's going to be a huge, huge gap. I'm going to go with like a 51-49 spread, thinking that Devin is going to win. But if Devin does beat Crudecia, I think you need to put him in for the title shot with the left arm. Because if Devin can beat Crudecia, I don't think there's anybody on this planet that's going to be able to beat him. Daddy can beat him. Morozov beat him. Crudecia, there is Kamil.
SPEAKER_04: That match needs to happen, so we can't avoid, you know, there are some other matches. Yeah, no, but I'm saying he's on his way for another one spot. I mean, if he beat Kordesha, it will prove something really, really big. Really big. Yeah. Yeah. I think he beats Kordesha, even Vitaly. Like, get him pulling Vitaly. David, that he can. That'd be interesting, just the way that he snaps in with him. Yeah. So... Irakli. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Are you ready? Hermes said that your job in Chicago to put mask on Levan. Any response to this?
SPEAKER_00: The mission here is to tell Magida that you are going to kill Magida. The next thing is to tell Magida that you are going to kill Magida and that you are going to kill Magida.
SPEAKER_00: Well, I mean, first of all,
SPEAKER_02: what did he do like he established my first mission uh hermes established to be like a table cleaner for hermes and lewan then i said i agreed to him okay i'm gonna clean your table after hermes is gonna cry and it will be a bit wet so i will clean it off i can't do that now he's saying that i'm gonna be uh my second mission will be to put on the mask like this oxygen mask on level trust me and everybody who's watching right now
SPEAKER_02: erm is gonna lose so quickly he's gonna be in shock and after him after match interview he's gonna say i can't believe i came all this way to like be beaten in like seconds like what the hell so you are saying that leon is gonna be in six zero yes uh
SPEAKER_03: Levan said that after 4-0, Levan thinks that Hermes is going to run away and he says that you are going to go and catch him and bring him to the table. I was with Magida. I was with Magida. I was with Magida. I was with Magida. I was with Magida.
SPEAKER_02: Yes, yes, definitely. That's a correct call. I'm going to be the one who will catch Ermis running away and put him back on the table to execute the last two rounds as well because he must pull all rounds, no matter the outcome. Okay, Ioane says, Irakli, what is your favorite exercise to not get your pronation taken against strong wrists and risers?
SPEAKER_02: Your favorite method is to say that there is no pronation, there is no supination, and on top of that, there is a strong riser. This strong riser and your pronation, you can say that this is the most effective method.
SPEAKER_00: Well, I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so.
SPEAKER_02: Well, basically, to counter that specific movement, I got to do the same, but better. It would be me trying to work out my pronation and also riser lifts with my wrist straight, but the belt almost to the bones. The belt will be wrapped around this spot and do the lifts like this.
SPEAKER_03: Encourage riser and pronation against that moment. Sean Crowther says Devon has been playing a long con with Kordesha, letting him think that he has the edge when they train, knowing they will have a match eventually.
SPEAKER_03: Not sure about that because I don't think Devon liked, you know, when Kurt Eichel was pinning him, but I respect your opinion, Sean. And Matt, how do you see this match, Hermes and Tal? I hope we see something very similar to the last bout that they had.
SPEAKER_04: LaVon is on a different level from every arm wrestler on the planet right now. We all know that. But I would love nothing more than to see Ermes stand on the top of that pedestal for a little bit. So I'm rooting for Ermes. Whether or not I think he's going to be able to pull it off, I don't know. I think that LaVon has probably learned a lot from the last time he pulled Ermes.
SPEAKER_04: that it's not always about power and that he may have to work on his stamina a little bit as well. If he has just been concentrating on just power and thinks that he's just going to power through him that quick and it's not even going to come to a match of stamina in any way, then I think we could end up seeing Hermes bring the upset that we've all been hoping for. So I'm going with Hermes. I'm 50-50 on this one.
SPEAKER_04: but I'm fucking rooting for that fucking Italian all day long. Okay, okay, one second. You want Hermes to win, but your objective opinion is 50-50? Yeah, 50-50. Just based off the last one, I think I want Hermes to win. I'm cheering for Hermes. So I should say 55, I think, in my head, 55, I think LeBron is going to win.
SPEAKER_04: 45% chance that Hermes is going to win. But I want to see that gap get even tighter. And I'm cheering for Hermes on this one. It was 50-50 now, 55-45. If I ask you one more time, is it going to go 60-40? No, 55-45. The last answer, final answer. 55-45, Levon. But I want to see Hermes win. I want to see Hermes win, and I want to see Levon win.
SPEAKER_04: get a little bit of humbleness, go back to Georgia and then come back and regain the title and then run through everybody for years to come. But I want to see Hermes get it. Can you see him? Say something directly.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, it is. It is. It is. It is directly. Got to shut the level. It actually wants to say hello to you, Todd. That's fine. I don't know what's going on. I push the button. Yeah, what's happened? It's just spinning. So right now everything's just blurry. I can hear you.
SPEAKER_03: But I can't see nothing. Oh, okay, okay. Then quickly let me call again. And then let me see. Now do you see him? Now I see a tiny mat and a tiny Iraqi and what looks like a bookshelf. Uh-huh. This guy said he's going to come to America and he's going to beat you.
SPEAKER_01: Well, I mean, a lot of people come to America and try to beat Americans. I almost think we're undefeated on our own territory. The British tried. British tried, and? And the Spanish tried, and the French tried. I think we won almost. And now the Georgians will try?
SPEAKER_03: And now one little scrawny Georgian will try. Roman, just tell me exactly what Todd says.
SPEAKER_02: Yes, clearly. That's why I wanted to say that the Americans and Americans of America are different. They don't come from France, they don't come from Spain, they don't come from the United States, they all come from the same country, they all come from the same country. That means that the Georgians are in the same mode. It's the same thing with the Georgian language. There is no problem. Yes, the Georgian language will be a big problem for you in September. It will be in your head.
SPEAKER_02: Well, Todd, I hope you hear me. This tiny Georgian will become a big fucking problem in your home turf. So be ready. You put that in there. He didn't say fucking.
SPEAKER_03: Did he say fucking? You put that in there. Come on. He said different words. You don't put words in a raccoon's mouth like that. No, come on. He said huge deal. I said big fucking. Okay. This guy said he's going to come. He's going to be a big problem for you. And we will see. Most likely September. Hopefully, like in a North American event, US event, if not, somewhere else. But
SPEAKER_03: And do you mind pulling this guy? I just remind him, I'm an engineer. Solving problems is my life. So I get paid a lot more money solving problems than I do arm wrestling. Okay, so you're going to solve his problem. And are you going to charge from him as well as you do from the organization because of solving this is his personal problem?
SPEAKER_01: No, what I'm going to do, I'm going to do the 95-kilogram class a favor, and I'm going to organize like a union, and we're going to band together, and we're going to drive you rockily out of the top 10 rankings for the 95 class. You're going to have to go find another weight class to live in. Roman? Roman?
SPEAKER_02: I would translate that one.
SPEAKER_02: Because, as I said, this new problem of Iraq is also a problem of the people of Iraq. I would like to ask you, as an engineer, as a member of your company, how did you manage to solve this problem of Iraq?
SPEAKER_02: It's not as if we're going to say that our band was formed in the 90s and we're going to make a name for ourselves in the 90s. We're going to be in a different category, we're not going to be in the top 10. You're right, in the 90s there was a lot of Android.
SPEAKER_00: I have a lot of respect for Poland, but I think that 20-30% of the people who come to me say that they want to go to the US.
SPEAKER_02: What type of band are you talking about when it comes to 95kgs? I mean, who do you have? Huge respect to Paul. Obviously, when we met, everybody knows how it ended up. I almost used 30% of my power. But who can you show up even stronger than Paul to make me go on top, out of top 10 of 95kgs? Basically, there's no one.
SPEAKER_01: No, what I said I'm going to do is I'm going to organize everybody up. You know, the United Nations, like they're all organized, all the countries organized in the United Nations to solve problems. The United Nations is in America. That's what we do. I'm going to organize everybody else in the 95 class. We're all going to work together and then we will rid the 95 class of Iraq. Okay, he's basically saying that they will vote and they will kick him out from the category.
SPEAKER_03: We all train together and I will teach everybody in that class how to beat Iraq. Did you hear that part, Roman? He said he's going to teach everybody how to beat Iraq. From all over the world in the United Nations. Thank you for joining. And then we will meet in a podcast. Thank you.
SPEAKER_04: How do you know, how do you know when you're talking to an engineer? Hey,
SPEAKER_02: So, what did you say? Not in America, it's not in America, it's not in America, it's not in America, it's not in America, it's not in America, it's not in America, it's not in America, it's not in America, it's not in America,
SPEAKER_02: Well he already left but he stated that he will learn first he must learn to put his elbow on the pad and then talk and also in September Todd will be the one moving out of 95 kg.
SPEAKER_03: okay matt whenever there is a such beef between a north american and the georgian you are not natural right what do you mean like you are not like like you are taking side right of course of course okay okay of course so georgia versus the world is what it is right now it seems like
SPEAKER_03: There's nothing I like more than seeing a Georgian lose, unless it's Gennady. I like seeing Gennady win. I love watching Gennady win. Yeah. And Matt, what can he likely do that turns you off so badly that you would kick his ass in Chicago? Is there anything that he can do? No, I don't really...
SPEAKER_04: There's not much he can do that'll offend me. So not much he can do that'll offend me in any way because I've either been told way worse or had way worse done to me. So there's nothing that boy can do that's going to put any fear or...
SPEAKER_04: any type of uncertainty inside of me. But you will you will be more motivated to pull him than pulling Nugo because you said till five minutes before the event you couldn't really take him seriously. But I wasn't I honestly I wasn't I didn't I didn't think for a second I played the scenario over my head a thousand times and I didn't see for a second
SPEAKER_04: what had happened was gonna happen at all in any way um i look at iraqli and i am nervous i'm not gonna lie i'm not scared of them but i'm nervous i'm nervous about losing nobody does like losing whether i'm gonna gain something from a loss or not it's inevitable of course you're gonna gain something but i think my chances of losing are a lot greater
SPEAKER_04: in my left arm to a Rackley than what I felt my chances of losing were to Newell. So and I don't have the confidence in my left arm. So, yeah, I'm nervous. I'm nervous as fuck. There's nothing that he can say to me or do to me or portray upon me that's going to make me more nervous or more pissed off or want to beat him anymore because I already don't think I'm going to win. So it's yeah, I've worked out. The hard part is done.
SPEAKER_04: why did you take the match you know if you are thinking that way because i like challenges engen i like challenges i don't like easy wins i don't like to pull people that i think i'm just going to mop the floor of just for the sake of being able to get to w i like challenges i like
SPEAKER_04: Thinking that, yeah, if I can pull somebody and I beat them when I don't think I was going to beat them, to me, that means a lot more to me and it's way more of an accomplishment than going to the table, whipping the ass of somebody and...
SPEAKER_03: not gaining anything if this is the case then you are very motivated to be this guy yeah of course i am of course i am i would love to build to get a w over a georgian whether it's a left arm or a right arm roman lastly what does iraqi think about mass you know first 50 50 then 55 45 ms 11 uh prediction
SPEAKER_02: Now I would like to ask you two questions. What do you think about the fact that Metis started to play with Magas Tandagavshiri? It is said that from the beginning it was 52-52, then it was 52-52, then it was 52-52, then it was 52-52, then it was 52-52, then it was 52-52. What do you think about Metis' future?
SPEAKER_00: Well, he respects Matt's opinion. In his opinion, Matt has never bowled with Levan.
SPEAKER_02: I guess that's the only reason why he's saying 55 to 45. But if Matt pulls Levan right now, or at least practice with him, I'm sure tomorrow he's going to predict 100% Levan and zero chance, zero percent for Ermes. Ermes Kasparini is in the chat. Ermes says, you are a crybaby like your friends, he says. Even Levan says crybabies.
SPEAKER_02: You're going to end up crying on 21st June. What's that? Oh, he was here. Okay. Can you read this last super chat? I didn't understand exactly. Yep. So hey, Maven guys here is the username.
SPEAKER_02: Please ask Irakli if Todzilla accidentally hit him in the face with his elbow during their match. Was there any roof damage from Tod's elbow? I will translate this to Irakli. Yes, this is a great question. Irakli, if you want to answer it,
SPEAKER_02: And then, when you go to Tbilisi, when you go to Tbilisi, when you go to Tbilisi, when you go to Tbilisi, when you go to Tbilisi, when you go to Tbilisi, when you go to Tbilisi, when you go to Tbilisi,
SPEAKER_00: Well, it's not that I'm a fan, I'm just a fan of what I can do and what I can't do. If you're a sports fan, you'll find out what you can do and what you can't do. I'm not interested in that. I'm just a fan of what I can do.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, that definitely must be Tozilla's fanboy. No, obviously, he never lifted his elbow that high to hit me in the face. But I don't have any mental concussions. I just know that I'm going to beat Tozilla. No problem. Okay, guys. Matt, thank you very, very much. I know it has been two weeks. I hope your diarrhea stopped.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, it's good. They're all solid floaters. That's good. Oh, floaters too. A couple of sinkers. That's how much steak I ate that day. Exactly. What if Matt Kozman cancels the match after seeing this?
SPEAKER_00: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
SPEAKER_04: don't worry matt it's just i just end up for the training so if they are just pumped so it's not that big i was gonna say that's probably what he fucking did hey he's sitting there just before the fucking camera came on he's fucking pumping his shit up trying to look as fucking massive as possible trying to make me intimidated as he possibly can
SPEAKER_02: Like, holy fuck, I know your kind. I've worked with guys like you before, you know? So...
SPEAKER_04: No, no, I just trained yesterday, but since yesterday it's pumped, don't worry. Yeah, right. He's fucking down there jerking off underneath the table trying to keep his pump up.
SPEAKER_02: No need to translate that one. All right, all right. No, translate it. Translate it. OK, you want me to translate, yeah. OK, OK, Matt.
SPEAKER_04: we know we know what it is just by the fleet we his face went red there right we know exactly what he's thinking no need to translate anymore
SPEAKER_00: So no need, actually it doesn't matter how big my arms are, even if they are this tiny, I'm still gonna beat you because look at you. Yeah. Matt, thank you very, very much, my friend. Irakli, thank you.
SPEAKER_03: I wish you guys the best in Chicago. No injury, nothing, you know. And Roman, thank you for the translation. And thanks to everyone who has been following us.
