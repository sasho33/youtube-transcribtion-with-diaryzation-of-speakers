SPEAKER_02: Today we have a special guest. Special guest that, in my opinion, probably the only unreplaceable guy in his lane. Mr. Neil Pickup. How are you, Neil?
SPEAKER_01: I'm okay, mate. A few personal challenges at the moment with my family's health, which has been ongoing for a long time, as you know. But outside of that, yeah, I'm okay, buddy. Thank you. I'm glad that everybody's okay in the earthquake. My wife was telling me about it and it was on the news in the car earlier that there'd been a massive earthquake in Istanbul. No, it's not that massive. Nobody...
SPEAKER_02: even got injured from the earthquake except the people who get panic and jump from balcony yeah yeah but other than the other than that nobody nobody like because of the earthquake there was not even as far as i know no no major no no not not even injury you know nothing you know that's great that's really good news yeah so how how is everything how is your health
SPEAKER_01: Personally, no change for myself, really, at least not that I'm aware of. It's outside of myself that the issues are more. It's been a very strange, I want to say 18 months, 24 months, just from that perspective. I had three members of my family diagnosed with cancer in that period of time, so it was pretty...
SPEAKER_01: out of nowhere you know and uh that that's quite knocks you for six a little bit so that was um take some wrapping your head round it really does particularly when you know they're they're members of your immediate family it's it's pretty big yeah yeah of course of course i i have lost my father 22 years ago and my mom eight years ago and yeah i would i would do anything to have them here yeah
SPEAKER_01: I'd be very lucky with my mum and dad, generally. I've said it many times, they're my heroes in life, they really are. It's very bad when you see that kind of thing and you're relatively helpless about it. It's not great.
SPEAKER_01: better to stay positive and not give up and like never know you know 100 that's that's certainly the plan you know my uh yeah my understanding of it knowledge of it is minimal i'm certainly not a medical person but i know that it's um extraordinarily common you know so many people you speak to have been um
SPEAKER_01: I've experienced it at some level, a member of the family, somebody they're very close to. It's a weird thing. So yeah.
SPEAKER_01: uh we'll we'll have to we'll have to see what happens but from an arm wrestling perspective we remain on track mate i'm looking forward to uh king of the stable 14 the card you've put together is typically unbelievable um some i mean you know now and again you get matches that really tweak you at the last event i'm kind of a freak like that because i'm a little bit of a purist but at the last event even though you had uh devon on there which
SPEAKER_01: without doubt, the biggest draw in the sport, you know, for most people coming into the sport and in the span of the last
SPEAKER_01: I want to say since COVID, so what's that, like three, four years? I think Devon has done an enormous amount within arm wrestling, outside of arm wrestling, to raise the level of the sport to the general public, to the people who aren't necessarily hardcore fans of the sport. For someone like me, that is like you, purist, absolute hardcore fan, my favourite match on that card
SPEAKER_01: i think was the best match on that card and it was uh mindigas teresatis janis um i've wanted to see that much so many times i'll be honest with you and i could watch it every week if you rerun that match every week do you do you realize that um why the cards over here
SPEAKER_02: a bit better than the North American. It is all about visa issues, travel, huge amount of challenges around that. But still, it was good cards. The card that I prepared for June, just wait and then see.
SPEAKER_02: Mate, I don't think there's any apologies ever to be made on that. I don't do an apology, but I just explain that there is a limitation. When it is in Istanbul, it is open buffet. Everyone can travel. But when it is in US, then look at the rankings. The majority of the rankings are not from North America at the top. You understand? Because we need to be realistic when you say,
SPEAKER_01: west we're talking about two or three countries with brazil when you say yes you're talking about 30 countries the cultural approach to the sport mate whenever you get you can see it in all sports i mean strongman's a really good example because
SPEAKER_01: the biggest strongman shows in the world right now are without question Giants Live in the UK. And if you look at the amount of talent coming out of the UK at world level, I mean, the reigning world's strongest man is from Scotland. Many of the guys that are competing at the world's strongest man are UK. And if you look at
SPEAKER_01: representative to scale of country, population and various other things. It's disproportionately high, the number of Brits that have won world's strongest man. Now, there's all kinds of, you know, I've watched lots of studies and lots of channels that have gone into that the old superhuman super strong thing was very much focused around that little TV programme. But ultimately, a lot of it also comes down to if you are
SPEAKER_01: if you have a nucleus a hotbed of talent within a country usually the people with the immediate periphery of that talent will will will skyrocket we've seen many examples in our sport and it's funny for me i mean a lot of people that one of the things that always makes me laugh is people when i see fans always really complimentary which is great and i love meeting the fans of these shows but genuinely a lot of the new fans think i'm just a commentator or um an mc
SPEAKER_01: They don't appreciate that I spent more than 20, well, more than 30 years of my life as an athlete at world level. So I'm a purist. I love the sport. If I went to the world championships and I wasn't there commentating, emceeing, or doing anything else, I can sit from...
SPEAKER_01: 9 a.m. to the close of the show every day through the Masters, through the Juniors. I don't care. And I'm good. I still do that. I still go. I'm good to go, mate. I still go.
SPEAKER_01: yeah every year yeah i'm technical director of the turkish team and yes i got europeans in the walls and it's great because you see the talent the emerging talent you know i mean your job as a matchmaker one of the things that you need to do the job as exceptionally as you're able to do it is to have that's not why i go
SPEAKER_01: From inside and from visually. To be able to see the different levels, the different technical elements within there. It's interesting. That kind of thing is very, very important. If you don't appreciate that, you can't match Makewell.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, that's not why I go. I'm technical director, so I go with the Turkish team while there. I also watch, but I can watch and understand everything from YouTube videos as well. You know, that is like we understand everything. We don't need to be in person there, but I have to be as an official. And like since 1993, yeah. And yeah, yeah, yeah. People, people like they also think I'm organizer than the new guys.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, you're a promoter. Yeah, they think I'm a promoter. But, yeah, like I still don't consider myself as a promoter. Probably I have been organizing the best events in the world, but I have done, I have been involved with other things that, you know, I think that, you know, to me at least, you know, was more important than, you know,
SPEAKER_02: what I do right now. You're the most obsessed athlete I've ever seen. Did you know that I have done all the right arm final matches in Asian Championship 2015, I guess. The Asian Championship Continental. I was the head referee. I did as a rep. I have trained more than 10 world and European champions as a trainer as well. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: what we're talking about a moment ago you know what we talked about a moment ago where i said if you have a nucleus of talent in an area you will often see that if you looked at you know lorenzo villar in spain there was a number of guys came through and guinito uh jaime jose san jamal they get the guys that were over there that were excellent people came from them if you look at yana samolins in latvia and others also
SPEAKER_01: There was a spawning of people there. Myself in the UK when I was very active. If you look at Svetlana Gashevsky in Bulgaria, there were various people, hotbeds of talent. I always remember a friend of mine, Robert Redden,
SPEAKER_01: And a very good arm wrestler, exceptional puller back in the day. And at one time, I mean, Craig Tuye started with Redden. He was one of Robert Redden's boys. And at the time, there was an absolute...
SPEAKER_01: hotbed of talent around that area you know because of the fact that they had roads training there redden touye and others you know all in lucas and various others it was awesome and you often see that you know look at the cheers to you team that robert baxter john brazink bobby brown you know at one time you had obviously todd ziller there bongard who can forget the cowboy
SPEAKER_02: that's what i'm talking about there is there is a message big growth goals neil okay big up big ups on the camera improvement i always look forward to this episode and do you have an update on how john's back surgery went i wrote him a message i don't know probably he had countless messages i don't know if he's still in pain or anything but i didn't hear anything back
SPEAKER_02: One guy wrote here a while ago, I think Benji deleted, he said, Engin, you are a Vitaly hater, you want Michael to win. Like, I don't understand what I am. Hey, that's a great match, I can tell you. It's a very, very interesting match. Very interesting is the right word. Some people say that I support East, and now this guy says I support West, and yeah, that's just...
SPEAKER_02: Anyway, so let's start with the predictions. By the way, generally you said you found it high-level cards, right? Oh my God.
SPEAKER_01: I think it's beyond contestation for anybody who knows the sport of arm wrestling. It's the highest level of elite arm wrestling competition that the world has ever seen without any question. If you're looking for elite level competition in the sport of arm wrestling, it is without any reasonable doubt.
SPEAKER_02: the highest consistent level of supermatch competition that the sport has ever seen, particularly in the Super Heavyweight division. We should thank you about this, you and probably also Ahsen and Igor, that
SPEAKER_02: You guys were kind of the starters of the Supermatch. I was the originator of the Supermatch, without any question. In the past, it was all about the tournament, and then it became this way. So, let's start. Let's start. Zurab and Georgy Tautiev. Zurab Tauberize versus Georgy Tautiev.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, talk about clash of styles right out of the gate, you know? You've got... Firstly, I'm a huge fan of both these guys for very different reasons. Very different reasons. In Zurab Tabariza, you've got a real warrior, a bit of a throwback. He's the epitome of Georgia in many ways. Real warrior. Guy that always steps up, you know?
SPEAKER_01: um wants to pull everyone i mean you look at that guy's career in east versus west he prior to the arm break good lord that man was in some battles i mean the rombath match yeah it was probably one one of the best super matches ever mega absolutely mega mega match his match with john was awesome you know the guy is entertaining pull from anywhere all gears forward
SPEAKER_01: and very much about the top-end strength. His results at other competitions at that time were peaking. He was testing himself everywhere and anywhere. Probably overdid it, actually. Probably competed a little too much. And it cost him. And unfortunately, he was badly injured. Now, his opponent is an outlier. Absolute outlier. As you know, he's always been one of my favourite arm wrestlers.
SPEAKER_01: Because he's a technician. And I love the boxers. I love the guy that's technically... I mean, you know, Mendes Teresaitis, Giannis Amelins, Svetan. All the guys that are technically proficient and have arm wrestled in that way are guys that I have a great deal of respect for, time for, and I've always had a massive amount of admiration. And in Talty F, you've got...
SPEAKER_01: The old saying, you're a one-trick pony. And yes, he is a one-trick pony. But it is a hell of a trick. The guy is built for what he does.
SPEAKER_01: He's a purist top roller who is built to top roll in a very, very unique manner. And he's putting on size, he's putting on weight and growing into his frame a little. And I always think that's exciting. We've seen the development of Vitaly Leletin from doing the same thing. And I love this matchup. I'm always concerned for Zurab because of the...
SPEAKER_01: magnitude of that injury you know it was and this is a guy who might blast his wrist wide open in a strap and jump all over him yeah it's a bravery check i'm sure his arms fully healed i'm sure he's good but there's a lot of haunting goes on in your mind after i'd had my my arm break and the damage i this whole it haunts you it messes with you messes with your head uh it's hard to get over that it's hard to get to blow those cobwebs away so
SPEAKER_01: That's an interesting thing. I believe that both guys have things in their favour. I think Taltiev, the pressure gauge has gone through the roof because he came in with an extraordinarily tough ask and his wrist was collapsed. He was beaten by a guy who really is ever improving.
SPEAKER_01: I don't think he should put too much pressure on himself because of that result. The guy he's pulling now, whilst he remains a massive challenge, it's a very different challenge and it's actually the type of challenge I think he's going to be a lot more comfortable with technically. And I do give him a slight edge. So I think Taltiev, 55-45 favourite for me. Don't be surprised if I'm wrong on Zurab.
SPEAKER_01: manages to to close him down zurab has been pulling against tall ranger guys all his life and he's found a way to beat them so there's no my only question around that really is the fact that i wonder how he is mentally after the break i don't know i don't know they they i had them uh on podcast recently they were two true yeah
SPEAKER_01: against each other from the past events yeah that's that was what well i i i knew that i was aware of those matches um but zurab in his favor is that he's much more experienced in east versus west and i hope he is aware and if he is this will give him the advantage that he's got like nothing to prove you know um often you find that with guys though that even when they have nothing to prove
SPEAKER_01: it's the biggest thing to prove it this to themselves and you find that then i mean jesus you're the biggest example of that maybe we've ever seen i mean you've you've won everything there is to win 10 times over but you judge yourself you always want to go again you always question could i have beaten samusha in his prime you're you're that guy and i'm a little that guy and and everybody that competes is a little that guy and it's just where zurab tabarizzi is on that spectrum
SPEAKER_02: if he can relax a little and just think, yeah, you know, this is another day at the office. I've been here many times before. Just relax. I think there will be more pressure on Tautiev. Ryan Bull Bellinger says, the two goats love you all. Thank you very much, my friend. This guy is very strong guy. This guy is very strong guy. Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I mean, I expected his match with Rey to be closer, but he was just too much. I also expected it to be closer. Ryan was mega. Very, very powerful. Yeah. Okay, now we have Petro Marharin versus Lachlan Adair. Now, this is a really... This is a better match than people might expect. And I'll tell you why I believe that.
SPEAKER_01: So everyone has their lane. There's so many guys knocking around. All you guys all over the world will know that guy in the gym. We've got one in England whose name is Lee Webber, Diesel Lee Webber. And if Webber gets you in his spot, he's world class. He may have frailty elsewhere, but in that spot, man's a bad guy. Now, when you see Lachlan Adair beaten, it tends to be when he's taken out of his lane.
SPEAKER_01: Or he's out-arm wrestled. Too much explosivity. Too much athleticism. He doesn't do well off the B-side. He's not a good B-side arm wrestler. I'm a big fan of Lachlan Adair because mentally, he's very much in the right place. He's got the right head for the game. And he's very much a student of the sport.
SPEAKER_01: With Maharent, he's pulling a guy who is unbelievably strong, probably the stronger of the two, in my opinion. In fact, there is an argument there that he may be the strongest in the division, period. There is an argument that that could be the case. Talking about maybe the strongest?
SPEAKER_01: In my opinion, yes. Yes. Let me articulate what I'm talking about, which was what I was going on to do there. I'm talking about diesel power, top end diesel power.
SPEAKER_01: leverage takes that away but it doesn't in this situation because both of these men haven't got a significant lever advantage over the other does it make sense so if you look at someone like petrenko petrenko is a guy who again you could say may have best in class might be the strongest possible it's possible if you were able to measure what he can get down when he's in his lane and that's the thing when he's in his lane
SPEAKER_02: he may be the strongest but he lacks leverage and that is critical here it will be critical when zurab pulls against tautia if it comes down to power there's no competition a lot of people are in their lane like maybe the strongest if mindagas can top roll yannis or someone he is the strongest if arthur can hook he is the strongest so that's what i try to understand if you are talking about
SPEAKER_01: absolute best or are you talking about like a powerful guy? I'm talking about the amount of power, just force generated in your lane when you're in your perfect position. Forget levers, forget the other elements. Now, the interesting thing is here that Lachlan has often talked about the fact that he believes he's got unbelievable strength. I remember Ryan Bowen used to always talk about the fact that he believed that Lachlan had unbelievable strength.
SPEAKER_01: Wasn't the best arm wrestler, but had unbelievable strength. And since then, obviously, it's a much better version of Lachlan. Now, I think with Maharent, Lachlan will have a slight speed advantage. I actually think he'll initiate quicker, as he did with Kostadinov. I believe that Kostadinov and Lachlan...
SPEAKER_01: was a really good indication of how good this match could be i think this could be a battle because i love that match costadinoff and lotham was a great match and i think this is going to be slower if anything then i'm not sure about slower i i don't remember like i mean marcarin is has so strong risk that when the match starts he boom he already
SPEAKER_01: You know, he already takes to his winning side. But I think he's so confident in his arm, he will allow Lachlan to hit it. I'm not sure. We'll see. We will see. I think Lachlan's going to be able to accelerate into his strength pretty good here. Is he strong enough? Is he experienced enough? I guess we find out. In my opinion, he's an underdog. I think Maharin starts, in my opinion, as a 60-40 favourite.
SPEAKER_02: No, but still Lachlan is there, you know. Because I will tell you something, if Marharin was pulling against a pure top roller, then I would say that he doesn't have...
SPEAKER_01: from my chance. Well, the reason I've got him picked as a favourite is exactly what you talked about a moment ago. I couldn't agree more. I think Maharin's wrist is stronger and he's bigger. His structure is bigger. He is a... Let's talk about the build of the athlete. Lachlan is not a big man, particularly. But he has an enormous amount of muscle stacked on a smaller frame. Maharin's
SPEAKER_01: doesn't maybe look so physically impressive in terms of the lean muscle mass but the man is like a giant farrier like a giant blacksmith he just is just a big thick set mother fluffer and that's the thing you know there are some dudes that you stand next to
SPEAKER_01: And Maharent is one of those guys. You know like Ziranov is. You stand next to Ziranov and you're like, holy shit. You know, he's just structurally thick set, dude. Maharent's kind of got a little bit of that about him. He's got that structural...
SPEAKER_02: thick set frame. Looks like Shrek. Just a big, powerful looking dude. So you are saying 60%? 60% to 40%? I've got 60-40 Mahalint. Yeah. Okay. By the way, guys already started talking about Michael Togo and Vitaly on the chat, but we will go to that as the latest one. Yeah, we've got so many great matches on this card. And tomorrow, Michael and
SPEAKER_02: Lalletin will be my guest on this channel, yeah. Very interesting. Michael's been quite cagey of late. He's... Yeah. Yeah, he's not going to... He doesn't talk a great deal. He's very respectful, but the guy is not lacking confidence. No, no, no, no, no. I mean, if you know the guy, I mean, you know that he's a warrior. He would never go to a match, you know. Okay, let's go to...
SPEAKER_02: uh nugo shikaze versus matt mask dude i mean dude what what am i what a match that is i love this match this is this is probably my favorite match can i ask you something do you think that when they are on the stage and trying to
SPEAKER_01: get their grip, and they are coming to the table, if the camera would turn to the crowd, do you think that many of them would have a smile on their face? Mate, this is probably my favourite match on the card. Listen, in any sport, you've got guys that, for whatever reason, you just want to watch.
SPEAKER_01: Both of these men have that in spades. Both of these men are incredibly endearing dudes.
SPEAKER_01: whenever you watch matt mask whenever matt mask is firing whenever matt mask is on when he's really buzzing i mean no better example than texas you know in arlington number one matt mask is a genuinely lovely guy i mean that bloke is i really i know he's raw and he's rough and he's been oh i love matt mask as a guy forget arm wrestling
SPEAKER_01: Matt's the type of guy I just really like him as a bloke, as a person. Very, very good lad. Really solid, stout fella. Massive amount of time for Matt Mask. I couldn't be a bigger fan of the Wild Horse if I tried. As an arm wrestler, he's one of the most exciting, visceral, engaging arm wrestlers that has ever been.
SPEAKER_01: His frame is huge. He's got an aura about him. He walks into a room and he's bristling. He's like a pissed off honey badger. I mean, he's just absolutely on it. And when he's firing, it is an incredible draw. Nobody can sleep on that guy. Nobody. He's got serious abilities. Now, Nugo Shikaze has...
SPEAKER_01: Opposite set of spectrum visuals. You look at him. Pretty short. Pretty unassuming looking guy. Looks kind of wrongly built. How he's put together. Sort of hunched over. Twitching away. But that dude draws you in. You cannot. You can't.
SPEAKER_01: not be a fan of that guy i challenge anybody to go and watch a new goshikaze match live and not come away and want to buy a new goshikaze t-shirt that dude is awesome the i mean he's awesome when you're at east versus west events you can hear when he comes on all of the georgian team ignite all of them he's like somehow he's like this little power source for georgia
SPEAKER_01: And when he comes on, he supercharges the whole goddamn team. If you were the coach of Team Georgia, you would always put Nugo Shikadze first. Put him out first because I don't care whether he wins. He'll still ignite everyone, twitching and ticking like a mother. And you can't not love him. He's frigging awesome.
SPEAKER_01: absolute do not know him as a person don't speak georgian and he doesn't speak english and i can't tell you what he's like as a guy but in my mind he's awesome i'm a massive fan of that twitching little bastard and i think he's ace and i think this match can go either way because shakadze is so strong
SPEAKER_01: In positions, he shouldn't be. And my God, he's strong. I mean, he is acid powerful and aggressive. Angry bastard. A lot like yourself. Might be your brother. Not sure. So, who's winning? Dude, I have no idea. I...
SPEAKER_02: This is the 50th. I mean, this is... I can see both guys have lanes. Nugo, if he can hang on to the centre, maybe he can shut down. Can you say this way? If Nugo has his wrist after the goal, he has more chance. Yes. But there is a possibility that Matt will take the risk. And in such case, Nugo believes that even if his wrist goes, he's going to win that way. I'm not sure about that one. If his wrist goes, I think Matt wins.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I mean, he needs to be a really shoulder pressure specialist to do that to Matt. Yeah, Matt is. I mean, Nugo's got great pronation and he's got massive back pressure, but Matt is so venomous. And right now, I think Matt's in a very good place
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but both are great. I think the match right now is in his best shape. That's what I believe. As I guess, he looks very healthy. I don't know. He looks different, you know. I don't exactly know the reason, but he looks healthy. He looks... I don't know. He looks...
SPEAKER_01: maybe even happier more positive definitely that he looks more relaxed yeah he looks into his arm wrestling um he's shown up at events you know his daughter's work shows this looks in a really good spot he was there with his lady at the last show he looked in great just in great spirits really enjoying his arm wrestling obviously i've got you know many years of friendship with matt under my belt i know him inside out and i'm team matt i want matt to win um
SPEAKER_01: that's no disrespect to nugo shikazi love the kids love him okay and will says looking forward to seeing both of you in istanbul thank you my friend hope to see you and yeah i just want to address a comment that was in the in the chat there what did they say um from uh i want to say it's uh exact
SPEAKER_01: Oh, exact. Neil, Nugo has even more massive side pressure than back pressure. That's his main strength. I know that he's got massive side pressure, mate. He needs to have when your arm's that long. But the issue that you've got is Matt has unbelievable hand strength and massive aggression. So when Matt is hitting back, if he can find his position, Matt will palm Nugo up.
SPEAKER_01: because the height advantage that Matt has got is way above anybody that Nugo has faced in East versus West right now. But some people think that it's a disadvantage. Neil, some people think it's a disadvantage when you're pulling a short guy because you have to, you know, you know.
SPEAKER_01: It can be. It can be. But if Matt gets his hit and blasts the wrist back, I believe that Matt will palm him up. And your side pressure is, or Nugo's side pressure and most people's side pressure, tends to be massively diminished when they palm up. Josh Cook says, Hey Neil and Engin, hope you all are well. So when are we going to see Neil pick up versus Travis Bajans?
SPEAKER_02: Since both of you have agreed to it, heal up soon, brother. If I'm healed up, I'll do it tomorrow. Yeah, and no one is special. Hi, Engin. We hope to see Wallace having a super match with a strong European soon. He is looking impressive. Yes, he has won the qualification event and I plan to set him a match for the June event in the US.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, so let's go. You were there, so this is very easy to talk with you about these matches, predictions, you know, the athletes from East and West. And Jocelyn versus Egle. Wow. Like, okay, I will tell you what I think. I think Jocelyn is very, very stronger. Very stronger. But I still think that she...
SPEAKER_02: To me, I consider her still new in the sport. Absolutely. But this is not a negative thing. When you are new in the sport, it only means that you have a lot of room to improve. That's a good thing, yeah. And when you are still new and you're winning against Sara, it just shows your potential. But now when we are talking about Egle, we are talking...
SPEAKER_02: a different level than Sara. A higher level. But also Jocelyn was like, especially before round three, she looked dominant. And then round three was kind of difficult. I think in the first start, it was because Sara jumped into hook, but Egle is not that poor. Egle is outside puller, but when
SPEAKER_01: so how do you see match in shorts uh very much like you've just described i think jocelyn is uh brisson is in a great position because she can't really lose in my opinion i mean i know she can in her in her mind but she can't she can't lose she's she's fast-tracked to the top of the sport in the ladies and she may be good enough to to win it all she's hugely powerful
SPEAKER_01: um she's a very very strong lady and she's very athletic girl you can see she moves really well she's gonna be fire she's very new to the sport um she's pulling a girl who's got really big levers very very big frame massive amount of experience and if you remember the match with uh sarah
SPEAKER_01: And Egle, there was the round where she attacked and then you heard her go, oh, wow. You know, this is a different level. But the interesting thing is here that we haven't seen just Brisson's level. We don't know where it really is. Who is Egle? Egle? No, we know Egle. Brisson. We don't know where Brisson's level is. She hasn't got out of second gear. That match over there,
SPEAKER_01: She was very, very comfortable. Very, very comfortable. So it didn't show you anything? Yeah, you saw some stuff. You saw that she has weaknesses in her game. I spoke to her after it, actually, and I said that. But I do believe that we don't know how... I've not seen her scratching right now. I've not seen how much more she had. She's going to be tested more. There's no doubt about that.
SPEAKER_01: but I do believe that we've not... It's the tip of the iceberg. And I also believe she's on a fast track. I think she's progressing like hell. She's finding her feet. And it's very exciting to see girls like that come into the sport. Yeah, yeah. To see her develop. Very exciting.
SPEAKER_01: I'm really looking forward to following Joss. I think she's a lovely girl as well. When you speak to her, she's a great girl. She's very, very hungry to succeed. And hopefully she comes to Istanbul with no pressure. I see her as an underdog.
SPEAKER_01: That'll piss Jocelyn off because she's a proud girl. I hope it does. And I hope she brings it. And you never know. I wouldn't be surprised if she won. It wouldn't be like, no way, Jocelyn Brisson won. Wouldn't surprise me. Wouldn't surprise me at all. I haven't seen exactly how good she is. It is testament to how bloody strong she is that she did what she did with Sarah, who was in condition. And...
SPEAKER_01: the fact that she's just about to go into a match with egg levite who is one of the most dominant female arm wrestlers that there's ever been and i'm not sure that that that brisson will lose i think jocelyn's got a real shot got a real shot yeah i mean i also um about the underdog you said that it would piss her off used to think that she's underdog oh yeah i mean i will tell you something being underdog it really
SPEAKER_01: takes all the pressure away from you that's the that's the plan in a way because she's yeah i want to see jocelyn succeed not this is just an arm wrestling match i'm talking about in the sport one match irrelevant you know both these girls are i don't have a favorite in terms of the girls they're both lovely girls i know very well she's a lovely girl i know jocelyn less well seems a great kid is one of female gods there are a few of them in my book at least
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, there are a few of them. One of the most limiting factors for her is inactivity. But do you know what? When she lost against Gabriela, and then when I knocked her door for another super match, I said, have you been training? She said, I never stopped training. I have a match or not, I never stopped training. She said,
SPEAKER_02: She's always training. That is good. Training is training. Competition is a different thing. Inactivity is real. And ring rust is real. Someone like Egle. Listen. We saw Egle. European Championships and World Champions twice a year. She never had the competition. She was just coming and doing this and going. Twelve years ago,
SPEAKER_02: When I organized an event here, when John and Krasimir pulled, and in the same event Egle and Sara pulled again, and we did a press conference, and I asked her how many world titles she had. And she said she stopped counting long time ago. Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: yeah yeah yeah so she has probably more than 20 world titles her limiting factors yeah egla's limiting factors is inactivity not by choice it's just she doesn't have but there is nothing i'm telling you she was inactive from between gabriella and the sarah match she came and you saw the match with sarah
SPEAKER_02: oh yeah she even went to inside and wait you know do you not think she'd be better if there was a super deep competitive class in the ladies it doesn't mean that this girl has been doing this way for many years already so i don't think there's any anything any any problem with that anyway so the problem about the activity for the plus 80 kilo
SPEAKER_02: uh ladies is that there are only handful less fingers on my hand yeah yeah so you you need to do a lot of rematch there because because yeah there is barbara is here for the girls you know what i mean they're not barbara you're able to progress if the field is deep neil barbara is here and the gabrielle is right here and and then we have eggly here and then we have sarah here so like
SPEAKER_02: Gabriela was too much for Egle. Barbara was better than that. And then Egle was too much for Sara. And they already pulled against each other. So it doesn't make sense to say so many times, understand? Barbara and Gabriela already pulled twice, both times Barbara won. And then Barbara dominated Egle.
SPEAKER_02: So there is no match. Maybe Egle versus Gabriela again can make sense. And Sara was
SPEAKER_01: not their level it was it was just that they were but now jocelyn getting involved is making things more exciting yeah definitely and i'd like to see another 30 and if you did see another 30 and they come as the sport keeps growing and all their girls come from other sports in my opinion all these girls will get better all of them because they become more active
SPEAKER_01: Iron sharpens iron and desire sharpens iron. If you have got a situation where you're going into exciting matches all the time, you are pushed on. When the bar rises, the athletes rise to the bar.
SPEAKER_01: And it's always happened in all sports. I just want to address JP Winters in the comments because I've had this before. So there's a cultural thing on descriptors around women. It says they are women, not girls. Well, they are girls and women. They are both. Listen, I interview strong women all the time in competition. And when the girls themselves are on the mic, mate,
SPEAKER_01: This is the actual athletes. They talk about the other girls. They say, da-da-da-da, and the other girls. So they describe themselves as girls. Nobody's being inappropriate here, brother. No. They are girls and they are women. Yeah. But the other point, and I will go to the next match. These girls are training. And they have been training. And they were going European and world. And their match was like this.
SPEAKER_02: So the training partners, guys, were tougher than their competition. Yes. So what I'm just saying is that
SPEAKER_01: What Egle is doing right now, I don't think she's inactive. What she's doing, she's still training. No, I think we're on a different page a little bit, mate. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's my inability to articulate it to some extent. What I'm saying is that if we had... Unfortunately, we don't have it. But if we have, and as the sport grows, more Jocelyn Brisson's coming. More girls like that. Whenever you describe this, you describe it as inactivity.
SPEAKER_02: her this is saying for all other girls in the category that that is yes her problem so whenever you say that her disadvantage so it sounds something special about her not not for the category but the category generally yes there has that problem they don't have all these girls yeah offer JP all these women are limited
SPEAKER_01: by inactivity due to the fact that there simply are not that many elite ladies. You could say the same for many of the super heavyweight men.
SPEAKER_01: And one of the problems for someone like a Brian Shaw, who is lucky, or a Levan, who can he go out and train with regularly? It's very, very difficult once you get to that ultra elite level. When you get to the best in the world in your country, if you're at world class, I know there was times in my career where, honestly, in the UK,
SPEAKER_01: would travel internationally to do that because it's easy. And it's always a problem when you get to a certain level. It's tough. The climb is easier than hanging on. It really is. One second. Okay, let's go to the next one. One second. The next is
SPEAKER_02: Georgi Svetkov versus David Dadikian. But I heard something yesterday. It was very surprising. I heard from someone who is close to Denis Siplenko that Denis Siplenko told this person that David Dadikian right now is 130 kilos. Wow. 130 kilos.
SPEAKER_02: And you know what? I'm not super surprised because about two months ago when I was discussing with David Dadikian about his next match and he told me, Engin, eventually I want to pull Vitaly Ladezin. Yeah, this is what he said. And people, I talked with some people and they think that
SPEAKER_02: daddy kian has potential to become number one in the open category with left hand i think it's hard to disagree with that isn't it i mean there is a possibility for sure i mean there is a possibility daddy kian is an unbelievably strong man unbelievably strong man he's a he's an athlete isn't he i mean you look at the guy he looks like a physical specimen
SPEAKER_01: You know, he's not the biggest frame in the world. That's one of the problems that he has. In fact, he's so strong, he pulls his body apart on occasion. But in terms of Dadakan's power, as a strength athlete, the man is phenomenal. He's got great aggressive characteristics. I always love that. I'm a big fan of aggressive arm wrestlers, and he's definitely that. He's got that ironclad edge about him.
SPEAKER_01: The man is incredibly strong. It's hard to deny that he's got huge potential.
SPEAKER_01: he is his match uh with morozov you know he was dominating i know that maybe not the morozov that that we saw recently but he was dominating at that time until the midway point we just saw a very very impressive performance uh against alex uh who's no bum on the left arm so without doubt david dada kian is really really strong um
SPEAKER_01: He's going to be taken very seriously. I'm a huge fan of Georgi Shvetkov, one of my favourite arm wrestlers in the world. As a guy, lovely, warm, endearing individual. In my opinion, not as dominant on his left arm as he is on his right. Did you know that his left arm used to be even maybe a little bit better? Yeah, but I don't think now.
SPEAKER_02: Maybe not now, but I think it's coming back. The reason that it stayed behind was the injury some years ago. There was an injury, but this guy has a win against Levan with left arm in 2015 Europeans. I want to ask you something. Whenever you look at David Dadikian in person, like his arms, from forearm to upper arm, does it
SPEAKER_01: like, take your attention and you go like, what the fuck, you know, like, what is this? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, the man is a physical specimen, mate. Yeah. You know, you get guys in any sport, they're a little bit outlier. You know, I always remember we used to, I used to play football with a guy. His name was Alan Palmer. And Alan Palmer, everyone, everyone we'd go, he played, this guy played on the left of midfield for us. And every single team we played against,
SPEAKER_01: you would see him look at Alan Palmer and they'd check his legs out and they'd be like, what the fuck? All you thought was, I hope this guy's clean. I hope he does not jump into tackles. Because his legs were murderously massive. They were disproportionate on the man. He looked like he could kick a wall down. Like frigging Tong Po. He looked frightening as hell. Neil, what do you think that we will see if the mannequin is really 130 kilos, that we will see something even more weird?
SPEAKER_02: know and some people comes up oh that he can oh prudnik beat him like listen we are not talking about 105 kilos that he can no we are talking about that it's like different time they are different you know so um so who is winning that match i'm gonna go with a very very very narrow edge to georgie so georgia has more chance
SPEAKER_02: than David. Very narrow edge to Giorgi. Very narrow. I will ask you something. Do you agree that Kurdeca with left arm is more confident with his right arm? So right arm, he is more top of specialist. With left arm, he's just more like, you know, going more like side and that. So he is not really risk-taking specialist. And that also gave advantage to David Dadikian to
SPEAKER_02: use his wrist. If you remember, even a lighter Morozov was able to hook Kurdeca in round one without the strap. So what I just tried to tell you, that even a bigger version of Morozov had no chance to hook Vitaly. That's why he made all his game plan to outside. The only reason that I'm going with Georgie is because he's brilliant at taking people's hand and wrist? Yeah, yeah, that's exactly what I'm saying.
SPEAKER_02: Stronger maybe with the wrist and side pressure and everything. But he is not with left arm. He's not really specialist. So, while Georgie's all game plan is... Single track and he's going to take your hand. Yeah, yeah. So, what I'm just saying, I'm not saying... And that again is not a natural super heavyweight. He's a smaller man. So, he's got to work very hard. Five round match, yeah? Yeah, best of five, yeah. So, he's got to work very hard three times.
SPEAKER_01: to get the brakes on Georgie and to get him B-side and to finish him without taxing his hand and wrist. Now, if he does that, if he comes in weighing 130 kilos, I can't comment on how strong that guy is because I've never seen that guy. That guy could come in and be just otherworldly strong and blow through Georgie.
SPEAKER_01: But I believe that Georgie will diligently work the living daylights out of Dadakan's arm. Dadakan is without question stronger, in my opinion. I think that Georgie is more committed right now to arm wrestling in a number of respects than he's ever been. And I think, as you say, his left is improving. He told me his left is improving. And I believe that he will squeak victory. It will be really close.
SPEAKER_01: I think that he's got one shot and he's very good at doing it. And I think he's a naturally much bigger man. And I think it may be taxing for David's hand and wrist over the duration. Maybe wrong. We will see. Going 45-55 in favour of Svetkov. Okay. Kamil Jablonski, Giorgi Di Zerano.
SPEAKER_01: I'm curious about your opinion about this match. So, this is left arm, yeah? Yes. Yeah. I've got Jablonski. Yeah, I've got Jablonski. I may be biased here, but I rate Kamil Jablonski astronomically highly.
SPEAKER_02: And I think he's getting better and better and better. And do not be surprised if in a couple of years that's the overall champion of the world on the left arm. I mean, listen, like he missed by this margin, you know, in Dubai. Dude is strong as frig. And he's attitudinally exceptional. But a lot of people think that, like, we haven't seen Kamil in a deep hook.
SPEAKER_02: And I'm not sure we will hear. No, I know. We are not sure. But what if? If that happens, Arnav is probably stronger. It depends where the match stops, right? Like here, some people think that if Kamil cannot flop his chance, but he may be going this and still pressing. Do you remember one round that Gennady
SPEAKER_02: try to go inside and Jerry still press him that way. So it just doesn't mean that they cannot press, you know, so. I think there's a great chance that that happens, mate. Yeah. So what I just say that if Georgie, I don't know, catches Kamil at the center before Kamil can put all his body and then he controls Kamil's pronator,
SPEAKER_02: then I think Georgi has a good chance to win. Yes. But if somehow Georgi is on bicep and Kamil is on his, I don't know if he can lift Kamil's press. I don't know. We will see. I've got 60-40 in favour of Kamil Jablonski. Yeah, okay. And I may be biased. I'm a huge fan of Kamil. I think Kamil's a bad... I will tell you something. Kamil and his family is...
SPEAKER_02: great for arm wrestling. Kamil and his family, Kamil, his wife, and you see his daughter is also arm wrestling. You see their family, how they are supporting each other, how they are promoting arm wrestling non-stop. I think that the Jablonski family is very good for sport arm wrestling. I'm a massive fan of the Golden Dragon and his crew. I think they're frigging iron.
SPEAKER_01: And I believe that Jablonski wins that match impressively. And do you know that he has a hard job? Yeah, he works very late. Poland is a country I've experienced unbelievable hardship. Many of the guys that I know, I have a lot of friends from Poland. I know a lot of very good dudes from Poland. One thing they all have in common, the Polish people are...
SPEAKER_02: very hardy grafting straight people and um yeah i think he is a very good example of that he typifies that yeah he works all day and his arm wrestling he works all day very tough he goes late to home and then he does all kind of lips and everything he films them they edit them i don't know who's editing and then he puts on social media he always have
SPEAKER_02: has time for uh promoting armors yes yeah obsessed mate he's obsessed yeah and he's getting more confident and uh yeah I think I think that Camille is uh don't sleep on that guy yeah yeah yeah and he deserves it you know anyway so let's go it's getting like I don't know more and more exciting
SPEAKER_01: Pauline versus David Samusha, 95 kilo. Excuse me. They don't really get much better than that, do they? That's a match. I mean, they don't get much better than that. If you're looking on paper and you're pulling two guys together for every frigging possible consideration that you can have,
SPEAKER_02: it simply doesn't get that much better than that. Neil, my opinion, yes, Sasho beat Paul 3-2, and it was a very close match. Very close match. But it was 95 category. Yeah. David beat Sasho also after a very, very tough match. It was an 85-kilo category. So, for sure, my opinion, Pauline is stronger
SPEAKER_02: than any opponent that David has faced in 85 kilo. I'm not saying that he's better than 95 kilo Sasho. But, so the question here, how much better David will be when he is pulling in 95 kilo compared to his 85 kilo. So what I just say that Paul in 95 kilo, David 85 kilo, I think Paul wins.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know why, but I had a brain for it and I had him that David won it 3-2, but he actually lost 3-2, didn't he? No, Paul won 3-2. But I will say something like, yes, it was David's first match, also Paul's first match at the East versus West, but Paul had been more active even during the pandemic while
SPEAKER_02: Samosa kind of stopped everything after the pandemic because there was no European, no WAF, and then WAF banned Georgia for some reason. And then of course they later were allowed to come back. But what I just try to say, Paul improved a lot. David already had the international experience. Zloty champion, European champion, world champion. Incredible guy. He even placed third in the overalls of Zloty Tur.
SPEAKER_02: Pauline improved a lot. You understand? Listen, Neil. If four years ago, I would tell you that Pauline can give a very good match to Rustam Bavaev, you would say? Because I remember I asked you about me versus Paul at that time. You said that you are more experienced. But look at how far Paul has come. Paul is...
SPEAKER_01: one of my favorite characters yeah in the sport of arm wrestling as a man he's an incredibly diligent very hard-working paul lin is a man that's what paul lin is you know he's a proper bloke he's a proper throwback he's a principled guy very
SPEAKER_01: level-headed hard-working uh intelligent diligent arm wrestler really worked hard really advances himself looking at the minutiae of the sport and he is an improving force and some of his in some of his performances have been incredibly impressive incredibly impressive
SPEAKER_01: i think with david samusha um you couldn't have picked a better a more balanced test for so many reasons because both these guys have been improving quietly in very different ways but over the same time frame and putting them together now is like perfectly timed and this is another awesome match right there
SPEAKER_02: Probably my second favourite match on the card. Yeah, it's a very good one. One guy says, what if Engin stays at 95 instead of cutting to 85? Are you talking about me? If you are talking about me, then I have never been 95 kilos. If I lose my unnecessary weight,
SPEAKER_01: I would be 75 kilos. Do you agree, Neil? You're most competitive at 75 kilos. At your age now, 75 kilos. Back in the day when you were a young man, 70 kilos. Neil, I don't think I can make 75. Not at 50 years old, mate, no.
SPEAKER_02: No, I'm like 92 kilo, 91 and a half or something. You're old and soft and like a cat like me now. No, no, I'm coming, I'm training. And I will tell you something, I am behind, but kind of like it responds good. I think that maybe joints rested a bit. That's good. Yeah, I think this is how I feel, but let's see.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, so let's go. That was another great match, and let's go one more. Wow, wow, wow. All these matches, you know, just like, I mean, like, listen. You know the other one that I'm super excited about on this card? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. We go by order. Okay. But if you are an arm wrestling fan, and if you don't appreciate this card... There's something wrong with you. Something is wrong with you, yeah. That's good. Yeah, something is wrong with you, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, Serhii Kalinichenko, Ivan Matushenko. Yeah, this is a great match. And I will tell you my opinion, not about the winner, but I kind of don't see, maybe he's going to teach me something new, but I don't see Serhii at 115 kilos, not the super heavyweight one, top-rolling Ivan Matushenko. I don't see that one.
SPEAKER_02: I mean, at least in a fresh match. I don't see him top rolling. So I am thinking, and when I talk with them, they were my guests. What I felt was that Serhii is going to go hook, but not deep hook, but more like this. You understand? Not this, not this, but in between, you know. And when I heard that, I was like, okay, Serhii knows what he's doing. Will it be enough?
SPEAKER_01: i don't know and now you tell us what you think i absolutely love sergey kalinichenko i think he's one of the best characters in the sport at the moment he's one of those guys you know we always speak about you've got to try to be a character you've got to try to uh give the best of yourself to bring entertainment as well as excellence
SPEAKER_01: Kalinichenko really does step up to the mark in that respect. The way he looks, the way he conducts himself. I think he's a star. A genuine star. Love the lad. I think that he has been searching for and has requested very high-level matches. When I've seen him, he said, you know, I want to pull a really high-level athlete. Well, my God, he's got one.
SPEAKER_01: Not only is Matyushenko extraordinarily high level, he's also one of the trickiest arm wrestlers to work out and to counter. Period. He is an absolute assassin.
SPEAKER_01: My heart couldn't come off far enough to Sergei Kalinichenko for accepting this match. And if he wins this match, wow. What a statement. Do I think he is a favorite in this match? No. I think Marty Yashchenko is a strong favorite. As much as 70%. Um,
SPEAKER_02: I think that matches closer, but let's see. Let's go to next one. Wow. Arthur Makarov, Daniel Prokofiev. Listen, listen, if I would ask this one to someone else, you understand, I wouldn't get that excited. But I know that you share what I feel. I know you share what I feel.
SPEAKER_01: few weeks ago we were on the fix right and we you don't know there was not many matches that had been released but this one had and i maybe screwed up because i couldn't help myself and i started talking about it so that that's why i will never leak the card to you anymore yeah i couldn't help myself i mean this is this is
SPEAKER_01: In all sports, the super heavyweight category gets a lot of focus, a lot of attention, and it always will. It's always going to get that attention. And the characters get the attention. And the bravado gets the attention, the drama, and all those other elements. But sometimes when you're right in the thick of the game, as I am, you can't help but get excited about this kind of thing.
SPEAKER_01: This, we are in like a golden age of mega matches. And we've just come off one. I talked a lot about this at the start of today and prior to the last event. Yannis Amelin's Mendigas Teresaitis represents the pinnacle, pinnacle of the guys in this weight class. You're seeing two of the absolute slayers. Well, here we go again. I mean...
SPEAKER_01: If you're talking about top-end power, if you're talking about genuinely abominable level, I mean horrible, filthy, that's what we're talking about here. These guys are stupid strong, unimaginably strong. Most people in the chat won't appreciate how strong these guys are. They are dead.
SPEAKER_01: ridiculous diesel strong i can't wait this is a mega matchup mega mega mega matchup i spoke about it earlier and i said you know what other match i'm stupidly excited about well here we go what am i and and there's another one coming but this is the one this match is underrated beyond belief because both these guys
SPEAKER_01: They haven't mastered the English language, so they're not able to heavily promote themselves. I mean, with Arthur, you're looking at a pretty understated guy anyway. Very, very quiet guy. Daniel is quite a funny and deeming humorous guy. And he's got a lot of bounce. Very bright kid. You don't get better. It just doesn't get better than this. You are topping out. There is an argument that you are seeing.
SPEAKER_02: the two best lightweights currently on earth. Maybe. I have never ever seen this category to have like
SPEAKER_02: five six guys that were they are very very close very very close yeah like like like can you imagine that we all thought that alan zole was one head above all of them that's what we thought daniel and then daniel just went and then just beat him and then mindagos beat daniel and then arthur beat mindagos and then chad castle beat that and then like and then mindagos beat chad castle chad castle with daniel prokopchuk i mean it's just like
SPEAKER_01: It's ridiculous. It's a hands-on wheel of excellence. And it's hard to argue that these two guys might be, on any given frigging Saturday, the absolute pinnacle of arm wrestlers at this weight class on the planet. And it's on. And how could you not love it? I love this match. I frigging love this match. And one of the things I love about it is that
SPEAKER_02: I am going backwards and forwards daily on who I think wins this. Since it was announced, I'm thinking about... Listen, do you know why you are confused? Do you know why you are confused? Because you are knowledgeable and experienced enough to know all possible ways. This match can go there, but also can go there. But you don't know where this is going to go. Okay, let's go one by one.
SPEAKER_02: what if they both decide to go here i've got daniel daniel okay then then then which way you are confused the macro can win if basically if we can see makarov hang on to his pronator and go straight across and straight so you are saying yes yeah because of the thickness of his
SPEAKER_01: the structure of arthur is unusually massive yeah it is hard to have a grip on his hand too yes okay what if daniel tries outside and arthur tries inside well this is why i this is why because i'm freaking i've got i've gone through these in my head i've gone i i go through these scenarios in my mind and it's hard not to tie yourself in knots you know it
SPEAKER_01: It's extremely hard to call this with, you know, listen, it's always a focus. You look like you want Daniel to win. Is that true? Do you want Daniel to win? Yes. That's what I can see, yeah. Yes. I make no, you know, I make no excuses for the fact that Daniel Prokopchuk is awesome. I love the kid. I think he's ace. Massive Daniel fan.
SPEAKER_01: I'm a big, big, big fan of the lad. I don't speak his language. You don't speak mine, but I love him. Don't know Arthur as well. Very, very quiet, very humble lad. Very respectful. Very, very, very respectful. Super respectful guy. And also unbelievably good. Yeah, very strong. Very strong, yeah. So you don't have a clear, clear prediction.
SPEAKER_02: 52-48, Daniel. 52-48, okay. I mean, stupid. You know. Oh, my word. Don't speak to me tomorrow, it's the other way. I don't know. I mean, who have you got? Honestly, this is 50-50 as frick. I mean, it's ridiculous. Yeah, yeah. I cannot really... Listen, when you say that if it goes to hook, Daniel wins, but the way that Arthur goes hook
SPEAKER_02: If they go hook, Arthur may end up here. Because when you have a grip on his hand, his hand is like his brachioradial is so strong, he may have the advantage. You may end up a little bit underneath. Do you understand? Mike, do you know what the deciding factor is in favour of Daniel? Yeah. Two things. Number one, slight bit of biased, willing...
SPEAKER_02: result to happen number two and more importantly endurance i i thought you were gonna say that but look look at the round one between between round one like do you i will explain to you something like daniel beat oh sorry yeah daniel beat first two rounds in davos yep and then yeah but i knew you were gonna say
SPEAKER_02: Listen, listen. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then look at the round one between Mindaugas and Arthur. Mindaugas, actually, round one was about to pin Arthur. And Arthur, the match stopped. So it was what Mindaugas wanted. And then Arthur fouled. And then, right from restart to the following rounds, every round was even... Yeah. But I think that...
SPEAKER_01: Arthur is pulling more on structure and awkward while Daniel is able to pull more on structure as in joint. And I think he's got more resting capability in the joint if he can find his spot. And I think that that can be a difference maker. But it all comes down to where does the match settle first?
SPEAKER_01: and because where the match settles is so critical on what element of the you know what i'm talking about where the bird is kicking in and where the positional advantage i am commentating this i know you've got ryan coming over and all also no yeah yeah this match
SPEAKER_02: I'm commentating this match because... Yeah, yeah. We will do everything together there, you know. This match is a frigging... I will tell you something, Arthur. Arthur is... I think Arthur has interesting type of endurance. Arthur's refreshing ability is quick. Yes. Between the rounds. There are two types of endurance. Within the match...
SPEAKER_02: And recovery, fitness. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. More matches. So, I don't know if you remember, in 2018 WAP final, Mindaugas and Arthur were in the final. And Arthur already was A-side. And Mindaugas top-rolled Arthur and won. And then rematch and Arthur just hooked him and beat him. So, the guy kind of, like, I don't know how, but he...
SPEAKER_02: Between the rounds, he recovers quick. Someone said the same thing about Vitaly. I don't know if it's true or not. So let's go to the next one. This one also will excite you. Gennady Kvikvinia, Ibrahim Sagov. I will explain to you. I don't know if you heard this from me or not. But Gennady Kvikvinia, he already wanted to pull Devon in Tbilisi in 115 kilos. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: So we decided to make it a super heavyweight match. And Devon was also bulking. And so, Rino Masic, he got injured badly. And Rino can't defend his title anytime soon. But Rino won. Young guy. We are proud of him. Rino will remain the champion, but he can't defend. So we decided to do an interim title match. So when I offered
SPEAKER_02: Like, listen, Reno and Ibrahim Sago was a very close match. You were there. Very close match. Really close. Brilliant match. 4-3. 4-3, yeah. So Sago, since Devin is not heavyweight anymore, but super heavyweight, if Devin was heavyweight, he deserves a title match right away. So Sago is the guy. And Matushenko said that he is not ready. He needs a little bit of time. Yeah. And so...
SPEAKER_01: And when I asked Gennady, Gennady said he would pull 115 kilos only if it is a world title match. So that is how we ended up this match. And it makes sense. Yeah. Yeah, it makes sense. Yeah. Amazing match. Experience. You've got experience. You've got to go with Gennady Kvitvinya because he's got a lot of lanes and we know that he is. I mean, one thing that guy has proved is there is not a backward step
SPEAKER_01: And we know that he can go anywhere and he will hang on forever. The explosivity and raw top end of Ibrahim Sagov makes this a very engaging match. Sagov, for me...
SPEAKER_01: It's not the finished article yet. I think he's new in the sport comparatively. I think he's getting better and better and better. And he's another guy that has a huge future. I spoke early on about Maharin having the structure to just do well. I've said before, Ibrahim, you stand near Ibrahim Sagov and you can feel how strong this guy is. I mean, he is up.
SPEAKER_01: beast an absolute weapon man is just put together gift from god strong you know he's one of those guys he's like walks into the room and you just look at him and you're like jesus christ that is an absolute monster and i think he goes on to get better and better and better mate this match is absolutely ace
SPEAKER_01: It is awesome. I think we might see this thing swing either way. Don't be surprised if you see Sagov early with that aggressive deep finish and then he gets hung up similar to what we saw with Reno. You see Gennady maybe find a way back in. I think this could end up match of the night, this one. It's because the energy that's going to go in there and the
SPEAKER_01: And the positions. I think both men have that little bit of pride is probably the right word. That little bit of
SPEAKER_01: fuck it, let's go. You know, sometimes when your strategy goes out of the window and you just think, nah, nah, I need the head nod and I need to go in and I need to prove a way. Alpha male points. And there's nobody on this card that has more alpha male points than these two. And I think that they will want to run each other over.
SPEAKER_01: And it's kind of ride or die stuff. You know, they'd rather go out on their shield than think about strategy and run around someone. These aren't guys that are going to try and look for a lane to get around and technically neutralize their opponent. They're going for war. And I think war is what we're going to get.
SPEAKER_01: and don't be surprised if this is the most engaging long drawn out match of the night i can't wait for it this there's three matches on the card that i'm most excited about everybody's talking about the main event awesome but the match we just talked about which is the pinnacle of lightweights this match and mask nugo or oh and lynn samusha or
SPEAKER_02: Stupid, stupid matches. This card is immoral. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, I really hope that everyone understands that. Everyone understands that. It's immoral. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, let's go to this one. I'm also very, very curious about your opinion. Very curious. Ruslan Babayev versus Tatasins.
SPEAKER_02: Hey, do I make you tired? Dude, I mean, what was I saying about this card being immoral? Yeah. I mean, good God. And can you imagine that we already talked about 10 matches and we still have two matches that are like crazy, you know? Mate...
SPEAKER_01: Think about the depth of questions within the history and within the evolution and recent past of these athletes. Just think about that. Everybody in the chat, everybody watching the show, try and wrap your head around that. Todd Ziller, at the age he's at, believes that he is still improving. And the evidence would suggest that he is.
SPEAKER_01: Now, the old adage, Father Time remains undefeated. And certainly in my case, he has kicked the living piss out of me. But in Toddzilla, he seems to be batting Father Time away for the moment and improving all the time. The man is evolving as an arm wrestler and has shored up a lot of holes. You know, he's...
SPEAKER_01: shut down lanes where previously he was vulnerable. One of those lanes is the ability to defend against the fast attack. He has lost to this guy very badly in the past. But he lost to a very prime, very polished, younger version of Rustam who had not been injured himself.
SPEAKER_01: Now, you wind the clock forward, and due to an issue with Paul Lin, Rustam blows his peck, and that takes the gas out of him. And it is fair to say... No, no, no. One second, one second. I think Rustam also had an injury the same place
SPEAKER_02: in 2016 or something, I think in England or something somewhere. I think he's had it, I actually think he's had it a few times, but not as severe. Yeah, yeah. No, no, he also had the same injury. And then after that injury, he beat Tata Sings in Poland. So when I had Todd and Rustam, my guests, Rustam said that he has never, ever been in such physical shape as he is now. Right.
SPEAKER_01: so let's talk about the speed of rustam babayath right now do you think he is as quick he's as quick and direct and pulling positionally the same as when he previously blew through todzilla
SPEAKER_02: Or not? Do you think he's as fast? Just remember Atlantic City match against Sandris. Very different. Very different. Ready, go. You know, ready, go. Yeah, but neutralise Sandris. Full-line Sandris. He ain't doing that with top. No, Sandris tried out in... Sandris is not a joke. Sandris was heavier than Rustam and every round started here and ended up here. You know, like, I saw very similar Rustam as his prime, you know, about, like,
SPEAKER_02: maybe i didn't see the same against pauline in orlando but paul is also very very very explosive i mean paul is very explosive even sasho had huge trouble which doesn't and can't hang on to his pronator in the same way what what are you talking about side it doesn't have that pronation
SPEAKER_02: Paul told me, yeah, I understand, but what I just say is that I don't know if attacking Rustam's hand, do you know how it is? It's like a Russian roulette.
SPEAKER_01: yeah you do it or you don't do it you get flashed i kind of disagree my friend if you are going outside i do feel like todd might be strong enough to go halfway on that i think he might i think todd might be strong enough to make this purposely ugly to make it so it isn't a direct clean match
SPEAKER_01: To make it so neither one of them is really in the position. When you say pronator, Neil, when you say pronator, do you mean like Todd is going like his classic way, outside side pressure? Not in this instance, no. Not? Not in this instance. What are you talking about? I think this is how I see the match. Firstly, just answer the question I asked earlier on. In your opinion, is Rustam as fast now? Not stronger. Is he as fast as he used to be?
SPEAKER_02: But I will tell you something. Did you watch the six rounds? I mean, do you remember the six rounds that Rustam beat Todd? There were some rounds that he held him and then pinned him, you know? So he didn't really have... Once you control the pronators, I mean, the pinning may not be that hard. So what I'm just saying that... I think he did a lot of damage on the early hits, mate, when he blew through him. No, I understand. But what I just tried to say that, like, I don't think that it had...
SPEAKER_02: like only with his speed. It is just a crashing wrist power and then he dominates there, you understand? So my question to you, where should Todd go? First of all, do you think he's as fast? As fast? Do you think Rustam is as fast now as he used to be? Maybe a little bit less, but I don't think that was the key to beat Rustam. I think, listen, whenever I asked Rustam, I said,
SPEAKER_02: how close you guys were in power, you understand? If you were not that fast. He said it was a huge difference. And when I thought, he said, Todd said also, there was no way. Like, do you know what I thought when I thought? I was like, what if the match was really stopping? What would happen? But when I asked this question to them some days ago, they convinced me that the difference was there. I thought it was about this explosion, but this is what they said.
SPEAKER_02: And Rustam is generally a humble guy, you understand? I expected, listen, when I ask this question, I talk as you do now. And I expected an answer.
SPEAKER_01: or if the like the match was i was like a little bit stronger if you would really stop me i couldn't but that's not he said anything the difference was yeah but to be honest mate it doesn't i don't really pay much attention to that and i'll tell you why because they're not lying you get what you get from your experience you feel like you feel big based on experience and
SPEAKER_01: You said it a moment ago. Once you have controlled the pronation, the power never gets down. And Rustam was much quicker over the start. He was fast to position. And once he secured position, he's much, much better. He's neutralized, Todd, a great deal. Todd at that time was nowhere near the arm wrestler, technically. Nowhere near. Not close. I mean, he was still in the sport for more than 15 years, but
SPEAKER_02: uh he had wins against john bersing he has against like all the top pullers you know well aware of that but i think stylistically yeah stylistically he improved a lot but what i'm saying is much more well-rounded improved is our outer side pressure
SPEAKER_02: he has much stronger now pronated before he was just giving up on his pronated he was trying to get in there yeah now we're getting but now he has very good back pressure very good uh pronated and incredible side pressure but what I'm just saying that where Todd has improved is in my opinion is the strongest part of which is his fingers wrist and you know the crushing controlling even John
SPEAKER_01: around his prime he had hard time to you know outside you know against against okay stop there hold that thought yeah but but john let him hit i know he did because he told me he was going to backstage right before the match
SPEAKER_01: Listen, John is not an explosive guy anyway, compared to Rustam. But he told me what he was going to do, and he did it. But listen, when you say that he did, just look at the round one. No, no, no. Listen, John tried to keep Rustam
SPEAKER_02: outside like he was like and he was hanging here and rustam got foul yeah eventually but he was getting close and john was going outside what i just tried to say that john tried to keep him
SPEAKER_01: outside you understand now hold that thought like i said i'm talking about i'm talking about the first match first time didn't have a second one they went inside yes now john at that time didn't have the opportunity to arm wrestle ugly like todd does he just didn't he doesn't have the joint strength he doesn't arm wrestle like that but if you piece together the fact that todd does have that option
SPEAKER_02: he does have the option to potentially get the break off. Listen, you to put the match to the ugly position, you really need to make sure that your pronator is not controlled by Rustam. Even the round that Pauline injured Rustam by going inside, previous two rounds, he went outside or something and Rustam was beating him very quickly. So what I just tried to say when I said the Russian roulette, what I meant is that
SPEAKER_02: Todd may have done something, but if somehow he tries to protect his pronator, and if he cannot, and if he loses, he's going to lose the match quick. Because when you try to use your pronator, and then your pronator is, like to use pronator, you need to move your shoulder to outside, outside, back. And then when you are going back with shoulder, and if your pronator turns that way, that match, that round is going to end quick.
SPEAKER_02: But if Todd has a different plan, I don't know. But of course, if Todd keeps Rustem's wrist in a neutral position, Todd is winning that match. Nobody, nobody at Todd Hutchings' weight category with a flat wrist like this can F with Todd Hutchings. He puts you in this position, you both are like this.
SPEAKER_02: is beating you you cannot beat him you you can't you can't because you can't you basically it is very very hard maybe one percent maybe less to beat todd without controlling his pronator you need to control that that is how daddy can beat him couldn't go outside with him he had to go inside yeah and can you imagine that todd kept him and bring him here and then
SPEAKER_02: Dadikyan was able to lift him up from there. So what I'm just saying is that you control Tad's pronator, you have a good chance of winning. You cannot control his pronator, he's going to beat you even if you are Rustem most likely. You know, I think Todd learned from the Dadikyan much, Engin. I don't know. I think that Dadikyan's hand is very strong. I think even if they would pull again today, even Tad just prepares himself for that.
SPEAKER_02: I think that Dadikian's hand struck, I mean, different. You remember three rounds, this guy beat Morozov left arm. He was 114 kilos. And this guy also, like, I mean, it's like hard to take his hand. Hard to take Dadikian's hand, you know, my opinion. Yeah, I agree. But I think that Todd learned from that match. And I think there is a halfway house from here. If he can make this match,
SPEAKER_01: Rustam is nowhere near, nowhere near as strong if he doesn't get to the A side and get the control he needs. He's not close to as strong. He's not a defensive puller. He's not a defensive puller. No, exactly. What are you talking about? Do you talk about hook? I think there's two or three options that are all relating to... If Toddy's very left on the pad, he has a really, really good shot.
SPEAKER_02: In which way? You're talking about hook or you're talking about outside? Either one gives him an opportunity. You don't have to go with one lane. You can throw in one lane and then transition. Listen, if it goes to inside... Rustam's game is early, but he needs to secure a position. If Rustam does not secure a position early, he's half as strong. Neil, if it goes to inside in any position, Rustam still has a chance. If it is a winning chance for Rustam, more chance.
SPEAKER_02: If Rustam is here or center, then the match is close. Exactly. If he's center or slightly losing, Rustam is in a match, mate.
SPEAKER_01: And I don't believe that the scar tissue in his pec will be totally healed. I really don't. And I think when you're in that kind of situation, age and fatigue and damage comes back to haunt you. And I think it could be a very, very interesting match. In terms of the speed factor, I don't believe Rustam pulls the same as he used to do. I think he's slowed down considerably. He may be stronger.
SPEAKER_01: than he's ever been but i don't sure he's fast over the first couple of inches like he used to be it will be very interesting to see if he is if he's saying i'm as fast as i used to be i'm pulling like i used to if he comes out let me ask you this what is the possibility in your opinion taught to keep the match outside of hook and
SPEAKER_01: protecting his pronator. What is the path of his odyssey? I think that it wouldn't be a bad strategy to use that as a starting point, as a precursory point, because he can, whereas a lot of people cannot afford to go into any kind of hook position with Rustam, he can.
SPEAKER_01: And why? He may not win that match, but what he might do is put enough fatigue and damage into Rustam that allows him to do better as the rounds progress. Because if it comes down to endurance, it's not close. If he can pull it into an endurance match, it is not close.
SPEAKER_01: Not close. So you are saying that if the strength level is close, then Todd wins. This is what you are saying. I'm saying that if he can turn it into a dog fight, an ugly match. I mean, to turn to dog fight, the strength level needs to be close. If the match stays very clean. If the match is very clean, Rustam is a pretty heavy favorite. If the match turns ugly, Todd is a heavy favorite. Yeah, but what ugly is you are saying that him to...
SPEAKER_01: Put an eight. I think there are three or four, certainly two lanes that are very conceivable, neither pure outside, pure inside, which Todd can utilize. He would be able to do that because of the fact that the match becomes ugly. I don't want to talk too much about it because by doing so, it favors one athlete or the other. And I want to see where they're really at on their own merits.
SPEAKER_01: But I don't believe that Rustam Babayat is as fast as he was. And I think that that was one of the big dominant factors. And I also think that Todd has firmed up some of the holes which made him much more vulnerable to Rustam in the past. Now, it's very interesting that you say Rustam believes he's better than he's ever been. I don't.
SPEAKER_01: I just don't. I think he might be stronger than he's ever been. But I don't think he's as good because one of Rustam's primary weapons was explosivity. It simply was. I don't know. Whenever I watch him against Sandris,
SPEAKER_02: I saw the same Rostam. I don't get it at all. There is no comparison between what's going to happen here and Sandris. Sandris is many times 110 kilo walk champion. But stylistically so different. Once again, he's very, very close.
SPEAKER_02: he has been close to reno i think reno may have the winning record against him yeah but what i'm just saying that i expected that match to stop you understand some point i expected like some point you know and then whenever i see that he couldn't engage then that that remind me that now behind the scenes i heard prior to that match and after that match that sandras wasn't in great shape
SPEAKER_02: I don't know. The photos and everything I saw, I never seen Sandris like that, all the blood veins and things. Yeah, he looks like a walking hard-on, but I spoke to the guy and I spoke to the guys around him, and they told me that Sandris was not in great shape. I don't know. I don't know. I have seen a lot of people saying those kind of things, too. But I think that this is a very, very different match. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: an incredibly engaging match i don't believe that uh it will take the same exact shape that it did in the past i think it might be a much better entertaining more entertaining match now and i do believe as i said earlier that both men have changed direction a little i think the injury is the thing that need that may come into
SPEAKER_01: become a problem here because I think that that would create an issue for Rustam from an endurance perspective. I think if it comes down to an ugly dog fight, it heavily favors Todd. I think if it's really clean, it favors Rustam. Rustam, if Rustam can keep really clean form, and he's a brilliant arm wrestler, brilliant arm. Listen, Neil, you have been saying clean or ugly, clean or ugly, and I still don't understand why
SPEAKER_02: What is exactly clean? You are saying that even in hook he can beat him and hook is clean, you know? What is... I think he can transition from one position to another, Engin. I don't think the match necessarily has to take a single... No, no, what I... Like, listen, you said that if the match is in, like, clean hook position and endurance game,
SPEAKER_01: Todd wins, so that is still a clean hook match, you know. When you say clean, do you mean the fast win? Fast win, do you mean when you say clean? No, not necessarily. Listen, you talked about it a moment ago. Securing the pronator, disabling the pronator of Toddzilla is very key for Rustam to stay in his lane. If Rustam is very, very quick,
SPEAKER_01: in terms of securing his position. That is what I'm talking about in terms of clean. Very, very quick and able to secure his position. If he's not, he's going to be in a very tough position. They are in the center and rush them control past pronators. Usually when you are in hook, you mostly control the pronators.
SPEAKER_02: What I just tried to say, but you said Todd can still win if it is Endron's game, right? I think if Todd can stop the match in the centre of the table or be on his A side, he is very much alive in the match. Okay, isn't it clean position? Neil, isn't it clean position? Sorry, say again. Like the match at the centre, isn't it clean hook?
SPEAKER_01: Not necessarily, no. What's his ugly hook? I think, well, there's, I mean, how many demonstrations do you want? There's like fucking hundreds. If you make the match very, very ugly, Torben can win it. If the match is on the...
SPEAKER_02: No, no, no, that's not what I'm saying. Just give me an example so I can understand you. Does it really matter the position? Neil, Neil, Neil, tell me an example that they are centred in the hook, Todd is winning, and that is an ugly hook. That I try to understand. Well, if you're really turned in, that's clean, isn't it? Okay, so this is what I'm saying. But listen, you are saying that they are in the centre, Todd has the chance to win. So that is also, Todd has a chance to win even in a clean position.
SPEAKER_01: Yes. Now I understand you. I'll explain how. Okay. Now I understand what you're saying. Okay. Let me walk you through a scenario. Okay. Todd can hang on to the match with a little bit more back pressure and make it sit up in the centre. And in round one, Rustam gets pretty clean position and drives through, drives through, and he wins. But he's a little gassed.
SPEAKER_01: And in the second round, Todd goes more left, does a similar thing. And this time, Rustam doesn't quite get the control. He gets halfway there. And Todd can then cut into his position. Then we are singing and dancing. And then we're in a long match. And from that situation, much more interesting match. Can I ask you something? A lot of people criticise David Dadikian being explosive, but not having good endurance.
SPEAKER_02: lot of people this is what people says and what why because of the morozov situation the morozov situation he was beating prudnik 2-0 he lost to 3-2 and if you if you didn't get hurt though yeah but but like he also had some like with the right arm with the petrenko first round he started good and then petrenko won anyway so a lot of people think that
SPEAKER_02: Dadikyan is very explosive but doesn't have the super good endurance. But Tartt hooked him and brought him near the pad in winning position and Dadikyan was able to lift him and beat him. Do you think, my question if you listen, do you think that
SPEAKER_02: Todd has been depending on outside pronator control, outside pull so much that maybe his hook endurance when you don't pull like, remember in the past when before Dave Sheffield got injured, he was mostly like drag, drag, hooking that way. And then he started outside pronator base side pressure. And now whenever he goes inside, he can't even really
SPEAKER_02: The arm doesn't want to, because when you pronate so much, so much, so much, your arm doesn't want to really go. He wants to turn out. Do you think that that was the case with Todd? Yes, I think exactly that. I think Todd has attached himself and actually evolved as an arm wrestler, which makes him more difficult to deal with.
SPEAKER_01: And that is a big, big change. And it's also very interesting when you look at Rustam. And when we started to discuss this match, I said, wrap your head around the evolution of these guys. That is why this is such an interesting match, because neither one is the man they used to be. It's a bloody good job, because if they were, it'd be a very boring, easy win for Rustam Bobaev.
SPEAKER_01: Honestly, it would. Because he was too explosive and he did everything. He was the perfect machine to disable Todd. He was strong enough to go straight through Todd. And has done numerous times and it was pretty boring and entertaining. Didn't diminish Todd. Everybody's got that guy that's just a nightmare arm wrestler. Rustam is actually that guy for Sandra Sherrys for a number of reasons, which we talked about before that match. But it's...
SPEAKER_01: Devin Larratt is for Petrenko. Makes him look like a bum. Petrenko is no bum. He's just... Devin is perfectly designed to destroy his day. That's the reality of it. If you go to speak to Devin Larratt tonight in Mexico, if you say, did Neil tell you months before that match when it was announced that he'll destroy Petrenko and it will be boring?
SPEAKER_01: Ask him. Ask Devin if I told him that. And after the match, Devin came over and said, well, you did say I'd murder his ass. And I said, yeah. And it's not because Petrenko's not bad. It's you are designed to beat this guy. Everything you do right, it's going to cock him up. And the interesting thing for me here is, has Toddzilla evolved enough?
SPEAKER_01: To be able to make this match sticky. Because if he can make this match sticky, he will pull Rustam Babayev into a situation where Babayev is not at his best. Previously, Rustam has been able to dominate the match by wrestling very cleanly, very smoothly. And he's an excellent arm wrestler. Very underrated technical arm wrestler. And he took away... He just out-arm wrestled Todd in the past.
SPEAKER_01: this will be interesting if todd can make it sticky ugly that is not rustam's game he does not arm wrestle well in those situations every time he's been in that kind of situation he's really struggling okay tremendous issues with that neil it has been one hour and 49 minutes so yeah yeah so we have one more match
SPEAKER_02: And we have been talking about this match for like probably 15 minutes. Apologies to the chat. Yeah, but it just shows, you know, how good the match is. And so Vitaly Laletin versus Michael Todd. I mean, my God. Vitaly Laletin, in my opinion, is probably the greatest present threat to Levon Saganashvili stylistically. However,
SPEAKER_01: Michael Todd may be the most difficult stylistic match out there right now for Vitaly Lletin. There are a number of reasons why. Vitaly Lletin loves to pull low-hand pistol grip top roll because of the advantages he's got from a leverage perspective. He's magnificent at doing that. Maybe the best we've ever seen.
SPEAKER_01: the super heavyweight division um he's adapted that style and has done it wonderfully he's also one of my favorite super heavyweights of all time love i talked about it earlier i love guys who arm wrestle stylistically he's been involved in some of the best matches that you you'll ever see um a brilliant arm wrestler
SPEAKER_01: very, very decorated, growing, changing, evolving. He's embraced what's happened with East versus West and King of the Table. And he is, I mean, we're talking about a different thing that we've ever seen. You know, he's 150 kilos now. This isn't the same guy that pulled Levan in the top eight. His arc is higher than any athletes in the division, period.
SPEAKER_01: What I mean by that is his spiral, his attacking arc is higher and therefore more difficult to contain. And he creates massive problems for a lot of people as a result of that. One thing he doesn't do proficiently and has not needed to do proficiently because of the height of the arc is climb.
SPEAKER_01: He's not a guy that rises and climbs, knuckles up, rises and climbs. He simply has not shown that element of his game in the past. There's a number of reasons why. That is the primary reason why Michael is potentially a real issue for him. The unknown here is whether the momentum and top-end strength
SPEAKER_01: And simply the height of that arc is so significant now on a 150 kilo version of Vitaly that he just does not get slowed down. And it's so difficult to put the brakes on that he goes straight to the pad. It may happen. And it may be a boring match. It may be. On the other hand, Michael...
SPEAKER_01: can't contest the hype game but he can hang on to his rise his pronation is ridiculous his ability to gut it out and to win very ugly matches is ridiculous and if this turns into a sticky match i believe he definitely wins it's a fabulously engaging
SPEAKER_01: Most people are going to give the favourite to Vitaly Laletin. And why wouldn't you? I mean, the dude is unbelievable right now. And we've just seen Mike come off a loss with Hermes. And people always do this arm wrestling maths. I can't do that kind of arm wrestling maths because I can see too many angles. Maybe to my detriment, I can't do that.
SPEAKER_01: I can see the angles here, as I'm sure you can. I think that Vitaly Laletin will be able to see the angle here where Mike's a problem. And it's actually a credit to Vitaly's balls that he's happy to stamp, because this is a banana skin for everything. This is an absolute banana skin.
SPEAKER_01: I said it the other night on The Fix with Mike when I was speaking to him, mate, and I've spoken to you about it before. When I was speaking to
SPEAKER_01: Hermes Gasparini. Hermes spoke about the fact that he is perfectly designed to beat Michael Todd. And that gave him otherworldly confidence. That's why he was so confident that he was able to piece him apart. And as it happens, he did and he delivered exactly on that. But one thing was evident.
SPEAKER_01: wasn't just talking off the top of his hat if you looked at the match history that the guys have had if you looked at the makeup of ermis he is very well designed one of the reasons is because his speed his ability to walk and climb and then transition to a very heavy press is great he's magnificent at doing that is vitaly yeah
SPEAKER_01: There is the question. And I know, listen, I'm not asking, I know you can see all this. But for the people in the chat, there lies the question. And it's a fabulous match. And one of the things that makes arm wrestling the most wonderful sport in the world, in my opinion, is that the opportunity for things to go sideways in all combat sports always remains consistent. And
SPEAKER_01: i would love to see this match evolve because it will be a real education of how that can present itself when you've been in the game for for as many years as we have and many of the people who are in the sport will have been we've seen example after example after example of these things
SPEAKER_01: And over time, you realize that that can present itself. And this is a great opportunity for that to happen again. It's also exciting to see Vitaly Lilletin on the journey he is on. And there'll be another side of the fan base that want to see him run over Mike, that want to see him destroy Mike. Because if he can, number one, who destroys Mike? Nobody runs through Mike. Nobody runs through Michael Toddy. The last guy that did that was Devon.
SPEAKER_02: He just doesn't get decimated that regularly at all, you know? I don't think Devin ran through Michael until Michael got exhausted. King of the table. No, no, not round one. The only guy that I have seen doing some rounds was Pushkar, two rounds, you know, in Poland. But at that time, Michael was, I think, allowed to do that desperation move.
SPEAKER_02: now with the open arm top row it is it is more uh possibility there is one super chat that roman gamtenaz says if i was a betting guy i would listen to you guys i i wouldn't suggest that because uh more you know more you are confused right now do you remember your conversation with that guy what was his name harry well i always i listen to people like you know
SPEAKER_01: I listen to people like Henry Nehring and I listen to people like, you know, for a deep, uh, the, of the arm wrestling opinion. I don't know why you'd call that arm wrestling news. I didn't know news. That's, he does a great job. I'm just messing with him, but he does a great job in reporting news, but he puts more opinions across than he puts news. Uh, we all know that pretty, we all know that. So, so, uh,
SPEAKER_01: All I'll say is this. Good on you for having the spokes to step up and do that. Pradeep, Henry, and anybody else that wants to just go rushing in headlong, good for you. Amazing. Sometimes it'll come off, sometimes it won't. Whenever we talk about these things, it's a forecast. It's a possibility. The possibility... Listen, Neil. If two guys are pulling against each other, your chance of predicting is right is 50%. So, I mean, like,
SPEAKER_02: I may go outside and ask someone, you know, don't know anything about armwrestling. I will just give them their name. What I would always say is, tell me how the match goes, break down the match, describe the match. Give me a descriptor of the match. Tell me how the match goes, show me the lanes and we'll see. Like what we can do is that we know all the possibilities. So more you know, more you are unsure because many, many, many different things can happen.
SPEAKER_02: Pulling off John, has anyone ever been so strapped deep, even post to go, want hook, back pressure, Kings move like ready go, more than look? What did you understand? Repeat. Can you repeat that, mate? I don't know. My English probably. Has anyone ever been so strapped deep, even post to go, want hook, back pressure, Kings move like ready go, more than look?
SPEAKER_02: Uh, I didn't understand. Sorry, but maybe Neil understand. Yeah. Okay. There is a super chat. I can't read your name. I can answer the question though. I can't answer that question. Okay. What's that? It came to me right there. Okay. Yes. Danny touch. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. And is Jerry Carter going to pull anytime soon? Yes.
SPEAKER_02: Yes. Yeah. And you will like the match. You will like the match. Oh, mate. I think I'm not going to... Let's leave it. You will be... I'm not going to tell you the match. The next thing you will be discussing on the fix. Not immediately. Yeah, like straight away. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 20 minutes. I'll be on there. Yeah. So sometimes when we talk, you know, when I say, like, for example, like...
SPEAKER_02: Michael has a chance to beat Vitaly, people go, oh, you are trying to hype Michael and hype the match, trying to sell paper. My friend, listen, if you are pulling against Michael Thorpe, there is, listen, if Hermes wasn't well-rounded as he is, you understand, whenever I said
SPEAKER_02: Hermes won that match barely. People say, oh, you're joking me. Yes, he won barely. And Hermes came to podcast and he said he won barely. Yes, of course. And he knows it. Even though he did everything perfectly, he did everything perfectly. Hermes pulled perfectly. And Hermes, about that, listen, Neil, he gives me the same like vibes, you know, like John was giving, like with him, you know.
SPEAKER_02: You know, like, like I, like he's so smooth at the table. The only thing probably is missing is more inside power, maybe more side pressure, but the outside ability of Hermes is like the smoothness and everything. The table IQ is very close to John's. He's very, very good. The only difference is that like, which is big, John was able to pull in any style.
SPEAKER_02: as good as anyone, you understand? But I will ask you something, the way that iPool
SPEAKER_02: how would you rate that move how would you raise how would i rate the the way that you pull the style yeah but that style the way huh you were absolute savage so what i'm just saying that like that way i'm doing good so the difference with john is doing this at that level this at that level this at that level he was doing everything and he's a graphic equalizer
SPEAKER_02: The treble is not high. The bass is not too high. The graphic equalizer is perfect in all areas. Contests anywhere with any one silk. Unbelievable. So let's finish and we will see Vitaly versus Michael. Incredible match. All of those matches are great. Very quickly, Hermes versus Levan. I see Hermes very dedicated.
SPEAKER_02: And the time that Levan said that those ways are fake, it just sounded like they were very big ways. And Levan thought it's not possible. And if those ways are the real ways, then a lot of people thought that this statement put Levan into like in a
SPEAKER_01: Levan is unbelievable. And until someone can dominate, you've got to be a believer. Levan has great reads in his matches. Levan is a force of nature. You've got to go for me. Levan will always start favourite at the moment from the current crop of heavyweights. Stylistically, I actually believe Vitaly Laletin is probably the biggest threat.
SPEAKER_01: technical well-roundedness yes you would go with ermis uh ermis is an evolving force and i don't think he will stop i think he'll continue the pursuit uh my phone just may die we've been on here so long i apologize to everybody but can we see a left-arm match between wagner and wagner bortolotti and corey west possible is it possible to make this match possible yeah casey says that do we
SPEAKER_02: do you two see a chance of anyone becoming dominant again in the sport with table time only or is weight training mandatory in the sport also what do you think um i'm not sure anybody would pursue just table time is it possible yes for the right person the right
SPEAKER_01: individual comes in, it's possible. Will anybody do it? Very unlikely. To be dominant in the super heavyweight division, I mean, you're talking, there's just not, it's a minimal chance that that would happen because
SPEAKER_01: why would you do that i mean you know i i just don't see it if you're going to be a dominant force i spoke about it earlier on one of the issues is that you can't find people to arm wrestle against it would become boring and it becomes problematic for you uh it's a limiting factor so there are challenges for people that are at elite level the challenges are around finding um
SPEAKER_01: the right training partners. I genuinely believe that different people can take different routes to the top. I think it's easy for a lighter weight guy to achieve. If it was ever going to happen, it would happen in a lighter weight class. It wouldn't happen with a super heavyweight. Neil, two hours and five minutes, I ask you something, you tell me. We're just warming up, Adrian. As short as possible. No, I will talk with you five hours, no problem. Oh, no.
SPEAKER_02: Engin Terzi now 92 kilo, he's 50 years old, tons of fat. Let me finish. So just say that I lost like seven kilo and then made 85 kilo category. I don't think I can lose 17 kilo, 15 kilo or something.
SPEAKER_02: I'm Paul Mindaugas Teresaitis. Okay, okay. Listen, I know you would want Mindaugas to win. I know that. I know that. But what is your opinion? There is someone, I'm not going to give his name, he would also allow me to lose to Mindaugas. Yeah, he's Paul Mindaugas.
SPEAKER_01: What's that? He's called Mindaugas. Mindaugas and you make me laugh. Okay, so who's winning? You have $10,000. Engin is ready. He is ready. And then we go table. I think for Mindaugas to have a good chance, honestly, it would need to be below 80 kilos. If the guy that pulled against VRL showed up, no problem.
SPEAKER_02: I think if you're 75 people... The guy that pulled Vera, the guy that pulled Vera, Mindaugas would beat that guy this way, this way. And Mindaugas would lose this way to that guy. So, but listen, even if I make like 85, my friend, you know, just like, I mean... Dude, don't be showing me. You don't know what fat is. Yeah, yeah. So I'm just saying that...
SPEAKER_01: I don't know how to lose all that weight. I don't even do cardio. I'm 112 kilos. Don't talk to me about that. But listen, when I was pulling 55 kilos, you were already pulling 80 kilos. So the same thing. Yeah. But listen, 75 kilo max. Let's go. It'd be amazing. Can you imagine the hype? Let's get your ass to Arm Wars. Let's go.
SPEAKER_02: Listen, I have beaten him when I was 70 kilos. I have beaten him when we were under 75 kilos. Dude, the banter alone would be awesome. It would go off. It would go off. But you need like six months build up just for the banter. It would be amazing.
SPEAKER_02: Can you imagine the messages? Holy shit, that'll be good stuff. Listen, last time he talked a lot. He said he's going to hold me from here and beat me and things like that. And listen, listen, I beat him so badly, 5-0 right and 5-0 left. After the match finished,
SPEAKER_02: First, he started asking me, how can I train? What can I do? And things like that. And the second thing he said, if we play again, I will never tease you like that again. He said, I don't think quite. He doesn't understand that. Why do you want... I threw... Okay, Marius Gay says, Engin, why do you not just announce the match with my friend? I'm like 50%, maximum, 55%.
SPEAKER_01: i don't even know if i can get in shape or not so how can i announce let me let me a little bit train and then see where i am and then that's the thing isn't it you're like oh you're not even training it's hard i mean i train remember now should start as a favorite against you because he's in the prime of his career he's prime he's right now i mean you're talking about in this shape
SPEAKER_02: mate in that shape you murder you you're not in you know okay yeah yeah i'm not gonna pull in that shape but but if i am in like anywhere near my best if you got back to the vrl dobering situation where you were there listen listen don't do that or something he can he can probably beat me like this but only after i get tired not right away
SPEAKER_02: Not right away. Here's the question, though. Honestly, do you think you could get back to that shape again? I don't know. No, no, but I will tell you something. You believe or not, 85% of that shape would beat him. Believe or not. Because I know what I'm talking about. Yeah, you know where you're at. Only you know where you're at. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Listen, Neil. You're a bad dude if you get back to that. I don't know whether you can. Neil, I didn't train for like two years and then one month trained and
SPEAKER_02: I destroyed, Ray, like one month training, like two years, nothing, all doing these things, and one month training. This time I probably will train for five months, you know, but I have been out so long time, so I don't exactly know where I am. No, that's the problem. When you get a certain level of, you've been inactive for that long and you're older. Yeah, yeah, that's bad. Injuries and stress and all kinds of shit. Yeah. I don't know. I
SPEAKER_01: people say to me you know could you get back and pull again obviously um i'd say no because am i committed could i dedicate that time to straight no honestly i'd love to come back and arm wrestle but would i be super dedicated and able to get up and hit the gym hard and train my ass off no because i'm too busted up so you know you got to be realistic if there was matches that i could get myself into if i could get fit
SPEAKER_01: and start to build up again i probably have to take some ass whippings and try and get back to a level you know but i'm conscious of the fact that i've been inactive i'm beat to damaged and it'd take me time to get back to be quite interesting i'd love to do to to start pulling again in that respect but i don't think i'm going to go and you know get back down to 85 kilo and start buying a little bit like a little bit what's that yeah a little little bit
SPEAKER_01: Come in. Hey, mate, you're upset. I'll tell you what. I hope you do get it back. I hope you do come back and start pulling again. Because do you think you'd still be as angry? Honestly? Do you think you'd still get wild like you used to? Can I ask you something? Do you think that it was really giving me power? What? When you were nuts? Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah. Absolutely.
SPEAKER_01: Listen, you were restless to the point where you were nuts. Absolute frigging lunatic. That obsessive compulsive never stopped. When I talked earlier on about the girls being limited because of that, the ladies class, you haven't got that
SPEAKER_01: I mean, this situation with Mindagus, if you get somebody that gets under your skin that bad that you can't wait to get out to the gym because you want to prove it that bad, bet your ass it makes you stronger. 100%. I think it makes you better in life. The journey that you go on, you might get your ass kicked and you're still amazing. You've progressed a great deal based on that.
SPEAKER_01: We will see. I'm training now. Listen, the only thing is that I'm still the same guy here, but the body doesn't match up. But we will see. That's what I tell my missus. She said, why did I marry you, you fat lump? I can't stand you. And I said, no, I'm the same guy.
SPEAKER_02: Same guy. She said, no, you're not. That's why I'm going with the milkman. That's what she says. See what I mean? That's what I have. Anyways, guys. Yeah. Thank you very, very much for watching us. Yes, yes. Just come in now. Milkman's left. Two guys that I love talking about arm wrestling. And one is Travis Bajan. The other one is Neil Pickup. And I love Travis.

And I love talking with Neil because he is very knowledgeable and he can do a deep analyzing. And yeah, thank you very, very much, Neil. Looking forward to getting over there. Can't wait. Yeah. See you soon. Yeah. Once again, Neil,
