SPEAKER_00: hello hello hello alex hi how are you good good you good good yeah another interesting match very interesting very interesting we will see we will see how it will be and let's see how is gennady doing with weight loss and other things you know
SPEAKER_04: I remember watching his story, I think, a few weeks ago. And even then, his face already looked, you know, like he looked like he was a bit lighter. I was like, oh, wow, you're losing weight. But you can be sure that this will be healthier for him. Oh, yeah, definitely. Yeah. Maybe not in short term because he's suddenly losing weight. But yeah.
SPEAKER_04: less stress on the body what's that less stress on the body being yeah yeah yeah no doubt like that's what 30 kilograms cutting a bit less uh i i think i think yeah yeah about that much yeah 25 30 yeah yeah but i i i believe that he's gonna cut
SPEAKER_00: Like, same like Devin. Devin was, like, 10 kilos over only a few days before. I think, if I'm not mistaken. Some days, for sure, before the event. And then just water cut. Yeah, yeah, water cut. And then next day he was 117 kilos. Mm-hmm. Yeah. I think they'll, like, the match day, I think they will be similar. I think Sagov's going to be bigger as well. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: I think Sago will gain maybe 4 kilo maximum, 5, while I think Gennady will gain 7-8 kilo at least, my opinion. I saw Sago's story, he's 125-127 I think. Are you serious? When I was watching his stories, like a week ago maybe. We'll ask, we'll see. Listen, he missed.
SPEAKER_00: the title like he was that close like him his match with reno was very close much very close and and that that is like gennady uh at that weight in my opinion he really uh deserves you know this match and since reno is away and since that match was very very close i i think ibrahim also deserves
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, whenever I was thinking about it, Ivan Matushenko, he says that he is not ready, you understand? Like he has some bicep issue, as far as I remember. And... I don't know, but listen, these guys, they all are...
SPEAKER_00: I mean, really incredible. And I don't know. We will see. We will see very, very tough matches. Very, very tough matches.
SPEAKER_04: It's a good card. It's so close. I hate how close it is. Usually, usually I have a like, let's say I see a match and most of the time I'm like, this guy's probably going to win.
SPEAKER_00: Vitaly Oletin versus Michael Todd is the most 50-50 match I've ever seen in my life. Every day, I'm like, Vitaly's going to win. Next day, Michael's going to win. Next day, Vitaly's going to win. At this point, I don't even know. Yeah, but that is the beauty. That's the beauty of arm wrestling, you know. And, yeah, I'm not, like, sure either about anything about that match.
SPEAKER_00: because there is a possibility Vitaly Laletin to flash-win him, and there is a possibility Michael to stop him. And nobody can convince me that if that match stops, it will be very...
SPEAKER_00: mean easy for vitale i mean i don't think so it's not going to be easy for either yeah yeah but but i'm just saying that once there are some people they are like really their or all existence is based on somehow i don't know why i hate michael i mean i i understand that you know sometimes he pulls that way but we made the rule you know as long as this is not like down angle it's okay you know
SPEAKER_00: And he's not the only one who is playing that way and who is... Hello again, Adi. How are you? Good, good. How are you? Good, good. Opana. Opana. Yeah, Opana, you need to just like stop somewhere and then join, you know. You are going to have accidents.
SPEAKER_04: I'm very, very good. Very, very good. Thank you very much, Gennady. It's good to see you. What is your weight now, Gennady? He's going to be home in two minutes.
SPEAKER_04: He's 133 kg. How do you feel about the weight loss? I'm sorry, but it's not a problem.
SPEAKER_00: know i i diet i lose my weight properly and i i don't really see a difference good good good good good yeah um ibrahim can you talk with ibrahim like i think he's there his his microphone is off it was off and now but the microphone is off i think he can still hear you um
SPEAKER_01: I don't know why we cannot say him, but anyway. So, Gennady, how is life? How is everything? How is bicep? How is everything? Everything is fine. Everything is fine. Everything is fine. Everything is fine. Everything is fine. Everything is fine. Everything is fine.
SPEAKER_04: No, everything's good. After a match with Devon, I thought maybe I will get some pain again, but I didn't. Everything's very good and I like it. Yeah. Salam alaikum, Ibrahim. Wa alaikum salam. How are you? How are you? How are you? Gennady, how are you? Good, good, friend. How are you? I'm good, I'm good. I'm good. Okay, okay.
SPEAKER_02: Good, good, good. Yeah, yeah. How is the form, Ibrahim? How is the form? How do you feel? I don't know. I think it's a good form. I had a good rest. Six months, I think. I recovered. There were some small injuries.
SPEAKER_02: Now I feel fine. The only thing is that it was Ramadan month and I was fasting for a month. During this month, let's say, I didn't manage to work with weights properly, but now everything seems to be fine.
SPEAKER_04: Now I think everything's good. I feel good. The Ramadan I couldn't really train properly, but after that I started again. I had some minor injuries, but everything's good now. Yeah. Should we expect him to be in a shape that he was against Reno?
SPEAKER_02: When we see you during the match, will you be in shape like you were against Rin? I don't think so. I think I'll be in better shape now. I've gained weight. I've gained a lot of weight. I've gained a lot of weight.
SPEAKER_02: As far as I remember, I never weighed 124-125 kg. Now I gained weight, I think I'm more resilient, I did cardio, and now I do it. Well, my shape will be better than Rin's, I think. I think so.
SPEAKER_04: I think the shape is going to be better than Reno match. I've never been this heavy. I'm around 125 kilograms. I was never this big. I work on cardio as well, work on my endurance. I feel pretty good and I would expect my shape and I think that it's going to be better than Reno match. Okay. And Gennady, how is your mood? How is your psychology? You made a return.
SPEAKER_00: and you had lost two matches, now you are trying a different category. Did those defeats have any negative effect?
SPEAKER_04: on your mood. How do you feel about it? How do you feel about it? How do you feel about it? Did it have a negative effect on you? No, no, it didn't have a negative effect on me.
SPEAKER_01: For me, in terms of sports, I don't mind at all. That's my opinion. I don't mind because of my biceps. Well, as I said, it's not a matter of whether you like it or not, it's not a matter of whether you like it or not, it's a matter of whether you like it or not, it's a matter of whether you like it or not, it's a matter of whether you like it or not, it's a matter of whether you like it or not.
SPEAKER_01: My opinion is that the state of the state is not as it used to be, as it used to be, and as it used to be. The state is not as it used to be, as it used to be, and the state is not as it used to be, as it used to be, and the state is not as it used to be, and the state is not as it used to be, and the state is not as it used to be, and the state is not as it used to be, and the state is not as it used to be, and the state is not as it used to be, and the state is not as it used to be, and the state is not as it used to be, and the state is not as it used to be, and the state is not as it used to be, and the state is not as it used to be, and the state is not as it used to be, and the state is not as it used to be, and the state is not as it used to be, and the state is not as it
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, nothing negative at all. For me, it's just sport. For me, it's experience. I don't see anything very bad in losing. It's just another day for me, another experience. The biceps after the tear, you know, you work on it, the pain, the weight loss.
SPEAKER_04: I have experience. This is nothing new to me. I lost weight countless times. And sure, I haven't done it in a while. But still, I'm not going to lose weight too early or too late. I'm going to do it perfectly on match day. And where is patience? There is perfect weight.
SPEAKER_04: For him, this challenge is just another day. This challenge is nothing new for him. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And he has won WAP Worlds, right? At 110 kilos before. 110 in Worlds and 100 in Europeans. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And Gennady, what do you think about this upcoming match against Ibrahim Sago? What do you think about the match against Ibrahim? Well, Ibrahim is a very important sponsor, a sportsman. He is the finalist of this tournament.
SPEAKER_01: I think it will be a good match because I have a very good feeling about the way Magis' form is playing in my opinion, as it is in our opinion, as it is in the opinion of the audience. But Ibrahim's defeat against Sam Kamri, against Sam Dzuhar,
SPEAKER_04: He's very strong, obviously. He's younger than me. The tempo that he's growing at is astonishing. He's one of the top guys in 115, basically the finalist. But he will have to give away the belt. Of course, we, George and him, are good friends. But at the table, we are doing our best. It's not going to be an easy match.
SPEAKER_01: First of all, in my opinion, it will be very difficult. But in all areas it will be very difficult. It will be very difficult. But our country will have the same system as the Caucasians in one way or another. It will not be as easy as it was with Larratt. It will be very difficult, but it will be.
SPEAKER_04: For me, this is probably the first friendly match. It's different. The Caucasian people, we have respect between each other. I respect Ibrahim greatly, but at the table, it's going to be an all-out war. No restrictions, but full respect, you know.
SPEAKER_04: Do you want to translate a little to Ibrahim? Quickly, because I think he was speaking Georgian. I will quickly translate what you said. He asked Gennady how he feels about the match. He said that Ibrahim is a very strong opponent, you are young, you have a high pace of development, you are developing, you are one of the finalists in 115 kg, so to speak, one of the strongest.
SPEAKER_04: How do you see this match? First of all,
SPEAKER_02: Thank you very much. You want to go too, don't you? First of all, I am very grateful to Gennady for accepting this match. For me, it's an honor to fight with such a... Well, for me, Gennady was very strong. I always considered him very tough and strong.
SPEAKER_02: Well, it's an honor for me to fight with such a legendary athlete, so to speak. And I'm glad that I'm at such a level, so to speak, that athletes like Gennady agree to fight with me, to play a match with me. I think Gennady is very strong. To be honest, I don't even know. The belt is needed, yes, for everyone, that's one hundred percent.
SPEAKER_02: It will be very difficult. For my entire career, as I posted on Instagram, for my entire career with such a strong opponent, I probably haven't managed to fight yet. This will be the most difficult fight of my career, so to speak. Even, perhaps, I don't know, if I even win, if I even lose, for me it will not be particularly offensive if I lose.
SPEAKER_02: Because I'm afraid of one of the strongest athletes. I don't know. I don't know.
SPEAKER_04: you know for me it's a great honor that i have this match that i'm at that level where an opponent a legend for me as as gennady accepts that match with me he comes to my weight class and we have this great fight i'm very thankful for that and for me it's a great honor to pull against gennady of course everyone wants a belt everyone needs a belt but even if i win or lose
SPEAKER_04: I won't feel dissatisfied. I won't be disappointed if I lose. Because even having a match like me, I posted many times that for me, this is going to be the hardest fight of my life. And I'm greatly, greatly honored to pull Gennady.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. Hey, normally, normally I am, uh, I think the Gennady Gennady understands in Russian, right? He doesn't need to speak, but maybe when you translate, you translate in that way, what I say so that like they both understand we don't lose so much time, but, um, like normally as a promoter, I like to really steer the pot. Yeah. You understand?
SPEAKER_00: But I know both cultures and everything. And Sago is from Russia, but it is a different part of there. It is from Caucasus. It's just a little bit north of Georgia, in Russia. And so I know the culture. And I know the respect and everything. So I won't even try to attempt anything.
SPEAKER_00: I know that it is not the right thing to do, so people can expect a very pure arm wrestling only, with a lot of respect.
SPEAKER_04: I'll say it in Russian, because both of you will understand, to save time. He understands that, Evrakhim, you're from Ingushetia, very close to Georgia, very close to each other as brothers, you understand, and I won't even try to hook you up like this, to warm up the match, because I understand, it's a full fight at the table, but it's a different culture, I understand that, respect each other, and that's it.
SPEAKER_00: Everything is perfect. Thank you for understanding. Gennady, you said that the bicep is going well and everything.
SPEAKER_00: Do you think that this is
SPEAKER_00: stylistically, not a good matchup for you. Because of where Ibrahim is attacking is where you had the surgery two years ago, almost. And you can ask me, Engin, if you are thinking that way, there is a possibility, why did you set this match? It is because you said that you would only pull for a world title match in 115.
SPEAKER_00: while Ibrahim and Reno was head-to-head. So I thought since Reno is injured, Ibrahim is the one that really deserves that match since Devon is not pulling in 115 anytime soon, you know.
SPEAKER_04: As you said, you had a bicep surgery two years ago. Is your style different from your usual style? Because Ibrahimović is very good, and you don't have a problem with his style, do you think? Well, that's exactly my opinion. I think it's a good thing, and everyone knows that. I don't want to argue with you, but I think it's a good thing.
SPEAKER_01: I was very happy to see that I was able to do it. I was very happy to see that I was able to do it. I was very happy to see that I was able to do it. I was very happy to see that I was able to do it. I was very happy that I was able to do it.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know how to say it, but I don't know how to say it. I don't know how to say it, but I don't know how to say it.
SPEAKER_04: know that that's the challenge for me that's stylistical that the the lane he attacks at when i pulled devon um i felt that even if we go inside on biceps i would pull even better and even in last rounds i started to fight more and more but obviously devon came in a very good shape and flopping like triceps pressing that shape of devon is completely different task still i wouldn't say like it's just the same arm of course it isn't
SPEAKER_04: But I still, I lift very good weights. I feel good. And I wouldn't say I have to leave the sport just because I had a surgery. You know, I still feel very good. No, no, I know he is good. But I'm just thinking that, you know, maybe stylistically, it is exactly going there to that point. Yeah, he said that's the challenge. That's the interesting part. Even if he's there, he'll just gonna fight till the end. You know, just drag it out. Yeah. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah. And Ibrahim, how do you see your chances against Gennady? How do you see your chances against Gennady? I'll be honest with you. I've never lied. I've never said something that someone would like. I'll be honest with you. I see my chances. 60 to 40.
SPEAKER_02: Well, I think so. Maybe there will be another outcome of the fight. Well, I think Gennady is stronger, but I will fight to the end.
SPEAKER_04: I never lie to anyone in that regard. I always say what I feel like. And I never try to sound nice to people so they like it. I think it's a 60-40 for Gennady. I see him as a stronger opponent. But still, I will come there and I'll give my everything. I'll just fight till the end. I say what I feel, what I think.
SPEAKER_04: I just say it how it is, how I feel like, how I see it. I don't try to. No, no, I understand, yeah. And Ibrahim, do you think that the weight cut of Gennady will be your advantage? Of course.
SPEAKER_02: Most likely, yes, it's an advantage for me, but I don't think so. Well, some forces will go away if you just drop it. But Gennady can drop it and fight at the same level. I think so. Maybe this extra weight will be in his favor if he drops it. Maybe he will be faster, maybe he will carry it. I don't know. I don't think he will be weaker, much weaker if he drops it.
SPEAKER_02: For example, I fought AMC at 95 kg and at 105 kg. There were moments when I was stronger than 105 kg.
SPEAKER_04: know i would say yeah it's probably an advantage for me but it also depends how the weight cut goes maybe maybe gnadi is going to be even better off i think that when he loses the weight he'll retain most of the power he'll pull the same but who knows maybe he'll get even better maybe all that excess weight after he loses it's going to be better maybe he's going to be faster like let's say when i pulled amc in 95
SPEAKER_01: than 105. Sometimes I felt even better at 95. I was maybe stronger in some areas. And Gennady, how do you see your chances? How do you see your chances, Gennady? Well, I don't think I would have been able to win this round, but I think I could have won this round.
SPEAKER_01: I would like to thank everyone who supported me. This is my job. I would like to thank everyone who supported me, thank you very much. But for the people who are interested, it is not easy to do something like this. It is not easy to do something like this.
SPEAKER_01: In general, I am very happy to be here. I am very happy to be here. I am very happy to be here. I am very happy to be here. I am very happy to be here. I am very happy to be here. I am very happy to be here.
SPEAKER_01: It's not a big deal to be in the spotlight of a football team. It's not a big deal to be in the spotlight of a football team. It's not a big deal to be in the spotlight of a football team. It's not a big deal to be in the spotlight of a football team. It's not a big deal to be in the spotlight of a football team. It's not a big deal to be in the spotlight of a football team.
SPEAKER_01: Of course, it can be a dangerous moment, but I won't let it happen. That's how it is in this sport and I'm very happy that I was able to do it and our team managed to do it. That's why, as I said, the team will be with me because it's a very important part of the sports career.
SPEAKER_01: If I had a new opponent in 2015, and I had a new opponent in 2015, and I had a new opponent in 2015, and I had a new opponent in 2015, and I had a new opponent in 2015, and I had a new opponent in 2015, and I had a new opponent in 2015, and I had a new opponent in 2015, and I had a new opponent in 2015, and I had a new opponent in 2015, and I had a new opponent in 2015, and I had a new opponent in 2015, and I had a new opponent in 2015,
SPEAKER_04: I want to leave all the future talking away. I don't want to talk about chances and everything. I just want to say that this is probably going to be the craziest fight in the history of armwrestling and I wouldn't be surprised if it is. In all respect,
SPEAKER_04: we we talk calmly right now but at the table it's going to be completely different we train very hard i go there to win i don't say that i don't say anything difference i train and i go there to win but i'm sure that ibrahim does just the same he doesn't go there to lose he's he's getting ready and one of the reasons that i like ibrahim a lot i see myself in him uh this boy is he's just like me you know he he's not gonna uh stop he
SPEAKER_04: he doesn't go without the fight. He's just fight till the end. He may injure himself, but he still goes and goes and he doesn't rest without the fight. And I really like that about him. It's an honor for me as well. Just like he said before, it's an honor for me to pull against him. And I'm very thankful for this opportunity. You know, I see this as a step forward in my career. I fight for a belt in the new challenge and new weight division. And I'm thankful for this opportunity.
SPEAKER_04: I can promise people, I can promise everyone that this is going to be a great, great fight. Okay.
SPEAKER_04: Very quickly, can you translate so he would like to hear? I'll translate it for you too. He asked, what chances do you see? He said, we'll let it go for the future. I train to win, you also train to win. We both go there to fight as seriously as possible. Now we're talking to each other calmly, but behind the table everything will be within the framework of respect, of course, but as hard as possible.
SPEAKER_04: And with the maximum spirit, so to speak. For him, just like you said, it's also an honor to fight against you. This is the next step in his career. This is a new division, a belt. These are great opportunities. And he sees you in you.
SPEAKER_04: You know, I look at him and I see that he will never let go, he will never stop. Even if he gets injured, he will fight to the end and will never give up without a fight. I can promise everyone that it will be a very difficult fight and, perhaps, the hottest fight in history.
SPEAKER_00: okay since there will not be any trash talk uh let's let's talk about the predictions uh about the upcoming event um let's start let's start with um rustam babaev and uh tata chinks
SPEAKER_04: Ibrahim, first, I guess. Since there will be no trash talk, let's move on to the matches, to look at them as opinions. Todd Hutchings and Rustam Babaev for the title of Borisov-95 on the right hand. Well, I don't know how now, well, this Babaev, earlier he won, Todd. But earlier Todd Prudnik won. All who, well, Todd, who won, he now...
SPEAKER_02: He wins 3-0. I don't know about Rustam, in what form he is now. Judging by his weight, he raises good weights. But I still bet on Tadzio. That's what I think.
SPEAKER_04: I'm not sure about Rustam's shape. When I look at his weights, it seems like he looks pretty well. But for Tad, I would say, you know, the people that he lost to before, like, let's say, Prudnik, he came back and he won against him 3-0. So he got a lot of rematches, and I see that he's getting better and better. And I would say Tadzil is the favorite for me. So he says that he's favorite. Yeah. And Gennady? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
SPEAKER_00: I think Rustam's going to win. Okay. And let's talk...
SPEAKER_04: Mindaugas vs. Artur Makarov. Mindaugas vs. Artur Makarov. You mean Prokopchuk, right? Sorry, sorry. Daniel Prokopchuk vs. Artur Makarov. Daniel Prokopchuk vs. Artur Makarov for the belt. You know what I think. Everyone says Prokopchuk beat Alan, Alan beat Makarov.
SPEAKER_02: I think the opponents are more difficult. Maybe Makarov is not comfortable with Prokopchuk. I bet on Makarov. I want him to win and I think he will win. Prokopchuk is also very strong. I bet on Makarov.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I think, you know how a lot of people say that Prokopchuk beats Alan and Alan beats Makarov. So Prokopchuk should win. I don't really see it that way. I think maybe Prokopchuk is going to be uncomfortable with Makarov. Of course, Prokopchuk is very strong and I respect both of them. But I see Makarov as a favorite here. I want him to win and I think he's going to win. Yeah, tell them that, you know, I said Bindagas versus, I think, Arthur Arsene.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah. Yeah. It is because I want to return and I want, I want to just beat the shit out of them in Douglas. So that's probably why, you know, yeah. Yeah. And again, I. Can I go pick up? Yeah. Um, I'll call you.
SPEAKER_04: he said that it's very difficult i don't really know and i don't know but probably makarov in if he's in very good shape i think makarov okay
SPEAKER_02: And Pauline versus David Samusha. Pauline versus David Samusha in 95 kilograms on the right hand. They fought before, right? Yes, the first match. Paul won. I don't know. Maybe I'll win too. I don't know. Samusha rises in 95. Yes.
SPEAKER_04: I don't know. Well, 50-50, let's say. He isn't sure the first time Paul won, Samush is coming up to 95. David won, to be honest. I want to. But I think Paul is a little stronger. Well, 50-50, let's say. No, I would say 50-50. I want David to win, but I think Paul may be stronger than him. But still, I would say 50-50.
SPEAKER_04: No, obviously I want Samusha to win a lot, but I would say it's a tough match and I think it's a 50-50. They said it's a close match again. Okay.
SPEAKER_04: Okay, so let's go to Dzeranov vs. Kamil Yablonsky. Kamil Yablonsky vs. Dzeranov. I think Dzeranov. I think Dzeranov. Yanadi? I don't know. I don't know. Georgi Dzeranov vs. Kamil Yablonsky. I think Dzeranov. What's your name?
SPEAKER_04: No, it's lefty. So I'm not so sure about Zeranoff's shape right now. So I would leave it at a 50-50. So I'm not so sure about Zeranoff's shape. Okay, if Zeranoff would be in his best shape?
SPEAKER_04: If he's left is as good as his right, of course, he's gonna win against. Oh, these are his favorites, he says? If he's left is as good as his right. Yes. Okay. Okay. Matt Mask. Matt Mask.
SPEAKER_01: It will be a very interesting fight.
SPEAKER_04: Well, maybe it will be a match between a 2-meter man and a 3-meter man. Gennady says Nugo is going to win for sure, but it's a very interesting match because it's a 1.5 meter guy against a 2-meter guy. So it's going to be very, very interesting. And Gennady is saying that Porsche Nugo is going to win? I don't know what to say, Nugo. I want to say, Alex.
SPEAKER_02: I've been wanting to fight with a mask for a long time. I'm just saying. I like to fight with such masks.
SPEAKER_04: You know, it's for a very long time, Ibrahim says that I really want to pull Matt Mask because he's talking so much and he's so fired up. I like to pull people like him. Oh, really? You wouldn't get upset because of him being so loud and aggressive? I'm very aggressive, twice as much as he is.
SPEAKER_04: I'll make him calm. Against aggressive guys like this, I'm very strong. Okay, so he says that he's gonna beat Matt and then make him calm. Of course. Two in one.
SPEAKER_00: What do you mean? Two for one? Two for one. He's going to beat him and make him call. Oh, okay. Okay. Okay. Let, let, let mask right now. Uh, focus on Nugo. Yeah. We have now. Yeah. We have now. Yeah. We have now. Yeah. We have now.
SPEAKER_02: Sergey will not fight with the top, he will not even try. In his place, I would not try either, if I even knew how to fight. Well, I know how to fight with the top, so to speak. But... Ivan, I don't know, few people hit him with the top. Maybe someone from the heavyweights, yes, it turns out, in their investment. Probably there will be a fight in the hook.
SPEAKER_02: Because of the speed, I think Vanya has a little advantage. Because of the speed. And so, everyone thinks that, well, they write comments, everyone thinks that Seryoga will lose. I wouldn't say, I wouldn't say. Seryoga is also very strong, his hook is also not weak, I stood with him. Because of the speed, I don't know, the advantage is in Vanya.
SPEAKER_02: Well, let's say 50-50. 50-50.
SPEAKER_04: you know i would say uh ivan's wrist is very good and if i was sergey i wouldn't even try to top roll yeah if i could because it's a bad idea i don't think anyone can really top pro even maybe in super heavies but in his weight class i don't think so but i see a lot of people say that uh you know sergey is gonna lose like three zero i don't think so sergey's hook is very very good and maybe
SPEAKER_04: Only because of speed, I would say he's a bit better than him. But still, I would say Sergi has a lot of chance. I would leave it as a 50-50. It's a very good match. Gennady? What do you think? Ivan Matushenko vs Sergei Kalinchenko. Kalinchenko in the 15th. Matushenko vs Matushenko in the 15th.
SPEAKER_00: Everyone from my generation, I respect them. And Jocelyn Brisson, she's from Canada. She recently beat Sarah Beckman.
SPEAKER_00: 3-0 in Arlington at the East vs. West 17. And she's now going to pull against Egle, White Cooter. Do they have a prediction for this match? Jocelyn Force won against Sarah at the last East vs. West. And she's going to fight against Egle, White Cooter. Do you have any predictions?
SPEAKER_04: i don't really have predictions i don't really follow female arm wrestling so i don't really know what to say
SPEAKER_04: You know, Egle is strong, very strong athlete, but Jocelyn beat Sara 3-0. It's a pretty big achievement. I would say it's a 50-50 match. It's close. I understand. Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Let's talk about Michael Todd versus Vitaly Laletin. Michael Todd with Vitaly Laletin on the right. How hard, how difficult do you think it is to flash pin someone like Michael? Not only Vitaly, but how many times do you remember people flash pinning Michael?
SPEAKER_04: I have a question for you, Ibrahim. How difficult is it for you to put Michael in touch? Not only for Vitaly, but in general. Maybe there are some examples. What do you think? In touch? Who called him? In touch? I don't know. I remember who he fought with. I remember Alexey Voevoda.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, 20 years ago. But at that time, Michael wasn't doing open arm top roll. Now, different style, different technique. Now we'll see how fast he can win. I think Vitalik and he won't have time to turn on his... I don't know. To get into position, yeah. Yeah, yeah, Vitalik can.
SPEAKER_04: I think we would see how fast you can beat Michael right now because Vitaly is very fast and I'm pretty sure Michael won't be able to get in his position here. So he's saying that Vitaly is going to flash pin him three times in a row? I think so, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Does he think Vitaly is stronger than last a few years now? Last a few years? Last a few years, you know. Do you think Vitaly is stronger at the peak of his form than he was in the last few years? I think at the peak his weight is 150 kg. He was never that big. Now he's at the peak of his best form, I think.
SPEAKER_04: I would say he is probably in his peak form right now. Very big. 150 kilograms. I've never seen him like this. I would probably say this is the strongest Vitaly. And one more question before we go to Gennady. What if the match stops? What if the match stops? What do you think? If Michael can stop him. Me? Yes, yes.
SPEAKER_02: Well, if he can stop, probably... Vitaly's press is not particularly developed, right? But the last time with Artem, I think he pressed him in the press. Yes, on the left. Yes. If he prepared the press against Michael, I think he can also press. But if he stops, it will be hard. It will be very problematic for Vitaly. I think...
SPEAKER_03: So it's very, very good.
SPEAKER_04: I think it's very difficult if he gets stopped because I wouldn't say Vitaly's press is really developed. We see him press more often than some lefty. Maybe if he's training press right now, getting very ready for Michael, then he may be able to finish it. But I expect it to be very, very hard and he may lose if the match gets stopped. He's saying that Vitaly better win quick. That's what he's saying.
SPEAKER_00: Well, in short, it's better to beat Vitaly as quickly as possible. Yes, absolutely. Yep, for sure. There is a super chat. GRS Sergio. Sorry for the off-topic message. I just wanted to ask. I ordered an East Versus 17 shirt on March 29th and haven't received any update or tracking number. I tried contacting support, but
SPEAKER_00: got no reply can someone help me yes my friend i think you sent a message without super chat and i already forwarded this to the team to to contact you yeah thank you and sorry about it um and gennady what's your opinion
SPEAKER_04: I think Vitaly has some troubles in this match because he usually encounters a lot of problems against someone who pulls in this position.
SPEAKER_04: I think Vitaly has some problems in this matchup. He usually has difficulties when he gets stopped in this position against people who pull like this. Yeah, and does he think that, like, what is the percentage that, you know, that match is going to stop? Hmm?
SPEAKER_04: It's going to stop for sure, 100%. Okay, so he's saying that the match is going to stop and Michael is going to win or he's saying that match is going to stop and Michael has more chance to win?
SPEAKER_04: I think he has a lot of chances because he will stop the match against Vitaly, but the question is how strong Vitaly's flop is going to be when he presses him. Can history ever remember when Michael's hand wasn't stopped?
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, yeah, this is what I'm saying. When he got in shape, you know, the recent Michael, that he's very strong, like, can anyone remember when he got stopped? Not stopped. Yeah, I understand what you're saying, yeah. And what did Gennady think about Michael vs. Ermes match? Ermes vs. Ermes? I don't know.
SPEAKER_00: It wasn't just as I thought. I would say it was a good match, interesting, but I wasn't surprised really. Let's talk about the main event of the next East vs. West will be in the US.
SPEAKER_04: And I want to ask Ibrahim Sago, how does he see the match between Hermes and Levan? Well, everyone is waiting for this fight.
SPEAKER_02: What do you think? What do you think will happen? I think that Levan will win. When they fought against Levan in the last round, everyone thought that Levan would win.
SPEAKER_02: In the near future, someone in Lebanon will win. I have such an opinion. And I don't think that Hermes will take the same round as Lebanon. Hermes is already very strong, of course. But I don't think so. The weight is small. I don't know. Very powerful Lebanon. Too powerful. Too strong.
SPEAKER_04: Everyone's waiting for this match. I've seen a lot of people talk about Levan's first match that he needed oxygen tank in the last rounds. He had some problems with cardio. But I would say Levan's probably going to win. He's too big, too strong. I don't think Ermias is going to win even a round. Of course, I respect him greatly, but I don't think he's big enough against Levan. He's just too light.
SPEAKER_04: And Gennady? What do you think about Messi and Levani? Levani is going to win. 100% Levani is going to win. And one other question.
SPEAKER_00: Let me ask to Gennady first. Gennady, what if Vitaly and Devon pulls? Let's start with Devon and then Vitaly. How are you? I'm good, I'm good. I think we have a good plan.
SPEAKER_04: It's very hard. I'm not so sure. But I would say generally, it's very, very hard to top roll against Devin and I would say he probably wins.
SPEAKER_04: So he thinks that it's a tough match, but it's very hard to top roll Devon, so Devon will probably win. Yes, it's a tough match, but it's a tough match against Devon, and there's a good chance that he won't make it to Italy, to Devon's team. To Devon's team? In English, it's 8-8. Yes, it's 8-8. It's a tough match, but he won't make it to Italy.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, he won't be able to go outside without problem. So he cannot topple Devon, okay. And what do you think, Ibrahim, if they pull? If Vitaly and Devon fight, how do you think it will go? To the right, you mean? Yeah, yeah. I think Vitaly will take the first two rounds, but then maybe, I don't know, Devon
SPEAKER_02: the first two rounds for Italy, I think so then where he can surprise of course
SPEAKER_00: I think first two rounds Vitaly is probably going to win. But then Devin may be able to get in his position. Maybe get in the king's move and surprise people. But I would say first two rounds I will go for Vitaly. I understand. Anyways, guys. Thank you very, very much for being our guests. And I see you guys in three and a half weeks in Istanbul.
