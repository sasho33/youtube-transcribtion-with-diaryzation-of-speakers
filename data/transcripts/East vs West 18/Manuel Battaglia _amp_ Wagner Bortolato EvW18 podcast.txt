SPEAKER_02: A lazy translator. Let's see who is the translator of Manuel. My lady. Wagner, do you know who will be Manuel's translator? Do you know who will be Manuel's translator? I don't know.
SPEAKER_02: Gasparini. Gasparini has two minutes. So I think he will join us. So let's start with you Wagner since your translator, or I should say girlfriend is here. And so how is everything Wagner? Long time, long time injuries and some
SPEAKER_04: Bad luck. So how are you now? Now he feels ready. Now he feels confident. And OK, now he's back. So he's back. Is he going to destroy Manuel? That's the plan.

SPEAKER_02: So, Manuel, you ready? Good form? Ready, ready. Ready? Manuel, what is your weight? How many kilo you are?
SPEAKER_02: 150.50. Error. Balance. Error. I asked him his weight. He says 150 and error. No more choice. And Wagner, what's your weight?
SPEAKER_04: Focus on this. The same. 156 and some scales give the error message as well. Error as well. OK. What's that? Spaghetti. Spaghetti pizza. Spaghetti pizza. Yeah. I've made it though. Hello, Hermes.
SPEAKER_09: Bortolato is from Veneto. Veneto? Veneto is the region of Italy. No, is he really from there? Really? He's not original Brazilian? No. He was born in Brazil, but his grandparents are from Italy. Yes. It's where I live, Veneto. I live in Veneto, me too.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, so I need to deal with three Italians tonight. Wagner, do you speak any Italian? Mangiare, mangiare. Just mangiare. Mangiare means eating, you know, eating. It means eating?
SPEAKER_02: Eating, yes. Just this that Wagner knows how to speak in Italian. Okay, so this guy only knows what to eat in Italian? Only. Okay. Manuel, did you know that Wagner is originally from Italy? Did you know that? He's originally from Italy, not Trieste.
SPEAKER_09: Treviso. Did you know, he said, that he was originally from Italy? From Treviso? From Treviso. No, from Veneto. Did you know or not? Yes, yes, you told me before. He said yes. Oh, he knew already. Wow.
SPEAKER_02: But the last name, Portolato, is it Brazilian last name or Italian last name? Italian. Italian, wow. He still has roots with the last name. Okay. Yes. That's interesting. That's very interesting. I didn't know that. And Hermes, before you came, I asked Wagner, will you destroy Manuel?
SPEAKER_02: And he said, that's the plan. And Manuel said, not possible. Yeah. Not possible, my friend. Not possible. And Hermes, you know Wagner very well. And since both are Italian, so, like, who is winning this match? You pulled with Wagner before. Do you think that it is a close match or someone is favorite? I think it's close because...
SPEAKER_09: Depends who will be faster. If Bortolato will be faster, he will go with the shoulder, with the press, for Manuel it's very difficult. But if Manuel will be faster than him, for sure about the hand, Manuel is stronger.
SPEAKER_09: I think if Manuel can pull very fast in his position, he can win. Ok, ok. Ok, now I've heard the link, so let me focus here. He doesn't remember, but it was my first shot in the World Cup.
SPEAKER_09: He said it was the first match in the WAF. You fought already with Emmanuel. When? Which year? In Poland. In Poland. They already fought in Poland. Okay, Poland. Which year was it? 2013? 2013 in Gdynia.
SPEAKER_02: OK, 2013, Wagner, you already beat him once. I think at that time Wagner won, is that correct? If Wagner...
SPEAKER_09: Yeah, he won, but he started one year before to do armwrestling. Oh, Manuel was very, very, very young. Yeah. When you were in Poland, Manuel started right after you were in Poland. He remembers. He doesn't remember because I was crazy.
SPEAKER_09: He don't remember, he said he don't remember because he was too weak and not famous.
SPEAKER_09: This situation happened the same to me in Brazil. I showed the people, they see the screen, they see when there are with the Italian, they laughed like crazy. Oh, you are lucky, you will win easy, blah, blah, blah.
SPEAKER_09: I felt things, because Italian in World Armwrestling, not very strong, you know, like Russia. I remember like, yes, I felt super angry inside. I crushed this guy like nothing, because we are gladiators, you know. You can't go against us owners.
SPEAKER_02: Yes, because it was weird to see Italians doing something. Weird. Okay. I think, who was the most famous Italian before you, Hermes? Emanuele Bruni? That's right. Emanuele Bruni, yeah. Wagner, do you remember the time that you beat Emanuele? Or not? Do you remember when you beat Emanuele? I don't remember, no. He doesn't remember.
SPEAKER_09: He doesn't remember. He doesn't remember. Hermes, can you ask Manuel? Is it finally time for revenge? It's finally time for revenge. Yes, also because he weighs a lot more than before. Yes, because now his weight is... How much is it? 50 kilos more?
SPEAKER_09: His weight is more than 40 kilos more than last time. The mind is the same. Baba, listen, was it like 110 kilo category? Or was it super weight?
SPEAKER_02: No, I did plus. Plus? Oh, okay. I always did plus. Okay. Do you remember, Wagner, your weight when you competed in 2013 in Poland? Do you remember your weight? I remember when you competed there in 2013. 125. 125. So, Wagner is also at least 25, 30 kilos heavier than before.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah. Oh, how he can grow like this. I can't. I can't. Why? Don't understand. Bread, bread, bread, bread, bread, pizza, spaghetti.
SPEAKER_02: Me. Can you ask Wagner if he likes Italian food in Rio? He loves, really. I have never cooked so much in my life. You what? I cook here. So I have never cooked so much in my life, really. Because he eats a lot. Yeah, but you say he likes Italian food, right? He likes Italian food.
SPEAKER_09: Oh, okay. Who don't like my friend? What is it this question? Everybody like, if nobody, someone don't like Italian food is something crazy. Something is wrong. Impossible don't like Italian food. Yeah. Okay. Hermes, are you or Italian foods more likable?
SPEAKER_09: What? You are more likeable or Italian food is more likeable? Me, of course. Too much. What's he saying? He likes cheese of goat. Cheese of goat.
SPEAKER_06: Thank you very much.
SPEAKER_09: Hermes, what does he say? Translate. You are translating, you are not a translator. Yeah, but he's saying something that doesn't make sense. Oh, it's okay, let us decide. Maybe you are not smart enough to understand and I will understand. He's saying he's the owner of Buntakaprina, his factory, his farm.
SPEAKER_09: Parma, Parma. Parma of Bontacaprina is the name. Bontacaprina. Okay. He is doing cheese and milk and yogurt of all calcium and protein and everything, you know, and power, huh? Italian power.
SPEAKER_09: Training! Training for the fingers! He starts at 4am to work and he finishes at 8pm. How long will he get rest before the competition?
SPEAKER_02: When he will go to Chicago. Okay, he will finish his job and go to the airport. And which day he is leaving? Wednesday or Tuesday he leaves Italy? Wednesday. Oh, Wednesday. Do you guys go together or? No, me Tuesday. Oh, you Tuesday. Okay.
SPEAKER_09: Perlustrazione. In perlustrazione vai a rimasci. I will see before the perlustration. I don't know the words. Ma non dire robe troppo difficili. Too much difficult words. I know English, but not too much. Not this vocabulary.
SPEAKER_02: OK, then instead of $1,000, I will give you only $500 for translation. I'm not satisfied with your translation. OK, my friend. Wagner, like, when was your last time, your right arm match? You pulled your last match against Tobias? Like mask. Tobias, no, left arm. Left or right? Left. Left was Tobias.
SPEAKER_04: So it is about one year, right? One year he didn't have a match. Almost one year and a half. It was in February of last year. Yes. He had some problems with his arm.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah. He got injured. The ligament. Yes. Ligamento. Fortunato. Okay. Are you guys going to have a conversation in the translation? Yeah, yeah. It's okay. A little bit. Some words in Portuguese is similar to Italian, so a little bit we can understand. Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, okay. Anyways, so one year and after one year you are just pulling Wagner. Do you feel ready physically and mentally, psychologically? How do you feel?
SPEAKER_04: Are you feeling well, mentally, psychologically, physically? It's very complete. Physically, psychologically, it's very complete. Yes, and this year he has been working a lot. The three aspects, the mental, the physical, especially physical. He has been doing physiotherapy, treatment with doctors. One year of treatment.
SPEAKER_02: So he has been working also the psychological part as well. Now he's feeling ready. Now he's okay. And like he is ready for Manuel as his first match. He's happy to have such opponent. Manuel is also World Champion and Wagner is multiple times World Champion. And how does he see his own chance against Manuel? But just tell him to be not to be humble. Tell us however he feels.
SPEAKER_04: Ok, how are you feeling about facing Manuel? Because he is also a champion of the UFC, you are also a multiple world champion, but he is also a high level opponent. How are you feeling about facing him? I've already watched some of his matches and I saw that he's very good, he's coming back from the top. It's going to be a great fight, and depending on the result, there will always be some respect. And I believe it's going to be a great fight.
SPEAKER_04: He has been observing his videos and the fights and he observed that he's a very strong guy. He saw the top role and some techniques used by him. And he believes that it's going to be an amazing fight. And anyway, about the result, he will have always his respect because he saw that he's a guy, a great guy.
SPEAKER_09: I want to ask you, you know, you are a shoulder presser.
SPEAKER_11: And you say that it is going to be a great match. Like, do you think that you will be able to apply your power and it will be a great match? Or do you think he will take your wrist and you think that it will be a great match that way? Like, do you think it will be a great match if you get your own position?
SPEAKER_04: Do you think it's going to be a big fight, if you can do your game, or if you're going to have to use other strategies to be able to push his hand, to change your game in some way? How do you think this is going to happen? I think, regardless of anything, I'm going to have to use other strategies as well. But it all depends on the time I get his hand.
SPEAKER_04: And he said that he's training more strategies than just the ones he used before. So he will decide what will be the best thing to do in the moment that he grabbed his hand, in the moment of the fight. Because until now, he has been using these techniques, but he has been developing more, more techniques to improve more techniques, not just the ones he used to use.
SPEAKER_02: After his injury, does he have problem to apply his own technique? Because I don't remember with left arm he is doing anything else than the shoulder press. Ermes, do you remember him doing with left arm any other successful technique than the shoulder press?
SPEAKER_04: Okay. Yeah. No, it's not because of the injury. He wants to learn more techniques to apply really, you know, to change a little the style, to learn how to handle and improve on the table.
SPEAKER_04: The press continues being a favorite, but he has more strategies now. He said he has new strategies to be his favorite technique. I have also trained in points where I do worse. Now I feel much better.
SPEAKER_09: He said he is training more on his weak point. Now he is super strong. Ok, what was Manuel's weak point? What are your weak points, Manuel? The press can be a weak point for me. But I studied it. The press is the most dangerous.
SPEAKER_09: position for him but he already studied this technique how to beat this technique ok, does Manuel think that he can take Wagner's risk and Wagner will continue that way? how does he expect match to go?
SPEAKER_09: He will never open his wrist. His wrist is like a metal. No, no, I'm not saying Wagner is going to take Manuel's wrist. I'm saying that does Manuel expect that he's going to take Wagner's wrist?
SPEAKER_09: Messi is a pretty pushover. He said he will fight with open hands. Wagner will fight with open hands? Yes. Ok, so Manuel is confident that he will take Wagner's risk? 100%. 100%.
SPEAKER_02: Wow, that's interesting to hear. But I never saw Wagner pull with an open hand. I think I saw him with Devon, like this, one round. Ah, yes. With Devon, yes. With Devon he did. What is the name of this movement with the open hand?
SPEAKER_02: But this, this is dead wrist pressure or some, some, some people cause flop wrist, you know, but it is just like dead wrist press, you know. Dead wrist pressure. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Press. Yeah. Press. Yeah. There is, there is a, there is a super chat. Christian Campanella. Hi Hermes, Manuel and Wagner. Greetings from Milan. Ciao Christian. Stay strong. Ciao.
SPEAKER_02: OK. OK, Wagner, Manuel says it is 100% your wrist is going to go this way. What do you think? Then he will bury him on the cushion. Oh!
SPEAKER_09: He never showed animal, insect, 150 kilo insect. Okay, who's the insect here? Bortolato, he said he will crash like an insect. Okay, okay, okay. Wagner, you said you're going to crash him like this, bury him like this?
SPEAKER_09: And Manuel is saying that he is not a bug, you know, that you can crash like this. No, he is not an insect that you can crash like this. No, he is not. But don't worry, I will crash like this. But it will be like this. Oh, it will be like that. Oh, cool. Keep saying that it destroys you. Come on, no. No, no, no. It doesn't destroy me. What should I say?
SPEAKER_09: He will never, he's dreaming, said Manuel. He's dreaming, only dreaming in Porto Rurato. He's only dreaming, he said. Dreaming, dreaming, dreaming. Italians are dangerous. Say that Italy is dangerous. Italy is dangerous. Dangerous Italy. What is his nickname?
SPEAKER_09: What is your nickname? Roccia! Rock! Friend of Cholesterol! Friend of Cholesterol! You know Manuel in Italy is more famous for this than armwrestling?
SPEAKER_09: About cholesterol? Why? Why? Because he started one year ago to do a video with the bread. How do you say salami in English? Bread, salami, cheese. It's like a sausage. The salami is like a sausage.
SPEAKER_09: sausage okay and the two people and he he he eating one one sausage sausage sausage yeah oh okay but how big is it how big is it? very big and the people right in the coma you will die with the cholesterol

And he was just like, you know, like this. And so can you ask him, you know, what was the first time? When was the first time he competed? The first time you competed in WAF was in 2006 against Pushkar in Manchester.

And this guy just came and just destroyed everyone. Wow. I have a little pushkar. Invictus. Invictus, left Invictus.
SPEAKER_04: Unbeatable. About the left hand was the unbeatable in the day. Brazil versus Latvia. The final. Puskar was still young. I mean, still very young, you know.
SPEAKER_02: I think first time I saw Pushkar, 2003 Europeans. He was junior, I think. And then 2004, 19. So he was like 21 years old. I think Pushkar was at that time 21 years old. Yeah. But still was strong. Yeah. And Wagner was 26. Pushkar was 21. Yeah. Something like this. Yes.
SPEAKER_02: when they competed, Wagner was 26 in that time. 26, okay. Yeah, 19 years old. Yeah, yeah, 2006. That was also first time I saw Krasimir Kostladinov. Krasimir was 18 years old after Hermes. He win, you know, he was just showing double biceps, you know, was like, ah, you know. I was like, who's this guy, you know? And then it became a legend, you know, he was 18 years. That was the first time I saw, yeah, Wagner and Krasimir.
SPEAKER_02: Me and you when we met the first time. You and I? Listen, I mean, we didn't really meet in person, I think, until you came to Istanbul 2021. But I was following you already. And like those 2013, 14, you know, like, like, like,
SPEAKER_02: all the junior competition, either Georgia or Kazakhstan, Russia, Bulgaria, Turkey, and like, and then one Italian, you know, just boom, you know, just one Italian. And we were like, and then Niyazi was showing me hanging, follow this Italian guy, follow this Italian guy, you know? And then 2015, I think you took second, but your opponent tested positive. And then you won the WUF in the senior. And then you beat Babayev in 2016?
SPEAKER_02: Yes. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I mean, I mean, I maybe you don't remember. Do you remember the post that I made like in 2020? I said, follow these guys. And then before I think, maybe before 2019. Yeah. Maybe 19. Yeah. You, Irakli and Mindagos. I said, watch these guys, you know, and then Mindagos won the East versus West world title. And then
SPEAKER_02: You won East vs West World title and Irakli won East vs West World title but you guys were just screaming like we are becoming superstars, you know? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, what next? You know something about armwrestling, maybe? What, what, what? You know something about armwrestling. Me? Ah, listen. Little bit. Not so much, not so much. But when I was in elementary school, we were doing some. And then
SPEAKER_02: Like they were taking my wrist and I was like... No, no. I mean, you know something about... No, no. I understand. But that's all I know. In elementary school, I was arm wrestling. That's all I know. And do you guys do any kind of sports? You know, like, what are you guys doing? Arm wrestling? What? And what are you guys doing? Like, we are just meeting each other. You are... What are you doing? What's your sport? Oh, me... Ping pong. Ping pong. Ping pong. Ping pong. Okay.
SPEAKER_06: okay okay okay because i i haven't heard any sport like armwrestling so yeah you see what is it why we are talking about people
SPEAKER_06: He asked me what I think will happen between Hermes and Levan.
SPEAKER_03: Look, I'm really rooting for Hermes. I hope he wins this challenge. But it's going to be hard because Levan is very well prepared. I know Hermes prepared a lot, but Levan is even more prepared to try to massacre Hermes. But I'm rooting for Hermes. Hermes, Wagner is cheering for you. But he thinks Levan is coming over prepared because I think he knows that you are going to give a lot of job
SPEAKER_04: a lot of work for him and I think you should be really over prepared as well but Wagner is cheering for you because until now you were the guy that really gave a hard work for Levan so it was really emotional watching you guys and he's cheering for you
SPEAKER_07: It's the moment. It's the moment. It's the moment. Thank you, my friend. Thank you. It's your moment, Hermes. He said it's your moment. Yeah. Let's hope. It's your moment. Yes. What the fuck? I'll be the translator. He said so. What's happening? Just translate.
SPEAKER_09: No, he said he will do for me translator. Because he understands a little bit because he is a semi of Italian words, more or less. Okay. Trip says Wagner is a golden heart beast. Love from Turkey.
SPEAKER_02: Do you think he will be able to open his wrist? That he will have this ability?
SPEAKER_04: I don't think so. He thinks he's not going to open his wrist or hand. He's confident that that's not going to happen. OK. OK, then I have to ask you... He said you'd never open his wrist. He was too strong. He said he'd lock you in like a baby. All right. All right, all right.
SPEAKER_02: Yes, yes, I see. I see. Surprise. Surprise. Surprise. Surprise is coming, Wagner. You be careful. But Wagner, let me ask you another question. You said it will be a very good match. Very good match. And we know that Manuel is a top roller. And you are saying that you will not lose your wrist. You will take him inside. So how is it going to be a very good match if you are taking him here?
SPEAKER_04: He thinks it can escape. It can be a case of escaping. Then, tie hands.
SPEAKER_09: He said if you want you can try to pull in toproll if you are a real man.
SPEAKER_09: If you are brave enough. Okay, once again, Manuel is asking Wagner to pull top row?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, if he's brave enough. No, no, listen, listen. What if Wagner asks Manuel, if you are brave enough, let's start in hook? He said, what happens if he asks you if you are brave enough to shoot inside, like him. Ah, well, yes. Yes, yes, it's changed. Now it's fine.
SPEAKER_02: He said, okay, no problem. No problem. Inside, outside, no, no, no. Look, look, Wagner is happy. Wagner is saying yes, yes. But I will tell you, Hermes, I will ask you another one. Manuel says, if you are brave, do top roll against me. It sounds from outside like Manuel
SPEAKER_02: is not confidence, because it sounds like Manuel thinks that he is in very big danger if Wagner is doing what he is doing, like inside. He said that if you say that, you are afraid, because you are not confident with yourself, it would seem as he says.
SPEAKER_09: It's because he's afraid of losing if he locks you up. No, I'm not afraid. No, Scari. I've never been afraid. Money and Scari, he never had.
SPEAKER_09: Ah, okay. No fear, also no money. No fear, yes. No money, no fear. He never had... He has a big farm. Is it his farm? Hermes, is it his farm? That farm is his farm? Yeah. And he says he doesn't have money. He has a huge farm, you know. No, but he's like in Italy, he's like...
SPEAKER_09: No, there's something, there are some words like... Oh, okay, okay, okay, yeah, yeah. When you talk, you talk like this, but it's not true, you know. Oh, okay, okay. Like an expression. Oh, okay, okay. But usually we use those expressions whenever it is fitting the subject. If he has money and saying this, okay, I still understand.
SPEAKER_09: I'm in Italy like this. All the people cry, but it's never true. Ok, ok, ok. So, Wagner, from this we understand that do not believe whatever Manuel says. I think this is what Hermes said. He said that Bortolato should never believe what you say. He said that he will put Bortolato like a soldier.
SPEAKER_09: In his bread, he will eat everything. He will eat him. He will what? He will put him on the bread and he will eat Bortolato. Oh, OK. So the next meal is the Bortolato sandwich.
SPEAKER_09: With Italian food. Sandwich. Sandwich. Sandwich. Ems, Wagner thought you were his friend, now you're going to cheer for him. What's that?
SPEAKER_09: Wagner thought you were his friend and now you are going to cheer for Manuel. Ah, Italia, my friend. He said I shouldn't cheer for you. He said because he's from Veneto, I should cheer for him. No, you should cheer for me. Exactly, I already said that.
SPEAKER_09: Ferrari, Ferrari. Two Ferrari. Two Ferrari. Quality, my friend. Okay, who is Ferrari? I don't understand. He said he is a Ferrari. E lui cos'è? Una panda.
SPEAKER_02: Fiat. He is a Ferrari and Bortolato Fiat. Oh, Fiat and Ferrari. Oh, Manuel is very confident. He considers himself Ferrari and Wagner is Fiat. And Manuel, what is Hermes? Lamborghini. Do you see? Pagani, Pagani.
SPEAKER_07: Hermes and Pagani! Maserati! Pagani! Formula 1! What's going to happen between Levan and Hermes? Italy always surprises the world in important competitions.
SPEAKER_02: Italy, the Italians, they shock the world every time in very big competitions. Okay, so the Italians will go to Chicago and then it will be 2-0. Hermes winner and Manuel winner? Yes. Italian winner. Okay. Hey, but listen, now you're gonna pull against Wagner. Father Spencer and Terence Hill. What?
SPEAKER_09: Butter Spencer and the Terence Field. Butter Spencer, you know Butter Spencer. Engie, you know Butter Spencer. He punched the film. Very big man.
SPEAKER_02: Bob Spencer. Oh, Bob Spencer with the beard. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. He had movies with Terence Hill, right? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. OK, who is Bob Spencer? Wagner? Manuel. Oh, Manuel is Bob Spencer. Oh, where is your beard? Hey, barba. Oh, OK. New model. OK. 2.0.
SPEAKER_09: Emanuele, listen, you say Italians are going to win, but Wagner is also Italian. Italians win, but Bortolotto is Italian. But he's out, he's out. After five years, he's out, out. He's not Italian anymore. He was born in Brazil, but the family comes from Italy.
SPEAKER_09: He will give some advantage to him. He will go closer on the pads. He will hold him a little bit after. He will play a little bit with Bortolani. He will give him some advantage because he is also in the room a little bit Italian, right? Yes.
SPEAKER_02: Are you being provoked by Manuel's confidence? Are you being provoked by Manuel's confidence? Are you being provoked by Manuel's confidence? Are you being provoked by Manuel's confidence? Are you being provoked by Manuel's confidence? Are you being provoked by Manuel's confidence? Are you being provoked by Manuel's confidence? Are you being provoked by Manuel's confidence?

Are you being provoked by Manuel's confidence? Are you being provoked by Manuel's confidence? Are you being prov
SPEAKER_09: Maybe he doesn't understand what will happen, he said. Oh, Wagner will not even realize what happened. No. What do you want to hit him, you know? What will you do to him, Manuel? Too much confidence can disturb the process. Too much confidence can disturb the process. He said you are arrogant, too much confidence won't work. I have to believe him, otherwise I won't do anything.
SPEAKER_09: He said that if he doesn't believe in himself, he will stay at home. But Manuel, Ernest doesn't say those kind of things about Levan, but he doesn't stay at home. What?
SPEAKER_09: Hermes is not as confident as you are, but he doesn't stay at home. He still goes to Chicago. He said I'm not as confident, but I still go to Chicago. No, no, Hermes is confident too. Me too, me too. Inside, inside. Inside Volcano, huh? Yeah, wait, wait. We'll be ready, my friend.
SPEAKER_02: Anyways, did you watch the mini family documentary of Levan? Yeah, beautiful.
SPEAKER_09: Beautiful. Did you see that Levan and his father, internationally, they support Italy as a team, other than Georgia, of course. Yeah, yeah. They love football. Juventus. Yeah. They love too much. One time, if we come in Italy, Juventus from Torino is very close to my city. OK. I and Levan come.

SPEAKER_02: He says that he is Bataglia's favourite armwrestler? No, no, no. What does he say? No, Bataglia is not the favourite. Manuel, after this match, do you think Wagner will become your fan?
SPEAKER_09: I took a double match and we went round 2-1. Ah, yes. Yes, yes. Did he say yes? Yes. He will remember his name very well after the match. Yes. OK. Hello, Engie. Today, my favorite is Manuel Bataglia.
SPEAKER_02: Ah, it's Manuel Batalha. What did he say? Manuel Batalha. He said what? Today my favourite armwrestler is Manuel Batalha. Oh, today his favourite armwrestler is Manuel Batalha? Yes. But only one minute ago he said no. So why did he change his mind? But now he changed his mind. Now he's the favourite. OK, so now Manuel Batalha is here, John Burzing, Devon and Hermes here. OK.
SPEAKER_02: Just to smash him in one week. Okay. Okay. Okay. Let's make a deal here. The one who loses after the event, when they do the interview, the one who loses will say like the winner's name, you know, he is my favorite Armwrestler. Do you accept?
SPEAKER_09: You said, Manuel, if you accept, whoever loses the match with the microphone will say, if you start, I should say Bortolato is my favorite armwrestler. Do you accept this challenge? Okay. Okay, no problem. Manuel says no problem. If you lose the match, you will say,
SPEAKER_07: Manuel is my favorite armwrestler. If Manuel loses, he will go... I'm upset. What?
SPEAKER_09: He said the people already know about Bortolato, he's already famous. I like to play ping pong with Bortolato. Are you playing ping pong with Bortolato?
SPEAKER_02: Imagine how strong wrist he has, with the 155kg guy, he is playing ping pong. Training, training. Training? Yeah, yeah. Manuel, do you think that you will be intimidated when Wagner goes like... You know, like this?
SPEAKER_09: He said that he will slap him before the fight. Whenever Wagner is going crazy and then Maria will look at him and start laughing, huh? No, no, he said that we go to slap him to encourage him.
SPEAKER_09: I will go to slap his face. Oh, Manuel is going to slap Wagner's face? No, no.
SPEAKER_09: What? I don't understand. He said, he asked to me if we go to slap Battaglia face. Oh, okay, okay. You want to go to slap Manuel? Okay. Manuel, Manuel, Manuel. Hermes is a man. He said he would slap me. He said he wanted to slap Bortolato.
SPEAKER_08: He died. He said he will take his beer and he will... And the summer sleep too. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. That's some funny, funny, funny stuff. Okay. Manuel, who's winning? Alex Kurdecha or Devon? Left arm. Kurdecha.
SPEAKER_02: Why Kurdeca? Why do you always say Kurdeca? Because I saw him in Poland and he was too strong.
SPEAKER_09: He said he saw him in Poland. He said he saw him in Poland one month ago and he said his wrist is too strong. Okay, Wagner, Kurdecia or Morozov? Right hand. Right hand. Morozov.
SPEAKER_02: And Fia or Elin, do you know them? I'm sure you know Fia, but do you know Elin? Fia, Fia. Fia, Fia. Fia, Fia, Fia. Okay. Seven times Fia. Okay. And everyone says Fia, Fia, so. Okay, so let's go to another one.
SPEAKER_02: Manuel, Wagner or Manuel? Maybe. Maybe. Come on, maybe. Okay, Ermes, ask Manuel. Only like 30 minutes ago, he was saying that like,
SPEAKER_09: He's going to do this and that now. He started doing this. If this program continues 30 more minutes, he's going to say Wagner is winning. It looks like it's going that way. He said that before you said he was confident. Now, 30 minutes later, you're saying he's equal. If it continues like this, in the next 30 minutes, you'll say Wagner wins.
SPEAKER_02: It's better for illusion. It's better for illusion. He's dreaming. Okay. Okay. Okay. Wagner, who's winning? Manuel or Wagner? Bortolato. Bortolato, yeah. Okay. Okay. Pauline versus...
SPEAKER_02: Arsene Kacetarian. Do you know them? I'm sure you know Pauline, but Arsene is young. Do you guys know? Manuel, do you know Arsene Kacetarian? He knows who Arsene is. Kacetarian, he knows. Yeah, Arsene.
SPEAKER_09: So he will beat Paulinho? He says he will beat Paulinho? Who is that guy? Arsene. Arsene. You don't know who he is. He doesn't know who Arsene Kacetarian is? You don't know who Arsene is? Yes, you know. Yes.

Arsene is winning oh Arsene is winning wow okay okay the same way Arsene will win but you said that he doesn't know who Arsene is well I said that he's confident with Arsene
SPEAKER_02: I'm wrong, I'm confused. Ivan Portela vs. Josep Meranto. Ivan, Ivan. Ivan? Portela wins. Portela, Portela. Wagner vs. Portela? Portela.
SPEAKER_02: So it is like Latin, you know, sports. Spanish, Italian. Yeah, okay. And so let me just remind myself the other messages. Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, Matt Mask versus Irakli. Matt Mask versus Irakli. Irakli. Irakli. Irakli. Irakli. Irakli. Irakli. Irakli left. Irakli left. And Wagner also say Irakli? Okay. Irakli. Okay. And then let's go to Michael Todd versus Dzaranov. Michael. Michael wins.

SPEAKER_02: Do you know Richard from South Africa who lives in Australia now? Yeah, Richard. Yes, he knows very well. And he said Wallace is going to win? Wallace is going to win, no? Wallace, Wallace.
SPEAKER_02: Wallace, okay, okay. So it looks like Manuel is really following Armwrestling. It looks like you are watching everything about Armwrestling. No, I watch the videos. He saw videos on YouTube. I understand, but only someone who follows can see those videos. There are many armwrestlers I'm asking and they have no idea who the guy is, you know. And I don't understand how... You are very passionate, I said.
SPEAKER_02: What do I watch? I don't like to watch football. He doesn't like football or other sports. OK. And Wagner? Wallace. Wallace, OK. And then this one is the last one. Ellen Ford versus Ryan Bellinger. I think that's how... I asked him before. Do you know them?
SPEAKER_02: Take it soon, oh Manuel. Ryan Bellinger. Ryan Bellinger. Oh, Ryan. Okay. And then Dino is asking a super chat. Hello, Hermes. You're looking small, he says. No, no, joking, joking. He says you look big.
SPEAKER_09: Yeah, okay. And do you guys have any message to the fans, to each other? Do you have a message for him or for the fans? For him, do you have a message for him?
SPEAKER_09: Do you have a message for him? Will he be sad not to be in Italy anymore? No. What should I say? I don't know, something. The last message before the challenge. Chicago, I'll wait for you in Chicago. Chicago at night. He will wait for me in Chicago.
SPEAKER_09: Okay. And after? And after? I don't know. You have to eat goat milk in the meantime. Some time to eat a milk of goat or cheese. It gives you strength, it gives you energy.
SPEAKER_09: Yeah, he will be stronger. Because he's too weak, but maybe with the tears of God, he will feel something. But just tell him to leave some space in his stomach for Wagner sandwich. I will leave some space for Mr. Wagner.
SPEAKER_02: Yes, yes. He will make him choke. Oh, he will be choking with Wagner sandwich. Okay, guys. Okay, guys, who have been watching us, just don't buy Wagner sandwich. You will be choked, you know, so don't buy it. Let the company die.
SPEAKER_03: And Wagner, do you have this Italian guy who is very confident, any message? First of all, he wants to ask God to protect both of them so nobody gets injured.
SPEAKER_09: Because it's going to be a spectacular fight. God protect both of them.
SPEAKER_09: But next time, he is better not to ask God for these things. Why? Why? Why? Why? Why he doesn't ask next time to God these things?
SPEAKER_09: You don't have to bother him. You don't have to. He said he will arrange himself without God.
SPEAKER_09: Not like this. It is not necessary to put God in them. He needs God. He put. No problem. I respect. Another thing I want to ask, you know, when you say that
SPEAKER_02: you know, God protects and things like that. So suddenly I just remember the arm-wrestling table in Chicago. Yeah, I will pray also to protect the table. And the next thing I will do as soon as this podcast finishes, I will write to Robert.
SPEAKER_09: You know, and what's up there to make sure to have some same extra table. He said he will pray to protect the table because he always destroys it. So to be sure that in Chicago there was an additional table
SPEAKER_09: to change in case of destruction. Wagner, my friend, will you be... What? What's this? He... What did he say? He said if he will break the table, he will pay the table. He said if he will break the table, he will pay the table.
SPEAKER_02: Is it possible not to break the table in Chicago?
SPEAKER_02: It's possible he breaks the table. Oh, it's possible that he will break. OK, so we better prepare something. Yeah. OK. It's better to have a stand by table. Yeah. OK. Does he remember? Does he remember that last time I asked him, he said he promised. And then at the East versus West stage, everything fall apart.
SPEAKER_02: Do you remember when you promised him that you wouldn't break the table, that the table was all out of place? Sorry, my friend, sorry. Listen, listen, nothing to be sorry about, but even if you would promise, I wouldn't 100% believe, so I better make sure to write Robert, make sure that there is some
SPEAKER_02: You know, extra table with the same cover design is versus 18 design. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Anyways. Yeah. I mean, Wagner, you are, you're a monster, but as the super chat mentioned with the golden heart, we love you very much and we are happy that you are, you are back.
SPEAKER_02: Thank you so much. He loves you guys a lot. And Manuel, my friend, you are first time coming to East Russia's West. We are honored and happy to have you. And you have very colorful personality. And personally, I believe that you are a great addition to our event.
SPEAKER_02: That's Amelia. Thank you. Yeah, yeah. He understood probably what I said. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And then it was very, very nice to have to do this program with three of you. When I say three of you, I'm talking about Manuel Wagner and his girlfriend, not you, Hermes. And...

SPEAKER_10: and really I care too much for the people who support us to buy the pay-per-view because I saw a lot of piracy last time from you know I heard and if the people want this we continue and to support us to have this great event with all the athletes
SPEAKER_02: It's only 20, almost $20. It's almost, you know, not too much. And you know, you will support the sport. Yeah, anyone who has been watching this event by piracy, we will throw them in front of Wagner and then they can see what's going to happen. Right, Wagner? You're going to shake them, right?
