SPEAKER_07: Hello, hello, hello everyone. Um, I'm still in Romania for the European championships. Uh, first five days of the event today finished. And so youth categories, junior categories, right, left, and the masters. And last two days were power arm wrestling, disabled categories and Romania for the Euro.
SPEAKER_07: I need to share the link now and the guys will join me very soon. And so I'm in a hotel room. I apologize. This is the best quiet place I could find. And thanks for understanding. So let me share this until the big boys, they join.
SPEAKER_07: Okay, I think the first guy just joined Levan Saginashvili. Hello, Vako. Hello, Levan. Great to see you guys. Likewise, Engin. Let me see. Oh, it says Vako. Let me change it. We are live now, and I think the other one came. Okay. Hello, Hermes.
SPEAKER_07: Yeah, I'm happy that you guys solved all the problems. And now, whenever the podcast starts, you guys do like Levan. You guys are doing like this, happy, and people will think that there was no problems, so they will blame me. So, let's be honest, there was a problem, but everything is solved. Is your fault, Engin? My fault!
SPEAKER_07: Listen, as long as you guys are peaceful, let it be my fault. It's okay. And Ermes, can you make your phone sideways? Please. So that was my fault, huh? Okay.
SPEAKER_07: So, I now share this and then as soon as I share... Okay, now I'm sharing. So, how is everything Levan? How are you? Good, good. Good? Fit. Very fit, like a bodybuilder. You are like a bodybuilder now?
SPEAKER_07: Okay. What did you say, Levan? Man's physique. Oh, you are in man's physique. Okay. Can you get up and we can see you? Is your connection is bad, Hermes? Is Levan's connection is bad or my? No connection. Levan, Levan. Levan. Yeah.
SPEAKER_07: 11, okay, now your connection is better. A while ago you were like frozen. So, what is your weight? You said you are in men's physique. What was your weight? 175. 75. And last time you pulled Hermes was 190? Yeah. 88. 88, yeah. When I go... When you... to the venue. Yeah, to the venue.
SPEAKER_05: I've been in Georgia 182, 182. Oh, then you get ill? I tried some low weight, but... So basically Levan, now last time,
SPEAKER_05: Something happened. Why are you laughing? Athlete. Just can you get up? Can you get up? Can I see you, please? Let go a little. Oh, yeah. Somebody's in trouble. Too small, my friend. Too small. Too small? Small. I'm looking bigger, but I'm more light, lightweight, but looking bigger.
SPEAKER_07: You lost only fat and only quality muscle left, right? I lost only like one Hermes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey, listen guys, this is one of the like most important
SPEAKER_07: Okay, who is this guy I just joined? Oh, Tornike came. I was like, I didn't give the link to anyone else. Hello, Tornike. How are you, my friend? Hi, everyone. I'm doing good, thank you. Tornike is my secret weapon.
SPEAKER_07: Levan, listen, whenever you can, please join with English, okay? Because people love to hear directly from you. But whenever you go deep analyzing some technical, and Tornike is incredible anyways, but people also wants to hear from you.
SPEAKER_07: So, Hermes, okay, listen. You guys just recently made a piece. I'm very, very happy. This is the secret weapon. Oh, zero sugar. Okay. Bring this, my friend. Secret weapon to be strong. It is not working. It is zero sugar. Original. For quality, my friend. Levan, Levan, okay, I have a question for you.
SPEAKER_07: You and I, we are from similar cultures, and you and I, we have some borders about the words that are used, but personal. But other than that, you know, Hermes went like, and he said, you have this excuse, this excuse, this excuse. Did that part also bother you? I don't know.
SPEAKER_07: Which part? Name calling, name calling, I understand, you don't like it. But, about the... Ermes says that you had first Oxygen problem and the weight problem, and now he says that you needed a sugar drink or something. This also make you angry or like, not at all? No, no, because it is true.
SPEAKER_07: Oh, it is true. Okay. No. Listen, when you say it is true, it is true from your side or it is true that Hermes says these are all excuses? No, no. I don't know what the problem was. I don't know what the problem was. I don't know what the problem was.
SPEAKER_07: Well, those were the actual problems. So here we are. Okay. So they were actual problems. And Hermes, you share those things, you make a video. Is that because you think it's not real? I think the problem is it was because nobody did the cardio.
SPEAKER_06: and without cardio if you have a long match is very hard and if you if your weight is almost 190 kilo you don't and you don't did any cardio if if you have a long match it's very difficult to to have enough oxygen okay i don't remember
SPEAKER_05: The main problem I had was that I underestimated Eremis. But now I fully understand my opponent and I'm fully prepared.
SPEAKER_07: Okay, then Hermes, now you talk like you have understanding about Lewand, but whenever you make video, you get upset. Hey, you have these excuses, these excuses. So what is bothering you exactly? Just let's talk. I said about underestimated me, I said it can be true because if I see his part,
SPEAKER_06: Before his match, I fought with Dave Chaffee and had a hard fight. When he fought with Chaffee, he won very easily. After you are unbeatable, you don't have any loss from six or seven years.
SPEAKER_06: This I understand. Which part you don't understand? Tell us that part. I don't understand about oxygen. I think the problem was only because usually arm wrestlers don't do cardio and that's why it's very difficult when you have a long match.
SPEAKER_05: No, no, sorry, Ermes, but in Darbash, for example, in my opinion, Laleddin was one of the most astrophysicists, that's for sure. He was very close to us, and he was very close to Badulescu, when Badulescu came to the world with his friends and left, and that's how he is today.
SPEAKER_05: There was a problem, but it was real. Bartomi didn't have it, Hermes didn't have it either. I don't want to talk about it, but I don't want to talk about Hermes either. Yes, that's our problem. We didn't want to talk about cardio, but it wasn't a real problem. It was a satanic idea. I don't want to talk about it, but that's our problem.
SPEAKER_00: I have to clarify that this was the venue where many armwrestlers had troubles. For example, Vitaly Laletin had to be taken out with an ambulance. On the same day, Barilescu sorry and was picking to the side and he was not feeling well. And Aramis was not feeling well at that during the match as well.
SPEAKER_07: Overall, yeah, I agree. We could have prepared better and trained the cardio part, but the venue was tough as well. Okay. Ermes, I understand that you don't want to start anything, but that is not what... Right now, every time you call...
SPEAKER_07: What's that? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. We need to clear this. Whenever you go to your YouTube channel, you say, hey, you do this, you do this. No, no, one moment. No, I'm just asking what upsets you. You don't talk about that. Just say it. Say it so that we will fix this problem. I don't want this problem to happen every year. No, no, no. Okay, let me talk. You are upset. No, no, no.
SPEAKER_07: What's that? I like fighting first with Hermes and then being friends. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So just say openly, you are upset that Levan doesn't give you the credit that you deserve, correct? Yeah, if I have a hard fight with some opponent,
SPEAKER_06: I like an athlete with a man. I can tell it was a hard fight with a very strong opponent. This is what I think.
SPEAKER_05: So, you are saying that he should stay? No, I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so.
SPEAKER_00: Every time I mention the match, I always say that Hermes was stronger than I expected.
SPEAKER_00: uh of course there is a reason for oxygen and everything else but the Hermes being strong was what resulted into that so i would say that my my opinion is that when you were gonna arm wrestle against Devon and Devon was the one that really like he was
SPEAKER_07: scratching that, you know, oh, I think that Hermes normally would win, you know, if there was a running foul and this. So I think you had to say this to Devin to answer that, you know, like you had that hard time. Because I think Devin was saying that he beat Hermes easier than you beat Hermes. So then you were just saying
SPEAKER_07: because of this reason, this reason and this reason. No, I never assumed that. Because I remember all this started when you had a podcast before Devon match.
SPEAKER_07: And Devon was teasing you. He was saying that, oh, Hermes actually, you know, beat you. It was a run and foul. And then it was the time that you said all these things. Oh, I didn't prepare good. I was heavy. It was in that podcast. And then next day, Hermes made a video that he said that, you know, like.
SPEAKER_07: crybaby or something and then you get angry and you call me i don't want to go into details but uh i think that that was how it started but now okay we have chicago event in my opinion it is the one of the biggest biggest and most important matches in the history because arm wrestling has never been at this level and you are the strongest arm master who has ever lived for sure for right arm
SPEAKER_07: Everyone accepts this. And this guy is the one that gave you the hardest match. You accept that way or no, I don't know. And now he's coming again. And if you lost 15 kilo Levan, it just means that maybe it was not the only venue problem.
SPEAKER_07: Maybe you even if it's a good air conditioner in Chicago, you felt like you need to lose weight. So you didn't want to experience the same problem.
SPEAKER_05: Yes, of course. There are 50,000 people who have lost their lives because of the problems of the Armenians. And there is no other way. From that point of view, there is no other way than to go home, right? When the machine is running, it is running, it is running, it is running. That's natural. All sportsmen are running. That's the way it is.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, of course, being 190, of course, I had troubles. Would that be with the conditioning or oxygen? That's the lesson that I learned. And as any professional, I have to learn on my mistakes. And being that weight, of course, I would have some troubles. And what was your weight against Jerry? My? No, that one.
SPEAKER_05: I don't remember exactly. Before the flight I was 180 kg. During the match probably 178.
SPEAKER_07: OK, so this is a standard thing that after that match you try to be under 180 kilo every match. So this is not a lesson only for Hermes match. So you do this for almost every match? Yes, yes. In general, when he weighs 180 kilos, he doesn't feel comfortable.
SPEAKER_05: Now, what I want to say is that I have a lot of professional work to do. I have a club, I have a cardio, I have a lot of work to do. This is my motivation, which is why I have a lot of work to do.
SPEAKER_05: And everyone was convinced that he was in poor condition. He didn't get along with Jerry in that way, because in the Empire, as you all know, there was a problem with the car. The car was broken and the car was broken, and the car was broken.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, of course, being above 180 is not comfortable to me. But I have learned my lesson. And during this preparation, I was much more professional. I considered my nutrition, the cardio, everything was in a top-notch condition.
SPEAKER_00: Even during the Jerry match, my preparation was not the best. All my friends and relatives know that I was focusing on my car and fixing it, and training was also done in parallel. But now I'm fully preparing and being in my best shape. And Armas?
SPEAKER_06: I love too much to hear these things. What's that? I love too much to hear these things. He's in the best shape. Because after I will win, he don't have any excuse. You will not have any excuse after Hermes beats you? Oh, it is...
SPEAKER_05: He is shocked. He is shocked. He doesn't know what to say.
SPEAKER_00: It's crazy to hear. It's like Ermes could have said that he believes in aliens and they will come to the earth and attack us all. Some fantasies.
SPEAKER_07: Aliens exist through my friends. They exist? Yeah, aliens exist. Levan said that I told you, right? What did Levan say? Did Levan say I told you? Yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah, yeah, I thought so, yeah.
SPEAKER_07: So, Levan, do you think there is... I mean, I haven't seen one. So, I believe in some spirits. I don't know if they are the same thing or not.
SPEAKER_07: But aliens, I don't know, not the ones that they show with the long neck like E.T. You guys remember E.T.? Actually, Hermes looks like an E.T. Hermes is E.G. Hermes Gasparini. I'm the one E.T.
SPEAKER_07: Or maybe Jablonski looks like EG. Okay, there is a super chat. GB19 says, will you guys pull all six rounds or four? Or Oxygen? Oxygen. 4-5-0. Mereme will take off his mask and Mors will take off his mask.
SPEAKER_00: So once it's 4-0, I will take the oxygen mask and pull the rest two rounds with that. What is that? I just want it. Okay, so it sounds like Lewand didn't fix his oxygen problem.
SPEAKER_00: Like a diver, I will have a tank on my back.
SPEAKER_05: But Levan, last time you didn't tell me this. Last time you said after 4-0, Ermes will run and Irakli will run and catch him and bring it to the table. No, no. There is no version like that. Bob Salmachi's. Four or five years later. Four or five years later, there is no version like that. There is no version like that. There is no version like that. There is no version like that. There is no version like that.
SPEAKER_05: My second version is that Gasparini does not win, and Gasparini is defeated by Larratt, and Larratt and Gasparini fight one-on-one and win the game. And my third version is that 5-0, no, 6-0 wins, which is a little secret. They do not win, and Bolo wins, and the maximum score is 7-0.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, there are several...
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, there are several ways this match can continue after 4-0. One scenario is, yeah, here Ermes runs away. Iroquois has to catch him and bring him back. Second scenario is Devin joins in. They try to pull me together, but I still beat them. The third scenario is Ermes fights to 6-0 and he falls like Maximus. And if you remember the scene from the movie when he goes through the field,
SPEAKER_07: touching the grass and something like that happens. I will pull all the rounds. All six rounds you guys pull, right? Yes, for sure. Because there is some criticisation from Lewand to you that you quit after 3-0 against Devon. For me, one good thing
SPEAKER_06: The first time I broke his record. What do you mean? He said he wanted to end his career without a zero loss, zero match. Round, round. The next time I broke another thing, the victory. I understand. You are saying he had two main goals.
SPEAKER_07: him to finish his career undefeated and one is no round loss so you are saying that first match you finish his no round loss dream and now second you are gonna finish his dream of being undefeated in his career yeah he can lose one time my friend you can lose one time no problem
SPEAKER_07: So Hermes hopes that I go to US, I become ill or incapable and he wins that way, right? That's his only hope. He says that there is only one way for you to win, is that only if he gets very ill. And he's thinking that... With Coca-Cola, Coca-Cola have caffeine inside.
SPEAKER_06: He will help him? Yeah, he hopes that, I don't know, maybe car hits me or something happens. So that's his only hope. Is it true that you hired someone to hit Levan with a car in Chicago? I will give the malediction, you know.
SPEAKER_06: No, I don't need these things, my friend. I think many athletes underestimated me about the Devon match. Michael Todd said he wanted to do this, because the Devon match was really a bad day for me.
SPEAKER_06: But this is what happened, I don't want to make any excuse, I lost. But if the people, my next opponents, they compare, they see this match and they see
SPEAKER_07: They put my labor about for this match. They are doing a very big mistake. Super big mistake. To be honest, Hermes, you prepared for many months for Jerry. And you prepared for supination side pressure. And then Devon match happened. Devon was going to pull Gennady. And Gennady tore his bicep. When Gennady tore his bicep, it was only four weeks. You pulled Jerry one week. You didn't train.
SPEAKER_07: And the last two weeks before the Devon match you didn't train, so I think you had only one match. So I'm not saying Devon couldn't beat you. But you did not prepare especially for... Yeah, Devon told the same things. He said the same things.
SPEAKER_06: but we will fix in the future these things for sure but if the people compare some people you can beat Devon because how we want to beat Levon they are doing very big mistake and but about this I learned a lot about my wrist my pronation and I think I don't
SPEAKER_06: say now I have the hand pronation stronger than Lewand, but for sure he will feel a lot different. Is your arm stronger than Lewand's? Is your back pressure stronger than Lewand's? Let me stir the pot a little bit.
SPEAKER_06: Yeah, yeah. So you finally accepted? Only 40 kilos. 40 kilos I did maximum. How many kilos? I put 92, but it's 40. 40 kilos. See, Levan, you were right about it. Sorry, Levan. I doubt what you said. But yeah. And what do you think about Levan's 180 kilos? The weight is impressive, but not comparable his body weight.
SPEAKER_06: For me, really, it's more impressive to see Irakli, his weight is 95, he's doing 130 kilos, many reps for myself. Or, I don't criticize, it's a very big performance, for sure. But if it was 180 kilos on the wall, this would change a lot. He never tried it on the wall.
SPEAKER_06: And how many kilos do you think he can do on the wall? 110 or more. How much is your bench press? With the plastic weight, 50 kilos.
SPEAKER_07: 160 kilos? 50, 50. 50 kilos with the plastic weights, okay. Real weights? 70. Okay, Dino has a super chat. He says, well, hello, quality, Hermes will be champion. He says Hermes will be champion and...
SPEAKER_06: top role for Smart says, like if you are here for Hermes. Lewand, do you think that like more people are supporting you internationally or supporting Hermes? My friend, the people are tired to see him win every time. He needs to lose one time. It's like, you know, Juventus. Juventus can win every time. The people will hate it.
SPEAKER_06: We need to change the story. It's more beautiful for the sport to see a new champion. I'm like a dictator. Until I'm dead, I'm not going anywhere. I remember when Lewand and Devon were playing for the first time,
SPEAKER_07: Somebody asked me, Engin, what is better for the sport, if Devon wins or Levan wins? He probably wanted me to say Devon because he is more popular. And I said, whoever deserves to win is better for the sport. And I still think the same way. I know many people want a new champion, but my mind works differently.
SPEAKER_07: Yeah. And they're asking your weight, Hermes. 28, 29. And one more question. They're asking, can you ask Hermes if he thinks he will win the table centre with the first rounds? I don't know. Everything can happen. Just tell...
SPEAKER_07: us like how you really feel i know you don't want to look weak you don't want to talk too big but my guess is that you you believe that like center is very hard but you plan to stop him like halfway or something yeah something like that i say the many interview last time my wrist
SPEAKER_06: He opened my wrist totally, immediately. But my arm power, I hold him with my arm. I think if my wrist is stronger for sure, I think I can hold better than last time. And these things will help a lot my arm power.
SPEAKER_07: Yes. I have a question for you, Levan. Just tell us, like, do you feel like, oh, June 21, just come quickly, you know, just let me destroy that guy, you know, like, do you feel that way?
SPEAKER_05: Well, as I said, I have a lot to say about Jerry. I have a lot to say about Jerry, but I have to say that I am very happy to be here with Jerry.
SPEAKER_05: I don't know, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
SPEAKER_05: I don't want to make a big deal out of it, but I do want to make a big deal out of it because I don't want to make a big deal out of it.
SPEAKER_00: Well, to be honest, I'm really hungry. Hungry to pull for a victory. I have to be honest, with all due respect to Jerry, I didn't feel the resistance that I wanted. So I still miss the fight. Most probably this match will go as easily as it went with Jerry.
SPEAKER_00: And after the match I will have to fly to Italy and maybe we can film some content together for YouTube where I can teach him and maybe we can make fans a bit more happy that way. Because the match itself might be a bit one-sided. He said it will be more easily than Jerry. It will be as easy as Jerry's match, that's what he says.
SPEAKER_06: I can't wait to pull, I can't wait to see again the face of his fans, of his friends in the corner. I can't wait. You can't wait that worry that they had on Round 5?
SPEAKER_07: What? You can't wait to see the same face that his corner had round five in Dubai. Yeah, round three, round three, four. Round three as well? Okay. Uh-huh. Yeah. I don't understand why he said this. Why? He believes? Yeah, I think he believes. He believes.
SPEAKER_06: But to say he will not feel nothing, he is doing a very big mistake, for sure. For sure. I don't think after our match, for sure he's improved, but not like me.
SPEAKER_06: Impossible. Maybe he improved, maybe 10%, something like that, 5%. But me, for sure, almost 20%, I think. One rep with 92, I did 16 reps. Something different it is.
SPEAKER_06: riser i started with davon with a 45 now 67. you're talking about 92 kilo back pressure yeah 11 was it back pressure that's how how elmest it is yeah i did this this but look this a little bit like this not this uh
SPEAKER_06: I'm really happy to see his confidence. But I don't understand really. But okay, I accept this. What can I say? Okay, one more question. If you knew
SPEAKER_07: Like round three, you said that before round three, you saw that Irakli, he was laughing, like he was making fun. Round two. Yeah, no, before round three. Before round three. Yeah, before, yeah. And you said that that's why you get angry and you did your all.
SPEAKER_07: And then you stop him. But do you think you made a mistake that round three when Levan gets fouled, restart, instead of back pressure and this, you directly went there and Levan just flashed you. Yeah. My friend, you think you can beat me without straps? If you don't run away, yeah, sure.
SPEAKER_06: Yeah, no, no, I don't run away. I will pull slowly and you too. You need to hold me and to block me. You can do this with me.
SPEAKER_06: I'm going to hit so hard that I might just rip your arm off. I will hit so hard I might just rip your arm off. No, no, no. Now you change. Please, hold me or maybe here. Hold me like from here, please. Like the devil. Hermes, you said he's changing. He didn't change. You said he can beat you without the strap or not?
SPEAKER_06: No, no, I said if he can hold me, block me on the center. No, I mean, the first thing you said that like if he can beat you without the strap or not. So he's saying that he's going to hold you and he will grip your arm. You can stay like this. Please, my friend, every round. You can stay like this. Every round without straps. Two hands. Yeah. No, no, take me here. You can stay like this.
SPEAKER_06: No, not two hands. Here, please. Take me here. Every round, block me and go. Without strap, we can finish the match very quickly. And you will win like a super mega champion. Lewand, do you realize what he's trying to do? Do you understand what he's trying to do? I don't know what he's trying to do.
SPEAKER_07: Yeah, some child's play, this is not serious. No, no, no, it's very serious. No, no, it's not serious. Remember, Levan. Not serious, my friend. Remember, Levan. Round three, you didn't slip. You wanted to hold him without the strap, you know? And... So you're trying to... How many people you need to be... to...
SPEAKER_00: When you want to be a champion and you start to speak that way, that's really, really, I'm really sorry for you. Don't do this time.
SPEAKER_06: He basically says that since you want to be a champion, that's not the way to speak of telling me how to pull and how to get the match going. No, my friend. He said he wanted to clarify everything, to not have any doubts about me and him. If you want to do this, he can hold me, block me and go slowly.
SPEAKER_06: You know, this is the best way you can crush one guy. If I need to be crushed like this, I feel too bad. And you are completely without doubt about the matches or...
SPEAKER_06: So if I win any other way, you think there will be doubts? No, no, no. I suggest only this. No, no. He's saying that if he beats you in different way. He can do whatever he want. What if I beat you like Devin did? How? First round? Like first round?
SPEAKER_06: Yeah, we all saw how Devin stopped him in the middle and then won. Yeah, almost. Almost won. He said he would win like very fast. Explain, explain, talk my friend. We don't understand.
SPEAKER_07: You seem too scared. I'm losing my motivation. Whenever you're telling him to beat you in the way that you want, it really sounds a little bit that way.
SPEAKER_06: You just need to tell him, just do whatever you want, you know? I'm ready. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure. But when for me, I say, when for me, I wanted to crush some guy, you know what you need to do. To hold in the center, to see in this eye and to crush him.
SPEAKER_07: But Hermes, the reason that you are saying all these things, you and I, we both know that you want to make him tired. No, no. No, no. Yes, yes. And listen, that's a good strategy. But from outside, it looks not good.
SPEAKER_00: uh i remember something like that when we had the in the in our first match i stopped him in the middle and then beat him take a round yep yeah there's a super chat tyson bull says give leon oxygen oxygenated cola
SPEAKER_07: And one guy says, why is the conversation whether or not you can hold him at 25% mark? If you were the better armwrestler, wouldn't you be holding him at the 25% mark? I think that the reality about Levan being super strong guy is just making conversation come there. You know, like Levan is always the attacker and the opponents are always trying to stop.
SPEAKER_07: And the way that Hermes... Hey Lewa, did this guy beat you one round or not? I know you answered this before, but I want to look at him and then say this. Hermes, did you beat him one round or not? When? Where? How was that a victory?
SPEAKER_07: You said you finished his one dream about no round loss and you said you're going to finish his second dream. He quit. He quit? Yes. Levan?
SPEAKER_06: I don't know. Who had the oxygen mask? Me or him? Who had the oxygen mask? Ambulance, ambulance, friends, water on the face. Who had this? Me or him? What score? What score? What score, he's asking. What was the score? You quit it. Okay, he's asking what was the score according to you. And the referee came to him
SPEAKER_06: And they said, what do you want to do? Give the rounds, he said. What was the score at the time? He agreed with the referee for two, but this is true. There is the video, eh? There is the video. What was the score, the real score at the time? He's implying the 4-0.
SPEAKER_07: What was the score at that time?
SPEAKER_06: He's asking you what was the score when the match stopped. So when the match stopped, it was 4-0. But Hermes is saying that there is a video. But the video, the match, it was not finished. The match, it was 1-0 finished because he made a foul to not lose. He made a foul to not lose. And after, oxygen mask, ambulance.
SPEAKER_06: water my face and he said no, no, no, no, I don't want to continue. 4-2 is okay. I saw this. Is that 4-2 is okay? He may say this with referee. Did you say that to the referee that it's okay for to give him the two rounds? Yeah. Oh, you said okay then.
SPEAKER_06: This is what happened, I don't know. I don't know. If he wants to say it's 4-0, it's 4-0. But the reality, it was what I explained before. But one time Lewandowski told me that you also didn't come to the table. Because he was with Oxygen, how can I come with someone... So you were like ready?
SPEAKER_06: Not ready, but if he comes on the table, I can continue the match. Okay, so the only reason you didn't go to the table because Lewandowski said he cannot continue? Yeah. Okay. The referee came to me and he said Lewandowski can't continue. I was really in a bad time. When I said that when I'm not continuing, what was the score at that time?
SPEAKER_06: My friend, the problem is Juan, because maybe he doesn't understand. When you start one match, you can't retire and go home. You need to finish the match. You mean the rounds? The rounds, yes. Or not? So you won the match? He said, again...
SPEAKER_06: with the mask, I can't continue. He said to the referee for two is okay. That's it. No, he is now asking. So you won the match?
SPEAKER_07: What if you told me yes? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
SPEAKER_06: He's saying it in a different way for his part, but I understand what he means. We were 4-0, my friend, for sure. We were 4-0, for sure. But we started the fifth match, if you remember. The fifth round. Yes, the fifth round.
SPEAKER_06: yeah he's just crazy he's just crazy now but you you you remember or your memory is crushed yeah yeah i remember you won yes sorry prince levan sorry my friend sorry prince levan sorry okay i will talk uh bad better things sorry
SPEAKER_06: I don't care. I don't care too much. I only say that he quitted this time and that's it. What I can do. And Hermes, are you going to beat him in Chicago? I will do my best. I feel very good today. The next day you will wake up as world numbers. I feel very good. I don't want to tell too much because sometimes when you tell too much, it's not good for the lucky.
SPEAKER_06: But I feel something good inside. He said we don't feel nothing. We will see. We will see if we don't feel nothing. If he will beat me like nothing, oh, okay, congratulations. And that's it. Do you believe that? I don't believe zero. This is impossible.
SPEAKER_06: So there will be a tough match? There will be a good match? Yeah, I think it will be a good match. And, Hermes, do you believe that if the match is good, do you believe your chance is higher or his chance is higher? My chance is higher. Because I think from his part, he doesn't have too much experience in the last period to have a long match.
SPEAKER_06: So he's not ready for a long match, is what you're saying? For the mind, yes. He doesn't have too much experience. He won every time very easily. That's my opinion on this. Lewand, I know you get upset right now about the fifth round thing. My friend, you won 4-0. You are happy now? You won 4-0. You won all the matches.
SPEAKER_06: I don't care. I don't care. I don't care too much. You are unbeatable. You are the king. Yeah, you're just crazy now. You're going insane. For what? For what?
SPEAKER_00: Some indecent words of destroying him. Your mind is going crazy now. Why? Why?
SPEAKER_06: You have to decrease your doses because you're going crazy. He needs to decrease what? You talk about doses to me, my friend. You gained 100 kilos and you talk about doses to me? Let's not go there. Yeah, exactly.
SPEAKER_07: Okay, there is a super chat. Trip War says, can they promise now, live, that they will pull full six rounds, whatever the score is? For us, the fans, at least, love them both. Great sport, man. East versus West is the best. Do you promise six rounds? Do you guys promise? Yeah, for me, okay. Okay, okay.
SPEAKER_06: Again, I repeat last time, I say only the reality. What happened last month? Only this. If we think it was 4-0, it's OK. Engin, do you believe that Hermes won those roundups with Smatomax?
SPEAKER_06: Listen, do you need to involve me, Levan? Okay, what's that? Now I will get your... No, no engine involvement, no. Now I say no involvement. Tornik, my friend, ask Levan if it's true or not. If he said to the referee, okay, give the rounds, no problem.
SPEAKER_06: So what? What did those two rounds change? What? I mean, he says that those two rounds doesn't change anything, but he says that's true. He won the fight. Why? Why? Why? We are complaining too much about this. He won. He won the match. That's it.
SPEAKER_06: For me, it's not for me, for myself. It was more like I was more happy to have a very hard match with him. What's happened again about me? Translate to Lewand.
SPEAKER_06: Why aren't you sharing your opinion, Engin? Don't you know? Listen, if I share my opinion, either Hermes or you will be upset. No, no. Me, I don't like him, my friend. I don't like...
SPEAKER_05: I don't care like him. I don't care. I can share my opinion. If both athletes promise that they will not get upset. I can share. What's that? He said.
SPEAKER_07: If I lost, then you, Engin, can fool Hermes since I'm not the champion. No, nobody says that you lost, my friend. You won Supermatch. You're talking about round five. You won the match. Nobody doubts that. You won. Why, why, why? We talked about the one round. We talked about... Levan, come on. Why are you getting angry, Levan? Me, I don't understand. He don't understand. I see the... I see the... Tony, please translate.
SPEAKER_06: I was happy to have a hard fight with him, to be the first to have a hard fight with him. Only this.
SPEAKER_00: After two rounds, you don't change the result. He won the fight. He still won the fight. I never fade something out, something different.
SPEAKER_07: Yeah, he says that it doesn't make sense. You said that you won and... No, no, it doesn't matter. One round is enough. One round. He doesn't talk to Supermatch. Nobody says Levan Saginashvili beat Ermes Kasparidin. No doubt. We talk about only the fifth round.
SPEAKER_07: nobody's even if it was one win or no still it would be four one or four zero there is no difference so levan thinks that we are talking about if he won the super match or not can you explain that that's not the what we are talking about
SPEAKER_07: uh he says that it doesn't make sense because you said different the in different way previously but uh i didn't say it differently we talked about one round i i thought he asked us
SPEAKER_05: My opinion about the round 5, I didn't ask for the Supermatch. I would like to say that if you don't mind, I would like to say that if you don't mind, I would like to say that if you don't mind, I would like to say that if you don't mind, I don't mind.
SPEAKER_07: Levan was asking about the match. Match he won, match he won. Nobody, listen. Why, why, what the fuck is he doing? What the fuck is he doing? Ermes, one second. My friend, Tornike, that's important. I didn't think that way because I, why would I expect a question from Levan about who won the Supermatch while the whole world knows that Levan won the Supermatch? I thought he was asking about round five.
SPEAKER_07: About the supermatch, I don't think there is anybody on this earth that has any doubts. Hermes himself says he won. Levan Skaginashvili won the supermatch. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so.
SPEAKER_05: He would be beaten up, he would not be beaten up, he would be beaten up, he would not be beaten up, he would not be beaten up, he would not be beaten up, he would not be beaten up, he would not be beaten up,
SPEAKER_07: So that's what I'm asking is that what does those two rounds change? Those two rounds? Nothing. Do you know what it changed? It changed that Ermes thinks that he has the honor of defeating him one round. Ermes thinks that he has the honor that he's the only person that ever won one round against Levan. This is what they are
SPEAKER_00: Miscommunication.
SPEAKER_07: Yeah, of course it's miscommunication because I would never expect Lewand to ask such question. Everyone knows that he won. Why would I say anything else? He said the words, did I win? And that's what I translated. I thought that he was talking about who won the round five. Yeah. Now what is he saying? Tornik. Tornik.
SPEAKER_05: Yes, I was sure that I would win the second round. I was sure that I would win the second round. I was sure that I would win the second round. I was sure that I would win the second round. I was sure that I would win the second round. I was sure that I would win the second round. I was sure that I would win the second round. I was sure that I would win the second round. I was sure that I would win the second round.
SPEAKER_05: It's not like Khrushchev, he was a great player, he was a great player, he was a great player, he was a great player, he was a great player, he was a great player, he was a great player, he was a great player, he was a great player, he was a great player, he was a great player.
SPEAKER_05: It's a six-round game, you can't win and you can't win and you can't win and you can't win and you can't win.
SPEAKER_00: That's what I'm saying, that those two rounds didn't matter. Since I won those rounds, it can be 4-0, it can be 6-0, whatever the score is, those rounds don't matter. Now it's a very common thing, if we have best out of five,
SPEAKER_00: The match finishes at three. If it's best out of seven, the match finishes at four. And nobody's saying, why didn't you pull those last rounds? So why is it me that I have to pull these extra rounds? I didn't feel well and I didn't care about those. That's why I stopped the match. Yeah, one more, mate.
SPEAKER_06: Before my match, he said he competed all six rounds every time. Because he said he wanted to win all the rounds. And that's why we competed all the six rounds. Translate. Why do you think he won all six rounds?
SPEAKER_05: I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
SPEAKER_05: He was an organizer, and he had a lot of work to do. He had a lot of work to do. He had a lot of work to do.
SPEAKER_05: I think this is the reason why it is so important. Gaspare, I know that you and Magida have been together for a long time. You and Magida have been together for a long time. You and Magida have been together for a long time. You and Magida have been together for a long time. You and Magida have been together for a long time. You and Magida have been together for a long time. You and Magida have been together for a long time.
SPEAKER_00: Yes, I have said before that I wanted to pull all the six rounds, but why should I risk it if I'm not feeling well? There is no point in continuing since I have won. And once the referee came and asked what to do, should I do 4-2? I said, whatever you want to do. That didn't matter to me.
SPEAKER_00: they could have done whatever they wanted. And also I saw that Eremis was extremely unwell as well. His helpers were helping him out with the towel and everything. So I took the responsibility on myself and said, do whatever you want and just stop the match because I didn't care at that point. And there is no point in risking continuing the match from there.
SPEAKER_06: One moment, one moment. This is the perfect what I think. Same lane, same things. I said only this. Like when I fought with Gennady, when I won 4-2.
SPEAKER_06: Nobody cares they lost two matches with Gennady Wong. You care that you think you won one round against Lewand. One moment, please. But with Lewand it's different because if someone can hold him more to almost win one round,
SPEAKER_06: It's not important like the first four rounds, but they almost win one round in the fifth round. There are more rumors about this. Translate, please. Maybe we can... I would like to thank you very much. I am very happy to be here. It was a great pleasure to talk to you.
SPEAKER_05: I would like to say that it was good. How was it? I think it was good. It was a good chance. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
SPEAKER_00: What can I say? It was a good game. I'm happy to be here. I'm happy to be here. Levan thought that you were talking about winning the match. Never. Never in my life. Nobody. Nobody. Nobody on this earth think that way. I mean, honest people are like, they don't know. That your teammate was understanding about this.
SPEAKER_06: They never say they want the match. Never in my life. Translate, please. Tony, translate, please. Now you can tell me sorry, my friend.
SPEAKER_07: sorry after after i beat you i will tell you that how about me you don't have to compete with me do you really believe that i thought that you lost that match come on man come on
SPEAKER_07: That's what I wanted to ask you, Engin. Did I lose or not? Never, never. He won the match, but I can still say my opinion only if they both promise me that they don't get upset, but let's forget about it because
SPEAKER_07: There are sports like boxing. If you can't continue, you lose the match, right? But not in arm wrestling. In arm wrestling, you win the round, enough rounds, and then you win, yeah. Tyson Bull says, Kola pulled arm wrestling's whole body in 2025. And yeah.
SPEAKER_07: and then dino says only thing what will be ripped is your oxygen hose levan this is super chat sorry these are not my opinions so don't get angry with me
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, they were saying the same things with Devin. Now here, it's useless. Top roll is for Subar says no Kola, no win. And Hermes, okay, my friend.
SPEAKER_07: Another one, last time you were going to pull Levan, you didn't believe at all that you can win. You said even one round, you know, even one round. No, no, even one shake on Stalker. Holding him, yeah. You said even you give him a hard match, but this time you already had one experience with Levan and now you're going to Chicago. But this time, for sure, you are not going to Chicago for one round.
SPEAKER_06: or two rounds or a hard match, you are going there to win the world title, correct? Yes, of course. If I think to lose it, it's better to stay at home or to change another opponent. And the question is, since you accepted the match,
SPEAKER_06: Your form and your hopes are bigger, same or less? In the beginning, it was less. Okay. And the more days passed, how is it now? After this, I saw more good results in the gym. And your confidence is more, you understand. Yeah.
SPEAKER_07: Ermen, so your form is satisfying and your form is even better than what you were thinking in the beginning? Yes. And Levan, what is this guy's winning chance against you? Tell us honestly. Do you see in your head that he's beating you?
SPEAKER_05: There is no such thing as a chance, but I think that this is probably the most important thing for me.
SPEAKER_05: At the same time, it seems to me that Taris Larad is a very important figure, but I think it is possible to say that Larad is strong. In some situations, for example, in Khar, in Khristala, it is possible that Larad is strong now.
SPEAKER_05: Honestly, he has no chance against me unless Karr hits me or something.
SPEAKER_00: But I have to tell that probably he is the strongest after me in the world at the moment. Most probably he is much stronger than Devin at the moment.
SPEAKER_00: And there might be some question marks in that department. But overall, I think that, for example, for shoulder, shoulder press, I think he's stronger than them. And I think he is a confident number two in the world.
SPEAKER_07: Do you think that Levan believes in what he says? That when you say that you have no chance at all or he is just intimidating or he really believes himself like to be 100% favorite? I think he has some planning in his mind about the match and
SPEAKER_06: And about this, I think in his mind he learned something about last match and he thinks maybe to win more easier for these things. You understand what I mean? And that's why he thinks I have zero chance. But the reality will be different. He will learn something new.
SPEAKER_06: yeah i think i think when he will feel my hand my wish something in his mind will change i can't i can't tell him the favorite with him nobody is the favorite but basically you are saying that he is again underestimating him
SPEAKER_07: No. He is underestimating. If he is in the best shape, he is not underestimating me this time. No, that's not what I'm saying. When I say underestimating, it means that after his preparation,
SPEAKER_06: Now he's going to beat you 100%? Yeah, maybe now. He said last time it was a hard fight. I need to be 100% and now maybe he feels super strong and he compares himself from last time. I feel stronger and I think he will beat me more easily.
SPEAKER_06: But from my part, I can say I'm stronger than last time when we fought. And if he went now here, me too. You understand? So you are saying basically he doesn't realize how much you improved. Yeah, I improved a lot. These last few years, I improved a lot. Lewand, do you think that your shape right now is the best shape of your life?
SPEAKER_07: Thank you. And Hermes, you disagree with him. Lewand, when the Georgian arm wrestling, they put your video, the one-arm curl, and Hermes wrote to me, I need to say Hermes, and he said in the past he was lifting heavier. And he said, oh, he is weaker than before. What was your response? It's really true. He did more weight in the past, this exercise.
SPEAKER_05: I am very happy to be here. I am very happy to be here. I am very happy to be here. I am very happy to be here. I am very happy to be here. I am very happy to be here. I am very happy to be here.
SPEAKER_00: My technique with that lift is slightly different. My wrist is more open and more flexed in the wrist and I simply didn't risk to go with a higher weight, but I think I could.
SPEAKER_07: After that, I curled 180 kg. So I simply didn't have to go higher with that. Tomaso, Tarlao, thank you for your support. And Michael's Workspace says, hi, everyone. Can't wait to meet you all in Chicago, East vs. West 18. And we are closely following
SPEAKER_07: And in any other sport you won't see any athlete will argue with referee at all. It always bothered me when I see this on armwrestling matches. I understand my friends. Yeah. I don't know what to respond to that part, but if there is another Super Chat.
SPEAKER_07: Dino says, Bailey, you will lose Hermes. Bring Italian water. And Eric Taylor says, the true question is, if there was two more rounds and he won it, would it be 4-2? But two rounds were 4-8. And so technically, 4-2, last two rounds, go Hermes. This is Eric Taylor's opinion, Super Chat.
SPEAKER_07: Dino says, Hermes, Levan, all these guys are picking on you. The guy says, don't pull your beard, teddy bear. Don't be nervous, he says. He thinks that you are nervous. That's why you're playing with your beard. It's just a habit. I hope I will lose that habit. Aha.
SPEAKER_07: Okay. Gasparini also has this, just here. Gasparini doesn't have beer? Jonas says, what Hermes is saying is so stupid. So when Devon beat him 3-0 and Devon didn't continue to pull score, was 3-2,
SPEAKER_07: 4-0 match over, simple as that. Now this guy is supporting Levan. But the thing is that it is not Devon that didn't continue, it was Hermes that didn't continue at that time. So probably this is the, wow, a lot of chat here. I see a lot of chats. People are saying Engin is scared of Levan.
SPEAKER_07: I mean, how can you not be scared of someone like this? No, it's not scared. It is because Levan is important for me. He's my good friend. I really love and respect. Same, I really love and respect Hermes. I don't want them to misunderstand me and get upset with me when it is misunderstanding. Okay. Angel says, let's move on another subject. You both are very strong.
SPEAKER_07: Arm shark, arm wrestling. King will fall. Let's go, Hermes. How much do you want, Hermes? How much do you want? How important is it for you to beat Levan and become a new champion? Too much, too much.
SPEAKER_06: Really, I remember last time when I fought with him, I was very relaxed. No stress last time.
SPEAKER_06: Because you had nothing to lose, but this time you lost twice. I said many times if I can stop, but inside really I never thought I can win. This time I'm really nervous because I know I have some possibility.
SPEAKER_06: And I feel a lot more confident than last time. And if you want to win this fight, you need to be 100% with mind, body, everything 100%.
SPEAKER_07: I will do my best for this match. You are going to Chicago to beat this guy? Yes, for sure. Why not? Does Hermes think he will win at least one round? This is Superchat, not my question.
SPEAKER_07: Yeah, I want to win. I want to win. Yeah. Okay. And then let's see. Who is next or close regardless of conclusion? Right now, we don't think about what is next because this is the most important match. I'm just bringing the chat down to see.
SPEAKER_07: And guys, please be respectful. Angel says, Levan won last time. We will see what happens next. Let's talk about something else. Do you like cookies? They are asking. Yes, of course. Cookie, cookie.
SPEAKER_07: Anyway, so, Hermes, I have a question. GV19 is asking you, Hermes could win round three and four if you do not go flop. Okay, Hermes. If you said that round two you get angry because Irakli was laughing, smiling, and then after you started, if you would really start, you know, just going back pressure and doing
SPEAKER_07: would be different do you think that there would be much yeah yeah yeah yeah so you you if you knew what you knew later rounds right from the beginning maybe you would be the winner this is what you believe yeah yeah don't be afraid just say your opinion i repeat please i'm just saying that if like round three you try this okay round three if you knew
SPEAKER_06: what to do, not during the match, but if you do it before the match. I don't know, I don't know when 100% much, much different. Yeah. So there would be even, okay. Yeah, because in this position, I never pulled this position. For me, it was a new, new technique, you know.
SPEAKER_06: Every time, every match, you learn more. You think it was better to do like this, this. My goal is not to go again here. Can you translate? Like, Hermes is saying that if he knew what he learned during the match,
SPEAKER_00: before the match the things might have been like different and can you ask this levan's opinion about this uh
SPEAKER_05: Well, the main reason for my decision was that I wanted to do it. I wanted to do it, but I didn't have the chance. I wanted to do it, but I couldn't do it. How? Well, what I could do,
SPEAKER_05: It was a great opportunity for me. It was a great opportunity for me to say that I was going to die, and in reality, I was very lucky. It was a great opportunity for me to say that I was going to die, and in reality, I was very lucky. It was a great opportunity for me to say that I was very lucky.
SPEAKER_00: The way I pulled in the beginning, he doesn't have any chance to stop that. His only chance was when he stopped at the end and my arm got pumped. That's the only chance that he got. So he's saying that the result would have been the same? Yeah. No, he said in the third round, yes, change it.
SPEAKER_05: Yes, from the beginning, in fact, it was uncontrollable to go to Poland, because it was very difficult.
SPEAKER_05: I was controlling the center. I had just a little trouble at the final end above the pin.
SPEAKER_00: And that was because I got pumped and my arm started to straighten. That's why I had to readjust, go above and attack again. If he tried the same thing in the first rounds, that would have been too risky because I would simply injure him. So that would not have worked in the first rounds.
SPEAKER_07: Empty Corner says, all jokes aside, the community absolutely loves both of these titans. Levan and Hermes will go down as some of the most powerful athletes to ever live. And Hermes, there's a question, are mutants. Hermes versus Devon in December, my friend, we don't know anything yet. We need to see.
SPEAKER_07: Levon vs. Hermes, which is the most important match. And then we need to see Lallatin vs. Devon, which is next event. And yeah. Okay, so empty corners. Devon trashing the house right now. Wakeup says, let me finish the Super Chess and we can slowly finish the program. Wakeup says, Levon, this is a very important question.
SPEAKER_00: Do you think you could beat Devon and Hermes if you and them weighed 140 kg? Yeah, of course. If I was 140, I would have been crazy good. So he means that, of course, he would beat him because at 140, he would be really good.
SPEAKER_07: Sexy. He would be really what? Really good? Yep. Very sexy and very beautiful. So you would be very sexy and Hermes and Devon would fall in love with you and then they would lose?
SPEAKER_07: Hermes and Devon not will be sexy on 140. I will be. Aha, you will be sexy but they will be like one more. Fast, okay. And then Mappozian, love both of you guys. Wish you no injuries, first of all.
SPEAKER_07: Kevin Tomkey says, Engin, when is your young Turkish girl you coach at the King of the Table going to compete again? She won the qualifications and so she deserves one match. Stinky Taco says, Hermes will not even feel Levan at the table. I don't know what that means. Hermes will not feel means Hermes is going to destroy him or Levan is going to destroy him.
SPEAKER_07: Mark Aurel says, if you win Hermes, I will give you a special made gladiator watch. Oh, nice. Yeah, he's going to give you a gladiator watch, yeah. Wow, there are so many. I missed it while we were arguing about the fifth round. Hey, Marvin, guys, here. Levan will eat Hermes. Levan is too strong. And one more.
SPEAKER_07: Weld Mishraff says, Hermes can win. He is super strong and has the heart of a lion. All the best, Hermes. We support you. Thank you, guys. Music Guy says, whoever likes cookies more will win.
SPEAKER_07: Like whoever likes the cookies more will win the match. What is eat the cookies? Cookie, like cookie, you know, you cook like a, you eat, you know. Ah, but biscuit. Yeah, something, but not really biscuit, but cookie, yeah, yeah. Anmol says, Hermes will win this time, Levan also knows this. Is that true, Levan? Hermes will win this time, this guy says? Yes, he knows, he knows. And he says Levan knows as well.
SPEAKER_05: Hermes will win this time to second. Second. He will be number two. He will win second place. But how is it? If he lose against me, he can't be second because he's not going down. Okay, let me see another super chat. Yeah, one more. Dino says, Teddy...
SPEAKER_07: My Teddy, we're going to shave your beard and belly. This guy is just picking on you. And Armutan says, my friend Armutan says bring back microphones for the Atlas. My friend, it just happened one event and majority of the match Atlas had the microphone, a few matches they didn't. And then the event after we had it. So it looks like you are not really following and
SPEAKER_07: And then, okay, Bukharat says, my question to Hermes, how much weight is he going to be in this match? And is this important? Weight factor is important. He's asking if it is important. Okay. It is not too much important because I prefer to stay more down than grow up to three kilos, only water, you know, no problem.
SPEAKER_07: No, not important. Okay. Guys, do you have any message to the fans and also any last word to each other? Do you guys want to say anything? Ermes, I'm interested in the training videos you put out. Is that gym in your house?
SPEAKER_06: No, no. Yes, but the house of my parents. My dad and my mom. He's not here. When I was born, I was with my family. Ermes, there is one more question. Engie, my question, please. Ermes, do you think Lewand is cute when he armwrestles?
SPEAKER_06: with him really i never had some trouble to go set up it's very fair no no no he asked like is he cute you know like nice you know yeah too much yes he kissed my face last time you sure yes listen listen during the magic is here
SPEAKER_07: Yeah. Which round? You don't remember? He come and kiss you? Yeah, my friend. I love you. Which round? Which round? Third, fourth. Oh, after he finished? Yeah, yeah. He come and kiss you. Okay. Okay. Okay. Why did you do that, Lewand? Why did you kiss him? You want to comfort him? I love him. You love him, yeah? Okay.
SPEAKER_07: Werner says, if you beat Levan, Hermes or when you beat Levan, you're number one in the world, what's next for you? Are you going to arm wrestle left hand just for fun? After you beat Levan, what's next for you? What do you want to do next? I don't want to think now. For sure, we compete for many years, I hope, and we fight with everyone.
SPEAKER_06: Left, I have too much pain, I don't know. My left is not good, really. Too much pain. Okay, and do you have, what is your last message to each other or to the fans? Nothing, I hope he will travel, it will be good. I hope he will prepare everything to be super strong, like mask, Coca-Cola.
SPEAKER_06: And I feel my friend now is the time. There are two weeks. I can't wait to pull. That's it. I can't wait to pull really can't wait to see my result on the table.
SPEAKER_07: While we are talking, one more super chat. Mapozian says, last video about Levan's life was great. Hermes, you need to drive to Italian mountains once again and film it. No, I will go Italy, and we will do one with your family, Hermes. The next documentary, we need to do it, yeah. And OK, before I close, I need to say this. By the way, Levan, once again, thank you very much for the hospitality when we come to your home.
SPEAKER_07: I said, what if you cannot control Hermes' pronators and you overpronate? And Levan said, he will control all of your life, Hermes. I control all Italy. Oh. I take Rome, Rome, you know? Oh, so you will be the emperor of the Rome. Oh, yeah, yeah. All roads is going in Rome. Impossible, my friend. I coming to take.
SPEAKER_05: Impossible to control Empire of Rome. Too strong. Caesar, gladiators, all. So you will be the new emperor of the Rome?
SPEAKER_07: Yeah, Georgia is in wait in Rome. Oh, Hermes. Hermes, now you are not on me. Georgian king is coming, Georgian army. Hermes, now this is a different thing. He's saying he's going to come and take over Rome. Are you going to let this guy? Are you going to let this guy? My friend, the Roman Empire don't know Georgia.
SPEAKER_07: I think they don't know where is it, Georgia. Too much small. Too much strong empire. I'm not doing anything. You guys are just going to... We understand what he says. He says the empire of Rome is so big and they don't even know where Georgia is because Georgia is small. They know. They know. They know. They know? Okay. Okay. So now, so this is Georgian empire versus Rome.
SPEAKER_06: Next time when I will give him the rematch, we will fight on the Colosseum in the middle. In Italy? Yeah. Imagine the change.
SPEAKER_07: 5,000 people. Do you think they would allow us to organize this? Maybe here in Verona, not Colosseum, maybe in Verona, maybe there are some possibilities. Do you think they would allow if you ask for permission? Maybe, yes. Levan, are you not going to thank him? He says that after he beats you, he will allow you for a rematch. I don't want a rematch. I don't want a rematch.
SPEAKER_07: A very good man, my friend. Very good guy. How much do you pay? I know you're joking, but yeah. So that is the only way. Either car hits you or he gives you a million dollar or...
SPEAKER_00: So you are basically saying it's impossible, Levan. When something doesn't exist, how can I say that it exists? I can't tell lies. Alien exists, my friend. Remember, alien exists. I saw one.
SPEAKER_06: Show one? Who is that? Yeah, I show one time in the night, I show one alien. Seriously, it was look like what? I don't remember very well. You show one time but you don't remember, okay. It was very big. Do you think that... It is me. It is me, Herbert.
SPEAKER_07: I will be. That's how it goes. It was me. It was you and then it was in his dream, right? After Dubai. But Levan, just imagine. Ready, go. Hermes is loading, loading, back pressure. You go and your wrist like straight. Does it scare you to think there's such possibility?
SPEAKER_07: You will beat him. Last time you tried this, he didn't allow you. Hermes says that nobody can beat him after he top rolls him. He cannot beat him. This is what you said, right, Hermes? If I take his wrist? Yeah, take his wrist, yeah. No way? No. No way.
SPEAKER_06: Yeah, of course. If he takes my wrist, how can I win? But you look like... So you are saying if your wrist stays? So is that wrist ready, Lewand? Your wrist is 100% now, his wrist. Yeah. Did Lewand share any wrist care with you this time? No. Why do you think that he didn't share, Hermes?
SPEAKER_05: Ah, because I don't think his wrist is 100%. Is 100% or not? Do you feel pain or still pain or not?
SPEAKER_00: Actually, I don't train my wrist with a dumbbell anymore after that incident. So now I train with the cable machine on blocks. Go ahead. Do you feel 100% or not this time?
SPEAKER_05: Yes, because in general, in terms of practice, I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it feels very good. I'm assessing by the table time, by the table practice. I feel fully confident. I don't train with the dumbbell anymore because I was just chasing weights. So at the moment I'm focusing on the table time.
SPEAKER_00: And would that be with Irakli or anybody else, my sparring partners? My wrist feels very good. I have no doubts with that. So that's the way I see it. I agree with what Shirov said. Irakli, Sandro, they are all very good fighters.
SPEAKER_05: I'm lucky that my sparring partners, would that be Rock Lee or Sandro, are very good top rollers.
SPEAKER_07: So during the sparring, I test the wrist really well. And that gives me all that I need. Ermes, he says that his training partners, he said he's lucky because they are very good top rowers. Do you think that it is possible then to make Levan's wrist feel what you will make him feel?
SPEAKER_06: for this georgian are very lucky to have a lot of strong people to training together in italy not too much no that's not what i'm asking yeah yeah yeah i'm coming but i think yes maybe iraqi and another guy i don't know who is it but
SPEAKER_06: He's very strong. They are very strong. But with me, I think he will feel a completely different pressure in his wrist and in the arm. It depends on how he is doing the training. Many things are very different. Okay. How much does Hermes cure?
SPEAKER_07: How much do you curl, 92 kilo? How we dumbbell or what? I don't know, he said how much he curls, so just answer however you want, because he didn't say in a specific way. Deadlift. Deadlift.
SPEAKER_07: Devon's forearm says, Levon needs to pull more often. Period. My friend, just please tell me, just Levon, instead of twice a year, if he would pull three times a year, just please tell me six matches that you want him to pull this year and next year.
SPEAKER_07: Can you find six opponents and then do you promise that you are not going to complain when I set him six different guys? You are not going to say, oh, why did you set this guy against Levan? My friend, I am having the hardest time of my life to find an opponent for him. And now they want me to. And then whenever you put, I don't want to mention names, like when we set Jerry match, they say, oh, why did you set Jerry? So whenever I said, more or less, they will say the same thing.
SPEAKER_07: So there are only like right now in my mind, you, Laletin and Devon, you know, these are the ones that, you know, like possibly good opponents, you know. And then music guy says that was Devon, not Alien, what you saw, Hermes, the guy says. Ah, maybe, maybe. OK, OK. And I think no more Super Chat. Yes, that's OK.
SPEAKER_07: Yeah, Devon's forearm says, pull anyone in top 10. I just want to see him pull my friend. You won't be representing the majority if I put anyone from top 10 and put like, if I put, just say, Giorgi Di Zerano versus Levan. And then when you watch the Laletin versus Giorgi Di Zerano, and when I said Levan, the next thing you're going to say, Laletin flash pin him. And now you set him against Levan. This is, I know what's going to happen.
SPEAKER_07: And one guy says, how about Ryan Bowen? Yeah, that's a good matchup for Levan. And okay, so Bahara says, Levan, pure power, Hermes quality power. Okay, please don't send more Super Chess. I have been here for like one hour, 52 minutes. I don't want to keep these athletes awake any longer. Levan Saginashvili, my friend.
SPEAKER_07: Thank you very much for being part of it. And Hermes, also thank you very, very much. Tornike, thank you very, very much. I will miss you guys once I quit doing this job. And you guys really, like, great. And I just can't wait for you. Or do you say that you will quit? Oh, whenever I quit, you know. Who knows? Yeah, yeah. Anyways, any last words you guys say? And let's finish. I'm not going to ask. Please don't send in a super chat here.
SPEAKER_05: I would like to thank you all. I would like to thank you all. I would like to thank you all. I would like to thank you all. I would like to thank you all. I would like to thank you all. I would like to thank you all.

SPEAKER_06: really can't wait to pull me too and i think it will be very hard fight and and that's it i we will see in 21 and good luck
SPEAKER_07: And because I said that some people are asking if Engin is quitting or not. I don't know. If the athletes want me to quit, I will quit. Do you want me to quit, Hermes? If you quit, they will quit me too. Why is that? Why is that? No, you can't quit, my friend. You can't. Okay. And Lewan, do you want me to quit? No, I said, I meant to give it to you, because...
SPEAKER_07: Wherever you are going, I'm coming with you. Levan, my friend, I love you. Hermes, I love you. I don't say this to the guys because it sounds a little bit geish, but still, we are brothers. And Tornike, thank you very, very much, my friend. And thanks to everyone who has been watching us. You guys will witness, my friends, just like whoever watching us, just understand one thing.
SPEAKER_07: Armwrestling today is at the highest ever level. Armwrestling has never been at this level. This match that you are going to see on June 21st is one of the most important matches in history.
SPEAKER_07: Just if you miss this match, I don't know how you call yourself arm wrestling fan unless you don't have, you know, financials for the pay-per-view. But trust me, guys, please go get your pay-per-view and do not miss this historical match where we may see a new champion or we may see Levan is just coming and destroying.
SPEAKER_07: match, Levan ended up winning. We don't know. Many times I organized matches, people said, oh, Laletin is going to kill Morozov. Why you set this match? Why you set this match? Why you set this match? It didn't end up like this. To me, Laletin versus Morozov match was one of the most beautiful matches ever. And at the moment that, you know,
SPEAKER_07: Morozov stopped him and was saying like, do I? I was like, wow, is it real? Like, I was like, well, it was beautiful. I mean, I can't imagine anything like, like a few moments, like when, when Devon and Levan pulled the match stop at the middle, I was like, wow, is it real? Like the life stop, you know, two of the most unforgettable moments was like, also you versus Levan match, that round three that you stopped. I was like,
SPEAKER_07: Is it real, you know? So it is beautiful. These matches, Levan, you are incredible at it. You dominate everyone. But what makes these matches unforgettable is that because you are super dominant guy, anyone who gives you a little bit trouble, like for us, it's like shock. You understand? So it is not because disrespect to you, but it is mostly because of seeing, like you, how high, you know?
SPEAKER_07: And the same thing with Alijan and Matushenko, round one, they stop at the middle. I was like, wow, you know, incredible. So we love arm wrestling, and this is the best arm wrestling fans
SPEAKER_07: West 18 just get your pay-per-view and support the support that you love because this is the unification East versus West is the unification of all the top athletes to make sure that our power is all together just
