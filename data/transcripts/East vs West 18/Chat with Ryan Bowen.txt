SPEAKER_01: It's good to see. It's been a while. How long has it been that we haven't seen each other in person? East versus West five. You're probably better with this. It is November 2022. Is it really that long? Wow. That's crazy. Five years. Time flies. Two and a half years.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know what they were thinking. Man, time flies. Oh, good. Yeah, that's unbelievable. November 22. Yeah. I'm literally stunned by that. But that's awesome. Thank you for having me on. I really appreciate the fact that you reached out after seeing the video yesterday. Awesome.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, there is nothing. Time is the best healer of a lot of things. So how are you doing? What's your weight right now?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, well, I'm doing well at the moment. I'm on the way eating carbs again now. I went through a big phase when prep for my last match where I was not eating carbs, but now I'm eating carbs again and doing a lot of powerlifting training, which has been really enjoyable. So my weight for me is pretty much bang on 100 at the moment.
SPEAKER_00: I think I can go anywhere. The heaviest I've been is 107 and the lightest I've been in a walk around sense is like 91, 92 in my walk around. Your heaviest is 107?
SPEAKER_00: heaviest was 107 when I faced schoolboy which was but mind you I look like my own father then like I was I see photos of that I was really fat and it didn't look good so yeah yeah but they're much better much better now I'm my approach in the last sort of six months has been to I well I spent the better part of the first 10 years of my arm wrestling career focusing on my handed wrist and then
SPEAKER_00: Then in the last sort of three years, I've been trying to work out how to backfill and actually become strong in the rest of my body. And so I think I'm finally starting to get my head around that. With a good powerlifting coach, I'm really enjoying just lifting heavy things in the gym. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah. And you're getting back onto the table? Not so soon because I just started. I think I'm like maximum, maximum. I don't know. Like maybe with some forearm and like specific things, you know, I may not be so far, maybe like 70% of my best, but like other things that like shoulders, chest, upper arm, you know, like,
SPEAKER_01: I, and also the table, you know, I, I think I'm like maximum 50, 60%. Yeah. I am hoping. Yeah. Because it has been so long and so difficult, so exhausting, you know, last, last three and a half years. Um, yeah, it, it is, it wasn't easy because I, I had been on mission and a lot of things I had been trying to do by myself. Are you there? Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Because I see you frozen. Do you think that you should go out and come back again? Because your picture is frozen. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, okay, he came. Sorry. Yeah, now it's moving again, yeah. Yeah, what were you saying? I didn't hear you. The connection wasn't so good, but... I was going to ask you, did I see footage of you pulling Mendoza's Teresaitis? Was that just the other day that you released on your Facebook page? Was that current?
SPEAKER_01: Was that from a while ago? No, no, it wasn't. It was current. I would just come and probably give hell to anyone up to 85 kilos. But it was right after I beat Viorel Dobrin. I pulled a super match with Viorel Dobrin. And Minda was pulling the best 78 kilos. And right after that, yeah, we were training. But I was heavier than him.
SPEAKER_01: I was thinking that that was Karim. I was like, oh man. No, no, no, no. If it was Karim, how can I be 50% or 60%? That day he could hold me like this and still I would give him trouble that day. But not now, you know, just yeah. And so how is everything going? Yeah, you mentioned yesterday you made a video. A lot of people reached out and people said, you know,
SPEAKER_01: know ryan made a video about you and things like that and yeah um ryan
SPEAKER_01: Ryan, it's again, again, you know, like you're not really good connection. Is it? Yeah, yeah. I think, yeah, everyone is saying the same. It's not only me. Yeah, yeah. Okay. I apologize. No, no, no, no problem. Anything can happen, you know, yeah. Yeah, I see you. Like, I see that you are more involved in the elite arm wrestling, you know, with your subjects and everything, you know, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: yeah yeah and nowadays there's so much to talk about with your events are happening so often that there's just a constant flow of subjects and yeah and the the battle for the battle for who's supreme in the world obviously levan's there but it's heating up with with devin and ermis and vitaly and even and michael like this there's just so many people that are
SPEAKER_00: chomping at the bit and coming for that top spot. I feel like the sport's getting quite interesting at the moment. I'm not sure if Le Mans is going to be defeated by any of those guys, but it's an exciting time to be a fan of the sport. I'm happy to be back creating content. When did you start your YouTube channel? Sorry.
SPEAKER_01: My phone just started doing weird stuff then, I apologize. When did you start your YouTube channel? My YouTube channel, 2013. So about like around like 2018, 17, 19, like we didn't really think that, you know, East and West, you know, would be...
SPEAKER_01: pulling against each other. Like if you remember those years that like we had a lot of polls on the social media, what if this guy would pull this guy? What if this guy would pull that guy? And now like every six weeks, seven weeks, you know, they are regularly pulling against each other. And so it looks, yeah, interesting. And we have very, very good matches in the next event. It will be King of the Table 14.
SPEAKER_01: Nice, nice. When will all the matches be public for those next events? I mean, all this week, you know, like maybe two or three announcements every day, you know, and then we will boom, boom, boom, you know, every day, you know, just I like to make community happy, you know, just share those matches and then when they like it, I'm happy, you know.
SPEAKER_00: and yeah well you're putting food on a lot of people's tables too like i said uh as a youtube content creator myself i like um i constantly have something to talk about like you can't keep up with it every every day i wake up and i i check what what controversial thing has been said by one of the top top 10 guys in the world there's always something
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, you would think that those Eastern Europeans are like the respectful, quiet guys. But yesterday, Vitaly Laletin also said a lot of provocative things. You know, he told about Hermes. Hermes said, don't listen to Hermes. Hermes says this kind of things just to prove that he is still better than me. And, you know, things like that. And a lot of people wrote on. Of course, I don't miss it as an opportunity. I make a poster. They both go, you know.
SPEAKER_01: And then underneath, you know, people write the comments, you know, oh, yeah, Hermes is still a lot better than you. And some people say, no, now Latin is better. Yeah, in the first difference, like six, seven, eight years ago, we would only talk about these things. Now, these are reality.
SPEAKER_00: I like seeing that there are a significant number of fans behind more than just one athlete. For a good period of time in the sport, Devin was really the only guy that had a big following and a big wave of fans behind him. He has been the locomotive. I think he still probably has the most.
SPEAKER_01: The Hermes fans are out there and they're just as loud and the Latin fans and the Soplinco fans. That was the main goal. That was the main goal, yeah. I just wanted, I just listened. Devon has been the window outside of Armisen's world, you know. And, like, he really did a very good job with that one. And our main intention was that when people come in from that window, we would
SPEAKER_01: we wanted them to find something beautiful wow there is a leak there are weight categories there are regular events there are uh rankings titles you know oh wow so this is something to be taken uh seriously that that was and i wanted all those armwrestler fans to become arm wrestling fans as well so that you know like i would we wouldn't want michael jordan to
SPEAKER_01: retire and nobody likes basketball or we wouldn't want Maradona to quit and then oh okay football finish for me as I said you know Devon did the best job about this but we want everyone to remain uh to be an arm wrestling player we want them to see the beauty of the sport you know
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. Well, you've done a good job because it's said that way. Like, looking at it from my perspective, I see so much depth now in the fan base, which is the biggest thing for it to become that legitimate sport. And watching the crowds turn up at their events, it's pretty intense. So, yeah, well done. But also, I'm curious thinking, do you... I want to ask about...
SPEAKER_01: the race for the top at the moment. First question, do you think anyone's going to beat Levine in the next two years? Do you think it will happen? I should be asking these questions. As an organizer, I can't... Some people say, you can share your opinion. It's okay, you know. And some people say, no, no, no. Once you...
SPEAKER_01: share your opinion and then people will start like oh and you want this guy to lose and you want this guy to win they are just waiting like this you know just to attack you know it's an opportunity oh and you said this did you hear that you know so uh i don't know i don't know i i i better ask you what do you think
SPEAKER_00: I feel like it will happen, but I think the reason it will happen is because there's more than one wolf sort of coming for him. There's a pack of wolves coming for him. And it's hard to defend against four guys. And I think there's three or four guys that have a shot legitimately at him in the next two years.
SPEAKER_00: For me, the most dangerous, in my opinion, is Ermes. I think he might do it on his next one. Probably not, but he might. But I think Ermes, I think Vitaly Lilletin, I think Devin, and then outside,
SPEAKER_00: just less a chance, I think, is Michael. But the first three I mentioned to me are all very dangerous. And Levan, to defend against all of those different styles, he's got a lot on his plate. I feel like he will fall in the next two years. I feel like he will. And it's a race to be the one that gets to wear the crown first.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I love the tension between those three guys because those three guys put, like, any time Ermes, Vitaly or Devin are facing each other, it's a bloodbath as well. But they're all kind of, like, if they don't get in each other's way and everyone has a crack at Levan one after the other sort of thing, I think you'll fall. I think you will. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I mean, yeah, I think the things are going to get more and more exciting. And I think that, you know, Ryan, it is not possible to enter a war and remain sinless. Yeah. You understand? But the main goal for all of us
SPEAKER_01: is to bring like there is one thing in common with in all of us that we agree we don't agree with each other there are some beef or these or that there's one thing that we love our medicine we all love our medicine and another thing in common we want to see this support as a mainstream one like we want to see this sport in arenas with thousands of people coming and it's already started
SPEAKER_01: and coming and watching. Did you see the venue for the Arlington? Yeah, yeah. It looked amazing. And that is something to be proud of for all of us. Yeah, all of us. And we all have some portion in it. I do, you do, fans do, athletes do, sponsors do. We all, we all.
SPEAKER_01: Some maybe a little bit bigger, some a little bit less, but we all do, you know, because we all are, you know, in the same boat. And I think that, yeah, no matter what has happened on the battlefield, I think that there is something that unites all of us, which is the love we have for the sport and the goal, you know, that we have, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: of the sport has been nothing but amazing, to be honest. I think I've had the pleasure of traveling to 16 different nations so far. I think that is from last count for arm wrestling. And that to me is pretty amazing. And every nation that you go to, you're welcomed.
SPEAKER_00: And even if you don't speak the same language as the arm wrestlers that you're visiting, it still feels like you know them and that you've known them forever because you grew up and we're all arm wrestlers at the end of the day. So it's an easy language to speak. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: And it never stops, too. It's got to be the best sport for longevity out there. I don't think there is another sport that has this degree of longevity to it, where you can still be a world champion in your 60s, for goodness sake. Like, is Todd Hutchins 60 yet? He must be close. 58 or 59, and yeah, yeah. And he's about to pull Rustam Babahev. And, you know...
SPEAKER_01: Like you are one of those guys, like I will tell you in last five years, the number of the fans really grew a lot. But there are some people that knows like the history as well. You are probably maybe 20 years later than me.
SPEAKER_01: you know probably yeah everybody will start but still you are not the like the newest generation you said that 2013 um so when did you start arm wrestling 2010 or something i started arm wrestling so i'm i'm uh 12. okay but but you know the history between rushtan bava and tatashins right
SPEAKER_00: Oh, yes, yes, I remember the 6-0 at the Vendetta that they last faced, I think, so... Yeah. That'll be... I mean, that's a pressure match for Todd, given how Rustam did run over him last time. Like, Todd has looked so good the way he's dealt with Iraq recently, but you can't help but feel like...
SPEAKER_00: When Rustam faced Todd last time, it was 6-0 and it was a dominant 6-0. And Todd couldn't... It was like Rustam was just dictating the lanes. Todd couldn't even put variation into the match. It was just the same thing over and over and over again. So I don't know. One thing that you've got to give Todd credit for is he...
SPEAKER_00: He does like to go away and train specifically for an opponent. And he does identify which vector is going to be the problematic vector. And then he goes and makes that really strong. So he will no doubt remember what Rustam did in terms of what technical lane he used. And Rustam was just so fast last time. And I remember hanging out with Todd Hutchins one time. It was when we were in Moldova.
SPEAKER_00: And he said to me, he said, my problem is I'm American fast. I'm not Bulgarian fast. So I don't know. I think that the speed of Rustam was a problem last time. So I can't wait to see how he deals with it. But yeah, Todd's amazing at his age. So is that match on the May 10 card? Yeah, 95 kilo world title match. Amazing, amazing. Very good. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: yeah yeah yeah but it's not the same todd you know like todd that was giving his pronator and going inside and um now he's dragging out so i'm gonna block this guy you know just just uh put it i guess someone else you know yeah yeah yeah just people are like really some yeah
SPEAKER_01: yeah yeah and they will they will have yeah 95 kilo world title match and i'm telling you that todd was giving his pronator it was making you know everything easier for russo um i'm not saying that rusham couldn't control uh todd's pronation but right now like listen whenever somebody is beating todd if you realize those are the people usually controlling his pronator with the wrist once you try to take
SPEAKER_01: his wrist, you are over pronating and you are actually missing here because you are pronating. And once you are missing here, it means that even Todd is losing his hand, he still has pronator. So then he's hitting you, hitting you, hitting you. And like you are thinking that you find a witness by taking their hand, but actually you are really going into a trap, you know? Yeah. Yeah. Walking straight into his power.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, the most vicious loss I've ever seen on Todd Hutchins was probably either against Prudnik or maybe even Alan Makiev. Yeah, but listen, those tournament losses are a bit different, you understand? Alan's is a really, really fresh match, you understand? Yeah, of course, it counts and everything, but the Supermatch is a little bit different.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, you may have round one, 30 seconds match, while the other guy that you meet at the round two had flash pin on the round one. So it's not the real outcome. Of course, there's no excuse you go to the tournament. I mean, you need to win. You know the conditions, anything can happen. Unless you are one head above everyone, anything may happen. You may be the best guy, fresh or fresh, you may end up 10th place there.
SPEAKER_00: I like that for Todd's first 95-kilo world title defense, he's got to fight Rostov because there's probably other guys that are also worthy of the title match that Todd would be more confident against. But I like that he's got a hard match stylistically. He's got to prove that he can turn it around. So that's awesome. You know, with the longevity, I was thinking about it the other day.
SPEAKER_00: Devin turns 50 pretty soon, I think, if not already. I feel like Devin will arm wrestle forever, for sure, until he dies. I reckon he might be... I know I'm going a long way into the future, but I can see with the longevity of the sport, given that we have arm wrestlers that are world champions in their 60s,
SPEAKER_01: I reckon Devon, I'm going to put the prediction out there that Devon will be the first world number one in any given weight category at the age of 70. I think if he's still around at 70, Devon will be still coming. Yeah, yeah. There is a super chat. Provin Astrology says, what parts of the world have had the greatest growth in arm wrestling interest recently? And has that translated to pay-per-view sales yet?
SPEAKER_00: I'm not 100% sure, but possibly Europe. Possibly Europe. Yeah. Well, I can say of Australia, in the 13 years that I've been involved in the sport, I've seen the national, any given club in Australia used to have two or three people. Now it's got 30 or 40 people.
SPEAKER_00: And in each city, the capital city of Australia, there might be five or six clubs. So we've seen really big growth. And I feel like everywhere around the world would be doing something similar. Yeah, right. Every national championships in Europe, the numbers are doubled, tripled. You understand? Like today we had Turkish nationals with 1783 people.
SPEAKER_01: Not the registered arm, it's actual people. Almost near 2,000 people at the national championships, and many of them are qualified in their city to come there. That's the same as India. I've been to India a few times, and the numbers there, as you can imagine, with their population,
SPEAKER_00: they cap their state titles and they'll have thousands at their state titles and then have to cap their nationals to 5,000 people or something like that because they just got so many people interested in the sport. So I think everywhere it's growing. Yes, everywhere. The Romanian championships, German championships, French nationals, Norwegian nationals, like all over, all over. The numbers are growing like crazy.
SPEAKER_01: Like I will tell you something like you go off and then you ask, just go to the junior competition day and ask those junior guys, you know, who are your favorite arm masters? I will tell you 95% of them will say a name from the East versus West stage. Yeah. This is really inspiring, but I'm telling you,
SPEAKER_01: In my opinion, what WAF is doing is the most important thing. Just like you understand everything I'm saying. You are a knowledgeable guy. Just look at those guys at the East versus West. More than 95% of them, like the really top ones, are coming from WAF. They came as a junior guy, even sub-junior guy. And the junior guy, that competition between them, the Kazakhs, the Russians, and the Georgians, Ukrainians, Bulgarians, Turks, you know,
SPEAKER_01: They just, European championships, they fight, they learn something, go do the homework, come back, go compete again. Next year, Europeans, even the national championships are so hard. So that competition is just making the sport growing. And then the best ones are coming to our stage, you know?
SPEAKER_01: So look at those guys, you know, like Levan is from there, Gennady is from there, Morozov from there, Laratin from there. Michael has competed four or five times. I can't say that he's grown like in WAP, but I just see bright, you know, like future is bright. The only thing is that we need to make sure that we stay unified, you know, that is my opinion, you know.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, I've had a different pathway. I did pull WAF in 2015, and that's the only WAF championship that I've pulled. But because I tried to make it a career, and I got to the point in 2018 where arm wrestling was earning enough for me that I could call it a career.
SPEAKER_00: My pathway to growth as an athlete for myself has just been through more the commercial side of wrestling as opposed to the WAF side. But, yeah, it's awesome watching the sport grow. Talking about national championships, I've got to do a shout-out.
SPEAKER_01: You know of Rickard Bormann down in Australia who's doing really well. Did you know that he will be in the next North American cards? He will be? I think, I think, I think, I think. Looks like, you know.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, look, look, look. You're sending shivers down my spine hearing that. I'm such a big fan of Ricard Portman. But that is hugely exciting. Ricard's strong. He's really strong. And he's young. He's only in his third year now of the sport. And I can't feel. You know, some arm wrestlers, you can feel the limit where they are.
SPEAKER_00: He's, what, 113 kilos? What's his weight category? He's 127 kilos. He's a big boy. Then he will be super overweight now.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, he can get down to 115, but he's a big boy. He's very big. But, you know, I've got to give him a shout out and talk about the genetics of his family. He's got a 16-year-old brother who entered South African Nationals two days ago, and he won the juniors in the open weight, and then he won the 110-kilo seniors as well, and he's only 16. And you go, there's something in the Boardman.
SPEAKER_00: genes that might make these guys strong so there's another one coming i i feel like the the bornman brothers will out of south africa will be a name that we all talk about for many years to come i just i just they're too they're too strong too quickly like you don't see many 16 year old winning senior men's nationals at 110. yeah yeah yeah yeah so exciting
SPEAKER_01: That's awesome. A lot of people are surprised that we are doing the podcast together right now. That may be surprising, but for one year, we have been communicating by messaging, Instagram. We have been communicating. Where do you see yourself as a commentator and as an athlete? As a commentator?
SPEAKER_00: As a commentator and an athlete, from the very beginning of my involvement in the sport in 2013, I was dreaming of doing both. And I always said to myself, I'm going to run them in parallel. I'm going to become an athlete and I'm going to become a commentator. I think what actually makes me a good commentator, at least part of it, is
SPEAKER_00: the fact that I studied the sport so relentlessly in terms of the technique. When I started as an arm wrestler, I wasn't strong and I recognized that, well, if I'm going to become a national champion or whatever that I was pursuing at the time, I'm going to need to move very efficiently. So I said to myself, I trust the strength will arrive and I'm just going to focus purely on mastering the movements of arm wrestling.
SPEAKER_00: And in the process of doing that and becoming a better athlete, I think I started to identify what was going on and that translated to my commentary. And so I really enjoy commentating in a way where I just describe what each athlete is
SPEAKER_00: is doing, what they're trying to achieve, and I feel like I can see it almost in slow motion, and I'm able to convey that to the audience. So I do really enjoy the commentary side of things. I've often, if you were to chart my progress in the sport as a commentator,
SPEAKER_01: next to my progress in the sport as an athlete, I think my commentary is better. I tend to rank higher in the world for commentary than I do at the table. Yeah, but the reason is that there are not so many people that can commentate and there are not so many people that are invested, you understand?
SPEAKER_01: commentate while there are hundreds of thousands of people probably training for armwrestling. It is a little bit tougher. But still, there are not many people that can commentate. For example, I'm a knowledgeable guy about armwrestling, but I'm not a native English-speaking guy. You understand? Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: But I must tell you that you have been traveling for arm wrestling. You have been traveling. You have been in the U.S. just to promote arm wrestling.
SPEAKER_01: and you represented your country and like there is no doubt about your love for our nursing there is no doubt you know you and i we had we had our disagreements and everything but that that is totally different it has nothing to do with what i am talking right now you know like nobody can can deny that you really love and you are um how to say
SPEAKER_01: obsessed about armlessing and i i i i was the same way you know i was the same way i i if i am still or not i don't know but but when i was very young and when i went to us only for just because there were so many tournaments to compete and i i i kept on my mind i didn't write anything like how many tournaments hundreds of tournaments competing how many categories i won who i beat in the final like like
SPEAKER_01: I stopped, you know, after counting like how many Russians I beat and how many times I lost them, I had like 60 versus five or something. And then after some point I was like, you know, just everything just out, you know, if I really think maybe I would remember, but
SPEAKER_01: You know, I was trying to, like, one time Rambet says that Engin knows about Rambet more than Rambet knows about Rambet, you know. Because the first time I met him, I was just saying, hey, you remember you did this there and you did this there, you win this category. And the guy was like, who are you, you know? Yeah, yeah. I can certainly relate to not having a good memory about my own stats. I mean, I get in trouble all the time for it.
SPEAKER_00: contradicting myself so i i i gotta learn to keep my mouth shut a little bit more often but but um but yeah i i i get that i understand the feeling and so it's a long journey in the sport as an athlete but i i i know that i'll be in the sport for life um i i no matter what no matter what i i enjoy it too much it's it's big it's become like i said 13 years in now it's become it's become
SPEAKER_00: It really is a part of me. He couldn't offer me a job for a million dollars salary a year if it meant that I had to get away from armwrestling. I just wouldn't be interested at all. How old are you now? I turned 40 in a few weeks. You started armwrestling very late then, huh?
SPEAKER_00: yeah yeah i 20 28 years old 27 and a half when i when i started i'm wrestling so yeah prior to that i was in in the military and then the sport that i was into as a as a kid was tennis so always into something but i'm wrestling from the age of 27 yeah yeah what year what year did you start how old were you i was like about 16.
SPEAKER_01: I was 16 and I started at 18th birthday, I became second in seniors. How long until you won your first world title? I won my first world title before I turned 20, I was still 19.
SPEAKER_01: In the senior category. At that time, we didn't have the junior, sub-junior, youth. I don't understand the 23-year-old guy is just pulling youth category. It's good. It's good that they remain in the sport. Because as soon as they turn 19, if they are in the seniors and they get destroyed a couple of years, maybe they would be discouraged. You understand? So they keep them until 23. So they are still...
SPEAKER_01: You know, building, building, building. It's good, you know, it's good what they are doing, yeah. But we never had that kind of chance to pull. There was no junior category when I was competing. And, yeah. How about Samusha versus Pauline? The revenge match at 95 kilos on May 10th. May 10th? Okay, Samusha. How big is he going to be? Because he's normally one of 85. Usually he's around 90 kilos and going down to 85.
SPEAKER_01: This time he's 90 kilo, probably he will try to bulk up. So I think that he will be 92, 93 kilo. Last time they pulled, Paul was 100 kilo on the scale and Samush was 87 kilo. So if Paul gained a few kilos or something, there was about 15 kilo. And this time they will be around the same weight.
SPEAKER_01: And at that time, Paul was still new in the sport. I mean, when I say new, still, you know, he started late. You know, he didn't start as a young guy. And Paul improved a lot. And then Samusha also, it was his first match after COVID. You understand? So right now, we will be seeing, like, their best shape. I'm curious about what Samusha can do in 95 kilos.
SPEAKER_01: Was that match against Paul in the last time Samusha lost the match? Paul won 3-2. Yeah, Paul won. So is that the last time Samusha lost? Or has he been defeated since? That was the first and last time Samusha lost at the East vs West. He pulled 11 times. It was his first match. He pulled higher category. And then he won 10 matches in a row.
SPEAKER_01: So Paul is the only one that beat Samusha, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, well, it will be interesting. So if they're going to meet at that weight, at 95 kilos, that's a scary sounding samusha for sure. That's the first factor that I think of. But then I also think of Paul Lin is one of the best people I've ever seen at weight cutting. So Paul Lin will weigh in at 95, but then he'll compete at 102 or 103 or something like that. At least 100. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, so he still will be the bigger guy, I think, on the day. But a Samusha at that weight, you know that he's going to have more horsepower behind him
SPEAKER_00: than it already is and you know I remember from that first match that they faced that that that Paul tends to like like Paul's got a pin Samusha fairly early I don't think Paul can win the long battle if they get stuck down in center and they're putting their frames against each other Samusha is going to come through so Paul's going to have to be the one on the offense and and and ah yeah it's it's it's a hard one to pick because all these new variables but
SPEAKER_00: Then again, when I think about the way Paul pulled through Lachlan Adair at King of the Table, I remember I was there for that. And he looked absolutely savage the way that he was able to keep his pronation high whilst driving sideways in a hook. And that's what he got with Samusha. He was able to just keep that pronation high enough and get those critical pins. But my gosh, a big Samusha, that's an X factor. You know what was interesting?
SPEAKER_01: like Paul beat Lachlan much more convincingly than Krasimir did. Yes, yes. And then Krasimir beat Paul, you know. Yeah, armwrestling masked, it's pretty wild sometimes. Maybe it was the style thing, maybe that they were in like what shape, you know what I mean? Yeah, so I think maybe it was the case, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Do you think that Samocha will make himself a 95-kilo pull-up permanently? I don't think so. He won 10 world titles in 1985. He said he wants to win two more to make it 12. Or is he already 11? I think he won 10 of them.
SPEAKER_01: Nur Dalet from Kazakhstan was the only one that really came close, wasn't it? Yeah, he was very close, very close, and also Sasho wasn't that far either. Sasho lost 4-3 and Nur Dalet lost 4-3, but if Nur Dalet had any of this shoulder press, he could have won.
SPEAKER_01: I invited Nurdalet Aydarhan to pull Samushya, but around that day, I think he had either Asian championships or something, so he couldn't make it. But if people think that why we don't give a match to Aydarhan, Aydarhan is more than welcome anytime. He's my brother, and he's incredible, so there is no doubt. The day sometimes, because the guy pulls Kazakhstan nationals,
SPEAKER_01: Asian championships, world championships. It is not that easy. It's not that easy. I think Kazakhstan's got an arm fight or something as well with it. Kazakhstan versus Uzbekistan coming up as well. I think I saw something like that the other day. Yeah, yeah. And after this podcast, what time is it? Probably right after this, I will announce a match that people will be surprised.
SPEAKER_00: I think. I'll be watching your Instagram. Yeah, very soon we will be sharing the posters everywhere.
SPEAKER_01: You got me excited when you said Ricard Vormann is going to be in a US one. That is most likely, but soon to be finalised. Are there like three or four names that you can mention that his opponent might be? Oh, no, no, no, no, no. We don't have any opponent yet. Okay, okay. I'm just thinking to invite him. I'm just planning to invite him, but we don't know the opponent. And something new just I learned.
SPEAKER_01: you said he is 127 kilo what i remember not long ago he was about 115 120 around that he was so it means that now he became a super heavyweight guy so we need to we need to um where do you think he is that like like when i do the match up you know so if i invite him you know where do you think we should set him you know like is he like a david cheffy level
SPEAKER_00: Probably not. Look, honestly, if I was considering the match, I would set him schoolboy. I find that story very interesting. That's who I would say. And I think it'd be a great match. But but. But like he's like.
SPEAKER_00: After he beat Don Underwood in his first international match very convincingly, he then gripped up with Ron Barth in the after-pulling and Ron Barth couldn't move him at all and Ron Barth just bowed down to him and literally did that and said, I can't move you a centimetre. This guy is very good.
SPEAKER_01: And Ron could not move him at all. He's strong. I don't know where that puts you. How much higher than Ron is Dave Chaffee in horsepower? No doubt some, but I don't know. If Ron was in his prime, we would be talking about different. But Ron is also probably about 63 years old or 62, 63. And so I don't know. But I'm sure that he's still very, very strong. But yeah, you gave me some ideas and then maybe we talk about it.
SPEAKER_01: And I would ask your opinion because you are from there, you know. And yeah, I mean, I don't know. I don't know anything you would like to add. And what would you think to commentate again at RFF?
SPEAKER_01: Well, it would be a dream come true sort of stuff. To be back in that environment would be amazing. So, yeah, if you think that I can add value to the East vs. West commentary team... No, no, no, I'm telling you, my friend. I'm telling you. You come to East vs. West or not, there's no doubt that you are one of the best commentators, you know. And you love it. You do that with passion and you break down the matches.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, yeah. I mean, for sure. For sure, yeah. I enjoy it. And a lot of people write the same thing, you know.
SPEAKER_00: They enjoy it as well. I appreciate that sentiment. I would be honoured to get a call to say, hey, let's do something again. And everything that happened in the past, as you said, we sorted it out a long time ago. There's nothing but respect for me towards yourself and East First West and everyone in the sport.
SPEAKER_01: yeah let's do it i don't i don't plan to involve you know forever you know that that really tires me exhausts me but i i just feel i i'm still needed and until at least you know we reach to the main goal and then we are we will be around you know but um after that you know of course there will be like look at now robert and dexter they are doing great job they also have
SPEAKER_01: passion for arm wrestling. And it made things easier for me as well. They took some of the weights, you know, from me. And I think that, like, I am not telling you that, like, that that's what I meant. When you are in a war, you know, you can't, you don't say, you know,
SPEAKER_01: or something but but just just sometimes the pressure is too much you understand because yeah i have competitive nature it is i don't give up i i give up i don't give up i just when i'm done i i move aside you understand but you you can't really i'm not talking about you you can't really make me give up i i remember myself like
SPEAKER_01: six seven years old fighting with twice eyes on me guy 10 years old he beat him up all day on christ to attack him at the end he ran away but i didn't quit i got beat up but i didn't quit so when i started something i would like to finish it so i i did and i got exhausted a lot and but i'm just saying that um
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I think everything will be better from now on to the future. Yesterday I saw your video and yeah, you were right about it. We can discuss and may not agree about inviting you as an athlete for now. Who knows about what the future will be. But about the commentator, yes, there is no need to be
SPEAKER_01: like stubborn and not to not to not to involve you when we know that you are you are you are uh good enough yeah that that i appreciate it i truly truly do yeah yeah yeah anyway so ryan would you like to add anything more and i i think that we should we should discuss more about armresting on on uh social media i think we need to do some program with with by adding some other guys that who are passionate about armresting
SPEAKER_01: and we can do some more analysing about the matches. I'm sure that people would enjoy it. As the matches come out, that's the part of the sport that I enjoy. I enjoy analysing
SPEAKER_00: how two athletes will likely collide in a technical nature, what shapes we can expect to see, what problems we can expect to see each person run into if their A game doesn't get them success. That's my favorite thing to do in the sport is just to imagine the shape of matches. And I get so excited when some matches come together because you just think, oh my goodness,
SPEAKER_00: brutal but yeah so once you start releasing all those the next round of matches we'll get stuck into it for sure and I'm enjoying doing that from my YouTube channel at the moment like I said I wake up each morning and the first thing I check is what's released. That's what you should do right this community needs more of those things you know we
SPEAKER_01: We make the content, and people like yourself, people like Ray, you understand? People like Pradeep, you understand? You guys love it, you understand? You guys love it. Nobody would be part of this without loving you, you understand? I mean, there are people, they would do it, but without love, that we... Yeah, you won't keep going.
SPEAKER_01: it will not it will not be good you understand without love nothing is good that's why the mother's food is the best you know because they do with the love you know and yeah so yeah so i i think that yeah that is how we should do it we should make more content and people like you do do analyzing also compete and and when the right time why not again competing as well
SPEAKER_00: Not now. The level is just crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy. And yeah. If I end up at an East-First West as a commentator, for me, there's so much of a thrill just to grip
SPEAKER_01: people that are there on the side table and get practice, side table group ups with people. That's exciting. I want to group up with you again. I think even just a practice pool with you, if you're in training shape, people would love that. Yeah, if I'm in training shape, we can do it, yeah. In training shape, we can do it, yeah. But yeah, trust me, trust me, that hurts a lot, you know, a lot. Like 30, more than 30 years, you know, and some people says, but
SPEAKER_01: Tatasin is 58 years old, but Tatasin started at 35. There are 23 years of miles, you know, you understand? Yeah. Yeah, it's a little bit, of course, but also the guy is genetically different, different breed. You know, you look at him, you don't think that that kind of power he's going to generate, but I mean, he's crazy strong. Yeah, yeah, he is strong, yeah. And like, whenever I look at him, he doesn't look that strong. But whenever I look at him at the table, the things he's doing,
SPEAKER_01: then then you understand how strong he is you know yeah yeah it's different yeah yeah sounds good yeah i i really i really appreciate you you have me on thank you thank you for coming let's do a brand new beginning and yes and then let's let's do let's let's focus on what we have in common which is the love for we have our message and then yeah the best best thing to best best thing to
SPEAKER_01: cover the bad memories is to build good memories you know yeah sounds good couldn't agree more yeah yeah take care of yourself Ryan take care and thanks everyone who has been watching us yeah take care
