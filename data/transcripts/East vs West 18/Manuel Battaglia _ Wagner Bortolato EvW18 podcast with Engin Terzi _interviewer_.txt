SPEAKER_02: a lazy translator. Let's see who is the translator of Manuel. My lady. Wagner, do you know who will be Manuel's translator? Do you know who will be Manuel's translator? I don't know.
SPEAKER_02: Gasparini. Yes. Yes. No. Nice. But Gasparini has two minutes. So I think he will join us. So let's start with you, Wagner, since your translator or I should say girlfriend is here. And so how is everything, Wagner? Long time, long time injuries and some
SPEAKER_04: Bad luck. So how are you now? Now he feels ready. Now he feels confident and okay. Now he's back. So he's back. Is he going to destroy Manuel? That's the plan.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah. Manuel, Wagner says he will destroy you. No. No possible? No. No, no, no possible. No possible. Okay. You're the winner. That's good, that's good. Yeah, let Hermes join us and then let's have some good fun all together.
SPEAKER_02: So Manuel, you ready? Good form? Ready, ready. Ready? Good. Manuel, what is your weight? How many kilos you are?
SPEAKER_02: 150, 50, boy error. Balance error. I asked him, I asked him his weight. He says 150 and error. No more showing. And Wagner, what's your weight?
SPEAKER_04: Same thing. 156. 156 and some scales give the error message as well. Error as well, okay. Hello, Marta. What's that? Spaghetti. Spaghetti pizza. Spaghetti pizza, yeah. Hello, Hermes.
SPEAKER_09: Bortolato is from Veneto. Veneto is the region of Italy. No, is he really from there? Really? He's not originally Brazilian? No. He was born in Brazil, but his grandparents are from Italy. Yes. It's where I live. I live in Veneto, me too.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, so I need to deal with three Italians tonight. Wagner, do you speak any Italian? Do you speak Italian? Mangiare, mangiare. Just mangiare. Mangiare e bere. Mangiare means eating, you know, hanging. It means eating?
SPEAKER_02: Eating, yes. Just this that Wagner knows how to speak in Italian. This guy only knows what to eat in Italian. Only. Okay. Manuel, did you know that Wagner is originally from Italy? Did you know that? He is originally from Italy, not Trieste.
SPEAKER_09: he said yes oh he knew already wow and and
SPEAKER_02: But the last name, Bortolato, is it Brazilian last name or Italian last name? Italian. Italian. Italian. Italian. Wow. He still has roots with the last name. Okay. Yes. That's interesting. That's very interesting. I didn't know that. And Hermes, before you came, I asked Wagner, will you destroy Manuel?
SPEAKER_02: And you said that's the plan and Manuel said it's not possible. No possible, my friend. No possible. And Hermes, you know Wagner very well. Since both are Italian, who is winning this match? You pulled with Wagner before. Do you think it's a close match or someone's favourite? I think it's close because
SPEAKER_09: Depends who will be faster. If Portolato will be faster, he will go with the shoulder, with the press, for Manu it's very difficult. But if Manu will be faster than him, for sure about the hand, Manu is stronger.
SPEAKER_09: I think if Manoli can pull very fast in his position, he can win. Ok, ok. Ok, now I share the link, so let me focus here. He doesn't remember, but it was my first goal in the World Cup.
SPEAKER_09: He said it was the first match in the WAF. You fought already with Emanuele. When? In Poland. In Poland. They already fought in Poland. Which year was it? 2013? 2013 in Gdynia.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, 2013. Wagner, you already beat him once. I think at that time, Wagner won. Is that correct? If Wagner had... Did he win with Wagner? No, no, he had won. I had blocked him just now, but he kicked me down like shit.
SPEAKER_09: Yeah, he won, but he started one year before to do armwrestling. Oh, Manuel was very, very, very young. Yeah. Oh, okay. When you were in Poland, Manuel started right after you. You were in Poland. He remembers. Yeah, but he doesn't remember because I was crazy.
SPEAKER_09: He said he doesn't remember because he was too weak and not famous. Italy, Bortolato!
SPEAKER_09: This situation happened the same to me in Brazil. I saw the people, they see the screen, they see when they are with the Italian, they laughed like crazy. Oh, you are lucky, you will win easy, blah, blah, blah.
SPEAKER_09: Because Italians in World of Wrestling are not very strong, like Russia. I remember, yes, I felt super angry inside. I crashed this guy like nothing, because we are gladiators. You can't go against us owners.
SPEAKER_02: Yes, because it was rare to see Italians doing something. Exactly. Who was the most famous Italian before you, Hermes? Emanuele Bruni? There were three. Emanuele Bruni, yeah. Wagner, do you remember the time that you beat Emanuele? Or not? Do you remember when you beat Emanuele? I don't remember. He had long hair.
SPEAKER_09: He doesn't remember. And Hermes, can you ask Manuel if it is finally time for revenge? Yes, because now his weight is 50 kg more.
SPEAKER_09: His weight is more than 40 kilos more than last time. The mind is the same. Listen, was it not 110 kilo category? Was it all super weight?
SPEAKER_02: No, always plus. Plus? Oh, okay. Always plus. Okay. Do you remember, Wagner, your weight when you competed in 2013 in Poland? Do you remember your weight? 125. 125. So Wagner is also at least 25, 30 kilos heavier than before.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah. How we can grow like this? I can't. Me, I can't. Why? I don't understand. Bread, pizza, spaghetti.
SPEAKER_02: Me. Can you ask Wagner if he likes Italian food in Rio? He loves, really. I have never cooked so much in my life. You what? I cook here. So I have never cooked so much in my life, really. Because he eats a lot. Yeah, but you say he likes Italian food, right? He likes Italian food.
SPEAKER_09: Who don't like, my friend? What is this question? Everybody like. If nobody, someone don't like Italian food, it's something crazy. Something is wrong. Impossible don't like Italian food. Okay, Hermes, are you or Italian food more likeable?
SPEAKER_09: What? You are more likable or Italian food is more likable? Me, of course. Too much. No comparison. What's he saying? He like... Cheese of God. Cheese of God.
SPEAKER_06: Thank you very much.
SPEAKER_09: what does he say translate you are translated you are not yeah but he's saying something don't sense oh it's okay let us decide maybe you are not maybe you are not smart enough to understand and i will understand he said he he's the owner of buntaka prina his factory his farmer
SPEAKER_09: Parma, Parma. Parma of Bontaca Prina is the name. Bontaca Prina. He is doing cheese and milk and yogurt. All calcium and protein and everything. Power, huh? Italian power.
SPEAKER_09: Training. Training for the fingers. He started at 4 a.m. to work. And he finished at 8 p.m. How long will he get rest before the competition?
SPEAKER_02: When he will go to Chicago. Okay, he wants to do his job and go to the airport. And which day is he leaving? Wednesday or Tuesday he leaves Italy? Wednesday. Oh, Wednesday. Do you guys go together? No, me Tuesday. Oh, you're Tuesday. Okay.
SPEAKER_09: I will see before the illustration. I don't know the words. Too much difficult words. I know English, but not too much. Not this vocabulary.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, then instead of $1,000, I will give you only $500 for translation. I'm not satisfied with your translation. Okay, my friend. Wagner, when was your last time your right arm match? You pulled your last match against Tobias. At mask. Tobias, no, left arm. Left or right? Left. Left was Tobias.
SPEAKER_04: So it is about one year, right? One year he didn't have a match. Yeah, almost one year and a half. It was in February of last year. Yes. He had a problem with his arm.
SPEAKER_04: yeah he got injured the ligament yes ligamento okay are you guys gonna have a conversation any translation yeah yeah it's okay a little bit okay some words in portuguese is similar to italian so a little bit we can understand okay
SPEAKER_02: Okay, okay. Anyways, so one year, and after one year, you're just pulling one net, like, do you feel ready physically and mentally, psychologically? You know, how do you feel?
SPEAKER_04: Are you feeling well mentally, psychologically, physically? He's very complete. Physically, psychologically, he's very complete. Yes, and this year he has been working a lot. The three aspects, the mental, the physical, especially physical. He has been doing physiotherapy, treatment with doctors. One year of treatment.
SPEAKER_02: So he has been working also the psychological part as well. Now he's feeling ready. Now he's okay. And like he is ready for Manuel as his first match. He is happy to have such opponent. Manuel is also WAF World Champion and Wagner is multiple times WAF World Champion. And how does he see his own chance against Manuel? But just tell him to be not to be humble. Tell us however he feels.
SPEAKER_04: Ok. How are you feeling facing Manuel? Because he is also a WOS champion, you are also a world champion, but he is also a high level opponent. How are you feeling facing him? I've already watched some of his games, I think he's very good rolling over, right? And it's going to be a great fight, and depending on the result, he will always have my respect. And I believe it's going to be a great fight.
SPEAKER_04: he has been observing his videos and the fights and he observed that he's a very strong guy he saw the top role and some techniques used by him and he believes that it's gonna be a an amazing fight and anyway about the result he will have always his respect because he saw that he's a guy a great guy
SPEAKER_09: I want to ask you, you know, you are a shoulder presser.
SPEAKER_11: And you say that it is going to be a great match. Like, do you think that you will be able to apply your power and it will be a great match? Or you think he will take your wrist and you think that it will be a great match that way? Like, do you think it will be a great match if you get your own position?
SPEAKER_04: Do you think it will be a great fight if you manage to make your game or if you will have to use other strategies to be able to push his hand to change the game in some way? How do you think this is going to happen? I think, regardless of anything, I will have to use other strategies too. But it all depends on the moment I take his hand.
SPEAKER_04: And he said that he's training more strategies than just the ones he used before. So he will decide what will be the best thing to do in the moment that he grabbed his hand in the moment of the fight. Because until now, he has been using these techniques, but he has been developing more techniques to improve more techniques, not just the ones he used to use.
SPEAKER_02: After his injury, does he have problem to apply his own technique? Because I don't remember with left arm he is doing anything else than the shoulder press. Ermes, do you remember him doing with left arm any other successful technique than the shoulder press?
SPEAKER_04: Okay, yeah. It's not because of the injury. He wants to learn more techniques to apply really, you know, to change a little the style, to learn how to handle and improve on the table.
SPEAKER_04: And okay, that's interesting. It's surprising to hear. The press continues being a favorite, but he has more strategies now. He has been developing strategies. He said he has a lot of new strategies to be his favorite technique. Yes, I also trained at the points where maybe I suck the most. Now I feel much better.
SPEAKER_09: He said he is training more in his weak point. Now he's super strong. Okay, what was Manuel's weak point? The press is the most dangerous.
SPEAKER_09: position for him. But he already studied this technique, how to beat this technique. Does Manuel think that he can take Wagner's wrist and Wagner will continue that way? How does he expect the match to go?
SPEAKER_09: He will never open his wrist. His wrist is like metal. No, no, I'm not saying Wagner is going to take Manuel's wrist. I'm saying that does Manuel expect that he's going to take Wagner's wrist? What's that?
SPEAKER_09: I think so. He said he will fight with an open hand. 100%. 100%.
SPEAKER_02: Wow, that's interesting to hear. But I never saw Wagner pull with an open hand. I think I saw him with Devon, like this, one round. Ah, yes. With Devon, yes. With Devon, he did. In the beginning, too. What's that? What is the name of this movement with the open hand?
SPEAKER_02: This is dead wrist pressure or some people call it flop wrist. It is just like dead wrist press. Dead wrist pressure. Yeah, press. There is a super chat. Christian Campanella. Hi, Hermes, Manuel, and Wagner. Greetings from Milan. Ciao, Christian. Stay strong. Ciao, ciao.
SPEAKER_02: Okay. Okay, Wagner. Manuel says it is 100% your wrist is going to go this way. What do you think? Then he will bury him on the cushion.
SPEAKER_09: He never show animal, insect, 150 kilo insect. Okay, who's the insect here? Bortolato, he said he will crash like an insect. Okay, okay, okay. Wagner, you said you're going to crash him like this, bury him like this?
SPEAKER_09: and manuel is saying that he is not a bug you know that you can crash like this but it will be like this oh it will be like that oh
SPEAKER_09: He will never, he's dreaming, he said, Manuel. He's dreaming, only dreaming, in Bortolorato. He's just dreaming, I said. Dream, dream, dream. What is his nickname?
SPEAKER_09: What's your nickname? Rocha, Rock. Friend of Cholesterol. Friend of Cholesterol. You know, Manuel in Italy is more famous for this than arm wrestling.
SPEAKER_09: Oh, about cholesterol? Why? Because he started one year ago to do a video with bread, salami in English. It's like a sausage. The salami is like a sausage.
SPEAKER_09: sausage, and he eating one sausage a day. But how big is it? How big is it, Emanuele? Quanto grande, più o meno? Fagli vedere. Very big. And the people who write in the coma, you will die with cholesterol, blah, blah, blah.
SPEAKER_09: and he started every video hello friends of cholesterol now the people recognize him about the friends of cholesterol because cholesterol okay okay no no really oh my god
SPEAKER_02: 35. 35. 35. 45. 45? 45? 45 years old, Wagner. Okay. First time I saw Wagner was 2006 WAF.
SPEAKER_02: Did he compete in any WAF before 2006? I remember him in Manchester. Did he compete? I think he beat Pushkar and some others. I was like, wow, who is this guy? And he was just going like this. So, can you ask him what was the first time he competed in a WAF? The first time you competed in a WAF was in 2006 against Pushkar in Manchester.

SPEAKER_04: Unbeatable about the left hand was the unbeatable in the day. Brazil versus Lativia. The final. Puskar was still like young Puskar. I mean, still very young, you know?
SPEAKER_02: I think the first time I saw Pushkar was in 2003. He was a junior, I think. And then in 2019, so he was like 21 years old. I think Pushkar was at that time 21 years old, yeah. But still was strong. Wagner was 26, Pushkar was 21. Yeah, something like this. Yes.
SPEAKER_02: When they competed, Wagner was 26 at that time. 26, okay. Yeah, 19 years old. Yeah, 2006. That was also the first time I saw Krasimir Kostladinov. Krasimir was 18 years old after Hermes. He was just showing double biceps. I was like, who is this guy? And then he became a legend. He was 18 years. That was the first time I saw Wagner and Krasimir.
SPEAKER_02: Me and you, when did we meet the first time? You and I? Listen, I mean, we didn't really meet in person, I think, until you came to Istanbul 2021. But I was following you already. And like those 2013, 14, you know, like, like, like,
SPEAKER_02: All the junior competitions, either Georgia or Kazakhstan or Russia or Bulgaria, Turkey. And then one Italian. Just one Italian. And then Niazdi was showing me, Engin, follow this Italian guy. Follow this Italian guy. And then 2015, I think you took second, but your opponent tested positive. And then you won the WoW in the senior. And then you beat Babaev in 2016.
SPEAKER_02: Yes. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I mean, I maybe you don't remember. Do you remember the post that I made like, in 2020? I said, follow these guys. And maybe before 20? Yeah, maybe 19.

SPEAKER_06: He asked what would happen between Hermes and Levan. A guy is asking what would happen between Hermes and Levan.
SPEAKER_03: Look, I really hope for Hermes. I hope he wins this challenge. But it will be difficult because Levan will come prepared. I know Hermes prepared a lot, but Levan will come more prepared to try to massacre Hermes. But I hope for Hermes. Hermes, Wagner is cheering for you. But he thinks Levan is coming over prepared because I think he knows that you are going to give a lot of job
SPEAKER_04: A lot of work for him. And I think you should be really overprepared as well, but Wagner is cheering for you. Until now, you were the guy that really gave a hard work for Levan. So it was really emotional watching you guys and he's cheering for you. It's the moment.
SPEAKER_07: It's the moment. It's the moment. It's the moment. Thank you, my friend. Thank you. Yeah. It's our moment. What's happening? Just translate.
SPEAKER_09: He said Momento and he said he will do for me a translator. He understands a little bit because he's a semi of Italian, the words, more or less. Okay. Trip says Wagner is a golden hearted beast. Love from Turkey.
SPEAKER_02: and okay so what we understand wagner you and money are pulling and he is taking your wrist and you are burying him to the pimped and he disagreed but do you agree with him that he will take your wrist
SPEAKER_04: I don't think so. He thinks he's not going to open his wrist or hand. He's confident that he's not, that's not going to happen. Okay. Okay. Then I have that. Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Yes, yes, I see. Surprise. Surprise. Surprise is coming, Wagner. You be careful. But Wagner, let me ask you another question. You said it will be a very good match. Very good match. And we know that Manuel is a top roller. And you are saying that you will not lose your wrist. You will take him inside. So how is it going to be a very good match if you are taking him here?
SPEAKER_04: He thinks it can escape. It can be a case of escaping. Then, tie hands.
SPEAKER_09: Okay, strap. He said if you want, you can try to pull in top roll, if you are a real man.
SPEAKER_09: If you're a real man, you'll try to face him in the top row. If you're brave enough. If you're a brave man. Okay, one second, Hermes. You say that you're not brave enough to pull the top row. Hermes, Manuel is asking Wagner to pull the top row? Come on, listen. Manuel is asking Wagner to pull the top row?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah. If he's brave enough. No, no, listen, listen. What if Wagner asks Manuel, if you are brave enough, let's start in hook. He said, what happens if he asks you if you are brave enough to throw in like him? Yes, yes, it has changed. Now it's fine.
SPEAKER_02: He said, okay, no problem. No problem. Inside, outside, no, no, no. Look, look, Wagner is happy. Wagner is saying yes, yes. But I will tell you, Hermes, I will ask you another one. Manuel says, if you are brave, do top roll against me. It sounds from outside like Manuel says,
SPEAKER_02: is not confidence because it it sounds like manuel thinks that he is in very big danger if if wagner is doing what he's doing like inside he said that if you say that you are afraid because you are not confident with yourself it would seem as he said
SPEAKER_09: Why are you afraid? Because you're afraid of him talking to you if he locks you in or something like that? No, I'm not afraid. No scary, no scary. I've never been afraid. Money and scary he never had.
SPEAKER_09: No fear, also no money. No fear, yes. He has a big farm. Is it his farm, that farm? Yeah. And he says he doesn't have money, he has a huge farm. No, he's like in Italy, he's like...
SPEAKER_09: you know something there are some words like uh oh okay okay okay yeah yeah when you talk you tell like this but it's not true you know okay like an expression okay but usually we use those expressions whenever it is fit in the subject if he has money and saying this okay i still understand
SPEAKER_09: I'm in Italy like this. All the people cry, but it's never true. Okay, okay, okay. So Wagner, from this we understand that do not believe whatever Manuel says. I think this is what Hermes said. He said that he will put Bortolato like a sausage
SPEAKER_09: In his bread he will eat everything. He will eat him. He will what? He will put him on the bread and he will eat Bortolato. Oh, okay. So the next meal is the Bortolato sandwich.
SPEAKER_09: sandwich now you're going to cheer for him
SPEAKER_09: Wagner thought you were his friend, and now you are going to cheer for Manuel. Hey, Italia, my friend. I'm Italian, boy, I'm Italian. He said I shouldn't cheer for you. No, no, you should cheer for Lindor. He said because he's from Veneto too, I should cheer for him. No, you should cheer for me. Exactly, I already said that.
SPEAKER_09: ferrari ferrari to ferrari to ferrari quality my friends okay he is the ferrari
SPEAKER_02: Fiat. He is a Ferrari and a Bortolato Fiat. Oh, Fiat and Ferrari. Oh. Manuel is very confident. He considers himself Ferrari and Wagner is Fiat. And Manuel, what is Hermes? Lamborghini? Pagani, Pagani.
SPEAKER_07: Hermes and Pagani. Maserati, Maserati. No, Pagani. And Manuel, what's going to happen between Lewand and Hermes? What's going to happen between me and Lewand? Italy always surprises the world in important competitions.
SPEAKER_02: Italy, the Italians, they shock the world every time in very big competitions. Okay, so the Italians will go to Chicago and then it will be 2-0. Hermes winner and the Manuel winner? Yes. Italian winner. Okay. Hey, but listen, now you're going to pull against Wagner. What?

SPEAKER_09: Emanuele, listen, you say Italians are going to win, but Wagner is also Italian. He said that Italians win, but that Bortolato is Italian. But he's out, he's out. After five years, he's out, out. Yeah, actually, he's not Italian. He was born in Brazil, yeah. He's not Italian anymore. But the family comes from Italy, yeah.
SPEAKER_09: he will give it to some advantage to him he will go closer on the pets he will hold him a little bit after he will play a little bit with the borderline he will give him some advantage because he is also in the room a little bit italian right yes yes
SPEAKER_02: Thank you, thank you. Wagner, are you being provoked by Manuel's, you know, confidence? Are you getting a little shaken up there because of the confidence? No, not at all. I'm not afraid of what people say. I'm not afraid.
SPEAKER_09: Maybe he doesn't understand what will happen, he said. Oh, he will not even realize what happened. No. What do you want to hit him, you know? What will you do to him, Manuel? Engie, too much confidence can disturb the process. He said that if you are arrogant, too much confidence will not go well. Well, I have to believe, otherwise I don't even feel like going.
SPEAKER_09: He said that if we don't believe it to himself, he will stay to home. Okay. Yeah. But, but, but, but, but, but money, money. It doesn't say those kinds of things about Levan, but he doesn't stay at home. Come on.
SPEAKER_09: Like, Hermes is not as confident as you are, but he doesn't stay at home. He still goes to Chicago. Ah, he said that I'm not as confident, but I still go to Chicago against Leiva. No, no, even Hermes is confident. Me too, me too. Okay. Even Hermes believes you. Inside, inside. Inside Volcano, eh? Yeah, wait, wait. When I will be ready with my friend.
SPEAKER_02: Did you watch the mini-family documentary of Levan? Yeah, beautiful.
SPEAKER_09: Did you see that Levan and his father, internationally, they support Italy as a team, other than Georgia, of course. Yeah, they love football. Juventus. They love to match. One time, if we come in Italy, Juventus from Torino is very close to my city. I and Levan come, you and I.
SPEAKER_09: We go all together to Juventus much? Yeah. Okay. But Juventus now is not very strong. No, no, it's okay. And what's your favorite team? You say the Formula One is better. Formula One is better? The Formula One is better. It's more beautiful.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, okay. Joshua-Hennes. Hermes for number one translator, my friends. Number one everywhere. You are number one everywhere, everything. Before I read the second super chat that now I started reading, you remember when you visited me in 2021 in Istanbul?
SPEAKER_02: And do you remember we, in Arif Ertem's gym, we went there and we filmed something and then it was on your old YouTube channel. And do you think there is a possibility to find that video? That your channel was deleted and everything was gone?
SPEAKER_02: Is it possible? Maybe, maybe, maybe I need to see. Maybe, maybe yes. Okay, we talk later, we talk later. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No need to go details. Okay, Christian Campanella says, will Lamparelli pull again in East versus West? Anything is possible. Todd and Oleg Lovechild says, translate

SPEAKER_00: Yeah, bravo, yeah, yeah, yeah. The people love too much to hear your voice, then translate or think. Trip is asking, who is Wagner's favorite armwrestler?
SPEAKER_03: There are many names, Gasparini, Devon, Brzenk, Todd Hutchings, there are many on the list.
SPEAKER_02: He said that he is Battaglia's favourite armwrestler? No, no, no. What does he say? No, Battaglia is not the favourite. Manuel, after this match, do you think Wagner will become your fan?
SPEAKER_09: I took a double match and we went round two fine. He will remember his name very well after the match. Today, my favourite is Manuel Bataglia.
SPEAKER_02: What did he say? He said what? Today my favorite arm wrestler is Manuel Batalla. Today his favorite arm wrestler is Manuel Batalla? But only one minute ago he said no. So why did he change his mind? But now he changed his mind. Now he's the favorite. Okay, so now Manuel Batalla is here, John Burzing Devon and Hermes here. Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Just smash him in one week. Okay, let's make a deal here. The one who loses after the event, when they do the interview, the one who loses will say like the winner's name, you know, he is my favorite arm wrestler. Do you accept?
SPEAKER_09: Manuel, if you accept, whoever loses the match with the microphone will say, if you lose, you should say Bortolatto is my favorite armwrestler. Do you accept this challenge? Okay. Okay, no problem. Manuel says no problem. If you lose the match, he will say
SPEAKER_07: Manuel is my favorite armwrestler. If Manuel loses, he will go. I upset. Yes. What?
SPEAKER_09: He said the people already know about Bortolato. Bortolato is already famous. He's already famous. You too, Manuel. I like playing ping pong with Bortolato. Are you playing ping pong with Bortolato? Good question.
SPEAKER_02: even imagine how strong risk he has with the 155 kilo guy he's playing people do you think that you will be intimidated when wagner goes like you know like this

SPEAKER_02: Wallace, okay. So it looks like Manuel is really following Armwrestling. I understand, but only someone who follows can see those videos. There are many actors they have seen and they have no idea who the guy is. And I don't understand like how...
SPEAKER_02: I don't like football or other sports. Okay. And Wagner? Wallace. Wallace, okay. And then this one is the last one. Alan Ford versus Ryan Bellinger. I think that's how I asked him before. Do you know them?
SPEAKER_02: Is there anyone, Manuel? No, not these. Where is the picture? Ryan Bellinger. Ryan Bellinger. Oh, Ryan. Okay. And then Dino is asking a super chat. Hello, Hermes. You're looking small, he says. No, no, joking, joking. He says you look big. Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_09: Okay. Do you guys have any message to the fans, to each other? Do you have any message for him or for the fans? For him, do you have any message for him?
SPEAKER_09: Do you have any message for him? He will be sorry not to be in Italy anymore. No. What do I tell him? I don't know, something. The last message before the challenge. I'll wait for you in Chicago. He will wait for him in Chicago.
SPEAKER_09: Okay. And then? And then? Oh, I don't know. I don't know. You have to eat goat's milk in the meantime. Sometimes you eat milk or goat or cheese. It gives you strength, it gives you more energy.
SPEAKER_09: Yeah, he will be stronger. Because he's too weak, but maybe with the tears of God, he will feel something. But just tell him to leave some space in his stomach for Wagner Sandwich. I have to leave some space for Mr. Wagner.
SPEAKER_02: Yes, yes. He will make him choke. Oh, he will be choking with Wagner Sandivich. Okay, guys, who have been watching us, just don't buy Wagner Sandivich. You will be choked, you know, so don't buy it. Let the company die.
SPEAKER_03: And Wagner, do you have this Italian guy who is very confident? Any message? First of all, he wants to ask God to protect both of them so nobody gets injured.
SPEAKER_09: Because it's going to be a spectacular fight. God protects both of them. That's what I think, but there's no need to bother the gods.
SPEAKER_09: But next time is difficult. He is better not to ask the God for these things. Why? Why? Why? Why he doesn't ask next time to God these things?
SPEAKER_09: he said he don't you know he will arrange himself without god
SPEAKER_09: It's not necessary to put God in them. I need God, I put Him. No problem, I respect that. Another thing I want to ask, when you say that
SPEAKER_02: you know, God protects and things like that. So, suddenly I just remember the arm massing table in Chicago. Yeah, I will, I will pray also to protect the table. And the next thing I will do as soon as this podcast finish, I will write to Roberts,
SPEAKER_09: you know, on WhatsApp to make sure to have some same extra table. He said that he will pray to protect the table because he always destroys it. So to be sure that in Chicago there was an additional table
SPEAKER_09: Wagner, my friend, will you be... What? What's this? He said if he will broke the table, he will pay the table.
SPEAKER_02: Is it possible not to break the table in Chicago?
SPEAKER_02: Absolutely, absolutely. It's possible he breaks the table. Oh, it's possible that he will break. Okay, so we better prepare something. Yeah, okay. It's better to have a stand-by table, yeah. Okay, does he remember that last time I asked him, he said he promised, and then at the East versus West stage, everything fell apart.
SPEAKER_02: Do you remember that you promised him that you wouldn't break the table? Sorry, my friend, sorry. Listen, nothing to be sorry about, but even if you would promise, I wouldn't 100% believe, so I better make sure to write Robert, make sure that there is some
SPEAKER_02: They love you, you have a golden heart.

SPEAKER_10: Really, I care too much for the people who support us to buy the pay-per-view because I saw a lot of piracy last time, from what I heard. If the people want this to continue and to support us to have this great event with all the athletes,
