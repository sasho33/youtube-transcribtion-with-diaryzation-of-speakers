SPEAKER_04: Hello, Georgi. Hello, Ivan. We are live now. Georgi speaks English now. Oh, he speaks English. Incredible. Incredible.
SPEAKER_04: Okay, we are waiting for Michael. Let me check where he is at.
SPEAKER_01: oh michael is here okay hello michael how are you i'm well sir my apologies for being late no no you are not only one minute it's nothing i i thought that maybe i didn't send you the link or something then i realized that i did this yeah that's all good it's all good yeah so so another one michael back to back this is four matches no i mean like back-to-back four matches in
SPEAKER_01: in last what six months yeah no february may june so in five months there's been three matches so seven months yeah well i guess since november february may now so four months four okay if you say february it's four months because second amount to six months so in four months you're having having back to back yeah yeah wow yeah
SPEAKER_03: Yeah. Yes. It's a big challenge. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's a handful. So this will be my seventh match in 14 months with King the Table East versus West. Yeah. The first one was February. Our first one's April 20th. So here we are, June 21st, seven matches in 14 months. Yeah. And do you plan to rest after this one? So what do you mean by rest? How long? No, no, no. When I say like,
SPEAKER_03: Like, are you going to go with the same frequency? Well, I'm looking at every other event for now, unless something comes up. Like, you know, if I can be successful with Zuranov, I'm thinking probably the winner of Gurdjieff versus Morozov in September. And then if I can win that, maybe, you know, depends on...
SPEAKER_03: If Lavon beats Armez, maybe a rematch with Armez in December. I don't know. Just whatever you come up with. I'm just looking down the... I'm willing to pull anybody. People are talking about Svetkov. I'm sure he had surgery on his left arm, so I don't know when he'll be back right-handed. I'm willing to pull anybody. Now, there is the question, if I'm unsuccessful with Georgie, do I decide to go down to 115? Who knows?
SPEAKER_01: right now there is no okay so you are saying that you want this match and then you say supers if you lose this match then probably 115. it just depends it just depends man um i'm actually so i'm really happy where i'm at
SPEAKER_03: This turnaround was so short. It was six weeks. So it's only been five weeks since my last match, right? Mm-hmm. But I did the heaviest back circuit I've ever done, the heaviest pumping chest circuit. And then yesterday I broke all my PRs on all my lifts. Wow.
SPEAKER_03: I beat my riser curl by five pounds from Vitaly. I beat my wrist cupping by two and a half pounds for 50 reps, but I actually was able to complete all 50 where I couldn't before. Beat my outside side pressure by eight pounds for five reps. Beat my pronation gauge back pressure by five pounds.
SPEAKER_03: static hold, the static hold move. I mean that about 15 pounds. So like I'm actually, and I'm 10 pounds lighter. So this morning I was 131, stripped 131. So, and I was, I was 10 pounds heavier. So that's, you know, four and a half kilos heavier.
SPEAKER_01: going into Vitality than I am currently right now, but yet I'm stronger on everything, so. Yeah, yeah, I mean, it doesn't always, the weight doesn't always equal to, yeah, power, yeah. Yeah, so we'll see, man. But it's very surprising, Michael. It's very surprising that, like, you have been, like, pushing the gas pedal nonstop and still going up. You know, that's very, that's very surprising. Well, this is what I, it is surprising, but I think a lot of it is, you know, 35 years of arm wrestling, but this arm is only two years old.
SPEAKER_01: You know, this arm is new, you know, so I'm getting newbie gains. So I'm getting stronger because this arm is new. You know what I mean? It's been rebuilt. Can you say that it is new just because you had a surgery? I mean... Oh, dude, I had this much bone taken out. Like, I haven't... Oh, yeah, I understand, but just... So when you say arm, you have your wrist, hand, like all this. The bone part is mostly about the elbow, probably. Well, the thing about it, I had nerve damage.
SPEAKER_03: I had all that nerve damage. Well, they scraped away the ulnar nerve. So now I can feel my fingers again. This atrophy has gone away. Yeah. All the things that were bothering me are now like, maybe the stem cells really helped that much. I don't know. No, no, I'm sure it helped. But what I'm just saying is just because you fixed the problem, it doesn't mean that it's a new bone. You have been pulling with that arm. But this range of motion, this thing here is all new. This is 15 years. I haven't been able to do it.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah. So it's just, I don't know, man, I feel good. We'll see. I have great respect for Georgie. Like he's super, super strong, scary dude. When I saw him beat Rivas a year ago,
SPEAKER_03: I was like, oh my God, that guy is strong, right? So, you know, obviously his match with Vitaly, a lot of people will look at that and look at my match and draw conclusions. I don't think it has anything to do with it. So I'm expecting a dogfight, like I'm expecting a war. Yes, yes, it will be a war. I don't see anyone dominating another one. Did you guys see the new promo video that Soul Aron made?
SPEAKER_01: I have not. You have not? Just please go watch it. Where's it at? It's on the East versus West social media. Levan and Hermes. Okay, yeah, I haven't seen it yet. It's a beautiful one, yeah. Okay, cool. Yeah, yeah. So we still waiting on Georgie? Is he not here yet? He's right here. Oh, hey, hey. How you doing? I couldn't see. I could only see Ingen. I didn't know. What's up, Ivan?
SPEAKER_01: Michael says Ivan. His name is pronounced Ivan. Yes, I didn't... That's why you didn't know. My bad. No, it's okay. I mean, we pronounce the names also wrong as well because they are not here. Where is Georgi? Is he here? Yeah, Georgi is here. I don't know why you guys don't see him.
SPEAKER_04: You guys want to see me? He looks scary. No, no, let's see him. Georgi, Michael said that you look scared. No, scary, scary. I know, I know. Don't get this dude mad at me. What the hell wrong with you? Michael said that you look terrible. And Engin said that you're afraid. It's just a game of words.
SPEAKER_01: My cousin said he looked scared, like scary. And then I translated it as like he's scared, you know, not translated, but just changed the word, just on a joking way. What did he say?
SPEAKER_00: Well, how can I say? First of all, I respect Michael. And I can't say, like, I'll destroy you, I'll beat you up, tear you up, and so on. I don't want to say such loud words. I respect him, even if I don't like his fight, no matter what, but as a person, I respect him. He's very good and very spiritual, so to speak.
SPEAKER_04: Georgie says that he likes Michael, he respects him. He doesn't like his style, but he likes his spirit. And that's it. Yeah, yeah. He's not afraid of him. He says he's not afraid of Michael.
SPEAKER_00: But he also thinks it will be a dogfight, like Michael said. It will be difficult for both of you.
SPEAKER_00: And at the same time he feels relaxed because he agreed to pull on short notice and
SPEAKER_01: I think he doesn't feel too much responsibility for that. Oh, come on. What kind of excuse is that? That Michael just pulled only a month ago. No, no, no excuses. He's just recovering, while Di Zerano is just like, pressed like a daisy, you know? Yeah. Tell him not to come with such excuses.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah. Yeah, no excuse. There is only one way out for these athletes. They need to win. Giorgi Di Zerano lost two matches, losses.
SPEAKER_01: the same way and this time one of the atlas will just survive you know of course both atlas will i mean still get matches but there is only like if you want to have a shot to this direction you need to continue winning that that is not like what i say but that is the nature of the uh
SPEAKER_04: And if there is a desire to go up, then you have to win. That is, it does not mean that there will be no more fights or anything. It's just that if there is ambition, then you have to fight. Win. Only one way. Victory. In fact, yes. I think Michael understands it, I understand it.
SPEAKER_01: But in any case, the winner is the winner. George agrees. He thinks that they will do their best to win. But at the same time, only one person will win. Yeah, for sure. Can you also ask him, does he believe that he has the tools to beat Michael? Because, like, Michael, as we said, you know, like...
SPEAKER_01: If you say who is the one of the most explosive flash pinner in the world, that's Vitaly Laletin for sure, if not the best one. And Vitaly couldn't do it. So it just, it seems like that is going to be a mess. It will stop. And then after that point, does Zorano have, does he believe that he has tools to finish Michael?
SPEAKER_04: I have a question for Angin. Do you think you have a weapon against Michael? And he gave the example of Vitaly Valitin, who has a very powerful start and who usually won everyone in touch. And even he could not win his fight, he had to rebuild. In this regard, I have a question. Do you think you have a weapon against Michael? Oh, it's hard to say. In fact, against Michael,
SPEAKER_00: you can't pick up a lot of keys like that, roughly speaking, it's natural, everyone understands that there should be a flop press, a triceps against it, just like that, but I can either use it or not, I haven't trained it so much, but now when I started training, I
SPEAKER_00: My elbow hurt a little during this short time, but I started to navigate, I wanted to quickly pick up that key. So it's hard to say. I don't know, maybe endurance, but again, Michael's endurance is not worse, maybe even better than mine, so I don't even know. We'll probably come up with something soon. Is it difficult to say?
SPEAKER_04: He knows that flow press is the key, but he never was very good at it. And he's not sure that he will be able to do it. But he started to train it, and at the same time, unfortunately, it hurt his elbow, this kind of training.
SPEAKER_01: So it's difficult for him to see and he'll think about it during the fight. Okay, one more quick question before I go, Michael. Does he think that there is no other way to beat Michael? That's the first question. The second question, did Vitaly beat Giorgi because he is much stronger or because of his start? Do you think that, does he think that if the match started and referee is still holding, if they started five seconds
SPEAKER_04: You know, but referee is still holding, no one can go. And then the match should start. Do you think that there would be a chance to beat Vitaly if the match didn't start, like if Vitaly wasn't that explosive? Engin had two questions, but I think the second one is more interesting. About the match with Vitaly. What do you think, did you lose because Vitaly was fast from the start, he took the position, or... And, accordingly, Engin asks, if your match
SPEAKER_04: let's say, five seconds, the judge would have held the grip. I mean, if you were to sort things out slowly, how do you think, would it have changed, or would Vitaly still be on the same level? And the second question was, do you think there are other ways to beat Michael than a flop press? Well, it's hard to say about Vitaly. At that moment,
SPEAKER_00: I was a little worried about Brachialis and I couldn't make a good stretch. I think that maybe Vitaly would have won, but there would not have been such a clear domination. That is, we would have pulled a little bit there, let's say. Maybe I could have held it without a brush or something else. And if there is another weapon against Michael, oh...
SPEAKER_00: So about Vitaly, he said that he had problems with brachial muscle, with rising, with back pressure.
SPEAKER_04: And if not that injury, maybe he would last longer. Maybe he would stop him somewhere a little, but still he thinks that Vitaly was stronger anyway. Even without this injury, yes. No, injury is different. My question was if the match started slowly. If they said, ready, go, and they hold their hands and they start pulling,
SPEAKER_04: Yes, I asked Georgi, but maybe he didn't understand me. Yes, I asked Georgi, but maybe he didn't understand me. Yes, I asked Georgi, but maybe he didn't understand me. Yes, I asked Georgi, but maybe he didn't understand me.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know, even if I twist him, he twists very well, even from this position. But the only thing is that Vitaly is also durable, despite the fact that... Well, I think our endurance is about the same now, but... I don't know, but it seems to me that Vitaly was a little stronger at that moment. Maybe one round would have been more successful.
SPEAKER_04: Without a wrist or something like that. So, Georgi said once again that maybe he would stop him without wrist. Without wrist for some time. But anyway, Vitaly was stronger that day. And very short answer I want. Is he now healthy or still have that injury?
SPEAKER_00: Yes, I feel pretty good about myself. That is, I can at least do some kind of stretch for myself. It's just that brachialis does not allow you to do a good stretch. There are, of course, some moments. I think we all have them. But for them to directly influence the fight now, well,
SPEAKER_00: I can't say that it's something critical. I'm saying that my elbow is a little sore because I started to put pressure on my triceps. In the block, for example. But in two weeks I stopped doing big loads and let my hand rest a little. So far, without loads, I feel good. How it will be later, I don't know.
SPEAKER_01: No, he had some pain when he trained flop press, but now it seems to be okay. And he has no problem with the... Brachialis? Brachialis, yes. No problem now. So he is healthy now. Michael, like soon you're going to make everyone flop press master. Everyone who is pulling against you, they are training something that they have never trained before. Right. Damn it.
SPEAKER_03: I have a question. Was he saying that he thinks that's the only way to beat me is flop press? Because I didn't get the answer on that one. I think that is what he thinks. That is what we are.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, that's pretty high praise. I mean, especially for Vitaly to say that you can't beat me without a flop because Vitaly's top row is so amazing. I mean, I know I lost that match, but I was still very pleased with round one and my abilities. My friend, we were all shocked. I don't know how that match didn't go here, you know, right away. And it just shows that, you know, and we know that you met Vitaly, which is much stronger than Vitaly that met Levan in 2019. So just imagine.
SPEAKER_01: So my honest opinion is that arm wrestling today at crazy level, crazy level, you know, and, and as you said that you, you are breaking your personal records, you know, and it just shows it like we haven't reached to our full capacity. Nobody yet. Yeah. It's crazy how, how a level can keep making everyone else rise. Cause everybody wants to get, you know,
SPEAKER_01: get stronger in the level so high you just keep you just keep pushing so Yvonne um how strong do you think Vitaly is sorry this is off topic I'm just because I know you Michael we are not here to talk about this or that just yeah let's talk how strong Vitaly is yeah according to himself he is just
SPEAKER_01: I think he said some number, percentage number, but much stronger than... He said he was 123 kilos when he pulled against Levan in 2019. So right now he's about 150 kilos. It's not only about the weight. He didn't gain the weight. He's gaining slowly. Well, watching his seated curls are strong and his side pressure movement is strong. So, Levan, when you pull him, can you beat him in a hook?
SPEAKER_01: Because I saw y'all playing around, so I just don't know how accurate some of those videos are. I think not now. Think about that. If LeBron said he can't beat him in a hook, I'll throw him. No, he cannot. He cannot. Just remember one thing. In 2016, Krasimir, in 2016, Krasimir hook level, Krasimir was 102 kilos. And he competed in the European Championship super heavyweight, and he hooked.
SPEAKER_01: Levon. It was a tough match and he won. Yeah, Levon came out the back trying to get away. But what I'm just saying that if you guys remember, I think it was 2021 or 2022. I don't remember exactly. Krasimir and Vitaly had a super match and even then he hooked him and then he beat him. And now Vitaly is
SPEAKER_01: in like much higher shape so the guy is just yeah he is incredible i don't know how he will do against uh devon we will see because i don't think that um devon will be in a shape that we have seen him before i think he will also be in a crazy the reason that michael that you guys are just getting into crazy levels is because like every one and a half months you guys are meeting each other
SPEAKER_01: And then that competition level is just making you guys... I believe in one thing. If there is no competition, tough competition, there is no improvement. Impossible without tough competition. That's why those guys in WAF are very tough. Because every year Europeans and the Wolves and then their Nationals. And then every year they meet and they make each other crazy strong. So now with the East versus West, there's this...
SPEAKER_01: regular meeting and you guys are coming into crazy level crazy level and and okay michael so do you think do you think that um like or i should say why why do you think that like you are stopping all these guys you know at the center
SPEAKER_03: very effectively? Like what has changed? Is it your right? I'm going to tell you what I think it is. And the people that watch me think it's crazy. It's pronation engaged back pressure. It's this move right there that I do under that pulley. You know, it opens me up and stretches me out, but it's so much attacking here. And when I pull it back with my lat, you know, it's that dragging back pressure that's stopping it. Look at round one with Gennady. Look at round one with Vitaly.
SPEAKER_03: there's a little bit of hit and then I come right back to center. And that's exactly the movement I do with that thing. Now, would it be better if I could be tighter? Yes, there's a lot of things I still need to work on, but that's why I'm stopping the matches in my opinion. My pronation, obviously my pronation lift opens up, it's more stretched, but my strength through here,
SPEAKER_03: It's so high. You also used your left, as you said, yeah. Yeah, I mean, it's just when you go sideways, you're literally running into this, you know, and it's going to stop. When was the last time you lost without flop, but just by the, like, Gennady match, you lost that way, first one. Oh, 2022, yeah. And then Devon match, Devon match. So Devon match was before that, then Gennady.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I mean, it's a... Do you think that there is, like, do you think that there is anybody can beat you without the flop right now? So I heard, I haven't watched the video, but I heard Levon say he thinks he can flash me.
SPEAKER_03: And I don't think he can. Honestly, God, I don't think LeVon can flash me. I don't think he can stop me from slipping. I think once we get in the strap, I think I can hit hard enough backwards when he goes. I don't think he can flash me. So I don't think I can be flashed inside the strap unless I make an error. If I hit my move pronation gauge backwards. I'm not talking about flash me. I'm talking about is there any way still like in the past to
SPEAKER_01: you know, and then totally take, take, take your risks. And then like, it would be, it would take, it would take a really, really, really, really, really, really strong version of Devin. Someone who has that crazy height and ability to understand and climb, climb, climb, climb. Cause arm is arm. Is there any chance that you and him meet and then end up like your WL match with him?
SPEAKER_01: yes yes so how do you how do you see the possibilities to the match to go dubai way and what's the possibility it to go one way you think 50 50 or how do you see i think 70 30 it goes more wal style
SPEAKER_03: Oh, so you'll like your chances if you meet him again? I think we're 50-50. I think the match is 50-50. But I don't think it's going to be Devon's going to dominate my hand and wrist. He's going to have to figure a different way out, in my opinion. I just think my riser's getting much better.
SPEAKER_03: I don't know. I just I think I'm improving and I think having this extra range of motion. I guess this isn't strong yet, but for 15 years it wouldn't come past here and now it comes to here. You know, I mean this is a big difference that still has a lot of room to improve. You know, so I don't know. I'm excited. Rebecca was not talking yesterday and we're talking about a potential 115. You know, just a potential because I like being fit, not like I said, I feel relatively fit right now at 131.
SPEAKER_03: Michael Williams- But um I like being fit it's summer, we have to pull it just makes me want to be leaner and fitter. Michael Williams- If I could keep progressing in my strengths. Michael Williams- I think i'd be a really bad problem for the 115 division. Michael Williams- Because that's what we need, because. Michael Williams- I think things are coming together really good.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, and 131 is not super above 115. No, I mean, I could safely be there in 12 weeks if I wanted. Like, if we had this match, if I had another match in 12 weeks, I could be there, be fit, and probably not sacrifice any strength, you know what I mean? But I'm not done with this, man. I still think I got a shot. I really want to pull LeVon so bad. I just think that there's a chance that, you know,
SPEAKER_03: I can keep getting stronger. And I think there's like, let's just say, and I'm definitely not looking past your year at all. He's amazing. And I'm, I'm expecting the hell of a fight. I'm just saying in the future,
SPEAKER_03: if I ever got the call and said, okay, you're pulling LeBron in six months, those six months of my life would be the most insane, intense, crazy sacrifice, everything to be the strongest I could possibly be to find out what's possible. You know, maybe I don't, you know, who knows? We'll see. But once you deserve that, you will have it. And then you will deserve that shot. It means that you will have chance.
SPEAKER_01: We don't know how much. But you know what I mean when you say that he deserves it. Once you deserve it, you have to beat some guys. If you are beating those guys, it means that you deserve it. And if you are beating those guys, it means that you are somewhere in a serious level. Right, right. Two questions real quick for Georgi. What is his weight? And I don't know how old is he. I don't know how old he is. How old are you, Georgi, and how old are you?
SPEAKER_03: He's 133. I'm 131. How old is he? 37. 37? Okay, so okay. I'm only 15 years older than him, so that's not bad. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: and so he was two when i started arm wrestling yeah and george what do you think your chances you said that you don't feel pressure but what do you think your chance to win in chicago um
SPEAKER_01: Maybe without the camera. I think he may have accidentally touched the screen. Georgi. Okay, probably he will come back, he will come back. And Ivan. I think I have a pretty good chance.
SPEAKER_04: He thinks that Michael is the favorite, but still he has about 40-45%, but he'll draw the maximum out of this 45%. So he doesn't think he has bad chances.
SPEAKER_01: okay so he believes that he has he has very good chance but not better than michael's chance i understand yeah yeah and and michael how about you
SPEAKER_03: I was going to say 51-49, but I like that 55-45. That sounds better. I think I'm the favorite. But you can never tell. You can never tell at this level. Everyone's so strong. I mean, that's what's so funny. Someone was dogging me the other day about, oh, well, you lost to Hermes. Oh, you lost to Vitaly. I'm like, yes, exactly.
SPEAKER_03: who you just mentioned look how strong they are like we don't even know arm is might beat levon we don't know like levon i mean i don't think he's going to but i think he's got a chance i mean this version of arm is really strong you know what i mean and batali
SPEAKER_03: that had to be the strongest fatality that anyone's ever faced. And I was pretty competitive. So, I mean, it's not like, yeah, I mean, it's funny. People want to give you shit about losing. I'm like, but I'm competing against the very best people in the world. You know what I mean? Um, and I'm still only two years back after an injury. So I feel like I'm, I feel like I'm in a good spot. Now, the thing about your, he is, um,
SPEAKER_03: yes I believe I'm probably the favorite to everyone but I'm not looking past this dude at all because like I said he's scary so I mean he's a big frame big boned
SPEAKER_03: And he's got a lot of heart. And you see him lose round one and round two in some of his East vs. West earlier matches and come back and just crush the people the three in a row. And I'm like, well, shit, he knows he's got endurance. So, yeah, I mean, I'm expecting a hard fight, you know? Yeah. Even if you win, Michael, you will not win easy. For sure. If you win, Michael, it will hardly be easy, Georgi. Well, yes.
SPEAKER_04: Ask him to turn his phone. What did he say? What did he say as an answer?
SPEAKER_04: Yes, he believes that he'll have to work hard to beat Michael. Can you ask him, Georgi, was he surprised when the ref said, go, and then the match stopped at the middle? Between Vitaly and Michael. Tell us, Georgi, were you surprised when in the match with Vitaly, after the goal, the capture was left in the centre?
SPEAKER_00: Yes, in fact, I was very surprised. I thought, I assumed that he would stay, but I thought he would stay near the pillow. And when Michael stopped him in the center, I just thought that Michael, probably, this movement, which in the middle worked well on him, and on his crown movement, which is near the pillow, it seemed to me that
SPEAKER_04: Yes, he was really surprised. He thought Michael would stop Vitaly, but not at the center, but where he usually stops, near the pad.
SPEAKER_04: And he thought and thinks that for that preparation, Michael really improved in his center position, but maybe lacked his defensive position near the pad.
SPEAKER_03: Damn it. I'm trying to make the other stuff strong. So I don't, you know, it's so hard to pick what you want to train and focus on because I need more strength here. And I just feel like, oh, well, this is going to be there. But I did not expect his hand to be so strong and for him to be able to come so far across the table. You know, I just thought, hey, round one, I swear, man, I felt his press. I'm like, I'm good. This is great. No problem. And then before you know it, I'm like, oh, shit, I'm in trouble, you know.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, so that sucked. Michael, I mentioned this in some of the earlier podcasts. When the match started in the U.R. Center, and I would take a picture of that moment and send to, just say, hundreds armwrestling experts who are now watching the match. I said, this is three seconds after round one. Go. Yeah, after the go round one. Who won this match?
SPEAKER_01: I tell you what, I don't think there is one single person would say that Vitaly won that one. It was unexpected. Both were unexpected. What you did was unexpected, what he did, but we should all know that whenever you come here, you climb up. Probably his grip felt so strong, right? Right. Yeah, I mean, I opened my hand, it just wouldn't go anywhere. I was like... Yeah, yeah, you were opening, but did you feel your riser was a little bit like he was just pronating with the grip? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Like I said, he fought extremely hard. He was very committed to what he needed to do to win. And I was very impressed with his arm wrestling IQ throughout that match. I mean, he did a great job. I would love to arm wrestle him again someday. I'm sure, you know, unless I go down to a lighter division, I feel like I'm going to pull Hermes again. I feel like I'll pull Vitaly again.
SPEAKER_01: I just, I want to arm wrestle as many people. Like, when would you want me to arm wrestle again? And you asked me when would I want to arm wrestle again? When would you want me to arm wrestle again? No, no, no. I mean, listen, we will, we will need all of you all the time. I'm just thinking that like, it was really tough period for you. I mean, it's a lot. It's been a lot. These are like very high level. I like,
SPEAKER_01: I don't know how many people can do that. That is what I mean. Like from November, because it was beginning of November, so November, December and then five, seven, seven and a half months. In seven and a half months, you are pulling your fourth very tough match, you know, very tough.
SPEAKER_03: Right? Yeah. It's all good. I'm excited. I'm up for the challenge. It's, you know, like you and I, we've been doing this a very long time. And to me, you know, I just turned 52 years old yesterday. Sometimes I feel 52 when I wake up in the morning and my back hurts or whatever, or my knees or my hips.
SPEAKER_03: But when it comes time to arm wrestling, I still feel like a kid. I just want to get out there and bang. So it's hard for me not to say, put me on the next card at King of the Table, then put me on the next one in September, then put me on the next one in Switzerland. You know what I'm saying? I want to do them all. But at the same time, I do want to keep progressing. So I have to be somewhat particular on when I compete so that I don't
SPEAKER_03: end up getting injured or plateauing. Right now, I feel like I can keep, as long as I can keep progressing in my preparations, I just want to keep climbing the ladder. I think if you would be more selective in later years,
SPEAKER_01: I think you can be competitive as long as, you know, like I'm talking about the age of tatashis. I think until the late 50s, I think you will be competitive. But maybe you can't be pulling every two months or something after a certain age, but you know, some, you know.
SPEAKER_03: But yeah, we're going to see, we're going to find out. Right. But I agree. Like right now it's a very simple looking future. Um, I don't know, you know, like I said, I don't know if I'm going to win the matches. I don't know what's going on, but you know, pulling next weekend. And then pulling again in three months and then pulling again in three months, those, those dates seem real realistic to me because those are all North American events. Doesn't seem like a whole lot of travel that I have to do. And I don't hold a lot of time, like boarding my dogs.
SPEAKER_03: A lot of people don't realize my dogs are my family. We have five dogs that sleep in bed with us every night. Oreo's 15 years old, and I just hate leaving her. So traveling to Europe right now, unless there was something that was a match that really excited me, I kind of like maybe doing this event and then the next two North American events and then getting back into the international travel.
SPEAKER_01: But like the November 1st event, you know, I don't know if you've announced where it's going to be. My friend, I can't guarantee anyone any events. I mean, trust me, like 30, 40 athletes are regular, like all the time pulling athletes. Yeah. Yeah. Every event they want. So that is why I just right now I have the board. I don't show you guys the next event from the August right there. I see all the matches.
SPEAKER_01: and you don't see it, but I'm... Yeah, so... Have you announced the location of the next event yet? We don't know yet. We don't know yet. Yeah, so it's still up in the air. I knew where y'all were planning, but I didn't know if y'all secured it yet or not. Yeah, soon to be finalized. Georgi, who is winning? Alex Kurdecha or Artem Morozov? Prava. Artem Morozov.
SPEAKER_00: It's not because he's from Kazakhstan, same as you, right? He will pull after Larratt and Devon would make him tired.
SPEAKER_00: Both physically and mentally. And that's why he will have problems also. What if Alex beats Devon quickly? Well, it will still be hard for him. Even if he wins, it won't be an easy win. Devon likes to beat his opponents.
SPEAKER_03: Still, it would be difficult. It won't be easy. Michael? Yeah, I mean, I'm of the same mindset, having to pull Devin first. And I understand why he's doing that, because of the importance of pulling Devin. That has to take a toll on you. And at this level, pulling left and right at the same event is almost crazy.
SPEAKER_03: And Morozov truly is probably one of the most intimidating looking athletes that we have on the roster. So I'm excited to see the match. But yeah, I think Morozov is going to, with everything that's in play, I think Morozov is the favorite. Okay. This one I'm going to only ask you, Michael. And before that, I want to ask Ivan. Ivan, how do you see that match? Which one? Morozov and Alex Kudashev.
SPEAKER_04: I think that Kurdes will try to top-roll Artyom. Artyom either hooks him, either stops him with a straight wrist. And after some time, in the neutral, at the center, I think Artyom is the favorite. I do not see Alex beating, flash-peering Artyom. And how do you see Michael and Georgi?
SPEAKER_04: I think it all depends on how well Georgi prepared for press. Oh, okay. So you also believe that only way, flop press? Not only. I think that a good top roll with very good side pressure is also possible. Good top roll with a good side pressure, then I remember Vitaly and I didn't see it's possible.
SPEAKER_04: I think something like Devin did. Controlling the center and getting little by little to the side. I know that Georgi was versatile at VARF years. He pulled differently. He could hit without his wrist as well, but it was not a pure floor press.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it was just more like sideways, yeah. We're talking about the match being stopped and then constant pressure, yeah. But we'll see how he did his homework. Ivan, what if Michael just says, OK, let me try 115? And is there any other way to beat him at 115? For sure, I will try to hook Michael.
SPEAKER_01: But I would also need to practice flop press, I think. Michael, if you also make Ivan Matushenko flop presser, wow, then you will be in the history with description with one more edition. He even made Ivan Matushenko flop presser. Actually, I do not see myself cooking Michael completely. Even at 115?
SPEAKER_04: Yes, I think I could manage maybe just a little with straight hand go to side, where Michael would stop me. And from that point, I'm not sure that my side pressure hit with that position would finish. How many fun matches you would have?
SPEAKER_03: There's so many matches in 115. Imagine you versus, just say, Rino Matic when he comes back. You versus Ibrahim Sago. See, Ibrahim, like, I feel as strong as he is here, I don't think he can hook me. I don't think he can turn me in. Ah, but he didn't know that he can also do this. Yeah, no, no, I got it, I got it. I just, I think...
SPEAKER_03: See, Ivan is someone who I've always, you know, we talked about that last year, right? Yeah. Because he is the best, in my opinion, at forcing a hook. And I think I'm probably the best at keeping you from hooking me. You know what I'm saying? So I think that's a very interesting match. But, you know, Reno, Ivan, a rematch Dave Chafee, Gennady at 115 if he stays at 115, Ibrahim Sagov, like...
SPEAKER_01: There's so many matches in that category. Do you think that Dave Sheffy, like if he didn't, like just say that Dave, Dave always walks at 275. Right. And for him to make 253, just if he's walking around 275 on 265, I don't see him losing a lot for the 10 pounds. And then if he would know how to lose the weight.
SPEAKER_01: In the last moment, getting back, you know, just say he went up to 270. I think he can be very close to his super heavyweight shape at 150. Very close. And his super heavyweight shape for 150 would be very dangerous. Well, he would probably be the longest lever in the division if you exclude Devin. If you take Devin out of the 115, who's got a bigger hand and bigger, longer forearm than Dave Chafee at 115? Just say that. Just say that.
SPEAKER_03: Like, what would his chance be at 115? Dave's? Yeah. Okay, so I don't know if Dave has his hook side pressure game back yet. If he gets that back, then his chances are as good as any one in the division, right? But if he's all top row? For example, can he top row those people at 115? Just like, for example, we had how many matches?
SPEAKER_01: We had like, just say Reno and Sago, they were head to head and Reno won. Right. And just say that, what would Dave's chance against this show when Reno comes back? Both of those guys, Dave has a great chance against, in my opinion. The one who I don't think he has as good a chance against is Yvonne, because I think Yvonne Montesango, because he would hook him. I think he'd hook him. And that's why you said that if he had that dragon hook. Yeah, if Dave Chafee has that back again, he's hard to beat.
SPEAKER_03: Hard to beat. You know what I mean? But I don't know if that's going to come back. I mean, you know, the neck injuries and all the stuff, I think that played a big role in how he had to change his style of arm wrestling, you know? I mean, he's perfect for top rolling because his hand's so big and his forearm's so long. But what made Dave Chafee Dave Chafee was that inside power and just ridiculous side pressure, you know? Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. So, I don't know, man. It's a very exciting division. Here's the deal. It's June 2025.
SPEAKER_01: If I have not pulled Levon by July 2026, I'm definitely going in the super heavyweight. I'm going down to the heavyweight division. But we don't know what might happen between now and then. You know, I might not have a good run. Maybe, maybe, maybe. Like, listen, just because you're pulling heavyweight, I mean, listen, you say you are 131 kilo. I want to tell you something, even if you make 115,
SPEAKER_01: probably next day you can make over 120, 125, you understand? So just because you go to heavyweight, it doesn't mean that
SPEAKER_03: you need another year to reach the super weight again. No, no, I get it. I get it. I mean, because right now, listen, my body fat is high enough right now that I could just drop body fat and probably be very close to just a quick little water cut. Like I can drop 15 pounds of body fat and then have a 10 pound water cut and I just made weight. You know what I mean? Like it's not that, well, I guess it's more than that because I'm, what am I, 288 and it's 253. So I guess I'm 35 pounds away. Okay, so it's more than I thought.
SPEAKER_01: But trust me, trust me, trust me. I mean, I know you could do it, yeah. And, Georgi, Devon versus Alex, left arm. It seems that Alex is stronger, but... I would like Alex to win. For me, he's somehow, I don't know...
SPEAKER_04: First, Georgi said that he thinks that Alex is stronger than Devon. And also he would like Alex to win because they're friendly, they're friends.
SPEAKER_04: But still he thinks that 55-45 in Devon's favour. He thinks that Alex could win first one or two rounds and that is all. The other day I had Alex and Morozov as my guests.
SPEAKER_01: also had a video chat with Alex. Do you guys know the terms burning the ships? Burning ships? Yeah. But burning the ships means that like this is about historical thing, you know, they just went to conquer, you know, land. And then when they come with the ships,
SPEAKER_01: And then when they saw a huge army, they were intimidated and soldiers wanted to go back with the ships, you know. And then the commander just burned all the ships. There's no coming back. So Alex right now, it looks like he burned all the ships. No going back after losing. And I think Alex, we will see the strongest Alex. I don't know who's going to win, but the shape that Alex is in now, we haven't seen before.
SPEAKER_04: Ivan, what is your prediction about this match? I do not know Devon's shape at all. A year ago he was not very impressive with his left. If he is about the same as he was a year or more, I would bet on Alex.
SPEAKER_04: But if his left became much stronger, then I don't know. Michael? I do not know Devin's left hand at all. Yeah, I mean, it's not as good as his right, but still very technical. Maybe less horsepower. Michael, how do you see this match?
SPEAKER_03: I think Alex is the favorite, but you have to bet on Devin. How do you not bet on Devin? You know what I mean? Like he's his mental game and his ability to to fatigue someone in the setup and pump your hand and just bleed you. Like like, uh, your he said, I mean, Alex could win the first two.
SPEAKER_03: But if Devin puts a brakes on him anywhere, it gets in his head. And part of it's going to be getting in his head. If he puts a brakes on him and commences to talk a massive amount of crap to him, it's, I don't know, man. I'm taking Devin, although I think Alex is the favorite. Like, I think Alex has the strength. I think Alex is the stronger arm wrestler. Okay, okay. What does the favorite mean? Favorite means that the one that you believe is going to win.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I'm not saying, uh, I think he's, I think the favorite as in the masses think that everything we've seen, every practice video, everything we've ever seen would put you as Alex being the favorite, but I still think Devin's probably going to win. Okay. So you are saying that his favorites. If you just took the information that's available, if you took the information that's available and every time we've seen them pull on everything else and styles and everything, and the fact that he just got ran over by Dada cam, you're sure, you know, he's going to come back hungry as shit. Um,
SPEAKER_03: Can you say that he was ran over by Dadecan, or do you think that especially the round one was... Oh, no, round one was great, but Dadecan's a bad dude, right? And I really told Devin, I was like, I think his explosiveness and just sheer aggression is going to win him the match, and that's kind of how it ended up, right? But, I mean, I'm picking Devin. So if you ask who I'm picking, I'm picking Devin. There is one...
SPEAKER_01: comment. Guy says, Michael, even deep down, you would bet on Devin if you ever face him. If I face him? Yeah. I will bet everything on me. Okay. I don't like intimidating people. I love Devin. Devin's awesome. But when Devin and I face again,
SPEAKER_03: He's going to get a very, very strong version of me. And it's going to take the very best version he's ever had against me to beat me the next time we arm wrestle. Because I'm going to keep progressing. He's going to keep progressing. And stylistically, people are like, oh, Devin knows how to arm wrestle. Well, I know how to arm wrestle Devin, too. So I think I like the match a lot. But a lot of people think that I just think Devin's my superior, and I don't. Michael, just say that...
SPEAKER_03: Just say that if a week later you would be facing Devon, where would your money go? Right now? Yeah. I bet on me right now. Devon's right looks great. Devon's right looks great. And the Devon that's going to show up against Vitaly in August may be the best Devon ever. But if I was pulling Devon this next Saturday instead of pulling Jorgi, I would bet on me.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, yeah. I mean, there is no disrespect in believing in yourself. No, I mean, you have to believe in yourself, right? Yes, I agree. Honestly, I don't know if Devin is going to be able to... I'm 50-50 with Devin and Vitaly. I'm 50-50. I have no idea how strong Vitaly is, because I feel like I'm really strong, and I did a great round one with him. But Devin's advantages usually are he has the better levers. He's got the longer leverage. He doesn't have that going against him. All the things that makes Devin Devin outside of his mental game,
SPEAKER_03: is his his longer lever oftentimes now devin does have crazy pronation crazy riser strength and those things might play a role but i don't think devin stops people as well as i stop people so i think he's catching i think he's catching vitale down here somewhere i don't know man i'm excited to see that if he catches we tell him somewhere here and if he vitale does the same thing do you do you think that vitale has chance
SPEAKER_03: Yeah. Cause Devin's longer than me, which puts him closer to the pin pad than I was. You know what I mean? Like Devin's arms longer. So he can't look how far back I was, but yet Vitaly was still able to reach me. Right. Devin's forearm is going to be another inch or so longer. That's going to give Vitaly more space to press on it. I don't know, man. I have no idea. It's 50, 50, just like I think me and Devin will be 50. Okay. 50.5 to 49.5 my way. Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, so, Georgi, Hermes Gasparini versus Levan Stakhinashvili. Oh, my God. I really want Hermes to win. Not that I support him or against Levan, but I think Levan is bored, and he needs a little...
SPEAKER_00: I got excited and lost at least one of my fights. But I'm afraid that this won't happen, because Levan will prepare well against Hermes. He will prepare better than against anyone else. And most likely, Levan will win. Maybe one round Hermes will win by fouls.
SPEAKER_04: What is your opinion?
SPEAKER_04: My opinion. Giorgi also said that Levan would be really motivated and really well prepared for Hermes. So Hermes will have little chances. Ivan, before you say your opinion, I want to tell you what I know. When they pulled first time in Dubai,
SPEAKER_01: Hermes didn't believe at all that he had a chance. He said that maybe one round if I stop him, like it will be enough for him. And he said that when he lost first two rounds, he looked at the Levan corner and Irakli was laughing at him, like making fun. This is what he says. And he gets so angry and that's how he started giving his everything, like by round three. This time, when he pulled Michael,
SPEAKER_01: Hermes said, maybe I don't pull him now. Maybe end of the year. I'm not sure if I'm ready. And then a few days later, he said, okay, I'm pulling him. I'm pulling him. And he was like, not sure. I just talked with him even today. He's very confident. It doesn't mean he's going to win. But just to let you understand that he was going Dubai to lose. He's going Chicago to win.
SPEAKER_01: It doesn't mean that he's going to win, but just you understand that mindset is very important, you know. If you go to lose, I mean, you can't really perform your best, you know. Okay, now your prediction I want to hear. I think that both athletes showed everything in their last arm fight and made conclusions. And I think that Levan
SPEAKER_01: has more chances again. Okay, more chances means 70? I would not say 70, 55, 45. Wow, so you are saying that actually the match is not like, there is no huge favorite, but Levan is favorite, but not like huge favorite. Okay, I understand, yeah. And how do you see Hermes like winning that match? Like the 45%?
SPEAKER_01: uh the only way like he did last time last time and stuff and michael let's go i've been 75 25 lavon this whole time and i'll probably stick with that
SPEAKER_03: And people think that that means it's a whitewash, it's a blowout. But I think Hermes has phenomenal chances. And Jorge said he thinks he might win one round. I think if he wins one round, he wins the whole thing. But it depends which rounds, which one rounds.
SPEAKER_03: Or the sixth round? Because they said they are going to pull all six rounds. Oh, I was unaware of that. I didn't know they were going to do all six. Okay. So, yeah. I mean, if he wins it before the match is over, if it's 3-0 and he wins round four, I think he wins the whole thing. Oh, okay. So, you are saying that he has a chance to win one round...
SPEAKER_03: and then his chance is 25% to win that one round before the match is over. And you are saying that once he wins that one round, then his chance is going to increase to almost hundreds. In my opinion, anyone who ever beats LeVon one round and literally beats him, like LeVon doesn't foul out, like they press his arm to the pad or they pin him somehow, the emotion that's going to take over in that athlete, realizing what they've just done, will be enough to carry them through the rest of the match, in my opinion.
SPEAKER_03: I think the high that you would be on after that one pin and the effect that that would potentially have on LeVon actually getting pinned, I think it turns the tide completely. So if anyone's able to get one pin before the match is officially over, I think that person can win the whole thing. And I think Armis is someone who is trained specifically to do that. I still think it's 75% chance LeVon comes out of this thing 4-0.
SPEAKER_01: But there's a 25% chance. It's a really big chance. It is. To me, 25% chance, it's huge. I mean, you give me 25% chance in the lottery, I'm the happiest guy in the world. You know what I'm saying? 25% chance is a lot. And Michael, you pulled against Ernest. What can you say about him, about his stable IQ, about his well-roundedness? Like, did you find him someone special?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I mean, I think he's as intelligent as anybody who's ever arm wrestled him. I mean, he's been doing it like his father is a world champion. He's been doing it forever and he's just grown into what we see today, which is a six foot to 285 pound specimen who is designed to be, who he's built to be an arm wrestler. I mean, everything about him is arm wrestling, right? So I think he probably has the strongest
SPEAKER_03: hammer curl type back pressure in the world. I don't know if anyone else could do what he does. I think he might have the strongest riser curl in the world. I don't know if anyone else can riser curl that much weight. Those two things right there make him a very worthy opponent for anyone. You know? Do you...
SPEAKER_01: smell like not the same exact but similar clothes or jumpers think about with hermes like young years sardine well-run of course of course i mean smoothness and then the transition with just i feel the same like like
SPEAKER_03: He's a very special athlete in our sport. The fact that he is so invested and committed to being the global number one arm wrestler on the planet, that's his purpose.
SPEAKER_03: I'm very excited to see the match. I'm a huge LeBron fan. And the people out there, I'm just going to put this out there. The people who talk about LeBron's cheek curl and how he used his back and all that shit. He has 396 pounds up here like this.
SPEAKER_03: That's insane. If it was a strong man doing it, I wouldn't be that impressed, but we know how strong Lavon is at arm wrestling. And this is the most he's ever done. So we already, you add that to the fact that he's already the unbeatable mountain Mount Everest of our sport. And now he has even stronger than he's ever been. I mean, he is look.
SPEAKER_01: Armas is facing a very prepared Levan. What can you say about those people who doesn't take seriously what Levan needs? The only thing I can say is go do it yourself. I would get your buddies to get on each side of the bar and hand you 396 pounds like this and see if it doesn't cripple you a minute. Hermes, Michael says that you need to go and do it yourself.
SPEAKER_01: I forgot that he wasn't as impressed with it as I am. But it's insanely impressive. It's insanely impressive. Which one is more impressed? Like just say that Levan doing that one rep, 180 kilo, or Ermes doing 92 kilo, eight reps. Just say that if Ermes would do 100 kilo one rep, would it be similar?
SPEAKER_03: absolutely absolutely and that my if that's that's how he's gonna win if he wins it's because of that movement and that rodent curl those are the two things that i think is stronger than lavonette levan says that levan said that hermes is doing with the full wristband and like bicep weight do you agree or do you think it's a bad pressure i still think he's it translates to arm wrestling
SPEAKER_03: it translates to arm wrestling you know what i mean so to me people want to criticize form all the time and i'm a guy who i don't care as long as you're moving heavier weight than you previously held at some point you're going to get in a match and you're going to be in the position that you're training and that's just going to translate you know in my opinion i mean i don't know man i've just i've been doing this a long time and if you if you know how to arm wrestle if you get stronger anywhere you're better arm wrestling
SPEAKER_00: I don't know how Irakli pulls with his left, but he knows that match
SPEAKER_01: used to pull left rather good. So, huge bet on match. That's interesting, yeah. And Michael, this one I'm going to ask you. Alan Ford versus Ryan Ballinger. I like Alan Ford a lot. Alan Ford's a hand-arm wrestler. His hand and wrist are very good.
SPEAKER_03: I don't think he has the arm that Alan Bellinger has, so I think it could be 3-2 Alan Bellinger. I think Alan Ford might can get a couple of fast pins on him, but I think Ryan Bellinger sinks that hook on. He puts that arm in there, and it may not be a hook. It may just be his arm power. He may just get tied to the strap with him and be able to just out-horsepower him. I think Bellinger wins 3-2 or better. Okay, and Fia versus Elin. Do you know Elin?
SPEAKER_03: I am not familiar, but if she's pulling Fia, she obviously is a badass. But I can't bet against Fia. After what Fia did to Malin, I don't even know anybody that way that could beat her. Georgi, do you know Arsen Kachataryan? Do you know him?
SPEAKER_00: Khachatryan, he fought on AMC. Yes, yes, yes, I remember him. He's good. Georgiev. It's Avstain versus Paulin. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Khachatryan is good at the top. Paulin is also very strong. Khachatryan hasn't been seen for a long time.
SPEAKER_04: He would say Paul Lim. Paul Lim would win? Yes, but he doesn't know for sure. Mainly he didn't see Arsene lately. And Ivan, what's your opinion? I think it's a 50-50 match. It could be a 50-50 match.
SPEAKER_04: I understand. It's difficult for me to say also. I know that Arsene is good both at chop roll and hook. He is more versatile, I would say. But we'll see. I think he's a little bigger than Paul.
SPEAKER_03: I think he's taller, but I don't think he's bigger necessarily. So Arsene's the guy that's been pulling out like in Arizona, like he's out in California. Yeah, he pulled Andre. 220 division. Yeah, he beats Andre. So I think Paul Lynn's a level above Andre. So I think Paul Lynn. Okay. And Michael, do you know Ivan Portela?
SPEAKER_01: I do not. Okay. Who's he pulling? Is it Marina or Joseph? Who's he pulling? Joseph Maranto. Yeah. That kid's impressive. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Yeah. And if he wins this one, he will be winning his third EVW match in a row.
SPEAKER_03: That's impressive. That's impressive. Yeah. He's a good kid too. He, uh, Rebecca liked his walkout song at King. That's a one December. She, uh, she enjoyed that kid. He, he's, you know, I've heard a lot of people brag about him and then we saw him beat Kevin Paco in a hook and, uh, then he had a good Arlington performance as well. So yeah, he's very impressive young man. Do you know Wallace? Wallace Dilley? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. You know, the math he's, he's open, you know?
SPEAKER_03: Ricard? Ricard, yeah. I think I want to say Ricard because he's so young and just powerful. So I would say 51-49 Ricard. But Wallace Dilley had a very good performance versus Marcel Barboza at that Salt Lake event. So it's 50-50, man. I did say Ricard on several other lives that I was on when people asked me.
SPEAKER_03: But Wallace Dilley is a thick, he's a big, thick dude. So it's going to be a great match. It's going to be a great match. I don't think either one of them sweeps. I don't think it's a 3-0, you know? That Ricard kid's impressive. Like, he's an impressive, impressive specimen. Yeah, I agree. The guy is a very special guy, yeah. And Wagner Bortolato versus...
SPEAKER_03: Manuel Batalla. Is this right or left? It's a left arm match. Left arm. So it's hard for me to pick Manuel against Wagner because I always thought Manuel was a right-handed specialist, you know? He's left arm world champion, super heavyweight champion. Oh, really? Yeah. Okay. I don't think he has the arm that Wagner has, but he probably has a better top roll.
SPEAKER_03: and it'll be if he if he beats him outside if he gets the outside move and gets him out of the side of his shoulder he beats him if he gets caught inside that shoulder is over with so i mean 50 50 i guess but wagner he hasn't had the best performances lately you know what i mean um but he's such a long time he had he had a he had an injury like you and then i i think he had the surgery i think and like after one year he's coming back again
SPEAKER_03: He's so big now. He's such a big dude. So, yeah, I would say 50-50. I don't know. How many matches are on this card? 10, 11? How many matches? I think 11 or 12. Oh, wow. Really? Okay. Do you know the order yet? Who? The order. Oh, I know it. Yeah, I know it. And before we finish, I would like to ask,
SPEAKER_00: the main event of the August card. Georgi, Vitaliy Laletin versus Devon in August. It will be a very difficult match. I hope that Vitaliy will prepare
SPEAKER_00: more responsible than he usually prepared. I know that he is not very much involved in preparation. Let's say so. I think that Vitaly will be uncomfortable for Devon. 49 to 51 in favor of Vitalik. Vitalik has a good start.
SPEAKER_00: big hand, strong grip, strong fingers. Yes, endurance on the side of Devon. Yes, maybe Devon is more technical, more practices all sorts of... on the grip, maybe more cunning. But it seems to me that it is the big blade, the palm of Vitalik will play a big role. Georgi said that
SPEAKER_04: He would like Vitaly to win. He would like Vitaly to get 100% ready for this fight. He thinks it will be a very difficult fight. But at the same time, he thinks that Vitaly is not comfortable for Devon because of his levers and his big hand. Vitaly has little advantage in size.
SPEAKER_04: He gives Vitaly 51 to 49. So very little advantage. Devin for sure is more technical. He has better endurance. But still, Georgi believes that Vitaly has little advantage.
SPEAKER_01: I agree with Jurgi. I think it's a very difficult fight for Vitaly and actually I was very surprised by
SPEAKER_04: his match against Michael. I thought that it would be easier for him. So I'm now really worried about Vitaly. But I still believe that he has chances, especially because he seems to have good floor press, yes. Because before Michael, I was not sure that he had such a move. And he himself didn't know that he had such a move. But now he feels good about it.
SPEAKER_03: Uh, that's why I think he has chances. Okay. Michael, I think it's 50, 50. Rebecca thinks it's 60, 40 Devin because it's Devin. I still go back to the, the levers, you know, Devin. So used to being the bigger, longer athlete, and he won't have any of those advantages versus Vitaly. And then we know Devin likes to slip. Can Devin slip with him? If Vitaly tries to hold onto him, you know, like.
SPEAKER_03: don't know i mean you think you can but devin will let his hand go and just let his fingers if the vitality clamps those hands he might actually get a pin outside the strap there's a lot of there's a lot of it's a crazy crazy match um it would be fun to be there to watch i'm i'm pretty confident that i won't be but it would it's a match that
SPEAKER_03: That is going to be amazing. You know, um, if, if Devin pulls it off, so here's the deal. I'm going to ask you this. I know we gotta go. Um, you said, cause I'd heard you previously say this prior to my match with, um, Vitaly that if look, Hermes beats LaVon that you might give LaVon an immediate rematch if he wants one, but you had said the winner of me and Vitaly was going to pull the winner of that match in December.
SPEAKER_01: And now Vitaly's pulling Devin. So if Hermes beats LeVon, is it an automatic rematch for LeVon? Or would he pull the winner of Vitaly to Devin? There is nothing automatic rematch or something. It is, first of all, Devin doesn't want to pull LeVon in December. But if Hermes beats him, he might want to pull Hermes in December. You see what I'm saying? Oh, if Hermes beats LeVon? Yeah. Listen, listen. If anyone is...
SPEAKER_01: Getting a match, I think the whole community, we owe this to Levan if Levan loses that match. If this guy has been the champion last like seven years, and if only once he's losing, and he says that, no, I don't want to pull anyone else, but I want to pull against this match, we are 1-1. If there is anyone on this earth, if Devin is asking for a third shot for Levan,
SPEAKER_01: I mean, Levan can ask the second match for, I mean, the revenge match for... No, no, I get it. I get it. I just didn't know where you stood on that. No, I just think that Levan is ahead of everyone about that kind of credit. Of course, of course. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, if he wanted it, he deserves it, of course. If he wants, if he wants. Maybe he will say, let me rest. But I don't know. I mean...
SPEAKER_01: I don't think he has any plan to lose anyways. I don't think he does. Only because you are saying that I need to assume that this happened, you know, I don't know. I'm just curious. I was just curious. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, Levan and Hermes, I'm same distance, like as the same athletes. Yeah. And Ivan, I didn't hear, did you say that any percentages you give for that match?
SPEAKER_04: I would also give 51-49 for Vitaly.
SPEAKER_01: And then Michael says 50-50. I honestly have no idea. Like, I honestly have no idea. So I can't even give him a favor, you know? So this match also, according to me, I mean, it's a 50-50 match. Very close match. I see Devon winning that match. I see Vitaly's winning that match. It's totally up to the preparation and the shape that we will see on that day. Will Vitaly be in the same shape he pulled you? Or even better?
SPEAKER_01: And Devin, will he be in a shape that we have never seen him before? We don't know. I expect he will be, honestly. You know what I mean? Like, it's Devin, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Anyways, guys, thank you very, very much to you, Michael, to you, Georgi Zelenov, and Ivan Matushenko. Thank you for joining, and thanks to everyone who came here to watch. And let me see you one more time. Georgi. Georgi, get yours back up there. Let's see it.
SPEAKER_01: Georgi, one more time. Show. I don't know. He might got me. He might got me. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. We will see. We will see. Take care, guys. Take care.
