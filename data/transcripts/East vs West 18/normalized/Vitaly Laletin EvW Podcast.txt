SPEAKER_00: Hello. Hello, guys. How is everything? Very good. You? How are you doing? I think we need to play with the unlock. Good? Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, let me share on social media, and then we start. So how are you, Vitaly? Good? Very good. Very good? That's good, that's good. Your face. Face and me, myself, I'm getting bigger as well, not only my face.
SPEAKER_00: yeah yeah yeah we saw that we saw the bicep everything what's that now 150 kilo yeah wow wow and and how is your shape we tell you uh
SPEAKER_00: You know, yeah, obviously I'm not still peaked. I still have a month to go and obviously everything is in my hands. It's going to be great at the competition day. Okay, Vitaly, let's start right away. Right away I want to start. You are one of the best
SPEAKER_00: You know, like your start, your speed, your hand strength is incredible. And do you agree that Michael is also one of the best stoppers?
SPEAKER_03: Look, I think that you are one of the best starters that you have. Explosion, wrist strength, everything is at the highest level. And how do you think, do you agree that Michael is one of the best who stops, you know, who goes into defense and stops. He is one of the best in such a fight when you need to stop someone. Yes, I fully agree that Michael is one of the best in this fight.
SPEAKER_03: If the opponent has a lot of power, Michael won't be able to stop him. I definitely agree. Michael is one of the best defensive stop-pullers. But if his opponent is too strong and strong enough, he will not be able to stop. Okay, can you ask him to show us some example? Like, who couldn't Michael stop?
SPEAKER_02: You know, I didn't really watch his fights. I haven't watched it all yet. But I will say one thing, that strength has a big influence in armwrestling. And if the opponent is stronger, then not everyone can stop him. You need to be stronger.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I haven't gotten through his matches a lot yet. I haven't watched everything. But still, I think I'm pretty sure that if his opponent is too strong and strong enough, he will not be able to stop.
SPEAKER_00: He pulled, Michael pulled against Andrei Pushkar two times. And the first time Michael stopped him every round, he beat him 6-0. And the second time when they pulled, first two rounds, Michael couldn't stop, but the following four rounds, Michael was able to stop him. And I think that Pushkar is one of the best, like starting, you know, starting and hitting sideways, you know, so power, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Like, can you translate this part first? The first time when Pushkar and Michael were fighting, he tried to hit him, but Pushkar hit him four times at once. And in the second match, Pushkar hit him twice at first.
SPEAKER_02: And then Michael stopped him every round, 4-2 in the end. And it seems to me that Pushkar is one of the best starters, who has strength in the center, who presses right away from the start. Well, yes, it is possible. But most likely, the second time Pushkar fought with Michael, he was probably not in his best shape. But again, the first fight showed that you can still beat Michael in one touch.
SPEAKER_03: Actually, Engin, just making sure, you said the first match Pushkar, Michael couldn't stop him, right? No, no, Michael stopped him every round. It was the opposite. Ah, yes, I translated it wrong. Sorry, sorry. On the contrary, yes, in the first match, he stopped him every round and won 6-0. But in the second match, Pushkar put him down twice, but then he couldn't anymore. I heard it wrong, sorry. Well, let's ask the same question, the same answer to this question.
SPEAKER_02: He followed up with another question. Maybe it was Pushkar's shape. Because the first time it was like this, but the second time he was better. He was better, but still out of six rounds he was able to
SPEAKER_03: Let's see what he has to say.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, but we will see how it goes. There is no real point in... No, no, no. The reason... Yeah, I understand. The reason I am asking this because a lot of people were thinking that, like, Vitaly is too much for Michael. But does Vitaly think that, like, there is a possibility, like, does he consider that kind of scenario that the match may stop? Does he have any plan B?
SPEAKER_00: What if the match stops? Like, first of all, ask him, you know, all this please translate, but ask him if he has a plan B and also what does he think the possibility of him flashing Michael and what does he think about the possibility of match being stopped?
SPEAKER_03: Yes, he says that in general, everyone thinks that Michael is not quite your level and you have to go through him quite easily. But what do you think, first of all, what is the probability that the match will stop and you will not be able to take him three times in a row? And if it happens and he stops you, do you have a plan B, that is, some bypass ways if the match stops? Plan B is always there.
SPEAKER_02: But I will still try to pass my class right into the pillow to prove to people that it is really possible to do it. I will still come from this.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I obviously have Plan B. Everyone always does and should have. But still, I'm aiming and I will try to flashbang him three times just to prove everyone that it's possible and that that can be done. And I'll be aiming to do that. Okay, there is Sam Splenkov says, wishing Vitaly prosperity and success in his future matches.
SPEAKER_00: Thank you, thank you. Ford example, when was the Ermes podcast? Two days ago. And Ermes said that Michael's winning chance is 70% against Vitaly. What does Vitaly think about this?
SPEAKER_02: There was a stream with Ermes a couple of days ago, and he said that Michael has a 70-30 chance against you. What do you think? Well, first of all, Ermes wants me to lose to Michael to prove that he's better than me. And I want to prove through Michael that Ermes is weaker than me.
SPEAKER_03: know ermis obviously wants me to lose against michael because if i lose then he proves that he's better than me but i want the opposite i'll beat michael and when i get further i'll prove that i'm better than him ah okay so this this math determines okay he thinks that it is not ermis's uh real opinion he he says this only because he wants la latin to lose
SPEAKER_03: If he's so sure that I'm not that strong and he's stronger than me, why would he decline the match and now say that I will lose to Michael? He declined the match against me, why would he? If he believes that he's better than me.
SPEAKER_02: But what do you mean, decline the match? They already pulled, and then now Ermes pulled Michael to pull Levan. Which match did he decline? When did he decline the match? I personally talked to him and told him, Ermes, let's fight. He said, let's fight Levan first, then I'll fight you. And when I won against Dzeranov, I stood on the stage and showed Ermes, I said, let's fight. He said, no, no, no.
SPEAKER_03: You know, when I was talking to him privately and I was like, let's pull again. You want to pull again? Like face me. He said, no, no, no. First you pull Levan and then you pull with me. And then when I pulled there enough and I was pointing at him and pointing him to come here, he was like, no, no, no, no, no. Okay. Okay. Okay. I understand. Talking about East versus West when he was there, you know? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 15. Yeah. Yeah. I remember. Yeah. So that's it. That's the thing that Ermes is scared of him. Ermes is scared of you.
SPEAKER_02: Well, maybe he's not scared, but he doesn't want to fight yet. He doesn't have a desire yet. When I fought with him, he recovered for a long time. He doesn't want to be injured anymore. Maybe he's not scared. Maybe he just doesn't want to pull me because first time we pulled, he was hurt for quite a bit. Oh, he was hurt. Oh, okay. Yeah. And what does Vitaly think if they would pull again? What if they fight again? What will happen?
SPEAKER_02: Now 4-0 if we have a title match and if it's a regular match then it's 3-0.
SPEAKER_00: Okay. Okay. Okay. I understand. Yeah. And one more question. Like he said he will try to finish Michael with flash pins. What does he think the possibility of him flashing Michael three times in a row?
SPEAKER_03: 50-50. Oh, 50-50. So 50% is going to flush him and 50% the match will stop. Yes, yes, yes. Okay. And if the match stops...
SPEAKER_00: What is the chance of winning? Still 50-50. Okay, so it's 50% the match will finish and 50% match will stop. And in that case, 50% Vitaly wins, 50% Michael wins. So basically, basically he's saying his chance of winning... What? Let Michael win.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, let's do it like Michael feels better than I think this way. So Michael feels better about it. Oh, this way he's saying this kind of things. Okay, okay, okay. So can he not tell us his real feelings? You won't tell us your real feelings? Only for Michael? No, to be honest, I want to try to break the pillow even without a bandage.
SPEAKER_03: you know obviously i still want to if i'm honest i mostly want to flash pin him win fast and i would actually want to pin him out of straps as well try to pin him out of straps i don't want to drag it out i just really want to see how fast i can do it and like try to do it as fast as possible
SPEAKER_00: I have a quick question yesterday when I talked with Michael he also agreed with that sometimes when we are trying to catch people so that they couldn't sleep you know does it does it tire the hands because one round he did that to Ermes and then after rounds Ermes was able to sleep and he get easier easier to sleep does it is there any like a
SPEAKER_00: Really? Like a Russian roulette, you know, you try to not let him go, but sometimes you try, it still goes, and then your hand gets a little bit tired because you didn't let it go, you know. What does he think about this? We talked with Michael yesterday about how you fight without a bandage. You know, when you try not to let him go, you hold him with all your might, you try to put a pillow on him.
SPEAKER_03: He compared you to a Russian roulette, if you think so. If you try to hold it with all your might and put it down, you did it and you could do it. But if you break out, then the hand starts to get tired and there is no risk that it will get tired faster because you try to hold it every time, it appears more and more. Because you try to drag it and your wrist also goes back. There is such a possibility. I. It turns out that I can't take my own strength more than he does.
SPEAKER_00: You know, but when he tries to sleep, he'll try to run away from me and I'll catch him. I'll try to catch him. But obviously it is kind of a risk when you try. You try. Yeah. Yeah. When yesterday I mentioned that when Levan tried to not to let Ermes go round three, you know, he tried, he tried and then sleep. And then in the restart, then
SPEAKER_03: Levan can get a little bit tired, you know. Yeah, like whoever attacks more and stays on the offense, he usually gets more tired because he's just trying to finish so hard. Yeah, I agree.
SPEAKER_03: and yeah and we tell you um do you want to pull devon regardless of the result of may event um
SPEAKER_02: I wanted to fight him last year, but he didn't want to. And now, somehow, he pushed our fight back to September. Apparently, he wants to look at me and see how I fight. But in general, yes, regardless of the result, I wanted to fight him.
SPEAKER_03: You know, obviously, I would like to pull Devon even earlier than right now, but he seems to be pushing the match a bit further to September, maybe to see how I pull with Michael. But obviously, regardless, I would like to pull Devon. It's an interesting match for me.
SPEAKER_02: So, he wins against Michael, or he loses, he wants to pull Devon? If you win or lose against Michael, it doesn't matter. You still have a desire to fight Devon. I told Engin before that it doesn't matter who I fight with. I will either lose or win. I am ready to fight anyone. I will never give up. I will fight everyone. Because it gives me pleasure.
SPEAKER_03: You know, even I said to you as well, no matter who you offer me as an opponent, I will always agree. Because why would I decline? First of all, it's joy for me. I like to pull. I want to pull everyone. I don't want to decline any offers. Yeah. I mean, LaLite declines only easy matches, not the hard matches. Only light matches. You refuse only light matches. Yes.
SPEAKER_00: You can ask Engin as well. There is no match ever that I declined. Yeah, he never rejected. I said, how about this? He said, okay. Only if the match is not so hard, he would be like, give me someone tougher. Other than that, he never is afraid to pull someone really tough.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, ready for anyone, always. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And yeah, he will get all the opportunity that, you know,
SPEAKER_00: he deserves yeah so basically he's saying that regardless of the match Michael match is ready to pull Devon yeah I understand that yeah and yeah okay so Vitaly let's talk a little bit about the following events main event match and how do you think that Ermes versus
SPEAKER_02: Levan will end up. Let's move on to the next event. After that, how do you think Ermes and Levan will go? Many people have already asked me about this fight. I had my own thoughts in my head. I think that right now Ermes is not as strong as he was last time. I think he hasn't gotten there yet.
SPEAKER_03: No, people ask me as well. I have some opinions about it. I think Ermes was in a better shape previous time, and it wasn't really a good decision to pull him that early. Maybe he should have let me pull Levan and match him later, because I'm not so sure he's as good as he could have been. I don't think he's as prepared.
SPEAKER_00: I just have a feeling that he can be even better and stronger than he is right now. I just had a podcast two days ago with Ermes, and Ermes thinks that he made the right choice. Because after Vitaly's match, he didn't pull for a long time. I think he didn't pull for 14 months.
SPEAKER_00: and and he said that he said yeah it was december to the february 14 months and so he said that his body recovered so good and now it is responding very well and if you wait for leon longer time he will be
SPEAKER_00: prepare him, prepare him, prepare him, and he will get tired. And he said that already he's in very good shape after Michael match, you know, and he still has about two and a half months.
SPEAKER_03: When I was talking to Ermes the other day, he thought that he did well and it was a good decision, because he had the last match with you, and after that he rested for 14 months before Michael, and he recovered well, all the fans left, everything was great, and it seemed to him that if he continued to wait, he would slowly start to get tired of this preparation, and his form would not be as good as it is now.
SPEAKER_00: Well, it's his business, everyone's opinion. I'm just saying what I see now. Obviously, his opinion, everyone has an opinion. I just say how I see it and how I feel about it. If Vitaly wins against Michael, isn't it good for him to pull end of the year? Because whenever I ask Vitaly, you know, because
SPEAKER_00: If Ermes would win against Michael, it was planned that Ermes was going to pull later. And Vitaly said that May is too early for him to pull against Levan.
SPEAKER_03: Is it not good for him to pull, I mean, if he wins against Michael, to pull the winner of Ermes and Levan match later? Later, yeah. When we were talking to you, you said that in May it would be too early to fight with Levan, but now it turns out that Ermes and Levan will fight in June, and after your match with Michael, if you win, you will be able to fight with Levan by the end of the year, and for you this is even better.
SPEAKER_02: Yes, for me it's good, but there is such a thing as a setting, when you are already setting up, you are already preparing morally and physically, but you are canceled and your mood drops a little. I think it's all for the best.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, obviously it's better that I pull him later. But you know that when you get ready psychologically, you start to train, you start to get ready for that match that is coming. And then when it gets pushed back and it's canceled, you lose it a little bit, that motivation. But overall, obviously it's better that it's later. I understand. And another question. He said this before already, I asked him, but I want to ask you again. If he...
SPEAKER_00: Like if he wins against Michael and then is it better for him to have a left arm match before Levan match or a right arm match against Devon? Or would it affect him, you know, to have another right arm match?
SPEAKER_03: If you won the next match, would you prefer to fight Devon on the right or on the left? Because if you fought on the left, your right hand wouldn't be so tired. My left hand isn't ready yet. It hasn't recovered after Kamila and Blonsky. I fought Artem Morozov and finished him off.
SPEAKER_02: And I need time to recover. I'm not ready to fight on the left hand yet. It hasn't come off yet. I haven't done it yet. While there is an accent on the right hand.
SPEAKER_03: You know, my left arm isn't that good and in shape right now because I hurt it a little bit against Kamil. And then when I put Morozov, I kind of finished it off, you know, and now I'm just trying to lay off, rest it a bit. I'm not training with it. The whole main accent is on the right arm and all the preparation is on the right arm. Also, he wants to go all right arm in 2025, no left arm. Yes, I want to go all right arm in 2025, so that my left arm stops.
SPEAKER_02: I think I'll start training my left hand from the middle of 2025, because some moments are not given to me in training. I can only train with small weights.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I would like to pull whole 25 only right arm. That would be good. And in the middle of 25, I would start lightly working on my left because there are some points that bother me and I can't really train. I can only do like very light, light weights. So he wants to heal his arm. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Hey, I think Dadikyan has an eye on his crown. Yeah, Dadikyan is looking at your crown like that.
SPEAKER_03: Please, let them deal with Alizhan first. Then they will come to me. Alizhan should fight to qualify for you. The thing is...
SPEAKER_02: Subscribers and people close to me have always called me Alizhan, and now they are calling me Dadikyan. But the fact is that they did not fight among themselves in their categories, let them fight in their categories first, find out who is the strongest in them, then they come to me. Because I am higher in the rising categories, and I need to show a little respect.
SPEAKER_03: You know, subscribers and close people to me, they were always like saying, oh, here's Alijan, here's Alijan. But then they started like, here's Darikyan, here's Darikyan. And they're a weight lower. So might as well match them up, get who is stronger one and give the stronger one to me because I'm a weight class above and you should pay some respect to me.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know, I don't know. I heard that Dadecan is becoming near 130. That's what I'm hearing. I heard that Dadecan is getting closer to 130. I don't know, I don't know. I'll personally check it in Moscow, put it on the scales and see. You know, I'll be in Moscow, I'll get scales and I'll check myself to make sure. Okay. Another question to Vitaly. Vitaly, you are gaining weight and
SPEAKER_00: Does it translate to power, like a lot? Or just... A little bit. The question, like when he pulled against Levan in 2019 and now, how much stronger he is?
SPEAKER_03: Now you gain more and more weight, and it somehow passes. Do you feel that you are getting stronger and stronger? Because, for example, if I compare you, when you first fought with Levan in 2019, how much stronger are you, how do you feel this progress? Well, there is progress in any case. When I fought with Levan, my weight was about 122-123 kg. When Levan then weighed already, in my opinion, 170-175 kg he weighed.
SPEAKER_02: If you compare me to the person I was and who I am now, two different people, I understand that Levan has become much stronger, in any case. But still, I think, if you compare two people like this, then I scored more between the Vitaly who was, who is now, than Levan, who was and became.
SPEAKER_03: You know, obviously, I feel getting better. Of course, I do. If we compare me when I first put Levan, I was 122, 123 kilograms against him. And he was already, like, about 170. I feel like if we compare myself from that match and myself right now, it's like two different people. Obviously, I know that Levan is progressing as well. Nobody says anything about that. He's obviously getting better. But I feel like I progressed more than he did.
SPEAKER_00: So his progress from 2019 to now is bigger than what Levan has. Okay, I understand that part. And like the question, like I try to understand how much better he become.
SPEAKER_00: And I don't know, maybe I have asked this question before, but like compared to the Ermes match to now, like how much stronger? Like, can he tell me like, I'm like 5% stronger on finger and 10% on arm, you know, like just so that I could understand.
SPEAKER_03: Yes, to understand, for example, if you take a match with Ermes, if you take it from there, what percentage ratio can you tell us, for example, fingers can be 5% stronger than steel or a brush, to understand how much you have progressed, for example, in any case, I became stronger, but I don't have any training now where I would compare.
SPEAKER_03: You know, I don't really have exercises right now that I do that I would compare to Ermias preparation. But first of all, I could tell that I'm getting better for sure. I feel that I'm getting better. But like, let's say the lifts that I did for Ermias, and I did them for 10 reps.
SPEAKER_02: right now when i'm preparing i can do them for 20 reps the same exercise that i did for armies so he doesn't he doesn't increase the weights but he increased the reps or i misunderstand what he means um
SPEAKER_03: You know, yeah, I laid off and I tried to do more reps, more quality, more endurance. Because after more stuff, I was doing some, not like one rep max, but close to the max weight. And I felt my wrist a little bit, so I didn't want to hurt it or anything. I stepped down and I started to do more reps.
SPEAKER_00: There are two superchats I will quickly read. Dino says, it is not for this podcast, but where is Ali Can? I mean, Ali Can is in Kazakhstan, my friend, and
SPEAKER_00: He just had Ramadan, we all had, you know, and he fasted for one month, so he couldn't get prepared for this event, but for the upcoming events, for sure, we will see. Sam Splenko says, does Vitaly think that Alijan can hook him? This is Superchat. Superchat from the guy, he asks, what do you think, can Alijan hook you? Well...
SPEAKER_02: Maybe everything, maybe everything. But I'm not sure about that. At least not to mention my right hand, but to mention my left hand, for the next few years, I don't know how many, no one has ever twisted their left hand.
SPEAKER_03: You know, everything's possible, but that one I'm not so sure about. Because if we only go by left arm, it's been, I would say, around eight years that I haven't been hooked. Okay. If we go only by left arm. Yeah. Is it possible that we tell you to a little bit raise the camera so we can see, like, we see, like, not the full... Yeah. Can you move the camera a little bit so that you can see? Because you... Ah, here.
SPEAKER_00: oh yeah okay yeah yeah that's good yeah and and another one is okay one guy is asking are the demirka is asking
SPEAKER_00: Ok, what is his plan to weigh, you know, against Levan? He says, you know, we don't know if he's going to pull Levan or not, but time will show. But if he pulls Levan, what does he plan? Like, he needs to, is 150 ok? Or he thinks that he can gain more weight? If the match with Levan happens and you get to him, when you will fight, do you have any goal of weight? Or do you want to stay in these 150 kg?
SPEAKER_02: I want to wake up, get up on the scales and weigh 150 kilograms. This is in its best form, in its worst form. I want to weigh 150 kilograms. It will be enough for me. I don't chase after weight, I chase after strength. I understand that this weight should be enough for me.
SPEAKER_03: know uh i want to wake up in the morning uh fully fully clean no food nothing step on a scale and be 150 kilograms i don't think being much much bigger doesn't matter i'm not in a pursuit of weight i try to be as strong as possible being bigger and heavier is not my main focus
SPEAKER_00: What did you learn about Devon's hand when you were in sparring? What did you learn about his hand? What were your impressions?
SPEAKER_02: Devon has a good hand. I understood one thing about Devon and I learned that you just don't need to listen to him. He has a very solid hand, very strong, but one main thing that I learned about Devon that is the most important, just don't listen to him. Just don't listen to him. Since I'm a person who doesn't understand English, I don't understand what Devon says, it's much easier for me to fight him.
SPEAKER_03: And because I'm a person who doesn't know English and I don't understand it, for me it's so much easier to pull Devon. Yeah, I heard that Devon is going to hire an English teacher for Vitaly for free. He's going to pay for it. Yeah, I heard that Devon wants to hire a teacher for you in English and pay for everything so that you can learn it. Okay, let him. He's giving me the money.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, yeah, let's do it like this. He gives me the money so I can pay the English teacher, but I won't hire an English teacher. Okay, he's just gonna put the money in the pocket, right? Yeah, yeah. Okay. Yeah, that's interesting. Yeah. Vitaly, okay. I wasn't sure if I would ask this, but I will ask. We know that you have...
SPEAKER_00: the best grip in the world, best grip. And your hits, your pronation is almost impossible to hook you and everything. But like Ermes mentioned that if you try to go sideways to finish Michael, it is like almost sure that the wrist will go back. And do you agree with that if you try to pin
SPEAKER_03: Michael, right away, do you think that your wrist will fail? I thought not to ask the question, maybe, but still ask. When we talked to Ermes about your match with Michael, he also said that if you have a chic pronation, a hard blow, you have the best grip in the world, the strongest, but still, when you fight with Michael,
SPEAKER_03: If you go to the side right away, the probability that your wrist will go away at the end is almost guaranteed. What are your impressions? Do you still think that you can go to the side right away and you can put it down? I think so. I think I'll try anyway. You can't listen to Dmitry Ermes at all.
SPEAKER_03: You know, still, I think that it's possible and I will try to. I'll just go sideways and I will pin him. And as of Ermes, you don't really have to listen to what he has to say. Say again? The last part about Ermes? You don't always have to listen to what Ermes says.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, so he's saying just ignore, you know, it's just that Ermes is talking nonsense. Ermes talked to Michael and they want to pressure me in their own way, because they have an advantage. Yeah, yeah, Ermes and Michael, they teamed up and they're trying to gang up on me together, because for them it's good if I lose. Ah, okay, okay, okay, I understand, I understand. Anyway, so...
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, so let's go a little bit more to Ermes versus Levan. And he said that it would be better if Ermes would wait a little bit longer to get prepared. Does it mean that Ermes doesn't have a chance according to Vitaly?
SPEAKER_03: I think his first match against Levan was closer than it will be right now. I think Levan will win easier.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, this time he's expecting a dominant performance. Yeah, okay. Okay, yeah. And this is the third time I'm going to ask. And first two times Vitaly said that his chance against Devon is 99%. Does his skill think the same way? I'm asking you for the third time, because the first two times you had exactly the same answer. When you fight Devon, your chance is still 99%.
SPEAKER_03: What will I do then? When you fight Devon, you still have 99% chance against him. When I beat him? He's asking when I'm going to win against him. I asked when you pulled Devon, but he just corrected me as when I win against him. Oh, so he basically... Okay, what does it mean? Does it mean 100% now? Because he said that when I win? The fact that you just corrected me when you beat me, so it's already 100%, not 99%. It's already 100%.
SPEAKER_02: I left 0.1% for Devon, but I won't leave anything for him now. He behaved badly. My friend disappointed me. He said bad things about me, so I won't leave anything for him.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. My friend disappointed me a little bit. He's talking bad things about me. So now I'm taking it back. Okay. So that 1% was because that was his friend. Yeah. Yeah. He was being nice to him. Yeah. He was being nice for that. Yeah. Okay. Okay. But that, that is interesting. That one made a video and he said, he said that, he said that if, if Vitaly pulls him, that, that may end up that Vitaly will be
SPEAKER_00: losing his chance to pull against Levan? Is that because Devon really thinks that he's a good friend of Vitaly and he's trying not to stop him pulling? Like he's giving a favor to Vitaly? He won't pull him? Yeah, and so if Devon doesn't pull Vitaly, and he means that he won't have to beat him, so Vitaly can
SPEAKER_00: deservingly pull Levan. Is he giving a favour to Vitaly or is he trying to use this as an excuse to avoid him? What does Vitaly take? How does Vitaly take that?
SPEAKER_03: Do you think that if Vitaly doesn't want to fight with you, he should go to Levan? Or does he do it as an excuse not to fight with you? I think it's more of an excuse not to fight with me
SPEAKER_03: You know, I think it's an excuse because if he's really that scared to pull me and he doesn't want to pull me, just tell everyone and let's get down with it because I'm ready to pull. And if he doesn't want to, that's fine. Just tell everybody and that's it.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, so he thinks that he's trying to avoid Vitaly. Okay, so Vitaly is saying no danger, you know, on pulling Devon about his main target, you know, yeah, okay. And okay, I understand.
SPEAKER_00: We will see. We will see how it will be. And the only way Vitaly to reject pulling Devon, he said that if he loses against Michael or if he wins against Michael, he will still pull Devon. And probably the only way that Vitaly wouldn't pull Devon is if he gets injured or something, you know, get hurt during the Michael match.
SPEAKER_03: You know, it seems to me that you talked about the match with Devon. It doesn't matter if I lose or win, I definitely want to fight with Devon, it's interesting for me. In short, the only chance for you to say no to this match is only if you get injured with Michael. In any case, you are interested in him anyway. You will only stop the trauma.
SPEAKER_00: Even an injury won't stop me. I'll get healed and I'll pull down. No, no. In such a case, I wouldn't set such a match. I know, like, Tartashkin is the same way. He always says, okay, whatever you say, I'm going to pull, you know. And Vitaly is probably the same way, but we wouldn't do that yet. Yeah. Anyway, so...
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I wish Vitaly a safe preparation, healthy preparation, and I will meet him and Michael in Istanbul in four weeks. And is there anything he would like to add? And we will also have another podcast together with Michael and Vitaly. Anything he would like to add before we finish?
SPEAKER_03: I wish you good preparation, no injuries, nothing, all the best. You have four weeks left, we will all see each other in Istanbul soon, and we will have a podcast after that, with Michael too, that is, you will all be together. And did you want to add anything, maybe at the end? I would like to say thank you to the East-West tournament,
SPEAKER_02: The most important thing is that people look at us. The most important thing is that people look at us.
SPEAKER_03: No, I want to say thank you to East vs. West, to you, Engin. It's like a holiday for us every time, you know, the big tournament, everyone's pulling. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose, but the most important is like you're there, people are watching and it's just so good. I want to say just thank you for all the great competitions. Yes, yes. I also thank him and the other superstars for making all this possible.
SPEAKER_03: Thanks to you and to all the other stars that we have that do this. Thanks. As for Michael, I'll tell him myself. Thank you. And what's regarding Michael, I'm going to tell him myself after this. I'll talk to him later. What do you mean? About what?
SPEAKER_00: No, like a message to Michael. He's going to talk to Michael in private. Like he's going to sell... Oh, he doesn't have any message right here. He's going to tell him later. Okay, yeah. There is another super chat. Sam Splankov says, any chances for Denis to come back? Denis is planning to come back, but he is still working on the health issues and hopefully he will be back, you know, soon. That is what I believe, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: And once again, Vitalik, thank you very, very much, my friends. And yes, yes. And thank you, Alex. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Take care. Good, good, good. Whoa. Take care.
