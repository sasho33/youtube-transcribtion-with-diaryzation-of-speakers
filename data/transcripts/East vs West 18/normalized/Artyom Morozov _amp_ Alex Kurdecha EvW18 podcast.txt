SPEAKER_04: I don't know. I know a lot of news. That you will be in my corner and you will be helping me to smash them. Alex, we are live now. And is Morozov here? Not yet. Hello, Pavlo. It is always refreshing to see you. Always.
SPEAKER_04: Same here, thank you. How are you? Good, good. And Alex, you? How are you? Yes, glad to see you guys. Only seven days to the biggest event of the history in armwrestling. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. It will be incredible. This is the, I think, first time Ermes, Levan and Devon on the same cards. Yes, yes.
SPEAKER_04: Those are the probably three top names. They are number one, number two, number three, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And let's wait for Morozov to come and then we start a deep conversation. How is the preparation? I know you are helping Robert, Pavlo.
SPEAKER_02: Yes, I'm helping as much as I can, or as little as he needs. Yeah, no, everything is fine. I don't see any, you know, hiccups. Maybe Robert does, but yeah, it was... I'm vocal, so it's a little easier for me, you know, to connect with people. But otherwise, everything is good. Hello. Hello, Artem, how are you?
SPEAKER_04: And you? Great to see you. Great to see you. Thank you so much. Okay, so let's start. Let's start. Okay. I'm sharing. Okay, Alex, let's start with you. Alex, I mean, this is probably one of the biggest challenges in the history.
SPEAKER_00: Yes, for sure. Left arm pulling Devon, right arm pulling Morozov. And what do you think your chances are? You know, first of all, yeah, it's a big chance, big opportunity and big responsibility. Both guys are awesome. They are different, different styles. Devon is more about tricky games, about not going to catch any trick.
SPEAKER_00: And Artem is a pure power, very fast on the ride. Maybe I don't say like fastest, but it's also always fast game and about big level of horsepower with Artem. So for sure, I will get 100% of everything I have. And what can I say? I'm now training every day. Some of guys already know that I'm now in the best shape of my life.
SPEAKER_00: And the biggest challenge was in front of me. Yeah, it's true. It's the biggest challenge to pull left and right with two beasts like these guys. Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure, for sure. And Artem, how is everything, my friend? Everything is very good. Everything is perfect. He's ready to go.
SPEAKER_02: Ready to go. And Artem, what do you expect from this match? He said I'm expecting that I will really like the actual pulling. He said what? He said that he's expecting that he will like very much the actual process of armwrestling. Aha, aha.
SPEAKER_04: Do you expect this to go the same as the last time with the left arm match? Do you think it will be the same as the last time? No, I think it will be different.
SPEAKER_01: My left hand is different from the right hand of Alex. I am 100% ready and I hope that it will work out. We will show a good fight. Artem says that he thinks that it's gonna be different because
SPEAKER_04: Alex's left and right is different and Artyom's left and right is different and he thinks that it's going to be a different match but he hopes that it's going to be a beautiful armwrestling beautiful armwrestling, ok ok, so he will continue the same way like Vitaly match not talking too much before the event
SPEAKER_01: You will continue in the same spirit as before the match with Vitalik. You won't talk too much before the match, right? Well, I don't know. I don't have the heart to talk a lot. I just want to show. I will talk later when I grow up, like Levan. Then we will troll each other.
SPEAKER_02: Artyom saying that, you know what, it's not really me when it's becoming of talking. Let's arm wrestle. And he said, when I'm gonna grow up, like, I don't know who, like Levan maybe, and then we will gonna troll each other. Okay, why is that? Why he needs to be like Levan? His personality will change or he will be more confident?
SPEAKER_01: Artem, does your personality change if you grow up like Levan? Or will you just be more self-confident? Well, you see, there will be... I don't think anything will change inside of me, but I think I will be able to talk a bit.
SPEAKER_02: Artyom is saying that it's unlikely that it's gonna change something inside of me, but on that level, I probably can yapping a little bit, you know. It's about the confidence, probably. To talk, you need to have some kind of background. Well, so that you have at least, I don't know, an illusion of invincibility.
SPEAKER_02: Artem is saying that to make a lot of conversation and trolling and all this beautiful stuff, you need a background and you need to have at least an illusion that you are unbeatable.
SPEAKER_02: So only the unbeatable people should talk trash. At least they have an illusion that they are unbeatable. So either you need to be that good or...
SPEAKER_04: Uh, yeah. Okay. Okay. Alex, my friend, you like, if you just go a little bit back, I should say that you had big goals and you still have big goals, but if I just go, you know, rewind a little bit and then
SPEAKER_04: After some time, your first match was against Morozov for title. You lost that match, but everyone said that Alex, you did a great job, and you really gained the respect of everyone with your well-rounded way. I mean, you, I mean, I would say for myself that you show hook, you show shoulder press, you show side pressure, you show endurance, explosions, everything in that match.
SPEAKER_04: But then you had a match with Svetko and then you had a very big opportunity to pull Levan if you could have passed Jerry. And I mean, according to social media, after you beat Svetko, people
SPEAKER_04: said that you were favorites. But things didn't go as you expected. And then the next match you lost against Dadikan. And now you have a huge challenge. Huge challenge. Like, left arm, Devon, who is coming back to his old shape. And right arm, you're pulling Morozov. But Morozov that you are pulling right now doesn't look the same as the Morozov that you pulled first time.
SPEAKER_04: is just much bigger use of his performance against Vitaly Laletin and from other people we also hear that you are in incredible shape and my question is that are you do you have like fear that like do you have pressure on you that you can't afford to lose any more matches
SPEAKER_00: You know, the answer is very easy, very easy this time, because sometimes when during preparation you have some troubles, like you have something which don't give you possibility to understand that you did the best way, yeah? Sometimes you do good, but you see some results, but you are not can do proud of your training process. This time, I may be going like,
SPEAKER_00: Everything or nothing. My preparation was also everything. I don't have any fear. We were having a podcast with Devon like 10 minutes ago. He knows that I beat all my personal records this time.
SPEAKER_00: and I can say truly that now I'm in the best shape of my life. Sometimes in some exercise before I was, but now the reality that maybe I'm most completed, of course in the future maybe I will beat my version of this, but for now I see that... You have never been this strong?
SPEAKER_00: Yes, that's the reality. I've never been this strong, I've never been this durable, I've never been so fast and I've never been so, you know, in different exercises or in such results like now. So I can say thanks God that my training process was so successful and even guys, if they beat me, that means that they are really better and nothing else.
SPEAKER_00: That's why I'm not so confident, but I'm really happy to be in this shape and go with these guys.
SPEAKER_02: Let me translate real quick for Artem. Just a conclusion of it, okay? Artem, Engin asked Alex, he said, well, your previous career was so good that you quickly moved forward, and there was even such an opportunity that if you fight Jerry Cadarette, you will fight Levan, but unfortunately, everything went wrong, and then there were several losses to Dedikyan.
SPEAKER_02: There were injuries and so on. How is the process going now? Lesha says that everything is different this time. The training process was not completed with any flaws. The training and preparation went almost perfectly. I broke all my personal records.
SPEAKER_02: He said that I was in a very good shape, not only in strength, but also in speed. There was a really cool preparation and I was in a very good shape. If I lose and the guys win, it just means that they are better than me, and not that I didn't have enough. I'm ready and we'll see. You're right, I agree with him.
SPEAKER_01: Artyom is saying, yeah, absolutely respect and that's why I said that, you know, a lot of talking is not really taking place here.
SPEAKER_02: A lot of respect to Alex for taking two matches and we will see. He said if it would be Jerry, maybe I would talk a little bit more, but with Alex I would not. Okay, why with Jerry? Why with Jerry? Because Jerry would not take any left-hand matches. Because he cancelled the match? No, he said because Jerry would not take any left-hand matches.
SPEAKER_04: say again? because Jerry would not take any left hand matches okay okay and okay so Alex basically basically I understand you are just like going all way and then basically you say yes Engin I cannot afford any more losing and you realize it and then that is why you are going for
SPEAKER_04: I mean, all the way that you can do, you know, your best. Yeah. Yeah. And how do you see your chances against these guys? I know you don't like to, you try not to talk so much. Last time when we did the podcast about like, you kind of save everything to the table.
SPEAKER_04: And I don't know after that you started to talking or not, but like basically, are you gonna beat these guys?
SPEAKER_00: you know this like very very also easy answer I'm going that like only for winning in mindset I'm already did it but we like I also respect guys who understand the reality yeah reality that today you can be the strongest and like second day even stronger guy come and you don't know that he is stronger but he shows that he is stronger yeah sometimes be
SPEAKER_00: surprised by somebody's shape. A lot of guys tell me now that Devon is not so strong on the left. I see his preparation. He sees my preparation. We motivate each other very much. I know his level and he's not an easy guy for sure. Not just because of his technique, not just because of his tricks and understanding of armwrestling and how to not go to the strong side of his opponent, but
SPEAKER_00: he really trained like every day every day he trained like guys holding him by two hands Artem already shows to all world of armwrestling his level when he was pulled with Vitaly because that day a lot of guys were thinking that probably Vitaly will open the wrist maybe like Artem will hold a little bit but a lot of guys were saying a lot of people waited for flashbacks
SPEAKER_00: Yes, like a flash pin or maybe pin not so like one second but two seconds and that's it. But he chose to overvote his level and this is already the answer. Like this guy can do the same on the right.
SPEAKER_04: so it's never a good way to underestimate the style or the strength of your opponents I'm really happy and I'm really thankful to you I'm sure you're not underestimating them Alex, I know you're not underestimating them but whenever you see them and compare with your current shape, do you feel confident?
SPEAKER_00: Yes. Like I said, thanks to God, thanks to my training process, I'm really happy about my shape. So, I'm ready to everything. If guys stronger, this, you know, upper power, they're stronger and that's it. But I'm really happy about my shape. And the thing is that Devon had many matches with left arm. Yes, he took them seriously, but it was not really so seriously.
SPEAKER_04: And right now, I think there is one thing that we need to consider that he is also preparing to be reaching his heavies, you know, for another goal, you know, like again, to reach Levan. But on the way, there are some other guys and the first of them will be Vitaly Laletin.
SPEAKER_04: And I think that right now he's also getting into a crazy shape for that match. And then you are on his way while he's walking that way here. And do you agree, Pavlo, that... Yeah, last time I saw Devon in Texas, Arlington. Yeah, he is different now. He is huge. He usually, when you look at him, he usually looks skinny.
SPEAKER_02: Not anymore, not anymore. He's big and thick and yeah, I mean, it's a very serious opponent when it's, you know, Devon is Devon. I would not underestimate him and I still think that Alex is much more powerful than Devon and has more abilities left-handed, but
SPEAKER_00: Take him seriously. I believe that he is a very serious opponent. Very serious. Ford sure. Ford sure. Like, you know, we always... Allen the preparation now, we are in contact with him. I see he also takes it very seriously. He probably will be the best left hand of all last years. Because he really trains it now. And what he's doing on the practice impresses me.
SPEAKER_04: That's why it was like motivation to me to beat my personal records. Pavlo, do you think that, do you think that, like, you see Vicali, every event stronger and stronger and stronger. You saw Michael Paul's, you know, last shape. He was crazy. He lost last two matches, but we saw, you know, that he really, he really took the wrist of Laletin and he really gave like hard match, people doesn't understand, but to Ermes.
SPEAKER_04: According to Ermes, he was that close. And I was right there, you know. And now you see, Alex is saying he's in his best shape. And Devon is getting bigger. And Ermes, you saw the things that he's lifting.
SPEAKER_04: And we saw Artem Morozov in Georgii, Tbilisi against. So, do you think that armwrestling has reached a crazy level, Pavlo? It is, it is. Five years ago, I thought this is it. We are at the cosmic level and there is no place to grow anymore.
SPEAKER_02: when we had you know top five or top eight i'm sorry i thought this is it you know this is up again and now when we have east versus west creating even more motivation for the guys and now i understand that there is a sky is the limit you know it's it's it's still glowing and the levels are crazy yeah 123 kilo Vitaly Laletin gave that one first round match to Devon at that time i was just in Romania
SPEAKER_04: I saw even the junior competition, youth competition, crazy level, crazy, crazy level. And those guys are very well-rounded and aggressive, you know, and it's a tested event. And it's just like level is just crazy, crazy. Like armwrestling just broke its chains and it's just running to the future. Because the time came where the older generation became trainers
SPEAKER_04: And you know, there is a professional trainers available. So the younger generation starting earlier and they are by the junior years by 18, they are becoming monsters already. My friends, my opinion is a bit different. I think it is the East versus West that really inspires all over the world. And finally, there is something
SPEAKER_04: that all young people say, I want to be like Devon, I want to be like Ermes, I want to be like Morozov, or Alex, or Levan. So there are a lot of right now, like if I would ask to every guy, junior youth guy or sub-junior guy in Romania, who is your favorite Armwrestler?
SPEAKER_04: I guarantee you, 95% of them will be some of those guys from the East versus West stage. And then I think that East versus West stage, these guys are pulling against each other. It really makes them crazy strong. They just meet, they see their mistakes, they go home, they do the homework, come back stronger, and then the other one learns, everyone learns. So it is, how do you call it in English? Iron sharpens iron?
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, it is exactly what's happening. Okay, Morozov, Arthur Morozov, you don't want to talk, you just say you're prepared, you will do your best and everything. So how is your shape right now? Do you think that your shape is now as good as your Tbilisi shape?
SPEAKER_02: He says, if you don't want to talk so much with us, let's talk about your form, how good it is. Tell me, what is your form? Do you think it is at the level of the one you had in Tbilisi or maybe even better? You know, I just kept my right hand after Tbilisi. I managed to add it somewhere.
SPEAKER_01: I didn't do anything. Well, as always, in principle. I didn't do anything that bothered me. I did what bothered me. I added something, even a little. In good shape. I can't say that I'm top. Because I'm far from being top. I think I'm still young. 18 years old, more or less, Pavlo. Do you remember? I remember, I remember. So...
SPEAKER_01: So that's it. One more reason why I don't want to talk much. Why should we waste our energy on talking, chatting, trash-talking and so on? We're not going to punch each other in the face to answer for the words. We're just going out to fight. And our goal will be set when we go out to fight.
SPEAKER_01: You have to put all your energy into it. When you talk too much, it's hard to turn on Berserk mode.
SPEAKER_02: Artyom is saying that his form is good and he's been keeping his right arm after the belice on a constant level. And in some of the aspects he even gained a little bit. In some of the aspects where maybe some of the issues prevent him from doing something he's not, but still on a level. And he said it's not, I believe that this is not my top, top shape yet.
SPEAKER_02: that I have a lot of time and he said 18 years. I will tell you the background of this when we've been together at East vs West 8 in Istanbul. Artyom was a little sick with a stomach and he was a little bit upset that he lost and I walked to him and I'm like, Artyom, you know that you are 18 years younger than me. Can you imagine how much time you have? And I'm still here.
SPEAKER_02: And you are still getting stronger, Pavlo. And I'm still getting stronger. And that's what he remembers now. And he said, I have lots of time and I believe that my best ever shape is ahead. And he also said about trash talk. He said, you know what? I don't like trash talk because I accumulate my energy to turn on my berserker regime at the table. Not right now. I understand. And Artem, what is
SPEAKER_01: Alex has a chance against Devon with his left arm. What chances do you think Alex has against Devon with his left arm? I think Alex has more chances than Devon himself. I hope that Alex will have the same endurance as we have in the fight with him. He has a high arm, it will be convenient for him to fight with Devon. That's why I give Alex more chances to win.
SPEAKER_02: saying that Alex's chances are better to win than Devon's chances to win and he said that because of the Alex's long liver and long arms he will be very comfortable on a table with Devon and he said that I believe that Alex's endurance will be the same as our match with Alex and he said then you know the chances are higher than Devon's and he believes that Alex will win
SPEAKER_04: And guys, by the way, East vs West 1 was on June 12, 2021. And today is June 12, 2025. In 4 years, all together, how far we have come. How far we have come. Incredible results. I also saw it. I was fighting right from the second round.
SPEAKER_01: Artyom is saying that he started at the second one. Second one, yeah. Left arm Tobias, right arm Prudnik. Yes, yes. I always wanted to fight. I remember, Engin wrote to you that I wanted to fight at every event. But then, due to certain circumstances and people's interference, I couldn't do it. But now I want to keep my word and fight as often as possible.
SPEAKER_02: Artem was saying that he always wanted to participate in every event and he said that there were some situations where it's not happening or happening, but now he said, I want to participate more often. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, we are growing and hopefully there will be more and more opportunities. But today I checked almost 250 world-level supermatches at the East-West, 18 events, this will be the 18th, and almost near 150 different athletes. And the strongest ones are surviving.
SPEAKER_04: But these are good opportunities, guys, you know, like Armwrestling on Rice, and this stage is the biggest stage. I think that you guys need to really promote yourselves, you know, and because, yes, trash talk is not necessary, but to engagements with the fans and to build your own fan base, I think it's necessary.
SPEAKER_02: I will translate for Artyom real quick. He says that today is his birthday, 4 years ago. He was the first. He says that more than 150 athletes, about 200 professional matches were held. He says that a lot of work has been done, we are growing, becoming bigger and bigger. He says that armwrestling is growing very fast.
SPEAKER_02: I believe that you guys have to promote yourselves, advertise and develop. You say that trash talk is not necessary, but this interaction with your fans, I think he meant social networks and so on, it should be at the level and this should be done. I'm trying.
SPEAKER_01: We have a certain mentality that you can't afford everything, even education. It's hard to create content on social media, for example, on Instagram or YouTube.
SPEAKER_02: what others can afford. Artyom is saying, yeah, as he said, I understand, but there is some mentality and behavior, you know, expectations connected to our countries where we're just a little bit kind of limited with what we're producing on social media and what we're saying. It's absolute, we know. No, no, what I mean is that it doesn't have to be in a certain way.
SPEAKER_04: Atlet can be 100% himself, but just more engagement. People want to know Morozov, not what Morozov would act. You understand? Because nobody's stupid. People understand what is fake, what is real. That's for sure. And I think Morozov as Morozov, Alex Kurdecha as Alex Kurdecha, they should be 100% themselves, but they should show more.
SPEAKER_04: so that people get to know more about them, you know. Yeah. Okay. So, okay. Looks like they both are in great shape and they are ready to fight at the table. And so let's talk about some of the other matches. Alex.
SPEAKER_00: What's going to happen between Levan and Ermes? You talked about this before, but... Yeah, but we can continue. It's so interesting, all the events that we can all the time imagine how it will be when, for example, all of us will be sitting in the venue and watching the show.
SPEAKER_00: You know what I want? You know what I want. I want the beautiful Armwrestling show. I want to stop and from that moment we'll see something. Because Levan is our king. Allen the time he is the strongest. He deserves, well-deserved that point. And Armas now has a very, very, very special match. He now, I see in his eyes, he really believes
SPEAKER_00: and he really did great preparation and he really believed because like previously it was maybe a little bit unexpected to him what happens during the match or previously but now I see he going to crash like he really like going to take Levan's hands and he have a plan and he really confident
SPEAKER_00: So for me, to the fans of Ermes, I really want to see an interesting match and I want to see Ermes stop in any special way, but stop Levan.
SPEAKER_00: and from that moment, whatever happens, I will be happy because I want to see the collision of 100 power versus 100 power guy the strongest two guys in the world and to see how it can be in a different style I want to see the beauty of Ermes and I really believe that can be Levan is still favorite because it's hard to imagine not so many guys stop at him like Devon
SPEAKER_00: Vitaly in 2018 and Ermes was the last guy who was able also to stop and make Levan really, really hard work. So Ermes is a guy. Ermes is a guy and maybe somebody will tell this is a miracle if he stopped him, but I want to believe in that miracle. I want to see that kind of match. Before the podcast,
SPEAKER_04: maybe 45 minutes before podcast and Ermes called me, you know, time to time he calls me and he talks. And then what he did, he's like, my friend, he showed me his arm like this. It's impossible to beat this. It's beautiful. It's beautiful because you see, yes, I like, listen, if you are pulling against Levan, you need to be confident.
SPEAKER_04: You need to be, if you are not confident, I mean, because if you're not confident, you're not going to give your 100%. And we don't even know if anybody's 100% will be ready for level one. But if you are not confident, you're not giving your all, then forget about it. Forget about it. You know, you firstly need to see the winning, like really clear, see in your mind. And after that, like you go in and you do it without any, you know, thoughts, you just go in and do it.
SPEAKER_01: Artem, do you think that Ermes has a chance against Levan? Yes, I think that Ermes has a big chance. But I will root for him, because there are less... I always root for those who are less. Ford those who others don't root for. Everyone roots for Levan. I root for Ermes too.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, it's very easy to root for someone who is already full of strength and is already considered unbeatable. That's why I will root for Ermes. I believe in his victory. I think that... There are a lot of factors. Maybe I'm wrong, but I hope that I'm right. In my first fight...
SPEAKER_01: Ermes was able to stop Levan. Then Levan had a wrist injury. And after this injury he was able to stop Devon in the first round. Of course, Devon is not Ermes, there are different styles, but I think Ermes made conclusions from all this.
SPEAKER_01: Plus, Ermes has become 100% stronger since that moment, I think. His weights during training are not enough for everyone. That's why I give more chances to Ermes. Because he does more specialized exercises for armwrestling.
SPEAKER_01: Free weights, barbells, dumbbells, it's clear, but on blocks, at the table, it's completely different. I tested it on myself and this is my opinion, I think so.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, so Artyom saying that he personally thinks that Ermes have a very good chances and he gonna cheer for Ermes. He said, you know what, it's very easy to cheer for somebody who is stronger and favorite. And this is not the case. He said, I'm cheering for Ermes and not too many people cheering for Ermes where I stick my five cents. And I said, I'm cheering for Ermes too. So, and he believes that Ermes getting stronger
SPEAKER_02: He's lifting better, and he's lifting not only three weights, but working on the blocks. And he said that last time when Levan had the wrist injury, after that injury Devon was able to stop him. So Levan is not making as big progress as Ermes does, and he believes that Ermes has a very good chance, and he believes that he may win.
SPEAKER_02: That's his opinion. And I want to tell you guys one more thing that Ermes already knows that he can't stop him.
SPEAKER_04: Pavlo, this is what you are saying or you are still translating? This is what I am saying. Oh, you are saying, ok. I just added. But I support him. I understood what he said and I support him. So, Artyom is saying he understands what Pavlo says and he said, yeah, I support that too. That he knows already. And I also support Pavlo. Yes, yes. Listen, whenever I said Michael and Ermes are pulling and the winner pulls against
SPEAKER_04: And then Ermes beat Michael. He was not sure. He said, Engin, let me pull him end of the year. And then he just came back. He said, let me pull him. So he was not really sure. So I know, I communicate with him all the time. In the beginning, his confidence was 50%. Now he's very confident. He doesn't say like he will 100% like will win.
SPEAKER_04: But he's going there with nothing in his mind except winning. Yeah, because I have been following him. And today he said he also checked his health. He said everything is very, very good with my health, everything. And then he was extra happy that like he's super healthy and super strong. And I don't know. And the one thing that it confuses me, when I had the podcast with Devon and Ermes,
SPEAKER_04: Levan said that he doesn't do that dumbbell wrist curl anymore. He did dumbbell wrist curl before Devon match, even if it was near to his injury, but now he doesn't do it anymore. You understand? So it doesn't mean that he has problem or something. Maybe he doesn't want to take risks, but we will see. We will see. I think Devon's pronator may be stronger than Ermes'.
SPEAKER_04: But I think Ermes's back pressure is probably stronger than Devon's, than the arm power. And I don't know what would happen if Ermes stops Levan as Devon did on April 20th, 2024. Yeah. We will see. We will see. I want to ask another question to Artem. Artem, you have reached to
SPEAKER_04: You are one of those guys that have the East versus West World title belt, which is the hardest armwrestling award in the history to win. And you have that permanently. How do you see, like, do you have a goal to win that with right arm as well, eventually?
SPEAKER_02: Artem, you are one of those few people who have a belt from VSW and you won it and it is yours forever. What is going on in your head about your right hand? Arsen there any plans to get to the belt with your right hand? Of course there are. I think any person will have such plans.
SPEAKER_02: Yes, we are moving to this step by step, slowly. The main thing is to go. Artem saying that absolutely, he said probably every armwrestler has something like that in his head. And he said, yeah, I am going towards that slowly, but yeah, absolutely. And question, another one. If you beat Alex, is there anyone, what would be your next goal, whatever?
SPEAKER_02: He says, if it happens that you beat Alex, is there someone else you would like to fight with? Or will you just fight with the one I offer you? Or do you still have some ideas and wishes?
SPEAKER_01: No, I... I don't really care who to fight. I'm interested in fighting everyone. Not that I don't care, but I'm interested in fighting everyone who is above me. Yes, I'm interested in taking revenge from someone. I mean, when you lose to someone, you start thinking...
SPEAKER_01: What if I start doing something else for this? And you wonder if it will work the next time or not.
SPEAKER_01: That's why I want to fight everyone. And you look at the fights of other athletes, who are fighting, and you begin to understand what you can do against whom. That's why it's very interesting to fight everyone. Will I be able to fight Michael Todd as effectively as Vitaly or Ermes? Will I be able to fight Levan as effectively?
SPEAKER_01: Like Devon, for example. I'd like to fight with everyone. I'd like to fight with Cvetko, for example. Because I understand that I could fight better that time. But what happened is what happened. I don't regret it. It's my task to train.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, so Artem is saying, first of all, yes, absolutely. I want to pull with everybody. And first he said it doesn't matter. But then he said, No, no, I will correct myself. I want to pull with everybody who is above me. And it's very interesting to try them all. And then he started.
SPEAKER_02: being a little more particular, he said, very interesting if I can be that official with Monster Michael Todd, the same as Vitaly or Ermes. It's very interesting if I can be that efficient with Levan as a Devon Ford, you know, he stopped him. And he said, Tsvetkov, much revenge. Why not? Because it was, it's happened.
SPEAKER_02: whatever happened happened but now I understand the process and maybe I can do better so he said it's uh it's you know it's the it's the process and it's the journey and he want to try them all absolutely do you know what would be good Alex the winner of your match against Morozov I don't know pulling someone higher rank guys
SPEAKER_04: I know that smile on Ergen's face. I don't know, it depends on who is winning Ernest Levan match, but maybe not that level, but maybe, I don't know. If Levan wins, maybe against Ernest. If Ernest wins, maybe against someone like Devon. You know, we was talking about that and with pleasure, you know, Ernest always welcome to Pok, you know it. Uh-huh.
SPEAKER_00: Can you translate it for me? I can help a bit.
SPEAKER_02: Yes, Engend made a sly smile and said, listen, let's make such a trick that the winner of your match, between you and Alex, can tell someone there to fight a little higher. He said, of course, it depends a little on who wins between Levan and Ermes. Ford example, if Levan wins, maybe it would be necessary to fight with Ermes, and if Ermes wins, maybe it would be necessary to fight with Varad.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, and people are asking about Kirill Sarchev, Simaev, and Brian Shaw. I think that, guys, like, as of now, I mean, like, amongst all of them, like, Leonidas was, like, very, very strong guy.
SPEAKER_04: And he is, I think, originally left-handed. And I saw him against unprepared Devon with left arm, you know. And with right arm, I saw him against John. He is probably 50% of his prime. And that is not as easy as you guys are thinking, you know. I talked with Kirill Sarchev. He said he pulled train with Alain Zolaev.
SPEAKER_04: And he was amazed by Alain Zola, who is 80 kilo guy, you understand? So the things are not as easy as you are thinking. These guys may never ever be like top 10. You understand? It is like, it is totally different thing, you know? Then there may be, maybe some of them, one of them may be average top 10, but, but, um,
SPEAKER_00: Realistically, I don't see that, you know. Anyway, so, okay, Michael Taube versus Dizel Elanog. Alex? Ford me, like, if Michael continue, because for me it was very big surprise first round versus Vitaly. Because, like, from my point of view, I was thinking that if Vitaly will won first round, it will be like
SPEAKER_00: flash pin or he goes deeply near to the pad and after that he goes to the triceps press with slow press but in the according to what I remember Michael in the first round was you know keep him in the center I was really surprised about that you know and for me if somebody not with so long forearm and cannot control too much pronation of Michael and when Michael can go outside very very much you know
SPEAKER_00: It's not easy or like with guys who have shorter forearm. If Meranto will be faster and goes maybe immediately like somewhere like Take a center and goes immediately down by the press But for me, I don't know why I don't see this. I don't see I see like Michael will stop Michael
SPEAKER_00: we'll be holding and it's a question how comfortable we'll be for the round because Vitaly was unexpectedly comfortable with flop press like previously I was not thinking that he can be so good versus Michael I think if Michael stop it will be goes slowly slowly to the Michael side Alex, I want to ask you something in between if you would just pause the match on round one just starts
SPEAKER_04: And then, but you never seen the match. And we will tell you this is three seconds after the match started. If I would ask you what would be the score, you would just say that Michael 3-0 for Michael. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: So it was unexpected from the beginning to the end, honestly. Like, very unexpected. I was not expecting that Vitaly can press so good. And I was not expecting that Michael in the first round can control him in the center. It was a really beautiful match. Yeah, yeah. And your countryman, Artyom. The runner for Michael, yeah?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, well, I think Michael will be the favorite here. Because of his endurance, because of his uncomfortable technique. Because it's enough to just come up to him and shake his hand, take his right hand and realize that it's some kind of wooden thing. Uncomfortable. Uncomfortable, yes. And it doesn't spin, it doesn't bend anywhere.
SPEAKER_01: Therefore, it will be difficult for Dzeranov. But I will still root for him, because he is my compatriot and we will fly together. We will be together in the USA. We will support each other as much as we can. We will help each other. I hope that Georgii's training process was not only aimed at the development of strength, but also at the development of endurance.
SPEAKER_01: Sometimes Dzeranov's endurance is very good. When we fought with him on the right hand, he held it very well with his forehand. Sometimes, as you can see, he also leads. We'll see. I'm curious to see this fight. During the fight, the one who is faster at the table will decide. We know that Michael Todd can
SPEAKER_02: So Artyom is saying that yes, Michael Todd is probably favorite in this match, but he will cheer for his countryman because he is his countryman. And he said, you know, it's very interesting match for me because
SPEAKER_02: it's uh... very much depends on that there are no saw shape because we saw that all fall was in very good shape and very good endurance sometimes this was not as good and he's uh... jones saying that he was pulling him and uh... he is very good cooler and sometimes his endurance is on a very good level he also said that uh... the match may be depending on how fast uh... both opponents can uh... transition on the table we all know that michael transitioning is
SPEAKER_02: amazing and he can move on the table really fast and if Dzeranov will be adjusting fast enough then he have a better chances and it depends on the preparation he said that's that's that's the answer okay okay so Pauline versus Arsen Khachatryan um Artyom you know Arsen Khachatryan?
SPEAKER_01: Yes, yes, yes, I know. He is going to pull against Paul Lee. How do you see this match? Paul Lee is very strong, very viscous. But I think that speed will be on the side of Arsen. And I think his top is stronger than Paul Lee's wrist.
SPEAKER_01: It's also a very interesting fight. It's difficult. It's difficult. I didn't follow both fighters. When I'm at the event, I watch Paul Alina's fights. I've seen Arsen Khachatryan a couple of times on the Internet. When he uploads a video, I watch it. But they didn't have any common rivals.
SPEAKER_01: to evaluate it somehow. Therefore, it will be very interesting. Artem Yatsenko.
SPEAKER_02: Artem saying that this is very interesting match and he said that you know to be honest I'm not following following the guys like I'm not watching them every day but I've been watching Pauline a lot at the old events and he said I saw quite a few videos of Arsen and he's thinking that Arsen even if even that Pauline is very strong and probably stronger than Arsen but he thinks that Arsen's top role
SPEAKER_02: will be stronger than Pauline's wrist and he may pull a win through that so he's a kind of slight favorite in Artyom's opinion but he also said it's it's very hard to predict it's very hard to predict he said it's very good match I want to see it Alex you know why you already said before for me Pauline
SPEAKER_00: now level like very clear because like his match with Rastam give me some answers about how endurable he is, how strong he is, how he good inside so like an inside game and you know for me Rastam is also very very special. I understand that it can be the question about the wrist and can be also about the start position
SPEAKER_00: can also be like who will be transition in the best point to put the power. But for me, in my mind, I feel like it will be Paul. Paul, I want to ask your opinion about Ermes and Levan.
SPEAKER_02: Last time I've been there when they pulled. I've been literally three meters from the table. I've been there in Dubai. I've been pulling Badulescu there. So it was one of the most amazing matches I saw in my life. And I'm cheering for Ermes. Ermes is my little baby. I love Levan. I still think Levan is favorite in this match.
SPEAKER_02: because it would be stupid not to think that way, but I believe that Ermes today is one and only who can do this. He knows that he can do it. You know what I mean? He knows that. And he knows... As of today, he probably has the biggest chance. Yes, because he knew how it's done already. He did it already, and he
SPEAKER_02: narrow his preparation to that niche.
SPEAKER_02: and he's been working on that particular stuff, and he knows what needs to be done. I believe, in my opinion, I'm not sure, I'm following Levan for sure, but in my opinion, there is not much room for Levan to progress anymore. He's probably keeping his form at a certain level, but I don't think that his power and
SPEAKER_04: and overall performance is progressing much. But Ermes, I believe he's 10% better or maybe even 15% from the previous match. And that may make a big difference. So you are one of those guys that believe that Ermes progressed more than Levan since last time? Yes. Okay, okay, okay. But you are saying that Levan is favorite because
SPEAKER_04: No matter what we talk, it's not proven. Our opinions are not proven. It's only opinion. So if we go by what is proven, we need to go with Levan. But with the opinions, things may have changed.
SPEAKER_02: Well, yeah, only stupid people don't change their minds and their opinions, right? But I believe that Levan did some homework too, because he's already been in a situation where he was out of, you know, breath. And I believe that he made some adjustments preparing for this match too. Not only power, but endurance and everything else. We will see it.
SPEAKER_04: Last time Ermes was going to that match, he was like, Engin, if I stop him one round or if I win one round, you know, that was his mindset. So now it's totally different, you know. Yeah, he, he, he, I, I, yeah. And I believe. Okay. And, and Alex and Devon? Ah, okay. Devon is extremely serious opinion. Alex is slight favorite. Uh,
SPEAKER_02: because Alex will be very comfortable with Devon's hand length and size because they're similar in length, Alex is a little longer and that power of Alex is probably double of what Devon has abilities of Thrashtalk I believe does not have that much effect on Alex so I believe Alex is favorite I will tell you something I will tell you something amongst all other matches
SPEAKER_04: that left arm Alex had, and also right arm he had. I think that these are like one of the best matches stylistically for Alex. With left arm, you know, he's more sideways, but with right arm, he's top-roll specialist. He's just all about taking the risk. He may not be that well-rounded as left arm, but about taking the risk with right arm is with left arm,
SPEAKER_04: I mean, he pulled against Morozov, he pulled against Dadikian, and Dadikian is also very weirdly strong, you know, with the hand and wrist, while now, like, Alex doesn't even have to do anything, but just being built like he is, is already a disadvantage for Devon, because Devon always uses that, you know, height.
SPEAKER_04: And now just Devon doesn't have that advantage. He already lost, right? No, no, I don't say he already lost. I'm just saying he doesn't have that advantage. Yes. And now he's attacking on Alex's hand and wrist. And yeah, and then the height is there. Shoulder press is there. Like Devon really needs to be very, very, very strong. He needs to be very strong. If he's very, very strong, he can stop Alex.
SPEAKER_04: But is Alex the same guy? He said he is not. I believe him. Yesterday I had Manuel Batalha and Wagner Bortalato as my guests. He said that one month ago he was in somewhere that Alex was. He said that his wrist, Alex's wrist is just unbelievable, you know. And we will see. His wrist is unbelievable and Devon's pronator is unbelievable. And Devon is not the same guy that, hey, this is party hand guy. He's really training.
SPEAKER_02: So it is very, very interesting match, very, very interesting. Very interesting. I want to see it because I know both guys and, you know, I pulled Devon before. I know approximately, you know, what he's capable of and what he's going to do. And I believe it's not that easy to do this to Alex because, you know,
SPEAKER_02: Pronator, yes, very good. But to properly apply your pronator, you need to add cupping for Alex's size of the hand. And you need to be able to go over the fingers. And if Alex's fingers are here, you know, go pronate. It's, you know, we'll see. Neither of these guys are, you know, like beginners. They both are, they both know what they are doing.
SPEAKER_04: Of course, Devon is more experienced, but we will see. We will see how it will go. We will see. Artyom, do you have... I promised Pavlo that I would go one hour. So it is exactly one hour before we finish it. Artyom, do you have any last words? Would you like to tell anything to Alex? Like, as we talk privately, when we talk privately, you tell me you're going to beat the shit out of him now. You say that you don't do the trash talk.
SPEAKER_02: Can you explain to that difference? I'm just joking, Alex.
SPEAKER_02: And he says, do you want to say something else? Do you want to say something to Alex? Because he says, I remember when you called me and there were only two of us, and you said that you would just destroy him right away and that's it. Well, then he says, of course, I joked, you never said that, but is there something you want to say? Well, in fact, this is exactly the mood, I want to go out and win.
SPEAKER_01: Alex wants to go out and win as well. Who will be the lucky one on that day? It's not about luck, it's about who is given the chance. Who is stronger will win. We both want to win. I wish Alex good luck. I wish him to fly, come back and recover.
SPEAKER_01: I don't want her to get hurt. I don't want her to worry about anything. I don't want her to get hurt. I don't want her to get hurt. I don't want her to get hurt. I don't want her to get hurt. I don't want her to get hurt. I don't want her to get hurt. I don't want her to get hurt. I don't want her to get hurt. I don't want her to get hurt. I don't want her to get hurt. I don't want her to get hurt. I don't want her to get hurt. I don't want her to get hurt. I don't want her to get hurt. I don't want her to get hurt. I don't want her to get hurt. I don't want her to get hurt. I don't want her to get hurt. I don't want her to get hurt. I don't want her to get hurt. I don't want her to get hurt. I don't want her to get hurt. I don't want her to get
SPEAKER_02: Okay, so Artem is saying that, yeah, there is not much to say. I just want to say good luck to Alex. And he said that whoever is ready better or better man that day will win. And, you know, good luck, safe flights. And, you know, we will have, we will see on the table. That's it. It translated him what I said, right?
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I did, I did, I did, I did. Yeah, yeah, there is one super chat before I ask Alex his last words. Sports giants high hanging on July 19. Kirsten will have a rematch against Bozidar. What's your opinion about this match? Also, will we ever see Kirsten on East vs West? My friend, Kirsten, East vs West stage, he came to the
SPEAKER_04: qualification event, I think he was out of top five during the qualification event but once he wins the qualifications, yes for sure he will be invited for sure he's leveling but I think he needs a little bit more time and Alex any last words? so yeah before last words one guy from Canada
SPEAKER_00: very very asked me to ask Artyom about did Dennis send the hammer to him because he said that he don't know where's the hammer he cannot sleep normally and he asked to ask Artem did hammer in his place or somewhere else Pavlo help with this your friend from Canada doesn't have any contact with Artyom
SPEAKER_04: No, not much. Is he black? No, he's not black, but he was saying that he writes too much to Venice and doesn't have a response. So he's using you as a vehicle? He asked about... Yeah, just say your last words, my friend, and then Alex. Okay, so...
SPEAKER_00: About awards, so for this event I wish Artem, the same like everyone, to be in a good health, in a good mood, before the match and after. I'm sure we will do the best, both, like Artem said and I said, both of us will do our best to show the interest in our wrestling.
SPEAKER_00: I'm sure it's not the last time like he said he wants to go every time to every event and we have a big goal so both of us have the big goals and all the time we will see each other in these events. And Pavlo do you have any last words? Yes. I will say Russian because those words are for them. They both understand Russian.
SPEAKER_02: When you two fight, you will come to my gym and I will torture you here. Behind this table. I'm only on the right. On the right, okay. Guys, thank you very very much and I wish you guys the best in Chicago and let the stronger one win.
SPEAKER_01: And thanks to everyone who has been watching us. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Allen the best.
