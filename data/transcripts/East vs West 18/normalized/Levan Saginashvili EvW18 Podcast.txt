SPEAKER_03: We are here with Levan Levan Saginashvili and Tornike, the god, god of the translators. Georgii-English translation, yeah. Hi, everyone. So, how are you guys? Good, good. Good? Perfect. Good, that's good, that's good, yeah. Good to see you guys, yeah. So, how is everything going, Levan?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, everything is really good. Actually, it's really perfect. Perfect, yeah. So, he's ready to fight. Levan, can you go a little bit like with the help of your head? But it's okay, I think, yeah. So, Levan...
SPEAKER_03: I want to start, you know that we are doing this podcast mostly, you know, about your upcoming match against Ermes Gasparini. And you share a video and it's very, very heavy. Was it 180 kilos? Yes. 180 kilos. And Ermes thought that it doesn't, like, it's not that impressive. It doesn't translate to table.
SPEAKER_03: What was your response to this? Very funny, very funny. You said it's very funny? Yeah. Even if Ermes is born nine times in a row, he still can't live any way similar to that.
SPEAKER_03: Hmm. Okay. Okay. Okay. So, so basically you are saying that Ermes is jealous? Yeah, of course he got scared. He had to say something and in the end he just said, said something silly. Do you think that, do you think that Ermes got scared more about the 180 kilo lift or
SPEAKER_01: that screaming after that? No, I don't think so. But I think it's true. I think it's true. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so.
SPEAKER_01: In my opinion, the people who were with me at that time knew that it was not possible to have a very serious fight normally. I don't know how long it took them to get to that point, but I think it was possible. And in the end, I think I lost two kilos.
SPEAKER_02: Well, Ermes was scared before that and for a long time and he's even more scared at the moment. I think that when he saw how the weight went up into the air and how it was static and held in the middle, I think he understood that there's just no chance.
SPEAKER_02: We have to understand that this is not the limit for me. I can go higher. I can go even to 200. At the moment, at that specific training, my back was quite sore and I had long training sessions before. So I think on the fresh, I can lift quite a bit more. Elvis is thinking that his 90 kilo, 92 kilo back pressure is more specific and
SPEAKER_01: translates to table and he thinks that it is more impressive than Levan's hundred 80 kg lifts. What's Levan's opinion about this? Yes, I think it's a good question. I think it's a good question. I think it's a good question. I think it's a good question.
SPEAKER_02: Well, let's first specify what Ermes calls back pressure. Does he mean lifting with the wrist straight or the wrist supinated? What does he call his own back pressure?
SPEAKER_03: Or what do you call the back pressure angle? I mean, yeah, it's a little bit this way, a little bit this way. Not a little bit, not a little bit.
SPEAKER_03: Brachioradialis is a little bit bicep, not like totally bicep. It is biceps. The way he does it, that's not a back pressure. It's a biceps. Okay. So you are not impressed by that?
SPEAKER_01: It's been a while since I've been here. It's been a while since I've been here. It's been a while since I've been here. It's been a while since I've been here. It's been a while since I've been here. It's been a while since I've been here. It's been a while since I've been here.
SPEAKER_01: If you put pressure on the back of the head, the machine will go to the head and not to the biceps. It will go to the head and not to the biceps. It will go to the head and not to the biceps. It will go to the head and not to the biceps.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, we have to define the range of motion during a movement. Whenever he uses like a three centimeter movements, that's not impressive to me. And if he calls the training back pressure and he does it with a bent and supinated wrist,
SPEAKER_02: and just across his body that's not an impressive lift at all i don't think that helps him and if he did if he does think that way yeah let him train this way and he will see the results of that oh yeah yeah he is also saying the same thing you know he says that like leon doesn't know how to train and now uh leon is saying that they are he will see the result it means that
SPEAKER_02: Ermes doesn't know how to train. Levan also mentioned that he tried the similar way that Ermes does this movement in the gym. He managed to lift really high weights, but he doesn't think that this is a back pressure. This is a different bicep movement, irrelevant. Whenever Levan says that he tried this, the next thing Ermes is going to do, Ermes is going to ask, show me. Oh.
SPEAKER_01: Of course, no problem. I don't have a problem with that. I don't have a problem with that. I don't have a problem with that. I don't have a problem with that. I don't have a problem with that.
SPEAKER_01: I'm not saying that you should be afraid of the fact that you weigh 93 kilos or 20 kilos. I'm not saying that you should be afraid of the fact that you weigh 93 kilos or 20 kilos. I'm not saying that you should be afraid of the fact that you weigh 93 kilos or 20 kilos. I'm not saying that you should be afraid of the fact that you weigh 93 kilos or 20 kilos. I'm not saying that you should be afraid of the fact that you weigh 93 kilos or 20 kilos. I'm not saying that you should be afraid of the fact that you weigh 93 kilos or 20 kilos.
SPEAKER_01: No matter what it is, they're going to be the same man.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I don't think this is a very useful exercise. I can show him how it should be done on the 21st. No trouble with that. And if he claims to about showing anything, I think he should show the weights he's lifting first of all. He's claiming 93, but we have no idea what the weight there is. And I don't think nobody takes the risk this way. You have to do the other way with it.
SPEAKER_03: With a straight weight. So yeah, that movement is useless for him. Levan, do you really believe that this is totally like this? Of course, I'm not lying. Maybe like this, but you are showing totally split. I need to watch again, but... Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, like that, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: You can take the wrist with that movement. So you cannot consider it as a back pressure.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, you can't take the risk this way, and maybe it's helpful in a defensive position to hold the opponent, but you can't consider that to be a back pressure.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, but in Georgii, we call it Shua Biceps. It's not a bent leg, it's a leg, and the movement is like this. It's called Shua Biceps.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, when you supinate the wrist halfway, in Georgii, we usually call this movement middle bicep. It's not back pressure. This is just the bicep exercise. Okay, that is a super chat. Engin, why did you guys stop the rankings update on official eSports website on internet? I think the regular update on the website will be better for the sport. Take UFC website as a good example. You are absolutely right, my friends.
SPEAKER_03: Like very soon, hopefully we will update, but you are right. You're 100% right here. Anmo. Okay. He says, come on Levan, be real. Ermes progressed more than you. There is a super chat. I'm not saying that. Devon't get angry with me. The guy says that he says to you that you be real.
SPEAKER_03: and faced with the reality that since the last time, Ermes progressed more than you progressed. This is what the guy is saying. OK. He says OK. OK, OK. So he is not taking you seriously. GB19 Levan, are you 191 or 193? You say 192.
SPEAKER_03: No, no, your height. I don't know. 192 or 192. Okay. Okay. So, okay. I don't want to, okay. There is something that someone reminded me today that when I had Ermes on the podcast, he used some words.
SPEAKER_03: against you, but I didn't even realize during the podcast. I didn't realize. But today, only today, someone reminded me that you really didn't like what he said. And is that the case? Well, I'm happy to be here. I'm happy to be here. I'm happy to be here. I'm happy to be here. I'm happy to be here.
SPEAKER_03: Uh, last time somebody dared, uh, to say that word to me, uh, the next day he was, his arm was in a sling and, uh, I think Ermes will have the same fate. Okay. So last time when Devon said that you tore his bicep and now you are saying that now Ermes used that word and then you're going to make him, uh, make him cry. You will make him cry. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: You will teach him how to behave, huh? Well, I don't know if I can say that. No, you can say it on the web. It's not a big deal. Well, let's say that... Let's say that Devon Maromogu left the stage at 4 o'clock in the morning and went to bed. Now, he doesn't go to bed at 4 o'clock in the morning.
SPEAKER_02: Well, I'm not his teacher. He's a big boy now. But I remember when he had a match with Devon after 4-0, he ran from the scene crying. I wonder why did he run away when it was 4-0? Where were the rest of the two rounds?
SPEAKER_01: Oh, when Devon and Ermes pull and Ermes didn't pull the rest of the rounds is what he means? Yep. Oh, okay. Okay. So now we can all understand who is the pussy here.
SPEAKER_02: In my case, I was victorious at 4-0. I was the one who won. But in Ermes' case, he was losing and he ran away. I don't think that's a good behavior. Okay. So he's saying that he was beating Ermes 4-0, he secured everything. So he had no reason to continue while
SPEAKER_01: Ermes was losing and he could just try to win at least one round against Devon. This is what he's saying. Yes, exactly. Yeah, at 4-0, Ermes vanished and nobody knew where he was. The Italian fans were coming to me asking where's Ermes, but he was nowhere to be seen.
SPEAKER_03: Then somebody told me that he was locked away in the room crying. Okay. Let's see. You guys will have a podcast together as well, and then you guys can talk about that. But I remember one thing. I don't know if I should mention or not.
SPEAKER_03: When Devon was provoking Levan that Ermes, in fact, could have beaten him if it was running foul on round three, and when Levan said that he was overweight, he was 190 kilos, and he wasn't well prepared, it was just before Devon versus Levan match. And when Ermes just went and made it,
SPEAKER_03: video about Levan, but he said, he said, stop being a crybaby. You know, I beat you one round or something. I don't know if Levan remembers or not. Do you remember you called me on the phone, Levan? Yeah, there was something. There was something, yeah. There wasn't something, there was something big, you know. There was something big that, you know, Levan called me and Levan asked me,
SPEAKER_03: when his Ermes arriving to Istanbul, he was breathing fire, you know, on the phone. Levan was just like, and then I calm him down and then they made peace in Istanbul and as it should be. But yeah, Levan, for sure. I never see you that angry, Levan, never, never. On that phone call, I will never forget, you know, that when you call me.
SPEAKER_03: and I had to calm down, you know. Dino says, yeah, blobs stay hydrated for Chicago, Ermes comes. I don't know if maybe that's a disrespectful comment. DB Talk says, can Levan beat a gorilla in a world title match? I am the gorilla.
SPEAKER_03: Edward Prokopcik says, do people not realize that 92 kilo with one arm is slightly more than half of 180 kilo? If left was as strong, that is 184 kilo total, but matches one arm. I don't, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Can you ask Lewand if he thinks he is the strongest armwrestler ever lived on both arms? If he doesn't, which one he thinks is the strongest in both arms?
SPEAKER_01: I don't know, it doesn't have to be someone strongest with the both arms, but I can ask, do you think that you are the strongest arm master ever lived with right and left? Well, I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so.
SPEAKER_02: It wouldn't be right for myself to say that. If the fans think that way, sure, but yeah, all right. I'll be the strongest. Davide Pistarro, Levan, what body weight would you reach for the match?
SPEAKER_01: No, there is no such thing as a problem. There is no such thing as a problem. There is no such thing as a problem. There is no such thing as a problem.
SPEAKER_02: I'm going to be around 174, 175. I'm already close to that weight. I don't have any issues with that. I'm feeling really good. And it doesn't matter, actually, but probably I will be around 175. Levan, we Georgii see Ermes mocking you, belly oxygen jokes. How bad will you make him pay?
SPEAKER_02: 6-0. Also, why is he on shutout stake with no bets?
SPEAKER_01: I want to thank you all. I want to thank you all. I want to thank you all. I want to thank you all. I want to thank you all. I want to thank you all. I want to thank you all. I want to thank you all. I want to thank you all.
SPEAKER_02: His jokes are no matter to me. I love my oxygen. I have the tank with me all the time. And for Ermes, I'll just teach him a lesson and just send him back. Actually, now it won't be a lesson. It will be just a diploma in destruction.
SPEAKER_03: He will graduate that evening and it will be done. Okay. Armutan says, have you tried back pressure lift for this preparation, like for Ermes match? Back pressure is a little bit difficult, I don't know if it's because of the variation. Well, Ermes' back pressure is a little bit difficult. It's a lot of back pressure.
SPEAKER_02: Of course I trained my back pressure and the proper one and not the Ermes back pressure, which is the useless one. I already see how his baby wrists will just crack, crack in the middle and will be useless, useless and weak. Hmm.
SPEAKER_03: Ryan Adonis says, hello, Levan. Can we arm wrestle in Chicago? If you're Ermes, yes, sure, but not the other way. Falz says, big shout out to Levan. Massive fan. Love to Engin. And he's for Swiss. Hope.
SPEAKER_03: My friend, nobody is banned. We sometimes choose different people. People are just crying for every single thing. People are telling me, oh, why you don't invite Ryan? You invite Ryan, why you don't invite the other one? I can invite everyone at the same time. So just stop the drama and focus on the arm wrestling, beautiful arm wrestling that we are providing and just enjoy it.
SPEAKER_03: Animo, Ermes never loses to a person twice. Be careful, Levan. Interesting insight. Okay, okay. So, Levan.
SPEAKER_03: So you are going to Chicago, you are saying you're going to destroy Ermes? I'm not your regular human. Those stats don't work on me. Oh, okay, okay. So him not to lose the same guy twice, it doesn't apply on Levan? Yes. Okay, okay. So, Levan, like,
SPEAKER_03: Very often, Ermes reach out to me and he says, Engin, I'm going to beat that guy. You understand? He told me at the beginning, he was like, I hope it will be as hard as the last time. But more days are passing, more he's confident. And he's saying that, like, he's going to beat you. And this is not like he's only saying on the social media. He's telling me privately that he's going to beat you. What do you think about this?
SPEAKER_01: I would like to start by saying that I have a special relationship with Napoleon. When I was a child, Napoleon was always with me. He was always there for me. He was always there for me, just like Napoleon was always there for me. He was always there for me.
SPEAKER_02: I used to live with one neighbor in my previous living place in Vorkiteli. He was sure that he was Napoleon. Oh. Yeah, every time I would meet him, he would say, I'm Napoleon. And you could never say otherwise or make him believe otherwise. So I think we are seeing a very similar case here. Okay. Levan is saying that
SPEAKER_01: Let Ermes dream, but let...
SPEAKER_01: He may be saying those things, but he never believes them.
SPEAKER_01: One, two, three, four, it's up to you to decide. If you decide, first of all, that you want to do it, and second, that you want to do it, then it's up to you to decide.
SPEAKER_02: Ermes doesn't have any chance, either with me or with Devon. So I'm really struggling to find hope for Ermes fans to say something positive. But it's going to be a really quick match. After 4-0, he will run away. Irocli will catch him, get him back. We will do the last two rounds. But it's still going to be a quick one.
SPEAKER_01: So Iraq is going to go run after him.
SPEAKER_01: Actually, thinking about it, after 5-0, what if I give one round to him? Imagine how happy Ermes will be. He will be a happiest man on earth.
SPEAKER_02: Considering how it went the last time, actually, I'm going to give him this chance. I would be proud to make a human that happy in his life, and I would gladly do that. I will think about it. Okay, after 5-0, he's going to give you the last round? Maybe, maybe. I'll think about it.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe during the evening, if I get inspired to make a human being this happy,
SPEAKER_01: Maybe I will do that. Levan, sorry for cutting you. Levan, Ermes is calling. Can I answer? Oh, okay. Yeah, sure. Oh, he's crying. He is.
SPEAKER_03: Ermes, he says that you are scared of him. You have no chance, but just to make you happy, he's going to give you one round. Happiest man on earth. He's already so happy. Look at him. Ermes, we don't see you. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Is it enough? I have a bigger muscle in my finger. You see, my friend, or not? Ermes, he says that your lips is more like bicep with the wrist like this. He said it's not back pressure. You cannot topple someone like this.
SPEAKER_03: Devon't cry, don't cry. He tells you not to cry. Also, he says that after it is 5-0, he's beating you, last round he's going to give you so you will be happy.
SPEAKER_03: Maybe, maybe, maybe. He will be opposite, my friend. I will give him two rounds. Listen, he has even worse news for you. He says that after 4-0, you will try to escape. You will try to run away. And he says Iraq will run and catch you.
SPEAKER_03: And Irakli will bring you to the table. Irakli need to think only to put his mask. Only this. He need to think only to put his mask. Listen, we don't see you. Yeah. He need only to put the mask on his face. Oh, my God, Ermes. Ermes, but listen, listen. Look at, look at, look at what... Look at my face.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, you enjoy your food, but Levan is like being really hard on you. You will watch later. You will see. See? Okay, okay. Okay. He's very strong right now? Okay.
SPEAKER_03: He doesn't understand what will happen to him. Super serious. Okay, Ermes, you enjoy your food and talk to you later. Eat pizza, eat pizza. Levan, basically, Ermes is saying that Iraqis should only focus putting masks on you.
SPEAKER_03: He said that this is his only job. Actually, can I participate in a match with a mask at the table? Oh, it would give you an advantage with the extra oxygen. Okay. Can you ask Levan if he is planning on doing wide grip curl world records like he did with the 180 kg cheat curl?
SPEAKER_02: There's not much motivation in there, not much money. And is saying, can this Ermes beat Devon best form in the future? I don't think so.
SPEAKER_01: Physically, I don't think he will be able to beat Devon. Psychologically, I don't think he will be able to beat Devon. In strength, physically, he might get to that level, but psychologically, he will never be able to beat Devon. So, he's saying that he's not mentally strong to beat Devon? Well, I don't know.
SPEAKER_02: Maybe if we surgically block his tear ducts in the eyes and he's not able to cry, maybe that way something, but he's going to cry anyway, so there's no chance. Wow. He's very hard on Ermes.
SPEAKER_03: SportsGiant says, love what you are doing in England. What are your thoughts about Kirsten? He did an impressive three-minute match at the qualifier. Kirsten did great at the qualification event, but the match right before that one against the Russian pool, he was very, very good. So he was very impressive, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: And then Faz says, Engin, you are looking bigger. Let's get the flex. How is training going? Is the Minda fight on? Minda, guys, looks like I can go down to 85 kilos. 77, I need to lose 15 kilos. I mean, and looks like if I beat Minda, it sounds like, you know, he's going to cry. He was heavier, so better not pull him. Before he was saying he would beat me, even if I'm 95 kilos. Now he's saying,
SPEAKER_03: I mean, yeah, you are 85 kilos, so better not pull. And maybe someday I go down to 77 and we may pull. Yeah, I'm just checking if there is another support chat. Okay. Arnold90 says, Kamil tried to lift 138 kg bicep curl from table and could not budge the weight even one millimeter. That puts some perspective on how insane 138
SPEAKER_03: He's going to tear something. He's experimenting too much. Yeah, he needs to be careful, especially with the side pressure. It's not that good for the elbow joint. Michael workspace, Levan, you are my favorite.
SPEAKER_03: I hope to take a picture with you in Chicago. Of course, of course. No problem. And then one more, Peter Ankor. How does Levan recommend we can progress in bicep curl? Is there any suggestion that Levan has about how to improve about bicep curl? Bicep curl, she progresses.
SPEAKER_01: We have to curl.
SPEAKER_02: If you want to progress in a bicep curl or whatever lift you want to get strong in, I would recommend to do the movement at least twice a week and then next week just once per week to take a lighter week and then again twice. No matter if this is a bicep curl or any other, you have to focus on that movement and progress that way.
SPEAKER_03: I'm like a bodybuilder now, should I maybe take part in a show? You look great, seriously. It was even more impressive to see those arms after training pumped very closely.
SPEAKER_03: Levan, what do you think about Todd Hutchings calling Irakli a crybaby because Irakli is complaining about the elbow fouls and Irakli thinks that third match is necessary while a lot of people think that it's not necessary. What's your take on this subject?
SPEAKER_01: Well, I don't know. I don't know how to describe it in a simple way.
SPEAKER_01: As you know, on the day of the wedding, the bride and groom will be in the wedding room. The bride and groom will be in the wedding room. The bride and groom will be in the wedding room. The bride and groom will be in the wedding room. The bride and groom will be in the wedding room. The groom will be in the wedding room.
SPEAKER_02: The way the last match went between Todd and Irakli, I'm not considering that to be a win for Todd. That match was just gifted to him by the referees. And in his place, I wouldn't even talk about it because he has just to hide and dig a hole in the ground and just hide in there. Maybe the hole that Matt Mask has dug in the ground.
SPEAKER_01: He can't do that, because the way it went, he has nothing to complain about. It was just a gift. Yes, it was a gift, and then he went to Iraq. He knew that he was going to go to America, and he knew that he was going to go to America.
SPEAKER_01: However, we have to understand that what was in the past is not going to happen. It's not going to happen, and it doesn't mean anything. What is going to happen is normal. What is going to happen is not going to happen, and what is going to happen is not going to happen. This is what we have to deal with and what we have to deal with and what we have to deal with.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, Todd really only has to be quiet here. He has nothing to say, nothing to complain about. And just recently we learned that Todd doesn't want to pull outside the US. No problem. Iraq will come to the US. They will pull and the match will go according to the rules. If it doesn't, then it becomes a different topic.
SPEAKER_02: But with the proper refereeing, he will get destroyed. And if he still wants to cheat, I might hang him up on the Freedom Square here in Tbilisi. I mean, it is not exactly that Todd doesn't want to pull outside of the US, but Todd pulled in November.
SPEAKER_03: he pulled in Istanbul against Kanayi and then next he pulled in Georgii against Irakli and then lately he also pulled Rustam overseas and he's saying that it would be better if he also pulls
SPEAKER_01: this side of the world without traveling this side. But about that... There is no champion without a champion. There is no champion without a champion. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. There is no champion without a champion. There is no champion without a champion.
SPEAKER_01: He could have won and won a round. He could have won four rounds. He could have won six rounds. He could have won six rounds. He could have won six rounds.
SPEAKER_02: I don't consider him to be champion. I don't really care what he considers his next match to be. I don't think he deserves that belt that he's got. I understand that there might be a mistake in the one round. I think it's because of the light, Levan. Because it was too dark.
SPEAKER_03: You understand? There was a mistake. I understand. But I don't believe that they do it intentionally. Listen, when there is a mistake happen against the North American, they go, oh, these referees are against the North Americans. And if it happens against the Georgii, they think that, oh, it's just, I don't understand. Mistake happens. Mistake happens.
SPEAKER_01: If there were any problems, we would be able to solve them. But we have to understand that if we don't solve them, they will be solved. If we don't solve them, they will be solved. If we don't solve them, they will be solved.
SPEAKER_01: If Irakli were to win, it would be a shame if he didn't win. It doesn't matter if he is a Georgii or an American. If he was to win, it would be a shame. That's why my opinion is that if a champion doesn't win, it's not a good story and it's not his story. That's my position.
SPEAKER_02: But all four rounds were done with a lifted elbow. And I don't know if those were the lights or any other reasons. The referees are not blind, right? And I don't think this can be considered a victory, especially for the champion.
SPEAKER_02: I'm not saying this because it was Todd or Irakli, I don't care about that. They should have a proper match with the proper rules and refereeing and whoever wins is the champion. I don't think that I wouldn't be happy for Irakli to win in a cheating way or any other way. Let the best men win and then we can decide who is the champion.
SPEAKER_01: and he said that he didn't want to, but he wanted to do it. So he went to Kaspar and said, come on, let's do it together, because this is what I want to do. And that's it. It's not like he said, come on, let's do it together, because that's what he said.
SPEAKER_02: Even if I have won that way and referees couldn't see that, after the match, if I have seen on the video that all my victories were not true and done with a lifted elbow, I would just call Ermes and say, hey, let's cancel this result and let's have a rematch. Let's have a proper match. And that would be the only right thing to do.
SPEAKER_02: Now Todd is complaining and saying that he's basically behaving incorrectly here, saying that Irakli is being a crybaby. We are just fighting for a fair match.
SPEAKER_03: and only after a fair match we can have the results. You might have mistaken one round, maybe two, but all four, that's just ridiculous. Yes, some of them were minor, some of them were really big, yes. But Todd accepts the match. Todd is going to pull and so that's the only thing I can do.
SPEAKER_01: Irakli asked me… No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
SPEAKER_01: In general, pro-meta is the best and pro-Kopasukh is the best. I think that's the most important thing, because we are the best in this sport and the 6th round is our best and pro-meta is the best.
SPEAKER_02: Of course, I'm not blaming Engin in any way. We were watching the match from below. And from there, we couldn't see anything in much detail. So there's no blaming here. This is just for the fair refereeing.
SPEAKER_02: and for the fight to be judged in a fair manner. Because for the armwrestler, those six rounds are their life. This is just the work of our whole life. And we have to be extra attentive in terms of refereeing, how it is done. I can understand the human error, but it shouldn't be systematic and we have to fight for the match to be fair.
SPEAKER_03: I mean, the only thing that, you know, like I also have problem is that when the mistake is happening to one side and then they call the other side crying and then when the opposite is happening and then they just attack like crazy. And so that is what I'm saying. And some people need to understand that there is nothing like Eastern athletes or Eastern referee. I mean, you're talking about Georgii, you're talking about Russia.
SPEAKER_03: I mean, a Georgii feels closer to an American than feeling to the Russian. I don't want to go into politics. The same with Ukraine, you understand? So just because these athletes are from East, it doesn't mean that they are like one whole thing. A Croatian or German referee is reffing a Kazakh or Russian or Georgii match. It has nothing to do with each other. Talking about two different countries, all these athletes, they have competed in WAF,
SPEAKER_03: against each other more than they competed against American or Canadian. So there is nothing like a German ref to ref a Russian match. I mean, there is no feeling close or anything. So people need to stop that illusion.
SPEAKER_03: So, there are some superchats. GB19 says that, Levan, will you pull Vitaly if he loses to Devon? But before that, I want to ask, do you support Devon and Laleddin to pull against each other? Yes. Yes, yes.
SPEAKER_01: And we found out that it was Larratt. I mean, Larratt was the only one, and Gasparini was the only one in the group. Despite the fact that there was a lot of debate, there was no doubt in the ratings that Larratt was going to win the competition after a few rounds. It was clear that neither of them was going to win, neither of them was going to lose.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, definitely. I support this match and I have told this to Engin as well. He has to pull Devon. If I was pulling Devon, then at least Ermias. Because with all due respect to Michael, he's not in the best shape at the moment. And I think that the Latin has definitely best to go through at least number two or number three ranked athlete.
SPEAKER_01: to get to the chance to pull me. So, yeah, I fully agree that this match should happen. If Ermes wants to win, he can do it. If he doesn't want to win, he can do it by himself.
SPEAKER_02: If he beats and manages to beat Devon, definitely we should pull 100%. If he loses, I don't know. Maybe he should, maybe after a loss, meet with Ermes or maybe with Jerry. Those would be good options. Okay. Peter Anchor says, how does Lewand plan his workouts?
SPEAKER_01: through the weeks? His wrists every other day or fingers other day or how does he train?
SPEAKER_01: I don't think it's a good idea to put a ban on the ban on the whole country. There's a lot of progress to be made. That's what I think. On the other hand, yes, if you look at the current state of affairs, it's a very low level.
SPEAKER_02: uh yeah i used to train wrist and fingers uh daily uh to do that every day but as i progressed and as the weights uh got higher i think it's actually quite dangerous to train them daily so i usually do that twice twice per week so for the beginning especially after you reach your your limits you don't need to train every day you know because
SPEAKER_01: Then it doesn't recover, you know?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, as you get to the heavier weights, you simply can't recover on an everyday basis to be fresh again. Plus it becomes dangerous and basically the closer you are to the limit, the more sparse it should become. And as a beginner, yeah, sure, you can do that. Especially when you are young, very young, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Devon, there is a question. It says, the prediction about Vitaly versus Devon, the question is coming from Ben. Thank you for your super chat. Devon, what is Vitaly's prediction for the group group? Well, since Michael is with Vitaly, I'm going to vote for Vitaly. I don't know if he's going to win, but I think that Michael is going to win.
SPEAKER_01: In this regard, I would like to express my condolences to Larratt. I would like to say that Larratt was in a very good position at that time. He was in a very good position at that time. He was in a very good position at that time. He was in a very good position.
SPEAKER_02: My prediction on the Michael and Vitaly's match was wrong. The Latin won. I expected a heavier and tougher fight. Even though it wasn't easy for Vitaly, he still managed to be victorious.
SPEAKER_02: I think with Devon, I'm putting Devon as a slight favorite. I think that even during the setup, Devon will manage to get the grip that he wants. And right after the match starts, he will manage to crack the wrists of Vitaly.
SPEAKER_03: And I think even in straps, Devon will feel much comfortable after the setup. But he says that Devon will be slightly favored. So does it mean that LaLette also has a good chance?
SPEAKER_01: Yes, it's a big problem in Europe. There is a percentage of people who think that it is possible to go to the start line. I think that it is necessary to do so.
SPEAKER_02: I wouldn't give Devon a huge advantage, maybe 60-40. There is a chance that Vitaly manages to get the fast hit at the beginning.
SPEAKER_02: There is a chance for that, but we all know how Devon pulls. He loads even during the setup, and at the go he will be already loaded and pulling. So I think he will manage to stop that first. That's what I'm interested in, to see if I can stop it. One thing I would like to say to Devon,
SPEAKER_02: I'm really interested what will be the trash talk between the two. I really wonder what Devon will find to screw with Vitaly's mind. Devon will always find something to screw.
SPEAKER_02: motivate motivate himself yeah with every opponent devin manages to pick the brain uh of the of them and i i really wonder uh what he finds in the with vitalis at this time does he does does he think that does leon think that vitale will keep his cool
SPEAKER_01: What do you think, Vitaly? I think Vitaly will be able to say that he didn't go to Sweden. I think he will be able to say that he didn't go to Australia. I think he will be able to say that he didn't go to China. I think he will be able to say that he didn't go to China. I think he will be able to say that he didn't go to China. I think he will be able to say that he didn't go to China.
SPEAKER_02: most probably he will be calm and stoic even during the press conference or trash talk or at the table he will try his best to keep his cool uh i as a fan on the other hand really want to see them fight even before uh to see them poking at each other uh so i will i will hope no
SPEAKER_01: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
SPEAKER_02: Actually, Engin should poke Vitaly. Find the buttons to press. The way he does on Ermes told you about this and that, he should poke Vitaly as well and trigger. I was quiet.
SPEAKER_03: I was calm, I was quiet. Engin came here, told their mess, said all these nasty things about you, and now I'm on fire. Yes, yes, that's my job, Levan, that's my job. Unfortunately, yeah, we need those kind of excitement as well. I mean, yeah, there is always some kind of stress. As I said at the beginning of the podcast, when you call me,
SPEAKER_01: When you were angry with Ermes, I didn't do anything. And you call me, you are like, remember, remember, remember. No, no, no, remember. When is Ermes coming to Istanbul? Yeah, Ermes already apologized for that, so we can... Yeah, I know, I know, I know. Yeah, and he took down the video, so no problem there.
SPEAKER_03: No, no, I know it's not a problem, but sometimes the problem starts by itself without me getting involved. Engin, don't do too much or I will fly to Italy tomorrow and just pull him there. Until things get serious,
SPEAKER_03: I mean, I do a little bit, you know, silly, but once it gets clear, I'm the one who calms the things down. Like, like, like when you call that day, I was like trying to.
SPEAKER_01: calm you down, calm you down, and everything was okay. Engin is a very good diplomat. He's very good at negotiation and finds a perfect in-between to calm things down or keep the things excited.
SPEAKER_03: It's my responsibility and I'm also older than them. They are like my older brothers in armwrestling. I only want the best for them. That's all. Of course, we want some excitement for the fans. And about Laletin, Laletin doesn't need anyone to provoke him. Whenever I ask Laletin, Laletin himself provokes Devon. He says, Michael is stronger than
SPEAKER_03: Devon and he says Devon has 0.1% chance. So Laletin looks very, very confident.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know. It's not Stalin. It's Napoleon. In fairness, it's Napoleon. The Italians may be Joseph Stalin. So he's confident as well. Yeah. Okay. Trip is asking, is it boring to be unbeaten for many years?
SPEAKER_01: No, I'm not bored at all. I'm still on fire, still motivated.
SPEAKER_01: ready to fight ready to fly to verona or wherever he is so i'm i'm still ready for for everything yeah yeah yeah yeah motivation
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, sometimes I might get bored for a short while, but as soon as I see Ermes' large balloon head, I get in a fighting mood right away. Hey, you made that mistake one time on the first match. You said that you didn't take him seriously. And I don't think that... Yeah, yeah. And now I'm very serious. I will seriously destroy him. Yeah, yeah. And Ermes thinks that he's going to beat you.
SPEAKER_03: He tells me, Engin, come to Chicago and see the new king, he says. New king. He says, Ermes Gasparini, now the number one arm-lester. Come on, Levan, come on. So, Levan, you are saying that there is... Levan, Levan, Levan, Levan. Levan, Levan, there is no possibility at all? Zero chance? Ah.
SPEAKER_03: No, no chance. No chance. Oh, okay. So you can even Hamad Ahmed says, Salam Engin and hello Levan. What do you and Levan think about Devon not lifting any weights and just do table training? Can he get strong with that?
SPEAKER_02: I think Devon has a lot of experience, but I don't know if he will be able to do it. He has a lot of experience. I think his back is broken. What's the problem with his back? Why did he hurt him? I have no idea. Oh, you mean that he did something to him. Oh, okay. So he cannot lift heavy because he can't use his back. Okay.
SPEAKER_01: In the first chapter, we say that it is a good thing to have a child. But when it is not a good thing to have a child, it is a good thing to have a child. But when it is a good thing to have a child, it is useful to have a child for many reasons. Ford example, when you go to the hospital, you see that you have a child.
SPEAKER_02: It would be better for Ermes to keep quiet, to keep calm, because we all remember during our last match, when I wasn't angry, his shoulder was injured for a very long while after the match. Now, it might be even worse consequences. So, in his place, I would keep quiet and keep away. Okay, so Ermes needs to be quiet. Okay. He will watch this and he will probably... It's Artamos.
SPEAKER_02: He can eat pizza. So his mouth will be full, he cannot talk anymore. Yeah, he can flex his muscles, no problem. Yeah, the small muscles that he has. And what will you do on the press conference if he gives you the oxygen mask, really? I will breathe it in. More oxygen, the better.
SPEAKER_01: Ok, let's go. What did you think about Nugo vs. Matt Mask match? It was a very emotional match. Nugo was very brave, very motivated. I was very impressed.
SPEAKER_01: However, when it comes to emotion, there are a lot of emotions, and it is clear that there is no such thing as emotional pain. There are some problems, I am aware of them, but in general, it is very difficult. The soul is very strong, and seriously, it is not possible to do all this, and everything can be done, no matter how hard you try.
SPEAKER_02: It was a very emotional match, a great match, emotional for everybody. Nugo showed us that he's a fighter. He has a great fighter spirit. In the moments he might have been too emotional, maybe said a bit too much here and there.
SPEAKER_02: uh but that happens uh that needs experience with experience uh uh he will he might this this might change but overall matt is a cool guy he's a great guy and uh i think he understood everything well um in the future i don't know uh we might we might need to control our our emotions uh yeah
SPEAKER_01: That's why I think it's appropriate to say, according to my theory, that there is no need to think about what you want to do. Emotionality is not possible, as I said. I would like to point out that I think there are a lot of emotions, but there are not a lot of emotions. In Sinamdule, for example,
SPEAKER_01: This is an example of emotions. In this sense, it is possible to say that you work hard and you realize that there is no such thing as a negative emotion, and if you can get rid of it, I think it will be very, very important.
SPEAKER_02: Even though he's Georgii, he's part of our team, I think that in some cases the words that he used might have been a bit over the line. I think that overall we should show a bit more respect to our opponents.
SPEAKER_03: I understand that it can become emotional. But in terms of arm wrestling, it was a great display. It was a great match. He showed a great, great fight. I talked with Niko. Niko is our little brother. We love him. I told him that I love him. But as you said, some of the words that were not even translated, maybe it was a little bit off the line.
SPEAKER_03: JR55AMG, Hi Engin, Hi Levan. What would you think of training with Brian Shaw? Give him tips and maybe 2-3 years table experience. Would he be able to make you work for your title? Best wishes for you all. Thank you. What would you like to say to Brian Shaw? I am very grateful to Engin.
SPEAKER_01: Thanks to Robert Baxter, I was able to come to the United States. I had a very good visa. I had a very good visa, and now I have a ten-year visa. And I think that it is very important for me to be able to work with Brian in some period of time.
SPEAKER_01: I think it will be useful for me and for the audience. I will make videos about it. I think it will be useful for the audience. I think it will be useful for the audience. I think it will be useful for the audience. I think it will be useful for the audience. I think it will be useful for the audience.
SPEAKER_02: Well, thanks to Engin and Robert, I now have a long-term visa to the US, the 10 year one. So I would actually gladly go to Brian maybe for a week or two and gladly train him.
SPEAKER_02: I would be happy to share my knowledge. Overall, I think that Brian is a great addition to the sport. If done properly and with the proper training, I think that there is a potential for him to crack the top 10. And if that happens, that would be really, really good for the sport.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, guys, please don't show any more super chat because I'm closing. I don't want to miss your super chat and I don't want you to be upset. Hicham Ben. Hello, Levan. I just wanted to ask you if you ever tried to do the riser lift that Ermes does. If so, how much did you lift in that moment, you know, for the riser lift? He's asking how much did you do if you ever tried it.
SPEAKER_02: I used to train the riser that specific way but I haven't done that in the world. Yeah, last five years I haven't done the riser in that fashion.
SPEAKER_01: I think it's a good practice to do this, and I think it's not a bad thing to do.
SPEAKER_02: Lately I'm not training the riser separately as a movement. I usually focus on it during the table practice at the table time. So I'm not doing the specific accessory with a strap or any other way. So it's mostly table time for the riser.
SPEAKER_01: I think it is very important to have a good relationship with your partner. I think it is very important to have a good relationship with your partner. I think it is very important to have a good relationship
SPEAKER_02: Actually, I have an advantage and privilege to have great sparring partners, top athletes. Because of that, our table practice is much more useful and we can train many different aspects. And actually, the way Ermes trains, he doesn't have strong sparring partners. He has to train with the weights mostly.
SPEAKER_01: and actually great job for him to reaching this level uh just this way okay the ways that he's lived in are real ways
SPEAKER_01: Ghermez, Gasparini, Maraykha, they all weigh 13 kilos, 14 kilos, and they all weigh 13 kilos, 14 kilos, and they all weigh 13 kilos, 14 kilos, and they all weigh 13 kilos, and they all weigh 13 kilos, and they all weigh 13 kilos, and they all weigh 13 kilos, and they all weigh 13 kilos, and they all weigh 13 kilos, and they all weigh 13 kilos, and they all weigh 13 kilos, and they all weigh 13 kilos, and they all weigh 13 kilos, and they all weigh 13 kilos, and they all weigh 13 kilos, and they all weigh 13 kilos, and they all weigh 13 kilos, and they all weigh 13 kilos, and they all weigh 13 kilos, and they all weigh 13 kilos, and they all weigh 13 kilos, and they all weigh 13 kilos, and they all weigh 13 kilos, and they all weigh 13 kilos, and they all weigh 13 kilos, and they all weigh 13 kilos, and they all weigh 13 kilos, and they all weigh 13 kilos, and they all weigh 13 kilos
SPEAKER_01: Well, the way the weights swayed when he was doing the riser lift, that just seemed unnatural for that weight. The only thing I'm saying is that
SPEAKER_02: Of course, we trust Dermis. He's trying his best.
SPEAKER_02: Whenever I'm doing the maximum lift, for example, this 180, we shot the video that the whole bar was in sight. We also filmed each of the plates. So there's no question about the weight being 180. Even if Ermes is lifting those weights, we can't see that, right? At least he can weigh them. That would be more impressive and more telling to us.
SPEAKER_01: He's just writing the number and how do we know? How does he know that that's the actual number? Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I could have shot my 180 just filming the bar and myself, no weights in the frame. And I could just say that it's 180.
SPEAKER_03: Uh, sure thing, Ermes is lifting great weights, but we are just seeing the cable and his arm. Uh, so we, we can't say there's just no way to tell, uh, what's the actual weight there. Hmm. I understand. I understand. I understand. Okay. Anyways, Levan, thank you very, very much for your time. And I will have you as my guest again, together with Ermes.
SPEAKER_03: before they went. Engin, did you resume your training? Your arms look bigger. My shoulders, arms look good, better? Yes. Yeah? Do you think I should come back? I think you're planning to. Yeah, do you think that I will have a chance or not at all?
SPEAKER_01: 77 kilos, maybe 85 kilos. Where do you think I should go? How can I say no chance to the legendary Engin Terzi? Whichever weight you choose to come back to, everybody will be nervous.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I'm not saying I will win, but I don't think that anyone can beat me like this. There will be a war, you know. But I'm talking about the very best ones, but we will see. We will see, Levan. I'm coming, and somehow my body is responding good. I thought I was finished. But more I train, more like, hmm, I feel good. Maybe a few years rest, maybe tendons now healthier. I don't know. Yeah, we will see.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, good luck. I will be only happy to see you return. Were you there? Did you watch my match when I pulled against Biorel Dobrin? Actually, I don't remember that one. He came to Istanbul together with Gennady, and there was Andrei Kipriyano versus...
SPEAKER_03: I think same day I pulled with the Romanian guy. This is first East and West, yes? It was not East versus West. It was like best 78 kilo. Ford your comeback, I will be in your corner, Engin.
SPEAKER_03: Please, promise? Promise? Promise? Also, are you going to invite me to your wedding? Of course, of course. Of course, right? Yeah. Of course. We'll get in the plane to Tbilisi for you. Hey, I know we can talk this privately, but how about this summer? You, your wife, Irakli, just come for some time, you know. Very nice.
SPEAKER_01: Now, in the US, there is a tendency to go to Miami, to go with friends or family. After that, there is a tendency to go to the UFC, to the events, to the tournaments. And for some period, they go to Miami. Now, from the US, from the US, from the US, from the US, from the US, from the US, from the US,
SPEAKER_02: After the match, we might stay in the U.S. for some time. Might go to Miami, maybe to the UFC event with Topovia. But after that, with pleasure, it would be great. Yeah, yeah. Take me there. Anytime you want. It would be good. It would be good to be my guest. And Vako will also come.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure. You too, Tornike, too. I'm sorry. Yeah, just come all together. It would be great. Be my guest. And your video very soon ready. It's almost ready. Maybe a little bit changes. You will like it. You will like it. Thank you. Anyways, thank you very much, Vako. I know you are behind the camera. And Tornike, the God translator, thank you. Levan, I see you very well. I see you very good, you know, like very good.
SPEAKER_03: very good psychology, very good mood, and you look very healthy and strong. And let's see what will happen if Gladiator wins or the... I crush him. I crush him, Engin. I promise. You will crush him? I promise you, I crush him. Listen, listen. Not kill, not kill. If you cannot control, he's pronated. Not kill, not kill. I promise, not kill, but crush.
SPEAKER_03: Not kill, but crush. Listen, if you cannot control his pronator, if you overpronate, and then because you are overpronating, if he still has the pronator, don't you think there is a chance? I will control him everywhere. I will control his life.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, yeah. I can't wait. I can't wait for the podcast a few weeks later. Oh, yeah. You know what I will do when I invite you guys? You guys will talk. I will just sit like this. You guys can fight each other. I will just enjoy it. Thank you very much, Levan. And thanks again, guys. You have a good night. And thanks to everyone who watched us. Hey, Levan, there is one more question I think I missed. They are asking, if Ali Can and Daddy Can pull, who wins?
SPEAKER_03: Left? Yeah. Oh, my God. 50-50. 50-50. Anyways, take care of yourself, Levan. Thank you. Bye-bye. Thank you.
