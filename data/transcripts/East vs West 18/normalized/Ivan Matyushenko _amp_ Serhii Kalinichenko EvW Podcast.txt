SPEAKER_04: Hello, hello, everyone. Hello, everyone.
SPEAKER_04: Ivan Matushenko and Sergei Kalnyshenko, they will be my guests. And I think soon, in five minutes, they will join. So better wait a little bit. And then
SPEAKER_04: Till that time I can share the link and I can chat with you guys a bit. Okay, someone already came. Hello, hello, Sergi. How are you, my friend? Good, and you? Good, good. Me too. So how is everything? Those arms look huge. Even the left arm also look big, huh? Left arm?
SPEAKER_00: yes yes i start training my left um before i have planning to pull the qualification bubble cup and then maybe one month very good train no no no i don't doesn't pull because the uh you give for me much with the one and i have concentration on my right arm after yeah yeah it's like maybe
SPEAKER_04: Two months ago, not one month ago, I stopped training. I have a question for you. You broke your left arm in 2018 Zloty final? Yes, the Zloty final, yes. Fia. Was it against Alan Makev? Yes, yes, yes. I come to final. Your left arm at that time was as good as your right arm or even better? You know, in compete?
SPEAKER_00: My left arm, maybe 60% competes better. As a result. Yes, but right arm, of course, more strong, more strong before, but not too much different, maybe 2%, 2% different. Right was a bit better, but left was more successful.
SPEAKER_00: You know, when I come to Zloty, I have only, I preparation only my right arm. And they have only 50 euro for pulling only in one arm. And my friend say, no, Sergei, you need pull two arm. I give for you 50 euro and you pull left and right. But I prepare two left arm, but have playing only right arm. Yes, because my right more stronger.
SPEAKER_04: And with the left arm, you reach the final. But... Yeah, but Irene McHale, is it?
SPEAKER_00: yeah in qualification rounds yes in qualification round and before final i have maybe three or four hours rest and after when i start warm up i feel all my body uh crump
SPEAKER_00: My chest, my shoulders, my brachioradialis, everything crumped like this, impossible to move. And it's because I lose too much weight. And seven years ago, I didn't understand about hydratation, use something for water. Can I ask you something? How old were you at that time? How old me? Yeah, during the Zloty time. What was your age?
SPEAKER_04: 25. Now you are 32? Yes, 32. Okay. Because one of my students in the past, he tried to lose the weight like those UFC fighters do. They suddenly go into baths and lose the weight. And he did that. And at the European Championship, he broke his left arm.
SPEAKER_04: Three months later he competed well, he did the same cuts and then now this time he broke his right arm. Yeah. And he was undefeated in the final and the final, I think as far as I remember, he broke his arm. So maybe, maybe for the young people, listen,
SPEAKER_04: those UFC fighters, they are not really like putting joint pressure. I mean, I know they also have something, but not like arm wrestling. Yes, 100%. Maybe it's not super good, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: to lose weight. It's not super good. And then when you lose weight, you need to control your your potassium, calcium, calcium, everything needs. When I spoke with doctor, he said for me, before every competes, you need to use calcium before before 10 or 15 days don't don't need more 15 days.
SPEAKER_00: When you have nerves, when you have hard training, your calcium, you lose. He said you don't need it every time, only before two weeks you compete.
SPEAKER_00: But, you know, we have, it's very hard sport about you pulled with real opponent. And sometimes, you know, sometimes you have too much power here, your opponent, too much power, other lines. And it's happened, it's had every sports, you know, football, people break.
SPEAKER_00: break legs basketball fingers every sports have a problem and i see i i know basketball and football it's best number one in the world trump trump traumatic sports you know injury sports yeah yeah and we are waiting for um evan and soon he will join us
SPEAKER_04: Let me check if he sent me a message, if he has any problem to answer or he's late, I don't know. Okay, he says three, four minutes he's asking. Okay. So let's talk while we are waiting for Ivan. I want to ask you a few questions. Yeah. Do you agree that your opponent is someone who has
SPEAKER_04: probably the best ability to take the opponent in hook. I'm not saying that he's the best hook puller. He's very, very good. He's right there. But like, it is very hard to top roll Ivan. So my question is to you, are you, I don't know, maybe I shouldn't ask you this, but I'm just asking, it's up to you. You don't have to answer. Do you think it's possible to top roll him?
SPEAKER_00: I think it's possible, but last two months I train only hook. It's possible top roll, but I train hook because for me, I have very good top roll. And for me, it's not possible. It's too short time, two months progress in top roll.
SPEAKER_00: And I start to train my hook, my position, hook position. But you're already a top roller. Yes, I'm a top roller. I have good top roll, very good top roll. I train top roll, but not like to Lamparelli.
SPEAKER_04: Not like this. I train my pronation, but not back pressure. Baba, is it for you? Listen, you couldn't top roll Lamparelli because Lamparelli's hand is strong. And Lamparelli is also attacking your hand. But if somebody is coming to your inside, so they are not attacking your hand, maybe it is better for you to use your pronator. Of course, of course.
SPEAKER_00: We will see. My opinion, it's 50-50. I think Matyushenko don't have right arm like left. Devon't have left... Talking about the hook power or the... Wrist, wrist, wrist. His right wrist is not as strong as his left. Yes, I think not the same. I think, of course, his wrist...
SPEAKER_00: best of the best in the world I think I think he possible cup maybe 80 or 90 kilograms is right with left 100 kilograms but it's very important comfortable my arm for him or not grip you know table IQ very important how
SPEAKER_00: how good grip he have I give for him this moment or not and for me in my opinion much better it's a reference grip for me and maybe I stay with the loose position with my wrist with my uh
SPEAKER_04: Ivan, quiet, listen. He's telling the secrets how he's going to pull against you. Hello, Ivan, how are you? Hello, hello. Good to see you, good to see you. He's saying that you are best of the best, you know, with the hook inability, but he still thinks that your left arm is better than your right arm. He's 100% right, yes.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah. I think my right thumb is about 80 or 85% of my left thumb. Uh-huh. And... Baba, can I ask you something? Is it in the hook or is it about the hand? It's about the hook. Hook, yeah. That's what I'm guessing. I think your hand is right there, you know. Yes, my wrist and fingers are about the same.
SPEAKER_04: Same power. Okay. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Go ahead. Sorry. Sorry, Ivan. How was Sergei going to beat me up? Ivan, your voice is getting cut a little bit. Like sometimes I hear, sometimes I don't. Is it the same for you, Sergei? What? No. Do you hear, Ivan, very clearly or sometimes voice is high? Yeah, sometimes like near, sometimes not. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Okay. Can you talk again, Ivan? Let's see. Yes, my internet is ... Now it's very good. Fortunately, it is better, and I need to be very close to router. No, no. Right now is both the video and audio, but they both are very good right now, yeah. So I will be here. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's very good, yeah. So what were you saying, Serhii? I cut you. Sorry about it when Ivan came.
SPEAKER_00: Sergei was showing something with his wrist. Yes, yes. He said he chooses the referee's grip. Yes, of course, much better ranking for me, I think, is the referee's grip.
SPEAKER_00: Why is that? Why is that? Because Ivan is also, he doesn't have like really squeezing grip, but he is also very fast, you know, like, you know. You know, because I will speak every time, I will say every time for referee, wrist, wrist, wrist, wrist, because Ivan every time stay little, you know, little is supinate position like this. And for me need this position. No, no, not that much, but maybe straight.
SPEAKER_04: so you will ask references to start you want like this yes okay i i don't think referee will listen i think this is okay not this and not this but but like straight yeah yeah yeah do you do you think that ivan ivan is faster than you or you are faster or about the same
SPEAKER_00: I think 100% he have more fast cupping, more fast cupping move, it's 100%. But I think side, this move, I think I'm more faster. So you are saying that your body may be faster? Yes, yes, yes, yes. Because all my life I trained this move for
SPEAKER_04: Not cupping, like maximum cupping fast side, maximum fast side. And I think for my opinion, we will have hook match. I mean, I think the same way. I think the same way. I just think that, you know, it's not my business, but when you try to top roll someone because you pull your body back and then if your pronator turns, now it is very hard to come back.
SPEAKER_04: be good in hook like you need to have super power to stop because you are going back and then the guy just turns you so now it is even hard to come back for hook how do you think about this match ivan i think it will be a difficult match for me and i hope for sergey as well and to my mind it will endurance will matter much
SPEAKER_01: and i do not see i do not see myself uh flash period in the first or second round i think uh sergey will try to trouble me and most probably will get into hook position where he is he has also good biceps and good
SPEAKER_01: I'm a good pronator and I think it could be difficult for me to win quickly. And then endurance, who has better endurance, I think that athlete will have more chances. Another question, Ivan. If Serhii tries to top-roll you,
SPEAKER_01: And if you can hook him, then is that a possibility for you? You think that it can be a quick win if he tries to top roll? I think that he will try to top roll me. He will try to add back and coordination every time.
SPEAKER_01: And I do not think that he will go hook himself. I do not think so. What are your plans, Sergey? Okay. It's not secret. It's not secret. Lying is okay. Listen, if you guys say something now,
SPEAKER_04: and do something different at the tables, we will give you one warning online during the podcast. Just joking, joking. Oh no, oh no. So, I mean, yeah, you are saying, Serhii, you are saying that it is, you are thinking that it will end up in the hook, this is what you are saying. Yes, I think for me,
SPEAKER_00: I saw a lot of matches on YouTube when Ivan pulled, and I think for me to go to maximum top role, I lose my endurance, and he caught me. I don't think about my position, maximum top role.
SPEAKER_00: 50-50. 50% hook, 50% top roll. I think it's my position. So it's more like this. Yes. Not like this. I don't know 100% how it will be, but for my opinion, I have this position after start. And after...
SPEAKER_00: When I stop, Ivan, it's possible for me go to hook, stay in my brachioradialis more, stay, or more hook. You will decide later. Yes, or maybe I have short position. I go to flop press, but not, of course, after ready go. After stop,
SPEAKER_00: When match step, why not? I open my wrist and try press. When somebody is really isolated, your pronator with here, this is very hard to pull up, you know, because it is just that you have all the pressure on your pronator. Yes, it's very hard, but I have good move this. I train transition every time and it's possible. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Wow, it will be an incredible match. And you also think that it will be a tough match? Like, it will not be quick? Yes. My right arm, it used to be not so, what to say, I usually had long matches with my right arm. Unlike my left.
SPEAKER_01: and my right arm had good endurance in the last years but now after injury i'm not sure that it has very good injury that it has very good endurance but we'll see okay and and do you like how many table times you already did before this match no 12 table times no tough one
SPEAKER_01: Sergei would be my first test, my really hard test. I tried to pull Brekin Khoev. Brekin Khoev. He came to me about two months ago and I felt good against him.
SPEAKER_04: I thought you were much better than I thought. Do you know why you are very, very good also? Because he is more like this way. Ford them to do pressure
SPEAKER_04: You know, they need to have their pronator with them, but you are someone that you can turn them that way. So it is very hard for them to do the press because you control their pronator probably quickly and then you catch them on bicep instead of the tricep. I don't know. Did it go that way or? I think I caught him with the pronator and side and side.
SPEAKER_01: And I thought, good. And I didn't even try to pull Lolitin. You know that video when he beat me? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I didn't want to pull him. He's too strong now. And I thought that. During the weight training,
SPEAKER_01: It's almost good. My side pressure is good, my wrist is good. My angles, I don't train them much, but they do not, but no discomfort now. How is the health generally, like with the arm, right arm? Like injuries, they're all gone right now? Well, you know, I had an injury and
SPEAKER_01: Unfortunately, I didn't do an operation. And now it is too late to do it. Yeah, same me. During the Arthur March I had it. So the potential has decreased, I think. And this kind of power is worse. But how important...
SPEAKER_04: So we'll see. That will be a really good test. Serhii, right now I look at you, you still look like super heavyweight. You don't look like heavyweight. How far are you from 115 kilos?
SPEAKER_00: In the morning I have 190 kilos. Only 4 kilos you need to lose. Yes, yes, yes. After Lamparelli I start to control my weight. I do cardio three, minimum three, four times per week.
SPEAKER_00: yeah and uh i have a very good regime for my for eating control calories everything and yes but if you know i feel my shoulders and my biceps stay more bigger because i'm too much train hook
SPEAKER_04: and it's too much work my biceps yeah i don't know you look you look like shoulders like this biceps like this you know it's t-shirt it's t-shirt it's not tissue it's your arm yeah yeah is you you have one of the like most impressive forearms you know like very
SPEAKER_04: weird you know like like very unique forearm uh people say i think it will be a great match and uh you both are very uh friendly people and yesterday i was talking with Travis Travis said that when i pulled his head against Serhii he said at the beginning he said that he felt your fingers hand so soft
SPEAKER_00: And then when the goal came, he said, like, your fingers were, like, super, super strong. And he was amazed by your power. You saw this with Lamparelli. I give second round, I give him strap. It's me give strap. Because Morozov say for me, go to strap, go to strap, go to strap, go to strap. I say, okay, go to strap. And I give for him opportunity to slap. But it was very hard to top-roll him, right?
SPEAKER_00: like uh yes of course of course you know Dave Chaffee have problem with his top roll and uh as you saw fight with Michael Todd yeah amazing fight uh it's very hard to top roll Lamperelli I have news for you guys I have news uh Dave Chaffee is coming to your category
SPEAKER_01: i know this i thought about this today and i thought that the winner of our match uh would possibly uh or dave right what's that um i thought about dave today i thought that the winner of match me and sergey possible possible yeah i mean listen like we have tons of
SPEAKER_04: matches that it will happen this day that day winner of this match or now someone else later but all these matches will happen and yeah yeah and it's it's great yeah i spoke today with uh dave chafer oh you did today yes yes you know i'm gonna destroy you and
SPEAKER_00: No, no, we very friendly speak about. I'm joking, yeah. About fight. And of course, now, 115, it's very interesting. Very interesting. And if Reno comes back, then it will be even more interesting. Yes, maybe I need, I come back to Super Hero 8. Super Hero 8 is more difficult when level one is there.
SPEAKER_00: When I saw train Gasparini, I think, oh, okay. I am very lucky because I am back to 115 because he trained with unreal weight, unreal weight for me. He very strong. You can be in your daily life 120, 22, and 115 easy.
SPEAKER_04: you understand why like other guys are 160 kilos 70 kilos 150 kilos you know you to become 150 kilos you need to be very unhealthy you understand yes but look uh rms now have 127 kilos and amazing form and risk genetic is very good yeah unreal unreal yeah and i have a question for you uh ivan
SPEAKER_04: How many matches did you have with right arm at the East Versus? Only one or? Only one with Kamil. Only with Kamil, right? Because I have been thinking, thinking, thinking. I just couldn't remember your another right arm match. So all your matches except one was left arm. Yes, true. Yeah. I'd like to have some more matches with right. Yeah, yeah. I had many problems recent years with right. But I hope...
SPEAKER_04: we'll manage to cool once or twice a year yeah yeah yeah yeah i mean like hey listen we we we are like communicating you know all the time all you guys need to do is just tell me you know which i'm ready and then i will do that way you know yeah yeah anyway so let's see let's see how it will be and i i think that it will be
SPEAKER_04: Like, I will tell you my opinion. I really see this match 50-50. If I didn't see 50-50, I don't say my opinion. But 50-50, so I believe Ivan will be able to hook Serhii. And because Serhii's arm is very, very strong, and then we will see a battle. And I think, as Ivan said, it will be an endurance battle. Whose endurance is better, I think we'll end up winning. But we will see. We will see.
SPEAKER_04: Okay, so let's talk about the other matches. Did you guys like the King of the Table 14 card? Best card King of the Table, 100%. Yeah, it's the best King of the Table card. And I'm planning to make a June card for US event and just wait and then see. I'm not going to say anything.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, so let's start with the matches. When Lachlan pulled against Krasimir, were you there, Ivan? No. You were not there? I'm not sure I remember the match, but I think it was at KOT, right? I was only once at KOT against Morozov and it was not...
SPEAKER_04: I saw this match. Yes, you remember, right? Yes, I remember. Right now, I have seen Krasimir vs Petro Marharin in the 2022 WAF in Antalya. They had a long match, a very long match. Power was very close and then when Krasimir went to King of the Table to pull Lachlan,
SPEAKER_04: Krasimir had to pull very smart and use his experience to make sure that Lachlan couldn't apply all his power. And so I think that Krasimir really won that match with his experience. You know, of course, he was also strong, but I don't think Lachlan was any weaker, you know. And now I said Lachlan versus Petro Marharin.
SPEAKER_04: Petro Marharin, in my opinion, is very hard to take his risks, very hard. I think he has probably, for his weight, the strongest risks. And I think this match will go inside. How do you guys see this match? I think it's a hook match. Of course, it's a hook match. And in my opinion, it's not fast, but three-time Margarine win, because Margarine is not fast.
SPEAKER_04: he like uh yeah but when the opponent is slow when the opponent is slow lachlan is able to engage like like like pauline also just was very fast explosive and beat him but this time i think lachlan will have enough time because petro is slow and they will give their power so you are saying that a lot uh petro is gonna win like yes everybody
SPEAKER_00: everybody who go to hook with margarine everybody 105 kilo lose everybody
SPEAKER_00: I think Margarine is top three in 105. But of course, he only starts pool. But soon, maybe after one game. If they win, they will have a tougher match next time. Yes, of course, of course. Peter Margarine, I'm trained with him.
SPEAKER_00: many times and I have fight with him and only one time in my life I win. Against Marharit? Yes. But did you take his wrist? Too much. No, I win hook. Yes, that's what I said. It is more possible to beat him inside and take his wrist.
SPEAKER_00: But now he more smart train and when he hook, he very good control pronate. Before he stay like this. Yeah, he was giving the pronate. Yes, but now he work and it's finished. Hand and wrist is just amazing. I think it's for Lachlan he stopped.
SPEAKER_00: And like slowly, one, two, maybe, I don't know, six, five seconds every round, but three times, in my opinion, Margarine wins. It's not because he's my friend. It's really, it's really, really my opinion. Yeah, yeah. Okay. And Ivan? I agree with Sergey. I think the pro is the favorite.
SPEAKER_01: And Lakhlan has chances only if he had maybe 20% progress, I think. Oh, from the last time to this time. Yes, if he made such progress, then he would have chances. But if he didn't, Petr is much more experienced. And I think he was... And he has advantage...
SPEAKER_04: Do you know which match eventually, I don't care about what is the result of this match, but do you know which match eventually I want to set? Tata Sings versus Petro Marharit.
SPEAKER_04: That would be something different because Todd is now pronation-based pulling. I think it is more possible to beat Marhari with maybe shoulder press or something. Todd doesn't have that, so they will both pull each other like this because it is very hard to top roll Petro Marhari. It would be an interesting match. I have seen Lachlan versus Todd Hutchings in the past, but these two I haven't seen yet.
SPEAKER_04: Yes, I think it's very good, very interesting. Okay, so let's go another match. And this one I want only the percentage. Ivan Matyshenko vs. Serhii Kalinchenko. Of course I will win. Of course? What percentage?
SPEAKER_00: Of course, I will win 50-50. You will win 50-50? Yes, yes. Yes, it's close match. And for my opinion, Ivan,
SPEAKER_00: it's best arm wrestlers in my best i don't know maybe 20 years ago not 20 15 years ago i saw much when he wins europe world and the maximum title opponent
SPEAKER_00: Ford me, of course, I'm a legend. I'm very excited about this. He has very good IQ in table. And for me, it's not only power.
SPEAKER_00: uh because here uh he very smart in table and need to be careful and i am ready really i am ready how it's possible to this match and i believe in myself and i give 100 what i have my power and i will win okay anyone
SPEAKER_01: I would say 50-50. Yes. Under current circumstances, I think it is 50-50 match. I would not say what would be a year ago or two years ago, but now I think it is really 50-50. Okay. Okay.
SPEAKER_04: So let's go to another match. Zurab Taberize, Gyorgy Tautiev. You know, you guys are very familiar with these guys from WAF, Europeans. And how do you see this match? It is 105 kilo category.
SPEAKER_00: It's very hard for prediction. Again, it's very hard for prediction. It's, I think, 50-50. It's very hard because the TauTiu have... Very good top role and then Europe is very... Yes, Europe have very good side. It's possible, everything possible in this match. Yeah, I agree. And Ivan, how do you see this match?
SPEAKER_01: Unfortunately, also 50-50. Before our chat, I looked through the pairs and in almost in all pairs, I think in 11 pairs, for me, it's about 50-50. It's extremely difficult to say. To achieve, I know he had injury in his wrist, but it will not matter because Zurab is not attacking there.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, but Zurab had his break two years ago.
SPEAKER_01: And that could be his problem. I'm not sure that he's psychologically ready to pull hard without his wrist. I'm sure that Tutiv will take his wrist. But I'm not sure that Zurab is psychologically ready to flop press. But if he's ready, then it's 50-50 because overall power is in favor of Zurab.
SPEAKER_04: Is there any possibility that he doesn't lose his wrist, but just stay flat and spinning like Sacho usually stays? I do not believe in that. It's very, very hard to hook out here. That's why always Haji Murad's... Not for the wrap, I think, because his lever is not so high. There were some pulls, I think, Arsen, who managed to hook Georgii.
SPEAKER_04: But it will be difficult for Zoran. There's a super chat, DB Talks, talking about Georgii Svetko. People think Georgii will lose, but I saw him and Prudnik after playing Arlington and Prudnik could not hook him. Dadikian will not be able to either.
SPEAKER_04: So maybe let's go to that match since we already shared the prediction for the Zurab and Tautiev. First of all, were you guys surprised that Dadikian beat Alex Kurdecha? Yes. So you both were surprised? No, I was not in all predictions.
SPEAKER_01: uh i do not see alex any variance for alex to win i think that david when he doesn't have injuries he is extremely dangerous with his left hand when he had injuries but now well i was sure about that match wow
SPEAKER_04: And I think that's the only match now where I see the favorite. So do you guys agree that Kurdecha is someone that like with the very good hand, wrist, with the left arm and then going more like right way that way while
SPEAKER_04: Swetko is a top pro specialist, you know, like using more pronation. Like Swetko is good at taking the risk while Kurdecha just, like if you guys remember Morozov in a lighter version, he was able to hook without the strap Kurdecha in round one already. So do you guys agree that Swetko may have better pronation than Kurdecha?
SPEAKER_04: I do not think so. I think that Georgii's left is not as good as his right. Do you know the truth? His left originally was better, if you remember. Maybe he beat Lewand in 2015 Europeans. But later he got injured, but now he said that he's very healthy again. If it's like his right arm, then that would be a good fight. I'm not sure.
SPEAKER_01: So you are saying that Dadikian is going to dominate him? I saw only him pulling after the table with Prudnik and I think Prudnik was really tired after his match. It was not very easy.
SPEAKER_00: But do we know if Gyorgy had some other training match? Yes, we don't know. Well, I see that David is the favorite. Serhii? I pulled with Alex Kurdecha four days ago. Five days ago, left arm.
SPEAKER_00: i think my opinion left arm top roll sweet coke should go have much better to pro like alex burdage uh okay swedco has better pronator yes 100 he have better pronation and you know he have amazing endurance yeah and his top roll is
SPEAKER_00: something special, there's no kids move versus top role, you know, is this position is here maximum card open Georgii, I know this, because I put him right and I'm sure left arm he have same position too hard for everybody. I think it's very hard match very hard match.
SPEAKER_00: uh i give for uh for georgie 40 48 percent and 52 52 for daddy yes okay yeah i mean one of the reason that you know like i think georgia arm is like open on top roll is because also his arms are so big
SPEAKER_04: I don't think he can come any close. He has very big arms, you know. Anyway, so Ivan is saying that Dadikyan is clearly favorite, while you are saying that Dadikyan is barely favorite. Yes, yes. I would say 55-45. Oh, okay. So that's not that far, you are thinking. Yes. Okay. I thought that you are thinking something like 70-30 or something.
SPEAKER_04: 55. Yeah, 62. Okay, okay. Okay, so let's talk about... Did you guys watch the lady from Canada, Jocelyn versus Sarah Beckman? Did you guys see that match? Yes. Yeah, Jocelyn defeated Sarah 3-0. And now Jocelyn is pulling Egle.
SPEAKER_04: Jocelyn I think she's able to do like 140 kilo or something you know bench press and she's coming from the power lifting and she's very strong and she's still transferring her power into arm wrestling more and more every day. So how do you guys see this match? Well I see Adelia as the favorite.
SPEAKER_01: because sarah managed to stop a little but in the in the hook yes yeah but i think a little favorite mm-hmm
SPEAKER_00: I don't know about this match. When I say something, I know how guys train, what they do, how they have power, but here
SPEAKER_04: i'm not uh you don't have much knowledge about it yes yes about about this but um i don't know i don't know 50 50 50. is it now is the match that i will ask you both have very good experience about these outlets you bought coming yablonsky left yeah yeah
SPEAKER_01: Okay, who wants to go first? Ivan, you go. Extremely interesting match. There are different advantages. Georgii Dzeranov has maybe the best defensive hook position. And Kamil has...
SPEAKER_01: The best offense. The best attacking press with his left hand. And that is not very good for Georgii, I think. Because... Because he will allow Tamir to attack. Yes, but still he has that very best defensive position. So... But can I remind you something? But that best defense, you know, when Wagner put shoulder
SPEAKER_04: He was able to open, I think, a couple of times. Yes. Yeah, but that Di Dzeranov and today's Di Dzeranov are not the same Di Dzeranov. But I think that Kamil has stronger press than... Yeah. And also Kamil is not the same. No, he seems to be stronger and stronger. Yes. Judging from his video. Yeah. I see...
SPEAKER_01: some advantage in the speed for camille also yeah he's faster and that is also good for him difficult to predict i would say 50 50. can i ask you something do you think that this zero can win with outside or desire no needs to go inside um i think that the only
SPEAKER_01: way for Dzeranov to win is to hook Kamil and not from the very losing position. They should start equally. If he loses half a second, he would have big problems. Even with his very good defensive position.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, yeah. Another question. Do you think that, like, Laletin beat right arm, you know, this guy, I don't know, but he attacked his hand, you know. So there, Kamil is not going to attack there. Kamil is going to attack to his arm. And, like, four rounds, or I don't know how many rounds he pinned him, he won four too, but, like, many rounds that, you know, Laletin was able to bring Kamil down. Do you think that
SPEAKER_04: Laletin has stronger or weaker arm than Di Dzeranov. The arm power. What do you mean by arm power? More like arm power. Wherever Kamil is attacking, it's the arm. Vitaly was able to win multiple rounds.
SPEAKER_04: So do you think that there is a possibility for Di Dzeranov to still win with an outside move if Vitaly was able to do the same thing? Or Vitaly did it because he was also fast enough? Vitaly was fast and also Vitaly's proper is much better than
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, but you don't need a super top roll. I mean, like, he's giving you the hand anyways, you know, he's giving. So, he's just pressing your arm, you know, like, whenever you say his top roll is good, I mean, there is nobody that is trying to hook him or trying to top roll. Kamil is giving his wrist anyways, you know. Not with his left hand, I think. Not always with his left hand.
SPEAKER_04: Not always. We'll see. No, the reason I'm asking you this question, is there any possibility that Zyronov to win with the outside in the case that his arm is... I do not see that. You don't see that. Okay, so you are saying that Zyronov needs to block, you know, calm his pronator and then take him inside. Yes, I think that Zyronov's side pressure is not that good with pronated forearm position.
SPEAKER_04: Okay, so he is good this way, but not this way. And the strongest Dzeranov's move is side pressure with biceps. And Serhii, how do you see this match? I see this match, every position, every top row position for Dzeranov is loose.
SPEAKER_00: Yes, I think
SPEAKER_00: Kamil have too much pressure, left arm without wrist. And nobody have 100 kilograms for back pressure for control here. Kamil press with 100 kilograms easy. And nobody stop him. I think Devon Larratt very strong top roller. And for him not possible stop Kamil press.
SPEAKER_00: Talking about when they pull or now? Yes, yes, yes. Before, before. Before he was not trained, but still, you know, he was very convincing. Even if he was stronger, look like coming, what do you mean? Devon says that now, even now he's not ready for coming. Maybe, maybe not ready, but I pulled with the right arm and
SPEAKER_04: Dzeranov is master of hook. It's master of hook. Hook, Dzeranov win 100%. Other different move, Dzeranov lose. Do you remember, Ivan, when Laletin and Dzeranov pull left arm, Dzeranov won with the outside, you know. But of course, at that time, the opponent was also trying to top roll.
SPEAKER_01: And it seems to me that Dzeranov forgot how to use that move. Because when they pulled right hand, he had a different move.
SPEAKER_04: When they pulled, it was, I think, 110 kilos or something in the category. Even 100. Maybe 100, yeah. So I think that 100 is better for Dzeranov, while Laletin was still a skinny guy in 100 kilos. And now when it is super heavyweight, I think the weight gain helped more to Laletin than it did to Dzeranov, in my opinion, yeah. Let's see. Let's see. We will see. But I think Dzeranov is stylistically a dangerous opponent for Kamil.
SPEAKER_04: Because everyone is trying to go outside with Kamil and now finally we have someone going inside with Kamil. I think Kamil has more big chance in this match. I think in my opinion more big chance, more percent for winning. Okay, so let's go to another one. David Samusha versus Pauline, 95 kilo.
SPEAKER_00: I think Samusha. It's a very hard match, very tough match. I think Samusha because Pauline doesn't have the same endurance like Samusha. Maybe one or two rounds it's very hard, maybe Samusha loses, but after it's finished. So you are saying that Pauline may win one or two rounds,
SPEAKER_01: He can now win three times the win. Yes, I think it's not happening. Okay. And Ivan? Yes, I agree. I think the same. You think the same? I think that Samoche is more motivated. And also he gains weight. And he is getting ready especially for Paul. And I think that this time he will...
SPEAKER_04: Do you guys realize that Paul is also new in the sport? When I say new, it's not around 15 years. Especially after East vs West started, Paul progressed a lot. It was David's first match as well, after the pandemic. David improved a lot. David just only 2-3 days ago shared a photo, he's at 88 kilos.
SPEAKER_04: So just say that we have three and a half weeks left and then just say he will be 90 kilos. And Paul will be 95 on the scale, but next evening he will be 100 kilos. So there will still be 10 kilo difference. And I think it will be very, very tough match. Very tough match. Yeah, very tough. It's true. It's true. And Samusha now how many kilos? 100? Who? Samusha, how many now have kilograms? 88 kilo.
SPEAKER_04: Eight? Eighty-eight. Eighty-eight. Yeah. So it will be maximum 90, 91 kilos till the competition. Yes, yes, yes. Anyway, so let's go to the next one. We have incredible matches. Yeah, let's go to this crazy match. What's the crazy match? Every match crazy. No, no, this is different crazy. If Luka is not there, Matt must. Yes, yes, yes.
SPEAKER_04: Were you guys surprised when Matt beat Ongarbe? I was very surprised. Not that Matt won, but Matt to win that easy. Many people have questions if Ongarbe wasn't in his best shape. We don't know yet, but we can't take anything away from Matt's victory. How do you guys see this match? Nugo is also very, very powerful.
SPEAKER_01: I just thought about this match today. Match is very uncomfortable for Nuga because of his level. I think match is uncomfortable for most opponents. And as we remember that Nuga had problems against Petro when Petro added pronation and toproll in his... But in the last rounds, you know.
SPEAKER_01: But it was because Pietro realized how he had to pull Nuga. Not from the very beginning. And I think that Matt would take Nuga's wrist. And I didn't see Nuga pulling with floor press.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I don't think he can. I don't think he can, but maybe we will learn something new. But he is extremely powerful, and I think if he knew that move, if he practiced that move, he would be very good in this move also, in floor press, because of his bench press, because of his side pressure. I think he is very powerful. Just for now, I think that March has more chances.
SPEAKER_00: And Serhii? I think Nugo. You think Nugo is going to win? Yes, of course. I'm very want wins for Matt Mask because I very like so much with Matt Mask. He's very interesting athlete for me.
SPEAKER_00: I know how stronger Nugo because he two time win Peter Margarit and he win Peter Margarit one time with top roll. It wasn't really top roll, but yes, outside. Yes. Ford my opinion, Nugo have best of the best good
SPEAKER_00: good style for top rollers beat the rollers because he work like with all body here hold arm and he only and back and maybe you saw Devon Larratt match with Nugo it's not real match it's after pool training and Devon Larratt
SPEAKER_00: in not in professional table in normal table when they were not best of the best after pool he don't give for nougat nothing nothing nougat beat him maybe 20 times for my opinion total margarine and nougat this is two guys who top three one 105.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, but the after pulls, do they count, you know? Because people say that Moro Moro should give the belt to Devon, so should we take Devon's 105 belt to give to Nugo because of the practice match? No, no, no, no, no. Of course, of course, no. But Devon Larratt...
SPEAKER_00: very good pool in after pool no no i know i know i know i i'm just i'm just yes i think i think um i think uh 60 40 60 40. for for nugo for nugo and you want you think that it is like what is it like 53 47 for
SPEAKER_00: but good luck for matt musk i hope i hope he win and
SPEAKER_04: Yeah. Wins, wins, wins, against, against, against. Yeah. And see, another idiot is the same asking, my friend, I didn't even ignore what Levan said. We are doing that already. Last two days, you guys want something like an idiot all the time, you know, saying, repeating the same thing like parrots, you know, just, you know, come on, just be quiet. Just enjoy the show. We have, we are just anyways, you know, these people are just seriously super annoying, you know, I don't know who is sending them here, but yeah.
SPEAKER_04: So let's go to Artur Makaro versus Daniel Prokopcik.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know. 50-50. Daniel is your good friend. Yes, 50-50. 50-50 because it's really near Atlas with power. Yeah, me too. 50-50. It's near 50. I want to say Daniel, but I think it's not true because possible win for Makaro and for Daniel.
SPEAKER_00: And do you think that there is any possibility for Daniel to top role, Arthur? I think yes. We saw how good pulled Daniel to top role. Against Alain Zola. Yes.
SPEAKER_00: very good top roller you know yeah but alan zola is going more like this you know while you know like more like crushing side pressure with the spination you know yeah do you know i know it's true or not but for my opinion uh when makaro stopped it's 70 he lose matches
SPEAKER_00: I don't know. Maybe. But it's my opinion. I don't know why, but every time I think about a fast match, okay. But when the match is stopped, it's more hard for Makaro.
SPEAKER_01: Ivan, and now you are also from Makarov's side, probably. No. I think 50-50. I do not see Daniel Toprol in Makarov, but I see him going in hook, and I do not see Makarov to win Daniel quickly.
SPEAKER_01: So I think it will be a really tough match. Also endurance will determine the winner. Yeah, this is best of seven. So one needs to win four rounds. So I think it's going to be a long one.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, lately I think Daniel works more for his top role. And that gives a little more advantage to Artur because of his really strong wrist. But I'm not sure at all. I think 50-50. Okay, okay. So these are incredible matches, historical matches, like very, very big matches. And I hope people understand.
SPEAKER_04: Okay, let's go to the last three matches. Gennady Kvikvinya versus Ibrahim Sago. I think as of today, Gennady has 10 kilos more to lose. I think it's too much. Too much for Gennady. Too much need to lose weight and too fast. Can I ask you something? How much did you lose?
SPEAKER_00: when you pulled against Frank? 19. 19? Yes. You lost 19 kilos, so why can he not? Because... And you won. I am, I don't know, to my bones, sportsman, you know, like, I'm...
SPEAKER_00: control my protein control calories every morning cardio it's not like okay i don't eat five days or six days or something like this i'm eat vegetables everything control vitamins everything control but for my opinion for gnadi
SPEAKER_04: he lose he never lose weight i think for him it's the first time maybe and it's too hard he used to be 110 kilo and he said that he was losing weight to go 110 kilo but ivan would know better i think even you met him in uh in uh nine to five at nimirov we pulled him at 100 at europeans
SPEAKER_01: and uh several times at 110 at europeans and uh at worlds have you have you won against him i think uh i i think i counted uh it's about uh five three or six four in his favor so you guys are close a little bit i think he uh
SPEAKER_01: I was stronger with the left hand, because his left was not very good. But with his right hand, I think he had more wins than me. But I also won him several times. With the right hand? Yes. Okay. So how do you see this match, Ivan? If they pulled without losing weight.
SPEAKER_01: I would bet on Gennady. Of course. But that's not the situation. And if Gennady cuts it down, really cuts it down to 115, then I see more chances for Ibrahim. Because too many kilograms. 15-20 kilograms. And I think...
SPEAKER_04: to power effectively, he would need more time. But don't you remember that Devon was about 270 pounds? He was very near 125 and he went to 105 kilos against Petrenko. He still was strong. But of course Devon is more like a forearm thing, while Gennady's style is all about more horsepower.
SPEAKER_01: And also, I'm not sure about how healthy is Gennady, but he says that he's okay. That's another factor not in his favor. Because such things get worse when you lose weight also. Okay, so who's winning? So, I would say 50-50. Oh, 50-50. I would say 50-50, but...
SPEAKER_01: Or 52, 53 for Ibrahim. Okay. So you are saying that if Gennady can come there, you know, good, then 50-50. If Gennady is not as good as we are expecting, then... Yes, if Gennady doesn't lose any strength, which is impossible. Yeah, it's impossible. Then Gennady is the favorite. But if he loses 10%,
SPEAKER_01: 10%, then it's about 50-50, I think.
SPEAKER_00: And Serhii, you said Sago would win? I think yes, because Sago have not comfortable movement for Gennady. Remember match Gennady vs Devon Larratt. Devon Larratt every time go to this side because it's only biceps and Gennady have injury before in biceps and long time don't pull.
SPEAKER_00: uh and what if you cannot do that before ibrahim does no too fast ibrahim too fast okay too fast and they cannot have flow press very strong very strong flow press but this technique uh saddle i think it's too hard go to flop press because too much go with shoulders yes and hit too hard go to flop press uh i think 50
SPEAKER_01: 65-45 to Sago. But as we saw, Ibrahim had some problems with good defensive hooks. Against Reno, against good biceps. And before injury, Gennady was extremely good in his defensive position. When he won me, he won in a lone fight.
SPEAKER_00: Will he be that good on the turn of May? Yes, in this fight everything is important. Every little moment, biceps, lose weight, everything is important. Let's go to the last two matches. Tata Shinx vs Rustam Babayev. Rustam Babayev.
SPEAKER_00: 100%. After 10 days, I will have maybe training with him. After 10 days, you will train with him? Yes, we will meet in Switzerland. It's just two weeks before the event. No, no, no. Of course, it's not a real pool. It's only for technique and little training.
SPEAKER_04: power he give for me maybe secrets how I beat Ivan. Ivan, do you accept that Rustam Babaev is a true legend? I think that Rustam Babaev is the best hook bowler pound for pound and in the history of armwrestling also. Do you think that he was better than Hajim Razdoliev pound for pound in hook?
SPEAKER_01: Because what I saw that Haji Murad was beating him, he was still lighter. Yes, that's a difficult question, because Haji Murad was sometimes, one day he was stronger than Rustam. But in terms of accomplishments, in terms of both left and right,
SPEAKER_04: Yeah. If you count right under, Rustam is ahead. But only with right turn, I think that Zolaev won more waff than Rustam. Yes, but in terms of getting into hook position, Rustam was the best. You have seen Zolaev losing his wrist many times, but Rustam, I mean...
SPEAKER_04: Very seldom. Very, very seldom. Even John Bersink had hard times. Sometimes you said that I am one of the best in getting into hook. Listen, you are not one of the best. You are, I mean, you are, listen. I'm not the best, but I'm one of the best. But Rustam is the best in that movement. Listen, I don't know. Maybe his hand was stronger pound for pound than yours. But if I talk about yours,
SPEAKER_04: is not only about the strength. You have long arm, long reach, and your hand was
SPEAKER_04: like so quick, you know, he was like more like, you know, he was crashing, you know. Because he started from 65 kilograms. Yeah, yeah. I mean, he was just crushing side pressure with the bottom of his hand and incredible wrist curve. But someone like you, like it is very, very hard to get away because you have long reach. Rush time is like 172. What are you, 190, are you? 92, yes. 92, yeah. So you are 20 centimeters.
SPEAKER_04: taller and you have long reach. Of course, in your category, there are other guys also tall arm, but like from my point of view, you know, like people who has longer arms, it is, you know, like you can pull somewhere and it is out of the reach. And, but someone like you, you pull, you pull, you pull, you can still come, come, come, especially you don't do like always some crashing, but sometimes you were able to even come forward and do it. Yeah. You,
SPEAKER_04: Rustam, I don't know who else I can say. Petro is different animal. Petro is like pure wrist curve. And like Rustam has a lot of side pressure and yours is like very quick. And Petro is just holds you and just wrist curves and pins, you know, incredible. I think Petro's hand and wrist maybe even strongest.
SPEAKER_04: Well, Krasimir also had very good wrist. Yes, he has. I mean, he has even hooked Levan, you know, in 2016, I think, yes. Okay, so let's go to the... So, who's winning this match? Rustam winning or Todd winning or...? Well, I like both guys. But I think in terms of technique, Rustam is very uncomfortable for Todd.
SPEAKER_01: And he will supinate Todd. And in hook position, he seems to be the favorite. So you are saying that if the match goes inside, Rustam is the favorite? Yes, if it goes inside, Rustam is the favorite.
SPEAKER_04: Do you think that since for many years Tadi is training his pronator, do you think it is possible to keep Rustam's wrist flat? Not take but just like this? Do you think there is any possibility the match to be like in a neutral position for side pressure? No pronator could be safe against Rustam.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, okay, okay. Not now, but not Todd. Todd is not so good, I think, in this. He's good against top rollers. But we'll see. We'll see. Rustam posts seldom. So you are saying that Rustam is the favorite? Yes, I think 53, 55 to Rustam.
SPEAKER_04: And you think in the same way? I think 60-40. Oh, wow. Oh, that's interesting. Because a lot of people are... I have two percentage for my mobile. So I need to disappear. Okay, so let me ask you the last match. Vitaly versus Michael. And then your answer if you... I think that will be... I like both efforts. I respect them.
SPEAKER_01: But I think that it will be the first time. I think that Vitaly could win quickly. He would be one of the first guys to do that. You are saying that Michael normally stops people, but Vitaly will be the first one to play. I think he would stop everyone, but not current Vitaly. Because of Vitaly's level, he is...
SPEAKER_00: So you are saying that Vitaly right now is in incredible shape? And Serhii, how do you see this, my Serhii? I think Vitaly have power, same like Arbaz Gasparini.
SPEAKER_00: And it's a very hard match for Vitaly. And of course, for Michael Todd, a very hard match for both athletes. My opinion, Vitaly win.
SPEAKER_00: How? In which way? I think first, he has unreal endurance for super heavyweight. Very good endurance. You're talking about Vitaly? Vitaly, Vitaly, Vitaly. You think Vitaly has good endurance? You know, he has a very good recovery, you know, like first round.
SPEAKER_00: after second round and for him need only one minutes and he already against with not he have good endurance like in fight you know in the pocket yeah but he he more faster cover like up again yes i understand yeah and after round two or three
SPEAKER_00: Michael Todd, I think he has endurance in the same level, but Vitalik has more good recovery and maybe 3-2 for Vitalik. So you are saying 3-2, so it means that
SPEAKER_04: There will be rounds that Michael will stop Vitaly and then will beat him. I see a lot of falls for Vitaly. I see fall. I see maybe wins, maybe fall. But I think two rounds. Two rounds. Do you think that there is a possibility to match to stop and Vitaly to win?
SPEAKER_04: Yes, I think yes. We saw this with Morozov. But Morozov, Vitaly's left arm, it's not the best arm. Morozov also said that he got injured on round one, round two from the elbow, he said. And do you think it may be a reason as well? Because Vitaly versus Dave Chaffee, Dave Chaffee is not known to have very good endurance either. But first time they pulled, they had a war, you know.
SPEAKER_00: And like we have seen Vitaly losing against some of the top rollers in the past. Do you think there is a possibility? But do you think Vitaly is going to win with it like this? No, no, no. Look, Vitaly have very strong rising and very strong fingers. And of course, this is fighting strap.
SPEAKER_00: And Vitaly, maximum more grip, maximum more grip and pull top roll, not flop, not like a mess. So you are saying that he will climb up, climb up. Yes, climb up, climb up, climb up. And after one millimeter, touch pads and win. And I think it's every round.
SPEAKER_00: hmm only this i see only this other flow press not possible flash pin win michael i think it's two maybe one rounds michael not ready and uh the target win but not not more i see only
SPEAKER_00: Up, up, up, up, maximum little work with back pressure against up, up, up, and after push. And what is Michael's winning chance? Of course, Michael have two chance for win. You said 3-2 Vitaly, but how close do you see?
SPEAKER_00: I think 53, 52, 48. You are seeing a very close match. Yes, very close match. Very close match. Maybe, I know Vitalik said before, for him it's he ready to flash pin and to maximum
SPEAKER_00: good pool, a maximum fast fight. But my opinion is mistake. Need to have planning like Ermes. Stay in center.
SPEAKER_00: And more, more, more, more, more. Because when you pulled with Michael Todd near pads, Michael Todd too strong and you lose too much power. You lose too much power in this. But in center, it's like maybe 10% more easy. 10% more easy change your grip, you know, without losing your power. Yeah. Okay. Another question.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know if you follow but they go back and forth. I see everything about arm wrestling. It's a very interesting match and only Gasparini gave for Levan a hard match before.
SPEAKER_00: And, of course, Levan very excited about this match. Maybe I have same match, I am excited. Maybe I have same match before hard match. Of course, I will be excited because RMS progress, Levan progress, and you know, everybody think he stay more stronger, but again, he have same power, you know, and we will see very near match.
SPEAKER_00: very hard match. And I hope Lewand healthy now much better like fight like last fight. Because I know he have before problem with
SPEAKER_00: with hormones with I don't remember how this in English and he he feel bad but I think this much it's same near matches same years matches and
SPEAKER_00: i hope i hope really i hope uh someone's uh maybe thermos wins levan maybe two rounds maybe win this much because the you know every arm wrestling is super heavyweight don't think about levan because it's like levan here everybody here you know so everybody's target is to beat levan
SPEAKER_00: yes only one round only one round pin the one and everybody stay more stronger next day you know yes but they need to see hope believe believe believe it's possible you need only believe it's possible yeah i i i i very good to spoke with uh ms
SPEAKER_00: And the one Ermes to both good guy, and good luck for good luck for everybody for preparation without injury without everything. But really, I want to have more big motivation training, maybe I will win this match.
SPEAKER_04: By the way, you look much healthier when you lose weight. Oh, yes, yes. You look younger and healthier. I am much better sleeping. Yeah, I understand. And Arm Shark Armor thing, I think it's Sharkovich. Yes, it's Sharkovich. He says, good luck, Kalina. Hello from Miami. Yes, I know this guy. Maybe two years we worked together. I trained this guy online.
SPEAKER_04: One last question. When Ermes and Levan were pulling for the first time, before the match, did you believe more in Ermes or now you believe more in Ermes?
SPEAKER_00: ending uh i'm joking about her mess before this fight i'm joking about her mess and they say uh you know i am zero believe zero believe zero now now how much i will tell you something or or or rms or nobody
SPEAKER_00: Oh, so you say that only Ermes can do or nobody can do? Or nobody can. This time, it's my opinion. Before, yes, of course. But when I saw when he stopped Levan, I closed my mouth. Me too, me too. I was like, is this real? I closed my mouth and said, okay, I'll never say about something bad for Ermes. And the other day, three days ago, when I had Levan on the podcast,
SPEAKER_04: And Lewa just started calling his weights are not real. He should put them on scale like Ermes' weights. And he said, if Ermes wants to learn about armwrestling, he can come. I can teach him how to train in Tbilisi.
SPEAKER_04: And Ermes went there and he fired back, you know? So now I see that this is what I needed to see that Ermes, Ermes is like, like in his head, he's not losing in his head. He's like, yes, he's ready to bite. You understand? So Lewand really provoked him, provoked him. And now it became not in a bad way, but good way. It became a little bit personal. So now you will be like, not only arm wrestling, but like more like
SPEAKER_04: You know, maybe, maybe.
SPEAKER_00: After my match with Ivan, I will go to Italy to train with Ermes. Let's see. Let's see how it will be. Anyways, thank you very, very much. Thank you. Yeah, it's good to see you. And then see you in the show in three weeks. Yes, yes. And thank you, everybody. Ford... Yes. Take care. Thanks, everyone.
