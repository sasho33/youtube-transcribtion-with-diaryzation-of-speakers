SPEAKER_03: Let me check and then we start. Yep. We are live. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Now. Hello. Hello. Hello everyone. And today we have two guests that one of them you guys have seen on the East versus West stage before Ryan Ballinger. Ryan, am I pronouncing your name correctly? Ballinger or?
SPEAKER_03: It's actually Belanger. How do you say again? Like Belanger. Belanger. Okay, okay. Yes, sir. This is not my native language. Sorry about this. Okay, Belanger. Everybody over here says Belanger too. Oh, okay.
SPEAKER_03: my family yeah and our other guests will be on our stage first time ellen force uh ellen hitman ford am i correct yeah and ellen we when did we first time talk about inviting you to east versus west and didn't happen was it like two years ago or it was the it was your first east versus west
SPEAKER_03: Oh, probably the first on the paper. Yes. First one was like when, when, uh, Matt mask, uh, when they pull, but I think it was after that one. Yeah. Okay. I know it was really early. So yeah, that's only a couple of years now you've been going. Yeah, it has been with the first one. This is now four year finishing on, on June, June 12th. It is four years finishing. Yeah. Oh, wow.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah. Okay. So let me start directly into it. Um, what is the match going inside or outside? That's the big question, isn't it? I think that's the only question. We're both going to say the opposite. I mean, I think it's going outside, but I mean, uh, if it goes inside, I I'm not, I'm not contrary to what people pop, but people believe it's not over.
SPEAKER_02: I mean, I can, I I've hung with, I've hung with many high level pullers inside. Um, I know Belanger or Ryan, I've seen you, I've seen you pull, uh, your hook looks amazing. I'm not underestimating you by any means. Um, but, uh, yeah, you're, I'm still in the game if it goes inside. That, that, that, that is a popular opinion. People think that like.
SPEAKER_03: There is a possibility to win with Flash Pin. And they also believe that if it goes inside, people from US, they think that Ryan is going to kill you. But from people from Canada, they think that it will still be a war. And Ryan, what is your opinion? I mean, it's definitely hard to call.
SPEAKER_00: But, you know, obviously, I think I can get him inside. And, you know, I know he can pull on a hook. I've seen him, you know, most recently at an RBJ match. He did very well on a hook. Yep. The only thing, you know, I love RBJ. You just never know if he's off the couch or if he's training. And there's no, you know, no dish to you, obviously. Yep. But...
SPEAKER_00: I mean, I think I do very well on being able to get it inside. So I feel confident. You know, my hand's strong. So, I mean, we'll see. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, yeah. Yeah, I was very surprised when Allen gave such a tough match when inside because those years...
SPEAKER_03: Rob Wiggins, he was known to have very strong hook, you know, with that incredible bicep power. And yeah, Alan, like I have seen your matches and you are surprisingly dangerous.
SPEAKER_03: And people may think that like, this is just like one super hits, but, but what was surprising, uh, wasn't that hit, but like your performance, even, even the match was in the position that your opponent wanted, you know, that which you didn't prepare, but you had to pull. And now people tells me that I'm not going to give the name, but they say that you are in your best ever shape.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah, I really am. I went to provincials recently, got inducted into the Hall of Fame finally, having pulled for 35 plus years, finally got into the Hall of Fame. And I decided just for fun to go into the tournament and I wanted to test my right arm, went in the super heavies and no one even slowed me down. And Ryan, did I pick
SPEAKER_00: uh bad matchup for you would you would you prefer someone who goes inside i think this matchup is easy easier for me um than if it was like an iraqi style uh really you know what i mean and now alan poe's a bit different yes he could top roll a couple different ways um
SPEAKER_00: But, you know, I don't think it's a bad matchup. I mean, you could argue it's a bad matchup for him and it's a bad matchup for me. You know, depending on where you think it's going to go. Yeah. No, what I'm trying to ask you is that, like, is Lightning fast? Do you think that is an issue or no issue? Maybe round one, you know, round one, maybe kind of a feeler.
SPEAKER_00: um i've you know i've i've beat coach ray all three rounds but i'm known to kind of maybe fumble that first round because i'm feeling around and uh you know trying to find something yeah so um yeah i don't know i yeah
SPEAKER_00: I've seen Alan ever since I came into the arm wrestle. And even before then, I was kind of watching it. But I knew Alan, you know, from UAL days and all that with the Todd Hutchins floors and stuff. So when you gave me the name, I was excited to take it because he's always been kind of one of the best in North America at that 198.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, you have been asking, like you have been joining the podcast, right? And all the time, you're mentioning some names, if I'm not mistaken, you mentioned Sasho, and maybe a few other names. Yeah. And so
SPEAKER_03: Yeah. The only thing is that I was asking is that if it is stylistically, you know, uh, worrying, you know, for your best stylistically that this fit, you know, and how do you consider yourself, Ryan? Can you do, do you consider yourself someone, uh, fast or normal or slow? How, how do you see yourself? I think like, uh, I think my hand and wrist is fast, so I may not have the whole hit.
SPEAKER_00: But position-wise, I could do pretty good with my hand and wrist. It's pretty quick. So for position, I might be right there.
SPEAKER_03: But that's all you need, right? With the go, you know, I have seen some of your matches. You are using your wrist so well, so well, quick. Yeah. But you are not a flash pinner, but that's something different, you know? Yeah. You're going with the whole body and then having here, but to stop Allen, you will probably need the hand speed first, huh? To control this pronator. Right. I agree. And, and, you know, I've,
SPEAKER_00: You know, I train with Chad Silver's and Hunter Knopf's and they are lightning quick. So training with them every week, you know, I kind of at least is used to somewhat, you know, faster guys. I don't know if Alan's faster, but.
SPEAKER_03: I'm at least used to training for the speed. Alan, let's talk very openly. Whenever you look at Ryan, do you see someone who is not at your experience level and you are like, he won't be able to stop me, that kind of thoughts you have?
SPEAKER_02: So I guess when you first offered me the match, I was pretty confident. I'm like, yeah, I'll take that match. I didn't even think about it. He's a pure hooker, pretty much. I'm very familiar with those guys that everybody's trying to hook me to stop me. So I'm very confident. I'm going into it very confident. But at the same time, I never underestimate. I never do. I mean, he does...
SPEAKER_02: He really does have the move to stop me, but this comes down to whether he can or not. I am confident. I seem unstoppable right now. We'll see. I'm anxious. I'm excited for it. I'm sure.
SPEAKER_03: is it important to pull at this stage but you know like how this match happened like this match happened because like ryan last year he okay first he won the qualification event correct right and then and then we gave him a match against coach ray and then he was a dominant victory in orlando
SPEAKER_03: So when somebody comes to the East versus West and wins, like I feel like I have very limited room on the stage. Some people,
SPEAKER_03: complains that like they they say like we see the like same atlas when we say like same atlas we invited 150 different athletes till today so it is not like like i mean how to say east versus west stage is like really high level
SPEAKER_03: And if somebody wants to be on that stage, really needs to be better than the guys who are competing. I mean, of course, we need to give chances to the new guys, but you can't complain that to see Artem Morozov
SPEAKER_03: often you can't complain you see Vitaly Laletin often because if somebody wants to be in that place they need to be better than them you know it doesn't mean that we are not going to give chances so Ryan won his first match and for one year he has been waiting patiently and I felt like you know I had to do it and a few times I even uh kind of apologized him am I corrected that they didn't thank him for his patience but
SPEAKER_03: It's not because I don't want to invite, but it is because I don't have room sometimes, you know. And so, and then I was looking for an opponent for Ryan. And then I saw you taking me and Roberts. You said it's time for the, you know, East versus West stage. And then I was like, yeah, yeah, that's perfect timing. Sometimes I need to be reminded.
SPEAKER_03: And then this match happened, and it's a beautiful matchup. A lot of people I saw, they don't know much about, and they are like, who are these guys or something, you know? But that is how Ermes Gasparini was at the beginning. Because they are only following the big stage, not everything all over the world.
SPEAKER_03: And yeah, so I think it will be a beautiful match, beautiful match. I don't know where the match is going to go. If I can, you know, if I may, I want to share my thoughts that there is a possibility, Alan, to go direct to the pad. And there is a possibility that Ryan puts you in hook. And if it goes to the second option, then I don't think it will be easy.
SPEAKER_03: Hey, Ryan, do you expect an easy win if you hook? Like, Alan, do you think, like, okay, only thing I need is just to hook him? Or do you think that there will be more, you know, problems, you know, even if you can't hook him? Yeah, if I'm being honest, in my mind, I mean, that's my thought, right? Like, if I can get him inside to my safe zone, you know, I'll be good to go.
SPEAKER_00: But you know, he can pull on a hook too. So you don't, I mean, you just, you just really never know, man. Um, I'm definitely, I'm definitely strong. Uh, and, and I even, I think there's a good chance, like if he gets my hand, that, that arm ain't going very far either. So you believe that even your hand goes, you can still arm muscle without your wrist? And do you, do you think that, do you think that the strap favors you or him?
SPEAKER_00: Or it doesn't matter, you know? Man, that's another tricky question, right? Because he probably knows all the little, he knows 30 years worth of tricks and all that and the strap set up. So, but, you know, I mean, generally it's, you know, it's said to favor the power guy, but I feel very comfortable in the straps. So, cool. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: You're going to run there right away. Well, I don't, to be honest. Okay. One thing I wanted to say is if, if we do end in the hook and up in the hook, you've never felt a hook like mine. That's all I'm going to say about that. It's not, not that it's not that how powerful it is. It's just different. Yes. Two straps.
SPEAKER_02: I, I don't go for straps. I never go for the strap, but if it, if, if my hand or wrist fails or I don't feel comfortable, I don't have control and it just happens, then it happens. I don't, I don't, I don't know that I've ever really intentionally slipped. There might be a couple times in my whole career, um, where it was the right choice to do. And I intentionally slipped, but generally, uh, I'm, uh, I'm trying to make something happen and then it happens. So, um,
SPEAKER_02: And yeah, I'm comfortable. Have you ever agreed to go to direct strap with your opponent? Not in the first match. No. Okay. So maybe you see this like inavailable and then you say, okay, it's going there. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That was happening actually at provincials with, um, with Ivan Carnegie and all the big guys, they're all like, you want to go straps right away? I'm like, nope, no, I don't want to go straps because they knew that they would have had, they feel like they would have had something on me in the straps.
SPEAKER_02: But I was able to pin them outside of the strap, so I didn't need to go there. Oh, did you win all your matches without the strap? Yeah. Shoot, no, I don't remember. There might have been one that went to strap, but I can't remember. Oh, that was not. Yeah, it was a guy that I don't really know ended up slipping and going to the straps. I think he intentionally slipped. Can you mention us some of the names that you have wins against? Sure.
SPEAKER_02: One thing you're going to know about me, Engin, is I'm horrible with names. Oh, the remembering. Okay. The main two was Ivan Carnegie, and in that event was Ivan Carnegie and Tiny, they call him, Jason Constantini. You know those two guys? No, no, I mean throughout your career. Oh, throughout my career? Yeah. Oh, I've got...
SPEAKER_02: I don't know. I have wins on everybody at some point or another. Honestly, I go to tournaments and just look around and I'm like, yeah, I've beat that guy, beat that guy, beat that guy. I've been arm wrestling so long that there isn't too many people that I haven't beat. Even with the two super matches I had with RBJ that he came out ahead, I think I still have more wins on him than he does on me.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, and it's impressive, yeah. And Ryan, you are thinking it may be a day that Rob Wiggins wasn't really in good shape. Oh, he was. 100% he was. Yeah, come on, come on, Alan. You can't stop Ryan believing what he wants, right? No, fair enough. Fair enough. I'm joking. I got to be able to sleep. I got to be able to sleep at night, right? Yeah, fair enough.
SPEAKER_02: no i i actually going into that last match i had with um with rvj i was super confident i thought he is going to get destroyed but he came in a totally different person uh like he was very on very strong um there was a bad call yeah there was some really bad calls if you watched that match i still think i should have won that match and
SPEAKER_02: I expected to win that match, and then I was going to be knocking on your door after that, and I was going to be like, look, I'm ready for East versus West. But it didn't work out that way, so we ended up here. And I'm only better since then, even, I believe. When was that? That was about a year ago now. It was at the AWC. Okay. AWC event, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: And, Alan, do you think you are going to be invited after your next match again? Invited to where? East versus West? Yeah, after your next match, do you think you will be invited again? See, look at Ryan. Ryan is going like... Well, after I win, I damn well better be invited. That's why I'm coming, man. I'm going to come and show you. Yes, no, I really want to be involved.
SPEAKER_02: Well, nobody comes to lose. No, absolutely not. No. But one thing about me you'll notice, that you'll know, and it's something that I often share, I go to almost every event, every match scared. I don't care who it is. I go to a tournament where I know, I look at everybody, I'm like, I've beat all these guys before. I'm going to go in the tournament and it's going to go for fun.
SPEAKER_02: But I'm scared. I'm like, oh, shit. He's who knows. You know, you never know who's got a target on you and shooting like just training and looking at your face, wanting to beat you, you know, and or some of these new people coming out of the woodwork nowadays. Holy crap. They're so they come out first time you see them and they're already at a high level because they're just like in their basement training their butts off.
SPEAKER_02: So I never underestimate that. I've made that mistake a couple of times, went into a matches overconfident and, uh, and paid for it, got, got pinned. And I was like, what the hell am I doing? Why did I do that? So I don't do that anymore. I go in scared and I want to feel the nerves. I want to feel a little bit scared going into it. Yeah, that's definitely a good thing. Definitely a good thing. I'm the same. I'm the same exact way. Uh,
SPEAKER_03: You know, like you said, you could be a guy you've beaten 10 times and you just still get out there and you're, you know, just so focused. Yeah, so by no means do I underestimate you. And Ryan, do you think Allen will be invited anytime soon after your match? Listen, I like to say both. That's my job. So you can't blame me.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, it all depends on you if you want to invite him back losing his first match. I don't know. Say again? Can you repeat again? I said it all depends on you whether you want to invite him back after he loses his first match. Oh, okay, okay. So you are saying that only if you give him a favor and then invite him after he loses. Okay, okay, I understand. Exactly. Well, I got a question for you, Engin.
SPEAKER_03: Arsen you going to invite me back regardless? Regardless? Regardless if you're going to invite me back because that will make me relax. Listen, if it was up to me, I would organize this every month and every event would be 20 Supermatches and I would just invite as many people as possible. But you know that this is a global league and a lot of people are waiting for opportunity. It is not like, you know, England is
SPEAKER_03: like someone important and inviting or not, but it is, I'm just trying to be fair. You understand as much as possible to like, to be have the same distance, you know, with, with all the athletes from,
SPEAKER_03: all over the world, doesn't matter where they are from. And so that is why, you know. But the reason I'm asking this kind of question is just trying to stir the pot so you guys hear something and trigger, you know, you before the mess, you know. That was actually interesting. That's an interesting question from Alan because he's our, are you a little, are you worried? Am I worried that I'm going to lose? Yeah, otherwise you wouldn't ask such questions.
SPEAKER_02: Like, but like I said, anything's possible, right? I don't believe I'm going to lose. I mean, Ryan, you said this, you said it, you nobody goes into a match thinking that they're gonna lose. I I truly believe I'm going to win. I like for instance, what what is what weight are you? What are you coming in? You look like you look thick. Arsen you cutting for? I'll be cutting a little bit. I'm usually right around
SPEAKER_03: 99. So what's that? 218, 217, 219. I would cover about there. There is a message. It says this is Allen Ford's retirement match. Ryan is too strong. Brandon Woodson, he's saying this. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: I don't know. I'm never retiring. So that's not an option. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It just, uh, we, we are just trying to provoke you so that you, you, you would come with even, uh, more, you know, what's that? I'm a pretty happy, easy going guy until I'm up to that table. And you're, you're, I'm sorry, but you're my fucking enemy.
SPEAKER_02: at that time and then we could be best friends afterwards i don't care but i i need to i need to kill you like i'm not called the hitman for no reason there's there's multiple reasons multiple uh uh interpretations of the hitman take people out so i i really think that you you this is probably this is a great match for you like if if if you do well against me that's gonna it's gonna tell you something i mean i'm i've been top
SPEAKER_02: level for a long time um i've held i'd have have held the top spots in ontario and canada for i don't even know 10 15 years um and that's not because i wasn't competing and uh even in north america i think at one point when i actually went over and competed i was i think i made it to second in north america just under todd hutchings so like
SPEAKER_02: You're in it deep here, Ryan. I don't know your history so much or how long you've been arm wrestling for because I actually couldn't find a lot on you. So I'm assuming you're newer, like five years maybe. One second, Ryan. Let me translate if there is some language barrier between you guys. He says that you are in trouble. Okay. I did. I think you are.
SPEAKER_00: That's good. That's what we want. And right now, let's hear from you. I was going to say, with you saying, you know, this is the strongest and best shape you've ever been. At the minimum, you're going to have to be that to get through my arm. Of course you're going to say that. I don't say things that ain't true. But I know, you know, I know the talent I train with. I know the, you know, the
SPEAKER_02: The guys that I've beaten, I think some of them kill you and some of them might not. So you know what team I'm part of, right? No, I don't. Ottawa High Hookers. I don't know if you've heard of them. And we're a branch of it. My team is a Valley High Hookers. So I trained with Ottawa for years and years, and I moved and started a branch of that group. We're called the Valley High Hookers because we're in the Ottawa Valley.
SPEAKER_02: Um, we have just within my group, we have quite a few top level pullers and then go to Ottawa. Obviously there's all those guys are including Devon. I mean, last, I don't want to, I'm not going to say it. Forget it. Last time I was fooling around with Devon, I was pinning them. So, but it wasn't on an arm wrestling table. It was like on the, off to the side and stuff. I was blowing my mind. I'm like looking at my arm going, Oh my God, this thing is so amazing.
SPEAKER_03: It's been very surprising. It's surprising me lately. Every time. Please, please stop because now Ryan is Ryan is sending me a private message and you can cancel this match. Ryan. Yeah. Devon gets beat on a practice table all the time. You know, but yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Well, yeah, I mean, but, you know, I'm never intimidated. You know, if you told me, if you called and said you're pulling LeVon in six weeks, I'll go pull him. You know, it'll be a half second each match, but I'm not scared to pull anybody. You know, I pull, I pull every tournament I go to, I pull supers, I pull 242s, you know, all the classes. So, you know.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, let me hear more clearly. Ryan, what is your winning chance against Allen? I'd say 60-40. 60-40? And Allen? I don't know. 80-20? 80-20? Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Okay. Do you know what I want to hear? The confidence. I want to say something, though. You don't know me very well.
SPEAKER_02: But to be honest, I'm not a confident person when it comes to arm wrestling. I will. I'm like, I, like I said earlier, I go into any event going, oh fuck. He's here. He's here. Like, oh shit. I don't have a chance. You ask any of my friends. I'm like, I would go to them and be like, oh fuck. Did you see so-and-so's here? Like, what, how should I beat this guy? Like, I'm very not confident in arm going into it. I like it like that over time. It's showed me that I should be confident, but I still, I still am not.
SPEAKER_03: I always ask people for advice. What should I do against this guy? Dude, just do your thing, man. You're the hit man. This guy who is not confident believes that he's going to win 80%. Imagine if you're confident. That's what I'm saying.
SPEAKER_03: So it just means that you are in big trouble, right? That when he is not confident, he believes 80%. Imagine if he was a competent person, it would be probably 100-0. So in backside of his mind, it says that you have no chance. Well, no, I did say he has a chance. But yes, I'm definitely on the side of I'm going to kill him. Sorry. Yeah. So, you know, so I'm not sorry.
SPEAKER_00: Some men like to talk about what they're going to do. I like to just go up there and do it. I'll tell you 60-40 here. And when that thing gets sucked inside, sorry. We'll see, man. We'll see. I'm excited for it. How about Ryan, if he goes inside? At that point, what's your chance? 100%.
SPEAKER_02: 100, okay. What if I shoot a hook on you and just look at you and be like, what? I'll kick you under the table. I like this. Oh shit, you're not allowed to do that, are you? I'll make you elbow foul. Okay. I've been known to use that too. It's a usable tool. Is it after you secure the win?
SPEAKER_03: what like you're gonna go inside and look at his face oh if i if i'm dominating yeah absolutely i'll play well you know it's best of five so it is like two zero you winning in the round three you would take the risk you think or you would just like i'm not a gambler at all i secure the win
SPEAKER_03: If I secured a win and we want to pull again, I definitely would try out. Yeah. But I don't fuck around. Yeah. It is better. I'm not playing it either. I want to play it all either. Okay. And Ryan, what are your teammates thinking about this match? Have you ever pulled Brandon Alicester or Adam Wojcicki, Alan? I pulled Brandon Alicester.
SPEAKER_02: It was my first time on the Mac table. I do not like set grips at the time. That's part of the reason why I never really compete. I went and competed with the first WAL event. I didn't like it. I don't like not being able to feel the person before we go. So I don't think I was. He beat me. So, but that being said,
SPEAKER_02: i have won ever since in the mac with mac and i even asked for another match with him and he doesn't he doesn't even want a part of me now when was this match uh the first mac event so mac mac one okay okay do you do you do you think that your shape right now is better oh yes well i'm pretty sure do they not does he not train with doug allen
SPEAKER_02: Because Doug Allen, I destroyed Doug Allen. Like, he wasn't even there. Okay. I actually felt bad for him, to be honest. And I'm not trying to be cocky. I felt bad because I thought the match was way closer than that. I saw that match. Yeah. When you say that you are not trying to be, but you think you are not trying, but you are? Not trying to be cocky? Yeah. Allen right.
SPEAKER_02: I'm not trying to be cocky. It's coming out cocky because I dominated and I crushed him. So I don't know how to say that nicely. Like, how do you say you kick everybody's ass and not sound cocky?
SPEAKER_03: Alan, yeah, those guys from East, really, they should be studying some of you guys about trash talk, but of course, everyone is different. Some likes it, some don't like it. I'm not a trash talker. I'm not trying to trash talk. It's just the truth. Listen, that is even better. You are doing that naturally. Some people are forcing themselves, but it's naturally, the way you are is very provoking.
SPEAKER_02: Am I wrong, Ryan? Isn't it probably? I feel like he's trying to be, but it ain't bothering me at all. Ah, okay. That's fine. Yeah, it ain't bothering me at all. I'm not a guy to play a head game before the match to try to win, like to try to get in your head ahead of time. I'm really not. It could go either way. I honestly believe that, but I am confident. I'm the strongest I've ever been. I'm surprising myself every time I go to an event.
SPEAKER_02: I know the level I've been at when I've had crazy awesome wins like in the past. And I'm above that now. Things are really clicking right now. So I'm confident. I really am. That's it. Yeah. Anyway, so let's talk about some other matches. Alan, do you know Arsen Kacetarian?
SPEAKER_03: arson no i'm thinking i know arson lilia that's that's the guy that beat andrei sharkovich in the arlington east versus west he's originally from armenia no i don't know him very well again sorry okay and and you probably uh how do you see that match against pauline ryan wow well he's competing against pauline yeah he's yeah
SPEAKER_00: Um, I think, I think Paul's just leveled up since, uh, man, who did he lose to? Um, crazy. So I think, I think he's leveled up quite a bit since crazy. I'm not saying he wasn't high level then, but you know, it seems like, uh, you know, it was training that he switched up and all that is definitely working. Um, after watching his, uh, last match with David, um,
SPEAKER_00: So I'd have to say Paul Linn is probably this 70-30 favorite. Paul Linn is who I want a match with. I've been calling him out for a while now. Ryan, do you think Allen will get a Paul Linn match after your match? Again, if you want to give him a gift for a loss and you let him pull Paul, sure. Give Paul a gift or me a gift? Give you a gift after losing.
SPEAKER_02: So you really have no clue then about me, right? Honestly. I probably know more about you than you know about me. Okay, cool. Then you're confident. That's great.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, that's good. That's good. That's what I want. That's what I want. Of course, with the border, but that fired up to competitors. Incredible. Yeah. So let's talk. Today, I set a match. I don't know how you exactly pronounce his name, but the guy Rickert, Rickert from like, originally from South Africa, but lives in Australia.
SPEAKER_03: And do you know how to pronounce his name? Do you guys know him? No, I'd have to see the name. I'm not sure. Ricard Bornman? Yeah, Ricard. Yeah, okay, Ricard. I don't know how to pronounce it. I think the last person I've seen him pull was Devon Underwood, probably. And how did that match go? He killed Devon. Oh, okay. And he's going to pull against Wallace. Wallace?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, Wallace also just recently beat, I think, Marcio Barbosa, Rambet and other guys, but yeah. So obviously this Ricard guy, he earned his spot, so he's good, right? Yeah, I mean, people say that he's number one in Australia. And yeah, I don't know. But they say he's very, very strong and he's very happy to get that opportunity. He's a young guy.
SPEAKER_03: And I'm very, very happy when people are excited to pull at the best stage against the best guys. Their excitement just makes me remember my first years and how hungry I was for success and proving myself. And now whenever I see his happiness, he sends me a message. He was very, very happy. I love it. I love it. And how do you see this match, Ryan? I think you know both guys.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. I mean, to me, this is one of the it's probably a 50 50 match. If you're kind of comparing maybe a couple of opponents that they each face that have faced each other in the past. I would say that I'd give the edge to Wallace, but it's going to be I think it's going to be a war. Mm hmm. Maybe 55.
SPEAKER_02: 45. But you don't have any opinion because you don't know the guys, right? Well, no, I don't know the South Africa. Africa is always South Africa. Yeah. I don't know him as well as I do Wallace. That's why I was leaning towards Wallace. But yeah, sorry. No, I don't. People who know
SPEAKER_03: both guys, they think that it is a very interesting match. They may go either way, yeah. And so... That's always entertaining if it's close like that. Yeah, yeah. I mean, we will see. We will see. Like, you never know, my friend, until you set the match and they pull. You never know. You know, even 5% difference can be a domination. Huge, yeah. Yeah. And now we have Fia Rysak versus Elin Ianham.
SPEAKER_03: I think, listen, the similar names from country to country,
SPEAKER_03: It just sounds, you know, different, you understand? There is a, just say, we have David Samusha, the same name you would pronounce like David over there, but his name is David. Like Ivan Matushenko, a lot of people are calling him Ivan, but it's not Ivan, it is Ivan. So that's why I don't know how to pronounce some names. And do you guys, are you guys familiar with Elin from Sweden?
SPEAKER_03: elena is a rising star very very strong girl and fear i say yeah i've seen that i've seen her actually yeah fear fear is a legend but no doubt anyone who doesn't think fear um is a legend and they don't know about uh arm wrestling fear is the only person in the east first west league that is holding the belt
SPEAKER_03: and her last match was also against another lady from sweden marine bergstrom and now one more lady from sweden and do you guys have any prediction about this match or not super familiar am i super familiar yeah i've seen i've seen a little bit um i'm sorry i already forgot her name um i saw a little bit
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I saw a couple videos of her. I mean, she looks very good, but it'd be hard to bet against Fia. I mean, she looks so strong, dominant. And she's, I think, in her prime. She seems very strong. Anyway, so let's go to another match. Wagner Bortalato versus Manuel Batalla.
SPEAKER_03: manuel is from italy and he is waff super heavyweight champion with left arm and wagner portalado is a legend from brazil and they will pull a left arm match yeah it's hard to call on wagner because wagner's got he's so he's so explosive right so if he if he hits if he explodes in the right place at the right time
SPEAKER_02: He's going to be dominant. So it's hard to bet against him or for him because it's also his kryptonite as well because he's so explosive and so like, I don't know, it's kind of all over the place that he can kind of put himself in a bad position as well. That's how I see it anyway. But if he applies his move, you see that it's hard to stop him. Am I correct? Yeah, absolutely. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: And Brian? Yeah, I mean, I agree with that one. I think Wagner. The only question is, I don't know, what's the gas tank of the other guy? Does he have some pretty good endurance? I feel like Wagner gasses out quick. Yeah, I think similar, I would say. What's that?
SPEAKER_03: I said if he gets stopped for a couple times there, he's going to run out of gas. Manuel is going outside while Wagner is going inside with his shoulder. If Manuel can take Wagner's wrist at the center, I think he would have a big chance to win. But if somehow Wagner puts the shoulder behind and
SPEAKER_03: Manuel is in losing position. It will be very hard for him to lift him up from there. Is Manuel fast? I can't remember. Is he fast? He's not slow, but he's not really a flash pinner. He's just maybe fast in his move. Some people fast this way, some people fast this way.
SPEAKER_03: know like like i i can i can call ryan fast and slow maybe slow to go to pinpad directly but very fast for the the quick risk yeah i don't know if i if you agree or not right but i don't know maybe yeah i would agree with you yeah yeah and you could go either way then right it's pretty it's close ah yeah i mean listen this is we are talking stylistically
SPEAKER_03: If somebody is very, very strong to apply his move, then he will have the advantage, you know. And we don't know that. We don't know that yet. And let's talk about, okay, let's talk to some bigger guys. Alex Kurdecha versus Artem Morozov right now. After I've seen, when Kurdecha came to Canada,
SPEAKER_02: And I seen him pull and felt them and, and stuff like he's got so much potential. That guy he's just done. He, I don't see how he's not just hasn't proven it yet. You know what I mean? In general. So, but I, I believe if he's training hard that he's, he's going to come out on top for sure. Like if you know anything about him, the guy's got all the tools. That's just how, one of my belief anyway. So who's winning?
SPEAKER_02: I think he is. Like, I think, yeah. You think Alex is going to beat Morozov right now? I think he is. I mean, he needs to. At this point, I feel like he really needs to. So that needing, having a goal, you know, a need to win is worth, I think it's worth a lot, right?
SPEAKER_02: You just get thrown a match and it doesn't matter if you win or lose, no big deal kind of thing. You're not putting as much into it as if you need to win. And I think he needs it right now to prove himself. And Ryan? Yeah, I think Morozov's going to beat him.
SPEAKER_02: When you guys in training table time, do you guys talk about these guys time to time? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, we are in our own little world, man. So the guys will pop up and say, oh, did you see that match? And I often, I'm just doing my own thing. I don't study arm wrestling like most. I train. I just train. You think that you are an arm wrestler, but
SPEAKER_03: not super arm wrestling fan i'm a fan of learning you focus on yourself but you don't really watch a lot of things all day yeah okay i don't spend a lot of time on social media says that he he watches guys only when they are set to pull against him you know
SPEAKER_00: that's interesting okay ryan what's your answers you said that you think morozov did you say or i just remember yeah i think morozov's gonna i think morozov's gonna beat him um and it may be close but i think it's more like a 3-1 uh i feel like i feel like he was in super good shape when he just pulled the tally not that long ago and you know yeah right but you know if you're training
SPEAKER_00: specific left arm. I mean, your right arm kind of comes along with it and vice versa. I mean, if you're training hard. So, I'm going to go with Morozov. Okay. Can I ask you something? Where do you think the match is going? Inside, outside, side, deadrest? How do you see him winning? Inside. Inside. Okay. Inside. This is funny because I... Of course, because you're an inside guy. I think it's going outside and that's why
SPEAKER_03: I think Cradach is going to win. Okay. Okay. Yeah. And let's talk about your countrymen. Matt Mask versus Irakli Zirakashvili left arm. Matt says that his left arm is not as good as his right, but Irakli is also like, he has been inactive for the last six years and his left wasn't as good as his right then.
SPEAKER_02: So how do you see this match? Well, it's got to be good enough for him to take the match. So I don't know. I don't know. This is a tough one for me, too. I want to say Matt Mask because he's my fellow Canadian. But all I know is that Rackley's right arm. So left, I don't know. It could go either way, really. I don't even really know a lot about Matt Mask's left arm. Has he had any big wins with his left arm?
SPEAKER_03: I mean, he has some wins against Devon during the WL. Oh, yes. I'm talking about, I think, rounds winning, not the supermatch winning, but some pins, I should say. Like practice pins. In a supermatch, he has some round wins. I think one or two. This was many years ago, though? 2017, 2016. Yeah, that's...
SPEAKER_03: Ryan, who did he beat in the East versus West Challenger Series? Wilton? Wilton Brock? Yeah. He beat him pretty easy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And the Wilton guy, do you know him? He's good left arm. Yeah. And he was in very good shape from what I understood. Yeah. So this is what I am saying, that, like,
SPEAKER_00: Matt may be underestimating his left arm, but we'll see. How do you see this match? Yeah, I think Matt Mask is probably the favorite, probably 80-20. Wow. I think, yeah, I just think the length, the length of Matt and everything is going to be a problem for Rackley.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I got to go with Matt. A pretty heavy favorite, but. Yeah, Matt's on fire right now too. Like I think he's doing really well, better than he's ever done. So whether he's putting that much effort into his left arm right now or not, I don't know. But I know myself, my left arm just kind of comes along with my right. It's not, it's not, it's not. What's that? I said it's there to hold the peg.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, pretty much. But I mean, I do pull with that, but yeah. Okay, Alan. Michael Todd versus Georgii Dzeranov. Arsen you familiar with Georgii Dzeranov? Not very much. This is right arm as well, correct? Obviously. Mike, I'm not as confident about Mike's mic right now.
SPEAKER_02: Uh, he, he's trying to make an effort to, to, uh, make another run at it, but I don't know if he's, he's got what it takes. So unless this is a, a gimme match, like where, you know, he, he is, he's set to like beat this other guy. I don't know the other guy, honestly. Sorry. Yeah. Other guy is also very strong. Yeah. So.
SPEAKER_02: I don't see Mike. I don't know. I'm not as confident with Mike's performance lately. Yeah, but his losses were against two superstars, Adamas and Vitaly Laletin.
SPEAKER_03: and they both had very hard time you know some people think there must be them easy but you can ask him so it's not easy beating michael 98 percent of the times is not easy you know you know no if he gets his spot there it's not easy for anybody yeah really well and and ryan um i think i think stylistically uh it's a horrible match for
SPEAKER_03: He's a hooker, right? I mean, he can hook. Maybe you remember his match against Revas, but he also top-rolled him. Revas Luchis in the Dubai event. He's very strong. But I have a question for you, Ryan. You said stylistically it's a bad match for him. I mean, stylistically, to who, Michael?
SPEAKER_03: Can you say that, oh, Michael, his style is a good match for this guy? I don't know any guy like this. Everyone, including Denis Diplenko, Andrei Pushkar, and many others, they all had a hard time. It's very, very hard to hold Michael and beat like this. You really need to have the tools to finish him.
SPEAKER_03: But I get what Ryan's saying, like someone with a higher hand, riser, top roll kind of thing to get up on top of Michael with a press is how you beat him. Like one of the best top rollers, he's very tall. He's probably five inches taller than Michael. Even he couldn't go outside. He had to, you know, go with the deadrest, you know.
SPEAKER_03: And somehow he ended up being a stylistically bad matchup for Michael because his reach is so good that Michael didn't have anywhere to go because Vitaly's reach was just like, it was like reaching everywhere on the table, you know? Okay. How do you see this match, Ryan? Like you see Michael winning this one? Yeah, I think Mike's going to win it.
SPEAKER_00: I like Georgii, man. He's super strong. I just like watching him pull. It just looks like a chisel out of stone. It's just all muscle. I think Mike's going to beat him. Especially with it being kind of like a do or die match. After losing the last one, you kind of got to get another win under your belt, right?
SPEAKER_03: I mean, this is not my place to say it, but if Michael also loses this match, in my opinion, I think he should consider 115, like 253, I think, yeah. But this is not my place, but I mean, he has all the chances to win the next match.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, Alex Kurdecha versus Devon Larratt, left arm. Let's start with Alan. Well, I've seen these two pull left arm before, and this is why I know that Alex is very strong. But Devon is, I can't ever bet against Devon. That's the thing.
SPEAKER_02: Like, this is practice pulls, right? I think they actually pulled on the stage at one event when he came to Canada. And Kurdecha was pretty, I don't know if he, I can't remember if he actually pinned him, but I was really impressed at what he did with him in that time. So I can't bet against Devon. Devon, I got to say Devon, but I think it's close. I think it's close. I think it's actually going to be a good match.
SPEAKER_02: as long as as long as credential can get him earlier rather than later because then Devon's into his uh his endurance um but that's that's Devon's game right he's gonna he's gonna play that he's gonna do whatever he can to make the lap match go longer so that it is an endurance factor rather than rather than uh strengthen skill as much you know yeah I mean no matter
SPEAKER_03: no matter who Devon is pulling against, people always expect Devon to do something extra ordinary. And even when he's not looking favorites, people still think that Devon would find a way. This is what I see. He literally wills his wins. You know what I mean by he wills it?
SPEAKER_00: He does. It's crazy. The stuff I've seen him do over the years, it's just insane. Yeah, and Ryan? Yeah, I think Devon for sure is going to win. I think Alex, I'd probably bet money that Alex will get at least one, the first one, and possibly the second.
SPEAKER_00: But I think Devon's going to find a stop somewhere, or maybe that second one will just hang up a little too long, and then Alex will still get the win, and then Devon will come back three in a row. I mean, that's how I see it. 3-1, 3-2, Devon. That makes sense. Without Alex winning the first two, probably. Yeah. Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Joseph Meranto versus Ivan Portela. Ivan Portela is a legend from Spain. He has many, many world titles, but his world titles were in lighter categories like 55, 60, which is 121, 132, but his weight is right now around 154.
SPEAKER_03: So he and Joseph Meranto, Joseph had two wins at the EVW stage. One was against Kevin Falco. It was surprising because I didn't know who he was. And then he also won against Cody Woods. That was also kind of surprising because Cody was just on fire, you know, and people thought that Cody was going to win.
SPEAKER_03: Joseph ended up winning. Now we have an international opponent for him. Ivan Portela currently is probably not one of the best in this category, but still very dangerous. And this will be the first experience for the North American rising star. Do you know Joseph Meranto, Alan?
SPEAKER_03: I don't know. I don't recognize either of those names. I'm much better with faces. Maybe I've seen them before, but I don't recognize the names. Yeah, he was in the Arlington event. And Ryan, you are probably following him. Yeah, yeah. He trains in Arizona with Tim Chalmers and John Brzee. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: So I pulled Cody Wood, and I know how strong Cody Wood is in a hook, you know, to be 154 pounds or whatever. And for Joseph to kind of be pretty comfortable in that hook with Cody, you know, it didn't look like he was really in danger of losing that match when it was in the hook. I'm going to go with Joseph. I'm going to ride the, you know,
SPEAKER_00: the Joseph train to the top. I would say it's 60-40 for Joseph. I know he's a hooker, too, and definitely decorated. I guess it just depends where this level falls. I truly like hookers, huh?
SPEAKER_00: right you think they're gonna win yeah of course i love it right right unlike ellen you follow what's going on right globally in our masking world oh yeah i'm i'm probably one of the biggest fans there is on top of being a competitor you know i listen to all the podcasts yeah i did it you are all the time you know commenting you know and
SPEAKER_02: Yeah. So let's go to the main event. Levan Levan Saginashvili versus Ermes Gasparini. I'm sure, Alan, you follow that much. Yes. Yeah. Yeah, it's exciting. Like, I mean, I know that Ermes has previously got pins on him, but a pin, right? He pinned him once. Was it just once? No, he followed out twice. Or not followed out, but he didn't.
SPEAKER_03: Go ahead. Okay. It was, it was, it was like four zero. And then they start the round five and Ermes stopped him and he was in winning position. Levan fouled and they both went to their corners. And as far as I am informed that Levan said that that's, that's enough. And yeah, yeah. This is why they never finished round five and they never started round six, you know?
SPEAKER_03: So, and according to some people, it was 4-2. According to some people, it was 4-1. And according to some people, it was 4-0. That was the time that LeVon basically ran out of gas, right? He was done because those rounds were so long. Yeah. Yeah. Big beef right now about this subject. And Ermes made a video. So, look at Ryan is laughing. So, probably he's aware of what's going on.
SPEAKER_03: And Ermes made a video. He called Levan some names and Levan got angry. And I don't want to go more in details. I have all the information. And some paranoid people think that this is for like hyping the event. But in fact, that is not really good looking situation. There's a big tension. Go ahead, Ermes.
SPEAKER_02: I just think I, I'm, I hope that Ermes gets a win on him to be honest. It'd be, it'd be really cool. Cause, uh, right now LaVon's untouchable and it seems like Ermes is the only one that has, that is proved that he has a, has a shot at it. So, um, and I'm sure he's going to be crazy ready for this. And, and, uh, he, he's already familiar with the way that LaVon pulls. So yeah, he's going to be dialed in and, uh,
SPEAKER_03: I think if he doesn't win, he's going to actually get pins on him this time. Maybe at least one, maybe two. The thing is that last time when Lewand and Ermes pulled, I don't think that Ermes went there with a mindset that I'm going to go there and win and I will be the champion.
SPEAKER_03: He didn't. The rounds that he was fired up, he told me that whenever he looked at Levan's corner and Irakli and others, they were laughing at him. So he said that that really bothered him so much. And he got angry, fired up, and then those late rounds, you know. And this time, 100% I know. I know 100% because I talked with Ermes.
SPEAKER_03: He is going there with the mindset to win. He says that 22nd of June, he will wake up with a belt and garments as a new super heavyweight world champion. This is his mindset. And from outside, Levan is going there.
SPEAKER_03: just to destroy Ermes because people really made fun with him. They call him Oxygenashvili or something. They made his last name. They made fun and it really bothers Levan. And now when Ermes is also saying stuff, now Levan says, trash talk finish. Ermes, we will see each other in Chicago. Be ready.
SPEAKER_03: and so the things are really tense but the guys are just for sure they have mutual respect but we will see how it will end up you know so you are saying that Ermes is gonna win one or two rounds at least I mean I wanna I wanna see him I kind of want to see him win just just to just to be in that uh to
SPEAKER_02: to get Lavon out of that position. You know what I mean? That first, first untouchable position to see, make him, make him more, uh, human-like. Um, but, uh, and it, him going, like, Ermi's going into this being, like, very focused on winning this time. Um, whereas the last time you were saying he didn't really have, uh, he didn't, he just was coming to arm wrestle, right? And see what happens. Now it's focus. He's felt it. He knows where he needs to go.
SPEAKER_00: It's going to be a different game. I'm hoping to see at least one or two wins, if not him winning. Ryan? Well, because I watch all the podcasts and everything, it was mentioned, correct me if I'm wrong, that at that particular time when they pulled, LeVon was not in very good shape. Is that correct?
SPEAKER_00: so without so Laban not being in a very good shape and then maybe coming into this you know pedal to the metal training hard and I don't know 20 stronger like is right percent right right like if you are like
SPEAKER_03: not in your prime or something. Yeah. But if you are not in your best shape, just say that you are five to 10% less in my opinion. But, but there's also, uh, something that like Ermes had some struggles against Dave Chaffee a few months before, before that match. And I mean, like, I think that right now, Ermes is also, uh, in different, different shape, different.
SPEAKER_03: uh level so i my my my guess is that both are stronger than that time but i think that you what you believe what you are saying is that levan wasn't in his best and this time he's coming with his best and he's gonna win i think this is where you were going yeah so he wasn't at his best before and he still won right and it was a it was a battle so
SPEAKER_00: To me, it's trying to figure out, you know, how much Ermes has went up and how much LeVon has went up, you know, where it'll fall. I think Ermes would have to jump pretty drastically to kind of win it. I mean, I want Ermes to win. I just think LeVon's still the favorite, you know. I think probably 70-30.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, on the paper, whoever is saying Levan is not favorites, I don't know if they are really sharing their true feelings, but being favorites sometimes don't... If you haven't lost in four years, there's no way that you're the underdog. Eight years. Yeah, eight years. There's no way you're the underdog. He's got to be the favorite. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah. Anyways, we will see. I think this is one of the most important matches in the history of armwrestling. And very soon. We are, what's today? 29? No, 30, right? 30. So we are 22 days away. Yeah. Tomorrow will be last three weeks. Yeah. Anyway, so before we finish, I also want to wish you guys
SPEAKER_03: safe preparation and just stay strong, stay healthy and just don't forget the things that you guys told each other. And because some people... I already forgot. Yeah, you will not forget that. Yeah. Yeah. And I think it will be a great, great event.
SPEAKER_03: Alan, thank you very much, my friend. Thank you for being our guest. And it was an honor. And Ryan, also thank you very, very much, my friend. You waited, how long? You waited about 10 months for this march. I think it was August and now June, so about 10 months. And yeah.
SPEAKER_00: I just want to say thank you for inviting me, Alan. Thank you for accepting the match. This could potentially be a match of the night, depending on how it lines up. That's what I'm going for. Just stay healthy the last three weeks, and I look forward to meeting you. I won't talk to you the whole time until after we pull. Devon't take it personally.
SPEAKER_02: I'm the same, that's why. Go ahead. I was just going to say, yeah, again, thanks for the opportunity as well, accepting this match. I don't know if you know what you bet off here, but we'll see what happens. I want the whole thing. Ryan, Alan is not saying the truth. Ryan, Alan is not saying the truth. You just said that, you know,
SPEAKER_03: this may be like potentially the best match of the, you know, day. And he said that this is what he's going for. No, he's going for a flash pin. Devon't believe him, right? Fair enough. But that to me is the best match of the day. Yeah, yeah, I know, I know, I know, I know. Yeah. Anyways, guys, once again, thank you and you take care of yourself. Take care. Thank you, guys.
