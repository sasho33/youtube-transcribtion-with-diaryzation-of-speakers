SPEAKER_04: Hello, Georgii. Hello, Ivan. We are live now. Georgii, you speak English now? Georgii speaks English now. Oh, he speaks English. Incredible. Incredible.
SPEAKER_04: Okay, we are waiting for Michael. Let me check where he is at.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, Michael is here. Okay. Hello, Michael. How are you? I'm well, sir. My apologies for being late. No, you are not. Only one minute. It's nothing. I thought that maybe I didn't send you the link or something. Then I realized that I did this. Yeah. It's all good. It's all good. Yeah. So, another one, Michael, back to back. This is four matches. No, I mean, like back to back four matches in
SPEAKER_01: in last, what, six months? Yeah. No, February, May, June. So in five months, there's been three matches. So seven months, yeah. Well, I guess since November, February, May, now. So four months. Okay. If you say February, it's four months. Because second month to six months. So in four months, you are having back to back. Yeah. Yeah. Wow. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah. Yes. It's a big challenge. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's a handful. So this will be my seventh match in 14 months with King the Table East versus West. Yeah. The first one was February. Our first one's April 20th. So here we are, June 21st, seven matches in 14 months. Yeah. And do you plan to rest after this one? So what do you mean by rest? How long? No. No.
SPEAKER_03: Like, are you going to go with the same frequency? Well, I'm looking at every other event for now, unless something comes up. Like, you know, if I can be successful with Zaranoff, I'm thinking probably the winner of Gurdjieff versus Morozov in September. And then if I can win that, maybe, you know, depends on
SPEAKER_03: If LeVon beats Armez, maybe a rematch with Armez in December, I don't know, just whatever you come up with. I'm just looking down the, I'm willing to pull anybody. You know, people are talking about Svetkov. Well, I'm sure he had surgery on his left arm, so I don't know when he'll be back right-handed. I'm willing to pull anybody, you know. Now, there is the question, if I'm unsuccessful with Georgii, do I decide to go down to 115? You know, who knows?
SPEAKER_01: Right now, there is no. OK, so you are saying that you want this match and then you say supers. If you lose this match, then probably 115. It just depends. It just depends, man. I'm actually so I'm really happy where I'm at.
SPEAKER_03: I, this, this turnaround was so short, it was six weeks. So it's only been five weeks since my last match. Right. Um, but I did the heaviest back circuit I've ever done the heaviest, uh, pumping chest circuit. Uh, and then yesterday I broke all my PRS on all my lifts. So
SPEAKER_03: I beat my riser curl by five pounds from Batali. I beat my wrist cupping by two and a half pounds for 50 reps, but I actually was able to complete all 50 where I couldn't before. Beat my outside side pressure by eight pounds for five reps. Beat my pronation gauge back pressure by five pounds.
SPEAKER_03: Uh, static hold the static hold move. I mean that about 15 pounds. So like I'm actually, and I'm 10 pounds lighter. So this morning I was one 31 strip one 31. So, and I was, I was 10 pounds heavier shots, you know, four and a half kilos heavier.
SPEAKER_01: going into Vitaly than I am currently right now, but yet I'm stronger on everything. So... Yeah, yeah, I mean, it doesn't always, the weight doesn't always equal to, yeah, power, yeah. But it's very surprising, Michael. It's very surprising that, like, you have been, like, pushing the gas pedal non-stop and still going up. You know, that's very... Well, this is what I... It is surprising, but I think a lot of it is, you know, 35 years of arm wrestling, but this arm is only two years old.
SPEAKER_01: You know, this arm is new, you know, so I'm getting newbie gains. So I'm getting stronger because this arm is new, you know what I mean? It's been rebuilt. Can we say that it is new just because you had the surgery? I mean, oh dude, I had this much bone taken out. Like I understand, but when you say arm, you have your wrist and like all this, the bone part is mostly about the elbow probably. Well, the thing about it, I had nerve damage.
SPEAKER_03: I had all that nerve damage. Well, they scraped away the ulna nerve, so now I can feel my fingers again. This atrophy has gone away. Allen the things that were bothering me are now like, maybe the stem cells really helped that much. I don't know. No, no, I'm sure it helped. But what I'm just saying, just because you fixed the problem, it doesn't mean that it's a new bone. You have been pulling with that arm all the time. But this range of motion, this thing here, is all new. This is 15 years I haven't been able to do it.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah. So it's just, I don't know, man, I feel good. We'll see. I have great respect for Jordy. Like he's super, super strong, scary dude. When I saw him beat Rivas a year ago,
SPEAKER_03: I was like, oh my God, that guy is strong, right? So, you know, obviously his match with Vitaly, a lot of people will look at that and look at my match and draw conclusions. I don't think it has anything to do with it. So I'm expecting a dog fight. Like I'm expecting a war. Yes. Yes. It will be a war. I don't see anyone dominating another one. Did you guys see the new promo video that Paul Aron made?
SPEAKER_01: I have not. You have not. Just please go watch it. Where's it at? It's on the East versus West social media. OK. Levan and Ermes. OK. I haven't seen it yet. It's a beautiful one. Yeah. OK. Cool. Yeah. Yeah. So are we still waiting on Georgii? Is he not here yet? He's right here. Oh, hey. Hey. How you doing? I couldn't see. I could only see Egan. I didn't know. What's up, Ivan?
SPEAKER_01: Oh, hello. Yeah, yeah. Michael says Ivan. His name is pronounced Ivan. Ivan. Yes, I didn't... That's why you didn't know. Yeah, yeah, yeah. My bad. No, no, it's OK. I mean, we pronounce the names also wrong as well, because it's not... I'm not here. Where is Georgii? Is he here? Yeah, yeah, Georgii is here. Why you guys don't see him?
SPEAKER_04: Michael said that you look scary. Emgin joked that you are afraid. It's just a play on words.
SPEAKER_01: I got it. It was just a small provocation. I got it. What did he say? He repeated what I just told you.
SPEAKER_00: First of all, I respect Michael. I can't say that I will destroy him. I don't want to say such loud words. I respect him, even if I don't like his fight. But as a person, I respect him. He is a very good fighter.
SPEAKER_04: Georgii says that he likes Michael, he respects him. He doesn't like his style, but he likes his spirit. And that's it. I didn't want to say that I'm not afraid of him. He's not afraid of him. He says he's not afraid of Michael.
SPEAKER_00: Yes, I'm not afraid. But I think it will be a tough fight for both of us. But he also thinks it will be a dogfight, like Michael said. It will be difficult for both of you.
SPEAKER_00: And at the same time he feels relaxed because he agreed to pull on short notice.
SPEAKER_01: I think he doesn't feel too much responsibility for that. Oh, come on. What kind of excuse is that? That Michael just pulled only a month ago. No, no, no excuses. He's just recovering, while Desiree is always just like Daisy, you know? Yeah. Tell him not to come with such excuses.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah. So, Engin is joking again that it's a lie that you were told on short notice. Well, yes. He agrees, yes. That's an excuse. Yeah, no excuse. There is only one way out for these athletes. They need to win. Georgii Dzeranov, last two matches, losses. Michael.
SPEAKER_01: It's the same way and this time one of the athletes will just survive, you know. Of course, both athletes will, I mean, still get matches, but there is only, like, if you want to have a shot to this direction, you need to continue winning. That's not, like, what I say, but that is the nature of the competition.
SPEAKER_04: If you have ambition, you have to win. It doesn't mean that there will be no more fights. If you have ambition, you have to fight and win. There is only one way. Victory. In fact, yes. I think both Michael and I understand it.
SPEAKER_01: But in any case, there is only one winner. Georgii agrees. He thinks that both of them will do their best to win. But at the same time, only one person will win. Yeah, for sure. Can you also ask him, does he believe that he has the tools to beat Michael? Because Michael, as we said,
SPEAKER_01: If you say who is the one of the most explosive flash spinner in the world, that's Vitaly Laletin, for sure, if not the best one. And Vitaly couldn't do it. So it just seems like that is going to be a massive will to stop. And then after that point, does Zorano have, does he believe that he has tools to finish Michael?
SPEAKER_04: I have a question for Angin. Do you think you have a weapon against Michael? He gave the example of Vitaly Malikin, who had a very powerful start and who usually won everyone in touch. And even he could not win his fight, he had to rebuild. In this regard, I have a question. Do you think you have a weapon against Michael? Oh, it's hard to say. In fact, against Michael,
SPEAKER_00: You can't pick a lot of keys, roughly speaking. Of course, everyone understands that there should be a flow press, a triceps against him. But I can either use it or not. I've never trained him so hard. And now, when I started training,
SPEAKER_00: It's difficult to say.
SPEAKER_04: He knows that floor press is the key, but he never was very good at it. Now he's not sure that he'll be able to do it. But he started to train it, and at the same time, unfortunately, it hurt his elbow. This kind of training.
SPEAKER_01: So it's difficult for him to say and he'll think about it during the fight. Okay, one more quick question before I go, Michael. Does he think that there is no other way to beat Michael? That's the first question. The second question. Did Vitaly beat Gyorgy because he's much stronger or because of his start? Do you think that, does he think that if the match started and referee is still holding, if they started five seconds,
SPEAKER_04: You know, but referee is still holding, no one can go. And then the match would start. Do you think that there would be a chance to beat Vitaly if the match didn't start, like if Vitaly wasn't that explosive?
SPEAKER_04: It's hard to say about Vitalik.
SPEAKER_00: I was a bit worried about Brachialis, he couldn't make a good pull. I think Vitaly could have won, but there wouldn't have been such a clear domination. I mean, we would have struggled a bit, let's say. Maybe I could have held him without my wrists, or something else. But if there is another weapon against Michael... Oh...
SPEAKER_00: It's hard to say. Probably a powerful hand to control his pronation, to keep him in the center. And still, it's probably impossible to do without a floor press. So about Vitaly, he said that he had problems with brachial muscle, with the rising, with the back pressure.
SPEAKER_04: And if not that injury, maybe he would last longer. Maybe he would stop him somewhere a little, but still he thinks that Vitaly was stronger. Anyway, even without this injury. Yes. No, injury is a different thing. My question was if the match started slowly. If the referee said, ready, go, and now hold their hands and they start pulling,
SPEAKER_04: Yes, I asked Georgii, but maybe he didn't understand me. If your fight went on for a long time, if you were delayed, if Vitaly was not allowed to start at the start, would it have changed anything? As you said, maybe you would have held him with a bent wrist. Yes, maybe with an open wrist.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know, even if I spun him, he spins very well, even from this position. But Vitaly is also very tolerant, despite the fact that... I think our tolerance is about the same now. I don't know, but it seems to me that Vitaly was a little stronger at that moment. Maybe I managed to do one more round.
SPEAKER_04: So Georgii said once again that maybe he would stop him without wrist for some time. But anyway Vitaly was stronger that day. And very short answer I want. Is he now healthy or still have that injury?
SPEAKER_00: Yes, I feel pretty good. I can at least do some kind of pull on myself. It's just that Brachialis doesn't let me do a good pull. There are, of course, some moments. I think we all have them. But for them to have a direct impact on the fight now,
SPEAKER_00: I can't say that it's something critical. My elbow started to hurt a bit, and I started to put pressure on my triceps. In the block, for example. But in two weeks I stopped doing heavy weights and let my arm rest a bit. So far, without weights, I feel good. I don't know how it will be later. How do you feel after the fight?
SPEAKER_01: No, he had some pain when he trained flop press, but now it seems to be okay. And he has no problem with the... Brachialis? Brachialis, yes. No problem now. So he is healthy now. Michael, like, soon you're gonna make everyone flop press master. Everyone who is pulling against you, they are training something that they have never trained before. Right. Dammit.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah. So was he saying that he thinks that's the only way to beat me as flop press? Cause I didn't get the answer on that one. I think, I think that this one, he thinks that is what we are. But, um,
SPEAKER_01: I mean, that's pretty high praise. I mean, especially for Vitaly to say that you can't beat me without a thought because Vitaly's top role is so amazing. I mean, I know I lost that match, but I was still very pleased with round one and my abilities. My friend, we were all shocked. I don't know how that match didn't go here, you know, right away. And it just shows that, you know, and we know that you met Vitaly, which is much stronger than Vitaly that met Levan in 2019. So just imagine.
SPEAKER_01: So my honest opinion is that armwrestling today at crazy level, crazy level, you know, and as you said that you are breaking your personal records, you know, and it just shows it like we haven't reached to our full capacity. Nobody yet. Yeah. It's crazy how, how a level can keep making everyone else rise. Cause everybody wants to get, you know,
SPEAKER_01: you know what? No, no, no, Michael, we are not here to talk about this or that. Just, yeah, let's talk. How strong Vitaliy is? According to himself, he is just
SPEAKER_01: I think he says some number of percentage number, but much stronger than he is. He said he was 123 kilo when he pulled against Devon and in 2019. So right now he's about 150 kilos. It's not only about the weight. He didn't gain the weight. Like he's gaining like slow. His seat, his seated curls are strong and his side pressure movement is strong. So Yvonne, when you pulling, can you, can you beat him in a hook?
SPEAKER_01: Cause I saw y'all playing around, so I just don't know how accurate some of those videos are. I think, uh, not now. Think about that. You can't beat him in a hook. Just, just remember one thing in 2016. One sec. Krasimir in 2016, Krasimir Hukleva, Krasimir was 102 kilos and he competed the European championship super heavyweight and he hooked.
SPEAKER_01: Levan, it was a tough match and he won't. Yeah, Levan came out the back trying to get away. But what I'm just saying that if you guys remember, I think it was 2021 or 2022. I don't remember exactly. Krasimir and Vitaly had a super match and even then he hooked him and then like he beat him. And now Vitaly is
SPEAKER_01: in like much higher shape so the guy is just yeah he is incredible I don't know how he will do against Devon we will see because I don't think that Devon will be in a shape that we have seen him before I think he will also be in a crazy shape. The reason that Michael that you guys are just getting into crazy levels is because like every one and a half months you guys are meeting each other
SPEAKER_01: And then that competition level is just making you guys... I believe in one thing. If there is no competition, tough competition, there is no improvement. Impossible without tough competition. That's why those guys in WAF are very tough. Because every year Europeans and the wars and then they're nationals. And then every year they meet and they make each other crazy strong. So now with the East versus West, there's this...
SPEAKER_01: regular meeting and you guys are coming into crazy level, crazy level. And, and, and, okay, Michael, so do you think, do you think that, um, like, or I should say, why, why do you think that like you are stopping all these guys, you know, at the center?
SPEAKER_03: very effectively. Like what has changed? Is it your right? I'm going to tell you what I think it is. And the people that watch me think it's crazy. It's pronation engaged back pressure. It's this, this move right there that I do into that, that pulley, you know, it opens me up and stretches me out, but it, it's so much attacking here. And when I pull it back with my lat, you know, it's that dragging back pressure. That's stopping it. Look at round one with Gennady. Look at round one with Vitaly.
SPEAKER_03: there's a little bit of hit, and then I come right back to center. And that's exactly the movement I do with that thing. Now, would it be better if I could be tighter? Yes, there's a lot of things I still need to work on, but that's why I'm stopping the matches, in my opinion. My pronation, obviously my pronation lift opens up, it's more stretched, but my strength through here,
SPEAKER_03: It's so hot. You also used your left, as you said, yes. Yeah, I mean, it's just when you go sideways, you're literally running into this, you know, and it's gonna stop. When was the last time you lost without flop, but just by the, like, Gennady match, you lost that way, first one. Oh, 2022? Yeah. And then Devon match. Devon match. Do you... So Devon matches before that, then Gennady.
SPEAKER_01: Do you think that anybody can beat you without the flop right now? I haven't watched the video, but I heard Levan say he thinks he can flash me.
SPEAKER_03: Um, and I don't think he can't honestly, God don't think Lavon can blast me. I don't think he can stop me from slipping. I think once we get in the strap, I think I can hit hard enough backwards when he goes, I don't think he blessed. So I don't think I can be flashed inside the strap unless I make an error. If I hit my, my mood pronation, I'm talking about, is there any way still like in the past? So
SPEAKER_01: you know, and then totally take, take, take your risks. And then like, it would be, it would take, it would take a really, really, really, really, really, really strong version of Devon. Someone who has that crazy height and ability to understand and climb, climb, climb, climb. Cause arm is, is there any chance that you and him meet and then end up like your WL match with him?
SPEAKER_01: Yes. Yes. So how do you how do you see the possibilities to the match to go Dubai way and what's the possibility to go one way you think 50-50 or how do you see? I think 70-30 it goes more WAL style.
SPEAKER_03: Also, you'll you'll you'll like your chances if you meet him again. I think we're 5050. I think the match is 5050, but I don't think it's going to be done. Devon's going to dominate my hand and wrist. He's going to have to he's got to figure a different way out. In my opinion, you know, I just think my risers getting much better.
SPEAKER_03: I'm, I don't know, I just, I think I'm improving and I think having this extra range of motion, I mean, I guess this isn't strong yet, but for 15 years, it wouldn't come past here. And now it comes a year, you know what I mean? This is a big difference that still has a lot of room to improve, you know? So I don't know, man, I'm excited. Rebecca was not, we were talking yesterday and we were talking about a potential one 15, you know, just a potential because I like being fit. Not like I said, I feel relatively fit right now at one 31.
SPEAKER_03: But, um, I like being fit. It's summer. We got the pool. It just makes me want to be leaner and fitter. If I could keep progressing in my strengths, I think I'd be a really bad problem for the 115 division because that's what we need. Because I think things are coming together really good.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, and 131 is not super above 115, right? No, I mean, I could be, I could safely be there in 12 weeks if I wanted. Like, if we had this match, if I had another match in 12 weeks, I could, I could be there, be fit, and probably not sacrifice any strength, you know what I mean? But I'm not done with this, man. I still think I got a shot. I still, I really want to pull Devon so bad. I just think that there's a chance that, you know,
SPEAKER_03: I can keep getting stronger and I think there's, like, let's just say, and I'm definitely not looking past Yorgi at all. He's amazing and I'm expecting a hell of a fight. I'm just saying in the future.
SPEAKER_03: If I ever got the call and said, okay, you're pulling LeBron in six months. Those six months of my life would be the most insane, intense, crazy, sacrifice everything to be the strongest I could possibly be to find out what's possible, you know? Maybe I don't, you know, who knows? We'll see. But once you deserve that, you will have it. And then you will deserve that shot. It means that you will have chance.
SPEAKER_01: We don't know how much, but you know what I mean when you say that you deserve it. Once you deserve it, you have to beat some guys. If you are beating those guys, it means that you deserve it. And if you are beating those guys, it means that you are somewhere in a serious level, you know? Yeah. Right, right. Two questions, two questions real quick for Georgii. What is his weight? And I don't know, how old is he? I don't know how old he is. What is your weight, Georgii, and how old are you?
SPEAKER_03: He's 133. I'm 131. Yeah, I'm 131. How old is he? 37. 37? OK, so OK. I'm only 15 years older than him, so that's not bad. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So he was 2 when I started armwrestling. Georgii, what do you think your chances are? You said that you don't feel pressure, but what do you think your chances are to win in Chicago? What do you think your chances are? You said that you don't feel much pressure about the fight. What do you think your chances are?
SPEAKER_01: I think I have a good chance.
SPEAKER_04: He thinks that Michael is the favorite, but still he has about 40-45%, but he'll do the maximum out of this 45%. So he doesn't think he has bad chances.
SPEAKER_01: OK, so he believes that he has a very good chance, but not better than Michael's chance. I understand. Yeah. Yeah. And Michael. How about you?
SPEAKER_03: I was going to say 51 49, but I liked that 55 45. That sounds better. I think, I think I'm the favorite, you know, but I, you can never tell, like you can never tell at this level. Everyone's so strong. I mean, that's, what's so funny. Someone was dogging me the other day about, Oh, well you lost to Ermes. Oh, you lost her battalion. I'm like, yes, exactly.
SPEAKER_03: look at
SPEAKER_03: but that had to be the strongest fatality that anyone's ever faced. And I was pretty competitive. So, I mean, it's not like, yeah, I mean, it's funny. People want to give you shit about losing. I'm like, but I'm competing against the very best people in the world, you know, I mean, um, and I'm still only two years back after an injury. So I feel like I'm, I feel like I'm in a good spot. Now, the thing about your, he is,
SPEAKER_03: Yes, I believe I'm probably the favorite to everyone, but I'm not looking past this dude at all, because like I said, he's scary. So, I mean, he's a big frame, big bone.
SPEAKER_03: Dude, and he's got a lot of heart. And you see him lose round one and round two in some of his East vs. West earlier matches and come back and just crush the people the three in a row. I'm like, well, shit, he knows he's got endurance. So, yeah, I mean, I'm expecting a hard fight, you know? Yeah, yeah. Even if you win, Michael, you will not win easy, for sure. If you win, Michael, it won't be easy, Georgii. Well, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: I think Michael will have to work on it as well. Mask him to turn his phone? To use it, yeah. What did he say? What did he say as an answer?
SPEAKER_04: Yes, he believes that he will have to work hard to beat Michael. Can you ask him, Georgii, was he surprised when the ref said, go, and then the match stopped at the middle? Between Vitaly and Michael. Tell me, Georgii, were you surprised when in the fight with Vitaly, after the Go team, the grip remained in the center?
SPEAKER_00: Yes, in fact, I was very surprised. I thought he would stay, but I thought he would stay near the pillow. And when Michael stopped him in the center, I just thought that Michael, probably, this movement, which is in the middle, worked well on him, and on his crown movement, which is near the pillow, it seemed to me a little that
SPEAKER_04: Yes, he was really surprised. He thought Michael would stop Vitaly, but not at the center, but where he usually stops. Near the pad.
SPEAKER_04: And he thought and thinks that for that preparation Michael really improved in his center position but maybe lacked his defensive position near the pad.
SPEAKER_03: I'm trying to make the other stuff strong. So I don't, you know, it's so hard to pick what you want to train and focus on because I need more strength here. And I just feel like, oh, well, this is going to be there, but I did not expect his hand to be so strong and for him to be able to come so far across the table. You know, um, I just thought, Hey, good round one. I swear, man, I felt his press on the car. I'm good. This is great. No problem. And then before you know it, I'm like, ah, shit, I'm in trouble.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, so that sucks. Michael, I mentioned this in some of the earlier podcasts. When the match starts, and you are center, and I would take a picture of that moment and send to, just say, hundreds of armwrestling experts who are now watching the match. I said, this is three seconds after round one. Yeah, after the round one. Who won this match?
SPEAKER_01: I tell you what, I don't think there is one single person would say that Vitaly won that one. It was unexpected. Both were unexpected. What you did was unexpected, what he did, but we should all know that whenever you come here, you climb up. Probably his grip felt so strong, right, Michael? Right. Yeah, I mean, I opened my hand, it just wouldn't go anywhere. I was like... Yeah, yeah, you were opening, but did you feel your riser was a little bit like he was just pronating with the grip? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Like I said, he fought extremely hard. He was very committed to what he needed to do to win. And I was very impressed with his arm wrestling IQ throughout that match. I mean, he did a great job. I would love to arm wrestle him again someday, I'm sure. Unless I go down to a lighter division, I feel like I'm gonna pull Ermes again. I feel like I'll pull Vitaly again.
SPEAKER_01: I just, I want to arm wrestle as many people, like when would you want me to arm wrestle again? And you asked me when would I want to arm wrestle again? When would you want me to arm wrestle again? No, no, no. I mean, listen, we will, we will need all of you all the time. I'm just thinking that like, it was really tough period for you. I mean, Gennady, Gennady, Ermes, Vitaly, now, uh, Serrano. These, these are like very high level. I like,
SPEAKER_01: I don't know how many people can do this. That is what I mean, you know. Like, from November, because it was beginning of November, so November, December, and then five, seven, seven and a half months. In seven and a half months, you are doing your fourth very tough match, you know. Very tough.
SPEAKER_03: Right. Yeah. Yeah. It's all good. I'm excited. I'm up for the challenge. It's it, you know, like you and I, we've been doing this a very long time and to be, you know, just turned 52 years old yesterday. Sometimes I feel 52 when I wake up in the morning, my back hurts or whatever, or my knees or my hips.
SPEAKER_03: But when it comes time to arm wrestle, I feel, I still feel like a kid. Like, I just want to get out there and bang, you know? So, um, it's hard for me not to say, put me on the next car to king of the table, then put me on the next one in September and then put me on the next one and switch. You know what I'm saying? Like I want to do them all, but at the same time, I do want to keep progressing. So I have to be somewhat, um, particular on when I compete so that I don't
SPEAKER_03: I think if you would be more selective in later years
SPEAKER_01: I think you can be competitive as long as, you know, like I'm talking about the age of Tata Shinks. I think in the late 50s, I think you will be competitive. But maybe you can't be pulling every two months or something after a certain age, but you know, some, you know.
SPEAKER_03: But yeah, we're going to see, we're going to find out. Right. But I agree. Like right now it's a very simple looking future. Um, I don't know, you know, like I said, I don't know if I'm going to win the matches. I don't know what's going on, but you know, pulling next weekend and then pulling again in three months and then pulling again in three months, those, those dates seem real realistic to me because those are all North American events. It doesn't seem like a whole lot of travel that I have to do. And I don't hold a lot of time, like boarding my dogs.
SPEAKER_03: A lot of people don't realize, like, my dogs are my family. We have five dogs that sleep in bed with us every night. Oreo is 15 years old. And I just hate leaving her. So traveling to Europe right now, unless there was something that was a match that really excited me, I kind of like maybe doing this event and then the next two North American events and then getting back into the international travel.
SPEAKER_01: But like the November 1st event, you know, I don't know if you've announced where it's going to be. My friend, I can't guarantee anyone any events. I mean, trust me, like 30, 40 athletes are regular, like all the time pulling athletes. Like, yeah, yeah, yeah. Every event they want. But so that's why I just right now I have the board. I don't show you guys the next seven from the August right there. I see all the matches.
SPEAKER_01: And you don't, you don't see it, but I'm yeah. So we will announce the location of the next event yet. We don't know yet. We don't know yet. Yeah. So it's still up in the air. I knew where y'all were planning, but I didn't know if y'all secured it yet or not. Yeah. Soon, soon to be, soon to be a finalist. Georgii. Who is winning? Alex Kurdecha or Artur Morozov? Artur Morozov.
SPEAKER_00: It's not because he's from Kazakhstan, same as you, right? He will pull after Larratt. And Devon would make him tired.
SPEAKER_00: Both physically and mentally. And that's why he will have problems. Also. What if Alex beats Devon quickly? What if Alex beats Devon? It will still be difficult for him. Even if he wins, it will be a difficult victory. Devon likes to beat his opponents.
SPEAKER_03: Still, it would be difficult. It won't be easy. Michael? Yeah, I mean, I'm of the same mindset, having to pull Devon first. And I understand why he's doing that, because of the importance of pulling Devon. That has to take a toll on you. And at this level, pulling left and right at the same event is almost crazy.
SPEAKER_03: And Morozov truly is probably one of the most intimidating looking athletes that we have on the roster. So I'm excited to see the match. But yeah, I think Morozov is going to, with everything that's in play, I think Morozov's the favorite. OK. This one I'm going to only ask you, Michael. And before that, I want to ask Ivan. Ivan, how do you see that match? Which one? Morozov and Alex Kurdecha.
SPEAKER_04: I think that Kurdecha will try to toproll Artem. Artem either hooks him, either stops him with a straight wrist. And after some time in the neutral, at the center, I think Artem is the favorite. I do not see Alex beating or flash-pinning Artem. And how do you see Michael and Georgii?
SPEAKER_04: I think it all depends on how well Georgii prepared for press. Ah, ok. So you also believe that only way? Flop press? Not only. I think that a good top roll with very good side pressure is also possible. Good top roll with a good side pressure, then I remember Vitaly and I didn't see it's possible.
SPEAKER_04: I think something like Devon did. Controlling the center and getting little by little to the side. I know that Georgii was versatile at 12 years. He fought differently. He could hit without his wrist as well. But it was not pure floor press.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it was just more like sideways, yeah. We're talking about the match being stopped and then constant pressure, yeah. But we'll see how he did his homework. Ivan, what if Michael just says, OK, let me try 115. And is there any other way to beat him at 115? Ford sure, I will try to hook Michael.
SPEAKER_01: But I would also need to practice floor press, I think. Michael, if you also make Ivan Matushenko floor presser, wow, then you will be in the history with description with one more edition. He even made Ivan Matushenko floor presser. Actually, I do not see myself hooking Michael completely. Even at 115?
SPEAKER_04: Even at 1.15? Yes, I think I could manage maybe just a little with straight hand go to side. Where Michael would stop me. And from that point... Sorry, sorry, go ahead. And from that point, I'm not sure that my side pressure hit with that position would finish. Michael, how many fun matches you would have?
SPEAKER_03: There's so many matches at 115. Imagine you versus just say Reno Mustich when he comes back. You versus Ibrahim Sagol. See, Ibrahim, like, I feel as strong as he is here, I don't think he can hook me. I don't think he can turn me in. Ah, but you know that he can also do this? Yeah, no, no, I got it. I got it. I just, I think.
SPEAKER_03: See, Yvonne is someone who I've always, we talked about that last year, right? Because he is the best in my opinion that forcing a hook. And I think I'm probably the best at keeping you from hooking me, you know what I'm saying? So I think that's a very interesting match. But Reno, Yvonne, rematch Dave Chafee, Gennady at 115 if he stays at 115, Ibrahim Sagov.
SPEAKER_01: There's so many matches in that category. Do you think that Dave Chaffee, like if he didn't, like just say that they always walked at 275. Right. And for him to make 253, just if he's walking around 275 on 265, I don't see him losing a lot for the 10 pounds. And then if he would know how to lose the weight,
SPEAKER_01: in the last moment, getting back, you know, just say you went up to 270. I think he can be very close to his super heavyweight shape at 150, very close. And his super heavyweight shape for 150 would be very dangerous. Well, he would probably be the longest lever in the division if you exclude Devon. If you take Devon out of the 115, who's got a bigger hand and bigger, longer forearm than Dave Chafee at 115? Just say that, just say that.
SPEAKER_03: Like what would his chance be at 115? Dave's? Yeah. Okay. So I don't know if Dave has his, his hook side pressure game back yet. If he gets that back, then his, his chances are as good as anyone in the division. Right. Um, but if he's all top role, for example, for example, can he top roll those people at 115? Just like, for example, we had a, we had how many matches?
SPEAKER_01: We have like, just say Reno and Sago, they were head to head and Reno won. And just say that, what would Dave's chance against this show? When Reno comes back or- Both of those guys, Dave has a great chance against, in my opinion. The one who I don't think he has as good a chance against is Yvonne, because I think- Because he would hook him. I think he'd hook him. And that's why you said that if he had that dragging hook- Yeah, if Dave Chafee has that back again, he's hard to beat.
SPEAKER_03: hard to beat, you know what I mean? But I don't know if he, I don't know if that's going to come back. I mean, you know, the neck injuries and all the stuff, I think that played a big role in how he has to, he had to change his style of arm wrestling, you know? I mean, he's perfect for top rolling because his hands so big and his forearm so long, but what made Dave Chaffee, Dave Chaffee was that inside power and just ridiculous side pressure, you know? So I don't know, man. It's, it's a very exciting division. Here's the deal. It's June, 2025.
SPEAKER_01: If I have not pulled LeBron by July, 2026, I'm definitely going in the super heavyweight. I'm going down to the heavyweight division. Um, but we don't know what might happen between now and then, you know, I might not have a good nose. Maybe, maybe, maybe like, listen, just because you pull in heavyweight. I mean, listen, you say you are 131 kilo. I don't tell you something, even if you make 115.
SPEAKER_01: Probably next day you can make over 120, 125. You understand? So just because you go to heavyweight, it doesn't mean that...
SPEAKER_03: you need another year to reach the super weight again. No, no, I get it. I get it. I mean, listen, my body fat is high enough right now that I could just drop body fat and probably be very close to just a quick little water cut. Like I can drop 15 pounds of body fat and then have a 10 pound water cut and I just made weight. You know what I mean? Like it's not that, well, I guess it's more than that. Cause I'm, what am I? 288 and it's 253. So I guess I'm 35 pounds away. Okay. So it's more than I thought.
SPEAKER_01: Trust me, trust me, trust me. I know you could do it, yeah. And, Georgii, Devon versus Alex, left arm. It seems that Alex is stronger, but I would like Alex to win. Ford me, he is, I don't know,
SPEAKER_04: First, Georgii said that he thinks that Alex is stronger than Devon. And also he would like Alex to win because they are friends.
SPEAKER_04: But still he thinks that 55-45 in Devon's favor. He thinks that Alex could win first one or two rounds. And that is all. The other day I had Alex and Morozov as my guests.
SPEAKER_01: I also had a video chat with Alex. Do you guys know the term, burning the ships? Burning ships? Yeah. Burning the ships means that, like, this is about historical thing, you know, they just went to conquer, you know, land. And then when they come with the ships,
SPEAKER_01: And then when they saw a huge army, they were intimidated and soldiers wanted to go back with the ships, you know, and then the commander just burned all the ships. There's no coming back. So Alex right now, it looks like he burned all the ships. No, no going back after losing. And I think Alex, we will see the strongest Alex. I don't know who's going to win, but the shape that Alex is in now, we haven't seen before.
SPEAKER_04: And we tell you his story. Ivan, what is your prediction about this match? I do not know Devon's shape at all. A year ago, he was not very impressive with his left. If he is about the same as he was a year or more, I would bet on Alex.
SPEAKER_04: But if his left became much stronger, then I don't know. Michael? I do not know Devon's left hand at all. Yeah, I mean, it's not as good as his right, but still very technical. Maybe less horsepower. Michael, how do you see this match?
SPEAKER_03: I think Alex is the favorite, but you have to bet on Devon, right? How do you not bet on Devon? You know what I mean? Like he's his mental game and his ability to, to fatigue someone in the setup and pump your hand and just bleed you like, like, uh, Yorkie said, I mean, Alex could win the first two.
SPEAKER_03: But if Devon puts a brakes on him anywhere he gets in his head, and part of it's gonna be getting in his head. If he puts a brakes on him and commences to talking a massive amount of crap to him, it's, I don't know, man. I'm taking Devon, although I think Alex is the favorite. I think Alex has the strength, I think Alex is the stronger arm wrestler. I mean- Okay, okay, what does the favorite mean? Favorite means that the one that you believe is gonna win.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I'm not saying, uh, I think he's, I think the favorite as in the masses think that everything we've seen, every practice video, everything we've ever seen would put you as Alex being the favorite, but I still think Devon's probably going to win. Okay. So you are saying that his favorites in a, like, if you just took the information that's available, if you took the information that's available and every time we've seen them pull and everything else and the styles and everything, and the fact that he just got ran over by data cam, you're sure, you know, he's going to come back hungry as shit. Um,
SPEAKER_03: Can we say that he was ran over by Doddikan or do you think that especially the round one was? Oh, no, round one was great, but Doddikan's a bad dude, right? And I really told Devon, I was like, I think his explosiveness and just sheer aggression is gonna win him the match. And that's kind of how it ended up, right? But I mean, I'm picking Devon. So if you ask who I'm picking, I'm picking Devon.
SPEAKER_01: Comment guy says Michael even deep down you would bet on Devon if you ever face him If I facing yeah, I will bet everything on me. Okay? It's awesome, but when Devon I face again I
SPEAKER_03: He's gonna get a very, very strong version of me. And it's gonna take the very best version he's ever had against me to beat me the next time we arm wrestle. Because I'm gonna keep progressing, he's gonna keep progressing. And stylistically, people are like, Devon knows how to arm wrestle. Well, I know how to arm wrestle Devon too. So I think I like the match a lot. But a lot of people think that I just think Devon's my superior and I don't.
SPEAKER_03: Just say that if a week later you would be facing Devon, where would your money go? Right now? Yeah. I bet on me right now. Devon's right looks great. Devon's right looks great. And the Devon that's going to show up against Vitaly in August may be the best Devon ever. But if I was pulling Devon this next Saturday instead of pulling Jorgi, I would bet on me.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I mean, there is no disrespect in believing you. No, I mean, you have to believe in yourself, right? Yes, I agree. Honestly, I don't know if Devon is going to be able to, I'm 50-50 with Devon and Vitaly. I'm 50-50. I have no idea how strong Vitaly is, because I feel like I'm really strong, and I did a great round one with him. But Devon's advantages usually are he has the better levers. He's got the longer leverage. He doesn't have that going against him. Allen the things that makes Devon Devon outside of his mental game,
SPEAKER_03: is his longer lever oftentimes. Now, Devon does have crazy pronation, crazy riser strength, and those things might play a role. But I don't think Devon stops people as well as I stop people. So I think he's catching Vitaly down here somewhere. I don't know, man. I'm excited to see that match. If he catches Vitaly somewhere here, and if Vitaly does the same thing, do you think that Vitaly has a chance?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, cuz Devon's longer than me, which puts him closer to the pin pad than I was. You know what I mean? Like Devon's arms longer, so he can't, look how far back I was, but yet Vitaly was still able to reach me, right? Devon's forearm's gonna be another inch or so longer. That's gonna give Vitaly more space to press on. I don't know, man. I have no idea. It's 50-50. Just like I think me and Devon will be 50, okay, 50.5 to 49.5 my way. Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, so, Georgii, Ermes Gasparini vs. Levan Saginashvili. I really want Ermes to win, not that I'm rooting for him or against Levan, but I think Levan is bored and he needs to...
SPEAKER_00: I got excited, let's say, and lost at least one of my fights. But I'm afraid that this will not happen, because Levan will prepare well against RMS. He will prepare better than against anyone else. And most likely Levan will win. Perhaps RMS will win one round in the fall.
SPEAKER_04: Yorgy said that he would like Ermes to win, not because, just because he thinks that Levan is bored and he would like to see him losing even one armfight, but he doesn't think it will happen. Maybe one round possible, but not the whole armfight.
SPEAKER_04: My opinion. Gyorgy also said that Levan would be really motivated and really well prepared for RMS. So RMS will have little chances. Ivan, before you say your opinion, I want to tell you what I know. When they pulled first time in Dubai,
SPEAKER_01: Ermes didn't believe at all that he had a chance. He said that maybe one round if I stop him, like, it will be enough for him. And he said that when he lost first two rounds, he looked at the Levan corner and Irakli was laughing at him, like, making fun. This is what he says. And he gets so angry, and that's how he started giving his everything, like, by round three. This time, when he pulled Michael,
SPEAKER_01: And Ermes said, maybe I don't pull him now, maybe end of the year. I'm not sure if I'm ready. And then a few days later, he said, okay, I'm pulling him. I'm pulling him. And he was like, not sure. I just talked with him even today. He's very confident. It doesn't mean he's going to win, but just to let you understand that he was going Dubai to lose. He's going Chicago to win.
SPEAKER_01: It doesn't mean that he's going to win, but just you understand that the mindset is very important. If you go to lose, I mean, you can't really perform your best. OK, now your prediction, I want to hear. I think that both athletes showed everything in their last fight and made conclusions. And I think that Levan
SPEAKER_01: has more chances, again. Okay, more chances means 70? I would not say 70, 55, 45. Wow, so you are saying that actually the match is not like there is no huge favorite, but Levan is favorite, but not like huge favorite. Okay, I understand. Yeah. And how do you see the elements like winning that match? Like the 45%?
SPEAKER_01: The only way, like he did last time. Last time, yeah. So he needs to protect his grenade and stop him. And Michael, let's go Michael. I've been 75-25 Levan this whole time and I'll probably stick with that.
SPEAKER_03: And people think that that means it's a whitewash, it's a blowout. But I think Ermes has phenomenal chances. And Jorge said he thinks he might win one round. I think if he wins one round, he wins the whole thing. But it depends which rounds, which one rounds.
SPEAKER_03: or the 6th round, because they said they are going to pull all 6 rounds. Oh, I wasn't aware of that. I didn't know they were going to do all 6. Okay. So, yeah. I mean, if he wins it before the match is over, if it's 3-0 and he wins round 4, I think he wins the whole thing. Oh, okay. So, you are saying that he has a chance to win one round
SPEAKER_03: and then his chance is 25% to win that one round before the match is over. And you are saying that once he wins that one round, then his chance is going to increase to almost hundreds. In my opinion, anyone who ever beats LaVon one round and literally beats him, like LaVon doesn't foul out, like they press his arm to the pad or they pin him somehow, the emotion that's going to take over in that athlete, realizing what they've just done, will be enough to carry them through the rest of the match, in my opinion.
SPEAKER_03: I think the high that you would be on after that one pin and the effect that that would potentially have on LeBron actually getting pinned, I think it turns the tide completely. So if anyone's able to get one pin before the match is officially over, I think that person can win the whole thing. And I think RMS is someone who is trained specifically to do that. I still think it's 75% chance LeBron comes out of this thing 4-0.
SPEAKER_01: But there's a 25% chance that Levan... It's a big chance. It's a really big chance. It is. To me, 25% chance, it's huge. I mean, you give me 25% chance of lottery, I'm the happiest guy in the world. You know what I'm saying? 25% chance is a lot. And Michael, you pull against Ernest. What can you say about him? About his stable IQ, about his well-roundedness? Like, did you find him someone special?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I mean, I think he's as intelligent as anybody who's ever armwrestled in the I mean his. He's been doing it like his father is a world champion. He's been doing it forever and he's just grown into what we see today, which is a 6 foot to 285 pound specimen who is designed to be who he's built to be an arm wrestler. I mean he he everything about him is arm wrestling, right? So his public. I think he probably has the strongest.
SPEAKER_03: hammer curl type back pressure in the world. I don't know if anyone else can do what he does. I think he might have the strongest riser curl in the world. I don't know if anyone else can rise a curl that much weight. Those two things right there make him a very worthy opponent for anyone. You know, do you
SPEAKER_01: smell like not the same exact but similar clothes of John Brzenk about with Ermes like young years starting well around of course of course I mean the smoothness and then the transition with just I feel the same like like
SPEAKER_03: Like you're another golden boy, you know, like he's not. He's definitely he's a very special athlete in our sport. And the fact that he is so invested and committed to globally being the global number one arm wrestler on the planet. I mean, it's his like that's his that's his purpose. Right. So.
SPEAKER_03: I'm very excited to see the match. I'm a huge LeBron fan. And the people out there, I'm just gonna put this out there, the people who talk about LeBron's cheek curl and how he used his back and all that shit, he has 396 pounds up here like this.
SPEAKER_03: That's insane. Like if it was a strong man doing it, I wouldn't be that impressed, but we know how strong LaVon is at arm wrestling. And this is the most he's ever done. So we already, you add that to the fact that he's already the unbeatable mountain Mount Everest of our sport. And now he has even stronger than he's ever been. I mean, he is look.
SPEAKER_01: Armend is facing a very prepared Levan. You know what I mean? What can you say about those people who doesn't take seriously what Levan needs? I mean, the only thing I can say is go do it yourself. You know what I'm saying? Like, just understand. I would get your buddies to get on each side of the bar and hand you 396 pounds like this and see if it doesn't cripple you a minute. You know what I'm saying? Ermes, Michael says that you need to go and do it yourself.
SPEAKER_01: I forgot that he wasn't as impressed with it as I am. But it's insanely impressive. Yes, it's insanely impressive. Which one is more impressed? Like just say that Devon doing that one rep, 180 kilo or Ermes doing 92 kilo eight reps. Just say that if Ermes would do 100 kilo one rep, would it be similar?
SPEAKER_03: Impressive. Absolutely, absolutely. And that's how he's going to win. If he wins, it's because of that movement and that Roderick Curl. Those are the two things that I think he's stronger than Levan have. Levan says that Ermes is doing with the full wristband and like bicep weight. Do you agree or do you think it's a bad question? I still think it translates to arm wrestling.
SPEAKER_03: It translates to arm wrestling, you know what I mean? So to me, people want to criticize form all the time. And I'm a guy who I don't care as long as you're moving heavier weight than you previously held. At some point, you're going to get in a match and you're going to be in the position that you're training. And that's just going to translate, you know, in my opinion. I mean, I don't know, man, I've just, I've been doing this a long time. And if you, if you know how to arm wrestle, if you get stronger anywhere, you're better arm wrestling.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know how Irakli pulls with his left, but he knows that Match
SPEAKER_01: used to pull left rather good. So he would bet on Matt. That's interesting. Yeah. And Michael, this one I'm going to ask you, Alan Ford versus Ryan Ballinger. I like Alan Ford a lot. Alan Ford's a hand arm wrestler. His hand and wrist are very good.
SPEAKER_03: I don't think he has the arm that Alan Belanger has, so I think it could be 3-2 Alan Belanger. I think Alan Ford might can get a couple of fast pins on him, but I think Ryan Belanger sinks that hook on, he puts that arm in there, and it may not even be a hook, it may just be his arm power. He may just get tied to the strap with him and be able to just out horsepower him. I think Belanger wins 3-2 or better. Okay, and Fia versus Allen, do you know Allen?
SPEAKER_03: I am not familiar, but obviously, I mean, if she's pulling Fia, she obviously is a badass. But I can't bet against Fia. After what Fia did to Malin, I don't even know anybody that way that could beat her, you know? Georgii, do you know Arsen Khachatryan? Do you know him? Arsen Khachatryan? I've seen him.
SPEAKER_00: Arsen Khachatryan, he fought at AMC. Yes, I remember him. He is Arsen versus Paul Elin. Khachatryan is good in the upper division. Paul Elin is also very strong. Khachatryan was not seen for a long time.
SPEAKER_04: He would say Paul Lim. Paul Lim would win? Yes, but he doesn't know for sure. Mainly, he didn't see Arsen lately. And Ivan, what's your opinion? I think it's a 50-50 match. It could be a 50-50 match.
SPEAKER_04: It's difficult for me to say also. I know that Arsen is good both at chopper and hook. He is more versatile, I would say. But we'll see. I think he's a little bigger than Paul.
SPEAKER_03: I think he's taller. Maybe a little bit taller, yeah. Yeah, he's taller, but I don't think he's bigger, necessarily. So, Arsen's the guy that's been pulling out, like, in Arizona, like, he's out in California. Yeah, he pulled Andre... 220 division, like... Yeah, he beats Andre. So, I think Paul Elin's a level above Andre. So, I think Paul Elin. Hmm, okay. And Michael, do you know Ivan Portela?
SPEAKER_01: I do not know. Okay. Who's he pulling? Is it Marina Joseph? Who's he pulling? Yeah, that kid's impressive. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Yeah. And if he wins this one, he will be winning his third EVW match in a row.
SPEAKER_03: That's impressive. That's impressive. Yeah. He's a good kid, too. Rebecca liked his walkout song at King of the Table in December. She enjoyed that kid. He's, you know, I've heard a lot of people brag about him. And then we saw him beat Kevin Pavlo in a hook. And then he had a good Arlington performance as well. So, yeah, he's a very impressive young man. Do you know Wallace? Wallace Dilley? Yeah. Yeah. So, I... Okay, you know the man. He's his opponent, you know.
SPEAKER_03: Ricard Ricard. Yeah. Um, I think I want to say Ricard because of he's so young and just powerful. So I would say 51 49 Ricard, but Wallace Dilley had a very good performance versus Marsau Barbosa, um, at that Salt Lake event. So it's 50 50, man. I did say Ricard on several other lives that I was on when people asked me.
SPEAKER_03: But Wallace Dilley, he's a big, thick dude. So it's gonna be a great match. It's gonna be a great match. I don't think either one of them sweeps. I don't think it's a 3-0. That Ricard kid's impressive. He's an impressive specimen. Yeah, I agree. The guy is a very special guy, yeah. And Wagner Bortalato versus
SPEAKER_03: Manuel Batalha. Is this right or left? It's a left arm match. Left arm. So it's hard for me to pick Manuel against Wagner because I always thought Manuel was a right-handed specialist, you know. He's left arm world champion, super heavyweight champion. Oh, really? Yeah. Okay. I don't think he has the arm that Wagner has, but he probably has a better top roll.
SPEAKER_03: And it'll be if he, if he beats him outside, if he gets the outside move and gets him outside of his shoulder, he beats him. If he gets caught inside that shoulder is over with. So, I mean, 50, 50, I guess, but Wagner, he hasn't had the best performances lately. You know what I mean? Um, but he's such a long time. He had, he had a, he had an injury like you. And then I think he had the surgery, I think. And like after one year, he's coming back again.
SPEAKER_03: He's so big now. He's such a big dude. So yeah, I would say 50-50. I don't know. How many matches are on this card? 10, 11? How many matches? I think 11 or 12. Oh, wow. Really? OK. Do you know the order yet? Who? The order. Oh, I know it. Yeah, I know. Before we finish, I would like to ask,
SPEAKER_00: It will be a very difficult match. I hope Vitaly will prepare well.
SPEAKER_00: He is more responsible than he usually is. I know that he doesn't take preparation seriously. I think that Vitaly will be uncomfortable for Devon. 49 to 51 in favor of Vitaly. Vitaly has a good start.
SPEAKER_00: Big hand, strong grip, strong fingers. Yes, endurance on the side of Devon. Yes, perhaps Devon is more technical, he practices more on the grip, maybe more cunning. But it seems to me that it is the big blade, the palm of Vitalik will play a big role.
SPEAKER_04: He would like Vitaly to win. He would like Vitaly to get 100% ready for this fight. He thinks it will be a very difficult fight. But at the same time, he thinks that Vitaly is not comfortable for Devon because of his levels and his big hand. Vitaly has little advantage in size.
SPEAKER_04: he gives Vitaly 51-49, so very little advantage. Devon for sure is more technical, he has better endurance, but still Georgii believes that Vitaly has a little advantage.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, one super chat. Dino says, yeah, Levan will be in shock if Ermes pins him. And Ivan, what's your opinion? We are finishing. I just want to have your opinion about this match and Michael's. And then we finish. About Vitaly Levan? Yeah. I agree with Georgii. I think it's a very difficult fight for Vitaly. And actually, I was very surprised by
SPEAKER_04: his match against Michael. I thought that it would be easier for him. So I'm now really worried about Vitaly. But I still believe that he has chances, especially because he seems to have good floor press, yes. Because before Michael, I was not sure that he had such a move. And he himself didn't know that he had such a move. But now he feels good about it and
SPEAKER_03: That's why I think he has chances. OK, Michael. I think it's 5050. Rebecca thinks it's 6040 Devon because it's Devon. I still go back to the the levers you know Devon so used to being the bigger longer athlete and he won't have any of those advantages versus Vitaly and then we know Devon likes to slip. Can Devon slip with him if Vitaly tries to hold on to him?
SPEAKER_03: I don't know. I mean, you think you can, but Devon will let his hand go and just let his fingers. If the Vitaly plants those hands, he might actually get a pin outside the strap. There's a lot of, there's a lot of, it's a crazy, crazy match. Um, it would be fun to be there to watch. I'm pretty confident that I won't be, but it would, it's a match that
SPEAKER_03: That is going to be amazing. You know, um, if, if Devon pulls it off, so here's the deal. I'm gonna ask you this. I know we got to go. Um, you said, cause I'd heard you previously say this prior to my match with, um, Vitaly that have little Ermes beats LaVon that you might give LaVon an immediate rematch if he wants one. But you had said the winner of me and Vitaly was going to pull the winner of that match of December.
SPEAKER_01: and now Vitaly's pulling Devon. So, if Ermes beats Devon, is it an automatic rematch for Devon, or would he pull the winner of Vitaly to Devon? There is nothing automatic rematch or something. It is, first of all, Devon doesn't want to pull Devon in December. But if Ermes beats him, he might want to pull Ermes in December. You see what I'm saying? Oh, if Ermes beats Devon? Yeah. Listen, listen. If anyone is
SPEAKER_01: getting a match, I think the whole community, we owe this to Levan, if Levan loses that match. If this guy has been the champion last, like, seven years, and if only once he's losing, and he says that, no, I don't want to pull anyone else, but I want to pull against this match, we are 1-1, if there is anyone on this earth, if Devon is asking for a third shot for Levan,
SPEAKER_01: I mean, Levan can ask the second match for, I mean, the revenge match for... No, no, I get it, I get it. I just didn't know where you stood on that, like... No, I just think that Levan is ahead of everyone about that kind of credits. Because... Of course, of course. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, if he wanted it, he deserves it, of course, so... If he wants, if he wants. Maybe he will say, let me rest. But I don't know, he's not, I mean...
SPEAKER_01: I don't think he has any plan to lose anyways. I'm asking this question only because you are saying that I need to assume that this happened, you know. No, no, I'm just curious. I was just curious. Yeah, yeah. I mean, Devon and Ermes, I'm same distance, like, as the same athletes. Yeah. And Ivan, I didn't hear, did you say that any percentages you give for that match?
SPEAKER_04: I would also give 51-49 for Italy.
SPEAKER_01: And then Michael says 50 50. So I honestly have no idea. Like, I honestly have no idea. So I can't even give a favor, you know, this match also, according to me, I mean, it's a 50 50 match. Very close. I see Devon winning that match. I see Vitaly's winning that match. It's totally up to the preparation and the shape that we will see on that day. Will Vitaly be in the same shape he pull you or even better?
SPEAKER_01: And Devon, will he be in a shape that we have never seen him before? We don't know. I expect he will be, honestly. You know what I mean? Like, Devon, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Anyways, guys, thank you very, very much to you, Michael, to you, Georgii Dzeranov, and Ivan Matushenko. Thank you for joining, and thanks to everyone who came here to watch. And let me see you one more time. Georgii. Georgii, get yours back up there. Let's see it.
SPEAKER_01: Gary, one more time. Show. I don't know. He might got me. He might got me. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. We will see. We will see. Take care, guys. Take care. Just last one week. Stay healthy. And good luck to all of you. Take care, guys. God bless. Happy Father's Day to the fathers out there.
