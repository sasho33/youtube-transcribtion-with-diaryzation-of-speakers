SPEAKER_04: Hello, hello. Hi. How are you, Alex? Good, good, good. You? Good, good. Very good. Very good. Soon, we will have our guests and we will have very good time.
SPEAKER_04: with your great translation. I'll try my best. I mean, the people close to people got about translation, you and Pavlo, and also Tornike, but only for German and English. Tornike was really good, yeah. Yeah, Tornike is also good, yeah. You do Russian
SPEAKER_04: Georgii and English, while I think Pavlo can do Ukrainian and Russian, but not Georgii. Yeah. Let's see in a few minutes they will join us. Let me share the link.
SPEAKER_01: The card is getting pretty crazy. Every match that is announced, I'm like, oh, oh, oh. And people are like, oh, wow. Finally, you know, the King of the Table is the same level as the East versus West, you know? Yeah. I love it. There are some good ones, too. Lower weight classes get a lot of attention now. I like it a lot. It's not only super heavyweights.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I mean, that is, my friend, it is a bit like we need to involve personality as well, you know. I mean, it can't be only like competing. People want to get to know the people and
SPEAKER_04: athletes need to really be more social, you know. I mean, we basically got the most personality-based match ever. Nugo and Matt is just... Oh, yeah. It's just too much. Too much. Yeah. I go in the bunker. I will watch this match from a bunker. I thought that, you know, it would be Wagner versus Matt, but this one is different. This one is crazier, you know.
SPEAKER_04: Do you know, I said I still didn't set or something. I just wanted to surprise the community. But do you know when I set this match? I set that match about less than one hour after Matt Mask was stronger. I mean, I started to set right away, but it was finalized in less than one hour.
SPEAKER_04: after that match. I'm pretty sure Nugo was very happy when you offered him that match. Yeah, yeah, he was, he was, he was. No, Nugo is, Nugo, I mean, I think Nugo is like saying like Tatashins, you know, if you would just say, I set you
SPEAKER_04: against Levan, he will probably say, no Engin. But other than that, he is most likely happy pulling against anyone. Maybe I'm exaggerating, but Todd is that way. Trust me.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, once I remember I said, like it was beginning of the East versus West. I said, Todd, do you want to pull Ivan Masyshenko or Gyorgy Dzeranov? And he said, which one is stronger? And I said, normally they are like same power, but now Dzeranov is heavier. And he said, okay, give me that one. He was, yeah, he was like that, yeah. Hey guys, can you hear me? Hello, hello, Kamil, how are you? Hello, can you hear me?
SPEAKER_04: Yes, we hear you. Just let me... Let me put this charger. And so we will not have any... As-salamu alaykum. Wa alaykum as-salam. How are you, my friend? Georgii. Good? How are you? Is everything okay? Yes, everything is fine. We are fine, thank God.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, they got everything's perfect. Yeah, everything is perfect. That's good. That's good. I'm happy. Yeah. Oh, no. Okay. Let's let's start. Okay. Oh, you're here. Did you see? Come on.
SPEAKER_04: Alex, can you tell Georgii to turn his phone sideways? Oh, there we go. Okay, let's start. Georgii, we didn't see you since November. How is everything going?
SPEAKER_00: We saw you last time in November after that. Pavlyas, how are you doing? How is everything going? In fact, everything is going well. I was taking care of my health, in particular, my teeth. I didn't train for about three months, I didn't go to the gym at all. But now I started to train persistently. Ford more than two months I went to the gym about five or six times a week.
SPEAKER_01: yeah uh after after the november match i was dealing with my health mainly my teeth and i wasn't in the gym i wasn't training at all like didn't even step in the gym for like three months but two months ago around two months ago i started training very heavily i go like crazy about five or six times a week i train now and i'm getting really good um
SPEAKER_04: Georgii, do you realize that, you know, communists setting his arms like the best way to intimidate you? What do you think about this? Kamil, yes, he's like...
SPEAKER_01: He likes to impress the audience and the opponent as well. Kamil really likes to leave an impression on the public and on the opponent as well. He really likes to show off. Yeah, is that true Kamil? You like to show off? Yeah, a little bit. He knows me already, I see.
SPEAKER_03: He already knows me. Yeah. Yeah. What's your weight right now? Oh, I can show you right now. I'll show you right now. Okay. 138, yeah. Wow.
SPEAKER_00: 138? Or 28? 38. Arsen you serious? Pretty big. Wow, I have never seen him this big. Can you ask him if he's ever been this big? No, actually, I was 132 in November in the morning. Well, without clothes, on a hungry stomach. And now, in the morning, the same.
SPEAKER_01: In November, fresh in the morning, no food, no clothes, nothing. I was 132. Now I am 135, around that.
SPEAKER_04: okay yeah so because he ate and he has clothes and everything yeah no no in the morning 1 35 clean no no no no now he's 138. yeah so when you like minus the food and clothes and everything you know yeah so he's a little bit bigger yeah hey coming you were trying to show off and intimidate him now you saw his weight you suddenly your face color changed to the white and you look very intimidated why is that
SPEAKER_03: No, not really because I was, I saw somewhere he's 140 kilos. So now he's lighter. So now I'm a little bit disappointed. Where is his weight? He's gone. Oh, you disappointed him. I don't know.
SPEAKER_01: I got a flu, I got a bit sick, and two kilograms went away, sorry. So it's gonna come back, huh?
SPEAKER_04: I think so, yeah. So, Kamil, what do you think about Georgii as an opponent? Is he at your level?
SPEAKER_03: You know, I'm watching him on social media and I see what he's doing and he's doing pretty good, you know. I am very impressed of his power and I try his exercise and that's not easy what he's doing. So I know I am dealing with the big horsepower guy
SPEAKER_03: And I know how huge is his hand. So I will have to match up this power and there is no other way to do anything. I have to just match up. So I think it won't be easy, the match.
SPEAKER_03: He was showing yesterday some pronation lift, but he swapped the sides. And I don't know why he doesn't show the left top roll power. Maybe he's injured, maybe he's not that strong, but this is a little bit interesting for me. But the side power, the side pressure power is amazing. I am really impressed. And the wrist power also is very impressed.
SPEAKER_03: So, so I knew, I know this will be really good fight for me. And, you know, fighting with the one of the best hookers in the world will show me basically my place where I am. So because, you know, I am fighting last few fights with the top roles. And now I will find out with the hooker with the guy who is hooking where I am.
SPEAKER_01: Alex, can you tell us? He asked Kamil, what do you think about Georgii Duran? And he says, when I look at the social media, the videos that you upload, I'm always surprised because I try your exercises and the weight is really big, it's very difficult for me, there are things that I can't repeat.
SPEAKER_01: One thing is very interesting to me. When you showed the pronation, you turned the video around. Why don't you show how much you lift with your left hand, he said. Maybe you have injuries there, or maybe you don't lift that much. But about, for example, Bok, you have an incredibly strong hand, also amazing weights. And he is very happy to fight with you, because his last fights were mostly in the top.
SPEAKER_00: And now against him, one of the best hookers, and he is very interested in fighting with you, and he is glad that he has such a strong opponent. So, in fact, no, I don't have any injuries on my left hand now. On the contrary, a little, well, a little worried about the right shoulder and the shoulder with brachialis. Well, not to the extent that I couldn't do it or, let's say,
SPEAKER_00: It interfered with my training process. Yes, after training, sometimes before sleep, they prevent me from falling asleep. But the next day, usually, praise be to God, the pain passes. And on the left hand now... I just haven't fought for a long time with serious opponents on the left hand. I haven't sparred so actively for a long time. Therefore, it seems to me that the left...
SPEAKER_00: Maybe technically she is lagging behind now, but in terms of freshness and strength, she is about the same as the right one. Well, there are moments, I won't say, somewhere stronger, somewhere weaker, but about the same.
SPEAKER_01: You know, I don't have an injury on left arm, quite the opposite. Sometimes my right shoulder gets in the way, but I sleep and then it goes away. With left arm, I maybe didn't have as much of a tough opponents like him. So it doesn't have as much of experience.
SPEAKER_01: but i feel like if it's not as technical it's a bit more fresh i have around the same power sometimes in some areas it's stronger than my right arm or in some areas my left arm is actually stronger too and yes she's showing off but no injuries on left arm all good yeah okay um
SPEAKER_00: What do you think about Kamil's wrestling style? What can I say about Kamil's wrestling style? To be honest, I like Kamil from the bottom of my heart. But I don't like his wrestling style. We got used to it.
SPEAKER_00: On the contrary, try to somehow, I don't know, there is a favorable position due to the fact that you twist your wrist, and he is looking for a favorable position in order to give his wrist as close to his shoulder as possible and cover it, it turns out. Yes, plus, well, I just can't cheat. I'm used to honest wrestling. If I could do this, how, let's say, it can be done there,
SPEAKER_00: let's say, four. The same Monster Todd, Devon Larratt, Kamil Yeblonskiy. I might have spoken differently, I would have reasoned differently, but at this particular time, I am for an honest fight. Therefore, Kamil is the guy, but I don't like his fight. But, how to say, here, to be honest,
SPEAKER_00: He once again said that if Flo Press is properly exposed, properly reacted, I think he is not so dangerous. And not only I think so.
SPEAKER_00: than for even a good top, which Kamil has already demonstrated to us. And against those, and against these athletes. We saw how he fought with hookers. Perhaps, yes, on the left we did not see strong hookers, but on the right we saw how he fought against top fighters on the left. Even with top fighters, he gave them a very good fight.
SPEAKER_01: You know, I really like Kamil as a person. He's like super guy, but I don't really like his style because for me, like we are usually, we are used to being different, to do the opposite. You always find a good position at the changes, get closer, curl your wrist, but he does the opposite. He gets the good position by giving it away, jamming his shoulder and getting over. Ford me, it's unusual for me.
SPEAKER_01: And I can't do as much of trickery. I can't do as much shooting in a setup. No, I'm not like, let's say, like Michael Todd or like Devon or Michael. No, I'm not like this. And for top rollers, when Camille said that I'm finally pulling a hook puller, we saw how you do against top rollers as well. And he gives both a great fight.
SPEAKER_00: He always, even against top-rollers, against hook-pullers, he's always very good. Can Georgii tell us which style he plans to pull as a main weapon or surprise? Well, what can I say? I'm going to fight him in the hook. I'm not going to say that it's a secret. But if I don't succeed at all, then of course I'll try to...
SPEAKER_01: No, what can I say? I'll pull a hook, I'll try to get a hook, I'll pull in a hook style, but maybe if I don't have anything left, I'll definitely try to change my style and I'll just do anything possible.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I want to ask the runoff. Yeah, he he liked me, but he don't like my technique. And why he don't like my technique because he don't know how to fight or he's afraid or he just hate the flow press.
SPEAKER_00: You said that you like him as a person, but you don't like his style. Why is that? Arsen you afraid of him? Or maybe you can't fight like that? Why don't you like him? Well, maybe partially he's right. I'm telling you, I can't cheat. I can't. If I could fight like that, maybe I would have a different opinion. But I'm not afraid of the flop press.
SPEAKER_00: Why should I be afraid of him? As they say, I'm afraid in this case... Well, not that I'm afraid, but it will be unprofitable for me if the judges allow me to, let's say, to get my shoulder up at the start and to start, roughly speaking. That is, as I already said in one public, I don't need help from the judge, I need justice.
SPEAKER_00: And there I always fight for honesty. Maybe, yes, the audience doesn't like it, they like trash talk, they like some intrigues, swearing and so on. But I can't overcome myself. I can't do anything else. And so I... Well, why don't I like it, again? Because to passivate the brush and enter this position, well...
SPEAKER_00: First of all, for the popularization of the arm, the same kins move or flop press, for beginners, for beginners, I would not recommend it. Because, first of all, it is, how to say, a little traumatic, and the same kins move, you have to work it out, not everyone can do it. It is not as easy a fight as it seems, but it is purposeful to train it.
SPEAKER_00: I wouldn't recommend it to the younger generation. Why? Well, I don't like this movement and that's it. I can't even give a full correct answer.
SPEAKER_01: You know, what can I say? Maybe he's right because if I could pull like this, maybe I wouldn't say so. Maybe I wouldn't say that I don't like flop press if I could do it. It's just a bit different for me. I'm not used to that and I wouldn't say I'm afraid and scared of it. I just don't want in the setup that his shoulder gets too forward, that he goes before the goal. Allen I need, I don't need referees to help me. I just need a fair fight and that's all I want.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe people don't like that I pull fairly. Maybe they want all the screaming and the show off, but I can't really get over myself and I can't beat myself to it to make a show over nothing. But for the flop press, for the Kings move, it's deceptively difficult to pull like this.
SPEAKER_01: and especially when like let's say younger generations look and they see a king's move or a flop press it's very hard and it's not as easy as it looks like it's uh you need so much time to develop a good king's move and a flop press it's just it's very difficult side to pull but i still don't like
SPEAKER_03: Can you ask him, can you ask him if he, if he tried to do press like not supinated, like, like, like that way, did he try? Can you ask him if he, can you ask him if he, can you ask him if he, can you ask him if he, can you ask him if he, can you ask him if he, can you ask him if he, can you ask him if he, can you ask him if he, can you ask him if he, can you ask him if he, can you ask him if he, can you ask him if he, can you ask him if he, can you ask him if he, can you ask him if he, can you ask him if he, can you ask him if he, can you ask him if he, can you ask him if he, can you ask him if he, can you ask him if he, can you ask him if he, can you ask him if he, can you ask him if he, can you ask him if he, can you ask him if he,
SPEAKER_00: Without a wrist, not in an attacking position, but in a defensive position. But this is not exactly the flow press that... When I was knocked out, I had nothing left to do, except for the defensive position. There were several fights that I even won, but it was hard. After that, my tendons hurt quite seriously, the elbow ones.
SPEAKER_01: no uh i haven't did it like offensively the only time that i had like this position is when i was defending they took my wrist and i was only defending it and i actually won those few matches that i pulled like this but it just puts so much strain on your elbow tendons and it hurts after that so i don't pull like this offensively um coming um people people think that uh like
SPEAKER_04: There is someone who wrote that once you said that this will be a test for you against the inside puller, because everyone is just trying to go outside against you. And somebody said that Matushenko did that, but Matushenko and you pull right arm, not left arm. And do you think that inside pullers have better chance against you than outside?
SPEAKER_03: You know, Ivan Matuszenko is different guy. He is...
SPEAKER_03: so danger for me because he know exactly what to do to beat flop press uh the runoff don't have that i think he don't have that because i talking about speed and same like vitaly whenever he start first he kicked me out from my power which i'm training so so that the issue is not really hooker the issue is that the speed
SPEAKER_03: so whoever is like like super fast it will kick out me of my lane but um after my match with morozov i get very angry myself and i and i train my hook um last six months basically all the time and i believe my hook will be now really good i think
SPEAKER_03: And if the runoff is afraid that I will flop press him, you can tell him that I will not flop press him. I will get in the hook, straight in the hook. And I want to see who is better. I want to just see that. And same thing I done with Morozov. If you look the fight with Morozov, I get in the hook, but I lost it. So he was stronger, but now I'm stronger and I want to try again. So we'll see what will happen.
SPEAKER_01: Georgii, Kamil is asking you, if you are afraid, he says that you guys can go inside. Arsen you afraid of his flop press? Here he explained that the hookers, how many of them scare him, how much speed, you know, there is Vitaly too, he is a top, but it is the speed when they knock you out of position, it is completely different. About Ivan, he said that...
SPEAKER_01: The worst part is not that Ivan is strong, but that he knocked him out of position, and that you can't do that, because he doesn't have speed. And Engin asks, are you afraid of the hook, not the flop press? Because Kamil said, I won't flop. If he thinks that I will do it, then it's not true. Six months after Morozov, I got angry at myself and persistently trained the hook. And I want to go straight from the first round with you in the hook and fight there.
SPEAKER_00: Well, how can I say? The question is, am I afraid of his hook? Yeah, so... The way he trained the hook. I'll put it this way, it's even more interesting for me. I want to test my hook. Because, to be honest, a long time ago... Yes, I remember, I got a good fight with Bortalato in the left hook.
SPEAKER_00: Well, again, I had two fights in the evening. It was the second one after Sergey Pervichenko. Plus, then I had a form, I weighed 120 kilograms. Yes, of course, personal weight does not matter, but then, after about a year and a half, I did not work out, for two months I somehow lost weight and went.
SPEAKER_00: I thought, who is Sergei? Bortalato, okay, on old jerseys. Ivan Matyushenko gave me such a good fight. Well, I'll put it this way, it's not a secret that I have, at least I had, defense in hooks. That is, I could fight from defense. Therefore, if he
SPEAKER_00: I will try to get him out of there, to get him out of position, not because of speed, but because of his physique. Yes, Ivan's speed is stronger, but still, I think, purely the physical aspect, well, with all due respect, I respect Ivan very much, I still have a little more physique.
SPEAKER_00: At this level, it plays a huge role. As some people say, I became stronger by 10-20%. No, it's enough to become 0.1% stronger, and it will be the main factor at this level.
SPEAKER_01: You know, I'm actually happy that Camille is saying that he wants to hook me, because it's been a while that I've tried it, and I really, really want to pull in a hook, so he's welcome. As for the speed aspect, and he gave an example of when he pulled against Sergey and Wagner on the East vs. West, and it was like a year and a half of basically no training. He got two months of training, get there, like, who's going to beat me? No way there's some strong people, some Sergey, and
SPEAKER_01: It doesn't really matter if he was 120 kilograms. He doesn't say like the excess weight really helps that much, but still he's bigger. Or Ivan, he gave an example. It's not a secret that I'm very good in defensive pulling. You could see my matches before, like I was very good at defensive pulling. And sure, I'm not as fast as Ivan.
SPEAKER_01: But I'm just that little bit, even though I respect him a lot, I'm a little bit stronger than him. And at that level this high, that little bit being stronger, it matters a lot. You know how usually people say, oh, I'm 20% stronger. The level is so high that you can get 0.1% stronger and it already matters. And it's just so difficult. So...
SPEAKER_01: i'm very happy that he he really wants to hook pull me uh maybe i'll get a defense and from there i'll just try to jam him out and get him out of position not without speed i'll get him out of position with my power okay and um george i have a question uh with left arm what is your uh score from the past against vitaly laletin
SPEAKER_00: On the left, do you remember your score with Vitaly? Yes, I remember. On the left hand, my score with him... Oh, let me see. On the left hand, my score with him is 2-2. 2-2. With left hand, two times Vitaly won and two times Dzeranov won? Yes. Okay. But I beat him, not in the hook.
SPEAKER_04: But I wasn't hurt pulling him. Yeah, yeah, I saw. He went with the top roll. Yeah, I saw. I saw. Yeah, I remember. And, and, and, Georgii, what did you think about Kamil's match with Vitaly? Well, it's a confrontation of styles. We understand that Kamil can... Vitaly, well...
SPEAKER_00: Conditionally. Maybe in fact, I don't know. Ford example, it will be easy for me to fight Kamil, and I, for example, I do not claim, I assume, and I will easily, for example, fight Kamil.
SPEAKER_00: We see and know perfectly well, and it really exists, especially in the 75th category, these all-possible triangles, squares, when there is a whole mess. It would seem that everything should be logical, one fights the second, the third this, but it doesn't work out. The same Kamil, well, he, how to say, he has such a ... against the top players.
SPEAKER_00: It was a very effective fight, especially against slow fighters. And if they missed the start, for example, I will say this. I saw how Kamil beat Vitaly twice. I will not say that Vitaly gave him the last rounds. Maybe he was a little distracted, maybe he was tired, he was already overwhelmed by pronators and shoulder injuries.
SPEAKER_00: And Kamil, in this position, with his, I don't know, 120-140 kg, he is pressing, how much he is pressing, I don't know, you know, a lot. He sat on it, and still the light battery will run out faster than this one here, in this case, Kamil, I think so.
SPEAKER_01: You know, I see that match as a battle of styles. How I think it is, it's, let's say Camille gave a very hard fight to Vitaly. Even if it happens, and let's say I beat Camille very easily, it doesn't mean that I'll get to win against Vitaly easily. It's so dependent. He gave an example of 75 kilograms, you know, all the triangles, the squares, like it should be so easy, like one beats the other. So this one's stronger, but it's not like this in styles.
SPEAKER_04: It is because Kamil is going to the arm and Georgii has stronger arm while Vitaly can take the wrist, but Kamil gives anyways. Kamil says, okay, please take it. While Di Dzeranov cannot really pull once his hand is taken. So it is easy to calculate, but yeah, I want to ask a question to Kamil. Obviously there is a beef between you and Devon and
SPEAKER_04: And then we recently saw Devon against Corey West. And how did you find Devon? Do you think that now he's ready to pull against you or he needs a little bit more time? I think according to him, he needs a little bit more time to pull against you. But what's your opinion? Yes, I would like to say, oh, Devon is super strong and I think he can beat me now. And then next event, he will fight me.
SPEAKER_03: You are playing games. You are just saying exactly what you don't believe, you know. Yeah, but the truth, what I think, I think he's quite far away from me, I think. Even now you think you can beat him dominantly? Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_03: i think yes because uh you know he is talking to his fans that he don't train his arm five six years but in this time he was keep pulling with this arm and his arm it was very strong and even if he started training now he will not increase increase
SPEAKER_03: like 20% in one year. There is no possible to do that. So he will increase but slowly, slowly. And I think he needed more time to get stronger but I don't know if this is possible in future because I am getting stronger as well. Every couple of months I see on my weights I am stronger and stronger. So I don't know how far he can go and I don't know how far I can go because I am not on my limits yet for sure.
SPEAKER_03: And what's your weight right now? 132. 132. Morning weight. I can show you. No, I believe you. I believe you, yeah. Anyways, guys, so I understand. Can I ask Dzeranov something? Yeah, go ahead. Yeah, so what is, Dzeranov, what is your best achievement, your best goal so far until now? What have you win on your left arm the best?
SPEAKER_00: It was Vitaly. What was the biggest achievement for you on the left hand? Can you fight against Vitaly or something else? Well, I have a 4-1 score with Ivan Matyshenko. So, with Vitaly 2-2. Then...
SPEAKER_00: Who else? I don't remember. Has he pulled with Morozov on the left arm ever? Morozov beat him in a supermatch. Morozov won the last armfight dry on the left. But at the national championship in Kazakhstan, I had a score with him. It was the last time, though. 2-1. It was in his favor.
SPEAKER_00: How long ago? When was the last Supermatch with Morozov? Five years ago. Five years ago? Yes, around five years ago. So from my point of view... I won him once in Kazakhstan at the National Championship. He won me twice. And after a few months, he dominated completely on the left hand.
SPEAKER_01: On the right it was 4-2, but on the left it was all 4-2. Yeah, we pulled on Kazakhstan national tournaments. I won first, and then he won against me twice. And then in a couple of months we pulled the super match, and he was much, much better, and he won dominantly. So on left arm it was 2-1 in tournaments. On right arm it was 4-1. 4-2. 4-2. On right arm against Morozov it was 4-2.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, 2019, you know, he won in Romania, right and left arm 242s.
SPEAKER_03: And yeah, Matyushenko gave him some match, but he wasn't able to. He said against Matyushenko, he has 4-1 records in tournaments. Anyway, so I want to quickly say that we are on the exactly same level because I pinned two times Vitaly and you win two times Vitaly. So we are very equal.
SPEAKER_01: And what is his shape now? Is it best ever or still not yet on the left arm? Well, it's hard to say. Of course, in terms of weight.
SPEAKER_00: I have both working weights and general weight. Naturally, I did not stand in one place. I always train two hands, despite the fact that I train them in parallel, almost with the same weights. The left hand is even stronger at some points than the right one.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe it's more, let's say, not technical, but more current. Ford example, on the right hand, if I was knocked up, I already give up. And on the left hand, I can hold here. Even it was many times with the same Vitalik, when he knocked me out. With the same Ermes Gasparini in the 17th or 16th year on the Golden Tour. He knocked me out in 95 categories. I overcame him, he lost to me in the end.
SPEAKER_00: Well, I think it's better, yes, it's better. Again, our shape is based on our injuries. When you don't feel any pain, it's already a very important psychological and physical aspect.
SPEAKER_01: You know, I would say it's probably the best shape. Yeah, in some areas, it's stronger than my right arm. It's definitely, even if it's, like, let's say not technical, it's much more defensive. Like, let's say on right arm, when I lose position, I just lose. But left arm, it's just much more defensive. Against Vitaly, it happened a lot of times. It's just...
SPEAKER_04: it's very hard to assess because he trains both arms and they're usually basically on the same level he would say generally it's on the same level nice yeah i mean you saw Morozov vs Vitaly match in Tbilisi what did you think what did you understand from that match
SPEAKER_03: oh i you know i was thinking that morozov can do that to vitaly but i am a little bit surprised that morozov stopped him with open arm so this little bit shocked me because i think side pressure of vitaly is super good but maybe not maybe more powerful on the right arm not on the left but
SPEAKER_03: I'm shocked basically because Vitaly used flow press and when he talked to me he said this is very bad technique and he will never use it and he used it.
SPEAKER_03: He had to. He didn't choose it, but he had to. Because his wrist was going. This made me a little bit fun when I was watching. I said, no way what I am watching. But, yeah, but, you know, probably if Morozov will not get injury, maybe he could take that. So for me, people were saying Vitaly will smash Morozov, but I knew it. It is very close match. I knew it.
SPEAKER_04: And by watching of this, I think I am close to both of these guys. Yes, no doubt. I am close to both of them. One day rematch please with Vitaly. Yes, all these matches will happen. We are all here and you all are superstars and you guys need to... Because I will tell you something, like...
SPEAKER_04: Armwrestling, I don't know how to say, the things, I mean, in any sport, things can change, but in armwrestling, also changing. In armwrestling,
SPEAKER_04: is not i don't know how to say like it did not reach its capacity and when it didn't reach its capacity we can say that the atlas didn't reach their uh capacity either because they didn't have the opportunity it was not attractive enough for them to push their limits maybe some atlas yes but not everyone so i i just see that everything is improving
SPEAKER_04: And, yeah, as Neil Pickup says, it is becoming like Jurassic Park, you know. And, yeah, we will see. We will see how it goes. And I have a question for Georgii. Georgii, how would you compare yourself with Alijan? How would you compare yourself with Alijan? To be honest, this question is not very correct, because...
SPEAKER_00: You know?
SPEAKER_00: In terms of physical endurance, I still have a little more because of my bigger weight, let's say. Exactly this, let's say. And then it will be much heavier.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I don't really like those questions because I don't really like to elevate myself by comparing myself to my friend, my brother, who is my partner for so long. Yes, just I know I pulled him so much. I know his weaknesses. I know the points where he pulls and I'm much bigger as well.
SPEAKER_01: and because of that i have good endurance compared to him as well but i just want to leave it a 50 50. i don't want to compare myself you know i understand i understand yeah yeah so here in this uh did it have any kind of any kind of questions in your head coming and no basically uh georgie just explained to people
SPEAKER_03: that he is better than Alijan and I should be even more scared. He didn't say that. But people say, oh, we are disappointed. Why Kamil don't pull Alijan? But I think Dzeranov is even more danger because he's huge and he could be similar strong than Alijan.
SPEAKER_04: Listen, listen, like, I think, in my opinion, I think you would find, but first of all, let me start from the beginning. You did not reject to pull Ali Can. Ali Can just had month of Ramadan, he had to fast.
SPEAKER_04: And he said that Engin, I can't get prepared well, you know, during the Ramadan. Some athletes can do, some athletes cannot do. And obviously, Gyorgy was able to do it. Ali Can prepared to just focus on fasting. And if I would offer you, Ali Can, I'm 100% sure you would accept. I don't think there is anyone that you would reject pulling.
SPEAKER_04: especially with left arm coming. I know my all conversations with you. We regularly chat. I don't think there is any human being. Maybe even with right arm, you would just say no. I think you would just say yes against anyone. And so you are one of those guys that, you know, not afraid of anyone. That's for sure. I'm not saying to your face. I would say to anyone everywhere. And the second of all, my opinion,
SPEAKER_04: I think you would find Ali Can more dangerous because of his explosiveness. And you also mentioned this. You said it was not about the style, but it was about the explosiveness. And I think that I just like Ali Can and Ivan are the most explosive guys around that category.
SPEAKER_04: And if you realize that, you know, when they pull against each other, they were like, boom, at the center, just stay like, you know, like at the center. It was incredible. It was incredible. And maybe horsepower and endurance, maybe.
SPEAKER_04: maybe Gheorghe ahead, but that explosiveness I think is more dangerous for you. I think you are not afraid of power. You are more, I can't say afraid, but you are more concerned about that explosiveness, especially if it is coming with the fast wrist cupping, you know, over your pronator. Do you agree or not? I don't know.
SPEAKER_03: yes yes i am agree you know because my my power is behind my shoulder and whoever kicked me out of this is like 20 less so basically you're right you know but i am keep learning that uh that power outside so maybe one day i'll be able to fight like
SPEAKER_03: purified with just this maybe. What do you mean? Like that, yeah. Pure hook, pure hook, yeah. Ah, okay. Why would you do that? Now I have inside power with the shoulder. Whatever is here, I've got the power.
SPEAKER_04: But outside is only biceps left. So that's what I am working on it. So you just don't want to be vulnerable. If somebody puts you here, you want to still be effective. Yeah, I want to be like Morozov with me. Get it on the hook and don't give up. Yeah, yeah. Okay, so let's talk about some of other matches that I have announced. Georgii, what do you think about...
SPEAKER_00: Daniel Prokopchuk vs. Artur Makarov. Lightweight world title match with right arm. What do you think about their match, Makarov vs. Prokopchuk, for the title? Will it be a right arm fight? Yes, it will be a right arm fight. To be honest, it's very difficult. I think it will be an even fight. And in terms of endurance, I think they are about the same.
SPEAKER_00: Artur Makarov, I don't remember exactly, but I think he fights well against top fighters. It's hard to say. I put a little overweight on Artur Makarov.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know if I'm rooting for one of them, but I wouldn't say I'm rooting for one or the other. Both of them are impressive to me. But I think Prokopchuk will fight for the top. Artur will catch him and it's hard to hide his big hand.
SPEAKER_01: You know, it's very close, very interesting fight. I like it because it's very close in power. And I think they're close in endurance as well. I'm pretty sure Makarov does pretty well against top rollers. And I think Prokopch is going to pull outside, actually. I don't think he's going to hook him. But I would say I'm leaning a little bit for Makarov.
SPEAKER_01: But I wouldn't say it's a big difference. And I cheer for both of them because they're both my good friends. I respect both of them. I would say it's just Makarov's wrist and hand is just so big. It's so hard to pull outside against him. And Kamil?
SPEAKER_03: yeah i'll be quick on this one because i don't have much to say i think similar it's very close match both guys are on top and i think because of slightly bigger hand of makarov he could maybe take this one slightly very slightly yeah you guys are saying like 51 49 or something you know because that's that's how you're making the matches
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, yeah. Listen, listen. I have no idea. I'm just making matches as hard as for myself. So when it is hard for myself, it is usually hard for other people as well. Like today I'm reading, you know, some people says, oh, Kamen is going to kill Georgii. And some people says, oh, Georgii is going to kill Kamen because it's just stylistically, you know, bad match for Kamen. So both perspective, we cannot say wrong. But only thing that we need to do, we just need to
SPEAKER_04: wait and see you know and i'm in the same same position um anyway so uh let's go to another one um
SPEAKER_04: Gennady Kvikvinya vs. Ibrahim Sago, 115 kg, heavyweight, Interim World Title. Interim World Title because Rino Matic has been injured and he can't pull for some time. I talked with him, I said, Rino, and he said, he agrees with me, he can't really
SPEAKER_04: pull at this level, you know, if he pulls right now, he needs to defend his title. If you are defending your title, you need to pull this level of match, you know, and I don't think it's a good idea. He doesn't think it's a good idea. And I said, you are still the champion, but we would like to do interim world title. And he understand that. And so, and then like the truth is, um,
SPEAKER_04: Gennady Kvykvinia wanted to pull Devon in, originally in 115 kilos. And he kind of wanted it to be a world title. We said, no, Rino Masic is the champion. At that time, we didn't still, like, we were not sure how Rino's elbow was going to be. But it turned out to be, like, he needs more time. So...
SPEAKER_04: You know, Ibrahim Sagov and Reno was very close, 4-3, very close match, very close. And Gennady Kvikvinian said that he would pull 115 kilos only, only if it's a world title match. And he got it. And people think that Gennady can't make 115. Gennady for many years, he pulled 110 kilos at WAP and Europeans, for many years.
SPEAKER_04: Gennady said that he was usually losing a lot of weight, like Devon does. And then he gains the weight back, you know. So now basically they are going to pull. I don't know where is right now Gennady's weight. And whenever I announced the match, it was one month before the event.
SPEAKER_04: And not even one month probably, but like 31 days or whatever. And people says, Oh, how is he going to lose the weight in 30 days? I mean,
SPEAKER_04: I mean, I announced the match in 30 days before the event. I didn't set 30 days. I had to wait until the East vs. West 17. The match was set more than two months before the May event. So how does this I don't know see this match? Now at 115, they made Sagov and Gennady. Gennady will cut weight. How do you think it will go for the title?
SPEAKER_00: very interesting, in fact, this is a match with pleasure, I will not look at it, especially in the eye of the living, but it seems to me like Ibrahim Sagov, he has now gained weight, respectively, he is not just him, he has gained a good shape, he is now in good shape, Gennady throws off a little weight and plus I don't know, it seems to me that he is
SPEAKER_00: Now he is not in the same shape as he was before the injury. These are my assumptions. Of course, I am cheering and I think that Ibrahim will win. But I am worried about his straightforwardness in terms of the fight. And his endurance is not very good.
SPEAKER_00: And Gennady, he has a very serious character, which, how can I say, Gennady can win, but his character, as they say, you can't do anything about it. He can turn on, as we know, up to 120 percent. Well, conditionally. And he is versatile, cunning.
SPEAKER_01: And these are my conclusions. I think Ibrahimov may have problems. You know, I'm very happy. It's a great match and I'm happy that I'm going to see it in person as well. Isagov is getting bigger, he's getting stronger and he looks way better. Gennady on the opposite, he's dropping weight now. Obviously, I will cheer for and I think Isagov should win. But the thing that worries me...
SPEAKER_01: First of all, endurance. Gennady is very good. Gennady has probably the most soul out of everyone you can tell. You can rip away a win from him, but you will not rip his soul out. He's going to be fighting till the end. He can go 120% any moment. But still, I'm rooting for Zagov. But he should be careful with the endurance. It's going to be a very big part of the match as well. And Kamil?
SPEAKER_03: yeah that's funny because i am thinking exactly same again sagov have so good side pressure like supinated press and and devon beat it like that gennady and i think this could be weakness of gennady but if gennady is so clever and he will not let sagov to get to his side of the table then possibly gennady can take it somehow that's what i'm thinking
SPEAKER_04: okay so very close one another one yeah he basically said something like canary so tricky as well yeah yeah yeah very very mapozian says thanks to the serrano for being active in internet and communicating with the fans and did we miss any other super chats or anyway so
SPEAKER_04: It's hard to say.
SPEAKER_00: I've seen how Sanugo fights, he raises some unreal weights for his category, for his anthropometry, although he doesn't look so textured, well, let's say, he doesn't have a bodybuilder's position, but he raises such weights, very serious, on which I, for example, don't even swing in some exercises.
SPEAKER_00: Perhaps not the best technique, but nevertheless, for his own weight, it's very ... Well, he has anthropometry, compared to Mask, well, of course, he is inferior. In hooks, he is clearly much stronger, but will he be able to, how to say, implement his technique, the question. Again, Mask, he is so ...
SPEAKER_00: I can't say if he was in his best form after the surgery or after the injury. What is not in the best form is 100%, but it is not known to what extent he was in his best form. I did not stand at the table with him, neither before, nor after, nor in time. And either he really prepared and gained weight, so I have no idea at all.
SPEAKER_00: So, I will say that anthropometry will take its place. Well, this is just my opinion, it is not fixed in any way, just like that. Just like that. It is possible.
SPEAKER_01: No, Nugo is just so powerful, it doesn't make any sense, he isn't even that big, he's not that huge, and he lifts some crazy weights, maybe not the perfect technique, but some of the weights he lifts, I myself, I don't try it, but...
SPEAKER_01: with matt mask i would say he is much larger frame wise and that could make some problems for nugo he's for sure way stronger in hook but the question is can he get there and can he realize that option uh but still in the end i have no idea really i have no idea but i'll just go with the fact that matt is just so uncomfortable for him he's so big
SPEAKER_03: i would go with that matt will be better because of his higher advantage incoming again exactly same thing exactly i i think matt mask is too large by bones
SPEAKER_03: And his hand is huge. And I think this will be very difficult for Nugo to do anything to his hand. If Nugo have a floor press, then maybe he can win it. Floor press? Yeah. If he will use the ring, he cannot top roll him or something. No? You know, Nugo is much smaller, you know? He's much smaller.
SPEAKER_03: And I just don't believe Matt Mask will let him to do anything. I think every round it will be like nothing, nothing. So you are saying that Matt is going to dominate? I am so sorry for Nugo. He is amazing guy and I would love to have a good fight, but I just don't see it. I don't know. Yeah, I don't know. Like people from Georgii around it, people are thinking that like Nugo is going to just
SPEAKER_04: dominate him and people from West is thinking that way, opposite way. And I really don't know after what I saw in Arlington, I really don't know what to think. We also don't know what shape it was Organbaev. I don't know, but I mean, it can't be that bad, you know, I don't think he would come there with everything. I don't know. Yeah. Okay. So today,
SPEAKER_04: We just announced another match. Rustam Babaev versus Pata Cinks. This time I'm going to ask Kamil because Kamil is always copying this. I don't know. I'm joking, joking. Okay, yeah, that's fine. So I think the good times come to the end for Tottenham. I believe that Babaev will hook him again, I believe.
SPEAKER_03: And will it be enough? And I think it could be enough. Maybe not fast, but good fight. And I think Rustam will not give it the hook battle. I think he will get it. Slowly, that's what I think, you know.
SPEAKER_03: You know, Irakli lost the rising, the wrist, and Irakli couldn't use his power. But I think wrist of the Rustam Babaev is so strong, and I think he will get it inside, and I think he will not let to use... I think that side pressure from Todd will be not enough to beat hook...
SPEAKER_04: of Rustam Bavaev. That's what I think. So you are saying that TASS side pressure will be neutralized because of Rustam will control his pronator? Yes, that's what I think. And then if they go inside, are you sure that Rustam is going to win inside?
SPEAKER_03: It will be not flash pins, but I think he will not give it. And I think he will get it slowly because, you know, I think Rustam is like 20 years younger or 18. And I think his stamina will be slightly better than Tozilla. Yeah, Rustam is 41 probably. Yeah, I think 41.
SPEAKER_03: No, no, no. 82, 43. Rustam is 43. But, you know, Rustam is now, I think, very good shape. He's already training. He's coming back, yeah. A year and a half already, I think he could be top shape already. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And what do you think, Georgii? What do you think about Rustam Pabaev? He asked Kamil first, because every time you answered, Kamil said, I agree, I agree, I think exactly the same thing, three times in a row. In fact, partially, I also agree.
SPEAKER_00: with Kamil, but not completely. Here's why I have doubts about Rustam Babaev. Naturally, he is younger, he has good speed, we know, and the widest fingers, despite his anthropometry, and the hook holds everything. But he has had chest injuries recently, as far as I know, several times. And if he
SPEAKER_00: has not restored his optimal form, then he will not forgive it just like that, he will take advantage of it. Moreover, as practice shows, it is not very strictly judged on events, somewhere the elbows pop up, they let the athletes fight. It will play, it seems to me, on the hand, in the literal and figurative sense, on the hand of Todd.
SPEAKER_00: Therefore, for some reason, I think that he will win with a little overweight. Why, I don't know. But again, if Rustam will bring his own form, at least 95%, at least 90%, then it's unlikely, unlikely.
SPEAKER_00: Well, after all, I bet 51 to 49 on Todd. Ford some reason, that's what it tells me inside. Although I follow both of them, they both impress, but I just give Todd due to his age. Respect and tribute, let's say.
SPEAKER_01: You know, I agree with Camille now, but not completely. He joked about, like, every time Camille agrees, now I agree with him. Sure, he's younger, he's faster, his fingers are very good, he lacked the hook. It's all very good. But all the time I think about his injuries, he got the pack injuries...
SPEAKER_01: quite often now and if if it's there again Todd will not let it go so easily the level is very high and Todd will use that and on the events as well sometimes the the elbow can jump or referees are not super strict and that could play even better for Todd
SPEAKER_01: And I would say it's 51-49 for Todd. I would go there just for his age, you know, just because I respect Todd a lot. I would give 51-49 to him. Okay, let's go to Vitaly Laletin versus Michael Todd match.
SPEAKER_03: okay that's so amazing match i'm so excited about this one and i don't know how uh both guys are honest about the the match how they will go but if they really honest i think vitaly making big mistake
SPEAKER_03: to saying that he come to flash pin him because Michael is really difficult opponent and I've got same thinking like Vitaly that I will go and I will flash pin him but this didn't happen and now I understand more to beat Michael Todd you need to
SPEAKER_03: do different ways and and the funny thing is even michael on his maybe youtube channel tell to people how to beat him so so this was a little bit shocking but uh to beat michael you need to go over his hand and you need to pin his hand not his arm so if italy is planning to just go straight through his uh hand i don't believe this will happen and uh i think
SPEAKER_03: I think Vitaly don't have enough strong press to just get it sideways to win Michael. And if Vitaly... What if he takes Michael's hand? Yeah, that's what I want to say. If Vitaly will be not enough clever, he will not win Michael Todd. But I think he can win, but he have to really do homework really good how to beat Michael Todd and he have to do that plan.
SPEAKER_03: do you think that he there is a chance him to beat michael outside of strap or no uh i don't think this will this can happen i think mike michael will run away uh i think he can run away okay what's the percentage of chances to be to be fair i think
SPEAKER_03: more have michael taught from my point of view i will say michael is favorite i think a bit yes because what is it 55 45 55 45 yeah you know people maybe he can like michael or don't like but he's a fighter and his technique is very dangerous if you really not enough strong in one of these points you will not win at him and and you george
SPEAKER_01: What do you think? In short, what did he say in a nutshell? Look, he says that if what Vitaly says is true, that he comes there and he wants to put him in the pool right away, from one movement, from a break, then it seems to me that he will lose, because it is actually impossible to put Michael like that. Vitaly can win.
SPEAKER_01: But he has to prepare and pass it through his hand, go out on his fingers and put it down. He even said that you don't put your hand down, but you have to drag it down with your fingers. Because you can't open his hand completely. And Vitaly's press may not be that strong. He can win, but if what he says is true, then he will have very big problems.
SPEAKER_00: Kamil, this time Georgii is trying to copy from you. Just joking. I still think Vitaly will be able to win the flash-picks quickly. Why? He has a big start, a strong start, a big hand.
SPEAKER_00: But, in fact, I'm rooting for him, despite the fact that he beat me. I want to beat Vitaly hard. And reach him. Let him score. It's okay. Let Vitaly's fans throw tomatoes at me. It's okay too. There are more of them than mine. I'm not that popular yet. But he really needs to do all this very quickly. I don't know. But I think he can.
SPEAKER_00: In the first rounds, if he has enough energy... How many rounds will there be? Ford? Ford rounds? He needs to win three times. Yes, he needs to win three times. He needs to win three times? If it's three, then Vitaly has more chances. If it's four, I would doubt it, because he can get out of it. He can hang like that for ten minutes, let's say.
SPEAKER_00: And Vitalik has gained weight now, he does not have the same endurance as before, with a weight of 100, 110, 120 kilograms. So, if he does everything quickly, but if in the third round he is hooked, then it will be, of course, but I still think a little bit, 55 by 45, about
SPEAKER_01: I would say 55-45 for Vitaly. And even though he won against me, I'll still root for him. I want to pull a very strong Vitaly and I want to win against a very strong Vitaly. So he should get bigger and bigger. Ford their match, I would say it is possible for him to flash pin him, but he should be very,
SPEAKER_01: very very fast and very careful about it because it's if michael bites him even in third round and starts to stop him and get a hold of him he will not be able to keep up he was his endurance was very good when he was 110 20 kilograms he's not that that like that anymore he's 150 he's much bigger you're talking about who
SPEAKER_00: Vitaly. He's much bigger now. His endurance is not as good. Does it apply for everyone or only for Vitaly? Does it apply for everyone or only for Vitaly? Does it apply for everyone or only for Vitaly? Does it apply for everyone or only for Vitaly? Does it apply for everyone or only for Vitaly? Does it apply for everyone or only for Vitaly? Does it apply for everyone or only for Vitaly? Does it apply for everyone or only for Vitaly? Does it apply for everyone or only for Vitaly? Does it apply for everyone or only for Vitaly? Does it apply for everyone or only for Vitaly? Does it apply for everyone or only for Vitaly? Does it apply for everyone or only for Vitaly? Does it apply for everyone or only for Vitaly? Does it apply for everyone or only for Vitaly? Does it apply for everyone or only for Vitaly? Does it apply for everyone or only for Vitaly? Does it apply for everyone or only for Vitaly? Does it apply for everyone or only for Vitaly
SPEAKER_00: If I hooked, then... Relatively, at least for my opponents, I had a better endurance. In absolute terms, I don't know, but it seems... Well, again, let's say in the case of Todd, he has more weight, he has more endurance. In the case, let's say, even take the same Georgii Tsvetkov,
SPEAKER_00: He always has good endurance, despite the fact that he weighs 160 or something kilograms. But if it's too much, yes, Levan, perhaps, when he was 190, he had worse endurance than when he was 175. But this is my subjective opinion. That is, there is no such linear dependence. It depends on the person. Some are like that, and some are different.
SPEAKER_01: You know, I would say it's completely depends on the person. It's not linear. Like, let's say I got bigger myself and I feel like I have better endurance now, actually. And the hooks that I pull, I feel like I'm actually better. Tsvetkov, he weighs 160, even more, and he always had great endurance.
SPEAKER_01: for michael as well i would say michael when he gets bigger he gets even better with endurance but on the opposite let's say we have levon who was 190 his endurance was probably worse than he was when he is 175 so it really just depends on the person
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but 175 is still not light, you know. Anyway, so what was the rest of the things he said before I cut? Yeah, he said he goes 55-45 for Vitaly. It's a very good match and he just should be very, very careful because if he gets bit, if it was four rounds, it would be much worse for Vitaly. But three is actually more manageable and even if he gets stopped in round three, it's still very dangerous for him.
SPEAKER_01: Did he mention anything without the strap, if he could beat him? No, he didn't mention it. Okay, can you ask? Yeah. I don't think so, because Todd is very good at slipping away. He can get away from him.
SPEAKER_01: I think so, because when I pulled him, I'm not very good at slipping. And I could still slip for him. So if I did it, Michael is going to do it anyways. Yeah, yeah. Okay, I understand. And...
SPEAKER_04: what does come in what do you think about upcoming Ermes versus Levan in June so far I don't know really what to say but
SPEAKER_03: levan don't show much on social or maybe i don't see how strong he is or how much he is training the the weights what he is doing like 120 kilos for some reps it's not impressive as the 165 what he was doing in the past so but it's still a lot of time so probably
SPEAKER_03: levan will get to the 100 shape and i believe hermes also will get to 100 of his shape and i believe it will be very close match i i don't believe that uh levan will smash hermes three times or four times i just don't believe especially both guys have experience already with them and you know if i will be back to some guy which i even lost i will know exactly how to pull better
SPEAKER_03: And I'm pretty sure, um, Ermes do the homework and he is preparing the weak points. What, uh, what he lost and, uh, seems to be like Ermes is, is, is growing pretty fast. I see. So I will say 50, 50, I really 50, 50, very, very difficult, uh, for both guys, because one is very hungry, very hungry.
SPEAKER_03: And another one really have to get the win because, you know, that's superstar guy. So both guys fighting for the crowd, you know. And Georgii? What do you think about Ermes and Levan fighting now? Do you want me to translate what Kamil said? Not necessarily. So, Ermes and Levan. I think that...
SPEAKER_00: all the same for Levan it will be a fundamental fight because Ermes is the only one who was able to stop him, roughly speaking, there were a lot of questions in this victory, many even said that Levan lost there because he gave up and so on, so there were a lot of jokes for this oxygen mask and so on, I think that Levan
SPEAKER_00: Now he will be preparing just as... It will be more fundamental for him. Even worse than he will be preparing against Lolletin, against Devon. This is my opinion. Because, roughly speaking, only Ermes stressed him so much. And he won't want to let the same thing happen again. It will be very difficult. Of course...
SPEAKER_00: Levan, roughly speaking, well, in a good sense, is tired of his victories, he is already just destroying everyone with his such, straight, really stupid, let's say, power. But it seems to me that the intrigue will still be there, but it will be small. Yes, there, perhaps, they cling a little, but they will win. As usual.
SPEAKER_00: Yes, as usual, Levan. Deep in my heart, maybe I want him to win the RMS too. So that there is some kind of intrigue, so that the throne will shake. But Levan himself is also... He has a different opinion and I think he has a very different opinion.
SPEAKER_01: You know, I would say for Levan, it's very important. Probably the most important match for him is Ermes. The most principal fight for him. And he... Like, Ermes was the only one who could stop him and who did that. And, you know, so many people started talking about that match. Like, oh, some people were even saying that Levan lost just because he gave up. And so many jokes about the oxygen and everything. It's just...
SPEAKER_01: it probably drives levan so crazy he probably trains so hard for that match way harder than he would train for vitaly uh and for anyone else just that the principle of the only one that stopped him he for sure he trained so hard for him and i think
SPEAKER_01: Most probably he's going to win again. Maybe they'll get just a bit of stop, but it's most probably he's going to win again. Maybe for myself, I want Ermes to win. Like, you know, Levan winning all the time. He joked about it. Like, everyone's just tired of it. Just Levan winning against anyone, the horsepower just smashing them. Maybe I want the throne to shake up a little bit, but Levan is probably a different opinion on that one. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_04: Okay, yeah, I understand. I think if I'm not mistaken, Kamil, you are the only one so far that said 50-50. The rest of the people, I don't know if there's anyone else said that, but I think the rest of the people said, you know, Levan is favorite and you are saying 50-50. Allen I know is that
SPEAKER_04: Ermes is very, very strong. And Ermes really knows arm wrestling. When I said Ermes really knows arm wrestling, I don't mean only at the table, but he knows how to prepare. Like, he knows what to do. You know, he is knowledgeable enough. Will it be enough? I don't know. But I know that he will be as ready as possible for that match. I don't know if it will be enough or not, but time will show, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: And one last question before I finish this podcast. I want to ask, but please tell them, tell Georgii to give answer a bit shorter. What does he think about Devon versus Vitaly? And does he think that Devon has more chances than Michael has?
SPEAKER_01: because of stylistically, you know, or different hitting, you know. One of the last questions, so we'll just go through it quickly. Well, such a short answer. If Devon fights with Vitaly, do you think he has more chances than Vitaly, just stylistically? No, I think Vitaly is stylistically very uncomfortable for Devon, plus he is as cunning on the grab as Devon himself.
SPEAKER_01: You know, I don't think so. I think Lallatin is actually a stylistic problem for Devon. He's very tricky in the setup as well. Long fingers, long arm. I don't think so. I don't think that Devon is more problems for him. So he thinks that Lallatin has more power against Devon? In short, Vitaly has more power and chances against Devon. Yes. Yes. And how do you see Kamil?
SPEAKER_03: Okay, so hello Devon. Now it's my turn on social media to talk. So I think Devon says that all three Americans will beat Vitaly. Michael, Devon and Jerry. And I think only one which will not beat Vitaly is Devon. I think Jerry can get Vitaly and I think Michael can get Vitaly. But I think Devon may be
SPEAKER_03: struggle with vitally why is that why because vitally when he will fight devon on the table he will switch the devil switch and i think he will be so fired up to just flash pin devon and devon don't have that stop what have michael
SPEAKER_04: Okay, okay, now I understand. Okay. Anyways, thank you very, very much, guys. Thank you very much. Thank you, Kamil Jablonski. Thank you, Alex, for your translation. And I see you guys in less than four weeks in Istanbul. Thank you, guys. Thank you. Bye-bye.
