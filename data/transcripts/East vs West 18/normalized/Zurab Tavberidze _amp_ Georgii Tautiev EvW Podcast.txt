SPEAKER_04: Hello. Hello, everyone. Today, we are going to have two guests that have met before in WAF events, Zurab Tawberize and Gyorgy Tautiev.
SPEAKER_04: Let me share the link on social media. And then let's start. Soon the guests will come. And then Roman Gamtenadze will be translating. OK.
Speaker: you
SPEAKER_04: Yes, now they are about to come. Okay. Okay, let's see who came here. Roman is here. Georgii Tautiev is here with his camera.
SPEAKER_04: Can you hear me, Engin? I hear you, yes. Can you talk again? Yeah, you just told me you can hear me, right? Yes, yes, but I wasn't sure if it was the volume on. I heard you a little bit quiet, but yes. So how is everything, Roman?
SPEAKER_00: uh be getting busier as the event is approaching but feeling feeling very excited and as usual nice edits are coming sorry nice it is nice edits are coming yes yes yes yes um i think i think we will be we will be pushing even uh top notch higher like maybe even uh every day
SPEAKER_04: At least every other day there will be new promos. There should be every day because we are only 18 days away from the competition. And we have 12 matches. And yeah, maybe not every day, but yeah. Yeah, somewhere between every or every other day. Yeah. Okay. But exciting, exciting. Yes, yes. It is like probably one of the best events.
SPEAKER_02: Hello. Hello. Hello. How are you? I'm good. You? Good. Good. Roman. Hello, Georgii. Hello. How are you? I'm sorry, Roman.
SPEAKER_00: Zurof had asked me how how is it going and it's been a while since we saw each other and he says that he's still alive don't worry guys because he's been inactive so long he's showing that he is in shape
SPEAKER_00: Is it possible that while we're with Zurab, can he be quiet? Because right now we are all the time hearing him. Zurab, we haven't had a conversation with you for a year. We haven't had a conversation with you for a year. We haven't had a conversation with you for a year. We haven't had a conversation with you for a year. We haven't had a conversation with you for a year. We haven't had a conversation with you for a year.
SPEAKER_04: It's his brother. He already apologized. No problem, no problem. Just because we don't understand. Georgii, how are you? Good? Yes, yes, I'm fine. Hello, brother. Hello, hello, dear. Hello.
SPEAKER_04: Georgii, did you see Zurab's arm? Yes. Is this problem for you? Very big, very big. Is this a problem? I don't think so. You care about his hand only, right? Hand. Yes. You will take his hand? I try. You will try, okay.
SPEAKER_04: Zorab, Georgii is not impressed with your... I mean, he is impressed, but he doesn't think that your arm size is going to be a problem. He said he cares about your hand. Do you think he cares about your hand? Georgii... Georgii thinks that... my hand, whether I touch it or not, doesn't fit in the center of the hand. It's a static form of the hand.
SPEAKER_00: Roman, do you plan to translate for the people who are watching?
SPEAKER_00: Oh, I just translate, because Zurov told me, sorry, sorry. You probably forgot because we haven't been doing so often anymore. Yeah, tell us. Yeah, so Zurov told me to tell Georgii that no matter if Georgii manages to take his wrist or not, the arm will stay in center, will never budge even. And what does Georgii say? Georgii said, understood, we will see, he said. He didn't say much. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: I don't understand, where is Gyorgy? Gyorgy is also in the car? Yes. Yeah, okay, okay. There was a light coming. I wasn't sure if it was in a surgery room or something, but yeah, it's a car, okay. I am in car, yeah. Okay, okay, yeah. Yeah. So, Gyorgy, what's your weight right now? 103. 100? Yes.
SPEAKER_02: Me too. Me too. 103? Yes. And I have a question for you guys. How many times have you guys met? Do you remember?
SPEAKER_02: We fought on the right hand only once. Only once, at the World Championship semi-final? Yes, in 2019. And the semi-final? The semi-final, there was a semi-final. Well, we fought, then they gave you a foul, then a Swedish grab and another foul. Well, in short, there was no fight. Once we fought, here's the center of the hand like this.
SPEAKER_02: We need some translation. Three times, Engin, three times. Okay, who won?
SPEAKER_04: Left I win, right I win, and Georgii wins 1-1. Okay, right arm 1-1, left arm 1-0. No, no. Right arm 1-0. Right arm 1-0? Yes. Okay, left arm 1-1? Yes. Ah, okay. Okay. So, since this is also left arm match, so you guys are 1-1?
SPEAKER_04: It's going to tiebreaker this time because of the left arm. Because it is left arm match in Istanbul. No, no, I'm joking, joking.
SPEAKER_00: you were not against it right you could also pull it okay no problem if it is left arm match is it better for you
SPEAKER_02: The thing is, I think New Yorkers are more likely to win, and I think I will be more likely to win, and Marjorie will be more likely to win in this situation.
SPEAKER_00: He said that as far as I know, Georgii's lefty is not as good as his right, so it would give me more advantage. So it would be easier for me if it was left hand, because on right arm, it's much more competitive and it will be a battle. Baba, how come he's 1-1 with left arm?
SPEAKER_02: How do you feel about that? Because I won one in March and won two in Antalya and won two in Lidakhi Sacevaz and Folimom. I'm proud of that.
SPEAKER_00: He said that first win he won normal, like everything was in order. But second time in Antaly, they fought again on lefty and he pinned Georgii but by fouling, like he fouled himself. So he lost on fouls, it was his fault.
SPEAKER_01: So he ended up pinning Georgii, but actually he lost the match because it wasn't for us. Zura, do you remember? I won against you once in the semi-finals. And I fought with Hadji in the final. I don't remember. I won against you in the semi-finals as well. In the Europa-Z. In the Europa-Z?
SPEAKER_00: Now Georgii just reminded Zurab that I also remember actually I beat you at Europeans also on fouls, on radar. I don't remember, but it was probably like that. Yes, yes, it was. Zurab says, I don't know, my memories are... Maybe. Because we already met a little. In short, the score is 2-2. 2-2, yes, it means 2-2.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, they met in the common ground and Zurov says, and probably my memory is blurry because we met so many times already each other. Let's leave it like two-two between us and let's decide who is the better. And Georgii, what times you won with the fouls? One time I won with fouls, the other time he won with fouls.
SPEAKER_00: So there was two wins on fouls, but for each of them. So one time Georgii won by fouls and one time Zurab. Zurab also won by foul. Okay. Yeah. So actually each of them has two wins against each other. And both of them have... One, one, one, one. And then one wins by fouls. Okay. Yeah. And each of them has one wins by fouls. Roman.
SPEAKER_02: Roman, the thing is that after my injury, after the injury, I had a second heart attack, and I had a big problem with that. I realized that I was going to die, and I thought that I wouldn't be able to do it in my normal form, but here I am, in my normal form, and I'm going to die in my normal form, and I'm going to die in my normal form.
SPEAKER_00: So, Engin, first of all, Zurab wants to thank you for giving the opportunity two times prior to this one, after his
SPEAKER_00: uh injury actually this is the second time right so he said thank you again for giving me opportunity i know that you may also uh knew back then my previous match that i was not fully recovered or maybe you thought so but regardless you gave me the chance because i wanted to compete and i tried to do my best and now uh
SPEAKER_00: Let me clear this up. I know for sure that I'm at least as good as I have ever been. Maybe even in my best shape, we will see. But definitely no worse than any time I was. Yeah, that's good to hear. Yeah. Also, thank you. Thank you, Zorab. And so basically he's saying that Georgii is in trouble. Yes. Georgii understood. He knows. He's saying that he may be better than ever.
SPEAKER_00: What can I do? I'm in good shape too. What can I do? I'm also not in that shape. We'll see. We'll see. Okay. Georgii, tell me honestly, what is your chance, according to your opinion? Georgii, what do you think about your chances against Zurab? Objectively. Objectively? Well...
SPEAKER_01: If everything goes well with God's help, I have a trauma. If she doesn't get sick, I think there are big chances. How big? Somewhere around 70%?
SPEAKER_00: So he said, if everything goes according to the plan of my preparation and for the God's will, if I have no injuries and everything goes according to my plans that I want it to go, I have a big, big percentage over me. Then I asked exactly how much percent? He said, around 70% I will give myself. 70%. Do you agree with this? It's a favorite.
SPEAKER_02: Zura, 70% of the time it's you, right? Objectively. Well, he thinks like that. Of course, he thinks like that when he wants to play. Well, I think the other way around. 70% of the time it's me. Well, in general, I would like to play with trauma.
SPEAKER_02: I was absolutely traumatized by everything. I was a professional athlete for a long time, for a minimum of 10 years, I was traumatized by everything and this is the advantage of the sport. Now, in what form would you be able to do it? I would like to do it in a short form, because I think it is very interesting to do it in a short form.
SPEAKER_00: So, well, at first, Zurok kind of did us everybody a favor and he talked Russian so that Georgii also would understand. He said that, I think it's vice versa. He may think that it's 70% favorite, that he's 70% favorite. I think I am 70% favorite considering how good shape I am. But then he continued in Georgii language. He said like,
SPEAKER_00: It will all come down to who is most prepared. We both feel that we are ready, obviously. He appreciates how Gyorgy is approaching this match. And in his opinion, Abel will show. Yeah, yeah. This is at the end, you know, what's going to happen. Gyorgy, I have a question for you. Like, it is very, very, very hard to hook you. Very hard to hook you. But whenever you lose...
SPEAKER_04: Even though you have very high leverage, you are losing against the pop rollers. Arsen you working on this? Arsen you working on this? Because people try to hook you, no problem. But whenever it goes outside, sometimes you lose your wrist and you have very long leverage. How come that you still have this problem?
SPEAKER_00: We all know that you have a long arm, right? This is a great advantage for you He said that when you have a top-roll match
SPEAKER_00: When the hand opens, you don't have a chance to stay somewhere, to stop the match and use you to twist. But when people try to twist you, you have no problem.
SPEAKER_00: And he said, how do you think you will deal with your chances against top-rollers? Because he said that when you have a top-roller, an opponent top-roller in your hand, you don't have as many chances as...
SPEAKER_01: against hookers. What do you think? First of all, I work on this. My side pressure is bad. It's hard for me to work with it. I have a weak spot. And the thing is not that the top roller opens my wrist, but the thing is that my side pressure goes away. Maybe the wrist stays, but the side pressure goes away.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, and that's why, let's say, I fought with Zirakashvili, when I pulled up without ties, I have no problems with anyone, not with the top guys, not with the hook. Without ties, no one, so to speak, won me. I don't remember that someone won me without ties. And when they tie already, they make a break and tie, then everything chokes me.
SPEAKER_00: well and he of course he acknowledges his problems you pointed out perfectly he said he's working on that and also he kind of explained why it's happening what's the reason and how he wants to battle that reason he said um
SPEAKER_00: when it comes down to arm wrestling without straps he feels comfortable pretty much against anyone but when it comes down to the straps once they slip problem becomes not his ability to top roll upon it but his side pressure thing like he said that i'm in general i'm not good inside pressure and he knows that rob is really good and he said he acknowledges that this is a big threat
SPEAKER_00: from Zurab towards him when it comes to the side pressure. So he needs to be prepared for that one. He said, once we are tied in the straps, my entire arm has to battle not only just to top roll and take opponent's wrist, but also put this battle from my positive side of the center with the side pressure, which is Georgii's weakness at this point, according to him. That's why
SPEAKER_00: Also, as an example, he brought Zira Khashoggi's example. That's why he'll end up losing against Irakli because sheer strength of Irakli taking Georgii's hand sideways like this in the negative way so that he would be in his losing side was greater than Georgii's option of top-rolling Irakli. So it ended up, regardless of whether he took his wrist or not, by side pressure, he was already almost done.
SPEAKER_00: that's why he's end up uh not that much effective but he said that in this case i know drop strength is side pressure so i need to work on that one yeah is going with the supinator side pressure supination side pressure when you pull
SPEAKER_04: Plamen Dimitrov, he went totally out. When he pulled Viorel Dobryin, he went out, and then Irakli out. But with Zurab, Zurab is going to go to your arm, you know. Not to hand, but to arm, you know, I think. He says that Zurab will be a fighter against you. He says that Zurab will be like that, but you still know it, I think. I still know it.
SPEAKER_00: I told him what you just said, Engin, that you were saying that Zurab will go this way. And I also said that most likely Georgii already also know it. And he laughed it. Of course, I know we don't know very well. Whenever I talk about the top row, and then whenever he said Zurab will do the same, but Zurab is going to his arm, you know.
SPEAKER_02: Zolev Azimurad was always trying to do, but he was losing his wrist. And Zorab, do you think you can hook this guy? You can hook him? I don't think so. I don't think so.
SPEAKER_02: As Georgii said, the side pressure is due to the fact that the weight of the ball is not the same as the weight of the ball itself. The weight of the ball is probably the same as the weight of the ball itself. In this case, the side pressure is very important.
SPEAKER_02: That's why I don't think I would have been able to win. But my goal is side pressure, whether I win or not, it means that my goal is to win.
SPEAKER_00: Well, he said he in general thinks and believes that he will be able to hook Georgii and based on his experience of their pulling in their history, rich history, he has never felt any danger of losing Zurab's wrist, like losing his own wrist or any type of danger that he may not be able to
SPEAKER_00: get into this hook position as he would like to be against any opponent. So, considering that experience and also what Georgii also said about himself when he said about the side pressure problem, Zurov said, I know Georgii is tall, he's
SPEAKER_00: a huge frame, but he doesn't have significant weight that would carry him sideways more strongly. He said because of how light Georgii is, considering how tall he is by frame, this lack of the mass
SPEAKER_00: is paying the dividend of having lack of the side pressure in Zurab's mind and that is Zurab's point he doesn't care if he ends up losing his wrist or not if he's gonna be in his favorite position or not Zurab knows he has to push sideways to win this is his game plan at least primary what he said
SPEAKER_00: Should I also translate this to Georgii? Maybe he has something to say against it. Did you understand the translation, Georgii? Georgii, I will translate myself a little bit. As Zurab said, Engin asked, Zurab, do you have a problem to twist Georgii or not?
SPEAKER_00: he will feel comfortable against you because he knows you well and you know him well too. He said that
SPEAKER_00: I want to ask you, Georgii, when you guys pull with Zurab, it was 80kg or 85kg? 18kg and 85kg.
SPEAKER_04: 18 and 85 kilos. But now, like, you were 2-2 with him when he was still tall and skinny.
SPEAKER_02: Now he is 103 kilos. Good point. Can you ask Zorab, if the weight gain...
SPEAKER_00: He still, despite that Georgii will be 103 kg, despite that fact, Zurab claims that it's still not enough for Georgii to have a great advantage over Zurab in sideways. I understand. It would take him around 125 kg. It's still 20 kg heavier.
SPEAKER_00: for the math. But you were like this already now you are this big. So Georgii, Georgii, if you had chance
SPEAKER_00: Do you think it is better for you to pull Zurab in 80-85 kg or is it better for you to pull in 105 kg? What do you think, if you had a chance, what would be more comfortable for you to fight against Zurab? How are you now, 103 kg or when you were around 85 kg?
SPEAKER_01: It's actually more comfortable for me when I weigh more. Because when I weighed 80 kg, I didn't have any strength at all. I don't know what I was fighting for. I had such arms. And it was difficult for me.
SPEAKER_01: Now it's more or less easier for me to fight. It's just that my physical muscles have become normal. And the only thing that worries me is the injury to my wrist. When I fought with Irakli, I was injured. And a little bit here. And in general, it's better when I weigh more.
SPEAKER_00: Well, short answer is yes.
SPEAKER_00: It's better for him when he weighs bigger. So now he prefers this 103 against 103 rather than 80 versus 80 because he explained back then when I was 80 kg, I used to fight. I did not even know what I was doing because I barely had any muscle and I barely felt any strength. I was just using my techniques and my leverage over opponents. Right now, when I'm this heavy, I feel my muscles are there. I have more physical muscles.
SPEAKER_00: And I feel overall more strength and more comfortable against opponents. And now I know more what I'm doing. But one thing is what's bothering me is the injury that I sustained against Irakli. It was here in Greece and also around this area here. But if this injury won't pay
SPEAKER_00: how can i say if this injury won't affect my match against zurab i'd i think my strength would be better as i'm 103 right now so do you think that your wrist injury will come when you pull against the hook puller he's not attacking your hand
SPEAKER_00: How do you think he will not open your hand? He said that Zura will twist you or try to twist you. Do you think it will be your injury against Irakli to say that you have an injury with a brush? Do you think it will be...
SPEAKER_00: for you or for Zurab, because Zurab won't try to open your brush. He will just twist it. I won't open your brush, bro.
SPEAKER_04: he said don't worry brother i will not open up your wrist don't worry about it yeah but listen whenever we asked the question zura was already smiling looks like i have a surprise you know you know even go outside yes yes yes
SPEAKER_01: It would be difficult for me, it would definitely hurt. It would hurt a hundred percent. And since he's fighting in the biceps, it won't hurt that much for sure. So I know that there will definitely be a breakdown, there will be a breakdown a million percent, and then there will be bandages.
SPEAKER_01: So, Anglin, as you said, it's Rob who is my opponent. He's not going to aim to top roll me, most likely.
SPEAKER_00: had i had any top roller opponent right now i would most likely suffer from the pain at least pain because of this uh previous injury but since zurab is not gonna try to top roll me at least what uh georgie thinks will do he says my no problem with my injury they will not bother they will according to georgie they will hundred percent million percent they will slip
SPEAKER_00: and they go into straps and then maybe in straps could be some type of discomfort and slight pain, but very less likely because of how stylistically Zurab gonna try to approach the match. So don't worry, no worries about that. I don't have any... What if Zurab tries to top roll you? It's impossible. Impossible? You said you have wrist problem.
SPEAKER_00: You're going to have problems with the game, I'm telling you. He said maybe after three rounds. Oh, this is like best of five. So if it comes to three, they finish.
SPEAKER_04: Ah, he said in third round. If it's 1-1 or 2-0, in third round, like decisive. So, Zurov is saying that when he loses two rounds and third round, out of desperation, he will try another? And I'll say? Look at Georgii, Georgii is so happy.
SPEAKER_00: I'm just joking, Zura. I'm joking. He said it will be vice versa. Once he's winning against Giorgio, then he will top roll him. But whenever I said this, Giorgio was like, impossible. You know, he was like...
SPEAKER_04: There may be a little discomfort because he's going inside. But what if it hurts you if he tries to toproll you? Hey, he toprolled Ryan Bornman. Arsen you better than Ryan Bornman?
SPEAKER_00: Georgii, Engin said that Zurab did a toproll against Ryan Bowen. And he asked you, are you a better toproller than Ryan Bowen? What do you think? Well, yes, yes. Because Zurab did a toproll against Ryan Bowen, no problem at all.
SPEAKER_00: I don't remember who you fought with. He said he doesn't remember that name. He doesn't know who Zurab Toprol is. He doesn't know any person like that. You don't know any person like Zurab Toprol? Is Ryan the only guy that is Toprol in your life?
SPEAKER_02: If you were to weigh 20-30 kilos in a year, if you were to weigh 20-30 kilos in a year, if you were to weigh 20-30 kilos in a year, if you were to weigh 20-30 kilos in a year, if you were to weigh 20-30 kilos in a year, if you were to weigh 20-30 kilos in a year, if you were to weigh 20-30 kilos in a year, if you were to weigh 20-30 kilos in a year,
SPEAKER_00: He said that back in those WAF days, if I knew that my opponent was significantly weaker, I was top-rolling. But maybe one or two times at most in my life, other than Ryan Bowen. Is Georgii weak enough so you can try?
SPEAKER_02: Zura, your name is Georgii Susti Toproleri, as it should be. Georgii Toproleri is very strong, even the strongest. I respect him, he is very strong. I respect you too.
SPEAKER_02: Georgii is a very strong player. If you look at Georgii and Dagli, you will see that they are very close to Georgii from the first to the second game.
SPEAKER_00: Well, at first he answered in Russian so that Georgii would also instantly understand. He said, no, of course not. Georgii is, if not the best, one of the best approllers. I appreciate him very much. And Georgii said, likewise, brother. And then he continued with Georgii and he said,
SPEAKER_00: It would take even good top-rollers hard time and very, very tough day against Georgii to try to top-roll him. And maybe I would be successful if I somehow tire up Georgii extremely much. But not in a fresh match, huh?
SPEAKER_00: According to Zurab, he said no. The only chance would be, obviously, I wish I could top-roll Gyorgy, but realistically, Zurab said, I think the only case I can do that is when I exhaust him too much. Gyorgy, Zurab said that Zurab will hold you low here and top-roll you. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: He said that actually everybody, not only Georgii, but also you, Engin, to know I have trained very big weights for my shoulder, so just be careful. Anything is possible. And one more question. Georgii, what is the possibility Zurab to beat you with deadlift?
SPEAKER_00: How do you think, how many chances does Zurab have, let's say 100%, how many chances does Zurab have to beat you in the flop? How many chances does Zurab have?
SPEAKER_01: Well, I think that's how it will be, probably. That's how it should be, in theory. That he fights like that, I fight like that. Well, I said, I'll bet 70% on myself.
SPEAKER_00: Well, most likely this is how it will end up. Zurab end up going like this sideways or trying to press me and I will be like this holding him from the top position. But I'm still going to stay intact with my prediction. As I said, 70% of my chance winning. So that gives Zurab 30%. Zurab, one more question. You two years ago broke your arm.
SPEAKER_00: Do you think that it is any dangerous for you to pull this way or not?
SPEAKER_02: I don't have a problem with that. I just want to be comfortable. And I want to be comfortable with the fact that I was never like this, I had a bad life. I want to be comfortable with everything. That's what I'm trying to say.
SPEAKER_02: I don't think it's a good idea to think instinctively that there's something wrong with the game
SPEAKER_00: throughout these two years, I've been going through so different and many type of variations of trainings and also strength wise, like weight wise, going heavier and heavier. I have zero feeling of any discomfort going this way and having my injury playing any type of role. And at the first time, actually, when I
SPEAKER_00: push that way, it has no chance of, not that much chance of breaking or injuring my arm. It was not how I sustained the injury according to Zura. He said, so me pushing that way, as you asked the question Engin, I'm not gonna have any issues with my injury. But does he have anything psychologically, any problem? No, he said no. I have no discomfort in my mind. That's good, that's good, that's good, yeah. Great, so let's talk about the matches.
SPEAKER_02: Zurab, let me ask you first. Lachlan vs Petro Marharin. I don't know who it is. Lachlan is a very strong Australian, but I think Petro has a chance of 35%.
SPEAKER_00: He said Lachlan is very strong. He knows that Lachlan is strong, but still Petro would be around 65% favorite in Scrooge's mind. And he said he doesn't know... Petro, what's his name? Petro Marharin. Marharin, Petro, from Ukraine. And the other one? Lachlan Adair. From Australia.
SPEAKER_02: from australia okay if you don't remember we go to the next one yeah there is a super chat from dino
SPEAKER_04: How are you guys doing? Engin looking big? Engin doesn't look big, but slowly I started training. Now beginning. Three months later, we will see. Did you watch Zurab, the last East vs West? There was a girl, Jocelyn.
SPEAKER_02: Yes, I agree with everything you said. I agree with everything you said. I agree with everything you said.
SPEAKER_00: Surabh said, I watch everything. I watch every armwrestling type of thing. And this Jocelyn girl, she is so big and so strong, she could also actually pull with the men divisions, no problem. According to, he said, how strong Jocelyn is. Yes, she is pulling against Egle, who is winning. Egle is very strong.
SPEAKER_02: 50-50. I don't know. 50-50. 50-50. 50-50. 50-50. 50-50. 50-50. 50-50. 50-50. 50-50. 50-50. 50-50. 50-50. 50-50. 50-50. 50-50. 50-50. 50-50. 50-50. 50-50. 50-50. 50-50. 50-50. 50-50. 50-50. 50-50. 50-50. 50-50. 50-50. 50-50. 50-50. 50-50. 50-50. 50-50. 50-50. 50-50. 50-50. 50-50. 50-50. 50-50. 50-50. 50-50. 50-50. 50-50. 50-50. 50-50. 50-50. 50-50. 50-50. 50-50. 50-50. 50-50. 50-50. 50-50. 50-50
SPEAKER_00: According to Zurab, Egle is a more technical armwrestler with more experience, whilst Jocelyn on the other side, maybe she has a sheer strength, strength-wise more powerful, but still 50-50 in Zurab's mind. Can you talk to her as well? Dio, how do you think, you know Jocelyn, right?
SPEAKER_00: I know Elin Vajkut. I also support her. I think she should win. He said he knows both. He knows also Elin and he cheers for Elin. And he also thinks that Elin will end up victorious. Okay. So, Zurab. Where is the crazy match? Which one? Who is winning the crazy match? Nugul.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, Zorav. Zorav, who is more crazy? Matt or Nugo is more crazy? More crazy is Nugo. Nugo? I don't know Nugo. I don't know Nugo. I don't know Nugo.
SPEAKER_02: Matt Mask's hand is very strong, he is very strong, I can beat Nugo's hand, I can beat Tevani's hand, but Nugo is very strong physically and Nugo can beat me in every way.
SPEAKER_00: He cheers for Nugo. He's all the way back in Nugo's corner. And he thinks also Nugo will win, even though Matt Mask has huge leverage against Nugo right now as an advantage for himself. He has big hands, long range, whilst Nugo will feel discomfort in there. But still, as a raw power, Nugo will outcome all the obstacles. And for sure, he will win, according to Nugo.
SPEAKER_01: And Georgii? What do you think? I think it will be difficult for Nougat because I think his hand is small, his palm. And Mask has a big palm, on the contrary. Huge, yes. And it will probably be uncomfortable for him, I think.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know, maybe there should be... There, too, I think everything will be decided 100%. I don't know, it's hard to say. It's a different fight. Well, let it be Nuga. Do you think there will be a shot 3-0 or 3-2? I think it won't be easy. There will definitely not be a zero, I think.
SPEAKER_02: So according to Georgii's estimations, he thinks
SPEAKER_00: Obviously, it's going to be very uncomfortable for Nugo according to the leverage differences. Like Zurab said, Georgii also estimates that Matt's sheer dominance could be caused by this hand size difference, which would be very uncomfortable for Nugo.
SPEAKER_00: It will be still a very tight battle. Then I asked what would be the score if anybody wins. He said maybe 3-2 or 3-1 for Nugo. And they both agreed the score will not be zero. It will be around 3-1 or 3-2. So very tight match. But winner would be Nugo. Okay. And let's go to Kamil Jablonski versus Gyorgy Dzeranov.
SPEAKER_01: Dzeranov, 100%. Wow. Do you think so, Georgii? Yes. 100%, do you think, Georgii? Well, it depends on the fight. Dzeranov can fight with his biceps. If he twists his biceps like Matyushenko twisted Yeblonsky's, like this.
SPEAKER_04: No, no, no, no. Ivan Matyushenko, Jablonski was right. This is left. Ah, left. What's the difference? There's a difference. He said, what's the difference? The difference is... Okay, Zolev, Haji Murat. Right, left difference? Yes, but it's Zolev, Haji Murat. It's Georgii Dzeranov. No, no, no. I'm talking about Kamil Jablonski. Right...
SPEAKER_01: Left and right. But Kamil is not as strong on the right as he is on the left. I understand, but the thing is that they will still twist. If they twist the full biceps hook, Dzeranov will win. Here, Yablonsky has this strong pressure, and Dzeranov has a strong biceps.
SPEAKER_00: So, realistically, either way, if it's left or right, both athletes would approach most likely the same way. It will all come down to how strong Kamil can execute and how fast he can get in this type of position to press him.
SPEAKER_00: if he man if the runner manages to curve him and like hook him at least halfway in hook uh camel is not as effective as when he presses down do you think that the press is not possible when you have the wrist oh uh
SPEAKER_00: Do you think it's possible for Kamil to win? No, it's clear that Kamil has a chance. He's not going to win for sure. In armwrestling, everything happens.
SPEAKER_01: But the thing is, when Kamil fights like this, he has more chances to win than when he spins and fights like this. I think so. These are completely different things. To fight like this.
SPEAKER_01: And you think that Kamil won't try to twist it? I think that if Kamil twists it, it will be more difficult for him. If Dzeranov will fight with the top, and Kamil like this, then Dzeranov will probably have a hard time. I think so.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. According to Georgii, like everybody would know, it's two different styles, even though they are both pressing, let's say, if we are talking about pressing dead wrist press, and if we're talking about pressing when it's curled, when it's hooked and sole pressing, as you asked, it's two different presses, two different ways to execute and to
SPEAKER_00: it will be not as easy for Kamil to hook whilst it's curved as it would be when he is actually in the losing risk position. And then I asked, what do you think, Georgii, will Kamil try to press even if they end up in hook? And he said that, well, it's up to Kamil, but for sure it will be...
SPEAKER_00: more discomfort for him and less effective for him to still try to hook when they are pressed and vice versa if Kamil manages to lose his wrist like end up in this position pressing and Georgii tries to top roll him then it's for Georgii it will be hard way to continue Georgii like for example Ibrahim Sago Ibrahim Sago shoulder pressure will be the wrist you know he's maybe Kamil can do the same because Ibrahim Sago when he pull against you he was doing like this
SPEAKER_01: But other people, he hooks and then he also do press with the wrist, you know, like this. Maybe Kamil also can do it. I don't know. I understand. Maybe Kamil is already so strong, but still. I think Kamil is something like Jerry Cadoretti, who was Jerry Cadoretti. Something like that.
SPEAKER_00: well armwrestling is armwrestling that could also be the scenario it could be the possibility but to me Kamil Jablonski strikes me as an armwrestler like Jerry but on left hand we are talking about left handed match now so in Georgii's mind he would be like Jerry Cadoret like still this way presser not like hook remember when Gennady and Jerry put one round Gennady try hook and then
SPEAKER_02: Jerry Press with the wrist as well. Anyway, so let's go to the next match. Zura, Georgii Svetkov vs. David Dadikyan, left arm. I think it's going to be a tough match. Which category? I think it's going to be a tough one.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, Gyorgy is asking the category? He asked the category, yeah. Gyorgy, you are asking me the category of the Gyorgy Svetkov? 75 kilo. Come on. Come on. S and G, S and G. Just joking. Yeah, Zubov was saying it's very hard to predict. He has been thinking about this match quite a lot. I think, Yannis, Armagar Formaşi, Adam, Cem Yazritu,
SPEAKER_02: I don't know if it's a swedish idea, I don't know if it's a swedish idea, I don't know if it's a swedish idea, I don't know if it's a swedish idea, I don't know if it's a swedish idea, I don't know if it's a swedish idea, I don't know if it's a swedish idea, I don't know if it's a swedish idea, I don't know if it's a swedish idea,
SPEAKER_00: It's extremely hard for me to predict this match. I have been thinking about it, but like it could go both ways because Tadikian showed amazing shape last time on Lefty against Alex, but also in my mind, I think
SPEAKER_00: Still slight favorite should be Georgii Svetkov in this match, but nothing will be surprising me coming from David Tadikian in this match. If he ends up doing something, it won't be surprising to me because how capable he is in general. So 50-50, it's very hard to predict. And Georgii?
SPEAKER_01: I know why I asked what category, because Dadikyan in any case will weigh less, he has less weight than Dadikyan, he should be, in theory, by a kilogram, probably 10 he will weigh less, at least.
SPEAKER_01: That's why I thought maybe Cvetkov lost 115 kg. I don't know. I don't know. It will be difficult for Dikyan, of course. He will be smaller, that's for sure. Cvetkov is a very good athlete. Cvetkov and Levan Saginashvili won the World and European Championships. He's a strong athlete. He won the European championship on the left. Yes, he won on the left. 2015.
SPEAKER_01: Bulgaria. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.
SPEAKER_00: uh he said the reason why i asked about the weights is i was focused on dadikian's name i did not really think about opponents so for dadikian it plays the role what type of category is he pulling but regardless it will be like he will be at least 10 kg less maybe even more uh than tvetko and no no probably 40 kilo
SPEAKER_00: He said that there will be a difference of about 40 kilograms. You see. Georgii is 160 kilos, 165 kilos. We are all favorites. Yeah, and that's why Georgii should be a favorite in this match. And also Georgii said back in those days, which you understood, he said that Georgii used to beat Levan on lefty. Yeah. And Zurob also said that. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: But it will be a close match Zura, Pauline vs David Stamushchia Stamushchia's motivation... Stamushchia won the first event against Pauline
SPEAKER_02: And that's why everyone thinks that Pauline is going to win now and that she's going to win again. And I think that in that form and in that statics, Pauline is going to win twice.
SPEAKER_02: I don't think that Pauline is going to start a startup like this. She is going to start a company and I think she will be able to do it. I think she will be able to do it.
SPEAKER_00: It was like first ever match that Samushio got from you and this competition was against Paul Linn and he ended up losing it but since then he's been beating everybody else we all know and now he's back again versus Paul Linn in same weight class like they were last time and it would
SPEAKER_00: end up being a curse if Dawit loses against him again. So I think Dawit will do whatever he can and at his best to not make it appear as a curse and try to beat Polin this time. We all know most likely they will end up in hook. I think also that Polin is not going to be the one who will drag Dawit in Dawit's losing position right at the goal.
SPEAKER_00: The match will stop around somewhere in the center. And then in the long run, it will come down to the endurance. We know how endurable David is. And I think around 80% that David would win this time. And Georgii? Based on endurance. What do you think, Georgii? I... It's 80... What category? It's 95. Oh, 95.
SPEAKER_01: How was it the first time Paul Linn and Samusha fought? Samusha lost 3-2. It was the first match against Samusha. I got it. Well, maybe it was because of the preparation. Maybe Samusha was the best, who knows.
SPEAKER_01: If they get into the hook together, looking at Samusha, he's very tough. If he's even more tough, Samusha will probably be his favourite in this competition. I think so. I think 60% Samusha, 40% Paul Linn.
SPEAKER_00: Okay. Well, I know that they are, I know their matches. They have met already at 95 kg. Well, it could be also that it will come down to who prepared and how they prepared against each other since they already know each other. They fought. Maybe, maybe Samusha tries to top roll this time. Who knows? What I know is that
SPEAKER_00: Samush is really good at endurance and in hooking style, right? And I think overall, considering how he performs and how he has been performing throughout these years, I think he should be favorite because of this endurance, maybe like 60% to 40%.
SPEAKER_00: against Poland this time. So according to Georgii, David would be victorious. And also based on endurance, because they both, Zurab and him, both pointed out endurance factor of Samushin. Okay. Ivan Matushenko versus Serhii Kalinchenko. Prava. I would say Matushenko is my favorite.
SPEAKER_02: But Kalinichenko is a very hard worker. He is a very hardworking sportsman and he will not be able to do what Kalinichenko does. I will not be able to do that. But he is probably the most popular, the most popular, the most popular, the most popular, the most popular, the most popular, the most popular, the most popular, the most popular, the most popular, the most popular, the most popular, the most popular, the most popular, the most popular, the most popular, the most popular, the most popular, the most popular, the most popular, the most popular, the most popular, the most popular, the most popular, the most popular, the most popular, the most popular, the most popular, the most popular, the most popular, the most popular, the most popular, the most popular, the most popular, the most popular, the most popular, the most popular, the most popular, the most popular, the most popular, the most popular, the most popular, the most popular, the most popular, the
SPEAKER_00: I find Matushenko to be favorite, maybe 55 to 45%. But I will also not be surprised if Kalina ends up winning. He is a very dedicated sportsman, dedicated armwrestler. He trains a lot.
SPEAKER_00: a lot against his opponents. So that could also play a role for this match for Kalinichenko. And if he wins, I will also not be a shocker for me and I will not be surprised. But to me, Ivan is favorite 55 to 45%. Zurab, does Serhii have any chance to top role Matushenko or he can win only in hook?
SPEAKER_01: I think Matyushenko has more chances. It's not even 55-45, I think Matyushenko
SPEAKER_01: Kalinichenko won't be able to do it. I think he won't be able to do it. Maybe he can do it without ties, but Matyushenko can twist it. If Matyushenko twists it, Kalinichenko has little chance. In my opinion. I think Matyushenko will win 70%.
SPEAKER_00: Well, he also thinks that Matyushenko is his favorite. Kalina will not be top-rolling him. Most likely they will go and hook. But it's not going to be 55, but it will be like 70 to 30% favorite he won. Okay, let's go to the next one. By the way, Zurab, from 1 to 10, how would you rate the whole card, all matches, all events, the matchups?
SPEAKER_02: In my opinion, Anu, how was it? Yes, Anu, from the beginning to the end, it was very interesting. In my opinion, all these social problems and all this interest were very interesting. It was very interesting and I liked it when Levan came out, when Devon came out, but what is unbalanced in the matches is that
SPEAKER_00: Ford me, this card is most interesting and most well-balanced when it comes to the pin-pointing the matches, opponents against each other. Except Zurab versus Georgii, Zurab is winning 70%.
SPEAKER_02: I'm assuming that neither Georgii is going to count this match as well because they both predicted themselves to be 70%.
SPEAKER_00: Realistically, it's well balanced. And from the third guy's perspective, it's really amazing card. Of course, whenever Levan is on the card or Devon is on the card, pay-per-view can be sold with high numbers. But when you ask me, Engin, how to rate this card from 0 to 10, how well balanced this is, it's extremely interesting, exciting, and really good matches. I would give 10 out of 10.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, that's very good. I will ask Georgii, I guess, in English, right? Yeah. How do you think, Georgii, out of 10, how will the score be? Not the score, but how will you say... How will you rate it? How will you rate it? How many points? I understand. Ford this card. I think that...
SPEAKER_01: In today's reality, it's easier to collect a good card. Allen the athletes are good, all of them are strong. And it's not difficult to pick up athletes for each other. Ford example, when I fought with Zirakashvili, then there was also a good card. Now it's also good, I like it.
SPEAKER_01: Of course, I would really like to see a couple. Ford example, Todd Hutchings and Georgii Tautiev. That's also interesting. From 1 to 10, I think this card is somewhere around 8.
SPEAKER_00: Do you think it's the best? No, I think the last one was on the 9th. Well, not the last one in Georgii, but the last one in Turkey. Ah, the last one in Turkey. Okay. It was from Versus Fest on the 15th of November.
SPEAKER_00: that that that that that okay okay well he said um lately when we when we're considering that sport is getting popular and uh more and more arm wrestlers themselves uh gain more and more followers as they compete on this high stage uh it's getting uh
SPEAKER_00: relatively easier to figure out not to figure out but whoever you pull card is gonna be watched and people will find it very interesting more or less considering that when it was let's say back then at the beginning
SPEAKER_04: maybe it was not that much well known for in general public for in general armwrestling world and now now now the same matches more famous right more famous and it is regardless who gets against who for instance me not really not really if you make a match it doesn't look good people goes oh it's a mismatch it's terrible you know but yeah yeah but but i agree with him about the part that you know more athletes like that that was my goal like before
SPEAKER_04: Top, top, top eight was like eight athletes. And then one was like the same athletes, like same North American athletes. And then whenever I started this, a lot of athletes, people didn't know, but now, now, as he said, you know, everyone knows them and yeah. And like, like still some new athletes come. So what does he rate?
SPEAKER_04: He said eight, and then I asked eight from the ten, and I asked, do you think this is the best card? And he said, no, the best was Israel versus 15 last time in Istanbul. Yeah. When he also pulled the Iraqi. Yeah, okay. Yeah. Let's go to, imagine that we did all those matches, and now we talk, and now Artur Makaro versus Daniel Prokopchuk. Right? Probably, yeah? Yeah, probably. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: In my opinion, in order to win, it is necessary to win. But Prokofchuk's thinking is in favor. Prokofchuk's opinion is in favor of 95 percent.
SPEAKER_00: 55% Prokopchuk I think will be favorite. Ford sure this match will get stopped and for sure it will come down to endurance because it's a title match, it's a long run and endurance wise Prokopchuk should be a favorite. That's why I think Prokopchuk doesn't know how to fight in the ring. He doesn't know how to fight in the ring. Yes, he doesn't know how to fight in the ring. Prokopchuk doesn't know how to fight in the ring.
SPEAKER_02: Yes, that's right. That's why I think it's better to have a lot of food in the kitchen.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, he thinks that Prokopchuk Daniel will not go willingly in hook because he should assume that Makarov would be favorite in hook. And then I ask, so you mean match will get stopped whilst Daniel is trying to prohibit Makarov to go in hook? And yes, he said Daniel will try to hold him from the outside and match will stop and then it will come down to endurance. Georgii?
SPEAKER_01: I think so too. I think Prokopchuk will fight with the top. I think Prokopchuk will not go into the bicep. How he fought with Alan. Like this. Because he has a little chance in the hook. But he fights well with the top too. I give 55% in favor of Makarov.
SPEAKER_00: He shares the same idea of Prokopciuk will not be willingly going in hook. And he knows that Anil can also be a good puller from outside. He can pull well, but still favorite would be 55% Makarov in Georgii's mind. Okay. And Zorab, Gennady versus Ibrahim Sago. 150 kilos.
SPEAKER_02: Yes, of course, I don't know how many people have experienced something like this, but I don't know how many people have experienced something like this, but I don't know how many people have experienced something like this, but I don't know how many people have experienced something like this, but I don't know how many people have experienced something like this, but I don't know how many people have experienced something like this, but I don't know how
SPEAKER_00: Had it been super heavyweight category, zero doubts, Gennady should have been favorite and would be victorious. Right now, since it's heavyweight class 115,
SPEAKER_00: I think it will come down to how well Gennady perform with this weight loss, after this weight loss, how comfortable he will feel at this weight. This is his new category, so to say, and hard for me to say that he is clear favorite. On the other hand, we have Sago, who is big with big frame, big muscles also.
SPEAKER_00: well fit and he could also pull practically against anybody so uh really it's a 50 50 in my mind it's it's heavyweight class it's not super heavyweight so kennedy will have good battle there 50 50. he did not say anybody's favorite yeah
SPEAKER_01: I think that in this fight, if Gennady catches Sagov and can hold him for at least a second,
SPEAKER_01: Well, 5-7 seconds, probably. If he can hold it, he has a lot of chances to win. But it depends on whether he presses it right away or doesn't press it right away. It's hard to say. If he presses it right away, well, I don't know. Despite that, Gennady will have to lose weight by 115 kg.
SPEAKER_00: It's difficult. Well, let's say 50-50. You said that Gennady will defend himself, how to say, Sago will produce... Yes, he will. He will. If he doesn't defend himself, there will be no chance.
SPEAKER_00: Well, he said it will be very hard for Gennady to end up victorious in this match if Sago manages to pin him relatively sooner than three seconds. He said, but if Gennady manages to stop the match at least and hold him in the center, relatively close to center,
SPEAKER_00: around four or five seconds each round, then Gennady has greater chances than Sagov to end up victorious. And then also said, yeah, of course, Gennady has to drop down the weight. It will also play a huge role. But let's go with 50-50. This is what he said. Okay. People on the chat, they say that Zurab and Tautiev, they are in the same car actually right now.
SPEAKER_00: They say in the chat that you are together in the car. You are on the left and Zura is on the right. You are with yourself.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, he did not want to reveal the secret, but yeah, that's the case. Yeah. Okay, Zurab, let's go. Tata Kings versus Rukhs and Babaev.
SPEAKER_02: He said that this is one of the most maybe even most exciting match on this card for sure for Engin also this is
SPEAKER_02: Top, top exciting car, I'm sure he knows. And who is winning? Me, Aziz. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure.
SPEAKER_02: He is a true fan and a true fan of Hachinksi. I think that Rustami is a legend in the world of pyrotechnics.
SPEAKER_02: We all know the history between these two athletes. It was not in favor of Western Puller, but in this case,
SPEAKER_00: considering how stable East versus West is going and also how relatively well Todd Hutching is pulling, I have noticed that lately in this late stage of Todd's career, he manages to fix some mistakes that he used to have, let's say also backing against Babay, right? So I still think that those
SPEAKER_00: progress progresses in those type of details that Hutchings has been performing and showing us lately will be decisive in this match even though rustam is a legend for me he is one of my most favorite
SPEAKER_00: personal and also as an athlete, very good person and good athlete, one of my favorites. But I still think that match will stop. It will stop. And I know that Hutchings had been more effective to control the hand and wrist of himself and opponents. So this time, because of those mistakes that Hutchings has been proving that he has improved and kind of ruled out those mistakes because of that factor,
SPEAKER_01: in this match now ties with shift towards to western puller and he thinks todd hutchins will win okay and georgie
SPEAKER_01: But I will root for him 100%. Because, first of all, he fought in the previous tournament, in the previous tournament, and now he will fight in the third tournament in a row. He had almost no time to recover. He fought in three tournaments in a row. Now he will be the third.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, now he will be the third. He won everything. He won the favorites. He won in Zirakashvili. At such an age, so strong. In short, I admire him. He is a very cool guy. That's why I treat Rustam well. He has so many years, so many victories, so many titles. But I think...
SPEAKER_01: Well, I'm
SPEAKER_00: 100 in Todd's Corner in this one though I appreciate it I'm really good with uh bye-bye wisdom as well we are good friends but considering this last three events this would be Todd's third event in a row of performing considering how he pulled and defeated the uh favorite guy in his own match who was Iraq Lee Iraq was favorite but he ends up beating him and uh then
SPEAKER_00: Right next event, he ends up victorious and now this is the third one and third event in a row he's performing.
SPEAKER_00: He's blowing my mind how crazy good shape he is right now. I'm really, really blown away. And I think he manages to take this one as well. He's really in a good shape. This is his time right now. Even though Obaev, there's no need for any words. We all know how good he is and how legendary. Both Zurab and Georgii think that Todd is favorite. Todd is, they both. Okay, let's go Zurab.
SPEAKER_02: Vitaly Laletin vs. Michael Todd. I think Vitaly is the favorite, definitely the favorite. Both Mike Todd and Michael Todd are the favorites. They are the ones who can solve all problems. Absolutely all problems. But Vitaly's favorite is...
SPEAKER_02: 35-40% because Vitaly is the only one who can compete with Ermes and Levan. Vitaly is the only one who can compete with Levan. Vitaly is the only one who can compete with Levan. Vitaly is the only one who can compete with Levan. Vitaly is the only one who can compete with Levan. Vitaly is the only one who can compete with Levan. Vitaly is the only one who can compete with Levan.
SPEAKER_00: He believes Vitaly is favorite in this match. The reason is that they both obviously perform really well. They are very strong, but lately people in majority of community's eyes
SPEAKER_00: Vitaly is somewhere Levan, Ermes level, and he keeps progressing. Then I re-asked, so you mean Vitaly progresses from match to match more than Michael, I asked, and he said yes. But on the other hand, Michael is the athlete he can put in deep waters and in deep trouble any opponent, regardless of opponent's style. Michael will put them in very hard positions. But overall, I still believe Vitaly is favorite here.
SPEAKER_00: around 70 percent because of how much he can progress within short time as the other athlete also has the same time to progress so yeah georgie
SPEAKER_01: I think that there, in any case, Vitalik will open his hand to him. In any case, there will be a king's move. This king's move is not crowned with success, I think, because Vitalik has a long hand.
SPEAKER_01: And it will be difficult for him to open his hand from the King's Move position. And it also depends on how he... Well, I think he will do everything correctly, clearly, he will hold a little bit here, as it should be. Therefore, this King's Move, it will definitely be. There is no other option to avoid the King's Move.
SPEAKER_01: It will be for sure. Michael Todd will fight with such movements. Because neither in the biceps he will be able to twist it, nor in the upper part. And in the triceps he won't be able to do it either. That's why there will be a king's move. And I don't think a king's move with Vitalik's long arm will work. That's why I think Vitalik will win for sure.
SPEAKER_00: he is very sure 100% he is sure that Vitaly will end up victorious he did not actually said what's the score like 3-0 or something but he said 100% Vitaly will be victorious because
SPEAKER_00: Ford sure, this match will go in open top roll Kings move type of style. Michael cannot do anything on goal, cannot press Vitaly, cannot hook Vitaly, cannot try to top roll him. So we all know that match will go in the spot where Michael can be the most dangerous. But even there, Vitaly has so long leverage, so long hand, he still could
SPEAKER_00: position himself and execute quite well he will not gonna try to push him uh we are not gonna try to push michael in this king's multi position like this he will try to adjust he will be smart about it he will uh try to
SPEAKER_00: position-wise put himself in a better position to finish Michael, according to Georgii. So Vitaly will be ready for Michael's Kings move. That's the only option Michael can try to win. And I'm sure Vitaly will be regardless ready for that one. And 100% he will be victorious. Okay, okay.
SPEAKER_00: Do you guys have any last message to each other or to your fans? Anything lastly you want to say before we finish? Do you have anything to say to your opponent or to your fans? We will end this live stream. Come on, Georgii, I'm listening.
SPEAKER_01: He said, go ahead, Georgii. I wish you good preparation, good form. The main thing is your good psychological state, so that you don't have any thoughts, problems in your head. I wish the same for myself. And what I want to say, we will try to show you a beautiful fight. I think it will be like that.
SPEAKER_01: root for me of course and watch this tournament this is a very good tournament very prestigious tournament in the world the most interesting pairs very good pairs will be meat even if I didn't fight I would really like to come and see
SPEAKER_01: Thanks, bro.
SPEAKER_00: well uh let georgie to start uh he said well drop i wish you a very good preparation uh physical wise but also uh my mental health like so that there is not gonna be any type of doubts in your mind when when it comes to the uh preparation for our match and i also likewise wish it to myself that's what georgie said and then um
SPEAKER_00: He turned into the public, like viewers who are watching us right now. Guys, this type of card is one of the most interesting and most exciting armwrestling cards that ever existed.
