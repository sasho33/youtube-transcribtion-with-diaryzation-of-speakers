SPEAKER_02: Okay. Now we are live. Yep. So what were we talking about? Yeah. Sleep. Good sleep. Yeah. Good sleep. And how are the trainings? It's fine. I'm getting, I think I'm getting a bit like lighter, but I'm not sure because I don't have a scale. When you say you get lighter, you mean that you lose some unnecessary weight?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, leaner, leaner. The measurements are the same, but I... So, it is quality, my friend. Yeah. Yeah, so... And very soon they will join us in five minutes, so it's still good. So, it is... And...

SPEAKER_02: Greetings to Denmark, Mathias. Ranks on. I had to click on this on fast as possible and join this podcast in the sun. Okay. Berzerker says, hey, Engin, the card is amazing. Yes.
SPEAKER_02: Mick Cam. Good day, legend. Good day, my friends. I was just laughing at one of the user's troll name, Crocodilo. Okay, okay. Hello, Stacks. Yep. Alex, great to have him. Bombardilo, Crocodilo, tra-la-la. Okay, whatever.
SPEAKER_02: Let me share the link, and then we can continue. I start a little bit early. I saw that you are here, so I just didn't want you to feel lonely. What a good guy I am. Yeah, every time, every time. Yeah, yeah, you come, like, as soon as I send you the link, in a few minutes, you are here.
SPEAKER_02: mean i don't always join because i still have a lot of things to do but um and then i will share on instagram and then we are ready to go so what do you think about the matches do you have your own predictions
SPEAKER_01: I would say, for me, maybe the best card ever. Maybe even better than 15. Vitaly versus Mike is one of my favorite matches ever, probably. The last few days, I'm swinging more Mike now. I'm feeling more Mike.
SPEAKER_02: do you do you think that the things that you have been hearing has effect on you or this is because you look at them and then or you think more and then change your mind yeah i think the style i think the style is the biggest thing for vidali and this match too georgie versus tarik and it was very unexpected like it came out of nowhere i was like what yeah
SPEAKER_02: But we need to set these matches, yeah. We need to set them. And I think the event in the morning, East versus West finals, I think there will be some crazy matches. That's what I think.
SPEAKER_01: the finals is like the first place gets to pull at easter's west right yeah we invite yeah yeah we invite them yeah yes we invite them and
SPEAKER_02: And it is totally up to their performance to be invited again. If they win, probably they will get to be invited again, but not always in the next event sometimes because it's getting bigger and bigger. So it's very hard to give matches to everyone all the time.
SPEAKER_01: And what's your favorite match? I have three favorites, I think. Vitaly and Mike. Nugo and Matt, obviously. And who is winning there? Nugo and Matt? Nugo, for sure. 100%. Wow. But it's such a cool match.
SPEAKER_02: It's going to be crazy. It's going to be crazy. Yes, yes, yes. It will be crazy. I can already see Matt hitting the table like this. Nugo screaming at him like, ah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, incredible characters, you know. I'm very happy and a little bit proud that I brought all these athletes together to the same league, you know. I'm very...
SPEAKER_02: um happy that that was my dream dream you know because like what being divided is bad you know okay somebody just came hello david how are you hello hello hello again good good thank you thanks alex so david dennis dennis tiplenko told to elmar
SPEAKER_01: that you are 130 kilos. Is that true? No. No, no, no. I can weigh myself right now. I'm 116, 117. Oh, okay. So then one of them is joking. Either Denis is joking or Elmar is joking.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, they're probably joking, and this weight, even if I had it, it wouldn't be for Georgii. It would be for what? Vitaly? Yeah, Vitaly, right? He told me, he told me. Whenever I offer him the match,
SPEAKER_02: First time against Alex, he was like, okay, let me think, you know, and then he said, Engin, this has been my dream anyways, to be absolute champion. So let's start.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I wasn't sure just because of the injury and that I haven't pulled in a while. But for sure, all the way in,
SPEAKER_02: That's how it should be. I asked Vitaly, I said, Vitaly, David wants you. And he said, oh, no, no, no, let him pull Alijan first.
SPEAKER_00: Well, I don't know. It's just some thoughts that have to come true. Now we have to beat Georgii. Once Alex went, now, God forbid, we have to beat Georgii. And then we have to discuss, or we have to defend Vitalik's title. Vitalik is my good friend, with all due respect. But we have to fight, after all.
SPEAKER_01: You know, it's just thoughts that has to be true. First, Georgii is my focus. Like it was before, it was Alex, now it's Georgii. And only then, you know, we start to think about Vitaly. He's my good friend with all due respect, but you have to fight, you have to defend the title. David, do you think, do you think, okay, let me see if I send Georgii the link.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, he said he will be here in two minutes, but he said this four minutes ago. Okay, so it doesn't matter. Okay, does he think that stylistically, Georgii is more or less dangerous than Alex Kurdecha?
SPEAKER_00: Alex... I think Georgii is more of a one-sided guy. I've never seen Georgii fight biceps. Even on YouTube, when I found out I was going to fight him, I saw one fight with Larratt and another guy. He's always fighting through the top. He's one-sided. I think if you find one key to him,
SPEAKER_00: It will be easier to fight with him. Alex Kurdecha was more diverse. He can go up, he can go down. That's the story here.
SPEAKER_01: yeah i think georgie is way more one-dimensional than alex uh when i learned that i will pull him i started to do research and i saw like him pulling devon and other guys and i only see him top rolling i never see him hooking and going inside so if you get one key against him it already gets much easier while alex is way more versatile you know he has more lanes than georgie but david
SPEAKER_02: you like to use your wrist and and alex was going more like side pressure while george swedco is a specialist about top roll don't you think that he is attacking somewhere if he is successful he will be not good for you
SPEAKER_02: Hello, hello, Georgii. How are you? I'm good. Sorry about the wait. I had a problem with the internet. No problem. David just said that he will beat the shit out of you. He will crush you. He said that Georgii Svetkovni is two hands for me. Hi, Daddy Camp. How are you? Good, thank you. How are you? I'm fine.
SPEAKER_01: Engin said that Georgii... Look, Alex is more of a side-presser. And you have a hand-to-hand combat. You still want to turn it around better. And Georgii is a specialist in attacking through the top. And maybe it bothers you that he hits exactly where you need it. Well, if it turns out here...
SPEAKER_00: If my wrist is stronger than his upper hand, I will twist the pronator. If I don't have time, then his upper hand will be stronger than my wrist. If you have more physical strength, then you will be able to do your movement.
SPEAKER_01: You know, this is just pure like top roll versus hook. If I'm strong enough and fast enough, I'll just hook him inside and control his pronator. If he's strong enough, his back pressure will be too much and I will not be able to. It's just who is stronger and who will be able to get his lane. Is it possible, you guys, to turn the phone sideways? Can you turn the camera? Better.
SPEAKER_02: Can you ask David, he said that after the match was set, he said that he watched Gyorgy's matches and he found him one way, pulling.
SPEAKER_01: Can you ask him how many times he has seen somebody controlling Georgii's pronator? David, can you center yourself a little bit?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah, thank you. Yeah, okay. I just saw, I say, I saw one fight, probably, with Georgii on YouTube, I didn't find anything. I say, I wanted to find out with whom, how he fights in general. I don't remember how he fought with his left hand. I once saw how he fought with Lorat, and they were fighting up there. And I had such an opponent in Europe, in the world, we always fought with him, Jordan Soniev.
SPEAKER_00: It was a long time ago, but Jordan won the fight with a hook. He got into the hook and pushed it. He won once.
SPEAKER_01: No, I tried to get as much as possible, but there wasn't a lot of matches. Um, Georgii pulled with Devon on lefty, but it was just top row versus top row and on WAF and Europeans, uh, Jordan, I saw his match with Georgii. Maybe it was a while ago, but still I saw how Jordan got inside and he, he could win against him. And, and, and.
SPEAKER_02: Georgii, I had Krasimir as my guest on podcast and he said that you are in great shape. He thinks that you are going to win by the end runs. He thinks that you are going to win like 3-2. How do you feel lately?
SPEAKER_04: I feel pretty strong in my left arm now and after you told me about the match I stopped training my right because I showed you I had some injury in the right arm after the match with Dave. How is it now? It's better but I have to rest two months. No competitions because this is the life of the doctor.
SPEAKER_04: And my left is pretty strong. I feel very confident with my left. Maybe for years it has not been so strong like now. I beat Safran Krasi very easy, very, very easy. I feel very, very strong. Can I ask you something before Alex Trans says what you said? Before you injured your left arm,
SPEAKER_02: yeah your left and your right was the same level or my right was uh a little stronger but left was more they were very close very close they were very close yeah okay very close
SPEAKER_02: But I had three surgeries and after that, it's not the same. Another question before Alex goes. Like you said, in the last four years, this is the strongest. How close is your left arm to your right arm? Not now, right arm is injured now, but just think about before the Dave Chaffee match.
SPEAKER_04: That shape versus your left arm, is your left arm way behind right arm? No, it's not way behind. It's close but not so close because my right is... Very good. Krasi and Sasho cannot beat me single time round after round on one training. Imagine with right arm what kind of shape I am right now. I mean, left arm is close but not like the right arm. But it's very strong.
SPEAKER_01: Engin was on the stream with Krasi recently. Krasi said that Georgii is in very good shape now. He's very strong, he trains a lot. He thinks that he will win 3-2 in endurance. Georgii said that he trains very well now. His form is improving. He has a very good form on his left hand. I've never been so strong in the last 4 years. Engin asked him how close they are.
SPEAKER_01: Perfect.
SPEAKER_02: Georgii, do you speak, do you understand Russian? Yes, I understand what they say, yeah. I'm not very good at talking, but I understand very well. You understand very well, okay. And Georgii, another question. When you pulled against Devon, it was the warp shape, right? It was like... Yeah, but I had zero training with the left arm. I was preparing only my right arm.
SPEAKER_02: No, no, no. The question I'm going to ask is different right now. At that time, Devon also wasn't really training so much left. But the question is, with left arm, what was your goal? I mean, I know now you need to pull against David, but other than that, do you see yourself a potential with just really giving your left arm your all? Do you see yourself up there?
SPEAKER_04: Engin in Texas type weight with Devon Hunter pull with left arm. Without doing that, he could do nothing to me. You can ask him. So I started training my left arm.
SPEAKER_04: as much as my right. And the way I see how I compete against, how I train against Krasik, who is very strong, South Swiss is very strong with left, and I beat him easily, I think that I can show some good results with my left arm or so. In short, do you have a goal to become the best left arm?
SPEAKER_04: Why not? No, no, no. I just want to hear from you. I'm not saying... Yeah, of course. I'm confident about that because I have very good technique and it's very strong. Basically, you are saying that you're going to hold David and lift him up from the table, right? Not like that, but... Almost. Almost, yeah. Okay. Especially this part translate, Alex. I need to stir the pot. I feel good today.
SPEAKER_01: Engin asked Georgii, how do you feel, what are your goals in this class? Georgii said, well, I feel good because I'm training on the left foot now, because the right form is gaining. I fought Devon in Texas, on the left, and without this, if he didn't leave the table, he couldn't do anything to me. You can ask him, he will confirm. I feel good, so why not?
SPEAKER_01: To be number one, I mean, I'm confident in myself. And against Georgii, or rather, against David, the Georgii goalkeeper, because Tengen asks him, you just lift him up from the table, he said, not so much, but it will be close. Come on, David, say something back. We'll answer something. Yes, I'm very glad that Georgii is so confident.
SPEAKER_00: Everything is getting closer and closer. As a rule, I really like to fight with such big guys. They are heavy, they are interesting. That's the point. They are always big, they are always so confident. They are powerful, big. Therefore, everything is with time, by the will of God.
SPEAKER_01: I like people like this when they're so confident. I like that he's so confident. I like pulling such big people. You know, they're so big, so confident. But, you know, it's getting closer. And with the help of God, everything will come.
SPEAKER_01: I'm just very happy that he's so confident. David, the bigger they are, the harder they fall, right? Of course, of course. So, Gheorghe,
SPEAKER_02: How is your training? With the left arm, do you also lift or you do only table time? You said you pull with Krasimir and Sasho. How often do you guys train? Now we train two times a day, two hours a day.
SPEAKER_04: four hours a day table time and only only table time no lifting okay two hours in the morning and two hours in the evening or two hours at lunch time and two hours now at night okay can i ask you do you guys go full force 90 of the cases full force wow we destroy each other we totally destroy each other and and how long are you gonna rest
SPEAKER_02: six days seven six seven days i think are enough for me david did he said that and this is what the bulgarians do he trains with sasha and krasimir four hours a day at table two hours lunch time two hours in the evening and he they repeat this and do you think
SPEAKER_01: You can do the same, or you would get hurt if you do such an heavy training. And they train like this every day, without rest?
SPEAKER_00: Every day we do it. No rest. Every day. Then I'm sure Georgii will lose if he trains like this. This is too much. You should rest, Georgii.
SPEAKER_00: I train three times a week, around three or four hours. More than that, I'm not sure I will be able to because of my work, but this is just too much.
SPEAKER_00: And how often do you do table training? David? How often do you stand at the table? Well, I fight once a week. But after each training session, I can just work out with rubber bands or with an opponent. But it's a fight, just to fight. Well, once a week, maybe two times a week, and that's it. Once you fight well, I just can't imagine how they fight. Once you fight well, your hands hurt, you already have some injuries. I can't imagine.
SPEAKER_00: But I can say that I can do it 100%. I don't even have that at all. I work more with iron, on handles or on a strap.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe once a week, if you go like full table training. After a regular training, I can go to a table with bands or like just technique, you know, technique. But going this hard, I don't know how they do it because one good session and already your arms hurt, you know, you get some pain in the arms. Yeah, Bulgarians do that. Allen of them do that. Yeah. And David, like,
SPEAKER_02: We talked this before, but I want to ask again, like, how come you have such a strong hand and wrist? Is it, is it, you think it's all because of the judo? Or is it also genetic, your genetic?
SPEAKER_01: Oh, it's for David, yeah. I thought for Georgii for some reason. Well, Judo didn't stay strong. Yeah, hands and wrists are genetics. Maybe Judo somehow helped. How do you feel? Well, I think she has good genetics. Especially...
SPEAKER_00: My father is also healthy. He also did weightlifting. Everyone is healthy. There are no skinny people. I think I did judo for 10 years. My crown movement was on the left side of the bar. I was twisting myself all the time. It was a kind of a crown movement. It looked like I was doing 500 reps on the same workout. I did it because of the kimono.
SPEAKER_00: He got better and better over the years. I had to add some specialization and I was able to get into the world of armwrestling. I think it's genetics, but judo helped me a lot in armwrestling.
SPEAKER_01: No, I think it's some genetics as well, because my father was pretty big. Everyone in my family is pretty large. We don't have like skinny people. I think it's judo. I had a very good move like left stand. I was working with my left arm, you know, like bending my wrist and doing this move.
SPEAKER_01: and imagine doing this like 500 reps and it's just so much work for 10 years i think it's i just got that movement so much that when i translated to arm wrestling i did only some um specialized training and it already i got very good at it yeah when i have students wrestlers and the judo guys you know when they quit judo and wrestling and they come to arm wrestling they are they were the ones that did very well compared to the other kids you know yeah
SPEAKER_01: Yes, when I had students who came from judo to armwrestling, they immediately got this base. Yes, you pull yourself to yourself when you are strong. Everything to yourself. Yes, yes, yes. Well, it's not enough to fight with the top, everything is hook, hook, they climb. Usually people come to the table and they pull in a hook. Not really often people top roll, they hook, so yeah. Yeah, and David, one more question for you. You said that
SPEAKER_02: Gyorgy is a one-way puller and you said if you hook you're gonna win and if he takes your wrist and he's gonna win do you have another game plan like also another question is that do you consider yourself hook puller or or more side pressure
SPEAKER_01: Two questions, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: I think it's not a secret. Georgii knows that I fight with a hook, he fights with a hook. I understand that he will pull me, I will go there. It's all clear to everyone. There's nothing to hide. Maybe there will be some tricks during the fight, who will stretch a little. But in general, globally, we understand how we will fight each other.
SPEAKER_00: Do you have any other plans to fight differently? To be honest, I won't lie. I did my best, but I did it even harder.
SPEAKER_00: And that's it. What was the second question? I forgot. How do you see yourself? As a hooker or as someone who fights on the side? I think I like it more as a hooker. If I can't do it, I have to push on the side. But when I was a junior, I always went deep there.
SPEAKER_01: You know, for Georgii, I don't think it's a big secret. He's a top roller. I'm a hook puller. We both know where we're going to pull. I'm not going to lie. I don't really have a different plan. I just get my strong movement as good as I can and I prepare it. I'll try to hook.
SPEAKER_01: i try to get as deep as possible georgie tries to top roll me you know it's not a secret um for myself i think i'm a hook puller because even when i was in juniors uh when i was starting i always liked to get yeah but lately in the east versus west he is also moving the yeah yeah so he said like i want to get as close as possible that's my goal i like to get here but if i don't i just i go sideways uh-huh now if i don't get the position then i just
SPEAKER_02: Okay, so if you cannot hook, Georgii, no way to, no possibility for toproll, huh? He said, maybe I'll toproll him as well. Like, I don't know, why are you, like, hurrying me and Georgii?
SPEAKER_00: you like it's all gonna come you know but
SPEAKER_00: That's what I like. When the opponent is strong, you put yourself into full strength. And thank God, it turned out that Hutchings won his strong side. And that's all cool. I'm very glad that Georgii is such a strong athlete. I like it. I don't want any fights to be easy. So I want to fight. Moreover, his strong side. Why not? I don't just train the hook, I also train the top. So I just want to fight and that's it.
SPEAKER_01: You probably remember as well when I had the match against Todd, people all said like, no way, it's Todd Hutchings, you know, especially in a hook lane, there's no way you can hold against him. But thank God, you know, everything turned out great. And I love pulling against such strong people, especially with Georgii, you know, his strong lane. I go against his strong lane. It's so interesting for me.
SPEAKER_02: No, I love it. I love to go full force when your opponent is so strong. You go as hard as possible yourself. More motivating, you know. Okay. Georgii, I asked before you came, I asked David, I said, stylistically, which one is more dangerous for you? Alex Kurdecha or Georgii Svetkov? He said...
SPEAKER_02: What I understood, if I'm wrong, you can correct me, Alex. What I understood that he thought that Alex is more dangerous because he is more well-rounded while you are one way puller. But just because you are one way pulling, sometimes it may be more dangerous than being versatile because sometimes versatile people can pull everything.
SPEAKER_02: just say 85%, 90%, 85% while a full force specialist can do 100% one thing and it may be
SPEAKER_02: dangerous and we know that David is someone who is using risks. So his opponent needs to make sure that he doesn't have the coping and you are attacking exactly there. You are a specialist. So do you agree with him that Alex being stylistically more dangerous for him than you? I don't agree because in hook I think that David is one of the strongest in the world and for me the only way
SPEAKER_04: To beat him is to crack his wrist. And Alex is not specialist in that. He is just big guy and he cannot control very good the game. And you saw that in hook, David beat him.
SPEAKER_04: I think David would beat you in hook as well. Yes, but here I am much stronger and I much more understand the game. So, you are basically saying that it is harder to hook you than hooking Kurdecha? Yes, of course. I think that this is the only way I can beat David, to crack his wrist. Ford me, it's not possible to beat him in hook.
SPEAKER_04: yeah yeah and i think that this is what alex should try but he was not able to to do that yeah alex just with left arm he's more confident he just curves and you know tries to go yeah but you saw a hook david just yeah yeah i i talked with alex i i i also told alex that alex needs to work more on
SPEAKER_02: making sure that he's not hooked because two times he pulled, Morozov and Davide both went inside. I think that Kurdecha with left arm is much better against the top roller. But, you know, it doesn't mean that he's unbeatable, but I'm sure that he's better. But if he works more on pronation... He has the same problems on right arm. He saw his match with Jerry. He couldn't do well against Jerry also.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but it was a different style. With right arm, I think he is more of a top of specialist with right arm. With left arm, he is more going sideways. I think because he is stronger, he feels comfortable and confident. This is how I see it. So basically you disagree with David and you are going to teach him something new. I think that...
SPEAKER_04: if my plan is going to work it will be a nightmare for david stay again if my plan for the game works in my way it will be very bad night for david okay but what is the possibility your plan to work according to you honestly 50 50.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, 50-50. You see the match 50-50? Yes, yes. Oh, okay. I was hoping for something more provocative. No, but I think the time is close. I think the time is very close.
SPEAKER_02: doing this. Okay, so 50%, 50%. And ask David, you know, say that Georgii disagree with him about that Kurdecha's style could be more dangerous. And he thinks that it is 50-50 chance. And you can also ask David how he sees his chance. I'm hoping him to answer in a provocative way, but let's see.
SPEAKER_01: Have they discussed who is more dangerous, Georgii or Alex? Alex has a problem that he fights everywhere, but he fights everywhere. 80% here, 80% up. And Georgii has at least one line, but it's 100% up, he's a specialist in it. And this is more dangerous for you than a hooker, because Georgii himself said that, as for me, you are one of the strongest hookers in the world and you will be defeated there.
SPEAKER_01: It's almost impossible. And I'm the same. If you screw me up, I don't think I'll win. I need to beat you up. Engin asks him, what chances do you see for this match? He says, I have a plan. If it works this night, this 50-50 plan, we'll see how it works, it will be a very bad night for you.
SPEAKER_01: What do you think about that? And Enge asks, what's your plan? What are your chances for this match? And he really hopes that your answer will be provocative.
SPEAKER_00: Well, everyone has their own opinion. I respect Georgii. He's a very strong guy. That's why I want to fight with him. I agreed. It's God's will. I can't say who has more or less. I know I'm going to win. I'm sure it's God's will.
SPEAKER_00: To be honest, I had a good training camp. I did everything I wanted to do. After Alex, I progressed even more. Every training is getting better and better. I'm sure I'll do my job. I'm sure everything will work out.
SPEAKER_00: No.
SPEAKER_01: He's very strong. I like it that he's confident. I'm sure that with God's grace, I will come there. I train to win. And I'm sure that with the help of God, everything will go the way it should be. I'm not going to say all the percentages go ahead of time. I know that I train really hard. I go there to win. It's been a second time that I don't cut my weight.
SPEAKER_01: I feel great. I eat good, I sleep good, I train well. I had a very good training preparation. And I just... I'm very confident now. I like it. Yeah, from now on, I think the lowest category we will see is under 15, right, David? Yes, the lowest category for you is 115 now. Yes, of course, 105. Well, I can't even win with everything. I don't even want to win. I don't want to.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, for sure. I can't and I don't want to make 105 anymore. Too much. And one more question and then we can go to the predictions. David, there is Devon, there is Alijan, there is Reno, there is Ivan Matyshenko in 115kg.
SPEAKER_01: Between those athletes where do you see yourself ranked?
SPEAKER_00: Probably, I would like to fight with the first number. If it was Matyushenko, then it would be Matyushenko. If it was Alizhan, then it would be Alizhan. It doesn't matter who, but I want to fight with the first number. Since it's Alizhan, then I will fight with Alizhan. And I think I deserved this fight. God willing, of course, everything will go fine in these fights.
SPEAKER_00: I would like to fight for the world champion title in the 115th category. Here is the first number of the competition. You see, he had a post there, but he couldn't fight now. If he continues to prepare, I will fight with him.
SPEAKER_01: No, I just want to pull the number one. Should it be Matyushenko? It can be Matyushenko because it's Alezhan right now. I will pull Alezhan right now. I think I deserve a match with the number one and I'm just going to train. Everything is looking good, so I'm just trying to pull the number one. And what if Alezhan thinks that he doesn't deserve the title match? What if Alezhan thinks that you don't deserve the title match?
SPEAKER_01: Okay, then defend the title against a different athlete, but against who? Matyushenko already lost. If he wants Devon, sure, let Devon pull Alijan.
SPEAKER_00: If I don't deserve it, then... No, I don't think Alijan would think or say that. But even if he did, sure, let's pull in super heavyweights then. What's the problem?
SPEAKER_02: Maybe I shouldn't say that, but I think he thinks that way. He doesn't say that way, but he says that David Dadikian needs to pull someone in 115 kg before the title match. Maybe I shouldn't say that, but I think he thinks that way because he said that Dadikian in 115 kg should first fight someone before fighting for the title.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, let him defend his title too. But why hasn't he defended his title for so long? I remember that Larratt had 115th right hand. He didn't defend it. Why hasn't he defended his title?
SPEAKER_01: No, okay, if we go that way, why does Alijan doesn't defend his title for so long? Devon in 1.15 got stripped of his title when he didn't defend it for so long. Say again, say again? Oh, you mean the 1.05 title? The 1.15. He just pulled Ivan Matushenko on in November.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, but he just fought Matyushenko in November. He won Matyushenko's belt, right? Can you defend it? Yeah, but he should defend it though, no?
SPEAKER_00: Matyushenko won. Rino has injuries. If I'm not mistaken, Zia and Prudnik are at the bottom. Who do you want to defend against? Let's say he doesn't deserve it. Who do you want to defend against? Let him fight with Larratt. He's a famous athlete.
SPEAKER_02: He's just saying that if I don't deserve to pull against him and Aljan defends Israel, then against who? He just won against Matyushenko, then there's... No, no, no. He says maybe he would pull Dadikyan. But Dadikyan needs to pull someone to prove, like, Matyushenko beat Reno and Aljan beat Matyushenko. So maybe Aljan is thinking that Dadikyan needs to beat Reno or...
SPEAKER_01: Devon or Matyushenko, and then if he wins, then pull against Alijan. I think. That's what I understand. OK then, let Alijan decide, and we'll just do the way he did.
SPEAKER_02: But for sure, David wouldn't pull Devon? Ford sure. We're back to that story again. Yeah, okay, never mind. Let's go to the predictions. Let's start with Georgii Svetko. Georgii, do you think
SPEAKER_02: You are the best top roller, like about top rolling specialist, like hardest guy to be hooked. Do you think? In my opinion, yes. Yes. Yes? Yeah. Uh-huh. Alex, was it, was it, was it Georgii Swetko that Ermes was saying that it is impossible for Swetko to beat Michael Todd?
SPEAKER_02: He would put his house, you remember? Was it Georgii? On Ermes podcast, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think, yeah. Do you agree with that? I don't remember. Georgii, do you agree with that? I will put my house that I will beat Ermes. Tell him that. How about Michael? I think that I will beat him. Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Listen, look at how many more matches that we have to... Engin, I'm evolving. I'm evolving, my friend. What's that? I'm evolving, improving myself. Yeah, for sure. Yeah. Better, because everything is going up. Okay, let's start. Zurab Tavber is the Gyorgy Tautier. Gyorgy. Close match, but I think that Zurab will beat him without list.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, really? Yes. But he will lose his wrist and then he will go like this? Yes, yes. Long, exhausting match, but Zurab will beat him. And David? How do you see the match, man? Well, yes, I also think that Zurab... Well, it depends on how you do your business. If Zurab pushes, well, yes. Zurab is now lifting some kind of space weights, I see. Therefore, Zurab...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I agree. Maybe like if Zurab can finish the match, I watch his videos and he lifts some crazy weights. So probably I go with Zurab. Okay. And Petro Marharin's luck in Adair? I think Petro will take the win. How difficult? It will be not easy, but
SPEAKER_04: Were you surprised when Lachlan troubled Krasimir? I was surprised but I think that in this time Krasimir was not in very good shape. But I think that Petro is more experienced and with bigger hands and his wrist cupping is much stronger.
SPEAKER_02: Were you impressed by his win at the Moldova 2018? Yes, he was very strong. Amazing, huh? Yeah. And David? Petro is going to win. David, what do you think about Petro? Do you think that he has a chance to win one of five categories?
SPEAKER_00: Larratt? Yes, I think so. He has a very wide arm. I fought with him a long time ago in Europe. He is a very uncomfortable athlete. I don't know what he lacks to fight with feet, but he is a very strong guy.
SPEAKER_01: no it's devon right now so maybe yes his hand is just so thick and big it's crazy i pulled him a while back but i remember his hand is very good i'm not sure what he's lacking but yeah he can if he works he's very good there's a possibility of things yeah okay
SPEAKER_04: Nugo Shikadze, Matt Mask. You were there in Arlington with Matt Mask. Were you impressed by his win against Ungar Bayev? I said that Matt Mask will beat him in the end. I was right. And how about this time? I think that he will beat him. Because I played against Nugo in Dubai. In hook, he is strong. But top row, no way.
SPEAKER_02: Do you think Matt has the top role like you do? Not like me, but he will not be a comfortable rival for him. Some people say that Matt can take Nugo's wrist, Nugo can still win, but I don't remember Nugo performing so great with that wrist. But some people say that because he has very...
SPEAKER_04: Heavy passing power in a chest way, in a shoulder way. Engin, Ungarbaev beat Kurt Eche years ago without wrist but he couldn't do this now against Matt. So I don't think that Nugo is capable of doing this. So I think Matt will beat him.
SPEAKER_00: Confident. And David? I think he will win. He did a great job with Sangarbaev. But if he doesn't let the Georgii get into the hook... I think he will do the same with Sangarbaev and the Georgii.
SPEAKER_01: I think Matt, I saw how he pulls against Ungerbaev. It was impressive. He shouldn't let Nugo go inside. And I think he should do exactly the same thing that he did against Ungerbaev. Pulled all the same way. Yeah, Nugo, David, he's not a hook puller. Nugo is also...
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, but he's just so uncomfortable. His levers are so long. I don't know how he's down in 105 with those crazy fingers. And it's very uncomfortable to pull against him.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, let's go to the next one. You were there in Arlington, you saw Jocelyn. Yes. And now pulling against a legend, one of the gods of female armwrestling, Egle. I think Jocelyn is very strong but
SPEAKER_04: I think that Egle will beat her and she has much way bigger experience and I think that she's stronger. You think Egle is stronger? Yes, yes. In my opinion. Yeah. It will be a good match but... So you are saying that Egle is going to find a way to win? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Way more experienced. Oh no, there is no doubt. No doubt, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: David, do you know Jocelyn? Do you know Sarah Beckman in Arlington?
SPEAKER_00: Who is she fighting? Latvian? Egle. Egle Vaidkuta. Egle Vaidkuta from Lithuania. Interesting. But I think this girl from America will lose. She will win. Latvian. It's interesting, but I think Egle is going to win. Hmm. Okay. She's like unbeatable. Oh, okay. Um...
SPEAKER_01: 50-50. I'm not kidding. This is my honest prediction. I'm rooting for Georgii. Okay, let's go to the next one.
SPEAKER_02: Your future opponents, Kamil Jablonski versus Gyorgy Dzeranov? Dzeranov. Dzeranov? Yes. You both think Dzeranov? Yes. Dzeranov is well-rounded, very fast, very strong. And how is he going to win, in hook?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, he will beat him in hook. And David in with fire. If I'm not mistaken, he fights well in the top. Yes, he's still fast. I don't know how he will fight, the main thing is to stretch him, Camille, from the shoulder, a little stretch, open this angle, the opposite, and it will be better, and he will win.
SPEAKER_01: I don't really know how he's going to pull against Kamil because he's pretty versatile. But I would say he only needs one thing. Just make Kamil go away from his shoulder, stretch the ankle just a bit, and it's going to get much easier. David, do you think that it is possible for Georgii to toproll and beat Kamil?
SPEAKER_00: Yes, yes, yes. The main thing is not to let him get into the technique with his shoulder. If there is a judgment, he will clearly judge. Devon't let him fall with his shoulder there. Why not? Shake that side a little bit.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I think, yeah, if he's a good setup, if everything is cleaned, if everything is wrapped cleanly and he doesn't get his shoulder in too much and Gheorghe stretches him back, yeah, for sure. Why not? Okay, Gheorghe, Pauline versus David Samusha. This will be a crazy match. And I think that Samusha will win.
SPEAKER_04: Close match or dominance? Close match but the experience and the endurance of Samusha and his skills on the table are much better and I think that this will help him to win. Were you surprised when he beat Sasho? Yes, it was a crazy match again and because we were training with Sasho and I knew that
SPEAKER_04: He is in very good shape and I couldn't believe that somebody can beat him on the same weight. And David? Pauline vs Samusha? I think if Samusha gained at least 95 kg,
SPEAKER_00: There is a good chance that he will win, but if he doesn't gain weight, I think it will be very difficult for him.
SPEAKER_01: I think if he's 95 if he really gains weight then good chances but if he's 90 or like around that too light he's gonna have a lot of problems in those lighter weight classes it matters a lot because they are pretty close so if both 95 kilo Samusha has more chance if he is 90 kilo then
SPEAKER_01: Well, if they are 95 kg, Samusha has more chances. Yes, of course. Well, Alex, it's not a plus category for the 115th athlete to rise to the plus and win the heavyweights, you know? It's an easy category. Yeah. No, it's not like in 1.15 when you get even more weight and you go against heavier guys. It's lighter weight. Everyone is close. So he's saying if Samusha is 90 kg, Paul has more chances and they're all close matches.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah. In 95, he has more chances. In 90, Samusha will have more problems.
SPEAKER_00: Yes, I'm trying to understand the more problems part. It's tougher. Well, look, the more problems you say, the more difficult the match will be, if he's 90 and lighter. But he'll lose then, if he's lighter. Well, yes, because I'm talking about the categories. If he's 75, 85, he doesn't have enough weight. But in these categories, weight really matters, it seems to me.
SPEAKER_00: 85-95 kg is the average weight category. I think a couple of kilos really affects them a lot. That's why it's better to gain weight and then change the category. If you used to be 85-95 kg, now you're 95-95 kg. It's more or less normal. You can't lose weight, I think. Look at Georgii's belly. Look at his belly.
SPEAKER_01: okay he like in lighter weight classes i think it matters a lot when you're underweight i think it's very important to be at the weight cap uh rather than like in super heavyweights a couple kilograms there it doesn't matter as much in like let's say 85 pulls a 95 guy it really matters how much the 85 guy gains weight even even two kilograms it can matter i think in a weight class and then he said look at georgie look at how big his stomach is like look at him
SPEAKER_02: He's trying to scare him with his stomach. I think Ivan will beat him. Hook him and beat him. Do you think that Sergei will try to topple him or Sergei will go inside?
SPEAKER_04: I don't think that Sergei can beat him inside. You don't think? No, I think that he will try to top-roll, but at this weight, Ivan is very strong, very dangerous.
SPEAKER_00: I think he will beat him. And David? I think Kalina is in good shape now. Maybe Kalina will be able to stretch with her upper movement and not let Matyushenko climb where he is used to. I bet more on Kalinchenko.
SPEAKER_01: You know, I think Kalina is in a very good shape. I think with his back pressure, with outside move, he can stretch out Matyushenko and don't let him what he wants to. So, I think, like, I'm swaying more to Kalina. That's interesting. That's interesting. Okay, let's go to a great match for me. Big match. Artur Makaro versus Daniel Prokofiev.
SPEAKER_04: I think that Daniel will beat him. In which way? Maybe he will go sideways and something a little top row. I don't know. But close match, crazy match, but Daniel will beat him, I think.
SPEAKER_00: And David? If Artur is in good shape, I think Artur will win. I think if Artur is in good shape and he's prepared very well, I think he's going to win. If the match goes inside, who is winning?
SPEAKER_00: And if Daniel tries to toproll, is it possible to take Artur's list or Artur will hook him?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I think that's where Arthur can have some problems because if Prokopchuk setups without his riser like low handing, Arthur will have problems to cut him inside. It's very tough to get him inside when he's like this. Yeah, Minda Agbas couldn't top roll Arthur.
SPEAKER_01: Every time Artur put him in hook, but we will see.
SPEAKER_01: Mindaugas, yes, he is so resilient, he stretches, he holds, but Prokopchuk, it seems to me, he is stronger. Mindaugas, I think, is more like he holds very long, like stretching up for endurance. I think Prokopchuk is more of like a strength athlete. He's like hitting, you know, more. Okay. Gennady Kvikvinie versus Ibrahim Sago. 115 kilos.
SPEAKER_02: interim world title match because Reno is injured. Reno is still champion but he will wait and there is an interim temporary world title. I think that Gennady will beat him. Even in 115 kilos? Yes, even that he has to remove weight. I think that he is stronger, more well-rounded, more experienced. He is very dangerous and he will beat him.
SPEAKER_00: I saw Sagov, he gained weight very well, he does very cool things, but if you just observe how Gennady fought,
SPEAKER_00: I think Ibrahim won't be able to compete with Larratt. I wonder if Ibrahim will be able to compete with Ibrahim or Gena's experience will be better.
SPEAKER_01: I look at Sagov, he lifts some incredible weights, he works really hard. Gennady, he pulled a little bit Devon. He got some stops on him, he had some good positions. I don't think Sagov can do that, what Gennady did against Devon. And the question is, the weights that Sagov is lifting, will they work against Gennady? And if Gennady's experience on the table will matter as well.
SPEAKER_01: What does he think about the weight loss? Does it affect? I think Gennady has enough weight.
SPEAKER_00: I don't think it's going to hurt anyone. I think Ibrahim is going to do it because he weighs 125 kilos. Gena is going to do it. Plus or minus, they are in equal conditions. If Gena does well, he will do it.
SPEAKER_01: I think Gennady has enough excess weight that he can cut down. They both need to cut. Sagov is like 125, I think I saw. They both need to cut anyway. I think they are in equal terms around that. If Gennady preps well, he gets into the weight cut, I think he's going to do it. Okay. And...
SPEAKER_02: Great match. Ruslan Babaev vs. Tata Sing's 95 kilo right arm world title match. East vs. West world title match. Can I ask you something, Gyorgy? Yeah. Has there been any time in armwrestling history to win a world title as hard as winning an East vs. West world title?
SPEAKER_04: No, no, never. Never. Yeah, we did this all together. The level is crazy. Yes. Okay, what's your opinion? Well, before Rustam beat him in 2017, but now I think that Toti is way stronger and I think that he will beat him.
SPEAKER_02: Can I ask you something? How is he going to beat him? Like with the same style or in hook? Is it possible to talk to top role Rusev?
SPEAKER_04: No, I think that Tote cannot top Rostam because Rostam is one of the strongest hookers. And then, how is it going to go then? If he cannot top, he's going to beat him in hook? Inside, in hook, not easy, but he will beat him. I think that Tote is unstoppable now. He's very strong. The way he beat Terapi, he's very dangerous, very strong. Okay.
SPEAKER_00: And let's go to David. I don't know. I don't know. Maybe Hutchings will win. I think so. Maybe I even want to. I'm impressed and I follow him. I like him as an athlete. With all due respect to Rustam. But I'll bet on my grandfather.
SPEAKER_01: no i think uh todd's gonna win i want him to win too with all due respect to rostam i really like todd i i watch him closely i follow him um so i'm gonna bet on the uncle and then todd hudson is the only guy that makes makes uh david smile right
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, you know, we had a great match. I loved it. Only positive memories about that match. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And match of the night. Vitaly Laletin versus Michael Todd. Georgii, let's start. I think that Michael will beat him. Michael will beat him? Long, exhausting match, but...
SPEAKER_02: I don't think that Vitaly can finish Michael. It will be a crazy match, but in my opinion, Michael will beat him. When I said this match, the general perception was Vitaly 90%, Michael 10%.
SPEAKER_02: I asked the athletes during the podcast, and now the perception is very close because the community sees. At the beginning when I said it may be a very hard match, they said, oh, you're trying to hype the match. And then more of the other athletes also share their opinion. And then some of the new fans probably, they finally understand that Michael Todd,
SPEAKER_04: He's a very dangerous fuller. Very dangerous. Again, Vitaly couldn't beat Dave in strap. Imagine in strap battle, seven rounds against Michael. Five rounds. It's not the title match. Five rounds. It's great. It's exhausting. It's nightmare to have five rounds in strap with Michael.
SPEAKER_02: I mean, there are some differences. Like for example, Vitaly is very good off the start, but Dave is also known with his incredible center. So that he neutralized Vitaly's starts.
SPEAKER_02: And while Michael has more, so not at the center, but more right here somewhere is good, different. But of course, Michael is also very dangerous, you know, about the defensive style. But I also think that Vitaly today is much stronger than the first time he pulled Dave Sheffield. The second match he beat him, but the first match he lost. Yeah, but the second match Dave tried to strap and you saw what happened.
SPEAKER_02: I asked that to Vitaly. Vitaly said that he allowed Dave to come through. You don't believe it? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, I don't know. I don't know. I only ask. I can't call anyone lying or something. But yeah, I see that you see it as an excuse. But yeah. So there is no possibility, in your opinion, Vitaly to flash pin Michael? No.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, so you are saying that if you had money, if you were a betting guy, you would bet on Michael? On Michael, yes. Yeah. Look, I don't understand. I will ask you as well, you know. Why community takes Michael lightly? Because... Do they not realize? You think they don't realize? They don't realize how the real game will be, you know, the real match is going to be.
SPEAKER_02: They don't realize how much suffering his opponents are having, right? Yes. And now he's really huge. His arms and everything. I saw him in Tbilisi. I think David also remembers that Michael was really big in Tbilisi. Listen, Engin. The match between Ermes and Michael was very close.
SPEAKER_02: listen listen listen don't say that don't say that these people are going to attack you they will say no no no they will they will tell you they will tell you you are crazy michael was if the match was a little more go longer big problem for elmas but listen i said that one time i said it was close
SPEAKER_02: And then people said, oh, you don't know, you don't know. It wasn't my opinion. I don't care. This is my opinion. Listen, listen, listen. Even Ermes himself said that it was very close. People see Ermes in control, they think it's easy. Ermes did everything perfectly, perfectly. One mistake, Ermes would lose that match. Yeah, but Vittarri doesn't have this weapon which Ermes has.
SPEAKER_02: I know you're friends with Vitaly, but if you look at it objectively, what do you think will happen?
SPEAKER_00: Maybe it will be the same as with Morozov. Maybe it will be the same as with Morozov. But if he catches the ball and Vitaly gets a little bit of the ball, it will be problematic.
SPEAKER_00: We all know that he can hold on and take a lot of energy from his opponents. But, as Ermes showed, you have to fight correctly. If Vitaly takes the right tactics, even if he stops him,
SPEAKER_00: It's not a problem for him to get into the triceps. He's never been that heavy. I've seen him and talked to him. He's 150 plus now. He's become so big.
SPEAKER_01: know very long levers very strong maybe not like flash pins like let's say like with morozov like morozov said like flash pins but still vital is very good very strong michael we all know he stops so hard here he drains his opponent so hard he can hold forever but still i think if vitality works
SPEAKER_01: correctly when he hits his wrist may go and start to bend it can create problems but i think if vidali works correctly and he transitions to the triceps without mistakes ermys showed us how to do that he did it perfectly i think if it does everything correctly he has good chances i just never seen him so big he weighs like 150 even more i never seen him so huge and strong
SPEAKER_02: Okay, Michael Merck says, Ermes wasn't ever close to being pinned in that match though. Yes, it wasn't. But that is how it works. Once you can't pin Michael, and then you finish. Like you don't, when you pull Michael, you don't lose Michael in a losing position. The problem starts when you're trying to pin.
SPEAKER_02: pin, trying to pin again, and then you get exhausted, exhausted, and then you lose the match. So that is why Ermes won, you know, because he was able to finish. But the finishing was like very risky finishing, you know. Anyway, so, and then let's do the last one. And then let's finish. Ermes Gasparini versus Levan Levan Saginashvili in June.
SPEAKER_02: Ermes is very confident. Levan is also confident. Levan is thinking probably that Ermes is lifting incredible weights because he doesn't believe that those are real weights. And then Ermes thinks that Levan is in trouble because if he thinks that those weights are unreal, he says he is really lifting them. What do you think, Georgii? I think that if you have a good match,
SPEAKER_02: Levan will beat him. Levan will beat him? Yes. But when you say that it will be a good match, like good match means that he's not going to dominate but still win? He will not dominate. I think that it will be one, two, three hits, but he will beat him. Ah, okay. Yeah, I mean that it will be not a fresh win match. So you are saying that he won't be in a danger of losing any rounds? No. I think it will be a confident win for Levan, my opinion.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, and David?
SPEAKER_00: I've watched a lot of videos, but I can't see anything from Levan. I think Levan is a favorite, but it's going to be very interesting. Looking at how Ermes is doing, Levan is in the shadows. He doesn't show what to expect. I can't evaluate him objectively. We're just waiting.
SPEAKER_01: You know, I look at Ermes, he posts videos with some insane weights, and Levan just quietly doesn't post anything. I think, of course, Levan's the favorite, but I'm not really sure how to predict that match, because Ermes is showing his preparations, I see how he's getting better and stronger, and Levan's just in the shadows, quietly getting better, so I'm not so sure.
SPEAKER_02: David, how do you rate Ermes as an armwrestler? About his armwrestling ability and his knowledge, intelligence at the table.
SPEAKER_00: Ermes is a good fighter. He fights well. He is good tactically. He fought with Michael confidently and calmly.
SPEAKER_00: I think he was more of a loser. He couldn't force himself to fight. Of course, he's a professional. He's very cool. But it depends on your opponent how mentally ready you are.
SPEAKER_01: You know, obviously, he's very good, he's versatile. Against Michael, he showed perfect arm wrestling. Calm, not worried about anything, showed perfect technique in all transitions. But on the other hand, he had a match with Devon when he was so lost and he just couldn't even get his arm wrestling lanes in. He couldn't do what he wanted to. So I think it really matters, like...
SPEAKER_02: mentally how are you prepared and it matters who your opponent is but of course or miss is very good oh okay one more question then then if Devon and Ermes pull again does he expect the same outcome or do you think there is a possibility for a different outcome
SPEAKER_00: It all depends on your mentality. Ford example, when Gena was fighting with Larratt, Gena didn't understand anything in English. Larratt kept talking and talking and talking. Gena didn't understand it. He didn't care. He kept fighting and fighting.
SPEAKER_00: I think that when Tsvetkov and Georgii talk about it, it distracts you mentally. Yes, yes. It changes you a lot. And I think that it was hard for Ermes to get mentally ready. Larratt was able to beat Ermes with his psychological pressure.
SPEAKER_01: I think it all depends on how he prepares mentally. Because Georgii wouldn't let me lie. When you pull and when he talks and talks and talks and talks to you, it gets distracting. You get distracted, you get tired of it. On the other hand, Gennady.
SPEAKER_01: He doesn't understand English. He sees Devon talking, talking, talking, talking, but he doesn't understand anything. He just keeps pushing, pushing, pushing and going hard. So I think it's not really about power. It's about how Ermes prepares mentally if he doesn't let Devon distract him out of his strong lanes again.
SPEAKER_00: You know, when I was there and I was watching it, Ermes and Devon, the first match, it just looked like Ermes was, oh, when is this going to be over, I just want to go home, you know, it looked like this to me.
SPEAKER_02: he was just so tired of it yeah but maybe maybe maybe it was because of what like maybe Devon also made him feel that on that
SPEAKER_00: Maybe that was the reason. Maybe that day Devon was so strong that... Yes, I don't exclude Devon. The athlete who proves and shows his real level is, to be honest, not like us. We fought 2-3 times a year and that's it. That year he fought 9 or 10 times. It's the highest level. So it's professionalism, of course. He was strong and physical.
SPEAKER_01: That's why he controlled his wrist. Yes, I agree. You know, obviously, I agree, Devon is a professional. He's not even like us, you know, two, three times a year we pull. That year he pulled, like, what, ten matches? It's just crazy. Obviously, he's very strong, he's very good, he controls the wrist so much. I don't deny that. Of course, Devon's very good. Okay, so let's finish and then...
SPEAKER_02: Do you have any last words, Georgii, besides lifting David's arm from the pad? I want to tell you that I am very excited about this fight. Ford me, David is an amazing puller and he is a very good guy.
SPEAKER_04: And it will be a very good feeling if I beat him for me, to beat one of the best left arm.
SPEAKER_01: I want to say that it's an honor for me to face him.
SPEAKER_00: Yes, good luck to both of us. God's will, Christ's will. It's not a secret that I don't like negative things. But respect for each other is the best thing. It's not UFC. Dirty trash talk is not welcome here. It's a civil sport.
SPEAKER_01: you know it's all mutual georgie i feel all the same about you uh with god's will of course everything uh i just don't like the you know all the negativity it's not ufc it's not trash i mean i like being positive being respectful yeah i mean it's a change it is changing from open and open and open yeah
SPEAKER_02: I didn't like it. You don't like it. I know you don't like it. No, no, I like it. I like it. Even when I try to hype certain pot, I do it in good spirit, not mad. You know, I have some characters in my head, and when we pull, Dan is going to be very hard. What do you mean?
SPEAKER_02: like uh when the arm wrestling comes you know when we pull yeah some characters then it's gonna be hard then it's gonna be yeah and and then georgie will not be smiling anyways thank you very very much david see you in istanbul in 10 days and not 10 days one week and then see you georgie
SPEAKER_02: Have a safe travel, both of you. And Alex, thank you for translation. As always, you do a great job. And thank you, guys. Thanks to everyone who has watched us. And anything you want to say, David? Did you want to say something? I saw that, can Russian athletes compete at the qualifications?
SPEAKER_02: We are talking about it, we are talking about it, but it's not... Like, David, it's just like a neutral, without representing, it may be possible, but we haven't decided yet.
SPEAKER_00: I was just interested because a lot of people, it was a lot of talking about it and can anyone compete?
SPEAKER_02: no no no not anyone copy we will we will inform david we will inform okay thank you thank you very much bye bye
