SPEAKER_03: Hello, hello, Roman. Can you check if we are live? Ah, I'm going to check. Hey, we have the same jerseys. Yeah, yeah. Okay, let me check it real quick. Yes, I think we are live now. Yeah. And how are you, Roman?
SPEAKER_01: I'm doing very fine and I'm really amazed how last KOTT turned out to be. It's always a pleasure for me to be somewhat part of it. I was just telling with Irakli right now, I think there was one of the very few events when I was there and he wasn't. And how are you Irakli?
SPEAKER_03: very good very good yes how is how is how is your car doing your car was m5 right m4 or m5 five five five yeah yeah what is it now 850 horsepower oh yes i love it i love it he says you are welcome to go back in georgia again and uh you will get the ride no i i can't come to georgia but i will never ever ride in his car again
SPEAKER_03: I almost broke my neck, you know. He took me from hotel. Yeah. I was looking at my phone and the next thing Roman, I was like this. Like this. Anyway, so... Sorry brother, Ermes is in the chat and he says, Bambino, are you ready for clean table and put mask on Levan?
SPEAKER_00: Do you want to join? Go ahead directly.
SPEAKER_01: Ermes, my friend, Bambino, you're actually saying that for sure he gives you his word. He gives you a promise. He promises that he will help you to clean the table with your tears. No problem. No, no, thanks. I wasn't on my phone when he was drifting. He took me from hotel.
SPEAKER_03: And I thought we were going to go calmly. We were going to go for my neck massage. David did the massage. And then the next thing, like, I was like, you know, my head almost hit the top, you know, and he just didn't even tell me, like, it was 850 horsepower. And like, like incredible. Like I never experienced testing before. And anyway, so you are, you are just talking shit.
SPEAKER_03: from your phone, just, if you want, just come here and confront Irakli Zirakashvili. Irakli says that he's gonna clean your tears from the table, right, Roman? Yeah, yeah. Yes, yes, yes. With Ermes' tears, they will clean the table afterwards. This guy, Deb Miok, please don't write those kind of things if you don't want to be blocked, you know, it's very disrespectful.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, so let me check if Ermes is requesting for link or something. No, he's not. So Ermes is only talking. When it comes to the confrontation, he's not here. Translate what I said.
SPEAKER_01: You can write a voice message, send it to me, and if you want, you can send me a link. Now, if you don't wait for the link, there won't be any reaction, and you can leave, but you know what will happen? The fact is, I will leave.
SPEAKER_01: He said that considering the lifts that Lewand just did, like world record, Ermes is really having some mental issues right now. He's mentally unstable. He's not sure if he's afraid or what.
SPEAKER_03: So he's saying that, like, Ermes should respect what Levan lifted, right? Yes. Because if he's not doing that, he has issues, he's saying. Yeah, mental ones. Okay, okay. Let's see how it will be. Okay, let me share this link on Instagram, lastly, and then let me focus my guests.
SPEAKER_03: And then take Irakli. And then, yep, we are ready. Okay, let's go. Let's go, Irakli. Let's go. So, how is everything, Irakli, since the Tbilisi events? How is the Tbilisi event going? Well, it's going well. I'm feeling mentally unwell. I don't want to say that I'm not feeling well, but it's going well.
SPEAKER_00: It's in a very good shape, and it's going to be one of my picks, and it's going to be a new pick. I'm going to show you what it's going to look like.
SPEAKER_01: So he's saying that there was some mental thing going on, some period of time shortly after the event because of how carrying this heavy weight this was to lose his hometown. But he's been preparing since then, like getting in shape, not backing off whatsoever. And he slowly has been gathered his forces and he's already in good shape.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, okay, since it is like openly like fire from both sides, Irakli and Tata Singh's back, I want to ask him, he is right about the fouls and things like that, yeah, but does he think that he is like,
SPEAKER_03: he's satisfied with his technical preparation about such match or like does he also think that like he has to do some adjustments technical adjustments yes uh iran i say
SPEAKER_01: It is possible to have a debate with him or her, but if you don't want to talk to him or her, you can talk to him or her with your technical skills. It is very important to talk to him or her with your technical skills, so that he or she can talk to you in a way that you think is appropriate.
SPEAKER_00: Well, what can I say, it was a great experience, and I think everyone was very happy, everyone was very happy, and I think everyone was very happy, and I think everyone was very happy, and I think everyone was very happy, and I think everyone was very happy, and I think everyone was very happy, and I think everyone was very happy, and I think everyone was very happy, and I think everyone was very happy, and I think everyone was very happy, and I think everyone was very happy, and I think everyone was very happy, and I think everyone was very happy, and I think everyone was very happy, and I think everyone was very happy, and I think everyone was very happy, and I think everyone was very happy, and I think everyone was very happy, and I think everyone was very happy, and I think everyone was very happy, and I think everyone was very happy, and I think everyone was very happy, and I think everyone was very happy, and I think everyone was very happy, and I think everyone was very happy, and I think everyone was very
SPEAKER_00: I would like to point out that there is no such thing as a tool for picking, it is a tool that can be used for picking, and it is also a tool that can be used to draw. I can't just pick one tool and use it for drawing. I think it would be nice to have this technique in the form of drawing, it is very useful, well, it is not useful for everyone,
SPEAKER_00: There are a lot of people who are afraid of the fact that they will not be able to do what they want to do. They are afraid of the fact that they will not be able to do what they want to do. They are afraid of the fact that they will not be able to do what they want to do
SPEAKER_00: And now we are going to see how it will turn out. We are going to see how it will turn out. And now we are going to see how it will turn out. And now we are going to see how it will turn out.
SPEAKER_01: So, that's it.
SPEAKER_01: answered by saying how well prepared he was and at what stage he was unsatisfied with his preparation. So he said basically he was active. Everybody knows that he was constantly pulling, maybe not every event, but in a short time of intervals.
SPEAKER_01: and he said he got over these years he got over fatigued and he meant by this that the peaks of his shape that he was trying to demonstrate per may per event was absence so he was not
SPEAKER_01: how close distance it was to be prepared and then he said like for instance if i was pulling every every three months every other three months so it was like after the event was done one month basically was lost and everybody would know that or maybe the ones who are in arm wrestling and i was only preparing in two months right he was saying like this in from three months intervals
SPEAKER_01: also what you rightly pointed out is that um not maybe not everybody would know but you definitely know that uh no matter how good and well prepared physically you are if your opponent is somewhat somewhat equal strength wise somewhat equal strength level uh this type of elbow jumps
SPEAKER_01: plays a huge role to resist your opponent right so when the strength was that even that one mattered right this is what he wanted to say and um then so he basically kept answering from the physical shape perspective your question was technical that's why I had to re-ask and make sure so he said he's he was satisfied how he was technically prepared basically to execute his uh
SPEAKER_01: uh plan but uh he was not in his peak shape because he got over fatigued and he was lacking the arresting time okay big growth goes as the superjet does iraqi think that the only reason todd won was false
SPEAKER_00: Yes, you are absolutely right. One of the reasons why we have to do this is that we have to be able to explain to the people that we don't want to do it. Yes, I don't want to say that I have to do it, but I have to do it. I don't want to say that I have to do it, but I have to do it. I don't want to say that I have to do it,
SPEAKER_00: It was a great experience for me to be able to participate in such a big event. I am very happy to be able to participate in such a big event. I am very happy to be able to participate in such a big event.
SPEAKER_00: The referee is from the second team, and there are players in the club. The club is for all sports. And I think that players, whether they are from Mevi, Todd, Levan, Devon, or Vinikne, they don't care if they are from a club or not, whether they are from a sport or not, they don't care.
SPEAKER_00: I am convinced that there is nothing wrong with that and that's it. I don't think there is anything wrong with that and that's it. I don't think there is anything wrong with that and that's it. I don't think there is anything wrong with that and that's it. I think there is nothing wrong with that and that's it. I think there is nothing wrong with that and that's it.
SPEAKER_00: He answered the question.
SPEAKER_01: Basically, no, because nobody knows exactly what would have happened if the fouls were called. Maybe I would have won. Maybe he would still have won. So no, just he did not end up victorious only just because fouls were not called. Nobody knows that. But I saw that everybody, like basically Todd's fans, got pretty aggressive and tried to defend Todd once I published this video of
SPEAKER_01: of me calling out those fouls. I'm sure Todd knows that he made some fouls, but obviously if fouls are not called, he's not stupid, I'm not stupid, nobody is stupid to stop, right? If referee doesn't stop you, why should stop, right? So I understand what Todd did. However, I just want to point out that the aggression that caused by my
SPEAKER_01: this pointing out of the file was unnecessary because everybody should understand if there is the law, there's these rules, not law, but rules enormously.
SPEAKER_01: It should be followed by not only me, not only Todd, Levan, Alarad or whoever it is. It should be followed by everyone. And if we don't follow, we should get fouls. It's a simple thing. This is what I wanted to point out. And of course, I understand they are Todd's fans. Whatever Todd does, they will support, no doubt. But the aggression should not be that much overhyped, so to say. So this is all I wanted to say.
SPEAKER_03: I mean, I don't see anyone, if there is a wrong decision, anyone to complain or something. I mean, it's understandable. And it has happened to some other matches as well. And so I understand him. And then Todd accepted to do it again. And Irakli.
SPEAKER_03: Tad came to Tbilisi to pull you. Would you go to America to pull Tad, just say in September? Because Tad just pulled in Istanbul. Tad just pulled in Istanbul. So, I mean, he can pull in next event. But would you pull him in September in America or anywhere? I mean, if it is not in America, maybe somewhere else. But if it is in America, would you pull there in his home country as he did? No.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, it is possible to say that. It is possible to say that. Yes, it is possible to say that. Yes, it is possible to say that. Yes, it is possible to say that. Yes, it is possible to say that.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know what to say, but I think it's a very important question. I don't think there is a need for a new territory. I don't think there is a need for it.
SPEAKER_01: Ford sure. It doesn't matter. I would definitely pull him everywhere, especially also his country, because like you said, he pulled in my country, he pulled me, but I would like to know exactly when so that I could prepare better. It doesn't, so date does matter, but for sure, I'll take the challenge and pull him in USA. So he's ready to pull Todd in wherever on this earth. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: And Jeff N says that why should the fans suffer to watch him pull Ermes without working his way back? Is it because he is a Georgii and trained with special treatments?
SPEAKER_03: I don't know what that means, but he talks a lot for barely being top five, in my opinion. I mean, if you are thinking that Irakli is not top five in his category, then I would disagree with that. But maybe you can translate, Roman, but I don't think there is a question directly for Irakli. Was he really talking about Irakli? Because Irakli never said he wanted to pull Ermes. Was he talking about Irakli? I can translate for sure.
SPEAKER_03: I don't know who she's talking about. I was thinking maybe he's talking about Gennady, because Gennady is the one who pulled both Ermes and Vidal. Yeah, but I don't know. Where is the conversation that Gennady wants to pull Ermes or Tad? Yeah, I don't know. Okay, so he didn't specify. I don't know.
SPEAKER_03: Okay. There is Mask Aurel. If Iraq is too proud to admit that he also lost because of technique and lack of strength in certain areas, he will lose over and over again, he says. This is a super chat. It's a super chat. Let me translate. If you don't mind.
SPEAKER_01: There was a super chat, I think it was Poulsro, in the chat. In the chat, there was a question about the technical side of it. Is it technical or is it not? I don't know what to say. I think it depends on what kind of work you do in the technical field. I think it depends on what you do in the technical field.
SPEAKER_03: He said, we will see you next time with Paul. One guy says, you will have to special referee this match so Irakli can complain about the rest. My friend, I don't think it is about Irakli complain or something, but I think my opinion, the lighting in that event was dark. Probably that is why, because there was some serious, like obvious spells, you know. But I'm not saying that there was a reason that Todd won, but...
SPEAKER_03: So, we will see. I think they need to pull again and then we need to clear the things. Yeah, it may be third loss for Irakli or Irakli comes and takes his title back and we will see. Anyway, so let's talk about the beef with Ermes.
SPEAKER_03: What's going on? Ermes said he's going to clean the tabletop with you and then you just said that you're going to clean his tears from the table. So what's going to happen? Yesterday he said on the podcast that he's going to give a mask, oxygen mask, but not to level one, but to you because you will put on him. Do you want to respond to this?
SPEAKER_01: Yes, I think it's a good thing that we all have the opportunity to talk about it. I think it's a good thing that we all have the opportunity to talk about it. I think it's a good thing that we all have the opportunity to talk about it. I think it's a good thing that we all have the opportunity to talk about it. I think it's a good thing that we all have the opportunity to talk about it. I think it's a good thing that we all have the opportunity to talk about it.
SPEAKER_01: So he said that Ermes is more like a dream guy because this Levan that he's going to face from now is completely different than the one that he knows and remembers from the previous match. So he said like Ermes dream Barini, something like this. He's a dreamy guy. Well, is Ermes daydreaming?
SPEAKER_03: Daydream, yeah, daydream, yeah. Okay. Okay, so Ermes didn't respond yet. Ermes is probably upset with me. Just because we are very close friends, I sometimes joke too much. And so there is... Doyle Conrad says, East-West needs to test for Royce. Eventually, we will. And... Okay.
SPEAKER_03: So, what did you think about, before we go there, like, how are the trainings? Now you train left arm or right arm? Like right arm is ready or you are resting your right arm? How is it going? Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: I have a lot of experience in this field. Well, I think Marjouina is a little bit different, a little bit different from me, because she has a lot of experience. Yes, she has a lot of experience, but she is a little bit different from me. She is a little bit different from me. She is a little bit different from me. She is a little bit different from me. She is a little bit different from me. She is a little bit different from me. She is a little bit different from me. She is a little bit different from me. She is a little bit different from me. She is a little bit different from me. She is a little bit different from me. She is a little bit different from me. She is a little bit different from me. She is a little bit different from me. She is a little bit different from me. She is a little bit different from me. She is a little bit different from me. She is a little bit different from me. She is a little bit different from me. She is a little
SPEAKER_00: I think it's going to be a very interesting format.
SPEAKER_01: interesting he said for sure i'm training both constantly but speaking of uh arm as itself to be prepared to pull at high level possible or resources a right arm needs to be more resting time so that it will kick so basically he reiterated what he mentioned previously but he said for fans i might have surprised with my lefty he said so my left arm
SPEAKER_03: Irakli just recently got his visa, so he is asking for a supermatch with left arm. Is that correct? He just hinted on that one. He said, I will surprise fans with my left arm. He's saying that for Chicago, he wants left arm match. Okay. Because he kind of requested to let his right arm rest to reach the point. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. So, and he wants his first right arm match to be Todd Cushing's?
SPEAKER_00: Do you have any plans for the future? Yes, I have a plan for the future. I want to be in the same form as I used to be. I want to be in the same form as I used to be. I want to be in the same form as I used to be. I want to be in the same form as I used to be.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, he wants to put this chapter behind and put the dot in it so that we know for justifiably and rightly and fairly done, we need to finally, once and for all, answer the question, who is the better arm wrestler between me and Todd? So for sure, I want my next right-handed arm, right-arm match to be Kota Csiks. Roman Kinga asked him,
SPEAKER_03: Does he realize that this may be his last shot for Tata Kings? Is he confident for the next time? Because if he loses, then people will never want to see them play again.
SPEAKER_01: This is a great chance to say that it is a very good idea to do this, because it is of great interest to the people. Yes, it is a very good idea to do this.
SPEAKER_00: Well, yes, I totally acknowledge that. And I'm stating here, right here, right now, if he beats me next time we pull, that will be the final one. I will never ever arm wrestle him again.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, so let's talk about the last event from Istanbul. And which one was his favorite match? My favorite match was Nugo and Mad Mask. Nugo and Mad Mask.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, I understood that. Parts of... Well, yeah, it's kind of emotional and all that. But I still, in my opinion, have a lot of respect for the people of Klaužili. I'll come back and I'll come back again.
SPEAKER_01: So from the excitement point, how Match was emotionally invested, how it was back and forth type of thing, when it comes to the sheer adrenaline, for sure Lugo and Mad Mask Match was my favorite. But when I talk about how Match itself evolved, how it started, how it ended and how it went through,
SPEAKER_03: back and forth, like poor arm wrestling, Kalinchenko vs. Matyushenko match was my favorite. You mean Kalinchenko vs. Matyushenko? Yeah. Okay. And why did he like the Matt vs. Nugent match? Is it because it was fun? Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's what he said. But you can ask him if he wants to add anything more for that match?
SPEAKER_01: If he wants anything more for that match? If he wants to add anything about that match, if he wants to say his opinion about that match. If he wants to add anything about that match, if he wants to say his opinion about that match. If he wants to add anything about that match, if he wants to say his opinion about that match.
SPEAKER_00: Well, it's great to be in Georgii. It's great to be in Georgii. It's great to be in Georgii. It's great to be in Georgii. It's great to be in Georgii. It's great to be in Georgii. It's great to be in Georgii.
SPEAKER_01: It's a very exciting match, obviously, when it comes to Matt Mask, he's always delivering this excitement to the table, he used to call me out as well, he wanted to pull me and stuff, so this adrenaline rushing was finally, how can I say, this fire was finally watered from Lugo when he
SPEAKER_01: So is he trying to say that Ngo finished Matt Mask's fire and then Matt would never call him again?
SPEAKER_00: Well, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
SPEAKER_01: I don't think he will ever challenge Lugo again, but if he wants to challenge me, I could also water his fire and smoke him. But right now, not on right arm, I need to take a rest.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, okay. So he's saying that Matt will never dare to challenge Irakli after what he experienced. Challenge Nugo, he said. Challenge Nugo. He will never challenge Nugo again what he experienced. But if he challenges Irakli, then when time is right, he will do the same. That's what he said. He will do the same to Matt what Nugo did.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, okay. And how did you like the Michael Todorovsky-Vitali match? Well, as you can see, it was a very good match. It was a very good match. It was a very good match. It was a very good match. Well, as you can see, it was a very good match. Well, as you can see, it was a very good match. Well, as you can see, it was a very good match. Well, as you can see, it was a very good match. Well, as you can see, it was a very good match. Well, as you can see, it was a very good match.
SPEAKER_01: It was very exciting match and interesting to watch. Well, many people predicted how it would be, in which type of flow it would go when we are talking about
SPEAKER_01: Michael opened our top roll and Vitaly tried to press. We all kind of predicted that the match would go that way. But it was very interesting. I was surprised and kind of didn't expect that Vitaly could hold on that slow press so long and effectively. That fact surprised me. And what did he think about Tata Haching versus Rukhsson?
SPEAKER_00: Look at him, he's smiling.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.
SPEAKER_01: Well, since my call-outs on these elbow fouls, this time referees and not only referees, but everybody, basically fans and viewers from PPV and everybody who was watching that would watch even more closely and we have seen that all was fouled out and was called this time more strictly. Second round, Rustam executed very well and he finished the
SPEAKER_01: second round very good uh but but rustam's injury basically saved todd and uh saved todd from losing his belt basically um i i have a news i don't know if it is a good news bad news but somebody is asking for a link to join
SPEAKER_01: oh who can that be somebody just following you and for sure somebody who was watching this live stream as well yeah because there's something that he rightly said and triggered that guy yeah who can that be
SPEAKER_03: Who can that be? One guy said Ermes, other guy said Ermes, and another Ermes. And then Ermes... I think it's from West. I think that guy is from West. Let's see. People say it's Ermes. Ermes, but... But is it Ermes? Let's see. Let's see who's coming. Yeah. Oh!
SPEAKER_03: Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Somebody just joined. What the fuck is going on, everybody? Nice to see you, man. Nice to see you. Matt probably heard it. Matt, okay, what was your response to this guy? He said that Nugo finished your fire and that you will never, ever, ever challenge Irakli again.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, well, you know what? I completely underestimated Nugo. I got to give hats off to him. He did a fucking fantastic job. But I just finished having a match a month prior to that. And if I can recall, we had offered Irakli a match prior to. And then I believe right after this event, you asked me if I'd be willing to pull Irakli left arm. And then we presented him with it. And then he said he didn't want to pull me.
SPEAKER_02: So if I'm not mistaken, I'm pretty sure Irakli's scared in this one. So Irakli, why don't you step up and pull me left arm in Chicago, give my right arm a break for a month or two, and we'll see what we can do with each other.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know what to say, but I think that this is a very important issue, and I think it should be addressed. I don't know what to say, but I think that this is a very important issue, and I think it should be addressed. I think it should be addressed.
SPEAKER_00: Easy day, easy money.
SPEAKER_03: Easy day, easy money for Irakli. You are easy money. Yeah, so why don't you want to take the match then? Let me answer. Okay, okay, that's the fact. I asked, you know, Irakli wanted to pull Krasny, but not Mask, and Krasny said he's going Europeans.
SPEAKER_00: and he can't be ready and but if you guys want iraq if you want iraq what do you think that matt beat on garba when ungarby beat you
SPEAKER_01: I'm not letting that fact to get in my head. It doesn't mean anything pretty much because it's not a math. This is arm wrestling. So if one guy beats the other guy, it doesn't mean that the other guy will beat some third guy. So we all know this is not the math here. So I'm not bothered by that fact. Okay. The reason that he didn't want to pull Matt but Krasimir because he thought that Matt was not strong enough or he thought that he was too strong for him? What was that?
SPEAKER_01: I think he was scared. I don't think he likes my vulgar attitude when we're on the table facing each other. Arsen you offended by me?
SPEAKER_01: I don't know why I don't want to talk about it. I don't know why I don't want to talk about it. I don't know why I don't want to talk about it. I don't know why I don't want to talk about it. I don't know why I don't want to talk about it. I don't know why I don't want to talk about it.
SPEAKER_00: Well, now I would like to say thank you to Krasis because, as you know, I was in the national championship in March last year, and Krasis was in the official national championship. Yes, and Krasis' contribution to me was a big help in my life, as well as Matt Mask's contribution to March. That's why I'm glad that Matt Mask didn't make any mistakes in March.
SPEAKER_01: No offense to you. Well, the reason... Devon't start a conversation with me. He just said, first of all, I'm not afraid of you or nobody else. So don't start a conversation like that with me. Allen right, got you. I'm not afraid of you nor anyone. What I'm saying is that the reason why I took Krasimir's name over yours is that he's more established armistice on the left hand.
SPEAKER_01: On the left hand, he basically last year, he won WAPS and you as a left hand in your non-existence. So that's why I chose him. I have seen Mad Max top row in Devon, even pinning. I haven't lost a match in two years on my left. Maybe they're not in big names, but I haven't lost a match in two years.
SPEAKER_01: It's been a long time since I've been to Artskhena. I don't want to talk about big cities, but I've been to Artskhena a lot. It's been a long time since I've been to Artskhena. I've been to Artskhena a lot.
SPEAKER_00: Allen right, Matt. Let's put this this way. If you think that you can stand a chance against me on left hand, June 21st, I'm going to Chicago to destroy you. That's it.
SPEAKER_02: I'll see you there, buddy. I'll see you there. I want you to do our press conference. I want you to sing me happy birthday, okay, Irakli? The one thing I want for my birthday is for you to sing me happy birthday when we do the press conference, okay? And I want a cupcake. I want a cupcake.
SPEAKER_02: and i want a candle on my fucking cupcake okay he said no doubt no doubt for sure he will sing okay so you guys want to pull you guys want to pull in chicago i am no problem you no problem no problem it'd be an easy day easy money for iraq easy money coming your way okay
SPEAKER_00: I'm not saying that Martevik Fuli is going to win. I'm just saying that I'm going to compete with Satan. And my opponent is going to be in the same form as Konya. I'm not going to blame anyone for that. I'm going to be in the same form as Konya. I'm not going to blame anyone for that. I'm going to be in the same form as Konya. I'm not going to blame anyone for that.
SPEAKER_01: Well, I'll take that last part as a joke that it would be easy money for me. Ford sure not. I never underestimate my opponents. What I can guarantee you, Mask, is that my left hand will be in a very, very good shape, like one of the best shapes because it's been resting and prepare your left one as well. You should not underestimate my left arm. I will be delivering my best left arm. Irakli, you didn't pull for the six years with left arm, correct?
SPEAKER_02: No, no, it's 2019. It's 2019. It's 2019. It's 2019. It's 2019. It's 2019. It's 2019. It's 2019.
SPEAKER_03: I don't know. It's definitely not weak and you will test it. I don't know. He said, yes, Engin, it was 2019 when he pulled last time. Last time, yes. Six years and it was not his bedroom. And is he making a mistake to accept this match? It may be six years before you see him pull again after this one. What did he say?
SPEAKER_01: So you're going to make him quit arm wrestling with left arm? No, I'm just going to make him take a break. Take a break, OK. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: If you look at it from the point of view of Marxism-Leninism, there is no such thing as a dominant art, there is no such thing as a dominant art in Artsakh, there is no such thing as a dominant art in Artsakh, there is no such thing as a dominant art in Artsakh, there is no such thing as a dominant art in Artsakh, there is no such thing as a dominant art in Artsakh, there is no such thing as a dominant art in Artsakh, there is no such thing as a dominant art in Artsakh,
SPEAKER_01: Well, I mean, Irakli is taking a different approach with this. Like, if the arm is rested six years, it should be way better now. It should be. No problem. We're about to find out then. So are you making this match happen then, Engin? Okay. I feel like, you know, the marriage, you know, official, you know.
SPEAKER_03: You, Matt, do you accept to pull this guy, Irakli Zirakashvili, as your left arm opponent? Of course I fucking accept. Yes or no? Of course I accept. What's the weight? 105. Yeah. And Irakli, I feel like I'm married now. Do you accept this match, Irakli?
SPEAKER_01: Say I do. Just say I do. Say I do.
SPEAKER_03: yes yes by the power invested in me okay and i i declare you as openness okay okay let's go i gotta i gotta hold to finish digging here yeah just wait one more i gotta get back to work just just one more training one more minute exactly are you gonna talk with him in georgian like nugo did

SPEAKER_01: matt it will be like uh one and a half months since you will be pulling a game uh uh one more georgia and please don't uh don't uh as a nation right i can't make no promises when it's all said and done when it's all said and done i'll buy you a beer but up until that point you hey yeah yeah and exactly what are you gonna do when matt starts those f-bombs
SPEAKER_02: He's going to do what everybody else does. He's going to listen. He's going to fucking listen is what he's going to do.
SPEAKER_01: The problem is that if we want to do something about it, we have to do it ourselves. We can't do it on our own. We can't do it on our own. We can't do it on our own. We can't do it on our own. We can't do it on our own. We can't do it on our own. We can't do it on our own. We can't do it on our own. We can't do it on our own. We can't do it on our own. We can't do it on our own. We can't do it on our own.
SPEAKER_01: It feels like he's saying way more to him, isn't he? I'm just translating. Everybody's saying everything so that he understands the context.
SPEAKER_02: yeah i know i know i cannot just be a robot and just understand okay what's your answer the guy needs to dig hole is that you're gonna bring him there right there it's too big of a hole for him and that's where the whole georgian team's gonna be right there digging a big enough hole for all the georgians
SPEAKER_01: I have to translate everything, so don't be mad if I translate everything. Just go a little bit quicker, please. I have to translate everything, so don't be mad if I translate everything. Just go a little bit quicker, please. I have to translate everything, so don't be mad if I translate everything. I have to translate everything, so don't be mad if I translate everything.
SPEAKER_01: Matt, that was a perfect answer. Since you, since you, by your judgment, your own judgment, since you think that that hole is way big for me, it's perfect for you. You are already doing that for yourself. Okay. Well, you know. Okay. And lay what you make, right?
SPEAKER_03: Okay, the last one is Superchat and then you can go, Matt. Engin, please ask Irakli and Matt which armwrestler they think is the strongest of all time. That he is number one against anyone. Who is the strongest armwrestler ever played? Not the greatest, but the strongest. Well, I would say the strongest right now. Like that I've pulled or strongest of all time? Strongest of all time.
SPEAKER_02: I would say that would have to be LaVon would be taking that spot right now. Toss up between LaVon and Prime Suplinkov. But I'd say LaVon is there right now. Okay. He's throwing above his shoulders what most men can't bench press. Okay, Matt, we don't want to keep you busy anymore. You just continue digging Irakli's hole.
SPEAKER_02: I will have you guys on a podcast. And we'll see all you motherfuckers on June 21st. Yeah, take care. Take care, man. Thank you for joining. Devon't forget, buy the fucking pay-per-view. We'll see you there. That was a great plug.
SPEAKER_01: Let me quickly translate this for him. Ira, I don't want to go into too much detail, but I think it's our turn now. Everyone has their turn. Levan and Denis, I would like to thank you for this time, Levan, because I don't know what to say, but I'm very happy to be able to talk to you in such a short video. I'm very happy to be able to talk to you in such a short video.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, Matt said he wants to go to the Champions League of Slovakia. Bambino! It is too much for Irakli. Next time I'm going to bring Tatacic and he will be okay. Matt and then Ermes and the next is Tatacic. Who is cleaning the table? Who is cleaning the table? Maggie, that's me, Spencer.
SPEAKER_01: So he's going to use Ermes' tears to clean the table because it would be so bad. Why would he eat the tears? Tears is when you cry and water comes. He says that no one is going to beat you, no one is going to beat you and you will cry. My tears and his body. Together.
SPEAKER_03: Okay. Okay. We will see. We will see. We will see. So on the social media, you guys write a lot. Now you both are quiet. Listen, Ermes, he says that basically, it's my translation, he says that Levan is going to hit you like a bus. Is that correct, Irakli? That's what you meant, right?
SPEAKER_01: Of course. Yeah. Of course? Yes. Pretty much the same. Yeah. What he will do? What's that? What he will do?
SPEAKER_03: Like he said, the left one is going to hit you like a bus. Yeah, like last time. He's ironically saying, let's not scare Ermes too much. We need to see a really good match. Oh, he may find an excuse and say, oh, I get trauma or something, right?
SPEAKER_03: Where is he, the Tadachins? Tadachins? I don't know. I don't know if he wants to join or not, but... Listen, listen, exactly. Ermes is asking for Tadachins because
SPEAKER_03: He doesn't want to confront you. He wants Tat to come and you and Tat to go to each other. So he can stay safe. I did too much yesterday, my friend. Too much tired. Too much tired, yeah? Yeah. How is the training? Tomorrow? Good, good. Tomorrow by pressure. By pressure.
SPEAKER_01: I know for sure so many people already messaged Ermes about Levan's lift. Tomorrow, Ermes will actually outdo Levan's lift and he will curl 190 kg. Ermes will curl 190 kg. Exactly. I have a question. Okay, you are saying that Levan did 180 and you are making fun with Ermes. You said that he cannot do it. But can Levan do Ermes' lift? Yeah, this is really a question of quality.
SPEAKER_03: You guys like it? Yeah, good job my friend. You buy me a piece of margarita when I come to Italy.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I will get one slice of it because I'm translating it. So, yeah. We can say that Ermes didn't make it to Levan's record. But if you want Levan to make it to the top of Ermes' record, you have to put him under pressure. Under pressure? Under pressure, yes. He made it to the top of Levan's record. I made it to the top of Levan's record.
SPEAKER_01: We don't even need to involve Levan in this conversation. Even I'm going to do it. Yeah, try. Try. Ermes. Ermes yesterday said that Iraq's brachioradialis is stronger than Levan. Ford sure. Is that true? Yes, Ermes is right. I think that Levan is stronger than Iraq. Thank you.
SPEAKER_00: Well, Levan is a great man, and he's a great man, and he's a great man, and he's a great man, and he's a great man, and he's a great man, and he's a great man.
SPEAKER_00: And it will grow. And when it grows, it will grow all over again. That's why it's so small. That's why it's so big. If it grows, it will grow. If it grows, it will grow.
SPEAKER_01: Since we are talking about comparison, my strength, back pressure with Levan's, I can break it down really easily. So Levan's hand is so huge, so enormous, Ermes knows that, that when I grip up against him, just he's doing this motion, like this movement, it's already basically taking my wrist away. It's extremely tough to...
SPEAKER_01: pressure optimally against him. So when we're talking about arm wrestling related back pressure, he's beating me every time. He's stronger, yeah. But how about with the weight?
SPEAKER_00: No, I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so.
SPEAKER_01: We, to be honest, never compared this, like whoever has better back pressure by the lifts, she weights, we never compared. But recently, like I already told you, I've been pulling with him constantly, right? We are sparring and he's become so like, so heavy when arm itself and like, it's so tough for me. We were sparring, but it's very strong. He's very strong.
SPEAKER_01: Irakli, are you trying to scare Ermes? Exactly, I was about to say, he's about to leave again. The problem is that Irakli never tried with me.
SPEAKER_03: My hand to big hand, look. I have, I have, okay, there's a super chat. Big Grove Gold says that, Ermes, my friend, can you convince Engin to come to Chicago next month?
SPEAKER_03: if you convince him, if you can convince him, I will buy VIP package. So he says that if you make me come to Chicago, you will come for sure. I don't know. Listen, you're telling me like privately, you are saying Engin, you need to come. I say, why? And you said you are going to see the new champion, new number one. And then today I talked with
SPEAKER_03: Levan? And he said, Engin, you need to come. I said, do you want me to come? He said, yes. He said that it would give him a power. It would give him power. So if I come there, I don't know who is going to help, you know? I don't know. Come, come, my friend. We will enjoy together. Yeah, it would be lovely, lovely. You guys, I mean, incredible. Incredible. 18 June is my birthday.
SPEAKER_03: 18 June is, oh, so celebration. Yeah, we can do something, please. Yeah, okay. Roman. Ford me. What are you doing, what, what, Melskausko said it was his birthday, right? And I was about to say, Alex Kurdecha is also in June, right, Ermes? I think you told me. Yeah, 16. Alex is also in June. 16, oh, okay. Yeah. So we are going to make a big cake. So Alex, Ermes and Matt.
SPEAKER_03: yeah why why the future world champion on the world oh three guys the cake which one you're gonna you're gonna give iraqi the oxygen mask for level
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, he needs to be very fast to put. If Levan sees that oxygen mask, during the press conference, Ermes is giving to Levan, do you think Levan will be angry with him? Yes, I agree with you. If you think about it, how would Levan react if he saw this?
SPEAKER_01: Devon't do it, Ermes, because it will for sure piss him off and he will become twice strong. Ooh, Ermes. Let's see if Ermes is scared or not. If Ermes is scared,
SPEAKER_03: he will change his mind. But if Ermes goes and gives him the oxygen mask, then it means that Ermes doesn't give a shit. Doesn't give a shit. We will see. I will watch the press conference. I don't care if he will be angry or hungry or whatever he want. Devon't change the result, my friend. And what's the result?
SPEAKER_03: I will win. And you know, he will be angry or not, the power don't change, nothing. No, maybe he will lose more energy before. When he gets angry?
SPEAKER_00: Okay, Roman, can you translate it for us? Roman, let me ask you one question. Now we are in the United States, in the United States, in the United States, in the United States, in the United States, in the United States, in the United States,
SPEAKER_01: Sorry, Engin, as I was trying to translate what Ermes just said, he interrupted me. He's been meaning to ask you the question. Me? Yeah, he wants to ask you. Okay. But it's good that Ermes is also listening.
SPEAKER_01: So, Engin, is it like, you know how lazy sometimes Levan is when it comes to carrying the belt? It's kind of heavy and also basically not Levan, but I am carrying one, right? So, Ermes, so, Engin, my question is, you know, we have to make three transitional flights to arrive at the destination from Georgii. We have to stop, right? It's not direct flight, so it's going to be exhausting for me to carry Levan's belt. So...
SPEAKER_03: Should we actually bring the belts? Does it matter? I mean, I don't think we need to bring the belt there. Oh, so you are saying that since the result is known and Levan is winning... Yeah, he can put on the... He can send it directly on Italy before the fight, my friend, no problem. Oh, that's a good idea. It's a good idea.
SPEAKER_03: You can go here, no problem for the flight, my friend. He doesn't have to carry that long. Yeah, right, Ermes? He just transfers. And everything here, no problem. Okay. Did you guys already buy the ticket or not? No, right? No. I think that from Istanbul to Chicago, there is a direct flight. So if you come from Tbilisi to Istanbul,
SPEAKER_03: And Istanbul, Turkish Airlines directly going to Chicago. Just for your information. You just need like one and a half hour from Tbilisi to Istanbul. From Istanbul, you go on the plane, in the plane, good Turkish food, you are arriving to Chicago. It would be good. Let's see if they have on the right times. But yeah, we will see. Anyways, Ermes,
SPEAKER_03: my friend thank you very very much for joining next week thank you so much thank you so much quality translator roman see you in roman i know it's roman see you for the
SPEAKER_03: to see for a, to, I don't know the words. When I'm tired, my English go very down, very too much, my friend. Sorry. You need. Me in Chicago. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Next week I will have Levan as my guest and week before the event, I want you and Levan together on the podcast.
SPEAKER_03: And then you can tell him whatever you want to tell, and he's going to tell you. I hope he will not be hated so much because Levan looked so scary when he did that. No problem. I'm not scared. Belly curl. Okay. Thank you very much. And Irakli, there is one last question for you. Clerk is asking, Irakli, who wins, Prudnik or Shkadze? Right arm. Right arm.
