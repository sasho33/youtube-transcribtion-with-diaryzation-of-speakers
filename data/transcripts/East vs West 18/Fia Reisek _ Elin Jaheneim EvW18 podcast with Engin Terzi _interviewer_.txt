SPEAKER_06: How do I pronounce your last name? Janaheim. Say again? Janaheim. Janaheim? Yes. Okay, okay. And yours is not Raizek, but Raizek? Yes. Okay, okay. So I have been pronouncing wrong.
SPEAKER_06: So, how are you ladies doing? Great, thank you. How are you? I met the Europeans and all day coaching, translating, doing all kind of things and now doing the podcast from the hotel room. This is a very important match. Very important match. For us, it is important.
SPEAKER_06: Oh, I mean, for everyone, everyone who knows arm wrestling, this is very important match. But for the people that think arm wrestling is
SPEAKER_06: they would they may not care but I don't care about them either you know because because I know how important this match you know this match will determine the best 70 kilo right arm female arm wrestler in the world and I think three years ago you ladies pull and I think right arm you want the left arm you want Ellen right arm I want the left arm and then right arm
SPEAKER_06: But she beat me in one match. I saw that. About this match, I'm very, very confused. Very confused about what to think about this match. I will explain why I'm confused. One reason is that Elin is very, very young. So when you are very, very young,
SPEAKER_06: Three years mean a ton. And from other side, Fia, I have never ever seen you this strong as last a few years. And I... And I'm very, very old also. People says the same thing about Todd Hutchings, while he's probably almost 20 years older than you. He's my hero.
SPEAKER_06: yeah so i mean like when you pull mali i i was thinking that there was a possibility or to flash pin you you know some rounds you know the question was if you could stop her and because we remember the wl match and so there was a possibility and but it didn't go that way and
SPEAKER_06: results, you know, also show, you know, how good you are. So I don't know what to think. Like, three years ago, you were a bit ahead. As you said that you lost one match. And now three years later, you are in different level while it has been three years and Ellen 100% that she's stronger, much stronger. So does it does it does it make you nervous?
SPEAKER_04: that it has been three years and even three years ago it was close and she is young you understand my question yes yes definitely um yeah uh i know she's stronger uh it it makes me it makes me excited not
SPEAKER_04: I'm always nervous about every match I do, but Elin is special also because she has been chasing us for so long. From the beginning, she was just a little girl and we could keep her away for a while, but when she started to be a grown-up, she showed us that she
SPEAKER_04: is really in the top league and it's always hard to have that small kids coming up being better than you yeah it's it's exciting and nervous and like yeah but it will be super fun i'm i'm excited about this
SPEAKER_06: Yeah, yeah. You know, last time you pulled Malin, I think she has defeated you before you beat her in WL. And I don't know if it was last time, but so you were pulling against Malin that she beat you in WL. So about which match?
SPEAKER_04: you were concerned more about Malin or more about Ellen? Maybe I shouldn't ask this question. I was not concerned about Malin. I just wanted to show myself that I can get better.
SPEAKER_04: And I thought, like you, that even if I can stop that hit once, I will show myself that I've been better. Elin is different because I have everything to lose against her. She's the hunter this time and I'm the defender and that's always hard to be in that position.
SPEAKER_06: hmm so can we can we say that malin was dangerous because of that explosiveness while ellen is someone who is actually like it doesn't matter if the match stops or something like she's a threat all match long you know it's also very explosive ellen is is super explosive but she's also super
SPEAKER_06: strong if if you if she gets stopped uh on the match then i'm then it's scary yeah yeah i i just didn't want to and yeah and also my opinion uh that um aileen
SPEAKER_06: was the only one that was competing the IFA and had very good chance to win WAF, just my opinion. And now the powerful girl is now pulling. And Elin, I think I remember you like long ago, you were like 14 years old when you won the juniors?
SPEAKER_06: Yeah, I was 13 years old when I won Europeans. Under 18? Yes, it's 10 years ago. Yeah, you were 13 years old, you beat the 18-year-old girls, and yeah, and everyone was talking about you. I was there, and then they were like, did you know that she's only 13? And that moment, and then we already knew it was just a matter of time that you were going to become something like special, you know, we all knew that.
SPEAKER_06: Now you are pulling against Fia Reykjavik. And in my opinion, no doubt, she is a legend and probably one of the gods of female armwrestling. And what are your thoughts about this match? My thoughts about this match, I'm super excited because I know Fia is super strong and I'm
SPEAKER_02: very excited because I haven't competed against her since, it's three years ago, we competed against each other. So, and in my opinion, I am different at the competition than in practice. Yeah, than in practice. Yeah. Yeah. So,
SPEAKER_06: It will be interesting and I'm super excited. I missed something. You said you are better in competition than practice. Why did you say that? I missed that part. Did you guys pull in practice? Sometimes, yes. Okay, when was it?
SPEAKER_06: also quite long ago it was a long ago because i no no it wasn't was it after that tournament match yes okay okay but then then from what you said what i understood is that she was better than you at the practice because you felt like you you needed to mention that am i wrong or no you're not wrong
SPEAKER_02: Okay, okay. I'm much better at competitions than at practice because I have a different focus at competitions. And do you think that Fia, maybe this
SPEAKER_06: her how many titles you have and she's gonna go like five minutes and i don't know like she doesn't even same as egley when i ask egley how many world titles you have she goes like i i stopped counting a long time ago and yeah so how do you see your chances ellen are you nervous yes i am nervous and that's good that's how it should be yeah and also excited and i i think it will be great matches
SPEAKER_06: between me and Fia. That's all I think. Okay, another question, Ellen. Do you expect a war? Yes, I do. Or do you have a goal to dominate? Or do you think that there is no way it will be a war, only war? I think it's going to be a war. And Fia, that's not your plan. I think it's not your plan. I think your plan is to...
SPEAKER_04: I always plan to take the easy way but I have been practicing the endurance after I knew about this match because I imagine that if it stops then it will be war and I'm not very comfortable in those kinds of matches. So you classify yourself
SPEAKER_04: as an explosive puller? It's like either I win or I lose. My matches are quite fast either way. So when it stops, I'm not used to that. Does it matter what kind of position the match stops?
SPEAKER_04: Not really. I think Elin has this warrior brain. So if she stops one centimeter from the pad, she will not give up. And if I'm tired, she will feel that. And then she will scream her way up from there. And then I'm gonna get panicked.
SPEAKER_06: I think your trainer will help you with the mental preparation. I think that if Giannis is listening, what you are saying now, I don't think he will panic and this and that. I know, I know.
SPEAKER_06: but i'm getting better with that it's it's better now than it have been i don't know we will see but another thing is that like yes there is a competition but at the end the title will still stay in sweden yeah yeah that that that the last world title match was also between malin and
SPEAKER_06: How great the, especially the female arm masters from Sweden, it has always been that way. It has always been this. Yeah. Yeah. So we are winners either way, sort of. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, so Elin, how do you see your chance?
SPEAKER_02: Let's go there. My chances to win? Yeah. How to explain? I think, in my opinion, I think it's possible to win. Yeah. But I know that Fia is super strong, so she can also win. It's like you never know when it's time. Oh, it's like 50-50. It may go...
SPEAKER_02: I think it depends on if you have a bad day or a good day for both of us. How tired we are. It's time difference, you know. Do you ladies really believe in a good day and bad day or it is all about physical and mental preparation? I think it's also...
SPEAKER_06: a lot of physical and mental preparations. But it is, of course. What can happen that day that it may not be your day? Or do we say this when we lose as an excuse? I'm not talking about you ladies, but generally, that, oh, I had a bad day, you know, or maybe the guy was better that day, you know. Listen, I'm just having a friendly conversation, just trying to find out
SPEAKER_04: bad day, because you ladies are this level. I think we have no excuse to have a bad day. It doesn't have to be an excuse, really. But if you believe that I have the power to be the winner and I lose, then I have to explain for myself that I lost now because I had the
SPEAKER_04: a bad day and my opponent had a a good day but if it was the opposite what's the bad day good day like like when you say like bed day or good day it sounds like like you didn't perform well that day but what if you perform and the opponent was still better yeah but then it's if you are mentally ready and you have been like prepared really good you have no pain you have
SPEAKER_04: You have really nothing to put into your head that, oh, this can go wrong. You are like on top of...
SPEAKER_06: of yourself and you believe in yourself and everything, then if you lose, then you can't say it was a bad day, really. But if you wake up, I have a headache, I'm tired. That's why I say that preparation, that's what I meant. When you are professional, you are going to a world title match. And this world title is heavier than any titles in history.
SPEAKER_06: going like, and then you would have an excuse. But if it is up to you, then I think we all need to be responsible for going there healthy. Of course, sometimes we get injured and everything. And what is your opinion about your chance, Fiya? I know that you like when you are confident and I want to be confident too, but
SPEAKER_04: i i i want to say that it is 60 40 percent for me and and that is based on like your feeling okay yeah my my my good preparation
SPEAKER_06: Okay, so you are saying that it means that you feel like you progressed more than she did in the last three years. But I can't really know. Okay, why did you lose that one round, you know, according to you? Did you make a mistake? You didn't know her? She surprised you? You underestimated her? Or she was just... And what was the difference in the final and super final?
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, she really surprised me, really. Because it was a good match for me, really. I had the start and I was on my side, but she took it and then she...
SPEAKER_04: uh gas me out and and win so it was fair it was nothing like uh i i can i can't say anything uh more than that and then what was the the like change you know for the final and super final i wanted to beat her
SPEAKER_04: First match, when you lost, you didn't want to beat her? No, but I was surprised. But then the second match, I knew what I needed to put in. Did you attack to different spots or something, or you were just more serious? I'm not really that... I'm not a tactic puller. I just put some more... Isn't Janis training you? He is, but not the tactics.
SPEAKER_04: He is good at that one, mostly. I know, I think he gave up that long ago because I haven't learned. So he just gives me training schedules and leaves me alone with that because I probably do everything wrong also. He gave up on that. I don't know, you are a great puller. But the thing is that you are also East vs West left-arm champion. Yeah.
SPEAKER_06: and you couldn't do any change to change the result. And do you think that, okay, what would be your chance against her if it was a left arm match, you know, like three months later? Then it's opposite. Then it's 60-40. Oh, really? So you believe that she may be the best left hand under 70 kilos in the world? Yes.
SPEAKER_06: Oh, but, but do you, do you want to find out? Yes. Okay. Okay. Okay. So, because that match also has to happen and I think that Gabriella versus Barbara left arm also need to happen. Yeah. Um, and Ellen, let's listen to the three years ago from you this time. Can you say it again? Okay.
SPEAKER_06: What happened three years ago, you beat her once and she beat you twice. So we now listen from her point of view. And what was from your point of view? Did you believe you could beat her when you come to the competition or you surprised yourself? No, I believe that I could. You believe that? Okay. Yes. It was only in my mind back then.
SPEAKER_02: Back then only or even now? No, every time I compete against her. At that time, everything felt great, especially in both arms, but especially in the left arm, since I won in the left arm. In the right arm, you won. How long was the match?
SPEAKER_02: Maybe around 30 seconds. Okay. Yeah. And where do you think that you made any mistake or she adjusted? How do you view the final matches? The first final match, I am proud of myself. I was proud of myself that I stopped her and could pull over to my side and win.
SPEAKER_02: And the other match, I don't know what happened. She was super fast and I wasn't ready, I think. Okay, okay, okay. You beat her in the qualification and she beat you in the final. Okay, so she didn't send you to the B-side in the first match.
SPEAKER_02: okay and how was the first match the first match i think fia won easy in the in the qualifications and in the finals i wanted to give her a match and then i yes i ended up in it i turned to 1-1 and
SPEAKER_06: Another question is that you guys, you ladies pulled the left arm first, right? Yeah. Yes. Okay. When you beat her left arm, did it like probably like it made your belief even stronger to beat her with right arm as well? Yes. Yeah. And this was the same tout even before the matches or left arm just made it
SPEAKER_02: more possible in your mind? Yes, I think my left arm, it has always been, in my opinion, it's my best arm. Oh, okay. Yes. And another question, Elin. Last three years, how much do you think you progressed? I don't know. It's hard to say. But you progressed, right? For sure.
SPEAKER_02: But if I think against FIIA in that way, I have progressed a lot. Not just in strength, but much in technique also. I think I'm smarter at the table. Smarter than your opponents? Or smarter than yourself before?
SPEAKER_06: Smarter than I was before. Okay. Maybe smarter than my opponents. Who knows? I'm not sure. But for sure, not more experienced than your opponent. Sorry, what did you say? Probably not more experienced than your opponent. No. No. Yeah. Okay. It will be a great match. Yeah. We will see. Yeah.
SPEAKER_06: You say 60-40. And how many title matches you won? Left arm once and the right arm once, right? Yes. Yes. So you beat Niki Sheva with left arm and Malik with right arm. Yes. Yeah. Anyways, so do you ladies think that there is one more person that could be a challenge?
SPEAKER_04: uh to you ladies on this earth just think about everyone do you think it is under 70 kilos uh yes of course i believe so uh i i think the the like the light girls are uh scary like dimitrina and karu are
SPEAKER_04: Great. Dimitrina and who? Carolina Pettersson. Ah, Carolina. Dimitrina is around 60 kilos, so under 70. But you know, she could do much damage in 70 kilo. If she competed at Worlds in 70 kilo, I think she would show that she's really a 70 kilo girl. So do you think that as a 60 kilo person,
SPEAKER_04: she can pull you ladies and can be a problem i believe so i don't believe so too and caro have pulled with her so she she have more uh on her feet than i do but if she says so then i believe her
SPEAKER_06: Okay, Jeremy Browning and family says, Do you all know who Andre the Giant was? If so, would you consider Levan to be the Andre of arm wrestling? I don't. Oh, so we need you are saying that we need to call Levan the
SPEAKER_06: I don't know. I think that that guy was the WWE guy. I think we are, if it is, then I think we are more serious support. So Levan can be compared with like most likely someone like Alexander Karalin or something, you know, maybe Alexander
SPEAKER_06: had a better career, but Levan still had some time in front of him. John Augustine said, to Eden, the most beautiful arm-wrestling nation in the world. And then, of course, a super chat comes from no surprise. Just you tell me, who can that be? No surprise. Who would be very, very interested in this match? Erkin Ige.
SPEAKER_06: Yeah, Swedish armwrestling television. This match has been on demand in Sweden for years, so I'm happy that I'm here to see this. Big fan of both Elin and Fiya, yeah. I know that you are a big fan of female armwrestling and also especially for the ladies from Sweden, yeah.
SPEAKER_06: My first favorite ever female arm master was Heidi Anders. Yeah, I was inspired by her. Because in those years, like after especially Russians got involved, Russians and Ukrainians got involved, there were not many ladies from West Side
SPEAKER_06: You know, and like West Europe, I can say, I don't know. It's not really West, but I'm saying that not Soviet, all Soviet countries. And Heidi Anderson was very dominant and like she was very impressive. And then I think next Malin and you. Yeah. And then the other ladies started. But I think there was one lady
SPEAKER_04: Anna Pettersson or something? Have you guys ever heard of her? Yeah, I met her. You met her? Not on a competition table, but I met her with Andreas Rundström a couple of years ago and we trained a little bit and she was still very explosive.
SPEAKER_06: Andreas is also another legend that we need to mention when we have two ladies from Sweden. Andreas is probably maybe the biggest male legends from Sweden.
SPEAKER_04: Definitely. He had a very interesting style with the arm open like this. I was so impressed with him. He was my inspiration when I was a kid.
SPEAKER_04: you couldn't compete in a higher weight class than two above your own for a while yeah and he I I know he put in like a a big weight under his shirt yes he did and then he beat everyone in that class too and it was like
SPEAKER_06: He was a star. Yes, yes, he was. And he has never been a loud showman or something. He just goes there. Very quiet guy. I mean, I don't even know how many times I heard something from him. He was usually quiet and with a beard in his hand, you know? Yeah. Another guy to mention.
SPEAKER_06: that really served a lot to Swedish armwrestling is Charles Minnell. Charlie Minnell, sorry. Charlie Minnell. I don't know, Elin, if you met his time, but he had the best armwrestling websites. What was it? Armwrestling World or what was it? World of Armwrestling? World of Armwrestling.
SPEAKER_06: Yeah, I've been on that website. Ellen knows better than we do. Ellen, who trained you? How did you get involved? I know that Heidi Andersen was training the kids and everything. Are you one of those kids? No, I come from another community. It's about 70 kilometers away from Storuman, where Heidi is training.
SPEAKER_02: I come from Sosle and I started armwrestling almost 15 years ago. I started when I was 9 years old. So you are 24 this year? 23 this year, so 14, but almost. So you are still at U23? Yes. And do you plan to compete or you just focus on the senior? Senior.
SPEAKER_06: A lot of really strong U23 pullers, they just skip the Ute and then just directly compete. Okay, sorry, who was your trainer again? My father helped me in the beginning. Was he armwrestler as well? No. Oh, okay.
SPEAKER_02: we learned from each other and we helped each other and yes so it's big thanks to him that i won the europeans in 2015.
SPEAKER_02: Okay. And, and, and, but he was your trainer and, but which club did you go? Like, did you just train with your father and then compete? I got to a club in Sorsele called Sorsele Armsport and we started to train there. And after a while, it was just me that was still training arm wrestling in the club. So.
SPEAKER_02: me and my father started to train with each other and we started to drive to Storuman 70 kilometers and yeah in that it started when you go to Storuman did you learn anything from there as well yes of course a lot and who helped you everyone or just everyone yes and
SPEAKER_02: They have an arm wrestling school there. And so I pulled with the guys who were much older than me. But it was great for me in the beginning to go to Storuman. Another question, Elin. You were 13 and you won under 18 years old category. So how did this happen? When I ask you this, like,
SPEAKER_02: strong and then or like what what do you think that the reason was I I don't remember anyone 13 years yeah I think yeah it was it was much genetically back then also but we had also trained a lot of course yes of course yes but uh when I was a kid I was much stronger than everyone else
SPEAKER_06: Even before armwrestling, you were very strong. That's what I was guessing. I just wanted to ask here because that's not normal, you know, because when you competed in 2015, armwrestling was already well established and Russians were competing. Everyone was competing and you just go in there.
SPEAKER_06: But from 13 to 18, you actually grow, you know, like you are, like, I don't want to say you were like a kid, you know, 13 years old, you'd be 18 years old, like a young girl, you know, like, imagine that, like, you are still even two years younger than top limit of the U15. Imagine that today someone 13
SPEAKER_06: especially with your genetics. I usually stir the pot between the opponents. I try to hype the event.
SPEAKER_06: I think that this is a beautiful competition and I'm very excited for the armwrestling world, you know, that two ladies that deservingly, you know, pulling for the world title. And I kind of really don't see anyone close.
SPEAKER_06: long, but I need to be like witnessing, you know, how this person can do. Anyway, so let's talk about some other matches. Do you ladies, okay, Elin, Fia usually don't follow everything. So it's okay. We got used to, but do you follow armwrestling or do you like that?
SPEAKER_06: their own and some just are fan that follows everything so where are you I think I focus on my own okay so I just asked is in advance so that I'm trying to have an idea like about the prediction you know if I will have another fear incidents or
SPEAKER_06: Okay, let me go. Let me go and start. Listen, ladies, if you don't have much information about the match, you don't have to, I mean, answer. So you can say that I'm not familiar. So Wallace Dilley, Ricard Bornemann. I don't know of them. Ellen, no? No.
SPEAKER_06: Okay, this one. Where are they from? One is from US, the other one from Australia. Okay. Okay. And Fia Rasek versus Elin Janheim. Oh, that match I know. Okay. So, what is, you have to say the prediction of that match. Elin, you can. You said already, you said 60-40. Now it's Elin's turn. Yeah, I'm just teasing you ladies, you know.
SPEAKER_06: And Ryan Bellinger versus Alan Ford. I don't know about them. I don't know. Where are they from? One is US, other one is Canada. Okay. And Artem Morozov versus Alex Kurdecha, right arm. Don't tell me you don't know them. I know this match. I know them. Okay. Let's go. Right arm this game.
SPEAKER_04: I think Morozov wins that one. Does it have any base, like in a technical way? I just think of Alex like a left arm puller. I've mostly seen him pull left arm, I think.
SPEAKER_04: in these events so i'm i and and morozov is a right arm puller and are on the top uh list so i i'd be i think okay
SPEAKER_06: a left arm world champion before he lost against Laletin. You were there that night. So his left arm is also very good. And Alex, yeah, he pulled some right arm matches and left arm matches. So you believe Artem is going to win. And Elin? Yes, I also think so. You think Artem is going to win? Yes. Do you have any opinion about which fashion he can beat him? No.
SPEAKER_06: Inside, maybe. Yeah, okay. Pauline versus Arsen Kacataryan. Then I know Pauline, at least. Where is the other guy from? He's Armenian, but lives in the US. And in his last Supermatch, he beat Andrei Sharkevich in Arlington.
SPEAKER_06: East versus West. Was it an easy match or a hard match? I think he lost one round and then he won the following rounds. This is how I remember. And Pauline has been also very good lately. He won some matches, he lost some. He lost against Khrushchev and Krasimir and then he beat lately David Samusha. Yeah, that's what I remember.
SPEAKER_04: Then I will give a shot for Pauline then. Okay. And Elin? I don't know them. You don't know them? You don't know Pauline? No. Okay. Matt Mask versus Irakli Zrakashvili. Left arm. I think Irakli will win. Even though Matt Mask has also been crazy...
SPEAKER_06: strong on his last event, but I think Irakli will win. Okay, and you know them, Elin? Yes, I think Irakli will win. Okay, looks like you and Fia will agree about the predictions. Okay, let's go to the next one.
SPEAKER_06: Okay, this one is Joseph Maranto versus Ivan Portela. I don't know. Okay. Sorry. Do ladies know Manuel Battaglia from Italy? No. No. He's a world champion, super heavyweight champion. Yeah, for sure you ladies are not really following, but you are just focused on your own goals. Yeah.
SPEAKER_06: Yeah, he's pulling against Wagner Bortolato. I'm sure you guys know Wagner. Yeah, Wagner I know. Yes.
SPEAKER_06: let me see if ellen knows wagner or not ellen doesn't know wagner portalazzo he's from brazil you have seen him he's like okay yeah pulling like big trash cans and pressing he's like super maybe i have seen him yeah every match he's trying to break my arm wrestling table and i think his nickname is um
SPEAKER_06: yeah and yeah you okay maybe i have seen him okay okay okay and michael todd versus georgie deserano alien you can ellen knows michael todd but i know michael todd but not the other
SPEAKER_04: Not that this is Elinor? No. So I don't know. Okay, yeah. We need to make Elin become an armwrestling fan as much as how great armwrestler she is. She will be like me. She will notice some matches when she is in these events and see some and then she learns about those pullers and then the rest will just...
SPEAKER_06: How about you, Fiya? Do you know Giorgi Di Zerano? No. Come on. You don't know? Did Di Zerano, like... Yes, I know. Yes. Okay. Okay. But any opinion? Who did he pull last time?
SPEAKER_06: He pulled left arm against Kamil. And he lost. Yeah, he lost, yeah. Kamil is a very dangerous player. Yes, yes. You know Kamil, right, Fiya? Yes, yes. Okay, okay. Yes. But did he pull right?
SPEAKER_04: I mean, he pulled right arm, he beat Revas, but he lost against Vitaly Laletin. And this is a right match? Right arm match, yeah. Michael Todd is always hard to predict because he's so difficult on the table. So anything can happen.
SPEAKER_06: He beat a lot of guys that I thought would beat him. So you probably feel yourself closer to Michael because you know him and you speak English and you support Michael. Am I correct? You can give that to Michael. Okay. Okay. How about this match, Elin? Left arm.
SPEAKER_06: You know the guy, right? You know the Devon guy? Yes, and I know Alex. You don't know Alex? Yes, I've heard of him. You just predicted his match against Artur Morozov, right? Yeah, but... Oh, we don't know it. So you don't know Alex Kurdeca? Yes, I know Alex. Okay, Alex Kurdeca and Devon. So you are on this card, but you... Okay, okay, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: And who do you think is going to win? Alex and Devon. But this is left arm. Yes. And he's pulling first Devon and then second Morozov. I think Alex is going to win.
SPEAKER_06: Alex is going to beat Devon. Okay, and Fia, not everyone can be a champion, Fia. No, I know. Listen, let's clear that thing. When Devon lost against Gennady, you told Devon, Devon, don't worry, not everyone can be a champion.
SPEAKER_06: And, but it sounded like, you know, you are not good enough to be champion, but probably you meant, probably you meant that like two guys are pulling and one needs to win, one needs to lose. That's what you meant? Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We have talked this through. He's fine with me now. I know. I know. I know. But it's still funny to remember that, you know? Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: No, but I think Devon will win. I'm glad this isn't a real competition with points and stuff because then I would... Say again?
SPEAKER_06: I'm glad this isn't a competition to know all the predictions or to score all the predictions right. Yeah, see next time we plan, like when your ladies are in the card again next time, like whoever did not study the rest of the cards and
SPEAKER_06: about the six matches, you will start the match like this. Yeah. Yeah, I would say something like that. Yeah. Okay. Levan Saginashvili versus Ermes Kasparini. Elin, don't tell me you don't know them. I know them. Okay, good. Let's go. First of all, who do you think is going to win?
SPEAKER_02: Or who has more chance? And second question is, who do you want to win? I think Lewand is going to win. And who do you support? I don't know. But I think Lewand is going to win, so maybe I support Lewand. I don't know. Did you see their first match? No. No?
SPEAKER_04: Okay, let's go for you. I also think, how is Levan doing now? He have been hurt or have been sick or something? No. He just have not been competing because he have not had any... No, no, he pulled against Jerry Cadoret last December. And as you know, Levan is pulling twice a year.
SPEAKER_06: Some people says, hey, you know, Levan, you're pulling like very seldom, you know, it's not good, you know. And then when you said Levan match, they are like, oh, this is a mismatch. I mean, these are the best guys, you know. So from one side, they say Levan is not pulling often. And from other side, I mean, just say that Levan is pulling four times a year. Who are you going to set him against, you know?
SPEAKER_04: Yes, I understand. There are a few people that, you know, can have a chance against him. So how can you really expect Levan to pull, like, so many matches, you know? Yeah. Yeah, go ahead. How it is to be best. It was a great match they had last time, I believe. But I think Levan...
SPEAKER_04: will win but then it would be this is always the hard part being the best also that everyone kind of hoping that you will lose some day and it it would be fun for everyone if he lost against except for him maybe against Hermes
SPEAKER_06: By the way, Devon wrote a message. Devon says it still hurts fear. Oh, I'm sorry. That is on you. They will stay there like till the end of the time, you know. Yes. Yeah. And so you are supporting Hermes? Yeah. And do you think Hermes is favorites?
SPEAKER_06: I don't think he's the favorite though. But do you think he has a chance? Yes. He has a chance, okay. Yes. And did you watch their last match? Yes. You saw, right? Yeah. And were you surprised those a few times that you know... Yeah, it was a great match. He did really good. So hopefully he...
SPEAKER_04: believes more in himself now that he he he have the he have the chance to take a win ellen uh before we finish who has been your favorite arm master heidi anderson since i started heidi anderson yes oh yeah when i started she was my biggest idol um

SPEAKER_02: Elin, do you know who is Irina Makeva? Yes. Okay, what do you think about her? I also had her as an idol when Svea started to talk about her, but it changes sometimes because when Irina was competing, I really liked to see her compete and perform.

And this young lady was already great three years ago. And now from 20 to 23, I remember how much I progressed. And I only can...
