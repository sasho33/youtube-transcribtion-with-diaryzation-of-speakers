SPEAKER_04: I know a lot of news that you will be in my corner and you will be helping me to smash Alex we are live now and is Morozov here not yet hello Paolo it is always refreshing to see you always
SPEAKER_04: Same here. Thank you. How are you? Good, good. And Alex, you? How are you? Yes, glad to see you guys. Only seven days to the biggest event of the history in armwrestling. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. It will be incredible. This is the, I think, first time Hermes, Levan and Devon on the same card. Yes, yes.
SPEAKER_04: Those are the probably three top names. They are number one, number two, number three, right? Yeah. And let's wait for Morozov to come and then we start a deep conversation. How was the preparation? I know you are helping Robert, Paolo.
SPEAKER_02: Yes, I'm helping as much as I can or as little as he needs. Yeah, no, everything is fine. I don't see any, you know, hiccups. Maybe Robert does, but yeah, it was... I'm local, so it's a little easier for me, you know, to connect with people. But otherwise, everything is good. Hello. Hello, Artem, how are you?
SPEAKER_04: Great to see you. Great to see you. Thank you so much. Okay, so let's start. Let's start. Okay. I'm sharing. Okay, Alex, let's start with you. Alex, I mean, this is probably one of the biggest challenges in the history.
SPEAKER_00: Yes, yeah, for sure. Left arm pulling Devon, right arm pulling Morozov. And what do you think your chances are? You know, first of all, yeah, it's a big chance, big opportunity and big responsibility. Both guys are awesome. They are different, different styles. Like Devon, it's more about, you know, tricky games, about to not go on the catch any trick.
SPEAKER_00: And Artem is a pure power, very fast on the ride. Maybe I don't say like fastest, but it's also always fast game and about big level of horsepower with Artem. So for sure, I will get 100% of everything I have. And what can I say? I'm now training every day. Some of guys already know that I'm now in the best shape of my life.
SPEAKER_00: And the biggest challenge was in front of me. Yeah, it's true. It's the biggest challenge to pull left and right with two beasts like these guys. Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure, for sure. And Artyom, how is everything, my friend? Everything is very good. Everything is perfect. He's ready to go.
SPEAKER_02: Ready to go. And Artem, what do you expect from this match? He said, I'm expecting that I will really like the actual pulling. He said what? He said that he's expecting that he will like very much the actual process of arm wrestling.
SPEAKER_04: Artur, do you expect this to go the same as the last time with the left arm match? No, I think it will be different.
SPEAKER_01: Well, my left hand is different from Alex's left hand is different from the right one. So it will be... But I'm 100% ready. I hope it will work out. We'll show a good fight.
SPEAKER_04: Alex's left and right is different and Artyom's left and right is different. And he thinks that it's going to be a different match, but he hopes that it's going to be a beautiful arm wrestling. Beautiful arm wrestling, okay. Okay, so he will continue the same way, like Vitaly's match, not talking too much before the event.
SPEAKER_01: You will continue in the same spirit as before the match with Vitalik. You won't talk too much before the match, right? Well, I don't know. I don't feel like talking much. I just want to show. I will talk later, when I grow up, like Levan, probably. Then we will troll each other in pairs.
SPEAKER_02: Artyom saying that, you know what, it's not really me when it's becoming of talking, let's arm wrestle. And he said, when I'm gonna grow up, like, I don't know who, like Levan maybe, and then we will gonna troll each other. Okay, why is that? Why he needs to be like Levan? His personality will change or he will be more confident?
SPEAKER_01: Artyom says, will your personality change if you grow up like Levan, or will you just be more confident? Well, you know, there will hardly be any changes inside me, but I think it will be possible to talk a little.
SPEAKER_02: Artyom was saying that it's unlikely that it's gonna change something inside of me, but on that level, I probably can yapping a little bit, you know. It's about the confidence, probably. To talk, you need to have some kind of background. So that you have at least some kind of illusion of unbeatability.
SPEAKER_02: yeah it's it's uh artem is saying the yeah he he said that uh to make that you know a lot of conversation and showing and all this beautiful stuff he said you need a background and uh you need to be uh to have at least an illusion that you are unbeatable
SPEAKER_02: Okay, so only the unbeatable people should talk trash. At least they have an illusion that they are unbeatable. Okay, so either you need to be that good or...
SPEAKER_04: Alex, my friend, if we just go a little bit back, I should say that you had big goals and you still have big goals, but if I just go, you know, rewind a little bit and then
SPEAKER_04: After some time, your first match was against Morozov for title. You lost that match, but everyone said that, Alex, you did a great job, and you really gained the respect of everyone with your well-roundedness, the way, I mean, you, I mean, I would say for myself that you showed hook, you showed shoulder press, you showed side pressure, you showed endurance, explosiveness, everything in that match.
SPEAKER_04: But then you had a match with Swetko and then you had a very big opportunity to pull Levan if you could have passed Jerry. According to social media, after you beat Swetko, people
SPEAKER_04: said that you were favourites but the things didn't go as you expected and then the next match you lost against Dadikyan and now you have a huge challenge, huge challenge like left arm Devon who is coming back to his old shape and right arm you're pulling Morozov but Morozov that you are pulling right now doesn't look the same as the Morozov that you pulled first time.
SPEAKER_04: is just much bigger use of his performance against vitality and from other people we also hear that you are in incredible shape and my question is that are you do you have like fear that like do you have pressure on you that you can't afford to lose any more matches
SPEAKER_00: You know, the answer is very easy. Very easy this time. Because sometimes when during preparation you have some troubles, like you have something which don't give you possibility to understand that you did the best way. Sometimes you do good, but you see some results, but you are not going to do proud of your training process. This time I may be going to like
SPEAKER_00: Everything or nothing. My preparation was also on everything. I don't have any fear. We were having a podcast with Devon like 10 minutes ago. He knows that I beat all my personal records this time.
SPEAKER_00: and i can say truly like that now i'm in the best shape of my life sometimes in some exercise before i was but now uh the reality that's maybe i'm most completed of course in the future maybe i will beat my version of this but for now i see you have never been this strong
SPEAKER_00: yes this is the reality never been this strong never been this endurable never been so fast and never been so like you know in different exercise or in such results like now so uh i can say thanks god that so my training process was such successful and even guys if they beat me that means that they are really better and nothing else
SPEAKER_00: That's why I'm not so confident, but I'm really happy to be in this shape and go with the advice.
SPEAKER_02: Let me translate real quick for Artyom, just the conclusion of it, okay? Artyom, Engin asked Lesha, he said, your previous career was so bad that you quickly moved forward, and there was even such an opportunity that if you beat Jerry or Kaderet, you would fight with Levan, but unfortunately, everything went wrong, and then there were a few losses, etc.
SPEAKER_02: There were some injuries and so on. He said, how is the process going now? Lyosha said, no, this time everything is different. The training process was not completed with any flaws or shortcomings. The training and preparation went almost perfectly. I really broke all my personal records.
SPEAKER_02: And he said, I'm in very good shape, not only in strength, but also in speed. And he said, well, there was really a great preparation, and I have a very, very good shape. He said, even if I lose, and it happens that the guys win, it just means that they are better than me, and not that I didn't have something there. So he said, I'm ready, and we'll see. Well, you're right, I'm absolutely with him.
SPEAKER_01: Artyom is saying, yeah, absolutely respect and that's why I said that, you know, a lot of talking is not really taking place here.
SPEAKER_02: lot of respect to alex for taking uh two matches and we will see he said if it would be jerry maybe i would talk a little bit more but with alex i would not okay why with jerry because jerry would not take any left-hand matches
SPEAKER_04: say again because jerry would not take any left hand matches okay okay and okay so alex basically basically i understand you are just like going all the way and then basically you say yes engine i cannot afford any more losing and you realize it and then that is why you are going for
SPEAKER_04: I mean, all way that you can do, you know, your best. Yeah. Yeah. And how do you see your chances against these guys? I know you don't like to, you try not to talk so much. Last time when we did the podcast about like, you kind of save everything to the table.
SPEAKER_04: And I don't know after that you started to talking or not, but like basically, are you going to beat these guys?
SPEAKER_00: You know, this like very, very also easy answer. I'm going that like only for winning in mindset. I'm already did it. But we like I also respect guys who understand the reality. Yeah. Reality that today you can be the strongest and like second day, even stronger guy come and you don't know that he is stronger, but he shows that he is stronger. Yeah. Sometimes be
SPEAKER_00: surprised by somebody's shape. A lot of guys tell me now that Devon is not so strong on the left. I see his preparation. He sees my preparation. We motivate each other very much. I know his level and he's not an easy guy, for sure. Not just because of his technique, not just because of his tricks and understanding of arm wrestling and how to not go to the strong side of his opponent, but
SPEAKER_00: He really trained like every day. Every day he trained like the guys holding him by two hands. Artem already shows to all world of armwrestling his level when he was pulled with Vitaly. Because that day, a lot of guys were thinking that probably Vitaly will open the wrist. Maybe like Artem will hold a little bit. But a lot of guys were thinking... A lot of people waited for flash fits.
SPEAKER_00: Yes, like a flash pin or maybe pin not so like one second, but two seconds and that's it. But he shows to all vote his level. And this is already the answer. Like this guy can do the same on the right.
SPEAKER_04: So it's never a good way to underestimate the style or the strength of your opponents. I'm really happy and I'm really thankful to you. I'm sure you are not underestimating them. Alex, I know you are not underestimating them, but whenever you see them and compare with your current shape, do you feel confident?
SPEAKER_00: Yes, like I said, thanks to God, thanks to my training process, I'm really happy about my shape. So I'm ready to everything. If guys stronger, this, you know, upper power, they stronger and that's it. But I'm really happy about my shape. And the thing is that Devon had many matches with left arm. Yes, he took them seriously, but it was not really so seriously.
SPEAKER_04: And right now, I think there is one thing that we need to consider that he is also preparing to be reaching his heavies, you know, for another goal, you know, like again to reach Levan. But on the way, there are some other guys and the first of them will be Vitaly Laletin.
SPEAKER_04: And I think that right now he's also getting into a crazy shape for that match. And then you are on his way while he's walking that way here. And do you agree, Paolo, that? Yeah, last time I saw Devon in Texas, Arlington. Yeah, he is different now. He is huge. He usually, when you look at him, he usually looks skinny.
SPEAKER_02: not anymore not anymore he's big and thick and uh yeah I mean it's a very serious opponent when it's uh you know Devon is devil I would not underestimate him and I still think that Alex is much more powerful than Devon and have more abilities left uh left-handed but uh
SPEAKER_00: take him serious. I believe that he is a very serious opponent, very serious. For sure, for sure. Like, you know, we always, all the preparation now, we on the contact with him and I see he's also take it very serious. Like, he's probably will be the best left hand of all last years because he really train it now. And what he doing on the practice impressed me.
SPEAKER_04: That's why it was like motivation to me to beat my personal records. Pablo, do you think that, do you think that like you see Vicali, every event stronger and stronger and stronger. You saw Michael Todd's, you know, last shape. He was crazy. He lost last two matches, but we saw, you know, that he really, he really took the risk of Lallatin and he really gave like hard match. People doesn't understand, but to Hermes,
SPEAKER_04: According to Hermes, he was that close. And I was right there, you know. And now you see Alex is saying he's in his best shape. And Devon is getting bigger. And Hermes, you saw the things that he's lifting.
SPEAKER_04: And we saw Artem Morozov in Georgia, Tbilisi, again. So do you think that armwrestling has reached a crazy level, Pavlo? It is. It is. And it's... Five years ago, I thought this is it. We are at the cosmic level and there is no place to go anymore.
SPEAKER_02: uh when we had uh you know top five oh top eight i'm sorry i thought this is it you know this is up again and now when we have east versus west creating even uh more motivation for the guys and now i understand that there's a sky is the limit you know it's it's it's still glowing and the levels are crazy yeah 123 kilo vitality gave that one first round match to le one at that time i was just in romania
SPEAKER_04: I saw even the junior competition, youth competition, crazy level, crazy, crazy level. And those guys are very well-rounded and aggressive, you know, and it's a tested event. And it's just like level is just crazy, crazy. Like our arm wrestling just broke its chains and they're just running to the future. Because the time came where the older generation became trainers
SPEAKER_04: And, you know, there is a professional trainers available. So the younger generation starting earlier and they are by the junior years, by 18, they are becoming monsters already. My friends, my opinion is a bit different. I think it is the East versus West that really inspires all the kids all over the world. And finally, there is something.
SPEAKER_04: that all young people say, I want to be like Devon, I want to be like Hermes, I want to be like Morozov or Alex or Levan. So there are a lot of right now, like if I would ask to every guy, junior, youth guy or sub-junior guy in Romania, who is your favourite armwrestler?
SPEAKER_04: I guarantee you 95% of them will be some of those guys from the East versus West stage. And then I think that East versus West stage, these guys are pulling against each other. It really makes them crazy strong. They just meet, they see their mistakes, they go home, they do the homework, come back stronger, and then the other one learns, everyone learns. So it is, how do you call in English, the iron sharpens iron?
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, it is exactly what's happening. Okay, Morozov, Arthur Morozov, you don't want to talk, you just say you're prepared, you will do your best and everything. So how is your shape right now? Do you think that your shape is now as good as your Tbilisi shape or...?
SPEAKER_02: He says, since you don't want to talk so much with us, let's talk about your current form, how good it is. Tell us, what's your form, do you think it's at the same level as when you were in Tbilisi, or maybe even better? You know, I just kept my right hand after Tbilisi. Of course, I managed to add something.
SPEAKER_01: I didn't do anything. Well, as always, in principle. I was worried about something, I didn't do anything. I did what didn't bother me. I added something, even a little bit. In good form, I can't say that I'm top. Because I'm still far from being top, I think I'm still young. 18 years old, Pavlo, remember, right? I remember, I remember.
SPEAKER_01: That's one of the reasons why I don't want to talk too much, because why waste energy on these conversations, trash talk and so on. We don't go to fight each other to answer for words, we just go out to fight. And our task is to tune in when we go out to fight.
SPEAKER_01: to let all the energy into the mood. Because when you talk a lot, then it's hard to turn on the berserk mode.
SPEAKER_02: Artem is saying that his form is good and he's been keeping his right arm after Tbilisi on a constant level. And in some of the aspects he even gained a little bit. In some of the aspects where maybe some of the issues prevent him from doing something, he's not, but still on a level. And he said, I believe that this is not my top, top shape yet.
SPEAKER_02: that I have a lot of time and he said 18 years. I will tell you the background of this when we've been together at East vs. West 8 in Istanbul. Artyom was a little sick with a stomach and he was a little bit upset that he lost and I walked to him and I'm like, Artyom, you know that you're 18 years younger than me. Can you imagine how much time you have? And I'm still here.
SPEAKER_02: And you are still getting stronger, Paolo. And I'm still getting stronger. And that's what he remembers now. And he said, I have lots of time. And I believe that my best ever shape is ahead. And he also said about trash talk, he said, you know what? I don't like trash talk because I accumulate my energy to turn on my berserk regime at the table. Not right now. I understand. And Artem, what is...
SPEAKER_01: What chances do you think Alex has against Devon? I think Alex has more chances than Devon himself. I hope that Alex will have the same endurance as we have in the fight with him. He has a tall arm, so it will be more comfortable for him to fight Devon. That's why I give Alex more chances to win.
SPEAKER_02: Artyom, saying that Alex's chances are better to win than Devin's chances to win. And he said that because of Alex's long liver and long arms, he will be very comfortable on a table with Devin. And he said that I believe that Alex's endurance will be the same as our match with Alex. And he said then, you know, the chances are higher than Devin's. And he believes that Alex will win.
SPEAKER_04: And guys, by the way, East vs. West 1 was on June 12, 2021. And today is the June 12, 2025. In four years, all together, how far have we come? Incredible results in such a short period. Yes, I saw it too. I fought right from the second.
SPEAKER_01: Artyom says that he started at the second one. Second one, yeah. Left arm Tobias, right arm Prudnik. Yes, yes. I always wanted to fight. I remember that I wrote to you, Engin, that I wanted to fight at every event. But then, due to certain circumstances and people's interference, I couldn't do it. But now I want to hold my word and fight as often as possible.
SPEAKER_02: Artem was saying that he always wanted to participate and pull on every event. He said there were some situations where it's not happening or happening, but now he said, I want to participate more often. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, we are growing and hopefully there will be more and more opportunities. But today I checked almost 250 world-level super matches at the East vs West, 18 events, this will be the 18th, and almost near 150 different athletes. And the strongest ones are surviving.
SPEAKER_04: But these are good opportunities, guys. Arm wrestling on rice, and this stage is the biggest stage. I think that you guys need to really promote yourselves. Because, yes, trash talk is not necessary, but to engage with the fans and to build your own fan base, I think it's necessary.
SPEAKER_02: I will translate for Artyom real quick. Artyom says that today is his birthday, four years ago. Yes, you remember that. He was the first one. He says that more than 150 athletes, about 200 professional matches were held. He says that a lot of work has been done, we are growing, we are getting bigger and bigger. He says that armwrestling is growing very fast.
SPEAKER_02: I believe that you guys should promote yourselves, advertise and develop yourselves. Yes, trash talk is not necessary, but this interaction with your fans, I think he meant social networks and so on, it should be at the level and you need to do it. I'm trying, but...
SPEAKER_01: Again, we have a certain mentality, at least in our country, that you can't afford everything, maybe even education. It's hard to create a career in social media, for example, on Instagram or YouTube.
SPEAKER_02: Artyom is saying, yeah, he said, I understand, but there is some mentality and behavior, you know, expectations connected to our countries where we're just a little bit kind of limited with what we're producing on social media and what we're saying. It's absolutely, we know. No, no, what I mean that it doesn't have to be in certain way.
SPEAKER_04: Athlete can be 100% himself, but just more engagement. People want to know Morozov, not what Morozov would act. You understand? Because nobody's stupid. People understand what is fake, what is real. That's for sure. And I think Morozov as Morozov, Alex Kurdesha as Alex Kurdesha, they should be 100% themselves, but they should show more.
SPEAKER_04: so the people get to know more about them you know yeah okay so okay looks like they both are in great shape and they are ready to fight at the table and so let's talk about some of the other matches alex
SPEAKER_00: What's going to happen between Levan and Hermes? You talked about this before, but... Yeah, but we can continue. This is so interesting, like all the events that we can like all the time imagine how like it will be when, for example, all of us will be sitting in the venue and watching the show.
SPEAKER_00: You know what I want? You know what I want? I want the beautiful arm wrestling show. I want, like, stop and do, and from that moment, like, we'll see something. Because Levan is our king. Like, all the time, he is the strongest. He deserve, well deserve that point. And Armas now have a very, very, very special match. He now, I see in his eyes, he really believe
SPEAKER_00: And he really did great preparation and he really believed because previously it was maybe a little bit unexpected to him what happens during the match previously. But now I see he's going to crash. He's really going to take Levan's hands and he has a plan and he's really confident.
SPEAKER_00: So for me, like to the fan of Hermes, I really want to see an interesting match and I want to see Hermes will stop in any special way, but stop Levan.
SPEAKER_00: and uh from that moment what happened whenever happens i will be happy because i want to see like the collision of 100 power versus 100 power guy the strongest two guys in the world and to see how it can be in a different style i want to see beauty of our mason and i really believe that can be levan is still favorite because it's hard to imagine not so many guys stop at him like devon
SPEAKER_00: Vitaly in 2018 and Ermes was the last guy who was able also to stop and make Levan really, really hard work. So, Ermes is a guy. Ermes is a guy and maybe somebody will tell this is a miracle if he stops him, but I want to believe in that miracle. I want to see that kind of the match. Before the podcast,
SPEAKER_04: maybe 45 minutes before the podcast, and Hermes called me. You know, from time to time he calls me and he talks. And then what he did, he was like, my friend, if he shows his arm like this, it's impossible to make this. It's beautiful. It's beautiful because you see, sometimes... Listen, if you are pulling against Levan, you need to be confident.
SPEAKER_04: You need to be. If you're not confident, I mean, because if you're not confident, you're not going to give your 100%. And we don't even know if anybody's 100% will be ready for Levan. But if you are not confident, you're not giving your all, then forget about it. Forget about it, you know. You firstly need to see the winning, like, really clear in your mind. And after that, like, you go in and you do it without any, you know, thoughts. You just go in and do it.
SPEAKER_01: Artem, do you think that Hermes has a chance against Levan? Yes, I think that Hermes has a big chance. But I will root for him because he is smaller. I always root for those who are smaller, for those who don't root for the others. Everyone roots for Levan. I'm also rooting for Hermes.
SPEAKER_01: It's very easy to root for someone who is already full of strength and is considered invincible. That's why I will root for Hermes. I believe in his victory. I think there are a lot of factors that I take into account. Maybe I'm wrong, but I hope I'm right.
SPEAKER_01: Hermes still managed to stop Levan. Then Levan had a wrist injury. And it was after this injury that he managed to stop Devon in the first round. It's clear that Devon is not Hermes, there are different styles, but I think that Hermes made conclusions from all this.
SPEAKER_01: Plus, Hermes has become 100% stronger since that moment, I think. That is, these weights on training are not enough for anyone. Therefore, here I still give more chances to Hermes, because he does such more specialized exercises for armwrestling.
SPEAKER_01: Free weights, barbells, dumbbells are understandable, but on the blocks, behind the table, it's completely different. I checked it on myself. That's my opinion, I think.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, so Artyom's saying that he personally thinks that Hermes has very good chances and he's going to cheer for Hermes. He said, you know what, it's very easy to cheer for somebody who is stronger and favorite and this is not the case. He said, I'm cheering for Hermes and not too many people cheering for Hermes. Where I stick my five cents and I said, I'm cheering for Hermes too. And he believes that Hermes is getting stronger.
SPEAKER_02: uh he lifting better and he lifting not only three weights but working on the blocks and he said that uh last time uh when levan had the the wrist injury after that injury devon was able to stop him uh so levan is not making as big progress as ermus does and uh he believes that ermus has a very good chance and he believes that he may may win
SPEAKER_02: And that's his opinion. And I want to tell you guys one more thing that Hermes already knows that he can stop him.
SPEAKER_04: Paolo, this is what you are saying or you're still translating? This is what I'm saying. Oh, you are saying, okay. I just added. But I support him. I understand what Paolo says and he said, yeah, I support that too. That he knows already. And I also support Paolo. Yes, listen, whenever I said Michael and Ermes are pulling and the winner pulls against
SPEAKER_04: And then Ermespeed, Michael, he was not sure. He said, Engin, let me pull him end of the year. And then he just came back. He said, let me pull him. So he was not really sure. So I know, I communicate with him all the time. In the beginning, his confidence was 50%. Now he's very confident. He doesn't say like he will 100%, like we'll win.
SPEAKER_04: But he's going there with nothing in his mind except winning. Because I have been following him. And today he said he also checked his health. He said everything is very, very good with my health. Everything. And he was extra happy that he's super healthy and super strong. And I don't know. And the one thing that confuses me, when I had the podcast with Levan and Hermes,
SPEAKER_04: Levan said that he doesn't do the dumbbell wrist curl anymore. He did dumbbell wrist curl before the Devon match, even if it was near to his injury. But now he doesn't do it anymore. You understand? So it doesn't mean that he has a problem or something. Maybe he doesn't want to take risks. But we will see. We will see. I think Devon's pronator may be stronger than Hermes'.
SPEAKER_04: But I think Hermes' back pressure is probably stronger than Devon's, the arm power. And I don't know what would happen if Hermes stops Levan as Devon did on April 20th, 2024. We will see. We will see. I want to ask another question to Artem. Artem, you have reached to...
SPEAKER_04: You are one of those guys that have the East vs. West World title belt, which is the hardest armwrestling award in history to win. And you have that permanently. How do you see, do you have a goal to win that with right arm as well, eventually?
SPEAKER_02: Artyom, you're one of those few people who have a belt from VS and you won it and it's yours forever. What's going on in your head about your right hand? Are there any plans to get to the belt with your right hand? Of course there are. I think any person has such plans.
SPEAKER_02: artem saying that absolutely he said probably every arm wrestler have something like that in his head and he said yeah i am going towards that slowly but yeah absolutely and any question another one uh if you beat alex is there anyone that what would be your next goal whatever i
SPEAKER_02: If it happens that you win against Alex, is there someone else you want to fight with? Or will you just fight with the one I offer you? Or do you still have any ideas and wishes?
SPEAKER_01: No, I don't really care who to fight with. I'm interested in fighting with everyone. It's not that I don't care. I'm interested in fighting with everyone who is higher than me. Yes, it's interesting to take revenge from someone, for example. When you lose to someone, you start to think.
SPEAKER_01: What if I start doing something else for this? And are you interested whether it will work next time or not?
SPEAKER_01: So I want to fight everyone. And you look at the fights of the other athletes who fight, and you begin to roughly understand what you can do against whom. Therefore, it is very interesting with everyone. Will I, for example, be able to fight Michael Todd as effectively as Vitaly or Hermes? Will I be able to fight Levan as effectively as well?
SPEAKER_01: Like Devon, for example. I really want to fight everyone here. I want to fight Cvetko, for example, because I understand that it was possible to fight better that time, but what happened is what happened. I don't regret it, it's the way. My task is just to train.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, so Artem was saying, first of all, yes, absolutely, I want to pull with everybody. First he said it doesn't matter, but then he said, no, no, I will correct myself. I want to pull with everybody who is above me, and it's very interesting to try them all. And then he started...
SPEAKER_02: being a little more particular he said very interesting if I can uh be that official with monster Michael taught the same as Vitalio Hermes it's very interesting if I can uh be that efficient with 11 as a Devon Lord you know he stopped him and he said much revenge why not because it was it's happened
SPEAKER_02: whatever happened happened but now I understand the process and maybe I can do better so he said it's uh it's you know it's the it's the process and it's the journey and he want to try them all absolutely do you know what would be good Alex the winner of your math against Morozo I don't know pulling someone hiring guys
SPEAKER_04: I know that smile on Ergen's face. I don't know. It depends on who is winning the Ermes-Levon match. Maybe not that level, but maybe. I don't know. If Levon wins, maybe against Ermes. If Ermes wins, maybe against someone like Devon. You know, we were talking about that with pleasure. Ermes is always welcome to Polk. You know it.
SPEAKER_00: Do you understand what I'm saying or do you want me to translate it for you? You can help a little.
SPEAKER_02: Yes, Engin made such a clever smile and said, let's make such a trick that the winner of your match between you and Alex can fight with someone a little higher. He said, of course, it depends a little on who wins between Levan and Hermes. For example, if Levan wins, maybe Hermes would have to fight, and if, for example, Hermes wins, then maybe it would be necessary to fight with Varat.
SPEAKER_04: And people are asking about Kirill Sarcev, Sumaev and Brian Shaw. I think that guys like as of now, I mean, like amongst all of them, like Leonidas was like very, very strong guy.
SPEAKER_04: And he is, I think, originally left-handed. And I saw him against unprepared Devon with left arm, you know. And with right arm, I saw him against John. He is probably 50% of his prime. And that is not as easy as you guys are thinking. You know, I talked with Kirill Sarchev. He said he pulled train with Alan Zolev.
SPEAKER_04: And he was amazed by Alonzole, who is an 80-kilo guy, you understand? So the things are not as easy as you are thinking. These guys may never, ever be, like, top 10. You understand? It is, like, it's a totally different thing, you know? There may be, maybe some of them, one of them may be average top 10, but...
SPEAKER_00: Realistically, I don't see that, you know. Anyway, so, okay, Michael Pope versus Dzerhanov. Alex? For me, like, if Michael continue, because for me it was a very big surprise, first round versus Vitaly. Because, like, from my point of view, I was thinking that if Vitaly will win first round, it will be like,
SPEAKER_00: flash pin or he goes deeply near to the pad and after that he goes to the triceps press with flop press but in the according to what i remember michael in the first round was you know keep him in the center i was really surprised about that you know and for me if somebody not with so long forearm and cannot control too much pronation of michael and michael can go outside very very much you know
SPEAKER_00: It's not easy. Like with guys who have shorter forearm. If Gerrano will be faster and goes maybe immediately like somewhere like take a center and goes immediately down by the press. But for me, I don't know why I don't see this. I don't see. I see like Michael will stop. Michael...
SPEAKER_00: will be holding and it's a question how comfortable will be for the round because Vitaly was unexpectedly comfortable with flop press like previously I was not thinking that he can be so good versus Michael I think if Michael stop it will be goes slowly slowly to the Michael side Alex I want to ask you something in between if you would just pause the match on round one just starts
SPEAKER_04: And then, but you never seen the match. And we will tell you this is three seconds after the match started. If I would ask you what would be the score, you would just say that Michael 3-0 for Michael. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: So it was unexpected from the beginning to the end, honestly, like very unexpected. I was not expecting that Vitaly can press so good. And I was not expecting that Michael in the first round can control him in the center. It was a really beautiful match. Yeah, yeah. And your countryman, Artyom. Artyom. The runner for Michael, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I think Michael will be the favorite here, due to his endurance, due to his uncomfortable technique. Because it's enough to come up to Michael, say hello by hand, take him by the right hand and understand that she is some kind of... I don't know, some kind of wooden... Uncomfortable. Uncomfortable, yes. And she doesn't spin, doesn't bend anywhere.
SPEAKER_01: Therefore, it will be difficult for Ziranova. But I will still be rooting for him, because he is my fellow countryman, and we are flying together, together in the USA. We will support each other as much as we can, we will help each other. I hope that Georgiy's training process was not only aimed at developing strength, but also at developing endurance.
SPEAKER_01: Sometimes Duran's endurance is very good. When we fought with him on the right hand, he held very well with a flop. And the endurance was. Sometimes, as you can see, it also leads. Well, let's see. I'm interested to look at this fight. There will still be decided during the fight. The one who is faster behind the table. We know that Michael Todd can
SPEAKER_02: So Artyom is saying that, yes, Michael Todd is probably a favorite in this match, but he will cheer for his countryman because he's his countryman. And he said, you know, it's very interesting match for me because
SPEAKER_02: It very much depends on Tsarinov's shape. Because we saw Tsarinov was in very good shape and very good endurance. Sometimes it was not as good. And Artyom is saying that he was pulling him and he is a very good puller. And sometimes his endurance is on a very good level. He also said that the match may be depending on how fast both opponents can transition on the table. We all know that Michael transitioning is...
SPEAKER_02: amazing and he can move on the table really fast and if there enough will be adjusting uh fast enough then he have a better chances and it depends on the preparation he said that's that's that's the answer okay okay so pauline versus arsene cachetarian um arton you know arsene cachetarian
SPEAKER_01: Yes, yes, yes, I know. He's going to pull against Paul Lin. How do you see this match? Well, Paul Lin is very strong, very tough. But I think the speed will be on the side of Arsene. And I think his upper body is stronger than Paul Lin's wrist.
SPEAKER_01: But it's also a very interesting fight. It's hard. It's hard. Since I didn't watch a lot of athletes, when I'm at an event, I watch Paul Alina's fights. I've seen Arsena Khachatryan a couple of times on the Internet. When he posts a video, I watch it. But they didn't have any common opponents.
SPEAKER_01: to somehow appreciate it. Therefore, it will be very interesting. Artem and Sen...
SPEAKER_02: Artem's saying that this is a very interesting match. And he said that, you know, to be honest, I'm not following the guys like I'm not watching them every day. But I've been watching Pauline a lot at all the events. And he said, I saw quite a few videos of Arsen. And he's thinking that Arsen, even if Pauline is very strong, probably stronger than Arsen, but he thinks that Arsen's top role,
SPEAKER_02: uh will be stronger than Pauline's wrist and he may pull a win through that so he's a kind of slight favorite in Artyom's opinion but he also said it's it's very hard to predict it's very hard to predict he said it's very much I want to see it Alex you know why you already said before for me Pauline um
SPEAKER_00: Now the level is very clear because his match with Rastam gave me some answers about how endurable he is, how strong he is, how good he is inside the game. For me, Rastam is also very special. I understand that it can be the question about the wrist and it can also be about the start position.
SPEAKER_00: can also be like who will be transitioned in the best point to put the power. But for me, in my mind, I see like it will be Pauli. Pablo, I want to ask your opinion about Hermes and Levani.
SPEAKER_02: Last time I've been there when they pulled. I've been literally three meters from the table. I've been there in Dubai at the table. I've been pulling Badulescu there. So it was one of the most amazing matches I saw in my life. And I'm cheering for Hermes. Hermes is my little baby. I love Levan. I still think Levan is favorite in this match.
SPEAKER_02: because it would be stupid not to think that way. But I believe that Hermes today is one and only who can do this. He knows that he can do it. You know what I mean? He knows that. As of today, he probably has the biggest chance. Yes, because he knew how it's done already. He did it already.
SPEAKER_02: narrow his preparation to that niche.
SPEAKER_02: And he's been working on that particular stuff, and he knows what needs to be done. I believe, in my opinion, I'm not sure, I'm following Levan for sure, but in my opinion, there is not much room for Levan to progress anymore. He's probably keeping his form at a certain level, but I don't think that his power and
SPEAKER_04: And overall performance is progressing much. But Hermes, I believe he's 10% better or maybe even 15% from the previous match. And that may make a big difference. So you are one of those guys that believe that Hermes progressed more than Levan since last time? Yes. Okay, okay, okay. But you are saying that Levan is favorite because...
SPEAKER_04: no matter what we talk it's not proven our opinions are not proven it's only opinion so if we go by what is proven we need to go with levan but with the opinions things may have changed
SPEAKER_02: Well, yeah, only stupid people doesn't change their minds and their opinions, right? But I believe that Levan did some homework too because he already been in a situation where he was out of, you know, breath. And I believe that he made some adjustments preparing for this match too. Not only power, but endurance and everything else. We will see it.
SPEAKER_04: Last time Hermes was going to that match, he was like, Engin, if I stop him one round or if I win one round, you know, that was his mindset. So now it's totally different, you know. Yeah, he... Yep. And I believe... Okay. And Alex and Devin? Ah, okay. Devin is extremely serious opinion. Alex is slight favorite.
SPEAKER_02: because Alex will be very comfortable with Devon's hand lengths and size because they're similar in length. Alex is a little longer. And that power of Alex is probably double for what Devon has. Abilities of Trash Talk, I believe, does not have that much effect on Alex. So I believe Alex is favorite. I will tell you something. I will tell you something. Amongst all other matches,
SPEAKER_04: that left arm Alex had, and also right arm he had, I think that these are like one of the best matches stylistically for Alex. With left arm, you know, he's more sideways, but with right arm, he's top role specialist. He's just all about taking the risk. He may not be that well-rounded as left arm, but about taking the risk with right arm is with left arm,
SPEAKER_04: I mean, he pulled against Morozov, he pulled against Dadikian, and Dadikian is also very weirdly strong with the hand and wrist. While now, Alex doesn't even have to do anything, but just being built like he is, is already a disadvantage for Devon because Devon always uses that height.
SPEAKER_04: Now, just Devon doesn't have that advantage. He already lost, right? No, no, I don't say he already lost. I'm just saying he doesn't have that advantage. And now he's attacking on Alex's hand and wrist. And then the height is there, shoulder press is there. Devon really needs to be very, very, very strong. He needs to be very strong. If he's very, very strong, he can stop Alex.
SPEAKER_04: But is Alex the same guy? He said he is not. I believe him. Yesterday I had Manuel Batalla and Wagner Bortolato as my guests. He said that one month ago he was in somewhere that Alex was. He said his wrist, Alex's wrist is just unbelievable, you know. And we will see. His wrist is unbelievable and Devon's pronator is unbelievable. And Devon is not the same guy that, hey, this is party hand guy. He's really training.
SPEAKER_02: so it is very very interesting very very interesting i want to see it because i know both uh guys and uh you know i i pulled devon before i know approximately you know what he's capable of and uh what he gonna do and i believe it's not that easy to do this to alex because you know
SPEAKER_02: pronator yes very good but to uh properly apply your pronator you need to uh add copying for alex's size of the hand and you need to be able to go over the fingers and alex's fingers in here you know go pronate it's you know neither of these guys are you know like beginners they both are they both know what they are doing
SPEAKER_04: Of course, Devon is more experienced, but we will see. We will see how it will go. We will see. Artem, I promised Paolo that I will go one hour. So it is exactly one hour before we finish it. Artem, do you have any last words? Would you like to tell anything to Alex? As we talk privately, when we talk privately, you tell me you're going to beat the shit out of him now. You say that you don't do the trash talk.
SPEAKER_02: Can you explain the difference? I'm just joking, Alex.
SPEAKER_02: And he says, do you want to say anything else? He says, do you want to say anything, Alexey? Because he says, I remember when you called me and there were only two of us, and you said that you would just destroy him right away and that's it. And then he says, of course, I was joking, I never said that, but he says, is there anything you want to say? Well, in fact, this is the kind of attitude I want to go out and win.
SPEAKER_01: Alex also wants to go out and win, and on whose side luck will be on that day. Well, not even luck, but who is simply given it. At the moment, whoever is stronger will win. And so we both want to win. I wish Alex good luck so that he can fly, fly, recover.
SPEAKER_01: without injuries, the main thing is that I don't worry about anything, I don't rub it anywhere, so we will fight, I have nothing to say, I just wish good luck, and so the mood is like his, I am also crazy and probably somewhere deep in my soul, I still think that I will come and just look easy, you know, this is also 100%
SPEAKER_02: Okay, so Artyom is saying that, yeah, there is not much to say. I just want to say good luck to Alex. And he said that whoever is ready better or better man that day will win. And, you know, good luck, safe flights. And, you know, we will have, we will see on the table. You translated what I said, right?
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, there is one super chat before I ask Alex his last words. Sports giants high-ending on July 19. Kirsten will have a rematch against Bozidar. What's your opinion about this match? Also, will we ever see Kirsten on East vs West? My friend, Kirsten East vs West stage, he came to the
SPEAKER_04: qualification event. I think he was out of the top five during the qualification event, but once he wins the qualifications, yes, for sure, he will be invited. For sure, he is leveling, but I think he needs a little bit more time. And Alex, any last words? Yeah, before last words, one guy from Canada,
SPEAKER_00: very very asked me to ask Artyom about did Denis send the hammer to him because he said that he don't know where's the hammer, he cannot sleep normally and he asked to ask Artyom did hammer in his place or somewhere else. Pavel, help with this. Your friend from Canada doesn't have any contact with Artyom?
SPEAKER_04: No. Is he black? No, he's not black, but he was saying that he rides too much to Venice and don't have respond. So he's using you as a vehicle? He asked about favor. Yeah. Just say your last words, my friend, and then Alex. Okay.
SPEAKER_00: About the awards, so for this event, I wish Artem the same, like everyone, to be in good health, in a good mood before the match and after. I'm sure we will do the best, both, like Artem said and I said, that both of us will do our best to show the interest in our wrestling.
SPEAKER_00: i'm sure it's not so last time like he said he wants to go every time to every event we have a big goal so both of us have the big goals and all the time we will see each other in these events and and paulo do you have any last words yes yeah i will say russian because those words for them and they both understand russian yeah
SPEAKER_02: Guys, thank you very, very much and I wish you guys the best in Chicago and let the stronger one win.
SPEAKER_01: And thanks to everyone who has been watching us. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. All the best.
