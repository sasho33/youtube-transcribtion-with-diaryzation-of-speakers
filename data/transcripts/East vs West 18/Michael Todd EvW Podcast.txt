SPEAKER_01: started the live and one second let me check yeah yeah we are live yeah how are you michael i'm good i'm good just had a great uh few days we had juji here we did some filming and stuff together so it's fun to have him around he's a lot of fun uh-huh that's good that's great yeah and let me see one more time if everything is okay and then
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, yeah, yeah, we started, yeah. And yeah. So how is everything going, Michael? Training is going good. So far, I've hit all the numbers on my programming I'm supposed to do. And if it continues this way, I'll have my best prep yet, so. Yeah? Yeah, yeah, feel good. That's good, that's good, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: So is it hard to push over and over or everything is okay? You just, I mean, it's not started with Gennady, it started with, what was the first one, Lamparelli? Yeah, so I had the first little match with Pablo here, then I had Lamparelli, then Lars, then Camille, then Gennady, then Hermes, and then now Vitaly. Now Vitaly, yeah. Did you have a chance to see Hermes' podcast, anything from yesterday?
SPEAKER_03: Well, I had a lot of people sending me messages talking about how he had picked me to win. So I saw a little bit from when it's for 29 minutes on. We had a death in our family yesterday. My daughter-in-law's father passed away. So we had to go to the hospital and do all that stuff. So I haven't been caught up with everything. But yeah, it was nice to hear his opinion of the match and stuff. But yeah, it was great.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. Are you any surprised to hear that from you or it was just as you expected? So, I don't know.
SPEAKER_03: Vitaly is extremely dangerous. You know, he's an extremely dangerous opponent. So by no means am I just assuming I'm going to be able to beat him. And even when I'm doing reviews of his previous matches, am I looking at that and thinking that's the Vitaly I'm going to face? I think I'm going to face the strongest, most prepared Vitaly anyone's ever faced. So I'm just, I'm believing that if I do, you know, what I've programmed myself to do and I give myself the rest I need and I show up,
SPEAKER_03: If I can have a very good, everything there, minimal space, everything's great. Physical preparation. I think I have a good chance of winning the match, you know? So all I can do is do the work, right? I mean, I know he's younger than me. He's, he's bigger than me. I mean, he's a, he's a bad dude. Yeah, for sure. For sure. He's dangerous, but like majority of the community at the beginning,
SPEAKER_00: Like they were saying, oh, Vitaly is going to destroy Michael. And then more and more knowledgeable people start to share their opinions. And people started like, hmm, maybe yes. And then suddenly yesterday, I mean, if Hermes would say 55-45 Michael, then yeah, I wouldn't be surprised. But whenever he said 70-30 Michael, and I was like, wow, but like who could know
SPEAKER_03: I can't tell anything to Hermes because Hermes is the one who faced both Vitaly and you. From that perspective, we're both his last two opponents. He's gauging by what level he was at when he pulled Vitaly and then what level he was at when he pulled me.
SPEAKER_03: And then assuming that I came home with a few lessons learned, changed to started doing the riser training the way he's doing it. And I mean, we all know Vitaly is going to be a lot stronger than he was then too. It was high praise. It was very nice to hear. I mean, for someone who has the most recent data, right? Like he has the most recent data on me specifically. So for him to believe my chances are that good, it was definitely nice to hear, you know, so.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. Do you have, like, this is something that, like, I just couldn't figure out why. Like, Michael, what do you think that you should do more so that people, like some people, that they don't underestimate you? What do you think the problem is there? Is it because they don't understand from arm wrestling? Or what is the problem with that? Well, I mean, I think a lot of arm wrestling fans are still new.
SPEAKER_03: you know, and they don't know that I did have a pretty good career prior to, uh, COVID, you know what I'm saying? Like, cause a lot of people came around, you know, after COVID and they found arm wrestling and they don't know about the, you know, the push car matches and some blink off matches and all the things I had really good. I mean, I had a pretty good record and then I just had a couple of years where I still don't have a losing record, but I just, you know, I lost a couple of matches and people kind of wrote me off and,
SPEAKER_03: I don't know. I feel like last year was a very good year. I mean, 5-0 on a comeback was pretty good. You know, I didn't start off the year great with Hermes, but I mean, people just don't really understand how. I mean, Hermes beat you 3-0, but he said that the difference was like this much. Is this what he said? Well, I mean, that was, I mean, I agree. I mean, listen, it was very nice for him to say that. But you also heard John Brzezink, when he did the interview with you, say, you run that match back two or three weeks later, could be a different outcome. You know what I mean? It was a lot closer than what the scorer said.
SPEAKER_03: Um, he had a perfect performance and I made a couple of mistakes. Um, but he came in very well. Yeah. He was perfect. And I was, I praised the young man, um, for his preparation, his, his ability to stay patient and have such a good day. I mean, it was very impressive.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, but I have never seen you that big. I have never seen you that dangerous. John Augustine says, Monster Michael Todd is so massive right now, he made Juju look small on their podcast. Time to let the monster come out to play once again. Yeah. Well, Juju actually told me, because I don't like being what I feel is not in shape.
SPEAKER_03: aesthetically. And he's like, dude, just, you only have to do it for the rest of this year. Like if I, if I can beat Vitaly, I get the winner of Hermes versus Lavon. So if I beat Vitaly, I have seven months left to train as hard as I've ever trained in my life to have this shot. Right. And after the shots over, whether I stayed super heavyweight or not, it doesn't mean I have to stay this big. Like I'm a super heavyweight at two 70, you know what I mean? I don't have to stay this big. Like I,
SPEAKER_03: What are you now? Dressed like this, 3.14 probably. 3.14? Yeah, and I've had one meal so far today. I slept in a little bit late. I'm probably going to weigh in, if we do weigh-ins, 3.20, 3.25. That'll be the biggest I've ever weighed in anywhere. By the way, in TBC, personally, I have never seen you any bigger, but have you been any bigger than the TBC shape?
SPEAKER_03: i've been bigger but not as in shape like in 2018 i got i got fat after pulling push car i put push car at 3 11. and then that was in november and i came home and then uh kind of fat over the holidays and in february of 2018 my morning weight was 323.6 my evening dress was about 3 33.
SPEAKER_00: I have a question for Michael. Like whenever I talk with people, I repeat this and of course I don't have to say anything new if that is the thing to say, but like, like two rounds of Pushkar, rest in peace, flagship, and then next four rounds, the matches stopped, you know, and Pushkar is probably one of the most like
SPEAKER_00: one of the best starters and most explosive and strongest, like one hit in my book. So he could do it twice. And when you pull him first time, you beat him 6-0 and you stop him every round. And then second time you pull him,
SPEAKER_00: He did twice in the next four rounds. He couldn't. So do you think, like in an objective way to judge, do you think that your stopping power is the best in the world? I say yes. Especially now. I feel like I'm pretty strong right now. I don't.
SPEAKER_03: If there's somebody that can flash me, it's going to be Vitaly. Can he do that three times in a row with the three stars? And you heard me just say that. I said if someone can flash me, it's Vitaly. I didn't say it's LeVon. LeVon might can either. I don't know. So you find Ladek more dangerous about that start? I don't know. If I'm not strong enough to stop Vitaly, I mean, if I'm not strong enough to stop LeVon, that's a different story. I don't know, man. I don't...
SPEAKER_03: If I thought now I'd take the match. If I thought, I don't know, man, I, I don't think, I don't think he can flash me three times. Yeah. He might, he might be able to beat me somehow three times, but I don't think he can. Okay. Okay. That, that, that's you, you, you, you talked about something very interesting. Like you said, you said Hermes pull you.
SPEAKER_00: in a perfect way, no mistake at all. And Hermes is, I don't know how to say, Hermes is like an arm wrestling machine. He did everything right. He waited at the center, he rise, rise, and waited in a position that he wouldn't get any pressure, and then suddenly he's sideways, and then transition to dead-risk pressure.
SPEAKER_03: Do you see Laletin being capable of doing all those that Hermes did? No, I don't think he can do it the way Hermes did it. He might could hit me so hard, so fast. I don't think he can beat my pronation. I heard Morozov say he thinks he's gonna palm up. I don't think he can turn me palm up, but I mean,
SPEAKER_03: if he, if he hit me so fast, so hard and got great position, like a really good position, then he might be able to make some adjustments and beat me from there. You know what I mean? Yeah. I don't know, man. I don't know. I know Rebecca just walked out and she didn't shut the door all the way. So three of my dogs had just busted into the gym. So we got dogs everywhere. But yeah. Yeah. I mean,
SPEAKER_03: I have great respect for Tally. He's an awesome dude. I really like him a lot. Every time I see him, he always does a smile on his face, always wants to get a picture. I don't know if he'll behave that way at this event because we're opponents. No, no, he will, he will. He's a very civilized guy, yeah. Yeah, good dude. I'm excited about the opportunity. I'm very, very excited about the opportunity. I mean, so think about it, man. I just had the opportunity. Had I won that match, I would have been pulling LeVon for the overall number one in the world, right? Yes.
SPEAKER_03: to turn right back around and my next match be one where I can get a shot at the overall number of the world by winning this one person doesn't get that too many times. Right. So to have two back-to-back opportunities, I feel extremely blessed to be in this position and I will not be taking it lightly. I will give you the very best version of me on May 10th. The very best version. Yeah. I mean, I told you that that's mother's day weekend, you know, and my mom's birthday is mother's day. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: so normally you wouldn't accept if it was not this kind of opportunity yeah so um there's gonna be i will be very emotionally invested in in this match yeah and uh for for me to lose this match i'm almost gonna have to die on the table right like i'm gonna give it everything i got yeah for for a few different reasons yeah well yes yes yeah yeah but the most important of course i understand what you mean right um dino says michael will win god bless you michael
SPEAKER_00: Thank you. God bless you. Todd and Olex Lovechild says, we love you both so much. Stay healthy. Thank you, Todd and Olex Lovechild. Nikos Zevgolis. Greetings from Greece, Michael. Greetings from Greece. Michael versus Vitaly will be a war, but Michael will gas him out. Do we have an info about East versus 18? Will it be in Turkey? You're talking about the next event or? Listen, May event will be in Istanbul.
SPEAKER_00: on May 10th and on May 9th, we will do the weigh-ins for the finals, world qualifier finals for the East Northwest. And Saturday morning, May 10th, we will have the finals. The athletes who have been qualified all over the world, they can compete. Yeah. Okay.
SPEAKER_03: what is the possibility vitally to not to let you go to strap so it's it's it's obvious his hand is very very strong right but i don't think anyone is capable of slipping better than me like i've never had a hand that i couldn't slip out of if i wanted to slip out of it
SPEAKER_03: Um, and I've seen other people slip from him. We saw the Zorn off slip from him, you know, uh, pretty sure we saw more as I'll do it one round. Didn't he, didn't he one round slip or the strap? Uh, yeah, yeah, he did. He did. Yeah. So, I mean, I don't think those guys, I think those are very strong humans. I don't think they are as proficient as slipping as I, you know, because for years used to had to earn the strap, right. Used to, you could get called for an intentional slip.
SPEAKER_03: No longer do we get called for those things in professional arm wrestling. Used to, you would get called for an intentional slip. So I had to get very proficient in making it look like I wasn't trying to slip, although I was trying to slip. So I got pretty good at it. I can't imagine not being able to slip, but understand the very first step is being able to slip because I do think I need the strap to beat him. I really do think I need the strap to beat him. Michael.
SPEAKER_03: um every round that he tries to you know not to let you sleep and it ends up the sleeping it is it is going to take away something from him of course i mean i just got through analyzing his his match with hermes yeah he tried yeah yeah i mean multiple times to hold on and compromise his own wrist to try to pin him you and i both know once you let this take a lot
SPEAKER_00: No, why would you do that? Because round one he won without that, with the fouls, he caused fouls. But that is why he wanted to do that. Do you remember the round three, the tough round that Hermes gave to Levan? That round, Levan tried the same thing. He tried to hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, and he ended up, and then his hand, in my opinion, got a bit tired. And that is the round that the trouble starts.
SPEAKER_03: round three you know yeah so that is what i'm thinking emotions get in it your testosterone is going and you're just you're like and you just go for it and you don't realize oh crap i just fell right into a trap and now my wrist is screwed my hand is screwed you know i mean it happens man i mean yeah i do think that that could be a problem if he like if he sees the slip it's going to be inevitable i would not think it'd be wise for him to hold on and compromise his wrist trying to press me down you know
SPEAKER_00: But I don't know. The thing, what I know about arm wrestling is that, Michael, when you gain weight, like you put the muscles everywhere and your arm power goes up maybe this much, but your hand power goes this much. With the weight gain, of course, your hand, everything gets stronger, but the arm gets stronger. So when you go super heavy weight,
SPEAKER_00: the arm power is much more than the hand power. Do you know what I mean? No, I get it. I get it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So it really, when you're trying to hold on and with that pressure that your hand gets really like damage, you know, I know he has the best grip. He has the best grip. Phenomenal grip. As an athlete, he's amazing all around. Like he has all the tools. When I say he has all the tools, he's like a, he's like a tall, long,
SPEAKER_03: stronger hand travis bajan like he's got he's got that one silver bullet that's just beautiful right now i don't think he has the tools when it comes to transitional press to to winning a chess match arm and i know the guys have long long matches in his career so i'm taking nothing away from that you know what do you mean long long matches what you talked about well talking about the money 2015 yeah yeah just remember that guy was just going like this and
SPEAKER_03: We tried it with just waiting like that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But I mean, when I say people talk about endurance, but I'm just saying arm wrestling is physical chess. In my opinion, you know, it's like when you're playing tennis, if I, if I can return your serve, like if you have a really good serve, but I can return your serve. Now you got to want to win more than me because I'm going to die for the volleys. Like I'm going to try real hard to get that ball back to you in arm wrestling. If I can stop your hit now, the match just started. Now you're going to have to outthink me. You have to out arm wrestling.
SPEAKER_03: And it doesn't happen often. I'm not saying it doesn't happen because arm wrestlers just did it, and it has happened. But once the match stops, if I have any type of position, any type of pronation engagement, I mean, I'm a hard person to put away. And I think that's when the arm wrestlers are picking me. I think it's because they know that. Of course, of course. I'm just saying that according to arm wrestlers, you are here.
SPEAKER_00: According to some of the fans, you are here. Right. Personally, I would never want to pull someone like you. You understand? Because you bring the match to a point that you are 100% experienced. Your opponent is not. Your opponent is just like...
SPEAKER_00: 30% experience about that because you pull that style against any style all the time. I've lived there. I've made a career out of living there. I've been in that position longer than anyone else. But how many times they pulled someone like you? How many times? Exactly. Yeah. That is the scary part. So Pauline. Pauline.
SPEAKER_00: one of the one of my favorite guys in the great i'm so happy he's on the card i love i love having paul on the same card as me it's a lot of fun yeah and your match with vitale is a historical match you guys have never met before no we haven't we haven't yeah that is a historical match yeah um the whole united states behind monster michael todd can't wait to support and witness in person he says oh that's nice that's nice i'll be excited to see now
SPEAKER_03: I need to clear this up. Robert announced at East vs. West 17 that Paul's match with Samusha was a world title match. No, no, it was not. It's a 95-kilogram, right? It's a 95-kilogram, yeah. There's no way Paul's making 85. He's got way too much muscle to make that weight. Yeah, I just wanted to make sure. Now, going back to answer your question that you asked me a little bit ago, what do I have to do to get people to stop underestimating me?
SPEAKER_00: If I beat Vitaly, I really think they might stop underestimating me. You know what I'm saying? Yeah, but can I ask you something? You have wins against Jerry. You have a win against Devon. You have win against Dave Chaffee. You have win against Andrei Pushkarsh. And you have won rounds against Dennis Splanko in his prime.
SPEAKER_03: yeah yeah i mean that's pretty good you know what i'm saying if you go down to the top arm wrestlers in supreme weight division of history yeah i've got a pretty good record against most of them you know what i mean yeah yeah it's not bad uh if you mean i don't know man it is what it is i'm i'm i'm very excited about this opportunity because and this is funny because even you do this i'm gonna go ahead and call you do this as well we talk about
SPEAKER_03: oh well you beat this guy and then your next match is lavon or well if you beat this guy then your next one arm is pulling lavon and you know real soon so arm we we cannot discount arm is this strong right now like no no everyone says it everyone says it because they talk about
SPEAKER_03: oh, Vitaly pulling Devin. No, no, I'm 100% sure. If I made a mistake. It was a mistake because you said it. Yeah, but I can tell you that 99% of the times I said he's going to pull the winner of Hermes. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know. We'll just be saying it in a sentence and we'll say, then your next match is LeBron. I'm just saying people are thinking I beat Vitaly in seven months, I pull LeBron. No, in seven months I pull the winner of Hermes versus LeBron. And
SPEAKER_03: we don't know who that's going to be yet we know the favorite is levon like we know that we know that but arm is look serious right now like just okay so i've been doing his riser curl right and to see him do the 50 kilograms or 52 kilograms for 19 reps is mind-blowing i know what that does to my riser right um i mean i haven't got to 100 kills i mean i haven't got 50 kilograms yet
SPEAKER_03: i will do 100 pounds tomorrow and that'll be my new pr so that's like 45 point something kilograms and that'll be for a single my goal for vitality is to get to 50 kilograms right but if he's doing that for 19 reps um that's a serious threat because his riser information can hold up and his wrist cup is getting real strong too i don't know man i'm excited um and i think i talked to robert i hadn't talked to you about it if i am able to beat metalli
SPEAKER_00: It kind of makes sense for me to commentate Armwrestling vs. LeVon in Chicago. You know what I mean? I don't know where it's going to be and if it's in the United States. Because I'm for the winner of that, right? If I beat Vitaly. You are a good commentator. I love armwrestling, man. I love armwrestling. Listen, anyone who knows armwrestling fluently in English and can express himself, I mean, yeah. I would, yeah. Why not?
SPEAKER_03: So, like I said, the first work happens in 34 days. I have to be victorious against the big Russian giant. You win or lose. I think it's still a good idea, but you know, I'm not going to mention the win part or lose part, but I don't think it depends on that one. Yeah. So I'm gonna be honest with you. If I did lose, I would probably take a match in Chicago in the next event. I would probably let you book me a match, you know?
SPEAKER_03: The only reason I would not want to compete is if I win. If I win, I'm going to sit back, wait six, I'm going to train for six weeks, watch the Levon-Hermes match happen, know who I'm going to be facing, and then the serious work begins, you know? Because then you...
SPEAKER_03: But I mean, the other thing about that is the amount, if I'm able to beat Vitaly, the amount of promotion that I will do for me versus either Levon or Hermes, because hopefully it gets to happen here in Hot Springs, because we've got the Hot Springs behind it. We talked to you and Robert. That would be, we have a 6,000 person arena that I know we can fill out. You're talking about, you're talking about like if you win and pull them? If I win, if I win against Vitaly, then I get to pull in December versus Levon or Hermes. And so you would want December event to be in Hot Springs?
SPEAKER_00: Hot Springs wants it here, too. Everyone is super excited. We will fill that place up with so many rednecks, it'll be crazy. It'll be full of people. But who knows? 34 days. Dino says, who do you want to win, Michael, Levan or Hermes? I don't think that you will say.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I have great respect for both gentlemen. I think we're going to see the very best version of Hermes, and I don't know what's going to happen. Would I like to be, you know, if I'm, that doesn't really matter. You know, at first, the whole reason I'm like, I believe a lot of people think it's impossible to beat LeVon. I think I can do all things through Christ, and that's, beating LeVon would kind of be the pinnacle of that for me. So if Hermes beats him first,
SPEAKER_00: I'm still on a mission to just show the world, you know, with faith and hard work, all things are possible. That's really my goal, you know? Yeah. Let's see. Let's see. Not much left. As you said, 34 days, it will be incredible. And more the knowledgeable people talk, more we realize that it is a very close match. Very close match. Yeah. And another thing.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, probably about the dead risk pressure, probably Hermes is stronger than Vitaly. But do you think that Vitaly's long reach can be a problem? So I think there's so many things about Vitaly that can be a problem. Obviously, his long reach getting further.
SPEAKER_03: The thing is, if anyone in the world flop presses me into my arm, I don't think they can beat me. Anybody. But if you flop press me into my hand and my knuckle, the way look, Irma's did, there's the way to beat me. But if you flop press me into my arm. So you are saying that not the way to do like Gennady and Kamil tried. No, no. I don't think Levan can press me in that position. I don't think Levan can press through that. If you're pressing to the same angle that they were pressing in, I don't think he can pin me.
SPEAKER_03: But if you press me in the angle that Hermes is pressing me, now I'm vulnerable to a handful of people. And if Vitaly was to get enough height over the top of my knuckle and the integrity of my riser wouldn't hold up and it did compromise, it's not impossible for him to flop press me from there. I mean, I'm aware of this. I'm trying to make the adjustments where that's no longer a lane for people to beat me in. So I'm trying to make improvements every day, you know?
SPEAKER_03: But there is a possibility, Vitaly Laletin, to get high on your hands. Of course, because of his height, right? Now, the one benefit that I think is because he's so long, and you do have to show my knuckle, he won't be able to be like this. He'll have to be more here, you know, because I'm the shorter levered athlete. Now, this is a question I have.
SPEAKER_00: y'all had said all matches will start in the referee's grip but the last east versus west the very first round you gave them a chance to get there yes yes that's how it's going to be yeah the first round the first round we gave afters to have chance if they prove that they can go next round again but what whatever round it doesn't happen they can get all around all rounds will be the referee's group yeah okay yeah yeah that's interesting
SPEAKER_03: Would you prefer Vitale? No, I would probably prefer a referee's grip. Oh, you would prefer a referee's grip? Probably. I mean, just because, I mean, I think Vitale is probably pretty fair too. So it's probably going to be fine either way. You know what I mean? I don't even know how to cheat. I don't even know how to cheat this setup yet. I'm like, hey, can y'all teach me how to cheat? I don't get it. I still think my...
SPEAKER_00: some of my range of motion stuff won't let me do it. So I just set up. Not because of that, Michael, like, you know, I have pulled like so many years, you know, like, I mean, I need to focus as an athlete to like control my opponents and bring his hand to there. It's like, I can't really think about anything else. You understand? You can't really depend on something that, you know, like whatever rule allows you,
SPEAKER_00: I mean, you close your hand, you know, maybe we try to a little bit cover here and referee is going to bring it down, you know? So you can't really train like this when you know that you need to show your knuckle, you know? Of course. And you cannot train like this because you know that he is going to show. What I'm just saying that I have never, ever, ever like focused such thing, you know, like I focused about how I can beat my opponent, you know, how I can control his pronator, how he cannot control mine, how I'm going to bring his hand down.
SPEAKER_00: that is all i focus on my career you know and when i when i talk like all my career or something a lot of people think that because they are new fans they think i'm only a organizer or something but yeah but but i i was i was good armistead michael yeah of course of course you were like i mean you arguably i mean at least in the top five lightweights ever and maybe higher than that what is your what is your waf in the eaf how many world titles
SPEAKER_00: I mean, I won. I don't count the Masters category. They are not the same thing. Yeah. I won 11 world titles, but I didn't compete many of them in my prime. Many of them I had to miss it. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: That's crazy. My first world title, wow, 94. And the last senior was 2018. So first and last is in the senior category, 24 years. Yeah, that's crazy. Whenever I won in 90s, they are, oh, 90s is not that hard. And I won in 2000s, oh, 2000s, late 2000s, no, no, 2015 is still no, 2018.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know, maybe I come back and win in 2020, maybe they would then... Yeah, maybe so. That's the crazy thing. It doesn't matter. And Rebecca tells me, it doesn't matter. You can beat LeVon and people will still say you suck. I'm like, I don't know. If they don't like it, they are not going to like it. They are going to deny it. No matter what you do, they are going to deny it. You pull this way, they don't like it.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know why, but someone else do that, they are like, okay, you know, that's good. Yes, great. Awesome job. Awesome job. Yeah, awesome job. Yeah, you're right. Doretto says, Engin, what will you do if Levan defeats Vitaly, Devon, Master, Michael, Todd, and Hermes? It feels like there is no one outside the top five who can give Levan a good matchup.
SPEAKER_00: My friends, we will think about it. We can't really think that way already. He needs to do it. He has been doing it. And I don't know if he continues winning, you know, what can we do? Like, like mothers are still giving birth to the, you know, new guys. And then, I mean, maybe now someone 17, 18 years old, then when he's 20, 25, look at Morozov was just a young kid, you know?
SPEAKER_03: Look how dangerous now he is. And I'm going to ask you a question that's off topic. I know you got another super chat. What is the oldest person to ever hold a super heavyweight crown? Um, I think it was, it was Jerry.
SPEAKER_03: He held the crown, but he wasn't the overall number one in the world. If you hold it now, you're the number one guy. If someone beats LeBron, you can't argue. How many years ago was that when he had it? Two years ago? He was 50 years old, yeah. He was 50 years old, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I'm just, I mean, cause it'd be neat if my glove, I mean, like right now, Todd Hutchins is 59 and he's the light heavyweight world champion. You know what I mean? That's crazy. Yeah. No, that's not light heavyweight. What weight is that? What weight class is this? He's middleweight. Yeah. That's what is middleweight. So he's middleweight world champion at 59 years old. That's crazy. Yeah. Yeah. He is strong. Yeah. He's strong. I had erected the podcast. He was complaining and he wants to rematch. He was like about some.
SPEAKER_00: And then he wants a rematch. And hey, Tata Sinks versus Rustam Babayev. Were you in the same card when Tata and Rustam pulled in a supermatch in Poland? I was not. You were not. Okay, okay. So they pulled in 2018 while you were there in 2017. Right, right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. What do you think about that match?
SPEAKER_03: I think it'd be very, very difficult to bet against Todd Hutchins right now. Anybody his same weight, like he's just, he's, he's very unique. You know, I think he might very well be one of a kind for someone at 59 years old to be so strong at that weight that to pick anyone at his weight over him, even though he's never got a single pin. And I don't think he's had a match last morning, a couple of seconds with, with, um, with Russ, um,
SPEAKER_00: Russell usually beats him very fast, real fast. Yeah, but both times he was the hooking Todd. Right. And now he has something different. Yeah, this Todd's a little different. He's a little different. If Todd, listen, my opinion, if you cannot control Todd's pronator. Right.
SPEAKER_00: If you weigh the same, you don't control his pronator, most likely you're going to lose that match. That is how Dadikan won. He was able to control his pronator. Anyways, so what do you think? Is Tadi going to win?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I'd say 65-35. Wow. Yeah, just because his record speaks for himself. He's just so impressive. And he's so methodical with his training. And I love how he documents everything. He's such a professional when it comes to his programming, his training. It's admirable. There are not many people who understand. Listen, when you look at it from outside,
SPEAKER_00: you don't think that he knows what he's doing. You think that he's just going like this. But when you understand armwrestling, you know what he's doing. The way he armwrestles, like, not so smooth. Not like John Bersink, you understand? You don't really enjoy so much all those, you know, transition and hand control. But 100% he knows what he's doing. He's a smart guy. He's a smart guy. And he builds something very unique.
SPEAKER_00: And people so far cannot figure it out, you know? Yeah. Anyway, so Boss Royale says, Mike, what is your opinion on the Vitaly versus Devin match? Another one. It's very difficult to bet against Devin. I mean, this big version of Devin?
SPEAKER_03: I saw where Irma says he doesn't think he's a lot stronger than the 120 kilogram version, but he looks stronger to me. He looks stronger to me. I do agree with the take of Irma saying he thinks I'm a more difficult match because of stopping power, where Devin and Vitaly will both normally control the hand pick, height and center and table control. So if Devin went for that center and table control, got beat,
SPEAKER_03: and got exposed early and got flashed or something. All those things are possible, but it's just very difficult to think that over multiple rounds, Devin doesn't stop the match. You know what I mean? And Devin stopping the match is just like a python squeezing its prey. I mean, it's like he grabs you and he just bleeds you and drains you. Do you agree that Devin at the center
SPEAKER_03: is better than you, but you are better than Devin in, like, mostly losing position. Like, you... Well, I think that's the general consensus. He's definitely better than me in the center, and I would think most people, probably Devin himself, would say I'm better in the very close pin position. So, yeah, I think that's accurate. Devin uses his tools very well, the size of his hand, his levers.
SPEAKER_03: his pronation, a riser, his ability to see my pronation is, I mean, as I said, it's very, very strong. I have a very strong formation. It just doesn't engage. So here Devin can set his pronation in the setup. Like you'll see Devin actually move before go almost every time because he's in that pronation. Right. And then he's like, boom, he stops you because he's already got everything, boom, locked in place. And that could be from the way he does his lifts. Right. So it may seem a very difficult person to
SPEAKER_00: to beat in the center because he engages so much of that rising pronation in the center. But he also normally has a leverage advantage against everyone. He won't have a leverage advantage against Vitaly. Yeah, so that's what I was saying. What I'm just saying that just if we calculate this way, Michael, is Vitaly better here or here? To me, at the center, he's better. Yeah. So Vitaly and Devin both are
SPEAKER_00: Very good at the center. So if Vitaly takes the hand advantage against you, it still doesn't mean a lot. But if he takes the hand advantage against Devon at the center, it may mean something. So what will happen at the center when they pull against each other will be giving us some idea about the outcome.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah. I mean, a hundred percent. And that it's, it's still, what we see at the center doesn't determine the outcome because it just determines the start and whether or not Vitaly could flash from him a couple of times. Someone that has good, good, like he, he depends on his hands while you may be like this, but if you have the pronator, you are still right.
SPEAKER_03: Very good. You understand? So what Devon's Devon's still I would say Devon's the second best at that. Like, yeah, second best. It's doing you mean in the superweight category? Yeah, yeah, yeah. So he has a great chance at the start. And if he can't win the start, I think before he loses three times, he figures out a way to
SPEAKER_03: put the brakes on him somewhere, and then do something ugly. You know what I'm saying? But ugly still wins, right? If ugly is within the rules, it still can win, right? And Devin's about the win. He doesn't care how he does it. Do you think that Hermes has a stronger arm or Devin has a stronger arm? Like arm power, back pressure. I think Hermes might have the strongest up pressure, hammer pressure of anyone who's ever arm wrestled. You know what I'm saying? I know back in the day, there were some really weird freaks who just had these crazy lifts.
SPEAKER_03: but the way his translates directly to the table, I mean, this whole thing that he can do here, I don't know anybody else that can do it. And then the fact that he can do this riser curl and keep his riser intact while he's taking such a crazy heavyweight this way, I think he may have the strongest riser and the strongest, I know everybody else is calling it back pressure, but to me it's still up pressure. I don't know whenever he pulled against Devon, but since then he improved a lot because he realized that because when he pulled against Jerry,
SPEAKER_00: he didn't really train for these things. He just trained for this. And then it was not about here. And then four weeks later, he had a match. So he had to rest one week after Jerry. He only trained like 10 days and then rested 10 days. So he was not here. But still, until he proves, I think Devon had here. I mean, if you go by the match, Devon defeated everything he had. He defeated his riser. He pronated. His pronation stopped.
SPEAKER_00: yeah but once you have here once you take the here then the rest is not that hard to do it you know yeah right right yeah um yeah if you go and look at that match you would say devin definitely has the stronger riser stronger everybody yeah yeah yeah because he may be stronger almost maybe stronger but you are saying maybe now not then but maybe now i'm talking about right now right now i would be i would be hard-pressed to find anyone who can match him on those two lifts
SPEAKER_03: I would love to see it. Listen, listen, listen. When you say this, that, that is giving me some ideas about Levan match. You should have given me a lot of ideas about it. That's what I'm saying. It's no guarantee that Levan wins. It's crazy. Like it's crazy. So the thing is, you don't have to be stronger than Levan everywhere. Stronger than Levan in a couple of spots. Enough to make him gas, enough to make his wrists and hand open up. These are just my opinions.
SPEAKER_03: you're strong enough in a couple of spots to make this match go 10 15 20 30 seconds even if you lose round one 15 20 30 30 round by round three that's a big dude who is not used to going 100 for 30 40 seconds in matches right like so you are saying that you are saying that
SPEAKER_03: Like, at the end of the year, Hermes may be the guy to... Well, I mean, it's definitely not impossible. You know what I'm saying? Like, it's not impossible. And that's the thing. That's what gives me hope in a potential match with LeVon. I just need to make sure I'm strong enough in a couple of areas to just drag that thing out into just a dogfight. Because if I can drag it out, two things will happen. I'm not overlooking Vitaly. I'm just saying, if I ever get to face LeVon,
SPEAKER_03: And I'm strong enough to stop the match. What will happen is my belief and confidence and faith in myself will go through the roof and he will start to doubt himself because people have people who've never arm wrestled me and they get in that spot and they think they're this close to winning. And then they realize, oh shit, I'm not that close to winning. It messes them up, you know? So if I can ever get in that position with LeVon.
SPEAKER_03: With a world title match where you have to win four times, I like my chances. I just have to be strong enough, and I don't think I'm strong enough yet. Yeah. I mean, you know, I talk about my faith a lot, right? I wanted to beat Hermes, and I wanted to pull LeVon in June. I believe on that day, had I done some things differently, and I had been in a little bit better mental place, I think I was strong enough to win. It wasn't my day. Hermes was a better guy. He won fair and square.
SPEAKER_03: But I go back and look at that. Maybe I was strongest to win on that day, but I would not have been strong enough to beat Lavon in June. So I now have another opportunity. Now I've been blessed with another opportunity to hopefully be able to beat this insanely strong opponent, Vitaly Lilletin. But then I have seven months to get ready, you know? So that's how I'm looking at it. I mean, I'm looking at it in a way that, you know, things don't happen in my time. You know, they happen in God's time in my mind.
SPEAKER_00: I'm still a hundred percent believer that, that I'm doing this for something bigger than me, you know? Yeah. My friend, we all need to believe, you know, like we can't, we can't really get involved in something without believing, you know? Um, yeah. Chris Drummond, Drummond, uh, sorry for pronunciation. Michael, how does your shape today compare to when you pulled Pushkar in 2017? So.
SPEAKER_03: I definitely think I'm better now. I may have possibly been better in 2012 when I pulled push car than I was in 2017 when I pulled push car because I was a more fit. I think you faced much stronger push car in 2017. Oh, I agree. I agree. I just think the healthy fit version of me that was the 2012 guy might have would have beat the not felt healthy fit version of me 2017 guy.
SPEAKER_00: But yeah, I definitely think this is the best me because I've spent a lot of times in this comeback focusing on arm wrestling specific lifts. And I've honestly never done that in my career. Yeah. And Greg Lovely says, what version of Bible do you study from? King James. King James. And okay. So you are saying that
SPEAKER_00: Hermes is probably strongest at this moment about the back pressure. And still, if he didn't pull everything, if he didn't pull perfectly, and if he didn't have that great of pressure, shoulder pressure, he couldn't have won that day. He won that day, you know. He said yesterday. It was nice to hear him say that because, I mean, he does realize
SPEAKER_00: that I do pose a threat, you know? And, uh, yeah, yeah. I mean, everyone, everyone who knows our Mustang, like, tell me, just, I will tell you something, those people that they, they criticize you, like, I don't know if they're armistice or not, but they would never want to pull against you. No, no. It's funny because they think I would just Kings move them. I'm like, listen guys, if you're not one of the very, very, very, very best in the world,
SPEAKER_03: I'm going to have the Kings movie, you know what I'm saying? I'm only going to have the Kings movie because it's the very best. If you're a lower tier, I can do a lot of different things to you. You know what I'm saying? I can impress you, I can do a lot of shit. Yes, yes, yes. But if you're a very, very top guy, if I have to open top row to beat you, whatever it takes. You had always the very disturbing, the sticky point. You would just think that you took everything. You are that close. I remember.
SPEAKER_00: like you versus Rambet, he was just all over. And Rambet, in his prime, he would do tons of pressure. I have seen him many times shoulder pressing John. And I remember you were just holding him like open arm like this, and at that time you were not going like this, but you were like this. And then yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: I remember even then you were lighter and I was very light as well. I took your everything. I think left arm I beat your right arm. We had a very long match. You beat me left. You also pulled 54s that day I think as well. I was 150 pounds. But you won the 154 class.
SPEAKER_00: right and left he took one the 198 left he took second the 198 right yeah yeah yeah hey the first start i beat you me maybe you don't remember i don't but i knew you're back i beat you
SPEAKER_00: You tried to hook me, and I beat you. Oh, yeah. That was bad. And then they gave you a foul. No, they gave you a foul. So, like, you tried to hook. I had the pronator. I won, and they said foul to you. And then the second start, you went just directly here. And a long match. Long, long, long. You were like this. Yeah, it was a very... I think, Jason, do you know what I was surprised about that day? You and I, we had wars, like,
SPEAKER_00: for sure a minute or long. Yeah, and then you flashed Jason. Yeah, Jason Rimmer, I still beat him. I went to the B-side and he was just 200 pounds on the scale. Probably he was 210 on the competition day. And he took second in the world, WAP Wars, if you remember. Right, yeah. Yeah, the same year, same year, yeah. And still, I flash pinned him. I don't know how I did, but yeah, it was just... Yeah, because our matches took a lot out of each other. You know what I'm saying? Yeah, yeah. They were dogfights. Listen, his chance to beat you was a bit more than my chance.
SPEAKER_03: So I beat him. He beat me at the Arnold a month, two months later, a month later, a month later, he beat me at the Arnold. And then later that year I beat him. I don't remember. I think he did have a winning record on me back when we were both at 198 though. Yeah. Yeah. I think he won against me in Petaluma that year or year. Yeah. So I beat him. Then John Brzee beat me and then he came back and beat me.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, so in the first match, you beat him? Yeah, I beat him in the first round, and then John beat me, and I went back down in the semifinals, and he beat me, so he got to go pull John in the finals. Did you know that the year I beat him, I beat him like 11 times or 12 times or something, but the year that I beat him, he beat John Burzing in like one of the champion of nights or nights of champions or something? Yeah, an overall event or something like that. Overall, yeah, yeah, yeah. In 2001 or something. Wow, what days, you know? He was incredible. I saw him recently.
SPEAKER_03: Pulling that cold kid from Missouri, cold kid from Illinois. Can't think of the kid's last name, but Jason Raymer was there and they had a pretty, pretty tight match. Like the cold kid just won national, the IFA nationals yesterday. I can't think of his last name. Cool little kid, strong little guy. Kind of looks like Zac Efron, the actor.
SPEAKER_03: Um, but yeah, so I just saying, I saw Jason Reimer pull an event within the last six months. I don't think he's anywhere near his. No, no, not at all. But it's still fun to see, you know, some of those older guys come back. What's crazy is like, we've been doing this for so long and people have came, have been, been good. Then they left.
SPEAKER_00: Then they came back, and we'd just been here the whole time. You know what I'm saying? Yeah, yeah. Look at Kanai. Kanai is also interesting. Yeah, yeah. You have been there nonstop. I don't see you. And I remember first time I heard about you was when you were pulling against Cobra in a dark place. He couldn't pin. He couldn't pin. And he was prime Cobra. Yeah. And you were not that big as you are now. Let me tell you what happened there. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: cobra flash brian brandon this is 2000 paddle in the worlds brian brandon yeah he had just won he had just won i think in september he just won or maybe he was did he just went i think he just won virginia beach world title at 176 or something um yeah and the year before he'd won the 99 worlds and the overall so this is 2000 he just won virginia beach and here he is he pulls 176 and he jumps up and pulls 198.
SPEAKER_03: So he flashes Brian Brandon. One second, one second. The one that I saw pulling against you, you had long hair, and it was before 1997. That was 1995 big shots. Yes, that one. That was a 220 division. He won the 176, and then he beat me in the 220s. Yeah, but it was a very long match. It was a tough one. You did the same weird thing. Yeah, the same thing. But then I beat him in Petaluma in 2000.
SPEAKER_03: Put him, we were both on the A side. I put him on the B side. Yeah, he won 165 World Wars in Virginia. Yeah, yeah. So then I go on to, yeah, 165 World Wars. So I go on to the finals and everybody comes up to me and pat me on the back. You're the world champion, you're the world champion, whatever, all that stuff, right? And I just sat there and then Brian Brandon comes back and beats him. So then it's me and Brian Brandon in the finals. And I was just like, ready to go.
SPEAKER_03: I was so overwhelmed in the moment that I just got flashed twice in the finals and took second. The pressure was too much at the time. I was too young. I didn't know what to do. I was like, ah! But yeah, but I did beat Cobra, so that was cool. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 25 years ago. Yes, yes, yes, yeah. A lot of memories, you know. Yeah, but 30 years ago was the hot shots. I've got the little plaque around here somewhere. I think I guess it took second or third. I don't remember, but yeah. When did you start, Michael, first time?
SPEAKER_00: 1990. I've got my first award right over there. It was a wrist wrestling. We locked hands in middle and pinned to your forearm. Yeah. Yeah. So I did that at the Sling County Fair about 35 miles from where I live. It was my first ever tournament. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Wow. It was impressive. I started a year after you did. Oh, wow. You were already world champion by 94. Yeah, 93. I took second. 94, I won, and then it went that way. Yeah, yeah. And with Michael.
SPEAKER_03: It is always great to talk with you and do you know, do you know which day you coming? Yeah. So we just booked our flights and I'm really happy to say, um, we get into Istanbul on Tuesday. We get it as long as six. So I think it's, it might be 5.00 PM, 7.00 PM. I'm not sure. So then we, I guess we have like an hour drive to appendix. We normally find us all right. But we now I booked this flight this way.
SPEAKER_03: I fly to Dallas, I have an hour and a half layover, and then 12 hours nonstop to Istanbul. Yeah, yeah. Dallas is one of the places. That's the best flight. Yeah. Chicago, Los Angeles. That's the best flight because usually I have to go from here to Atlanta. Amsterdam. And I'm like, yeah, this is, and then Pendik, I have to fly on that, what is that, Pegasus?
SPEAKER_03: And the seats are so small, like this, you know, for three and a half hours. Turkish airlines right now. Yeah. Turkish airlines is really good. I'm so excited about that flight because I finally get to get there rested, you know, and I get there on Tuesday. So I have Tuesday night, Wednesday night, Thursday. I mean, like I get to really be acclimated. So I know I'm getting the best Vitaly, but he's going to get the best Michael as well. Yes, yes, yes, yes. It will be incredible. I hope people understand what an important match is.
SPEAKER_00: Michael Todd and Vitaly Laletin, they have been around. Michael has been around more than 30 years. Vitaly has been around for 15 years. And now they have never been this big and this strong. But Vitaly, 150 kilos, the guy still doesn't show.
SPEAKER_03: like anything, like he still looks like very athletic, you know? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, the guy's literally a giant, like, I mean, I know the thing to be a giant, you gotta be six, 11 or seven foot or something, be considered giant. But to me, he's a giant, you know what I'm saying? Uh, his, his length, his levers is, I mean, he's, he's, he's one hell of a specimen and I'm just, it's an honor for me to get a chance to pull him. And, and I'm, I'm excited to know that it's going to be a competitive match and,
SPEAKER_00: May the best man win. We will have five representatives from North America. You'll have to tell me the card some other time. Privately. I will announce by the poster every day. Just a surprise. Listen.
SPEAKER_00: I know about one match that's crazy. I know one match that's crazy. But I'm telling you, I will do one by one and I hope that people, like Neil Pickup calls East vs. West stage, Jurassic Park. That is another Jurassic Park, you understand? It is just seriously.
SPEAKER_03: Like one of the reasons that I'm afraid to make a comeback, that is really scary. So one of the things that Travis said while we were in Georgia, he's like, dude, after that event, I said they should have just lined up everybody that lost. And then all the guys who lost on stage say, if there's any way you think you can beat any one of these guys, that's how hard it is. These are the guys that lost. Me, Rackley, Morozov, Gordechia. Think of the people that lost.
SPEAKER_00: You know what I'm saying? Like, the people that lost are all really good. That's the highest level the sport's ever been. Yes, yes, yes. And somehow, it's just the level is increasing. And, like, you saw in person, right, David, you saw those arms, right, the forearms and everything. He looks like he's carrying, like, two legs, you know? Yeah, it's weird. It's just weird. You know what I'm saying? And another thing, I don't want to let you go one more minute. Like, Morozov versus Vitaly. Wow.
SPEAKER_03: Did you watch that there live? I sat right there on the stage watching it. Like, here's the stage. I sat right there just sitting there. I was eating because I was nervous stomach before that. I was sitting there eating. That match was so unbelievable. So unbelievable. And to have Morozov just sitting there talking. Yeah, he was like, he was saying like, do you know why he was doing that? A lot of people like,
SPEAKER_00: disrespected him that he wasn't real champion. You understand? And then like, listen, you may lose, you are a real champion and you may still lose, but like people said that he would get destroyed. So once he stopped,
SPEAKER_03: So he was not really talking to Vitaly. He was talking 50% to Vitaly and 50% to all the haters. Yeah, 100%. I am here, you know, and really big respect to both guys. Both are great guys, man. I mean, that's the fun thing about this. Yes, you get to compete against these guys, but it'd be fun just to spend a weekend training with them, you know what I mean? Just to get in the gym and train with them. Hey, listen, if you guys are up to it,
SPEAKER_03: We can get a camp with you guys. I don't know. All that stuff sounds amazing. At some point, it's going to have to happen because just to get around other people who are as crazy as we are, right? I mean, to dedicate our life. Okay, think about this. I know we got to go. No, no, no. Look where the sport is at today. It's an amazing place.
SPEAKER_03: But you and I have dedicated our life to something that was nowhere near this big. Like the sacrifices we made, the travel we did, all the things, just because we love this sport. I mean, it makes people getting into it now, they see the potential for it growing and getting big and being mainstream. We did it because we loved it. You know what I mean? And that's what you see when you see these fellow arm wrestlers who are your peers, people who you know they've made the same sacrifices, they've done the same. It's just fun to get to hang out with those guys. You know what I mean?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Just, just remember, like whenever I say now pull for the hungry, how many people will realize right now watching us? Nobody, but what did you make from there? Yeah, we got a couple of trophies. I got, I got the, I got the big sterling silver plates over there. Yeah. Yeah. And it was an event to help the poor people, right? Exactly. You would donate canned foods and all kinds of stuff. Yeah. Mary, Mary, Mary. Mary McConaughey.
SPEAKER_00: yeah yeah yeah and then that this is the event that we met you know yeah right yeah it was it was beautiful you know we were everywhere in 2000 2000 is when it was yeah i don't know the exact date but i could go back and look on a calendar i'll tell you what the date is because yeah yeah yeah like we were spending our own money with the gas and food and register nothing we were making nothing you know and we occasionally there'd be a tournament that paid 200 for first 100 second third place fifty dollars you know what i'm saying like and that was like yeah
SPEAKER_03: Look where we are now. I know, right? We are that close to mainstream. That close. I really think that we have everything we need. We have everything we need. We just have to let the world see us. We don't have to create characters. We have so many characters.
SPEAKER_00: We just got to expose them to the world, right? And I think we're on the right path to do that. Yes, yes, yes. That was my main goal. A lot of people said, and you said in so many matches, three matches are okay, like the king of the table. I said, no, that's not my dream. I don't want to make money. It is just I want to make sure that we have categories
SPEAKER_00: You know, rankings, everything, champions, you know, awards. We started giving those awards, and then we went to the belt, and it will get better with now Robert and Dexter getting mold, and everything will be better. You know, I never had a plan to become a Dana White of Armistice, make so much money, and then be back like a boss. I'm still the same guy. I don't give a shit. But I see the potential. You guys are growing, becoming more popular. I'm very happy, you know.
SPEAKER_00: And I really hope that you guys will get more and more what you deserve. I'm excited to see you make a comeback. I'm excited to see you throw your hat back in the ring. I started training. I did this short training, and I want to kick Mindaugas' ass. I knew it was Mindaugas. Yeah, yeah, Mindaugas. But hey, Mindaugas versus Giannis. My God, that was great. By the way, were you there? Were you there? No, man, I told Corey, I was like,
SPEAKER_03: Cause I couldn't board my dogs anymore. I was going to have to take the RV training and it was going to be 640 miles round trip. Well, my RV is an older RV, so it kind of beats my backup. I would have had to sleep on, not my normal bed. And I thought, you know, if it takes 1% off what I could be for Vitaly, I can't risk it because it's that important of a match to me, you know? So very important. Yeah. We got here a bit professional, you know, a bit.
SPEAKER_03: I hated it because I would have liked to have been there and not even, even, even not just for Corey, but just to see my friends, you know, just to see my friends. But to me, I agreed to match that, that needs to, I need to show up at my best. You know, I have to show up at my best. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And whenever you put those things on the scale, you had to choose your dreams, you know? Oh yeah. I mean, I even called Devin. I was like, Hey man, I'm thinking about notes. He goes, listen, if you were my, if you're my training partner and I, you had a match that big.
SPEAKER_03: I'd tell you to stay home. I wouldn't want you to come. I'd want you to get your training in. So, I mean, I did all my lifts that day. I mean, I watched the whole event and then I went out here and went out here and hit all my lifts and did all my training. And yeah, so. Before we go, one more question. Like, we see you lifting weights and doing trainings. Like, do you also have, like...
SPEAKER_00: do you see table time as part of your preparation or you see table time as the, like to see gauge, you know, like, like result of your weight lifting, like you'd lift it and then you go table. Let me see. I use it as a result. I use the result because, because of all the injuries I've had over the years, you know, arm wrestling hurts my training. If I arm wrestle a lot, then my weight training and my lifts,
SPEAKER_03: can't hit my lifts right well you and i both know how to arm wrestle we've been on wrestling a very long time it's instinctive everything i do on the table i don't think about it's instinctive um i just need to be strong enough to be able to to stop these guys who are younger bigger than me you know like um so if i can get strong enough and the match stops
SPEAKER_00: My mind already knows how to arm us. No, I understand. Can I ask you something? When you lift weight and the things that you do at the table, they are not identical. Once the match stops, the things that you are doing. Your last match was on February 15th, now May 10th, almost three months.
SPEAKER_03: that endurance doesn't go anywhere, or you think that your lifting also gives you the endurance that you need at the actual match? Yeah, so I still do cardio regularly. I mean, obviously I'm heavier right now, so people are like, why is he breathing so heavy? I'm like, because I'm heavy. That's why I'm breathing heavy. I'm a big dude. But I still do cardio regularly. Endurance for me is not necessarily something I have to train.
SPEAKER_03: Um, now what you see, you see my arm wrestling specific lifts, you know, you see the pronation of the riser, the pronation back pressure, the setup, the side pressure, the cupping. I still do a high volume chest circuit. I still do a high volume back circuit, high volume, shoulders, arms, legs. And in those circuits, I still do flexed wrist cups and wrist rolls and battle ropes. And I still do all these other things that are heavy, heavy volume. So very heavy on the endurance, but to me has never been.
SPEAKER_03: oh, I have to train endurance when the match stops so that I can outlast you. I outlast you because of heart. I don't outlast you because I have better endurance than you. I outlast you because I hate losing. You know what I'm saying? Like, it's just, you know, if the match stops, you got to, because there'll be times in a match I'm like, damn, I'm thinking about quitting. And then it clicks real quick that, well, if I'm thinking about quitting, I know he's about to quit. You know what I'm saying? Because I never, you know, so. So you are saying that you believe more? Yeah. That's really what it comes down to. If I can stop the match,
SPEAKER_03: I believe I can beat you most of the time. Whenever you train for a tournament and for a super match, what is the difference you do? Do you do quicker, the sets? Everything's the same. I do everything the same. I've never changed, whether it's a tournament. Even in 2017, when they brought me over from UAL to WAL,
SPEAKER_03: And you interviewed everybody and Devin's like, he can't win a division this deep. You know, there's talents too deep. He's going to have long matches. And then, you know, I wasn't even seated. And then you had Travis, what number one, Dave, number two, Nick Zena, number three. I had to meet all of those guys on the route to the title. And I had long matches on the way and I still was able to win, but it was because of heart, you know?
SPEAKER_03: That was hard. Not because of specific training for them. No, I mean, I was strong. I did two a day training. I did a hard, um, wrist roll battle rope circuits in the morning and added a hard, uh, high volume resistance training in the evening. And I did that for six weeks straight leading into that. But, and I did a lot of the BFR training to blood flow restriction training really helps with your endurance as well. Your oxygen uptake and all that stuff. But I don't know, man, I just, I just think so much of this sport and anything
SPEAKER_03: Some people are just built different. Some people thrive in a dogfight. And if you put me in deep water with somebody, it's like, okay, so you remember Rambo part two, where he's going to get the POWs and his captain or general, whatever, colonel goes, you know, that place is hell. He said, what you call hell, he calls home. Or most people, like you said, in a dogfight don't want to be there.
SPEAKER_03: I spent my entire career there. So I'm just at home. You know what I mean? Like when that match stops and things get crazy, that's home to me. Yeah. So you are saying that you are making sure that it becomes a war. And once it's a war, it is your nature to be competitive there. Of course. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Let me read. Of course, it could be because I hide under the table. That could be it. You what? One of your super chats is it's because I hide under the table.
SPEAKER_00: So maybe that's why I thrive so well in dog fights. Woody, UK, says 25 years of pure heart and motivation. Thank you both, he says. Oh, that's awesome. And then I think pulling off John, Michael, will you weigh 390 pounds at
SPEAKER_03: four four four percent body fat versus man if i could i would i don't know how to do that uh it's not that easy yeah yeah it should be nice but i'd just be like i'd be happy to be four percent body fat yeah and and yeah i'm gonna tell you okay i'm gonna go ahead and let you in on something so okay i gotta go after this but i was talking to juji
SPEAKER_03: And he's like, dude, you just got to embrace being big. Like, you got to go ahead and just keep eating. Like, you got this match in five weeks, and you got the next match in seven months, so you got eight months. Just embrace it. Just don't worry about it. If you're not as fit as you want to be, as long as you have your cardio, just embrace it. So it's not unrealistic. I'm just going to throw these numbers out there. I do believe I'll probably be 320 plus for Vitaly. But let's think about it. If I beat Vitaly,
SPEAKER_03: And I literally have seven months to get ready in the matches in December. Well, it's already started getting cold in Arkansas. When it gets cold, it starts getting darker. I always gain weight in the winter. I'm not sure if it is what you need. I know, but there's a chance. If I really did embrace this shit, I could be 340 or 350 for LeVon. Yeah, anything is possible. And be a big, big, big me. Listen, listen. I don't know if I have to ask you.
SPEAKER_00: Tbilisi, when I saw you in Tbilisi at the lobby, you look scary enough, you know, you just look like really like... I appreciate that. No, I mean, no need to appreciate because it was just, I saw it, you know, it was just the arm and everything. You look like a wall, you know, wall, you know, and yeah, I think that the best thing you can do, my opinion, is that become linear.
SPEAKER_00: I would love, I am not, my body just wants to get big. I don't know how to do that either. If I knew how to do that, I would.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, but I'm just saying that, like, I don't know how good it is, you know, to be... Well, I'm trying to get lean now. Yeah, yeah, this is what I'm saying. It's not working. It's not working. But more, like, lean. Yeah, I want to look like Morozov. I want to look like Morozov. That's what I want to look like. You know what I'm saying? Morozov? I mean, I don't know. I might be too old to look like Morozov. You're less scary than Morozov. Yeah, that dude's a bad dude, man.
SPEAKER_00: Well, you too, you too. You all are too. You know, you guys are just like, seriously, like, very scary looking, all of you, all of you. And listen, I want to tell to the fans, you know, like, listen, these guys are extraordinary human beings. And they are the best guys in the sport that we love. My opinion, they all deserve respect.
SPEAKER_00: Guys, these guys win or lose, they don't deserve to be made fun, you know, and things like that. Trust me, they pay very heavy price. They have been in the sport forever and they are really doing their best and where they are is very hard to reach, very hard to reach. And I would suggest anyone,
SPEAKER_00: to show utmost respect for these guys and michael thank you very much and see you in uh for like four weeks like four weeks yeah we're gonna be there pretty soon yeah i will come and pick you guys uh from there that'd be great that'd be awesome yeah it would be great and hey listen you and you and rebecca if you guys need to go somewhere special just choose already maybe before the other athletes come you know we can do something you know i don't know which day they are coming
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, we love doing extra sightseeing, just seeing culture and stuff. If there's something that you want to do on Wednesday that sounds like fun or something, let me know. Yeah, maybe we do it all together. Vitaly also comes. Whatever, yeah, that's cool. Yeah, the guy is one of the most friendly guys. He's a great guy. I'm telling you, he's so funny because he's always like, let's get a picture, Michael. I'm like, okay. He's always this big, giant dude. I'm like, hey, because he's so damn big. But yeah, he's a good dude, man. He's a good dude. Whatever you want to do, just let us know.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I also please pass Rebecca that I don't know how to say in English, but sorry for her loss. And yeah, yeah. Her daughters. Yeah, it's our daughter in law. Her father passed away. Father. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So yeah, it was kind of sudden. He was sick, but it kind of happened. We didn't expect it this soon. So, you know, it's just hard. And then it brings up all of our past traumas. You know, anytime you lose somebody,
SPEAKER_03: and you go see someone else in their moment of loss and it brings back up everything you felt so you can empathize and have those, it brings back up those same feelings, you know, so. Yeah, yeah. Anyways, yeah. Take care of yourself. Thank you very much for your time. Thank you very much for your time, Mike. You have a blessed day. Take care. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye, guys. Thank you for watching us.
