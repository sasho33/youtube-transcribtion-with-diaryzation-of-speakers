SPEAKER_01: Hello. Hello. Hello. Yeah, your phone is sideways. Like this? Yeah. Yeah. Hello, Tony. How are you? Hello. Good day. I'm good. Thank you. You? Good. Good. Good. Everything is good. Yeah. Thank you. And
SPEAKER_00: So how are you, Levan? You just train, you are tired? Yeah, I had a really tiring session. I had trained a lot this evening. So yeah, I prefer to continue in Georgian. So ask for help.
SPEAKER_01: Something is different with Levan. Did your hair grow a little bit longer, or what is different? Something is different. Or the beard is longer, or what is it? I have not been to the barber for a while. I plan to go. It was a choice, or it was just because he didn't have time?
SPEAKER_00: This wasn't intentional. I just forgot about it. I was busy. Reminded me to go tomorrow. So how is the preparation going, Levan?
SPEAKER_02: Yes, it is very good. I would like to thank all of you for your support, but there is serious progress in all areas, and it is very important that we continue to work together
SPEAKER_00: the preparation is going really good especially the last two weeks i've gone really heavy despite catching cold the training feels really good and i can confirm and firmly say that i'm really close to my best shape okay may i ask him what was his best shape when he said that he's very close
SPEAKER_02: Would you like to say something about the way you see it? Well, I don't have much to say.
SPEAKER_02: It's a very long process. It's a very long process. It's a very long process. It's a very long process. It's a very long process.
SPEAKER_02: I measure my shape according to the gym lifts and the amount of weight that I lift.
SPEAKER_00: And, um, for example, uh, already on the bench press, I have reached 260 kg, uh, and on the other lifts as well. Uh, I can say that I have passed the weights, which I haven't passed for, uh, Jerry or Devin, uh, preparation to them. Uh, can you put the phone sideway? Not this way, but the sideway. Yeah. Sorry. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Levan, do you think that the shape with the weights and the shape at the table are the same? Because by years we are more coordinated at the table.
SPEAKER_01: We may not be able to lift the weights that we used to lift, but we may be better at the table. Is it possible because of competing many years, you know, more power being translated to the table? What does he think about this? As you said, there is a lot of correlation with the fact that it is possible to compete with Asak, but not with Magida.
SPEAKER_02: Well, yes, as you said, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true.
SPEAKER_02: I think that, well, I think that it is possible to say that there is a very strong relationship between Magida and Klaučić at the moment. I think that it is possible to say that there is a very strong relationship between Magida and Klaučić.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, this is 260 kg is like a benchmark for me that I try to reach and not to suppress too much. I think that's good enough for the general strength. But as for table, I think that even though the weight on this specific lift is the same, I feel that at the table my performance gets better and better.
SPEAKER_02: So even though the number is the same, I feel that I can do better at the table. Yes, yes.
SPEAKER_00: And this is the training program that I have been using for years now. I have not changed it a lot. I might make some slight modifications according to the opponent that I'm facing. And this has worked for me good enough for all these years. So this is my usual approach. So Levan is saying that
SPEAKER_02: Does it mean that your form of education is based on your form of education? Yes, yes, that's right. I agree with what you said. I think that my form of education will continue because now it is up to me
SPEAKER_02: I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. I'm sorry.
SPEAKER_02: In fact, it is now in the form in which we can see the results of the study, because it is now in the form in which we can see the results of the study, because it is now in the form in which we can see the results of the study, because it is now in the form in which we can see the results of the study, because it is now in the form in which we can see the results of the study, because it is now in the form in which we can see the results of the study,
SPEAKER_00: Considering the time that is left before the match, I feel that I will suppress my best shape so far. And on the match day, it will be my best shape possible. Already, these weights that I'm lifting, this is the same weights that I have peaked to during my previous preparations.
SPEAKER_00: So moving forward and hopefully without any injuries, I feel that I can surpass my best shape and I feel that this will bring the best performance that I can get for that day.
SPEAKER_00: and at the moment my focus is to moving forward to not be too risky with the lifts and gain the strength consistently. Right now, Levan, the biggest question in the armwrestling community is like how long
SPEAKER_01: Levan will go undefeated like how many years he will take and who has the biggest chance against you and I remember
SPEAKER_01: First time you and I, we had a podcast together. You said you are going to finish your career, you know, without losing against anyone. Once again, I would like to ask, like, what is your plan for the future? How long do you think or do you want to compete?
SPEAKER_02: What did you think when you were interviewed? The interview was very interesting. I was physically and mentally exhausted. It was a very interesting interview.
SPEAKER_02: I would like to talk about the physical, mental, and physical conditions, and I would like to talk about the mental conditions, and I would like to talk about the physical, mental, and physical conditions, and
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, being unbeaten is quite tough.
SPEAKER_00: especially taking it to so many years that I have, it's becoming more and more difficult, not only physically, but mentally as well. The opponents are of course tough, but beating them once or twice and then maybe even third time,
SPEAKER_00: it can be tough to get the same motivation as before. So, it's definitely not easy to keep the winning streak. I think it's not easy to keep winning streak. I think it's not easy to keep winning streak.
SPEAKER_02: It was a very important moment for me. It was a very important moment for me. It was a very important moment for me. It was a very important moment for me.
SPEAKER_02: This is a kind of motivation for the song, a kind of motivation for the song, a kind of motivation for the song, a kind of motivation for the song, a kind of motivation for the song, a kind of motivation for the song,
SPEAKER_02: but there are some problems that we have to deal with. Well, at this stage, what happens is that this year we will have a two-year break, and we will have a two-year break, and then we will see how much it will increase. I think that in the future, we will see how much it will increase, and how much it will decrease. We will see what happens in a year.
SPEAKER_02: But I think it's a good thing that this is happening. Yes, well, I think there is a big problem. I would like to emphasize this motivation, because, well, there are a lot of organizations, for example, there are a lot of organizations in Latin America, there are a lot of organizations in the United States,
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it's hard to say exactly how many years this will take.
SPEAKER_00: uh if god permits and the health is there i will definitely will compete for many years and will definitely strive to be unbeaten uh but it's tough uh in terms of motivation because now if i beat ermis then what then the latin then maybe devon third time uh going in circles it can be quite tough to get the same motivation for each of the match
SPEAKER_00: I know for sure that this year I will have at least two matches and I'm sure that I will be victorious in both of them. But I might take a little break after a year or two just to recharge my mental state and to get the motivation back. But overall, yeah, it's a tough, tough battle. And before that break, do you think that there is any chance for your left arm, Levan?
SPEAKER_02: How do you think, is there a chance that you will win the championship? I don't think so. I think I will win the championship. I think I will win the championship. I think I will win the championship. I think I will win the championship. I think I will win the championship.
SPEAKER_02: If you don't have a lot of motivation, you can't have a lot of motivation to work hard.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I don't think so, but you can never say never. I might, by surprise, just jump out and take a left arm match any day.
SPEAKER_00: So maybe, maybe, maybe that could be the motivation for the future. I used to be equally good with my left. And during my break, maybe I can switch to the left and that can bring back the drive.
SPEAKER_02: Yes, I think that in terms of motivation, if you want to win, if you want to be able to win, then you have to be able to win. Because if you want to be able to win, you have to be motivated.
SPEAKER_02: I don't think it's a good idea to talk about it in such a way that it doesn't make any sense.
SPEAKER_02: And if you do that, you will be able to say that you will not be able to do it again. And if you do that, you will be able to say that you will not be able to do it again.
SPEAKER_00: Actually, thinking about it, I would consider a left arm match if it's a title match. That would definitely bring my motivation up and the drive to become into my best shape.
SPEAKER_00: If Engin decides to do so, probably I wouldn't accept non-title matches because that wouldn't be worth the effort. But if title match can be arranged, that's something that I can do. I mean, listen, Levan's left arm was better than his right arm.
SPEAKER_01: before his injury. So if Levan is saying, Engin, set me this match, that match is going to be set. It is not like that we're giving him a favor or something. We all know where he can be. All you need to do, Levan, is just, Engin, set me. This is the date and I want to pull the champion and your match is there, you know.
SPEAKER_01: That is not because we are good friends or something. It's because you are that good, you know. The only thing is that you need to decide. You are Levan Saginashvili and we know where you are and you wouldn't take a risk if you didn't feel you are ready. And if you are ready, if you believe it, the only thing we need to say, yes, that's all. I don't know.
SPEAKER_02: It's like, you know, you go to the store, you buy something from the store, and people think that it's not real, but the truth is, it's not real, and there's no doubt about that. And if you have a lot of experience and experience in the conditions that a lot of people have experienced, you know,
SPEAKER_02: I think it's important to think about the market and the market itself, and if there is a market, then the market itself will be 30-31% of the market itself.
SPEAKER_02: because there is no way to change it and there is no way to change it. If you look at it from the other side, if you look at it from the other side,
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, definitely. If I accept the match, that means that I'm confident that I can bring the best left arm that I can. It wouldn't mean that it would be just a match just for the sake of it, but this means that I'm definitely ready and I can bring my best performance.
SPEAKER_00: At the moment, I'm all in and focusing on my right arm. During the training, I might do 70% of the same weight that I do on the right, on the left, just for the sake of keeping it in shape. But at the moment, yeah, my main focus is the right one. But I can switch my focus to the left, prepare it. Like Devon is doing right now. Devon is doing one event left and one event right, one event left.
SPEAKER_02: You know, I think if the shoulder is okay, how is the shoulder level now? Is it better? I don't think it's a matter of progress.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know, I don't know what to say. But there is a lot of progress. It's easy to say that there is nothing wrong with these people.
SPEAKER_02: Well, I think that if I were to say that I don't like it, I would say that it's not true. Well, Deon is a robot. I don't like it when people say that to me. Deon is a robot. I don't like it when people say that to me.
SPEAKER_00: Actually, my left shoulder is feeling better. The progress is definitely there. I still managed to lift a bit too heavy and sometimes I can feel some pain. But overall, I feel that the shoulder is getting better.
SPEAKER_00: But what I feel is that if I focus on the left arm, if I dedicate my preparation, I feel that I can definitely bring it up and get it into shape. That's great. Yeah, with Devin, I'm amazed with how many matches he can have throughout the year and how much he can pull on both arms. He's like a robot. His endurance, that's definitely amazing.
SPEAKER_01: There is a super chat, GB19 says, Levan, you think Ermes had more room for improvement? .
SPEAKER_02: I would like to say that there is still a lot to be done, but there is still progress to be made.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it's really hard to say. I'm trying to see, but I'm not seeing any crazy progress for Ermes at the moment. Maybe he's getting better.
SPEAKER_01: But I wouldn't say that it's crazy different from his previous shapes. And Sam was asking that the trash talking is helping Levan or not? For your motivation, yeah. Yeah, it does. With Devin, I'm always motivated.
SPEAKER_01: There's one more. Pablo, does Lewand really think he stands a chance against Ryan Bowen? It's a tough question. I haven't been to Australia yet.
SPEAKER_01: So he doesn't know the outcome. So that kind of, either Ryan Bowen or Minda Agost Sarasaitis, it would help Levan to have the motivation back. Yeah, it's been a while, actually. How is Ryan doing? Where is he? Okay, yeah. Ryan is coming to Istanbul for commentating. Yeah. Yeah? Very good. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: He said that if you would come, you would have some after pull with him. Should I tell him that you are scared of him?
SPEAKER_01: No, I'm scared. He's too strong. He's too strong, yeah. I don't blame him, yeah. Levan, if you come back with left arm, I know you are right now motivated, but you have Morozov, you have Jablonski, you have Alijan, you have Vitaly Laletin. It is all different motivation for left arm. Yes, Marts Kherakhesh is a great competitor and a great opponent.
SPEAKER_00: The left arm competition is crazy good at the moment. The level is too high. It would definitely be tough to just jump in into the pool.
SPEAKER_01: uh so i'll i'll be watching i'll be monitoring but it would be making it would make everything much more exciting they want to go into that competition with all those other guys it would be incredible planning to pull in the near future
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, Ali Can, we just passed Ramadan, 30 days fasting. So he said, I may not be ready. But after May events, you know, if he gets US visa soon, and then maybe next events in US June.
SPEAKER_01: If not, then August 7th, but yeah, Alijan, Laletin, Dadikyan. Dadikyan, were you surprised, Levan, Dadikyan's performance against Kordesha? No, no. You were not surprised? No. No? No. Wow. It was a surprise for me. I mean, in my opinion, all the sportsmen in the world, including Georgians,
SPEAKER_00: Actually, when discussing these matches with my friends, the athletes, I was saying that Dadikyan would win this one. That's interesting. Do you think that Dadikyan has, because like privately, since it's not secret, I will share, but Dadikyan
SPEAKER_02: Sooner or later, he wants to pull Laletin. Do you think he has a chance against Laletin as well? Yes, yes. I think he has a chance against Laletin.
SPEAKER_02: If Morozov is a member of the Central Committee, he is not a member of the European Commission. We have already said that Morozov is a member of the Commission. If Morozov is a member of the Commission, he will be given two terms, three terms, and four terms. That's what it was. I think it's a very important information,
SPEAKER_00: Yes, it's definitely possible. Dadikan has very strong shoulder, very good wrist. And I think that could be a great match. Even if we consider that Morozov gave a good fight to Lelektin. And if we remember Dadikan-Morozov match, he was winning 2-0 or 3-0, I don't remember, before he got injured.
SPEAKER_00: So, it could definitely be a good match. I think LaLatin would still be favorite, but I think... There is a possibility that he can win as well. Yes. Did you enjoy the Morozov-Vitali match? I think it was a very good match. How did you like the Morozov-Vitali match? What did you think of it? I liked it very much. The first time I saw Morozov, I thought he was a great guy.
SPEAKER_02: He was a great player. He was a great player. He was a great player. He was a great player.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, this was a crazy good match. I watched it as an armwrestling fan and I was very impressed by the performance of both athletes, especially when Morozov won the first one. Yeah, it was crazy. I wish Morozov to recover soon, to get better and to come back to the sport.
SPEAKER_01: There is another super chat. Hermes Desparani is asking, does Levan think Dejan can make it back to the top on the left arm? Also, is it tiring to have fans root against you due to your dominance?
SPEAKER_02: And it is obvious that if Nikolashvili is involved in this, he will be the leader of the dominators. Yes, I agree with what you said, and I think that there is no doubt that there is a lot of work to be done. And in general, there is a lot of work to be done and I think that there is a lot of work to be done.
SPEAKER_02: I think it will be interesting to talk about it with Laledi, with Halijan, and with the other top players, as they say, what they think, what they can say. Well, that's natural.
SPEAKER_02: There are a lot of people here and I want to say that I am very happy to be here. I have a lot of work to do, and when I have work to do, I work with people because they give me motivation. And I would like to say that when I have work to do, I work with people.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, Devin's left is definitely improving. I think that the weight gain was a good decision for him. His last left match was really good and I would love to see him against top left pullers. Would that be Laletin or Alijan? It would be definitely interesting to see.
SPEAKER_00: As for the second question, yeah, I understand it's natural that there are many fans who are tired of my dominance. But on the other hand, I have many, many fans who are supporting me. So I think that I appreciate the opinion of both camps. The haters gave me motivation as well.
SPEAKER_01: And one way or the other, I want to thank all of them for watching the sport and being with us. Okay. And so let's talk about the upcoming event. Levan, did you follow, did you see the whole cards of the next King of the Table 14, Istanbul cards? Yes, I saw some matches.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, do you want me to...
SPEAKER_02: Roughly 10 days ago, I had a talk with Gennady. He told me about his upcoming 115 match.
SPEAKER_00: and who will be his opponent I was surprised actually it won't be easy but if he puts his heart to it I think Gennady can do anything
SPEAKER_01: And all the other matches, they are very good. Engin never mistakes good matches. His cards are always the best. It is impossible to produce something with such beautiful options. It is coming from the beauty of the athletes. When I say beauty, I mean, I talk about their ability, how good they are.
SPEAKER_01: You said it's a very tough match, but if he puts his heart into it, it's possible. Technically, how do you see that match?
SPEAKER_02: But it depends on what you want to do. What can you do? Of course, it depends on the person. It depends on the person. It's a very difficult and challenging technique. It's not like you can't handle it, you can't handle it. It depends on the person's biceps, if they are injured.
SPEAKER_02: and it is not the same with the war. I think it is a very interesting story, but it is also important to note that many of my friends and relatives have died, but
SPEAKER_02: Yes, well, I think that now all of us have come to the conclusion that this is a very difficult situation, a very difficult time, and we have to get out of the trauma, because there was a lot of trauma in the past, and we know that there will be a lot of trauma in the future.
SPEAKER_02: First of all, I'm worried about the weight cut.
SPEAKER_00: But since Gennady accepted the match, this means that he can do it. He's confident. In terms of pulling Sagov, yeah, he's a very awkward opponent to pull. Very painful experience overall, especially considering the weight cut and the recent bicep injury. It can be tough. It can be tough for Gennady, especially considering Sagov's pulling style and attacks.
SPEAKER_01: But I still think that Gennady can focus and win this match. I want to explain something to Levan. I explained this before as well. For me, because of two years ago the injury that Gennady had, I think Sago's style is the worst.
SPEAKER_01: if Gennady didn't recover. But you may ask me why I said this match. It is because Reno is injured. And so Reno cannot pull anytime soon. So we had to do an interim world title match.
SPEAKER_01: Devon could do that, but Devon now is in a superior weight, and Ivan Matyshenko said he is not ready yet. And Sago was very close with Rino Masic. It was 4-3, you know. And so Rino was one of them. And whenever I offered Gennady, Gennady before also told me, Engin, how about me making 115 kilos? And Gennady put a condition. Gennady said, I would pull 115, but I would lose that weight only if it is a world title match.
SPEAKER_01: So then this match happened, you know, you understand how it happened? Yeah. So I just wanted to explain. Um, so let's talk, let's talk about Artur Makarov versus Daniel Prokopchuk. Good match, huh Lewa? Yes. Very good. Yeah. Oh, Prokopchuk, it's true.
SPEAKER_00: We all know how strong Prokopchik is. We also know how impressive Makarov and his genetics are. I think Prokopchik is favored with this one.
SPEAKER_01: Definitely a good match. There is a super chat. I can't read the name because of different alphabet. Can you ask if Lewan will compete in left hand if there is good money? I think Lewan already answered that, but this is a super chat. If you want us to answer shortly or... I don't know if it's a good question. I think it's a good question.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
SPEAKER_02: I'm never worried about the money. We all know how great England is and we never have to be worried about that.
SPEAKER_01: If I accept the match, I'm sure that it will be a great one. Yeah, yeah, for sure, for sure. I mean, yeah, yeah. Thank you, Levan, thank you. You are also great, my friend. You are great. We are very, very, very happy to work with you. Hey, also, Levan, I'm seriously training. I see you training football. Ah, yeah, no.
SPEAKER_01: You know, for like two years, three years, I'm with the phone and promoting. And today I went outside. I tried. I couldn't. I wanted to do feet, knee, chest, shoulder, head, shoulder, chest, knee. I could do only one row to the here, but I couldn't come back. But I will do it. I will do it and post it. Anyway, so, by the way, Georgia and Turkey are in the same group in football.
SPEAKER_01: If you want to come to Istanbul, I don't know when the game is, then you are more than welcome. We can go together. I'm afraid fans not to beat me up. No. We will just watch together as two friends. Anyway, so let's go to the next one. Okay. Lachlan Adair versus Petro Marharinz.
SPEAKER_01: Petro will win this one. I don't know. Anyway, so today we announced.
SPEAKER_02: I am very happy to be here with Maxim Maghlekhel. I am very happy to be here with Maxim Maghlekhel. I am very happy to be here with Maxim Maghlekhel. I am very happy to be here with Maxim Maghlekhel.
SPEAKER_00: This will be a very, very tough match for Zurab considering the length of arm on Tautiev and how good outside role Tautiev has.
SPEAKER_00: this will be a very tough match. I see Zurab is preparing really well and is very focused.
SPEAKER_02: Still, it will be a tough match, and I want to wish him the best of luck. Most probably...
SPEAKER_00: um most probably he will lose or partially lose his wrist i don't think that he can uh get him into the hook but uh yeah so probably this will be either with the straight wrist or slightly lost wrist and it will be really tough one but i think i think he can manage that okay okay
SPEAKER_01: Nugo, Shikadze, Matt Mask. I knew you were going to laugh. I knew you were going to laugh. Nugo. Who is winning? Nugo. Nugo. Devon said that Matt is going to kill Nugo. Devon said. No way? No? But one second, one second. Were you impressed when Matt beat Ongar Baya?
SPEAKER_02: It was a big surprise. It was a big surprise for some people, but it was not the end of the operation. It was the end of the operation. It was the end of the operation.
SPEAKER_02: I didn't want to go there. I didn't want to go there. I didn't want to go there. I didn't want to go there. I didn't want to go there. I didn't want to go there. I didn't want to go there. I didn't want to go there. I didn't want to go there.
SPEAKER_02: Och ni är nog mogulsvara.
SPEAKER_00: It was a surprising match, but not as much. I really hope that Ongarbaev can bring back his shape, but that night I didn't see the old Ongarbaev that we are used to. Yes, maybe Mask was in good shape and maybe he has improved, but I really wish Ongarbaev to get back to his best shape.
SPEAKER_00: As for Nugo, he's preparing really well at the moment. He's lifting crazy weights. He's very motivated. And I think he will win. He's crazy dedicated. He will do everything. And I think he will win.
SPEAKER_01: I have a question for Lewand. We have guys like Nugo, we have Bacho, Saginashvili. What do you think is their chances in 105 kilos? Do you think that these people, you know, when we talk, Devon is the champion there. And Devon is very, very strong. But Devon at
SPEAKER_01: that weight and Devon in 140 kilos, not the same Devon for sure. So when Devon makes 105 kilos, like in the future, do you think that these guys have chances against Devon or they have chance against the others except Devon?
SPEAKER_02: Well, I don't know. It's not that I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, we have to look into the future for this one. We have to consider that Devin is already 50. And actually, if he has to cut down to 105, maybe Nugo could already defeat him there. But I know that both of them have a path ahead of them. They have to pass certain levels to get to Devin.
SPEAKER_00: But I think that both are capable of doing that. No, they both have the possibility to win the 105 category. Do you think they will be able to win the 105 category? What do you think? I think they will be able to win the 105 category. What do you think? I think they will be able to win the 105 category.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I believe this is possible. They are dedicated. They work hard. That's their aim. And I fully believe that they can do this. Okay, Kevin is asking, Engin, we need to see Ayana Takanaka again. Anything is possible, my friend. Okay, so you are saying Nugo is going to beat Matt and Devon is saying Matt is going to beat Nugo. So we will see who is winning. And...
SPEAKER_01: Okay so let's go another match. Did you see the match Jocelyn beat Sarah Beckman in the last East vs West? The girl from Canada? You didn't see? To be honest I have not seen it.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, this girl beat Sarah 3-0, but she was heavier. Sarah was around 80 kilos. And now this girl is going to pull Egle, Egle White Kuta. But I think the girl's bench is like 150 kilos or something. Yeah, yeah, yeah. She's very strong. Let me find her.
SPEAKER_01: photo. And so I just wanted to ask you, you know, but you said, just like, yeah, she is. Let me see. Let me see if I can find
SPEAKER_01: her photo but one second sorry and let me see she's she's very strong she's very strong and she has beaten Sarah last year and this was a revenge match okay I couldn't find a good picture but yeah
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, 3-0 against Zara, that's already really impressive. Okay, okay. Okay, so let's go to another match. Davids Samushia Pauline, 95 kilo. So, I don't know if I can say this, but I think he's a very good fighter.
SPEAKER_00: I think this time again, there will be a lot of nerves involved. We will be worried for a long time, but in the end, I'm going to be happy. So he said that Samush always worries him, worries him, but ends up winning. Yes. This is what he said.
SPEAKER_02: I'm so exhausted emotionally after watching David's matches that I can't look at the other matches anymore. It's always like that. Big drama always. Ivan Matushenko, Serhii Kalinchenko.
SPEAKER_01: 115 kilo. Right arm, yeah. Left arm, I wouldn't say that much. Years ago, he broke his arm. I think he's training now, but I don't think he's anywhere near to Ivan's level. Why is Matushenko on your priority? I think Matushenko is the favourite.
SPEAKER_02: Okay. Do you think that Serhii should arm wrestle inside? Because it's very hard to top roll, Ivan? No, not really. If you look at it from a big perspective, Galinchenko didn't do it from the beginning. Maybe he did it from the beginning. Galinchenko did it from the beginning. He did it from the beginning. Galinchenko did it from the beginning.
SPEAKER_02: I'm not a sportsman, I don't have any problems with my biceps. It's just that it's easy for me to do it. I don't want to lose weight and lose my biceps.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, with all due respect to Kalinchenko, he's not top-rolling Ivan. Ivan has got into the hook with Liliev, with Pushkar, myself included. It would be a crazy endeavor. So I would advise Kalinchenko to train his hook. And that's the only option. A thousand percent he wants to top-roll him.
SPEAKER_00: I wish he was with us. He can't be the number one.
SPEAKER_02: He would choose to be, he would want Pushkar to be alive and number one. Yes. Yeah, so that's a good answer.
SPEAKER_02: It's a tragedy, and I think it's a good thing, and I think it's a good thing for all of us to be able to talk about it, because it's a tragedy, and I think it's a good thing for all of us to be able to talk about it, because it's a tragedy, and I think it's a good thing for all of us to be able to talk about it, because it's a tragedy, and I think it's a good thing for all of us to be able to talk about it,
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I'm going to be always sorry that our match didn't happen. It could have happened. It was like at the edge of time that this match could happen. And losing him so tragically, it was a huge loss. And every match, every my performance, I always remember him. Yeah. I'm sorry that our match didn't happen. Yeah, it was great, you know.
SPEAKER_01: that Levan took Pushkar's son on his shoulders after East versus West. It was a nice moment, yeah. Mr. Peanut says, statistical analysis, sorry, the only measurable correlation of data between matches besides a win-loss record table time.
SPEAKER_01: running time total time of action in each round until a winner is declared thank you for your super chat mr peanut again round one example start clock zero stop player elbow foul running time okay the same guy is asking mr peanut restart match one foul stop
SPEAKER_01: I think he has some suggestions for us. Thank you very, very much my friend for your suggestion. Levan, will we ever see you compete against Vitaly for the left-hand World Championships? We would like to see you compete more, strongest ever.
SPEAKER_02: Let's start with Vitalistana Martskhena. Yes, sure. Vitalistana Martskhena is a very important figure in Martskhena.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, let's see. We have Matt on the left on Zloty Tour. I beat him twice. I would repeat that with pleasure. Okay, one more. Mr. Peanut, round one, table time, summary, players, elbow foul, slip, strap, player to elbow foul, winner player, won by pin, pin time. Thank you very much, my friend. Okay, so let's go to another one.
SPEAKER_01: We go to Kamil Jablonski vs. Gyorgy Dzerano. Left arm. Dzerano. I think Dzerano. You think Dzerano. How is it going to be? He's going to hook him? Yeah. Yeah? Yes. Yeah. Before, like five minutes before...
SPEAKER_01: We started this podcast. Okay. He said, Kamil, in the athletes group, Kamil said, hello, Di Zerano, and he showed his forearm like this. And then I said, Georgi, Kamil says you are in trouble. And then Georgi said,
SPEAKER_01: Hello to everyone and to Kamil in particular. I really hope that you won't be upset with me after the fight. He said, Kamil is a good guy. I don't want to upset him, but the winner lives alone. And then Kamil posted a video, Preston. He said, I will rip off your bicep, my friends. So Kamil says that he's going to rip Kamil's bicep.
SPEAKER_01: Di Zalano's bicep. And then Di Zalano said, in the third round, I will pretend that it was hard. But the first two rounds, everything will be fast, he says. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. They are already going back and forth. They are riding to each other in the group, you know, Atlas group, you know. So you are saying that Di Zalano is going to beat Kamil, huh? While we thought that Kamil could be number one.
SPEAKER_01: in the future since he was very close to Lalezin. Okay, so Georgy Svetkov versus David Dadikyan. Hey, good matches, right? Good matches.
SPEAKER_02: Another very interesting but hard to predict match and I'm thinking I never thought of them.
SPEAKER_01: both of them meeting anytime before but i don't know why i'm sure that uh this would be this would be a great great match yeah people understand georgie because they think dadikyan will win easy maybe he will but also daddy uh georgie has very good pronator very it's very hard to control so i think it's very close match
SPEAKER_02: No, no, it works very well. It's not like I'm going to tell you what to do next. It's not like I'm going to tell you what to do next. It's not like I'm going to tell you what to do next. It's not like I'm going to tell you what to do next.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I'm sure that this will be a tough, tough battle. There will be no flash pins or quick wins. I don't think that Dadikian will be able to hook him. But also, I don't think that Tretkov can easily take his wrist. So they will be like at the center like this. Yeah. So it will be a battle with Dadikian's wrist and Tretkov.
SPEAKER_00: I think that Gheorghi will take the center slightly and Dadikan will hold him.
SPEAKER_01: slightly below. That's how I pretend, imagine it to be. Again, Mr. Pina says, pin time, straps, total table time, round one, longest pull, second restart, total time in straps, restart, first foul, player, second slip, foul, player, two, refuse grip.
SPEAKER_01: Thank you for your super chat. He's trying to make East versus West reach, I think. Hanging past your knees versus Levan, will you train Brian Shaw and Arden? Brian's the audience for our next video.
SPEAKER_02: Of course, of course. It's not like I'm going to lie to you, of course. I mean, Brian's life was different. He lived in America for a few years, and his life was different from mine.
SPEAKER_02: I think it's a good thing that our sport is growing and that it's growing and I think it's a good thing that the competition is growing and the motivation is growing, because the sport is growing and the motivation is growing, because from the beginning it was very easy, but now it's very difficult.
SPEAKER_02: Well, Oden already has a great teacher. I don't know what else I can teach him.
SPEAKER_00: Uh, but for Brian, I would, uh, help him out, uh, with great pleasure. Uh, I'm really happy that, uh, Brian has took interest into our sport. Uh, I would gladly train with him, uh, maybe teach him some stuff. Uh, I think the main thing he has to learn is to how not to lose the interest, uh, and keep motivated in the sport because many have started, uh, to train arm wrestling.
SPEAKER_00: Many have fallen off because from the first sight, they might think that the sport is easy, but when reality hits them, it's a really tough sport and you have to keep the motivation going, especially when you are already such a successful athlete and overall human like Brian Shaw.
SPEAKER_02: And I would love to train with him and teach him, gladly. Tata Sings versus Rustam Babayev, Levan. I don't know what to say. I think Rustam Babayev is the best. I think he is the best.
SPEAKER_02: In the form of this book, I want to share this with you, because I would like to express my gratitude to all of you, and I would like to express my gratitude to all of you, because I would like to express my gratitude to all of you, and I would like to express my gratitude to all of you, and I would like to express my gratitude to all of you, and I would like to express my gratitude to all of you,
SPEAKER_02: Now, the fact that Ustam is a Christian, as we all know, Ustam is a Christian, as we all know, Ustam is a Christian, as we all know, Ustam is a Christian, as we all know, Ustam is a Christian, as we all know, Ustam is a Christian, as we all know, Ustam is a Christian, as we all know,
SPEAKER_00: Somehow I believe that Rustam will still be able to win this one. Even though Hutchings is in great shape and we saw that with Irakli and you have discussed this in depth a lot. But I have to agree with Irakli on this one that the refereeing was a bit questionable to say the least and I really think that
SPEAKER_01: very much should happen in the future. I gave Irakli my word, you know, the winner of Tata Sings, Rostam Mesh will pull Irakli. Alnus Alnus, the athlete, doesn't accept, but on my mind, Irakli is pulling that Mesh.
SPEAKER_02: Yes, I would like to say that I am very happy to be here today. How do you think about the fact that you are here today? I would like to say that I am very happy to be here today. I am very happy to be here today. I am very happy to be here today. I am very happy to be here today. I am very happy to be here today. I am very happy to be here today. I am very happy to be here today. I am very happy to be here today. I am very happy to be here today. I am very happy to be here today. I am very happy to be here today. I am very happy to be here today. I am very happy to be here today. I am very happy to be here today. I am very happy to be here today. I am very happy to be here today. I am very happy to be here today. I am very happy to be here today. I am very happy to be here today. I am very happy to be here today. I am very happy to be here today
SPEAKER_02: But everything is still going on. And I am very happy that these cameras are on. And I am very happy that these cameras are on. I am very happy that these cameras are on. I am very happy that these cameras are on.
SPEAKER_02: There's a lot of people who come and go, and there's a lot of people who come and go. And I think that all of this
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, actually, I wanted to discuss this topic with Engin, of maybe introducing camera refereeing, video refereeing to the sport, like attaching the camera to the table, and this would resolve so many long arguing at the table and help refereeing to be effective.
SPEAKER_00: Because we have seen such things applied here and there in different competitions. What does he think about this? I think this would help us a lot. Let's go to the last match of the cards. Michael Todd versus Vitaly Laletin. Levan, tell us whatever you are thinking.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say.
SPEAKER_02: He's a great sportsman, he's in great shape, and he's going to be a great player. I think he's going to be a great player. He's going to be a great player. I think he's going to be a great player.
SPEAKER_02: Somehow I believe in Michael Todd on this one. It might be surprising, but in my vision, I feel that Michael can win this one.
SPEAKER_00: Even though Zlatan is a crazy good athlete, I think he still has a great chance, but I think that he will lose his wrist most likely. He will try to press maybe one or two times that might be successful, but I think his press will get tired quite quickly and then we will have like a crazy battle.
SPEAKER_00: And in that case, I feel that somehow there is a chance for Michael to win this one. Yeah, Todd will be very awkward opponent for the Latin specifically for him. This is how I think. It's very, very hard to flash been Michael.
SPEAKER_01: He even stopped Pushkar. Pushkar had one of the best hits. And two rounds, Michael couldn't stop. But next four rounds, he stopped him. So Pushkar had to win with that.
SPEAKER_02: Well, when I was talking to Gennady, Gennady had a very strong impression, very strong, as he said, and I don't want to say that there was a very strong impression on Kasparin, who was in his prime.
SPEAKER_02: There is no doubt that I am a sportsman. I have a good relationship with Tziplenko. I have a good relationship with Michael. I don't have a bad relationship with Michael. I don't have a bad relationship with Michael. I have a good relationship with Michael. I have a good relationship with Michael. I have a good relationship with Michael. I have a good relationship with Michael. I have a good relationship with Michael. I have a good relationship with Michael. I have a good relationship with Michael. I have a good relationship with Michael. I have a good relationship with Michael. I have a good relationship with Michael. I have a good relationship with Michael. I have a good relationship with Michael. I have a good relationship with Michael. I have a good relationship with Michael. I have a good relationship with Michael. I have a good relationship with Michael. I have a good relationship with Michael. I have a good relationship with Michael. I have a good relationship with Michael. I have a good relationship with Michael. I have a good relationship with Michael. I have a good relationship with
SPEAKER_02: If I had to choose, I would say that I don't want to say that I don't want to be with Michael.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, we have to consider, if you look at other performances, for example, Gennady, whose press is really good. He didn't manage to press through Michael this time. Even Ermes, who was in a crazy good shape. I wouldn't say that it was easy for him. Not that close. Yes, and I think Vitaly's wrist is going to crack.
SPEAKER_00: saw how it cracked against the Emirates. And I think in this case as well, even if we look at Dennis' performance against Michael Todd, even he struggled. I think both matches were like 4-2. Dennis, in his prime, he was not that walking in the park against Michael. So yeah, I think that with the cracked wrist, it's going to be tough for Vitaly.
SPEAKER_02: I would like to say that there is a lot of pressure from the press, especially from the people who are in charge of sports, especially from the people who are in charge of sports, especially from the people who are in charge of sports, especially from the people who are in charge
SPEAKER_00: Also, we have to consider that Michael's press is also quite good. And Vitaly has struggled with the good pressers before. Even with Chafee, who's not famous with his press, he had trouble with even Chafee's press. And I think Vitaly can have trouble on that. I don't know much about Vitaly, but I know him very well.
SPEAKER_02: It's not that I don't want to be a part of the team. I don't want to be a part of the team. I don't want to be a part of the team. I don't want to be a part of the team. I want to be a part of the team.
SPEAKER_00: I think Vitaly's best chance is to go with full speed and without the strap. If he manages to do that out of strap, there is some chance. If it goes to the strap, then his chances diminish right away.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, okay. By the way, Levan, thank you very much for the hospitality. We came to your house and it was a good hospitality in Tbilisi. Also, all that filming that we did, we gave it to
SPEAKER_01: Dexter and they are going to prepare it. I don't know how they are doing right now, but hopefully soon to be out. Other than that, what do you think about the match between the Italian Gladiator versus the Georgian Hulk? What do you think are their chances? Do you know the guy, Hulk guy, closely since you both are from Georgia?
SPEAKER_00: Hello, how are you? First of all, I would like to ask you how you feel about the Italian gladiator, the Georgian people, how did it go? Georgian people, right? Yes, it's a very interesting game, I think. It's a very interesting game for me as a Georgian. It's a very interesting game for me, I think. It's a very interesting game.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know. I don't know.
SPEAKER_02: I'm not a sportsman. I have a lot of experience, and I have a lot of experience in boxing. But I'm not going to say anything about boxing. I'm not going to say anything about boxing. I'm not going to say anything about boxing. I'm not going to say anything about boxing. I'm not going to say anything about boxing. I'm not going to say anything about boxing. I'm not going to say anything about boxing.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, this is an interesting match. Our previous match was also very interesting. Some might say that since Ermis has not defeated Devon yet, he might not have the right to pull with me. But I understand. It's a very important match and
SPEAKER_00: with all due respect to jeremy's i see his preparation he's motivated he progresses his progress is impressive but i will have to break break his heart i will send him back to the ranks i'm not giving up my title
SPEAKER_01: So he says, he's going to break his heart and send back to the somewhere in top 10. So he needs to make his way back to again, you know. .
SPEAKER_02: It's a great pleasure to be here, and I'm very happy to be here. It's a pleasure to be here with you all. I don't want to say that I don't like it or that I don't like it,
SPEAKER_02: Actually, losing to me, he won't move too much lower in the ranks. Probably he will stay wherever he is.
SPEAKER_00: This is a very anticipated match, but it's especially anticipated by me. I've been wanting this match to happen for a while now. And I can say that I have never been this confident in my victory before.
SPEAKER_00: I'm always confident but this time especially there is just no chance I will be winning this one and I'm confident as I can be okay the question he is confident because of his incredible shape or because he didn't like
SPEAKER_01: the community reaction after the last match so it is very personal not not like personal personal but it is something like he needs to like prove that it was only one time thing or it's because of both reasons like why is that why is he like so confident even more confident than any match before
SPEAKER_00: Is it because of your form or because of the reaction you received, that you decided to say something? No, I didn't say anything. I just said what I wanted to say.
SPEAKER_02: Yes, of course, it's not always the case that you have to go to the gym, because in real sports, you can't do one or ten reps at the same time. There is no such thing, it is possible. The main reason is that, first of all, you have to start from the beginning. Then you have to start from the beginning or from the beginning.
SPEAKER_02: I would like to say that, as I said, I am very happy to be able to speak to you today. I am very happy to be able to speak to you today. I am very happy to be able to speak to you today. I am very happy to be able to speak to you today.
SPEAKER_02: I have nothing to prove. Victory is a victory in the sport.
SPEAKER_00: difference in points it might be that most of the fans are used to easy wins from my side but it's a it's always a tough sport and i have nothing to prove to anyone and this is not because of some anger or emotions at the moment i'm confident because first of all because of my shape
SPEAKER_00: The second, because I know my opponent well. And third of all, I know exactly what I need to do. Even now, I'm visualizing. I know exactly how to pull. And with all the logic, with all the rationality, I'm confident as I can be.
SPEAKER_00: And yeah, there is nothing to consider other different ways here. And then one last question. What's your weight right now, Levan?
SPEAKER_02: I'm going to bring the scales now. It's half past 12. I have eaten. In the morning, it would be lighter. But right now, let's see. Whatever it comes, we count one kilo less.
SPEAKER_01: Let's go, Levan. Don't tell me 200 kilo. He looks huge. You look huge. You already, when I was in Tbilisi, you look incredibly big. I don't know what are you now. .
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, when you were in Tbilisi, I was, it was more of a water weight, now I'm more lean. Good chance. Okay, how much is, I cannot really see? 182, I think. 182? Yes, point something.
SPEAKER_01: 183, okay 183 just say one kilo you have the home clothes so 182 and then because it's evening night so in the morning so you are about 181 naked, no food.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, in the mornings I'm 180. I have drank a lot of water right now, right after the training. So, yeah, my morning weight is 180. It depends on whether you're 17, 18, 19 or 20. It depends on the conditions. It depends on the conditions. It depends on the conditions. It depends on the conditions.
SPEAKER_00: on the competition day i will be probably 177 178. uh i'm not watching my weight too much at the moment just trying not to gain too much but uh how much it will go down i usually don't care about that so last time he was about 190 kilo so he took the lesson he will he will not be that big for a competition again so so everything is fine according to the plan
SPEAKER_02: Yes, it's not a big deal. As far as I can remember, there was no conflict. There was no conflict. I was not afraid of that zone. Here, too, it is clear that it is not possible
SPEAKER_00: In my case, due to the health issues was that weight gain, which will not happen at this time. And that's usually what I recommend to other arm wrestlers as well is the fast gain of the weight is usually not a good sign.
SPEAKER_02: Levan, do you think that Ermes has the strongest back pressure in the community? No, I don't think so. I don't think so. I think that Ermes has the strongest back pressure in the community.
SPEAKER_02: I would like to say that I would like to thank you all for your support. I would like to thank you all for your support. I would like to thank you all for your support. I would like to thank you all for your support. I would like to thank you all for your support. I would like to thank you all for your support.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know if Mark was in a position to say that he was going to lose 52 kilos, but he didn't lose 52 kilos. And he didn't lose weight like he did in that video. That's my opinion, and I don't know. He was going to lose weight. I think he was going to lose weight. I don't think so, because I don't think he was in a position to lose weight.
SPEAKER_00: The stronger the Hermes is, the happier I will be. I want him to be the strongest. But to be honest, I have some doubts about his recent videos and the stuff he puts out. For example, that 52 kg for like 25 reps or something.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I have some doubts. It would be nice if Hermes could like demonstrate or wait, use some scales to show the actual thing. Because I don't think that in terms of like middle back pressure, he is that much stronger than Iraklit, for example. And even though I want him to be the strongest version that he can be, I will be only happier for that. Yeah, I still have doubt.
SPEAKER_01: So one last question and then we finish. Does he think that this is going to be a battle at the start between Hermes' back pressure and Levan's wrist? In my opinion, Levan has the strongest wrist. And so there, that will be the determining factor, you know, that Hermes will load and Levan will control. If Levan controls here, like...
SPEAKER_00: then then he's gonna win if he cannot control there may be a similar thing like last time after some point or how does the one see this uh
SPEAKER_02: Well, Ermes is a very strong man. He is very strong in the Tito Pyramid. He is a strong man. He is a strong man. He is a strong man. He is a strong man. He is a strong man. He is a strong man. He is a strong man. He is a strong man. He is a strong man. He is a strong man. He is a strong man. He is a strong man. He is a strong man. He is a strong man.
SPEAKER_02: I was lucky enough to be able to do it. I was lucky enough to be able to do it. I was lucky enough to be able to do it. I was lucky enough to be able to do it. I was lucky enough to be able to do it. I was lucky enough to be able to do it. I was lucky enough to be able to do it.
SPEAKER_00: Actually, I think that the strength of Hermes is his rise through the middle, not with the supinated wrist. I don't see any way that he can take my wrist, that won't be happening.
SPEAKER_00: uh i will be taking his wrist and overall the way he trains that's not the optimal way to take your opponent's wrist i invite hermes to georgia anytime i can show him how to train that and there is no chance he will be taking my wrist
SPEAKER_01: No, no, no. Listen, listen, I don't think Hermes is trying to take Levan's wrist, but Hermes is probably trying to make sure that Levan's wrist is like neutral like this, that Levan cannot curl. I don't think that he's taking, but like does Levan think that he needs to, like his wrist is not taken, but does Levan think that he needs to also control
SPEAKER_01: Hermes is pronated or he doesn't need that he can go like last time what I saw like Hermes was pulling and Levan was taking Hermes's hand but still Hermes has some pronator here does does Levan think that he needs to also control Hermes's pronator or no need that um
SPEAKER_02: Well, you can go there, it's not a problem. You can go there, but... I'm a little worried about the situation in Taiwan, that... something will happen. I mean, I'm very worried about the situation in Taiwan, with Elme. Well, if you go there, my opinion is that...
SPEAKER_02: I can say that I have a lot of problems physically, and if the machine works like this, I can't say that...
SPEAKER_02: In fact, if 40-50% of the people would go to school, they would go to school, they would go to school, they would go to school, they would go to school, they would go to school, they would go to school, they would go to school, they would go to school, they would go to school, they would go to school, they would go to school, they would go to school, they would go to school, they would go to school, they would go to school,
SPEAKER_00: uh yeah i might need to uh control his pronator but to be honest i don't think i will need that too much i think the head hand strength will be much superior and considering how i won in the previous time with
SPEAKER_00: with the state that I was in and my current shape is much better now. And yeah, I want to give hope to the viewers, but there's not much to hope from that side.
SPEAKER_01: So he's telling people to don't have false hopes. Yeah. Okay. And the last super chat is from Zuby. Love you Engin from Canada. Devon was my favorite until I saw Levan on Larry's channel. Keep going strong and hopefully arm wrestling grows even more.
SPEAKER_01: Thank you very much. And guys, thank you very, very much for watching us. And Levan Saginashvili, as always, it has been an honor to host you. And thank you very much, Tornike, for translating. And people are asking also, Levan, why Levan never posts any videos? They are asking.
SPEAKER_01: And do you believe those kind of things that we believe over here? Like when you show a lot of things that because of the eye, you know, there may be injury or something, or like you are just hiding as a strategy from your opponent, like to not to give him any information? Or what is the reason you don't share anything? I don't share anything.
SPEAKER_02: As you can see, it's a bit dark outside, which is a disadvantage for me. The second thing is that the videos on YouTube are my own and my intention is to edit a Georgian movie and something like that.
SPEAKER_02: There are several reasons here. First of all is that I'm focused on the training more and not thinking about the shooting videos that much.
SPEAKER_00: um which i think uh is not the best uh probably i could be more focused on that uh on the second uh hand my brother uh who is filming me usually uh he's now busy with uh editing uh georgian movie uh upcoming one uh and the third reason is that uh i don't want to disappoint hermes too much i want him to have hope he doesn't want to do everything he doesn't want to
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I want him to believe till the last minute.
SPEAKER_01: Right after he comes to the table. As he comes to the table, then he will show everything. That's what he's saying. Whenever I asked Hermes what was the score of that match, I think he said it was 4-2. I said, Hermes, you also didn't come to the table. You were also breathing heavy. And he said, but I didn't have oxygen mask. He still thinks that I will give him two again?
SPEAKER_01: I love that. I love that. Yeah. But listen, Hermes is not coming there to lose. I'm not saying he's not going to lose or he's going to win, but he is not coming there to lose. He's coming there to beat you. He said his biggest dream is the morning that
SPEAKER_01: like morning or the night that he beat you and he wake up as number one. He says, this is his biggest dream. Do you think it will happen?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah, I understand. I know it, but it's too early for him to dream these things. First, he has to even beat Devin and he has no right of dreaming that way. Oh, okay. So Levan says that
SPEAKER_01: that he, Hermes, to have chance to beat Levan, first he needs to be good enough to beat Devon, and then he can beat Levan. Okay, the shots are fired. As an organizer, I like it. I like it. Tomorrow you will see the posters. Levan's like, not really. Hermes is using fake weight.
SPEAKER_01: I don't want him to get hurt now with the real weight. Levan just can't stop. Levan just can't stop. Just wait. Let's pass this King of the Table 14 and then I will have both of you on the podcast and then you can...
SPEAKER_01: fire the shots yeah yeah anyways once again that's enough you know for now we will have a lot of good times hopefully thank you very very much levan thank you my friend thank you tronic and tell your families my family yeah hello take care guys take care stay safe bye
