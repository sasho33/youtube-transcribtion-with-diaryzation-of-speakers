Host: How do I pronounce your last name? Janeheim. Say again? Janeheim. Janeheim? Yes. Okay, okay. And yours is not Reisig, but Reisig? Yes. Okay, okay. So I have been pronouncing wrong.
Host: So how are you ladies doing? Great, thank you. How are you? I met the Europeans. Yeah. And all day, all day coaching, translating, doing all kinds of things. And now doing the podcast from the hotel room. And yeah, this is very important match. Very important match. Ford us, it is important. Yes.
Host: Oh, I mean for everyone, everyone who knows armwrestling, this is a very important match. But for the people that think armwrestling is
Host: they would, they may not care, but I don't care about them either. You know, because, because I know how important this match, you know, this match will determine the best 70 kilo right arm, female armwrestler in the world. And I think three years ago, you ladies pull. And I think right time, you want the left time you want Allen, right? I want the left arm and the right arm.
Host: But she beat me one match in right. Yeah, I saw that. Yeah, I saw that. Yeah. So about this match, I'm very, very confused, you know, very confused about like what to think about this match. I will explain why I'm confused. One reason is that Elin is very, very young. So when you are very, very young,
Host: Three years mean a ton. And from other side, Fia, I have never ever seen you this strong as last a few years. And I'm very, very old also. People says the same thing about Tata Shinks while he's probably almost 20 years older than you.
Host: Yeah, so I mean like when you pull Maleen, I was thinking that there was a possibility or to flash pin you, you know, some rounds, you know, the question was if you could stop her and because we remember the WL match and so there was a possibility and but it didn't go that way and
Host: results, you know, also show, you know, how good you are. So I don't know what to think. Like, three years ago, you were a bit ahead, as you said, that you lost one match. And now, three years later, you are in different level, while it has been three years, and Allen, 100%, that she's stronger, much stronger. So does it make you nervous?
Fia Reisek: that it has been three years and even three years ago it was close and she is young. You understand my question? Yes, yes, definitely. Yeah, I know she's stronger. It makes me. It makes me excited, not.
Fia Reisek: And I'm always nervous about every match, I do. But Eileen is special also because she has been like chasing us for so long. And she, from the beginning, she was just a little girl and we could keep her away for a while. But when she like started to be a grown up, she showed us that she
Fia Reisek: is really in the top league. And it's always hard to have that small kids coming up being better than you. Yeah, it's exciting and nervous and like... Yeah, but it will be super fun. I'm excited about this.
Host: yeah yeah um you know last time you pull malin i think she has defeated you before you beat her in wl and i don't know if it was last time but so you were pulling against malin that she beat you in wl so about which match
Fia Reisek: you are concerned more, like you were concerned more about Malin or more about Elin? Maybe I shouldn't ask this question. Yeah, but I know it's different. I was not concerned about Malin. I just wanted to show myself that I can get better.
Fia Reisek: And I thought, like you, that even if I can stop that hit once, I will show myself that I've been better. Elin is different because I have everything to lose against her. She's the hunter this time, and I'm the defender, and that's always hard to be in that position.
Host: So can we say that Malin was dangerous because of that explosiveness, while Elin is someone who is actually like, it doesn't matter if the match stops or something, like she's a threat all match long, you know, it doesn't matter. She's also very explosive, Elin is super explosive, but she's also super
Host: strong. If she gets stopped on the match, then it's scary. Yeah, yeah, I just didn't want to. And also my opinion that Aileen
Host: was the only one that was competing the IFA and had very good chance to win WAF, just my opinion. And now, the powerful girl is now pulling. And Elin, I think I remember you, like long ago, you were like 14 years old when you won the juniors?
Host: I was 13 years old when I won the Europeans. Under 18? Yes. It's 10 years ago. You were 13 years old, you beat the 18 year old girls. And everyone was talking about you. I was there. And they were like, did you know that she's only 13? And that moment, then we already knew it was just a matter of time that you were going to become something special. We all knew that.
Host: Now you are pulling against Fia Reisek and in my opinion no doubt she is a legend and probably one of the gods of female armwrestling and what are your thoughts about this match? My thoughts about this match? I'm super excited because I know Fia is super strong and I'm
Elin Janeheim: very excited because I haven't competed against her since, it's three years ago, we competed against each other. So, and in my opinion, I am different at the competition. How do you say that in English? Then in practice. Yeah, then in practice. Yeah. So
Host: It will be interesting and I'm super excited to... Okay, I missed something. You said you are better in competition than practice. Why did you say that? I missed that part. Did you guys pull in practice? Sometimes, yes. Okay, when was it?
Host: Also quite long ago. It was a long ago because I... No, no. Was it after that tournament match? Yes. Okay. Okay. But then from what you said, what I understood is that she was better than you at the practice because you felt like you needed to mention that. Am I wrong? No, you're not wrong.
Elin Janeheim: I'm much better at competitions than at practice because I have a different focus at competitions.
Host: her how many titles you have and she's gonna go like five minutes and I don't know like she doesn't know same as Egle when I ask Egle how many world titles you have she goes like I stopped counting a long time ago and yeah so how do you see your chances Elin? Arsen you nervous? Yes I am nervous and that's good that's how it should be yeah and also excited and I think it will be great matches
Host: between me and FIIA. That's all I... Okay, another question, Helen. Do you expect a war? Yes, I do. Or do you have a goal to dominate? Or you think that there is no way it will be a war, you know, only war? I think it's going to be a war. And FIIA, that's not your plan. I think it's not your plan. I think your plan is to...
Fia Reisek: Always plan to take the easy way, but I have been practicing the endurance After I knew about this match because I I Imagine that if it stops then it will be war and I'm not Very comfortable in in those kinds of matches. So Yeah, you you classify yourself
Fia Reisek: as an explosive puller? Uh, it's like either I win, uh, or I lose it's my, my matches are quite fast, uh, either way. Uh, so when it stops, I'm like, not, uh, used to that. Does it matter what kind of position the match stops? Uh,
Fia Reisek: Not really. I think Eileen have this like voyeur brain. So she's like, if she stops like one centimeter from the pad, she will not give up. And if I'm tired, she will feel that and then she will scream her way up from there. And then I'm gonna get panicked and
Host: Come on, you are still writing with like 20 world titles. I'm joking. I think your trainer will help you with the mental preparation. I think that if Giannis is listening, what you are saying now, I don't think he will like, you will panic and this and that. I know, I know.
Host: But I'm getting better with that. It's better now than it has been. I don't know. We will see. But another thing is that, like, yes, there is a competition, but at the end, the title will still stay in Sweden. Yeah. Yeah. The last world title match was also between Malin and
Host: how great the, especially the female Armwrestlers from Sweden, it has always been that way. It has always been this. Yeah. Yeah. So we are winners either way. Sort of. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, so Elin, how do you see your chance?
Elin Janeheim: Let's go there. Nice chances to win. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. How to explain? I think, in my opinion, I think it's possible to win. Yeah. But I know that Fia is super strong, so she can also win. It's like you never know when it's time. Oh, it's like 50-50. It may go.
Elin Janeheim: I think it depends on if you have a bad day or a good day for both of us. How tired we are. It's a time difference, you know. Do you ladies really believe in a good day and bad day or is it all about physical and mental preparation? I think it's also
Host: a lot of physical and mental preparations. But it is, of course. What can happen that day that it may not be your day? Or do we say this when we lose as an excuse? I'm not talking about you ladies, but generally, that, oh, I had a bad day, you know, or maybe the guy was better that day, you know. Listen, I'm just having a friendly conversation, just trying to find out.
Fia Reisek: bad day, you know, because you ladies are this level. I think we have no excuse to have a bad day, you know. It doesn't have to be an excuse, really. But if you believe that I have the power to to be the winner and I lose, then it's like I have to explain for myself that I lost now because I had the
Fia Reisek: a bad day and my opponent had a good day. But if it was the opposite... What's a bad day and good day? When you say bad day or good day, it sounds like you didn't perform well that day. But what if you perform and the opponent was still better? Yeah, but then it's... If you are mentally ready and you have been prepared really good, you have no pain, you have
Fia Reisek: You have really nothing to put into your head that this can go wrong. You are on top of
Host: of yourself and you believe in yourself and everything, then if you lose, then you can't say it was a bad day, really. But if you wake up, I have a headache, I'm tired, I feel like... But that's why I say that preparation, that's what I meant, that when you are professional, you are going to a world title match. And this world title is heavier than any titles in the history.
Host: going like, boom, boom, boom, boom. And then you would have an excuse. But if it is up to you, then I think we all need to be responsible for going there healthy. Of course, sometimes we get injured and everything. And what is your opinion about your chance, Fia? I know that you like when you are confident and I want to be confident too, but
Fia Reisek: I want to say that it is 60-40% for me. And that is based on your feelings? Yeah, my good preparation.
Host: Aha. Okay. So you are saying that, so it means that you feel like you progress more than she did in last three years. But I can't really know. Okay. Why did you lose that one round? You know, according to you, did you make a mistake? Did you, you didn't know her? She surprised you, you underestimated her or she was just, and what was the difference in the final and super final?
Fia Reisek: Yeah, she really surprised me, really. Because it was a good match for me, really. I had the start and I was on my side, but she took it and then she
Fia Reisek: gas me out and win. So it was very, it was nothing like, I can't say anything more than that. And then what was the change, you know, for the final and super final? I wanted to beat her.
Fia Reisek: First match, when you lost, you didn't want to beat her? No, but I was surprised. But then the second match, I knew what I needed to put in. But did you attack to different spots or something? Or you were just more serious? I'm not really that... I'm not a tactic puller. I just put some more... Isn't Janis training you? He is, but not the tactics.
Fia Reisek: He is good at that one, mostly. I know. I think he gave up that long ago because I haven't learned. So he just gives me training schedules and leave me alone with that because I probably do everything wrong also. He gave up on that. I don't know. You are a great puller. But the thing is that you are also East versus West left-arm champion. Yeah.
Host: and you couldn't do any change to change the results. And do you think that, okay, what would be your chance against her if it was a left arm match, you know, like three months later? And then it's opposite. Then it's 60-40. Oh, really? So you believe that she may be the best left hand under 70 kilos in the world? Yes.
Host: Oh, but do you, do you want to find out? Yes. Okay. Okay. Okay. So because that much also has to happen. And I think that Gabriella versus Barbara left arm also need to happen. Yeah. Um, and Allen, let's listen the three years ago from you this time. Can you say it again? Okay.
Host: What happened three years ago, you beat her once and she beat you twice. So we now listen from her point of view. And what was from your point of view? Did you believe you could beat her when you come to the competition or are you surprised yourself or? No, I believe that I could. You believe that, okay. Yes. It was only in my mind back then.
Elin Janeheim: Yeah, but okay. Back then only or even now? No, no, no. Every time I compete against her. But that time everything felt great. Especially in both arms, but especially left arm since I won in left arm. And then right arm you won. How long was the match?
Elin Janeheim: Maybe around the 30 seconds. Okay. Yeah. And where do you think that you made any mistake or she adjusted? How do you do the final matches? The first final match, I am proud of myself. I was proud of myself that I stopped her and could pull over to my side and win.
Elin Janeheim: And the other match, I don't know what happened. She was super fast and I wasn't ready, I think. Okay, okay, okay. Yeah, you beat her in the qualification and she beat you in the final. Okay, so she didn't send you to the B-side in the first match.
Elin Janeheim: Okay. And how was the first match? The first match, I think Fia won easy in the qualifications. And in the finals, I wanted to give her a match. And then, yes, I ended up in... I turned to 1-1.
Host: Another question is that you guys, you ladies pulled the left arm first, right? Yeah. Yes. Okay. When you beat her left arm, did it like probably like it made your belief even stronger to beat her with right arm as well? Yes. Yeah. And this was the, the same tout even before the matches or left arm just made it
Elin Janeheim: more possible in your mind? Yes, I think my left arm, it has always been, in my opinion, it's my best arm. Oh, okay. Yes. And another question, Elin. Last three years, how much do you think you've progressed? I don't know. It's hard to say. But you've progressed, right? Ford sure.
Elin Janeheim: But if I think against FIA in that way, I have progressed a lot. Not just in strength, much in technique also. So I think I'm smarter at the table. Smarter than your opponent? Yes. Or smarter than yourself before?
Host: Smarter than I was before. Okay. Maybe smarter than my opponents, who knows? I'm not sure, but for sure not more experienced than your opponent. Sorry, what did you say? Probably not more experienced than your opponent. No. No. Yeah. Okay, it will be a great match and yeah, we will see. Fia.
Host: You say 60-40. And how many title matches you won? Left arm once and the right arm once, right? Yes. Yes. So you beat Nikki Sheva with left arm and Malin with right arm. Yes. Yeah. Anyway, so do you ladies think that there is one more person that could be a challenge?
Fia Reisek: to you ladies on this earth. Just think about everyone. Do you think there is someone... In 70 kilos? In under 70 kilos, yeah. In under 70 kilos. Yes, of course. I believe so. I think that the light girls are scary. Like Dimitrina and Karo are
Fia Reisek: Great. Dimitrina and who? Carolina Pettersson. Oh, Carolina. Dimitrina is around 60 kilos, so under 70. But she could do much damage in 70 kilos. If she competed at Worlds in 70 kilos, I think she would show that she's really a 70 kilo girl. So do you think that as a 60 kilo person,
Fia Reisek: she can pull you ladies and can be a problem? I believe so. Caro believes so too. And Caro has pulled with her, so she has more on her feet than I do. But if she says so, then I believe her.
Host: Okay, Jeremy Browning and Family says, do you all know who Andre the Giant was? If so, would you consider Levan to be the Andre of Armwrestling? I don't. Oh, so we need, you are saying that we need to call Levan
Host: OK, I understand. I don't know. I don't know. I think that that guy was the WWE guy. I think we are, if it is, then I think we are more serious sport. So Levan can be compared with, like, most likely someone like Alexander Karlin or something, you know, maybe Alexander...
Host: had a better career, but Levan still has some time in front of him. John Augustine said, Sweden, the most beautiful armwrestling nation in the world. And then, of course, a super chat comes from, no surprise, just, you tell me, who can that be? No surprise. Who would be very, very interested in this match?
Host: Yeah, Swedish armwrestling television. This match has been on demand in Sweden for years, so I'm happy that I'm here to see this. Big fan of both Elin and Fia, yeah. I know that you are a big fan of female armwrestling and also especially for the ladies from Sweden, yeah.
Host: My first favorite ever female armwrestler was Heidi Anders. Yeah, like I was inspired, you know, by her. Because in those years, like after especially Russians got involved, Russians and Ukrainians got involved, there were not many ladies from West side
Host: You know, and like West Europe, I can say, I don't know. It's not really West, but I'm saying that not Soviet, all Soviet countries. And Heidi Anderson was very dominant. And like, she was very impressive. And then I think next Malin and you. Yeah. And then the other ladies, yeah, started. But I think there was one lady,
Fia Reisek: Anna Pettersson or something. You guys ever heard that? Yeah. Yeah. I met her. Yeah. You met her? Yeah. Yeah. Not on a competition table, but I met her with Andreas Rundström a couple of years ago and we trained a little bit and she was still very explosive and
Host: Andreas is also another legend that we need to mention when we have two ladies from Sweden. Andreas is probably maybe the biggest male legend from Sweden.
Fia Reisek: It had a very interesting style with the arm open like this. I was so impressed with him. He was my inspiration when I was a kid.
Fia Reisek: you couldn't compete in a higher weight class than two above your own for a while. And he, I know he put in like a big weight under his shirt. Yes, he did. And then he beat everyone in that class too. And it was like,
Host: He was a star. Yes, yes, he was. And he has like never been a loud showman or something. He just goes there, very quiet guy. I mean, I don't even know how many times I heard something from him. You know, he was usually quiet and with a beard in his hand, you know. Yeah. Another guy to mention.
Host: that really served a lot to Swedish armwrestling is Charles Minnell. Charlie Minnell, sorry. Charlie Minnell. I don't know, Allen, if you met his time, but he had the best armwrestling websites. What was it? Armwrestling World, or what was it? World of Armwrestling? World of Armwrestling.
Host: Yeah, I've been on that website. Allen knows better than we do. Yeah, and Allen, I mean, who trained you? Like, how did you get involved? I know that Heidi Anderson was training the kids and everything. Arsen you one of those kids? No, I come from another community. It's about 70 kilometers away from Storuman, where Heidi is training.
Elin Janeheim: I come from Sorsele and I started arm wrestling, it's almost 15 years ago. I started when I was nine years old. So you are 24 this year? 23 this year, so 14, but almost. So you are still at the, like, you're 23? Yes. And do you plan to compete or you just focus on the senior? Senior.
Host: A lot of really strong U23 pullers, they just skip the youth and then just directly compete. Seniors, yeah. Okay, sorry, who was your trainer again? My father helped me in the beginning. Was he an armwrestler as well? No.
Elin Janeheim: we learned from each other and we helped each other. And yes, so it's big thanks to him that I won the Europeans in 2015.
Elin Janeheim: Okay. And, and, and, but he was your trainer and, but which club did you go? Like, did you just train with your father and then come? I got to a club in social called social arm sport. Uh, and we started to train there. And, uh, after a while, it was just me that, uh, was still training arm wrestling in the club. So
Elin Janeheim: me and my father started to train with each other and we started to drive to Storuman, 70 kilometers. And yeah, it started like that. When you go to Storuman, did you learn anything from there as well? Yes, of course. A lot. And who helped you? Everyone or just? Everyone. Yes.
Elin Janeheim: They have an arm wrestling school there. And so I pulled with the guys who were much older than me. But it was great for me in the beginning to go to Storuman. Another question, you were 13 and you won under 18 years old category. So how did like this happen? You know, like when I ask you this, like
Elin Janeheim: And then, or like, what do you think that the reason was? I don't remember anyone 13 years old. I think it was, it was much genetically back then also. But we had also trained a lot, of course. Yes, of course. Yes. But when I was a kid, I was much stronger than everyone else.
Host: Even before armwrestling, you were very strong girl. That's what I was guessing. I just wanted to ask in here because that's not normal, you know, because when you competed in 2015, armwrestling was already well established and Russians were competing. Everyone was competing and you just go in there.
Host: But from 13 to 18, you actually grow, you know, like you are, like, I don't want to say you were like a kid, you know, 13 years old, you being 18 years old, like a young girl, you know, like, imagine that, like, you are still even two years younger than top limit of the U15. Imagine that today someone 13
Host: special with your genetics, yeah. Anyway, so I will not, I usually steer the pot, you understand, and between the opponents I try to hype the event.
Host: I think that this is a beautiful competition and I'm very excited for the armwrestling world, you know, that two ladies that deservingly, you know, pull in for the world title and I kind of really don't see anyone close
Host: one but I need to be like witnessing you know how this person can do anyway so let's talk about some other matches do you ladies okay I mean FIA usually don't follow everything so it's okay we got used to but but do you follow armwrestling or do you like there are
Host: their own and some just are fan that follows everything. So where are you? I think I focus on my own. Okay, so I just asked this in advance so that I'm trying to have an idea like about the prediction, you know, if I will have another fear incidents or
Host: okay let me let me go let me go and start listen ladies if you don't have much um information about the match you don't have to i mean answer so you can say that i'm not familiar so wallace dilly ricard bornman i don't know of them ellen no no
Host: Okay, this one is from the U.S., the other one from Australia. Okay. Okay. And Fia Reisek versus Allen Janeheim. Oh, that much I know. Okay. So, what is, you have to say the prediction of that match. You said already, you said already. I'm just teasing you ladies, you know, yeah.
Host: I don't know about them. I don't know. Where are they from? One is US, the other one is Canada. Okay. Devon't tell me you don't know them. I know this match. I know them. Okay. Let's go. Right arm, okay.
Fia Reisek: I think Morozov wins that one. Okay, does it have any base? Like in a technical way? I just think of Alex like a left arm puller. I've mostly seen him pull left arm, I think.
Fia Reisek: in these events. And Morozov is a right arm puller and is on the top list. So I think. Okay.
Host: left arm world champion before he lost against Laletin. You were there that night. So his left arm is also very good. And Alex, yeah, he pulled some right arm matches and left arm matches. So you believe Artem is going to win. And Elin? Yes, I also think so. You think Artem is going to win? Yes. Do you have any opinion about which fashion he can beat him? No.
Host: Oh, okay. Inside, maybe. Inside? Yes, maybe. Yeah, okay. Pauline versus Arsen Khachatryan. Then I know Pauline, at least. I don't... Where is the other guy from? He's Armenian, but lives in the US. And in his last Supermatch, he beat Andriy Sharkavich in Arlington.
Host: East versus West. Was it an easy match or a hard match? I think he lost one round and then he won the following rounds. This is how I remember. And Pauline has been also very good lately. He won some matches, he lost some matches. He lost against Rustam and Krasimir and then he beat, lately, Davit Samusek. Yeah, that's what I remember.
Fia Reisek: Uh, then I, I will give a shot for Pauline then. Okay. And Elin? I don't know them. You don't know them? You don't know Pauline? No. Okay. Matt Mask versus Irakli Zirakashvili, left arm. Woo. Uh, I think Irakli will win. Even though Matt Mask has also been crazy
Host: strong on his last event, but I think Irakli will win. Okay, and you know them, Elin? Yes, I think Irakli will win. Okay, looks like you and Fia will agree about the predictions. Okay, let's go to the next one.
Host: okay this one is joseph meranto versus ivan portela i don't know okay sorry do you ladies know manuel battaglia from italy no no he's world champion super heavyweight champion yeah yeah for sure you ladies are not really following but you are just focused on your own uh goals yeah
Host: Yeah, he's pulling against Wagner, Bortalato. I'm sure you guys know Wagner. Yeah, Wagner I know. Yes.
Host: Let me see if Allen knows Wagner or not. No. Allen doesn't know Wagner Portolazzo. He's from Brazil. You have seen him. He's like pulling like big trash cans and pressing. He's like super... Maybe I have seen him. Every match he's trying to break my armresting table. And I think his nickname is...
Host: Yeah, and yeah. You. OK, maybe I have seen him. OK, OK, OK. And. Michael Todd versus Georgii Dzeranov. Allen. Allen knows Michael Todd, but I know Michael Todd, but not the other.
Fia Reisek: Not that this is Eleanor? No. So I don't know. OK, yeah. We need to make Allen become an Armwrestling fan as much as how great Armwrestler she is. She will be like me. She will notice some matches when she are in these events and see some. And then she'll learn about those pullers. And then the rest will be just
Host: How about you, Fia? Do you know Georgii Dzeranov? No. Come on. You don't know Dzeranov? Yes, I know. Yes. OK. But any opinion? Who did he pull last time?
Host: He pulled left arm against Kamil. And he lost. Yeah, he lost, yeah. Kamil is very dangerous warrior. Yes, yes. You know Kamil, right, Fia? Yes, yes. Okay, okay. Yes. But did he pull right?
Fia Reisek: I mean, he pulled right arm, he withdrew us, but he lost against Vitaly Laletin. And this is a right match? Right arm match, yes. Michael Todd is always hard to predict because he's so difficult on the table. So anything can happen.
Host: He beat a lot of guys that I thought would beat him. So... So you probably feel yourself closer to Michael because you know him and you speak English and you support Michael. Am I correct? You can give that to Michael. Okay, okay. How about this match, Elin? Left arm.
Host: You know the guy, right? You know the Devon guy? Yes, and I know Alex. You know Alex? Yes, I've heard of him. You just predicted his match against Arthur Morozov with right arm. Yeah, but now I know for sure. So you don't know Alex Kurdecha? Yes, I know Alex. OK, Alex Kurdecha and Devon. So you are on this card, but you... OK, OK, yeah.
Elin Janeheim: And who do you think is going to win? Alex and Devon. This is left arm. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. And he's pulling first Devon and then second Morozov. I think Alex is going to win.
Host: Alex. Oh, Alex is going to beat Devon. Hmm. Okay. And Fia. Not everyone can be a champion, Fia. No. I know. Listen, listen. Let's clear that thing. When Devon lost against Gennady, you told Devon, Devon, don't worry. Not everyone can be a champion.
Host: And, but he, it sounded like, you know, you are not good enough to be champion, but probably you meant probably you meant that like two guys are pulling and one needs to win. One needs to lose. That's what you meant. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We have talked this through. He's, he's fine with me now. I know. I know. I know. But it's still funny to remember that, you know? Yeah. Yeah.
Fia Reisek: No, but I think... I think Devon will win. Okay. Okay, so... I'm glad this isn't a real competition with points and stuff, because then I would... Say again?
Host: I'm glad this isn't a competition to know all the predictions or to score all the predictions right. Yeah, see next time we plan, like when your ladies are in the card again next time, like whoever did not study the rest of the cards and
Host: about the six matches, you will start the match like this. Yeah. Yeah. I would say something like that. Yeah. OK. Levan Levan Saginashvili versus Ermes Gasparini. Allen, don't tell me you don't know them. I know them. OK, good. Let's go. First of all, who do you think is going to win?
Elin Janeheim: or who has more chance? And second question is, who do you want to win? I think Levan is going to win. And who do you support? I don't know, but I think Levan is going to win, so maybe I support Levan. I don't know. Did you see their first match? No. No?
Fia Reisek: Okay, let's go Fia. I also think, how is Levan doing now? He have been hurt or have been sick or something? No. He just have not been competing because he have not had any... No, no, he pulled against Jerry Cadoret last December. And as you know, Levan is pulling twice a year.
Host: Some people say, hey, you know, Levan, you're pulling, like, very seldom, you know, it's not good, you know. And then, when you said Levan, they are like, oh, this is a mismatch. I mean, these are the best guys, you know. So, from one side, they say Levan is not pulling often, and from other side, I mean, just say that Levan is pulling four times a year. Who are you going to set him against?
Fia Reisek: Yes, I understand. There are a few people that, you know, can have a chance against him. So how can you really expect Levan to pull, like, so many matches, you know? Yeah. Yeah, go ahead. That's how it is to be best. It was a great match they had last time, I believe. But I think Levan
Fia Reisek: will win but then it would be this is always the hard part being the best also that everyone kind of hoping that you will lose someday and it it would be fun for everyone if he lost against except for him maybe against Ermes
Host: By the way Devon wrote a message Devon says it's still her sphere That that that is on you they will stay there like Till the end of the time, you know, yes. Yeah, and so you are Supporting Ermes. Yeah, and Do you think Ermes is favorites?
Host: I don't think he's the favorite though. But do you think he has a chance? Yes. He has a chance, okay. Yes. And did you watch their last match? Yes. You saw, right? Yeah. And were you surprised those a few times that you know... Yeah, it was a great match. He did really good. So hopefully he...
Fia Reisek: believes more in himself now that he has the chance to take a win. Elin, before we finish, who has been your favorite Armwrestler? Heidi Andersson, since I started. Heidi Andersson? Yes. When I started, she was my biggest idol.
Fia Reisek: And also Fia was one of my biggest idols when I started. Not anymore. Now we are rivals. And Fia is yours. Who's your favorite Armwrestler? Oh, I think you asked me that before, and I don't really remember who I said, but it might change, you know.
Fia Reisek: OK, I asked this before and you don't remember what you said about your favorite. No, but I, Andreas Rundström is one of my absolute favorites. Girls, Irina Makeva, impressive. Egle, Heidi, of course, Heidi is the only girl who have beaten Irina Makeva in a competition, both in right and left arm. Not even Gabby did that. So she is like,
Fia Reisek: super special and have also impressed a lot of people and surprised us all. But she's my cousin, so it's weird to say that she's my hero, or maybe not. Okay, a little bit confusing, but yeah.
Elin Janeheim: Elin, do you know who is Irina Makeva? Yes. Okay, what do you think about her? I also had her as an idol when Svea started to talk about her, but it changes sometimes, because when Irina was competing, I really liked to see her compete and perform.
Host: You were following her as well, you know. You were curious how she was performing. Yes. And that little girl now has grown, and now herself is going for a world title in the professional armwrestling, East versus West, yeah. Yeah, that is, and trust me, now,
Host: a lot of young girls are following you, Elin, and they will also take you as their example, especially if you beat Fia. Yeah. Anyways, ladies, do you have any last words to each other or to the fans, you know, anything you want to add?
Fia Reisek: No, not really. Good luck with your preparation, Elin, and have a nice trip. And I see you in Chicago. And good luck to you too. And you too. Thank you. Two very friendly ladies, but
Host: this, when they come to the table, then you see the biggest warriors. And I'm sure there will be a lot of screaming, a lot of like, I don't know how to say, hitting to the table and things like that.
Host: We will see. I just can't wait. And I'm very curious about the outcome. As I said at the beginning, I'm very confused because as I'm going to repeat again, Fia, you are incredible lately. And this young lady was already great three years ago. And now from 20 to 23, I remember how much I progressed and I only can
Host: imagine how much she progressed and just a big question mark. We are Raysek versus Elin, one more time say, Janeheim. Janeheim. Janeheim. Okay. Thank you again. And I wish you ladies best of luck. Please stay safe. Devon't get injured and have a wonderful trip and good luck to both of you. Thank you.
Host: Thank you. Arsen you coming again? No. And yeah, thanks to everyone who has been watching us. And thank you, Fia, for coming. And thank you, Elin. And Elin, nice to meet you. I don't think we ever talk in person, but it was nice to meet you. Once again, take care. Thank you. Thank you. Bye. Bye.
