Devon't talk, don't say anything anymore, you know. You are armwrestling fan and from one of the best nations about armwrestling and in your city, Tbilisi,
Engin Terzi: There is Georgii national championships and you are not going there to watch. And you don't even exactly know where the national championships are. You are saying, I think, you know, it's there, you know. Okay, I'm very disappointed. I'm spoiled rotten. I'm spoiled. Yeah, because you are now so famous and spoiled, you know. Hello, Daniel. How are you, my friend? Hello, hello. Good? You are good? I'm fine. Fine? That's good. That's good.
Engin Terzi: I should call you Dr. Daniel. Yeah. And how are you, Arthur? Can he hear us? Arthur, do you hear us? Hello, Arthur.
Artur Makarov: Yeah, anyways. Arthur, do you hear us? Connecting all to you. I think now he can. Do you hear me? Hello, now I can hear you. Yes, hello. Now it's here. Yeah. How are you, Arthur? Good? Yes, okay, everything is good, thank you. Everything is good. I just have another phone. I was very worried that I would not be able to connect.
Alex (Translator): everything's good thank you i'm i'm from a different phone so i was worried that i couldn't connect but now everything works okay that's good that's good okay
Engin Terzi: okay so let me okay i put on instagram as well so how is everything going daniel good yeah these guys um they don't get as much as credit they deserve as deserve you know um
Engin Terzi: To me, this match is as good as any match.
Engin Terzi: And it is a lightweight category. And can you ask them, is that the only one time they met each other, which was the European Championship final with right arm? Is that the only time? The final in Europe was the only time you fought, right? Yes, yes. In 2017. He was completely beaten after Irakli, I think, so we didn't fight with him normally.
Engin Terzi: he was very tired after iraqli so we couldn't iraq yeah i remember yeah yeah yeah i will tell you something you will not hear any zero i mean like zero trash talk from these guys but you will hear only one hour full respect mutual respect if you realize it artan already said
Alex (Translator): When he met Daniel, Daniel was already very tired in the final. He didn't say, I win. He said, yeah. He said, yeah. He said, yeah. He said, yeah. He said, yeah.
Artur Makarov: Daniel and I have a good and friendly relationship. I think he will confirm that. We never had a conflict. We only met once, although we fought in the same weight category quite often. Daniel can confirm as well. We have a very good relationship, we are very good friends. So many years we pulled in the same category and we pulled together only once.
Engin Terzi: yeah yeah that's interesting very interesting yeah i i think a few times because daniel only put left arm right arm he skip it and uh daniel i think 2018 you pull on your left arm yeah yeah and 2017 hungary also you pull on the left arm yeah yeah yeah yeah that that those are the times that left arm daniel was winning and right arm
Engin Terzi: Arthur was winning. And now, yeah, we will see how it will be.
Engin Terzi: I'm very excited. And tell them my job will be very hard, you know, them being super respectful to each other. There is no way that I can stir the pot here. I don't think I will try. Ford me, it's very difficult. As an organizer, I have to warm up the match as much as possible so that people are interested. But here, I'm sure, it will be so difficult that I won't even try to beat you one on one, you know. Let them even try.
Alex (Translator): Yeah, yeah. You shouldn't even try. There's no way. No way? Yeah. But Arthur told you that you are so weak, Daniel. Yeah, I'm weak. I weigh only 79 now, not 85 anymore.
Alex (Translator): Daniel, do you want me to beat you? I weigh 76.5 kg. I'm looking at my future opponents.
Engin Terzi: We have some unfinished business, Engin. Okay, yes, I agree, I agree. It's right here. But first, I want to pull Mindaugas. It looks like Mindaugas got really angry. Mindaugas makes me angry, he talks.
Engin Terzi: you know but i i love me in that because i i love all of these guys these these guys like superstars for me yeah
Engin Terzi: Okay, I know that they are very respectful to each other. They will only say positive things, you know, but can they tell me honestly their winning chance? But listen, they tell them to answer if they are going to honestly answer. If they are going to be, oh, friendly, 50-50 or something, it may really be 50-50 in their head. But I mean, let them say only if they really mean it.
Alex (Translator): Not to be nice and respectful. I'm very interested. I understand that you respect each other so much. I want to hear an honest answer. I'm just interested in how you see your chances of winning this match. I'll start.
Artur Makarov: When we had a video call with Mindaugas and Omer, I always gave preference to myself. With Mindaugas it was 55-45, with Omer it was 60-40.
Artur Makarov: Daniel and I never got involved because it wasn't exactly the fight we needed. It was the final of the European Championship in 2017, I think.
Artur Makarov: And that's why I don't know Daniel to the full extent. That's why I can't say and give preference to anyone. It will really be objective. And I personally believe that it will really be 50-50. If I had fought with him before and joined, I could say a slightly different ratio. But since I don't know
Alex (Translator): You can go back and watch my previous with Mindaugas and Omer. I gave myself 55% against Mindaugas, I gave myself 60% against Omer, but here I think it's 50-50 because the only time that I pulled Daniel was 2017.
Alex (Translator): i didn't get much info from that i just don't really know how he pulls because that one time wasn't representative of how good daniel actually is he was so tired so i can't objectively say anything different other than 50 50 because that's how i see it and i just can't compare myself because i i haven't pulled him fresh for fresh yeah but he hasn't pulled omari that he he gave himself 60.
Artur Makarov: Yes, yes, because I analyzed his fight at the European Championships. I'm sorry, the World Championships. That was because I was watching his matches on Worlds and I was just assessing my chances like that. And he has been watching Daniel as well, right? Did you watch Daniel as well? Yes, definitely. And not only on video, but also live.
Artur Makarov: The fight is similar, but Daniel started to fight with his upper body, which was amazing for me. It gives more interest to our fight. I think he will try to fight with his upper body.
Alex (Translator): Of course, I was watching him on video and in person as well. And we usually pulled very similarly. But lately, he seems to be changing stuff. And now he goes outside more and more, which I'm surprised about. But that makes the fight more interesting for me. I like it more. And Daniel, how about your opinion? What do you think about this match?
Alex (Translator): I would say I'm probably a bit of an underdog because Artur is the champion, but I still say 50-50 and I am just a bit heavier than him for now.
Engin Terzi: for now yes but you will go seven seven and then oh he said maybe i'll get bigger oh okay yeah yeah look at how friendly they are they are barely holding themselves to not to hug each other
Artur Makarov: It's only before the table. I really hope that we will show a good, serious, competitive fight. Everyone wants to win.
Engin Terzi: This is right now we're friendly, but of course on the table, all different. Fire breathing, fire. Show very competitive match. There is a super chat. Todd and Oleg's loud child says current promoter, future champion. And okay, so let's talk a bit more. What? Okay. A lot to talk, but I want to ask like,
Engin Terzi: What do you guys think, this circle, that Mindaugas beat Daniel, Daniel beat Alan, Alan beat Arthur, Arthur beat Mindaugas, this circle, what is their opinion about this subject?
Alex (Translator): What do you think about the fact that he fights Alon, and Alon fights you, and you fight Mindaugas? What's your opinion on this? Me? Let's ask both of you. Do you want to go first, Danya? Well, what can I say? There are comfortable opponents, and there are uncomfortable opponents. There are good days, and there are bad days. That's why it happened that in this round, when we won and when we lost,
Alex (Translator): I think so. But I think that all four of us are on the same level. What do you think, Artur? I think that the level is very similar.
Artur Makarov: I think it's just a matter of technique. Some people don't like this technique, some people find it uncomfortable, some people find it convenient. I think this approach plays more of a role. Convenience. And the technique is not suitable for the fight of a particular athlete.
Alex (Translator): No, I definitely agree. We're all extremely close. And I think the biggest deciding factor is just the style issue. Just one is very comfortable with the other. The other is very uncomfortable with the different one and the styles match up or don't at times. And that's all that makes a difference. Okay. And another thing that I will ask to Arthur. Arthur, until I and Arthur had a super match, Arthur was going hook, hook, hook.
Engin Terzi: And when we had a super match first time, and then when I took his hand, I thought I won, but then he pulled his left and then he was able to win that way. And after that time, we saw Artur doing this a lot against Alan Zolev and many people, he started doing this. But last two super matches against Mindaugas and Omer, he went inside.
Alex (Translator): so what's going on with that what's going on with uh like is he fully now going inside again is
Alex (Translator): And after that, you fought more and more against Alan, you did so against many, I noticed, because you are wide, you pull on yourself and so you take the center. And against Homero and Mindaugas, you again went completely into the hook and fought as if again so. What happens?
Artur Makarov: Before fighting with any athlete, I watch a lot of videos and see what kind of movements they do. And I think how I should go in this or that movement.
Artur Makarov: That's why I change my mind. In this case with Mindaugas, this trick wouldn't work for me. And it wouldn't work with Omer either. That's why I decided to twist them. The main task of Omer and Mindaugas is to twist Pronator. I think it's not a secret, everyone knows about it.
Artur Makarov: As soon as you twist the pronator, it becomes very difficult for them. The main task is this. Since they have a very good pronator and hold the corner well. If we take Engin, our fight, I could not twist the pronator at all. Therefore, my only decision at that moment was to hold it through the stretch of the widest shoulder blade.
Alex (Translator): I watch a lot of videos. I analyze my opponent as much as I can. I change my style according to who I pull. And with Mindaugas and Omer, it's not a secret that it's really important to control their pronator. Because they're very good at keeping the angle, keeping the pronator. And my goal was just to take it and get them inside. Against you...
Alex (Translator): I tried it but because I couldn't control your pronator I just decided to go all the way back and that was that was the lane that I felt because I couldn't control your pronator against you okay yeah yeah and Daniel we know you for many years inside and shoulder press right now you also built a very strong pronator and
Engin Terzi: When you pull against Mindaugas, you try to hook him. And later you told me that if you pull him again, you will try top roll this time. And is it easier for you to top roll a hook puller or a top roller?
Alex (Translator): We know that you have both a flop and a press. Everything inside is very strong, and lately you've been working on it more and more, even the top. And you said that even if you fought with Mindaugas again, you would try to beat him at the top. What do you feel now? Is it easier for you to beat a top-roller, who fights at the top, or a hooker? No, just when I will fight with Mindaugas, I will beat him
Alex (Translator): in his technique, so to speak. If I tried to twist him into the hook, would it be 50-50 again?
Daniel Procopciuc: No, now I think that my form is better thanks to him. Because I haven't lost to the right hand for a long time. When I lost to him, he was like a motivator for me. Now I don't know, but my form is much better than then.
Alex (Translator): You know, I got much better after that match thanks to him because it was a long time that I haven't lost on the right arm. And after I lost, I got a big motivation after him. I'm much better now. I can't say for sure what will happen, but I know for sure that I'm just better. Yeah, he now feels better. Yeah, the shape is much better. And is it any possible, Daniel, to tell us what is more possible way to beat Arthur or it's a secret?
Alex (Translator): Like the style? Yes. Is it a secret or not? Tell us, how do you think it's easier to beat Artur? The best line against him. How can I say? I don't know where Artur is, relax. But it will be a rare match.
Alex (Translator): I don't really know where are the weak points on Arthur, but it's going to be an interesting match. He doesn't know where the weak points on Arthur are, so it's going to be an interesting match. Okay, and what did Arthur say? He thinks that Daniel doesn't want to show off all his cards, how he wants to pull.
Artur Makarov: And do you want an answer? Do you want to show your cards? Devon't you want to show your cards? Daniel, Daniel. He's not talking. I think he has already developed a strategy on how to fight me, definitely. I think he has it in his head. I think he just doesn't want to talk about it.
Engin Terzi: I think his strategy is already done. It's in his head sitting and he's just trying really hard not to say anything, you know, and don't talk about it. So he wants to keep it to himself. Okay. Okay. Okay. That's interesting. Yeah. And let's see. Let's see. Let's see how it will be.
Alex (Translator): And yeah, did you guys watch Daniel? Did you have a surgery or something? Like I know you're a surgeon and you look very tired. Arsen you very tired? Yeah, I was working for five hours. He did surgery five hours?
Engin Terzi: no no three surgeries around two hours each wow three surgeries that's why he's so tired wow sorry sorry to keep you busy
Engin Terzi: Everything is fine. Another question to Daniel. Daniel, you are armwrestling and you are doing surgery. Is there any negative effects at all with your hand? You are armwrestling. I understand. It even helps, so to speak, because I work in rheumatology.
Alex (Translator): There are broken bones, because you need strength to straighten them. That's why armwrestling even helps me. Actually, it's the opposite. It helps me because you have to be really strong, you have to deal with bones, and it requires some strength, so armwrestling actually helps me. Okay, so he's saying that the stronger the doctor is, the better the surgery.
Engin Terzi: Did you guys see Yanis vs. Mindaugas match? Yeah.
Artur Makarov: Artur, did you see? Did you watch? Unfortunately, no. Unfortunately, no. I know the result. I know that Yanis won the first round quite easily.
Artur Makarov: Then the second round was very difficult, and due to the endurance of Mindaugas, Mindaugas won 3-2. But I didn't watch exactly this match, unfortunately, because now I'm very busy with work, I'm working on another job now, so probably a little bit because of that.
Alex (Translator): Unfortunately, I couldn't. I have work, a lot of work. I got a new job, but I know the result. I know around how much match went. I know that Yanis got around pretty easily, but then he got harder and harder and Mindaugas won on endurance. Arthur, it's now on YouTube if you want to watch. Today they made it public.
Daniel Procopciuc: Yes, there's a match on YouTube, if you want to watch it, it's already there. Okay, okay, I'll definitely watch it. And Daniel, what did you think about this match? Well, I don't think so. I think that Yannis is a real professor. He just didn't have the stamina to win, but he did everything right.
Engin Terzi: No, I think so and I know so that Yanis is a professor in armwrestling but his endurance just failed him but he was doing everything perfectly. I understand, I understand. And I plan to pull against Mindagas. Do you think at the age of 50 do I have chance against Mindagas again or it's over?
Alex (Translator): Arthur agreed. Daniel said that I don't really think Mindaugas is an opponent for you. Just because he will never win against you. You just know how to pull against him.
Engin Terzi: Oh, he doesn't know how to pull against me. No, you know how to pull against me. Oh, I know how to pull against you. He never is going to win against you, yeah. Oh, okay, okay. I understand. We will see, we will see. Maybe I'm too old. I don't know. We will see. Time will show. Oh, it's okay. What's this? It's okay, he said. It's okay. Is it okay? Okay. Yeah. It won't prevent Engin from beating Mindaugas.
Alex (Translator): It won't get in the way of you winning against Mandaugas. It's not going to affect anything. We all saw how Tazila beat Heraklis. And Tazila is 57 years old.
Engin Terzi: We saw how Tozzillo pulled against Irakli and he's 57. I wouldn't say the age. But Daniel, Tozzillo started armwrestling at the age of 35. He has 23 years as miles. Me, 35 years. And Tozzillo has very good genetics. I think his elbow genetics. My elbow, you know.
Engin Terzi: I have still good hand and wrist control, but we will see. We will see, yeah. Okay, one more guy. Do you guys, like, you said that you all are in the same level. Alan Zole, Minda Agas, Daniel, Arthur Makarov, yeah. But do you guys think there is a possibility that Oleg Cherkasov
Alex (Translator): being a huge danger for any of these guys. Do you think Oleg Cherkasov is a threat for all four of you? I think he is definitely on the same level as all of us.
Artur Makarov: Maybe even more. I think the thing is that, as I said before, if only the technique is suitable or not suitable for a certain athlete. Definitely, it's hard for him with Mindaugas. Ford example, it will be easy for him with me or Daniel. But I say figuratively. It will be hard with Alan. Alan, on the contrary. And here, in general, a mix.
Alex (Translator): Yeah, he's definitely on the around the same level as all of us, maybe in some places a bit higher. But still, I would say it's very depending on style. Let's say it's tough for him against Alan or against Mindaugas. But let's say it's easier for him against me or Daniel. But still, I would say it's very reliant on the style, just how he will feel. And does Arthur think that right now he's in his best shape?
Alex (Translator): Arsen you in your best form right now, Artur? I'm in a good form. I think I have a good form. But there is still a lot to work on. I feel like I'm in a good shape. I feel very good. But still, I would say there are parts that I could work on. Okay, let's talk about some other matches as well. What do you guys think, Daniel, about the main match, Michael Todd vs Vitaly Laletin?
Daniel Procopciuc: It's definitely an interesting match, but I think if Michael stops him, he's going to win. But stopping Vitaly is a big challenge. I don't know if it's going to happen.
Alex (Translator): And which one do you think is going to happen mostly, like most likely, like stopping the match? Does he think that Vitaly is going to flash him, it's more likely, or Michael is going to stop him? How does he feel? I think Vitaly has more chances.
Artur Makarov: And Artur? I also think that Vitaly has more chances to win, because, first of all, he is bigger, his levers are longer, and I think the main task for Vitaly will be to control his wrist, so that it is not broken. And so, I think, I would prefer to bet on Vitaly, I think it will be 60 to 40.
Alex (Translator): No, I agree. I think Vitaly has more chances. He is bigger, his frame is larger, his lever is longer. I would say that he has more chances. I would say 60-40. I would say all for Vitaly. Okay, I understand. And Ruslan Babayev, Tata Shintzplaniev? As I said before, there are comfortable and uncomfortable opponents.
Daniel Procopciuc: Always when we fought, Todd Hutchings and Rustam won against Rustam. But I think that now the form is better for Tadzila and he can stop Rustam. If he stops, of course he will win. You just need to stop this fight. I'm for the old people.
Alex (Translator): Like I said before, I think styles are very important. And it showed us that Rustam is generally, he was always winning against Tanzila. But I would say right now Tanzila is in very good shape. And if the match stops, he's going to probably win. But I want to say that I'm always rooting for the older guy.
Artur Makarov: I agree with Daniel. If Rustam is able to pull him to the pillow and not get stuck, then I think Rustam will win. First of all, it is clear that he is younger, but as far as I know, Rustam has not fought for a long time.
Artur Makarov: And no one knows what form Rustam will bring. We all know that Tadzila is gaining weight and gaining very well. He is in good shape. But I recently saw how Rustam trains and how he trains his biceps. And there are very solid weights and the vector of load is correct. I think it will be an interesting fight.
Alex (Translator): I think 50-50. It's very interesting because I'm pretty sure Rustam hasn't pulled in a while. So I'm not so sure about his shape. He did pull. He pulled Sandriss before he beat Pauline. But it wasn't like a very recent match. It was last December. He fought Sandriss in December. Ford months ago.
Alex (Translator): Yeah, I don't know. He won pretty easily against Santres.
Alex (Translator): He was talking about Rustam's training, how he was training his biceps. Pretty good weight and the most important, it's a very good lane of pressure. He was training it on a very good lane. Ford Tadzila, I would say that we see how he's progressing, he's getting better and better.
Alex (Translator): He would say 50-50, yeah. He would leave it 50-50. But if Rustam doesn't stop and just goes for a pin, he shouldn't. If it stops, it's big problems. Oh, if the match stops, the same as Daniel thinks that Toto has more chance, okay. Yes. Okay. And Daniel, Gennady Kvikvinia versus Ibrahim Sago. 115 kilo match.
Alex (Translator): Interim world title because... How much is Gennady right now? I think he already lost down to near 125 or something. I think. I'm not sure. 115, I understand. But if Gennady was in his weight, 130-125,
Daniel Procopciuc: I never saw Gennady at 115, so I was even surprised when Engin said that they would fight at 115.
Alex (Translator): But I will say 50-50 because I don't know how Gena will perform. If it was in Gennady's weight, for sure I would say 100% Gennady. But it's a lot of weight to cut. And I would say 50-50 just because it really depends on how Gennady is going to lose the weight and how the weight cut will go.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, he says he knows how to professionally lose the weight and gain back, you know. That's what he said, yeah. I just never saw Gennady 115. Oh, come on. Gennady many years competed 110 kilo. Yeah.
Alex (Translator): 20 years ago like 20 years ago yeah uh 10 years ago 10. 20 years ago you're not accompanied 90 kilos yeah
Artur Makarov: Because as far as I remember, I've never seen Gennady fight in any other weight category than in Absolutka. So I don't even have an idea how his weight loss will be with Ibrahim.
Artur Makarov: In the last two fights, he showed a competitive fight, but still lost. They were very strong opponents for Gennady. I think Gennady will try to beat Ibrahim with a triceps. Ibrahim, in turn, will try to cover him from above with his hand.
Artur Makarov: Here, probably, more triceps against the side. I also think that this is an interesting fight and I can't say to whom I would give preference. I think, too, 50 to 50.
Alex (Translator): As long as I remember myself, I always seen Gennady pulling an absolute weight category, the open weight class. So I'm not really sure. It's very dependent on how his weight cut will go and how it's going to affect him. I would say 50-50.
Alex (Translator): And it's going to be like a flop press against a side pressure of Zagov. Zagov's going to try to roll his shoulder in, get him with the wrist. Gennady will try to flop him. Gennady recently had two good matches. He lost them, but it was very strong opponents. I would say that it's 50-50. It's very depending on how his weight cut will go. Okay.
Daniel Procopciuc: Okay. Kamil Jablonski vs. Georgii Dzeranov. Left arm. Kamil Jablonski vs. Georgii Dzeranov. Kamil is very strong. And he is uncomfortable for many. Ford the top fighters. But Dzeranov is very fast. I think he won't be able to stop Dzeranov. But if he stops him,
Daniel Procopciuc: Then there is a chance, but I think it will not be able to stop.
Alex (Translator): Kamil is very strong and he's very fast. He's also very dangerous for top-rollers. I'm not so sure that he will be able to stop him. But if he does, then it's an interesting match. But still, I don't think he can. He doesn't think that... Does Aaron O'Kane stop him? You don't think that Duran will be able to stop Kamil?
Artur Makarov: I said that if Kamil manages to... The opposite, Kamil stops Serenov. Kamil is usually the faster one, so I think that Georgii needs to stop him, but I don't know, we'll see. And Arthur? I'll give my advantage to Georgii. I think it'll be easier for him to fight Kamil, because his levers are longer.
Artur Makarov: And it will be easier for him to fight. Kamil has one movement and everyone knows where he will hit. His very strong movement. But I think that Georgii will do his best to turn off this movement. Because he understands that he is very strong there.
Alex (Translator): I would choose Georgii as a favorite, there enough. His lever is longer than Kamil as well. I think he will be able to deny Kamil his technique because he'll get as technical as possible, get very fast in his position because he knows that if Kamil gets in his position, he's very, very strong there. And it's very hard to hold Kamil. So he will try his best just not to let him in. Okay.
Alex (Translator): Pauline versus David Samusha. 95 kilos. I don't think Pauline has chances this time. Oh, really? Wow. And you, Arthur? I think David Samusha will beat Pauline.
Alex (Translator): Taking into account how he fought with Sasha Andreev, David is definitely a favorite. Sasha had a weight of 85 kg, not 95.
Artur Makarov: Yes, but Sasha is Sasha and he is very strong and everyone knows that. I thought that in this fight Sasha would just be destroyed. And when I was surprised that David was able to win Sasha in the hook, I underestimated David.
Alex (Translator): Sasha is still Sasha when you even in lower weight classes when I saw the match I thought that Sasha was just gonna just gonna kill him but he he not only bit him he he won against him in a hook I greatly underestimated that I got very surprised mm-hmm okay okay so today I announced another match he won Matushenko or sister he can be
Daniel Procopciuc: It's very laggy, you can't see it. I wanted to ask Engin who... 85-95, I heard it. I heard it too. Yeah, I heard something like that.
Alex (Translator): Okay, I couldn't really hear what he said. Okay, maybe Arthur has first after Daniel comes back. He's back. Yeah. Yeah, okay.
Engin Terzi: Oh, he's asking, like, is David going to 95 now? He won't pull 85? No, no. I think for one match, 95, maybe he will come. I don't know. But for one match. Arsen you disappointed, Daniel? Did you want to pull him again? I know, I know. That's why I'm asking.
Alex (Translator): he looks he's a he did like this i think he's pretty disappointed yeah yeah okay and stargate kalichenko versus ivan matushenko uh it's 115 right 115 yeah yeah yeah yeah
Daniel Procopciuc: I know Serhii Kalnyshenko is your good friend, but let's see. I'll say it that way, it's going to be a very, very difficult match for Serhii. Very difficult.
Engin Terzi: Do you think Sergei cannot pull inside? Not with Matyushenko, no. I think Matyushenko hook-enability is very good, like 10 from 10. But inside, competing, maybe 9 from 10. Like, very good, still very good. But this is perfect. This is perfect. But inside, it's still very close perfect. But maybe, yeah.
Daniel Procopciuc: So you are saying that Matyushenko is a favourite, a little bit? Daniel? In the hook, yes, Matyushenko is a favourite. If Matyushenko doesn't let him get into the hook, then Sergey will win. I think in the hook, Ivan is a favourite. But if Sergey doesn't let him get into the hook, he won't lose. Okay. Artur?
Artur Makarov: I prefer Ivan Matyushenko. Of course, if they had fought with the left hand, I think Ivan Matyushenko would have been more of a favorite. But the right hand, of course, is not the main one for Ivan.
Artur Makarov: I'll give him a 55-45. It's going to be a tough match. I think the fight will be in the hooks. I don't remember Ivan getting his wrist untwisted.
Alex (Translator): No, Ivan's left is better. And if it was left, I would say for sure he's the favorite on right arm. It's not as good, but still, I would say he is 55-45 favorite. I'm pretty sure it's going to be in hook because I don't remember last time when Matyshenko's wrist got opened up. So I would say it's 55-45 for Matyshenko, but it's going to be a tough match. Yeah, yeah. I think if Serhii tries to top roll, it is...
Engin Terzi: more possible he wants to win, convincingly. But if Serhii goes for a drag hook, like bicep this way, I think it will be a very, very tough match. We will see. Time will show, yeah. I think if Serhii tries to go for a drag hook, there will be more chances that he will twist him. And if Serhii goes for a hook right away and tries to drag him to his biceps, there will be more chances to win.
Engin Terzi: I don't know. Anyway, so this is crazy one. Nugo Shikadze and Matt Mask. We plan to connect some electric cables on them and we are planning to
Alex (Translator): get energy enough to satisfy Istanbul's electric need for like a month, you know, with the electric that will be produced by this match, you know. Yes, we are going to take the cables now, connect them both and feed them, because during the match we will be able to provide Istanbul with energy for about a month. Yes. What can I say? Just so they don't fight there.
Engin Terzi: I just hope they won't fight. It's just that crazy. But I think Nugo will win. I think Nugo is going to win. Wow. But did you see the match between Matt Mask and Ongar Bayev? Surprise or no? No. No surprise? Wow. And you think Nugo is going to beat Matt? I haven't seen it in a long time.
Daniel Procopciuc: to participate in Kader Gali. I don't know if he trained. He was probably preparing for this match. He had an injury. Yes, he hadn't participated in it for a long time. And this is a problem, because you already forget how to fight, so to speak. And this Matt Mask is a very good opponent for Kader Gali, because he has very long levers and attacks right where needed.
Alex (Translator): No, I was really surprised because it was a while since Katergaly pulled the injury, everything. And, you know, you just, after that long, you slowly, you forget how to pull. You are not as good. And Matt is a very good opponent for him. Very long hand, very good long levers, good top roll. But he's in the same place with Nugo. Long arm, Nugo short arm. When he will fight Nugo, Matt's mask will be like this.
Alex (Translator): so long that matt mask's angle is going to open up like this he'll be like this and arthur um
Artur Makarov: Matt Mask will be comfortable for Chikadze. Chikadze, in turn, will be as uncomfortable as possible for Matt, because he really has very large and long levers. If we take physical training, I think that Nuga
Artur Makarov: stronger than him, but due to the fact that he has long arms and it will be uncomfortable for him, I think that the favorite, not the favorite, I will be sick for Nuga, but I think that Matt Mask will win.
Alex (Translator): know matt he's so long he's going to be very comfortable with nugo and nugo is going to be very uncomfortable with matt i would say that nugo is stronger than him physically but the lever difference is so huge that it's going to matter i would i will root for nugo i want him to win but i would say that matt is the favorite okay so danielle thinks that matt long arm
Daniel Procopciuc: Nugo short arm advantage for Nugo. And Arthur saying that Matt has long arm. Nugo short arm advantage for Matt. Because I fought Nugo. Nugo has a very small hand. But a very strong wrist. And Matt Mask won't be able to open his wrist. And there will be just one hit to the side. One hit to the side.
Alex (Translator): Because I pull with Nugo. I know he has a very small hand and a very strong wrist. Matt will not be able to get it. And it's just going to be from Nugo side pressure. Interesting, yeah. And then the last match. Last match I want to ask. Daniel, did you watch the match between Jocelyn and Sarah? Yes, I watched.
Alex (Translator): You said it as if you were very disappointed. Of course I was disappointed. I wanted Sarah to win. It was obvious from your face. Yes, I was very disappointed. Very disappointed. You wanted Sarah to win? Yeah.
Engin Terzi: Yeah. And what does Arthur say? Yeah, he said that you looked very disappointed when you said that you watched that match. Okay, so we know Daniel is a Sarah Beckman fan. Yes, you are a fan of Sarah Beckman. We now know. Yes. Okay. And okay, so now Jocelyn is pulling Egle, Daniel. Oh, wow. Egle, what good?
Daniel Procopciuc: Yes, I know Elin. But what can I say? I didn't know this athlete before, but after the match with Sarah, I think she will win now too. I want to see her against... Barbora? Yes. Sarah? Favorite for you? Or Elin? Not Elin.
Alex (Translator): You just said Sara and I got confused.
Alex (Translator): Not Sarah. Jocelyn. Jocelyn? Yeah, Jocelyn. Yeah, yeah. I thought of Sarah for some reason. Yeah, he's a Jocelyn, yeah. Okay, okay. So who's winning now? Jocelyn, yeah. Oh, so he wants to see Jocelyn against... Jocelyn will beat Egle? He wants to see her against Barbora, yeah. Wow, that is interesting. And Arthur? I think that if Egle is in good shape, I think Egle...
Engin Terzi: Yeah, I think if Egle gets in a very good shape, she's going to win. Okay. And let's talk about two more things. Ermes versus Levan, June, in America. Daniel, what's going on? Levan will never lose? What can I say?
Daniel Procopciuc: I don't know in what form he was at the first match in Lebanon. If he was at his peak form, then now Ermes has more chances than then. But if he didn't take Ermes seriously, then I think that now there will be no chance for Ermes at all.
Alex (Translator): You know, it depends on how good Levan was in the first match. If that first match they had was Levan's best shape, I would say Ermes has more chances now than he had in the first match. But if the first match was Levan didn't take him seriously and he wasn't in such a good shape, there's no way Ermes has any chances now. And Arthur? I wanted to ask, how is Levan's hand? Irakli said that...
Alex (Translator): That's it, tip-top on the last stream, he said that all the shards that were now worked. That is, he has no problems with the brush.
Alex (Translator): Yeah, so he's asking if Levan doesn't have issues with the wrist anymore and I said no. Irakli said on the previous stream as well that everything's good now. Yeah, yeah. You're telling me? I think you need to tell him what Irakli said in English. Yeah, I told him as well, yeah. Irakli also said on the stream that they worked on everything with Levan and there's nothing else.
Artur Makarov: I think that Levan will dominate, that's for sure. And Ermes will be in his defensive position. If Ermes can hold Levan, because there are a lot of muscles and a lot of strength, it's clear. If Ermes can hold him, then he will drag him.
Artur Makarov: But if he doesn't have enough batteries, Levan will win for sure.
Alex (Translator): No, I think Levan is going to be very dominant, very offensive. Ermes is going to pull on the defensive side. And if he's able to stop him and get a stop on the match, then he will be able to drag him, drag him back. But Levan has a lot of muscle. There's a lot of power. We know that. And it's very hard. And if Ermes' gas tank runs out too fast, he's not going to be able to hold him.
Engin Terzi: He says if Ermes' gas tank, or he says that, not if, he said Ermes' gas tank goes down quick. If the gas tank goes down. Okay, okay, I understand, yeah. Anyways, guys, thank you very, very much. Daniel, you had three surgeries in five, six hours, and sorry, and I hope you get good rest. Do you have any last words to Arthur? Do you have any last words, Arthur?
Alex (Translator): Well, let him be in his best shape so we can show a good match. Let Arthur be in the best shape so we show everyone a best possible match. Daniel, my best shape was in 2017. He told him my best shape was in 2017. I couldn't do anything then. I couldn't do anything to you.
Alex (Translator): Arthur said his best shape was what? In 2017. No, it wasn't his best shape, no. No, no, no, no. Arthur, I'm coming for you too. I'm coming for you too after Mindaugas. You know that, right? You know that, right?
Alex (Translator): Yes, yes, I know. And we will have the same friendly communication as with Daniel, because we will not be able to poison each other. You know, I know that you're coming and I know when we will have a podcast like this, just like with Daniel, we'll sit and we'll talk very friendly, because we will not be able to fight each other, you know.
Engin Terzi: no yeah that's true that's true it's impossible impossible to be disrespectful with these guys you know it's impossible if it was mean diverse it's a different case these guys full respect anyways guys thank you thank you very much arthur thank you very much daniel and alex thank you for the translation my friend as always
