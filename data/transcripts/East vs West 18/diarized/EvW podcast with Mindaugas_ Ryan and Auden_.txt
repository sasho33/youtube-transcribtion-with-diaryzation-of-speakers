Mindaugas: we are live already because you guys came early so let's start early so perfect okay how is everything going hello hello ryan good to see you and arden how are you i'm very good i'm very very good that's good that's good do you know who is gonna join us as the third person
Mindaugas: I asked Ermes. Ermes said he's going to go out and eat. And then I asked Ivan Matushenko. He said he would love to, but he can't. Third person I asked was Mindagos and he accepted about 20 minutes ago. Nice. Yeah. So let's see. Let me share this link and then we start. And...
Auden: so alan how is everything how are trainings going everything is going incredible for me really really good i just got finished the three day fast actually so i'm cutting down a little bit trying to get in slightly better shape and uh yeah everything's going what are you now i'm like just under 105 kilo just under say again sorry just under 105 kilo like 104 oh so you are about 208 or something or
Mindaugas: yeah yeah uh so over there you you are more familiar with the pounds or kilogram or you say kilo because to for me to understand i i'm very familiar with both just because arm wrestling runs on kilo but we use pounds mostly yeah okay we're the same way gordon exactly i'm 104. i thought you were 86 kilo
Mindaugas: yeah yeah i did i was waiting for that one okay okay let's just discuss about our nothing yeah um okay so i think mindaga soon will join and then we can we can talk um did you guys see the replacements did you see four replacements
Mindaugas: Oh, Jerry, because of some personal things, stuff, he won't be able to pull. And we had a few options. One was just tell Artem, hey, come as a special guest or stay at home. Stay at home was the
Mindaugas: like almost not in the any consideration because we got visa for him and it was one entry visa and if he didn't use the visa like when he goes next time they would say like you got the visa you didn't even you go there you know why i mean why do you even ask visa so what happened is that we talked with uh you know that many people you know at their level there are not so many armistice to pull against
Mindaugas: And many of them cannot get Vita. Georgii Svetkov already pulled him. And they could pull a revenge match. But Georgii, I think he's going to have surgery with left arm. Yeah. Or his bicep. And then Michael Todd is pulling Di Dzeranov. Dave Chaffee is down to 115. Your father is pulling left arm. And right arm is going to pull Vitaly.
Mindaugas: And so there were not many options. So we said with Alex Kurdecha, with right hand. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Mindaugas: Alex wants to pull your father. He says that is the main target. It's more important. I think I need to pull a few matches in between. He said that he wants to... I understand. It is more important for Alex to pull your father.
Mindaugas: His left looks more competitive even though he had some defeats recently.
Mindaugas: I think one only, that again, the other one was recent, almost one and a half year ago against Morozov. It was a close match, yeah. And how do you see, okay, we don't need to wait for Minda Aguas to talk about the matches. Whenever he joins, he joins. Okay.
Mindaugas: What do you think since we talked about that? What do you think about this match? Left arm, Kurdecha, your father. How do you see? I follow your predictions are logical. I agree. Majority of them. But how do you see this match?
Auden: You know, it's a very interesting match to me because I'm a huge fan of Oscar. I think he's great. I think he has done awesome things in the sport and he's just so big. He's very intimidating. It looks, it looks very impressive when he pulls, but the one thing that throws me off about this match is I know my dad's level all the time. I know it all the time. I pulled him probably more than anyone else in the world. So I always kind of know where he's at. And last time Alex came up and pulled my dad. Yes. Well, it's stable.
Auden: Alex came to, like, be strong and kind of bully him around a bit. This was right after Devon 2. And let me tell you, I was beating my dad at that point. Like, he was... What you are saying that Devon focused Devon and then as soon as the competition ended, physically, mentally, spiritually, he was down, you know? Yeah, totally. Went and lived at his mom's house for like a month, just like farming and eating like stew all day.
Auden: and got around like 230 pounds and then pulled credential and was still beating him left on the practice table uh-huh practice didn't really mean anything well no no it didn't but alex at that point was pretty good still he was prepping for a match and my dad was like the worst for me he could ever be so now when they're both prepping for a match and he's now like 70 pounds heavier than when they last pulled
Auden: I got a feeling it's going to be, it's going to be a decisive victory. So he will be like, he will control right from the beginning to the end. From the beginning. I think round one will be very interesting. Alex has a bunch of options. He can come forward and flop if he needs to. But I just, I think.
Mindaugas: Right now, I don't know if people understand how good my dad is. He is- Can I ask you something? I don't know the backstory. What happened? How come your father lost in the ... What was it? Where was it? In Virginia? How did that happen? There must be something, but I don't know the story. The reason I'm asking, because I want to know from you. I want to hear. Yeah. Yeah. I'll explain it. The guy who beat him, Logan Benninger, he is really good. He is a really good arm wrestler.
Auden: i mean normally he would he would not win he's not quite that high yet but how it went is my dad wanted to wanted to go all the way up a side until he got to the last guy on a side then dropped to him so he got all the way up a side got to logan and dropped and cleaned the b side and came back but his intention was to just kind of catch him low and play around oh okay so you are saying that if there was one more ready go that wouldn't happen
Mindaugas: No, no, no. If he was really trying to. Okay. Because I thought that, you know, maybe when he arrived there, he pulled some practice matches or something. And I thought that there was the reason. So you are saying that he was fresh, but he just underestimated him. Well, he did pull a lot. He did do a lot, a lot of after pools, a lot of before, before the event, he was, oh, no, no, he was going to say that's what I'm saying. Yeah. No. Yeah. There was pools all the way through the day. He was always in the table.
Mindaugas: but it was really he just surprised him he got the win on him but he was just my dad was going to try to play and he tried to play a little bit too much okay okay okay so this is this this is the backstory which i didn't know like i was curious about and and ryan how do you see this match like he's gonna destroy him i mean but he said he's gonna like win you know like without any doubts i think devin from what i can
Ryan Bowen: observed and experienced is one of the one of the guys who feels one of the maybe the most drastic difference between practice pulling or let's say casual tournament pulling and when it matters uh devin losing the other day on the left you could see i think it was a bit of a sneaky elbow fail drag off the back as well like i know when i've fooled with devin i he'll be he feels like an elastic band to me i know he could stonewall me at center if he wanted to but he's always
Ryan Bowen: He's always giving people that room. I remember Devon once shared with me to win as gloriously as you can. And I think Devon loves to do that, make it theatrical and caught napping and then left out of the way. So I even think that's the same with Kurdecha. Like when Devon steps up to Kurdecha, it's a very different,
Ryan Bowen: It's a very different experience compared to what Kadesha had when they did the practice pool. So of all people, Devon is the person in the world who most, I feel, changes when you get him in a genuine ready to go compared to anyone else in the world. Everyone else kind of shows you their cards. Devon is very different. I'd love to someday just say to Devon in training,
Ryan Bowen: show me what it's like when you actually care about santa like i'm sure it's horrible it is it is terrible when he gets close to matches he does that because normally in practice he says whatever but when he gets close and he's like okay i'm going to be a little bit mean now then you know you're in front of your wrist buckle so when i look at this match credential endeavor i like to look at matches from the from the biomechanical sort of standpoint and cadet is in fact
Ryan Bowen: I think the biggest arm wrestler in the world. He's not the tallest, but when you consider the size of his frame, the width of his shoulders, the depth of his chest, he's an enormous, enormous guy. And he certainly has a big wrist and a big hand as well. So lever length, I believe, I would assume is right there with Devon. Very similar length lever. So it's going to be a very hard first round where
Ryan Bowen: hand control pronation static coronation is going to be really uh instrumental on who gets to win Center um I I I think that it's always fascinating because I always think of Devon's right arm and the way he developed that with the the giant pumpkin Theory for so long and in his left arm as he was his party arm for so long but it seems like it's not that far behind his right
Mindaugas: Right, whenever Levan and Devon were going to pull in Istanbul, we had an outside interview with them. You know, they were sitting by a bench, you know, on a table. And when Devon was doing this, somehow his left bicep looked, to me at least, like, hello, Minda, hello, the God. Hello, guys, I'm a little late. Sorry about that. No, no, you are not late. We started a little bit. Oh, yeah, you are four minutes late, yeah.
Mindaugas: We will have to cut some of your next, you know. Anyways, can you hear me well? Yeah, do you hear us? I can hear you as well. Okay, okay. Let me hear some of Odin. How's it going, Minagis? How's it going? Yeah, yeah. You stay with me, you're scary. Anyways, so Odin knows. Ryan doesn't know yet, but Odin knows. Okay.
Mindaugas: I don't know. So this is what I was saying, that in April 2024, when they were going to pull, somehow compared to before, his left arm started to look big to me. I don't exactly know what the reason was. He already started training or not. I can explain. I can explain. So why his left arm looks bigger? It's because his bicep isn't torn. It's the full bicep. So if you look at it,
Auden: Oh, it looks much, much healthier, much more full at that point. He wasn't training his left, but after LaVon, after he pulled that match, he's been trying it. I've seen in the past that Devon's right arm is longer. Like my right arm is longer. Is that still the case? Or is the left arm back still the case? And it's actually even, even scarier than just the arm length. His hand on his right has changed anatomy. It's like even more built for arm wrestling. Now the thumb is thicker.
Ryan Bowen: Like everything is just bigger. It's way bigger. So also summarizing my sort of position on this match, I think it's going to be a very hard fought, uh, balance center at the top of the table at first, I kind of read Devon to have more, more, more stiff and rigid pronation than Alex. If I'm going to give Alex the nod in anything, I think that he might have more bicep strength and maybe some more muscular strength in that rise at the center. But I expect Alex's risk to go.
Ryan Bowen: I expect him to commit shoulder pretty early, and he might sneak a couple of flop press pins in. But if he loses his wrist and doesn't win center, I think it's going to be a real bad day for him. But I see Devon as the favorite, but Alex certainly with some knockout punches there if he gets them in. Okay, so the key with...
Mindaugas: having chance to beat Devon also includes to have that the floor press and
Mindaugas: After I saw Morozov versus Alex Kurdeyshev left hand, I saw that Alex has that. But to make it effective, you really need to bring Devon at least halfway to your winning side. Then the one round at the beginning, Corey was able to do that.
Mindaugas: And so he has to bring him to depth here, and then there is a risk, you know, for Devon. But anything at the center, if the match stops or a little bit this way even, like if it is not like shoulder pressure position, then it will be very, very hard. It will be very, very hard. And Minda, how do you see this match?
Mindaugas: Yeah, last video of Alex, which I saw was on Raymond's Coach Ray channel. And Alex was really breathing heavily. So I'm assuming that he's getting big and strong these days, which might help him. But again, that one is just a bit special. Those jointy. Listen, but they both breathe heavy. So not only Alex.
Mindaugas: So Devon will be very, very strong on that day. And yeah, on top of that, Devon has some, I think he has more joint strength, more tendon strength. You know, Devon for a long time, he kept saying that he doesn't train his left. But, you know, if you keep practicing on the table every week for years, I don't think you can call it not training your left. So I think Devon is in a good shape. And I have to give an advantage to Devon, yeah.
Mindaugas: okay okay so how how big like uh 99 percent how much 99 percent oh good choice Tyler Brooks Armesting says that can't wait for Chicago see you guys up there thank you Skyler thank you my friend um what did our guys think what is the percentage Ryan what are you saying
Mindaugas: Ford me, I'm like a 70% Devon. I'm not 99. I'm 99. Neil Pickup is in the chat. He says, the goat is in the house. Who is that guy? Who is that guy? Come on, you are too humble. You are too humble. Must be others. Take me, yeah.
Mindaugas: You can have it. Yeah, you are too humble. Yeah. We have to remember, but it's still a joke, right? Listen, when you repeat something too many times, it becomes like, you know, was it joke or real? Or like, at least you look like a second goat after John Brzezinski, you know?
Mindaugas: You know, you look that way, you know, to me. Yeah, that's pretty good. Yeah, I'm thinking that way. Then I remember our match and I'm like, oh, no, you know, it's okay. So mean that.
Mindaugas: Let's talk about you a little bit since you are our guest. How is everything going? You said that you had some cold or illness or something. It's in the past. I told myself that I'll never get sick again. Today in the morning I was just showering and I was looking at my biceps and I felt strong somehow. You don't understand.
Mindaugas: Yeah, you owe your power, your everything to your bicep, right? That's your strongest point. Yeah, that's the main weapon. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Every time I see that, I get scared. Okay, let's talk about... I'm very curious about your house, about Artur Makaro versus Daniel Prokofievic. Yeah, after that second round when Daniel pinned him. You said it was over.
Mindaugas: i thought that daniel will really take it and yeah the first round when daniel was trying the top roll i also knew that it wouldn't really work that's not
Mindaugas: But, yeah, Daniel, it's a pity. I think he could really win it. Can I interrupt you? When they say after the second round, maybe you watch my video or not, Fristo told me, oh, Engin, Daniel has incredible endurance. I said, yes, but I said, listen, there are different types of endurance.
Mindaugas: Arthur Makaro, within the match, he sometimes gets tired. But between the rounds, when he goes to corner, you recover this much, he recovers this much. Do you remember in Antalya, you beat him in final, and then he just come back and beat you in the second place? And even during my match with him last year with Makaro, I kind of also felt like the whole time I felt like he's going to get tired. Round one, round one, you were here. You were here and he fouled intentionally. And that
Mindaugas: Strap out, you guys went to the corner, 30 seconds later you come, he beat you, and then he beat you for a total of four times. Even in the next rounds, yeah, he beat me, but then I thought, okay, I still, you know, stopped him for a few seconds, and I thought that alone should somehow make him tired. But no, not really. Like, his endurance was impressive. Just beat him as quick as possible. He recovers very quick, you know. What did you think about that match, Adam? I had similar thoughts. I thought after round two it was going to start turning around.
Auden: But yeah, macro office, he's such a freak. That guy is such a freak. He always impresses me. Every time I thought, I thought you were going to get them in Dallas. I thought Daniel was going to get them. And every time he surprises me, it really changed in that match when, when Daniel.
Ryan Bowen: got the riser out the first round he didn't he didn't pull with a riser and then he was going outside yeah then as soon as the riser came out yeah it looked like a different daniel but but credit to macro like you said again having the ability to refresh between rounds is a unique strategy uh that you it comes with a unique strategy and he he held he held in uh
Ryan Bowen: in an offensive position with Daniel millimeters above the pad for a long time without his pronation being rolled back over. So that was, it was very, very impressive and deserved win on the day, but yeah.
Mindaugas: good stuff really I could really not understand why did Daniel start kind of dragging a little bit going backwards like after getting that nice stop in the center because I think in the last four rounds he was really like the initiation was fine he was in the front at the on the edge of the bed and Macaro I know like he somehow struggles if you you know he's good on his side but if you hold him in the center he's kind of
Mindaugas: he doesn't feel that comfortable so I didn't understand why did Daniel start going backwards maybe just the power was overwhelming but um it's almost I think that he just stayed inside he may he might be able to survive I I think I think he was trying to go inside but
Mindaugas: I think Arthur, unlike the deep hook match, later rounds, he started using more like dragging and then just he was opening, you know, I think he was not really opening, but like whenever you have the pressure here, even you don't like how to say it is the farthest place, you know, farthest place. If Arthur was putting pressure,
Mindaugas: on on daniel's bicep my opinion he would have won but but he what he did was dragging and you know when arthur curves his wrists bends his wrist his hand gets here even like bigger the same like like or like stroke and in hook and especially if he's just dragging you like this with the
Mindaugas: pronator and the brachioradialis like this, I think there is so much pressure coming to your hands. Did you feel anything? Go ahead. Sorry. I was just going to... Okay, you go. No, no, no. You go. Okay, so I was just saying that, you know, because of that, Makaro's ability to really also pull back and...
Mindaugas: He really has a lot of back pressure. Because of that, it's a good idea to stay in front because you can avoid some of that pressure backwards. No, I understand. I understand. But then probably he was opening his bicep. When you come forward, you can do like this, but then your bicep, so you just try to protect. Do you realize that the last round you finished like this?
Mindaugas: So, I mean, I think he was not recovering as fast as Arthur. That's the only thing I understand. But for sure, I know Arthur between the rounds recovers really quick. Something is with him. I don't know what it is, but probably genetic is like that way, yeah.
Mindaugas: Um, yeah, anyway, so. Yeah, we should probably not say genetics because of course the guy's working a lot and training hard for many years, but, uh, but yeah. But some people have really like, no matter how hard you do, like, like some people will always have better marathon than you do. Like those people are the people who are genetically gifted for marathon. Some are for the, uh, everyone can switch. You can make your explosiveness more or endurance more, but some people.
Mindaugas: no matter how hard you you train you will not have that endurance or you will not have that explosiveness some things are really special with uh certain people like like adan's father had incredible endurance you know like incredible energy he could just pull forever i think one time neil pick up said in i think in 2007 in arm wars just he pulled everyone like hours and hours and it was just like that you can't really
Auden: it was genetics then Odin would also have the same ability listen he doesn't have to have the like the same identical genetic order the father you know well the interesting thing with the genetics about him is we have actually gotten our genetics tested and we can see all the mutations and while there is while there is some it's nothing exceptional I think the reason he can do it is because of how hard he's trained and he's trained more than almost anyone on the planet and
Auden: You know, an interesting thing here, if you look at my brother and I, we're very similar. I have trained for arm wrestling. He has not. I can pull for 12 hours every day over and over and over again and be okay. He cannot do that. And that's because of the time I put in. I think with my dad, it's just that leveled up to 30 years training every day. I think you make adaptations when you go that long. And I'm sure there is genetic components, but I would be very hesitant to blame it all on that.
Ryan Bowen: I've always thought that Devon in particular and any arm wrestler, what is often seen as endurance, and I'm not denying the existence of endurance, but what is seen as endurance is often just really efficient positional play combined with strength in that hard counter. Whatever that little hard counter is, pronation, rise, whatever. Strength there, win a moment, and then be a master of relaxing again once you've won that.
Ryan Bowen: in good positional play and Devon does that really really well yeah um but like how if Devon if you measured Devon's the how much time he could just contract at Max effort it might not be that huge huge amount of time like any human's going to gas out at around 10 seconds of Max effort but right Ryan this is what I try to say also I want to tell you Arsen
Mindaugas: when you have good genetics it doesn't mean that you don't have to train it means that when you train your capacity is higher than other people do you understand no matter how hard you train it somebody may have a better better uh better i don't know how to say like capacity than you do you know like no matter how how hard like for me i never ever ever ever ever train speed never but but like i don't even do any ready go training
Mindaugas: at the training, not at all. But whenever I go to the World Championship or something, I still move quick. Do you understand? But some people, no matter how hard they try, they just can't be quick. They train speed, they are still slow. Of course, there is a lot of other factors. But anyway, so let's go to the Chicago card. Today, we announced a match, Arsen Kacetarian.
Mindaugas: And I'm sure that you all are very familiar with this guy. And he did very well at the AMC event. And I think he took second place to Sasho in 2022, probably Europeans or something. Anyway, so how do you guys see this match? Paul versus Arsen Kacetarian. Let's start with you, Mindaugas.
Mindaugas: you saw him right you saw him in arlington he pulled against andrei sharkovich yeah right and um i also remember his match with my good friend bogdan stoika where bogdan did pretty well against him but yeah arson did like he did okay versus um under sharkovich um i'm trying to think about his style a bit
Mindaugas: Because Paul, you know, Paul did so well this last event. I can see that, you know, beating Samusha at this stage, at this point, when he's really ready, is crazy, you know. It's...
Mindaugas: I think Samush should stick to 85 kilos. With 89 kilos body weight, you shouldn't pull 95. It's not an excuse. You shouldn't take the match. But seriously, if you are pulling at this level, you really need to, you know, reach that thing, you know. And okay, how do you see this match? Yeah, so normally, I guess, yes, you know, it's fair enough to say that Samush should stick to 85. But also, I know that Samush is punching way above his weight class.
Mindaugas: So I can really understand how strong is Paul now. I'm going to say that Paul must be winning this one because his shape, he really just surprised me so much. I didn't expect it at all. You didn't expect, I expected for sure. I didn't say I expected Paul to win. Samushka before East versus West was European, World and Zloty champion.
Mindaugas: Samusha was right there already. Of course, he gained some weight and he progressed. But Paul, in my opinion, was still new to the sport when the East vs West event was going on. We didn't even think that he was... I mean, that is why he was 100 kilos and Samusha was 87 kilos when I said this match. Do you understand? Because I thought that then it was a close match. 3-2.
Mindaugas: Since then, his performance against Rustam and Sasho and the guys that he beat, you know, it just shows that he progressed a lot. He progressed for sure more than David Samusha in the last three years, yeah. But you know also that progress is not something given, you know.
Mindaugas: Sometimes you are new and then five years are passing by, so you would expect a person to get stronger, but they don't always. No, no, no. In Paul's case, when you look at Paul's matches, just remember you were there when Paul pulled Rustam Bavaev in Orlando. Yes, Rustam won, but you're giving that match to Rustam, so it's not a surprise that you beat him.
Mindaugas: I mean, yes, Samusha in 85 kilos, incredible. But even then, Samusha didn't always win easily. He beat Sasho, you know, Aydar Khan, some of other matches were close.
Mindaugas: So Rustam, 95 kilo, is for sure better than Samusha at 85 kilo. And also Rustam at the time, I didn't know how good he was. He was the revenge match. He was the revenge match and he was coming, you know, he was coming. He won and then he beat Sandris convincingly some months later. After Rustam beat Sandris, then I really saw, okay, that's the Rustam we have seen in the past.
Mindaugas: But before that, I wasn't sure. I didn't know. He might have... Listen, listen. Before the Paul Elin match, he lost to Irakli. It was 3-2. Irakli was the champion. So Rustam never was away. Of course, Rustam maybe wasn't 100%, but he was at least 90%, you understand? So Rustam at 95 kilos is stronger than Samusha, 85 kilos. So you are saying that Paul was very impressive and he's going to be...
Mindaugas: Arsen Kacetarian, yeah. That's my guess, yeah. And what did you think about Arsen? Arsen can also pull in very different ways, you know. The guy is very strong. Were you surprised when he beat Andrei Sharkovich or not? I was surprised in the way he beat him because at first...
Mindaugas: Andre did so well. I think at first he got the control. And then somehow I almost thought that, okay, it's over because Arsen even opened up fully in the Kings move. Do you remember? So I thought, okay, Arsen must be the winner. But then, so somehow, no, Andre must be the winner, but then Arsen recovered. So I was surprised by that recovery, really surprised. Am I correct in remembering that Arsen ended up forcing the hook? Is that how that match went?
Ryan Bowen: Was that the line that worked for him against Andre? In my memory, it was a bit messy. It was not a clear hook. Maybe a side pressure move, but... I've pulled Andre. So when I was watching that match, I was thinking, man, Andre, he impressed me when I pulled him. I had him as the slight favorite in my eyes going to that. Arsen's not someone I've seen a huge amount of. I haven't watched the AMC stuff. I've heard of his...
Ryan Bowen: his, his victories over there. But I thought he handled Andre really well, ultimately in the end, his ability to adjust and his ability to, to, to end up looking dominant by the end of the match when you're losing first was, was impressive. But when I think of Paul Linn, Paul Linn is, uh, when we talk about genetics, we, we, I think Paul's one of those guys with a hugely explosive start combined with a great static rigidity and he protects,
Ryan Bowen: He leaves you with no good options. When you grip Paul or when he loads all that pronation up at center, I can just see how arm wrestlers are panicked on. Do they try to go inside or outside and pass that wrist? It's a horrible thing. He's got both covered so well in a static sense. And I think that we're probably going to see Arsen unsure of which way to go, whether it's in or out. I think he'll try probably both, but
Mindaugas: I'm seeing flash Prince Paul with the form that he's in. Yeah, he needs to, he needs to, Arsen needs to for sure put a break, like very near to the center, you know, and that's not an easy thing to do it, you know. And pullers like Sancho, Rustam, they all, and Rustam is one of the most explosive pullers. Even he ended up, you know, in a losing position in Orlando. And Arvind, how do you see this match?
Auden: I see complete domination from Poland. I think there is no way there is anything other than total control from start to finish. Everything lines up perfect for him. He's in incredible shape right now. I think his form is probably the best he's ever been. And he's in America. It's going to be crazy. He's our golden boy. So the crowd is going to be electric. We're all going to be cheering for him. It's going to be lining up for him to just one, two, three.
Mindaugas: I think it'll be good, it'll be a good fight, but I think Paul is good, really. Tario says that, I train now, what is the best for short arms technique? God is here. Even though he has long arms, but for his weight. Take a look at Nugo Chikadze, if you want to. I think Nugo Chikadze is my new favorite arm wrestler, after what he did with Matt Mask.
Ryan Bowen: He's an example of how to short arm arm wrestle was perfect. He put it on a demonstration of how to top roll. He put on a demonstration of how to set an explosive hook. Knuckles up, strength, get your forearm vertical, take control of that, the fact that you can get your knuckles high. And then if your opponent over commits with depth, then slam sideways and supinate and press. And if they try to dump and run, stay high and top roll and keep that pronation of your opponent down. Nugo Chikadze is your best example.
Mindaugas: But you see, these shorter arms are still normally struggling with the top roll technique, right? It's normally a little bit not the most efficient way to pull. So short arms are your thing that is not good for top roll? We have exceptions like Nugo, but I would say that generally, normally, I would recommend some kind of inside move. Yeah. Minda, if you are going to seriously answer, can I ask you something?
Mindaugas: Yeah. Like, do you consider my hand arm, you know, like shorts or normal or normal, normal, normal. Yeah. Okay. Okay. I mean, for when I was competing in lighter weight categories, they were long. Whenever I come to the, you know, like.
Mindaugas: 75 and over like 75 is still okay whenever it's 85 kilos it's not it's kind of short yeah oh you're short yeah so yeah it depends on the weight class yeah i think you have you have long liver right no this is how i think i don't know yeah maybe but again i'm just kind of skinny so automatically the frame becomes bigger for my weight class and that's why i'm long but if i come 180
Mindaugas: Even less than that, 179, 178 something like that. Okay, yeah. But yeah, if I compare myself to someone my height, I'm not sure if my arm is really that long. Okay, and I will ask you a question and that is like one million dollar question. One million dollar question. And I will say in a foul language.
Mindaugas: Who is the fucking guy in 77 kilo? Of course now is Arthur Makaro, but like everyone is beating, like, do you think that Arthur now is an...
Mindaugas: maybe in a different level than the time that he had those matches against like Alan Zolev and other guys? Or do you think they have his number? That's why they are. Do you think that if now Chad Kasso would come, do you think that you would beat him again? Or do you think it looks different right now? Or just say honestly.
Mindaugas: My really honest opinion, I think if Daniel, Cherkasov, or what is it, Zolojev, Alan Zolojev. So Daniel, Cherkasov, and Alan Zolojev, all three of these guys, I think the next time they fight Makaru, they beat him. Because... Okay, who's beating Makaru next time?
Mindaugas: Allen three of them. Wow. I'm sure he still has his number. Zolaev will beat him, Cerkasov will beat him, and Daniel will beat him, you say? Yes. Come on, man. Listen, listen, listen. If you say Cerkasov and Zolaev, because they have beaten him, okay, last time.
Mindaugas: and i i would say like okay you know but whenever the guy just beat daniel like how many weeks ago like two weeks ago two weeks ago then whenever you said next time it's gonna be that don't you think is a bit disrespect to arthur mcconnell hey i know it sounds like that but it's really not like that i'm just kind of judging based on the techniques mostly
Mindaugas: Because I know that Alan Zaloyev, he really fights Makarov correctly. You need to have that inside strength and you need to be a bit patient all the way forward on the pad, block, don't allow Makarov to have enough space. You know, if you give him space on the pad, he'll really drag and open you. You are basically saying that Daniel is the only one that learned some lesson from that match while Arthur is just like...
Mindaugas: He can improve. You and Artur pulled in 2018 and you beat him one match there. And since then you have been pulling all over the world while Artur has been mostly inactive because they are banned from events.
Mindaugas: And we all thought that you improved probably that way, that much, and he improved this much, and then he came and beat you 4-0. So don't underestimate the guy. No, no, so I would never really underestimate him. Whoever beats him for sure still has to be in his peak, peak shape and gets lucky and everything has to go correctly. So Marko is just that good, of course. He's a champ. But I'm just saying that I think Daniel would probably adjust when he pulls him next time, and I think he would go more forward and just be more patient.
Mindaugas: And then Cherkasov. Allen three of these guys have the ability to... I think I'm struggling the most because I may not have that ability yet to really meet him in the center and be brave. So I have to go the hard way. Okay, one guy says that you wanted an honest opinion from him. Just because he tells the honest opinion, it doesn't mean that I will not...
Mindaugas: disagree with him you know just we are just friends you know he tells me and i tell him like i'm not here to say oh yes and of course respect the champion yeah yeah yeah anyway so and and in autumn who who do you think is the the best light weight like just because he be done yet listen he beat 80 kilo current world champion omer and then he beat mindagas and he beat
Auden: to discredit the guy. But we cannot say that there is no one left. Well, I think it's Mandaugas. I think Mandaugas is the guy. I mean, who can beat him, right? There we go. Hey, when are you going to run it back? When are you going to get the rematch? Do you think you can do it?
Mindaugas: I think I can do it. I'm just waiting for Engin to say, yes, let's go again. Yeah, yeah. I mean, first of all, people are asking me about Cherkasov. Ford Cherkasov, guys, it has nothing to do with us.
Mindaugas: My honest opinion is not Cherkasov's fault, but there is a water list, you know, and the water list, you know, like it is for the events who are doing tests. So when you go there, those events, you need to make sure that you don't have any prohibited substance. So when he competed, the Russian nationals, they did the test and he tested positive.
Mindaugas: So it has nothing to do with us. We can't, you know, we can't, you know, because he's banned. He can't be at that event. Some people say, do you have tests in your event? No, we don't have it. But people know it.
Mindaugas: But when you go to the Russian nations, when you go to WAF, you know that there's a test. You need to play the rules according to the rules. But Cherkasov, in my opinion, do you know the medicine that tested him positive? It is a vertigo medicine. You know vertigo? Those crystals behind your ear that when they just move, you lose the balance. The guy used vertigo medicine. I understand. I mean, I'm not...
Mindaugas: arguing with water or something but if you are doing like a shooting or something maybe it is helping i don't know what how it helps you know concentration i have used vertical medicine two times when i get up from the bed so quickly i thought it was like yeah earthquake i was just i just couldn't balance myself because those crystals move and i use the vertical medicine as well i don't even know how it is helping you i mean if anyone wants to go to a competition
Mindaugas: Like, by using something and cheat in that event, Test 7, Vertigo Medicine would probably be the last thing that you would consider, you know. You would go there with something else, you know. So anyway, so the guy was just... It really seemed like Oleg's situation was a bit unfortunate. Like, I think he was using that medicine and he just didn't notice that suddenly they put it on the list. Yes, yes, this is what I'm saying. Oleg Cherkasov used Vertigo Medicine and he got banned for three years.
Mindaugas: Until next year, I cannot invite him, but he knows it. I even tried. I even tried when the Russian Anti-Doping Agency was considering.
Mindaugas: But Vov said that it needs to come from VADA, World Anti-Doping Agency. And then since that's not possible with you, I told Cherkozo, I said, Cherkozo, you are in my book is a legend. You are a legend. And I would love to have you. I mean, we are like brothers in arms. But unfortunately, I can't. And I know that in my book, you are not guilty. But Alain Zolev, I think that if, but I don't think, do you think Alain Zolev can make,
Mindaugas: I'm not able to make it anymore, maybe, I don't know. Ah, but he made 75 for some time, and he competed the Russian nations at 80, so since the category is 77, it looks possible. Most likely, he can still make it. Yeah, you versus Alain Zoller would be good. Would be interesting, yeah. That would be...
Mindaugas: In my mind, it could be an easier match for me instead of Makaro, to be honest, because, again, I have played... Do you know why? Because Artur is applying a lot of side pressure with the downside of his hand, while Alonso is arm wrestling with his wrist alone, you know. You don't have the crushing side pressure when you pull Alon. And maybe Makaro just has more wrist strength.
Mindaugas: Yeah, I remember still when I was fighting him, round one, I grip up with him and I noticed that his wrist is literally like this thing, like double mine. And I'm thinking, what am I supposed to open here? So... I can show you.
Mindaugas: who do you guys think would win i think it would be an amazing match and yeah there needs to be
Mindaugas: It needs to be said at some point. But listen, Tata Sings is, I can tell you, one of the bravest guys. Right from the beginning, I started working with him. I asked him, first time I offered him a match, do you want to pull Gizdanov or Ivan Matushenko? He says,
Mindaugas: Who is stronger? I said, probably Di Dzeranov because he is now heavier. He said, okay, send me that guy. So he would probably say no to Levan Levan Saginashvili, but other than Levan Levan Saginashvili, I think that he would say yes to...
Mindaugas: other matches. But the guy is now in 95, 105. I ask him, he pulls. He says, you're the boss. Just tell me why I'm pulling. And I'm pulling, you know. That guy is easiest guy to work with. Easiest guy. Minda Agost, can I say to you, Arturo? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm joking, joking, joking. Just joking. I'm sure everyone knows that I'm joking. Okay, let's go. We went to Paul versus Arsen Kacetarian.
Mindaugas: And today, I did an announcement in the replacement match for Alex Kurdecha. It is because Jerry has some private reasons. And so, Morozov versus Alex Kurdecha. Let's start with Ryan.
Ryan Bowen: Yeah, interesting matchup I see. They're both very large humans. Adam Morozov being the flesh is always impressive when you see him. No doubt can match up against Khadija. Ford me, Morozov is a very muscular-driven arm wrestler. And what I mean by that being compared to that of a joint-based arm wrestler, I see him with a wrist flexion, bicep strength sort of emphasis.
Ryan Bowen: Alex Kurdecha likes to use his levers, likes to really, really, really dig down on that elbow and pronate hard using the length of his forearm and the joints. I think that it likely is a match that's going to have magnificent shape to it. It can go everywhere. Alex can pop his wrist.
Ryan Bowen: Morozov can scoop it into a defensive hook and go from there. We can see King's moves. We can see floor presses. This is a match where the shape of it really has a lot of options. It goes a long way. On the right hand, I think that my gut feel leans towards Adam Morozov. He's just got that density about him that just seems like his power level's a little higher, but I think that if it's going to go Kadej's way, it's because of
Ryan Bowen: good positional play and the right decisions at the right time um i feel like it almost could be a the match could come down to alex kadecha's decision making if he makes a perfect if he makes a perfect tactical decision the whole round i think he can win the match but if he makes an error i think i think morozov is the stronger human if it gets arm on arm and morozov will be able to really put a lot of
Mindaugas: damage into Kurdecha's chain if it gets there. So if Kurdecha can execute perfectly, I think he can do it. But I think Morozov's the favorite. Okay, Arun, before that, I will ask you another question and then this question. Arun, Neil Pickup just wrote, 100 gorillas versus one piece of Mindaugas Thalassitis. Oh, Mindaugas, easy. Mindaugas, no problem. Yeah, all day long. Allen day, every day. Yeah, let's go. Let's go, Arun.
Auden: Yeah, but you know, this match, I am very excited about this match. I'm totally tossed up. I'm not sure at all who's going to win it. Like, they're both incredibly strong. They both have better endurance than you'd expect. Artem's endurance is crazy. And I always thought Alex Kovacic's endurance was not that good. But we saw when he pulled left how he stayed with Artem and was able to keep fighting after losing rounds even.
Mindaugas: Can I cut you for one second? The Morozov that you saw during the Kurdecha match and Morozov's shape like that you saw against Laletin. You remember that Morozov had some stomach issues like he was gonna pull against Levan and other things you know. Do you think that Morozov got so much bigger and stronger since the Kurdecha match?
Auden: I think he's way bigger and stronger. Way bigger and stronger. And you know, an interesting thing to me is I was watching very closely the Vitaly prep for when he was pulling Michael Todd. And when Artem was pulling Vitaly, Artem has a Kings move. I didn't know this about Artem, but he can go there if needed. So, and he's looking incredible right now. I am thinking slight edge towards Artem, but I'm very, very excited about this match. And Mindagos?
Mindaugas: i'm not really sure why auden mentioned the king's move it's the best option that wasn't going to do anything so i wasn't sure about that but um yeah was marozo already i thought he was already recovered uh when he was fighting uh kurdecha just look at the photos and videos you you will see the the okay so if he yeah he was he probably right now is about thinking heavier
Mindaugas: Okay, so Morozov being heavier, plus it's the right arm. He already beat Alex on the left while not feeling that great, let's say. I think with the right arm, Alex is better with top roll, with left arm, with the wrist and side pressure. I think he's more confident, you know, about... But right arm is the top of specialists, but yeah, go ahead. Alex is left-handed, right? His left was always... I mean, he says that his left arm is stronger than his right arm, but yeah, I think...
Mindaugas: So it kind of looks like Morozov should probably take it. I don't know. That's going to be his second match on the same day. So that's also a big factor. Yeah, I will give him very near two hours, you know, Alex. Alex, before he accepted the match, he said he wants to train.
Mindaugas: right and left, and he said that there is a method to understand how quick you can recover or something. And he tried that, and then he said, Engin, yeah, I need this much of time in between the matches. He said that for me, that one match is more important, and I want to pull him. You can't really force him. If it was a main event, then yes, but main event, we have the...
Mindaugas: uh level versus hermes match so we can't we couldn't move this match from the main event if it was the main event so you are saying now sometimes you know taking too much time in between those two different matches is maybe also not a good idea okay how can we make you happy
Mindaugas: No, I mean, you know, when I was fighting Hunter after struggling with Giannis, I was almost happy that it didn't take that long, you know, just I think one match in between, something like that. And, you know, of course, maybe my kind of recovery, maybe I would get cold if I had to wait longer. But maybe for Alex, I don't know, it might be different. Maybe he needs to rest a little bit. It just almost seems like it may be a danger to just, you know, cool down fully. I think...
Ryan Bowen: I think if Kurdecha beats Devon, I think he'll get smashed by Morozov. If he loses to Devon, I think he'll do really well against Morozov. The adrenaline dump or the euphoria of a big victory is one of the most devastating things for a follow-up match, I've noticed. So if he has a really good result against Devon...
Ryan Bowen: I think Morozov will walk all over it because his excitement, everything that the hormonal dump will happen of him just celebrating a massive moment against Devon. And then there won't be anything left. Where if he loses to Devon, he'll still have that fire and the grit and he'll be like, ah, come on, I've got to get at least one win tonight. Yeah.
Mindaugas: You know, Devon's style almost drains the energy out of you. Devon is not smashing people to the side, so he will always really take everything you have. So it's almost, when you lose to him, it's still difficult to... Morozov, first year, you know, like,
Mindaugas: East versus West, two, three, four, and five, he took right and left matches in all those four events, except Prudnik right time, he won all the other seven matches. He had eight matches in four events, and he won seven of them. He didn't have easy matches. You know, he had some... Do you remember how much time did he normally take in between the matches?
Mindaugas: Yeah, I mean, usually I put at least like three, four matches, you know, in between, like, yeah. I mean, I think that if the guy is pulling two matches, I think we need to really ask him, you know, how much time do we need? You know, we can't really question, you know, for anything, but we cannot really put Devon versus Alex match like a starter match either, you know, like it needs to be a little bit, you know,
Mindaugas: It's an important matchup, you know, Alex versus Devon match. So, okay, let's go to some other matches as well. Michael Todd versus Di Dzeranov. Let's start with Alvin this time. I'm a huge Michael fan, really. Every time I always say Michael's going to win and this one's no different. I think stylistically, I have not seen Di Dzeranov flop.
Auden: and I don't think you can keep his hand against Michael. I think keeping your hand against Michael in this form is really hard to do. He's just got such incredible pronation, and he's got that really hard sticking point where you kind of have to flop through, and it seems to be really hard to do. So I know Dzeranov can cut in super hard, but
Mindaugas: And he cut him without his wrist. We're going to find out. I don't think he can. I think Michael's going to bleed him. He might get round one. He might get round one. The interesting part is that two of the best tacklers in the world, Ermes and Laletin, they had to end up with flop press against Michael, you know.
Mindaugas: you know everything so it just shows that Michael is in a great shape but I understand Ermes' arm muscle perfectly the way he beat Michael can be a lesson
Mindaugas: in Arnold's school and show you know how to beat that guy. And the way that Laletin beat him, I shared this before, I don't know if you guys saw or not, but like normally when Michael goes far, he has a resting point, you know, like there is somewhere that he goes too far for you to apply pressure, you know, but he didn't have that comfortable spot because Vitaly was able to reach
Mindaugas: everywhere you know like everywhere even if you might would go outside probably it was too rich anymore i know i'm extremely but and the second thing is that when michael is like this he usually you know climbs but when you have a grip or the
Mindaugas: strongest hand in the world about grip power i mean you can't do anything and and then he was even michael was even losing his riser while waiting there and whenever i asked michael like why did you try to sleep or go with a shoulder presser you were even able to go step with outside movement
Mindaugas: he said he didn't want to go there in Strap. So he wanted to do something outside of Strap. He didn't like what he felt there, you know. But I'm telling you, like, those could be, like, very bad matchups. And we all learned something. I didn't know that Vitaly could do such thing. But Michael, whenever you want a title match, you really need to beat at least one of these guys. So he had to pull these guys, yeah.
Auden: So you are saying that Desirnoff is going to get exhausted and then Michael is going to win. But do you expect it to be easy match or very, very big battle? Hard, hard, hard, long match. I just think it's so hard to pin Michael. And if Desirnoff, he doesn't have the long arm like Vitaly, and I don't know how well he can climb up. And those are the kind of two only answers we've seen that are able to deal with Michael. Straight pressing through.
Auden: We saw Camille try and he couldn't do it. And he's got one of the best, best flop press. So I, I predict it's, it's not going to work out. It's going to get real close and there might be some like cheeky fouls, but I just think he's going to gas him out eventually. What kind of fouls?
Mindaugas: like it's going to be it's going to get real close maybe either michael coombs coming off the back to get the restart or does there not come forward to start again there's gonna be like a bunch of files but you don't expect the win you don't expect it i do not no i don't expect the pin from dessert off i don't and and and me nervous no so yeah michael of course all respect to michael but to me it almost seems like uh
Mindaugas: for all these bigger heavyweights, Michael is becoming like a test. Can you flop wrist press? You know, if you cannot, you lose. Like, if you can, you have a chance. Which is a nice test for everyone to have. I'm sure, you know, everyone is forced to improve their techniques and be versatile. So we will see, can Dzeranov flop wrist press or not? Yeah, my opinion is, like, the Dzeranov, the horsepower,
Mindaugas: probably stronger than Vitaly. But whenever he pulled Vitaly, he didn't have any chance to access his power. But now I think that, yes, Michael is very strong and his technique will be probably very bad to Dzeranov as it has been to anyone else. But I think that Dzeranov will also have chance. He won't get flash pinned by Michael. And I think there will be a dog war. And Ryan,
Ryan Bowen: Yeah, Levan is one of the most impressive specimens I've ever stood next to. He seems like he's built of granite. So his raw strength, I think, is above Michael's, but Michael's positional play is problematic for everyone. I don't think there's anyone in the world, with the exception of perhaps Levan, that can just control Michael to the pad right now.
Ryan Bowen: I think he's probably the only one. Zoranoff's built like someone who will attempt that. I think he'll try to keep his wrist. I think he'll try to search sideways and contain. But I don't think he'll get through. I want to see more people try to play a really patient game against Michael. Michael makes you get desperate and makes you want to flop press.
Ryan Bowen: But as you said, Ermias put on a great display of patience where you go back to centre, you relax, and you say to Michael, you do something. What are you going to do to pin me? Because I think Michael's the world's best defensive puller when it comes to that last third of the table.
Ryan Bowen: If you want a little bit of hand control against him and you just retreat to your own defensive side, it's very difficult to see how Michael pins Dzeranov if Dzeranov's still got some fuel. So I think that if Dzeranov plays a very patient game like Ermes, then he can get the victory because Michael will use up a lot of fuel in the defense and struggle to pin someone with as much muscularity as Dzeranov if Dzeranov didn't panic and just go all out for press.
Mindaugas: If he panics and goes all out for a press, I don't see him getting through Mike. So it's up to how he plays. Do you guys think that you said something, which I agree that LeJuan looks like is the only guy that can flash ping Michael. But do you guys think that there is some possibility that even LeJuan may need this, you know, in some of the rounds? Yeah, it's a possibility. It's the easiest way to do it. Yeah, yeah.
Mindaugas: anyway so okay so where are we now one more thing i think ryan just had a very good point but i'm also thinking that not many people you know especially big people like gerrano normally i think they are also panicking if they have to stay statically in the center you know they know that we are gassing ourselves as well but yeah if you have the ability to stay a bit more defensively you know suddenly it becomes so much easier to
Mindaugas: Yeah, it is also very, very, very hard thing to bring that arm to the pad, you know, until he gets it out, you know. Like, if you are not like Levan or Vitaly or something, you know, with those flush pins. Okay, this guy is asking a question, Arlan. Lone Ranger, he says, ask Arlan about water fasting. Arsen you right now water fasting?
Auden: No, well, I did. I did a three-day water fast. Yeah, it was nice. Really good. Okay, how did you feel? I think it's the best. What did you feel? What was the difference did you feel? Did you do three days? Yeah, so I did three days only water. I think it's great for you. I think it's the better way to cut. I think it's super healthy every once in a while. And you feel great. Day one is kind of hard, but the rest is just easy.
Mindaugas: To me, I plan to do this. What's that? I plan to do this. It's very good. It's very, very good. They said it's for health. It's very good, you know. Yeah. I agree. Yeah. Okay. One guy is asking, Engin, when will you return in armwrestling? According to me, that was never, according to me, possibly end of this year. Yeah. Oh, there we go. Nice. Nice. Yeah. What category? In short term, 85.
Mindaugas: Long term, who knows, you know? If someone doesn't run away, I may go down to 7-7 eventually. I'm sure Ingen wants to come back, but his power is the problem. It doesn't really... Listen, I will tell you something you will not believe. Like last few years I didn't train, I felt like I'm collapsing, like I'm finished. I said it will never happen. And then last one and a half month I am training.
Mindaugas: Everything is coming back and joints, like, feel better. I don't know why. Is it because it rested a long time? But trust me, like, the best I have ever, ever done, 115 kilo, of course, double cable, the pronation.
Mindaugas: only like how many days ago, five days ago or six days ago, I did hundreds. So I'm like, wow, you know, but the bigger muscle groups like bicep, chest, you know, like they are coming a little bit behind, it's coming behind.
Mindaugas: The forearm things, you know, seriously, it's coming. I'm telling you. I don't know if it's going to take three months or four months. I'm sure that Johan's got a lot healthier after you gave him a long break. Yeah. You also need to be a little bit careful. Maybe it feels good now, but if you push too much, again, you might... I go slowly, even if I can't... Like, I will tell you something. Ford example, the reverse curl. But when I do this curl, I do very strict. Like, when somebody curls, they go like, you know, this. Like, whenever I do it, I go like this. Like, full motion.
Mindaugas: Just forearm moves. Now you know me, you know how I do. And like I have now, last training, I did 10% more than I have ever done. I don't know how that happened. Yeah, but bicep is behind. But the reverse curl, I don't know. It was just like more than, I don't know how that happened. But the size is coming very slow. Like, I mean, I have seen 43-something bicep. Now it's like 38 and a half. It's coming, but slowly. That's my size now.
Mindaugas: Yeah, yeah, I am. Yeah, that's small. Yeah, it's not good. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I know, I know. Anyway, so let's go to Wagner Bortalato versus Manuel Battaglia. Battaglia, I don't know how we call his name, but Battaglia? Battaglia kind of makes sense. Yeah, yeah.
Mindaugas: And people may not know about Manuel. Manuel is WAF World Champion with left arm. He has won WAF Worlds. And his opponent is Wagner Bortalato who is coming back from the bicep tear. And let's go Ryan.
Ryan Bowen: Yeah, this gentleman I had to look up because I was one of the guys who didn't know him well off the top of my head. And as soon as I started looking him up, I'm like, okay, he's got a left arm victory on Dimitri Trubin when Dimitri Trubin was still around. And that looked incredibly impressive. And then more recently, I saw him up against Reno Massage and he lost to Reno, but his hand control was impressive. And
Ryan Bowen: He was taking Reno's wrist, really forcing Reno to have to get a really fast start in order to get control on him. So Manuel looks like a monster to me, very impressive. And I was surprised that I personally hadn't heard the name before as much as this guy looks like he deserves. So I'm happy to see him on this stage.
Ryan Bowen: Wagner, one of the long stayers in this arena, we know left is an impressive arm. He's got that flop press victory on Devon that everyone always likes to put in highlight reels. So we know that he can bring it out. When it comes to energy and intensity, Wagner's hard to beat. So this is a big match, powerful match. I think that
Ryan Bowen: From what I'm seeing, Manuel probably has the edge in hand control. Wagner, we know he's classically can go frame on frame with almost anyone. He made Michael Todd's arm blow up back in the day on Arm Wars. So Wagner's one of those guys that
Ryan Bowen: You can't write off. He's been around and he, when you, when you look at Wagner's training, he's the most frantic trainer in the, in the world, the way he throws around things. Some of his highlight reels with, with lat pull down machines bouncing around in the, in the, in the gym. Uh, he's a, he's an excitement machine. So I think it's a great match. I have no idea who wins it. I see manual taking hand control Wagner with a press that could go either way. And Arnold.
Auden: I'm a huge Wagner fan, huge Wagner fan. Anytime he gets on the stage, I always get very excited. I think Wagner was going through a couple, like a year or so where he was really banged up and kept taking matches and injuries kept getting worse and worse. I'm glad he's taking some time and seems to have gotten healthy, seems to have recovered. I'm excited to see him back on the main stage. I think stylistically. Yeah. Like, like, uh, Ryan was saying the hand is probably gonna get lost from Wagner, but I think he can likely continue through.
Mindaugas: He's very famous for having an awesome explosive inside frame power. And I just, I gotta go with Wagner. I'm just such a huge fan of his. I think he's the guy to win it. Can I ask you something, Adam? How much role does it play, you know, you to be a fan of a guy when you do the prediction, how much do you involve your feelings? How much do you go by pure arm wrestling analyzing?
Auden: I am terrible. I am so emotional when it comes to arm wrestling. I think the last time I was two for 11 on my predictions. So I am like the worst at it. And every time I'm like, oh, this guy's going to win for sure. And I think about it afterwards and I'm like, why did I think the guy was winning? Why did I think that for a second? I'm just a fan of that guy. So I know I'm very emotional when it comes to predictions, but I just know that's who I am. So I can't really stop myself. No, no, I'm just asking. Of course, you know, we all are.
Mindaugas: how we are, you know, you don't have to, I mean, be as people expect you to or want you to be, so it's good. I just wanted to know how it is. Definitely very emotional, yeah. Yeah, yeah, I mean, yeah, there's nothing better about it, yeah. And you won't be nervous. Yeah, so Ryan was saying that Emmanuel is maybe not so well-known worldwide, but I think here in Europe we really know him very well. He was just slowly climbing, always getting better, so...
Mindaugas: i know emmanuel is very good and then yeah he's a top roller um wagner again was struggling for quite a few years somehow yeah not sure if it was injuries or what was it but um injured yeah if he is somehow if he didn't fix that then i would maybe give some advantage to emmanuel but let's say he fixed that so it kind of looks like a very even matchup so i guess in that case you kind of have to look at techniques wagner's press might be dangerous for emmanuel
Mindaugas: um stylistically i have to give something some advantage to wagner so final decision maybe wagner 55 i mean i kind of see manuel is taking the risk but how good wagner is if his hand is taken i know he can still press that way but we will see we will see yeah and there is one guy says that he says
Mindaugas: Only Engin can beat Samusha. It is written in Destiny, come back Engin. I don't think so. Today I said another world title match for Samusha in 85kg, which I will not announce. And he said this is his 11th world title match. So if he wins, he needs to win the 12th one to get his four belts. And I don't think anyone will ever
Mindaugas: do such thing again, like winning four belts in the same category. And if Devon stays around 105 or 150, you know, but super heavyweight when Levan is there, Levan can do as well, but Levan only push twice a year, so it will take a while, you know, he needs to be very
Mindaugas: I said, you know, do you accept the match? He said, yes. And he said, is the next you? I said, no, you are too strong for me, you know. And of course, this is what my mouth says, and I really believe what I say, but who knows what future brings, you know. I think at the end, Ryan Bowen will beat Samusha.
Mindaugas: Listen, as soon as we started the program, Aldo messed with him. I asked their weight, and then Aldo says about 105, and then Ryan said, yeah, almost the same weight, and then Aldo said, oh, I thought you were 86. And now you came, and now you kind of probably implied a similar thing, just leave the guy alone, you know? Yeah.
Mindaugas: i think you know i think it's legit ryan probably has as high of a chance as odin winning four belts uh in some weight class you know so it's not sure it's very realistic okay go ahead i'd love i'd love to pull you something but i don't know i don't know if i get to get the chance but i love that i love the feel okay yeah yeah i mean you guys like for 85 kilo i mean incredible yeah
Mindaugas: Okay so let's go. This match also like I don't know maybe like we know Joseph Meranto and he pulled two matches one was in Atlantic City and the other one was in Arlington and he did very well and now we set him against Ivan Portela like
Mindaugas: You pull him, I remember in Zlotysk. He looks a bit different now in the picture, but I think I have pulled him in the past. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He is like, listen, he started like 55-kilo world title. I don't know, he probably won 60. They say he won 10 world titles. Maybe some of them are masters, but many of them are senior. He has incredible forearm. Even when he was 55-kilo,
Mindaugas: like he is a legend you know in our sport that people don't know whenever i said this much people goes like who the hell is this guy he may not be you know like we're the best at today's arm wrestling but but that is one of the top guys that i could bring to north america because of the visa issues and i think maranto is also he's very very good but he may not be at the
Mindaugas: very best 70 kilo uh not yet but maybe in the future but that is slowly going there and uh you start with that so it was the 70 kilo match then 70 kilo yeah okay okay
Mindaugas: No, I think Meranto is too good. I don't expect the Spanish guy to bring the shape which he once had. I think Meranto. But where do you think the Meranto is? You say this, but do you mean like Meranto is right now?
Mindaugas: had the head with the alex zavarashvili or some other other other uh european or or kazakh or russian monsters i guess we have to find out it's still not clear but his performance in um where was it the last usa yeah yeah but there was another north american puller so we don't exactly know where he is because i don't exactly know where cody would but he would though he beat uh
Ryan Bowen: I gripped Cody Wood in the back after the matches. I felt his level and then I had a good one with Meranto. So I'm like, okay, I got a feeling of that level. But I always find that when a new guy arrives, he usually takes a real bad loss to a veteran.
Ryan Bowen: And then he has to go back and recognize, okay, I need, I need to change this, this, and this. There's something about being a veteran of the sport where your joints, your joint conditioning just, just goes to a level that is different. And I think that Meranto is going to run into that without knowing Ivan Portela's true level. I looked up his stats. He's like, it said nine times WAF, eight times European, 27 times Spanish champion. So, so, and it even, it even hanged.
Ryan Bowen: reflect what you said about him being a legend AI summed him up and said people compare him to John Brzenk so I was like wow okay so he's his achievements are really really good yeah but he's not as where he used to be like right now he doesn't even compete senior category he competes Masters okay okay so what style of puller is he what style of puller is that's why I said that they will just go
Ryan Bowen: Both inside. That is what I am expecting, unless they show me something new. So for me then, I would expect Joseph Meranto, like I often see in you guys that they have a stronger 1RM in a muscular sense than older guys, but then it gets to the joints and the joints of the older guy make the difference. And case in point, someone like Todd Hutchins won't have the same 1RMs as a Rackley. And yet we see how
Ryan Bowen: how matches balance out. I just, I'm such a big, I value so highly joint conditioning. If you've been pulling 20 plus years, it feels, it seems to me like that's a huge, huge factor. So my gut feel is Portela will win this match. Did you know that Joseph is training partner of John Bersink? No, I didn't. I didn't know that. I didn't. That's pretty cool. That makes some difference because you learn a lot. You understand? You learn a lot. And Adam?
Auden: I tend to agree with everything Ryan said. The only thing that I would say different is I know Joseph has really, really good bicep endurance. And if they get in a hook and if that match stops, yeah, well, the joint conditioning may not be the same because Joseph is a whole lot newer. I think if at all he can get on the biceps and it's just an endurance battle, I have not seen Joseph yet lose. And he out-endured Kevin Pavlo. He out-endured Cody Wood.
Mindaugas: And these guys have really good endurance. I'm always very impressed with Joseph, just how he trains, how he goes with arm wrestling. I think if the match stops, if they get into a grinder, it's going to start swinging Joseph's way. Yeah, he is one of those guys that I really enjoy offering a match because they get so excited. They're so happy. Whenever I see that excitement in an arm wrestling,
Mindaugas: I'm like, wow, you know, like I really feel very good for those people because like I believe in dreams. I believe in goals. Like whenever the guy is getting so excited, it means that he wants to prove something. The guy needs to get the opportunity. By the way, like when I'm sitting like this, my shoulder heads are making some shadow, you know, does it make you nervous? Yeah.
Mindaugas: no no no okay okay yeah because if it is like it's like there's no problem you know you get the traps coming out again again that's good yeah yeah i i like to mess with me i love that that is like you can expect a huge trash talk if i'm pulling that guy if i'm pulling daniel prokopchuk or arthur macaro
Mindaugas: I don't know. But with such a guy, we go back and forth. Of course, we don't cross borders, but he gets on my nerves like nobody gets. He says very calmly, he said he was going to do that move to me in Istanbul. And I was like, I stressed out for like a few weeks. I was like, what if he does that in front of my people? And you're going to hit him like you never hit anybody. That never happens, you know.
Mindaugas: To me, it's just more fun this way. It's really more fun. Yeah, yeah, for sure, for sure. And I know that you have an unfinished business with me. And I know that a lot of people will support me, support you against me, including Neil Pickup and some others that I don't want to mention. And so that whenever I pull against you, I will be feeling like I'm also beating those people. So it's good, you know, yeah.
Auden: Engin, you will kill Mindaugas. You will kill him. I felt him. He's overrated. He's not that good. Oh, you felt him? Yeah, I helped him warm up for the Yannis match. Nothing special? Nothing special. He's pretty good. He's okay. What did you say, Mindaugas? He felt the pad. The pad was soft, so he felt good. I did feel the pad a lot. I was a good warm-up partner. I let you pin me. I was like, okay, you can go. I'll allow it. I was hoping you would give me something more, but they just never...
Mindaugas: no i never came also you are saying that he gave his all to you and it still wasn't enough for you oh not right for me right through me audrey was trying to act like that he's uh maybe not giving everything and maybe he was tired from before but i know that he was really just getting how come you guys didn't pull after that really after i just missed each other i think i don't know
Mindaugas: i got in the after pool tables i was i was there a lot but yeah we already knew the result anyways yeah yeah yeah yeah but you'll you'll beat him i mean you'll beat him if i pull him if i pull him right now we are 12-2 it will be if you pull all five rounds it will be 17-2 so don't worry who is counting super super match wins then even that way
Mindaugas: I am 4-1 against you. Even that way, 4-1. So 12-2 is like six times. 4-1 is four times. So it's okay. Both are okay. I beat Lithuanian Europeans. I beat Zlotys. I beat you two different Supermatches, right and left. So you beat me one event. I don't want to even mention how the things went. Now you're happy about beating an upper-comer new guy. Upper-comer? Upper-comer, you were like...
Mindaugas: Zloty champion, you were like, you beat one match Arthur Makaro, you were head to head with him. And now it's like, oh, wait a second. No, not wait a second. He's telling me, everyone, he sees me.
Mindaugas: Even you are 95 kilo, come. And now he's saying, I say, listen, I can go 77, but I can go 85. He's telling me, even if I'm 95, it's okay. Now I say, I can go 85. He says, but you're going to tell people that you are 85 kilo, right? I said, of course I'll tell, but...
Mindaugas: I thought it wasn't your concern. You would beat me when I'm 95. I think we should just announce the match. Hey, I am 85 kilo. He sounds scared. He sounds scared. I mean, he sounds scared. Yeah, exactly. Let's announce the match today. Let's find the date. Let's make it happen.
Mindaugas: No, until you go on social media, make a post. I told you, I wrote to you. You never did it. Ryan, I wrote to him. I said, you were going to beat me when I'm 95. Now 85, you are telling me. But you're going to tell people, right, that you are 85. And now I say, listen, listen, I know where it is going. I will beat you when I say I was 85 kilo.
Mindaugas: If you go on social media, say, Engin, I know you are like 90 something kilo, 92. Just go there on 85 kilo. I will destroy you. And then I said, I will pull you. He never did. I can show you. I can read the whole conversation if you want. Wait, wait. I think at this point, I just understood that Engin will not really do it. He's not really coming back. So I'm like, okay, let's leave him alone. I told you. I told you what I said. That's a cowardly move.
Mindaugas: yeah anyways so i don't think england is coming back guys you sure yeah i don't know it looks good anyways so we will see we will see yeah anyways don't do like this you are not intimidating at all you know just look at the neck jujitsu neck oh
Mindaugas: you got that small head thing because you are the last person to intimidate someone with your physical look so i should probably stop doing this poses right yeah because you are more dangerous when you are you know how you are and everything that he is trusting oh yeah he's intelligent his tendons are like still and now whenever you do this
Mindaugas: And then I'm like, okay, now he's trusting this and it looks nothing. I mean, yeah. So yeah, what should I do instead? You know, when I enter a stage, what do I do? Do I just stand quietly or what?
Mindaugas: Listen, your physical look doesn't scare me, but your, how to say, I mean, actually nothing scares me. So let's go. Something scares Engin. Okay, good. He just doesn't want to tell us.
Mindaugas: No, I said nothing. I tried to find something to make you happy. I thought, I thought, I thought. I'm sure it's something. You just didn't want to admit it. Yeah, you just wish. Okay, Matt Mask versus Irakli Zirakashvili. Matt Mask pulled two events in a row. He pulled in Arlington, he came to Istanbul, and then to give him another match with right arm is very unfair, while Irakli last time pulled in beginning of the February.
Mindaugas: So in Iraq, now he got the visa with left arm. He didn't pull for like six years, but I know he has been training. And Matt Mask, people underestimate Matt Mask. Matt Mask has given some hard time to Devon.
Mindaugas: in like during their career you know i have seen him even one time pinning them in one of the wl matches so people people are underestimating matt and some people says matt is gonna kill iraqli so where do we start we start from uh ryan yeah interesting one there's a great amount of heat between these two uh coming off the back of the new gochukadze dominant victory we saw i saw iraqli saying
Ryan Bowen: Matt Mask will never touch a Georgii again. We will dominate him forever. And I think Matt's one of the best guys in the sport for taking a loss well. I love the way he took it. He can somehow swear at his opponents and still be highly entertaining. It never seems offensive from Matt Mask.
Ryan Bowen: And I love the tension that is now built between Matt Mask and all of Team Georgii. So I think this is a great match. It's going to be, it's almost like a sequel to the Nugo Chikadze match. So the fans are going to love this one. I think that in being in North America, it's going to be hometown for Matt Mask. He's going to have a lot of energy. And I don't know if O'Reilly's ever been to the USA before. I don't think he has. But
Ryan Bowen: going into your opponent's home ground, no matter what the sport, it does make a difference. It really does. And Matt's a guy who will take that home ground crowd and run with it. His energy is going to be mega. I think Matt Mask is the favorite in this match because of that factor. I think stylistically, top role being top role is going to be great. Matt is the taller man. I think Matt will be more comfortable against Irakli stylistically than he was Nugo.
Ryan Bowen: Hugo made his arm come down really low where against the Rackley it's going to be more in the sweet spot that he's used to sort of attacking. I think Matt Mask is the favorite. I think Rackley's got a tough, tough task here. And the traveling factor. Rackley has never traveled to that side of the world while Matt against Lars in Orlando and then we saw him in
Mindaugas: Arlington against Ongarbea. We saw him against Marcio Barbosa in Atlantic City. Looks like when he's not traveling, he's just like, you know, yeah. I think Matt's going to run well. Yeah, I think, I'm not saying Matt is going to win, but I'm just saying that
Mindaugas: If people are thinking that, even if it is right arm, you know, Irakli lost against Ongarbe while Matt beat Ongarbe. People said that Ongarbe wasn't ready. They said that we don't know that, but yeah, I think it is going to be very, very good match. And let's go with Arsen. Arsen is going to say, I'm a huge fan of Matt. Exactly what I was going to say. Exactly. No, it's a really tough match. I think this one really comes down to just who can secure that high spot first.
Auden: And, you know, with the slightly shorter arm of a Rockley, if he ducks his thumb properly, there may be ways that he can just totally start with the rise. And I don't know if Matt is able to deal with that. We're going to find out. I think the edge has to go to Matt because he just does have a longer arm. And if the match at all slows down and the Rockley setup's not perfect, that height's going to matter. So I have to lean towards Matt, but his left is not as right. Both guys I don't think are as good left. No.
Mindaugas: I gotta go Matt. And Mindagos? Wait a second. Why did Orton just mention left? Is the match on the left? It matches left. I just explained this guy had two matches in a row in Arlington. He's not even listening. Do you know where his mind is? I thought you were saying that. I'm gonna... I thought you were saying that. Yeah, it's not fair, but it's still the right-hand match. Ah, okay. So left-handed. Wait a second.
Ryan Bowen: That's different. That's very different. What do you know about Matt's left arm? What do you know about him? As much as I know about Irakli's left arm. Matt has pinned Devon on left a couple of times in Supermatch. I think Devon won 3-2 or something in the Supermatch. But back in the WAL days, his left looked really good against Devon historically. Always, always close. Always close.
Mindaugas: that's what I know I think I'll just I'll assume that their left hands are maybe roughly as good as the right hands let's say in that case I would maybe say that um yeah Matt mask is such a physically impressive human being you would really expect him to do very well but in the past he kind of had matches where he failed a little bit
Mindaugas: So I was always somehow, you know, I always didn't really give him advantage anymore until he beat on Garbaev. So since he beat on Garbaev, I was like, wait a second, maybe Matt Mask is really good, but maybe it was a trap. Maybe I was tricked because maybe on Garbaev was just not that good at the time because the way Nugo handled Matt, that looked like normal Matt in the old days. Listen, the way that Nugo beat also
Mindaugas: Some other guys, Nugo is not a weak guy, he's strong. If we are going to give the gauntlet to Devon because of the practice pool with Morozov, we have to give Devon's belt to Nugo for the practice pool in Istanbul as well. I'm just joking. But I'm just saying that Nugo is a really strong guy.
Mindaugas: Yeah, what I was saying is that after the Andorga-Bayev match, I was starting to believe in Matt Mask a bit more. But now again, I don't believe in him. So I think... Irakli? Irakli will take it. That's interesting. We will see, we will see. I think that, like, whenever... I asked to, you know, Ozan Kocak. I asked to Ozan Kocak how Tautiev would do.
Mindaugas: against Nugo you know because they both won last matches he said that he will also have the same experience that Matt had because they both are very tall and so I they think he thinks that you know with such a short arm they will have a problem with the you know you know they can't really be like this yeah so okay so
Mindaugas: We need to go with the main event for now. And later we will talk again. Levan Levan Saginashvili vs. Ermes Gasparini. Ermes, almost daily we talk. He says, Engin, I'm gonna beat him. I'm gonna beat him. Really? Yes, yes. He's not bluffing.
Mindaugas: He really believes. Believes. Yeah, yeah. He believes that he's going to beat him. He doesn't say that he 100% will win or something, but he has a game plan.
Mindaugas: And he knows Levan, Levan also knows him. But I will tell you something, Ermes is the really golden boy of armwrestling today. Like he, whenever I asked him which, or somebody asked which match he took to like biggest lesson,
Mindaugas: he said it was the devon match and since then he has been training you know his hand in the past when he was his hand was much more like dominant than his arm and the more he gained weight more he started to trust you know his arm and then whenever he met devon
Mindaugas: now he realized that no no no this needs to come back and since then i can tell you because he shares with me like his front wrist which you call riser he says like 30 stronger and really will it be enough last time they pulled there was 60 kilo between them or 60 65 this time only 45 kilo he will be around 129 130
Mindaugas: Levan said he will be 174. So we are talking about 45 kilos. Of course, it's a big difference. And yesterday I had Levan, my guest. He looked lean. When I say lean, I don't mean small, but he looked like no unnecessary weight on him, you know. Okay, let's start this time with Alman.
Auden: It's so hard for me to vote against LaVon just because of how dominant he's been in every match. Even the one with Ermes last time, I think he played a little bit too much. He had a couple rounds where he kind of would hold for a second and then pin. And I do not see him doing that this time. I think this time he's coming in focused, not going to play. I think he really got mad about those last two rounds that he had to kind of forfeit. And I think he's coming in to just murder and run all the way through.
Auden: Ermes looks awesome. Ermes looks incredible. But it's so hard for me to pick anybody but Levan in any match. I mean, he's ranked number one for a reason. He's beaten every rightful challenger. Does it include your father next time? Well, again, we'll see. We'll see. But yeah, this one, Ermes has a chance. I think Ermes has a chance.
Mindaugas: the chances maybe maybe like a 40 percent maybe like 60 40 level on all right so you are giving 40 percent to hermes yeah so you are not saying he's gonna run over no i really don't think so i think because he will try to run over he will try to run over yeah do you think that the first a few rounds he played or because he couldn't control hermes's tornado so he took it here
Auden: And like, do you think that he tried to like play or. There was one round. I remember in particular where he gets them down easily and then looks at them and was like, and then finish it. And that one was definitely a play, definitely a play. And like you were saying though, with, uh, how army's been training, I think since he pulled my dad, his hand and rise and all of that, all that hand stuff has leveled up. And if you watch the last match with LeBron and armies,
Auden: his hand got blown apart, but his arm kind of stayed in it. So if this one, his hand can stay a little bit more and he can just be kicked back a little bit less, I think we got a match. I think we got a match. I do still have Levan winning it, but I would not be super surprised. Okay, if the match stops, if the match stops, as you say, you said that you still see Levan winning. So how the rest of the match will go, that Levan will win, in your vision, you know, like,
Auden: Visualize it, yeah. You know, Devon doesn't get enough credit for how good of an arm wrestler he is. He is just so overwhelmingly strong that he never really has to adapt. But when, if you look back, he has, like every once in a while, he's had some tough matches and he's a very good arm wrestler. So I think towards the later rounds, I think the first couple rounds, Devon's going to go right through. But maybe if you can slow him down, round three and four might get a little bit of a stop.
Auden: I think Levan will just readjust and work through him though. I really do. I think while Ermes has, there is a chance he can do it. I think Levan is just, he's too complete. He's everything. He's everything an arm wrestler needs to be. Yeah, I feel the same about Ermes as well. About well roundness and table IQ. But there is a genetic difference.
Mindaugas: different i i just do not know one thing about about levan like his hand as a block like incredible but does he have that that that inner wrist here to control the pronator and pin because if he doesn't if he cannot control here where he will go he will he will go out and he will be missing that the pronator if he misses and he over pronates then we may
Mindaugas: end up seeing something similar before. So that is the part that, you know, I don't know if he can really, like, we have seen Levan beating people like this, but it's usually when somebody is trying to go in, he just curses and beats them. But if somebody is trying to go outside, remember one time, the one round against Lalecin, he tried to go sideways.
Mindaugas: And then his hand was, when his wrist was even going back, he rise up and then, yeah, we beat him that way. But so I'm not sure how strong his inner wrist will be. You know, I see this, this outside wrist to not to be bent back. He's there like very strong, but they, they, they curl into,
Mindaugas: every millimeter to control the depth. Because you don't control here, you pull here. That is how I lost against Mindagos at this low altitude. I was very easy top row, but I couldn't really control here. So I ended up on my brachioradialis. It was almost like same as Ermes versus Levan first match. Do you agree, Mindagos? Well...
Mindaugas: I almost don't remember my match with you anymore. It was so long. I top rolled you, but I couldn't finish it because I couldn't control your pronators. So that is how it went. Anyway, so you are saying that 60-40? 60-40, yeah. Do you want to add anything or that's all? I think I covered it, yeah. That's my thoughts.
Ryan Bowen: Okay, and let's go with Ryan and then with Mindaugas, and then I would like to talk a bit about Devon versus Vitaly, and then we can finish the podcast here. I've been sitting here thinking, listening and thinking, and I've given this match a lot of thought over the last few months, as we all have. And if it comes down to it, I think I'm going to say Ermes is going to win. I think Ermes will take it.
Ryan Bowen: I think you'll take it on the back of the extraordinary wrist rise that he's somehow produced. If you didn't know these two guys and you only were, if they'd never faced before and you knew nothing of their legacy, you just knew they were both completely capable arm wrestlers technically. And the only thing you had to go off was the 180 kilo weight
Ryan Bowen: cheat curl that Levan's doing that shows his power or the 67 kilo wrist rise that Ermes is doing, as well as the 52 kilo for 20 reps wrist rise. I think the wrist rise is more valuable than that enormous amount of bicep strength and brachioradial strength that Levan showed. And what I like about the Ermes
Ryan Bowen: The 67 kilos is crazy, but like the next, the next best we're seeing amongst the lead arm wrestlers that has been publicly shared at least is only like 52 kilos. So somehow Ermes has managed to pull out wrist rise that is not just a little bit ahead of everyone, but a significant amount ahead of everyone. And I've always, in my understanding and the way I felt the sport being dominant in wrist rise is the most rewarding strength to be dominant in.
Ryan Bowen: opportunity opens up off the back of wrist rise more than the back of any other individual strength. And even though Levan, I believe, has a stronger chain from the base of his wrist through to his shoulder, I believe he's got a stronger chain there than Ermes. I think we haven't seen Levan put out a wrist rise equivalent because I don't think he can do it. And I think that Ermes...
Ryan Bowen: that's where his match is going to be won and lost now when we talk about the power that levan has in the first surge yes it's going to be big it's going to be very big but we know that erm is i think we've seen him stop levan before and i think we'll see something similar again and that 50 kilo 52 kilos for 20 reps that ermis does shows me that he has immense endurance in his wrist rise as well
Ryan Bowen: Not just the one time 67 kilo first surge, but he can, he can sit there for a long time and defend, even if he's risk cracks, I believe he's going to keep access to his pronation really well because of that risk rise strength that he's got. I think LeBron isn't as aerobically fit. He doesn't have the, the, uh, anaerobic sort of endurance that, that Ermes has genetically. I think it has a better situation there and.
Ryan Bowen: I think that we are going to ultimately see rounds one and two look like the battle we saw last time. But this time, Ermes is going to win it. And then Ermes is going to come home by taking Levan's wrist and be the first person to decisively pin him. Wow, Ryan. Wow. What are you talking about? He's going to win round one and two, right? Yeah, I think Ermes is going to win round one. I think Ermes is going to win.
Mindaugas: Okay. There we go. I'm just giving the delusional run. Listen, listen, listen, listen, my friend. Listen, listen. Like nobody, nobody, like I don't know. I don't know anything. But the only thing is about Levan. Like Levan, we knew, you remember Levan versus Krasimir match? Yes. Levan tried to go out, out, and he got hooked, and then Krasimir won. Krasimir was 102 kilos.
Mindaugas: And at that time, we thought that like Levan, Hook, like 100 kilo guy beat him. Of course, Krasimir is not a regular 100 kilo, but you are pulling super heavyweight. He was 102 kilo. He can't beat super heavyweight. So we thought that would never pass. And then I saw him at the Europeans. I think it was in Bulgaria. And then he went to inside with Gennady. And it was a long war. So Levan in Hook.
Mindaugas: surprised head to head with Gennady and Levan in like a minute long match which means endurance and he ended up beating Gennady so you would never think that that would happen it was like wow how is this possible you know so what I'm just saying that Ermes is not the only one that learned something from the last match yeah Levan also learned something so what what what what surprised that you know you said that you know like
Ryan Bowen: Maybe this happened, that happened, but we may see something. The guy is very intelligent. Go ahead. If I try to think about what Levan would have learned from that last match, it perhaps would have been not to overtop Roll. Devon't put yourself in a position where RMS can get his shoulder behind and isolate the bicep.
Ryan Bowen: stay taller for longer only halfway top roll to the pad first get control then play for position and not allow hermes into that but the risk of doing that is that ermy's wrist rise has a more opportunity to to to go a side and more opportunity to but if you stay at center too long i've seen people we've all seen arm wrestlers hit have a bit of control almost smile at the opponent but then
Ryan Bowen: stick around for just two or three seconds too long and all of a sudden the hand the balance of hand changes because there's something in the wrist rise all of a sudden starts to fade in in you even though you've got control and i think there is the risk again just that 67 kilo rise to me isn't it is such an anomaly that i feel like it's going to be enough of a factor that hermes is going to take it i i i respect lebanon as a as a technician as an experienced puller
Ryan Bowen: he we haven't had to see him really think too much because he's been so strong but i think hermes is a better puller like if we talk about technicalities i think hermes is better he's come from that lighter weight category dominance where he for 85 kilos 95 kilos we saw him be an absolute master technician i think that all that still lives within him very much so and i think he'll lead the dance i think hermes
Mindaugas: If the battle becomes even physically, Ermes will lead the dance technically. Do you guys realize that Lewon is in the chat? Lewon just wrote 6-0. Okay. Bye, Lewon. Please don't hurt me. Okay, I will ask you guys something. How do you pronounce C-I-R-E? C-I-R-E. I'd say Sire.
Mindaugas: Sire, yeah. Okay, then I don't want to disrespect anyone. Sire Brown Armlessing. Thank you for super chat. Levan60 Ermes. Ermes trained out his wrist weakness, which was beneficial against Levan. Okay, let me see if Levan wrote anything. Levan wrote something in Georgii, but I don't understand what he said.
Mindaugas: I'm going to do a pre-match interview. Yeah, it's a different alphabet, but it sounds like, tell that red-haired guy I'm trying to read. I'm joking. I can't wait to do the pre-match interview in Chicago. It's going to be terrible. Yeah, tell him I will see him in Chicago. That's what he said. Ryan is biased now.
Ryan Bowen: Yeah, I don't know. That one is riding. I like to, I'm a dreamer when it comes to being a fan of the sport. I love to dream of the impossible becoming possible. And I see for Levan, Levan's been the top a long time. He's got to defend against not one guy, but a whole bunch of guys chasing him. That's a hard task where Ermes has been obsessed with Levan since the last match. And it's an easier task to be chasing one guy than it is to defend against four or five. So I think
Ryan Bowen: The story of just being a fan of sport, the story's there for Ermes to have a really incredible, glorious moment. And yeah, I love dominant champions too, but I don't know. I can feel it coming.
Mindaugas: I want to see Ermes becoming a super hero world champion at some point, but I so much love Levan and I so much love Ermes. Even in my heart, I mean, even I told to Ermes today, I said, listen, I love you, but I love also Levan. Honestly, I don't have any fair square match and that's all I want. And Levan, one guy told to Levan,
Mindaugas: takes a whole truck with a tank full of oxygen to Chicago. And Levan says, I take all oxygen in Chicago. And he left, but he probably left
Mindaugas: probably to your I'm guessing to your okay that one says Ryan give me Australian oxygen he says it's very very good yeah yeah just bring it bring it yeah yeah bring it yeah yeah yeah yeah anyways guys so listen this we have been here for like one hour and 43 minutes I want to ask to be nervous and finish
Mindaugas: Devon vs. Lanetin in another program, because it is going to be past two hours. I can talk with you guys for five hours, but this guy over there has a kid and a family. He really needs to spend some time with the family as well. Yeah, let's go, Mindares. If anyone can beat Levan, it seems like Ermes is the right guy at the moment. His preparation is going well, everything is going well.
Mindaugas: I really want to see the match. I really want to see what happens. But just one funny thing I want to mention is that sometimes, let's say, if you improved your wrist, let's say, and maybe it will not collapse as easily as it collapsed last time. And then your arm opens. Yeah, it might even look like you lost easier and faster because, you know, when your wrist collapses, then suddenly Levan might have to change something, you know, maybe a bit of press to kind of finish that flop wrist, right?
Mindaugas: But if it doesn't collapse, if you kind of trying to maintain it more than maybe just goes to a path directly without any problems. So you are saying that sometimes giving up here will protect your arm power. Maybe you have to make that choice. That's how, what the case was when we go to elementary school. No, no, seriously, seriously with the guy, you could try to be, he goes like this and you go like, so who's winning. So I'm still saying level, you know, you can never go against the champ.
Mindaugas: You can never go against champ. You're talking about this specific category or you're talking about 77 kilos as well? You know, Levan will always be the favorite before he gets beaten. Okay, Levan wrote another comment. He said, Mingalgos, you're talking too much. Next match is I versus you. Let's go. Strongest ever versus the gods. Wow.
Mindaugas: yeah yeah anyways okay guys thank you very much i really enjoyed i really enjoyed and i want to go uh together if you want to join again mindagos you're more than welcome but i would like to do if they also uh want to continue we want to do a weekly thing with ryan and alan
Mindaugas: And yeah, since you are the least knowledgeable here, so we can use you, you know, only like time to time in diverse, like when we can't find the fourth person. The least knowledgeable, yeah. But yeah, I mean, I'm sure you will guys enjoy the podcast weekly, but, you know, maybe I will jump in from time to time. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Always fun, yeah.
Mindaugas: Thank you. Thank you. And thank you. And thanks to everyone who has been watching us. You all take care. Yeah. Show us your bicep. I want to feel good. OK, that's good. And listen, by the way, the forearm is telling you. Yeah. I mean, I don't know how my mind is looking, but I'm scaring and that's looking scary.
Mindaugas: No, it is really small. Like right now is, what is that, 37 centimeters? And warm, I have seen 40. My forearm somehow really changes when I train, like up to three centimeters, if I do table. But this used to be 43, warm. So when it is 41, even 41, that will be enough for some skinny guy, but right now it's not.
