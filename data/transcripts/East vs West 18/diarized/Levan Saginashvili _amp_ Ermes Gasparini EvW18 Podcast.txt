Engin Terzi: Hello, hello, hello, everyone. I'm still in Romania for the European Championships. First five days of the event today finished. And so youth categories, junior categories, right, left, and the masters, and last two days were power arm wrestling disabled categories. And I'm in Romania for the European Championships.
Engin Terzi: I need to share the link now, and the guys will join me very soon. And so I'm in a hotel room. I apologize. This is the best quiet place I could find, and thanks for understanding. So let me share this until the big boys, they join.
Engin Terzi: Okay, I think the first guy just joined. Levan Levan Saginashvili. Hello, Wako. Hello, Levan. Great to see you guys. Likewise, Engin. Let me see. Oh, it says Wako. Let me change it. We are live now, and I think the other one came. Okay. Hello, Ermes.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, I'm happy that you guys solved all the problems. And now, whenever the podcast starts, you guys do like that one. You guys are doing like this, happy, and people will think that there was no problem, so they will blame me. So, let's be honest, there was a problem, but everything is solved. It's your fault, Engin. My fault?
Engin Terzi: Listen, listen, as long as you guys are peaceful, let it be my fault. It's okay. And Ermes, can you make your phone sideways? Please. So that was my fault, huh? Okay.
Engin Terzi: So, I now share this and then as soon as I share... Okay, now I'm sharing. So, how is everything Levan? How are you? Good, good. Good? Fit. Very fit. Like a bodybuilder. You are like a bodybuilder now?
Engin Terzi: Okay. What did you say, Levan? Men's physique. Oh, you are in men's physique. Okay. Can you get up and we can see you? Is your connection is bad, Ermes? Is Levan's connection is bad or my connection? Levan, Levan. Levan. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: Levan, okay, now your connection is better. A while ago you were like frozen. So what is your weight? You said you are in men's physique. What was your weight? 175. 75. And last time you pulled Ermes was 190? Yeah. 88. 88. When I go... To the venue. Yeah, to the venue.
Levan Saginashvili: I've been in Georgii 182, 192. Oh, then you get ill? I tried some low weight but... So basically Levan, now, last time,
Levan Saginashvili: Why are you laughing? Athlete. Can you get up? Can you get up? Can I see you, please? Let go a little. Oh, yeah. Somebody's in trouble. Too small, my friend. Too small. No, no. Too small? Small. I'm looking bigger, but I'm more light. Lightweight, but looking bigger.
Engin Terzi: You lost only fat and only quality muscle left, right? I lost only one nervous. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey, listen guys, this is one of the most important
Engin Terzi: OK, who is this guy I just joined? Oh, Tornike came. I was like, I didn't give the link to anyone else. Hello, Tornike. How are you, my friend? Hi, everyone. I'm doing good. Thank you. Give me my secret weapon.
Engin Terzi: Levan, Levan, Levan, listen. Whenever you can, please join with English, okay? Because people love to hear directly from you. But whenever you go deep analyzing some technical, and Tornike is incredible anyways, but people also want to hear from you.
Engin Terzi: So, Ermes, okay, listen. You guys just recently made peace. I'm very, very happy. This is the secret weapon. Oh, zero sugar. Okay. Bring this, my friend. Secret weapon to be strong. It is not working to zero sugar. Original. Portuality, my friend. Levan, Levan, okay, I have a question for you.
Engin Terzi: You and I, we are from similar cultures, and you and I, we have some borders about the words that are used, but personal. But other than that, you know, Ermes went like, and he said, you have this excuse, this excuse, this excuse. Did that part also bother you?
Engin Terzi: Which part? Name calling, name calling, I understand, you don't like it. But about the... Ermes says that you had first oxygen problem and the weight problem and now he says that you needed a sugar drink or something. This also make you angry or like not at all? No, no, because it is true.
Engin Terzi: Oh, it is true. OK. No. Listen, when you say it is true, it is true from your side or it is true that Ermes says these are all excuses? I don't know what the problem is. I don't know what the problem is.
Engin Terzi: Well, those were the actual problems, so here we are. Okay, so they were actual problems. And Ermes, if, so Ermes, you share those things, you make a video, is that because you think it's not real? I think the problem is it was because nobody did the cardio.
Ermes Gasparini: and without cardio if you have a long match is very hard and if you if your weight is almost 190 kilo you don't and you don't did any cardio if if you have a long match is very difficult to to have enough oxygen okay i don't remember
Levan Saginashvili: The main problem I had was that I underestimated Ermes. But now I fully understand my opponent and I'm fully prepared.
Engin Terzi: Okay, then Ermes, now you talk like you have understanding about Levan, but whenever you make video, you get upset. You have these excuses, these excuses. So, what is bothering you exactly? Just let's talk. I said about underestimated me, I said it can be true, because if I see his partner,
Ermes Gasparini: before his match I fought with Jeffy and I had a hard fight and when he fought with Jeffy he won very easily and yes and after you are unbeatable you don't have any loss from 6-7 years
Ermes Gasparini: this I understand ok, which part you don't understand? tell us that part I don't understand about oxygen I think the problem was only because usually armwrestlers don't do cardio and that's why it's very difficult when you have a long match
Levan Saginashvili: Well, sorry, Ermes. In the last year or so, I think, Laleddin has had a lot of opportunities. Our game was a bit different. In my opinion, it was a bad game. It was a bad game. Gamowy and Bodyshiv were playing against each other. It was a bad game.
Levan Saginashvili: The problem was that it was real. Martomia didn't have this problem. Ermes didn't have this problem either. I don't know if it's true or not, but Ermes wanted to make it real. Our brother Claudio, if you haven't heard of him, he was a real satanist. He wanted to make it real. That's our brother.
Levan Saginashvili: I have to clarify that this was the venue where many armwrestlers had troubles. Ford example, Vitaly Laletin had to be taken out with an ambulance. On the same day, Badulescu, sorry, and was picking to the side and he was not feeling well. And Ermes was not feeling well during the match as well.
Engin Terzi: Overall, yeah, I agree. We could have prepared better and trained the cardio part, but the venue was tough as well. OK. Ermes, I understand that, like, you don't want to start anything, but that is not what, right now, every time... No, stop it! Come on.
Engin Terzi: What's that? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. We need to clear this. Whenever you go to your YouTube channel, you say, hey, you do this, you do this. No, no, one moment. No, I'm just asking what upsets you. You don't talk about that. Just say it. Say it so that we will fix this problem. I don't want this problem to happen every year. You know? No, no, no. OK, let me talk. Let me talk. You are upset. No, no, no. One second.
Engin Terzi: What's that? I like fighting first with Ermes and then being friends. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Ermes, so just say openly, you are upset that Levan doesn't give you the credit that you deserve, correct? Yeah, if I have a hard fight with some opponent,
Ermes Gasparini: I like an athlete with a man. I can tell, yes, it was a hard fight. It was a very strong opponent. This is what I think.
Levan Saginashvili: So you are saying that he should stay?
Levan Saginashvili: Every time I mention the match, I always say that Ermes was stronger than I expected.
Levan Saginashvili: Of course, there is a reason for oxygen and everything else, but Ermes being strong was what resulted into that, so I would say that. My opinion is that when you were going to arm wrestle against Devon, and Devon was the one that really...
Engin Terzi: uh scratching that you know or I think that Ermes usually normally would win you know if there was a running foul and this so I I think you you had to say this to Devon to answer that you know like you had that hard time because I think Devon was saying that uh he beat Ermes easier than you beat Ermes so then you were just saying
Engin Terzi: because of this reason, this reason, and this reason. No, I never assumed that. Because I remember all this started when you had a podcast before Devilmatch.
Engin Terzi: And Devon was teasing you. He was saying that, oh, Ermes actually, you know, beat you. It was a run and foul. And then it was the time that you said all these things. Oh, I didn't prepare good. I was heavy. It was in that podcast. And then next day, Ermes made a video that he said that, you know, like,
Engin Terzi: like crybaby or something, and then you get angry and you call me. I don't want to go into details, but I think that that was how it started. But now, okay, we have Chicago event. In my opinion, it is one of the biggest, biggest and most important matches in the history, because armwrestling has never been at this level. And you are the strongest armwrestler who has ever lived, for sure for right arm.
Engin Terzi: Everyone accepts this. And this guy is the one that gave you the hardest match. You accept that way or no, I don't know. And now he's coming again. And if you lost 15 kilo, Levan, it just means that maybe it was not the only venue problem.
Engin Terzi: Maybe even if it's a good air conditioner in Chicago, you felt like you need to lose weight, so you didn't want to experience the same problem.
Levan Saginashvili: Yes, it's true. I lost 15 kilos. I lost 15 kilos because I had a problem with my stomach and everything else. Now, I can say with confidence that I'm in a good position. I'm in a good shape. I'm in a good shape. I'm in a good shape. I'm in a good shape. I'm in a good shape. I'm in a good shape. I'm in a good shape. I'm in a good shape. I'm in a good shape. I'm in a good shape. I'm in a good shape. I'm in a good shape. I'm in a good shape. I'm in a good shape. I'm in a good shape. I'm in a good shape. I'm in a good shape. I'm in a good shape. I'm in a good shape. I'm in a good shape. I'm in a good shape. I'm in a good shape. I'm in a good shape. I'm in a good shape. I'm in a good shape. I'm in a good shape.
Levan Saginashvili: Yeah, of course, being 190, of course, I had troubles. Would that be with the conditioning or oxygen? That's the lesson that I learned. And as any professional, I have to learn my mistakes. And being that weight, of course, I would have some troubles. And what was your weight against Jerry? My? No, no.
Levan Saginashvili: I don't remember exactly, before the flight I was 180 kg, during the match probably 178.
Engin Terzi: Ok, so this is a standard thing that after that match you try to be under 180 kg every match. So this is not a lesson only for Ermes match. So you do this for almost every match? Yes, yes. In the match, yes. But I am not comfortable with 180 kg.
Levan Saginashvili: I think it's important to have a lot of professional people involved in your work, whether it's a lawyer, a lawyer, a lawyer, a lawyer, a lawyer, a lawyer, a lawyer, a lawyer, a lawyer, a lawyer, a lawyer, a lawyer, a lawyer, a lawyer, a lawyer, a lawyer, a lawyer, a lawyer, a lawyer, a lawyer, a lawyer, a lawyer, a lawyer, a lawyer, a lawyer, a lawyer, a lawyer, a lawyer, a lawyer, a lawyer, a lawyer, a lawyer, a lawyer, a lawyer, a lawyer, a lawyer, a lawyer, a lawyer, a lawyer, a lawyer, a lawyer, a lawyer, a lawyer, a lawyer, a lawyer, a lawyer, a lawyer, a lawyer, a lawyer, a lawyer, a lawyer, a lawyer, a lawyer, a lawyer, a lawyer, a lawyer, a lawyer, a lawyer, a lawyer, a lawyer, a lawyer, a lawyer, a lawyer, a lawyer, a lawyer, a lawyer, a lawyer, a lawyer,
Levan Saginashvili: And I think that everything was in the right conditions. Sometimes it was good, sometimes it wasn't. Because during this period, I had a problem with my car. My car broke down and I had to fix it.
Levan Saginashvili: Of course, being above 180 is not comfortable to me, but I have learned my lesson and during this preparation I was much more professional. I considered my nutrition, the cardio, everything was in a top-notch condition.
Levan Saginashvili: Even during the jerrymatch, my preparation was not the best. Allen my friends and relatives know that I was focusing on my car and fixing it and training was also done in parallel. But now I'm fully preparing and being in my best shape. And Armas?
Ermes Gasparini: I love too much to hear these things. What's that? I love too much to hear these things. He's in the best shape. Because after I will win, he don't have any excuse. Levan, you will not have any excuse after Ermes beats you?
Levan Saginashvili: He is shocked. He is shocked, he doesn't know what to say.
Levan Saginashvili: It's crazy to hear. It's like Ermes could have said that he believes in aliens and they will come to the earth and attack us all. Some fantasy.
Engin Terzi: Allen exist is true, my friend. They exist? Yeah, alien exist. Okay, Levan said that, I told you, right? What did Levan say? Did Levan say, I told you? Yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah, yeah, I thought so, yeah.
Engin Terzi: So, Levan, do you think... I mean, I haven't seen one, so I believe in some spirits. I don't know if they are the same thing or not.
Engin Terzi: But aliens, I don't know, not the ones that they show with the long neck like E.T. You guys remember E.T.? Actually, Ermes looks like E.T. Ermes is E.G. Ermes Gasparini. I'm the one E.T.
Engin Terzi: Or maybe Jablonski looks like Ichi. Okay, there is a super chat. GB19 says, will you guys pull all six rounds or four? Or Oxygen? Oxygen.
Levan Saginashvili: So once it's 4-0, I will take the oxygen mask and pull the rest two rounds with that. Why is that? I just want it. Okay. Okay. So it sounds like, you know, Levan didn't fix his oxygen problem.
Levan Saginashvili: I just like the visual of the mask. Like a diver I will have a tank on my back.
Levan Saginashvili: But Levan, last time you didn't tell me this. Last time you said, after 4-0, Ermes will run and Irakli will run and catch him and bring it to the table. No, that's not it. That's not my version. Bob Savmach's version. I'll tell you what I think. What I think is that there is only one version, that Gasparini Lingarbi and Irakli will play against each other.
Levan Saginashvili: The second version is that Gasparini is from Argarb, and Gasparini's son is Larratt, and Larratt and Gasparini live in the same village. And the third version is that there are 5-6 villages in Argarb, and all of them belong to Yuljus and Maximus.
Levan Saginashvili: Yeah, there are several.
Levan Saginashvili: Yeah, there are several ways this match can continue after 4-0. One scenario is, yeah, here, Ermes runs away. Irakli has to catch him and bring him back. Second scenario is, Devon joins in. They try to pull me together, but I still beat them. Third scenario is, Ermes fights to 6-0 and he falls like Maximus. And if you remember the scene from the movie, when he goes through the field,
Engin Terzi: touching the grass and something like that happens. I will pull all the rounds. Allen six rounds you guys pull, right? Okay, sure. Because there is some criticism from Levan to you that you quit after 3-0 against Devon. Ford me, one good thing
Ermes Gasparini: The first time I broke his record. What do you mean? He said he wanted to end his career without a zero loss, zero match. Round, round. And the next time I broke another thing. The victories. Okay, I understand. You are saying that he had two main goals. One?
Engin Terzi: Yes, he can lose one time. My friend, you can lose one time, no problem. If you lose one time, it will change.
Engin Terzi: So Ermes hopes that I go to US, I become ill or incapable, and he wins that way, right? That's his only hope. What? He says that there is only one way for you to win, is that only if he gets very ill. And he's thinking that... Oh, with Coca-Cola. Coca-Cola has caffeine inside.
Ermes Gasparini: He will help him? Caffeine, caffeine. He hopes that, I don't know, maybe a car hits me or something happens. So that's his only hope. Is it true that you hire someone to hit Levan with a car in Chicago? I will give the malediction, you know.
Ermes Gasparini: No, I don't need these things, my friend. I think, I think, I think many athletes underestimate me about the day-one match. Michael told me, he said he wanted to do this, because the day-one match was really a bad day for me.
Ermes Gasparini: but I don't this is what happened I don't want to make any excuse I lost but if the people my next opponents they compare they see this match and they see
Engin Terzi: they put my label about for this match they are doing very big mistake super big mistake to be honest Ermes you prepared for many months for Jerry and you prepared for supination side pressure and then Devon match happened Devon was gonna pull Gennady and Gennady tore his bicep when Gennady tore his bicep it was only four weeks you pull Jerry one week you didn't train
Engin Terzi: in the last two weeks before Devon match you didn't train so I think you had only one match so I'm not saying Devon couldn't beat you but you did you did not you did not prepare especially yeah but Devon told the same things he said the same things
Ermes Gasparini: but we will fix in the future these things for sure but if the people compare some people you can't beat Devon because how we want to beat Levan they are doing very big mistake but about this I learned a lot about my wrist, my pronation and I think I don't
Ermes Gasparini: say now I have the hand pronation stronger than Levan, but for sure, for sure he will feel a lot of difference. Ermes, Ermes, is your arm stronger than Levan's? Is your back pressure stronger than Levan's? Let me stir the pot a little bit. My friend, my weight is fake, it's nothing true.
Ermes Gasparini: Yeah, yeah. So you finally accepted? Only 40 kilos. 40 kilos I did maximum. How many kilos? I put 92, but it's 40. 40 kilos. See, Levan, you were right about it. Sorry, Levan, I doubted what you said. And what do you think about Levan's 180 kilos? The weight is impressive, but not comparable to his body weight.
Ermes Gasparini: Ford me, really, it's more impressive to see, like Irakli, his weight is 95, he's doing 130 kilos, many reps, for myself. I don't criticize his very big performance, for sure. But if it was 180 kilos on the wall, this changed a lot. He never tried it on the wall.
Ermes Gasparini: And how many kilos do you think he can do on the wall? 110 or more. How much is your bench press, Ermes? With the plastic weight, 50 kilos.
Engin Terzi: 160 kilo? 50, 50. 50 kilo with the plastic weights, okay. Real weights? 70. Okay, Dino has a super chat. He says, well, hello, quality Ermes will be champion. He says Ermes will be champion and...
Ermes Gasparini: top role for Sumar says like if you are here for Ermes. Levan, do you think that like more people are supporting you internationally or supporting Ermes? I don't know. My friend, people are tired to see him win every time. He need to lose or one time. It's like, you know, you went to, you went to win every time. The people will hate it.
Ermes Gasparini: We need to change the story. It's more beautiful for the sport to see a new champion. I'm like a dictator. Until I'm dead, I'm not going anywhere. Yeah, I remember when Levan and Devon was playing for the first time.
Engin Terzi: Somebody asked me, Engin, what is better for the sport, if Devon wins or Levan wins? He probably wanted me to say Devon because he is more popular. And I said, whoever deserves to win is better for the sport. And I still think the same way. I know many people want a new champion, but my mind works.
Engin Terzi: Yeah. And they're asking your weight, Ermes. 28, 29. And one more question. They're asking, can you ask Ermes if he thinks he will win the table center with the first rounds? I don't know. Everything can happen. Just tell...
Engin Terzi: us like how you really feel I know you don't want to look weak you don't want to talk too big but my guess is that you you believe that like center is very hard but you plan to stop him like halfway or something yeah something like that I said in many interviews last time my wrist
Ermes Gasparini: he he he opened my wrist totally immediately but my arm power he i holded him with my arm and i think if my wrist is stronger for sure and i think i think i can hold better than last time and these these things will help a lot my arm power and
Engin Terzi: Yes. I have a question for you, Devon. Just tell us, like, do you feel like, oh, June 21st, just come quickly, you know, just let me destroy that guy, you know, like, do you feel that way?
Levan Saginashvili: Well, first of all, I would like to thank you very much for the opportunity to speak with you.
Levan Saginashvili: The emotions of that day are still there. I think it's a good match. I don't think it's a bad match. I think it's a good match. I think it's a good match.
Levan Saginashvili: I don't know if I will be able to attend the next session, but I will try to attend it, because I don't think I will be able to do anything else.
Levan Saginashvili: Well, to be honest, I'm really hungry, hungry to pull for a victory. I have to be honest, with all due respect to Jerry, I didn't feel the resistance that I wanted. So I still miss the fight. Most probably this match will go as easily as it went with Jerry.
Levan Saginashvili: and after the match I will have to fly to Italy and maybe we can film some content together for YouTube where I can teach him and maybe we can make fans a bit more happy that way because the match itself might be a bit one-sided. He said it will be more easily. He said it will be as easy as a jury match, that's what he says.
Ermes Gasparini: I can't wait, really, I can't wait to pull, I can't wait to see again the face of his fans, of his friends in the corner, I can't wait. You can't wait that worry that they had on round 5?
Engin Terzi: What? You can't wait to see the same face that his corner had round 5 in Dubai. Yeah, round 3, round 3, 4. Round 3 as well? Okay. Uh-huh. Yeah. I don't understand why he said this. Why? He believes? He's just... Yeah, I think he believes. He believes.
Ermes Gasparini: But to say he will not feel nothing, he is doing a very big mistake, for sure. Ford sure. Too much. Levan, Levan. Round three. I don't think, I don't think after our match, for sure he's improved, but not like me.
Ermes Gasparini: Impossible. And maybe he improved maybe 10% or something like that, 5%. But me, for sure, almost 20%, I think. One rap with 92, I did 16 raps. Something different it is.
Ermes Gasparini: Riser, I started with the A1 with 45, now 67. You're talking about 92 kilo back pressure? Yeah. A11, was it back pressure? That's how, how earnest it is? Yeah, I did this, this. But look. This, with elbow like this. Not this, I'm not going to talk about the calves.
Ermes Gasparini: Really, I'm happy to see his confidence. But I don't understand, really. But okay, I accept this. What can I say? Okay, one more question. If you knew
Engin Terzi: Like round three, you said that before round three, you saw that Irakli, he was laughing like he was making fun. Before round three. And you said that that's why you get angry and you did your all.
Engin Terzi: and then you stop him but do you think you made a mistake that round 3 when Levan get foul, wrist starts instead of back pressure and this, you directly went there and Levan just flashed you yeah my friend, you think you can beat me without straps if you don't run away, yeah sure
Ermes Gasparini: Yeah, no, no, I don't run away. I will pull slowly and you too. You need to hold me and to block me. You can do this with me.
Ermes Gasparini: Translate it. I'm going to hit so hard that I might just rip your arm off. I will hit so hard I might just rip your arm off. No, no, no. Now you change. Please hold me. Or maybe here. Hold me from here, please. Like a devil. Ermes. You said he's changing. He didn't change. You said he can beat you without a strap or not.
Ermes Gasparini: No, no, I said if he can hold me and block me on the center. No, I mean the first thing you said that like if he can beat you without the strap or not. So he's saying that he's gonna hold you and he will grip your arm. You can stay like this. Okay. Please, my friend, every round. You can stay like this. Every round without straps. Two hands. Yeah. No, no, take me here. No, you can stay like this.
Ermes Gasparini: No, no, no. Two hands. Here, please. Take me here. Every round block me and go. Without strap, we can finish the match very quickly. And you will win like a super mega champion. Levan, do you realize what he is trying to do? Do you understand what he is trying to do?
Engin Terzi: Yeah, some child's play, this is not serious. Baba, no, no, it's very serious. Not too much, serious. Remember, my friend. Remember, Rewan, round three, you didn't sleep. You wanted to hold him without the strap, you know, and... So you're telling me to go to the pool now? How many people do you need to be to...
Levan Saginashvili: Continue, continue. So now you're telling me... Tornike, we don't hear you. Tornike? So now you're telling me how to speak? When you want to be a champion and you start to speak that way, that's really, really... I'm really sorry for you. Devon't understand.
Ermes Gasparini: He basically says that since you want to be a champion, that's not the way to speak of telling me how to pull and how to get the match going. No, my friend, he said he wanted to clarify everything, to not have any doubts about me and him. If he wants to do this, he can hold me, block me and go slowly.
Ermes Gasparini: You know, this is the best way you can crush one guy. If I need to be crushed like this, I feel too bad. And you are completely without doubts about matches or fights. If you have a big fight and you block it from the center, it will affect everyone.
Ermes Gasparini: So if I win any other way, you think there will be doubts? No, no, no. I suggest only this. No, no. He's saying that if he beats you in a different way. He can do whatever he wants. What if I beat you like Devon did? How? Like first round?
Ermes Gasparini: Yeah, we all saw how Devon stopped him in the middle and then won. Yeah, almost. Almost won. Ah, he said he will win like very fast. Explain, explain, talk my friend. We don't understand.
Engin Terzi: You seem too scared. I'm losing my motivation. But Ermes, Ermes, seriously, whenever you're telling him to beat you in the way that you want, it really sounds a little bit that way.
Ermes Gasparini: You just need to tell him, just do whatever you want, you know. I'm ready. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure. Yeah, for sure. But when for me, I say, when for me, I wanted to crush some guy, you know what you need to do? To hold in the center, to see in the side and to crush him.
Engin Terzi: No, but Ermes, the reason that you are saying all these things, you and I, we both know that you want to make him tired. No, no. No, no. Yes, yes. And listen, that's a good strategy. But from outside it looks not good.
Levan Saginashvili: I remember something like that when we had in our first match. I stopped him in the middle and then beat him. Take a round. Yep. Yeah, there's a super chat. Tyson Bull says give Levan oxygenated cola.
Engin Terzi: And one guy says, why is the conversation whether or not you can hold him at 25% mark? If you were the better armwrestler, wouldn't you be holding him at the 25% mark? I think that the reality about Levan being a super strong guy is just making conversation come there, you know? Like Levan is always the attacker and the opponents are always trying to stop.
Engin Terzi: and the way that Ermes... Hey, Lewa, did this guy beat you one round or not? I know you answered this before, but I want to look at him and then say this. Ermes, did you beat him one round or not? We've got one Ermes now. So it was much... When? Where? How was that a victory? Ermes? Hm?
Engin Terzi: he know very well, he know very well you said you finish his one dream about no round loss and you said you gonna finish his second dream he quit, he quit he quit? yes Levan?
Ermes Gasparini: I don't know, Moghebuli. Who had the fission mask? Me or him? Who had the fission mask? Ambulance, ambulance, friends, water on the face. Who had this? Me or him? What score? What score? What score, he's asking. What was the score? You quit it. OK, he's asking what was the score according to you. And the referee came to him.
Ermes Gasparini: and they said what do you want to do give give the rounds he said what was the score at the time he agreed with the referee for true but this is true he there are there is the video huh there is the video what was the score at the real score at the time he's implying the 4-0
Engin Terzi: What was the score at that time?
Ermes Gasparini: He's asking you, what was the score when the match stopped? So when the match stopped, it was 4-0. But Ermes is saying that there is a video. But the video today, the match, it was not finished yet. The match, it was not finished yet because he made a foul. He made a foul to don't lose. He made a foul to don't lose three times. And after, oxygen mask, ambulance,
Ermes Gasparini: water my face, and he said, no, no, no, no, I don't want to continue, 4-2 is OK. Is that 4-2 is OK? Yeah, he said this with the referee. Levan, did you say that to the referee that it's OK to give him the two rounds? Yeah. Oh, you said OK.
Ermes Gasparini: This is what happened, I don't know. I don't know. If he wants to say he's 4-0, he's 4-0. But the reality, it was what I explained before. But one time Levan also told me that you also didn't come to the table. Because he was with Oxygen, how can I come with someone... So you were ready? You were like ready?
Ermes Gasparini: Not ready, but if he would come on the table, I can continue the match. OK, so the only reason you didn't go to the table because Levan said he cannot continue? Yeah. OK. The referee come to me and he said Levan can't continue. I was really in bad time. When I said that when I'm not continuing, what was the score at that time?
Ermes Gasparini: My friend, the problem is one, because he maybe don't understand. When you start one match, you can't retire and then go to home. You need to finish the match. You mean the rounds? The rounds, yes, the rounds. Or not? I don't know, Igor. I'm a small guy as much. So you won the match? He said, again,
Ermes Gasparini: with the mask, I can't continue, he said to the referee, 4-2 is okay, that's it. So you won the match?
Engin Terzi: What if you told me, yes? Todd the referee, yes? No, no, no, Ermes, he is asking you won the match. I don't opinionate him. No, no, no, no, no, no. He's not asking you won the match. No, you didn't win the match. You didn't win the match. But you are saying you win the round. Round five you won. This is what you are saying. I don't won the match. No, no, no. He is asking you won the match. You didn't win the match, you know. But you are saying that you won the fifth round. This is what you are saying. Yes.
Ermes Gasparini: He is saying a different way for his part, but I understand what he means. I understand what he means. We were 4-0, my friend, for sure. We were 4-0, for sure. But we started the fifth match, if you remember. Fifth round. Fifth round.
Ermes Gasparini: Yeah, he's just crazy. He's just crazy now. But you remember or your memory is crashed? Yeah, yeah, I remember. You won, yes. Sorry, Prince Levan. Sorry, my friend. Sorry, Prince Levan. Sorry. I will talk better things. Sorry.
Ermes Gasparini: I don't care, I don't care too much this. I only say that he quit this time and that's it, what I can do. And Ermes, are you going to beat him in Chicago? I will do my best, I feel very good to this. The next day, you will wake up as world number... I feel very... I don't want to tell too much because sometimes when you tell too much it's not good for the lucky.
Ermes Gasparini: But I feel something good inside. He said we don't feel nothing. We will see. We will see. We will see if we don't feel nothing. If he will beat me like nothing, oh, OK, congratulations. And that's it. Do you believe that? I don't believe. Zero. This is impossible.
Ermes Gasparini: So there will be a tough match? There will be a good match? Yeah, I think it will be a good match. And Ermes, do you believe that if the match is good, do you believe your chance is higher or his chance is higher? My chance is higher. Because I think from his part, he doesn't have too much experience in the last period to have a long match.
Ermes Gasparini: So he's not ready for a long match, that's what you're saying? Ford the mind, yes. He's not have too much spirit. He won every time very easily. And for my opinion, yes. Levan, I know you get upset right now about the fifth round thing, but... My friend, you won 4-0. You are happy now. You won 4-0. You won all the matches.
Ermes Gasparini: I don't care. I don't care. I don't care too much. You are unbeatable. You are the king. You are just crazy now. You are going insane. Ford what? Ford what?
Levan Saginashvili: Some indecent words of destroying him. Your mind is going crazy now. Ford what? Why? Why?
Ermes Gasparini: You have to decrease your doses because you're going crazy. He needs to decrease what? You talk about doses to me, my friend. You gain 100 kilos and you talk about doses to me? Let's not go there. Yeah, exactly.
Engin Terzi: Okay, there is a super chat. Trip War says, can they promise now, live, that they will pull full six rounds, whatever the score is. Ford us, the fans, at least, love them both. Great sport, man. East versus West is the best. Do you promise six rounds? Do you guys promise? Yeah, for me, okay. Okay. Okay.
Ermes Gasparini: Again, I repeat last time. I say only the reality. What happened last month. Only this. If we think it was 4-0, it was 21. Engin, do you believe that Ermes won? Those rounders will respond to match?
Ermes Gasparini: Listen, do you need to involve me, Levan? Okay, what's that? No, I will get your... No, no engagement, no. No, I said no involvement. Tornik, my friend, ask to Levan if it's true or not. If he said to the referee, okay, give the rounds, no problem.
Ermes Gasparini: Martalia, you said that after this match, it will be the second round. Yes, I said that in the first two rounds. So what? What did those two rounds change? What? I mean, he says that those two rounds didn't change anything. No, that's true. He won the fight. Why are we complaining too much about this? He won the match, that's it.
Ermes Gasparini: Ford me, it's not for me, for myself, it was more like I was more happy to have a very hard match with him. What's happened again about me? Translate it to Levan.
Ermes Gasparini: Why aren't you sharing your opinion, Engin? Devon't you know? Listen, if I share my opinion, either Ermes or you will be upset. No, no, me, I'm not like him, my friend. I don't like
Levan Saginashvili: I don't care like him. I don't care. I can share my opinion. If both athletes promise that they will not get upset. I can share. You pull Engin and Ermes. What was that? He said...
Engin Terzi: If I lost, then you, Engin, can pull Ermes, since I'm not the champion. No, nobody says that you lost, my friend. You won the Supermatch. You're talking about Round 5. You won the match. Nobody doubts that. You won. Why, why, why? We talked about the one round. We talked about Levan, come on. Why are you getting angry, Levan? Me, I don't understand. He don't understand. I say that, I say that, Tornik, please translate.
Ermes Gasparini: I was happy to have a hard fight with him, to be the first to have a hard fight with him. Only this.
Levan Saginashvili: After two rounds you don't change the result. He won the fight. He still won the fight. I never say something different.
Engin Terzi: yeah he doesn't he says that it doesn't make sense you said that uh you won and uh no no he's talking about the one round he doesn't talk to supermatch nobody says Levan Levan Saginashvili, Levan Levan Saginashvili beat Ermes Gasparini no doubt we talk about only the fifth round
Engin Terzi: nobody's even if it was one win or no still it would be 4-1 or 4-0 there is no difference so Levan thinks that we are talking about if he won the supermatch or not can you explain that that's not the what we are talking about
Engin Terzi: Okay. Translate it, Tornik. Tornik, Levan thinks that we think that he didn't win the supermatch? He says that it doesn't make sense because you said it in a different way previously. No, I didn't say it in a different way. We talked about one round. I thought he asked us
Levan Saginashvili: my opinion about the round five. I didn't ask her for the supermatch.
Engin Terzi: Levan was asking about the match. Match he won, match he won, nobody listens. Why, why, why? Ermes, Ermes, one second. Ermes, Ermes, one second. My friend, Tornike, this is important. I didn't think that way because I, why would I expect a question from Levan about who won the supermatch while the whole world knows that Levan won the supermatch. I thought he was asking about round five.
Engin Terzi: About the supermatch, I don't think there is anybody on this earth that have any doubts. Ermes himself says he won. Devon Levan Saginashvili, he won the supermatch. I don't know about the match, but I know how you know about the round. The round is... I don't know. I don't know about the match, but I know how you know about the round. The round is... I don't know about the match, but I know how you know about the round. The round is... I don't know about the match, but I know how you know about the round. The round is... I don't know about the match, but I know how you know about the round. The round is... I don't know about the match, but I know how you know about the round. The round is... I don't know about the match, but I know how you know about the round. The round is... I don't know about the match, but I know how you know about the round. The round is...
Levan Saginashvili: Should we be afraid? Should we not be afraid? This is what I am trying to say. I am trying to say that if you are afraid, you should not be afraid.
Engin Terzi: so that's what i'm asking is that what does those two rounds change those two rounds do you know what it changed it changed that hermes thinks that he has the honor of defeating him one round hermes thinks that he has the honor that he's the only person that ever won one round against that one this is what they are
Levan Saginashvili: Miscommunication.
Engin Terzi: yeah yeah of course it's miscommunication because like i would never expect Levan to ask such question like everyone knows that he won like why would i say that anything else he said the words did i win and that's what i translated but i thought that he was talking about who won the round five yeah now what is he saying
Levan Saginashvili: I would like to thank you for the second round. I would like to thank you for the second round. I would like to thank you for the second round. I would like to thank you for the second round. I would like to thank you for the second round. I would like to thank you for the second round. I would like to thank you for the second round. I would like to thank you for the second round.
Levan Saginashvili: Yes, Khurushian is not here. He is not here. He is not here. He is not here. He is not here. He is not here. He is not here. He is not here. He is not here. He is not here. He is not here. He is not here. He is not here. He is not here. He is not here. He is not here. He is not here. He is not here. He is not here. He is not here. He is not here. He is not here. He is not here. He is not here. He is not here. He is not here. He is not here. He is not here. He is not here. He is not here. He is not here. He is not here. He is not here. He is not here. He is not here. He is not here. He is not here. He is not here. He is not here. He is not here. He is not here. He is not here. He is not here. He is not here
Levan Saginashvili: Uh,
Levan Saginashvili: That's why I'm saying that those two rounds didn't matter. Since the one, those rounds, it can be 4-0, it can be 6-0, whatever the score is, those rounds don't matter. Now it's a very common thing if we have best out of five.
Levan Saginashvili: the match finishes at three if it's best out of seven the match finishes at four and nobody's saying why didn't you pull those last rounds so why why is it me that i have to pull this extra rounds i didn't feel well and i didn't care about those that's why i stopped the match yeah one moment
Ermes Gasparini: Before my match, he said he competed all six rounds every time because he said he wanted to win all the rounds. And that's why we competed all the six rounds. Translate, please. He said he wanted to win all the six rounds because he said he wanted to win all the six rounds.
Levan Saginashvili: I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
Levan Saginashvili: Organizatory.
Levan Saginashvili: I'm
Levan Saginashvili: Yes, I have said before that I wanted to pull all the six rounds, but why should I risk it if I'm not feeling well? There is no point in continuing since I have won. And once the referee came and asked what to do, should I do 4-2? I said, whatever you want to do. That didn't matter to me.
Levan Saginashvili: they could have done whatever they wanted. And also I saw that Ermes was extremely unwell as well. His helpers were helping him out with the towel and everything. So I took the responsibility on myself and said, do whatever you want and just stop the match because I didn't care at that point. And there is no point in risking continuing the match from there.
Ermes Gasparini: One moment, one moment. This is the perfect what I think. Same lane, same things. I said only this. And like when I fought with Gennady, when I won 4-2.
Ermes Gasparini: nobody care they lost two matches with Gennady won but you care that you think that you will win one round against Levan one moment please one moment but with Levan is different because if someone can hold him more to almost win one round
Ermes Gasparini: It's not important like the first four rounds, but almost win one round in the fifth round. There are more rumors about this. Translate, please. Maybe we can... I think it's a big thing. It's a big deal. It's a big deal. It's a big deal. It's a big deal. It's a big deal. It's a big deal. It's a big deal. It's a big deal. It's a big deal. It's a big deal. It's a big deal. It's a big deal. It's a big deal. It's a big deal. It's a big deal. It's a big deal. It's a big deal. It's a big deal. It's a big deal. It's a big deal. It's a big deal. It's a big deal. It's a big deal. It's a big deal. It's a big deal. It's a big deal. It's a big deal. It's a big deal. It's a big deal. It's a big
Levan Saginashvili: It was a big surprise for me. How was it? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
Levan Saginashvili: Levan thought that you were talking about winning the match? Never, never in my life. Nobody on this earth thinks that way. I mean, honest people are like, they don't know. The teammate was understanding about it.
Ermes Gasparini: They never say they want the match. Never in my life. Translate, please. Tony, translate, please. Now you can tell me, sorry, my friend.
Engin Terzi: sorry after after i beat you i will tell you that how about me you don't have to compete with me do you really believe that i thought that you lost that match come on man come on
Engin Terzi: Yeah, that's what I wanted to ask you, Engin. Did I lose or not? Never, never. He won the match, but about the round, I can still say my opinion only if they both promised me that they don't get upset. But let's forget about that.
Engin Terzi: There are sports like boxing, if you can't continue, you lose the match, right? But not in armwrestling. In armwrestling you win the round, enough rounds, and then you win, yeah. Tyson Bull says Colapool armwrestled his whole body in 2025. And, yeah.
Engin Terzi: And then Dino says, only thing what will be ripped is your oxygen hose. Levan, this is super chat, sorry. These are not my opinions, so don't get angry with me.
Levan Saginashvili: They were saying the same things with Devon, now here it's useless. Top role is for Subar, says no Cola, no win. And Ermes, okay my friend.
Engin Terzi: Um, another one. Ermes, last time you were gonna pull Levan, you didn't believe at all that you can win. You said, even one round, you know, even one round. No, no, even one shake on him. Oh, stop. Holding him, yeah. You said that even you give him a hard match. But this time, you already had one experience with Levan, and now you're going Chicago. But this time, for sure, you are not going Chicago for one round,
Ermes Gasparini: or two rounds or hard match you are going there to win the world title, correct? yes, of course if I think to lose it is better to stay at home or to change another opponent, easier opponent and the question is since you accepted the match
Ermes Gasparini: Your form and your hopes are bigger, same or less? In the beginning, it was less. Okay. And the more days passed, how is it now? After this, I saw more good results in the gym. And your confidence is more, you understand. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: So your form is satisfying and your form is even better than what you were thinking in the beginning? Yes. And Levan, what is this guy's winning chance against you? Tell us honestly. Do you see in your head that he's beating you?
Levan Saginashvili: I don't have a lot of opportunities, but I think that today is a special day for me.
Levan Saginashvili: One way to think about it is that it is a word, it has a lot of meaning, but it also means that it is a word with a meaning. In a word, in a sentence, in a sentence, in a word, in a sentence, it means that it is a word with a meaning.
Levan Saginashvili: saying honestly he has no chance against me unless car hits me or something uh
Levan Saginashvili: But I have to tell that probably he is the strongest after me in the world at the moment. Most probably he is much stronger than Devon at the moment.
Levan Saginashvili: and there might be some question marks in that department but overall I think that for example for shoulder press I think he is stronger than Devon and I think he is a confident number two in the world.
Engin Terzi: Ermes, do you think that Levan believes in what he says? That when you said that you have no chance at all? Or he's just intimidating? Or he really believes himself to be 100% favorite? I think he has some planning in his mind about the match. And...
Ermes Gasparini: and about this, I think in his mind he learned something about last match and he thinks maybe to win more easier for these things you know, you understand what I mean? and that's why he thinks I have zero chance but the reality will be different, he will learn something new
Ermes Gasparini: yeah i think i think when he will feel my hand my wrist something in his mind will change i can't i can't tell him the favorite with him nobody is the favorite but basically you are saying that he is again underestimating you
Engin Terzi: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
Ermes Gasparini: now he's gonna beat you 100% yeah maybe now he said last time hard fight i need to be 100% and now maybe he feels super strong and he he compare himself from last time i feel more stronger and i think he will beat me more easily
Ermes Gasparini: but from my part I can say I'm stronger than last time when we fought and if he went now here, me too, you understand? So you are saying that basically he doesn't realize how much you improved? Yeah, I improved a lot. These last years I improved a lot. Levan, do you think that your shape right now is the best shape of your life?
Engin Terzi: Is this? Yes. And Ermes, you disagree with him. Levan, when the Georgii armwrestling, they put your video, the one-arm curl, and Ermes wrote to me, I need to say Ermes, and he said in the past he was lifting heavier. And he said, oh, Elin, he is weaker than before. What was your response? It's really, it's true, he did more weight in the past, this exercise.
Levan Saginashvili: I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say.
Levan Saginashvili: My technique with that lift is slightly different. My wrist is more open and more flexed in the wrist and I simply didn't risk to go with a higher weight, but I think I could.
Engin Terzi: After that, I curled 180 kg, so I simply didn't have to go higher with that. Tomasso Tarlao, thank you for your support. And Michael's Workspace says, hi everyone, can't wait to meet you all in Chicago, East vs West 18. And we are closely
Engin Terzi: Hanging in any other sport you won't see, any athlete will argue with referee at all. It always bother me when I see this on armwrestling matches. I understand my friends, yeah. I don't know what to respond that part, but if there is another support chat,
Engin Terzi: Dino says, barely you will lose Ermes, bring Italian water. And Eric Taylor says, the true question is, if there was two more rounds, and he won it, would it be 4-2? But two rounds were four fades, and so technically 4-2, last two rounds go Ermes. This is Eric Taylor's opinion, super chat.
Engin Terzi: Dino says, Ermes, Levan, all these guys are picking on you. The guy says, don't pull your beard, teddy bear. Devon't be nervous, he says. He thinks that you are nervous. That's why you're playing with your beards. It's just a habit. I hope I will lose that habit.
Engin Terzi: Okay, wow. Gasparini also has this, just here. Gasparini doesn't have beer? Jonas says, what Ermes is saying is so stupid. So when Devon beat him 3-0 and Devon didn't continue to pull score, was 3-2,
Engin Terzi: 4-0 match over, simple as that. Now this guy is supporting Levan. But the thing is that it is not Devon that didn't continue, it was Ermes that didn't continue at that time. So probably this is the, wow, a lot of chat here, I see a lot of chat. People are saying Engin is scared of Levan.
Engin Terzi: I mean, how can you not be scared of someone like this? No, it's not scared. It is because Levan is important for me. He's my good friend. I really love and respect. Same, I really love and respect Ermes. I don't want them to misunderstand me and get upset with me when it is misunderstanding. Okay, Angel says, let's move on another subject. You both are very strong.
Engin Terzi: Arm shark, arm wrestling. King will fall, let's go Ermes. And Ermes, how do you... How do you... How much do you want Ermes? How much do you want? How important it is for you to beat Levan and become new champion? How important is it for you? Too much. Too much.
Ermes Gasparini: I remember last time when I fought with him, I was very relaxed. No stress last time.
Ermes Gasparini: Because you had nothing to lose, but this time you lost the same card twice. I thought, I said many times if I can stop, you know, but inside really I never thought I can win. This time I'm really nervous because I know I have some possibility.
Ermes Gasparini: And I feel a lot more confident than last time. And if you want to win this fight, you need to be 100% with the mind, body, everything 100%.
Engin Terzi: I will do my best, I will do my best for this match. Okay, okay. So you are going to Chicago once again, we repeated many times, to beat this guy. You're going there to beat this guy. Yeah, for sure. Okay, okay. Why not? Okay, Tita says, does Ermes think that he will win at least one round? This is Superchat, not my question. Ermes, they are asking you, so no need to answer.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, I want to win. I want to win. Yeah. Okay. And then... Who is next regardless of conclusion? Right now, we don't think about what is next because this is the most important match. I'm just checking the... bringing the chat down to see.
Engin Terzi: And guys, please be respectful. Angel says, Levan won last time. We will see what happens next. Let's talk about something else. Do you like cookies? They are asking. Yes, of course. Cookie, cookie.
Engin Terzi: Anyway, so, Ermes, I have a question. TV19 is asking you, Ermes could win round three and four if we do not go flop. Okay, Ermes, if you said that round two you get angry because Irakli was laughing, smiling, and after you started, if you would really start, you know, just going back pressure and doing
Engin Terzi: would be different? Do you think that there would be much? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So you, if you knew what you knew later rounds, right from the beginning, maybe you would be the winner. This is what you believe. Yeah. Yeah. Devon't be afraid. Just say your opinion. I repeat, please. I'm just saying that if like round three, you strike this. Okay. Round three. If you knew
Ermes Gasparini: what to do, not during the match, but if you knew it before the match. I don't know, I don't know win 100% much much different, yeah. So there would be even, okay. Yeah, because in this position, I never pull at this position. Ford me, it was a new technique, you know.
Ermes Gasparini: Every time, every match, you learn more. You think it was better to do like this, this. But my goal is not to go again here. Toniço, can you translate? Ermes is saying that if he knew what he learned during the match,
Levan Saginashvili: Before the match, things might have been different. Can you ask this Levan's opinion about this? Ermes, I think that the match itself is a very interesting one. I don't know what to think about it. I don't know what to think about it. I don't know what to think about it. I don't know what to think about it. I don't know what to think about it. I don't know what to think about it. I don't know what to think about it. I don't know what to think about it. I don't know what to think about it. I don't know what to think about it. I don't know what to think about it. I don't know what to think about it. I don't know what to think about it. I don't know what to think about it. I don't know what to think about it. I don't know what to think about it. I don't know what to think about it. I don't know what to think about it. I don't know what to think about
Levan Saginashvili: Well, I was told that I was going to be a teacher, and I was going to be a teacher, and I was going to be a teacher, and I was going to be a teacher, and I was going to be a teacher, and I was going to be a teacher, and I was going to be a teacher, and I was going to be a teacher, and I was going to be a teacher, and I was going to be a teacher, and I was going to be a teacher, and I was going to be a teacher, and I was going to be a teacher, and I was going to be a teacher, and I was going to be a teacher, and I was going to be a teacher, and I was going to be a teacher, and I was going to be a teacher, and I was going to be a teacher, and I was going to be a teacher, and I was going to be a teacher, and I was going to be a teacher, and I was going to be a teacher, and I was going to be a teacher, and I was
Levan Saginashvili: Um,
Levan Saginashvili: The way I pulled in the beginning, he doesn't have any chance to stop that. His only chance was when he stopped at the end and my arm got pumped. That's the only chance that he got. So he's saying that the result would have been the same. Yeah. No, he said in the third round, yes, changes.
Levan Saginashvili: Yes, I think that it is important to have control over everything, and I think that it is very important.
Levan Saginashvili: I was controlling the center. I had just a little trouble at the final end above the pin.
Levan Saginashvili: And that was because I got pumped and my arm started to straighten. That's why I had to readjust, go above and attack again. If he tried the same thing in the first rounds, that would have been too risky because I would simply injure him. So that would not have worked in the first rounds.
Engin Terzi: Empty Corner says, all jokes aside, the community absolutely loves both of these titans. Levan and Ermes will go down as some of the most powerful athletes to ever live. And Ermes, there is a question, are mutants? Ermes versus Devon in December, my friend, we don't know anything yet. We need to see.
Engin Terzi: Levan versus Ermes, which is the most important match. And then we need to see Laletin versus Devon, which is next event. And, yeah. Okay, so empty corners. Devon trash in the house right now. Wake up says, let me finish this Superchess and we can slowly finish the program. Wake up says, Levan, this is a very important question.
Levan Saginashvili: do you think you could beat Devon and Ermes if you and them weighed 140 kg? yeah of course if i was 140 i would have been crazy good so he means that he of course he would beat him because at 140 he would be really good
Engin Terzi: He would be really what? Really good? Yep. Very sexy and very beautiful. So you would be very sexy and Ermes and Devon would fall in love with you and then they would lose?
Engin Terzi: Ermes and Devon will not be sexy in 140. I will be. Aha, you will be sexy, but they will be like fat. Okay. And then, Mapozjan, love both of you guys. Wish you no injuries, first of all.
Engin Terzi: Kevin Tomkay says, Engin, when is your young Turkish girl, your coach at the King of the Table gonna compete again? She won the qualifications and so she deserves one match. Stinky Taco says, Ermes will not even feel Levan at the table. I don't know what that means. Ermes will not feel means Ermes is gonna destroy him or Levan is gonna destroy him.
Engin Terzi: Mask Aurel says, if you win Ermes, I will give you a special made gladiator watch. Oh, nice. Yeah, he's going to give you a gladiator watch, yeah? Wow, there are so many. I missed it while we were arguing about the fifth round. Hey, Marvin, guys, here. Levan will eat Ermes. Levan is too strong. And one more.
Engin Terzi: Welch Mishra says, Ermes can win. He is super strong and has the heart of a lion. Allen the best, Ermes. We support you. Thank you, guys. Music Guy says, whoever likes cookies more will win.
Engin Terzi: Like, whoever likes the cookies more will win the match. What is eat the cookies? Cookie, like cookie, you know, you cook like a... Ah, but biscuit. Yeah, something, but not really biscuit, but cookie, yeah, yeah. Anmol says, Ermes will win this time, Levan also knows this. Is that true, Levan? Ermes will win this time, this guy's... Yes, he knows, he knows. Levan knows as well.
Levan Saginashvili: Ermes will win this time to second place. He will be number two. He will win second place. But how is it? If he loses against me, he can't be second because he's not going to have a chance. Okay, let me see another super chat. Yeah, one more. Dino says,
Engin Terzi: My Teddy, we're going to shave your beard and belly. This guy is just picking on you. And Armutan says... He loves me. He loves me. My friend, Armutan says, Engin, bring back microphones for the athletes. My friend, it just happened one event. And majority of the match, athletes had the microphone. A few matches, they didn't. And then, the event after, we had it. So, looks like you are not really following. And...
Engin Terzi: And then, okay, Bukharat says, my question to Ermes, how much weight is he going to be in this match? And is this important? Weight factor is important, he's asking, if it is important. Okay, wow. No, weight is not too much important. Because I prefer to stay more down than grow up two, three kilo only water, you know, no problem.
Engin Terzi: No, not important. Okay. Guys, do you have any message to the fans? And also any last words to each other? Do you guys want to say anything? Ermes, I'm interested, the training videos you put out, is that gym in your house?
Ermes Gasparini: No, no. Yes, but out of my parents. My dad and my mom. He's not here. When I was born, I was with my family. Ermes, there is one more question. Engin, my question, please. Ermes, do you think Levan is cute when he armwrestles?
Ermes Gasparini: With him, really, I never had some trouble to go set up. He's very fair. No, no, no. He acts like he's cute, you know? Like, nice, you know? Yeah, too much cute. He is? Yes. He kissed my face last time. You sure? He did? Yes. Listen, listen. During the match, he kissed you?
Engin Terzi: Yeah. Which round? You don't remember? He come and kiss you? Yeah, my friend, I love you. Which round? Which round? Third, fourth. Oh, after he finish? Yeah, yeah. And then he come and kiss you. OK. OK. OK. Why did you do that, Levan? Why did you kiss him? You want to comfort him? I love him. You love him, yeah? OK.
Engin Terzi: Okay, and Warren says, if you beat Levan, Ermes, or when you beat Levan, you're number one in the world, what is next for you? Arsen you going to arm wrestle left hand just for fun? Like, after you beat Levan, what is next for you? What do you want to do next? I don't want to think now. Yeah. Ford sure, we compete for many years, I hope, and we fight with everyone.
Ermes Gasparini: Left, I have too much pain, I don't know. My left is not good, really. Too much pain. Okay, and do you have, what is your last message to each other or to the fans? Nothing, I hope he will travel, it will be good. I hope he will prepare everything to be super strong, like mask, Coca-Cola.
Ermes Gasparini: Nothing my friend, now is the time, there are two weeks, I prepared, I can't wait to pull, that's it. I can't wait to pull really, I can't wait to see my result on the table.
Engin Terzi: While we are talking, one more superchat, Mapozjan says, last video about Levan's life was great. Ermes, you need to drive to Italian mountains once again and film it. No, I will go Italy and we will do one with your family. Ermes, the next documentary, we need to do it, yeah. And okay, before I close, I need to say this. By the way, Levan, once again, thank you very much for the hospitality when we come to your home.
Engin Terzi: I said, what if you cannot control Ermes' pronators and you overpronate? And Levan said, he will control all of your life. I control all Italy. I take Rome, you know? Oh, so you will be the emperor of the Rome, huh? Oh, yeah, yeah. Allen Roats is going in Rome. Impossible, my friend. I'm coming to take.
Levan Saginashvili: Impossible to control the empire of Rome. Too strong. With all the structuralists of Europe. Caesar, the gladiators, all I think. So you will be the new emperor of Rome?
Engin Terzi: Yeah, Georgii is in wait in Rome. Oh, Ermes. Ermes, now you are not on me. Georgii king is coming, Georgii army. Ermes, now this is a different thing. He's saying he's going to come and take over Rome. Arsen you going to let this guy? Arsen you going to let this guy? My friend, the Roman Empire don't know Georgii.
Engin Terzi: I think they don't know where is it, Georgii, too much small, too much strong empire. I'm not doing anything. You guys are just going. We understand what he says. He says the empire of Rome is so big and they don't even know where Georgii, because Georgii is small. They know. They know. They know. OK. OK. So now, so this is this is Georgii empire versus Rome.
Ermes Gasparini: Next time, when I will give him the rematch, we will fight on Colosseum, in the middle. In Italy? Yeah. Imagine the scenes.
Engin Terzi: Colosseum, all the people fight. Do you think they would allow us to organize there? Maybe here in Verona, not Colosseum, maybe in Verona, maybe there are some possibilities. Do you think they would allow if you ask for permission? Maybe, yes. Yeah, Levan, are you not going to thank him? He says that after he beats you, he will allow you for a rematch. No, I don't want a rematch. I don't want a rematch.
Engin Terzi: Very good man, my friend. Very good guy. How much do you pay? I know you're joking, but yeah, yeah, yeah. So that is the only way. Either the car hits you or he gives you a million dollars.
Levan Saginashvili: You are basically saying it's impossible, Levan. When something doesn't exist, how can I say that it exists? I can't tell lies. Allen exists, my friend. Allen exists? Allen exists. I show one.
Ermes Gasparini: Who is that? Yeah, I saw him one time in the night. I saw one alien. Seriously? It looked like what? I don't remember, by the way. You don't remember? Okay. It was very big. It is me. It is me, Herman.
Engin Terzi: I will be there. That's how it goes. It was me. It was you and then it was in his dream, right? After Dubai. But Levan, just imagine. Ready, go. Ermes is loading, loading, back pressure. You go and your wrist like straight. Does it scare you to think there's such possibility?
Engin Terzi: You will beat him? Last time you tried this, he didn't allow you. Ermes says that nobody can beat him after he toprolls him. He cannot beat him. This is what you said, right, Ermes? If I take his wrist? Yeah, take his wrist, yeah. No way? No. No way? No way.
Ermes Gasparini: Yeah, of course. If he takes my wrist, how can I win? But you look like... So you are saying if your wrist stays? So is that wrist ready, Levan? Your wrist is 100% now, his wrist. Yeah. Did Levan share any risk with you this time? No. Why do you think he didn't share, Ermes?
Levan Saginashvili: Because I don't think his wrist is 100%. It's 100% or not? Do you feel pain or still pain or not?
Levan Saginashvili: Actually, I don't train my wrist with a dumbbell anymore after that incident, so now I train with the cable machine on blocks. Go ahead, go ahead. Do you feel 100% or not this time?
Levan Saginashvili: Yes, I think that in practice, it is very difficult to say that it is possible to do it. But in practice, it is very difficult to say that it is possible to do it.
Levan Saginashvili: It feels very good. I'm assessing by the table time, by the table practice. I feel fully confident. I don't train with the dumbbell anymore because I was just chasing weights. So at the moment I'm focusing on the table time.
Levan Saginashvili: I have no doubt about that. I have no doubt about that. I have no doubt about that. I have no doubt about that. I have no doubt about that. I have no doubt about that. I have no doubt about that. I have no doubt about that. I have no doubt about that. I have no doubt about that. I have no doubt about that. I have no doubt about that. I have no doubt about that. I have no doubt about that. I have no doubt about that. I have no doubt about that. I have no doubt about that. I have no doubt about that. I have no doubt about that. I have no doubt about that. I have no doubt about that. I have no doubt about that. I have no doubt about that. I have no doubt about that. I have no doubt about that. I have no doubt about that. I have no doubt about that. I have no doubt about that. I have no doubt about that. I have no doubt about that. I have no doubt about that. I have no doubt about that.
Levan Saginashvili: I'm lucky that my sparring partners, would that be Rackley or Sandro, are very good top rollers.
Engin Terzi: So during the sparring, I test the wrist really well. And that gives me all that I need. Ermes, he says that he's training partners. He said he's lucky because they are very good top rows. Do you think that it is possible then to make Devon's feel, Devon's wrist feel what you will make him feel?
Ermes Gasparini: Ford this, Georgii are very lucky to have a lot of strong people to train together. In Italy, not too much. No, that's not what I'm asking. I'm asking... Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm coming. But I think, yes, maybe Irakli and another guy, I don't know who is it, but...
Ermes Gasparini: is very strong, they are very strong, but with me I think he will feel a completely different pressure in his wrist and in the arm. Depending on my friend, how he is doing the training, many things are very different. Okay, Hermaridos Gasparini, how much does Ermes cure?
Engin Terzi: How much do you curl? 92 kilo? How? With dumbbell or what? I don't know. He said how much he curls, so just answer however you want because he didn't say in a specific way. Deadlift. Huh? Deadlift. Deadlift.
Engin Terzi: And then one more... Levan, okay, Devon's forum says Levan needs to pull more often, period. My friend, just please tell me, just Levan, instead of twice a year, if he would pull three times a year, just please tell me six matches that you want him to pull this year or next year.
Engin Terzi: Can you find six opponents? And then do you promise that you are not going to complain when I set him six different guys? You are not going to say, oh, why did you set this guy against that one? My friend, like I am having the hardest time of my life to find an opponent for him. And now they want me to. And then whenever you put, I don't want to mention names, like when we said Jerry match, they say, oh, why did you set Jerry? So whenever I said Morozov, they will say the same thing.
Engin Terzi: So there are only like right now, in my mind, you, Laletin and Devon, you know, these are the ones that, you know, like possibly good opponents, you know. And then music guy says that was Devon, not Elin, what you saw, Ermes, the guy says. Ah, maybe, maybe. OK, OK. And I think no more support chat. Yes, that's OK.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, Devon's forum says, pull anyone in top 10. I just want to see him pull my friend. You won't be representing the majority if I put anyone from top 10. If I put, just say, Gheorghe Di Dzeranov versus Levan, and then when you watch Laletin versus Gheorghe Di Dzeranov, and when I said Levan, the next thing you're going to say, Laletin flash pin him, and now you set him against Levan. I know what's going to happen.
Engin Terzi: Happen and one guy says how about Ryan Bowen? Yeah, that's a good matchup for that one. And okay, so But Bahara says live on pure power Ermes quality power. Okay, please don't send more super chess. I have been Here for like 1 hour 52 minutes. I don't want to keep this atlas awake any longer Devon Levan Saginashvili my friend

Ermes Gasparini: Really can't wait to pull me too. I think it will be a very hard fight. And that's it. We wish him 21. And good luck.
Engin Terzi: Because I said that some people are asking if Engin is quitting or not. I don't know. If the athletes want me to quit, I will quit. Do you want me to quit, Ermes? If you quit, I will quit too. Why is that? Why is that? No, you can't quit, my friend. You can't. Okay. And Levan, do you want me to quit? No, I said... I meant to use...

Engin Terzi: armwrestling today at the highest ever level highest like armwrestling has never been at this level and this match that you are gonna see on June 21st is one of the most important matches in the history and
Engin Terzi: Just if you miss this match, I don't know how you call yourself armwrestling fan unless you don't have, you know, financials for the pay-per-view. But trust me, guys, please go get your pay-per-view and do not miss this historical match where we may see a new champion or we may see Devon is just coming and destroying
Engin Terzi: match, Levan ended up winning. We don't know. Many times I organize matches, people said, oh, Laletin is going to kill Morozov. Why you set this match? Why you set this match? Why you set this match? It didn't end up like this. To me, Laletin versus Morozov match was one of the most beautiful matches ever. And at the moment that, you know,
Engin Terzi: Morozov stopped him and was saying, like, davai. I was like, wow, is it real? Like, I was like, well, it was beautiful. I mean, I can't imagine anything like, like a few moments, like when Devon and Levan pulled the match stop at the middle, I was like, wow, is it real? Like, lifestop, you know? Two of the most unforgettable moments was like also you versus Levan match, that round three that you stopped, I was like,
Engin Terzi: Is it real, you know? So it is beautiful. These matches, Levan, you are incredible at it. You dominate everyone. But what makes these matches unforgettable is that because you are super dominant guy, anyone who gives you a little bit trouble, like for us, it's like shock, you understand? So it is not because disrespect to you, but it is mostly because of seeing like you, how high, you know?
Engin Terzi: And the same thing with Ali Khan and Matushenko round one, they stop at the middle. I was like, wow, you know, incredible. So we love armwrestling and this is the best armwrestling parents can do.
Engin Terzi: West 18 just get your pay-per-view and support the sport that you love because this is the unification. East versus West is the unification of all the top athletes to make sure that our power is all together just
Engin Terzi: Anyways, guys, once again, Levan, thank you very, very much, brother. Same for you, Ermes, brother. Thank you very much, brother. You all take care of yourself. Bye-bye. See you in Chicago, Ermes. Chicago, Chicago. Take care.
