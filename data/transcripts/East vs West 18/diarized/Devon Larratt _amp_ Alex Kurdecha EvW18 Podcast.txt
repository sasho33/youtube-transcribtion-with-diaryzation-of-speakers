Engin Terzi: Hello. Hello. Hello guys. Uh, we are live now. Okay. Let me also share this on social media and then we can start. So what, what, what's going on? You know, normally Devon, you have some beef with your opponents. This time you stay quiet. Is that because you don't take the left arm that seriously or
Engin Terzi: You don't want to poke the bear. Arsen you talking to Alex? Yeah. Yeah. You don't take it that seriously, Alex? Number four in the world? No, no, no, no. I'm talking about you. Oh, me. Oh, I thought you were talking about Alex. You pick on your opponents all the time. And this time, I see you're just sharing the... Well, how am I supposed to pick on him? Why?
Devon Larratt: He's bigger than me. He's younger than me. He's ranked number four in the world. Hey, I had a question, Alex. Do you know where I'm going? Let's go. But before you have a question, I say, Engin, it's all mind games, you know? Mind games? What's a game? How am I supposed to play mind games with him like this, you know? How am I supposed to play mind games?
Alex Kurdecha: So he's just like trying to not to make angry, like the same game he played with Ermes. Ermes, you are so strong. I have a 1% chance. Okay, okay. Ermes is so strong, but Alex is even stronger. Alex smoked Ermes. Oh, Ermes will love this. Ermes, you see, you know. Right? That's what I remember. I remember you crushed Ermes. That's true. That's definitely true. I know. It was like that.
Devon Larratt: yes beat him very badly you did it much more badly than me i was kind i was i was good and kind i i think i will have to be my enemies yeah they are like oh no no no
Devon Larratt: You beat him so badly. I beat him nicely. He wants me to beat him again. But you beat him in that way that he says, Devon, no, no, no. No, Devon. No, that's not true. When I pulled Ermes, he was unprepared. Maybe Coca-Cola was not drinking. I don't know. Right. There was no Coca-Cola. He was out of sugar. That's the reason. Definitely.
Engin Terzi: Engin, please bring the Coca-Cola to the Superman. Listen, for what? Do you guys have that kind of problem? Like low sugar level or what? I have all sorts of problems. Yeah, lots of problems. Okay, so Devon, you can't really... I know you. I know you as much as you know me. Listen, you are coming...
Engin Terzi: like with right arm maybe you are more confident and more but left arm you are still being okay so see so you are saying that right is bigger oh you can see it right can you see the difference a little bit a little bit but but listen it's still part of the mind game alex still part of the mind game look at my left or for sure yeah so it's photoshop you know photoshop left is bigger than right now
Devon Larratt: I want to know more about you, Alex. I want to know what happened in university. I actually also want to know this story because I don't know where you hear this story about university. You probably have a good friend. It's true, isn't it? Honestly, it's about points, but not about IQ.
Devon Larratt: we have like point system and yes in point system i was here like quite big point system but it was not about iq it's not only like somebody told me who told you that i don't know people tell me all sorts of things alex you're telling people to tell devon what you you are telling people to tell devon these kind of things
Devon Larratt: Oh, yeah, yeah. It was my propaganda, you know, to train top row. I do not go flow press, go hook. You know, it's part of propaganda. Yes. I don't know how to play mind games with somebody who has the biggest IQ of the University of Poland. I know that you probably have much more bigger IQ. No, no, no, no. I've got mine tested. I grew up in a very oxygen poor environment.
Alex Kurdecha: It's the best environment for a wild arm wrestler. We had a wood stove, and the wood stove, it smoked up my whole house all the time, and there was just not enough oxygen to feed my brain properly, and that's why I'm a Kings mover now. I'm very basic, very, very basic. You know that Engin loves Kings move, you know? You know why he loves you so much? Because Engin loves Kings move.
Engin Terzi: It's favorite. I'm still not a big fan of Kingsman. Alex, one second. You know that Devon is a smart guy, but now he's playing this like we're smoking the house. What do you think is his intention, you know?
Engin Terzi: i just want a special plan to say i'm an old guy i'm not trained or not smart beat up and look at my left arm and like if he loses he will be hiding behind all these excuses and if he wins even in such case you know such condition is it is that what it is exactly that's the plan you you you got it you know i i try
Alex Kurdecha: people think that i play these mind games the thing is all i do is i just speak the truth i always just say the truth and some people think it's mind games but the truth is is that i i'm not even a top 10 left arm wrestler i mean you should smoke me you should kill me like i'm trying to find a place where i have something on you
Alex Kurdecha: That's why you accepted the match? That's why you accept the match? Oh, listen, I'll accept. I will always accept a good match. I mean, and the thing that I really like is it puts me above Camille, which I think is so funny. Like, if I can just pass Camille, that's really funny to me. If I lose, it was also part of the plan to put you above Camille.
Alex Kurdecha: camille right yeah and then i've never i can just from there i can just pass camille and i can watch him make i can just watch him make videos for the next like two years about yeah well i'd have to i'd have to the refs would have to make a bad call which is maybe possible
Alex Kurdecha: So that's the only way that you can win. It's the only way. If the refs really mess up, which I'm kind of counting on at this point. Let's stop for a second. Okay, I understand. But you don't have a goal to become number one with left arm? Just say honestly. I have a goal to live to 5,000 years old. I have a goal to... So you have the goal, but you are saying it's not realistic.
Alex Kurdecha: i mean come on how is it how could it how can i possibly beat alex kordechia how like i mean can i hook you can i properly exactly this is the easiest way what happened with daddy can daddy did the hook he likes how you say it i need to remember he just broke my arm how did he do that
Engin Terzi: How did that happen? Ermes, these guys, at the beginning of the program, they are saying, you beat Ermes badly. They say that, no, no, you beat him, you crush him. They are teaming up now. They are teaming up against you? They hit each other like crazy now. They are teaming up because they are jealous because I'm going to beat Lewand. That's why. Oh.
Alex Kurdecha: I have a question. I have a question. Ermes, look at the camera. If Ermes beats Devon, does that mean that Ermes is ranked three and Alex is two and I'm one? Yes. Exactly. He said that you are fucking jealous because you can't do anything to Devon. Hey, but
Devon Larratt: But if Devon's not the champ, then, I mean, does that make Alex and I the champ because we both beat you? How about Jerry? Jerry don't pull. Jerry don't pull. And then Ermes beat Jerry. Yes, he beat him, but Jerry now don't want to pull. So, unfortunately, Jerry not in ranking. But, my friend, we will fix everything. Devon't worry.
Alex Kurdecha: Did you hear that, Devon? We will fix everything. Devon't worry, he says. Just try not to get your bicep tore, Ermes. Just try not to get your bicep tore. Try not to get your back broken. Tell Ermes to come on in and talk to us. This whole phone and everything. Tell him just to join us. Ermes, would you join the podcast if I send you a link or not?
Alex Kurdecha: just five minutes just five minutes okay yeah listen let's let's team up on him you and me we'll sort ourselves out afterwards but let's beat up ermys for a little bit okay that's the plan there's the plan oh these guys are teaming up against hermes well okay but seriously how much do you weigh these days alex oh something like 160 63 not not too much
Engin Terzi: Okay, before Ermes comes, I want to read a few superchats so that we will not forget. That Bob guy, Devon should have kept the crusted clown haircut. Frantic has, hello Devon.
Engin Terzi: And then we have, we have, we have, we have, okay, I can read your name. Hi, Engin, can we see Jerry Kaderet versus Michael Todd? Also, Dadikian and Alizan, not possible. Can you put David, Ivan Matyshenko? Anything is possible. If I pull Alizan, I want to be paid $300,000.
Engin Terzi: When did you hear this story? Okay, okay. Is that including the winning bonus or no? No, no. No winning bonus. Just $300,000. You are a very decent guy. Yeah. He says the deception is inception. And okay. Ermes, just show us your face, my friend. Yeah. Okay.
Engin Terzi: okay so what's going on did they listen before you came they said that they will team up against you so i'm just informing them up yeah they hated each other and now team up i don't understand you remember when alex and i both beat you yeah remember
Devon Larratt: Pretty terrible, right? I say Devon beat you badly, not friendly. And I say Alex beat you badly. Why you art him up now, my friend? No, no, no, no. We just want to know who beat you worse. I was a good guy. He's a bad guy. He beat you badly. I was like a friend. I think Alex beat you worse than me. He beat you badly. We can't decide. He said my ass for one week before to beat me. Why badly?
Devon Larratt: Yeah, exactly. Alex is way meaner than me. Alex, you are feeling top 10 or not? Alex, you are feeling top 10?
Devon Larratt: You are still in top 10? I don't remember the ranking, right? Like you, you are number two or number three and you have much to lose now, you know? Ermes, are you going to pull both of these guys at some point? Yeah, for sure. Gotcha. You hear that? These, these, these, these are weak men.
Devon Larratt: wingman no no no yeah my friend don't worry about me he will not broke my bicep my back don't happen i will drink a lot coca-cola some oxygen i will super strong you will see but are you gonna have an oxygen machine
Engin Terzi: yeah for both like like darth vader for to continue six rounds last time listen one second he provoked you your relationship with leon went bad this time don't let that it's going worser so don't go there just go between you and devon between you and alex cordes forget about the one now
Engin Terzi: I have a good idea for you. I have a good idea for you, Ermes. So I think that, you know, when it comes to Devon, I think you need to be a little bit more respectful when you talk to him. Okay.
Alex Kurdecha: I think this will help. I think that you need to call him. I heard you call him pussy. That doesn't always go good. That doesn't always go good. He knows it. He knows it. I think you need to call him Mr. Pussy. Much better. Mr. Pussy.
Devon Larratt: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Devon Larratt: though, are you? You guys are you guys? Why? They won't. Why are you upset to the match? This guy is destroyed. Do you every time like nothing? I know. I know matches. It's dumb, right? Very strong.
Alex Kurdecha: I know. I thought I was going to pull Wagner. I said, let me pull Wagner. He number 10. I'm like number 11. And they say, no, no, you way too good. And I said, okay, maybe, maybe Tobias. They said, no, no, you too good. And they said, maybe Vitaly. And I said, no problem. And they give me Alex.
Engin Terzi: yeah yeah he actually he actually asked for michael todd travis virgin and corey west so we gave him corey west and then and then next time i was gonna give him tobias but but but you know i don't want to talk but he's too strong for you why you accept it dude listen in every life
Alex Kurdecha: You must have balance. I've been winning and winning and winning all the time. Allen the time. I win, I win, I need to. And Alex, Alex been losing and losing and losing. So now I get to lose. Alex gets to win. Everybody's happy. We are friends. We don't call each other pussy or Mr. Pussy. This is friendship. Come on.
Engin Terzi: Alex, do you believe Devon? Alex, do you believe what Devon says? This is what you will see? On June 21st, you will see a guy that, okay, I need to lose and Alex needs to win. You will see such a guy?
Engin Terzi: On the table he will be really busy, but it's also good to trust him because you hear he always say the truth. You trust him, so you will go with the mindset that everyone is just gonna lay, make you happy, right? I don't trust all the time before. Okay, I'm asking for this one, this one, what he said, do you believe that?
Devon Larratt: uh about what he said that he not in the best shape or what no no he says that you are so big so strong and then the life is all about the balance he is winning and now you lose all the time logical yeah i'm he said i'm good i'm yeah i'm agree he said it's about balance i'm also agree but i uh need to say uh this guy is very special so much will be very very don't forget coca-cola my friend
Devon Larratt: I already said to Engin to bring Coca-Cola. I already said it. Coca-Cola is bad for the health. Both Royals, they will sign the contract for August, big boy. It's already signed, buddy. I don't know why people keep on going. Why are you talking laliting? I don't understand. Why are you afraid of laliting? Right, right. Every time I see video, I don't know if I will pull, blah, blah, blah.
Alex Kurdecha: hey listen if i could if you knew everything you would be very shocked maybe in chicago i take you aside and i show you everything and you will be like oh okay okay i show you ermine i will you and me i will show you everything there are a lot of people who know everything not many when i say a lot maybe like seven people know everything you will be number eight
Engin Terzi: And you will see that I am ready to have the match. Engin, what do you think about this? Listen, I want to set the match. If someone else has been telling him to not accept it, that is not me, for sure. Engin, is the match set with Lillet and I right-handed on the 9th of August? Yes. Set, right? Yes. Oh, perfect. Set. Yeah. I did.
Engin Terzi: And, uh, there was, there would be maybe, maybe something different, but when, when Devon said that he wants to pull and it is all up to organizers. So, I mean, like, how can I reject and then take all the anger on me? Devon wants to pull, Laletin wants to pull, but Engin, the bad guy is not touching the match. So I said, oh no, no, no, no. Of course I will do it. That's called peer pressure. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Alex Kurdecha: if you came to canada you would fall victim to peer pressure come to canada we have all sorts of peer pressure that we put on people isn't that right alex yeah confirm it tell us tell us about your experience alex
Devon Larratt: Oh, and I really recommend you to go to Canada, to High Hookers Club. What kind of pressure did they put on you? What kind of pressure? They are very kind, they are very good, and they are very friendly, and they love armwrestling. There is a story, long version, I will tell you later, but shorter version, they are really very good and friendly. There's beautiful environment of friendship and...
Devon Larratt: Pulling all the day, 24 hours, seven days a week. Tell me about the pressure in a short version. Oh, they do the pressure all the time. They give you all the love from the heart. It makes pressure on you that you love armwrestling even more. Where is the pressure? You love armwrestling too much. But when you go to High Hookers Club, you start love armwrestling even more.
Engin Terzi: Okay, where is the pressure? I don't understand the pressure part. The pressure is that we bring you to... Too high to understand him. Sorry, sorry, sorry. What was the pressure you were telling me? Devon, what was the pressure you were telling me? The pressure isn't just from me. The pressure is just from the high hooker environment. You know, the...
Alex Kurdecha: all that comes with the lifestyle of being a Ottawa high hooker, all the best teachings. Um, you know, why do you arm wrestle in the first place? It's all right there in front of you, like all the things you get from being a champion and it's all right there. And some people, um, it's just shocking to some people. I think that we gave Alex and Issa a great experience when they came.
Devon Larratt: What did they do to you, Alex? What did they do to you? You even closed your eyes. Like something bad happened there, you know? Ermes also wants to share our experience. I know he also wants to go. But he hasn't gone there. Why do you need to tell? I'm in July. I don't...
Alex Kurdecha: july end of july big party big party it's our it's our high hooker day high hooker weekend big party big party big celebration of arm wrestling okay we could we could you had a king's move jace larson is saying devon in hermes's corner in chicago would be awesome he will help live on my friends
Devon Larratt: He's jealous of you? Yeah, he's jealous. If I beat Levi, he won't sleep every night. He cannot sleep. He won't sleep anymore if I beat Levi. Listen, Ernest, I hope you have a wonderful day. We need to be together, my friend. Why you are jealous? We need to be together to have the power together to change the history, my friend.
Alex Kurdecha: so maybe we form a union of a union of of every one of us against levon yeah and we all work together to beat 11. he's not the gorilla it's too much people versus leon come on guys under super heavyweights versus levon we will we can beat him we can do it
Devon Larratt: for sure how much do you need help do you need help no i need any and i don't need the web about my power i need the help about uh you know uh encourage like encouragement yeah you know you are physically strong you are physically strong but from support from the the the from from the people okay
Alex Kurdecha: Go ahead. Yeah, we, we all support you. Ermes. I talk about this match, your match with, with Levan. I talk about it everywhere. I think I talk about it every single day, every single day. Someone asks me, so what do you think about Ermes and Levan every single day? And I say that I think Ermes best guy to do it. Best guy, best chance, um, best shape. Very good.
Devon Larratt: Very smart. But Devon's still a favorite. My friend who is impossible to be the favorite with him. Impossible. Nobody is the favorite. You have best chance. I only can say I'm very good shape now. I know what I can do. I have the plane to pull with him.
Devon Larratt: And I feel something inside will happen. I don't want to take too much, but something inside I feel a little bit. Okay. And I will do my best. We will see. Frantic says that Devon will take Alex Kurdecha's wrist. 100%, he says. Impossible. Impossible. Impossible. Impossible. Impossible. No, too strong, Alex.
Alex Kurdecha: Alex is way too strong. He's way too strong. He's too big, he's too strong. Why are you accepted, my friend? We are too much. Too much power. Is Portugal like a god? Just the money. They paid me more than Alizan wants to get paid. This was the flow.
Devon Larratt: for that I mean I have to I have to right I mean you know you know honestly I have the plan I will put Alijan here and I hear that it's plus something to you if you like put you know the the label logo it gives you more money like vote give you more money if you put
Engin Terzi: I mean, nobody knows what they are talking about, about this subject. Only gossip. Only I and Alijan know. Everyone else knows. A lot of guys know it. A lot of guys know it. No, they don't know. They don't know. They are writing those kind of things. I read it to Alijan. That's not what I talked with Alijan. They don't know. Alijan directly shared what we talked with him.
Engin Terzi: But, but I didn't see that he's just conversation, but like asking 50,000, I didn't ask 50,000. That's all I'm saying. I'm asking 300,000 per match. Yes. And we decided to give it 300 plus bonus, even though you didn't ask for, and I love AOC says Devon King tell Ermes Pizzarini he's going to win. Ermes, you are gonna win.
Alex Kurdecha: It's easy. I know you don't think like this, but I don't. Okay. I appreciate this horrible. I'm terrible at calling matches. I, if I get 50%, it's a good day. I went back. I watched the match again. I watched the match. I think that that match was incredible. Last time you faced him incredible match.
Devon Larratt: And I really think that you could have beat him that day. I really believe that. Yeah, it was really close this time. Very close. I need only to have more power in the hand and don't finish in this position again. Only this. And you do have that. Power arm, I feel good. And the improvement of my hand is a lot.
Devon Larratt: Ford sure. I showed the weights and everything after I lost with you. If I can hold it more than last time, we'll change. Something will change. I think that there's a chance that this time, if you do take his hand a little bit the way you did last time,
Devon Larratt: this time he might come forward and try and flop like he did with me and you got to be ready to hook him with it when he does that you know what i mean like if you if you take it i understand i understand we will see we will see you know you can play everything and when you will be on the table we change everything like like every time hmm levan levan is asking for the link podcast link
Engin Terzi: oh yeah i'm joking i'm joking joking too much angry with me my friend i don't understand if levon comes on here it's all of us against levon all three of us against levon no no hermes he's not angry with you we are just bullshitting you know just to hype the mess some paranoid people says that way without knowing anything but yeah like
Engin Terzi: Oh, he is mad. I heard he's really mad. Yeah, yeah, he is mad, yeah. I mean, but people write, oh, Engin is just making up things. They are just like, nothing is happening. Like, listen, this is not the first time. Probably I told you, Devon, last time how Ermes was low, was also the same upset before Istanbul Apple event, you know.
Engin Terzi: But it's good that they cooled down. And now I want you guys to save your energy and everything for the match. But this guy is coming now. Before he was coming there to prove that he's not going to give you any rounds. This time he's coming there.
Engin Terzi: for total destruction. But right now, do you know how it is sometimes? Sometimes you don't want things to go that serious, but now nowhere to go. So all you can do is just maximum courage to have. So nowhere else to go. 21st June.
Devon Larratt: Fight. Fight, yeah. Fight. Fight. Yeah. Like crazy, my friend. Yeah. Hulk versus Gladiator. We will see. 20 days. Guys, I need to go. Yeah. The pizza arrived. And remember. Remember, Ermi. Remember, Alex and I both beat you. I feel like this. Devon't forget. Love you, Ermi. Love you.
Engin Terzi: I love you guys. Devon, Devon, Devon, Ermes also. You are somewhere right here, somewhere behind his head, but right now he doesn't want to remember. No, no, no. Now fully focused on Levan, but after Levan, after Levan. Fix. We will fix everything. Uh huh. Yeah. Ermes. Best thing for you. Paul a shorter guy, shorter who hooks.
Devon Larratt: Devon't worry, my friend. I already beat the Aladdin. I don't have any scary like you, my friend.
Devon Larratt: I'm going to beat Laletin. I'm going to beat him too. I'll beat him in August. Super high. In two months, I accepted immediately without no problem, without complaining. And they see only in your videos crying, I don't accept Laletin too strong. What are you talking about? Ermes, I want to pull him. I don't know why everybody's saying I don't want to. Bye, guys. We'll see you soon in three weeks. I love you all of them.
Engin Terzi: quality quality okay so now there's enough you know just changing the subject you know Ermes Levan and things like that how about now okay now in the next 30 minutes we're gonna talk Alex is gonna say something Devon says oh I'm weak Alex is gonna win so
Engin Terzi: That's how we are going to continue the program. I don't know what you're talking about, Devon. Come on, say that we are serious. I want to know more about this IQ test. Tell him, Devon, we are serious. You even want him to talk
Engin Terzi: like behalf of both of you instead of behalf of him. Tell him we are serious, you know, we already talk each other. And now, come on, man, come on, come on. Why do you think like this? I don't want to talk either. But Devon says that you are not at, like, he is not at your level, but he also wanted to pull you.
Engin Terzi: Maybe not recently, but he also wanted to pull you as well. So he wouldn't want to pull against you if he didn't believe that. He sounds like he barely accepted, but I know that he wanted to pull you. I'm not going to be ridiculous, but he wanted to pull you. Ford sure. You know for sure. You know who this guy. This guy beat Andrei Pushkar when he was in best top level shape on the left hand. I actually watched the match
Devon Larratt: old match with marcio it was beautiful it was also inside pulling outside pulling you know this is guy this is maestro of arm wrestling you know it's it's big honor to pull with him you know it's something i need to be tougher are you coming again to lose again uh you know where i'm going there or you know my aim i think everyone knows my aim but yeah yeah but the things are not going i will tell you what i believe it will be i believe
Engin Terzi: It will be very nice match. Did you know that people are giving me so much hard time saying that you rank a guy who is 0-2 with left arm at the East versus West? People always think like this. We have like people who have knowledge, who knows the athletes and we have... Listen, more the matches are going, more I need to stay quiet and they go louder. So, I mean, are we going to see...
Devon Larratt: You're going to see the best match of the night, I believe. It will be even more interesting than match of the title. Why would it be like that, Alex? Do you plan on losing?
Engin Terzi: No, no, no. I see that. No, no. That sounds like it, Alex. Do you know why that sounds? Alex, do you know why it sounds like that? Because everyone, Alex, just one second. Everyone thinks that you have a chance to beat him with domination. When you say, like, this is going to be a great match, it sounds like it's going to be a war. And when it sounds like it's going to be a war, everyone is, as Devon just said, picturing in their head, oh, Alex thinks that Devon is winning.
Devon Larratt: If I will beat him too fast, it's nothing interesting in it. You know, everyone says that you beat him only because you was faster. Like, you know, only reason you beat him, you know, the better man. Now we are getting there. You are saying edge on the stars. This is nice. Now, now I'm starting to hear something very interesting.
Alex Kurdecha: Okay. This is nice. See, I do the same thing, Alex. I do a very similar thing to you when I think that I'm so good. I am like, now I'm going to not just beat you, but I'm going to really, really fucking smear you, right? Yeah. Yeah, okay. And that's cool, man. That is cool. And that, now that would be a big win. Okay.
Alex Kurdecha: you know i think that a lot of people do think you can just bang bang bang the same way you have in practice the same way you like every time but when i hear you say that you can like you know really beat me then i'm like wow practice practice it's nothing but you just said that alex you just said that
Devon Larratt: it wouldn't be interesting to beat him so quickly. That's why you are going to make it harder. I said if I beat him, like you said, for example, flash pin, if it will be... You know the match with Ali and Michael when it was one millimeter, you know? Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's good, but it's still nothing like sure that you're better. So if I will pin him like that,
Devon Larratt: I'm not sure that I pin him actually. So you are saying that you wouldn't want to beat him like this? Honestly, I even don't believe that it's a good way to beat him like that.
Engin Terzi: be fast in the practice because in the practice once the match was stopping it was like more like devon's favorite and you said that now this is not a good way to win him win against him while in the practice that was the only way to beat him uh but tell me first of all why everyone thinks that so he is not uh good in left like like everyone says now like he is left is something not good
Devon Larratt: We remember who he beat in the past. He's not a weak guy. He's absolutely not. And you know what I love in this guy? You know what I love in this guy? Because he never tried to beat you fastly. He gave you to do everything possible. Everything possible.
Engin Terzi: Before beat you. How mad would Camille be if I beat you? Oh, I think very mad. Super mad. Yes. That alone is really motivating for me. You know. Who's going to take all the madness on him? It's me. That he's going to say, you rank this fucking guy with 0-3 up there. And then you may go over him, you know.
Engin Terzi: And then I will just say, all I will just say, you are right. And then what I will do, I will just take the responsibility, kick this guy out of top 10, and I will rank you in 10. Just joking. Joking. Joking. No, you need to leave it to Alizan. Whenever we say Alizan, from now on, I want to say Alizan. 300,000.
Engin Terzi: If we just go like this now, that means Alexander. Okay. Okay. John Augustine says, Ermes, my friend, Devon has already encouraged you by beating you last time, which made you train your hand and wrist to be much stronger.
Engin Terzi: okay okay so i don't know i don't know alex i don't know what to think about you he just said that if you beat him easy it will not be interesting you sounded like you're going to make it harder intentionally and whenever he said that oh now things change i will beat you that and this and then the next thing i heard you are praising me
Devon Larratt: You know, there are shifts on the car, you know, the one of them is reverse. You know, it sounded like reverse. You understand? I don't think it sounds like a reverse. I know it sounded to me. You know, I'm just thinking it's more serious that everyone thinks that Devon is nothing special on left. I really believe he's very special left and right. It's not a matter. Like it's even not a matter. And he will be, for example, compare his left compared to his right.
Devon Larratt: I don't know how many percent not so strong. This guy is actually the face of real power. It's nothing with how strong he is on the pronation, on the rising or something. It's about how he pulls, how he finds the way. And to pull with him, you always need to find also the way.
Engin Terzi: Alex, it is now June 22nd. Arsen you 1-2 or 0-3? I'm a very friendly Victorian, so it's very respectful and friendly. Okay, it's 1-2. On June 22nd, it will be 1-2, right?
Engin Terzi: one two in mine or in here what do you mean no no no no because right now with left arm at the east versus west you are zero three two so you can't match okay one two one okay so that's all i want to do okay okay
Engin Terzi: OK, so you need eight guys who are watching us. These guys seem like they were going to have a very friendly, respectful, but the winner is right here. So I got what I wanted to hear from both of them. So now, 3WOD. Can you ask Alex if he has a PhD in what engineering? Human factor in aircraft accidents. OK.
Engin Terzi: Todd and Alex Lovechild, Engin Terzi, greatest promoter, greatest pronator. You got that right. I know somebody right there is disagreeing, but, and okay, you answered it. The guy, same thing he asked. Can you ask Alex if he has PhD in what, engineering? And then Frantic says, Devon, buy Alex something to do with IQ. Oh. Oh, hey, IQ. Okay, so let's see. You know, you want to hear it.
Alex Kurdecha: So I always try to get something from the people that I arm wrestle. Like if I'm arm wrestling this person, I try to absorb something from them into myself to make myself better. It's kind of like cosmic punch. Everybody I touch, I try and take a piece of them. And, you know, I like to play chess, but I'm really bad at it. No, you are good.
Alex Kurdecha: No, no, no. I'm very bad. And, and it's, and it's gotten much worse over the last couple of years. Like I'm like my ELO score keeps dropping and dropping and dropping. And, um, and I'm hoping that when I pull you somehow I can raise it back up a little bit. Maybe I can just, whether I win or whether I lose, maybe it just taught by touching you. Oh, it's for sure. What is your, you know, on the cards on the cards, um, the engine makes,
Devon Larratt: What is your table IQ? It's N input, so ask him. I don't remember all of them. I don't remember all of them. What would you say out of 10? On the left, it was inside was something like seven before the moroso, you know? Seven?
Engin Terzi: No, no, no, no, no, no. You mean the IQ? I don't think your IQ was seven. No, no, no, no. I mean inside pull. Oh, inside. No, no, no. I'm talking table IQ. We didn't know that. Listen, we didn't know your hook. After that, we learned. Allen we knew about was your right arm, which is full outside. With left arm, you show inside, press, side, outside, you know. Okay, one more thing. I'm going to ask something, Alex, to you.
Alex Kurdecha: Lebarion Numan, please visit Sweden, Devon. I would love to. I'd love to come back to Sweden. Yeah, okay. Is there a correlation between table IQ and actual IQ, or is it completely not related at all? Mason Volt is a very special Volt. It's absolutely another, you know. A different IQ. Different IQ.
Devon Larratt: So you can be like the smartest guy in the world and be like the dumbest on the table possible. You can try to pull Einstein and I think his IQ will not help him. But listen, Einstein have never spent time for arm wrestling. Alex, you have been spending time, so you should be like a bit better than Einstein. But like you said, it's about time. Actually, it's about time. Because remember, Vitaly says that he was needed like 12 years to win his country championship, yeah?
Devon Larratt: Like I was won a championship maybe in 2017. So I'm like, you know, I like a kid in our medicine. And he says that before he won this title, he spent 20 years. So I think like years of experience in our medicine also give you something. Yeah. I have a question now. Alex, with left arm,
Engin Terzi: Two matches that you lost was exactly against the people who control your pronator. You know, they went inside. At least they had the cup over your pronator. And they both have very strong cupping from the bottom tendon of the wrist. While you now have an opponent who is actually, I think, attacking to your hand.
Engin Terzi: Ford sure. Yeah. And with right arm, you have pure top roll to take risks. With left arm, you are not pure top. You just so much trust yourself. You curl your wrist and you go sideways. I'm a decided block presser. I'm not sure why everyone thinks that I'm like a top roller on the left. No, no, no, no, no, no. With left arm, we haven't seen you until your matches. But with the right arm, we know that you go outside. You are like dominant puller. But what I'm just saying that now somebody,
Engin Terzi: who will be attacking your hand, unlike Morozov and Darikyan. So just tell us honestly, like just, okay, you're a smart guy and you like to do mind games as well. I understand everything. But like right now, somebody is actually attacking your hand. At least stylistically, is it a better matchup for you? So there will be more opportunities.
Devon Larratt: Honestly, like more ways how it's match can going. It can go fast, but I don't think it will go fast. But it's also some possibilities that it can go fast. But with Morozov, when you ask me, Morozov was one with me when we have long rounds,
Devon Larratt: pool and after that he was faster and he was going to the triceps when you remember when he was winning with me yeah he was a little bit tired and he was fast yeah you you got you got exhausted a little bit yeah and with dadikan i need to also tell you the truth like it's maybe not pleasurable truth for me but it's truth in first round we go inside
Devon Larratt: He was much more better. I was going to come back from not good position, but he was better. He was much more better inside. And in the rounds next, he was
Devon Larratt: faster and better, you know, inside. Because you are explosive puller, probably you got maybe exhausted in pulling in a style that you are not. Yes, honestly, he was really much more faster than me. I was even not able to attach. It was look, therefore, like I was like really nothing. His hand is very strong? I would say not very strong, but his style that he goes very fastly and
Devon Larratt: It's something not pure hook and for sure not top roll, but it's not press. It's not pure hook. It's something which goes to the hook in later levels of the round. Like at the beginning, he goes maybe side and hook, maybe side and hook, something like that. And he's not very typical.
Devon Larratt: If I will be pulled with him tomorrow, I really will do with pleasure and I will be pulled absolutely not in that style. I will probably go much more inside and intentionally inside. I thought you would try to toproll him, not to go there. Toproll is possible, but with toproll you need to be with a good setup. If you see it's not a good setup, with him it's good to go very deeply inside because
Alex Kurdecha: uh you can uh attach your all power and if he's stronger it's just mean that he's stronger let's go to devon now let's go that's where that's where i like to arm wrestle these days i i kind of set up and then right here right here and that way one of us has to break our arm and that's that's what i like that's
Alex Kurdecha: One of us, I don't care you or me flip a coin, but both of us just promise to just both bring our soul. Alex, would you accept to start inside with Devon? Yes, yes, I'm agreeing. Me, perfect, perfect. Let's do it. In the straps, inside, 100%, round one.
Engin Terzi: Because according to rules, we need to make you straight, but you just promise and then you go boom. And my promise is worth everything. You can count on me. I know your body. I love your body. I think Kenkin don't believe us, but I believe.
Engin Terzi: Listen, I don't really care. If he screws you, he's screwing you, not me. So who cares? Yeah. So, and Frantic says, yes, Devon, come to Sweden with Arsen. And Red John says, Devon, prediction about Fia versus Allen Janeheim. Ooh, good match. Good match. Not everybody can be a champion, you know. Not everybody can be a champion. He still didn't forget that.
Alex Kurdecha: Yes, he will know. He will know. He is so funny. I love fear. I've known fear a long time, so, you know, I have to support fear. Uh, but the young Swede is incredible. Um, you know, I know, like I've been following, I I'm aware of her career. I know that she has wins. She has, she has beaten fear. I'm quite sure in a tournament.
Engin Terzi: I think one round, I think, but was it left arm, right arm? I don't remember. I don't remember, but it was at a tournament that Fia went to up north in Sweden, wasn't it? Yeah, yeah. Well, I think one round Elin won, but I don't know if she won the whole thing. But yeah, it is going to be a tough match. And interesting thing is that Fia's previous match was also against an athlete from Sweden, Malin. So the ladies from Sweden are very strong.
Alex Kurdecha: yeah and then and then there's sarah too who's probably i think she's probably gonna get down to 70 kilo also that's four of the top women at 70 kilo are all swedes it's like uh yeah that's that's that's amazing i i think that i i think that uh fee is probably still the favorite um how old is uh miss anaheim now is she like early 20s 23 24 maybe i remember her like
Engin Terzi: Maybe 2016, 2017, she was like 14 years old. She was winning the under 18 category. She was very, very strong. Did she just win the Europeans? Is that what that was? Yeah, that was her last event in the other organization and now she joined WAF and she will compete from now on here.
Engin Terzi: And who's winning? I know you say that you support, I think, did you say that you support FIA? I think, I think, sorry, FIA. I think FIA will still win. I'll get them all confused. I think, I think FIA will still win. Boss Royale says, Devon, what's the toughest, who? Okay, Devon, what's the toughest Ukrainian you faced? Probably saying who was the problem, you meant to say. Who was the toughest Ukrainian? Pushkar? Well,
Alex Kurdecha: Probably pushcard, yeah. Probably pushcard. I mean, Oleg Zok is tough. Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, Petrenko. I mean, I had a great day up against Petrenko, but he's tough. And I don't know if you want to count Denis as a Ukrainian or as a Russian. I don't know. But I mean, obviously, that's a great name. Well, actually, he's terrible.
Engin Terzi: He is obsessed with Dennis. He is terrible. You know that he's from, he always represented Russia, but you still mention him just to find a reason to message him. Go ahead. It's okay. I have an important question. Okay. So I think that incentive is a very important. So like, you know, Alex Kardashian, number four in the world, it's a big deal.
Alex Kurdecha: In that top five, number four in the world, left-handed. I feel like number four, they could probably have a title shot, right? Like if you had a good performance against the number four guys, you mean, you mean who? Oh, okay. Yeah. Allen right. If I could have one match, what I get to pick who I get to pull. If I, if I win.
Engin Terzi: Okay, so you are saying if you beat Alex, you can pick the match? Do I get to pick? Yeah, but my friend, it needs to make sense with the organization as well. We can tell you, you can pick, and then you are going to pick. I think he will pick Morozov. Oh, Morozov now cannot pull. What's that? If I had only one pick? Come on, you know who I'd pick. Who is the guy? Who is the guy?
Engin Terzi: one pick left-handed my friend i i need to know who he is and then if it makes sense of course we are going to set it but i don't know who you are going to say you you are extraordinary person sometimes your ideas are just i don't know sometimes beautiful sometimes this one is not beautiful this is a terrible one okay so you're gonna say you're gonna say dennis
Engin Terzi: I think that, yeah. The guy doesn't even arm wrestle with left arm anymore. Yes, he does. He's lying like he always does. He's a liar. He's hurt with his shoulder. He's not hurt. He's not hurt at all. You see it. He's posting videos all the time. Listen, whenever I say he's hurt, to be at the competitive level and the other one is just not the sometimes same thing, you know.
Alex Kurdecha: Sometimes, sometimes you may do, but, but you, you know, that you can't be at their level anymore, you know? And then this is the, this guy, he's the best that there ever was, was, was, was, and me, I'm like, not so good. So if I beat Alex, I should get a shot at the best ever. Right.
Engin Terzi: So do you know how it sounds? If you beat someone with right arm, you want to have a best shot with the best ever jumpers or something. It doesn't make sense as of now. And that doesn't make sense as of now. Arsen you telling me Dennis is all washed up? Oh, with left arm, it seems so. But right arm... So you're saying Dennis is no good? I mean, that's not what I am saying. That's what he's saying. So, and you believe him? You believe he's no good? He's not asking for matches? If he had that chance...
Engin Terzi: He would do it and he would probably start with someone like, like, like me. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, listen, even, even, even when you were not really preparing left arm, you were still pulling.
Engin Terzi: I think Sanderis, you were still pulling against Bortalato, you pulled against Georgii Svetko, and you did very successfully. Even like you were not really inactive, you were not really terribly injured, but you were just focusing this arm. The guy's case is different. I understand you're very stubborn. We can talk about it probably three hours about this if you don't get the answer you like, but my friend, that's what it is.
Engin Terzi: horse guy you know with left arm but right arm probably looks like he is healthy now and from now he will start preparing with right arm maybe he will become that monster again and then we will see if if same as like 2023 Devon is pulling then his whole body or 2018 then he's pulling Devon's whole body the people are talking I don't know where it came from left arm
Engin Terzi: Left arm, left arm. Left arm rematch with Dennis. He is not obsessed to anyone else like that, you know, as he is to Denis. That guy. I don't know why. You beat the guy. Why? Yeah. You beat the guy. Why? Because he's a criminal. He beat him right, not left. He want to beat him also left. Oh, okay. Okay. I need to bring justice to Denis Saplenkov. Justice. How about we promote this guy match?
Alex Kurdecha: this guy is so smart and so big and so strong. And I am so low. And so I don't know if I have a chance with this guy. This guy is really good. I mean, and he's saying now he's going to beat me like really badly, like hold me and look at me. I mean, it's, it's going to be terrible. Like,
Devon Larratt: beautiful it will be beautiful not terrible i feel like i feel like i'm gonna get beat like worse than prime dennis beat me oh you're much more better now than when you pulled with dennis i saw you you was not good that day with dennis for sure he was not good um maybe maybe
Engin Terzi: I think it was like 50% from now, maybe 60, but you know. Devon, what's going on? Only like 20 minutes ago, after Alex talked that way, you said like now things change and this, and then 20 minutes later again, this guy is so smart, so big, so strong. Which one is the truth to believe? What are you going to do? Like at the beginning of the program, you said you were like totally underdog. Half of the program, you said you're going to
Alex Kurdecha: You sounded, you didn't literally say, kill this guy. And then now you are again saying, what are you gonna do? Just tell us. Well, it's not me that's gonna do anything. It's gonna be the referees. Ah, he's gonna help you. Okay. Yeah. Okay. The referees, because I feel like, quite honestly, I feel like the referees owe me a great debt.
Engin Terzi: If you count everything, I think you are in depth. If I count everything. Georgii or not? Tell me, after Georgii, there's depth after Georgii, yeah? No, no, no. He thinks that way, but if I just remind him, let's not go there. I feel like this time they let me start like this.
Alex Kurdecha: Start the match. Yeah. That is why he has been putting pressure on the referee. So they better pay the debt now. So that a lot of things will match will be fair. Okay. Right. Right. Then everything is settled. Everything is good. You know, the only problem is the only problem with that is then. Then you're Owen three and that's terrible.
Alex Kurdecha: And then Camille would demand a match with you and you'd be 0-4. Listen, Alex somehow doesn't accept a match with Kamil. Why would you? That would be bad. I know that he wants a match with you so I unfortunately need to win with you because after that he will ask you.
Devon Larratt: No, no, no. If I beat you, I'm above him. And it's, then it's, he can, you know, he has to, he has to be. He will not leave you alone, you know. He will, like, be, post the videos, do something, and say that his life goal, I believe his life goal is you. Like, he's obsessed by you, I think. Yeah, I don't know why that is. Yeah, I don't know why. Why does he do that? Maybe it's because I'm so huge.
Devon Larratt: probably yes like i obsess about myself a little bit when i get big like this oh yeah you're huge bro you see that lump i i see the face of camille buddy i see the face of him on that bicep camel's face yes there wait well let me draw it let me draw it here i'll get a marker
Alex Kurdecha: show me you got a marker i was actually i was going to draw some pictures today so this will kind of start things good let's see if we can do this yeah oh oh i broke it i broke the marker let me see if i can fix it that's why let me see if i can fix this there we go okay we'll draw a camel yeah yeah he's kind of like this
Devon Larratt: He's kind of like this, this is kind of always happy. It's kind of got a flat top there. Yeah. It looks like a little bit. Yeah. And what do you think about, look at this, look at this. Okay. Who is this? You know, that's camel.
Engin Terzi: Oh, that's coming. Listen, there is one guy that nobody wants to pull against it. That's coming. I mean, it doesn't matter, right? I think Tommy Tommy should be ranked number three. Why is he ranked? Why is he ranked so low? Because he didn't pull someone who is ranked about him. When Alex gave a good match to Morozov, I said, Oh, Alex, because the rankings with left arm is just, just shaping. And now
Engin Terzi: now i think i saw all three i need to make a new rule anyone who's going all three should be out of the top 10 ranking can't be going like two three four every time lose you know so i have a question so i have a question okay let's say hypothetically hypothetically because we all know that this is a very very low percentage chance hypothetically i'd beat alex in 20 days okay
Alex Kurdecha: Okay, and because he's gone then 0 and 3, he's like out of the rankings, right? So would I take the number 4 spot or where do you put him? I think you should. And anyone who wants to change it, they need to pull against you. But it doesn't mean that it doesn't give you the right to avoid. Okay, so where is ranked?
Engin Terzi: As soon as we have $350,000, we're going to set that match. We can make that match anytime. But listen, I will tell you something, just one second. Like how hard, okay, so you are not going to be 253 until you pull the one again. Am I correct? If I continue to win, I will. Okay, now I understand. Yeah, I understand the answer. Yeah. Okay.
Engin Terzi: But if I beat Vitaly... If you lose against Vitaly, and I know one thing that like you are not planning to stop your progress till August or something. Like your progress plan is just going to the next year, you know, and at
Engin Terzi: that you want to build, build, build. So do you really think that, like, just say that you lost against Laletin. Like, it is not the shape that you wanted to face, Lewa. So you want to even go into the bigger shape, better shape, stronger shape. This is what logic is saying. And just say that, just say, you know, you believe you're going to win, Laletin wins. Just say that if Laletin would win, and then you would face someone like Ermes.
Alex Kurdecha: Would it not qualify you again? I think that in the right hand, I do believe that still I'm right near the top. And I think that I think I'm still getting better, which is so crazy for me to believe that at 50, I really believe
Alex Kurdecha: that I'm still improving as an arm wrestler. Look at that. Right. That's the crazy thing. Like all the things that we thought about where, when you're the best, all those things are just completely 25 and 40, 45 maximum. Now it's just like up to 55, 60. Yeah. It's still possible. Right. I mean, Todd Hutchings is 59 a couple of days ago. Yeah. Yeah.
Alex Kurdecha: And I think that everybody believes, and he's proven that at 95 kilo, maybe the most competitive category that we have. So that gives me hope that I can do the same thing. Maybe even better. You know, maybe, maybe by the time I'm 60, you know, I can be as good as Alex, you know, maybe, maybe. How old are you now, Alex? Uh, 35.
Alex Kurdecha: 35. So I'm 15 years older than you. Yeah. But come on for Todd to do it in 55. I think, I believe you will do it until 80. I think so. I think, I think there's a good chance. So long as I live, so long as I live, I think I will continue to push.
Engin Terzi: um as long as it's healthy i think you can do it as long as you don't have any like problems with the health because health you know never happens i mean never know you know like i i also started training and somehow i i said i was dying i was collapsing once i was active the blood circulation started i trained wow like power is there even the size is not there power is like like really close like 85 already in one and a half months
Alex Kurdecha: So Red Jones says, tell Devon we need more members live and videos. Yes, it's true. I've been very, very bad lately. I have not been doing much there. I need to do more. I apologize. I will definitely do that. Maybe I will do one tomorrow.
Engin Terzi: Today, I'm going to draw a picture, I think. I'm going to draw a picture. I'm inspired. I think it's going to be your picture, Alex. You know, right? You are the victim. And Jay Ruther says, do you think Levan has any aspirations to become champion on the left arm? Do you guys think that Levan...
Devon Larratt: may try healthy if he will be enough healthy to train or 100 because he says that he don't want to train just for train he wants to be champion i think that when he pulls vitali i think that that will be a big inspiration for him say again say again when well here i am projecting but i think
Alex Kurdecha: Most likely. And look, I hope that Ermes does wonderfully. But I think there's a high chance that Vitaly pulls Devon. And when he does, I think that Devon will be like, hmm, maybe I can beat him left-handed. You know, I think that he'll probably think that. And he will be very motivated to get two gauntlets. That's pretty awesome.
Engin Terzi: nobody has done that in a long time it doesn't sound like what you said you realize what you just said you said you think you said no you said you think that laletin is gonna pull that one i did say that you said that yeah you're gonna lose him august oh now see i thought he was pulling him regardless no
Engin Terzi: If he beats him, he pulls it. And then if not, then maybe next February, next March. So you're saying when I beat LeLatin, he no longer gets to pull LeVon? Yeah, and LeVon said that. LeVon talked to me on the phone. I want to pull the winner. I said, you can't pull Devon in December. He said he needs more time. He said, okay, I wait until the February or March, and then he wants you again. So LeVon says pull LeVon.
Alex Kurdecha: He says, Engin, I want easy, easy paycheck day, he says. I'm going to tell you. You know how earlier Ermes was like, why are you facing Alex? Why are you facing Alex? He's so much stronger. And I'm like, yeah, whatever, I need the money.
Alex Kurdecha: but i i want to have good fight with alex we have arm wrestled a ton alex and i on the practice table okay and we both know practice is a good indicator but the match is final the match is final and we haven't had that yet and i'm looking super forward to that with levon and i we have had two matches and i know where levon is and that's why i'm very vocal about
Alex Kurdecha: How good I think LaVon is and how I think LaVon matches up with other people I know. You know, I said, I told people that I will not pull LaVon until I believe that I can beat him or have at least a chance, a good chance. So, you know, if I beat Vitaly and I mean, I think I'm going to beat him. I really do. And I think it's going to be a very hard match.
Alex Kurdecha: But I don't know. I think I need a good preparation, a really good one. And, and I would love to see LaVon look at the truth is LaVon has something else to clean up. He could pull somebody else.
Engin Terzi: Listen, you were 120 kilos when you pulled against him. Like, he never, like, I don't know, like, to see you, like, of course, it's not only about the weight, but I think you know what you are doing with that weight gaining. But I have a very funny one. Harold Rivera, Engin is very biased. This is how Engin protecting Devon. You're protecting me.
Engin Terzi: How are you protecting me? I don't know. Let me read the rest. Just like how we did with Ermes and Gennady, Engin will let the next opponent of Devon compete in short period of time while Devon is preparing. My friend, you are out of your mind. If Levan is pulling Devon in next March, that's a long time for Devon, but it is two months longer time for Levan. Like Levan will be pulling in June.
Engin Terzi: Devon will be pulling in August against Vitaly. And if they are pulling in March, and if they are not pulling in between anyone, so how is it protecting Devon? Do you guys have high IQ? Am I saying something wrong? No, no. I mean, I don't know these people seriously.
Engin Terzi: Sometimes I read some of the comments, I feel like I'm trying to understand those people if they are listening with their ass or ears or whatever. Never mind. Okay. Smart enough, people. Pay attention to what's actually happening here. Okay. Tell me. You tell me. You were saying something. Anyway.
Engin Terzi: So you are, you are saying that you are saying that, you know, how strong he is and what, you know, what it takes to like, I will tell you, do you think that you need more like center, like little bit more side or you, you want, you need again, going that way. I need much fun. I tell everybody that I believe that Lavon is the most dominant arm wrestler.
Alex Kurdecha: In the open division that I have ever heard of or seen or pulled to me, he's the best that there's been that I've heard of. He's better than anyone that I've heard of or, or pulled before by quite a lot. So, so respectfully, like, I mean, I've tested it once I've tested it twice.
Alex Kurdecha: know i would love to keep testing it so long as i continue to progress and think that i've got a shot and you know if if i'm legitimately ranked the number two or you know close enough where i'm worthy of a shot then yeah i want to do it i want to do it when i really believe with with my being that i'm coming to him with something better than i did last time so so yeah it it means that i have to be stronger i have to be stronger than before in
Alex Kurdecha: In all ways. My hand has to be stronger. My arm has to be stronger. My back has to be stronger. Everything. Everything. Okay. When you said your back needs to be stronger, is it true that you can't lift anymore? I haven't lifted in such a long time. No, no. You were doing those lifts. We don't see that anymore. Yeah, no. I haven't lifted in a while. Is it because you got hurt during the Levan match? Look, I'm normally a little bit hurt, but...
Alex Kurdecha: I, my back has been bugging me, but I actually think that this is probably just a really good way to train for arm wrestling. It's just right now, my training, since I started this, this entire preparation for Alex and for Vitaly, I've only been arm wrestling. That's it. Only arm wrestling. There's been not a single weight that's been lifted. There's not been any rehab that's been done.
Alex Kurdecha: I go and arm wrestle at night and the rest of the time I just kind of rest and go for walks or whatever. And I think it's really good. I think it's really good. Um, we'll see. I've done it before. I called it Ken Sai. I did it before. It's not, it's nothing new. Uh, you remember when you come here and visit me with together with Alan, I also mentioned about like pulling against like this.
Alex Kurdecha: I lately see you that and you were afraid that you would get injured, but looks like everything is going well. Yeah, I started to do this heavy table preparation for Gennady. And I think it worked really, really well. I think it's really good. Like the two handed work. It's just the thing is, is you have to have a really good team to do it. If if you have people who are
Alex Kurdecha: trying to beat you, then they can probably beat you. A lot of guys will be able to beat you with two hands and, and in that way you can kind of get hurt and that's risky. But if you, if you have guys who are willing to work with you or guys who are just weaker than you, that you can kind of hold when they use two hands,
Engin Terzi: The training is very, very, very good. Very, very smart. There is no lifting weight that can replace that kind of training if the guy knows what he is doing with you. Because even when you do that weight from floor to up,
Engin Terzi: you know, the pressure is more that way with the way that you are doing the pressure is more like to do also, you need to protect your side, you know, and then this pronated is not working that way, but it is more working to the opening your arm, like to the pin pad way, you know, not to straight forward. So I think that what you are doing now will be, Alex, is that showing to you? Alex, he says Kamil, but you say Kamil, but I don't know.
Engin Terzi: It's a kind of magic. I say that I see it on his hand and he make the picture and it's really quite similar. Alex, you tell us a little bit about you. I will tell you my opinion first. I think that your height, like hand height and your wrist hand strength
Engin Terzi: and your ability to go up to pin pad, I just can't imagine this match is not going to your winning side. I'm not going, I'm not saying it will go directly to pin pad, but I kind of feel like this is going this way, at least round one. And I would just, one second, I would just say, let me finish first, then you talk. And then you go that way, and then just say that you're already going that way.
Engin Terzi: I saw you beating Morozov with the deadlift pressure. So now, first thing is to take him to the losing side, and second is that. And I'm almost 100% sure that that is your game plan. You're pretty good, Engin. I need to mention that. But you remember the rules of armwrestling which that guy created. Remember the rules of armwrestling? You never take what's given.
Devon Larratt: if hands go there it doesn't mean that it's good scenario for him if like he goes there yeah he gave the center for example it doesn't mean that it's not according to his plan if he goes there like you said yeah you for example me take the center okay okay okay sounds logical after that go to very fast transition to club press and uh to use so body weight and my power because yeah i'm
Devon Larratt: or probably have it a little bit but like i said it can be with his scenario like it's not that uh he will be prepared for that i'm sure he will be very well prepared for that move and uh it sounds easy it's maybe sounds like a good scenario to to do it with that i'm agree with this but i'm sure that it will be not easy to like take his wrist go it's down
Devon Larratt: and make a fast transition okay it may not be easy but isn't it the plan it's honestly it's beautiful plan it's beautiful plan yes it sounds very good sounds very good but like i say though the rules of arm wrestling says that if somebody give you something don't take it don't take it
Devon Larratt: Because maybe he will give you... He will give you his wrist and you say, I'm not going to take it. He will not give his pronator. He will not give his hand. Okay, what's he going to give you? Do you think he is giving this? He will give the center probably. I think that they will come back to... I believe at the beginning he will do all the tricks on the setup, make a pressure on the fingers, make a pressure on the center or the back. But for sure when he will check
Devon Larratt: what my hand is, he will push his scenario. And I believe in his scenario. It's absolutely okay with him to go in that way. He do it so much time. He goes that way because he wants to give you a gift or because... No, because it's a trap. Do you think that if he would stop you at the center, he wouldn't?
Devon Larratt: If he stops me in the center, it means that he is just better. But you say that he gives you this. I mean, why would he give you this if he can just stop you at the center? Because it's boring for him. Look at him. He loves to do a long match, not a short match. He will not try to win me faster even if he's able to. He will not, for sure. Also, he is so good that he will be playing with you. Okay, I understand. It's his plan.
Alex Kurdecha: I don't think he has that plan. I think he will try to survive. I think that the word is delusion. This is my delusion. You know what's crazy is that in the staking, I'm ahead of you. I don't know what people are thinking. Why don't people believe in you?
Alex Kurdecha: personally you know that logically you have much more bigger number of the viewers you do a lot of content and they know you and they believe in you and that's why if if i was you i would be buying up all those blocks see that's what i would do i would just buy them all and then make so much money that's what he's saying good easy money i don't understand why that hasn't happened like i mean
Alex Kurdecha: There are people who are close to you who you'd think would just know the truth and just put all their money down. They may be waiting. They may be waiting to the big difference because, you know, if you put a lot, it makes rankings equal. So maybe they're waiting to the last moment. They might run out of time. It's there right now if they don't do it. I don't know. I don't understand. I would have thought that people all would be betting on you. You're the number four. You're bigger. You're
Devon Larratt: smarter you're younger and people are still just betting on me i don't get it i don't understand i know you love me i love you but you know if they watched the match with andre you know andre was probably a little bit stronger in something that day no then you know no no no no not me but i mean in some move not in everything he was stronger than you maybe a little bit oh yeah yeah yeah he was stronger than me for sure he was
Devon Larratt: But you would beat Andre, yeah? No, I mean that to be stronger is not enough. Because that day was a big surprise for all of Eastern and wrestlers. You were a big surprise. Because everyone watching you and they think, oh, come on, lefty, Andre probably will beat you easily. First round was not good for you. You were not in a good setup, I remember.
Devon Larratt: And after, when he was able to take the line, you just like make direction of his power to the empty field and control all the matches. After, in the end, it was a little bit sadly. Like, you know, he was trying all the best and it was absolutely not enough. Yeah, not that day. Not that day. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that wouldn't happen again, though, would it?
Engin Terzi: Unfortunately, he's not with us. Let's quickly cover the predictions. Thomas Thomas says Devon all the way. And then, okay, let's go. You said that Devon, you support Fia against Elin. And so you are also believing that she should win. And you, Alex?
Engin Terzi: Oh, Fia is very dangerous, so I believe she will be the favorite. Yeah, Fia is just really dangerous. We will see. We don't know where Allen is. And let's go with Pauline versus Arsen Khachatryan. Devon, you were there when Arsen was pulling against Alex Charkovic. Did you have a chance to watch the match? It killed him.
Engin Terzi: right that's what i remember i was in the back i think round one he lost and then he did some things and then somehow he tired him and beat him but do you do you think do you think that he can he can uh stop oh it's it's 95 kilo 95 kilo yeah
Engin Terzi: Good match. Good match. Just for your information, Arsen was 100 kilo when he pulled Andrei Sharkevich. He wasn't 105. So, like, they both weigh the same with Paul. They are probably losing a few kilos. Okay, so, but this one 95 kilo. Yes, yes, yes. I'm going to go with Paul.
Alex Kurdecha: but good match is it because of the east west thing or is it no i just think i think that actually paul um is really really good i think he's very professional i think that at 95 kilo i think it's actually quite a short list of guys that can beat him um and i think that those guys are guys who have been around a long time and uh you know the very very top of the sport
Alex Kurdecha: but I think in his relative peer group, I think that Paul stands out very well. So I have Paul to win that one. I don't think it's going to be easy. I think this guy is really good. I think he's really strong. If it is not easy because Paul is known with his explosive wins. Yeah, I know. I know, but it's not like he's got only a hit. Like he has good sustained power in that hook. He's got a,
Alex Kurdecha: And I'm not saying he's going to beat him. Maybe it'll take him like five to seven seconds. But I think for five to seven seconds, Paul is still really good. I think that that's actually probably where he's best. He even pulled a long match with Rustem Bavaev in Orlando. It was like near half a minute match. It still was competitive. It was surprising. Yeah, I think it'll be a good match. I think it'll probably go hook. And I think that Paul Linn is just very good there. And I think
Alex Kurdecha: He does the weight cut well, and I think that that might be just enough of a difference to get them to win. And then there is a super chat. Devon Green says, how many tricep presses can Devon get on Alex? Uh, can I get, well, I guess the answer would be three, right? Or is it, are we doing four to seven or three out of five? So I, I mean, I could get three, right?
Alex Kurdecha: could uh and stinky taco says alex will stream roll that one easy that one looks skinny i don't go over to uh go over to arm bet and and put your money down because nobody actually people say that he's gonna win and i think he probably is but nobody's putting money down and everybody thinks i'm gonna win and they put money down so
Devon Larratt: It's one thing to say it, it's another thing to alazan it down. Alex, how do you see this match? Paul vs. Arsen Kacetarian? Yeah, I know. I watch it. But you know, Paul to me is very special because of his match with Rastam. Rastam is awesome and how Paul, both matches, not only when he won because of injury with Rastam, but both matches, he was very, very good. And I think he is favorite.
Engin Terzi: Okay, so let's go to Ivan Portela versus Joseph Meranto. Do you guys know Ivan Portela? I don't know him, but Meranto I know quite well at this point, and he is awesome. Awesome. Yeah. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: i think if he wins if he wins this match then his next match will not be like a title match but someone high level from east this time because slowly let's see what yeah what a bicep have you seen his bicep yeah he's very strong he's crazy he's he's for his weight class he is massive massive bicep ridiculous biceps
Devon Larratt: Okay, Devon is buying his own block, and you know how good he is at predicting. I predict you're going to destroy me, Alex. So it's not good sounds for me when they say that. Probably worse than 50-50. Stop it immediately, my friends. Stop it. Alex, do you know Alan Forge? No, unfortunately not.
Alex Kurdecha: Okay, let me ask that one then. Alan Ford versus Ryan... Belanger. Belanger, yeah, I think, yeah. Alan's going to win. Alan is really good right now. Alan's been kicking ass around here. I've got Alan. And Alan's practically my neighbor, so I have to pick him or else he's going to come over and do bad things to me. But, yeah, Alan Ford is really good right now. He's...
Alex Kurdecha: uh everybody who trains with him everybody says everybody knows he's he's in really good form at the moment okay doretto says alex will pull devon's whole body with table 2025. you know what like can i say how much i want that dennis match tennis match so badly also alex he's gonna beat you with that motivation
Devon Larratt: Because he thinks that he's going to get... No, I still win him. I still win him, but I will help him with this match versus Denis. How are you going to help him? Tell me. I make the friendship between them because I think they a little bit hate each other. And when they do not hate each other, they will pull. Okay. Why? Why don't we hate each other and pull? That's even better. Mask him why he's here.
Alex Kurdecha: Okay. Okay. He won't even answer my DMs. I messaged him. He doesn't even answer me. Well, I think Alex is going to win because he has higher table IQ. Artem Morozov is not that smart. You know,
Alex Kurdecha: Just tell me, Devon, were you not impressed of Artem Morozov, honestly, in Tbilisi? I was very impressed. That was great. I was super impressed. But he tried to beat me up. What? Alex, he was sitting next to me and he was swearing at me in Russian, telling people he wanted to kill me and beat me up. So now I have to pick Alex. Alex now is going to beat him just because I want to keep this guy away from me.
Alex Kurdecha: I'm not allowed to pull him. I'm not allowed to pull Daddy Can. And I'm not allowed to pull... Dennis. No, no, Dennis I can pull. The other guy, the guy that Mike's pulling. Georgii Zernoff. Yeah, these three guys want to fight me. No, they don't want to fight you. No, they don't want to fight you. I've seen it all over. They're saying they're going to go to jail and stuff. You...
Engin Terzi: Listen, listen, I think that everything can be solved, yeah. So, listen, you say that Alex is going to beat Artem. Okay, this is what you are saying. Okay. Easy, easy. That guy is just a bodybuilder. Listen, after Alex beats you, will you still beat Alex Corner against Artem Morozov? I'm just, you know what?
Alex Kurdecha: If I'm still alive, he might kill me. Just say yes, buddy. You have nothing to say about the first part of what I said after Alex beats you. Look it, look it. I mean, everybody... There's like... Do you know, as a smart guy, Alex, have you ever heard of... What's that thing that happens in plants with the chlorophyll? Photosynthesis.
Alex Kurdecha: Have you ever heard of photosynthesis? You're asking Alex? Yeah. Have you heard of photosynthesis? Of course. I heard that the likelihood of photosynthesis happening is the equivalent likelihood of running through a forest with a blindfold on and somehow getting to like a treasure.
Alex Kurdecha: It's like impossible, but somehow it happens all the time because in this universe we have plants, you know, somehow that the likelihood of me beating you is kind of like the equivalent likelihood of photosynthesis existing, but you can't say it doesn't happen because it happens. It does happen.
Devon Larratt: But it was a question not about that. It was a question, do you will be in my corner in the match with Artem? No, no, no, no. Devon't change the subject, Alex. He already almost answered it. But now he's saying that he's going to kick your ass. It's what he's saying. What if you're so tired that you can't face him? So you will be helping me. Come on. How will I help you?
Devon Larratt: but uh because no no no no wait a second if you will be there he will be out on concentration you know how he wants to punch you and after if you will be there it will be if if if i beat you so badly that's enough well maybe i'd have to pull if you are too tired
Engin Terzi: No, because then you will probably try to cancel. Either way, I'm with you. You are going to try to cancel your lalatin match. Either way. I think he's trying to cancel his lalatin match. No, no, no. He said yes. Cancel lalatin match? Arsen you crazy? Look at this. Look at that. Oh, my gosh. Huge. I probably need to cancel lalatin match. Yeah, it's huge.
Alex Kurdecha: What does your body weighs now? 380 pounds. Okay, so... A little bit, 170 kilo. 170 kilo. Yeah. I mean, I'll try and get bigger, but for now, 170 kilo. But it's more like water. When you smoke, Gennady,
Devon Larratt: Buddy, when you pulled Gennady, did you was stronger than when you pulled Levan? Oh, yeah. Yeah. I also think that you were stronger. Way stronger. Yeah. Way stronger. Gennady was the strongest I ever was, for sure. But then I see Segoff kill him, so it doesn't mean too much. But come on, you can come back to that shape. Oh...
Alex Kurdecha: I am definitely coming back to that shape. Definitely. He's going to come with a better shape than that one. No doubt. I think so. I think so. I think I will be better. Devon, how do you pronounce this guy's name? Rickard? Rickard Bornman. Yeah. Against Wallace Dillard. That's an awesome match. These are the two guys that I want to see arm wrestle anybody more than anybody.
Alex Kurdecha: Allen the guys coming up is these two guys. So record Bornman, we've been talking about them. We've been watching them, um, South African born. Now he's like, probably, I think he's probably the best in Australia now. Um, I know him and Lachlan may be close, but I feel like, I feel like this guy is young and a ton of potential. You see his gym stuff. He's looks awesome.
Alex Kurdecha: And then Wallace Dilley, not a lot of people know about this guy, but he's making big waves in USA. I saw the underground tournament where he really beat up, uh, Marcio, which is. Yeah. So, um, I, I gotta say that I think that Wallace has got to be the favorite. Um, yeah.
Alex Kurdecha: I think so. I think this guy's the favorite. I think that the guy has a big background in strength, and I think he's converted it very well. Not a lot of people know about him, but everybody who knows about him rates him incredibly highly. And with the performance we saw against him and Marcio, you have to know that he's pretty awesome. Bornman is too. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's a great match. I really like this match. Alex...
Engin Terzi: Manuel Batalla, you know, you have been in Europe, you know the guy. He's going to pull against Wagner. A lot of people don't know about Manuel, but he's a champion with left arm, super heavyweight champion. How do you see this match? Do you think that he will be top of Wagner? He will be on the start because Manuel probably will top roll and if Wagner will lose the start,
Devon Larratt: It probably will be on the Manuel side. He's now in a good shape and he becomes stronger and stronger. He's now in a good preparation. But if Wagner takes the start and go inside, it will be his match. Do you think there is any possibility that Wagner's wrist is like this? I was thinking about that, but I don't think so. I don't think so. Okay. And Devon, do you know Manuel or not?
Alex Kurdecha: Oh, yeah. I love this guy's rock videos. Have you seen his videos? I was there. Man, that's the best. He's got the best. He's like the coolest rock star that we have in arm wrestling. And have you seen his videos? I mean, usually I see his cows and he's milking them. Yeah. Have you seen his music? Oh, no.
Alex Kurdecha: oh no no no somebody in the chat put the link to his like uh his his rock where he's got the girls and he's chasing around the field and there's the goats and the hay it's it's a cool guy very cool guy and he's very funny talking by himself and loud you know you know like like in the movies you have those uncles you know old uncles you know like talking yeah yeah yeah and who is winning that one um south america brazil
Engin Terzi: teramoto wagner board lotto two months yeah and another one micbook devon will you drink cola between rounds maple syrup yeah canada yeah yeah it would be good yeah
Engin Terzi: Okay. Then let me ask you your brother. Yeah. He thinks he's underdog, but, but directly hasn't been active six years. He does some practice pools while I have seen Matt competing with left arm. And how do you see this? Matt's left, uh, can be very good. Um, Matt's left is,
Alex Kurdecha: Over the course of the last five years, there's been times when it's been not that good. And then there's been times when it's been really, really awesome. Of course, I've got Matt to win. And I think it's a good matchup for him. I mean, I think he's going to take his hand. Oh, you think he's going to take his wrist? Yeah. Because when I talked with Matt, he said he's underdog. He will still do his best. But do you think that way? This is your...
Alex Kurdecha: i think i think matt will do very well i think that matt you know he's a right-handed guy and i think he puts a lot into his right he thinks about his right he's right hand dominant but the truth is his left is also very very good and it's just if it kind of shows up on the day because uh you know it kind of follows his right hand work but
Alex Kurdecha: Yeah, no, I I have Matt to win. I I think that. I've seen Matt be very, very, very good with his left. I've seen it many, many times and I think that. Yeah, I think that there's a lot of reasons why he can win and and I I believe that he is going to win. I I think that Iraq Lee is just he's he's on a losing streak and I think that he's just gonna. He's gonna lose and lose and lose and. Well, I mean,
Alex Kurdecha: If he just loosened his pants up just a little bit, he might do better. And it's just too tight. Too tight. Alex, this question for you. Michael Todd versus Di Serrano. Oh, very good match. Very good match. And...
Devon Larratt: I know that Michael now wants to come back. He wants to come back. He will try. He will try a little bit more and see if it is happening. If not, probably 115. It's not my place, but this is how I feel. Yeah. There's something after this match he will choose what he will do after. So I think he will take it very serious. And, you know, Zorano, I believe, can pull in the flop rest. He can pull in the triceps with the flop.
Devon Larratt: And it will be about endurance, I think. It will be about endurance. Michael will be for sure not easy for Zoranoff. He will be doing what he's always doing. And that's the question. Did Zoranoff will be comfortable to go in that position where he can be a long?
Devon Larratt: If he will go to that position, he will make Michael work from the position where it's impossible to come back. But if Michael will be taking his wrist too much earlier, then he will go to that triceps press and block by body. So it will be Michael. Ford me, it's like 51 for Michael.
Alex Kurdecha: Does Dzeranov have what it takes to beat Michael? I don't think so. Dzeranov is very interesting. Dzeranov, I've always thought that physically he was super, super impressive. And his stock for me rose massively in the match with Rivas. Like when he came out and he beat Rivas, I think it was about a year ago.
Alex Kurdecha: I was like, wow. I'm like, now I have no idea. And he was so good. I actually started to think he had a chance with Vitaly. We saw how that went. But and when you compare like, I mean, I know you can't really do that. But and the match that Michael had with Vitaly, I still I'm quite upset about that match. I think that.
Alex Kurdecha: I think that if you play that match back, I really think it could go. I don't think it was so dominant by Vitaly. I think it was a very close match and one that Michael could have won if things were just a slight bit different. I think that there's not a lot of people who can beat Michael. I think, and the same thing with Ermes, like a lot of people are like, Oh, Ermes totally. I think that that match was actually very close and very close, very, very close match. So I think that,
Alex Kurdecha: Michael is right at that world level, just, uh, just so close. And I think that he sits above discern off, um, who is also really, really good, but I think that stylistically, um, I don't think that really it's almost impossible to flash him, Michael. And that's the thing it's almost impossible. And then you have to have great endurance and be a good technician. Um,
Engin Terzi: which is difficult to do at that level of strength. So I have Michael as the favorite. Yeah, I have Michael to win. And I have it higher than... Can we discuss a little bit about the Michael vs. Vitaly match? Yeah. When round three, like round one, you know that Vitaly tried to beat him without a strap.
Engin Terzi: But, you know, even that there was fresh round when Vitaly's hand was so, I don't know, fresh, still he couldn't. And then Michael was able to go out. And then when round three happened, and then when Michael tried this, and then he went here, whenever we look at the video that they gave us, he was showing like this all the time. And then once they passed,
Engin Terzi: he was touching the power wasn't really yeah yeah yeah yeah and and i told to the camera guys give this to the stream because people will not understand we didn't understand until he was paused and then michael came to me and i said michael you know it looks that way can you please tell like if you touch or not and michael said can we look at the start of the match
Engin Terzi: And then if I started early, so he didn't say that he didn't touch, but he was, you know, the moment, but he didn't lie. He said the truth. I mean, he didn't say what it is, but he didn't lie. And he was, so my, my question is, I said, after the match, I said, Michael,
Engin Terzi: Like you could just go this way. Why did you try that way? So more we talk, I understood that Devon, when Michael is going that way, he has a resting point here, you know, because it's getting far from the guys. But it seemed like he didn't have that comfortable place because this guy's reach was so good. And the thing is that when Michael usually stops people, he climbs.
Engin Terzi: And, but this time the guy with the strongest grip was holding on. It was almost, and I saw at some point Michael's riser was just going that way. Like Vitaly was just making his riser, you know, go down that way. So what I just tried to say that maybe it sounded like Michael didn't want to go strap that point. He just wanted to do something to not to go there. That is what I understood from the conversation I had with Michael. And what happened in round one?
Alex Kurdecha: Like, what was that? Like, Michael, it looked like when the match was stopped in round one, and Michael was in fabulous position, there was an adjustment to the inside, and there was a stoppage, and then they kind of wiped everything. I don't know what it was, but I think the elbow fell. But then they called it back.
Alex Kurdecha: i think it was for something else was it for that no it was i think for the pin or what was it i don't remember no so it was it was round one the way i remember it is so the match is underway and michael actually was starting to transition the match onto the onto his side of the table oh okay so it wasn't it was the decision was taken back yes
Engin Terzi: OK, but it was you remember clearly. I don't remember. Was it for the elbow foul? It was an elbow foul call. But then they wiped it. So Michael's Michael is winning the match. He's on his way. It's round one. So he hasn't been good. I remember that his elbow came out from this side. You know this side of the right and that that's what we thought the call was. You sure that the decision was taken back or it was something else?
Engin Terzi: the decision was taken back okay this is the moment that was the decision was taken back i i believe so i believe what happened i need to go watch and and see what it was but but yeah because to me this has a massive impact you know because i felt that michael was on his way to win the match they called the elbow foul and then they throw it out when somebody is like this with michael it doesn't always equal to lose you know this is what
Engin Terzi: John did, this is what Ermes did. Ermes even just did it like this to him. Like Vitaly was also, any moment he wanted, he was bringing, you know, with the deadlifts. I am not sure if it was really winning or something, but I mean, we can discuss about it. But what I just tried to say that, that I don't think that like Michael was comfortable. You understand? Like more or less. And do you know, you watch the Prokopchuk versus Arthur match?
Engin Terzi: When Artur won the first round, when Prokofchuk was toppled, and in the second round Prokofchuk went inside and won, Christo, referee, told me, Daniel has very good endurance and he's going to win. And I said, within the match, yes, for sure, maybe Artur exhausts. But the thing is, I pulled Artur two matches. When Artur goes to the corner, Devon,
Engin Terzi: When he comes back, he charges somehow. Like you go 5% less, the guy just charges. And if you realize that last round, you finish like this. You understand? I kind of feel that like somebody told me this. I don't know if it is true or not, but it is the case with Ladezin. But if it was the case, then how did he end up with Dave Sheffield that way?
Engin Terzi: all those rounds you know he should be covered so it is confusing yeah it's confusing yeah so you are just saying that the guy doesn't have the tool to beat michael and you bought i don't think so yeah i i have michael heavy heavy earth favorite much respect to deserve it's just it's tough to beat michael todd okay then let's go to last match hermes versus uh levan alex you go
Devon Larratt: Honestly, all of us probably will put Levan like a favorite. And I absolutely agree with who much more deserves than everyone. And now it's Ermes. And maybe, maybe Ermes, this is the guy who can make the trouble for Levan. But I believe that Levan now will be much more like, you know, personal about this match than before.
Devon Larratt: He knows that he needs to be serious and his personal record on the biceps shows that he's trying to train hard and nothing like 50% or 60% he will go 100% for sure. Ford me, Le'Veon is a favorite. But, you know, some surprises can happen. I will be happy to see some surprises from Erman. Can I ask you something, Alex?
Engin Terzi: Did you expect Ermes to perform the last rounds like that, you know, against Levan? Just remember the first match. Did you expect, were you surprised when Ermes stopped and started doing this? You were surprised, right? Yes. Yeah. Yeah. So can I ask you something? Right now, do you see, like,
Engin Terzi: Like you said, you were surprised. Right now, for this match, if you see something similar, would you be surprised again or would you say no? No, not. Arsen you saying that Ermes now has probably more chance than last time, even though he may not win?
Engin Terzi: Do you think his chance is higher or lower? Because some people say that Levan wasn't in super shape and he said that now he learned a lot. I'm sure that Ermes also learned a lot. So do you think that before the match, what you thought about Levan-Ermes first match and second match, do you see the match closer? It doesn't mean that it is very close, but closer than the last time? Yeah, I will explain you my point of view. I believe Ermes now was trained very closely.
Devon Larratt: purposely, very purposely some position and he was prepared probably more effective than last time. Last time it was like improvisation and he just find out the way during the pull, you know. And now I believe he was trying to purposely do something special and he for sure did his best result. He put some extra power in the needed point. But
Devon Larratt: for sure Levan also now will be much more better. But, yeah, I see. Like I said, I will be not surprised if, for example, Ermes will be able to stop Levan's hand in some position. And what will be after that, I don't see clearly. But I believe that, yeah, that he can be able to stop in some position, yeah. Mm-hmm.
Engin Terzi: And Devon, Devon is just making his bicep like this. Arsen you, like, intimidated, Alex? Alex, can I ask you something? What keeps you from saying that, Devon, I'm going to come to Chicago and destroy you? Is it because if it doesn't happen like that, you're going to look bad? Or is it not your personality at all?
Devon Larratt: You know, a lot of guys say like that. A lot of guys say like that. If it's like my purpose to go on just one, for sure, yes. Ford sure, I want to go one. You just want to make it harder, right? Because easy win is not interesting.
Devon Larratt: Ford me, I really believe that it will be more, it will be earned respect from that guy if I will be just not flash pin him and won by accident or by refs or by something. But if he... You are afraid that Devon is going to complain it wasn't paid? No, no, no, no, no. Listen to what I said. If for me, it's very cool if after the match, that guy said, yeah, guy, you are really strong. You are like really good. You will make
Alex Kurdecha: some progression, you know, special progression, not that you pull in that only wide one direction. More Alex Cox, the more I feel like he's just going to hold you. Look at your face. Arsen you communist now? You know, that's what I understand. Yeah. That's terrifying. How demasculating is that? Like, I feel like I will leave there and I will actually be allowed to enter the women's division after Chicago.
Alex Kurdecha: I feel like my balls will just fall off my body completely after you kill me that badly. Okay, before you give your prediction, Jay Ruther says Arun should get shredded and tear up a lower weight class. Arun is actually getting shredded. He actually is. He actually, he's leaning right out actually. He was showing off his abs the other day.
Engin Terzi: Odin is actually... Odin has all these friends in the fitness industry now, and now he's... Yeah, I mean, Odin's arm wrestling every day like crazy, but yeah, Odin is actually getting fitter. So... Doreto says... Go, sorry, sorry. You might what? No, no, they might get their wish. Uh-huh. Doreto says, will we see Jordan Sone back in East vs. West or not? Someday? Probably, yeah. NG Blast says, Devon is beast mode...
Engin Terzi: And Lars says, hey, guys, I got my first tournament coming up at 198 pounds at 6'6". Is it worth cutting to a lower weight class or should I stick to my walk-around weight? Any tips for a lankier guy like me? I mean, I would say don't cut your weight, you know, but let's see what the other guys say. I think that at 6'6", 198, that's what he said.
Alex Kurdecha: That's pretty awesome. But I think if there is a possibility to cut weight, I think you should always do it if you want to have your best performance. I think that 198 to 187 is very easy. And then, I mean, that's, I think if the thing is, other people are doing it. If you're not doing it, then you're not on an even playing field. Just understand if you're pulling in the
Alex Kurdecha: 198 pound division. Well, the guys you're pulling are probably going to be 220. So you always like that's the game until it's otherwise you got to play the game.
Engin Terzi: Okay, Devon, let's go. Guys, please don't send more Super Chat because I may miss it while I'm listening. And one guy who's not, please miss Shagmi Vili. Thank you for your support. There's no Super Chat, but... And Dino, hello, Philinson, Devon. We'll destroy this dude, you know. Okay, guys, please don't send more. So don't be upset with me if I don't answer. Okay, Devon. Ermes, Gasparini versus...
Engin Terzi: Levan Levan Saginashvili. You pulled three times total. And just tell us everything. Is Ermes the same Ermes? If Levan is the same Levan? And what are the possibilities? And what are the chances of that possibility to happen? Yeah. Okay, so it's a wonderful match. It's for the biggest crown in the sport. The open weight right hand.
Alex Kurdecha: Uh, LaVon, I believe is the most dominant champion that we've ever had in the sports. That's a big deal. So every time he gets to compete, it's a, it's a big deal. Um, Ermias Gasparini young. What is Ermias now? 30? Yeah. 29, 30 or 31. I don't know around that yet. Right. So Ermias Gasparini, I mean, we've all seen his career. He's incredible. I mean, and he's been good. He's been incredible for a very long time.
Alex Kurdecha: You know, what I think is, I remember when they had their first match, how shocked I was. I remember their first match. I was so, because I remember going into the match, I thought, no chance for Ermes. I thought, no chance, just like the rest, he's going to fall. And then it was probably, well, it was for sure the best anybody's done against
Alex Kurdecha: Devon since 2017. Made the match really quite close. The fallout from that match, you know, there were a lot of questions, a lot of discussion, discussion about rules. And then you heard a lot of things to bring us to this match today. I mean, Devon has said things like, I wasn't in good shape. You know, that's a thing. And
Alex Kurdecha: And I think Devon is a very proud champion. I think Devon has very high expectations for himself. I think that Devon really doesn't like that there's all this discussion about the match. I think that Devon really wants to be like just the most incredibly dominant champion. Untouchable.
Alex Kurdecha: Like nobody's close. I think that that's the, the legacy that he wants to leave behind. And I think that he's doing that regardless of the outcome really. But, but, um, you know, this match is very impactful because, you know, if you were on Ernie's side of the discussion, you could say that really. Ernie's could have won that match depending on just a few little things.
Alex Kurdecha: So what I've seen over the last, you know, six months, Ermes is preparation has looked awesome. You see like, I mean, Ermes a while ago, he took some time off. He got in really good shape. He got his cardio back. He got really healthy. He went deep into the specific gym lifts, which I think, I mean, when you look at the percentages, how much he's gotten better since that match, I think way better, like maybe like 25 or 30% better.
Alex Kurdecha: Yes, like his riser lift, his pronation lift, like these are now really, really good, perfect form, excellent lifts. And you have to think that he's in the best shape ever, ever.
Alex Kurdecha: And you have to think based off of their first match that somehow he matches up well with LaVon somehow just based off of whatever that is. Somehow the matchup is good for him. I've seen LaVon, you know, uh, post like the curl was really incredible. Like the 400 pound curl. I mean, that's, that's crazy. They share another video, Georgii. And Emma said that,
Engin Terzi: LeMond was lifting heavier before that, the one-arm bicep curl. Ermes said that, Engin, did you see this? He said he was lifting heavier with the, you know, one dumbbell, you know, curl. Did you see the reason that they shared on the Georgii arm wrestling? So you're saying that he lifted...
Engin Terzi: like more like saying that in the past he was lifting that heavier the one arm then then the one that they share on the youtube like two days ago three days ago you know the one is not as strong as like his best shape i i have a feeling that levon is in really good shape i have a feeling
Alex Kurdecha: I have a feeling that Lavon is in the best shape that he can possibly be. I have a feeling that he really, really wants to make a statement. That's what I believe. And for me, it really, it just comes down to, to structure that you have these two great champions, really, really the best two of the best guys that we have in the sport. But the, the, the problem is the little Vaughn is just, it's just, it's just,
Alex Kurdecha: just so advanced with his structure, like his hand, his wrist, the bones, the bone, the bone density and the bone shape and size and geometry of Devon is just it's so, so high that I just I have a hard time imagining that Ermes can defeat him based off of anatomy. And because I don't see either one of them is technically
Alex Kurdecha: you know, that much better than the other. Like, I think they're both really, really masterful arm wrestlers, so I don't think that there's a big technical advantage. My only question, really, and this favors Ermias, is I never could really understand why in their first match that LeVon was never able to close in with his shoulder. And if he can't do that this time with Ermias' advantages and the way he's come up,
Alex Kurdecha: This could be interesting. If Levan, if it's close with the hand, which it might be, it might be enough to stop the match. I think Levan's hand will be stronger. I think so too. I also think so. But he may not dominate totally. I will tell you something. Like, first match, you know,
Engin Terzi: like when you go like over pronating like this it means that you are not able to control here to me honestly i will say levan's hand as a block like at the beginning position super strong but not i am not sure about his inner wrist here like to curl here so when you cannot control here then where you go is you over pronate once you over pronate
Engin Terzi: you're missing the pronators, and then you are over pronating. So you are becoming a bit vulnerable for the shoulder pressure. But the thing is that whenever you top roll Ermes, you had that copying as well, the copying as well. And Levan, I think, said to me that his weight and arms were so big, that's why he couldn't get closer.
Engin Terzi: So do you think that Levan can control Ermes' pronated and go sideways? Or do you think Levan will end up with over pronated? I think that the most likely scenario is that Levan can destroy him. That's what I think is most likely. Most likely. Yeah. Okay. Most likely.
Engin Terzi: What was the most likely? Can you please tell me? 60%, 70%, 50%? What is it? 75% to 80%, Lavon. Okay, then let's talk about the other 25%. Yeah, so look at, we don't know if,
Alex Kurdecha: If, if, if LaVon cannot pin him, if LaVon's hand control is not complete, like you talked about and Ermes is able to hang them up with his back pressure. Cause Ermes has an incredible arm for posting and curling and back pressure. If he can stop the pin with any kind of good position and make it about endurance.
Engin Terzi: What's the good position? Can you talk specific? What's the good position? Anything that's not on the pad. Anything. Oh, you mean even if he is that close? Anything. Now the question is,
Alex Kurdecha: is can he be in this kind of compromised position and, and not, and, and have, and have LaVon struggle again, like he did their first time to not be able to bring his shoulder forward. Because if he can play some kind of a waiting game with LaVon, the Ermes can maybe win that, you know, it's, it's just, can LaVon then finish with his shoulder? And, and we did not see that last time they pulled.
Alex Kurdecha: Allen his wins were top roll. And every time it stopped, Ermes was slowly creeping around, creeping around, and it looked like it was starting to swing into Ermes' favor. And if Ermes is stronger and Ermes can get to that position once again, then it starts to get very, very interesting. One more question, Devon.
Engin Terzi: Do you think that Ermes went to the first match with this strategy? No. No, he just went that way. No, what I just tried to say that, what if Ermes knew what he knows now, that if he would try, because once, you know, listen, when Levan takes your wrist and look at your face, you don't have confidence anymore. You just like, you understand?
Engin Terzi: But he said that whenever Irakli and other guys were laughing at him, he gets so angry, so he did whatever he needed. And then he found a way at that time. So what I'm just saying is, do you think that if he knew or tried very confidently right from the beginning such thing, do you think that the outcome could be different? I don't think so. I think that
Alex Kurdecha: I think that Ermias' takeaway from the match was that he needed to be able to do this and this more. It wasn't that he has this spot there, it's that he needs more of this to neutralize the match. I'm talking about the transition, transition that, you know, you know, other rounds he little bit stop him as well, but he never attempted that. But once he tried, it worked. But I'm just saying that if he would try,
Engin Terzi: this one of course if elmas would go directly to shoulder press he would get smoked he had to first go back pressure and stop him and then go transition but he never tried this before round three it's true it's true look at but they're both learning they're both learning at the same time it's a great match i can't wait i can't wait okay if the match is stopping
Engin Terzi: Do you think that Ermes has more than 50% chance? The more the match stops, the more it swings into Ermes' favor. That's what I believe. Do you think that if somehow Ermes beats Levan, do you think there should be a revenge match or someone should step in? I meant you, Alex.
Devon Larratt: Why is Devon laughing? It's fair because I think that you mean that Devon can step and pull with Ermes. I think you mean this. But if you say it, I think fair to our champion because Devon was with the crown so long. I think it's fair to give him revenge, you know.
Alex Kurdecha: Yeah, I agree with Alex. I mean, and the truth is, is that Alex and I can both beat Ermi so easily. It wouldn't be fair. Yeah. And then one last question before we add on. What's his weight right now, Devon? I think I saw him on a scale at like 231. 231. And what is the lowest he can go? 198? Probably not, right? I mean, look, I'm...
Alex Kurdecha: Telling him on, on is actually trying to get like healthy and lean and a little bit more ripped up these days. Uh, I look at he, I think that, well, I never liked to speak for Auden, but I've heard him say that, look at when I was, uh, so it was 1998. I won my first nationals at two 20.
Alex Kurdecha: And I think that Auden has that same kind of idea. He thinks that probably he can maybe win a Nationals before he's 23 at 220. So I think that that's kind of his goal. But I don't want to speak for him. Yeah, probably somewhere. I mean, look at him being like 230. 220 is easy for him any time. 200 would be a challenge. Yeah.
Alex Kurdecha: I mean, I'm sure he could do it, but I wouldn't really want to see him do it at this age. I think when you're 20, I think you should focus on. Yeah. Yeah. While you're young. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: We need to finish. It's a long, long one. I didn't do, we couldn't do the podcast, weekly podcast this week because I'm in Romania at the European Championships. I'm doing it from the hotel room. It was very fun for me. I know it was so long. Alex, just before we close, just give him a message. Devon't be so nice. You're smiling. Just so nice. You know, just tell him that you're going to destroy him. Come on.
Devon Larratt: I will say to all who will be watching us guys it will be fantastic match great match better than you can expect for sure so if you are there and you are able to be to watch live for sure this is the greatest day of arm wrestling because of our match but not only it's a great matches great night of the match so come and watch it and for sure if you're able
Engin Terzi: to buy pay-per-view and watch you will not you will not regret it really recommend it alex what what if you are too much for them you're gonna make it harder right so that you can keep your promise it will be awesome match you will hear we say that we go inside so i'm already happy no no but that's not what i am saying even you go inside if you are too much two times not feeling him and then
Engin Terzi: you just told to the people that this is gonna be awesome match incredible match and so it means that you're gonna make it harder right harder than sure for sure yes okay okay yeah you know you don't listen you don't provoke devon so i i do that instead of you you know so and devon any message to the fans your opponents um oh and three is the worst record
Alex Kurdecha: that anybody in East versus West in the top 10 has ever had. Terrible. That's the heaviest words, heaviest insult I have ever heard. 0-3 is terrible. Not even I am 0-3. Oh, my God. 0-3. No, that can't happen. What am I even thinking? Why would I say that? Why would I even put that out there that somebody could be 0-3?
Engin Terzi: Oh, oh, and three. I will say something to motivate you. I like it. Come in, beat Devon. And since then he's in a king life. He's the only one that can talk shit to Devon other than a level. So just imagine, you know, you beating him and then, wow. Imagine never go to Poland, never in my life.
Engin Terzi: never but the interesting part that you pull kami he beat you and he is still the one that want to pull you i tell you isn't that weird it is because the guy is crazy he would play anyone he believes he is the best he may be but he is not afraid of anyone coming i heard that you guys are like opposite so you have the highest iq that ever went to that university i heard he has the lowest that has ever
Alex Kurdecha: Gone to the like Polish high school ever, ever the very lowest. I don't understand how you can be so smart one way and be such so bad on the table and so dumb and so good on the table. I don't, it makes me think that arm wrestling and IQ have no correlation whatsoever.
Engin Terzi: Probably. I don't know. Probably. I don't know. Yeah. Okay, guys. Let's finish the program. And thank you, guys. It is great. Unlike some people, I disagree. There is a hype. To me, the math became even more interesting. I got what I need as an information. Like, why is this guy showing to you that it is coming? I think it's you. Because I asked him to write this.
Engin Terzi: You told him to throw Alex there? But why is he on the pronation? Because he didn't control his pronation. He beat him that way. He should be more like Bracky Radialis. It's an incorrect point. Ford now, for the next match, I understand. Yeah, we'll see. Maybe we'll get tattoos afterwards. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Take care, guys. Thank you. I'll crush you, Alex, in Chicago. Love you, buddy. Love you. You know what we'll be.
