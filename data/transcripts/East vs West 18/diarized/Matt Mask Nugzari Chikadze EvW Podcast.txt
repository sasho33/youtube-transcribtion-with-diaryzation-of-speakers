Engin Terzi (Host): good good you got ill again you you were again with like a tarzan outside with with the t-shirt in the snow in the snow yeah my friend gets sick so yeah happens it's fine you you three weeks illness from your friends yeah three weeks i have time to get ready uh-huh okay so how how are you
Engin Terzi (Host): I should say Nugo. How are you? Good? He said all fine, all fine. How are you feeling? Good, good, good, good. I'm fine as well. I see he is lifting 500 kilos on shoulder. He was a huge dumbbell, you know. How many kilos was it?
Engin Terzi (Host): 80 80 kilo one arm press wow like wow i mean like i mean i have seen some people did like 40 kilo 50 kilo but 80 kilo is just crazy crazy so how is the shape generally better than last time we saw you
Nugo (Nugzari Chikadze): Thank God everything's good. Perfect. I'm healthy. I'm training very well. And I can guarantee I will be nothing less than my last match for sure.
Engin Terzi (Host): Nothing less than my last match for sure. Nothing less. Possibly more, but nothing less. That's good. It will be a crazy, crazy match. I will not make him talk right now. I want Matt to hear everything so that he will not miss a thing. This is a very exciting match. Very, very exciting match.
Engin Terzi (Host): So I'm just sharing on social media the link and then we can we can
Engin Terzi (Host): So Nugo, where do you think you are? I saw you are writing some crazy stuff on social media and some paranoid people are thinking that we are making you write those things.
Nugo (Nugzari Chikadze): What would you like to say to the audience? What would you like to say to the audience? I think this is a very interesting question. I think this is a very interesting question. I think this is a very interesting question. I think this is a very interesting question.
Nugo (Nugzari Chikadze): Yeah, you know, Matt should be ready. I'm very angry and I'm ready to win against him very, very bad. And I'll do the thing that he expects the least. I'll take his wrist. He thinks it's not going to go. I will take it. I'll break his wrist. He's going to break his wrist? Like in Jordan, you say, yeah, break his, like, take his wrist. Take it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I just can't wait, you know. Okay, we still have...
Engin Terzi (Host): Let me write to Matt that we are already there. So what is the thing that you
Unknown: You said that you're gonna beat Matt first and then you're gonna beat Devon after. Like, do you really mean it? Do you believe you can beat Devon? I don't know how to explain it. I think it's the same for me and for Devon. I don't think it's the same for both of them. I think it's the same for both of them. I don't know how to explain it. I think it's the same for both of them.
Unknown: The first thing he did was to go to the church. There was nothing else he could do. And that's when he realized that he was in a very bad situation. He was in a very bad situation. And after that, when he was with Peter,
Unknown: Yes, it is true that there are many people in this form, and there is money, and everything can be done with the help of money. But I don't mean to say that there is only 10% in all, but the way money works, the way it behaves, it doesn't work for anyone, and I think that it will last for many years. In my opinion, I don't know how long it will last, but I think it will last for 99% in 15 years.
Nugo (Nugzari Chikadze): You know, when I look at Devon, of course, he's a legend. Nobody says anything against that. But when I see his matches, like, let's say, one of my first match, when I look at it, I think if I was at his place, I would win so easily against him. Okay. Who is his place?
Nugo (Nugzari Chikadze): Petrenko, right? Petrenko was the one who won, right? Petrenko was the one who won, right? Petrenko was the one who won, right? Petrenko was the one who won, right? Petrenko was the one who won, right? Petrenko was the one who won, right? Petrenko was the one who won, right? Petrenko was the one who won, right?
Nugo (Nugzari Chikadze): but still uh when we pulled the after pulls after that match i would say he he wasn't pushing a hundred percent but i would say that when i grip up devon is by far the most comfortable hand i ever gripped i feel so good against him i won't say i'm gonna beat him in heavy weights super heavy weights i don't say that but i said in my weight in 105 i would beat him okay so he really means it yeah
Engin Terzi (Host): Okay, CD Falcon. Hello, Nugo and Matt. Engin, do you know the date of the Ermes versus Levan match? I want to get VIP but need to get work off in advance. My friend, soon to be announced. Yeah. Hello. Hello, Matt. How are you? He's lagging. Yep. Matt, you're
Engin Terzi (Host): picture yeah okay now it's okay i think how are you i'm trying to yeah i'm trying to fix it i'm all right can you guys hear and see me yeah yeah yeah we see you good yeah do you feel better than last time we saw each other uh during the podcast i'm gonna i'm gonna have to i'm gonna have to go inside the shack here because i got shit fucking service
Engin Terzi (Host): Okay, okay. I'll see if I have better Wi Fi. Yeah. But right now you hear us, right? Yeah.
Engin Terzi (Host): Alex, tell me about this. Now everything is okay, yeah. So this guy, Matt, this guy said that he is going to break your wrist. Who? Nugo. Nugo said that he's going to break your wrist. Your internet is not doing so well.
Engin Terzi (Host): okay let's continue with with nugo until uh matt has a better connection so you are saying that you are not gonna beat only matt but you are also gonna beat devon this is what you are saying nugo yeah and i understand but you are saying not the super heavyweight devon but the 105 devon and yeah so who do you think who do you think uh nugo is the most dangerous guy
Engin Terzi (Host): on your way before uh having a match finally against Devon if you think that you are going to beat all the guys you know on on your way
Unknown: One of the things that I like the most is playing with the ball. And you can imagine that you can't go to the gym without the ball. But as a sportsman, I like to play with the ball. And the most important thing for me is the mask. Because, as you can see, I wear a mask when I go to the gym, but I don't wear it. That's why I started playing with the ball.
Unknown: Ford example, if I had a friend who was physically more than 10 years older than me, he would be very happy to meet me physically. But if I had the privilege to meet a new friend, I would be very happy to meet a new friend.
Nugo (Nugzari Chikadze): I would say Matt is the most dangerous on the way to Devon. I think the hand size is a big advantage. Maybe. I'm not sure yet. We'll see at the table for sure. But for now, I would say you usually get more privilege when you have the bigger hand, you're bigger than your opponent. If everyone in my weight class would have the same hand size as me, they can be 10 times the athlete that I am and I would still find a way to win.
Nugo (Nugzari Chikadze): I think it's possible that I would lose to Matt and still beat Devon. I think it's really dependent on how you feel against the arm and how comfortable you are. That's very interesting. That's very interesting. So he is thinking that Matt may be as dangerous as Devon? As far as I know, if Matt were to win, Devon would be the most dangerous.
Unknown: Yes, there was a lot of talk about Devon, but there are a lot of rumors about Devon, because Devon is physically strong, he is a genius, but he is a bad guy. He has a lot of weaknesses and a lot of disadvantages, and he is a very good sportsman.
Nugo (Nugzari Chikadze): He may be more dangerous than Devon, but still I would say Devon is stronger than him and he's much smarter at the table. You can call him a genius at the table. Matt, on the other hand, he's very weak and even if my plan fails against him, I'll just find another way to beat him.
Engin Terzi (Host): Okay, did you hear all this Matt? He's saying that he's saying that
Engin Terzi (Host): He's going to break your wrist. So I will tell you what you missed first, and then you can answer. He's going to break your wrist. They fill me in. I'm excited to hear what he's got to say. And then he said he trained with Devon at the side table. He says that he knows that Devon didn't probably give his everything, but he says he feels very comfortable. Not the super heavyweight Devon, but the 105 Devon. He believes he can beat. And he said, you may be more dangerous.
Engin Terzi (Host): for him like more uncomfortable compared to Devon but he thinks that Devon is stronger than you but there is a possibility he may lose against you but beat Devon or something like this but just tell him Alex there is no pulling Devon if he is losing to Matt anyways you know.
Unknown: You can play with me, but not with Devon. If you play with me, Devon won't play with you. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Nugo (Nugzari Chikadze): Of course, of course, I know. I'm just saying it from the sport perspective. I know for sure that I'll beat Matt as well and Devon as well. Easy. I'll beat Matt easy. I'm sure. He said he will beat Matt easy? He said? Yeah. He just said that there is a possibility that Matt may be even more dangerous than Devon. Yeah.
Unknown: Yes, I think it's important to say that sports fans from all over the world are interested in him. I don't think there is a problem with Larratt. We believe that if Larratt wins this match, he will become a candidate for Larratt.
Unknown: I don't want to say that I don't like it, I don't want to say that I don't like it, I don't want to say that I don't like it, I don't want to say that I don't like it, I don't want to say that I don't like it.
Nugo (Nugzari Chikadze): Yeah, I just said it from a sports perspective. On the way to Devon, he's probably the most dangerous one. Of course, everyone tries to get the path and get the title shot. I would just say from Matt, it's the hand size, the privilege. That is a privilege. And just from my experience and the way I'm pulling, I'll make him lose that privilege at the table as well. Okay, Matt. Now, finally, you heard everything and you want to say anything to this guy?
Matt Mask: so to say i got nothing to say he's a little man with big dreams so i tell you right now i am the most dangerous in that 105 kg class i don't care who comes back into that class that class is mine i am going to run that class and i'm going to walk through every single person that stands across the table from me so yeah he he he said devon without mentioning his name
Engin Terzi (Host): yeah he didn't even get to get a chance at devin so no no no no you just mentioned you just mentioned devon without saying his name you said that you don't care who's coming back to that category you meant devon i don't care if it's devon that's what i am saying that you you you you are like everyone everybody anybody that comes in 105 kg
Nugo (Nugzari Chikadze): I am going to run that fucking class. That is going to be my class and I am going to run it for many fucking years to come. So... Yeah, Alex. I am very happy to be here with you, Mr. Nugostano. I am very happy to be here with you, Mr. Nugostano. I am very happy to be here with you, Mr. Nugostano. I am very happy to be here with you, Mr. Nugostano.
Unknown: It's not a big deal. It's not a big deal. It's not a big deal. It's not a big deal. It's not a big deal. It's not a big deal. It's not a big deal. It's not a big deal. It's not a big deal. It's not a big deal. It's not a big deal. It's not a big deal. It's not a big deal. It's not a big deal. It's not a big deal.
Unknown: Why don't you talk to him? Why don't you talk to him? Why don't you talk to him?
Nugo (Nugzari Chikadze): No, what can I say? You're just a very tall man who screams a lot. I watched a lot of matches. He said you are a very tall man who screams a lot? Yeah, a very tall man who screams a lot. I've seen a lot of matches when you lose and the screaming stops. If that's your true feelings and the demons that you say you have, all the screaming, where does it go when you start to lose? And I see you many times with head down. It's called the sports orgasm, man.
Matt Mask: That's what it is. That's how I release it, right? So it's all that buildup, that hype, that everything else. What's there to release if I fucking lose? If I lose, I got to rethink. I got to get back to the thing. It's no, I'm in fucking charge. And that's just the release, the dump of the adrenaline. So you'll get to witness it straight fucking hand. He's going to be able to witness it right across the tail. I'm going to be four inches in front of his fucking face. And he's going to witness it all first fucking hand. So...
Nugo (Nugzari Chikadze): Actually, I don't know how I feel when I see you, but when I see you, I don't know how I feel. But you are my friend, I will be with you for 15 minutes and I will tell you everything, how I feel, how I feel and how I feel emotionally. But I am interested in the fact that you say that you were born here, that you were born here, that you were born here, that you were born here.
Nugo (Nugzari Chikadze): No, I just can't wait. When I take your wrist, I want to take a picture of your face. That, that, that look in your eyes, I'll print it and I'll hang it on my, on my wall. I'm not, I'm not RVG. So Robby, Robby, Robby, Robby.
Unknown: If you go to Britain, you will find a lot of children there. How do you know which one is the right one for you?
Matt Mask: Rob is much stronger than you. The last time you lost against Brad, that boy, he just humiliated you. Yeah, you don't even... There's many things that led up to that. Many things. But I'm not a man to come up with fucking excuses. Shit happened. Brad had a better fucking day that day. So how has everything looked since then? You think you can do what I did to fucking Marcio? You think you can do that, Hugo? No.
Nugo (Nugzari Chikadze): Can you do what I did to Ongebaev? Can you do what I did to Ongebaev?
Unknown: First of all, how did I feel after the operation? And after the operation, what was the condition of the patient? I understood that the patient was not in the same form as I was, and the patient was not in the same form as I was. And secondly, I was very worried about the patient.
Nugo (Nugzari Chikadze): You know, I would say Ongarbaev is a great athlete. Let's begin with that. He's very, very good. But he was coming off surgery and it was his first match. I would say he wasn't even 90% of what he was before. And I'm sure that if he was in a good shape... Pretty sure if he was 70% of what he was before, you wouldn't have been able to do what I did to him. So... Ongarbaev came into the match, he accepted the match. He said, you're the bird or higher. So...
Unknown: He says to Peter, if you want to go to the city of Oganbayev, I will be the first one to go to the city of Oganbayev. If you do not want to go to the city of Oganbayev, I will go to the city of Oganbayev. And Peter says to Peter, you will not be able to go to the city of Oganbayev.
Unknown: He would tell you what to do and what not to do. You would go to the ball and you would score a two-meter goal. What medal would you get? You would have nothing to do with it. You would have nothing to do with it. He would tell you what to do and what not to do.
Nugo (Nugzari Chikadze): You know, yeah, you could compare all day. Let's say I can do it my way. The Petro, he never lost the wrist on the first hit. I opened it right up, right back up. Can you do that? I can say that as well. I don't care what you did yesterday. Let's say you found two medals or the match you won. It matters what is happening right now. I'll get you to the table and I'll repeat myself just like did with RVJ. I'm going to make you look just like you look against Brad. Yeah.
Matt Mask: I can't wait. I can't fucking wait. So all I can say is you thought it was a bad day in Tbilisi when East versus West was there. It's going to be a bad day for you in fucking Turkey. So, yeah, it's going to be a bad, bad day. Right now.
Matt Mask: Right now, the way I look at it is there's a bunch of stones in my way that I got to overcome and I got to step across to be able to get to where I want to be, where I know I'm going to be. And I don't even look at you as a stone. I look at you as a little pebble. You know what I mean? A little pebble that got lost in the sole of my shoe. So it's going to be great. I'm looking forward to it. So I'm excited to be able to stand across the table from somebody that might be able to match my energy.
Nugo (Nugzari Chikadze): It was very interesting for me, but if you go to Turkey, you will see that I am now sitting in front of my chair and I am sitting in front of my bed, but you are sitting in front of my bed. But it was very interesting for me, and it is very nice that you have brought my energy to this country.
Unknown: Let me tell you what, Alex. I was sitting in front of the car, and I saw a card in front of me. A card in front of you? Yes, I remember that moment. Let me tell you what. I was sitting in front of the car, and I saw a smoke coming out of the window.
Nugo (Nugzari Chikadze): You know, just to get your dreams on the May 10th, I'm going to win against you. I'm going to beat you. And then I'm just going to take you on a stage and I'll make it really calm. I'll talk how good of an athlete you are, how good your sportsman you are.
Matt Mask: No problems. Matt, he says that he's going to beat you and he's going to make a speech. First of all, I just want to say, Engin, that your translator this time compared to Angubayev is fucking tenfold. Such an awesome fucking job. Thank you. I just want to congratulate you on that first, right? Thank you.
Matt Mask: And Nugo, it's all good, buddy. You know what I mean? It's all good. After you're done drying your tears, if you miss your flight, I'll lend you my shoe, and you can canoe over to fucking Georgii from there, okay? If you want to go to Georgii, no problem. I'll give you a ride, and you can go to Georgii.
Unknown: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Nugo (Nugzari Chikadze): Yeah, sure. Thank you. And if that happens, I'll take your shoe very gladly. I'll even spray it. I'll spray it with some deodorizer for you. I know it's going to be sweaty as balls when I get there. My feet are probably going to stink like fucking sweaty ass. So I'll make sure I put some nice spray in it so at least you get the good oxygen, right? He advised you maybe you should take a haircut before the match because when it happens and when you're there, your hair is going to stand up like this, like in tennis. Like this? Like it is right now?
Matt Mask: like yours right thanks i got the option in the front right i just can't do it so much in the back right i just can't do it so much in the back i'm out working right now i've been been up all night slaving away work for a living nugo
Nugo (Nugzari Chikadze): When I hear what you say about Ongarbaev and you're so proud about that win and you say look how what I did to him it makes me even more calm because just I'm gonna beat you even worse because of that.
Nugo (Nugzari Chikadze): It makes me very calm when I hear the stuff you say about how prideful you are about winning against Ungerbaev with surgery. I'm sorry, I was eating Skittles. I didn't hear that. You said, you know, when I hear what you say about Ungerbaev match and how prideful you are about that match, even though it was Ungerbaev of surgery, you know, it makes me feel even better. I'll win even easier when I hear the stuff that you say.
Matt Mask: Yeah, I'm sure. I'm sure if he'd done it, he'd be saying the same thing. So. Little different. Uncle Bob was pretty confident going into that match. I'm sure I can contest that his lifts were as good or bigger than they were before.
Matt Mask: Maybe it was confidence. That's what he said, yeah. Ungarboev said that his shape was as good as before, but I don't know. This is what he said here, you know. Frank, if that's the case, if that's the case, then you better fucking line me up with LeVon. Because I'm fucking telling you, I'm so fucking strong right now, it's un-fucking-believable.
Nugo (Nugzari Chikadze): What do you think, Ongar 5? What do you think, Ongar 5? What do you think, Ongar 5? What do you think, Ongar 5?
Unknown: Allen sports fans believe that he is in good shape, but the reality is that after the surgery, he was in a bad shape. He was in a good shape, but he was in a bad shape, but he was in a good shape, but he was in a good shape, but he was in a good shape.
Unknown: I think that's the most important thing for me. I want to be like Roby, I want to be like you. I want to be like Devon, I want to be like you and I want to be like Devon and get a bonus from you.
Nugo (Nugzari Chikadze): when you say, yeah, sure, Angerbaev may be lifting as much weight, but it was his first match of surgery, and we all know that it takes time to heal, and the weights don't exactly correlate to the table. I'm sure you know that bodybuilders, they lift more than us, and they still can't win against us in arm wrestling. And what makes me really happy, I won against RVJ, I'm going to win against you, and it looks like I'm going to beat every friend of Devon before beating him as a bonus as well.
Nugo (Nugzari Chikadze): Who the fuck is RVJ? I don't even know who that is. I knew who he was, but nobody knows who the fuck he is anymore. Nobody cares.
Unknown: I am not interested in it and you are not interested in it either. I am interested in the fact that you have nothing to do with it. You are not interested in it. You are interested in the fact that you have nothing to do with it. You are interested in the fact that you have nothing to do with it. You are interested in the fact that you have nothing to do with it. You are interested in the fact that you have nothing to do with it. You are interested in the fact that you have nothing to do with it.
Nugo (Nugzari Chikadze): No, I don't care about RBJ and you either. I hoped RBJ would give me something, but my hand didn't even get flexed against you. I hope to get at least a good training before Devon, you know. But I'm sure you'll be very surprised and disappointed when your hand and your wrist goes away at May 10th.
Engin Terzi (Host): Does he hear me? I think he's gone. That was some good trash talk. Oh, are you back? I didn't hear a fucking thing you said. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm sure it probably wasn't important though anyways. He says that the internet in fucking Canada probably is not good. That's what he said. He said what? He said that the internet in fucking Canada is not that good. He said that.
Matt Mask: yeah maybe it's not but he'll find out i won't say much for him okay it's very nice actually bill to have a conversation with nugo where it looks like i'm looking him in the eyes
Nugo (Nugzari Chikadze): Because I have a feeling when we get there, it's going to be a whole lot of nose to nipples the whole time when we're having conversations in person, right? Right now, it's almost like we're the same height, right? It's like talking to a normal person. Yes, you are right, and I would like to ask you a question. I know that you can speak Turkish, but I would like to ask you a question. I know that you can speak Turkish, but I would like to ask you a question. I would like to ask you a question.
Matt Mask: yeah while talking about that don't forget you have to you have to make one of five don't eat so much dude dude i'm fucking like 233 right now that's 233 like he means he's 160 i'm all fucking i'm all i'm 233 pounds i'm 106 and a half kilos right now
Matt Mask: I'm all hand, cock and fucking forearm, man. There ain't nothing left. I put my fucking forearms away and I hide and I disappear. You know what I mean? My legs look like two fucking, two bird's legs sticking out the bottom of a bird nest right now. So...
Nugo (Nugzari Chikadze): No, I can't wait to see a two-meter tall guy make one of five weight. You know, your t-shirt's probably going to look like a dress. No. He has always been, like, almost, like... This finger right here is bigger than my fucking legs. I walk around, I haven't weighed in.
Matt Mask: uh how old are you made in more than 248 pounds fully clothed eating cheeseburgers like dude i walked around 238 pounds when you see me you're like oh he looks so big that's a 240 pound matte mask right
Engin Terzi (Host): It's nothing if you lose eight pounds of water. Nothing. There is a super chat. Neil's index finger says Nugo is very strong, but Matt's lever and the explosion that is going to happen on goal is going to make this match look like the Krasimir match. Do you know who would be the best person to judge this match? I think it would be Krasimir Kostadinov. He
Engin Terzi (Host): both of you and he was defeated by both of you. But I know right now he's in great shape. Maybe you guys meet again later. But he would have, I think, the best prediction about this match, my opinion. Let's get him on the phone.
Nugo (Nugzari Chikadze): call them up okay call them up right now okay everybody thinks because everybody thought i was going to get my ass handed to me by young gabayev too so he's asking you how old are you matt
Nugo (Nugzari Chikadze): I'm 43 years old, man. 43 fucking years. No, you know that you're that perfect age that when I break your arm, it's never going to heal again.
Matt Mask: gonna be like a son to me right be like a little boy walking beside me when it's all said and done right i've always i've always wanted a little person as a friend i really hope that none of this goes to heart and that after this is all said and done maybe me and you we can get an apartment or something together right like like we go out on the night on the town i can hit them high you can hit them low right together nobody can defeat us right well together one you know
Nugo (Nugzari Chikadze): I would like to thank you all for being here with me today. It's a great pleasure. And everything that you do, it's my pleasure to know that there is nothing wrong with you. And I would like to thank you all for coming here today. And I would like to thank you all for coming here today. I would like to thank you all for coming here today. And I would like to thank you all for coming here today.
Matt Mask: no no have to worry about that i'll get a chair at the face off wait i think i know what he said i know what he said did he say my mother always told me good things come in small packages did he tell you that
Matt Mask: Did you say that? That's why it sounded like he said. I don't know. I'm trying to learn Georgii, right? But I'm not very good at it yet.
Unknown: Perfectly right, yeah.
Nugo (Nugzari Chikadze): You're like a little... You get closer to the camera. In that perfect little package, it's going to be inside that perfect little package. It's going to be a grenade that will go off right in your arm. I can just hold you. We can like...
Nugo (Nugzari Chikadze): We'll put you in my pocket and I'll take you for a stroll down by the water. We'll go feed the kittens together. We'll go feed the kittens. Nugo, Nugo, what is your chance of winning in your opinion against MET? How confident you are?
Unknown: My physical condition is very bad. The only thing that can make me feel good is the fact that I have a lot of weight on my shoulders. When I go to the gym with my weight on my shoulders, I feel that I have a lot of weight on my shoulders. What percentage do you mean?
Unknown: I was 30-30 years old at that time, because I was physically very young and I was very young at that time. However, I still remember it because I was very young at that time. That's why I was very young at that time, because when I was young, I was very young at that time.
Nugo (Nugzari Chikadze): I would say I'm stronger than him in basically every lane. And the only advantage that he has is the hand leverage. And even that, it will go away at the table when the knuckle will start to show. I would say 70-30. And my side pressure is just so much stronger. You never felt anything like this. I'm sure I haven't. Even if you take my hand somehow, still I'm going to be so much stronger that it's not going to be a problem. Okay. Okay.
Nugo (Nugzari Chikadze): Yeah, we'll see. I don't remember. Have you win any matches without the wrist? Yeah, I can pull there. Yeah. Okay.
Engin Terzi (Host): Todd and Oleg's love child says, I love Matt, but I think Ungarbe wasn't his true self. This match will tell us more, I believe, he says. And another one, The Perfect Lure says, Nugo is very strong, but Matt will destroy him.
Engin Terzi (Host): This is what he says. Yeah, okay. I mean, that's very interesting, Matt. I really don't know. Like, I mean, Matt, you lately look really different. I mean, even now, when I look at you, you look healthier than before. Maybe that's me, but you look healthier, you know. You look younger, you look healthier. Either the light is hitting your face right now, or you are really... What do I want like this?
Engin Terzi (Host): do i look old as balls now or what ah no it's still still you look good i mean still look uh healthier yeah but uh yeah your match your match with barboza was impressive and the last round i think you went inside with him he won but still i would expect it to be easier inside but you you went inside and it was it was still like good performance
Engin Terzi (Host): I think your internal disease. Oh, okay, yeah, you're back. There we go. Allen I heard was my match with Barbosa. Yeah, yeah. I said the last round, I think you went inside intentionally. And I would expect him to win easier that round when it goes inside. But it still wasn't that easy. And so I thought that you are in different shape right now than before. This is how it seems. And I have seen you beating...
Engin Terzi (Host): Marcio some years ago again this was probably as easy if not easier than that time and I don't know that that's very interesting match Matt like you are very confident and people who support you like Devon is very confident but when you go to the Nugo side all the Georgii are also very confident like and you both are a bit you know cracked at the table and you guys are coming like
Nugo (Nugzari Chikadze): Well, it's more like this, right? I think it's a good question, because all the Georgii know that there are thousands of people from all over the world who live in Istanbul, but I think that this is not the case.
Unknown: Yes, that's right. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so.
Unknown: No, I love it.
Nugo (Nugzari Chikadze): Yeah, you know, I love pulling people like you. I never like matches when people are like, oh, yeah, I'm going to lose anyway. What's the point? I really like when one of my opponent is very confident. So when I beat you so easily, I just I can't wait to see your disappointed face. And, you know, in the last round, I'm not going to flash pin you. I'm just going to hold you in the center. And you just tell me where you felt short. I want to hear what did you like in the match? Oh, he is a psychopath, Matt.
Matt Mask: That's all good. I really could care less. I'm confident. I think I'm going to fucking sweep the floor with them. But at the same time, I'm nervous as fuck because I don't want the possibility of me losing to somebody so tiny, right?
Matt Mask: so it's yeah it it scares the hell out of me for a possibility that i may lose so and i can't go into matches thinking i'm gonna mop the floor with this guy because every single time i've ever stepped across the table from somebody and i've thought that i'm gonna mop the floor with them i've got my ass handed to me so
Matt Mask: So yeah, I do think I'm going to fucking whoop you, but I'll tell you right now, I'm nervous as fuck. And I'm going to put in you, I'm going to make you 10 feet fucking tall, 400 pounds in my mind before we get to the table. So something nobody on this planet has ever been able to do, but that's where you're going to be. When you step up to the table, you're going to be fucking eight feet taller and you're going to have 154, 150 more kgs on top of you.
Engin Terzi (Host): Yeah, but Matt, now this is how you make in your head for your mental preparation, but suddenly you come to the table, you will see that he's not that big.
Engin Terzi (Host): it doesn't matter it doesn't matter when i got my bifocals on it don't matter okay okay yeah your imagination will not be messed up whenever you see him no i got enough demons built up right now that i can go him tomorrow and it wouldn't make a difference i wish that match was right now right front of us it would be crazy yeah but i i think that you guys are gonna build a lot
Nugo (Nugzari Chikadze): during the press conference as well. That's how I feel. Yeah, you can translate, Alex. Yeah. As I was saying, the machine works, because it doesn't work with ordinary people. Ford example, I may be able to read and write, but it's not the same for everyone. I may be able to read and write, but it's not the same for everyone. Ford example, I may be able to read and write, but it's not the same for everyone.
Unknown: It's impossible for him to do that. And he's only 7 meters tall and weighs 4,000 kilograms. And as you can see, he doesn't want to lose weight. It's very difficult for him to lose weight. Yes, that's right. In the first place, I think it's strange that he doesn't want to lose weight. He doesn't want to lose weight. I don't know why, but I think it's because he doesn't want to lose weight. He doesn't want to lose weight.
Unknown: The idea of the project will continue, but our goal is to make it happen, which is not the case at all. As a child, you will be able to do this, and you will be able to do this with your own hands. The idea is not the same. As a child, you will be able to do this, and you will be able to do this with your own hands. The idea is not the same. As a child, you will be able to do this, and you will be able to do this with your own hands. The idea is not the same. As a child, you will be able to do this, and you will be able to do this, and you will be able to do this, and you will be able to do this, and you will be able to do this, and you will be able to do this, and you will be able to do this, and you will be able to do this, and you will be able to do this, and you will be able to do this, and you will be able to do this, and
Nugo (Nugzari Chikadze): I don't need all that build up. You never met anyone like me. When a 5'7 guy will come up to the table next to you, and we get the straps, and when you feel that... 5'7 bullshit! That's fucking bullshit right there. There's no way that motherfucker's 5'7.
Nugo (Nugzari Chikadze): maybe wearing his high heels and standing on a riser but and when when we pull and nobody's gonna believe what i'm gonna do to you nobody's gonna believe and every day i i just i can't even sleep every day i think about how close and i just can't wait for it i need this match like uh like a sick man needs a peel every every day i think about it i just can't wait when it comes
Engin Terzi (Host): Dude, it's like 20 fucking one days away. Sleep. You're going to need your fucking rest. You're going to need your rest. What's up, please? I asked you something. Yeah. Okay. Trust me. Trust me. Answer. He says, I engine. Allen I can say is that when Nugo beat me, I was in better condition than my match with mask. But I would love to pull them both. It means like one more time.
Engin Terzi (Host): Okay, so yeah, yes, Alex. Anyway, so let's talk about some other matches. It seems like you guys, you guys are both very confident and let's save some for the press conference and then let's talk about some other matches. Nugo, who is winning? Zurab Taberidze or Georgii Tautiev?
Unknown: I can't wait for that match. I would say Tautiev maybe is going to win the first round, but after that I would say it's all zero.
Engin Terzi (Host): Arsen you familiar with Tautiev, Matt? Who is it, sorry? Tautiev is the one that pulled against Irakli at the East vs. West 15, when the tall guy with the glasses is a surgeon. Oh, okay. Yeah, and who's he pulling? Zurab Tauber is there. Ooh, fuck, I'm not...
Engin Terzi (Host): I honestly couldn't make an accurate prediction on either of those guys. Isn't Zurab just coming back from surgery himself? It has been two years, yeah, almost. Almost two years now? Yeah. So has he been competing much? I mean, I don't think so, but he competed against Petro Marharin. He didn't do well.
Engin Terzi (Host): And now he says he is ready. You can see his training. It looks really big, huge. The right arm match. Right arm match. Yeah. Yeah. He's more known for his left. Isn't he? Uh, you remember he gave some trouble to John and he beat rumbets at the beginning of this first year.
Engin Terzi (Host): I can't make an accurate prediction. Okay. Let me ask you another one. This is your category. Lachlan versus Petro Marharins. Do you remember Petro Marharins? I don't remember much about Petro. Petro Marharins is the guy that Nugo has the only defeat, 3-2. He was beating him 2-0, and then Petro came back and beat him 3-2. But the East versus West.
Matt Mask: I think he'll act again. Yeah. Yeah. Hello? There you are. There you are, yeah. Yeah. Sorry, we're out in the middle of the bush sitting on a fucking drilling rig. We got shit service here. Did you say he beat Nugo? Yeah, he beat Nugo 3-2. Nugo won the first two rounds.
Matt Mask: And then he came back and beat Nugo 3-2. And he's more of a hooker, isn't he? Yeah, he's a hook puller, yeah. Yeah, he has a very strong hooker. Yeah, I think it's going to be a battle. It's going to be a battle because we know Lachlan wants to go inside, right? So Lachlan's got the massive, massive strong arms. Yeah, well, fuck, if he beat Nugo, then, you know...
Matt Mask: fucking i don't know it was a good match i i don't know i think i'm gonna go with lachlan i'm going with lachlan on this one yeah yeah i'm going with uh the brother from down under let's see see how he's in that one i think petra's gonna win very easily we will see
Matt Mask: And Jocelyn versus Egle. Matt, you know Egle? Yeah, she was the one that beat Sarah. Yeah, she beat Sarah, right? Yeah. And then Jocelyn just beat Sarah too, right? Yeah. Wow. I'll tell you right now, I was amazingly impressed by Jocelyn. The amount of power Jocelyn displayed when she pulled Sarah, I would not...
Matt Mask: expecting that at all for a second it was almost very similar to way that her opponent beat sarah as well i think we're gonna battle i think that's gonna be a battle for sure i'm gonna say just because of the size and where jocelyn is i want i'm back and forth on this i want to say jocelyn but but her opponent has so much more
Matt Mask: So much more fucking experience, right? Yeah. Like, so it'll be, yeah, it'll be very interesting. Man. So you are expecting a close match by 50-50, maybe? Yeah, I'm totally on the fence on this one. Both of them are really, really, really strong. I think Jocelyn, the only thing that's really holding her back right now is her experience.
Engin Terzi (Host): she's only what three four years into the sport right now yes she is new she is new she has so much power and it's still translating in terms of what she's doing yet yeah yeah and like look what you did to sarah backman i mean in one year i think she will be even much more dangerous yeah yeah you're gonna in a year or two from now she's gonna be pulling barbola
Engin Terzi (Host): Anything is possible, yeah. Your good friend Sean says the energy for this match is going to be intense. Two cage animals let out of their cage to face each other. That is the right description there. And do you know Jocelyn Nugo? Yes, I know Jocelyn Nugo. She is a sportsman and a player.
Engin Terzi (Host): I would say Jocelyn is going to win. I think Jocelyn is going to win. Oh, she thinks Jocelyn is going to win? Okay, so let's go to another one. A good one. Ivan Matushenko, Serhii Kalinchenko at 115 kilo, 253 mat.
Engin Terzi (Host): Do you think that, do you think that say can top row match or do you think that match will end up in hook? That's a tough one.
Engin Terzi (Host): If you were coach of Sergi, would you prepare him for a hook battle or would you prepare him for a top roll or a high hook? This is a right arm match? Right arm match. Left arm match, Ivan would win comfortably. Easily.
Engin Terzi (Host): Has Ivan ended up pulling right arm at all in East versus West? Yeah, he has beaten Kami Jablonski. I thought that was in the left. No, they pulled right arm. Oh, they pulled right arm? Yeah. They beat him quite easily, too. Oh, that's tough. Like, if Ivan gets inside with him, you know it's over. You know it's over if he goes inside with him.
Matt Mask: And if he gets there and his ability to belt to drive inside is he's, I'd probably say the second or third best armrest on the world at Babel to sink his hook. Right. Yeah. So when I, Sergei, Sergei has real good posts, real good back pressure, a lot of pronation, but he sets up really, really, really high, high in his hand with his knuckles pointing the roof.
Matt Mask: Which, in my eyes, would make it even easier for Ivan to sink that hook. I think if Sergey was to be pulling him, I don't think he should be training the hook. I think Sergey should be figuring out how to low hand top roll like nobody else ever has before. Because if he sets up knuckles high with Ivan, it's just going to be pop, and they're going to end up right inside. So...
Matt Mask: I got to go with Ivan on this one. I really hope Sergey pulls it off. I love Sergey. I love watching him compete. I'd love to see him win. But I don't know if he's going to be able to stop Ivan from sinking this hook. And we know if he gets into the hook, it's not a play if you want to be with Ivan. I'm going to say Ivan 3-1. Yeah, Matt, for your information, in their language, it is pronounced E-1.
Engin Terzi (Host): Yvonne? Yvonne, yeah, Yvonne, yeah. I know in English when you say I and win, yeah, I understand, but it is over there, his name is Yvonne, yeah. Yvonne. Yvonne, yeah. Well, I say Yvonne. No, no, it's okay. I cannot pronounce many of the Western names. Yvonne is probably going to win 3-1. Yeah. 3-1. And go ahead, go ahead, Matt, go ahead. I even see it possibly being a clean sweep.
Engin Terzi (Host): I don't know about that, but I will tell you something. I will tell my opinion. It will go inside and it won't be easy. Yeah. Yeah. And I hope so. Yeah. Yeah. It will go there because he is smart enough to know that. I mean, it's very hard to talk about, but maybe he will teach us something new that we wouldn't be, I mean, aware of. Yeah. And Nugo? Nugo, thank you for the interview. I'm Sergey Kalinchenko and this is Ivan Matyushenko.
Unknown: Matushenko, I don't really see anyone fracking that wrist, so I would say Matushenko is going to win. I would say Matushenko, I don't really see anyone fracking that wrist, so I would say Matushenko is going to win. I would say Matushenko, I don't really see anyone fracking that wrist, so I would say Matushenko is going to win. I would say Matushenko is going to win. I would say Matushenko is going to win.
Engin Terzi (Host): I don't think so. Matyshenko is very strong inside. Okay. Just right aside, you know, that match will go inside and it won't be easy. Anyway, so I may be wrong. So we will see. And let's go. This is a great card, Matt. It's a great card. And I really, like, look at here. Like, David Dadikian versus Georgii Sevetko.
Matt Mask: Oh. It's the left arm match. After Dadakan's last performance. Against Kurdecha. Yeah. That was pretty impressive. Yeah, it was. Georgii's right arm is phenomenal. I know his left is strong too. I don't know where it is compared to his right. I would say a right hand match.
Matt Mask: It would be so fucking close. I don't know which direction I would go with on it. But being as it's the left arm match and how David has been performing, like...
Matt Mask: I think David is going to end up taking Georgii. I think Georgii might get one, but I think we're going to see David adjust, and it's going to be a 3-1 victory for David. I don't want Georgii to win. I'm cheering for Georgii, but I think in my head, my head's telling me that David is going to win this one. Okay.
Nugo (Nugzari Chikadze): No, it's very hard to predict it, but I'm leaning a bit in Georgii's favor. Oh, so he thinks that Georgii is like the favorites?
Engin Terzi (Host): And Sean again sends a super chat. Thank you, Sean. By the way, Sean, you're coming, right? You don't leave your brother, right? He's not coming? No. He's not coming? This is the first one.
Matt Mask: surprise surprise years that he's not going to come to and and while you are on the rise no okay the guy honestly think for how supportive he's been right from the beginning yes yes i think and i believe that east versus west should fly him out for one because he he's been to 10 or 12 right it came to everyone that you came yeah every event
Matt Mask: So I think you guys should do a massage, say, you know what, you're a loyal customer, a most loyal person, but I think you guys should purchase my brother, Sean, a ticket to come watch me kick Nugo's ass in Istanbul. Robert, you're listening, Robert. I sure hope Robert's listening. Okay. Because we're talking about my three pay-per-views on three different forums.
Engin Terzi (Host): Just so he's supporting you guys. Even when he doesn't, he'll be sitting there watching the live. Sean is the guy that helped me with the, the, the, the hair transplantation. You know, he is the one who connected me. Um, Sean almost beat up via voter for me. Yeah.
Engin Terzi (Host): Sean says, Alex has been awesome as a translator like Pavlo. He doesn't seem to be missing anything. It makes a big difference for interview. Thanks, Alex. Yes, Alex is doing great job. I'm honored. I'm honored. Yeah. Our Mutant says, Matt, will you pull Devon at 105 kg in the future, left or right?
Matt Mask: Yeah, if I earn that spot, absolutely. That's my end goal is I want to have a title shot against my big brother. Yeah, yeah. I think it would be diabolical just to get us back on the table again. But it's not something I want given to me. It's something I want to earn. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know, I know, yeah. I see that you guys are brothers, but when it comes to the...
Engin Terzi (Host): goals you know at the table that you you guys are just fighting we'll put all that aside yeah yeah yeah yeah okay so let's go to another one okay the last one we talked was uh swedco versus yeah okay let's go let's go to let's go to pauline versus david samusha
Matt Mask: uh last time they met at a later weight or they met yeah and and uh davit was jumping up wasn't he
Engin Terzi (Host): What do you mean jumping up? Like jumping up in the weight class? I mean, he was 87 kilos and Paul was 100 kilos. This time category is 95, Paul will be 95 and David will be around probably 90, 91, you know, and yeah. Okay. Yeah. It's very, very interesting. I think just like the first one, it's going to be a grinder.
Matt Mask: It's going to be an absolute grinder. Both of them have tremendous inside power. Both of them have so much fucking heart. Both of them don't ever want to give up no matter what position they're on the table. I think this is a match...
Matt Mask: Ford any inside bowler that wants to know what to do and what not to do and defend from certain situations and just to watch the little movements, I think this is going to be a match to watch for sure. Yeah, yeah. It's a very important match, yeah. I'm totally on the fence. Totally on the fence. Like, you got me right now and I think Paul Linn is going to do it.
Matt Mask: 30 seconds from now, I'm thinking David's going to do it. So, like, the positions... It's good. It's a good match. If it is confusing you, it means it's... Yeah, it's a phenomenal match. Even the first time, it was phenomenal. And I don't think we're going to see anything but phenomenal again when we get both of them across the table from each other. Ray, I...
Matt Mask: I think Paul Linn over coming off of his couple lost streak here. I think Paul Linn has probably dug deep. He's been sitting in his basement for the last three and a half fucking months doing wrist curls till fucking his old lady bitches at him and tells him, get the fuck to bed, honey. It's three o'clock in the morning.
Matt Mask: i think i think paul lynn is going to take this one i'm going with paul in 3-2 over david and we're going to see david have his first loss since the last loss he had him as pauline
Engin Terzi (Host): no doubt all the way for sure he's a legend he's he's an iron man so he's gonna win i don't disagree with him i don't disagree with him either david is yeah incredible yeah in this era at that stage if he's winning 10 world title matches i mean there is nothing to talk about yeah there's nothing talking about here
Engin Terzi (Host): I think it's called Javier. I think, yeah. Barsanti. Matt, how does it feel to have to compete against someone you won't be able to see? I'm just kidding. It is going to be a really good match. Greetings to everyone from Argentina. What did he mean? He mean that the height difference? He said he's going to be so short that all I'm going to be arm wrestling is an arm.
Nugo (Nugzari Chikadze): oh okay oh it's just gonna be it'll be like me arm wrestling cousin it right can you show me your hand again can you show me your hand again on this one it's like a delicate little flower right yeah do you trust your hands really that much do you trust them all the way dude
Matt Mask: It's the only thing I trust. He's going to tie into this fucking thing and he's going to go fuck me. There's got to be a way I can get out of this. I'm going to take your wrist. I'm going to break your wrist so hard that the two bent fingers you have, they're going to straighten out.
Nugo (Nugzari Chikadze): Listen here, SpongeBob. It's going to be a while before you're ever going to feel something like me again. You've never felt something like me before.
Engin Terzi (Host): I love this podcast. It's like normally I do my best to steer the pot this time. If I talk, I will make everything down. So I stay quiet because everything is going very good. Yeah. We're doing predictions and he's talking about breaking my fucking wrist.
Engin Terzi (Host): yeah yeah yeah yeah but that's good that's good it just goes you know how serious he is i will tell you matt i won't be nice you both are cracking the head when you come table right now you know okay okay we're gonna go i have never been able to go beyond i have been afraid right now and just a dream it's a dream hang on to it and cherish it as long as you can because like everything else
Engin Terzi (Host): This is going to be a whisper in the fucking wind come May 10th when I fucking step across the table from you. Boom. Okay. Let's go to the next one. Kamil Jablonski, Georgii Dzeranov, a left arm match. Matt first? Neville first? Yeah, Matt. Georgii Dzeranov versus Kamil Jablonski, left arm. Oh, Georgii. Yeah. Yeah.
Matt Mask: See, this is a match I would have liked to have seen Georgii pull in. I think Georgii should have been pulling. Oh, my God. Fucking. I'm drawing a blank right now. Brain farting. I think Georgii should have been pulling Gennady. I think Georgii and Gennady would have been a better match than what.
Matt Mask: Everything will happen. And Georgii versus Camille. I think. Nope.
Matt Mask: You want to go with Nugo maybe before he freezes up? Arsen we here now? Yeah. Matt, Matt, Matt. Nugo just said that you are freezing because you are so scared of him, in front of him. You see him. Yes, very true. Yeah. I can confirm that. It'll be just like it is in real life, eh? Like the version I see of him here is going to be the same version I see of him in real life.
Matt Mask: You know what I mean? The only difference is I'll belt to touch them. You know what I mean? But it'll be about the same size, right? So I honestly, I think, I think Georgii is going to beat Camille. I really do. I think, I think Camille may sneak one or two on them with some early starts.
Matt Mask: But I think Georgii is going to grab him down by the wrist a little closer to the elbow. I think he's going to try to drive into his press. I think Camille is going to end up palm up and we're going to see Georgii just sit right on top of his arm. Like the last couple of times I've seen Georgii compete and step to the table, he looks like a completely different human being.
Matt Mask: Like him changing religions, getting his life in order and doing whatever he's been doing the last two years, he looks like a completely different fucking animal altogether. So I think Georgii is going to beat Camille 3-1, 3-2 if Camille sneaks in a quick hit on him and chops him inside before Georgii's ready. But I think Georgii is going to stonewall him right in center, turn him around, grab his shoulder in behind, and we're going to see Camille palm up
Nugo (Nugzari Chikadze): That's what I think is going to happen. I would say for sure, obviously, Georgii Dzeranov. He's stronger. He's very strong. And I think he's stronger everywhere, basically in every lane.
Engin Terzi (Host): Wow, that's interesting because a lot of people think that Kamil even like have very good chance to become number one. His match with Vitaly wasn't that far from each other. And that's interesting that like he thinks that like for sure. Yeah, yeah, of course that Georgii also has a good chance. But okay, let's go. And like, please, Matt, predict this match like you are not involved. Matt versus Nugo.
Engin Terzi (Host): Well, I'm from the outside looking at him. Objective-wise, you're looking at those two guys. They come at the table. What do you see is happening? I would say 3-1 for Matt. Oh, 3-1 for Matt. Okay. Because he feels bad. Oh, he's going to give him one round because he feels bad for him? Yeah. That's what's going to happen.
Nugo (Nugzari Chikadze): Okay, Alex? How are you? I want to ask you a question, because you are new to this. How are you? I want to ask you a question, because you are new to this. Yes, yes, but did you translate it for me? Yes, I did. I want to ask you a question, because you are new to this. Yes, yes, but did you translate it for me? Yes, I did. I want to ask you a question, because you are new to this. Yes, I did. I want to ask you a question, because you are new to this. Yes, I did. I want to ask you a question, because you are new to this. Yes, I did. I want to ask you a question, because you are new to this. Yes, I did. I want to ask you a question, because you are new to this.
Unknown: I don't know what to say. When you look at the pros and cons, physically, everyone is physically strong, and you have a lot of chances. Ford example, my opponent is Tzavides.
Unknown: Ford example, if I want to go to the gym, I have to go to the gym with one hand and the other hand with the other hand. One and the same thing is in the gym. It's the same thing. It's not the same. It's physically different.
Nugo (Nugzari Chikadze): If you go from the side, I think it's pretty obvious that I'm going to win. If you divide the strengths and the weaknesses, the only weakness that I have against him is the hand size. I'm stronger than him physically in every lane. And even if my plan fails, let's say he takes my wrist, I'm still able to change lanes and go different ways and still beat him there because I'm stronger than him.
Engin Terzi (Host): i think if you if you just watch from the side it's pretty obvious that i'm gonna win okay and matt gennady quick winner versus ibrahim sago at 253. you're not he's cutting the 253 yeah yeah he was cutting even before devon match but we decided to set that match for super heavyweight was he chopping a leg off
Engin Terzi (Host): no i mean he has competed for many years the 242s you know and i i like he also knows how to how to do the water cut i think he left only like 25 pounds left i think or a little bit more wow right ganaudi's gonna be pulling the 253 pound class yeah this is a world title match because reno got injured so he can pull in one year he's still the champion but this is for interim title
Matt Mask: I'm sorry, I'm just like, right now, because Gennady's going to be pulling 153. I think that's awesome. Yeah, Gennady. I think Gennady, yeah, I think it's going to be a bad day for Ingram. Like, yeah. Yeah, hands down, I think Gennady is, I think he may sneak one in on him with a press if Gennady's not ready for it.
Unknown: But Gennady is going in too confident. But I think, I think Gennady all day, every day. Yeah. And Nugo? What do you think about Gennady and Ibrahim? What do you think about them? What do you think about them? What do you think about them? What do you think about them? What do you think about them? What do you think about them? What do you think about them? What do you think about them? What do you think about them? What do you think about them? What do you think about them? What do you think about them? What do you think about them?
Unknown: I don't know if it's true or not. I don't know if it's true or not. I don't know if it's true or not. I think it's true.
Nugo (Nugzari Chikadze): First of all, it's surprising that he's cutting so much weight and going into a new weight class. I would say it's Gennady because he's very much like Devon. Even if he gets stopped somewhere, he's so versatile and smart. You never know what he's going to come up with against you. You never know when he has to change, what lane he's going to choose, what he's going to do differently. So I would say Gennady.
Engin Terzi (Host): Okay. And Artur Makarov, Daniel Prokopchuk. Last three matches we are predicting. Match. Artur Makarov and Daniel Prokopchuk. World title match for Lightweight. You know about Atlas, right? Yeah. Yeah, I know about both of them.
Matt Mask: I think that's going to be a hell of a fucking battle. We got one guy that's primarily 100% going to be trying to top roll and we got somebody else that's going to be trying to hook. Fuck. Yeah. And Daniel has an amazing, amazing stop, like that half inch from the pad. You know what I mean? He can sit there and hang on for days. God. God.
Engin Terzi (Host): Do we know how healthy Arthur is lately? Is he really healthy? Everything's good? He's in good shape, yeah. And then Daniel, same thing. He's still Daniel. Very good shape, yeah. Yeah. I think, Jess, have these two ever pulled before? They pulled about nine years ago, European Championships final, and Arthur won, but Daniel...
Engin Terzi (Host): Previously, in the qualification round, he had a very long match with Irakli Zirakashvili. He beat Irakli, but long match. And then in the final, Arthur, he didn't have much left for Arthur. I mean, maybe at that time, even if it was fresh, probably Arthur would be favorite. But now, I'm not sure who is favorite. To me, it's a very close match, but I'm asking yours. I'm going to say Daniel.
Matt Mask: I'm going to say Daniel. I think Arthur has the tools where he should be able to. His hand size, his forearm, everything like that is, I believe, what you need to be able to beat Daniel, especially if he can transition into a press.
Matt Mask: when he takes the hand and gets him over. But I think that stop that Daniel has two inches from the pad is going to be too much for Arthur. And I think he's going to bleed him. So you are saying that Arthur will be offensive? I think Arthur is going to be offensive and probably come out of the gates hot for the first one.
Matt Mask: one maybe two rounds and then i totally see it tsn turning point and switching over to daniel so i understand and this is the title okay you go and you go now i think again some internet problem
Engin Terzi (Host): I say 4-2. 4-2, Daniel winning, you say. And you, Alex? I know a lot of people say that Makrov's going to win. They think Makrov's going to, but I would say it's Daniel. I would go with Daniel. Okay. And let's go Rustam Babay versus Tata Sings. Hutchins. Hutchins is unstoppable right now.
Engin Terzi (Host): So this is right arm match, right? Yes, of course. I don't think I would ever set the left arm match for Todd. I mean, not that he's not good, but I think he may not be at this level at the East versus West with left arm. But he says for 95 kilo, his left arm is good. But we will see. Maybe someday, you know. Yeah, I think Kachin's 95 kg. I don't see anybody beating him anytime soon, especially in a hook.
Nugo (Nugzari Chikadze): I would say 100% for me. That's interesting.
Engin Terzi (Host): match and nugo exact opposite you know predictions uh matt when i when i pull arthur in yellow did you watch that match or you were concentrated on your own match my match was over at that time because that was the first match of the evening remember yeah why did we pick that one that one because they wanted the pay-per-view or whatever
Engin Terzi (Host): Oh, okay. Okay. Part of it to be done first and everything else was free streamed afterwards, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. By the way, I'm training. I started math two weeks. I have been training. You're looking leaner. Yeah. Hey, if you guys are not meaner. Listen, listen, listen. Hey, listen. I may be looking normal during this podcast, but you know that I'm not normal either, you know.
Engin Terzi (Host): anyway so we know you're not normal yeah yeah yeah yeah anyway so let's go to the um vitaly lalatin versus uh michael todd and the winner is gonna pull for the super heavyweight world title this year go ahead
Matt Mask: I'm kind of on the fence on this one. Just not sure. Vitaly has the leverage. Vitaly has the hand control. Vitaly has everything he needs to be able to beat Michael Todd. He's got the speed. He's got the hit. Listen, listen, listen. I'm going to cut you. I'm going to cut you.
Engin Terzi (Host): speed and hit is the key to beat Michael? How many people successfully have done that? I don't think it's key, but it's definitely going to help you get the positions that you need. You know what I mean? Just say that he has the position. Does he have the...
Matt Mask: Next tools. That is the only thing that I'm questioning about is if he has the finishing power to beat him. I think like Ermes Gasparini of everybody has showed us.
Matt Mask: the tools, the path, what you need to do. Even Angabayev had done it, showing what you need to do and where you need to go in order to beat Michael Todd. And it's got to be hit over, taking the hand, coming up, transition, re-grip, transition, re-grip. I think Vidali can dominate all that perfectly if he gets high enough. The only thing I'm unsure about is if he can transition into a press to finish him.
Engin Terzi (Host): Because I don't think you're going to beat Michael Todd just by top rolling him to the pad. You need to take your hand, get far enough out on it, enough of the strap to where you can transition into that press and it'd be effective. Okay, let's go... The only thing I'm unsure about. Okay, let's go by part by part. Vitaly, to get the hand, like really good hand advantage, what's the possibility of this?
Engin Terzi (Host): I think it's a great possibility. So do you think that when you get that far above Michael's hand, the amount of pressure that you need to beat Michael is lessened? I think it's definitely lessened because you're far enough away. You're not actually pinning Michael's arm.
Matt Mask: You need to be far enough out on his hand because you're not going to pin Michael's arm unless you flash pin him or you catch him off the goal. You're going to pin Michael with his fingertips or his knuckles in some way because Michael's wrist is always going to be hovering this much above. But you ought to be able to get, you're only going to get him two inches from the pad with the wrist. It's the hand you need to go below that's going to pin him. You're not going to pin his arm. It's your hand that you're pinning, right? Yeah.
Matt Mask: And I think Vitaly definitely has the tools to get to the positions and everything that he needs to be able to finish him. Whether or not he's going to transition into it and have enough power in that position to do it, because I still think it takes a lot of power once you do get that hand control and everything into that press in order to put his arm down far enough to where his fingers will go below the pin pad. That's the only thing I question.
Matt Mask: But how do you see everything else? I actually think Vitaly is going to do it. I think Vitaly is going to do it. And we're going to see Vitaly pulling Levan here in the next five to six months. Let's see. Maybe they will pull with Levan. But let's see. Javier is now sending a...
Matt Mask: a bit provocative uh super chat he says i am leaving one more donation so matt can get a better internet it's on my internet man i'm working i'm in no man's land in the bush of nowhere we're running off satellites and boosters and everything else so so don't blame me
Engin Terzi (Host): blame pedo explorations for their shit internet provider that they're running on i mean you're doing well except like like some 10 seconds houses you know it's like this right it'll be good and then you know yeah but it's very short time you you do very well 20 minutes and then 10 seconds um okay vitality versus michael todd no go uh
Unknown: I would like to say yes, because it is not easy for others to find a job, and it is not easy for others to find a job. I think they know very well what it is, but if it is possible to find a job, I would like to say yes.
Nugo (Nugzari Chikadze): Yeah, I would say probably Michael for me because I think the match is going to stop and Vitaly will have to press, but I don't think his press is good enough to finish Michael. And if Michael's endurance follows him through the match and everything goes well, I think Michael's going to win.
Engin Terzi (Host): And some people think that, you know, I'm hyping Michael. No, that's what I believe. And a lot of athletes also, they agree, you know. Anyway, so one more thing I'm going to ask and then we will finish. Ermes Gasparini versus Levan Levan Saginashvili. If I ask this to Nugo, I know what I'm going to hear as a Georgii. But let me ask to Matt, you know. He's already smiling. Yeah.
Matt Mask: i don't know um i was blown away the last time they pulled each other um if he can slow him down again i know i'm sure levon has gone back to the drawing board and worked tremendously on his stamina so he never has to get hooked up to an oxygen match again during an arm wrestling match
Matt Mask: But Ermes is fucking phenomenal. Phenomenal, phenomenal, phenomenal. He does have one small weak area, I believe, and Devon exploited it. I was able to exploit it many years ago. Whether he's closed that gap or not, I don't know if LeVon knows where that area is or that sweet spot that he needs on him. And if he hasn't figured it out, I...
Matt Mask: Like, LeVon is fucking, LeVon's a fucking freak. But I want to go with fucking Ermes. I want to see a new king of the mountain. You're telling me that you are supporting Ermes. You are supporting Ermes. I'm going with Ermes. Fuck that. Ermes is going to beat him. Ermes is going to beat him 4-3. Ermes, the new super heavyweight champion of the fucking world. The mountain.
Unknown: No, he lied. Yeah. And Nugo? Ermes and Levan. I don't know what will happen, but I hope so. Well, when it comes to Levan's performance, it depends on how he will perform. You know, Ermes will be able to perform in that form and he will be able to beat Levan, but you don't think that Levan will be as strong as he is.
Unknown: In the past, if Levan was in a certain position, now he is in a different position. But it doesn't matter. In general, I think Dimash is in a slightly different form. I don't think that Levan is in a different form. And I think there is no chance for Levan to win. Ermes is a very good player and has played very well and has played very well. But I think that Levan is one person.
Nugo (Nugzari Chikadze): Of course, Levan. I see Ermias progressing. I see him getting better. And he says, oh, I'm better than the last match. But I always see that he misses the point that Levan is not at the same place as well. He's progressing and he's missing that point that Levan's getting better and better and better and stronger.
Nugo (Nugzari Chikadze): I support Ermes tremendously. I love him. He's very strong. He's very good. But I would say not only Ermes. Levan is the... As long as he wants to be a champion, Levan will be a champion. And I don't think Ermes can win against him. Okay, okay. He'll be a champion in Georgii, and Ermes is going to be standing at the top of the fucking mountain with his hands up in the air, and we're going to see a 400-pound Levan rolling down that fucking hill. That's what's going to fucking happen.
Nugo (Nugzari Chikadze): This is going to be a sad day for Georgii.
Unknown: Sad day, except for Gennady. Gennady is going to have a good day, but you and Levan are going to have a bad fucking day. But Gennady is going to have a good day. But Gennady is going to have a good day. But Gennady is going to have a good day. But Gennady is going to have a good day. But Gennady is going to have a good day. But Gennady is going to have a good day. But Gennady is going to have a good day. But Gennady is going to have a good day. But Gennady is going to have a good day. But Gennady is going to have a good day.
Nugo (Nugzari Chikadze): When I see you talk about Ermias winning against Levan, you winning against me, that we're going to have a bad day, I'm getting calmer and calmer every second. I just see and I'm sure that... I just found a Smarty on my chair that I dropped, a green Smarty on my chair, and I found it and I ate it and it was so fucking good.
Unknown: like that's how much i was paying attention to what you said that's a smarty meant more to me and letting everybody know that what you've got to say right now you're gonna kick my ass i'm old
Matt Mask: i'm washed up i'm lanky i'm look at look at i got like these spaghetti spaghetti then little arms like i'm like gonna be dangling in there you got a way lower center of gravity than me show me more fear
Matt Mask: right that's it that's all i got man it's it there's nothing there you'll be up top you'll be up top on the table breaking my arm and chewing on my ankles at the same time right
Nugo (Nugzari Chikadze): What you have right now, you're not going to have that anyway. Even what you have left. You won't have it. On May 10th, when I'm going to destroy you, you're going to be the quietest. Did you hear that? Did you hear the dinging? Did you hear the dinging? I got some ham and scalloped potatoes I'm warming up right now with some vegetables.
Engin Terzi (Host): It's fucking going to be good, man. It's going to be good. Okay. Okay, guys. Yeah, let us finish here so that you guys can have something at the press conference. Doesn't that look fucking delicious? You guys probably don't eat pig. I fucking love it.
Engin Terzi (Host): Anyway, so thank you very, very much, Nugo. Thank you, my friends. And see you in Istanbul in three weeks. And Max, see you in Istanbul, my friends. We will have some good time. We need an 18-inch riser for Nugo. Special order, an 18-inch riser. Okay? Special order. Thank you.
Nugo (Nugzari Chikadze): If you haven't already, buy the fucking pay-per-view, right? Watch me whip this fucking turd's ass. Nego, Nego, what happens in you when Matt is talking like this, so provocative? Nothing, because he doesn't understand what I'm fucking saying. No, I think I'm translating probably. I'll ask, no, die.
Unknown: I don't think it's a good idea to do that. First of all, the people who live in these villages and who are living in these communities are very sensitive. They are very sensitive to the language. And I would like to emphasize that my language is important. The language is important. I don't want to say that my language is important. My language is important.
Nugo (Nugzari Chikadze): you know when i look into his eyes i'm not gonna say anything more anything less i see your eyes you're so fearful you're so scared you know they clearly give you a wrong name should be a puppy a little puppy my little screaming puppy at least i don't look like a punk right so honestly yeah okay i'm not concentrating on my food right now
Matt Mask: I need to try to get massive. I need to get bigger and I need to get stronger so I can do something. Can we change the weight gap? Can we change the weight gap? I think I need to get bigger and stronger. Can we pull at 245? 245. Listen, listen. 245. It will favor him. The guy is already there. He's cutting weight.
Engin Terzi (Host): well what are you now what are you now nugo tell me wow because he was he was cutting weight before he was like 100
Unknown: like 12 or 13 or something you know wow that's good that's good that he already lost weight wow
Nugo (Nugzari Chikadze): I control my weight more right now less fat more protein eating correctly I don't let my weight go like I did before and I think if I did that for previous matches I would be even better okay okay guys thank you very very much this was very entertaining I am very very excited for sure
Engin Terzi (Host): There are many great matches, but this is somehow is the most exciting one for me and for many of the fans. Thank you very much, Matt. And thank you very much, Nugo. And thank you, Alex, for translation. Thank you, Egan. Thank you. Take care, guys. Take care.
