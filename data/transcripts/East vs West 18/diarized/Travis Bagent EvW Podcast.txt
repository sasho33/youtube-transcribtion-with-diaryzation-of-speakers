Engin Terzi: so I can chat with you guys before Travis comes in six minutes. So I hope you guys are doing well. Tomorrow, I will have Pauline and David Samusha as our guests. And Saturday will be a hot day.
Engin Terzi: because Matt Mask and Nugo Shkadze, they will be our guests. Hello, Jay Lips. Paul Wade. Hello, hello, my friends.
Engin Terzi: In five minutes, Travis is going to join us. Yeah. King of the table 14 in Istanbul will be incredible. Hello. Hello, my friends. Hello, Arch. X-A-Y-C. I don't know how to pronounce your name.
Engin Terzi: Easy, easy. Hello, my friend. Brian says, Travis beats Levan. John waiting on Travis as usual. Yes, yes, I started early. It's not Travis's fault. I came here like six minutes before we agreed with Travis. Hello, Andre. Your name is Irakli. Okay, Irakli.
Engin Terzi: So you are from Georgii. Zeman. Engin, is Ermes using fake weights? I mean, I don't think so. Matt M. Hey, Engin, would you ever consider doing stadium-style seating for the live crowd so people aren't so far away?
Engin Terzi: We are, I mean, what do you mean like stadium, like, like a basketball place? Seiki Toprol. Welcome to the first official episode of Tell Me I'm the Greatest podcast. Okay. Hello, Brian. Hello to Ireland. Lorenzo. Hello. The community thinks that Levan said about fake waves cause you said to him, no.
Engin Terzi: The community doesn't think those kind of things. That is your, probably, invention. Jorge, what is your prediction for final score between Ermes and Levan rematch? I don't share my opinions about the matches, yeah. Why does Travis Detrigan spell wrong names intentionally? I don't know.
Engin Terzi: I can ask him, but I think he should be caring more. See, he came two minutes earlier. That's good. That's unexpected, Travis. Hello, Travis. What's up? How are you? Good? How you feel? How you feel? I start training. I know. The weights are going up, but still like...
Engin Terzi: between 50% to 60%, but it will come. It will come quick. I don't think I need to be 100% to beat Minda Agos anyways, you know. Yeah, like around 85%, 90% is okay, you know. Do you think that he'll still bow down to you and let you set the grip and let you control everything, or do you think he'll fight back?
Engin Terzi: No, we never do that. It's your imagination, probably. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I just close my hand and I just beat him. Yeah, man. Everyone's scared. Everyone's scared to re-grip and rise against you. Why? Well, because you're the boss. They don't want to piss the boss off. Come on. I have been organizing events last two, three years. I competed 30 years and not in the organizations that I compete. The majority of my wins were in U.S.,
Engin Terzi: with two U.S. referees and the rest of the athletes being from U.S. Well, yeah, but you were really strong then. I mean, I have always been strong. Now, now we all know. Ford example, when I beat you, the referees were American as well, right? So I was, yeah, okay. But no one watches overalls in any way. No, no, they do, they do, they do. What's up? Is that a new sweatshirt, new apparel? What you got?
Travis Bagent: What do you say? The apparel, the sweatshirt looks new. Brand new? No, this is from Tibley 7. Wow, it looks clean. It's popping. It's popping right now in the HD. Is that blue or purple? It's blue. Yeah, it looks good. So how are you? I'm good. I've been traveling like crazy. I just got back from Chicago.
Travis Bagent: late last night, so just, you know, it never stops. Nothing ever stops. Yep, you're right, you're right. So, generally, how did you like the next event card, King of Table 14? Oh, man, come on, man. Is it good? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's up there. It's close to Tbilisi. It's close to Tbilisi. It's good. Yeah, it's really good. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: Okay, so you ready to discuss about the matches? I am. Listen, let's start from the top to the main event. No, let's start from the down to the top. Why are we going to see what I mean about this? This is like me and Mandagas. We're trying to arm wrestle you right now. We tell the referee, set grip. He's like, no, get ready. Put your elbow down. Okay. Do you remember Petro Marharin? Of course. Yeah. He had a win against Zurab and he had a win against Nugo.
Engin Terzi: This is the guy that I think we were there, right? When he won the tournament in Moldova. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Bad dude. Bad dude. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's very hard to top roll him. And his opponent is Lachlan. And people may underestimate Lachlan.
Engin Terzi: But Krasimir, Krasimir said that Lachlan was very strong and Krasimir really had to use his experience and speed to beat him. If you remember their match in the Dubai event. And yeah, I have seen Petro Marharin versus Krasimir in 2022 Wab Wars. And it was a battle. Krasimir and him, they had a long battle. Okay. How do you see this match?
Engin Terzi: I mean, well, let's talk about his opponent more. So we've only seen him one time, right? Talking about Petromarchandis? Yeah. Yes. Yeah, yeah. We have seen him twice. Yeah. He beat Zurab, but Zurab was still coming back from the, you know, he broke his humerus. And yeah. And then the first match was, I think, Nugo. Yeah. But beating Nugo is something.
Travis Bagent: Yeah, no doubt. He was losing 2-0, and then he came back and beat him three times. Yeah, this 50-50 for me. I mean, I'm really like, I don't think I have enough information. I think that, you know, I think it's going to be good. So I really don't know who will win that. But, you know, I think that, you know, like you said, as soon as you beat Nugo, you're real. So, I mean, we'll say Petro 51%. Hmm.
Engin Terzi: How do you see it? I mean, you know that I don't share prediction. I mean, it's staying outside, right? Both pullers outside, right? No, they will go inside most likely. Right away. You're talking about Petra and Lachlan? Yeah, you're saying first match.
Engin Terzi: right away i don't know if one of them will try to go outside but but i mean they both trust their inside game you know like margarine is just curling in like this way but if he does something different this time i don't know yeah if but i mean i just think that he's gonna try to take lachlan's i think lachlan wants to hook he's gonna hook and and
Travis Bagent: he's got a chance to, I mean, listen, Lachlan's got to make it a match. Going into the card, going into the card, unless you have firsthand knowledge on day-to-day operations, you know, on Lachlan's condition, I mean, you'd have to. I will tell you something, one thing. If Lachlan tries to top-roll Petro Marharin, I don't think it's a good idea. Because I have seen even Revas couldn't top-roll him.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, so his wrist, even Nugo when beating him, it was like more like sideways, not taking his wrist, but just it is like in that category, like to top roll him, I don't know. I would like to see Devon trying to top roll Petro Marhani. Right, so I'm thinking that. I don't see anyone top rolling him, you know. Yeah, I'm thinking Lachlan could get top rolled a couple times before.
Travis Bagent: I hope Lachlan is stronger than ever so that he goes in a hook early and so we can see that. Because as long as it's close, then I think Lachlan has his best chance of pulling it out. He just has to be careful that he doesn't get leveraged out right away. Nothing's worse than being top rolled by a guy that can beat you in a hook too. You know, even if the hook match is close, it's still, you know, so.
Travis Bagent: going to be close we'll see petro 51 and i'm rooting for lachlan okay and be bigger i hope lachlan is because listen lachlan to me already went to the dark side and is intense about being big mean and he really wants it it's just you know nothing's worse than really wanting it right now and being really good because there's a chance that the competition is just better
Engin Terzi: I mean, it's tough up there, boy. It's tough. Yeah. Yeah, I don't know how big Lachlan can be because it is 105 category. And I think that that is the lowest Lachlan can make. And, okay, next match is Zurab Taberize, Georgii Tautiev. This is going to be tough for Zurab. I mean, I think he's going to, you know...
Travis Bagent: No one wants to be an arm wrestling champion as much as giraffe. He's like, he's eager to get back at it. I I'm rooting for him, but the odds are that. Yeah. Sorry for cutting you guys. You hear the Atlas sound during the event. There was a few matches.
Engin Terzi: Uh, in the last event that there was a microphone problem, just, if you just watch the other matches, uh, you will see that the microphone was working and some people talk like, you know, like, uh, like I have anything to do with it. I was like 10,000 kilometer away from that. I had no idea what was going on there. So just please, if you want to enjoy the podcast, you are more than welcome.
Engin Terzi: Yeah. Yeah, I mean, just some people just don't come here to enjoy. Just say come for a vacation. Oh, let's do some shit, you know. Go ahead, yeah. Go ahead, yeah.
Travis Bagent: Allen right, getting back. Where were we at? What are we talking about? Yeah, we were talking about Zurab versus Tautiev. You remember Tautiev? Yeah, of course. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, and I mean, listen, big, long. It's going to be tough for Zurab. I think we all want to see Zurab successful, but this is an uphill battle. I think that he's got to be way back, way back to get back on that.
Engin Terzi: trouble he could be in trouble yeah yeah so you are talking to him he feel does he feel like yeah yeah he feels very strong yeah and yeah so let me go to the next match um that they're very very good matches i don't even okay let's go to the the ladies match eggler versus jocelyn yeah this is
Travis Bagent: I mean, I really do not know how good Jocelyn is. Like, it appears that she's pretty good. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And also, too, with Sarah. Like, I'm looking on social media. I'm talking to Artem. I'm talking to the guys in Florida. They're telling me.
Travis Bagent: Sarah is at another level training hard, you know, and I'm seeing her on Instagram and she comes there. She looks amazing. That match didn't look that close. And the last round it was, yeah. But you know what the biggest problem with that last round was is after speaking with Jocelyn, she thought that that last round was going to be an opportunity for her to take control.
Travis Bagent: look and do her little pose and she had a little emphatic way she was gonna end it all and then all of a sudden sarah doesn't cooperate and gets locked in there but according to jocelyn there was still not a whole lot of trouble and then according to sarah for her to end up giving it up when i thought
Travis Bagent: it was really if she thought she was in the match more time to even grind more so i'm not sure about that round three of of which one i you know what i want to truly believe but okay what do you believe there's a chance really strong like really strong yeah so i think that
Travis Bagent: From an East versus West perspective, from the fans, right? And this may be just me, Ingen. I know you appreciate the true art when it comes to the champions showing their valor and keep on winning. But the fans want to see the champ lose. And for us to feel comfortable about someone beating Vara, we need Jocelyn to handle Egla.
Travis Bagent: I don't know if it'll happen. If it's close, then I really am not sure that we have someone yet. But from a fan, from a guy who once is rooting for eventually for all the champs to lose, and then once they become the champs, for them to lose too. So I believe that Jocelyn represents someone that we could get behind to go against Vora, but she has to take care of Egla pretty convincingly.
Engin Terzi: Um, yeah, listen, it doesn't have to be like that way because, um, to me, Jocelyn is still new and even if she would barely beat Egle, it means a lot. It means that a year from now, she will be even much better because some athletes are really at their limits. I don't think that she's anywhere near her, uh, full potential.
Engin Terzi: If she wins super easy, does she have to arm wrestle Gabby before she gets a title shot or no? I mean, listen, if she wins super easy, it means that she's ready for a title match. Yeah. But, but, but. But, but. But, but. But. But. But. But. But. But. But. But. But. But. But. But. But. But. But. But. But. But. But. But.
Travis Bagent: the, the, the match that, uh, if you take away, if you take away the third match, I would say those first two rounds are equal for both of them. And if John just, uh, the, the, just giving you some information that Jocelyn had an explanation on why that third match, and even with her kind of posing, uh,
Travis Bagent: know she definitely didn't treat that round according to her like she could have so but listen like i said i just want to root for anybody that has a chance to beat the champ so jocelyn i say that you have two paths you're getting a long awesome match with egla the fans love the match but now all of a sudden we still think it's only bara and um gabby's
Travis Bagent: are the two if you go through egla 3040 whatever the scenario three right best out of five and if she handles that business i believe she like you said perhaps gets to skip and go right to the champ and that we would be behind her looking for an upset i i i think that whatever she will perform on may 10th um she will perform
Engin Terzi: much better six months later a year later so i i i mean i i will not i will like as long as she wins i i don't care how how difficult it will be but i'm saying telling you beating egg is a very very hard thing to do yeah yeah no doubt no doubt no doubt yeah there is a question um why alijan is not competing alijan just
Engin Terzi: fasted for one month, you know, from sunrise to sunset because of month of Ramadan and he did not prepare well. So he will, he will, he just needs a little bit more time. Yeah. So, okay. You, you just said different things, you know, like you, you explained different things than the prediction.
Travis Bagent: Like, yeah, so you're right. Yeah. My prediction is, uh, Jocelyn, uh, 65%, 65, 35. Jocelyn 65%. Yeah. Because I know what I want. Right. Arsen you going to tell us what do you want or what do you believe? This is what I want to believe. I want to believe that.
Travis Bagent: Is this what you think? Is she going to come and be there, Glenn? Yeah, yeah. Okay. As long as you're telling me what you think. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. But don't tell me what you want. Tell me what you think. I mean, part of what I hope happens has to be a part of my prediction. So I'm saying my prediction is 65-35 in favor of Jocelyn. Listen.
Engin Terzi: That is like someone like Egle has like 20 something times like world title. And she could have probably reached to 30 if she didn't quit. She left WAF and Europeans because she didn't have opponent in her category.
Travis Bagent: She was just going there and winning and going home, you know? So what I'm saying is... I heard it in both Fia and why am I not saying the name? Tell me. Patterson, Carolina. Yeah. Both of them, they would have lost their every dollar, everything they own before Bora and Egla's match.
Travis Bagent: And I heard them. They were very confident. They were betting on Egle against Barbara? Yes. Very confident. Very, very confident. So trust me, this is not the Travis hates Egle thing. I don't really know Egle that well. I saw her against Bora. It didn't look close that day.
Travis Bagent: so yeah yeah yeah i'm looking on and then i'm seeing egla beats sarah i'm seeing jocelyn beats there the only thing that's different is match three i get a small explanation from that and now it's easy for me to jump on the north american train and go with jocelyn three zero and ready for boris is set it up right away okay
Travis Bagent: Let's go to very, very, very, very tough match. Kamil Jablonski, Georgii Di Dzeranov, left arm match. Yeah, I don't think it's that close. Yeah, I don't think it's that close. What do you mean? I don't think it's that close. I believe in my heart that there are two guys, right, three guys, because I didn't realize Morozov was so good.
Travis Bagent: But he is so good, and he's so young. And LeVon may be in that group. It may be four. We can argue whether Devon's in that group at five. And then, of course, you can add on the Alice Johns and all those, right? But to me, there are clearly, there is, we have our top guy, the right guy has the belt, and Vitaly is the guy.
Engin Terzi: And I'm telling you, it was so close between him and Kamil, and just like you said, Jocelyn. Okay, Travis, you know about arm wrestling. The question, top-rolling Kamil is the most difficult thing, taking his wrist? He gives it himself, right? Okay, so the question, like when Dzeranov lost against Vitaly,
Engin Terzi: Did he lose because of his arm strength or his hand didn't handle Vitaly's top rope? It was that way. I'm just saying that in any case, if both Vitaly and Dzeranov is able to go outside, then where do you put your money about the arm strength against Kamil? Because you're taking the Kamil's hand anyway. He's just giving it to you.
Engin Terzi: so who do you think has the stronger arm in in such case is is it is it uh vitale or is it uh camille it is camille no no sorry sorry is it we tell you or is this i don't know the arms that's well that's the question right that's the question i'm just i don't i'm i am i am i am not saying anything about the journal he's awesome he could be he may at the end of this
Travis Bagent: be way stronger than I think. But in my opinion, that you have to manipulate the hand and wrist of Camille, but you have to do it surgically. Your upper body has to stay in the right place, or you can do what Vitaly did and overwhelm him, but it's not easy to continue to overwhelm him. And when I saw him get a bite on Vitaly at all,
Travis Bagent: It is going down crazy. You made a comment to me a year and a half ago and you said, Travis, if I were to set you up with Camille, it would be like he stepped on your hand with two feet. Not one, he put both feet. I think that this guy- You are a type of guy that also, you are great about taking in, like lulleting, but I don't know how much arm power you guys have.
Travis Bagent: I agree. And I'm just telling you that I think that underneath, in a hook, it's going to be even more overwhelming. How about if, like, have you seen, like, who tested Kamil's inside yet?
Engin Terzi: You know, I saw Morozov with right arm and once he hook him, he was able to pin him easier than I think the top role. So what I'm just saying, what goes inside and what if Camille's inside doesn't end up as we all are thinking? Because you do... That's the question right there. But I'm just telling you that I think that Camille is so offensive.
Travis Bagent: that it's gonna be a press against a hook. It won't ever be a hook first hook. No, no, but once you hook him, he has to go. He cannot do this anymore, you know? Yeah, yeah, I'm just saying, you hook him and then you get, like you said, he puts both feet on it and the hook opens right up.
Travis Bagent: And he's just gone. Like, it's like, if you're not careful with cataract and you, cause you need to get his hand, but he's, he's going to give it to you. You just need to make sure that you are ready for him. Not turn it right in and push you right now. Camille, I think left-handed top dog. It's only a matter of time before he's the champion of the world.
Travis Bagent: the first step of because listen here's the real truth if he if he can be beat by just staying inside and hooking him he knocked that out and then he also has to be careful that he never gets taken out leverage and then I don't think it's going to be much longer that he'll be uh that he'll end up beating Vitaly as well yeah yeah yeah yeah I mean I think Camille's all
Engin Terzi: Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So you are saying Kamil is going to beat him? Kamil is going to beat him. Kamil is going to beat everybody you put up against him left-handed for the next four years. Okay. Okay. Let's go to the match with probably the most energy in the world.
Travis Bagent: Yeah, it's going to be close, man. Matt is ready. Nugo is awesome. I mean, Matt's either, if it stays outside, he wins. And then if somehow Nugo can just keep it inside, he's going to win. Nugo is not a hook puller either, you know. Right, but he's got to have a bite. He's got to have a bite. I don't think that Nugo can hook. I mean, even Krasimir couldn't hook Matt.
Engin Terzi: So only like with the like longer leverage people like Jordan and yeah. But it will be a battle like back pressure versus back pressure. Who is his wrist will handle, then we'll win that match most likely. There's a chance Matt's even better than we know, me and you. Because we can't ignore Matt's past, but I'm telling you he's different.
Travis Bagent: He is absolutely different right now. Hey, text Robert right now and tell him we're on YouTube clip together. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. He's trying to get a hold of me right now. He's trying to get, okay, yeah. He said, you haven't responded, call me now. I'm like, well, I can't call you right now, but I will call you after this. I'll call him after this. Yeah.
Travis Bagent: Okay, so you are saying that Matt is going to win or? I don't know. I just, man, I'm really impressed. What do you think about Nugo? I think he's awesome. I think he's got a great showman. He doesn't look like he is as awesome as he really is. So, you know, if he wins this, this is awesome. But if Matt continues, there's a chance that Matt's really good right now.
Engin Terzi: Like, I'm not sure. How do you, do you have a, do you have a feeling about what, how you feel under Baez's shape was? I had no idea. I have no idea. I cannot say because if I say it wasn't good, then we will be taking credit away from Matt. So he came there and during the podcast, he said he was in his best shape. And this is what he said. And they pulled and
Engin Terzi: Matt impressed me even when he pulled against... Marcio. Yeah, Marcio. Yeah, he beat him in the last round. He went inside. And Marcio should be doing like this to him, but he wasn't like that even inside, you know. And yeah, so that was very interesting. That was very interesting. And I don't even know, like, how it will go, how it can go. Like, listen, when it is top role versus top role,
Travis Bagent: I mean, like, and then one goes like this and one goes like this. So, I mean, so, you know, how is this? This is a great, this is going to, this is going to be a high energy match. And I am rooting for Matt Mask. And I believe that this is like after this one, if Matt's as dominant, if we have seen him, I mean, then.
Travis Bagent: It's time to like, yeah, he's not. We might as well forget about that three years ago or two years ago when he had that span where he was in trouble. That guy's not around no more. This new guy's awesome. I mean, he even took so much control of Marcio. Marcio wasn't even in the game enough to foul. Something happened to Matt. I don't know what happened. He became more healthy.
Engin Terzi: Bite of cell biologics. I don't know what it is. I don't know what it is. He got his stem cells and it actually, he had a legitimate injury. And now he does not have that injury. That's my belief. Yeah. I mean, possible, possible. I don't know. Matt had some losses. He lost against Andres. He lost against Prudnik. He lost against Frank Lamparelli. And...
Engin Terzi: But these people are also very strong guys. But the guys that, you know, Matt recently beat are also very strong guys. So I don't know. I don't know. 105 is a great category. Great category. Yeah. Yeah. He looks huge. He looks huge when he's there. Matt? Yeah, Matt lost to Grundy, too. He did lose to Grundy. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I forgot about that one. You're right. Yep.
Engin Terzi: When are we going to see Basho again? Arsen we going to see Basho soon? Yeah, yeah, we will see. We will see, yeah. I think he's going to compete Europeans soon. And then, yeah, we will see him again. Okay, Ivan Matyshenko versus Serhii Kalinchenko. Man, this is going to be good, man. This is good. I just, like, yeah. I mean, Matyshenko, man, it's so hard to root against him.
Engin Terzi: So hard. Listen, listen, I will tell you, I will not tell you my opinion or no prediction, but if Serhii is planning to top roll Ivan, it may be a mistake. If he's trying to get out of his hands, because that is, I think that probably pound for pound, he must be one of the best
Travis Bagent: guys that with the hook inability like getting someone inside you know yeah yeah and not only that like it's clear to me that he doesn't even have he doesn't even necessarily do it with elbow movement he does it with his connection he is connected for whatever reason that that pressure in his hand creates a wrist curl and not not you know any sort of losing he's
Engin Terzi: He's special, man. The only thing that scares me is that every once in a while, you can beat him in a hook. That's what I was going to say. If Serhii is preparing a very good hook, then we may see something really, really tough. But top rolling...
Engin Terzi: I don't know. The worst part about trying to top roll, you try to top roll somebody pushing hook, then it is very, very hard to continue hook as well because you bring your shoulder back and your tornado is turning, then it is kind of too late. You need to be very quick and come back. No doubt. And usually, if you try to top roll, it's not effective. It's usually the last time that you can even attempt it.
Travis Bagent: it just seems to be like once you miss it or you get put in the hook, all the muscles that you were trying to use just get, you know, it's like you're all of a sudden your hand is conditioned and that it's turning easier and easier every time it's, you know, but on the flip side, you almost have to try early because you know how difficult he is in the hook. So, you know, if,
Travis Bagent: You know, it's one of those things that if I don't try early and I could have gotten him out of position and kept his wrist
Travis Bagent: potentially top rolled him. And then I find out that I thought I could only hook him. It was a close hook match, but now I'm down one to nothing. And I have no ability. Like it's over after being in a hook for 20 seconds, that thing's gone in a hook for the rest of the matches. I'm going to say Matyshenko, but it's just a close one. This is close. And listen, here's another thing. I felt really awkward with,
Travis Bagent: I thought that Sergei's hand felt soft. But once they said go, it was small. He had a small hand like me, but it was like iron. His fingers were very crazy. Yeah, but if the opponent is a hook puller, you know, your fingers don't really matter so much. I mean, he won't be even here. He will be coming in you, so your fingers, like,
Travis Bagent: Right, but you know what else I've learned is if my hand and fingers, if I come into the match with a ton of confidence, then what it allows me to do is take my grip underneath of that hooker. And then if that hooker was a top roller, I would be at a slight disadvantage if we were both top rolling. But I can give up. I can give up my ability to go crazy with a top roll because I know that you are only interested in hooking.
Travis Bagent: But in a forced touch case, you don't have to have strong fingers. Allen you need is just to know that your opponent is a hook puller. Yeah, you know he's a hook puller and you don't have to stick your hand all the way up in there. Keep that thing hand to hand and keep your wrist as far away from Matyshenko as you possibly can. I can't imagine that if he's being told, if he's being coached, that coach is saying, listen,
Travis Bagent: I'm not sure. The hook match, you prepare for your hook and get ready for it because there's a chance you can't stop him from hooking you. But we have to give it a try. We got to give it a try early and we got to give it a try with some intelligence so that it doesn't work against us, like you said, because nothing's worse than being hooked while trying to top roll and then you're confident. So are we saying that, like, just...
Travis Bagent: I'm asking your opinion, unless your name is Devon, that anyone who is pulling against Matyushenko needs to be ready for a hook war? I mean, 100%. Yes. And listen. And it's almost automatic, it looks like.
Engin Terzi: Like automatic, like, can you show me some film? How far would you have to go back to see Matochenko not having the ability? I will tell you something, Matochenko was like 18 or 19. He pulled against prime Taras, talking about 20 years ago and nobody knew about him. So I saw that and then I made a post about this. Look, look at this guy. Taras beat him 6-0, but every round it was like a drag hook and Taras took
Engin Terzi: almost everybody's wrist, including John. And can you believe that at that age, he was able to protect his wrist against Taras. But I would like to see also 115 kilo Devon versus Matushenko. I want to see where Matushenko calls wrist. He thinks, I think, Matushenko thinks he can hook.
Travis Bagent: Devon, but he thinks possibly Devon will beat him in insights. Yeah, he just won't be able to pin him at the very end until it's a problem. But listen, I like a guy like Matyshenko that is so deliberate at putting Devon somewhere where, I mean, am I wrong by thinking that's where Devon's the most vulnerable? Hook?
Engin Terzi: And losing weight. Getting him to be on a diet. Listen, listen, listen. 115 kilos Devon can make like this. Right now, he's forcing himself for a mission to pull Levan while weighing heavy. But other than that, I think that like everyday Devon, I think he can make 115 in one day. Yeah, well. I'm not talking about 105. I'm talking about 115, you know. I know what you're saying. I'm just telling you that.
Engin Terzi: He was huge in Arlington. No, I know, but listen, he's not going to stay there forever. He's bigger than Brian Shaw. He's bigger than Brian Shaw. He's not going to stay there forever. This is what I tried to tell you. I got you. I'm just saying. Listen, if he stays there forever, that is not good for his health. I think that he should, like, I don't know.
Travis Bagent: I like Devon. I think that if we make Devon, we need a Devon that is not pushing the limits to the 300 for the 215ers and the 105 guys. So the secret is getting him down even to 115 and then having such an amazing specialized offensive puller.
Travis Bagent: Hey, that's something I'd pay a ticket for. Like, I don't want the ticket if I don't see a dominant way for a guy to finish. Matyshenko has a potentially dominant way to finish some of these matchups.
Engin Terzi: and Devon left-handed, like I think Mateshaker's the favorite. It will happen sooner or later, but if Devon is already pushing his weight up, I don't think that he's going to cut to 253 and then go back there. So I think until he pulls against Levan, I think he will stay heavy. And Emilian Mario says, hello Engin, you are the last hope versus Samusha. Hmm.
Engin Terzi: I don't think my friend, but I can pull for... How dare you use the champ's name in vain like that. We apologize, Samusha. We apologize. Anyway, so maybe I want to start with Mindaugas and let's see where it will go. Yeah. And so let's go...
Engin Terzi: So you said that Ivan is going to win, but not easy, like close? Yeah, yeah. Close, close. I'm going Matyshenko. Close match, though. And also, both are coming off a loss. It's close, close, close. Hmm. Okay, who is coming out of loss? Say again? You said that they are coming from a loss or something, you said?
Engin Terzi: Yeah, right, right. Sergey lost and Matushenko lost. No, Sergey just beat Frank Lampard. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm thinking Sergey's match with Georgii, but I guess he did have a match. Yeah, yeah. Jin Seng. Jin Seng is good. I got you. No worries. I'm all right. I got you. Yeah, you're right. And Matushenko lost with left arm versus Ali Can, but this is a right arm match. So let's go to the...
Engin Terzi: Next one. Okay. David Dadikian, Georgii Svetkov, left arm. Just remember one thing. This is Georgii Svetkov healthy.
Travis Bagent: and strong. You have seen that, right? You have also seen his left arm. He's not bad. I have. I have. This is great. This is... I believe that he will have a more deliberate, a more scientific, a better arm wrestling approach than Alex Kredetsky just seemed like
Engin Terzi: he didn't have any sort of recipe for how to change some things up, how to stay away, how to make the... I will tell you something, Travis. Alex probably has, like, stronger side pressure, stronger pressure, while... ...Georgii Swetko is a specialist about keeping himself outside of hook.
Engin Terzi: And David Dadikan is someone that needs to really control your pronator and be armless with the hand, you know. So there would be, I think that, my opinion, I don't know who's going to win because Dadikan now is getting bigger and bigger. And he told me, Engin, I want to pull Vitaly Laletin. That's what he said. So he wants to pull Vitaly Laletin. And like, whenever I mentioned this,
Engin Terzi: Nobody says that Vitaly is going to kill him. Everyone says, you know, anything can happen, you know, so far, what people think. So what I just say is that I don't think that some people think that Dadikyan is easy on the paper. I disagree. I don't know who is going to win, but I don't think that... Do you think that, like, Dadikyan can maybe top roll?
Travis Bagent: No. I mean, I don't... I mean, not that he can... Listen, he can try to hook him. Georgii can try to top roll him. And then when that match goes, it really never moves. And it really turns into them equalizing each other's lane. But eventually, if that happens, that's in favor of Datakon. I think Datakon's stronger and has a 50-50 chance of going in his lane. So...
Travis Bagent: This is an uphill battle. And listen, none of that surprises me. And listen, sometimes some guys would rather arm wrestle big guys than lose weight and arm wrestle little guys.
Travis Bagent: Dada Khan is a prime example that him down at 105, that ain't necessarily the best version of him. When he comes in there chubby, his left arm is crazy strong. This is going to be real interesting. I think Georgii has to really show us.
Travis Bagent: This dude's a superior arm wrestler. And right now, you can argue that he lacks just a little bit of arm and side pressure, or everybody's in trouble with him right-handed. Like, it's so close. You have to be able to arm wrestle right-handed against Georgii with a compromised hand at some point during the match. Some of the guys can do it. Some can't. Datakhan left-handed, if he's compromised,
Travis Bagent: how devastating is it to him that's the question i'm saying dotacon like you said is on a mission i like i like fedcoff but i'm going dotacon close 70 30 and it has a lot to do with
Travis Bagent: Even if he is able to manipulate and get some sort of outside release, I don't think he can get enough. And that even when it's compromised, but still tight and close, Dada Khan will have enough side pressure. But it's going to be close. It's going to be close.
Engin Terzi: And Fedkoff looked better than I've ever seen him in Arlington. His silhouette, the hardness of his upper body, he was awesome. So, we'll see. Okay. Yeah. Somebody wrote that if Georgii Fedkoff beats Dadikian, then Devon should automatically be ranked, but we don't do the ranking that way, my friend. That is the recent results. Devon needs to beat
Engin Terzi: uh people from you know like like higher ranks and then then then he can rank higher just not like that he had a win some years ago or something you know harry on no top role i heard minday's favorite arm master of travis i am a fan i'm a fan i'm a fan i like him i like him yeah do you cry when he loses no nobody i'm too
Engin Terzi: yeah yeah yeah okay so so then then i won't i cannot make you cry so anyways so let's go pauline versus david samusha and what's the weight 95. so paul's gonna be light huh no paul always pulls except two matches all of paul's matches were 95.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, but I just feel like the last couple of times I've seen him, he has been swelled up. When he pulled against Rustam in Orlando, he was 95. And when he pulled against... Oh, so Samusha is up then, right? Yeah, yeah. I think that two days ago, yesterday, he shared the photo. He said he is 88 kilos now.
Travis Bagent: So he is about like... Yeah, I mean, this is awesome. We've kind of already seen it. Paul was close. I mean... Paul won that match. I mean, I'm just saying, like, Paul's... This is a match that he can win. It's just, man, I've just seen Samusha step up so many times. No matter what happens. Round one, I've seen Samusha absolutely dominated
Travis Bagent: three times probably right no i think i think round one i i think um i don't know how it went you talking about their first match no not even their first match just in general i have seen i've seen them pull and it's close right it's really close paul was able to win and then i've seen samusha in trouble multiple times after round one around two and then just continue what is it 10 times
Travis Bagent: Yeah, he won 10 times. Yeah, so, I mean, what kind of, I mean, listen, I'm stuck, right? I love Paul Elin where he lives one hour and a half up the road. He is an absolute pillar in the community. He's an outstanding human being. But when he says 95 kilo, then do you think the things are, do you think that... Yeah, he's got... David Samusha, who won 10 times world title in 85 kilo.
Engin Terzi: like how close can he come to uh what he did in 85 kilo in 95 kilo when there is rustam when there is rustam when there is iraqi when there are other guys you know like petrenko now we have
Travis Bagent: Yeah, you have to assume that because of how entertaining and close the 85 matches have looked, that it's not going to be real easy for him to win at 95. However, it's not easy for Paul to win at 95 kilograms. So...
Travis Bagent: It's close. It's so close. I'm just telling you that I love rooting for the Americans. Paul Linn's probably our favorite guy. And with all of that said, he's still the underdog because the champ is an absolute just killer. And, you know, he's been on such a win streak. I'm, you know, I'm saying it's,
Engin Terzi: It's close. And because it's close, that's just how much respect for Samusha that I have. Okay. So, Arthur Makarov, Daniel Prokopchuk. Wow. Incredible. This is close, man. This is close. This is close. If you would have said... One second, Travis. Let me...
Engin Terzi: Fix your video. Fix your video. Yeah, yeah, because somebody calling my, let me try to come back. Yeah, now it's back. Okay, yeah, go ahead. Yeah, there's a great argument for both of these guys. You pull Mendoza's tape, you see,
Travis Bagent: Daniel hand on him 3-0. Fourth match, runs into trouble, ends up losing. It was 2-0 and then 4-3 ended, yeah. Okay, but it looked... Yeah, I mean, almost the same thing. Yeah, no problem. And listen, you're on this Mundagas high and it's great. And then you see Mundagas and Arthur and it's, you know, it had its...
Travis Bagent: If you're looking for some way for Mendoza to get just a little more, and then maybe it could have turned into something. It didn't. Then I think Arthur's last performance was even more impressive. I mean, just the control and all that. But I believe that Daniel's arm is much stronger than Mendoza's.
Travis Bagent: And I know he wants it. I think that you could be in this little, if there's a little triangle there where Mendoza has a chance against Daniel. And I think it has a lot to do with Daniel's like nonchalant attitude with Mendoza after he was up 2-0. But whatever the case, Arthur kept the gas on and he handled Mendoza. So you got to make him the favorite. But I think that it could be.
Travis Bagent: Daniel can beat Arthur. Arthur can beat Mandaugas. And Mandaugas can pull Daniel much better. That is a possibility. I'm rooting for Daniel. I just have a little more relationship with him. But this is a great match. These, in my opinion, these are the two best guys that are going at it right now. Yeah, yeah. The two best guys in that weight class.
Engin Terzi: Engin, will we see Artem Taranenko at East vs. West or King Gozu table? I don't have, he won two qualifications and we invited, but he didn't do well, so right now I don't have a plan for him. Let's go. Gennady vs. Ibrahim Sago. 115 kilo world title match. Yeah, this is an awesome match too. I believe that Gennady
Travis Bagent: That class could be awesome for him. I believe that Gennady has a few more tools in the toolbox. I'm not sure if he has one any sharper than the pressing hook that Ibrahim is going to give to him. This is a great match. I could see, much like Reno, it taking a few starts before Gennady can put the brakes on
Travis Bagent: it's best of five right yeah no no seven this is the world title because reno reno is injured i'm gonna say four to two gannati and him having to come back definitely to have to come back from behind so whether he loses the first two rounds or loses round one and three he will be down
Travis Bagent: 2-1 or 2-0 before. I do believe he has just enough grit and enough stopping power, and he just seems to feed off the energy once he does stop the match. So, yeah, I think it's going to be close, though, and I wouldn't be surprised either if we find out that
Travis Bagent: There's not much, because listen, there's really not much difference. Like, Reno and Ibrahim was awesome. It was awesome. It was awesome. And there is a chance that those two top guys are better than, where is Gennady ranked at? We have him around 6th to 9th. Where is he ranked at in the Super Heavies? Gennady? Yeah. Okay, the first is Levan, and then Devon, and then
Engin Terzi: Ermes, and then Jerry, and then Michael, and then Gennady. I think Gennady is sixth, I think. So here it is. Does the, how far down the super heavyweight rankings do we feel comfortable with the lower class champion having a chance? I, right now... Listen, I wasn't judged like that because the 140 Gennady and 115 Gennady are not the same Gennady. 140 Gennady
Travis Bagent: would do crazy things in 115. But whenever he loses the weight, then we don't know what's going to happen. No doubt. So let's say, just a general opinion, if you are a super heavyweight that even has the option of getting to the 115 class. Do you know who's going down to possibly to 115? Hold on, let me think. Who's going down? Morozov.
Engin Terzi: Morozov was 140 kilos of muscle. I know. Do you know who? I will tell you. Dave Chaffee. Oh, yes. Yes. And that's a good place for him. Yeah. Because he is eating, drinking, everything is 125 kilos. No doubt. If he can lose just five kilos and then five kilos of water lost, 115 and then competition day, he's already over 120 kilos. And he would do, listen, that's very exciting.
Travis Bagent: to see him against all those guys, it would be incredible. Yeah. Yes. And it's, it would, it would put the fire back in the promotional standpoint with his name. So it's great. It's good for everybody. Yeah. Yes. Definitely. Yeah. Okay. So who is winning? Gennady winning or the? Gennady's going to win for whatever reason. I can't believe that Gennady was 140 and he's got to go all the way to 115. That does scare me. Listen, do you know what was happening before?
Engin Terzi: He pulled Devon. He was actually going down. And then he pushed himself for the weight. He was ready to pull Devon both in 115 and super heavyweight. So we decided to do super heavyweight match. So I think that right now probably he has maximum 15 kilos left. And I think that he's going to lose
Engin Terzi: six, seven, eight kilo or something, like Devon did, water loss. Yeah. I'm going to say Gennady four to two, but he is behind in the match at some point. He is behind. Okay. Arm in one bedroom. Engin versus Travis right hand today, who would win? Of course me. Mask him, ask Travis, who has the winning record?
Engin Terzi: Okay, now crazy match. Crazy, crazy, crazy match. Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy. And this match first time happened when you won the overalls in 2005 Zloty. Oh, you said that nobody cares about the overalls, right? Okay, yeah, let's forget about that. Nobody cares about the overalls. So you be careful when you talk. I will remind you.
Travis Bagent: Well, I mean, it depends. In that particular tournament, no one cared about the break classes. Allen the money was in the overall. So, yeah, no problem. Listen, in the event, the overall had a key. Yeah, the biggest problem with our match is that I didn't think I could win the overall after the match I had in my class.
Engin Terzi: i look at that match it was either lose and i think that listen listen i'll pull you in the losers bracket right you had already lost listen listen 15 20 seconds your match with the uh yes just go watch your match oh yeah i know yeah i just want you to know for me that was a two minute match it wasn't yeah but in my my cardio you know what you said it was losing side yes i took i took
Engin Terzi: then victor's wrist and then you know the elbow pets were like across each other not angled like this yeah and he was just current uh world champion and he was probably 100 100 not 100 times yeah keep talking keep talking keep talking no no i will wait for you just come hold on yes how you doing what i'm doing i'm on this podcast i got like no time what can i do for you you need me to sign something
Travis Bagent: He doesn't have a podcast. He's lying to you. My God. You're the man. Sorry about that. You can keep him. Allen right. Sorry about that. I had the insurance man at the door. Insurance man at the door. Oh. He wanted to give me a new roof. He wanted to give me a new roof. Okay. Anyways. Anyways. Forget about it. Rooster and Baba have touchings. Wow. I just am hoping. I am hoping that...
Travis Bagent: Finally, Todd can figure it out in that it's not a just matchup problem for him. But I would say the last two times that they pulled, I thought Matt was good. I mean, I thought that Todd was going to win. But for some reason, I don't give Rustam Babayev the respect and honor that he deserves because he is amazing. And
Engin Terzi: I just hope for the United States and for Todd Hutton's sake that he can get this monkey off his back, so to speak, and finally get a win. Yeah, a lot of people are criticizing you being too biased for where you are from. And a lot of people are complaining to me, you know, also privately about you. Yeah. No, no, not only because of that. They, I don't know.
Travis Bagent: I mean, who is controlling them, but yeah. Anyway, so Mike, I think you're doing a great job. I think you're doing a great job. And I love- Listen, we need a little variety so that way you see if it's a good job or not. Like to me, I'm open to share the mic because I'm trying to learn too, like every day.
Travis Bagent: forcing the producers, Adam, Neil, Robert, everybody that, you know, everybody's doing what they think they should be doing, but they would love to be told exactly what you can and can't do. So I, and I have, if I lose that, that comedy feel, I don't know if I'm, I don't know if I would be as effective. So just so the arm wrestling world knows, and you know, I'm trying as hard as I can. I'm enjoying it.
Travis Bagent: and as long as it keeps going on it'll keep going on but yeah i definitely uh i definitely understand the uh me being the american fan boy not only that people also think that you are often repeating the same things you know they think that way yeah anyway and they are right and they are right because that's it's a five-hour show yeah they're right it's tough um yeah okay
Engin Terzi: Todd Hutchings versus Rustem, you are, okay, sporting Todd, I understand, but can you give us some objective insights, you know, like. I mean, yeah, listen, I just think that also that Todd is like literally getting better.
Travis Bagent: So, obviously, I feel that there's an opportunity and I think that Todd has gotten better to the point that he can, you know, right this wrong, right? That's in his life, right? Like, this has to be one of the few matches that Todd Hutchings really feels a little bit of pressure. Because he's usually a pretty easygoing guy. There has to be, well, at least you could presume,
Travis Bagent: This is one of these matches that he kind of matters to him. Yeah, a lot. Yeah, and it also, too, it really just reiterates that Rustam's a bad, he's an awesome guy. And I think that because of Todd's popularity right now, maybe not for Rustam and his family, but for the arm wrestling world, I know I could be wrong about this because I'm an American, but I think that Todd's the favorite. Mm-hmm.
Engin Terzi: But the reality is that he's never won. So, you know. Yeah, I mean, yeah. Yeah, he didn't win. Yeah, but all I will just say that two times that Todd pulled against Rustam and lost, Todd was the guy either this or this. Now, the guy has this. But it's not the same Todd. But
Engin Terzi: When Todd loses, Todd is losing against the people who controls his pronator. The first time when Prudnik beat him, he was able to control. And then second time, it's Dadikian beat him, and he couldn't even go to strap. Dadikian hit and was strong. So Rustam may be one of those that... Yeah, kryptonite. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But I don't know yet. I don't know what's going to happen.
Engin Terzi: I don't know if Todd would know better himself. I don't know if Todd should pull outside by hoping that he can neutralize Rustam's wrist. If he can do that, he's going to win that match because nobody can play the flat wrist side pressure game with Todd as far as I have witnessed. You understand? And so Rustam needs to control him.
Engin Terzi: If Rustam, if Todd makes all the game plan outside and Rustam hooks him, that's bad news for Todd. Do you understand? Because like you are dividing your outside game and inside game during the preparation. But if Todd thinks that he may not be able to get out and he does fully inside game against Rustam, you know, because, because I mean, if you realize
Travis Bagent: that he can beat Todd inside, even he brought him right from here. I would never think that Todd is here and he was able to lift him from there and win. So do you agree? I don't know what you think. Yeah, I mean, I think what you're saying, and it's interesting too, what Todd believes that does he have, does he have a problem with doing his normal stuff against Rustam? And the only reason he would do
Travis Bagent: the normal game plan if he hasn't, you know, he may have already expanded, like you said. He may already be different Bullard. But does Todd think that he has to do something new or does he think that he could do the old style with this new strength? That's interesting. I am praying that Todd gets over this hump because this is the championship match as well, right? Yeah.
Travis Bagent: Yeah, I think that plays in Todd's favor, although it's funny, too, because all those times in the past, you know, some of those matches were over six rounds. And just when you thought that, oh, okay, well, Todd's going to get stronger as we go, it almost started getting a little bit easier for Rustam. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's how it happens. One guy is dominant. Do you know how it is? Like, you are... You have endurance...
Engin Terzi: at the power that you have. If something heavier than what you can handle is happening all the time, you get exhausted, you understand? And then you can't really. It's just like you can hold 40 kilos, but somebody is dropping 45 kilos, he goes like this, 45 again. Because if the guy is stronger and he is beating you, he's not getting tired either. You are the one that is trying to handle something more than you can.
Engin Terzi: Anyway, so, yeah, Neil is in the chat. Hello, hello, hello, Neil. Great to see you, my friends. And we need to do podcasts. You and Travis are the top two that I enjoy talking on, I think, for sure. Yeah, I think we should do three of us and maybe add one more, and then we do four of us. Anyway, so you are saying another thing is that, like, I think that Todd has never managed to go to Stratford-Rushton.
Engin Terzi: But possibly he may do it this time. Yeah, we will see. But the rush time I saw in Atlantic City against Sandris,
Travis Bagent: was a dangerous one. Yeah, I didn't think he could. I thought Stodgers would be too big. And then to, uh, to Kevin vanguard ish, you know, just hogging the hook and he would shut it down, but it really wasn't close. Yeah. Rustam's a bad dude, but let's go. Todd Zilla. Keep it going, Todd. Devon't lose that belt so soon. Okay. And the main event.
Engin Terzi: Go ahead. Say the names. Let me hear it. Come on, Travis. I want to hear you say it. I can tell by the way you say the names. I can tell who you think is going to win. Michael Todd versus Vitaly Laletin. And people are saying, why Travis cannot say the names correctly? And I tell them it's because Travis doesn't care.
Engin Terzi: Travis is so spoiled and feels so secure in his place that he says, however I say the names and you will invite me no matter what. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. This is great, right? This is great because I do believe that we are, we are, I don't even know who we want to win. Honestly, like the arm wrestling world. Why do we need to want someone to win? You know?
Travis Bagent: Well, I mean, yeah, once again, I'm putting Michael Todd in the same category as Egla. And I am telling Egla and Michael Todd, don't ruin the potential super heavyweight match.
Engin Terzi: And in my opinion... Why not Michael pulling Levan? You are saying that... It's no problem. You are saying that if Michael beats Levan, he is going to ruin the
Travis Bagent: la latin versus devon match so no no no no no and that's going to ruin it too i want to see vitale and levon what is the problem why can't we set this up well listen listen like do you listen listen one second wait you ask a question so we are
Engin Terzi: in April right now, they will pull in May, and we know that Levan is pulling in June, and we know that Levan pulls twice a year, so his second match will be end of the year. So do you want me, Laletin, to wait from when did he pull the last time the right-arm match? He pulled left-arm match, and you want me to keep Vitaly Laletin without the right-arm match from November?
Engin Terzi: No, I don't want to. Listen, why you say that we don't set Laletin versus Levan? I mean, I am ready to set, but does Laletin want to be inactive for 13 months with right arm? No, I don't think that we want him to be inactive. We want to see him pull Michael Todd. We want to see him pull Devon. You're doing everything right. However...
Travis Bagent: If I'm talking to Michael Todd, do not ruin this for us. Because right now, we don't feel like you or Devon can beat LeVon today. Right now, I will tell you this, Devon's got enough behind him that it's okay to set that match, right? I'm okay to see that match, Devon and LeVon. Because listen, when Devon is hung, listen, we saw, like, listen, Devon today,
Engin Terzi: is not the same but i i was surprised like why would devon show up 265 70 pounds against levan on uh april 2024 you understand and today what devon is doing is the right strategy you know i mean you you two you two make your endurance effective you first need to be you know like understand really like
Travis Bagent: Yeah, I'm waiting for LeVon to go down. As of right today, I am starting to gain some energy about Ermes and LeVon.
Engin Terzi: I'm starting to get behind Ermi. I like the shit talking. I like the post that said, you think I'm using fake weights because you can't lift the weights. It was surprising, huh? Surprising. I'm ready, right? Today, one of the idiots told me that Engin, I think you told Levan to say it's like a fake waist. It would never even come to my mind, you know, like, and Levan,
Engin Terzi: Devon had no mercy. He talked a lot. He said, tell him to come to Tbilisi so I can teach him how to train properly. And I said, why you don't show your waist? He says, because I don't want him to be scared type of thing. You understand? Of course. And Ermes also, yesterday he made a video. He also said things. And so I think... And it was...
Travis Bagent: Ernie, his time off makes a guy like me start to think that he has no chance. But then you see him in Tbilisi. Opposite way. Well, I'm saying you also, but for me, you see him in Tbilisi and he's a beast.
Travis Bagent: perfect yeah right he did great so now i'm starting to build that but just know that i want to see levon go down so i want to see vitale then i want to see devin then michael todd i don't care but as of today i believe vitale has the best opportunity to put levon's hand and wrist
Travis Bagent: in a place where we can start to see maybe a lack of arm wrestling skills. Not that he has a lack of arm wrestling skills. We are hoping as fans that he gets tied up, right? And then he starts to lose his endurance and Vitaly can win or Devon can win or Michael Todd can win. What I don't want to see is Michael Todd beat LeVon so that we understand that there's more of a
Travis Bagent: group of four and they're under Lavon. I don't like, I don't want Devon, Vitaly, Ermes and Michael Todd to all be in the same little category and we don't have any faith in any of them. Right today, I have a tremendous amount of faith in Vitaly Lilletin right-handed. I hope that Michael Todd doesn't ruin it May 10th so quickly, but on the flip side,
Engin Terzi: I don't understand that part. If Michael is beating Vitaly, why doesn't it give you hope that maybe Michael is the one that will beat Levan? Because, listen, I will tell you something. Ermes is a very strong guy. I will tell you. Ermes wasn't comfortable with Levan's giant hand and powerful wrist and everything. It is very, very hard to take their hand, you know. But when Ermes can have a good grip, Ermes is a strong guy. And Ermes...
Engin Terzi: I don't know what you are thinking, but Ermes barely beat Michael in Tbilisi. I agree. Yeah, Ermes did everything perfectly. He played everything. If Ermes would just try to beat him, he would probably lose that match. Ermes and Michael, they played a chess game, which Ermes won. And so what I'm just saying that, like, Michael...
Travis Bagent: It's too fresh in our brains, Zing, and it's too fresh. If Michael Todd beats Vitaly, it will be a great show, but it will prove that there is only one true contender, and that is Devon Larry. How do you know? Maybe Michael is going to get better, and then maybe Michael is the one to beat. Levan, how do you know that? Why not? Listen, you caught me too early. I don't know. The only thing I want to say is that
Engin Terzi: like to hold michael and beat like this is not that easy he stops you so what i'm just trying to say that if i didn't see levan doing this before i would just think that that there is a danger for levan but yeah but after levon listen after levon
Engin Terzi: The way he chose to pull Jerry Catarat will be a big problem for Michael Todd as well. Yeah. Listen, listen. There is a guy that Ermes barely beat, Matt. You've got to be kidding. One guy said Ermes barely beat Michael Todd. He said, you've got to be kidding. My friend, just watch. Go and watch what Ermes says. Hey, Andre. Andre, he is the boss.
Engin Terzi: But I agree with you, Andre. I just couldn't say it to his face. Yeah, come on, Travis. You are just a shit-starter, you know. Ermes himself said that. Ermes said that he was that close, you know. Anyway, so, okay. You are just, we need to, like, one second. Joseph Cook says, Engin, if Neil Pickup can get his wrist healthy,
Engin Terzi: Can we get a Neil Pickup versus Travis match that is guaranteed money? I'm into that one. That's the first opponent anyone has ever offered that I accept. I am in. Let's go. Let's go. Okay. Diabolical Billy says, Travis,
Engin Terzi: The geezers like if a monster truck and a game show host had a love child, then race his own protein powder ego and chance of USA. Now he is less world champion and more QVC pitchman with delusions of grandeur. I don't know what that means. Yeah, hey, let me...
Travis Bagent: Let me translate that for you. Okay. That's saying that Travis used to be good. He's not that good anymore. He's more of a side show game show host and the monster truck and the game show hosts are just like the monster truck being overwhelming, loud, obnoxious, the game show host trying to be funny. I got you kid. I agree with everything you said. Listen, listen, like we,
Engin Terzi: That is the part, Travis. Like, if people didn't see those times, you understand, they don't realize how good some people were. And, yeah, I mean, like, everything has an end, you understand? Like, we will never, I mean, look at John Bersink. Do you think that John Bersink you saw in Arlington is the same John Bersink that you saw in 2006 Vegas? Yeah, no doubt.
Travis Bagent: I wish that Yoshi would have had the wherewithal, the intelligence, the, you know, reading the room better. He should have gave a little one that round three. If John wins round three, the place in Arlington, you're not getting your security deposit back.
Engin Terzi: yeah but people people people are not naive you know anyway so i mean i don't know hey let me ask you this let me ask you this question do you think that vitali lalettan will train differently and listen listen people go there dino i'm a big fan big hermes fan but yes hermes barely won he says and now no super chat yeah let's go um okay so you start what do you
Engin Terzi: do you think about that match like like you know michael forever how difficult it is to flash pin him do you agree that michael is the probably the best defensive puller
Travis Bagent: He's definitely the most consistent, meaning it doesn't matter how good you are, the breaks do get stopped. It doesn't matter. And you have to show some ability to transition.
Engin Terzi: And do you think Laletin is one of the best flash pinners, that explosive guy? I mean, there's no doubt about it because it's like... Okay, so what I just tried to say, how would you rank Pushkar and today's Vitaly? Because in Pushkar's prime, Vitaly was like 110-kilo guy. Now he's 150-kilo. But Pushkar had one of those strong grip and the incredible back pressure and...
Engin Terzi: followed with a side pressure. So Michael was able to stop. Like Michael pulled like two super matches and 12 rounds in those super matches and 10 rounds he put a break on Andriy. And he defeated him eight times. So what do you think? What is the possibility of, okay, listen, the way that you talk,
Engin Terzi: Like, oh, Michael is going to ruin, you know, this, like, Valetian versus Levan match. So you seem like you believe Michael is going to beat Vitaly.
Travis Bagent: i believe that there is a style problem that would give the indication and the loss to vitality it's just it's a fact and here's another bit of evidence i don't like the way i didn't like the way vitality pulled um camille left-handed i think he lacked a little bit of surgeon a little bit of technique and he did it so
Travis Bagent: which power and he did it with his style, but he didn't do it perfectly. So that just leaves the door open that the tally is not going to change anything up. And we have not seen a guy able to pull that way against Michael Todd. I mean, we have seen people beat Michael Todd that did it their way, but man, it takes a little bit.
Travis Bagent: And then as soon as we saw Vitaly's wrist fold a little bit the other day against Morozov, I didn't – it was more panic. It was more panic and aggression than it was any sort of calm, you know, like –
Travis Bagent: uh kind of masterful maneuvering in order to get it back it was this is what i'm doing they say go i am out leveraging out hiding and then i am an outside puller all the way to the corner of the pad and he was able to beat um he was able to beat camille but
Travis Bagent: That match could happen again. That was close. Yeah, very close. So we're saying Michael Todd has the ability to make sure that Vitaly has to do some maneuvering. He has to have his balance and control. He's got to be able to hit second three, four, five times in order to finish Michael Todd.
Travis Bagent: If he does and he's not that guy, it's going to be thrilling if he can't pin him and Mike's able to come up and push. And I also think that Michael can gamble a little bit more to try to do something to stop it because I don't think that, I don't know if Vitaly can beat him in a hook or like, I think Vitaly has less power than the other guys, but more devastating position and control.
Travis Bagent: This is close, it's close, but man, listen, let's put Vitaly some respect on this man's name and say that he's a bad dude and he's the second guy. That match with Ermes was so close and Ermes is, you know, that match is the only bad thing on the resume. Besides that,
Travis Bagent: I mean, I guess he's getting pushed down by... When you say that Vitaly is the second guy, is it runner-up after Devon, or do you think he can beat Devon? I don't know if he can beat Devon, but I just want him to do... He can do more damage at the start to Devon than Devon seems to be able to do. And then we're waiting on Devon to do it at the end, but it's not getting there. Vitaly, I think, can be...
Travis Bagent: a real problem at the very beginning, hand to hand, and more devastating than any of the other guys right now. So, and I could be wrong, but I want to see Vitaly and Levan. Where would you bet your money on Michael or Vitaly?
Travis Bagent: I'm putting my money on Vitaly, but I'm not putting that much money on it, and I'm going to have a victory celebration with Michael Todd if he is able to do that, because it will be awesome. Okay, okay. What is the possibility that match could be flash pinned by Vitaly three times?
Travis Bagent: Very small, very small opportunity. There is a good opportunity to do it two times and then the third one be uneventful because after the brief stoppage
Travis Bagent: Vitaly is able to still win. He could win easy 3-0, but he can't win without being stopped. And you know what I thought too? I thought Michael's initial, I like when Michael gets way up here and flies out. And he usually does it early in every match. And he looked pretty good doing it with Ermes.
Engin Terzi: Mike needs to focus on that and do it more than one time. Because if he does, Vitaly has to be more careful than Ermias of not getting hung up. So you are saying that since you said that it is very, very little, Vitaly to flash pin Michael three times. So you are saying that it means that you're putting the money on Vitaly. So you are saying that that match can stop.
Engin Terzi: and Vitaly still can win. He may not win the match that stopped, but he can win the next start or the start after that. You are saying that Vitaly fresh winning two rounds and the third round he is getting stopped and he is having a war.
Engin Terzi: Having awards, one thing, his elbow coming off the pad. Yeah, yeah. Getting a restart. But it is still round three. So you cannot tell me that, oh, he's going to have quickly two elbow fouls and the round three will finish that way. That is, we don't know. So if the match is going to stop, are you saying that that match is going to be easy win with Michael? I don't think so. Michael is not going to beat Vitaly.
Engin Terzi: before Vitaly kind of gets exhausted within the rounds. You understand? He will still be the one who is attacking, attacking, attacking. So you are saying that after such a war, one more round, he's going to flash pin Michael. He's going to realize he has to. He has to, but he couldn't do it on round three when he was fresh. After you do it twice. After you do it twice. Listen, he did it twice. He did it twice for everybody.
Engin Terzi: This is happy for everybody to not go as hard. Round three is gonna have a war and then he won't be a fresh and he will he may so flash been Michael. You're putting words in my mouth and your mouth about the war. Okay. Like let's define war. Listen, listen, round three, how is it gonna be not a war? Since you and I, we both agree that that match.
Engin Terzi: is not going to end before Laletin is exhausted, you know. No, no, but let's go back to Morozov and Vitaly. After that, I mean, listen, Vitaly can still arm wrestle. First of all, Morozov got injured badly, first of all. Second of all, Morozov pulling that style and Michael pulling that style about the memory of that style
Engin Terzi: Like, Michael's memory is right here, pulling this, that he can pull three years in a row, you know? Yeah, but I'm telling you, man, Morozov, there's more, there's more, there's more resistance from Morozov from here to here than it will be with Michael. No, what I'm saying, endurance, endurance, I talk with Morozov, Morozov said he got injured. He said on round one and round two, both rounds, he got, you know,
Engin Terzi: Like, elbow, you know, like the truth is, round one, when Morozov stopped Vitaly and beat him, I thought it was over. Probably you thought the same way. Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Even the look on Vitaly's face, like, he was really, I mean, that first round took a lot out of him.
Travis Bagent: And I was, and honestly, very impressed with how he, you know, injury or not, very impressed with how Vitaly responded. I'm telling you that if Vitaly is intelligent, he can be absolutely overwhelming, similar to the way Ermes was. Because even though Ermes, it was close, Ermes was also just one step ahead of
Travis Bagent: everything it was perfect and ended up having to really do it four times not even three times because of winning the the whatever that was there in match three or getting or match two match three and getting the restart again so there's a valid argument that ermy beat michael todd four straight times
Travis Bagent: So I wouldn't be surprised at all seeing how awesome, and you know, Michael's gotta adjust too, to the height of Vitaly. We don't know that he even has an answer for that as well.
Travis Bagent: It's going to be, yeah, Vitaly wins. I'm hoping Michael Todd proves me wrong. But let's go with just from a strict fan of East vs. West and a very deviant human being that is jealous of all the champs, always wants them to lose.
Travis Bagent: in my mind there's two guys right now that can beat levon probably i should put ermis in there so let me just go two and a half ermis half but we have devin that's probably you know and the only reason is is we love him and we recognize the the the difference in weight his personal weight
Engin Terzi: he's getting better and he's awesome and then the last guy the guy that has the best chance right now in my opinion is Vitaly Lilletin and I don't want to listen if it is then he needs to prove himself and do it you know we are not gonna we are not gonna like we are not gonna keep Vitaly Lilletin 13 months 13 months inactive and we are not gonna give him easy matches that
Engin Terzi: We know that he's going to listen. I said him with Morozov, he beat Morozov badly. I said him with Di Dzeranov, who beat Revas very badly, and he beat him badly too. So it is normal that Vitaly is going to have tough matches. Let's see how this match will end up. One more match for Vitaly, right-handed, against Michael Todd. Then we go...
Engin Terzi: Vitaly left hand. If you have to, Vitaly left hand again. Listen, Devon and Vitaly in August, no? I mean, it is good, but also it's like it's just going to... Listen, I say this. If Michael wins, Michael says that he's not going to pull anyone until he pulls Levan. Ford Vitaly, Vitaly is saying that
Engin Terzi: He wins or lose. It doesn't matter against Michael. He wants to pull against Devon. Another thing, one last thing I will ask you and then we will finish. What do you think about Vitaly's potential? Do you think that Vitaly maybe like this guy is, you know, and he is already 150 kilos. He doesn't really show the weight. He doesn't look, you know, bloated. He doesn't look
Engin Terzi: fat he doesn't like so he can carry probably 20 more kilos i don't know how much he will help but do you think that with his full potential you know like he may be he may become someone even more than we can imagine
Travis Bagent: There's no doubt about it. And listen, here's the real deal. At what point does he decide that that 20 kilograms is what's needed? He may not need it. No, no, I'm not saying he needs it, but I'm just saying that the guy is getting bigger. He told me that he was 123 kilos when he pulled Levan at top eight.
Engin Terzi: 123 kilos, now 27 kilos. People may say that the weight doesn't automatically mean power or something, but this guy still looks skinny when he was 123 kilos. So the weight and weight is different. Some weight gains are not. I'm now 91 kilos, no good weight. But, you know, if you gain by really size, then you may become... And I could be wrong, but to me, Vitaly looks better every time I see him.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, I agree. Maybe 2%, maybe 3%, but he's getting bigger. And honestly, he's doing it the way you're supposed to do it. Yes, yes. Best way, best way. Not like two months and 20 kilos. He gained like one kilo, two kilos, one kilo, two kilos. Yeah, you're right, you're right. And he's filling out too.
Engin Terzi: There is a question I don't think that you will answer objectively. You will probably answer in the way to tease me. Big Grove goals. Travis, is Engin going to beat Mindaugas? You will say no. No. No chance. No chance. Engin, man, listen. Do you see the gray hair on Engin? It's over. Didn't you see John Verzink?
Travis Bagent: Ingen and John, that might as well have been Ingen up there when John pulled Yoshi. Tom is undefeated. No chance. Hey, let me ask you this, and I don't want to make you mad. I don't want to make you mad. Okay, if you don't want to make me mad, don't ask me. Devon't regret. Devon't regret later. I don't want to make you mad, but do you think that there is even a chance that Mendoza and...
Travis Bagent: um uh yannis that that was uh just a stage match what match mandagas and yannis yeah how did it how did both of them look so good in the same in the same match i don't think that they they both look good i mean like when you say they look at the beginning to me yannis look good later in fact to me
Engin Terzi: Allen match long, like, it depends, you know. He liked Giannis. He liked the way Giannis operated. He liked Giannis. Listen, listen. According to you, like, if looking good is pinning the guy, is Mendiagos look better? But if you are saying that technically being better, more dominant, looking good, to me, Giannis look better.
Travis Bagent: Yeah, I think they both did an exceptional job of looking good, making the other person look good. I'm saying that they staged the match. They what? That they rehearsed the match and staged it. Fake match. Oh, come on. Come on. Come on. I don't want to make you mad, man. I know you are. I'm not mad. I'm not mad. I'm just laughing at you. Okay. Arsen you out of your mind? Arsen you out of your mind? You are...
Engin Terzi: Like one is like a real legend. Other one is legend in making and they did a historical match and you two even mentioned such a thing. It's just like, listen, like, it's just serious. It was too pretty. It was too pretty. They both did too good. Do you know why? Do you know why? Because technically, like right now, look at, look at the, look at like, who is the most money-making boxer ever?
Engin Terzi: Floyd Mayweather. Floyd Mayweather. What is his weight? 130 to 145, somewhere in there. Okay. And who is the most money-making guy in UFC? Conor McGregor. Is it still Conor McGregor? I mean, like when you say still, I mean, nobody made more than he did. You understand? Right, right. So what I'm just trying to tell you that,
Engin Terzi: Armwrestling, unfortunately, we are still in a place that, oh, bigger is the better, you know, type of thing. While the other sport disciplines, they already are over. They look for the quality in everything, you know. So, in Mindago, Starosaitis versus Yanis Amorim's match,
Engin Terzi: From the perspective of person who knows arm wrestling, it's right here, that match. Right there, you know. So, I mean, of course, the people just look at, oh, how many something bicep, how many kilos he's lifting, and they care. Like, in the past, like, they cared about those muscle cars, you know, just like with, you know, things like that. But now they more care about some other things as well.
Engin Terzi: Anyway, so it was an incredible match, yeah. And Big Grove Ghost, again, your warm-up match can be Travis. You can beat him up on your way to the fight, you know. Yeah, but here's the thing. I will tell you something. Why do these people disrespect you so much? I know Big Grove Ghost. Yeah, it's because I'm the commentator. It's because I'm the commentator. No, no, no. He's just joking. He is your fan. You know, this guy is your fan.
Engin Terzi: Of course, of course. Yeah, and he loves you. He's just joking, you know. But I will just tell you, anyone who disrespects you about your arm wrestling past is disrespecting arm wrestling. You are. Listen, like from maybe not very early of 2000s, but very near to mid-2000s to mid-2010s, I mean, you were like one of those guys. Mega. Mega.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, yeah, yeah. And everyone, everything has an end, you know, everything. Muhammad Ali had an end. I'm about to make a comeback, so I don't even want to hear about that ending shit. I'm about to make a comeback. You are going to make a comeback? Yes.
Engin Terzi: okay okay so just just i'm not gonna let you trick me i'm not gonna let you trick me in rms on these real good dudes i'm starting off with neil pickup and then we'll go from there okay just you know what you know what to do just just write me uh and then tell me you want you want to go 253 or you want to go supers
Travis Bagent: I don't know. That's going to be the test right there. That's going to be the test. Because listen, I'm just like Gennady. I can make 253, but I want to arm wrestle the 253 guys, but I want to be 300. I don't want to be 253. That's the problem. That's the problem. I just got to get my swag back. I got to start. I got to really, really...
Travis Bagent: really not even talk about it just get it done and then it would be awesome because i could light that stage up if i was strong again so we'll see but it is gonna happen ain't no doubt about it yeah yeah yeah i don't know if i'm gonna win but i'm gonna make another crack at it ain't no doubt about it but by the real one right not the real one yeah yeah i just did that last year for the money it was great too we appreciate it we appreciate it
Travis Bagent: Yeah. Anyways, thank you very, very much, Travis, and see you in Istanbul, my friend. I'll see you in Istanbul on Mother's Day and... Not on Mother's Day. Father's Day. What is it? What is May 10th? It's some holiday. It's the day before Mother's Day, I think. The second Sunday is Mother's Day, I think, yeah. Right. And then that Mother's Day, May 11th, is also my anniversary. So I just want you to know how much I love arm wrestling.
Engin Terzi: Okay. That I'll be with you. Listen, can I ask something? When you fly from, like, Sunday, you still make U.S. on Sunday, right? Yes. No worries. You're not missing. It's only a four-hour flight because of the time change. Okay, so. Easy work. Okay, so your mother is not being, okay. Anyway, so take care of yourself, Travis. Allen right, see you, buddy. Thanks to everyone, yeah, for watching us.
