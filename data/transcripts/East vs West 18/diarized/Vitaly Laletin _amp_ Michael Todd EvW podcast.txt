Engin Terzi: Hello, Vitaly. How are you? Good, and you? Good, good. Yeah, thank you. So, oh, Vitaly, you're white, really white. One hundred? One hundred thirty-seven.
Engin Terzi: 57? No, no, no. 147. Oh, 147. Okay, okay, okay. I wasn't sure because I was told that you were 150 kilos. Okay, now I understand. Hello, Ivan. Hello, Engin. How are you, my friend? I am good, thank you.
Ivan Matyushenko: Yeah, Ivan is going to help for translation, yeah. Yes, a little. Vitaly asks, when is our arm fight between me and him? You and him? When Ivan eats food. I want Vitaly to get down to 150 pounds.
Engin Terzi: I don't know about you, but someone wants to beat Vitaly. Should I say his name? I think many people want to beat him. But someone from a lighter category is coming up to beat him. He wants to beat his left arm. This is David Dadikian. He wants to beat you. You be careful.
Ivan Matyushenko: So, Vitaly thinks they should first pull between each other.
Ivan Matyushenko: I think Vitaly talks about David, that he thought that David should first fight Alijan. Oh, Alijan. And the winner gets to... Why not you pull directly with Alijan? Vitaly? Yeah? Because...
Ivan Matyushenko: I wanted to have this question for me. Because this
Ivan Matyushenko: Some fight is interesting to Vitaly. He wants to see this match. People want to see many matches. As you know, he is always ready to pull anyone. Does Vitaly think that Dadikian is a danger for him?
Vitaly Laletin: I think it's very dangerous. I think your fight was dangerous for Ilizhan. If you had changed the situation a little, it would have been much more dangerous. And David also puts a lot of competition. I think he won't even win.
Vitaly Laletin: No, I'm talking about the fact that when you fought him, you gave Rizhan danger in your fight. You fought him wrong. If you fought Malenko in a different way, the outcome could have been different. And David is now also a great danger for Rizhan, and I think that even David would win. So, you see, you're talking about David versus Rizhan, and Engin asked about the danger for you.
Ivan Matyushenko: What did Vitaly say before we started the podcast?
Ivan Matyushenko: Vitaly said that he didn't understand the question first, and he talked about the chances of David against Leshan. And he said that he finds that David has many chances against Leshan. But about himself, he thinks that he's the favorite. He's the favorite. Yes. And the question is, which one would have more chance against Vitaly?
Engin Terzi: Who is more dangerous for Vitaly? Who do you think is more difficult for you as an opponent? David or Alizhan? I think David. Sorry, Michael. When you were gone, we started the conversation. Allen good. Vitaly, you saw Michael's photo. What do you think? Did you see his recent photos?
Engin Terzi: Or no? Have you seen the picture, Michael? What do you think? I think it's Photoshop. Photoshop? Okay, one second. When you say Photoshop, it means that it can't be real. It's that good, you know? Right here. Oh, sorry. I don't know. One second. Right here.
Engin Terzi: Photoshop. Photoshop? I think this is a compliment. Compliment for Michael. I'll take it as a compliment. I'll take it as a compliment. Yeah. So, he's joking, right, Ivan? Yes. He's joking? Vitaly is joking? Arsen you joking, Vitaly, or is it true? Photoshop.
Michael Todd: Photoshop, of course. We'll figure it out on the spot. Can I ask a question to Michael? Does he live in the gym? Michael, do you live in the gym? Do I live in the gym? Well, the gym is part of the house. But, yeah, I spend a little bit of time out here. I've got a big guy in front of me. I've got to try to get strong. He has a gym in his house. Part of the house.
Ivan Matyushenko: Vitaly said that if he had such a gym, he would be a world champion. But I remind him that he is the world champion. Right. The guy has a good sense of humor, yeah.
Engin Terzi: Let's see what's going to happen. I can't believe that Vitaly has been around for 15 years and Michael has been there for 30-35 years and they have never met before. In my opinion, this is a historical match, a very important match. A lot of people are thinking that
Engin Terzi: Vitaly Laletin is clear favorite and a lot of people are also thinking that Michael will put a brake on Vitaly and he will exhaust Vitaly and he's gonna win and I would like maybe after you translate to Vitaly I would like to ask your opinion first Ivan you are not here only as a translator but I also like would like to hear you are probably told me already right during your podcast
Ivan Matyushenko: I think I already expressed my opinion in our podcast. So, Vitaly, Engin said that at the moment, well, first of all, he considers your fight to be historical. Michael has been in the sport for more than 30 years, you've been there for more than 15, probably 20 years. You've never fought. And now it turns out that many
Ivan Matyushenko: i think that last time i just i remember i started to tell you about this match at my opinion and my mobile
Ivan Matyushenko: Very instant match. I personally see Vitaly as the favorite because of his leverage, because of his explosiveness, and he's mainly
Ivan Matyushenko: his big hand, his leverage. But on the other hand, we all know that for many years no one beat Michael with a... Flashpin. Flashpin, yes. And the only chance I think for Vitaly is to flashpin Michael. But I think that he...
Engin Terzi: He's capable of that. So he can do it. If the match stops, then who is the favourite? If the match stops, Michael is the favourite for sure. Michael is the favourite. And Michael, how is your shape right now? Arsen you better than Tbilisi?
Michael Todd: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I put everything I possibly could into this match. So I fully expect to have the strongest Vitaly anyone's ever faced. So it's my job to make sure that he faces the strongest Michael anyone's ever faced. So I think we're going to have a great match. I have great respect for Vitaly. I think he is the favorite. But I'm coming for war on May 10th. I'm coming to fight.
Engin Terzi: Michael, you said that he is the favorite. He is the favorite according to the community, like popular opinion or his favorite according to you?
Michael Todd: Well, I think he'd be the favorite across the board. Just anyone who's looking at the match, they look at the size of him, they look at me, look at his age, they look at my age. He would be the favorite. He's the bigger guy, right? He's the longer lever, bigger hand. I'm just bringing something that I think is unique to me. And it's a lot of heart. I'm going to bring a lot of heart on this match on this day. So for him to beat me, he's going to have to break me.
Engin Terzi: But I will tell you something. You said that you are coming for a war. So you are determined to make it a war. Do you see yourself losing a war? Well, no, I don't. I just got to be able to stop. I mean, I understand he knows what he needs to do and I know what I need to do. And we're both going to try to do that. Right. So, like I said, it's.
Michael Todd: It sucks because I like Vitaly so much. I hate that we have to face each other, but we have to face each other to get the goal that we want, which is LeBron, right? Yeah. We don't know that. We don't know that. You made the mistake that you said that. I did. I did. My bad. My apologies. You know, the winner. And the thing is, he's already said that he's willing to pull Devon after this if he wins. No, no, no. He said that he would pull Devon no matter what the result of this match.
Michael Todd: Well, that's what I meant. You said if he wins this match. I know what I said, but what I meant was he's willing to take another match. I will not. If I win this match, it is 100% sole focus on pulling the winner of LeBron versus Ermes. I will prep harder than I've ever prepped. And the thing is, I say that this has been the best prep I've ever had in my life.
Michael Todd: Um, and it's been the most difficult because a lot of this time I didn't want to do it. Like I was in there and I just, I didn't have the drive in the, in the first part of this, I was doing the work, but I wasn't feeling it. I mean, I just didn't have that, that inner drive to, to, I wasn't enjoying it. I was just doing it the last few weeks. I've really started enjoying it. And I've really started believing that, uh, that I can bring something really special, you know, so.
Ivan Matyushenko: Can you translate quickly if you want to? Yeah, sorry about all that. No, no, no, it's okay, it's okay, yeah. In a nutshell, Vitaly, Michael said that he respects you, but this is a fight that has to happen on the way to the next goal. As far as I understand, Michael's next win is in Lebanon, perhaps.
Ivan Matyushenko: Michael also believes that he can win. And he believes that he has the best form right now. Well, the best form. And he is preparing for the war. To win the war. Behind the table. Tell him that it is an honor for me to fight him. With his best form, which now exists.
Engin Terzi: Not everyone will be able to fight in his best form. Vitaly says that it's on for him to pull Michael, especially in his best shape. Michael said the same thing. In my opinion, they both are in their absolute best shape. I have never seen Michael like this, and I have never seen...
Engin Terzi: Vitaly said that he was 123 kilos when he pulled Levan in 2019. And the first round wasn't that easy. And now he is 147 kilos. And some people gain weight and they gain weight. But Vitaly still doesn't look muscular enough. He still has room.
Engin Terzi: And so I can say that all that 24 kilo is super quality muscle, you know. And you want to say something, Michael? Well, just the size of him compared to Thor. You're like, oh, shit, he's really big. You know what I'm saying? Because, I mean, he's at that Siberian Power Show and you got Hathor Bjornsson, who's huge right now. And Batali's holding his own against him. So you're like, yeah, that's a big dude. Yeah, yeah, yeah, he is, he is, yeah. And...
Vitaly Laletin: Vitaly, do you think you're in your best shape right now? I'm not in my best shape right now, but I'll be in my best shape a little later. But now I'm in the shape I've never been in before. It's not my best shape yet, but it will be.
Ivan Matyushenko: Yes, Vitaly thinks that yesterday's form is the best he ever had, but he also thinks that his best form is in the future.
Engin Terzi: And he's obviously stronger than he was against Dzeranov. What is your main concern about pulling someone like Michael? What is the main thing that you would be worried about Michael?
Vitaly Laletin: What are the nuances in the fight? Michael can catch me at the end, try to run away with his pronator, which I will try to crush. But I hope that this will not happen. Michael is a very strong athlete, of course. But I'm good now too.
Ivan Matyushenko: that Michael is most dangerous in his defensive position with his formation there. But still Vitaly thinks that he will be able not to get to that position. Okay, so I asked this before but I want to ask again. What is the chance that he believes he's gonna flash ping Michael?
Engin Terzi: What do you think, what are the chances that you will win in touch, Michael? I think 70 to 30. 70 to 30 in Vitaly's favor. So he says that 70% is going to flash pin the match, yeah. And Michael, what do you think the chance that he's going to flash pin you? Probably the exact opposite? I'm hoping it's not 70. Yeah.
Michael Todd: Yeah, yeah. I don't know. I don't know. I mean, that's the thing. We don't know. We have two guys conflicting styles. We know how strong and explosive he is. And it's not just long lever top row. Look at that seated curl he was doing. 80 kilograms or something. I mean, he's strong. He was 20 reps, right? 20 reps he did, right?
Michael Todd: I don't even know how many it was. I quit watching. I don't want to see all that shit. But yeah, he's strong everywhere. I know what I have to do and he knows what he has to do. Who we're supposed to win is going to win. I think I can stop him. Honestly, I think he's got way better leverage than me, but I think I'm just as fast as him.
Engin Terzi: I really think I'm just as fast as him. I just don't have the hand and leverage and strength to go sideways the way he does outside, you know? But I think I'm just as fast as him. So, we'll see. Your speed is to position your own positioning, you know, while he wants to go pimped. So, my opinion, he will go this way, my opinion for sure, but we don't know how far. Do you agree with that, Michael?
Engin Terzi: Well, I would love for it to just stop right in the middle of the table. Not that easy.
Michael Todd: Oh, no, that's not gonna be easy at all. But yeah, so anywhere, I'm gonna be honest, if I can stop anywhere before hitting the pad, I like my chances. I like my chances a lot. Because that offensive aggressive style kind of leads itself to what I'm trying to do. You know what I mean? There's not as much time to recover if the match stops, you know, like, there's not much time to do the things that are necessary to beat me.
Engin Terzi: If he's just too strong, then there's nothing I can do, you know? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So I have a question for you again, Michael. When you and Ermes pulled, like, you were okay about the center. Is that because it was also, how to say,
Engin Terzi: His goal, Ermes' goal, his plan was also to control and rise and go high. So do you think that it was because you didn't let him or because he also didn't try? And I saw the same thing with Gennady match, you know, the round one, you were the one that, you know, just like took the center, you know.
Michael Todd: I would say it's probably a combination. I don't know. If he would have went sideways, I think I would have had a better match. I think the match would have been better for me. Maybe he didn't try to go that way, so it looked better for me. But had he went that way, maybe I let him, maybe he didn't try.
Michael Todd: The difference with Vitaly is he's so, I don't know, I've never gripped him. We get pictures every time we see each other, right? We always get pictures together, but I've never sat down with his hands. I don't know what his hand feels like. I think you will not like it. You will not like it. He's like, I won't like it.
Engin Terzi: And the question to Vitaly, Ermes didn't try to flash pin Michael. He rather stayed at the center and he wanted to play the hype game. Does Vitaly think that there is a danger of losing his wrist for a flash pin? Does he think that
Ivan Matyushenko: Or does he have a plan B? If he cannot flash pin, Michael, does he have a plan B to have a control match and position and then try to win? Engin asks, now on the example of Ermes, that Ermes did not try to win in touch. Michael fought for the position, for himself, control of the wrist, climbed higher. And, accordingly, the question is for you.
Ivan Matyushenko: Devon't you think that if you go to the side right away, you can lose your wrist? And, accordingly, if suddenly you can't win in touch right away, do you have a plan B to go into positional wrestling? To fight positionally, not in a hurry. I also fought with Ermes, and he also didn't try to win me in touch. That is, Ermes has such a style of wrestling.
Vitaly Laletin: I don't think he was afraid to lose his wrist. I think he just can't do it. And that's why it happened. And when I start, I control my hand. If I can't break it, I always return to the starting position and continue to do something else. Vitaly thinks that it's Ermes' child. He doesn't usually flash pin.
Ivan Matyushenko: It's important for him to control his wrist. And Vitaly can hit. And if he loses his wrist, he can get back to starting position and try something new. Okay, so if he loses, he will come back and restore. Yeah, okay, I understand. I understand. I understand, yeah.
Engin Terzi: will see we as michael said that we all know like what michael can do what vitale can do the only thing we don't know how strong they are at that moment at this moment you know and what is the size of pads uh
Engin Terzi: So they are unified now? Yes, yes, yes, yes. Because we are in the common rankings, like to change it there and there is just like, I mean, didn't didn't really make sense.
Michael Todd: yeah yeah so on that note i haven't been watching the videos my apologies is it best of five yeah yeah okay so it's the first one to win three okay yes yes yes yeah i didn't know that the king and table rules were changed for the reality we talked last time we we had them i forgot yeah i thought you'd said something but i wasn't sure and then people were saying four rounds you know how people comment so i didn't know no no yeah it just yeah the same same as before i have another question for vitale vitale like
Ivan Matyushenko: Do you believe that when you gain weight, does it affect your grip, hand strength as well, or only the bigger muscle groups? What do you think, Vitaly, with the growth of the mass, does the strength of the fingers, the strength of the wrist increase, or does the strength of the big muscle groups increase?
Vitaly Laletin: It increases in large muscle groups. The strength of the fingers does not increase, as I threw it a little. In any case, now I squeeze under 160 kg. The strength of the fingers remained, but the work of the big muscles is greater. I will answer that you just don't know, because you don't focus on the fingers now.
Ivan Matyushenko: uh so he doesn't know actually because he didn't concentrate on fingers on grip strength but he concentrated on big muscles so for sure big muscles became bigger and stronger about his grip strength is about the same according to results yeah yeah this is what i'm saying that like for me when i gain weight it doesn't really so much help to do the hand strength but but of course the shoulder bicep you know
Engin Terzi: anyway so there is a super chat travis baginashvili i miss ray at the last seven will he be in any future events i really enjoy his commentary interviews and behind the scenes anything is possible anything is possible um so let me ask him again like compared to uh his 2019 levan match
Vitaly Laletin: How much did he improve, Vitaly? How much better are you now, in general, compared to 2019, when you fought with Levan? Much better. If, for example, I lifted on the biceps, for example, I think 62-63 kg, then now my last measurements you gave me were 78 kg. This is on the shoulder blade, right? That is, on the hammer bend.
Ivan Matyushenko: And if I do 90 kg on biceps, I do 130 kg sitting. Vitaliy, do you remember my measurements? You know, isometry, back pressure. In 2019, you did 57 kg. What am I doing?
Ivan Matyushenko: So he did about 57 kilograms for back compression. Now it is 78.
Ivan Matyushenko: And bicep strength is about the same, so many percents. Yeah, probably more than 25%, 30%. From 56, from 57 kg to 68 kg. 57 to 68? To 78. Oh, 78. So 2021, so it is probably almost 40%.
Engin Terzi: Yes, so about 40% in some exercise. Yeah, some exercise, yeah. Not probably the hand. And his wrist, he had 89, and now about 100. Okay, so it's about 89, so maybe 12%, 13%. 12%, yeah.
Engin Terzi: Yeah. Michael, if you and Vitaly go back pressure to back pressure with the riser, do you see your riser, you know, being as good as his or better? Or how do you see? Is that one of your... No, no, seriously, it is one of the key points. If he cannot flash pin you, then he will go and you know that you guys are going to play the height game. And I know that he has leverage, but just because you have the leverage, it doesn't mean that you will always...
Michael Todd: win that high game, you know? I sure hope so. I hope I'm strong. I don't know, man. I haven't followed his lifts, so I don't know what he's doing and how each lift translates. I just believe if I can get the stop
Michael Todd: I will feel different in that moment, and I will fight as hard as I can to win. So whether that means I'll walk with him, I'll climb with him, I'll put as much riser as I can. Who knows? Maybe it's pronation through dragging back pressure that stops him. I don't know. I mean, I know my riser is stronger now than it's ever been. So hopefully it's strong enough.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, there are some people I many times explained to them, but guys, in Arlington event, they had the microphone, the microphone, just there was a technical issue that that didn't really work. So there was not that there was a microphone, that there was microphone.
Michael Todd: Vitaly, have you finished your heavy training or do you have more?
Vitaly Laletin: Last Friday he had a final heavy workout with Artyom Morozov.
Ivan Matyushenko: Does he talk about the training at the table or he talks about the weights? So first they worked with weights and after that pulling.
Engin Terzi: And Sam Splenko says, Ivan translating for Vitaly, both legends. Yeah, we have three legends right now at this podcast. Yeah, let's see how it will be. Is there anything you guys would like to ask each other?
Engin Terzi: I want to ask you something real quick. You said something like, I get there Tuesday. When does Vitaly get there? Vitaly, when are you arriving? I think he was going to arrive on Tuesday, and then somehow he bought the ticket for Wednesday very early morning, right? Ivan? Vitaly, when are you arriving? What time? I'm arriving at 7 in the morning. You'll be there at 7 in the morning.
Engin Terzi: on wednesday morning so he will be on 7th may early morning in istanbul gotcha oh wednesday morning very early yeah yeah so were we still planning on doing some stuff together like you know you're saying that we might go out yeah yeah yeah wednesday we can do it yeah tuesday we can do it just alone but wednesday you guys can yeah together it would be great yeah good deal yeah
Michael Todd: No, man, it's an honor to pull Vitaly. I have great respect. I know he's going to be really strong.
Michael Todd: I'm going to bring the very best version of me that I can bring on that day. So let the best man win. That's, you know, that's all I got. Like I said, this will be the first time that I actually probably on the day have a little, like, aggression. Like, because I'm always trying to, you know, I respect my opponents, like my opponents. And I like, like I said, I like Vitaly a lot. So we're going to be really good friends right up until they say go. And then as soon as the last match is over, then we'll be friends again. But that little time frame there, things might get a little crazy, you know.
Ivan Matyushenko: Maybe you tell him. Yeah, leave it up to him. Michael once again said that he respects himself. He's very happy to fight. He's happy that he's in his best shape for this fight. He says that he treats himself very well. But it's all going to be before the Ready-Go. And from the first Ready-Go to the last
Ivan Matyushenko: So, Vitaly also has great respect to Michael and he likes
Engin Terzi: the idea of friends before the first group and to give back friends after the final round yeah yes yes house way he says engine are there sign merge 47 as far as i know yes um
Engin Terzi: Engin, when are you having a rematch with Mindaugas? Once. I mean, they don't complain that I may be 85 kilos, because that's probably all I can lose from 92 kg. Yeah. And Vitaly, do you have any questions, any message for Michael?
Ivan Matyushenko: That's a good question, I think. When was it last time Michael was flash pinned without straps? Yes, without straps. When was he last pinned without straps?
Engin Terzi: And with straps, yes, flash pinned. When was it? 10 years, 15 years, with whom? In a fresh match or the later rounds? Because in a flash match and later round, maybe different. But fresh match, probably Pushkar. Not outside the straps. Not outside the straps, yeah. Since he said outside the straps, I'm honestly trying to think who flash pinned me outside the straps.
Engin Terzi: no one without strips i don't think so honestly i don't think can you think engen jerry w-i-l straps that were straps yeah we'd already slept yeah yeah but listen also also it also matters you know like it would if it is later rounds i still really don't count because it is like
Engin Terzi: Like both guys exhausted and things like that. But in a fresh round, if you think, I don't know. Well, who did it later rounds without the strap? I don't know. But I'm just saying that, like, to me, it matters if it is early rounds. No, I get it. I honestly got it. So this is weird because I didn't even think about that.
Engin Terzi: I was thinking, you know, I was going to get the slip and then I was going to have to stop him in the strap, right? Okay, can you tell Vitaly, can you ask Vitaly that does Vitaly imply that Michael will have a positive answer for this question if the question is asked after this match?
Ivan Matyushenko: I definitely think he's implying that he plans on flashing me outside his traps. I think that's pretty obvious, you know. Let's hear from him, you know. More fun. Yes, that's true. I saw that one.
Michael Todd: And what about Pushkar? Pushkar got me in the straps. In the straps? Yeah, we had slipped out. So he flashed me in the 2016 Zloty tour. I showed up and I had a torn lat and a torn pec, so my whole torso was black and blue, and I got to pull him first round, right? Slipped, strap, boom.
Michael Todd: but he got the parallel pin. And then he got the first two pins of our Supermatch in 2017.
Michael Todd: So now on that same day, or the very next day, we saw, or maybe it was that day, we saw Vitaly come in, miss the 231-pound division, and pull supers left and flash push car the first round left hand outside the strap. Do you remember that, Ivan? Yeah, I think. Dude, he showed up and missed the weight. He didn't miss the weight. He didn't get to weigh in. So he had to enter the supers. At 231 pounds, he flashed push car round one. That shit was crazy.
Ivan Matyushenko: In my opinion, Michael said that on the right, it was on Nemirov, where you also participated, and you also passed Pushkary on your left hand, with a small weight of your own. It was in 2017. In 2017, right? On the left hand, just without weight. When I came to the competition, I recognized my weight category. I weighed 100 kg, and I was in the top, and in the first fight Pushkary passed.
Ivan Matyushenko: Yes, that was Vitaly in 2017. He was late for his weight class and with his own weight of 100, he went to Supers and in the first round, in the first match, yes, he first pinned. Yeah, there is a Superjet engine. Who Vitaly thinks stronger, Levan or Michael? Who is stronger, Michael or Levan, what do you think?
Engin Terzi: When I fight them, I'll check them both, then I'll tell you. Vitaly needs to pull both of them now. Okay, but he knows that this is a super chair, right? I didn't ask that question. Okay. Sam Siplenko says, Dennis flash pinned Master Michael Todd in 2016. Did he flash pin you? Yes, that was it. I went for a flop press, and he went straight sideways. What was it? Oh, okay, without the strap.
Michael Todd: Yeah, without the strap. That's what it was. It was 2016. I went to flop. You made a mistake to go in like that? Of course. So I telegraphed it, and I saw him trying to block it, and I thought I'd be fast enough, and he just... I was like, son of a bitch. That didn't work. Because I should have won that supermatch that day. I made some mistakes. That was my supermatch. I fucked that up. But yeah, that was it. 2016. Yeah, yeah.
Ivan Matyushenko: It might have been round four, though. I think it might have been round four. So, Vitaly is going to ask Denis how he did that.
Engin Terzi: But Michael, you did not try to sleep like this way. And I have a question for you, Michael. Do you think that it's a better idea to sleep from, we tell you, to this way than this way? Not for me. Not for you? OK. Because whenever you pull to his fingers, you are pulling to his grip. But whenever you slide like this, he doesn't have the press that Dennis has.
Michael Todd: No, so the thing is, the way I intend on slipping will be through his bottom fingers. You know what I mean? So it's just different. I don't know. I don't think I can slip this way because I don't have the mobility in my wrist. I don't think I can slip that. I think I would try this way and he would hold on to me and smash me. So not trying that. So now we understand why Dennis beat you.
Michael Todd: Maybe so. Maybe I just, I mean, I knew that he was protecting it and I knew he was going to try to block it, but I thought I'd be fast enough. Was that the Supermatch 4-2? Ended 4-2? Yeah, it was 3-2 and I fouled out round six. I'm telling you, he was not going to pin me round six. And I still don't think that was a foul. But yes, I lost 4-2. Oh, good. Vitaly, did you want to say something while it's over?
Ivan Matyushenko: Vitaly, did you want to say something? Mask Michael how much grip strength he has. In what exercise? How do you do it? Vitaly is interested in your grip strength, Michael. I think he means his
Engin Terzi: The way he does it. Pitiful. Pitiful. Well below average. Well below average. And trust me, it doesn't really mean a lot. You two have not a good grip, you know, squeezing power. I mean, this is not a big loss, you know. Like we saw when Devon tried, like when Brian Shaw asked him,
Michael Todd: Yeah, but whenever you try to topple the guy, his hand, wrist is different. So do you really believe... What I believe to be true on that is it doesn't make or break an arm wrestler how much you can squeeze, but it's definitely an addition if you have a strong... I mean, if you have Vitaly's hand, it definitely is an advantage. But it's not... It doesn't necessarily mean I suck at arm wrestling because I can't squeeze a whole lot. You know what I mean? But if you have... What I say, would I rather be able to squeeze a lot or not squeeze a lot? I'd rather be able to squeeze a lot, but...
Engin Terzi: i can't so yeah but michael michael you know how you squeeze if whenever you're squeezing without pressing your palm like this then that is good but if you are squeezing and then you need to sacrifice your wrist to make your palm like this i don't think it's good for arm messing yeah like your your gripping power should not be having any negative effects on your your
Engin Terzi: wrist you know a lot of people squeeze this but they they just make i've said i've said that my whole life you know my brothers don't want the knuckles back when you squeeze a hard gripper everyone who does yeah they're not going to go back i train i train like this i never i never i never do uh such what you know i make sure that my wrist is not affected from my grip you know right right yeah
Ivan Matyushenko: Michael says that his grip is lower than average. Engin thinks that such grip strength is not very useful for armwrestling. This is a good addition, but there is no direct transfer. I could add my own remark here. It seems to me that it is good to have such grip strength against those who run away. Michael will run away.
Ivan Matyushenko: i want to say that this kind of strength is important against those people who want to sleep yeah and michael maybe he will
Engin Terzi: Oh, Vitaly is going to make Michael realize that? Because, listen, these things are coming after one another. First question was, hey, Michael, who pinned you without the strap last time? That was one. Now he says that Michael is going to realize this. Now this is another thing. So it looks like Vitaly is not shy about his game plan. He is just like Michael, I mean...
Engin Terzi: I don't think he could be more clear than this. Do you agree? He's pretty clear. He's pretty clear. Yeah, we will see. And I have a question. Vitaly, do you think that whenever the guy is trying to sleep and you hold on and press, press, press, do you think that it is also exhausting the hand? Just remember round three when Levan and Ermes pulled, first two rounds they sleep and
Engin Terzi: Levan won comfortably. And then round three, Levan just tried not to let Ermes go. He held on, you understand? He held on, held on. And then that is the round that, like, he got in trouble, Levan. Does he think that, like, he gets a bit exhausted while trying to, like, if that
Ivan Matyushenko: Not allowing to go to a strap type of attempt, if it is long, 20 seconds, does it also exhaust the hand and wrist? He asks if the wrist gets tired when you don't let the opponent to break down. And this happens for a long period.
Vitaly Laletin: Did you have such a situation? If someone breaks down, you hold him with your fingers. Does your hand get stuck at the same time? No. At this moment, the opponent has more strength to resist in order to break out. And at the same time, I hold the hand straight and press with my fingers. And the opponent starts to run away, his hand is already lost, and then it starts to work badly in the future.
Ivan Matyushenko: mm-hmm so italy thinks that is a disadvantage mainly for the opponent for his opponent he doesn't feel that he loses that he becomes tight but he thinks that his opponent
Ivan Matyushenko: Decreases the capacity of strength capacity. Does he think that he walked that way against Ermes? As an example, Engin brought Ermes with Levan. When Levan tried to hold him, everything went wrong. Levan, apparently, got tired. Accordingly...
Vitaly Laletin: It's very hard for him to fight. First of all, I know that when I gain weight, I have problems with my breathing. Even now, for example, if I take some moments, my breathing is faster than my muscles. I think it's all because I don't have control over my breathing.
Ivan Matyushenko: He thinks that it's a different situation and Levan had more problems with overall endurance. No, I'm talking about Vitaly vs. Ermes match. He also tried to do that against Ermes, but he ended up getting exhausted.
Vitaly Laletin: In your fight with Ermes. In my fight, in general, I scored a little more than Ermes. It seems that in the middle I pressed him, but my wrist was not enough, his endurance was not enough. That's what I'm working on now. Apparently, Ender wanted to link it with the theory, who scores more when one tries to break away. There was such a thing that Ermes ... Let's take the fight with Morozov, probably when the score was
Vitaly Laletin: There are different factors in his match against Ermes.
Ivan Matyushenko: Vitaly really had problems with his wrist endurance and side pressure endurance, I think. But I think he doesn't think that it's because of stopping Ermes from going to strap, yes.
Engin Terzi: And Yash Hasve. Question for Vitaly. Arsen there any key strategies how to use that big of frame to your advantage for beginner? I am 6'7 but struggle a lot. He is asking Vitaly how to use his big frame, you know, as an advantage during arm wrestling. He is asking for advice. Question for Vitaly. How to use the dimensions?
Vitaly Laletin: This is a question from a fan in the comments. How do you use the large dimensions? Yes, the dimensions are not always good. In any case, those who have shorter levers, they manage to make more weight than I do due to the fact that the length of the lever is longer. It's harder for me to do the same biceps, or roll in a similar angle.
Vitaly Laletin: We tell you things that most important is strength. Strength, anyway. Strength, yeah. Yeah. I agree. Anyway, so we are...
Engin Terzi: 55 minutes into this podcast. And Michael, I don't want to keep you so long. Any words? We are, I think you are arriving, what?
Engin Terzi: how many days 11 11 days right yeah today is friday 9 11 days yeah 11 days do you have any message we are there like only 15 days this is in my opinion one of the historical matches like very important matches michael todd and vitality if they would end their career without pulling each other it would be a shame and now you're gonna pull against this giant michael do you have any messages for your opponent
Michael Todd: No, man, just safe travels to you and Yvonne both. Good luck in your match, Yvonne. I'm just excited to hang out with my friends again and have some fun times arm wrestling. I really think that this is going to be a special event. I really do. And I'm excited to be a part of it. So it's, like you said, it's a very, very, very important match because of the implications of what is in store for the winner, right? Yeah.
Michael Todd: I'm trained as hard as I possibly could, so this is it. Yeah, this is also a match that had to happen, you know. Oh, I mean, I agree. And honestly, if I don't think I would have gotten back to this form that I believe I'm in now, or I don't think the match would have necessarily needed to happen because his form is so high. No, I'm not talking about like today's form or something, but whenever you think about Michael Jordan, Vitaly Laletin,
Engin Terzi: Like stylistically and like... Oh, throughout the years? Yeah, it could have been a great match. I think we are in a time right now where we're going to get to see the best version of this match, you know? So I'm excited about it. One more question for you, Michael. I'm not going to go into details, but mentally, are you in a better state than you were in Tbilisi? I think you are.
Engin Terzi: not even close to be in the same place i'm in a much better place yes yes i i can see that i can see that i know the reasons as well you didn't want to talk about it but but just i can see you much more relaxed you know like yeah i mean like you know stuff in life's gonna happen there's gonna be things that happen to you that that affect you and in that particular instance it was something that i let really really really affect me yeah and i'm not saying it had any big
Michael Todd: on the outcome of the match. But I just know that outside interference, outside things, I'm not going to let deter the version of me that I'm bringing to this match. I'm going to be in here with the right headspace, physically unprepared, mentally unprepared. And like I said, I look forward to hanging out with everyone as much as I do arm wrestling. So I'm excited about the event.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, this is also the reason I ask you because I see that. You said you come in to hang out with the great arm masters from all over the world and that means that you are enjoying right now. You are not too hard on yourself. There were some points that you were
Michael Todd: I don't know if you agree or not, but you were too hard on yourself. Oh, 100%. I felt like the need to win was all or nothing. I had to win. Now, yes, I want to win as much or more than I've ever wanted to win a match in my life.
Michael Todd: But I know for a fact that I've done everything I possibly could. Everything that I programmed. So I have one more day. Today's my last day. And all the things I have programmed to do, I'm going to finish off today. And I believe it'll be successful in everything. So the prep that I felt like I needed to achieve, I've achieved, right? So if I show up and it wasn't enough, there was nothing else I could have done. You will just go back and then...
Engin Terzi: This is the best I can possibly bring. That is the credit we need to give to EVW that all these great athletes, they constantly get their chances to pull again and again. There has been times that people just too harshly criticize you, but as you also know that we always
Engin Terzi: were by you and supported you. And we will continue supporting you, Michael. Well, I appreciate that. It's funny because I'll see a few comments now and then I'm like, oh, all he does is lose. I'm like, dude, I didn't lose a match last year. Yes, and you beat Frank Lamparelli, you beat Lars, and you beat Kamil, and then you beat Gennady. So you won four matches in a row. And then
Engin Terzi: And a lot of people, did you know that Ermes on his podcast, he said that it was that close, you and him. And whenever I say this, people say, well, Engin, you don't know what you are talking. It wasn't close. Like, I don't know, like John Bersink personally told me, Engin, you are the most knowledgeable person in Ermes. He told me.
Michael Todd: mean i see it you know like well even in your conversation with john john's like that could have went either way he run that back next month you know maybe maybe john doesn't know either you know maybe he's not but he exactly exactly but hey it's all good man um there's a winner and there's a loser every time right yeah yeah yeah that doesn't mean anything it just means on that day that guy was better you know yeah so and he doesn't take anything anyway
Engin Terzi: anything from you or from vitaly the result i mean it doesn't take anything you guys both have done a lot and we tell you sorry about it do you have any last words for your opponent in less than um two weeks we will see you in istanbul any any words any any message for your fans or your uh opponent
Vitaly Laletin: Vitaly, one last word for the fans, for the opponent, for Michael. Two weeks before your fight. Thank you for doing all this. I advise Michael to stop carrying heavy weights, because the armfight is coming soon. I want it to happen, so that there is no such thing as losing athletes, getting injured and not coming. I want him to come.
Ivan Matyushenko: I wish him happiness, health, love and good luck. Vitaly, as usual, says thank you to Engin for the opportunity to have this match. Thanks to Michael. He wants Michael to train hard, to be safe and in his best form in two weeks.
Engin Terzi: And also he wishes all the best to Michael. That's great, that's great. Yeah, there's not much to add to this. And on May 10th we will see two giants will collide and we will see the outcome.
Ivan Matyushenko: Thank you very, very much, Ivan, for translation, my friend. And I hope your preparation is going well. You finished already? You started resting? I have some easy workouts still. Easy workouts, yeah. Easy, medium workouts, right. Yeah, so are you satisfied with your preparation? Quite satisfied. There was no time I was satisfied.
Engin Terzi: There was no time, I think. I was fully satisfied. Every time I wanted more and more. I think most of us... Yeah, yeah, there will never be a perfect... Especially when you are not young, you are older, you will always have some problems, but most important thing is that in the conditions we are, we do our best, you know, as much as possible. Thank you once again, Ivan.
Engin Terzi: Thank you. Vitaly, thank you very, very much. Spasibo, my friend. Yeah, thank you. And Michael, thank you very, very much. Yeah. Take care, guys. I appreciate everything. I look forward to seeing everybody once again. Safe travels. And we will see you guys soon. See you. See you, Michael. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
