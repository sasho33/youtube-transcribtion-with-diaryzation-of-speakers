Engin Terzi: Let's start now. We are live. Hello, hello, everyone. And hello, Ivan, Ivan Portela, my friend. How are you? Good? Como estas? Bien, bien. And you? Muy bien. And hello, hello, Joseph. How are you, my friend? I'm good. How are you?
Engin Terzi: Good, good, good, good. A nice day. I just wanted to do outside, balcony, because nice weather. And how are you, my friend? You will help us today to translate? As much as I can, sir. Yes. Glad to be here. Yeah, yeah. You have your own podcast as well. And yeah, let's start. So let's start with Joseph. Joseph, like till your match,
Engin Terzi: uh against kevin palco i i didn't know about you i didn't know about you and you had a lot of people and i i knew about kevin and i because i know kevin and how successful he is so i didn't think someone that i have never heard of would just come and beat him i mean i didn't think that way but but it just happened and then
Engin Terzi: The rising star, Cody Woods, and he was your next opponent at the East versus 17. And again, like he was favorites. I think even you mentioned that he was favorites on the paper. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think we did the podcast and this is what you taught and, but you also beat him. The only, only thing that like, I would just, uh,
Engin Terzi: have how to say excuse about my opinion would be that like at the beginning very beginning I just know that you were the training partner of John Bersink. Can we say that you learn a lot from the guy while training?
Engin Terzi: yeah yeah i would say so yeah he he suggests you because whenever i've hit the match and then whenever i found out that he was like like you guys were training together and he told me that like sometimes like if he's not feeling so good or tired or something even he has hard time you know uh opinion yeah and yeah so that that was that was yeah and now like the things are changing you defeated kevin palco and you were
Engin Terzi: underdog against Cody Wood and you also defeated him and of course Cody Wood is also still young and also new for the sport and he will also have more opportunities hopefully in the future but right now you are in your third match and you are going to pull against Ivan Portela. Did you have a chance to
Joseph Meranto: see who he is? Like, did you, did you check who he is? I, unfortunately I did. Yeah. Yeah. I thought you were going to say unfortunately I didn't, but no, I, unfortunately I did. He's the Spanish goat. Um, I didn't know, I didn't know too much about him before this match. And I see, yeah. Even you told me Yvonne Portela and I, I went and I looked it up. Oh man. Yeah. He lives up to it.
Engin Terzi: I think 10-time world, 10-time European champion. Yeah. The only thing is that I don't think he won in his prime, but it doesn't change anything about what he has done and about that he is for sure a legend. He is not a legend in his country. He is a global one. This will be the hardest match of my life. Yeah, yeah. Hands down.
Engin Terzi: I don't know. I don't exactly know where Ivan is about his current form. The only thing is that you are going to pull against someone who is extremely experienced. Extremely. Compared to your first two opponents, this guy is another level about the experience. No disrespect to others, but he has been pulling for almost 30 years. He's been arm wrestling way longer than I've been alive.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, how old are you? I'm 23. 23, you're 23? Like, Ivan, how long have you been in the sport? 30 years? 31, 32, but nearly most close to 33 years in the sport, yes. Okay, okay. And yeah, so Ivan,
Translator: As we mentioned, do you want to translate very shortly, quickly, what Joseph and I talk? Could you repeat that, Engin? I couldn't hear you very well, sorry. Like, can you quickly translate to what we just talked? To sum up a little bit of what he said, this is his third fight, also against a great sport legend, which is you, a sport legend, a very well-known person internationally.
Translator: In addition, Engin asked Joseph if he knew who Ivan was or who he was, Ivan Portela, to which he replied that indeed, unfortunately, he looked on the internet who you are and he was very impressed, mentioning 10 times world champion, 10 times European champion, and that also, apart from being very surprised, Engin said how
Translator: Ok, where is your phone? Where are you now?
Ivan Portela: Right now, obviously, I am not as good as I used to be, obviously, but I am still training and I am not unprepared at all. He knows me and he has seen that whenever I go,
Translator: It's because I'm always there. You know me, Engin, and if I accept the match, it's clearly because you know that I'm always there. Yeah. Yeah. And like, does he know his opponents? Did he check? Did he watch the last events?
Ivan Portela: Do you know who you are facing, Iván? Do you know your opponent? Have you seen the last events? Yes, because if I remember correctly, as I follow and I am a friend of Emil, I seemed to see him in a vendetta. And I saw it by chance. And then when I saw that I was against him, it was typical. I entered the profiles to see who it was.
Translator: So, yeah, I saw him obviously pulling in a supermatch. He saved Endeta, actually. And obviously, after finding out that I was going to face him in a supermatch, that's when I really started to look into his social media profile and try to dive in, yeah. And what does he think about him?
Translator: so rather than only about him but in general talking about the younger generations they are all coming strong but he mean joseph is obviously very strong he looks like now is his moment but experience is a huge grade and that counts
Engin Terzi: And will it be enough, Ivan? Do you think it will be enough? We'll see that. We have to see that. And physically also you are in good shape, right? I mean, like maybe not prime, but still good shape.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, not in my prime, but yes, I'm feeling good. Oh, look at that forearm. Even when he was 55 kilos, he had huge, huge, huge forearm. And yeah. Yeah. And Ivan, your opponent is also a hook puller.
Engin Terzi: Do you think this is an advantage for you or disadvantage for you? You are a hook puller. Would you wish that your opponent was a top roller and you would just hook him and beat him, no problem? Or it would be bad for you if he top rolls you? Would you prefer your opponent to be a hook puller? I want a spoiler. I want a spoiler. I want a spoiler.
Translator: So, did you understand what I said, Wengen? Yes, but translate it so that it stays the same. Right. Portela understood what you said and he's like, do you want the spoilers? Like, do you want me to tell you what really I think about it? Like, you want the spoilers? I mean, yeah. You want the spoilers? Arsen you going to top roll him or something? Did you become top roller after 25 years? He's going to top roll me. A surprise. Bro, a surprise.
Ivan Portela: Surprise. Surprise. No, Ivan, no. Yeah, surprise. Look. No, keep moving. Really, keep moving.
Engin Terzi: oh no no no no it's called desperation if the shoulder is like this it's okay open arm double this yeah yeah foul yeah yeah yeah that that that is statue of liberty yeah but yeah yeah anyways so yvonne both of us we asked yeah just foul both of them at same time no winner anyway so guys
Translator: So, Ivan, you didn't really answer me. I said, is it good or bad that your opponent is the hook puller? Ford me, it's good. It's always going to be a good war.
Engin Terzi: Oh, I thought there was a surprise. I thought there was a surprise. Anyways, yeah. Anyways, so how about you, Joseph? Do you like feel yourself this time favorites? I wouldn't say favorite again. I mean, just from the
Joseph Meranto: what he's accomplished and what he's done. I knew if he took this match, he felt like he was ready. So no doubt in my mind, this will be the hardest match of my life. I've kind of got a little reputation of comebacks at the moment, you know, coming back to zero against Cody. Some people say I'm the favorite.
Joseph Meranto: You know, I feel like it's mostly guys in North America and America that are like, yeah, Joseph, if it's a, if it goes into a hook will be pretty good. But I, there's a huge Spanish fan base that is saying Yvonne is going to crush me. So, uh, listen, um, you don't, you don't win with what you accomplished in the past. You need to pay the price. Like you need to be as good as when you were winning.
Engin Terzi: those WAF wars. And what is your heaviest category that you want WAF? I'm talking about the seniors, not masters. Thank you.
Translator: Do you want me to translate it for you? Translate it for the people in Spanish. Enkin has asked Joseph how he is physically and if he is considered the favorite. There were a series of comments, very quickly, guys, that obviously he is not considered the favorite, but that he is going to go all out and that he is perfectly aware of everything that Iván has achieved in the past.
Translator: You did ask what was the heaviest bodyweight category he competed, right? No, no, he has won the, well, probably it is not more than 143, 65 kilos. I think either 60 or 65 kilos.
Translator: Can you ask him? I used to compete in 70 kilograms, senior. No, no, no, but when he won the WAF, what is the heaviest category that he won WAF? Senior, I think it's 60.
Translator: Senior, I think 70. When did he win 70 kilograms? No, no, I'm talking about the senior. No, senior didn't won in 70 kilograms. My friend, I'm not asking if he won 70 kilograms. What is the heaviest category that he won in senior category involved?
Translator: What is the category that you have won in senior, in WAF, in which you have more weight? The one that I have won in senior is 60, because then I retired seven years and returned to 2010, something like that. Probably in the 60 or 65.
Translator: even has said that um the heaviest he uh competed and won it was 70 kilograms in WAF and then he retired for several years but when did he win the 70 kilo ball 70 kilos in WAF is
Engin Terzi: No, I'm talking about senior. Senior. It shouldn't be this hard to find out. I mean, just as simple like me, I want 55, 60, 65, 70, 75. He's the heaviest. What's his senior category he wants? 65? Ivan, did you win it? I lost weight the moment I retired. So when I came back, it was another weight. Daniel. He cut himself a bit.
Ivan Portela: I say that when I retired I was in 60 and when I came back I had already gained weight. I was in 70 when you retired. No, in 60 and when I came back, I came back in 70. So I already did a couple of world championships that I think the fourth or something like that. I don't remember well. Because I was starting again and already after the accident.
Translator: so he was pulling in 70 kilograms as we say and then when he then when he got retired uh because of the accident and then he started to pull in master um
Translator: okay sorry for the confusion I apologize we had a little bit of misunderstanding there so he said uh seven to make it clear 70 70 kilos in master he won
Engin Terzi: I'm asking my friend, what is the heaviest category he won in Seniors? You are still telling me what category he won in Masters. I don't understand how hard it is. What is the heaviest category he won in Seniors? I'm asking. You're still telling me it's Masters. What is the heaviest category you won in Seniors?
Ivan Portela: 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 60
Engin Terzi: right he's not very sure right now that he doesn't remember very well he will have to look at it okay okay it's okay i just wanted to find out what it took like five minutes so let's continue so basically joseph like uh iwan's wins are mostly in like 55 and 60 kilo yeah which is 121 and 132.
Engin Terzi: maybe 143 but we somehow couldn't find out what it is but but not how tall is ivan ah ivan is probably 170 or how tall are you he wants 169 69 yeah around and you
Engin Terzi: I'm 5'7. I don't know what that is. 5'7 is about 170, almost, yeah. Okay. So you guys are almost the same height, yeah. Yeah, that's a first. What's your weight? Right now? Yeah. Oh, I'm...
Engin Terzi: little heavier i'm like 161 pounds at the moment under like 161 so you are about 73 kilos so you need to lose three kilos yeah yeah and then what's your weight you want you said you said like what's your weight now
Ivan Portela: 69, 68, 9. 69, 68. And then will he be 70 kilos when he comes to Chicago? ¿Vas a estar en 70 kilos cuando llegues a Chicago? Sí, con uno a este. Hay que darle a la creatina y va a comer.
Engin Terzi: what's that he said yeah yes and he's going to take as well creatine okay so let's let's uh ask let me ask uh maybe a few more you want if you would just talk with the percentage what's your chance of winning according to you what's that
Ivan Portela: so he said obviously as um
Engin Terzi: I didn't try him out. I don't know really what Meranto is and I am the kind of person that until I don't get into the table... Devon't know much about it. Okay. And Joseph, right now, Ivan is your third opponent in this league. And if you win this one,
Engin Terzi: Do you want to face someone like one of the current best of today, internationally? Or you think you still need time to step up to that level?
Joseph Meranto: Whatever you feel is best. Because even coming into this, I had no idea I was even at the level of Kevin or Cody. So I really surprised myself. I never faced those guys. So if everything goes well with Devon and it's decisive maybe, yeah, I would give it a shot. I'm not afraid of losing. It makes it better. But I would give it a shot, yeah. I wouldn't turn it down.
Engin Terzi: no no i know i know for sure but i i would like to be fair with you you are still fairly new uh for this uh level and but it doesn't mean that you can't be there there are some extraordinary people that without so much experience they can better themselves come and surprise everyone um and how about that that that you you are planning to become a policeman
Joseph Meranto: Is that correct? I am. Yes. Yeah. And in such case that you are hired, will you be away a little bit? Ford about, about five to six months, I'd have to be away. Yeah. Five to six months. It means that you won't be able to compete, but after that, you know, you will be away. After that arm wrestling will be the rest of my life. Yeah. That's good. That's good. It's great to hear that. Yeah. And I plan on coming back 10 times better than I am now. Okay.
Engin Terzi: I hope you won't be that good. We won't be able to find open defense ten times better. But when do you think that's going to happen? After this match? Hopefully. I'd like to get hired as soon as possible to get situated in a career and then be able to really focus on arm wrestling. So you are saying that maybe beginning of 2026 you will be back? Like to be ready? Yeah.
Engin Terzi: And I'll be in touch with you too, and I'll keep you updated with everything. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But let's see, let's see. Maybe the guy that's sitting right there will really make you think about it again after Chicago. Maybe. You never know. Yeah. And let's talk about the other matches, Ivan. Ivan, let's start with the match that we announced today. Do you know Elin Youngham?
Translator: Let's talk about the fights we announced today. Do you know... Can you repeat her name, Engin, please? Elin Janeheim. Elin... Thank you. Yeah, I think that's how we pronounce, but I may be wrong. But she's going to pull against Fia Isaac for the world title.
Engin Terzi: Do you know, from the fights that have been announced today, do you know Elin who is going to face Fia Ryzec for the title? I know Fia. I know Fia. Yeah, okay, so if you know Fia and you don't know the opponent, so probably you will not have a good, good prediction. And do you know this Atlas, Joseph?
Joseph Meranto: I know Fia, and I saw the other lady that you set up the match with today. I went on her Instagram. She looks incredible. So I hope it'll be a good match.
Engin Terzi: right yeah the the thing is that in 70 kilo the the title match before this one was also between two ladies from sweden malin and fia they pull in tbilisi and now again two ladies from sweden and sweden has a lot of strong yeah yeah strong pullers uh
Engin Terzi: especially in female categories. Okay, so let's go to some other matches. Ivan, Irakli, Zirakashvili versus Matt Mask with left arm. Irakli. Irakli. Irakli? Okay. And Joseph? Joseph, correct me if I'm wrong.
Engin Terzi: about these kind of predictions you were like you were telling me whatever you are thinking this is how i remember you or was it was it cody or you know i'm brutally i'm brutally honest with him i'm gonna say matt mask okay his left is insane
Engin Terzi: Yeah, but he puts himself underdog. I think either he's playing that game or we had a podcast and he said that he is underdog. But he said that his left arm is not as good as his right arm. But the same thing we can say about Irakli as well. Irakli, since 2019, he didn't pull any left arm match. Yeah. Yeah, okay. So let's go to another one.
Translator: Ivan, Georgii Desgarano versus Michael Todd. Michael is a warrior. I think it's going to be Georgii.
Translator: Oh, is it that Dzeranov is going to win? Dzeranov, do you think Dzeranov is going to win? Okay, in which way? Michael is my friend, I appreciate him a lot, but he's very strong. And I'm saying this even though Michael is my friend, but really Dzeranov is very strong. But which way do you see Dzeranov winning?
Translator: Is he going to top roll him? Is he going to side pressure hook? Deadlift pressure? How do you see? How do you think the fight is going to be? Is he going to take him by side pressure? Is he going to go up? How do you think the fight is going to be? With Michael? It's going to be a disaster fight. Because Michael Todd is an expert in that. So...
Translator: or wins over him, he's not going to have a problem. He sees... Or in a direct press that with the kill from the right side. One of the two. Right. Ivan said that this is going to be like a war, especially in endurance, or either Serrano press him or he goes on the top.
Engin Terzi: Either press or top roll? Either top roll or press or top roll. One of them. Ivan, did you see the matches between Michael and Ermes and Michael and Lalecin? Because both Ermes and Lalecin are very good top rollers,
Ivan Portela: They couldn't manage to beat Michael with the top roll. Have you seen, Ivan, Michael's fights with Ermes and the Latin? Because if you see the fights, Michael couldn't go up on top roll. That's why I say that if they attack Michael from above, they can attack him. That's why the same is true. If they attack him from above, then he can go. Because Michael doesn't go up.
Ivan Portela: in general. And it is that you have put on an ethyl arm, which is the arm of the longest there is. Getting up to these people is very complicated. He said that it is very difficult to get on top of Michael's. You mean above Michael's arm, right? Or the hand.
Ivan Portela: I understand that they couldn't get the height and that's why he lowered it. It's because how are you going to get the height? Okay, yes, but let's talk about Michael.
Translator: Yes, yes, yes. He said that it's very difficult to get on top of Michael there and it's going to be very difficult. So that's why. I just translated what you said and that's why, because it's very difficult to get on top of Michael, that's why you think it's going to be one of the two ways, or on top or press, right? Is that what you mean? No, regarding what he said about the fights with Ernest and...
Ivan Portela: and the team is that Michael did not get to them from above, they are two very long arms, he does not have an incredible back and the arm of the team is one of the longest as the height
Translator: So he mentioned that obviously Michael with Ermes and Vitaly, he struggled to go on top because they are very long arms. That was his mentioning. That was exactly what he said. Oh, so he said Ermes was struggling because Ermes is long arm? No, in the case of Ermes, it's more because of the pressure he has towards the back.
Joseph Meranto: In the case of Ermes. So in the case of Ermes is because of the back pressure, because the flexor fails and the height drops. Okay. And how do you see this? If Zhirinov wins, it's going to be in a dead or it's pressed. He's not top rolling Michael. I think Michael's got a fire lit under his butt right now. And this is in the US. I think Michael's going to win.
Engin Terzi: Okay, okay. And let's go to Wagner Bortalato versus Manuel Battaglia. Ivan, do you know Battaglia? From Italy, the world champion. I don't know how Bortalato is, but he's always been a tough guy. Battaglia is currently in his prime.
Translator: so um he said that bortolato is a very tough opponent uh he doesn't know how he is right now and batalia is looking very good but if he he does he press him the match is his
Engin Terzi: What if Manuel takes his risk? Can Wagner still press like this or not, according to him? Yeah, he said that yes, he thinks so, yes. So he thinks that even Manuel takes his risk, he will still press him like this? Okay.
Engin Terzi: Okay. And how do you see this match? Do you know Manuel? I don't. I know I don't. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I can't really comment on this one. Okay. I know Wagner, though. I know Wagner's an animal. Yeah. Yeah, he's strong. And he starts hitting the table. Wagner's winning. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He almost broke one of my tables, and I was kind of upset with him. And...
Engin Terzi: not because of the table but because of the like uh because the show had to continue yeah and yeah but we get along very well we keep in touch all the time but anyway so um ivan alex kurdecha devon art left arm
Ivan Portela: Devon. Cordelia, Devon, Devon. Devon. Okay, but just give us some detail. How do you see the match? Like, how is it? Devon is just going to hold him and beat him like this, or? Devon is a bit unpredictable. So, he would win, and when he sees that he wins, he will play with him at his strongest point of Cordelia.
Translator: So Devon is very unpredictable and he thinks that once Devon gets
Translator: that he is going to win, he will allow Kurdecha to go into his strongest and play with him because that's what Devon likes to do with his opponents, like demoralizing, humiliating. That's how he sees it. And he doesn't see any chance that Alex is winning? No?
Engin Terzi: Okay. And Joseph? I think Alex is going to blast through him the first two rounds. And I think after that, Devon's going to get that stop. I think he's going to take it. Have you seen Alex's match against Artem Morozov? Mm-hmm. In that match, unlike his right arm, with left arm, he can hook. He can side press. He can top roll. He can deadlifts press. I think in one of the rounds, I think he even beat Morozov with deadlifts.
Engin Terzi: Do you think in the case that Devon stops him halfway and Alex puts his shoulder behind, do you think there is also a risk for Devon to lose the round? Yeah, absolutely. I do. And I know Alex is ranked, I think, fourth in the world left hand. He's super high up there. Devon's working his way back up.
Joseph Meranto: It's hard to bet against Devon, you know, once he gets that stop and he is so smart and he's able to keep people outside of those lanes. I still think if Alex doesn't blast through him, it's going to be Devon. I kind of think that it is going to be a war. I think it's going to be a war too. Maybe early round Alex may win quick, but I don't know how the rest will go, but
Engin Terzi: Even if Devon wins, I think there will be some serious war there. This is what I think. Oh, yeah. And Ivan, Alex Kurdecha versus Artem Morozov, right arm. Kurdecha. Kurdecha.
Ivan Portela: Alex Furtensha. Alex Furtensha. And how does he see this match? ¿Y cómo ves este combate? ¿Se refiere a cómo crees que va a ser? ¿Cómo lo ves? Sí, sí. Es que es fuerza contra un flexor grande, alto y una buena mano.
Ivan Portela: Or it can be very fast because he catches Kurdecha in some way. Kurdecha because he thinks like he's dealing with a tall arm flexor. Moratov is the last one I've done with Devon, right?
Translator: Or am I wrong? No, Morozov, no. Who is he then? Is it the Ukrainian or the one with the blue clothes? The one who, let's say, shot the last fight against the Lety. Do you remember that he was injured? That shooter, I mean. Kurdecha against Morozov, with the right hand. With the right hand? I think it's Morozov.
Translator: Okay. Yeah, sorry. But he won't even was mixing names at the moment. So yeah, he changed and he said that Vasco Morozov. Yeah. Morozov. Yeah, not Morozov. It's Artur Morozov. Yeah, Morozov is different. Morozov is different. He's pulling against Morozov. And who is winning? Alex Kurdecha against Artur Morozov, which is this red hair that he threw against Daletin. Who wins, actually?
Engin Terzi: And how do you see this match, Joseph? I think Artem Morozov is going to win. In which way? He's going to hook him. Oh, he's going to hook him. Yeah, that is a very surprising thing. It's not that easy to hook Alex with right hand. I have seen him losing.
Engin Terzi: against some of the guys with dead wrists. I think Krasimir beat him, Ongar Bey beat him, and Jerry beat him with dead wrists. And Dave Chaffee, when outside move, he beat him. But hooking him with right arm, I think his left arm is stronger, but the right arm, I think he's better top roller. But you are thinking that Artem is going to hook him.
Joseph Meranto: I think so. I mean, their leverages are about the same. They're about the same size arm, but around the same height. Like in the case of Bobaev, that's just getting him in a proper hook would be damn near impossible with his lever size. But Morozov's got the height advantage on him, too. So I think, yeah, I think he's going to wind up sucking him into a hook. And Morozov has insane endurance as well. I mean...
Engin Terzi: I don't think it's going to be one-sided at all. I don't think really any of these matches are going to be one-sided. I think you got a card full of wars coming up. Yeah, yeah, yeah, a lot. One guy says that... One guy says that... One second. He says... Ivan retired after Joseph hooks him to the pad. Oh, my goodness.
Translator: Ivan, is it going to be a retirement match or is it a new beginning?
Translator: Is this, Iván, your retirement fight, or is it a new beginning? Well, I hadn't even thought about it, really. Wow, I didn't even thought about it. Which one? Retirement or the new beginning?
Engin Terzi: Which of the two? About the fight to retire or a new beginning? Neither. Neither of them. Neither of them. Okay, okay. Okay, so now you didn't think about it, but I reminded you. What's your answer? What do you think he will be? I'm trying to provoke him, Joseph, so just he can say something. I know you are. You're stirring the pot. Okay, so let's go.
Engin Terzi: Let's go. Pauline versus Arsen Kacetarian. Ivan, do you know Arsen Kacetarian? No, right? Okay. So I'm not going to ask you because when you know one opponent but not the other one, it is impossible to predict. Joseph, you saw him against Andrei Sharkovich. You were in the same event in Arlington. Were you impressed with the guy?
Joseph Meranto: Oh, yeah, he's incredible. I mean, especially he's like 21 or 22 years old, something like that. He's super young. But I think Paul Elin's a different level at the moment. So do you think he's going to sweep? Maybe. I mean, I know I said that, like, I think every match is going to be a war. This might be the only one that Paul Elin could sweep.
Joseph Meranto: he could but i i mean arson is very very impressive so i wouldn't be surprised either way but i think paul's gonna end up winning that inevitably paul's in really good shape yeah okay dino says in one and a half year joseph will be champion thank you dino and let's are vika
Engin Terzi: I don't know how to read that, but if Devon starts with good sides versus Kurdecha too, will he finally suspect foul play? And what if he gets it again versus Laletin Wright, my friend? I will be as...
Engin Terzi: informative as possible uh my friend we front of every athlete front of all the athletes we flip coin to the air and before we we flip it we ask athletes which side they choose and the both athletes agree on something just say head or tail and then we throw the money in the air
Engin Terzi: and the money falls down and it is filmed in front of all the athletes, not only these two athletes. And if athlete wins, wins. I can't, I don't know. I don't know. I can't do anything. Whenever he was pulling against Petrenko and they will choose one side. And then whenever I throw the money and they will kick the money in the air and
Engin Terzi: And then the side that he chose came. I canceled it because he kicked the money in the air, the coin. So I throw it again. And again, he won. So what can you do about that? You know, like his opponent is right in front of him. And like, do you understand?
Engin Terzi: So to make you happy, we can ask his opponent first which side he wants of the coin. And then the other side will automatically be Devon's and we throw it to the air. And then whatever comes, comes. You know, what can you do? If Devon wins, Devon wins. If Kurdecha wins, Kurdecha wins. There is nothing to suspect, you know.
Engin Terzi: Engin was commenting on the subject of throwing the coin into the air, Ivan, about the fight between Edebon and Kurdecha. Yeah, and also he lost against Gennady about the coin, but Gennady told him, oh, you start however you want. And in such case, you need to go and talk with Gennady, you know, because he's the one that is just one and he can be at whatever side he wants.
Joseph Meranto: Anyway, so, and then we have Alan Ford versus Ryan Ballinger. Arsen you familiar with this athlete, Joseph? Me? Yeah. I've watched a lot of Alan Ford growing up, whenever I first got into the sport. I know he's not one to be played with, and I've heard a lot about Ryan. I haven't seen Ryan pull personally, like live or anything, but I've heard he's super, super strong.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, he's worse. Yeah. If he hooks him, I think he has better chance. But there is a possibility Alan to go for a flash pin. We will find out. Yeah. And how do you feel? Alan's fast. Yeah, very fast. Yeah. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: His nickname is, I think, Hitman. Yeah, Hitman. Alan Hitman Ford. Yeah, yeah. And he's a very dangerous guy. Very dangerous guy. I mean, I have seen him giving very hard time to very top bowlers. You know, all his career wrong. Yeah. And so let's go to the main event. Ivan Portela. The legenda. Legenda.
Engin Terzi: How do you say it in Spanish? Legend. Leyenda. Leyenda, okay. So, Iván, who is winning there? Arsen we going to talk about the night fight? Levan Saginashvili or Ermes Gasparini? Let's see. Levan. But it is true that the only one who has made the topic complicated
Translator: So Levan, but nowadays the only person who has put in serious trouble Levan was Ermes. So still Levan, but Ermes is getting there.
Ivan Portela: So, do you think LeBron is going to win for sure? Do you think he's going to win for sure? I don't know about the first one. The first one, I don't think it's going to be that easy. The others, if we look at the last one, it wasn't easy at all.
Translator: i mean i mean it's tricky because i mean if we guide ourselves by the last match that they both had and saying that they will have been proven it's like the first the first one could be
Engin Terzi: like he said like could be like very difficult match round sorry uh and the rest we'll see so we're very tricky okay big grove goes says joseph how much training have you done with jumper zinc i've done quite a bit i've seen him in a lot of practices we pulled like did you guys do like 20 times till today
Joseph Meranto: yeah probably 15 to 20 times because he he also has like a little specific group that he's super far from me with um so he has like every other week i'd see him at eric wolf's place and he's also asking engen do you have any updates on how john's recovery is doing do you have any information about that joseph i don't no i i wish i did i i don't have information either
Engin Terzi: And El Zurdo Aymen says, Ivan is the Spanish-speaking god with the most titles in the world. And under all forecasts, he will fight to present his country, Spain, go Spain. Probably he says not present, but represent probably means. Yeah.
Translator: So, can you read the super chat for him, please? Sure. Engin has read a super chat from iMEN, Zurdo iMEN, saying that Iván is the greatest of all time and that he will continue to fight representing Spain, basically. Yeah. Yeah, okay, okay. And...
Engin Terzi: Is there anything you guys want to add to tell each other? I think this will be one of those super respectful competitions. Joseph is always respectful and Ivan is a legend.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, and I see the full respect. So that's good. That's good. We will see a great arm wrestling match. That is what most matters since we love arm wrestling. What's that? I hope there's no secret top rolling surprises. I hope he sets up just like me. I hope we go right into the hook and have a phenomenal fight.
Engin Terzi: So hook pullers are cheaters, right, Joseph? Top rollers are cheaters. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Top rollers are cheaters. I'm sorry. We should ban them, right? We should. We should. I think so. Straight inside. Yep. Ivan, your opponent says that he doesn't want any kind of surprise. And he wants the pure hook work.
Engin Terzi: so don't bring any surprise and we just decided that any top role will be called well so thank you basically
Translator: saying that if you have something to say to each other that he intuits that it will obviously be apart from being a great fight that it will be that what you are going to say to each other right now that it will be very respectful that he intuits that of the two of you Joseph has said that he does not want any unsuitable surprise with the topic of the top roll and he has said that the top rollers are cheaters basically that I would think a fault that I would think a fault
Translator: So yeah, if we go outside, it's going to be a foul. What's that? So in regards of no surprises, cheating surprises, we go in top role that is cheating. If we go outside, it's going to be foul. Okay, yeah. So we agree. Okay, that's good. And Joseph, your opinion about Levan versus Ermes?
Joseph Meranto: First, I want to ask, who do you want to win? I want Ermes to win. Is it because of some changes? Oh, yeah. It would stir the pot huge. I think it would stir the pot. I think Levan's going to win. But either Levan's going to sweep him or Ermes is going to win. But Levan's a heavy favorite, of course. Uh-huh, uh-huh.
Engin Terzi: But how heavy do you see him as a favorite? Do you expect, like, Ermes to win as well? Like, not more than Levan's chance, but do you, like, hope Ermes wins, that there is something that you are expecting or wishing? Yeah, I would like to see Ermes win. I mean, Ermes is such a character, and they're both in the best shapes of their life at the moment, I feel. I think Levan...
Joseph Meranto: LeBron's going to do what LeBron does to him. But if Ermes wins, I will be a happy boy. Yeah. I'll be shocked. Because then that would open up the rankings to everything. Because I personally think Devon beats Ermes. I think Ermes takes it.
Engin Terzi: If Ermes wins, I think Devon would beat Ermes. I think LeVon would beat Devon. I think it'd be this whole roller coaster. We never know. I know we never know. You never know, but I can tell you something. I won't go into details. Do you follow the drama? Did you see the video that Ermes shared? Yeah. Yeah. This is now...
Engin Terzi: probably the most personal super match that I have ever said as of now. I'm not going to share everything that is going on, you know, behind the scenes but
Engin Terzi: So fireworks are going to be going. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I mean, I wish I could share with the community, but that is right now very, very, very serious issue. Some people think that it is just a hype or drama, but those people, you will know, never call me and say, you know, whatever it happens, happens. You know, they will just, they don't want the World War III will start. They will say, no, no, no. That is just for like, you know, for...
Engin Terzi: news or something, you know. So you can convince those people they are a bit problematic. But this is very serious. And I think that from now on, we won't see any trash talk, at least from Levan's side. This is what I see. And Levan is coming there with different mindsets. It was already a bit personal, a bit personal because of
Engin Terzi: all the mockery you know people made you know about the oxygen and this and that and so that one was coming there just to prove that it will not happen again it was just one time thing but i think after after hermes's video and now the things are very serious and we will see we will see you will be there
Engin Terzi: Yeah, I hope the things cool down. I'm trying to cool it down, but we will see. Anyways, Ivan, my friend, Legenda, thank you very much for coming. And you're going to show this Joseph Meranto what his experience is. And he's going to remind you what it is to be young.
Engin Terzi: And then we will see. We will see if strength and youth will win or the experience will find a way to win. And my friend, thank you very much for translation. And at the beginning, we couldn't understand a little bit about the category thing, but I appreciate, I appreciate. Probably it was my fault that I couldn't explain good. I appreciate. Yeah, yeah, it's okay. Yeah, no problem, my friend. And yeah.
Joseph Meranto: Thank you very much. And Joseph, thank you very much. And Ivan, do you guys have any last message to each other or to the fans or anything? Yeah, Ivan, Trent, good. I can't wait to meet you. I'm excited for an amazing match and everyone supporting us. Thank you. Love you guys. Hope to see you there.
Translator: Obviously, Engin is closing the show, saying, well, Ivan, legend, thank you very much for being here. Let's see if the youth and strength of Joseph Meranto will be able to do something against the experience. He also made a comment that we didn't understand at the beginning with the issue of weightlifting and championships, but that's okay. And Joseph said,
Translator: I hope you're doing well, that you're training well, that he wants to see you, that we meet and that we have a real war. I say the same. Nice to meet you and we have a good dance.
Engin Terzi: same it's been a pleasure and see you soon okay one last super chat the guy just sent i think it's dirt miyagur excited for this match joseph's joseph is a great guy met him at the east versus west 17 vip dinner and got me into a club and started training see you in chicago bro we are rooting for you
Engin Terzi: Awesome. I'm happy you got that club. I'm looking forward to seeing you again, man. How do you, how do you pronounce his name? Say it again. How do you pronounce his name? Dirt or how the, that is like D I R T S. Yeah, that's, that's,
Engin Terzi: That's Dirk's. His name might be different on YouTube, what he's doing. Oh, okay, okay. So this may not be the real name. Okay, okay, okay. Thank you. Anyways, guys, once again, thank you very much. And just clash in Chicago. Ready, go. Let's get it. Right in the hook. Take care, guys. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thanks.
