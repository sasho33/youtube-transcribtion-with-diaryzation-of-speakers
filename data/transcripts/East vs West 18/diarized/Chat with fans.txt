Engin Terzi: Yeah, you guys are right, whoever is suggesting me to wear glasses, because I know that my eyes are not doing well, but I'm just so stubborn, you know? No, I didn't get old, no, my eyes see well, but then I'll go like this, you know? Okay. Okay, let me, I don't know what's wrong with me. And one second.
Engin Terzi: Let me read from here. Okay, this is better. Engin, what's up, brother? I can't imagine a world without East vs West, how plain it was before. Yep, and... I don't know if there's promo code. That's not my lane, but...
Engin Terzi: Yes, yes, yes. I think I need to come for the... I don't know what's wrong with my eye. It's burning. Can't wait. No, I won't be there, my friend. I'm in my home. And... Yes, yes, yes, guys. Okay, let me go to the most... I don't know. Hello, Michael.
Engin Terzi: Yeah. Hello, GB19. I just had a video chat together with Levan and Ermes. They were sitting by each other. And I just wished them the best. And I told Levan to break Ermes' arm and I told Ermes to kick Levan's ass, you know, so I never stopped stirring the pot. And...
Engin Terzi: I don't know if Levan is still injured, you know. Why I'm not in Chicago? Because I am in Yalova, my city.
Engin Terzi: My wrist size? No, my wrist in my prime was 43 centimeters, but warm. Today I train, after training it was 40, but it is slowly, seriously getting bigger, and my power is coming back as well. You will see soon.
Engin Terzi: Um, I think Alex, Alex, maybe I don't know if you guys ever followed, you know, the podcast that when I talk about Alex before this event, I mentioned that Alex burned the ships. It means that after having a few losses in a row, he can't afford another loss. So
Engin Terzi: He is in, like, lifetime shape, you know, like, best shape ever, for sure. Will it be enough? I don't know. But we have never, ever seen this ready Alex Kurdecha. But can he win or not? I don't know. No, I'm not going to hurt myself, Stone Gamer. Hello, Eric Lambert. Hello, Eric Lambert. Hello, Eric Lambert. Hello, Eric Lambert. Hello, Eric Lambert.
Engin Terzi: How did I recover from wrist injury? I didn't have so much wrist injury, but I had elbow injuries. 17 and a half is my age, Stone Gamer. No, no, no, no. 43 centimeters. When I say wrist, I meant the forearm, you know. The forearm is 43 centimeters, but not now in my best. Right now, probably cold, 37 and a half.
Engin Terzi: very warm, my arm really gain size, you know, when I train, you know. So, like,
Engin Terzi: up to two and a half even three something bigger you know and if it is arm wrestling uh if it be the weight lifting it is only like you train either your flexor or the brachioradial but whenever i arm wrestle at same time everything gets pumped so but now it's about like 37 half probably 37 and a half and but it's just getting bigger like every day
Engin Terzi: wake up says thank you for your super chat greetings engine if you were 6.65 yeah you're my height and then 300 pounds which super heavy weight would you love to face first so you would beat the crap out of him devon levan or hermes in which order and why
Engin Terzi: If I was that big and if I was in my prime, like with the size that, you know, when I was in prime, if I was that big, I mean, I would like to pull all of them, but why spend time with number two and number three? And yes, Alex, yeah. Denis Siplenko, yeah, we always have plans for Denis Siplenko, but Denis Siplenko is how to say...
Engin Terzi: Denis Siplenko is not training. Yeah. And any challenge to Denis Siplenko right now is just you are, I don't know, wasting your time. The guy needs to be healthy and then train. And then maybe whenever he is ready, he will for sure let me know.
Engin Terzi: I know, I know, you mean my last video. Yeah, I meant my age. Your wrist is 834. I don't know what that means, 834. Hello, hello, hello. Okay. And one second.
Engin Terzi: Anyways. Am I on... I'm not on TRT, but I am considering. Road to the £100 bench press. Engin, God bless you. Arsen you in Istanbul? Yes. Not Istanbul, but the south of Istanbul, Yalova. Teşekkür ederim, Recep kardeşim. Travis is going to announce. Yes, Travis is there. Ryan Bowen is there. Neil Pickup is there, yeah.
Engin Terzi: I don't know the new guy. I think that is Dexter. He brought his friend. I don't exactly know who he is, but yeah, the guy that is doing all those short welcoming videos. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, Oleg Cherkozov will compete once his suspension by the Russian doping committee ends. And Alain Zola, yeah, anytime he wants our door open, but I don't know. I think he is in military school and he cannot get out. At GB19, I didn't see the venue. And...
Engin Terzi: Yen, what did I mean by number 17 and a half? It's my age. But when I was 17 and a half. 43 centimeter? No, Binyamin. Selam, Binyamin. Binyamin, it was in, before I pulled Viorel Dobrin. Yeah, we have in Yalova Dental Center. Yeah, very nice one.
Engin Terzi: Greetings to Poland. Hello, Solo. Yes, yes, all is good. I think Levan is the same size, but leaner. Means that less fat, but the same muscle. My weight is right now 91 in the morning.
Engin Terzi: Okay, Michael B., your wrist is very thick, I think. My dream match, for me or for someone else? No, I'm not in Chicago. My friend, I really don't enjoy so much, and I'm very, very lazy to apply for American visa. I think it takes some time. You ask for...
Engin Terzi: And then when is Corey competing? I don't know. Yes, yes, yes. Levan versus Ermes probably is the greatest match, yeah. Thank you, Obelisk. Thank you. Good luck to you as well. When am I going to compete again? Jorge. I think, I think next autumn.
Engin Terzi: Yes, Paul Strang. Ryan Bornman so far is doing a great job. He has great interviews, yes. I had some serious issues with him, but it ended a year ago already.
Engin Terzi: and a year ago he apologized and we made peace and then nothing you know since then there is no you know negative feelings between us and and then and then yeah and then i i thought that you know the guy is really good not only about interviewing i think that he's the best commentator the way that he breaks down everything you know it talks really like he knows what he's talking about so i i just didn't involve anything you know
Engin Terzi: from the past, and then I think I made the right decision. People had been asking me, you know, like, why you don't invite Ryan? Why you don't invite Ryan? And, yeah. Um... Um, I don't think that if I pull Mindagos, it will be the main event at the East versus West. Engin, why you not present in event in Chicago? Um...
Engin Terzi: I don't know when is the war starting. I think today Trump said that he's going to decide in two weeks he's joining or not. And then Russia said that it's not a good idea. So better there would be a peace and hello energy talks. Good afternoon to South Texas.
Engin Terzi: GioMV. Engin, thanks for everything. Do you agree? I don't know when you would be of interest for future. Once we grow enough, then yes. But right now, I don't know. Antone, thank you for bringing East vs. West to my city. I will be there. Yeah. It is Robert Baxter. Ege bölgesi İzmir'e gitmiştim var. Ben de sizi seviyorum kardeşim.
Engin Terzi: Ermes look much smaller than Levan. They were closer from personal. I'm not sure if they were closer. There was about 60 kilo difference and now I think there is 45 kilo difference. Inshallah Denizcan. Is the Ermes Sling Club in Yalova? What is its name? I don't have a club.
Engin Terzi: No, no, it's not about the visa. Any moment, you know, just we apply, you know, I think we are going to get the visa. It's not about that, you know. Yeah. Did I buy the paper? No, but I will buy. I will buy usually like one hour before the event or something. I mean, I'm one of those lazy guys. I'm not in Chicago.
Engin Terzi: Which armwrestling match you dream to watch? Boxing breakdown, I don't really know, but... Any in your organisation have any restrictions? My friend, we need to start, but as of now... Um... No, I'm not there, my friend, Jakub. Mm...
Engin Terzi: I don't think Devon is bigger than Levan, but he has always been taller than Levan. Next, autumn, so one and a half year roughly. I thought that spring and then summer and then autumn, like fall, was the same thing. It is really nice that you made up, I agree. I don't know what you are talking about, Paul.
Engin Terzi: Yes, yes, yes, we have 200,000 subscribers. Yep, yes, Big Daddy Braga. Bob Guy, do you think Brian Shaw could take on any ranked pulls right now? I don't think he can do anything at all right now, and I'm not sure if he can ever, ever be top 10 ranked, you know.
Engin Terzi: my friend, arm wrestling is a different thing, you know. I think amongst all of them, I think Kirill Sarchev has good potential, but Kirill Sarchev, the other day he mentioned that he told me that he had a training with Alan Zolev, 80-kilo guy, and I'm not going to tell the details, but it is not that easy. We are talking about totally different...
Engin Terzi: Sport, discipline, trip, war. Thank you, brother. How are you? Good. I think Chicago event is almost sold out. Yalçın, thank you so much. If I have time, I can do it. Thank you.
Engin Terzi: You have to pay for the event. I thought as the organ... I mean, that would be... I mean, yeah, I mean, I can ask, you know, I can just tell them to send me the free code as well, you know, but it's not because I have to, but it is, I mean, I mean, I can just tell Robert, you know, just send me the free code, but it's not because I have to. If you want more videos from your prime and also training videos, anything, yakshamnaryasin,
Engin Terzi: Schoolboy versus Ricard. Yeah, it would be a good match, but let's see how Ricard do now. Do you plan to add Alain Zolev? Yes, yes. Ford sure. Arsen you going to invite Brian Shaw or is there a beef? No, no. Why would there be a beef? I only had positive conversations with Brian Shaw.
Engin Terzi: Um, I, I don't exactly know my friends about the hotel though. That is not my lane. My lane is mostly like, you know, matchmaking and the like rules and things like that, you know? Yeah. It would be good if I do like, yeah. Live reaction. Yeah. Joseph Meranto. Yeah. He will have a good match. Good match.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, the next autumn is the upcoming one, you know, like probably after summer. Engin, who do you think has the strongest riser? I don't know, my friend. Allen these guys that you say, like strong pronation, strong rise, you know, they all train different, you know. Engin, who is this new interview guy, Igor Soksic? I don't know, my friend. I think it's Dexter's friend.
Engin Terzi: Ryan Bowen is boring as fuck. I mean, Ryan would be considered boring only for people who don't really understand the sport, you know. Anyone who understands the sport would know that Ryan knows what he's talking about. His application is as good as his commentating? I don't think so. He's still a good armwrestler, but about commentating and interviewing, I think he is very, very good.
Engin Terzi: If Engin reply, I will buy 20 more PVP. You mean pay-per-view. My tone. Yes, I reply to you. You can give to the guys, you know. Hi, Engin. Can't wait. Yep. Good luck, good luck, good luck. İyi akşamlar, Raman. Kardeşim Abdurrahman.
Engin Terzi: The next event will be on the 2nd of August. I don't know, my friend, not yet.
Engin Terzi: Bro, is it a good match? Yeah, it's a good match. What's up, Enyi? We have been having a lot of fun. Skyler, Skyler, it's great to see you. Skyler, I will tell you something, my friend. You are one of the best fans out there. No doubt. You are very positive, you are very supportive, you are not toxic, you know. I respect you. Um...
Engin Terzi: Just stopping to say, hey, Ryan. Hello, my friend, Ryan Belanger. Yeah, I thank you guys, my friend. You guys are superstars. Yeah, good luck, good luck, good luck to you and good luck to your opponent, Alan Ford. Ryan Bone is not boring. Coach Ray is also good, but Ryan is not. Hello, Druid24. Great to see you, my friend. Yes, yes, Ryan is very good, yeah.
Engin Terzi: Yes, yes, yes, yeah. I mean, Ryan is not god of armwrestling as an armwrestler, but he's very, very good, you know, about analysing the sport, you know. I'm very happy. Um...
Engin Terzi: Levan felt Ryan's hand in the interview and said he's too strong for you. Yes, yes, for sure. Baseman, Bill Hurts. I don't know what level my English is.
Engin Terzi: Ermes really motivated, Daniel says, and very broad. You can see that he obviously wants to win. Yes, yes, yes. And right before the live, I talked with them. They were sitting together with the video chat. We just had a good time. We talked, and they were laughing. But at the table, everyone will go after...
Engin Terzi: His own dream, you know? So, at the table, there is no... no... How to say? No more, really, friendship or something. It will be, until the match is over, you will only see a war. Oh, Dennis Planko, I didn't go. I am not sure if Travis is gonna compete again.
Engin Terzi: Where do you think Prime Alex will go? I don't know, my friend. Devon, where he is? Martin says, Ermes wins.
Engin Terzi: It's a super chat. Thank you for your super chat. Ermes wins. He deserves it. He puts all of himself into this sport. And he is a humble and very nice person with respect as well as very strong and greedy. I can't wait to see the match. Let's go, Ermes. I will tell you something. Today I had a video chat with Ermes.
Engin Terzi: He says, Engin, I feel so good. I don't know, maybe it's illusion. I said, it's not illusion. Ermes, you are very, very, very, very strong. It's not illusion. But your opponent is also very, very, very strong. That's not illusion either. You both are right here, right now. And on Saturday, we will see
Engin Terzi: who is stronger. But just because one wins, it doesn't mean that other one is weak or something. No illusion. Ermes is in incredible shape and Levan is in incredible shape. So I told Ermes, I said, Ermes, I love you, brother, but I also love Levan as my brother. And I just wish you guys the good luck and let the stronger one win. You know, that's it, you know.
Engin Terzi: Maybe, maybe I will travel someday here. KB, KB, . You are a legend who says, this Spanish legend, but you always scared of making Levan angry. It's not scared. You don't know what you are saying. When I say, we joking about the scared, nobody's scared of anything, you know. You can ask Levan, but I respect Levan. I don't want him to misunderstand it.
Engin Terzi: I don't know about the chances of Ermes to win. Armwrestling is a human sport. Yes, it is. Engin, hello. Mila says hello. Engin, can you flex your forearm?
Engin Terzi: I don't know. It should be looking bigger than this. But usually after the training, it gets smaller or some, like maybe one day or something. But we will be big, you know, very soon. I promise you guys. Hello, hello to Russia.
