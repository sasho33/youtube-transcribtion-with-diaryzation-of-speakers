Engin Terzi: Hello, Alex. Hello, hello. How are you? Good, good. You? Yeah, I'm fine. Yeah. I like the new room with posters behind. Yeah, I will put a lot of a lot of more things there. I will put t shirts and like a lot of things. I'm just gonna make this room like a Is there gonna be a belt? Yeah, I can I can put one of the belts as well. Yeah. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: from a certain 85 kilo category maybe what's that from 85 in the belt to after I'm ah that's that's just that that that that is I don't know that's very hard thing to do yeah it's very hard thing to do
Engin Terzi: okay let's see let me share this and then vital is coming i don't know last time i felt you in istanbul you were stronger than previous time a bit better yeah yeah getting a bit better and better yeah yeah i i like that yeah i'm i'm happy that you are progressing because i know you love our message
Engin Terzi: And it's always better. Maybe you will not become a world champion. Maybe. I don't know. But still always to see improvement is probably encouraging, right? Yeah. I like that I get better while getting lighter.
Alex Kurdecha: yeah around 85 i think right now and that's but i think you were like about 90 kilo you were first time 91 90 i always floated around 90 and just for some reason last month or two i just started dropping weight for some reason i don't know i understand yeah so how about you as a georgian you probably you are probably impressed more with levan's
Engin Terzi: 180 kilos, then Ermes is 192 kilos. Yes, yes. When I saw that video, I was like, oh my god. Because still, Ermes' back pressure is insane, but it's 180 kilos. Yeah, yeah. Some people think that it's not specific, so I don't know.
Engin Terzi: it's impressive like more impressive i still like like like the way that he was screaming after this yeah yeah crazy yeah anyway so
Alex Kurdecha: let me share this as an arm wrestling specific exercise that 97 kilo back pressure it's it's insane but lavan's bicep curl i feel it's not even arm wrestling it's just so much strength yeah yeah yeah 180 kilo is just yeah incredible incredible i don't deadlift this much i cannot even get it off the ground and keep biceps curl this
Engin Terzi: You said that you cannot even do the deadlift? No, no, no, no, no. You would get hurt? I wouldn't even lift it off the ground. I wouldn't even get hurt. I just can't do it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. I think any minute, any minute, he will be joining us. Let's see. So much surprises in this event. Which one?
Alex Kurdecha: Ford me, I was surprised by Vitaly, really, a lot. Okay. It is because Vitaly won or the way that he won? The way that he won. Oh. I just, I would never think that he can have problems in the center, but then just to press him down, it was, I was surprised by that part. And he, it felt like he didn't even guess. Like he kept on getting better and better and better. Mm-hmm.
Alex Kurdecha: well we'll hear from him yeah yeah i'm gonna ask him i'm gonna ask him what he thought what he felt let's see let's see because i remember going on instagram and i saw the screenshot of how big of a difference Vitaly's hands like Gennady's here and Kamil and Vitaly's like so much higher he just doesn't let him climb at all
Engin Terzi: Hello, Vitaly. Hello, Vitaly. How are you? I'm doing good. Good? Yeah, that's good. So, how is the arm? Wrist? Everything is okay? How do you feel? How is your arm? Is everything okay? A little bit, but here my muscles hurt, forearms.
Alex Kurdecha: Yes, so the wrist is fine, elbow is fine, shoulder is fine, but like the forearm muscles, they're a bit sore because that position is so much stretching, so much stretching. So much stretch and long time is still.
Engin Terzi: So, probably that's why. Yeah. So, Vitaly, can you analyze the match for us? Like, what did you feel? How did you feel?
Vitaly Laletin: Just start from the beginning. At the beginning, the match was at the center, so how was it? Was it a surprise? I could at least get to the pillow, but Michael is very strong, and he didn't let me do it. When we stood in the middle with him, and when he started to push me into the attack, I realized that I was holding back.
Alex Kurdecha: When I went into the attack, I felt very comfortable. And when Michael pulled me out, I didn't feel any pressure at all. Yeah, off the goal, I was surprised by the center. But I felt that when he attacks me, I can hold that. And when I started attacking, I felt pretty comfortable because when he was trying to drag me out of the lane, I felt fine that I can hold there. It felt normal.
Vitaly Laletin: Does he think that his arm length helped him?
Alex Kurdecha: Yeah, definitely helped, but still those last five centimeters were still so tough. But I felt like as I worked him more and more, it was getting easier and easier still. Can you say it again? You're getting lost. If I had it, it would be even easier. The fourth round? Yeah, if I had it, it would be even easier for me.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, if there was a fourth round, it would be even easier. Oh, so he was guessing out, Michael was guessing out. Yeah, no Michael, Ustaval. Yeah. Does he think that normally Michael in this position, you know, he climbs up? Does he think that because of his very strong grip, Michael didn't have that opportunity to climb up?
Alex Kurdecha: Yeah, I climbed down as hard as I could. It helped because he couldn't just slip away and he couldn't climb. I was just holding him down.
Alex Kurdecha: grip strength as well right yeah he was he was clamping like as hard as he can oh yeah is that is that ermes mentioned something but after he did this did he also a little bit pronate just to bring the michael's riser ermes
Vitaly Laletin: I didn't just press it, I pressed it with my thumb here. To turn it around a little. Because when he raised his finger, it would be hard for me to press it.
Alex Kurdecha: Yeah, I wasn't just pushing. I was constantly going through the thumb. Because when he was doing this, like letting go with fingers, I couldn't just press him down. So I was constantly pushing and twisting him. Did he feel that Michael's riser went down like this? Did he feel? Did he realize that?
Alex Kurdecha: Yeah, the riser that he was talking about, one of the strongest in the world, I felt it. I felt that it was going more and more and more when I was pushing it. Go ahead, go with it.
Alex Kurdecha: Yeah, and because his fingers are pretty short compared to mine, he was setting up very high and closing up very high while I was closed a bit lower and I just couldn't connect, couldn't do my move as I wanted to. So that was a bit tougher too.
Engin Terzi: Okay, okay, yeah. And there are two superstresses I want to quickly read. And Tristan Ho says, well done, Vitaly. We look forward to your fight with Devon. Also arrange Alijan versus Dadikyan. Can you translate for him? And Dino says, is Dadikyan versus Alijan next? We don't know yet.
Alex Kurdecha: So, Vitaly, what Michael made you feel is something unique that you haven't felt before? Stylistically and the way that he applies the pressure? Stylistically, it was an unusual match. What he made you feel was unusual. Usually people don't fight like that. Was it a new match for you?
Vitaly Laletin: Yes, there was a new match, but I understood that I can't do anything else, because I think that any other athlete would not be able to defeat Michael in any other way, only in this fight, only in this way he can be defeated.
Alex Kurdecha: It was new, but at the same time, I felt like I had only one lane. Just press him down. Sorry, he said it wasn't or it was? It was a new match for him. It was a new experience. Yes. But it was only one option to beat Michael. And it goes for every other athlete as well. There is only one way you can win against Michael. Just press him down. That's interesting. We all thought that he could do something with our side.
Alex Kurdecha: But it wasn't possible, it was surprising. I didn't have any other options, I had to. Yeah, one guy says that, some live streamer says that, yeah, those are haters, my friend, just ignore them.
Engin Terzi: I mean, you walk on the sea, they will just say that you don't know how to swim. Just ignore them. East versus West came to this success, even though with all the hate and negativity of those people. So just ignore them. Anyway, so Vitaly. So Devon said that Devon made a video and he said that he's ready to pull you.
Engin Terzi: and as long as organization is okay with it and he wants to pull you on august 9th and i'm the guy who's setting all the matches and i think it's a great idea and i talk with you privately and in fact i also talk
Engin Terzi: with Levan Levan Saginashvili. And Levan said that he wants to pull the winner of you and Devon.
Alex Kurdecha: After your match, we discussed it with you personally. The match with Devon. Everyone wants to see it. Devon is also waiting. He said that if everyone agrees, it will be very cool to fight on August 9th. And Levan told me that he wants to fight the next match with the winner. You and Devon. That's great.
Alex Kurdecha: That's all very good. Perfect. But first we have to see how Ermes pulls Levan and work off of that as well. Yeah, I mean, right now, as of now, Levan is the champion.
Engin Terzi: next month you may change and and in the video they will also mention that you know like what does levon think about it so i think that i think that right now the world wants to see this match yeah i think i think vitality has a bit disadvantage uh by just pulling three months before that match
Engin Terzi: But I don't think that, you know, it will be an issue. And so, Vitaly, Devon said that you are going to lose to three Americans in a row. And now you beat Michael. After beating Michael, do you now see your chances against Devon, the chance that you were thinking you had before Michael match? Or after Michael match, you think that
Alex Kurdecha: It will be even more difficult for you. Devon said that you will lose to all three Americans and you have already beaten Michael. Now you have chances against Devon. After you beat Michael, have they changed? Do you feel that you have more chances? I think, visually, I see that Michael is stronger than Devon at the moment.
Alex Kurdecha: Yeah, but even visually, when I look at Michael, I would say he's stronger than Devon. I beat the first American so far, I'll get the second one this year, and hopefully another one next year. Okay, so, but the question was a little bit different.
Engin Terzi: Like before Michael match, he was, he had an idea about his chance against Elin. Yeah. Yeah. You want to ask him again? I can ask again. Oh, okay. Yeah. Like, like does, does he think that like now he believes his chances more or now he thinks that no, it will probably be more difficult. Yeah. He said that he thinks that Michael is stronger.
Alex Kurdecha: maybe in a defensive arm position but not sure about the riser and other things but yeah maybe try again if he doesn't want to answer
Alex Kurdecha: he he's lagging a bit yeah i mean devon's offense i wouldn't say it's better than michael's but at the same time i would say michael's defense is better than devon's so i wasn't scared before pulling michael of devon but now even more like i'm not scared
Engin Terzi: oh okay after he saw his performance this way that's right yeah after michael even less so he's even more but is it after michael even less is because it is depending like like this answer is coming by basing his performance like how would he perform against that that that move
Alex Kurdecha: You said that you feel more confident now and it will be even easier with Devon. Is it because of the press, because of how much you managed to beat Michael and how you beat him? If I managed to beat Michael with the press, his King's Move, then I will definitely beat Devon. This is one hundred percent. Because I will be even better at that time.
Engin Terzi: yeah for sure if i beat michael with my press and i got through his king's move for sure 100 i will get through devon's and at the time when we pull i'm going to be even better than that that's the thing that against them if he would pull if he said this match like does he think that he will be in such position or there is a possibility that he might upload them
Alex Kurdecha: In the flop, you mean? No, no, no. What I'm just saying is that if you set this match, is he going to, does he expect to be put in this position again, or does he think that there is a possibility that he might not get it? I think I can get it up, I can twist his wrist.
Alex Kurdecha: Yeah, I think I can toproll him. I think I can go through his rest. But did he expect to toproll Michael as well before the match? Did he expect to toproll Michael as well before the match? Did he expect to toproll Michael as well before the match? Did he expect to toproll Michael as well before the match? Did he expect to toproll Michael as well before the match? Did he expect to toproll Michael as well before the match? Did he expect to toproll Michael as well before the match? Did he expect to toproll Michael as well before the match? Did he expect to toproll Michael as well before the match? Did he expect to toproll Michael as well before the match? Did he expect to toproll Michael as well before the match? Did he expect to toproll Michael as well before the match? Did he expect to toproll Michael as well before the match? Did he expect to toproll Michael as well before the match? Did he expect to toproll Michael as well before the match? Did he expect to toproll Michael as well
Alex Kurdecha: Well, I knew that you can't really turn his pronator on. I know you cannot turn it on a little bit. But still, I wanted to, but the only round that I could do it, it was the third one. I did it in the third round. Other than that, I just couldn't. Yeah, but third round is where Michael came in, you know, Michael didn't do his mom. Yeah, but in the third round, Michael went to the press, he tried to push the press.
Alex Kurdecha: Yeah, but he was going a bit early. On the ready, he was already going. No, no, what I just tried to say, that when he did the round, that he controlled him.
Engin Terzi: Michael wasn't really attacking his hand, you know, that's what I try to say. Okay, Dino says that can't wait for Devon to say to Vitaly,
Alex Kurdecha: He says, I can't wait for Devon to say, remember me, Vitaly, remember me. Remember me. He said to Denis, remember me. Remember me. Yeah, yeah. But does Vitaly remember this? Do you remember Denis? He said it to him too. Remember me.
Engin Terzi: Yeah. Okay. Yeah, I remember. Yeah. Yeah. Well, miss ref says, we tell you will you press Devon if he went into his defensive position? And do you think it is easier or harder than pressing Michael?
Alex Kurdecha: I think easier. I think it's easier to press down.
Engin Terzi: Okay, so does he agree that Devon has a better center, but Michael has a better defense? Well, yes, I agree with that. If Devon gets to the center, he will have as much defense as Michael.
Alex Kurdecha: I agree, but if you go through center, his defense is not as good as Michael's. Yeah, this is what I tried to say. Dino says, Vitaly lost to Ermes really bothers him. It's a super chat. I'm not saying this. Mask it clear. It's a super chat. I'm not saying this. Mask it clear. It's a super chat. I'm not saying this. Mask it clear. It's a super chat. I'm not saying this. Mask it clear.
Engin Terzi: We'll deal with Aramis as well. It's all fine. We will deal with him. That's good. That's good. Dimitris starts there. He says, Engin, why are there two promotions, King of Table and East-West? Why not just keep one or make the difference between them clearer? Thanks. Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: Okay. Okay. So, Vitaly, I know probably we've talked before, but now we have next month in Chicago, East versus West 18. And first question, are you more impressed with Levan's 180 kilo SBAR curve or Ermes' 92 kilo 8 reps
Alex Kurdecha: back pressure which one impressed you more uh which one impressed you more
Alex Kurdecha: I think if what Ermes does is real, then it's more effective for arm wrestling. And it's better for arm wrestling. His back pressure lift is better for arm wrestling. Yeah. So he says that he's more impressed with that one? Yeah. Okay.
Engin Terzi: Ford some reason, I can't hear Vitaly when he starts talking. I don't know why. Yeah. Okay, so how about Devon versus Alex Kurdecha on the left hand? What do you think about Alex and Devon on the left? I think Devon will win. I think Devon is going to win. Has he seen the match between Corey and Devon on the left hand?
Alex Kurdecha: Have you seen Corey and Devon on LEGO when they were fighting on the 17th of May? No? No, no. Okay, so Jerry vs Morozov. I know you'll say Artyom, but it's still Jerry vs Artyom. I'll say Artyom won't be easy. But I want Artyom to win.
Alex Kurdecha: I won't say that it's going to be easy for Artem. I know it's going to be hard, but I want him to win. Okay. And which of these matches excite you most? Which matches excite you most? Which matches excite you most?
Engin Terzi: I think Artyom and Jerry and Ermes and Levan are the most interesting ones for me. Devon just wrote a comment. He says, he's so big and strong and all guys like me, very little chance, just a pit stop on his way to the double crown.
Alex Kurdecha: Devon is in the chat. Devon wrote in the chat, he says, here's Vitaly, so big and strong, and I'm just an old man. I have little chance for Vitaly. It will be just a pit stop, you know, in front of two crowns. And the question is, do you believe that he says it and he believes it, or do you think he just plays like that?
Vitaly Laletin: I think that Devon is playing. I don't think he believes that. I think he says that just to make me feel relaxed, but it doesn't work that way. I'm not going to get relaxed until I get to the win.
Engin Terzi: So he's saying that basically Devon is following a strategy. He did the same thing against Ermes. He said, oh, you are so strong, super strong and everything. And then at the table, he was not dead. Yeah. So Vitaly says that he's not going to fall into that trap.
Alex Kurdecha: If Devon is an old, weak athlete, I won't train for him. You won't train for him?
Engin Terzi: No, I will fight him, but don't tell him that I'm training. Tell him that I'm not training. Oh, okay. I will pull him, but just you tell him that I don't train. I will train, but you tell him that I don't train if he's so... Okay, so he is basically the same thing. He says that I'm all weak, and then Vitaly says that, oh, I'm not going to train for you. So they are basically playing the same game. Okay, that's good, that's good. At least both sides are super smart, you know.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, yeah. Devon says that I am like a practice pool for him. Just a practice pool, not really, you know. I mean, listen, I'm an organizer and I don't want to say my true feelings, but I mean, I know that's not how he feels. And he's coming there, Vitaly, to destroy you.
Alex Kurdecha: I'm not, it's not my opinion, but in him, he's coming there to destroy you. I'm the organizer, so I stay neutral, but I still think that Devon, even though he says it all, but he will never come to defeat, he will only go to destroy you. I'm not saying that he will do it, I'm just saying that he's going there to win. I've already believed him.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, I already believe him. Yeah. Already? He already believes everything Devon says, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, that's great. That's great. But listen, any strategy is strategy, you know? So, like, I know this guy.
Engin Terzi: This guy is, I don't know how to say, very smart guy. And also Devon is very smart guy. And Devon is also very experienced. Vitaly may not be as experienced as Devon, but he's also experienced. And I remember I was amazed.
Engin Terzi: by Vitaly's patience when he pulled in Malaysia 2015 against Alexander Getalo. The patience, I was like, I couldn't wait 10 minutes. Can you ask Vitaly, did he have a one loss
Alex Kurdecha: Before that one, by fouls, before the final match against Alexander, when you waited 10 minutes. Before that match with Gitala in Malaysia in 2015, you had a loss before that match, right? He says, because when I watched the match, so much patience, I couldn't stand for so long, I couldn't stand it. There was a loss, then I went out with Gitala, it was 1-1.
Alex Kurdecha: I had two losses and one fall before that. We pulled, it became 1-1. And then I beat him twice in the finals. But I had to wait so much. But he did not even attempt. How did he decide when to go?
Engin Terzi: it took like 10 minutes or 11 minutes and then they were like this and the table was like a lake table was like a lake because of the sweat and like how how did he decide that
Alex Kurdecha: Getalo was done, and then he finally pinned him. I was looking at the table, and it was like a lake of sweat. I was looking at the table, and it was like a lake of sweat. I was looking at the table, and it was like a lake of sweat. I was looking at the table, and it was like a lake of sweat. I was looking at the table, and it was like a lake of sweat. I was looking at the table, and it was like a lake of sweat. I was looking at the table, and it was like a lake of sweat. I was looking at the table, and it was like a lake of sweat. I was looking at the table, and it was like a lake of sweat. I was looking at the table, and it was like a lake of sweat. I was looking at the table, and it was like a lake of sweat. I was looking at the table, and it was like a lake of sweat. I was looking at the table, and it was like a lake of sweat. I was looking at
Vitaly Laletin: She went, went, and I gave it to her. I didn't start knocking, because I already had a flaw. If there was another flaw, I would have a breakdown.
Alex Kurdecha: Yeah, I mean, it was just so much pressure from him. I was just waiting for the pressure to go down to feel his hand getting tired and less power. And I wasn't attacking him. He kept attacking. And as he got tired, I felt that he has more and more movement. But at the same time, I couldn't really hit as much because I already had a foul. And if I fell another time, I would just lose. So I had to be careful. But I felt that he was getting tired and I just couldn't finish. Yeah.
Alex Kurdecha: Do you remember how wet the table was? Yeah, I remember how wet it was and I remember that I was so tired I got off the table and Artur comes up to me and tells me, oh, let's pull right arm. Artur Makarov? Yeah. It's funny, yeah.
Alex Kurdecha: Okay, Devon also says that, by the way, Devon, if you want to join, I can send you a link, just let me know. Devon says, I'm just coming to give honor to the young champion. Okay, well...
Engin Terzi: Go ahead, go ahead. Yeah, it's going to be just like that. He's going to come honor me because he will lose. Oh, okay. So, okay. So the winner will have all the honor. That's what he is. I will tell you something. This match, this match is very, very important match. This match, people have been asking,
Engin Terzi: for like years, years and years. And now they both are at their heaviest and strongest version. And this is an incredible match. I mean, this is like Devon and Levan pulled before. Devon and Ermes pulled before. Ermes and Levan pulled before. I'm not saying that their next match will not be super interesting. It will be incredibly interesting. But Vitaly Laletin and Devon has never, ever pulled before. This is
Alex Kurdecha: Probably one of the most important matches. It's a very important match in the sense that fans are waiting, and everyone has been waiting for so many years. Because Ermes fought with Levan, you fought with Levan, Devon, everyone fought with each other. And so many years have passed, and you have never fought. And it will be a very important match. A lot of people are waiting. I know that for sure. And most of all, who is not waiting for this is Devon.
Alex Kurdecha: I know I know that a lot of people wait I know that but I know that Devon is not looking forward for this match wow but he opened his head on his video he said he's ready as long as long as you want
Alex Kurdecha: And Levan wants to see this match, and the organization wants to see this match. Why do you think that Devon is not looking forward to this match? Yes, but he said in the video recently, I'm ready to fight with Vitaly if he gives me the green light, if Levan wants to see it, if everyone wants to see it. I've been giving him the green light since 2018, but he doesn't like it.
Alex Kurdecha: I gave him green light since 2018 and he's not coming forward to that light. But finally he said it, so why do you think that he still doesn't look forward?
Vitaly Laletin: Well, he still has time to cancel the match, so we'll see how it goes. Is he expecting something from Devon? You know,
Engin Terzi: he told everyone that we are pulling so at this point he has to come up because devon come on you told everybody you know we have to pull and you cannot go back anymore okay well well the miss graph okay he says prime engine versus current macro does who knows maybe non-prime engine will come and pull him again you know time will show but last time we pulled
Engin Terzi: I was winning 2-0 and then injury happened and he won, deservingly, yeah. Boss Royal, invite Devon to the calling. Let me check his WhatsApp. No, he didn't ask me to join. So if he asks me, I will gladly send him the link. Dino says, Vitaly, the dinosaur from Flintstones.
Alex Kurdecha: I thought Devon is a dinosaur. Oh, because of the age? Because of the arms, because the way his arms can open up and he walks like this all the time. Like this, yeah.
Engin Terzi: Does Vitaly think that this match will have, like, a strong meaning? Like, there are very powerful two countries on this earth. And does he think that this will be, like, another Rocky IV story? I don't know about the result, but just, like, is it going to be the...
Alex Kurdecha: West and East. Does he think that this will have a very strong impact? Do you think that your match with Devon will be very important? Two huge countries, there will be a tough match East against West. Will it be strong? There will be a lot of sense in the match. Yes, there will be a lot of sense in the match. Not so many people, heavyweights, with whom Devon did not fight, with whom he did not fight.
Alex Kurdecha: Yeah, because there are only so much super heavyweights Devon hasn't pulled yet. Like, who hasn't he pulled? Like, only... He didn't fight. Can you say that again, please? I'm saying, he fought a lot of heavyweights, but he didn't fight me. He didn't fight Ima, he didn't fight Morozov, he didn't fight Dzeranov.
Engin Terzi: He pulled almost everyone, but he hasn't pulled me, Artyom, and Dzeranov. I think it's going to be a very interesting match. A lot of meaning in it. Sam Siplenkov says, Classic mind games by Devon. By the looks of his responses in the chat, hyping Vitaly up towards a dominant win. Surely Vitaly has that taken care of.
Engin Terzi: He says, and Devon says, guys, stop disrespecting the upcoming double champion of East versus West, Vitaly. He doesn't need to train and will beat me easy. I may have 1% or 0.1. Yeah, yeah. And, okay, more Devon extreme about being underdog, more I realize that
Alex Kurdecha: He is thinking in the exact opposite way. Maybe you should say this part, what Devon says. Devon wrote in the chat, he says, guys, stop writing about Vitaly like that. He is still a double champion in East vs West. He doesn't even need to train to come and easily beat me. I don't even have a 0.1 chance. When I read such things, I am sure that the more he says this, the more he thinks about the opposite.
Engin Terzi: Right now, even though all those talking, you know, he's training his right arm and he's like typing with his left arm. Aha, Vitaly is a smart guy. Yes, yes. And Devon says, I am scared of Vitaly. Last time someone said this about Devon through the Puppet Master.
Engin Terzi: Devon got very angry. So I think that the more you say he's scared, the more he will be, I think, aggressive. This is how I feel. Yeah. Okay. I mean, if it's not a fake account or something... It is not. And then he's non-stop commenting and...
Engin Terzi: okay so i think i think that by the chat comments and the vitalis okay they will also share another one it says ducking europeans since 2005. 2005 europeans
Engin Terzi: Rightfully so. Rightfully so? Listen, Vitaly's, how to say, personality is calm and like, I mean, his words are not so much, but right to the point. And I kind of think that this is going to
Engin Terzi: make Devon turn to psychopath. But when I say psychopath, I don't mean disrespect. I am also a psychopath. Yeah, he says he's black in everyone, including Mindaugas and Bowen.
Alex Kurdecha: When I look at you, you are always so relaxed. With words so pointy. Not many words, but right where it hurts. It seems to me that when he gets to the body, he will go crazy, he will turn into a psychopath. Vitaly doesn't speak unnecessarily. He doesn't need to speak, he doesn't speak, he just sits quietly. Vitaly.
Engin Terzi: We are, we have a time machine. We went August 9th and the main event, of course, a bit after midnight. So now it is August 10th. If we said this match and just say that next morning we all wake up. So what's the social media saying about this match?
Alex Kurdecha: imagine that we have a time machine and we sit in it, yes, and we appear, well, since this is the main fight of the evening, we appear on August 10, we wake up in the morning and what do social networks say about this match of yours, as they say, it took a long time to destroy Devon, you did the right thing,
Alex Kurdecha: They all, everyone is saying finally, you know, you should have done it sooner, finally destroyed Devon. Oh, everyone is saying that finally Vitaly destroyed Devon and they should have, like, we should have said this match earlier? Sooner. Sooner, yeah. Sooner. Ah, okay. Vitaly, we didn't even think you could beat Devon so easily. Wow.
Engin Terzi: I can count it off till the morning. It's going to be a lot. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'm sure that Devon is noting all of this. And then he's going to use all of this to his preparation and motivation. Anyway, so let's see. Let's see. So, Vitaly, you are ready to pull Devon? Yeah, no problem.
Engin Terzi: No problem. Tomorrow? Oh, no, not tomorrow. You said you have soreness here. It's enough for Devon, yeah. Listen, he's not telling us the truth. He doesn't take Devon that lightly.
Alex Kurdecha: About the time machine, I imagine waking up in the morning, calming Devon down, going with him to the airport, you know, telling him it's fine, it's okay. I can't stop thinking about it.
Engin Terzi: He said he would dry his tears or what? What did he do like this? Yeah, a little tissue, yeah. Dry his tears a little bit. Is he going to give Devon the tissue or he's going to do it for Devon? Sorry, what? Is he going to give the tissue to Devon or he's going to do it himself? Ah, is he going to give the tissue to Devon or he's going to do it himself?
Engin Terzi: oh yeah i'll wipe the tears and i'll give him as well uh a training plan how to train correctly okay let me just tell him tell him uh honestly i understand vital i don't know what kind of game you're playing but you are not underestimating devon as much as now you're talking about
Alex Kurdecha: Yeah, of course I take it seriously, but I know Devon's tricks and I'm not gonna fall for them.
Engin Terzi: Does he talk about psychological tricks or just he's talking about the tricks, you know? Psychological doesn't even matter. I don't know English anyway. Did you know that Devon is learning Russian so it can get into your skin?
Vitaly Laletin: Do you know that Devon is learning Russian now so that you can get more under your skin? He will teach me Russian in Russian, tell me something, fairy tales before going to bed. Will he teach you Russian to tell you fairy tales? I say, let him learn Russian so that he can tell me fairy tales before going to bed.
Alex Kurdecha: he better learn russian not to like trash talk and stuff like this but when i go to sleep so he can tell me stories before i go to sleep that's going to be more effective use of his russian again sorry say again he'd rather learn russian to tell stories to vitality before he goes to sleep rather than using it for the psychological stuff
Alex Kurdecha: Yeah, I mean, he tells stories anyway all the time, especially on the press conference, talking some scary stuff all the time. But does he know that we will have a translator at the press conference? He can't ignore.
Vitaly Laletin: I'm going to sit without a translator. He's going to sit, but we need a translator. Maybe he'll put some cotton into his ears. Yes, my translator will filter Devon's conversation. He will only ask me questions that I will answer, but he won't answer Devon's questions.
Engin Terzi: Okay, so my translator will filter everything and I'm only going to ask questions. I'm not going to listen to Devon and his stuff that he's saying. He's talking about you, Alex. But Vitaly, don't trust Alex. Alex, even his Instagram, sorry, Instagram, WhatsApp photo is a memory photo with Devon.
Alex Kurdecha: Devon't be so sure about what you're planning. No, I'm serious. He was supporting Devon when he was pulling Levan. And he's Georgii. Think the rest.
Alex Kurdecha: Yeah. I'm not trusting anyone anyway. Only Devon. Okay. Vitaly.
Engin Terzi: August 9th, either midnight or like after midnight, before midnight, the referee closed their hands without the strap. Ready, go. What's happening? Going to strap. Devon will try to run away from me. I'll follow him.
Alex Kurdecha: Get over him and put him to the pad. Oh, no strap. Can he do that three times? It's going to be the fastest match Devon ever had. Listen, ask him if he's pulling our legs.
Engin Terzi: No, people all the time, they're waiting, waiting, but this time, just give me 10 minutes. Okay, okay. You were also curious about beating Michael without strap, but it didn't happen.
Alex Kurdecha: He says he wanted to fight with Michael too, but it didn't work out. Well, it worked out in the third round. In any case, Michael is stronger than Devon. Where exactly is Michael stronger?
Engin Terzi: I would say the wrist, the rising, the pronation definitely stronger than Devon's. Yeah, but how does he know this? Does he judge by comparing his practice pulls with Devon and then his competition pull with Michael?
Vitaly Laletin: How do you compare it? Do you watch who Devon fights? Maybe at the table or at competitions? Visually, I see that Devon's fist still falls, but not Michael's. In Kings movie, Michael is more confident than Devon.
Alex Kurdecha: know you you can just see it visually when he pulls i i see devon losing his wrist his wrist going a bit while michael don't doesn't really go and michael is so much better here as well okay so one second when you say that devon is losing a bit his wrist in like which match last time uh just just just just like like his match against adams and devon's match against adams
Alex Kurdecha: That match with Devon and Ermes, I'm not so sure. Ermes looked very lost, like he didn't even pull. And I'm sure that in a rematch, he's going to be much more confident and he's going to win.
Vitaly Laletin: So basically he is comparing that. Does he realize that when he last time trained with Devon in Istanbul, Devon was about 110 kilos? Yes, but still, when you fought Devon in Istanbul last time, he was only 110 kilos. First of all, he was not 110, he was 120 and more kilos. He has already gained weight. And I don't think that he is going to lose weight. I don't think that he will become stronger due to a lot of weight.
Alex Kurdecha: I think he was already very big in Turkey when I pulled him. He said he was 120 or more. And additionally, he said that when Devon gets bigger, I wouldn't say he necessarily gets better and stronger. I would say that all this big weight doesn't really fit him. So he thinks that the weight gain doesn't help him a lot? Well, if he adds more weight, it won't help him much.
Vitaly Laletin: I think if he gains weight, it might help him. Yeah, if he gains weight, I wouldn't say he necessarily gets better. I don't think it works that way for him. But how about for Vitaly? He's also gaining weight. How about you? What do you gain? Does it help? I gain 30 kilograms a month. I gain 2-3 kilograms a year.
Alex Kurdecha: yes i gained weight as well but i gained it two three kilograms a year i don't gain 20 kilos in one month i i work on my weight and i'm filtering all the weight you know like making it quality and then one more question before we close um how much does he think that like
Alex Kurdecha: He will be better compared to Michael Match when he comes to the Devon match. And the last question. When you fight Devon, how much better will you be in your opinion compared to the match with Michael? Not much better, I think.
Alex Kurdecha: Yeah, I know it will be better, but I won't say it's going to be 10, 15, 20%. It's going to be two or three, maybe a bit more, but still, it matters a lot. Yes, it's still a lot better, yeah. And this will be his best shape ever.
Engin Terzi: Yes. And then one more question. What did he think when he saw Devon Beat and Denis Splenkov? Did it bother him as being his fellow countrymen?
Alex Kurdecha: First of all, obviously, I thought, like, why is Denis? Why it's not me? I wish it was me instead of Denis pulling Devon.
Alex Kurdecha: And in my head, I had this thought of beating Devon and getting revenge for Denis. So he feels that way? So he feels like he is going there to also avenge, you know, Denis' loss. Yeah.
Alex Kurdecha: Partially, yes. I have a score with Devon. In the chat, someone wrote, can you imagine losing to a 50-year-old?
Engin Terzi: the guy that he's writing did he write about himself okay and boss royal and you can read my super chat probably i missed it can you write here in a regular way without super chat so i can read because i won i won i i just missed it yeah uh he i think he asked would you ever go to canada to train with devin oh okay yeah let's let's ask yeah yeah
Vitaly Laletin: Can you ask Vitaly? Oh, okay. I'm asking in the chat. Would you ever go to Canada with Devon to train? Yes, I would love to train with Devon. I would spend at least a month training with him to learn some useful exercises from him. He's the greatest athlete in the world.
Alex Kurdecha: Obviously, with great honor, I would go there. Maybe not even for one training. Obviously, it would be so much better to go for like a month, so I can take in as much as I can, maybe take some training, some movements from the greatest athlete. Can you ask him, this also was my mind, when did he start armwrestling? When did you start fighting? I started fighting in 2002, when I was 13.
Engin Terzi: 2002. I was 13. Oh, 2002. So, he knows. He has followed, like, last prime years of John. What is his perception about John? Ford me, that was the best armwrestler in the world.
Vitaly Laletin: Also, when he starred in the movie, it turns out that this is my story, in fact. And I was very proud that there is such an athlete. And I didn't think that I would ever be able to hold his hand and meet him in real life.
Alex Kurdecha: Yeah, obviously he was the coolest, the greatest athlete I could ever think of. You know, seeing over the top, that is basically my story. And I had so much honor and I would never think that I could meet this guy. I could grip him up and see him in person. I didn't even think about it. When he was growing,
Engin Terzi: Like when John was pulling against all the Zloty tour matches, super matches and everything. Like in Russia, like John is an American and this guy is from Russia. But can you say that almost all of the Russian arm masters are a fan of John Brzezinski? Yes, well, you grew up at that moment when he fought Zloty. And even though he is an American, can you say that like Russians from Russia, that most, almost all Russians loved John, even though he was an American?
Vitaly Laletin: I think that 99% of people love John. Yeah, everyone. I would say 99%. Everyone loves John. Yeah. In 2007, I fought in the World Championship in Bulgaria. I took the third place in the World Championship in 2007. Farid Usmanov was sitting next to me. Farid said to me, if you train, you will be one of the strongest armwrestlers in the world.
Vitaly Laletin: He said, do you know who I am? I said, I don't know. He said, I'm Fahid Usmanov, I won in John Bozenko. I was so pleased that a person said such pleasant words to me, thanks to which I am now here.
Alex Kurdecha: You know, I look back, 2007, Bulgaria, Worlds. I placed number three there. And I remember I was sitting and next to me was sitting Ferit Osmanli. And he was talking to me saying, if you train, you will be one of the best in the world. And he told me, do you know who I am? And I said, I don't. He told me, I'm Ferit Osmanli. And, you know, I pulled and I had wins over John. And at the moment I was thinking that.
Engin Terzi: such a great athlete telling me words like this it was so much motivation and maybe because of that i'm here right now yeah yeah i remember vitale vitale in 2007 he took third in the world junior junior
Alex Kurdecha: Artyom Tainov was first. Who was second? Ruslan Chebirov. I don't really hear the name. Ruslan Babayev? No, no, no. Ruslan Chebirov. Oh, Chebirov, okay.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, he was second. And Vitaly was third. Okay. And first was Artem. But Artem Tainov at that time was representing Ukraine, I think. Yeah.
Alex Kurdecha: The first time I saw Vitaly in the seniors was in 2011 in Antalya. Was it his first year in the seniors? The first time I saw you in seniors was in 2011 in Antalya. It was your first year? Yes, it was my second year after Filipov.
Alex Kurdecha: Yeah, it was the first time. And on the next one against Filipov, I placed third on both arms. Yeah. And the right arm, Arsen, Ruslan and you? On the right, it's Artyom, Ruslan and you. Arsen Liliev, Ruslan Babayev? Ruslan Babayev, yes. I didn't hear it. Ford some reason, I don't hear Vitaly. Who was second, Irakli Gamtenaz or Ruslan Babayev?
Alex Kurdecha: i don't remember right now but i remember that that world's number four was rustam's brother um
Alex Kurdecha: I was second. Filippov was first, Europeans and Aliyah, and he was second. Yeah, but talking about left arm, I'm talking about right arm. On the right, not on the left. On the right, second, second. Oh, he was number two at both arms. Oh, he was only pulling left arm? No, no, both arms. He was number two on right and left. Oh, he did the final with the Arsen? You fought with Arsen in the final, it turns out. I don't remember, but Filippov was definitely on one hand.
Alex Kurdecha: I don't remember right now, but I definitely remember that one of arms was Filippov. I mean, Filippov is good with Lewa. Right arm, Filippov wasn't champion for sure. Right arm, Arsen Lillia was in 90 kilo. Maybe, maybe. I don't really remember now. Okay. Okay. Anyways, so.
Alex Kurdecha: Who's winning? Levan or Ermes? You said you're going to beat Devon, so who will be your next opponent? Because Ermes doesn't want to pull me, I want Levan to win. Who says that Ermes doesn't want to pull? He's going to pull him anyway. It's too late.
Engin Terzi: Didn't believe that I would win against Michael. So he can now believe that I won't win against Levan too. Okay, so Ermes has 70% Michael, 30% Vitaly. And now Vitaly. Okay, but that's interesting that Vitaly's answers are depending on like Ermes' behavior.
Alex Kurdecha: You always listen to Ermes and listen to his opinion. He said that Michael is a 70-30 favorite against Italy.
Alex Kurdecha: No, I'm just joking. Because in reality, always when I see the match, I always root for the underdog and for the weaker athlete. So this time I will be rooting for Ermes. That sounds like disrespect, you know, weaker guy, underdog.
Engin Terzi: Last time he was weaker, for me he remained weaker. When he wins, I will consider him stronger.
Alex Kurdecha: Also, if Ermes beats Levan, coming up, would he still face Levan or will he just go for Ermes for number one? Vitaly, if you beat Devon, what weight do you plan to bring to the match with Levan? And if Ermes beats Levan, will you go straight to Ermes for the title or will you beat Levan first?
Vitaly Laletin: If Ermes wins, I would probably go for Levan because I never pulled him and for me it would be an honor to pull him. I really want to try. As for the weight, I wouldn't go more than 150.
Engin Terzi: okay guys we are finishing the podcast and the guys who are asking about dennis and saying that uh i'm ignoring i'm not ignoring my friend i explained to you guys uh i think by july dennis will start training and after he starts training once he is ready he will let me know and then we will talk about
Engin Terzi: any possible matchup for him. Guys, just because you love Denis, I love Denis too. Denis is a great man. It doesn't mean that the guy is ready anytime you wish him to compete. Ford me, Denis is my friend and I care more about his health. Looks like his health is going just better and better and better. And I wish him
Engin Terzi: like full recovery, full health, and then we can talk about arm wrestling. But right now, I think very soon we will know. But it looks very hopeful. Yeah, it looks very hopeful. Yeah. And can you ask Vitaly, what does he know about Denis? I heard that he's going to start training after July.
Alex Kurdecha: I haven't really talked to him for a while, but I will be there in the end of August in Moscow, and only then I will meet him, so not so sure.
Vitaly Laletin: He also invited me to be a special guest for Armatura in September.
Alex Kurdecha: Yeah, they were inviting you and him as well at the tournament as an assistant, so we'll see. Yeah, yeah, maybe if it is not coming to a very busy time, I want to come. I want to come and be their guest, yeah. Vitaly, thank you very much for your valuable time.
Engin Terzi: And get ready. I'm sure Devon will be ready as well. And this will be one of the most important super heavyweight clashes in history. Thank you very much for your valuable time. Get ready well, because I know Devon will be preparing hard. And I think it will be one of the most important, super heavy matches in history. Thank you, Angel. Thank you, Alex.
Engin Terzi: thank you thank you alex first of all thank you thanks everyone
