Engin Terzi: We are now live. Beautiful. Okay, where is Ricard? He's coming, right? Yeah, he shouldn't be too far away. We got the thumbs up on him when we sent him the link, so he shouldn't be too far away. So, Wallace, I will just share the link on social media and then I want to start talking with you guys.
Engin Terzi: As soon as Ricard, how do you pronounce his name, Ricard? Yeah, Ricard, Ricard. Ricard, Ricard, okay. And your name pronounced Wallace? Correct, yep. Okay, yeah. Here he is. Okay, Ryan Bowen, 100% needed for this podcast.
Engin Terzi: Ryan is the one that, you know, introduced this young talent to the rest of the world. I'm excited. I'm excited. I can't wait for this match, of course. Yeah. Wallace, normally we have translators, you know, as the fourth person, you know, not, not, not, but don't, don't expect Ryan to be objective about this one. Devon't worry, I'll roll the punches, so.
Engin Terzi: Okay, you tell me how to pronounce your name. Ryan told me, but you are from South Africa originally, right? Yes, that's correct. And how do I pronounce your name, Riekerd? That's pretty good. That's pretty good. Yeah. Riekerd? Yeah, that's perfect. Okay. Yeah. And then last one I'm sharing on the
Engin Terzi: Uh, Instagram, the link, and then we are starting. So I want to start while I'm, I'm sharing this Wallace. Well, we, we just told you, um, like I heard your name from Robert. I think you guys competed the nationals together. Was it like a year ago, two years ago? Oh, with Robert. Yeah, that was actually, that's a good one.
Engin Terzi: That's been going on probably three years ago, two and a half to three. Yeah. So, but then suddenly you became someone who is knocking the door of the elite armwrestling. Absolutely. Yeah. And then you won the qualification event.
Engin Terzi: and last year and you had been waiting uh for the match that you earned it and and then we saw you against Marcio and other guys and like how when did you start armwrestling like i'm very curious about you um i started so this summer it will be four years okay yeah it will be four years and probably
Engin Terzi: like seriously, you know, maybe, maybe three years where I'm more consistent, you know? Yeah. Yeah. This, this is just like, it just shows that, you know, like something is special with you. Seriously. Like someone, how old are you? I am 41. So you are 41. So you are, you sound like another Tata Kingston president.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, maybe, maybe. Yeah, you started at 37, 38 and 41 and then we saw you against Marcio and Marcio looked in incredible shape and so how do you think that this is happening, that you just like suddenly
Wallace Dilley: becoming someone who is, as I said, you know, knocking the elite arm wrestling door? Well, I just I'm built a little different, Ingen, I think I've always loved. I've always loved being strong. I beat my I beat my teachers in arm wrestling when I was, I don't know, fourth, fifth, sixth grade. I was beating my male teachers. Mm hmm. But it's something I didn't know it was a thing to do. It was just something fun that I did with my dad.
Wallace Dilley: You know, I beat him. I think I beat my dad at like 16 years old, but I got more into bodybuilding probably was someone stronger as well. Yeah. If you are like, yeah, my dad is incredibly strong. Yes. Okay. So you're not beating a regular dad. You're beating. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, so much. Yeah. So no, I just,
Engin Terzi: Just how it's always been. And I just never, I wish I started arm wrestling at 31, not 41, but what do you do? So, I mean, listen, never, never late, never late, you know, especially someone like you. Yeah. But so if you are telling me that you were beating your teachers, your father, so you were not, I mean, you were an arm wrestler. You have been an arm wrestler because if you are that good, probably there and here you were arm wrestling.
Engin Terzi: all your life, you know, maybe not very often, but whenever the subject is arm wrestling, you are probably someone that, you know, Hey, let me try. Yes. Yeah. Maybe, but to say I was training, it would be a stretch. It was more of every once in a while. Right. Just, just arm wrestling when the subject is arm wrestling. Yeah, exactly. And can you tell me also how tall,
Engin Terzi: you are and what's your weight? 6'3 and about 3'15 right now. 3'15, 3'15 is about 140 kilos. Yeah, I mean, yeah, almost, yeah, more probably. And, okay, okay. And, Ricard. Yes, I'm good. Yeah, if I pronounce, you just forgive me.
Engin Terzi: No, it's beautiful. Okay. So how old are you, my friend? I've just turned 22. 22. You are very, very young. And we have been hearing about you, Ryan, last two years? Three years? Yeah, I think two and a half years I've known Enrique before. So, yeah. Okay. And Enrique, like, were you armwrestling before?
Riekerd Bornman: So I competed in a few, it's the same thing. I loved the sport. I think it was during my high school period.
Riekerd Bornman: I went on YouTube and I watched some armwrestling matches and it's all those matches of Devon that popped up and that's when I started loving the sport. We all know armwrestling and you do it with your friends and everything, but yes, I fell in love with the sport. I went to a couple of comps in South Africa without any training just to see what it's all about. I met Terence and a few of the big guys in South Africa and then I decided to come over to Australia to play rugby.
Riekerd Bornman: I forgot about the arm wrestling until I saw a competition at a meat shop that I was going to. And I decided to compete, and then I just fell in love with the sport. And yeah, that's how it started for me. And can you also tell us, you are probably around 125, 130 kilo? I'm 130 now. I've been pushing really hard. 130 kilo, wow. Yes, yes.
Riekerd Bornman: Big guys there. Yes, the thing is, since I booked the match, I gained 8kgs. I was about 122. So, yes, I tried my best to get as big as possible. So, yeah. Good morning, Wallace. Good morning, Ryan. Sorry I didn't greet you guys. I was a bit, still waking up. I mean, I will really feel sorry for the guy who loses this match.
Engin Terzi: because like they both are just rising stars, you know, they both are rising stars and they have been in the sport almost like same time. Yeah. Yeah. And, and one is the hope. Should I say you are hope of Australia or South Africa?
Ryan Bowen: I'm a proud South African. I'm a proud South African. We're just trying to claim him a little bit on the side. Ryan, just stop trying to... He came into Australia and within two weeks we all knew, hang on, this dude's a real problem.
Engin Terzi: And then Wallace is now rising, hope I should say, US. And Wallace, like, am I wrong or on social media you sound very confident? Yeah, you could say that I'm confident. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I know he's a strong guy and I'm not doubting that.
Wallace Dilley: I just haven't seen much to know what his level's at. You know, Devon is in my rear view mirror. So I just don't know. And then, did you talk with anyone who knows both of you and felt both of you? What are their opinions? Good question, good question. Someone who's felt us both? I actually watched a podcast that Devon had with
Riekerd Bornman: I can't remember the guy's name, sorry. And Devon, he tried to explain the difference between us, but he sounded to be more in your favour because he's from America. So, I don't think you have anything to worry about. You should be good. Riekerd, I think you are just... This is like a strategy. Like, don't worry, everything is good. That also sounds like a huge confidence, you know, whenever...
Riekerd Bornman: You talk like, anytime someone says, don't worry, don't worry, you're great. The same thing the devil was telling to Ermes, I only have 1%, you know. And... Yeah, I'm gonna... He beat all his teachers and his dad and all that. So then it would be easy to beat a child, you know. So, I just can't wait. We are super blessed, both of us, to have this opportunity. I think we both are gonna give...
Riekerd Bornman: everything everything this is our opportunity to showcase what we have been doing for this short time and how much we love the sport and unfortunately um i take these opportunities very seriously and um i normally do good so i'm super happy um prev has been going good and uh
Riekerd Bornman: The thing is, me and Wallace, we are in this game for the same amount of time. So it's not going to be so technical, you know. It's going to come down to who's going to be the strongest on the day. And it's going to be this elbow, you know. The elbow. You can ask Ryan, it's the elbow that matters. I want to add about both of these guys here. I haven't obviously gripped with Wallace yet.
Ryan Bowen: had a chance to train with him. But I remember I asked John Brzenk once upon a time, I said, I asked John, how do you know whether you've got elite potential within you? Like, how long does it take to become elite? And John said, look, you know, you know, within the first three years, if you're going to be amongst the elite, and both of these guys in the first three years are already knocking down elites. So they've both got clearly, as you mentioned before,
Ryan Bowen: something genetically going on. I can speak of Ricard in the sense that I've had the opportunity to grip up with many, many people, train with many, many people, and I can't feel, I can't see the horizon on where Ricard's power is. I don't know how strong Ricard is because he's just so far stronger than me than
Engin Terzi: that I just, I wouldn't have a clue where his actual limit of power is. So I can't give you any hints, Wallace, as to how strong he is either, because I don't know. He's far too strong. Wallace, I told you, the guy just came here just to intimidate you. I told you he will not be objective, you know. He is just here. Yeah, I tell you, guaranteed, 10 minutes ago, they were on the phone, and then they just planned on, I'm joking, joking. Come on, Inga, I'm a kid, I need some help, man.
Wallace Dilley: It'll be a good match. There's no doubt. There's no doubt. I would say he's the future for sure. I don't argue with that. 21-year-old, what he's doing is amazing. But I'm the here and now. I'm right now. He might be the future, but I think you're going to be pretty shocked what I'm going to do in the next year. What do you consider your strength? What is your best weapon?
Wallace Dilley: I'd say when I first started, it was hand and wrist. You know, nobody could take my hand, my cup, my pronator. But now my side pressure is probably my dominant. I don't think I have a weakness, to be honest. I think it's a full package. I saw you even doing shoulder press against Marcio.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, that was not so surprising. I will tell you what, Riekerd's progress is great, but not surprising for his age. But your progress is very surprising. It's really strange. It's something I can't understand either.
Engin Terzi: because I've been watching all these sports matches and it's just suddenly something happened. Some people are special. I mean, it would be great if these guys started seriously armwrestling at the age of 15, when their motor abilities are just coming, you understand? Just imagine what kind of genetic he has to improve that quick. Probably at the beginning he didn't know much,
Engin Terzi: But now, the more he learns, the more it just makes him effective. Ricard, did you realize that he said, he is today, and you are tomorrow, and you will be shocked? And you know, as a promoter, it is my job to catch these words. You know? Yeah. You got that perfect. Yeah, I'm going to catch every word.
Riekerd Bornman: Be careful what you are saying. So, are you the future? Arsen you not today? I think the thing is I'm still young and I'm enjoying the sport so much. It's just big opportunities like this, I just don't give away easily. I'm telling you guys, I'm ready to do anything. I'm ready to break my arm if that is what it takes, I promise you. But I've trained too hard. I have so many people that believe in me.
Riekerd Bornman: And at the end of the day, I'm doing this for all the kids out there that wants to be someone or something someday. And that motivates me. So if I don't get it, it's all good. I'm going to go back training anyway. But my mindset is straight on winning. And I can't see Wallace winning. Even though he's bigger than me, I think I'm much quicker than him. And I'm going to expose his pronator and bicep, and he won't know what to do. I'll be attacking.
Engin Terzi: From the really gun, he'll be defending and to get from defending to attacking is going to be really hard for him because I won't give him an inch. That's what it's going to be. Riekerd, whenever you see Wallace at the other side of the table, you will look at him as someone who is standing on your way to your next East versus West match, right?
Riekerd Bornman: That's exactly, that's the honest truth. That's the honest truth, I promise you. And he will be like, Wallace, nothing personal but my friend. My friend. That's 100%. Look at the arm, look at the arm, Ricardo. Hey, Wallace, what does your boys think? What's your boys think? Oh, this guy looks huge. Bicep? Yeah, it's about 22 when it's pumped.
Riekerd Bornman: 22, yeah, that's big, okay. I'm almost at your level, but that's a bit big, I'm not gonna lie. So that's about 56 or 55. Yeah, I don't know whatever that means. Okay. I'm just here in Nebraska, so I don't understand all that fancy kilometer, centimeter talk. I mean, listen, from this side of the world, those miles and inches are so...
Engin Terzi: Sounds the same. It's all the same, I guess. Yeah, yeah. JoLan Clark says, Wallace is an amazing person. He is willing to teach and work with others to increase their potential, too. I believe he has an exceptional chance to beat Ricard. Thanks, bro. Appreciate it. OK. And I'll share one thing about
Ryan Bowen: that I've observed as well. When you think about someone who has, both these guys are strong, I know this, but when I think about someone who has got almost, not just a mental strength, but spiritual strength behind him, I've never seen a family of like, all of South Africa is going to be going nuts. I'll tell you, when Ricard just performed at a low level tournament in Australia,
Ryan Bowen: and it was live, there's hundreds of his family crammed into a room watching the live stream. They're coming from everywhere. I've never seen so much love and support from a family back home as Rick has. I know that it's probably going to be 10 times again for this one being East vs West. So he's going to have a lot of spiritual sort of support, support from his family behind him. That's a big factor.
Riekerd Bornman: I'm really blessed to have that. Unfortunately, I don't have them with me in Australia. On that day, it's just so much bigger. It gets so emotional. With the rugby, it was always good. You have everyone on the side of the field watching you back home and supporting you. Back here, you're all by yourself. Yes, I do have a lot of people supporting me and backing me over here, but it's just different if it's your family. You see the emotion when they watch you on the TV.
Ryan Bowen: That's something special, you know. You can be how big you want to be. I truly don't care. It's got to be quick, hard and really strong. This match is going to be fought side pressure by the Sound of the Walls. You said that side pressure was your best asset. Rick had said his elbow was his best asset. You guys coming straight at each other or what?
Riekerd Bornman: No, Ryan, he's going to try and topple me first. He's going to try and topple me, then he's going to fail, then he's probably going to give away that round, because he's trying to topple me, and he's going to lose his pronator and his biceps. And then second round, it's going to be really hard to set up the match, because we both want to get in, you know.
Riekerd Bornman: then the truth is going to speak. You know, we both are young. Sorry, new into the sport, so that's what you can expect. No one wants to be technical, you know? You want to win. That's what it is. So he's going to try and topple first round. Second round, he's going to feel what it's like. What it's like to go sideways. You are right about one thing. I'm definitely not young. But I am strong.
Wallace Dilley: And we'll see what happens. So basically you're telling me what you're going to do. So all I got to do is come in with a good bicep and pronator, right? Uh, that's, that's, that's if you try to talk. Okay. Yeah. So, so have you ever gotten to a hook with Marcio or Barbosa? No, I haven't, but I got into a hook with Lachlan a day. Uh, I'll tell you what I know about speed. I don't know if you watched Marcio kill everybody at that Utah event.
Wallace Dilley: But boy, I'll tell you, he is fast. And he had me a little scared. He was flashing everybody. When I came in and kind of stopped him like a wall, I was like, oh, OK. So I don't got to be fast. I just got to be strong. So I think I'm good to go, as young as you are. Yeah, but you have to understand, I'm not going fast back. I'm coming fast forward. That's the problem. Yeah.
Riekerd Bornman: So supernate, chop down, right? No, no, I don't supernate, I just cop really hard, and I push short like that. Yeah, yeah. Okay, but one thing you have to remember, so, remember, Mousio went back really quick, you know? And you have a strong hand, so that's risky of him to do. Because if you contain that, he's exposed 100%, and then he's out of position, and he has to come back in. And that's exactly what's going to happen if you try to do that.
Engin Terzi: So just join me from the start and we'll get it over with. I'm game for that. I'll shoot right wherever you want to go, buddy. I'm game. I'm just joking. I have a lot of respect for you. You are not joking. Come on, come on. You need to back it. No, no reverse shift. It's all forwards.
Engin Terzi: Ryan, I almost told you that, right? We don't need to get involved. Let them go. I said, wow, that's a beautiful podcast that they are just going at each other as they feel until Richard says, I'm just joking.
Ryan Bowen: Yeah, well, there's a lot on the line here. Like you said, again, kind of both guys making their debut, both guys, similar expectation from their local sort of clubs and whatnot. And both guys, realistically, won another match in East vs West, and only one of them is going to get it in that sort of immediate future anyway. So there's a lot on this match. There's a lot. There's a lot there. Big match. Mm-hmm. There is one guy, he says,
Engin Terzi: He says Riekerd is a different breed. As far as I understand, they both are different breeds. Both. And that's why I'm very, very curious. I see Wallace winning. I see Riekerd winning. I mean, I don't know a lot about them. Riekerd, tell me if this is true or not. But I remember when I first met Riekerd, he showed me footage of him pulling in a South African tournament.
Ryan Bowen: Whether it was his first tournament, second tournament, I'm not sure. But it was a very, very, very inexperienced Riekerd Bornman. And he was pulling Terence Opperman. Now, we all know Terence Opperman, how elite Terence Opperman is. It depends, you know, which Terence. Terence was coming back, today is different, in his prime, different. Even if it was a coming back Terence, when you're a brand new armwrestler, never having competed before,
Ryan Bowen: Terrence went sideways, Rickard contained him, Terrence couldn't pin him, Rickard got his shoulder behind, Terrence had to go to a Kings move, and eventually, because Rickard just was too new, didn't know how to finish it, Terrence took hand control and got the win. But it was a grinding war with Terrence Hoffman on his first ever tournament.
Ryan Bowen: That, to me, is kind of an indication of the weirdo factor that is Ricard Bornman. To do that in your first go against Terence, to me, very, very strange. What's your question? My question is, is that true? Is there any more context to that that we need to know? The thing is, I did a note to Irens back then, so I just knew that this is the number one guy and I'm going to grip up with him.
Riekerd Bornman: But everyone was taking it easy on me. No one was hitting or doing anything, any sudden movements. Back then I was afraid to come forward, you know, because you just, when you learn about arm wrestling, you're afraid to break your arm or tear your bicep or whatever. So I didn't come forward. I was just going back.
Riekerd Bornman: So immediately he had my hand, but my arm was still strong and I don't know, somehow I pulled into the strap and he couldn't finish. And it was going good and good and good. I got on my side of the table and yeah, don't know how to finish it, but just by watching videos, I got my shoulder behind it. But my hand was still a bit outside my shoulder and Terence just ripped through me. But yeah, that was probably one of my first ever tournaments in arm wrestling. And that's where,
Engin Terzi: That's where I really got hurt for the first time. Wallace, I want to ask you. In such a short time, you went a long way. And where do you see yourself when, just say that two, three years later, do you see the potential to make top ten in the world?
Wallace Dilley: Yeah, that's the plan. Yeah, I don't have. I don't have time on my side like record. You know he's got. He's got a hell of a future like I said and. I don't have time. I'm 41 so I have maybe a 10 year window, right? Maybe maybe 15. And so I'm going to keep grinding hard. The North American title is something that I. One of my goals for sure.
Wallace Dilley: I live here in the States, so I want to be the best in North America. So that's, that means Pavlo. That means Corey. That means Devon. Uh, North America right now, as we visit top five, you are, you are talking about like winning North American title is top five in the overall and the world. Yeah. But that's, yeah, that's where I see myself in the next couple of years. That's a big goal I have. But for right now, I mean, like, like we've all talked about, this is a huge opportunity.
Engin Terzi: throwing all my eggs in this basket right now for this. Can you repeat one more time your height? 6'3". 6'3", about 190. 190 centimeters, yeah. So you are about the same height as Ron Bath or Michael Todd. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Have you pulled Ron Bath's voice? Yeah, yeah. I got to pull Ron. He was at that Utah event.
Wallace Dilley: That's good. I didn't say. He doesn't really have anything for me. It was just it was just kind of just holding on to him in the after polls. I didn't get a poem in the event, you know. OK, I think I think he got knocked out by I want to say Jordan. So yeah, that's correct. Knocked him out. So then Ron was out of it, but I got to pull Ron afterwards and super. I mean, super strong. It's crazy what he's doing.
Ryan Bowen: at his age, and it's impressive. When he was 30, 35, 40, he was wall. Yeah, he was top of the world. The reason I ask it, there are not many common links between you guys, for people that have pulled both of you out, and Devon Underwood. But Ron similarly pulled Rick in the after pools of a moment as well.
Ryan Bowen: And by the sounds of what you did, I witnessed that I was watching it. And Ron did one of these to record after about three seconds of trying to move him. He bowed down and said, OK, I can't do it. I think that was to me, Ryan, unless he did it to record as well. But I think Ron did that to me as well. That's just Ron's thing, you know, that's just his thing to
Riekerd Bornman: give credit where it's due, I guess. Hey, Wallace, did you feel, gripping up with Ron, when he starts to tense up, you can feel all the cracks in his elbow and everything, right? Yes, I did feel that. That was bizarre. It's incredible how that man is still that strong for his age, right? It's incredible. That motivates me so much that I still have three years. He's 43 years out of my sleep, Ron. Yeah, 43. So, see, you can be strong when you're old. It's called
Engin Terzi: Old man strength, right? Heat strength. That's what's going to show you what's better than old man strength. And Riekerd, I will ask you, where do you see yourself in today's rankings? Do you see yourself in top 20 or top 15? Or do you think that you can beat someone from top 10? Because you believe that you're going to beat Wallace. This is what you said. Yeah.
Riekerd Bornman: The thing is, Ingen, right now, I'm taking the opportunity. I would like to, because at the end of the day, I want to be a world champion. That's one big thing for me. It's a massive dream. I think I have to be realistic, because it's really hard to be natural and to just eat a lot to be in the super heavyweights.
Riekerd Bornman: Ford this match, yes, I'm getting as big as possible. Any opportunity I get, I'm going to look at my opponent and see what I have to do. But I think the goal for me would be to, if I truly find myself in this sport and I see that I can progress, I would definitely try to go down to the 115 class and there I truly see myself as a good contender.
Riekerd Bornman: And you never know, I'm still young, so probably in another 10 years, I'll be super heavyweight. But I need to be working for something. I don't want to be top 5 in the world, I want to be number 1 in something in the world. So that's something that I want to work for. But right now, I mean, who's top 10?
Engin Terzi: I mean, you know the guys, you know, like... Yeah, yeah, yeah. Morozov, Dzeranov, Kurdecha. Yeah, that's big, and... You say, not yet? No, no. Or never? Not yet. Not yet, OK. Yeah. Not yet, OK. Well, the number one in the world at 115, Reno Masic. He's similar age to you, so he's kind of showed...
Engin Terzi: the world can be done at this age and even stylistically the strengths look pretty similar as well, so... Right, right. There is a weight limit there, you understand? Yes, I was mentioning that because Riekerd said... Ford Riekerd to become number one, he needs to be, just say, Devon Levan Saginashvili. So... And then in 115, you have the people who will be weighing as much as you do.
Ryan Bowen: And then do you think that you have the structure to become like a threat to the top? Do you have like... Ricard mentioned his elbow before. I've always marveled at the width of Ricard's elbow. Like when he puts it down on the pad, it's a lot wider than most people's elbows. How about this here? Yeah.
Engin Terzi: You see that elbow, how thick it is, Riekerd? Is that wide enough or no? That's not going to matter. It's going to be a pronator and bicep that's going to get it. Listen, listen, listen, Riekerd, before you talk, before you talk, just remember at the end of your word, don't say just joking.
Engin Terzi: I was thinking a bit too far. I was thinking a bit too far back then. But I think he understands that I'm actually talking from the heart. OK. OK. We are not joking. OK. Yeah. But it's what we're saying. That's a really thick elbow. I think that's a thicker elbow than Riekerd has.
Ryan Bowen: You have to remember it's a kid's elbow. Ricard is, I always, I don't know, some people look big on camera, some people don't look big on camera. And I don't know, Wallace, I can see lots of thickness through his chest and all that sort of stuff, for sure. But Ricard is someone when you meet him in person, you go, oh, you are a lot bigger than I realised you were, or than I thought you were from camera.
Ryan Bowen: I've seen many people have that reaction when they meet Rick. So we'll see. I don't know. The physicality will be interesting. Both similar weight, both similar height. I've been dreaming of this. I've been dreaming of this. I can't wait to look him in the eye. That's going to be the moment for me when he's going to feel that I'm going to win. I can't wait for that to happen. Who's going to win centre off the go? Who's going to be on A-side?
Riekerd Bornman: That's not a question. You need to ask Wallace how strong he is to come back from the defensive position. I'll start wherever you want. We can start here. No being nice to a kid. That's nice. Thank you. Appreciate that. Wherever you want to start, buddy. Wherever. Yeah.
Riekerd Bornman: This is going to be fun, Ingen. I'm truly so excited. Riekerd, is it cold in where you are, or you don't want to intimidate Wallace? It's actually really cold, but I can still intimidate him. That's not a problem. I am so screwed, Ingen. Do you see the difference? See the difference between these two? Wow.
Engin Terzi: Only the right. This is just going to go like this. Is that pregnant? Is that forearm pregnant? Nine months. Nine months. Wallace, Wallace, is Rickard bigger than you thought or smaller? Is he bigger than I thought? Yeah. Or smaller than you thought. Or the same as you expected.
Riekerd Bornman: Yeah, probably about as I expected. I wasn't expecting much, but like I said... I think you're actually expecting I'm bigger than you, because the thing is my body fat percentage is lower and almost the same weight, so I'm actually bigger than you if you think about it. Well, that's a fair point. Yeah, you do look pretty lean, but you're going to need to be a little bit thicker to be as strong as me, buddy. I am. I am. At 122, I was lean, but since I got that match, 8 kgs made me a bit fluffy, you know? Yeah.
Engin Terzi: It'll be fun. I'm looking forward to it. Like I said, there's no doubt you're the future. Yeah, you know, that's not really a compliment, you know. I mean, it is a compliment, but it's not really. That's what I'm trying to ask you, Ignatius. That is the only thing that he's using to give himself confidence. You see? Who's under more pressure?
Engin Terzi: Um, I, I didn't record because, because, because like he's young and he needs to prove and you know, this and that, like in the while you, you have someone only two, three years in the sports and, and he's got his whole life ahead of him. He's, you know, 21 years old. He's got years and years. I think I got the pressure. Well, my window is short.
Ryan Bowen: Right. Cause I'm old. I don't know. I just turned 40 Wallace. I feel so let's, let's, let's not get too ahead of ourselves. How long have you been pulling Ryan? 13 years. 13 years. Yeah. I wish I could say I'm one of those people that does it.
Ryan Bowen: that has to do the long road to the elite level. I'm still trying to get there. You guys just rolling it back. So I'll be impressed with the genetics.
Riekerd Bornman: 34 years. Incredible. That's incredible. Ingrid, my little brother started arm wrestling. And I'm so thankful that he started at 16 years old. And just imagine when he's my age, then he's going to be in the sport for already six years. I can't imagine. Because his elbow is exactly the same like mine. He doesn't feel any pain and he just goes sideways really hard. I'm excited for that aspect. And how is his build, his weight, his height?
Riekerd Bornman: Ingun, he's 16 years old, he looks me in the eyes and he weighs 110 kg. 110 kg, okay. It's crazy, it's crazy. But I will always beat him. That's my thing. Yeah, yeah, but do you think that you as 16 could beat him at 16? Not a chance, Ingun, not a chance. Then another freak is coming.
Riekerd Bornman: 100%. He just won the juniors and the 110kg class in South Africa at the nationals. It's incredible. I'm super proud of him. He won juniors and seniors? Yes, he won juniors and then they called him up for the 105kg senior men's. And he won there as well? Yes, yes. Okay, okay.
Engin Terzi: Yeah. Anyway, so Wallace, do you see when you look at record, you know, do you see someone who knows what he's talking about or you just see a young, passionate, you know, inexperienced guy that, you know, like we have a thing over here that, you know, until, you know, like, like someone who hasn't been punched,
Engin Terzi: would think that, you know, his fist is a stone, you understand? Do you see that kind of guy or you think that he knows what he's talking about? I can't say he's inexperienced because he's been doing it the same length as me, right? About three, four years. No, about life, about life. Sometimes you may be about something, but about the life when you're 21, I mean, you just think that you could even
Engin Terzi: Why, you know, if you wanted, you know, no, no, I'm just like, we all were just like, so I'm just trying to steal the pot, you know, I feel what you're saying. Life hasn't beaten down a little bit yet is what you're saying. Yeah. No.
Riekerd Bornman: I have to say one thing. Since I came over to Australia, I had to learn to fly by myself. I have been without my parents for three years now. So when I finished school, I came over straight away. And I have to say that I think that learned me a bit more about life. And it learned me to be responsible. Because now I'm looking at myself, and I need to make a difference. You're by your own, yeah. What brought you over? You're from South Africa.
Riekerd Bornman: Why did you go to Australia? I actually got the opportunity to go play rugby in Australia and I got injured. I tore my ATFL and that's where the arm wrestling came in. But yeah, that's what happened. I was playing rugby in South Africa, really enjoyed it. Rugby was running through my blood and I had to give it up and that was probably one of the hardest decisions in my life. I didn't have my parents here to
Riekerd Bornman: Do you have that emotional support? Because the thing is, I was taken away from my parents to try and play rugby in a different country. And I was really excited about that. And then it's gone, you know? No more rugby. But you can go back to it, right? As young as you are, right? You can go back. Arsen you saying your knees are chopped?
Riekerd Bornman: No, no, no. I have problems. That's what I'm trying to say with my tibia on the side of my surgery. So I do have problems. I know there's ways to fix it now. But at the end of the day, I'm going to beat you. I'm going to beat whoever's next. And then I'm going to be the world champion. So that's my new focus. World champion. You know, I train with a world champion every week. Who's that? He's about your age. Easton McCormick.
Riekerd Bornman: yeah is that the guy who also called the kid oh yeah you watched my video so you you do tune in i like of course of course i respect you so i have to see what you're doing i need to see where where's that weakness i just see it and definitely don't try to topple you're terrible in a topple telling you straight away no problem no no no high knuckle
Riekerd Bornman: Devon't go backwards. The thing is, if you go high knuckle, you're going to cover my knuckle, my thumb, you know, because we're both the same height. So you're going to be more or less like this. You know, you can't be like this. That's going to be hard. And the thing is, now you're going to be like this, trying to topple me. And I'm just going to boom. I thought Devon said your arm was longer than mine though. He said your arm is incredibly long.
Riekerd Bornman: I think he just had no chance, because I didn't even feel him, you know? So I think he's just telling you all this kind of stuff, because he truly felt like a brick wall hitting my arm, you know? So that's probably why I'm longer, 10 times bigger. I'm probably weighing 170 in his eyes. Well, Ingen, I quit. I can't pull him. That's too much.
Wallace Dilley: I can't believe that you are that quickly intimidated by this young guy, Wallace. Like I said, he's the future. What am I supposed to do? Win today. Win today, that's right. I am here now and I'm here to stay.
Engin Terzi: I can't get the smile off my face saying it. I'm loving it. Me too, me too. Like, I thought that you and I, we would be doing a lot of talk, but just, I mean, I love it. You know, there is one, one, one mature guy, Wallace, you know, like, like a father is listening to this young guy, but young guy is not talking cheap either. You know, he knows what he's talking about and he's not like overconfident, you know, ignorant guy. He's really,
Riekerd Bornman: Following check-in, you know what his opponent is doing, I see very smart guy. I just can't wait, you know, the result of this match. He's not respecting his elders very well, is he? Use that excuse. Use that excuse. You can talk to anyone. I respect my elders. But not when you're on the opposite side of the arm-wrestling table during the match. Then you're just another opponent. It'll be a fun battle.
Riekerd Bornman: looking forward to it. Yeah, I'd like to see that you get so excited during your matches. That's going to fire me up. But I just hope you get the opportunity to showcase that on the big stage. That's my only hope for you. Just a big ball of fire and all for looks. That's all it is. Yeah, that rage you got. It's just rage. It doesn't translate to power. No worries.
Engin Terzi: Ryan, which one of these athletes we will see first at the Esports West stage again after Chicago? Look, I'm the same age as Wallace. I can relate to him.
Ryan Bowen: time in life and what it would mean to him to win this sort of stuff. So I've seen him beat Marcio and looked good, looked impressive. But I'm probably the biggest believer of all in Rickard Bornman out of out of anyone. He's different. He's really different. And I think that yes, he's the future. When we talk about the future, he's got a long
Ryan Bowen: long prosperous road ahead. But I think he's very much here now as well. So we'll see. We'll see. I think that I, I don't know, I respect anyone who's worthy to get on the East vs West stage, but I think the Rickard Bornman train is just getting warmed up. It's going to go straight through.
Engin Terzi: I really enjoyed this podcast more than what I expected, you know, really, that, that is just both. Both of them are very smart. One is calmer. The other one is so, you know, excited. Uh, of course, when I sit down, I'm talking about records. When I say excited, I'm talking about Wallace. So who do you have? So do I have any, do I have anybody in my corner?
Engin Terzi: Oh, listen, listen. Anyone who has been following me knows that I don't share predictions. I said I'm organized. But Egan sent me a text. He said, Riekerd, don't worry. I've got you an easy opponent. You'll be OK. Win this one, I'll give you the next one. Who sent this? You. I didn't even tell you your opponent. It's Ryan Bournemouth.
Engin Terzi: It's good, it's good. Listen, he's doing, he's doing what I do to my guests, you know, like today I told Artem Morozov, I said, Artem, you know, Artem said, you know, I will do my best and this kind of things. I said, but you told me that you will beat the shit out of Alex Kurdenko. Why you don't tell the history? He never told me that.
Engin Terzi: Richard is doing the same thing to me. That's good, that's good. Yeah, I like it, you know. As long as at the end, you know, everyone knows it's a joke because whenever I do the joke between the actors, it's different. When the organizer is accused for such thing, you know, I just... Sorry. Yeah, yeah. Of course, of course. Yeah, but listen, I only should say my opinion, prediction.
Engin Terzi: when I'm not sure. So this is one of those matches. Because this guy is a special guy and you are also a special guy. Anyone who starts armwrestling 37, 38, and when they come to 41, three years later, he beats one of the best shapes of Marcio Barbosa, cannot be a regular guy. And this guy is also not a normal guy. I just don't know. I haven't really
Engin Terzi: Like, I don't have much to gauge, you know, because you both are very new. And I heard some afterpools about Ricard, you know, with some of the tough guys. But it is not enough for me to say, as I said, I won't be surprised if you win Wallace, and I won't be surprised if Ricard wins. I can see both. I have seen so many things.
Engin Terzi: You know, do you know what? Only the ignorant people are super sure about everything. Super sure. They know everything, you understand? They know. They know. There is nothing that they don't know, you know? But when you know a lot, it means that you have been surprised. You have seen a lot of things that, like, I would, I, like, today I mentioned it. Did you guys watch Michael Todd versus Vitaly Laletin match?
Engin Terzi: Yeah, like when the round one started, it was at the center. You know, everyone was thinking that Laletin was going to go there. Maybe one inch he would be stopped or something. It just stopped at the middle. That was surprise one. But if I would just take a picture of that moment, and you guys are now watching that event live, and I would just say, this just happened after the goal and the match stopped there, you would just tell me Michael is winning that match 3-0.
Engin Terzi: But then we learn something new. The long reach of Vitaly and the grip that when Michael is in this position, he usually climbs. But when the strongest grip in the world is holding you, you don't climb anywhere, you know? And your riser even goes down. So no matter how much you know about armwrestling, you still learn something new.
Engin Terzi: So, I really do not know who is winning well. So, this is not a political answer, but... Okay, let's talk a few of the matches. Because we don't have much time. What time is it there, Ryan, where you are? It's about... Today, it is... Hang on a second. 3 a.m.? 3.20 a.m. Yeah, 3.20 over here, almost 1 a.m.
Engin Terzi: Thank you guys so much for your time, Egan. Thank you, Aaron, so much. That's really nice of you guys. Pleasure. No, no, guys, you, everyone who is coming to East versus West, you guys just deserve it 100%. There is no luck, nothing about just coming to this stage. And so let's start with Wallace. Levan versus Ermes. I still, I think it's Levan, 60-40.
Wallace Dilley: I think maybe Ermes might get a pin. I think he's really come along. He's gotten really strong. But I still got to give it to the king. But will you be surprised? You said 40%. It means that you will not be surprised if somehow Ermes wins that. A lot of people are talking about this could be the one, right? But I still give it to Devon.
Engin Terzi: But imagine if Ermes wins, tomorrow will be, hopefully, listen, like super heavyweight. When the king changes, a lot of things change. And so I think a lot of people want to see this change happening. But some people sometimes ask me, you know, oh, you know,
Engin Terzi: what do you think is the best for armwrestling you know like who wins you know they want me to say if ermez wins is better because some changes but for me i am so much armwrestling like purist guy you know and for me the best thing is the one who deserves winning you know yeah and and uh ricard
Riekerd Bornman: Ingrid, it's really odd. Devon is an incredible athlete. I've never seen anything like it in my entire life. But the thing is, I don't know why, I don't know why, but I truly want Ms. Gasparini to win, you know? That would be nice. That would be nice. But if you look at the facts, Devon is the favourite.
Wallace Dilley: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, we can have opinion about who progressed. Wallace, who do you think have progressed more since their last match? Well, it depends, I guess, what you look at. Some of Ermi's riser and back pressure stuff is incredible, right? But then Devon came out unheard of cheat curl. I mean, no one's ever seen that. That's just unbelievable. But it depends on the style, I guess.
Wallace Dilley: Does a bicep do everything in the match? Maybe a little bit depends on who you ask, right? Todd Hutchins doesn't think a bicep matters. I think if Ermes does win, Devon's not going anywhere. I think he's young enough. He's healthy. He's going to be back. He's going to. He's going to come back even stronger and. And continue to dominate just because Ermes wins. Yeah, it's a big change for everybody, but he's not going to. You know he'll be back.
Wallace Dilley: Do you think Levan is going to ask for an immediate rematch in six months? Probably yes, right? I would imagine so. I wouldn't imagine he'd wait too long. But Levan's different, right? Ermi is special too, but Levan is, I think he's on another level genetically as far as his gift. So I still got to give this one to Levan.
Engin Terzi: And Riekerd, do you agree that Levan Levan Saginashvili is the strongest armwrestler who ever lived? Yes, of course, Engin. There's no doubt about it. And another question. If Ermes beats Levan, does it make Ermes the strongest armwrestler who ever lived or he has to do that a bit more, you know, repeat the success?
Riekerd Bornman: Yeah, I would say so. You can't beat someone who has been undefeated for even a round in six years.
Riekerd Bornman: in one night or one round and think that you will be the best. Yes, it's incredible, but Levan has proven himself to be the best that has ever lived. You have John Brzenk, and it's someone we all look up to, you know? But Levan is just something different. He is built for armwrestling, 100%. Did you ask him my question? My question is, if Ernest beats him, will Ernest become the strongest? No? No. So he has to do that.
Riekerd Bornman: Longer period. Yes, yes. Because Ermes Gasparini has to handle Devon the way Levan handles Devon. If you know what I mean. In that kind of way. You can't beat one guy but lose to another guy. But you'll be the strongest one. Levan beats everyone, you know? Yeah. I think that Levan is the strongest overall out west side.
Ryan Bowen: still, even if he loses to Ermes. I'll explain that in that he's well-roundedness is developed. If we were looking at video game characters and it was points on all the different fundamentals of arm wrestling, I think he has the highest average score. If Ermes defeats Levan, it's because he has one column higher than his probably posting, wrist rise posting, and he manages through technical execution
Ryan Bowen: to make that matter the most. Now, Levan overall is a stronger human. If we're measuring overall capacity here, Levan is, I think, still clearly the overall stronger man. But the overall stronger man doesn't always win the match. And Levan's defending against four or five guys chasing him at the moment. That's the advantage Ermes has.
Ryan Bowen: is that Levan's thinking about defending Devon, about defending Vitaly, about defending Ermes, about defending Michael. He's thinking about all of these things. So he's got to keep his application of strength broad. Ermes is going all in on one thing that he thinks matters most, to beat Levan. So Ermes might beat Levan. I actually think Ermes is going to beat Levan. I think the wrist rise is going to get the job done. But I still think Levan is overall stronger.
Wallace Dilley: And Wallace, Alex Kurdecha versus Devon Larratt. Oh, that's a tough one because I had, I had Corey beating Devon left arm. And Devon's pulling, Devon's pulling Alex left arm, correct? Yeah. Yes. Um, I really, I'm going to go 50 50. Alex is such a monster, not as technical as Devon.
Wallace Dilley: Um, but I do think Devon's left is going to keep rising into the future. I do think he can probably get Alex a hundred percent, but right now I have, I have to say 50, 50. I just had a podcast with Alex. I mean, do you guys know the story? You know, I don't know how to.
Engin Terzi: saying English, but we call like endless. When they came to Spain and with the ships, and they stayed there for 800 years or something. And then when they land there, they saw a huge army. And then their soldiers were scared. So the commander just burned the ships.
Engin Terzi: burning the ships means that no return so now Alex Kurdecha lost a few matches and with left arm he lost like both Morozov and Darikin they were both very tough matches tough opponents for Alex and now
Engin Terzi: I see that Alex burned the bridges. I don't want to go into details, but he burned the bridges, so I don't think he sees this match.
Engin Terzi: any other match. It's not because only seven, but he can't afford to lose three left arm matches in a row. And yes, some people criticize me about his ranking. We will talk about it. Yeah, but that is how the rankings are going. And yeah, maybe. So you're saying there's a lot of a lot of pressure then on Alex. If he doesn't perform, then maybe he'll be dropped down.
Riekerd Bornman: And Ricard, how do you see this match?
Riekerd Bornman: the question and for the first time I couldn't give him a clear answer. The thing is, Alex Cadetro is a monster of a man. It's scary to see him and Devon on the after pool table. But you see at the end of the day, there's always this one little thing that just, Devon just takes it, I don't know how he does it, but I think he's going to get flashed for probably the first two rounds and then he's just going to just
Ryan Bowen: perfectly, and he's going to get into the hand of Alex Kurdecha, and then it's all over. So I think it's probably going to be 3-2, Devon. And Ryan? I think Devon wins. I think Alex Kurdecha is going to be forced to flop press. I think we'll see him flop press early. I think Devon will win centre, but when Alex is fresh, Alex is going to realise the hand's gone, and he's going to bury in. We know that against the Kings move, we've seen the flop press work.
Engin Terzi: I think Alex is a tall man. He's got a big chest, big shoulders. So flop press will work maybe once, maybe twice. But Devon will ultimately win this match. But what makes you think that he would need flop press? This guy is very tall and his left arm is like Alex pulled against two guys that control his pronator. Both Morozov and Dadikyan. This time someone is going against him.
Engin Terzi: And Devon always uses his leverage, how tall he is. So I think that because Alex being even taller, Devon will not have that advantage. I agree with you on that, but I don't think that Devon's pronators is going to drop at all. I don't think he's going to lose his wrist rise either. I think that Devon... No, no, I'm not saying he's going to lose, but why would Alex lose? The reason is I feel like Devon has the, I'll use the term,
Ryan Bowen: the stiffest pronation in the world. I don't know that anyone's pronator is as gnarly as Devon's. I always look at his pronator and watch the way he arm wrestles. It's like he's a tree root. He doesn't, it's, unwinding that man's pronator is, it's incredibly difficult to do. And everyone, so many people crash against that rock and they can't do anything about it. But they can sense that there is a lane
Ryan Bowen: to flop press. I don't know if you've ever practiced with Devon. He always invites it. He always kind of says, look, you're not getting over the top. You should stop trying. And he almost, without words, he convinces his opponents to bury in. And I think that Alex will feel that and go for it. Because I actually think he can get through with it. I think he's big enough and strong enough to get through with the flop press. We saw Kamil Jablonski pressing Devon on left.
Engin Terzi: pretty comfortably. So I think Alex will be remembering that and saying, well, I can do it too. I don't think Alex can do a direct flop press, but Alex may go sideways and then go far side or
Ryan Bowen: you know, Devon's hand, and then maybe on the halfway. If Alex goes direct flop, he's not coming. He's not coming. I will correct to that that what I'm envisaging, yes, is that Alex has more side pressure than Devon, but Devon's pronator just won't go down. So he will take it slightly A-side for Alex in the early rounds.
Ryan Bowen: but then he'll hit the pronator and he'll decide to dump and flop. It's my guess, my guess. I think if he stays high and tries to just ultimately win hand control, he will lose hand control. Vaz, Michael Togo versus Giorgis, I don't know. Got to go with Michael. Being a guy from the US, I look up to Michael. I don't know much about the other guy, unfortunately.
Engin Terzi: But I'll go with my fellow American on this one. Yeah, Dzeranov is one of those guys that you will meet on your way if you ever reach there, you know. You'll never forget Dzeranov once you meet Dzeranov. He's made of stone, Dzeranov. Yeah. And Ricard.
Riekerd Bornman: I think Michael has it. I think Georgii has got to be too excited to get through the arm of Michael, and then he's just going to lose more and more and more. So that's how I hope it's going to go. But yeah, Michael. And now let's go to the last one. I don't want to keep you guys up so long. Morozov versus Kudeshev. Right arm.
Engin Terzi: But first match will be Devon match. Because... Okay, that's interesting. Yeah, Kurdecha wanted to pull Devon first. He said it's more important match for him. And let's start with Morozov. Yeah, I gotta go with Devon. No, no, no, no. I think Morozov versus Kurdecha. Oh, Morozov and Kurdecha. And this is right arm.
Wallace Dilley: I'd go with, uh, I'll probably have to go with Moore's off on this one. Um, he's came off an injury, correct? On the left or right arm. No, no. And his left arm is injured. This is right arm mesh. Left arm, Alex is pulling Devon, right arm is pulling Morozov. So I, I'd go with, um, definitely have to go with Moore's off on this one. He's just a freak of nature. He's one of those genetic specimens. Um, so I have to go with him.
Engin Terzi: Have you seen his match with Vitaly Laletin in Tbilisi? I'm sure I did. He stopped him like one inch from the pad. And he was screaming, yeah. Oh, right. Right, right. I remember seeing that, yes. Ryan, what did you feel when you saw that moment? I am still amazed because I was right there by the stage.
Ryan Bowen: a few meters away, and he was screaming, like, ah... He was saying, come on, Vitaly, come on, Vitaly. What's that? Where Morozov was yelling out, come on, Vitaly, come on, Vitaly. Yeah, yeah, don't worry, don't worry. Yeah, he was saying, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I mean, that was instantly an iconic moment in the match, but unfortunately for Morozov, it didn't end up as iconic as it could be because Vitaly won the match, ultimately. Had Morozov won,
Ryan Bowen: then it would have been solidified as an all-time epic moment. It was still an epic moment. And it did shock us because we all, everyone had Vitaly Laletin as the overall favorite. And to do it fairly easily, people thought. So Morozov certainly showed that he's there. Ford me, Morozov is one of those guys that when I look at arm wrestlers, I always categorize them as kind of joint-based arm wrestlers or muscular-based arm wrestlers.
Ryan Bowen: And Morozov is extremely up the end of muscular base. Like his bicep development is phenomenal. I've never seen a bicep on anyone like, you know, I remember when he was in Dubai and he pulled, was it Camille? His bicep looked just extraordinary. I've never seen anything quite like it. So Morozov's muscular strength, I put above that of Kurdecha.
Ryan Bowen: But Kadesha is a very talented arm wrestler when it comes to using the geometry of his bones. He pivots off his elbow very nicely to create pronation into the hand without fatiguing his muscles. He uses his joints very well, Kadesha. So I think Kadesha is a slightly more joint-based arm wrestler, and that tends to have some longevity in it. When you're a joint-based arm wrestler, you can kind of last a little bit longer. You say Kadesha is more joint-based?
Engin Terzi: I think it is just more joint-based. Not with right arm. Not with right arm for sure. Right arm is just pure outside. Just remember this matches with right arm. The way he pivots off is over. Remember his right arm matches with Ongar Bey when Krasimir top-rolled him. But he got beat. Yeah, yeah. So left arm, he can go inside, side.
Ryan Bowen: What I mean by joint, though, is top roll, but he doesn't use his raw bicep with cup to then roll it. He really pivots down on his tricep and uses the leverage. Okay, you are not talking about pressure type of joints. You're talking about the, yeah, okay, I understand. I'm talking about wrist joints and rising joints. He uses that very well. And I think that Morozov is going to be the man attacking. I think that
Ryan Bowen: The cadet is just going to have to triangulate his bones to get a stop. I think he will. I think he will. I think he'll get a stop. But I still don't know who's going to win. It's going to be a hard-fought battle. I think they're ultimately very even, these two. And Ricard? I think Morozov is just too strong, Engen. That young man is incredible as well. I can see him being the world champion as well.
Engin Terzi: with right arm at some point? Left arm I would say, but right arm... Left arm he was champion and he is the permanent holder of the belt. A few people has that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. He hasn't lost against Laletin, but once he heals up, I would love to see them pulling again.
Riekerd Bornman: Yes. That was an incredible match. Just the way he stopped him and shouted at him. Incredible. But I think he has it, Ingen. I think he's gonna... Because the thing is, it's so hard. Because like you said, Alex is a pure top roller, you know? And Morozov has a really strong containment and lock. And if you get that on a top roller, it's really hard for that guy to get out of it, you know? So that's probably why I'm giving it to Morozov.
Engin Terzi: I will just say one thing, that's my opinion. I think, I don't know who is going to win, Morozov or Alex. Alex or Devon, left arm and right arm. But I think that we will see a shape of Alex that we haven't seen before. As I mentioned, I think he burned the ships, you know, no returning. That's what he realizes and I won't be surprised
Engin Terzi: if Alex does something great over there. I won't be surprised. I'm not saying he will do it, but if he does it, I will be just saying, uh, I saw that coming. But who knows? A lot of people thought that he was favorite against Jerry, and Jerry just won dominantly. Time will show. Wallace, do you have... I want to ask you one more thing before we finish, Wallace. Like, how important is this?
Wallace Dilley: for you to go on that stage and cool? It's a chance of a lifetime, honestly, Ingen. I mean, this is something I found three or so years ago that I've really become passionate about. I'm kind of built to do it. And so to be on the biggest stage in the world is number one, man. And I appreciate the opportunity.
Engin Terzi: No opportunity. You just went that qualification, you beat everyone and you got it with your own power. So we thank you very much for coming to our stage and being, you know, one of our superstars and
Engin Terzi: I'm very, very happy whenever Ricard send me a message and then he was just trying to convince me and he did that how important it was for him. And then whenever I see, like sometimes I get also, like I lose motivation and something else. And whenever I see this, what we do,
Engin Terzi: is very, very important for these people, you know, and then like it just motivates me. Like, you understand, because I was also at his age, I also had my dreams and everything. And whenever I see these burning passion, you know,
Engin Terzi: And then I'm like, yeah, that, that, that anyone who is wanting, like for me as super, super star guy, but he's just kind of satisfied. You understand? Like, like it just doesn't really excite me. I'm sensitive to see that guy. I'm not talking specifically for anyone. Like whenever I see like UFC, John Jones,
Engin Terzi: The guy is just like all the time, like he's not accepting to fight the, what's the guy, Tom Aspinall or what's his name? Yeah, so he's just a guy doesn't have much fire left with him. I'm not saying that he's a legend. He's a legend. Not much. Whenever you look at it, it doesn't excite you so much. And then whenever I see the other guys burning, you know, just set me, you know, I'm ready, you know, that, that it just, as a promoter, like it really excites me. I'm like,
Riekerd Bornman: You know, we need to set matches for these guys, you know. And you have any last words for your opponent, for your fans, for anyone in regards? Yes, I do, Ingun. I'm just going to speak in my native language. Everyone in South Africa, thank you so much for the support you've given me. Mom and Dad, I love you so much, I love you so much. I'm going to make you proud.
Riekerd Bornman: And then Wallace, I want to thank you for accepting this opportunity. I want you to know that I'm coming 110% ready. This is probably the biggest achievement in my life to be given this opportunity. I'm going to use 100% of it. And I want you to know that I respect you as an athlete.
Riekerd Bornman: But it's going to be 110% from my side, and I expect the same from your side. Let's see who's the best and who's going to carry the name forward. And Wallace, your last words to the fans, to your opponents? Yeah, right back to you, Rycord. I'm going to come 100%.
Wallace Dilley: You're going to do big things for sure, and I'm excited to pull you. I want to give a big shout out to my teammates who've got me ready. The Nebraska high risers and repping the shirt right here. I'm sure they're all watching, but thank you to them. That's why I'm here. They've motivated me. They've helped me train. Big thanks to my wife for putting up with all this dedication that I do, but. Yeah, I'm going to be coming in strong. Thank you for the opportunity again
Engin Terzi: I'll see you gentlemen in Chicago. So I want to ask you one more thing while I was in Nebraska, you know, Mary. Yeah. Mary McConaughey, you know her in person. Yep. I have met her. Yep. Yeah. Yeah. She was probably the best promoter in around that, you know, region, you know? Yeah. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: World champion also in the... Yeah, I was gonna say one of the best, best females to ever do it as well. Yeah, for sure. Have you ever heard her tournament, Paul for the Hungry? I think I have heard of that, yeah. Paul for the Hungry, yeah. She had it every year, yeah. I don't know how many... I lived around that region and I don't know how many... Like, you know Jerry Jennings? Yeah, I know Jerry.
Engin Terzi: Jerry is from Omaha? I think, I don't know. Omaha, Nebraska? Yeah, he's from Omaha. Yeah, Jerry is another legend, you know. I grew up by just, you know, watching them. Yeah. And there was a lot of actors from around that. I don't know if Patrick Burr, if he's from that area or not, but you ever heard Tom New? Tom New or not?
Wallace Dilley: Yes. Actually, I've arm wrestled Tom, yeah. Yeah? Is he still around? Wow, I didn't know that. You know, when I first got into the sport, he was kind of around. I'd see him at tournaments, but it's been a couple of years. I don't know if he had some injuries or what, but I haven't seen him for a while at anything local. Yeah, very tall guy, top-level. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Anyways, and Ryan.
Ryan Bowen: Arsen you going to be part of the event? Yeah, I'm going to be doing the pre-match interviews, post-match interviews, a bit of commentating. I'm very excited, I'm pulling the East vs West Open tournament on the Friday night. And I'm coming in real big, real big. Right now my weight would be 238-240, so I'm like...
Engin Terzi: I don't know if I want to cut down to the 231s. I'll probably just pull the 253s so I don't have to do a water cut. But I mean, I'm really excited to pull the tournament. I think 231 would be better for you. Just a little bit of water cut is OK. Listen, you came to Istanbul. Yes. Like on the video, you seem like you lost to a lot of people. But the first guy that you pull fresh, Efe, just won the Europeans right and left arm. There you go.
Engin Terzi: There you go. Right arm, left arm, he won the Europeans and he kind of dominated, you know. Yeah. And so remember, whenever I told you that, like, listen, like, it looks like, you know, you're losing. And this other guy, the next guy you pull, Ozan Kosciuszko. Yeah, he won as well, yeah. Yeah, he also won 110 kilo, 242 Europeans. So those guys over there were not really like... Truly, Engin, I'm in my best physical shape.
Ryan Bowen: I'm very excited to see what I can do on the table at the moment. We'll see. I haven't pulled a tournament in a long time. I've had a lot of supermatches, but I have no idea who's going to be in the draw in Chicago. But I imagine a lot of people are going to be there because the event is such a big event with LeBron and RMS headlining it. Just do your best. And, you know, like as you said, you know, like the
Engin Terzi: like sometimes draw some tough match tournament is subject to anything, anything. I remember competing one of the WAF and beating the number one guy
Engin Terzi: but ending up ninth. And then the guys that I beat were like fifth, sixth, and first. And then when the final, they were asking, you know, it was Daniel Prokopchik. I beat him, sent him B-side. And he finally came and beat Mindaugas twice. And then people were like, who sent Daniel to B-side? I was like 20 kilo from 90 to 70.
Engin Terzi: just like didn't really much left endurance but first three matches i won and the next two i lost anyways guys it was great it was great i will be watching this match very very closely very this is just under my radar and and then i just as soon as this match finishes the first thing i will do
Engin Terzi: Who should I set the winner against? Thank you guys and thanks to everyone who has been watching us. Take care, good luck, stay healthy.
