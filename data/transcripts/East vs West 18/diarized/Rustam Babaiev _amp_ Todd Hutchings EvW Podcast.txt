Engin Terzi: Hello, hello, hello, Pavlo. Hello. How are you? Who else is here? Oh, Todd is here. Hello, Todd. Howdy. Hey, Todd. Good? I'm good. Great. Somehow Todd is always good. That's a fact.
Engin Terzi: Let's see, we are waiting for Rustam and then we can start. Let me share the link on Facebook. So Todd, did you tell me that Rustam is your hero? Rustam's my hero. Yeah, he has been.
Engin Terzi: Is that because of his winning record against you or his general career? I like it when the little guys go out and scare the big guys. So you see yourself? I don't think I scare people, but I do keep them interested. I don't know. I remember you beating David Randall and Cleve Dean in the same event.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, that was fun. Yeah, it was interesting. And I'm not sure if you were this heavy. I think at that time you were around like 200 pounds. Yeah, about 200 pounds. Yeah. How is everything going, Pavlo? Everything is fantastic. Everything is very good. Almost healed, started training. Yeah, I see you lately very strong. I don't know.
Engin Terzi: You do some trainings and those numbers are crazy numbers. The other day I saw that that's a very hard thing to do. You were like holding the weight like there wasn't dumbbell. When you have the weight down here and up here, it's easier. But when all of them is down there, it needs like incredible grip power. Yeah, now my grip is okay. Yeah, yeah. Did you see that, Todd?
Todd Hutchings: Yeah, it was like a big pipe, right? Yeah. Yeah. You are not so big fan of curling, Todd. Say again? You are not a fan of bicep or hammer or... I think if you need to add that to your arm wrestling routine, your arm wrestling routine needs to be re-evaluated. Look at that.
Todd Hutchings: That's not a bad bicep for somebody who doesn't do any curls. Huge. Because you train that also during the table practice probably in a static way. If you arm wrestling hit your biceps, if you're training on a table with either a pulley or bands or something, your biceps are getting hit all the time. But do you think that this being static only, do you think there is a problem with this?
Engin Terzi: I think you compete static only. I mean, because our arm is created to work this way, and you are only this. Do you think that some dynamics would help? Maybe it would support or...
Todd Hutchings: Myself, I think if you threw bicep volume on top of your arm wrestling routine, you're just, one thing is you're doing work, you're spending time doing something that could probably pay off better. And second, you're probably overworking those muscles, you know.
Todd Hutchings: Which muscles do you think that you are not working enough at the table that you need to do in gym training or whatever you call it? I think you should train your rear shoulders, your upper shoulders, probably your triceps some, your core, lower back, abs, that kind of stuff. That's what you do? Yeah. That would be the stuff I do that's not specifically arm wrestling specific. That would be the stuff I would do to balance all that out.
Engin Terzi: No, no, what I'm just saying that other than table time, you also have specific training, right? With the weights. Yes, but it's all like... When you say that when you do the bicep dynamic and also at the table, you are overdoing it. So do you think that everything outside of the table is specifically trained? It's not overdoing it? You think that you are not training them at the table? Well, remember, my workout is actually done on a table as well. So I'm not in a gym.
Todd Hutchings: doing you know traditional as a table time you consider as a table time i'm on the tape yeah i practice three times a week but my workouts my 12 to or my 10 to 14 workouts a week are also on pulleys on a table you know so i'm training in arm wrestling positions but do you consider them same as the table training uh
Todd Hutchings: i don't count table training as part of training to me that's just like scrimmaging and skills and stuff so like my workouts are i only consider the actual weight weight time as training okay hello hello hello hello hello how are you thank you good good how are you good good good thank you thank you
Pavlo Derbedyenyev: I just told Rustam that I will help as necessary and Rustam says, yes, I will need some. It's not on the level where I can freely speak. Yeah, yeah. And how long have you been in England, Rustam?
Rustam Babaev: Rustam, how long have you been in England? How long have I been in England? Well, it's been two and a half years. Two and a half years. Two and a half years. Oh, okay. That's good, that's good, yeah. So, Rustam, one more time, huh? You and Tata, I think. One more time. He says, one more time. Now it's you and Tata again. Yeah, yeah. I know, I know. I need...
Rustam Babaev: Hi, Todd. Howdy. Howdy. How are you? I'm doing well. And yourself? Happy Easter. Happy Easter. Yes, yes. So how do you feel, Rustem? How do you feel? One more time. Look at Todd is already always taking the notes.
Engin Terzi: It gets on my nerves, you know. You are like, he's not relaxed. He's just all time calculating. Let's see what he will ask. He said he's gonna have some questions. Rustem, how do you feel this time? 2005, 86 kilos, low teacher, finale. And now in Poland, a supermatch, and this is the third time. Do you expect, and also, can you make your phone sideways, if possible?
Rustam Babaev: Do you think you are in top shape now? Sorry? Do you think you are in top shape now? Do you think you are in top shape now?
Engin Terzi: Yes, yes. Yes? Okay. Wow, that will be interesting. I want belt, I want belt. You want the belt? Oh, okay. Okay. And Rustem, what do you think that changed with Tata Sings since last time? I'm sure you have been following him.
Engin Terzi: He doesn't really follow other people except the person he's going to pull. So he probably checks some of your matches, right, Todd? Oh, yeah. Especially his East vs. West matches. Yeah. So what do you think, Rustem? What changed with Todd Hutchings? Do you see any stylistic change since last time to now? I prepared all parts for this pulling, but...
Rustam Babaev: I have a plan and I think Todd too has a plan. Of course, of course. He's still planning. This game is like chess. Yes, yes. Ford it, it's interesting.
Engin Terzi: Yes, yes. But that's what I'm asking. What do you think that changed? Maybe I'm not explaining good, but, Pavlo, like, what changed his style with Tad? I think, yes, yes. I think he prepared for me special, you know.
Rustam Babaev: I know. What do you think? He's going to try top roll or hook or side pressure? What do you think? I think he has... I see. I look at his matches and I see special... I see he has higher side.
Rustam Babaev: Yeah, pronation side. Do you think he will try this to you? I know this situation, special preparation for it. Okay.
Rustam Babaev: Interesting, interesting for me all. So you are ready for everything? I have a form like this first time. What do I hear? Todd? Yes, sir. What do you know, guys? Okay, Todd, you say. He looks very confident. He has never been in this shape.
Engin Terzi: And now we know that you are at your best shape. And the other day, somebody said like Todd is planning like five to 10 years more. And then, and Pauline said that he wouldn't be surprised, you know, if you still have a world title match when you are 68 and everyone agrees that you are, you are in your best and you are still progressing. Do you agree with that Todd?
Todd Hutchings: uh yeah yeah i'm definitely making improvements i mean i can compare where i'm at come from where i was so yeah but i i mean i expect everybody's getting better i mean if you're training and not getting better you need to change your training right because who's training and not improving so
Todd Hutchings: Yeah, but don't you think that we all have limits at some point? That improvement can be very little, you know? Yeah, but the improvements only have to be little once you're high, right? When you're starting out, the improvements are big. Even if here's your limit, as long as you're still getting better, you know, that's all that really matters. Rustam, if you don't understand something, slow down and I'll help you. No, no, no, thanks.
Engin Terzi: Okay, so Rustam said that he has never been this good. And to hear that, does it make you nervous? I've never won and I've never been on the winning side. I've been nervous since 2005. I got no reason to feel good. So is he going to take your belt?
Engin Terzi: No, no. I think I own this one. Yeah. I think I'll have to pull a rackly like five more times for it, but I think I own this belt. Okay. You want only 195 kilo title, right? Correct. This will be my first defense. Okay. But listen, I made the rule and I said, you need to win the belt three times, the title match to own it.
Engin Terzi: But in your category, but I just think that it doesn't have to be in your category. I mean, really, I'm just thinking if you win the world title, you win the world title. So it means that you have already two. I've won two world titles, and I have zero belts. Yeah, yeah, but you need to, if you win one more, then yeah, yeah. Rustem, Paul says that you are not getting the belt. I know.
Pavlo Derbedyenyev: say that i would also say that in his place he can't say anything else rustam saying yeah yeah i know i would say the same thing if i would be in his shoes he cannot say anything different than that absolutely okay and and how close is the the reality by saying that you're not getting the belt me no no i'm asking rustam
Rustam Babaev: How close you are to reality when you say that he's not getting the belt? I'm asking Rushtam. Still in the pot? I think just the table shows that. I don't know. I don't know what is form, what is shape. I don't know all things.
Engin Terzi: But I know my things just enough for me. Okay. Okay. Let's see. And Todd, he thinks that you are going to do pronated side pressure, which you have been doing. And then whenever I talk with Pauline, he said that you guys like have been in touch and he sounded like
Engin Terzi: Like he said, he felt Rustam's hand super strong when he tried to go outside. So I kind of felt like you're preparing something more like
Todd Hutchings: this, am I wrong? You don't have to say it. You can even deceive me with your answer. No problem. I won't deceive you, but normally when you have me on these, I tell you exactly how I'm going to pull somebody. Yeah. I'm not telling you this time. Two people know what I'm going to do. I got two training partners. They know what I'm going to do. And neither one of them are on this podcast. Okay. Okay. Rustem, did you understand what he said?
Pavlo Derbedyenyev: Do you understand what he's saying? Yes, 50-50. I'll quickly translate it for you. Engin asked, how are you going to fight him? He's a bit of an outsider. Engin says, I have a feeling that you're preparing for something inside. Tad says, I've always told the truth on every podcast and told you how I'm going to fight, and that's exactly how I fought.
Pavlo Derbedyenyev: But this time I can't say anything. Only two people, my training partners, know. And they are not here, so no one will tell anyone anything. That's the secret. This is professional level.
Engin Terzi: But he was not this professional against other opponents. He was sharing, but this time he's not sharing. It just means that it takes you really, you know, highly. And Rustem, are you going to share with us what you are planning?
Rustam Babaev: My plan? Winner. Just win. This is my plan. I have different techniques and I use different techniques. It depends on the situation. Do you think that Todd's pronator is enough to take your wrist?
Pavlo Derbedyenyev: I don't know. We show it.
Engin Terzi: We will see. I have a question. You said that you pulled this guy two different times and you lost. Does it have any psychological effect on you from your memory? Arsen you going there with no effect what happened in the past? Like a reborn, newborn guy, there was some other life, you know?
Todd Hutchings: Now I'm totally different. Or do you have anything negative from that time to this time mentally? Nothing negative. I'm not looking for revenge or anything. I don't mind my losses to him because he was way better than I was back then. I think I'm better now than I was. And I think there's this much chance I'm better than him now.
Todd Hutchings: So that's what I'm going into. But can I ask you something? This much is, what is the total? This much? Oh, so you are saying that only... But I only need that much more. So if the match is this big and we start at 50-50, I only need this much out of this much to sway it, you know?
Todd Hutchings: Is the match starting in 50-50? If I get this much and good reps, I'll be in good shape. Is the match starting with the 50-50 if we judge by the past? I think so. I think if you're in the top four or five of any of these weight classes, I think all the matches start at 50-50. Because everybody's aware of what everybody else does. Everybody's made adjustments. Everybody's had three months to train.
Todd Hutchings: so i you know i think you start i think every i think if you take the top three people in every weight class it starts at 50 50 and your training and luck sways it one way or another and and how much was like do you think was the difference uh when you pulled him last time
Todd Hutchings: do you think that he was i think he was that much better than me out of this much oh really do you think it was that much of a difference the best i ever did against him was my very first match somehow in our second match i did worse so i trained for five years and got worse so that's you know my best chance ever was our very first round so
Pavlo Derbedyenyev: Give me just 30 seconds or 20 seconds. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Rustam, he asks, how do you assess your chances? He says, you come to the table, you lost twice, you come to the table with some fear from the previous times, or maybe some negativity, or no. He says, no, there's no negativity, there's experience.
Pavlo Derbedyenyev: He said, yes, I lost, yes, there were gaps. He said, the first time it seemed like they fought a little better on my part. The second time, in general, he said,
Pavlo Derbedyenyev: foreign foreign
Pavlo Derbedyenyev: Rustam commented that sport is sport and that's exactly what we are doing to see if that will be enough or still not. And I have a question for Rustam.
Engin Terzi: Do you think that the difference was, like, as much as Todd said, like, between you and him when you pulled last time in a super match? Do you think that it was as comfortable for you as Todd thinks?
Rustam Babaev: Last time I feel big difference. Big difference? Yes. But I think maybe thought not good will was preparation. I feel this, but I don't know. Maybe. Okay. Yeah. Now, just to go back a bit, about the 50-50. Yeah.
Todd Hutchings: Rustem's match with Rockley went three to two. Okay, but Rustem turned Rockley in three separate times. He pinned him twice. One of those times he got called back on a foul. Had that foul not happened, Rustem would have won that before Rockley won the last match.
Engin Terzi: That's how close that match was. When you said that he pinned him three times. He pinned him twice. No, no, no. He turned inside three times, pinned him twice. Oh, okay, but the three times you said he got him, that round ended with Irakli winning or Rustam winning? Rustam turned Irakli inside three times, pinned him twice. The third time he had him inside and he got called on a foul. And then who won that round?
Engin Terzi: Rockley did. Okay, so because if he turned him in and he got a foul and started again, he beat him, then it's a different story because he lost the rounds when the buckle was on his hand. I don't know how much it made difference, but there was something like that at that time. But only thing I know that
Engin Terzi: I think it was Rustam's comeback match after he tore his chest. So in his head, whenever I talked with him before the match, he said, Engin, like, I am still not sure, you know, I'm a little bit like not comfortable. In the training, yes, but the competition is a different thing. So I am sure since that time you got better, Irakli got better, Rustam got better. But I think that, Rustam, now do you have any fear with your chest or everything is okay?
Engin Terzi: No, I feel good. Even psychologically, everything is good, right? Yes, yes, yes. And what's your weight now, Rustam? Ninety-eight plus minus. Ninety-eight. I'm ninety-five. You are ninety-five? Wow, I thought you were cutting weight to make ninety-five.
Engin Terzi: I'm just naturally 95. I was overeating to make the 105s. 95 is where I'm at. Most of the matches you came to Istanbul, you were like 100 kilos or something, even when you pull 105 kilos. You were lighter than your opponents. So you are not going to lose any power, nothing. You are at your weight. My power is going up.
Pavlo Derbedyenyev: Your power is going up. I don't know how much people realize, but this is a very, very important match. Pavlo, how do you see this match? This is my favorite. I'm waiting for it, definitely. I never pulled Rustam, but I've been following him since, I don't know, 2001, probably, too. And Tad, we never pulled officially, but we did...
Pavlo Derbedyenyev: practice uh pulling a little bit and uh it's uh i don't know i am not predicting this match based on what happened uh before uh rustam is slight favorite but after i touched uh todd's arm uh i i'm not betting against that too so it's it's to me it's very interesting match it's just i i want to see it i cannot predict one or another winner
Engin Terzi: Yeah, that's very interesting. And I just don't know. Yeah, Todd said that normally he would say his plan, but this time he's not saying, except two people. No one knows. And Todd, the matches that you lost, we talked this before, but were against the people who control your pronator. Prudnik first match and then...
Engin Terzi: I don't count Hajim Razolev, he beat you, but at that time you were still, you know, like you were not going to step as you do now. So when I say I don't count it, I'm not saying I don't count as a loss, but it was not the thought style that we see today. So, and when do you think that you became like more like outside? Do you think that after you lost against Prudnik?
Todd Hutchings: Um, I think it was when my boss started making me pull these 105 kilogram top rollers three times a year. So I had to learn how to pull outside. Listen, if you are pulling at the East versus West stage, you need to be ready for everyone if you have big dreams.
Engin Terzi: So I got ready. I realized that you have big dreams. Whenever I remember, I asked you, I asked him, do you want Matushenko or this, I don't know, you want to pull at the very beginning of these first risks? And he is like, which one is stronger? I said, probably this, I don't know, because now he's super heavyweight, you know, give me that one. And then I said, okay, this is another crack one, you know, and that's how it should be.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, but whenever you pulled against Jordan Sonev, you were still pulling inside. Either he hooked you or you wanted to pull inside. Yeah. So, if you started to pull in such a way after your Prudnik match, then we can say that after that one, your only loss was against Dariken. Yeah.
Todd Hutchings: The things I have to fix to pull that again is what I fixed to pull Rustam. Okay. Okay. First time he's going inside. It don't count if you beat Rustam outside. That don't count. That's chicken shit. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: okay yeah i was very very surprised i was very surprised what what i learned that day against dadikyan one is that dadikyan's hand is very very strong that you could manage to go to strap and two like it was very surprising that you caught him and bring him to the losing position and him to manage
Engin Terzi: the win from that point, it was very, I kind of think that it is because you started to pull outside, outside, outside. Maybe your inside game maybe wasn't as good as it used to be, or I don't know. How do you see that? What is the analyzing of that? You've got three weeks to find out. I told you I'm not telling you. I didn't change my mind just because we've been talking for five minutes.
Rustam Babaev: Okay. Rustam says he won't admit it, because we talked for five minutes. He says, I still won't admit what I've changed and how I'm going to fight. I know, I understand what he might have on his mind. A couple of different techniques, I understand what can be done. The other won't work. Well, this and that may not work. I myself don't understand now how much
Rustam Babaev: My strength behind the table. I don't even understand, because my strength indicators have changed on the scales, it turns out on the free scales. And I myself am interested in how it will look on the table. I'm just loaded now, and I can't see it. When I get fresh, then it will be different.
Pavlo Derbedyenyev: Rustam is saying that, yeah, I understand everything, basically. And I know that there is a few options which most likely not going to use and which may work. And it's not exactly the fact that they're going to work.
Pavlo Derbedyenyev: because he said, I don't even know which level I am at right now, because he's still training and he's loaded completely. So basically he's not recovered. So he does not understand how much this will transfer to the table, but working weights are insane. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Anyway, so Todd, you had some questions.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, I got a few. Is now a good time? Do you want to ask Ruslan? Oh, I want to. They're mostly for you. This guy always puts stress. He started doing this habit last time. Last time he did this and now every podcast he started. I asked him, just give me already in advance the questions so I can prepare. He said, ah, they're not that serious. Let's see. We will see how serious they are.
Engin Terzi: Okay. So before the last event, I forgot who was being interviewed, but your new commentator said all the matches start in a ref grip. Is that for this event too? No. I mean, if last event in Arlington, we did it. Okay. I will explain to you. I was suggested to start every match in strap.
Engin Terzi: And I said, nope, that is going to harm the origin of arm wrestling because of a few reasons. Because strap is needed when the hands slip. And the second of all, the matches with and without strap sometimes results change. Like if every match was in strap in 2015, Devon probably would beat John that day.
Engin Terzi: In Atlantic City, I think two rounds that Corey West beat Tobias was in strap and four rounds that Tobias won was without strap. And people think that this gives... I know you like this kind of...
Engin Terzi: you know, numbers and everything, or examples. Yeah, analyzing, I should say. And there are, they think that it saves some time. It may save, but there are so many examples I can show you that the matches ended without a strap. And putting a strap sometimes takes near a minute, you know. Like it was tight or no, oh, can you put again and things like that. Just, like for example, Ali Can versus Ivan Matushenko, zero rounds strap, as far as I know.
Engin Terzi: Levan versus Jerry, no round was in strap. And Rustam versus Sandrys, I think only one round strap, I think. And anyway, so... Rustam, do you understand? No, there was a strap three or four times. No, wait, it was three times. Sandrys, right? Yes, one time without a strap. But you understand everything they say. Yes, yes, yes. Okay.
Pavlo Derbedyenyev: There's no need for translation, just make sure that he understands the conversation. He said that there were few rounds with Strap and Sandry. No, I just watched the match. I don't know, I saw only one round. It was 4-0.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, I don't think there was a few rounds. You can check after the match. I saw he was just jumping and you were hooking him, yeah, and then beating him. Anyway, so then they said, how about the referee's grip? And then we finally decided that first round will not be referee's grip, automatic referee's grip. We will let Atlas to get their grip.
Engin Terzi: And if they can get the grip, and then second round also, no referee's grip. If they still do it, and then the third round. And then all rounds can go without. But once in either round, if it is going to referee's grip, and then we continue doing the referee's grip. If they cannot get their grip at some point, and then the later rounds, we do. Do you have any different...
Engin Terzi: because I care about your opinions. No, that's great. If you do that, that's perfect. Yeah. Okay, another question? Yeah, so how do the refs get assigned to the matches? Because you have like four or five refs. Yeah, there is, okay. Allen the referees know which match they are going to ref. You can ask them.
Engin Terzi: only like one minute or two minutes before the event before that referees don't know which match i do whatsapp group and then right the announcing of neil starts i sent to the whatsapp group and then they found it they found out you know which match they are a referee and the main thing is that the referee doesn't ref their countrymen the only exception is that american referees are
Engin Terzi: Rafi American matches when the event is in US. And there are so many American pullers and many matches that American referees ref American. But other than that, over here people do generalize. They they say.
Engin Terzi: Or Eastern referees. There is nothing Eastern referee. We say East versus West just to hype the arm wrestling competition. Ford the referees, there is no East, there is no West. You know, like when a German referee, which you count as an East, is refereeing a Kazakhstan guy has nothing to do with each other. Or a Bulgarian guy is refereeing a Japanese guy, like has nothing to do, just because they are from the East.
Engin Terzi: so basically in the east there is no referee that wraps his countryman match but only happens with the american reps like many times after uh americans matches when the event is is in u.s so it is very hard you know okay not to make them meet each other i still try i still try
Engin Terzi: a third country ref yeah and then um before you go another question dino says rustam's hand and arm look like brick wall and arm fella says are you tired from yesterday's training rustam they're asking you are you tired from the yesterday's training
Rustam Babaev: uh yes yes i tired the last two weeks yes okay okay any more questions todd i would like to answer oh yeah one more um but just for the right i love the two refs that i had for the iraqli match so i'll take them every single time
Todd Hutchings: Those refs ought to get a promotion, just so you know. They should be like executive refs. Why is that? Because they called that match perfect. They called all the fouls that needed to be called, and the little ones that didn't count, they let go. So that's the way all refs should be.
Engin Terzi: Listen, I already promised Irakli that winner of you guys, unless you guys have something against it, Irakli is going to take. I think the biggest problem was the lighting. It was very, very dark. I don't know how that happened, but yes, there was some. Yes, you are the official winner of that match and nothing to take away from you.
Engin Terzi: But yeah, there was some things, you know, and Irakli was upset about it. He said that, Engin, I don't want to make a post about it, but maybe when I'm your guest, you know, like I can challenge Todd or Rustam. I said, do you want to pull Todd again? Or you want to pull a title match? He said, I want to pull a title match. He said, I don't care about Todd. He said, I want my belt back. Oh, he cares.
Todd Hutchings: But he said if Rustam wins, he wants to pull Rustam, not you. Oh, he still wants to pull me even if Rustam wins. Okay, okay, okay. So this is what everybody wants to know. One more question. Yep. So you're training again to get back into competition. Oh, yeah. It's an easy question. Tell me. Easy question. My question is, are you still training the way you used to? Or do you got a new training and new plans? Because arm wrestling is different than when you used to compete.
Engin Terzi: Arm wrestling is not different. Arm wrestling is different, boss. I never ever trained arm wrestling by looking at other guys and how I can beat them. I always look at arm wrestling by human anatomy. You understand? The Latvians do that. Huh? The Latvians do that. I don't know what they do. I know that some of them...
Engin Terzi: used to come and learn from me uh in my city but um what i just said it i i don't really care i don't really care i mean like i don't think unless you are alex oak you or we all basically like maybe taller arm shorter arm and yeah there is such difference but other than that i don't know any human being that have
Engin Terzi: different muscle groups than what we all have. So if you know how to counter each muscle group, then you are okay. I don't think, did anything change with the anatomy of human in last a few years? I don't think so.
Engin Terzi: the anatomy is the same the strengths are different so you need to get just the old ways belong in the old days i'm telling i'm just trying to help you out boss okay now you listen to me i won my first world title in early 90s they said oh it was easy there and then i won world titles in the second half of the 90s they said oh it was 90s and then i won the world title in the early 2000s
Engin Terzi: And then the second half of the 2000s, I won the world title again. And then they said, oh, it was 2000. And then 2000, middle of 2000, 2010, I won again world title.
Engin Terzi: End of the 2010, again, I won the world title, okay? And so I don't know what has changed. Like, I can bring 2006 John here, and he would probably beat the shit out of every single guy, you know, probably except a few in the Super Heavyweights. Did you saw the smile on Todd's face? No, Todd doesn't know what he's talking about. I saw that, Todd. He knows it, he knows it. Were you in that competition 2006, Vegas?
Engin Terzi: What's that? In 2006 Vegas when John and Farid pulled, but John was pulling two categories. That was when who smashed into Travis? Somebody smashed into Travis hard and actually surprised him. But I was there when John pulled. Farid Osman just hook him and beat him easy. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: Yeah. I don't know. I don't know. Yeah. I mean, just, I will just, I don't really, I mean, I just think that there are more people, more people like top bowlers, but there are, there, there were some people who were ahead of their time, Todd, you believe or not. There were some people that were ahead of their time. And I think, I think like some things are up to the understanding of those, those people understanding,
Engin Terzi: Oh, those people. Yeah. I mean, when did I, I mean, 2021, I beat Viorel Dobrin 5-0. A few months later, he won the Waffles in 85 kilo. Like, you were there when I pulled Arthur. Like, if bicep wasn't torn, it was coming, you know. So, just, like, I don't know if I can do it. I'm not, like, strong as, like, genetically as you are. You are different. When I look at you, I don't know what to think.
Engin Terzi: Outside of the table, when I look at you, I look at him, I look at his arms. I mean, no, I mean, I don't see anything special. But when he comes to the table. It's all up here, boss. I'm telling you. Whenever I look at their opponents, like I know how good they are. Either this guy is paying them some money.
Engin Terzi: to be in those positions or this guy is something special. Of course, the first thing I said was joke, but this guy, I mean, just look at like the things that he has been doing. So you are real deal, you know? So I don't think I can do just because every time I say I'm 50 years old, they say, oh, but look at Pat Hussings, you know, just, just, just, you are being a bad example, you know? Yeah. I'm just telling you, training's different now than it was five years ago.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, but some people are just figuring out. Some people already knew. Okay. Yeah, okay. Dino says, even Engin flash pinned Travis. Yeah, I did. I was there, too, in Canada. I was there. You were pulling 80 kilos as a skinny guy. I remember you. Yeah. I'll tell you a story about that. Travis...
Todd Hutchings: travis was talking to chad silvers once and he said something some i'm paraphrasing now because this was a long time ago and it's not exact but travis said something like ain't no man can beat me and chad silvers goes and can beat you and travis goes he ain't no man
Engin Terzi: Yeah, yeah, I remember. There I gave a good match to Dan Victor as well. Dan Victor was the current WAF champion. We were finger to finger and then the paths were crossed each other. So the way makes more difference when you cross each other. If it was angled, you have some space, you understand?
Engin Terzi: Yeah, it was good. That was the event I beat Dave Patton. Did you win any round there? I think it was your first event. I don't think so. I don't think I beat anybody. I don't even think I could beat anybody on my team. Yeah, because nobody who watched the event would think that you would come to the point that you are right now. You didn't really look special at that time, but later... I don't look special now.
Engin Terzi: I just look like I gotta figure it out. I'm telling you, Paul. No. Get your training. The more you figure out, the more dangerous you becoming. Rustem, my friend, in my opinion, you are one of the top five greatest of all time. John Bersink is here. And then Devon is there. Rustem Babaev is there. Probably Zolev Haji Murad is there. You know, like, then, like,
Engin Terzi: Cobra, Dave Patterson, you know, some guys, you know. Ford sure, Todd Hutchings is also in top 10. And for sure, Todd is also a legend. But you are, you are like, if you also count right and left together, I mean, you are right there, you know. And we are very, very happy and honored to have you in this event. And my friend, you said you are in great shape. And you...
Engin Terzi: Okay, the question is, do you think that you may have a plan for both categories in the future, 95 and 105, or only 95? Do you think that 105 for you is impossible? Maybe, maybe, but I feel good for 95.
Rustam Babaev: 799 max, 100 manifest, maybe. And maybe some... I'll translate it, Rustam. Sometimes you can do something extra, if there are some interesting offers, I'll consider it.
Pavlo Derbedyenyev: And I'm saying that if there will be some extra interesting matches in 105, yeah, absolutely, we can talk. But main category is 95. He will come for tomorrow. Okay. Is there anyone you want to pull from 105? My plan takes the belt, the 95, after...
Engin Terzi: I think both up. Let's talk about some matches from the upcoming event. Okay, let's start with the Zurab Taverice, Gyorgy Tautiya. I always pick the top. When it's a top roller versus a hooker, I always pick the top roller.
Engin Terzi: yeah tautev is that that tall guy with the glasses yeah yeah i remember he was in florida no didn't he pull um no he pulled iraq in istanbul in last november yeah he's from russia i don't think he was in florida okay but i i know you're talking about really really tall yeah like over two meters you know yeah yeah he has he has
Engin Terzi: I don't know. I think he won one time AMC event from Russia. And yeah, who's winning that in 105 category, 231? I think Tautiev. Tautiev is going to win? Yeah. Tautiev, did you know that he's a surgeon? Yeah. Which is dangerous. I mean, we need surgeons. I hope he doesn't mess up his hands arm wrestling.
Todd Hutchings: I can find another arm wrestler. It's hard to find another surgeon. Yeah, yeah. Did you know that Daniel Prokopchuk is also a surgeon, orthopedic surgeon? I heard that. Brad Grundy told me both those fellows were surgeons. Oh, Brad is also a surgeon? No, he was in medical school when I was talking to Brad. He's the one he mentioned that those other two guys were surgeons. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Rustam, who is winning, Zurab or Tautiev? I think after Brogbon,
Rustam Babaev: Zorab stayed level down. Now he's coming back. This is right hand, yes? Right hand, yeah. I think not too much time was for recovery. Maybe 50-50 or 55-48 Tautiv.
Engin Terzi: Okay, okay. And let's go to, this one is, this guy, you have pulled before Lachlan, but you didn't pull Petro Marharin. No matter what the result of this match, I want to see you at some point against Petro Marharin. I think that match will be like war.
Engin Terzi: You're talking to me? Yes. Do you know Petro Marharin? I do not. I do not know him. Petro Marharin is the guy that in Moldova event in 2018, he beat Ravas, Sandris, John Burzin. He called them and beat. He also beat Nugo. Okay. 3-2. Yeah. He's really...
Engin Terzi: outside of this world. Rustam, do you agree about Marharin's wrist? It's strong? No, Margarita has a big wrist. And strong? Uncomfortable wrist. Uncomfortable. It's very bad for me. So if you pull Marharin, would you try to top roll him, Rustam? No, no, no. No, right? No. No. Because you top roll, he will, you know...
Pavlo Derbedyenyev: No sense for me. No sense for it, yeah. But at some point I want to see Todd Hutchings versus Petro Mari. Pavlo, how do you see that match? It would be a good match? It would be a very good match. If Petro will... I'm not sure if he's training already, because for all his life he was not.
Pavlo Derbedyenyev: Oh, Petro wasn't training, really? Yeah, he was not really training, you know. And he was back and forth. So if he's taking that serious now... He is, he is, he is. Now he's going to pull against Lachlan. That's going to be a problem for anybody. Petro will win. Lachlan is good, but Petro will win. But listen, Lachlan is very strong and Petro is slow. I pulled Lachlan. I know Lachlan. I pulled him. But have you trained with Petro?
Engin Terzi: No, I never pulled Petro, but I saw him pulling, so I believe that he's our favorite. Okay, Ruslan, who is winning, Lachlan or Petro? I think Petro. I think Petro. And Todd, you said you don't know Petro, so do you think you can have it? No? Yeah, I don't know. See, you are spending time preparing questions for me, but you are not
Engin Terzi: spending time to prepare answers for me. If you tell me I'm pulling him in three months, I will tell you everything about him. Yeah, but you know that we're going to have some predictions. Just joking. Okay, let's talk, let's talk, let's talk, let's talk about Jocelyn versus Egle. Did you see her match with Sarah? Oh, oh, oh, Jocelyn. Jocelyn, yeah, sorry, my pronunciation. Oh, oh.
Todd Hutchings: Agla is something special, but I think Jocelyn's going to turn the female arm wrestling upside down. I think Jocelyn's going to the top. I think you're going to have her pulling Barbara pretty soon. I think Jocelyn wins. Oh. Ruslan, do you know who Jocelyn is? Yeah, yeah, I see. You watch the match? I watch the match. I watch the match. I think Agla will be more stronger. You think Agla?
Engin Terzi: Rostam, I said to you that you are one of the top five in my book, in the history. Do you think that Egle is the same for women armwrestling, top five? Yes. She is right, yeah.
Pavlo Derbedyenyev: Can you tell me again? He asked about his ratings. Yes, he says, I said that in the rating, you are, for example, in the top five of all time in men's wrestling. Or do you think that Egle is about the same level, that she is among the best women wrestlers? Yes, I think that. And Pavlo, what's your opinion?
Pavlo Derbedyenyev: It's a it's a little bit complicated and Jocelyn is Extremely good and she's extremely strong. I just think that's maybe a little bit too early in her career But I'm sure we'll see her again. Even if she gonna lose I would say that
Pavlo Derbedyenyev: probably a slight favorite but because of the power of the jocelyn it's maybe i may be wrong we will we will see but uh it's maybe just a little too early for her yeah jocelyn jocelyn someone like her with such potential and such will like will always have a match you know
Engin Terzi: Yeah, she's amazing. I mean, I don't really care so much about the result of this match. We saw her potential and she respects and she really pays the price. I see that she is getting better and better. So it is great for us because normally now we are thinking Barbara is here, Gabriela is here, Egle is here, Sara is here. Like Gabriela and Barbara, they were close. But after that,
Engin Terzi: Egle is a bit far, we saw against Barbora and then Sara was far from Egle. So we need more women in the plus 80 category, in my opinion. And okay, so let's go to another one. Let's go to, it's a great event. David Dadikian, Rustem. David Dadikian versus Georgii Svetkov, left arm. I think David maybe.
Rustam Babaev: better but uh two two times maybe winner after question okay so you think that dadikyan first two rounds winner in the third round yeah yeah yeah maybe plus minus but maybe the david that he can
Todd Hutchings: have good power big power but not long not long endurance okay endurance yeah okay and and todd i think i think dadakin wins so i think it's yeah same same concern big engine little fuel tank but i think that it can wins i think he's just getting better and i think and he started out really really good so i understand and and and paulo that he can yeah i think that he can his favorite
Rustam Babaev: Okay. And another great left arm match. Kamil Jablonski, Gyorgy Dzeranov. Rustam, how do you like this King of the Table 14 card? Good? Very good. Very good. The best. The best. I think Dzeranov very strong. Very strong in hack.
Rustam Babaev: I don't know. If Kamil do it, your move, first maybe something will be plus for Kamil. But if Dzeranov take him a hug, no chance. Okay, so you are saying that
Engin Terzi: If Kamil manages doing this, Kamil is a winner. But if somehow he hooks him, then he's a winner. Yes, yes. Okay. And Todd, what's your opinion? I think a hook beats a press, so I think Yorgi's the favorite in this. Kamil's really good. I just think Kamil's going to be better against the top roller than the hooker, so I think Yorgi wins. But do we know that Kamil doesn't have a good hook?
Todd Hutchings: No, I just know, I just know that he loves the press, but I don't know much about Camille, to be honest. I don't, I don't know a whole lot about him, but you know, and I'm terrible at these predictions anyway. So Georgii parts up in my head. That's what I'm going with. I'm not going to think about it too much. Okay. Pavlo.
Pavlo Derbedyenyev: Yeah, Dzeranov, I believe, is a slight favorite. And I want to believe that he's a little bit faster than Kamil on the start. And if that's the case, Kamil is very fast, too. So it's an interesting match, definitely. But I saw a couple of the hookers when beating Kamil relatively easy, if they turn him into the hook. So that's... Baba, have you seen this with left arm?
Pavlo Derbedyenyev: with left arm. Because Ivan Moshenko did it with right arm, and Morozov some rounds. Morozov, yeah. When Morozov was twisting him into the hook, it was relatively easy round. When he was trying to tap roll him, it was not. So, and Dzeranov is mostly a hook puller. I want to believe that he will manage it, yes. Okay, okay. So, Rustem, let's go to some crazy match.
Rustam Babaev: Which match is crazy, Rustam? Okay, Rustam, I tell you. I tell you. Nugo versus Matt Mask. Very interesting. I know that Matt Mask have level better now.
Rustam Babaev: I know, I look last match, very good pulling, pull with the mask. He has a big arm, uncomfortable arm. I think 50-50. Not a favorite for me now.
Engin Terzi: maybe maybe half a year ago will be a new war now i don't know i agree i agree lately like marcio match marcio barbosa matt mask and now ongar wear match matt matt looks very good how do you see i i think matt wins pretty convincingly i bet against them i thought ongar bayev would beat matt and i thought ongar bayev would beat matt fairly easily but i think uh
Todd Hutchings: A tall top roller versus short hooker, I'm going to pick the tall top roller. And I just think Matt's, I think something's changed with him. I think he's serious or something. He's like a different Matt Mask than he was 10 years ago.
Pavlo Derbedyenyev: yeah he looks very healthy he looks very he said he wants to pull eventually devon and and uh how do you see this match paulo oh yeah i agree with guys and i think that matt is slight favorite here as of right now the only thing it's in istanbul so uh
Pavlo Derbedyenyev: the travel may make that little trick, which sometimes it does, you know, to our athletes or backwards. When they travel here to United States, it's easier for us. When we travel there, it's easier for them. So that's a little bit questionable. But otherwise, I think that is a favorite. Somehow, for Todd.
Rustam Babaev: Tad is alien. He's not from here. Devon't even example me, Tad. Devon't talk about that, man. He's different. Okay, okay. So let's go to another one. Paul Lim versus David Samusha, 95 kilos, Rustam. Very interesting, very interesting match. Hey, Rustam, Paul is strong, huh? Stronger and has dynamic, big dynamic and good start.
Rustam Babaev: and uh no no don't don't have big endurance but uh uh for uh depend like uh pre-preparated uh samusha if samusha will be for example time plus five ten percent then was maybe maybe
Rustam Babaev: Pauline win. If Samusha prepared something new, it will be interesting. But I think 55-45 Pauline win. Oh, 55 is favorite. Pauline is favorite. Yeah, yeah. Pauline have more... Explosives.
Engin Terzi: Rustam believes that he has more experience in the heaviest category. Like heavier one, 95 kg. And I heard that somebody has been kind of teaching Pauline or encouraging him to do side pressures lately. This is what I heard. Anyone else heard?
Todd Hutchings: Arm wrestling's changed, old man. I'm telling you, it's a different game. Do you think that Paul is coming with a different game plan? First, I think Samusha's probably the favorite, but I think Paul wins. What Paul learned in Rustam's match was Paul got into a good position with Rustam,
Todd Hutchings: But where Rustam stayed tight, Paul was too open. Every match, Paul was too open, and then he just ran out of movements. I think if Paul tightens that up and fixes that, he beats David. He beats Samusha. I didn't understand one part. You said Samusha is favorite, but Paul is going to win. When you're a 10-time world champ,
Todd Hutchings: I don't think the weight classes are that important. And he's a 10 time world champ. I think he's a favorite on the paper, but not really for you. I think Paul's got a harder job to win than Samusha does, but Paul's cause Paul's got to fix his, um, not his setup, but Paul's got to fix how he gets into Paul was just in a, in a bad position against Rustem.
Todd Hutchings: But it was an interesting match. I think if Paul tightens that up, he wins. But that's, you know, where Samusha doesn't really have to change anything. He just needs to come in heavier and be stronger, which is a lot easier.
Engin Terzi: I think Paul was more effective against Rustam than he was effective against Krasimir because Paul is a very offensive puller and Rustam is not a really defensive puller. Rustam is also an offensive puller and while Krasimir is a very good defensive puller. So where Paul is attacking to get advantage is a sweet spot for Krasimir more. And how do you see this match, Pavlo?
Pavlo Derbedyenyev: uh paul is my friend and uh i pulled him and i know how good or what's the problems are and uh uh yeah i agree with todd that samusha is still very slight favorite but uh it's very interesting match i want to see it uh samusha is that says 10 times world champ he just have to do his prep as he did before nothing changed easy prep i would say
Pavlo Derbedyenyev: where for Paul he has to make lots of adjustments and new movements and new angles, which are not easy job to do. I know that, so...
Pavlo Derbedyenyev: Okay, let's go to... Engin, do you think you will manage without me? I really, really... Yes, yes, yes, yes. I think you will. Thank you very, very much. Thank you, guys. Rustam, I'm forced to run. I think you can do it. I can do it. It was English practice. Thank you. I'm sorry. Thank you. Bye-bye. Thank you very, very much. Hey, look like you will not need you next time. Next time? Yes, he's very good. Rustam.
Rustam Babaev: Artur Makaro vs. Daniel Prokopchuk? I think Daniel. Right hand, yes. Can you tell me which style? Which style? I think hook. Hook, yeah. Maybe will be a strap match and Daniel Prokopchuk.
Todd Hutchings: Comfortable, have work in strap match. Winner in hook. Okay, and Todd? I always pick Daniel, and I always pick Gabby. So I don't care who Daniel's pulling, he's who I'm picking. So he's like my favorite arm wrestler. Okay, so we should ask you the question, who is your favorite arm wrestler more? Yeah.
Todd Hutchings: It would be hard between Daniel and Gabby. I don't know who I would pick, but I'll pick Daniel. What do you find special with Daniel? I find him very special as well, but I would like to hear your reasoning. Is it because you like the guy or you find something special with him? I don't even hardly know him. I just like how he carries himself. I like how he's aggressive and I like his pulling style. Myself, I don't think I've ever talked to him. Okay. And what do you like about his pulling style?
Todd Hutchings: I just like the power-based arm wrestlers. And I like that he... To me, he's just got a really, really good arm wrestling game. So, yeah, he's just my favorite. Yeah. Okay, so... Ivan Matushenko, Serhii Kalinchenko, Rustam. Prava. I think... I think...
Rustam Babaev: Maybe different, but I don't know the level. I don't know. Do you think that it is possible that he will top roll or the match will go inside? I think 50-50.
Rustam Babaev: 50-50, maybe. I don't know. Do you think Serhii top-roll Matushenko risk or you think that the match will go hook? Maybe first time and Matushenko will be better, but after maybe Sergei something do it new, I think too.
Engin Terzi: Okay, let me ask you Todd. I'm picking Matushenko and I can't explain why. I don't really know, but that's who I'm picking. Okay. Okay, so let's go to another great match. This match, I only want you to tell me percentage, Rustam. How much percentage, opponents? Rustam Babayev, Tata Chinks?
Engin Terzi: I think... No political answer. Real answer, from here, from here. 55, 48. 45, 55, 45. Yeah, who is winning?
Engin Terzi: Let's see if Todd is gonna play underdog or he's gonna tell us because you were telling me you will see three weeks later. So don't play underdog.
Engin Terzi: 56-44. Uncle Todd keeps his belt. Okay. Okay. Okay. That's what I want to hear. I don't like when people are going like, oh. I like this man. That's good. That's good. I like it. Yeah. Okay. Now. Last two matches. Gennady Klikvinia, Ibrahim Sago. But 115 kilos.
Engin Terzi: Well, I think Kvikkvinia. Kvikkvinia? Yes. And Todd? I agree. Do you guys think that he's going to lose the weight and then will still be strong and with good injuries? I think he's got quite a bit of weight to lose and still be strong. Okay, okay. And the last match, Michael Todd versus...
Todd Hutchings: Vitaly Laletin, I want to ask Todd, I'm very curious about your take here. Oh, I think Ermes taught a class on how to beat Michael Todd. Yeah. And I think Vitaly could probably do what Ermes did to Michael Todd. But
Todd Hutchings: Michael Todd finds a way of winning these things. So I think Vitaly is a overwhelming favorite and Michael Todd figure something out to win. I hope he doesn't press off the beginning, but I think Michael Todd changes something because, um,
Todd Hutchings: michael todd's also he's had almost as many birthdays as i have so i think michael todd is coming in doing something different i don't think he's going to king's move vitality so that's two predictions i think michael todd wins and i don't think michael todd king's moves
Engin Terzi: Listen, second part, I totally disagree. I don't think there is a lane in a fresh match, Michael, to win other than open arm top row. I don't see that. Like if you are really playing a different game against Vitaly,
Engin Terzi: I don't know, but of course, I'm not saying this guy is going to win or that guy is going to win, but I don't see any other lane that can be that dangerous for Vitaly. And Rustam, what's your opinion? I think 50-50, but Vitaly doesn't have big endurance. With Michael Todd, he needs endurance.
Rustam Babaev: hmm first much more maybe not too hard will be for the second much more in power give him next level down down yeah yeah maybe maybe I think yeah I understand needs to pull like Uncle Todd
Engin Terzi: You mean side pressure? That's how Michael Todd will beat a top-rolling Vitaly. You mean the outer side pressure? Mm-hmm. I mean, if someone could do that, it would be Dave Chaffee, but, I mean, last time they pulled, it didn't go well. First time, yes, it did, but I don't know if Michael has that side pressure as Dave Chaffee has. Do you think that...
Todd Hutchings: Michael may have more side pressure than Dave. I haven't pulled Dave in a long time and I haven't pulled Michael in years. So I don't know where they're all at. I just think Michael Todd needs a style like that. Do you think he can adapt that quickly? You know, he has been doing something for many years and then suddenly he changes in a few months. He becomes... Arm wrestling's changed. Everybody's got to adapt.
Todd Hutchings: i don't know i don't know i i don't know about that you can't keep training the same way and still be champion nobody can do that anymore you have to change do you really believe that 100 do you think that do you think that levon is changing anything no i think people are changing to beat lavon but it doesn't is it changing anything so far levon probably doesn't have but i don't think we've really
Todd Hutchings: scratch the surface of what LaVon's capable of. Cause he's got a lot of stuff you see, but nobody's really challenged him yet. I mean, he's not one dimensional. He's got some moves in there that you only see for a little second when someone puts them back, you know? I think LaVon's got like a whole nother dresser full of tricks nobody's ever seen.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, you asked me a question. You said you're planning to come back and are you planning to change this and that? And I answer you, what do you think that like the main change, you know, from 10 years ago to today? I'm not saying that nothing has changed, but what's the main like difference, you know? Training with pulley machines, training with bands on a table. Actually,
Todd Hutchings: not doing so much biceps, triceps, wrist curls, reverse wrist curls, reverse rolls, upper shoulders, middle shoulders, actually training. You are saying that there is more pressure involved in arm wrestling? I think you train more complex movements than individual muscles nowadays.
Todd Hutchings: And is there any favorite armrests? Max effort days. I think you got to have several max effort days. Back in the old days, people used to just do five sets of 20 exercises. I think you better know what your max efforts are and all your moves. So you know that you're getting better. Do you think that what works for you would work for everyone? I think that strategy would work, maybe not those tactics.
Todd Hutchings: The training method, do you think it would work for everyone? It would, yeah. I mean, I didn't invent it. I took it from somebody else. So I didn't invent it. I took it from powerlifters. So I didn't invent it. So I don't have any personal... Okay, the person that you took it from, did it work with him? Who is he? Louis Simmons. He ran like the most successful powerlifting gym for decades.
Engin Terzi: Oh, okay, okay, okay. Your arm wrestling specific training, you took it from a non-arm wrestler? The strategy, I took it from a powerlifter. Oh, strategy, okay. Oh, okay, okay. Not the specific training methods. No, max day, speed day, volume day. Oh, okay, okay, I understand that. Yeah, okay, okay, okay. I wasn't sure what you were saying. Okay, let's see. And the last question, Rustem. Ermes Gasparini and Levan Saginashvili in June.
Rustam Babaev: I think Levan is a big wall. And Gasparini has the power, but I don't know enough this power for Levan. I think 45-55, maybe 40-60% Levan win.
Rustam Babaev: Okay, but it's not like big difference, but 55-45 or 60-40? Yes, but Ermes knows Levan. Maybe prepare something new for him. If it will be that, maybe it will be interesting. But Levan too knows.
Rustam Babaev: Gasparini. Do you think Gasparini is a very good armwrestler? Good armwrestler. Very good. I like Gasparini. He has good technique.
Engin Terzi: he's a good man for me yeah yeah at the table he's also very very smooth you know he honestly he reminds me a bit like in the past john brzing but john brzing also had hook hermes is more outside but he can do press and everything as as todd you said the way that hermes armless against michael was
Engin Terzi: Perfect. I think any mistake, he would have lost that match. And when I say that the match was close, people say, oh, come on, it was close. If he would make some mistake, he would have lost that match, you know? Yeah, but he didn't. No, I gained a whole lot of respect for Ermes in that match. That was like a flawless lesson on how to deal with the top-level Kings move. What Ermes did was very, very impressive. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Todd Hutchings: And how do you see that match, Ermes versus Levan? Do you believe in? I think Levan still wins, but I think Ermes wins. One round? Two rounds. Two rounds. I think Ermes wins one of the early ones. He wins rounds one, two, or three, and he wins the last round. No, he doesn't win the last round. Ermes wins two rounds. I don't know which two.
Engin Terzi: and you are saying he's gonna win the early rounds wow i think he'll win one of the first ones and then he'll win one more i think he wins two rounds and another question uh who's asking the questions here a provocative question what was the score of their first match of ermys and levon that one says that one says he was four zero
Todd Hutchings: Ermes says he was 4-2. I looked at Levan's record on the East First West website and it's 48-50. He only lost two rounds. If you default or forfeit, you lose. I think Ermes won two rounds by forfeit.
Engin Terzi: Okay, so you are saying a 4-3 it was. Yeah, I mean, Levan hasn't been pinned, but I don't think he's won every single round. There's a difference between never being pinned and never losing. Okay, okay, okay. Anyways, guys, thank you very, very much. And I see you guys in, how long do we live? Like two and a half weeks later? Yeah. Yeah, you guys will be in Istanbul and see you guys in Istanbul. And I wish you guys healthy preparation.
Engin Terzi: and take care of yourself you both are legends and we are happy to see you guys competing against each other thank you thank you thank you thank you guys happy easter everybody
