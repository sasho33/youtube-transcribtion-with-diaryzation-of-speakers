SPEAKER_00: Today we have a special guest, Hermes, the Gladiator Gasparini. How are you, Hermes? I'm fine. Low hanging. Good to see you again. Good to see you. I'm very fine. Thank you so much. Yeah. Thank you so much. So how are you? Like, I think that, I don't know. I thought that your... You see my hand?
SPEAKER_00: You see my hand. This is what I expected. From yesterday to all the day like this. I saw one video and I don't sleep, nothing. Shaking all the day. Depression. But this is exactly what I expected. After 180 kilos, I said, now, Hermes, now, like Hermes show everything.
SPEAKER_00: This weight, that weight, he calls Levan, Levan, where are your weights? You know, are you scared? Why you don't share any video? And then yesterday Levan comes 180 kilo and then he goes, ah, and then you, how are you now? Shaking all the day. Shaking, yeah. You are acting like you are joking, but I think you are really shaking. No? No? No, that's right.
SPEAKER_01: No? It doesn't scare you? This exercise, really, I love too much to do. But I don't know why. I tried it many times. I feel pain every time here, the forearm, when I grip the barbell. And that's why I removed this. Yeah, I have a question for you. How much do you think
SPEAKER_00: It's important for arm wrestling. When Irakli was also doing like 130 or something, and then Todd Hutchings was saying that he doesn't train his bicep, he said that my 100-kilo elbow versus your 100-kilo bicep. And how much do you think that this is... For sure, something will help, for sure. But if you see the example like...
SPEAKER_00: I don't know if Todaci can do 50 kilos, but he's still stronger than Irakli. Can I ask you something? How much can you do? I saw like 92 kilos. How many reps did you do? I did 92 for eight reps, two times. You mean two sets? Yeah. And do you think you can do 100 kilos?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah. Only maybe now I feel very good, but I don't know if I want to risk to have some injury or some... No need, no need. Pain, because if you put some, if you calculate 92 for eight times reps... My friend, my friend. If you do 92 for eight reps, one rep today,
SPEAKER_01: Or at the competition, you will do 100 kilo back pressure. At least 100. So better save it for the June 2020. Exactly. And for what I think, because I show many methods, like Todachin, Devon, Levan, many, many super champions.
SPEAKER_01: And all the athletes have a method for him. It's not like for everybody. Yeah, yeah, I agree. Yeah, I agree. But I think you need to put the exercise similar like for arm wrestling, you know. I prefer to do back pressure like this because when I'm at the table, I'm here.
SPEAKER_01: I'm not doing like this on the table, you know. And that's why, before I joking, but that's why he did 165 two years ago better than now. I think now is not a very good shape like two years ago. Maybe he can do 165 today in the same
SPEAKER_01: Maybe, yes. But when he did the 180, he used his back and his belly like crazy. The barber jumped on his belly. Too much easy to do like this. I want to ask him, try on the table with back pressure like me. And you can see if you are real...
SPEAKER_01: power on your arm or not. I think Irakli can do more than him. What's that? I think Irakli can do better than him on the back pressure on the table. So you are saying that Irakli's brachioradialis is probably stronger than Levan's? Yeah. My friend, his weight is 180 kilos.
SPEAKER_01: You know how much power you can do with your back like this. To Max, it's like, to me, 125 to hold 125 to do like this. More or less the same, you know. And are you challenging him to try the way that you do? He will have some problems for sure because he can't.
SPEAKER_01: So you are saying that Levan cannot do as much as you do? No, impossible. My friend, if someone can do more than me, they posted immediately the video like in the past or before than now. Nobody can do more than this. So are you saying that you have the strongest back pressure in the world? I think yes. If someone can do more for sure, he put some video on the social.
SPEAKER_01: But with real weight. But Friday I will put the measurement of the cable to show. I show it many times, the weight, everything. But there are some fans of Levan, they think it's fake. Okay, but you're going to weigh the weight? Yeah, you know the measurement of the cable. You can put the machine.
SPEAKER_01: Uh-huh. Okay. Okay. Okay. My suggestion for Levan, better don't do that, this exercise with too much weight. I don't want to cancel the match to
SPEAKER_01: to postpone the match. No, I don't want that. So you are saying that if he tries the same way that you tried... He will break his arm. And then he will cancel. Okay, okay, okay. Don't provoke him. His back, he can break his back, no problem. His back, he can break. He can put 200 kilos, 300 kilos, no problem. But here it's important for the match. Okay. Nicola Foster saying,
SPEAKER_00: Hermes, which match in the past two years taught you the most? From which match did you learn the most? For sure... With Devon. Devon. So Devon showed you your... Maybe not weakness, but where you need to get stronger. Yeah, yeah. The first thing with Devon...
SPEAKER_01: is to not underestimate your opponent and to have enough time to prepare the fight, because I had only three weeks. And other things, yes, about pronation, capping. Before Devon, I trained too much, arm, everything, but here, almost nothing.
SPEAKER_01: That's why after two years I had a very super improvement on my hand, pronation, rising like crazy. That's why the people will see the difference in the match. Hermes, did I see wrong or you were doing the riser with 64kg?
SPEAKER_00: 67. Oh, 67 kilo. Wow. In the past, I did almost the same, but the cable was more here. Oh, okay, but this time it's coming... Now it's here, completely here now. Okay, so you are about two centimeters even farther. It makes so much difference here. Yeah. Because here it's not so big, and then two centimeters here...
SPEAKER_00: It's really big difference. Big difference. The correct execution for me is to put here the cable. Yeah. Yeah. To me, this knuckle. Yeah, this knuckle here. When it is here, it's enough. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 67 kilos is crazy. Crazy. And before I did the back pressure, I was tired. I think maybe I can do a little bit more, maybe 70 kilos.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, so in my opinion, both you and Levan will be stronger than last time. This is what I think. And we will go back to your match with Levan. It is a very, very important match. And what I like about you is that whenever you accepted this...
SPEAKER_00: It is very, like, how to say? One second. This guy, yeah, 24 hours he can just satisfy himself. Anyway, so, Hermes, like, when I said this match, you, first thing you told me, like, Engin, my goal is to give Levan a match as hard as last time. Like, you don't want to do any, like,
SPEAKER_00: And now, more I talk with you, more and more since the Tbilisi event, we set the match, you are saying that, like you even told me, like, are you coming to Chicago? I said, why do you want me to come?
SPEAKER_00: And then what was your answer? You remember your answer? You see, then you're number one, my friend. See, that is the thing. Then you're number one. You are not. Listen, you will win or you will lose. I have no idea. But you are not going there to lose. Last time you pulled him, you were like, sorry, but you didn't go there to win.
SPEAKER_00: Yes, last time I told him maybe he can do something good. You were saying that even winning one round will be like... Only to stop him, it was a dream. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And now you are saying that, Engin, why don't you come to Chicago? I said, why? And you are saying, do you not want to see the new number one? And you are like, this is very important.
SPEAKER_00: It's very important. And now you have a mindset, you go in there to win. That is very, very important. So we are going to witness something great. I don't know how it's going to end up, but you to go there without being scared and just really giving your all is amazing. Much important mindset.
SPEAKER_01: But don't create this because I want to be fake on my mind. No, no, no. I believe really this. I can see that. Not like for a video like this. This is what I believe.
SPEAKER_00: Hermes, these are private conversations, not on YouTube. When we are on private conversation, you are saying, come there, Engin, and witness in person that the new number one. That is something different. You were not going to say this here, probably, if I didn't remind you. But I'm just sharing that mindset that's like, wow, that mask is going to be incredible. Incredible. Yeah. Yes. So how did you like the last event?
SPEAKER_00: What did you think about, like, you, you, you, listen, it's good that you didn't lose your house or your car and everything, right, Hermes? You remember your prediction. No, no, my house, everything, it was for Giorgi, Giorgi.
SPEAKER_01: Did you not say that Michael was going to? Oh, you said 70-30%? 70-30% yes. Everything was for Gheorghi. Poor Gheorghi. I saw the post, he wrote a game over like this.
SPEAKER_01: I wrote to him for almost an hour to convince him to be safe. Don't worry, you will come back, my friend, you are the champion. And he appreciated it a lot. But the event was super amazing. My favourite match, I was super excited. Nugo with the mud mask. Too much energy.
SPEAKER_00: There is one super chat. You would crush Vitaly. I love AOC. Says that you would crush Vitaly. And we will see that match again. We will see that match again. It will happen for sure. Okay, so my analysis, I don't know if you listened to my analysis or not, but my analysis, like when the match started and they were at the center, I was like,
SPEAKER_00: Like, wow, it's finished. I thought it was finished. You know, when Michael. Ah, okay. Okay. Yeah. I thought that the match was finished. Yeah. And then after the match, I asked Vitaly, I said, Vitaly, like, why did you not climb? He said, I tried, but I lost the connection here. Like, so he, he, his back pressure wasn't enough to counter Michael's that dragging, you know? And, and then.
SPEAKER_00: I also asked Michael, I said, Michael, like, why did you try to do this when you could sleep this way in the last round? And I realized that Michael didn't want to go to the strap because normally when he does this, he's going so far from the opponent, like your shoulder pressure, Gennady's shoulder pressure, Kamil's shoulder pressure, I'm 100% sure stronger than Vitaly's. But when Michael is going so far,
SPEAKER_00: It is coming so far for you. While for Vitaly Kudrych and Michael had no comfortable place, room to rest. And Michael usually also do this. And then, but whenever the strongest grip in the world is pressing him like this, his riser was even hanging like this, you know. If you see the third match, don't remember.
SPEAKER_01: when Vitaly was on the left-back when he won with the press. His liver is too long.
SPEAKER_01: And he didn't need to climb. And then he did like this, a little bit of rotation, and the riser of Michael went down. And then he won. But for me, to do like this is impossible. For me, it was impossible. Before the match, we were saying, La Lettine has never faced something like Michael. And that was true. But what we learned here,
SPEAKER_00: that Michael has never faced someone like Vitaly with that long reach and with such a strong grip. And my question to you, what do you think if they would pull, if they are in good shape, both good shape, do you think that after this dead-risk pressure with a strong grip, do you think that Vitaly has a chance to beat?
SPEAKER_01: Yes, but I think the match will go something like that. If Vitaly improves his press more, he can win. But he needs a lot of power because he can go back.
SPEAKER_00: Listen, if Lallatin, Lallatin has very strong side pressure, if Lallatin brings Devin here, in a losing position, do you think that in this position, like when you put shoulder, do you think Devin is stronger or Michael is stronger? It's two different powers, I think. No, no, what I'm just saying, in the center, I think, in my opinion, Devin is stronger, but in this here,
SPEAKER_01: Do you think that Devon is stronger in a defensive position if it is near to Pat? In this part, in the final, final part, I think Mike will have more power. You mean in the last final part? Yeah, very last. But Devon will have more power here. At the beginning. Yeah, listen, Mike is also a little bit like dragging.
SPEAKER_01: When Devon is using more risers, I think. Yeah, yeah, yeah. This will make some difference. It will be a very good fight. I can't wait to see. After many years, finally they will compete. Yeah. Gaura Gaming is asking a question. Be aware of 300 pounds Devon.
SPEAKER_01: Levan this time in trouble. The guy is saying that when Devon is 300 pounds, that Levan is in trouble. I don't know. I don't know because now there are some thoughts about what happened to Gennady.
SPEAKER_01: uh really i think i think he needed to check his arm maybe or maybe he need more time to recovery after the the the the surgery and because i don't think he is the same shape like when he fought two years ago
SPEAKER_01: Maybe Ibrahim is very... The weakness of Gennady is the technique of Ibrahim, I don't know. But... You know, maybe... We will see what he will do. Yeah, I understand. But Ibrahim also looks very impressive.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but we don't know if Gennady is strong now or not strong. This is the problem. It's difficult to compare only one time, only one match to other athletes. Yeah, I understand. Hermes, there is a question.
SPEAKER_00: JR55AMG. Best of luck from Germany, Hermes. Forza Italia. Thank you so much, my friend. This will broke. Do you think that yesterday when Levan shared the video, it kind of changed the perception? Like you were lifting all those weights and you were sharing and then Levan was not sharing anything and then
SPEAKER_00: Like I saw like all the comments were now going like help of the people saying Hermes win, help says Lewandowski. And now yesterday he came and then did 180 kilos. Hermes is finished. And now, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Do you think that this kind of thing? Yeah, the people is crazy. If maybe we put the back pressure 100 kilos, people will come with me again.
SPEAKER_01: It's like this. Because, yes, people can change their minds about videos. About me, I don't care what people think. I care what I can do in the gym, what my improvement is.
SPEAKER_01: and showed really unbelievable improvement. That's why I'm very confident, you know. It's difficult to go with Leo and to say I will win for sure, but I'm confident I will do something good. After he lifted 180 kilos, he was impressive and intimidating, but after he put the weight,
SPEAKER_01: when you go like, ah, you know. Did it affect you? No. No? I don't know. We are talking about one man, 180 kilos of man, for sure is super big, super powerful. No, no, not about being big, but that aggression, you know, like,
SPEAKER_01: You know, he was like... No, my friend. No? No? No, no. He needed to say, more I will be angry, more I will be stronger on the match. It's better to him to be friendly with me. You understand what I mean? Yeah, yeah, yeah. And... Yeah, but when you say that more you are angry, more you will be dangerous.
SPEAKER_01: I'm just saying that maybe when he did that thing, roaring, you know, maybe it didn't make you angry, but it scared you, maybe. No, no, inside I feel already the fire. It makes you more provoked, right? Yeah, yeah. Okay, let's go, huh? I will go like crazy, my friend. Yeah, that's what I want to hear, yeah. And then... Go ahead. And the Madrid rules is same like East versus West or...
SPEAKER_00: What's that? The rules. The same, same, same, same. Yes, same. Yeah. All right. Doyle Conrad, can prime John Brzee beat Hermes today? It would be a good match, very good match. Yeah, it would be a dream to fight with John. Yeah. The Fuzz Music, he did 165 kilo times three cleaner. Is he strong now? I don't know, he says.
SPEAKER_00: I love AOC. My friend, would you ever try 115 kg too? 115 kg about what? Like what? Like back pressure? He said he's not going to even try 100. He does 92 kilo eight reps so that you are waiting, you are saving that record lift.
SPEAKER_00: It's my last performance shot. Ben says, it would be nice to see Hermes and Devin training together. I really think it is about these two guys to beat Levan. Much love. We need to make a fusion. I think that
SPEAKER_01: Like, you guys need to go against Levan one-on-one, not teaming up against him. He is enough, my friend. Yeah. I will be enough. I will give to him mask of oxygen if he need to use it. You are going to give oxygen mask to Levan? Yeah. Yeah, to Ragli, sorry. To Ragli and maybe when we see Levan...
SPEAKER_00: A little bit down. Hermes, I didn't know that you bought and you needed Oxygen Mask that you're going to give to Lewand. Why do you carry Oxygen Mask with you? Because when I will stop him, I will... Yeah, yeah, but why did you even buy the Oxygen Mask? Do you use it on daily life? No, for Lewand. Oh, you're going to buy it as a gift? Yeah, gift for the match. Oh, that makes him angry. You know that, right?
SPEAKER_00: I will give it to Irakli because Irakli needed to put the mask, you know. So do you plan to give him a mask at the press conference as a gift? Yeah, very beautiful. Very beautiful. Okay, but you be careful. I don't know. Okay. Yeah, yeah. Anyway, so we will see. He said he...
SPEAKER_01: He wanted to finish all six rounds. He wanted to... How to say? He's going to tell you to go and pull. Yeah, come and we'll continue. Last time, he was lucky because if the rules were running foul, the result would change a bit too much.
SPEAKER_01: How is it? He was very lucky last time. What do you mean? It's the past and that's it. Yeah, because every time when he showed his arm like this, he made a foul every time. Okay, but in that match, was it a running foul or a regular foul? Regular. Oh, regular. Oh, so you are saying if it was a running foul... But if it was a running foul, like when I fouled with Devon... Uh-huh.
SPEAKER_00: For sure, I pinned him more times. Okay, so you are basically saying that round three would be your win because the match continued. For sure, 100%. Okay, I understand. It was like a pussy because if you are a real man, you will fight until the end, my friend.
SPEAKER_01: Not to make a foul and then I will retire, that's it. This will not work next time. You mean on June 21st? Yeah, this will not work. Mr. Hermes, you are just talking so much. My friend, he doesn't understand. He thinks he can beat me like nothing.
SPEAKER_01: He thinks to crush me like nothing. He doesn't understand what happened. He doesn't understand what happened. I'm not joking, my friend. So you are saying that you will stop in the center? Yes. It's better to calm down because I feel already too much energy. You get nervous, excited already. Okay, okay, okay. He doesn't understand, really.
SPEAKER_00: Okay. Listen, listen. One guy says that Engin loves stealing the pot. What do I do? He's the one who's saying all those things that he would beat Lewand if the rules were different, running foul. He said that Lewand doesn't know what's coming. And then I'm the one who's stealing the pot? Yeah, I like that. But Hermes just doesn't do anything. He does it by himself. He knows very well how to beat me like nothing now. He never be confident like now.
SPEAKER_01: When the match stops, his mind will crash. He won't understand what happened. When you see something new, something horror in the night, it's the same thing. It will be his nightmare for the second time. Let me read this and I will ask you a question. I love AOC. I meant, would my friend ever try the 115kg class?
SPEAKER_00: So when he said 115, he's asking, would you compete in 115 class maybe someday? Because Devo now, he said if I will lose with Levan, maybe I can go down too. So you are saying that you're going to beat Levan and maybe later you may go down and come back? I don't know, you know, I don't know.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, Michael Workspace says, I am so hyped for this match and this event. Can't wait. My friend. Okay, I will tell Ioane. My friend, will you fight all six rounds this time? It's better to ask to Levan. Ask to him if he will not retire again. Hermes, hard work, side pressure and riser to beat Levan.
SPEAKER_01: How? He said the hard work, side pressure, and the riser to beat Levan. The riser is one of the most important things. And pronation too. But the most important thing with him is arm power. If you don't have arm power, you will go down.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, Doyle Conrad says, is David Dadikian versus Ermes a good match? No. Right arm, Ermes. I think left arm, Dadikian. Do you agree? Yeah. Yeah, too much strong. The one who asked, question for Engin, will this be the best East versus West? I think yes. I think yes, and I will explain why. My friend,
SPEAKER_00: Just tell me one event that in the same event you had Levan, Hermes, Devin, Kurdesha, Morozov, Jerry, Michael, and I'm not going to count, but listen, not every, every Eastern guy got a visa already. I mean, not, not all of them, like, but Irakli will be there too, just to pull. Wagner Bortolato will be as well.
SPEAKER_00: Like, like, can you imagine that Devon there, Levan there, Hermes there, Kurdeca there, Morozov there, Jerry there, Michael there, like, I mean, many, many. So anyone who has ability, like, like financially or time, you know, to go there and witness this, please don't miss it. Please don't miss it because you will,
SPEAKER_00: never, ever forget what you will experience. And I say this much, you know that when I mean something, like when I say something, I mean it. But it's totally your decision. This event will be the biggest, greatest, the most, how to say, most exciting event. I don't even know which match I should concentrate to promote. Of course, this is Levan Hermes-Supre with right arm match. But like,
SPEAKER_00: Any other of those matches, also Jerry Morozo could be a main event. Devon versus Evita would be another event, it would be a main event, you understand? Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure. So what I just said, right now we have all of them in the same event, so it is crazy, it's crazy. Really, really, I can't wait, really, I can't wait to see. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. So you are saying that you will go back to home with Gauntlet? Okay. Okay. We will see. What do you think about Artur Makarov versus Daniel Prokopchuk match? Good? Wow. Good match, yeah? Unbelievable. What do you think? My friend, it was like one round, Daniel tried to go and then side pressure of Makarov
SPEAKER_00: couldn't turn his, he just made him out stretch this way. So it is very hard to do back pressure when your arm is like this, unless you do the open arm top row. So in the second round, when he went inside and beat Arthur, and then I talked with Hristo. Hristo was there. Hristo said that Daniel has very good endurance. I said, Hristo, just, I will tell you something probably you didn't know before about Arthur.
SPEAKER_00: This guy, within the match, doesn't have super endurance, but when he goes to corner, his gas tank full, like so quickly. If you realize it, if you realize it, the last round. Do you realize that every round was very hard? But the last round, he beat him like this. You understand? Yeah, the same with Vitaly. Same with Vitaly. Vitaly goes to corner, comes back. The guy is just, I mean...
SPEAKER_00: Like he recovers fast, you know, and that is what I thought. And yeah, it was impressive. So Artur is one of those guys that won the belt permanently. Yeah. Yeah. And Tatashvili versus Rustam, it was a very close match. Very close match. Yeah, he could go... The hook, I think... Hard was stronger. Stronger. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: But when Rustam changed the technique, Rustam really bought off these guys a lot too much. Rustam, too, was phenomenal, really, I think. I think Serhii Kalnyshenko also played very good against him. Yeah, too much. I thought the third round,
SPEAKER_01: He came back with the victory. When he won in the press, I thought now he would win for the endurance, but Matushenko is very smart. Remember, Hermes, you told us that the belt will go back to Italy. I hope soon it happens, giving you all my strength and love.
SPEAKER_00: Thank you so much, my friend. I will keep the promise, my friend. Okay, okay, yeah. Doyle Conrad says, will there be an East vs. West in Los Angeles anytime soon? Soon, I don't know, but eventually it will happen. Ioane, my friend, looks like handsome Francesco Bernoli. What the...
SPEAKER_00: He says that you look like handsome Francesco Bernoulli. Bernoulli? I don't know who he is. I don't know. I don't know. If you don't know, that sounds like Italian name. So if you don't know, I don't know either, you know? So, yeah. There is one guy saying, are we looking at the next champion? Huh? The one guy is asking, right now, are we looking at the next champion? Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: You are saying that Levan should not make you angry and the more he makes you angry, the more dangerous you will be. But you said a lot of things already, a lot of things I don't want to remind. And if anyone missed it, they can just go and watch from the beginning. You said a lot of things that would probably make him angry.
SPEAKER_01: I don't care if he will be angry or not. Better. If he will be angry, me more than him. This synergy will be favorite for me. Better for me. Better for you. Okay. Okay. So, and what do you think about the Devon versus Kurdeca left arm?
SPEAKER_01: No, because I know something behind the scenes. But if we see the practice table, Kurdeca, he destroyed him many times. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: But on the real match... Close? Very hard to say. It's very close, this fight. Too much close. Everybody knows Davon. He has a super good defensive position. With the open top roll, with pronation, super strong.
SPEAKER_01: To beat this, you need to have at least all superpowers like Lewand here. You need to be fast. Or you need to have a very good press if you want to finish this. If Kurdeca has a good press, he can win for sure. But it will be a very close fight, really. Do you think that when the match starts, the press match,
SPEAKER_00: Will it go to Alex's winning side or do you think... Okay, just say that he went to Alex's winning side and Devon is like this. And if Alex can do this, can he impress him? Yeah, if he has enough power, yes. Depends where Devon will stop him. If he will stop to march down,
SPEAKER_01: if the press is more effective. If he will stop not in the centre, but maybe in the middle of the centre of the losing position, he can still win. It's my opinion. I understand. Okay. Doyle Conrad says, Is Michael Todd versus Devin going to happen soon? I don't plan such thing. I don't plan, but
SPEAKER_00: Panda, Doc, Hermes lost all his money. One second. And house with Michael Todd. I just said the same thing, but Hermes reminded me that he talked about that for Georgi Svetlakov versus Michael match, not Levan match. He said that Michael versus Valentin would be 70-30, but
SPEAKER_00: I don't think for 70-30 he would bat his house. He needs to be 200%. Dino says, the new champion of East vs West Croatia. I am sad, Hermes. I don't know what he means, but yeah. Devon wrote. Devon wrote, yeah. I am way too old now. Last breaths.
SPEAKER_00: If I stop the match, massive victory. Yeah, I do the same thing. Every time you say it like this. Yeah, yeah, I do the same thing. I'm old, injured. But that's true. That's true. That's true. Yeah, yeah, 50 years old is amazing. It's not only the 50, my friend. It is also the damage on the arm. People often talk about
SPEAKER_00: Tatashins, but Tatashins started when he was 35. So he has 20, 23, 24 years, you understand, on the engine. Yeah? I mean, like... How many years? Devon is probably 35 years. I am the same way, 35 years. You know, like... Oh, Chance Cho says, hello, engine, and Hermes. He says, Hermes, Levan is going to crush you.
SPEAKER_00: No, I'm joking, joking. He didn't say it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Anyways. I can't wait to prove. Okay, listen, there is some interesting suggestion from Dino. Devon in Hermes' corner versus Levon. I don't know if he will help me. What?
SPEAKER_00: I don't know if he will help me or not. Do you need his help? It would help you? Would you feel good? Him at your corner? Yeah, we can do. And if you win, Lewand would never forgive David. Now we will see. Yeah. Anyway, so that is great. Yeah, it will be incredible.
SPEAKER_01: Jerry Cadoret versus Artur Morozov. This match, I think a lot of people think Morozov will win for sure. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Many things. Because now the people think to see the athletes can see my match or Lewand.
SPEAKER_01: with Jarry and they will win easily. But we are not the same power in all the points. For sure, Morozov the hook is super strong. But it depends if he can go faster than Jarry to
SPEAKER_00: to have this position. Because if Jerry started before him, he can... Do you remember the round that Gennady tried to go inside and he pressed him? Exactly. So I think that it is not really a hook, but it is a little bit spinated side pressure. Because when you dive in, he's still pressing you down. Exactly. Did you see Devin's...
SPEAKER_00: Comment? No. He says, after what we saw, Levan, okay, after what we just saw, Levan, do you need all the help you can get, Hermes? Yeah, yeah, everybody. I will be like everybody will help me. So you are the only one that needs help? Levan doesn't need help, huh? Wow.
SPEAKER_00: That is real gladiator. Oxygen mask. Oxygen mask, okay. Oxygen mask. Listen, this is the second time. This is the second time. Okay, people say it's not real. No, I think it was real. Anyway, so this is the second time you are mentioning about oxygen mask. Very beautiful oxygen mask. Super beautiful.
SPEAKER_01: to Irakli, and Irakli needed to be in the corner and to be faster to put the mask on Levan's face. He needed to train and heal this movement. Dino says, imagine the picture, Hermes wins with Devon in the corner. Epic picture. Yes.
SPEAKER_00: Ok, question. If you beat Levan, would you pull the winner of Devon and Lallatin? For sure. When?
SPEAKER_01: I don't know. We will see after the match. I think at the end of the year or maybe a little bit before. My mindset is November, December, like this. In November, we have in Switzerland. I'm just thinking, if you would have a big match,
SPEAKER_00: in Switzerland, Swiss Open. The day before will be Swiss Open and the next day will be East versus West. And imagine you have a big match. And I heard Italy is only two hours from Switzerland. Or Switzerland is two hours from Italy. From North, yes. Do you think that if you would have a match with Vitaly or Devin,
SPEAKER_01: in Switzerland, do you think that there will be a lot of Italians coming and supporting you? Ah, for sure, for sure, they will come, for sure. Yeah. For sure, my friend. Yeah, one guy... Because there are a lot of people who continue to ask me when East West Wales will be in Italy. Okay, listen, listen. Because they want to see the champions.
SPEAKER_00: Talk with Claudio. Like, Claudio is... Yeah, yeah, I already show to you. I already show it to you. Yes, yes, you show, yes. There are some plays very beautiful. Okay. Number one, Ernest in France says, much respect, Ernest. You are becoming my favorite athlete. Keep up the good work, my friend. Thank you so much, my friend. Too much love, really.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, Chen Shou, very provocative, very provocative. He says, Engin, does Hermes realise that I have more winning rounds on Devon than he does? Yeah. He won one round on the fouls and now every time, you know, like Devon or someone else... It was super funny, this fight. Fuck yeah!
SPEAKER_00: There is one other guy who says, Engin, do you plan to set up an event in Balkans? My friend, we would like to organize East versus West anywhere in the world, anywhere in the world, but we have some standards and we need to talk. If the people who want us to organize there, if they can help us to provide that standard, then of course we can do it. But I think that we need to do it in Italy.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, we need to talk, to be beautiful. Like in the Colosseum, my friend. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I will be, I will enter with my... Helmet. Helmet of gladiator. Imagine the situation, people in the center of the Colosseum. Yeah, wow. Something like unbelievable. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: And Dimitris Mishalakopoulos. Greetings from Greece, my friend. Keep training and may the best win. Yeah. Thank you so much, my friend. Yeah, it will be great. It will be great. And I think once again, I'm repeating, this will be the best event in the history. I have no doubts. Once again, I will repeat.
SPEAKER_00: Levan, Hermes, Devin, Kurdeca, Michael, Morozov, Jerry Cadoret, Giorgi Di Zerano, Wagner Bortolato, Fia Raisic, Irakli Zerakashvili. I mean, very heavy card, very heavy card. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, yeah. The guys are saying I need glasses. Yes, I think I need glasses.
SPEAKER_00: down, you know, if I'm driving and the sun is coming from the front, if it is like almost evening time, I'm like, no Engin, you can do it, you know. It's too stubborn, you know, too stubborn. Anyways, so anyways, guys, thank you for your support and we are about to finish. Do you have any last message for your opponent? My friend can't wait to compete. Suggest you, I have a suggestion.
SPEAKER_01: do not make him more angry because Levan is not someone to, you know, mess with. I'm just saying as a friend. Don't worry. He's already angry with me. Don't change nothing now. Okay. So you are saying that... For two years on Instagram, he show only video with his face with mask.
SPEAKER_01: And now, finally, he can prove it was a mistake. He's already angry. He did the 180 kilo because he has too much scary of me. You understand? He's in the best shape of his life because he has too much scary of me. That's why. And he will be nervous like crazy on the stage. You will see, my friend.
SPEAKER_00: So you are already with this part is too much angry with me inside, like sportsman. Can I ask you something? Why do you think that he went to pull Devon? He said that he was 75, 80%. But when he comes to you now, he's breaking all the records. Do you think that he's taking you more seriously than Devon? Yeah, because he knows I can.
SPEAKER_01: with my back pressure. You saw the last match, my friend. You saw. He doesn't want to make another mistake like last time. And I hope it will be in good shape because last time, you remember, he said, I was not in the best shape with Armes. I underestimated him and many, many things. Now,
SPEAKER_01: Everybody knows he's doing best with new records, everything, super strong, amazing strong. And if I will beat him, I'm sorry, after I will beat him, you don't have any excuses. Zero. Okay. If you were in this shape two years ago against the shape that Levan was in Dubai, would you give him 6-0? 6-0?
SPEAKER_01: No 6-0, Mauro, for sure winner. Okay, listen. But what if the one is so strong in there? My friend, think about this. Think about this. This movement. No belly, belly, belly, barbell curl. This movement. 92 kilos I did two years ago. 92.
SPEAKER_01: Now, eight reps for two sets. Okay. At that time, only one rep? Only this. Two years ago, only one rep? Only one. Oh, okay. Okay. And riser, I never trained like now. In the beginning, I did 50 kilos, something like that. It was like this. Now, 67, maybe more. Pronation, same. Cupping, same.
SPEAKER_01: Believe me, after two years, super big improvement, really. And I think he already had, he already arrived in his best shape. He don't change it too much now for him. For me, too much. You are saying that after injury, he was here and now he's come into the same shape as before? Yeah, more or less, yes.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, okay. His mind is trying to convince himself he's in the best shape, but it's not true. He will become the same. Hermes, Hermes, Hermes, sorry, but people are watching us. Only two minutes ago, you said that he is in the best shape of his life, and now you are saying that he is in the best shape or not? Best shape he is. Okay. Okay, because you said that he is trying to convince himself that he was in
SPEAKER_00: Best shape. Do you think he's in best shape or not? Yeah, he said he's in best shape. Okay, okay, okay. 180 kilos with belly curls, a lot. Uh-huh. Okay. And then last two Super Chess, Dino says, I don't know what I said. With me.
SPEAKER_00: With me. They are with me, my friend. Okay. And then the other one. They will give me the energy from Italy. All the Italians, my friend. Okay. And then C. Manuxa. Hey, guys. I am from the future. Congratulations, Hermes, on your 4-2 win against Levan. Don't say these kind of things. People are not going to buy tickets. People are not going to buy tickets. Why are you telling the score, guy?
SPEAKER_00: I'm joking. I need to try belly curl, my friend. No, don't injure your back. I don't want anyone... No, belly, my friend. We put... But still, still, still. But I need to have more fat here to do this. Okay. Okay, just don't injure yourself. Don't try to lift weights that you didn't try before in the past.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, guys, don't send any more Super Chats. Just that guy says that, Hermes, I am rooting for you, my friends. He's from Norway. Thank you so much, my friend. Okay, Hermes. We will destroy the monster. We will see, Hermes. Hermes, you know, I will tell you something.
SPEAKER_01: Before we close... My friend, there are six rounds. Yeah. Correct? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. In the roast case, first and second, he will win. Roast case. Third and fourth will be the same, maybe. Roast, roast case. Hermes, okay, listen. If it was not you, I wouldn't take it so seriously.
SPEAKER_00: But you are someone who knows arm wrestling and looks like you have a game plan. And how much do you think it is about the power alone? How much is it about the strategy? Are you technically ready here? Yeah, yes. But really, he is all about power here.
SPEAKER_01: I'm wrestling, yeah, you need to have power, long power, because you need to be 100%, if you can, all the matches. And technique, for sure, a little bit. Yeah, I'm very happy. Yeah, I have the strategy. I have already the strategy, my friend. Everything is already planned.
SPEAKER_00: Uh, I need to be smarter to use all my power to this day, to be my best shape. And, uh, and I feel really confident. I see it. I see it. A while ago, a few seconds ago, it was almost 1,200 people watching live. I don't remember if he did more one-on-one, maybe with Devon we did it. A lot of people are interested in this.
SPEAKER_01: and I'm very, very happy to see you strong here. You are not going to match with any doubt. No, because if you go like, yeah, I can try. How is it better to stay at home and don't lose like this? Yeah, yeah. If you lose, if you lose,
SPEAKER_01: You lose with honor, with your best 100% power, everything, mindset. And you came back to home and to tell to other guys, yes, I did my best. But with mindset and the power. Okay. Before we close, I will just also ask the guys. Guys, can you write on the comment section who is winning?
SPEAKER_00: It's supermatch. Nobody. Okay, it says Hermes, Hermes, Hermes. Oh, how is it that a lot of Hermes? Thank you, guys. I mean, if this would be the poll, yeah, but then why is on the,
SPEAKER_00: Quality pizza, pasta, too much power, my friend. Okay. I mean, it's maybe normal because people who are watching this, mostly your fans, huh? I don't know. I don't know. You don't know? Okay. I think they are all the fans of, yes, me, the community, I'm wrestling. It's good. I don't know. Yesterday, after...
SPEAKER_00: Levan lifted and then screamed like this? Oh, my friend, after belly curl. What? Belly. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, it's not good. It's belly curl. I mean, if he was my opponent, I would just say, oh, I think we need to cancel the match.
SPEAKER_01: I'm honest. If you see someone like Levan the night, he will scream like this. I think it will make some scary things. Yeah. But good that you are only going to arm wrestle, right? Not fight. Yeah, wrestling is nothing. I think only him can beat the gorilla. Oh, yeah? Yeah, my friend. If you take Levan, Brian Shaw, other...
SPEAKER_01: 20 guys like this. One, the first three, four guys, maybe we die for sure. Who's going to go first? Maybe you go first. No, no, no. Who's going first? Wait. We need to put the point. If the guys, 100 guys, don't go to fight with Gorilla,
SPEAKER_01: they will die, they will still die. Oh, you are saying that if they are going to die, I mean, if they don't fight, they will die anyways. Exactly. This changes everything. Yeah, but listen, what is the difference? If you put them without these things, for sure, Gorilla will be too much scared. Okay, but then you will ask the others, you know, who wants to die first?
SPEAKER_00: But you need to put the limit time, 10 minutes, and they will go for sure. I understand, but please go first. No, all together. 100 people cannot touch the guy at the same time, you know. Anyways, because, I mean, like, how many people can get hold of the others?
SPEAKER_00: You can take one arm. Brian Shue, another arm. Three, four guys. And the guy, the gorilla has given his arm. Have you ever seen him like jumping, you know? Yeah, but... Do you think that you are thinking not a gorilla, but you're thinking a tree probably, not moving like this? I mean, OK, never mind. Let's talk another time, you know? Yeah. Anyway, so, Hermes, you...
SPEAKER_00: probably made Levan very angry and I hope, I hope you follow the right strategy and I wish you healthy preparation and really you have my big respect, you know, for that courage you have. Thank you so much. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, you two like go there like you're gonna win and you,

SPEAKER_01: Yeah, no problem. I will repeat all my words. I will repeat everything. And him too. Him too. Him too. Fake weights. He will beat me like nothing and many other things. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, let's see what he will say. But looks like he was just
SPEAKER_00: waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting, and he just came with me. He has too much hair, that's why. That's why. Too much hair inside, he wants to fight with the people. Okay, anyways, Hermes, you take care of yourself, my friend. Keep in touch, and please stay healthy. This is a very, very important match. I think maybe this Friday,
SPEAKER_00: But there are four weeks. I think I will not push anymore too much. Yeah, yeah. Don't come to me with an injury. No, no, no. Yeah. Very big mistake. Yeah. Take care of yourself.
