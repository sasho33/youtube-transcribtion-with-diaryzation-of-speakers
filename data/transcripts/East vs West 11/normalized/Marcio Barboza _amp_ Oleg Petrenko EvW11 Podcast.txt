SPEAKER_03: joe mama and you will you pull any time so that you know table are more so we can see you just relax and smash first i need to get in shape i'm training i'm training i'm not in bad shape normally if i don't train long time um normally if i didn't train a long time i go back and start from 10 15 so slowly but this time i didn't do that i directly started from
SPEAKER_03: 50 and so i think by the spring i will be in very good shape but that's jerry antilla mask had pretty good idea about a little bonus for the match of that night here valentino rossi also moto gp champion waco says thomas champ what is your favorite event that you ever held so far and which match was your favorite at the east versus west so far there
SPEAKER_03: I really need to think. It's hard to decide. I am a fan of concrete. Okay, concrete. Oh, so you are not you are not real concrete. Oh, okay. Okay. Okay, somebody is
SPEAKER_03: I am a big fan of Vala. Looking forward to seeing his arm wrestling career blossom as the years pass. MRX. Yeah. Okay, I think more people came. I think... Paolo is here. Paolo, yep. And the other one says iPhone, but I don't know who he is.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, Oleg Petrovich is also here. Hello, Oleg. Hello, Pavel. Hello. Privet, Oleg. Privet, Pavel. Yeah. So, how are you, Oleg? Good? Good. Good. Good. Yeah, he's good. Everything is fine. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: and you're gonna you're gonna uh paulo are you gonna have any super match or something in vegas uh unfortunately no because i have to leave uh on sunday and all the super matches starting on uh sunday night and monday so i was supposed to have some treatment yeah i will have some treatments and i will have some you know uh table time just for fun just some practice
SPEAKER_03: That's good. That's good. That's good. Okay. I think Marcio also came. Yeah. All strength says the translator goat is in the house. Hello, Marcio. Petrenko, can you make it through your phone? Good. You hear us, Marcio? Yes.
SPEAKER_03: Marcio doesn't. Now he is probably Marcio. Can you hear us? Yes, can you guys hear me? Yeah, yeah, we hear you. How are you? Good, good yourselves. Yeah, good. Yeah, it's good. Good, he's good. Let's start. Let's start all like. When you pull against.
SPEAKER_03: john berzing it was east versus west five and before the match you said that this is the new era in arm wrestling you said and east versus west five will be the proof for this and
SPEAKER_03: But you lost that match. Right now, you are again pulling against someone like 50 years old. You are 50, right, Marcio? Yes. 50. Artem you going to say the same thing? Do you have the same claim?
SPEAKER_01: Oleg, when you fought John on the 5th, you said, that's it, the new era for armwrestling has begun, I will win. But you lost your supermatch. He says, now you will fight against Marcio. You asked Marcio, he says, you have 50, Marcio says, yes, 50. He says, well, what will you say if you lose again? Oleg. I think his connection is not good.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. No, no, he heard me. He heard me. Yeah, okay. What do you say? Yes, I still think that the new generation is coming to armwrestling. But the old generation is still very strong. I couldn't win with John, but I think I was close to victory. I think I didn't have enough experience. I made a lot of mistakes at the beginning of the fight.
SPEAKER_00: I don't think it will happen again with Marcio, although he is also a very strong opponent.
SPEAKER_01: He said that I still think that new generation will become, you know, better. But he said, you know what? Old generation is very good, too. So he said, yeah, with John, I did a lot of mistakes on the very beginning of the Supermatch. He said with Marcio, I will try not to make those mistakes. But he said still Marcio is a very good puller. So we'll see. But I will try not to, you know, not this to happen again. I understand.
SPEAKER_03: So, Marcio, how is your shape? I hear you are in good shape and you look also very good right now, I see. Yeah, I think I'm in good shape. It's just this week that I got sick. I had two weeks of vacation and it just ruined me a little bit, but I should be okay for the match. Yeah, I have no doubt. I have no doubt. How do you see this match, Marcio? How do you see your opponent? How do you see your chances?
SPEAKER_03: what is the mindset nobody comes from all the way from overseas to here you know to lose you know nobody and you are the least person you know the last person to do that and i'm sure you're gonna you're gonna come here to win and you you had two matches previously right and left you won both of them and is your shape right now better than last time we saw you here
SPEAKER_04: I believe so. I believe I'm better. I mean, there's no way to measure it. Cause I got, I got injured last year and not last year, 2000 to 2024 already, but I got injured. I stay out for nine months and it's hard to measure. And at this age, it takes, it just takes a little more time for you to get, you know, better, better. What used to be like two, three months. Now it's taking like,
SPEAKER_04: six months to a year. It depends, you know, everybody's different. But I believe I'll be in good shape. I mean, if I don't feel any injury, I just had stem cells like beginning of December. I had some pains, you know, we've been pulling for so long and it just limit you a little bit from what you want to do. But I don't have the pains right now. So I believe I'll be really good.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, yeah, I kind of feel that Team West is coming strong. Pat Hutchings is already in great shape. Pauline says he's in his best shape ever. And Pauline thinks you are also in very good shape. And I'm sure when John is 105 kilo, he's also usually like better than last time we saw him 95 kilo. He kind of was a little bit like slim, you know, smaller, you know, and yeah.
SPEAKER_01: yeah yeah i'll translate real quick i'll translate real quick so i can understand what he's talking about uh
SPEAKER_01: In general, I think I'm in good shape, I'm gaining weight. It's a bit difficult to measure. Of course, age makes it a bit difficult to know, because the recovery time used to be 3 months, now it takes 6-9 months, so it takes a little more time. But Engin says that Team West, the team from the West, is coming in good shape, that Todd Hutchings is in good shape, Paul Linn is in good shape, and he commented that Paul Linn
SPEAKER_00: said that Marcio is also in very good shape, they sparred a little together, so that's it. Yakov, I'm sorry I got sick, I'm just glad he came in the best form, because I want to beat him in the best form.
SPEAKER_01: okay yeah Oleg said that uh so sorry that you got a little sick but uh get better and he wants you to be in best shape to make sure that you know when he wins or if he wins no he said that he want to make sure that he winning the athletes in their best shape yeah I don't know if you should call it go ahead Marcio sorry
SPEAKER_04: No, it's funny because last time when I went to remember, I had COVID like 12 days before. I still performed good. So I don't know why this happened again. But it doesn't take, you know, anything from my mind. Like I have a mindset. So everything in my mind is according to plan. So if I have to rest a little more just to get to feel better, so be it. Sometimes when you're older, it plays in your favor, you know.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, and whenever these matches that we mentioned, you know, John and Pauline Tatachins and Marcio,
SPEAKER_03: Like 42, I think, 50, or 41, 50, 57, 59. And opponents, only Krasimir is in the, like, 735. And the others are mid-25, Irakli, Petrenko, and Dadikyan. So should we call it East versus West or Old versus Young, you know? That's what it looks like. Yeah, the new generation are, I mean, we're still holding on, right?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah, very well. So yeah, yeah. Yeah, just maybe you translate him then. Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: It will be a challenge for young people against old people. Against the old age. And Marseille says, listen, we're still holding on a little bit, right? I think it's very good.
SPEAKER_01: he said he said yeah i agree we can rename it and the comment too that we holding on still he's like very well but but he said that we are stepping on your toes we are stepping on your toes
SPEAKER_03: yeah yeah i mean there is i don't think there is any other physical combat sport that you know people at these ages would could challenge you know to the people who are young enough to be their their son or maybe some of them like grandkids you know and so arm wrestling is like that that exception you know amazing yeah my oldest son is 24
SPEAKER_03: He's 24, right? How old are you? I think Petrenko is probably, what, 26, 27? Oleg, how old are you? 27. 27. His older son is 24. Yeah, he's 27. 27, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Marvin Short, Engin, is Oleg and Barboza playing 105-kilo category? Yes, that category they are playing.
SPEAKER_03: And Rick Harrow asked me, what is stem cell doing? My friend, some people are saying like thinking like, oh, stem cell, like, like it gives you power, like hormone. It has nothing to do with that. You know, it's stem cell most likely will have like no effect except
SPEAKER_03: anti-aging if you are not injured you know if you don't have any physical problems you know so like if you have injury it may help you to recover that area but i don't think that it is going to make you stronger it can cause you to be stronger because you are not hurt anymore you are healthy in that area and some people talks about if it is embryo or something no my friend
SPEAKER_03: It's not from embryo. It's against my belief. If it is from embryo, I wouldn't use it. It is from the placenta. That is the part between mother and the baby. I don't know how they call that thing. Cord. Yeah, cord. Yeah, from there. So I wanted to clarify that there are so many misinformation around and no need for that. So I clarify that. So, Marcio.
SPEAKER_03: uh what is like you know uh petrenko you probably have watched him before and also probably you analyzed him you know after you knew that he was your opponent he was your opponent um where like how do you find him like what is your analyzing results about like what do you think about him where is where are the pluses where are the minuses you don't have to say it but
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I mean, I won't say everything, but I'll give him compliments because I think he's a great opponent. He's very strong. He's a student of the, you know, Andrei Pushkar, one of the greatest, you know, rest in peace. And I think it's just, he looks like him in terms of strength. He look, you see, you look at Petrenko, you see like a strong, you know, strong person. He look like a bull.
SPEAKER_04: He's, I believe he's strong everywhere. Never, you know, grab his hand or anything. But just by looking at him, he seems to be strong everywhere. Like his arms are strong, his wrist, his hand. I mean, I don't think you have him. I think he'll be better, even better than he is right now. I don't think he's at his peak. He's only 26, 27. But definitely one of the strongest guy around this weight.
SPEAKER_04: And my only advantage over him is experience and technique. As far as strength, I don't know. I think we probably closed. Yeah. Maybe even a couple percentage stronger. But if that's the case, it's not enough to pull somebody, you know, like me. But I hope our difference in strength are very close. I hope there's no gap, you know.
SPEAKER_04: But he's, to me, when I look at him, he's strong everywhere. Very dangerous opponent.
SPEAKER_01: Marcio, I'm sure you've already analyzed Oleg as your opponent, watched some videos. Can you tell us a little bit about what you saw there? He says, I won't tell you all the plans, but I want to say a couple of compliments. He's a very strong opponent. Evgeny if you look at him, he looks like a strong person. He says he's a student of one of the best handball players in the world, Andriy Pushkar.
SPEAKER_01: And he says, listen, well, in terms of strength, he says, I'm also strong, he says, in terms of strength, I hope that there is no such big difference. I think that he may be a couple of percent stronger than me, but I'm a little more experienced and a little better at technique, maybe. He says, well, very, very close. He says, I just hope that there is no big difference in our strength indicators, that we will be able to fight close normally. So that's it.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, and what does Petrenko think about Martiu, like technical analysis, you know? Oleg, what can you say? You've probably already analyzed the same question. Yes, I've watched the last special fights with you, with Irakli, with Zirakashvili. Well, these fights that interested me, as I understand it, were the last fights.
SPEAKER_00: Well, yes, Marseille is very strong. Very strong. And, of course, he has a lot of experience. Well, I also analyzed and I see his weaknesses, which I would like to use. But I can't be 100% sure that I can do it. So I will consider a few options to use with them. And I think one of them will lead me to victory.
SPEAKER_01: Okay. Yeah, for sure. Oleg was looking forward for the latest matches of Marcio with me and with Irakli, and he analyzed them, and he said that he is very, very strong physically. He was looking for some holes in techniques, and he thinks he found a couple possible variations where he may be successful, and he hoped that one of them will bring him to the win.
SPEAKER_01: of course he's not gonna share with us what it is right he said you you will see on the table what I found and Marcio have you found something with him yes I mean definitely uh like I said he's very very strong
SPEAKER_04: Um, but I, I see like an ex like I can, I can surpass him in experience, you know, uh, you know, this is when, when you, when you, you have your first grip with the guy, you know, just test a little bit and find, you know, study areas, same way. He's, he's saying like, look at the videos to find some areas. I mean, I already, I already know where he probably find just the way he's, you know,
SPEAKER_04: Pablo translate, I already have my idea of what he was talking about, but, uh, those areas are fixed. It's going to be a good match regardless. I think, I think it would be a great match. You know, it's not going to be easy for any or none of us. I think it's very close.
SPEAKER_01: He says, yes, he said, well, I also analyzed, he says, well, I think I can, based on my experience, win there, he says, I also saw some mistakes somewhere, some weaker places, he says, he is very, very strong, but based on experience, I will probably be able to get out. He says, well, this will not be an easy match for any of us, you can see it for sure that it is a very close match, he says, I'm sure it will be so humiliating. I also believe that we are quite equal.
SPEAKER_00: I think there will be a plus or minus fight at the table. Everyone has strengths and weaknesses, both in me and in him. It will depend on who will use them, who will be faster. We need to keep calm.
SPEAKER_00: who will be more resilient. I think it will play an important role in this fight. I see that Marko is quite resilient, quite good.
SPEAKER_01: I believe that we are pretty equal in our strength and power. And he believes that the match will be very, very interesting on the table. And he said, you know what, I believe that Marcio is...
SPEAKER_03: Marcio's endurance is on a level and it's going to be just fun match to watch for, you know, for spectators and it's going to be pretty equal match, he believes. Yeah. Marcio, why is it that, you know, the representatives from East are young guys while the best guys from the West are kind of, you know, like us, you know, a little bit old? It's unbelievable, right?
SPEAKER_03: it's why there is nobody there is why there is nobody coming from i mean there is people there are people coming but just look at you know like welterweights like craig tuller craig is also probably 50 years old you understand yeah so i mean you're talking about devon you're talking about you know like michael you talk about jerry you talk about you tata shins you know so like
SPEAKER_03: But you guys were also very successful when you were young as well. Yeah. Like when you took second place in 96 rough in the same event, Jerry was there.
SPEAKER_03: He also won 110 kilo. So, I mean, so the same people 25, 30 years ago was also very good, you know? And so it's not about being old, you know, it is like you have been kind of pulling very successfully for decades. So like all those cobra, their pattern, all these guys, when they were young, they were also very like world level pullers.
SPEAKER_03: Why now there is something? I kind of think that it is maybe they were away from the international competition, while people like you guys, all the guys that I mentioned, they also have international experience, correct? Very hard to gauge that problem, but it seems like I always, like in Europe, Eastern Europeans, like they always, they look like they have their eyes on the new generation always.
SPEAKER_03: And that's a positive thing. Yeah. It's a cultural thing, right? Cultural thing, you know? Yeah. They try, I'm sorry. Because like, for example, all the Eastern Europeans, they compete WAF wars. And in WAF wars, there is like 15 years old category, 18 years old category.
SPEAKER_03: So there is very high level of the junior competition. And it is that without the competition, no one can get better, you know. And I think that U.S. being U.S. juniors being away from the international competition is kind of causing them a little bit like, you know, away. Delayed? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't know. That's my opinion.
SPEAKER_04: no i agree with you over here uh north america south america it's it's not doesn't have the same uh like people don't concern that much about the young the youth which it's it's a problem right because we don't have the new generation there is only just a few people you know and back then we were all you know at 17 18 we were competing
SPEAKER_04: everywhere already it looks like i said i see europeans taking care of the the youth they always have like a in a gym i see in kazakhstan in turkey and so many other places russia not so much russia now but georgia every everywhere like most of the the top teams they they worry about the next generation uh here in america it's you don't see that as much
SPEAKER_04: it should it should be changed you know at some point yeah but it takes a lot it takes some some some efforts from some people and uh just promoting the the youth competition all around you know the promotion needed and before you translate paulo daniel andrea says it is not popular here in america at a young age um it's not like
SPEAKER_03: not popular as basketball and football but trust me my friend arm wrestling over here is not popular as basketball and football either you know i mean but uh i think it's just a little bit because of that and also because a little bit like i don't know what do you think paulo yeah i've been i if you don't mind before i translate i will make my own comment on this because i am from ukraine and i spend my younger years there uh so
SPEAKER_01: basically it's not cultivated in schools anywhere but uh in europe uh there is a i would say arm wrestling schools and clubs they are more official and they inviting kids not only in europe in asia too uh in united states it's not and i have a perfect example in my house my older son dimitri
SPEAKER_01: i've been taking him with me during his middle school age he was not really you know into any uh popular in usa sports and i've been taking him with me to the competitions and he's been doing arm wrestling since he was six and he all even been winning some you know adult competition here by age of 14 but as soon as he go to high school he committed to wrestling
SPEAKER_01: he committed to college wrestling and i'm asking him sometimes will you go to arm wrestle you know arm wrestling competition with me he's like that i don't have time i committed to this very serious and i have my tournaments my scheduled routine he said as soon as i finish college and i will be off the mat from the complete competing wrestling i'll be back into arm wrestling that's i believe maybe one of the points why we are here a little bit aged
SPEAKER_01: know so after we done with our other sports carrier arm wrestling is a very long lasting sport and we know that we can successfully pull until our what 60 right look at richard lupkus he was pulling until 60 plus and many others marcio is 50 and as we said john is 56 59 uh hutchins 57 so we know that we can
SPEAKER_03: you cannot do it in wrestling. But my friends, like, wasn't it the same case when they were young? At that time, still wrestling and other sports were popular and armwrestling wasn't. But they were very successful as well, you know.
SPEAKER_03: Not as juniors. I don't know. They didn't start at 50, maybe. No, no, it doesn't have to be. But I'm not asking you why there is no junior at the world level from US. I'm saying like why there are like 25 years old guy that is the best in the world from North Aymeric. Is there anyone like that? I don't know.
SPEAKER_03: no no no there is no 25 years old person armistice from us or canada that is the best in the world there is there are people who are older they are either number one or close you know like like devon is number one and tatashins is number one you know pauline got the title at a point you know so
SPEAKER_03: these are all people over 40 years old but this is the same case here in your your country ukraine your country has wrestling and arm wrestling the same level no over here over here probably yes
SPEAKER_03: But listen, over here, my country, most of my best students were the people who went to wrestling and either injured their knee or something. And then from there they came and they were already beating the guys, you know, because they did wrestling a long time. They were already built, you know, so good, you know, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I agree. It's a hard discussion, I'm not sure. Oleg, let me translate real quick so Oleg knows what we're talking about. Maybe he has an answer for us. Oleg, we had a discussion about why European athletes are younger and become better, but don't do armwrestling as long as Aymeric.
SPEAKER_01: Look, Aymeric are all good and older. Let's say Ukrainians, Russians and Europeans are all good and younger. What does it depend on? Why is this happening? We don't have such a sharp answer. I think that in Ukraine
SPEAKER_00: And as far as I know, a lot of people started working at 30, 35. And when you start working at 15, you are already at 35, you have so many traumas. And maybe the style of life, work, maybe it affects.
SPEAKER_00: I think that the most important thing is that we are supposed to start working quickly, well, early, 15 years in the middle, but as far as I know, in Aymeric it starts quite late.
SPEAKER_01: very much yeah all all the things uh uh that you know approximately the same answers as we have that uh it's a little bit cultural that uh they are starting early and by let's say 30 they have so many injuries usually that they quit uh and uh americans usually
SPEAKER_01: start later in the later ages uh you know that's yeah he said that cultural plus the lifestyle and the work style you know he said yeah that's that's probably the reasons yeah but go ahead go ahead go ahead
SPEAKER_01: also also he said that possibly that our supplementations and food uh allowing us to last longer here at the vest uh their better quality and availability much better that they will continue our sport age maybe I mean I don't know yeah I think we need to another subject yeah in
SPEAKER_03: Andrei Yagveladze saying that opposite case is also true. Not many old elite pullers from East either. Yeah, yeah. I mean, yeah. I mean, because they don't continue. Yeah. But the thing that is like... I think that when you talk about the future, I think we should focus more about the younger guys. Anyways, so...
SPEAKER_03: let's talk about the event let's talk about the event and what they think um i'm not sure how much marcio follows the eastern atlas but let's ask him i'm sure petrenko is following a little bit closer
SPEAKER_04: Like, for example, Robby Toppy versus Aymeric. Do you know Aymeric, Marcio? Yes. From France. Good left arm. Very good left arm. I saw him. You know Robby? Yes, I pulled Robby when we were 220 or something. Okay. We did some professional finals over here in the U.S. Some of those... I remember...
SPEAKER_04: one of them you you were part of it one of those um in las vegas remember in the hotel england yeah rob robbie was there yeah he did the i think he did the final with me oh you were in the final with him on the left arm right okay and and how do you compare him with with aymeric
SPEAKER_04: I saw him a couple of times. I saw him at Zloty competing. He seems to be really good. I think he plays highest top three. I don't know if he's Europeans all the time or... I'm not sure, but he seems to be really good. At Europeans, he took second place to Rino Masic. Oh, okay. Yeah, he seems really good. I mean...
SPEAKER_04: hard to see i don't know what what kind of what do you think about robbie robbie says he is in medical shape it's uh it's hard it's hard to call because i haven't seen robbie in in a while i haven't competed in him in a while and um how do you consider his left arm yeah i think it's close match uh i would say i either i medic
SPEAKER_03: have a little bit more experience because we pull in a lot of those very top events, European events. And I think you have a little advantage in this one to me. You're saying that he has more international experience because Robby also pulled people like you and many other Rambats and this. I mean, those are also very experienced guys. And Paolo, what was your opinion about this? David we ever ask you this?
SPEAKER_01: yeah uh rapi is usually pulling he's pulling high level but here in you know inside the united states i'm not sure uh it's uh when you're competing overseas and especially on another side of the ears it's uh
SPEAKER_01: very very important to have those you know overseas experience how you travel how you you know perform there your sleeping routine your food routine and so on so it may play a big experience role because as an arm wrestler i believe robbie has his experience
SPEAKER_01: also so i can i cannot give you any predictions on this i just want to say that this international experience is very important when you're pulling on a level uh on the highest level like marcio been doing this for 30 years right uh oleg petrenko been doing this for uh
SPEAKER_01: mean long time seven years a lot 10 years right a lot of experience there robbie is not as experience of travel puller that's may play a big role in it okay and petrenko do you know who robbie toppy and america is
SPEAKER_01: No, Oleg didn't know them before you set up the match. Okay, Oleg, you are not a good fan. He said, yeah, possible.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, Oleg, this one, I don't want prediction, only the name, the winner, winner name. Oleg Petrenko versus Marcio Barboza. Petrenko, Oleg. Petrenko. What is the score? What is the score? 3-1. 3-1.
SPEAKER_03: 3-1. Okay. And Marcio? I can only say this. Oh. That's enough. Okay. I mean, it sounds like you're going to win two rounds. Oh, with the head, it's three rounds. Yeah. Okay. Let's go to Vala Ishketi, Nur Nurdalet, Aydar Khan.
SPEAKER_04: good match oh you follow them marcio no i follow european uh i'm confused about their names but i would say the kazakh was a former world champion in 75 kg now he's in uh kilos and he can't lose the weight anymore and he goes 187. he's incredible he's very explosive you know
SPEAKER_04: He's incredible. Really, really good. The thing is that 85 kg, I don't know if he used to guys that, you know, in Europe, like every little class makes a little bit of a difference. So he's very great at 75 or 80 kilos. I'm not sure. No, no. He pulled this year at 80 kilos. Wow. And he won. Oh, okay. Oh, he won. Yeah. Last year he was second, right? Right now he's around 190. He weighs 190, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: So he's probably in his best shape, I believe, because he's very young. And do you remember Vala? Vala is the one that pulled with David Samushia from the same country. Yeah. No, I know him. I saw him also at the AMC. Yeah, yeah. He's very good. He's a top roller. Learn, learn, Marcio. Learn Petrenko. You see how he knows the Eastern Atlas? He says, Petrenko, learn how to be a fan of Tomar Meslin.
SPEAKER_04: good top roller i think is a it's a battle of the the top row it's yeah it's gonna be a very good match i i would give 50 50 is very close it seems to be on paper to me very close
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I kind of feel Vala has more horsepower, while Nur Nurdalet is very explosive. And then we will see where the match ends, or stops, you know, after the goal, you know? Yeah. Sometimes when you're... What's that, strep? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, but after strep, I mean, you know...
SPEAKER_04: You know, they will just go. You might be right, Engen. I might be right. The Georgian kid might be a little bit stronger, but I see the other guy seems to have so much control on the hand. Yeah, yeah. And also starts very quick. Yeah, very fast. Very fast. It's very interesting. He could go either way. And Petrenko, Vala, you know Vala and Nurdalet? Don't tell me you don't know.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, okay. He said that Nur Nurdalet probably going to win because of his explosiveness and speed. Yeah, let's see. Your countrymen, Marcio.
SPEAKER_03: Wagner Bortolato. I know you are right now double season, US and Brazil, but Wagner versus Matt Mask. And you are probably one of the best guys to ask this. Yeah, I pulled both guys. I pulled Wagner right here when Wagner was 242, but I can't even imagine it's 345 pounds or something. He's over 350 probably. Wow.
SPEAKER_04: It's a whole different mountain. And his right arm, how is his right arm compared to his left? Look, his right arm is really good. It was really good.
SPEAKER_04: some time ago i mean i pull him like long time ago maybe 15 years ago he was very good i he made it to the finals in waf twice on the right arm under 110 kilos yeah and he lost to gnadi one and the other one he lost to i can't remember his name but from russia very very strong guy
SPEAKER_04: so he's really at his best he'll be uh he made a top top two you know at waf a long time ago but he got injured i pulled him he was very good i i have to i hook him and from the hook i thought for him uh how is it compared to his left obviously he's right compared to his left his left is is better i mean when he was a hundred percent in both arm his left is probably
SPEAKER_04: a minimum five percent stronger you know i would say and he's faster to his angle it's closer on the left and how do you see him you have pulled against masks before so how do you compare them right now mad i mean mad to me it's all about the hand and wrist control
SPEAKER_04: His arm is not as strong. Like, if you go to the arm, I mean, I would say like this. If he can control the hand and don't let Wagner get too close, because I heard Wagner saying he was going to try the top row. I don't think it's going to work. I think his best bet is that wrist and press. Yeah, that's what I was thinking. He's too big right now. I mean, if he goes with the shoulder behind, I don't think Matt can stop that, you know. But I'm not sure because it depends.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, it's been too long. Matt cannot go this way. He has to control a little bit with the side more. Yeah, he needs to check the center. I don't think he's going to hold it. You and I, we are thinking identically about this one. Yeah, I think that's the way it could go either way. Matt has to be smart in the way he approached Wagner. Because if you let it go just on his forearm, he's not going to be able to hold it. And Oleg,
SPEAKER_00: Oleg, what do you think? I think it's Wagner. He's a lot more physically fit, and I think he'll just add to it. I'm convinced he'll win. If he doesn't break the wall, it's a fight.
SPEAKER_01: Oleg is pretty sure that Wagner will win with the press, you know, the flop press, because he's much, much stronger physically. He said only if he will not break the table before they started. Yeah, should we put them in the main event so we can secure the matches before that?
SPEAKER_03: And as she records, Roman says, Privet Oleg, Iagato Delia was
SPEAKER_03: Great match. What does it mean? He said, hi, Oleg, I'm ready for you. Yeah, exactly. You know Roman? Oleg, do you know Roman? Which Roman? Roman Gamtenaze, who is doing the live during the East vs. West. You know him, Oleg. Who else films Roman for the Georgians?
SPEAKER_03: I know Pollin is your good friend and you train with him. You also pull Irakli. You say that you were not really ready for that match. But how is your objective opinion about this match?
SPEAKER_03: Paul's wrist, like very powerful wrist and very explosive starts. And while Irakli is a great top roller. So how does that match go? I think you are one of the best guys to ask these matches, you know, many of these matches. I think it could be close. It could be closer than people think. I mean, you would give Irakli a slight advantage because I think Paul would be underdog in this match. But Paul has...
SPEAKER_04: progress so much. I mean, last time I pulled him in practice was like maybe a year and a half ago. He's much, much better, much stronger. His wrist is stronger. His approach in the matches, it has been increased a lot. So he's in the progress, you know. I think it could be closer than people think this match. Paul's wrist is very strong right now. Okay, I am...
SPEAKER_04: We talked about the pros and cons putting Irakli and the way, you know, so he had a game in his mind, the way he can, you know, stop that match and make it a war and then win. I mean, Irakli is top row machine. Everybody knows where he goes. Do you think that Paul is trying to stop that match or Paul is trying to dominate Irakli? This is his plan, you know, because Paul is not catcher usually.
SPEAKER_04: Maybe he catches, but he suddenly goes. If he goes to catch, he will lose. I mean, anybody who goes forward will lose with Irakli. So he needs to have like a, I mean, I'm not going to say everything, but you know what he has to do. He got a shot. Basically, he got a shot at that match. It could go either way. I would say on paper, Irakli is like favorite to this match.
SPEAKER_03: But Bo has a really good chance. I have a message from Robbie Toppy. He says, I have competed at WAF twice, in 2001 and 2012, Brazil.
SPEAKER_03: also competed yeah so if if he competed 2001 wow you're talking about 22 years ago you know and he is good enough to compete wow so he's probably pulling minimum for like 25 years in easy easily you know it's been pulling for a long time i think i i me and him paul we did a couple finals in professional events over here around i mean robbie toppy i have been hearing him forever you know forever yeah but he said that he came back
SPEAKER_00: And then he went to WAF. I remember that. And Petrenko, Irakli vs. Pauline. Irakli is not going to be easy, that's for sure. I just think that he will go through Paul's bones.
SPEAKER_00: And that's how you win. But if Pauline stops him, then there will be serious problems in Iraq, and most likely he will lose.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, Oleg's saying that he will give a slight, slight edge to Irakli because he thinks that he will be able to pass the wrist of Paul Linn. But he said if Paul Linn will stop that with his wrist control, then Irakli will have huge, huge problems and most likely then Paul Linn is going to win. And Artem Taynov versus Grap Tavberidze, Marcio. Well, very, very
SPEAKER_04: incredible match on paper i would say uh tynov lately more explosive he's he got so much better in the technical aspect he became a really really really good i mean zurab is a bull he's very very strong his left is really good um
SPEAKER_04: it's uh i i would give a slight edge to the title of in this match just because you have more hand control and he can go more errors he's versatile he can go anywhere sudab is a hook puller but he he also you know drags with the you know without his wrist is really good i saw him doing like a few times but i think it's going to be a very no not easy match very good match like very hard match but i'll give a slight edge
SPEAKER_00: But it's very close, in my opinion. And Oleg? I think Zurab will come back even stronger and he will win. I will root for him. I give Zurab an advantage and wish him good luck.
SPEAKER_01: He said that Zurab probably will gonna come back even stronger. And he said that he believes that he will be strong enough to win this match. And he is cheering for Zurab and wishing him luck. And Oleg Zhokh versus Stutberg is there.
SPEAKER_03: Artangelo Tutberidze. Tutberidze is the current 85 kilo world champion, Marcio. A young guy, big hands, incredible top roll. And Oleg Zhokh was the... Super hard. Oleg Zhokh was the... He's super hard to pass against, Oleg Zhokh. Yeah. Oleg Zhokh, year before? Year before? 85 kilos is that? Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Oleg Zhokh won the 80 kilos and the Georgian kid won the 85, right? Yeah, Oleg Zhokh, year before at WAF, he took second. Yeah, he took second. And Talgat Akdev, do you know Talgat? The super-fast footballer, you know? He beat him in the final, in the WAF 2022.
SPEAKER_03: And then after that match, Oleg Zhokh went down to 80 kilos. He was in 85. He went down 80 kilos. And he won there while Avtandil came to the 85 buff. And he beat easily. He beat Viorel Dobrin and all others. Very dominant. It's incredible. Very good match. I mean,
SPEAKER_04: I still believe Oleg Gio will be ready for this because it's on him. It depends on what kind of shape. He's a mutant. His hand is so hard to deal, especially if you're going to top rope. You have to have such a strong hand to contain him a little bit.
SPEAKER_04: like the Deacon did. I mean, if you can't, if you can't have that, it's over. And I believe Oleg Joe slowly is getting better. Slowly, slowly. It's taking a big process after, you know, what happened and the accident. So I, I believe he's prepared for this match. I would give him, you know, 52, 55% of 45 to Oleg Joe for me. Yeah. And Oleg?
SPEAKER_00: Oleg Zhokh has no options. I think it would be an easy win for him with all due respect. But he's getting in good shape now. He's in pretty good shape. Better, in my opinion, than he was with David.
SPEAKER_01: Oleg is pretty conveniently said that Oleg Zhokh will win. He is gaining pretty good form and he said he is much better than he was with David Dedican and he believes that he will win pretty conveniently. Okay, I understand. And Daniel Prokopchuk versus the GOAT. Minda Mindaugas Tarasaitis.
SPEAKER_04: I say this because Mindaugas said that now he mastered the arm wrestling and he doesn't have anything to learn. So we are just joking. But in truth, he is, in my opinion, one of the best top rollers on this earth. Like pound for pound for sure. Mindaugas is the guy, like I have my friend that trained with me, Jason Merlo, who's slowly getting better and better. I tell him to look at Mindaugas the way he top roll, the way he avoids.
SPEAKER_04: uh getting hooked you know i thought i'm watching watch him watch him because he just have such a jason have such a strong hand they're like comparable but jason's just longer you know bigger but vindalga's is great top roller definitely one of the best specialists yeah yeah but now then you're talking about daniel preoccupied which is that he's so strong that little guy it's unbelievable how strong he is
SPEAKER_04: At that size. You wouldn't think, right? You wouldn't think that such power from him, right? When you look at him. No, it's a small frame and a guy. He's like a man and a half in a little body, like a kid's body. So he's so strong. It's incredible. I saw the way he trains. He's a doctor, right? Yes, yes. He's an orthopedic doctor. It's incredible the amount of power that he generates when he's pulling somebody.
SPEAKER_04: So definitely Daniel was stronger and more, uh, he's very technical too. Don't get me wrong. I mean, now August is a master. Definitely. Uh, he got his chances. It's very hard to say. I know probably people would say more towards more to Daniel because of his strength, but I think is very, very close. I think mean Douglas can make this match really ugly.
SPEAKER_03: Do you agree that the score doesn't always represent how hard the match is? The competition may be 4-0, but you can say it was a very close match. But some people just look at the result and they say he dominated him. He crushed him, but in fact, every round was very close. You have to analyze the rounds, every single match, every single round, because I think it's going to be a war. Every single one is going to be a war.
SPEAKER_04: Maybe, maybe, maybe later rounds, maybe. I don't know if it goes too long. Mindaugas maybe. Usually Daniel is the one who is known to have better address, but who knows? These guys are smart guys, you know? Yeah. He has to have a plan to exhaust Mindaugas to exhaust Daniel's hand, at least, you know, he has to have a plan that goes that way, like make his hand get tired because so he has more control.
SPEAKER_04: otherwise hard it's it's a very close but i i would say daniel's slight favorite because his endurance is also great uh but he could go either way yeah it's all right you you did it's a it's a great matchup i think yes yes better than those two only to me only alan uh doloev yeah and macaro i think and uh arthur
SPEAKER_03: Makarov also very good. We will see. Until they meet again, we will see. Because Cherkasov was great as well, but Mindaugas kind of dominated him. So we don't know what happened a few years ago, what happens today. But yeah, they are very good. And Oleg, how do you see Daniel versus Mindaugas?
SPEAKER_00: I think it can be a match of the evening, without exaggeration, for two very talented athletes, titled, strong. And it will be a very difficult match for them and for the judges. And in general, I think the threshold there will be very high. I can't even say who will win. It's hard to give any predictions for this match, because
SPEAKER_01: well like saying that they are uh they are very known very titled outlets one of the best satellites ever in a weight class and he said that this match is unpredictable it's going to be very long match possibly the match of the night and it's going to be hard very very hard match for both of the athletes and and the referees and he said it's almost unpredictable how it goes
SPEAKER_03: Okay, let's go to the next one. David Samushia versus Vladimir Maiorov. Samushia is so hard to beat. Unbelievable. Yeah, I am just doing my best to find someone to beat him.
SPEAKER_03: no success as of now in his category. I tried to do that and then I kind of had an accident and then I couldn't, but now I'm still trying. And David is like, is that best you can get? Best you can do, Engin? Bring a better one. And don't get me wrong. It's going to be a great match. I think it's going to be a great, great match. It's just that Samushia has so much endurance. He's so good. He can stay in the match forever.
SPEAKER_04: i gotta give him you know the edge also in this match i think the other guy is so strong but i think in the end samusha always find a way i think is he's a favorite again
SPEAKER_03: Is there no doubt Samushia? Still wrist, he said. That's it. Still wrist? Still wrist, yes. If I ever pull him, Samushia, especially the early rounds, I will change Petrenko's opinion.
SPEAKER_01: He and him is something different, but about the rest, I think I'm going to change his opinion. Engin says to you, you know, I'll try to change your mind. If I ever fight him again, I'll try to change your mind in the first few rounds. Okay, agreed. He said deal. He said deal? Yes. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Rino Macic versus Ivan Ivan Matyushenko. Great match. Hard to bet against Ivan Matyushenko, right? I mean, Rino is a rising star. He's doing so great at such a young age. Marcio, Marcio, have you ever pulled Ivan Ivan Matyushenko? No, we haven't. We never pulled. You need to have a match with him, 115 kilos. But...
SPEAKER_04: either right or left. Of course, you can pull both categories, 105, 115, but that is the match. How is your left doing right now? I think my left is really good. It's getting better. I'm just scared because I have a small tear on my front shoulder. I don't want to have any surgery. I just wanted to do a
SPEAKER_04: recovery and uh did you have no i only did once but before with uh i went to a different place before but now i'm gonna start having with uh with the vital cell and then i gotta recover my left my left it can still you know be really good it started getting better again yeah it just i avoid the pool uh to use what i used to do you know i used to lock so much
SPEAKER_03: And this is like, I'm not comfortable, you know? Yeah. To play at a high level, but I... Marcio, you are one of those goals, you understand? We need you as long as possible in the armwrestling world. You are one of those legends from 90s till today. Those are like, how to say, like collectible. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: you know yeah you need we need to save you guys you know and so that we can see you guys more years you know like like i i don't mean any disrespect to young athletes but if the absence of one young athlete an absence of someone like you in my book is not the same you know
SPEAKER_03: you know when we talk about marcio barbosa we're talking about 30 years you know in arm wrestling and it is for me very important like same as john like every i don't care he wins he loses i see him there it's something different for me you know just like it it really still inspires me but i don't want him to pull 95 kilo he kind of get a little bit uh smaller
SPEAKER_04: I think he dropped too much weight in the last one. And you can see it was too much, you know. At that age, you're back to, you know. Yeah, yeah. So who's winning, Rino or Ivan? I think Ivan Matyushenko. I think Rino is great. Don't get me wrong. He's great. He's 19 years old and he's doing amazing already at this such a young age. I mean, he should be proud of himself. He's already beating everybody at WAF at his own weight category. But Ivan Matyushenko is...
SPEAKER_03: I'll be surprised. Let's put it this way. I'll be surprised if he really beats him. So I believe Matyushenko is... That's the beauty of the life, right? If everything goes as expected, you know, life, okay, good. But sometimes, you know, when you see something, you say, wow, you know. If you see Ivan winning, you are not going to say, wow, right? Uh-huh. Yeah, no. But if you see Rino winning, you will say, wow, you know. Yeah, it's like, wow, he's really...
SPEAKER_00: And Petrenko? I think Rino will be the winner. He is versatile, he fights with different techniques, he is very fast. And most importantly, he progresses every year. I've been following him for a long time, and he gets stronger and stronger every time. Ivan Matyushenko is a stylish, well-titled athlete, but I give Rino an advantage.
SPEAKER_01: uh all the things that uh reno will win because he was following him for a long time and he said that his progress uh is amazing and he he can pull pretty much anywhere and he said that yes matushenko is very titled athlete and very good athlete but uh he thinks that uh reno's progress is so fast that he will be able to to win this match
SPEAKER_03: Wow. It was surprising to hear that. It was very surprising that, you know, he is sure that Rino is going to win. Engin, Engin, I have about five, seven minutes left, if you don't mind. Only four matches left. John Bersing versus Krasimir. I think it's going to be, oh my God, John and Krasimir again. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Awesome that you make that match happen. Could go either way. I mean, I would... So hard because Krazy is not like Sancho. That's another match that, you know, you are very expert about it. Yeah, because Krazy is so good here, too. At supinating, hooking you. But he's not like Sancho. I believe Sancho has so much here. It's just weird, different. But...
SPEAKER_00: I would say 50-50. And Petrenko? John Brazan. I think he will win because he is stronger and he will be uncomfortable for Krasimir. I want John to win after this poor loss from Sashon.
SPEAKER_01: he said that uh john uh he believes that john uh uh stronger and very uncomfortable for crazy and he said that i really want that uh john would win after this uh uncomfortable for him uh losing to uh sasha yeah okay i understand yeah you know normally i don't do i don't try to i try not to share my opinion
SPEAKER_04: Should I say? No, I will not say. Okay, let's go this one. Artem Morozov versus Alex Kurdecha. Marcio. It's hard to predict because it's hard to see, like, I don't know what kind of shape they are. Like, Alex Kurdecha, it's been for a long time away, right? And Morozov, we already know he's a monster, especially in the left arm. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: believe it's difficult it's hard for me to predict but um i'm just gonna guess motors off because he's more versatile just because of that but he probably can go either way and patrick
SPEAKER_01: He said 50-50. He said that it should have been Kurdecha, but Artyom was surprising us lately so many times that he said probably or possibly he will surprise us this time too.
SPEAKER_03: Okay. This match I want to start with Oleg. Oleg. This is my favorite match in this card. Alizhan Muratov, Evgeny Prudnik. Look at his face. Everybody's face is the same about this match. Oleg, is it like this, Oleg? I'm in pain because of Prudnik. Uh-huh.
SPEAKER_00: He wants Prudnik to win? He's cheering for Prudnik, yes. Yes, yes, as expected. If Prudnik stops Alizhan, I think there will be a sound.
SPEAKER_00: Oleg, wait a second, I lost the sound. One second, Oleg. Yes, if Alizhan pulls to the pillow, once again. Yes, if Alizhan pulls to the pillow with a start, then it is clear that he won. If Prudnik stops him, I think the victory will be for Prudnik, because I fought for Alizhan, and his endurance is not very strong, as well as mine.
SPEAKER_00: That's why. And Prudnik told Dadikyan that he's very muscular. And that's his weight that allows him to be muscular. Okay. 50 to 50.
SPEAKER_01: he said it is 50 50 but a little more details to that he said that if alijan will be able to uh you know pull him straight to the pad and he will finish will be able to finish him then yes for sure alijan will win but if prudnik will be able to stop it somewhere uh he said that he will most likely uh over endure uh alijan because uh prudnik at that weight
SPEAKER_03: is very very endure and he proved it already with uh uh that he can and he believes that is it is it does it show that uh prudnik's endurance so good or does it also maybe like that he can is also explosive puller and maybe not super endured you know like maybe not super endurance
SPEAKER_01: Does it show that Prudnik has such endurance on such a high level? Or maybe it shows that Dadikyan is so fast and does not have very good endurance? As far as I know, Prudnik has always been strong, even when he gained a lot of weight.
SPEAKER_00: Well, I can't say anything for Dadikyan, but I know that he lost a lot of weight, and maybe because of that he gained a lot of weight and was unbearable.
SPEAKER_01: He said, yeah, it can go both ways. But I know Prudnik very well. And he said, even when he was gaining a lot of weight, Prudnik, he was still very injured. And at this weight, he's very comfortable. And about Dadikyan, he said, yeah, maybe you're right. Because he was losing a lot of weight. Then he was gaining weight. And maybe that compromised his endurance. But he said that Prudnik is a very, very endurable athlete. So he says that Alizhan is 50% coming from the flash pin possibility.
SPEAKER_04: And Prudnik's coming from the, because he stops the match and he will probably beat you. And Marcio, before the last match. Very hard. Those matches are very hard to predict. I think Aljan is quicker, more explosive than Prudnik. Prudnik has more endurance and his hook is really solid. Aljan can...
SPEAKER_03: you know top rope runic it's his best shot and uh with the no no no there's no way there's nobody's trouble and nobody in that match you think you go both you go like that right i mean alijan is with right arm he top rolls he goes open on top left arm is like more like side pressure you know yeah
SPEAKER_03: But who knows? Who knows? Maybe he's training different for this one. Maybe. I think it's a close match. I don't think he would just stop doing his best thing and then focus on something. Because, I mean, Brutnik is going to catch him, you know, if he just started to do... If he just started to do a couple, yeah. I believe I would... It's so 50-50 this match.
SPEAKER_04: But I'll just guess Alizhan. Okay, the last match. Last match. Let's start with you, Marcio. Dadikyan versus Tad. I think it's a great match on paper, especially because the deacon has a stronger hand. I think Tad was impressed with Ongarbaev.
SPEAKER_04: right i think he's gonna be impressed too with the deacon he has a lot of hand control so but i believe todd it's it's the favorite for this match also just because his endurance and because that he can never pull somebody like todd it's so weird he's gonna
SPEAKER_04: He had a chance to flash ping Todd in the beginning, you know. But Todd, lately, he's been explosive too. You saw against Ongarbaev. He's been different, you know. He's going back a little more. His pronator, it's already at a start ready. You know, he's going back a little more. Yeah. He's giving no chance for his opponents. And I believe he's going to win this match too. And Petrenko?
SPEAKER_00: Todd Hutchings. I think Todd Hutchings has won. Because in the last fight he showed that he is in great shape. He is very strong. He fights almost at the top. I was a little surprised. He is now number one for me. 105.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, he said that Todd Hutchings will win and he was surprising all of us with his almost top rolling. His opponent, his last match, his endurance was insane and he believes that he's number one in 105 as of right now. He's in perfect form, perfect shape. So he says that Todd is going to win? Yes.
