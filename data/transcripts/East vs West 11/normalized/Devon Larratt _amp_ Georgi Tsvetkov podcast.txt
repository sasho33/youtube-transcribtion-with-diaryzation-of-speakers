SPEAKER_01: I mean, he's much advanced right now. The guy is just like, I mean, you like him, you don't like him, but just accept he's the, I mean, the pound for pound is the best guy, most dangerous guy. And probably the second best to John Brzenk in history. The guy is just scary, you know, right now. The guy is good.
SPEAKER_01: there are many things that I and him we disagree especially his trash talk uh when it crosses the border according to me but you know you need to also tell how good he is you know I mean like many people they want to go only like black or white but nothing in between that we need to all consider that we
SPEAKER_01: Positive size, negative size, of course, including me. I'm impatient, aggressive, you know, many, many negative size. I also have, but I probably have positive size as well. Yeah. So, Devon. Devon wouldn't like if I left this match. What makes that T-shirt behind you so special for East versus West?
SPEAKER_01: Ah, no, it is just one of the examples, you know, it's not like it could be another one, but yeah. Giorgi or Gennady, different, different, different ways, my friend. Giorgi, but Gennady is, he can pull in any position while Giorgi is a specialist, you know, he's a top row specialist. While Gennady can pull in almost all possible ways.
SPEAKER_01: When will Devon join? I told him he should join in seven minutes. My health is okay, fine. Thank you very much for caring. Georgi is taking very seriously. Georgi is doing three times a day table training. The guy is just, these Bulgarians are, yep, Kurdecha is pulling in January, yes.
SPEAKER_01: Good evening, Atlas. What can I do if I have a weak hand? You need to make it stronger. Engin, you make things happen that is main positive for us. That is, there are two types of people. One talks, one walks. And there are some people like Muhammad Ali or even now Devon, talks and walks at the same time, you know.
SPEAKER_01: um yeah East versus West 10 trading cards yeah this is probably the best event in history there are some left I would um I think moderators will I don't know maybe I have the link as well let me see um but uh whatever um you can find it yeah it's in the um website East versus West
SPEAKER_01: Yep, pronation. Thank you, thank you. Can Giorgi be the second guy who will take Devon's wrist? Giorgi is very dangerous, but we will see. SteezyBK, just checking in to say hello again.
SPEAKER_01: and hope you are doing well today also thanks for all you do it is much appreciated back to work take care thank you thank you for your support my friends again i do this and this is happening only because of your support but when i say sports don't think only financially financially yes it's the like uh probably the most important uh factor but also
SPEAKER_01: your motivation you know to me you know whenever i see many people with the same passion that i have then it motivates me like there are people that you know sharing the common passion so i need to work harder you know um i will i will announce the cards right now i'm focused on uh king of the table
SPEAKER_01: It is out of respect. I need to. Hello, Angela, what you are doing for the sport? I don't miss any sort of table. I have one question for you. David you share the call for help from his wife? I didn't share.
SPEAKER_01: anything my friend my own cousin is also fourth level cancer i'm more focused on that and i know we all have all of us family problems i also have my own cousin yeah ahmed very young guy he's i think 38 or something
SPEAKER_01: as a wife and a daughter you know i'm also trying to do this we all are um have been some personal family problems my friends here i try to not to bring to people because that's my kind of personal thinking no i don't look handsome thank you can you recommend how to fix low risk pain i think over pity we all suffer the same thing you know
SPEAKER_01: i think i think first you need to wait long time and then slowly train there but many people they fall down from the 10th floor and they try to jump to 10th floor right away just because pain is gone and then they try again they get hurt again so you need to make the area stronger again um
SPEAKER_01: I mean, I said Levan match with Morozov, but Levan got injured, you know. That is not a bad thing that, you know, not that I didn't set it, but the guy got injured, you know. Thank you, Shurotria, my friend. Thank you, Aditya. Thank you, my friend. Yeah, I will ask that, Georgi. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: is daddy can put it the east versus west 11 i will announce that but right now i'm like mostly focused on uh um king of the table the incredible matches that that lalatin versus hermes was already a main event incredible and now we have two main events in the same event which is lalatin versus hermes and devon versus georgie swedco
SPEAKER_01: Hello, Victor. Hello, Victor. Thank you, Andrew. Thank you, my friend. Hello, Linn Pride Armasinghe. Hello. Engin, I'm ready. You are ready? Yes. You are ready to beat Devin? Yes, of course. You're going to crush him, right? His belt is going to Bulgaria.
SPEAKER_01: yeah yeah this this is what we need to do yeah yeah yeah you will see yeah yeah can you turn the phone sideways like that yeah yeah yeah it's better yeah my static tableau strength yeah okay now let me focus more on my guests and then then we can
SPEAKER_01: talk more and okay guys so guys um you know even you use uh collagen you know that you still need a lot of vitamin c right to send us you know the collagen yes and then then every time i see a lemon
SPEAKER_01: then i think of you i don't know i don't even understand how it is possible that you don't even like make your face look like you know it is just like sour or something you know i think that all the food is healthy and when i know that it helps me i just eat it yeah so
SPEAKER_01: with the time you get used with the taste and it's good yeah one second i don't know why this is happening but yeah i think i found it yeah yeah so the lemon that when you eat like i have never seen i'm 49 years old never seen anyone throwing the lemon with the outside and then it's like not even making his
SPEAKER_01: face like hanging for everything there is first time you know you think you think yeah i i i love like for example tangerine i love but i have some stomach issues that lemon is even kind of a little bit too far uh for me to eat but tangerine if it is sweet now i'm eating that what is that forearm what is that that that's the
SPEAKER_01: Wow. It's after training. After training. No, no, just show it a little bit this way. Like this. The right arm, right arm. Oh, yeah. Wow, it looks really, really big, yeah. I'm becoming bigger, bigger and stronger with every each day. And then you still have three weeks. Yeah, yeah. I have a question for you. In three weeks,
SPEAKER_01: Do you think you will be even stronger than when you pulled against Zaur? Today I was in the gym and I tried to lift some weights. I was about 10% stronger than before the match with Zaur. Do you know why you are 10% stronger? Because I rested for 5 days. Yeah, because you rested. Before the event you rested and after the event you rested and during that rest you are totally healed up and now probably you are, as you said, stronger. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I tried biceps, a little shoulder press. I'm stronger everywhere.
SPEAKER_01: Okay. So somebody is in really, really, really, really trouble. And imagine that if I was ref in that match, then he would be, I would make the, the webbing, the equal. He couldn't go up like this. I would make him. And then now, now listen, the older Devon fans will attack me now on the, uh, they will destroy you. Don't talk. Uh, yeah. Uh, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: anyway so good that i will be only um my friend whenever i devon's forearm whenever i do this from the zoom two guys it it's it doesn't stay together i don't know why but when now devon comes then he said that he will be five minutes late and then he will be we all will be on the uh screen yeah yeah it's not for me i just stayed i can be all night here don't worry yeah yeah
SPEAKER_01: yeah anyway so his wrist will be like that again you see that again yeah yeah like that and after that and then and then and then open yep yep i don't think that he's uh so powerful in this position like jerry oh no no if you take if you take his list it's over
SPEAKER_01: If you take his wrist, it is over, you know, but can you take his wrist? David you see his video? No. David you see his video? Which one? He made a lot of videos for me. No, last night he made a video like... No, I didn't see it. Okay, there is one suggestion. Daniel Dodson, Georgie has too much fat and not enough quality. This is what he says. Do you agree with him?
SPEAKER_01: for now yes but i have too much fat but i'm also very strong so much muscle as well right yeah okay look look look at he calls you georgie fat cop fat cop yeah and then he he says now just one second i'm turning sound on so you can you can watch
SPEAKER_03: fat cough match, and I'm going to do my exact precise prediction round by round. Okay, so I'm not really sure. That's how hard I think it's going to be. I'm going to do a dentist match, do a good workout, and I think I'm just going to chill out and kind of go for walks. Just take it easy.
SPEAKER_04: Round one. Round one, we get to the table. You will never hear a guy whine and cry and complain as much as Geordie Swatkoff will. This guy, he's gonna be so flustered. He's gonna be so, like, uncomfortable.
SPEAKER_04: he's just going to be crying and crying mark my you're going to hear a guy cry like you've never heard anybody cry i won't want him to be fouled out that will eventually well the rest i'm sure will probably foul them just because it's not gonna grip at all but eventually they're gonna say they're gonna say go either low or actor
SPEAKER_03: Paul me over. Paul me over. And I'm going to read your better name. After every surgery does, I'll get a little bit more. This is going to repeat 20, 25 seconds. And then I'm going to start talking to him. I'll start talking to him.
SPEAKER_04: what he's doing, how he's feeling, other than what he likes to do. And he'll probably give me round two. Similar to round one, however, he won't pull me too far. Let me pop again after I start talking to him. Round three.
SPEAKER_01: There's no point in even starting the match at this point. I have everything. I have every single piece by round three. Okay. Basically, he says that, like, he will be down already by round three. Just listen. Mask him just hold him, take his wrist, look at his face, and then tell him, what you are going to do to me?
SPEAKER_02: Just tell me again. No, no, no. I will ask him who is the champ. Oh, you will ask him who is the champ? Yeah, when I talk to him, I will ask him. Baby, who is the champ? Devon, tell me who is the champ? Yeah. I like his confidence, but his confidence is too big. Too big, right? Yes, yes.
SPEAKER_01: If he was so confident, why he didn't want to pull in Turkey when you was the referee? Because I was the referee. I was making the web in the same height. No, no. I intentionally put the strap back to the wrong side there so you guys wouldn't pull, you know. Yeah. Yeah. Listen, you need to destroy him, okay?
SPEAKER_01: And I told him already, I'm not the organizer. And then I will be as hard as possible on him this evening, you know. And yeah. Yeah. So how is the training? Who are you training with? David you train with any of the top guys or with your own team? Yesterday I trained in Sofia with Stoyan Guamanov.
SPEAKER_02: We had two hours training with his team. Today I trained weights and sparring with my students. And tomorrow I'm going to Krasimir and Sasho in Tutrakan for eight days. Wow. It's Krasimir and Tutrakan, right? Yeah, man. We were making one training with Sasho, one training with Krasimir. Two times every day. But you're gonna ask them to more likely to... Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course, of course. Yeah, okay, okay.
SPEAKER_01: Because those two are basically hook pullers, you know, that's why I'm saying, you know. Maybe you need to make the pad a little bit bigger so they would be tall hand. Yeah, but Sasho is also very good on right hand on top row. Topie row, but you need to put extra pads. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. We're going to be team up and then beat Devon. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Listen, the guy is just really good. Joking aside, he's really good. I know you are very good too, but the guy, I think in his prime, he's very dangerous. I know that. Yeah, like pound for pound to me,
SPEAKER_01: He's the best on the earth, you know, pound for pound. I'm not saying you cannot beat him, but like you guys are not in the same weight. If you would be at his weight, you know, he's just for like 100, 15, 120 kilo guy. He is very, very strong. Very, very strong. Yeah, very good arm master as well, you know, yeah. Hey, Devon, where are you? You said you will be five minutes late. It is 10 minutes. It is Turkish time, 2310, you know.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah. Yeah. Anyways, so... What? You know that I'm also coming to Dubai, right? Yeah, I know. I saw that your student Nisa will compete there. Yeah, and Arif too. Nice. Arif, yeah, also. With Matyushenko. Matyushenko, yeah. How do you see that match? I think Arif will destroy him. You think? Yes.
SPEAKER_02: almost posh in every every game it's my opinion very dangerous start right if you don't know how to stop him he will destroy you he's very strong and very clever he's yep yeah okay we will see not not much left yeah three weeks
SPEAKER_01: okay he said that he said that uh he said three more minutes yeah yeah anyway so the guy is coming very soon and then we can really put some pressure on him let's see
SPEAKER_01: yeah since i'm not the organizer so i kind of feel free to yeah yeah we will see you will see i think he came yeah you finally here one second one second okay i hope you guys can hear me
SPEAKER_04: yeah we're in the ottawa open okay i'm gonna go outside but milo has one more match and he's a side winner okay okay one more man
SPEAKER_04: i'm sorry steve barno steve marno i'm sorry but my god it's good max we can't we can't hear it's too loud i'm gonna go outside but if you guys wanna do you want me to mute yeah after one match come come back and then you want me to come back yeah later just do the one match for my watch and then come back okay
SPEAKER_01: Two minutes. Two minutes. Two minutes. Okay. Two minutes. I know you have very good endurance with right arm. Your endurance with right arm, you can pull forever. Like you and Jerry, and I know Jerry can pull too. I think like you and him pull like the
SPEAKER_01: the match announcement and then the end of the match was like near an hour you know 54 minutes 54 minutes yeah yeah and then actual match was also maybe near 10 minutes probably people were were thinking that if he stops me after the first round i will guess out but i didn't feel the last match i was the guy who was attacking
SPEAKER_02: yeah you have very good endurance the only thing is that like will you be able to get the hand wrist control yeah yeah this is the the main problem for me because he's making tricks you know movements he's very tricky i'm i'm i'm sure that i will destroy his list because you you really believe you will take his risk you will take it of course we
SPEAKER_02: We played in England after Poole. Now I'm much stronger than them. I know, I know, I know. So he is in trouble. So you are the guy who is going to ruin the match between Lewand and Devon. Let's hope so. I think that I have all the power, all the skills.
SPEAKER_02: And I'm also confident, but let's hope that he will not overtake me this time again. Because he's very dangerous. It is between you, Ref, and Devin. Does George still believe he can beat Levan? Yes, if I'm very well prepared.
SPEAKER_01: I think that I can beat him. I have all what is needed to beat him. Yeah. Daniel Dawson, Georgie, will you be upset if he top rolls you? Yes, I will be very upset. Yeah. But just can you think this way that, um,
SPEAKER_01: yeah you are stronger when you did the after pull with him but do you also remember that only five days ago he had a super match with uh hermes and then after that he pulled a lot with prudnik with me with some other people but i think he was not also he wasn't also in his ideal shape but you both will be probably stronger than the last time but you are thinking you are thinking that you will be more stronger compared to his progress
SPEAKER_01: Engin, I think that now I'm in the best shape of my life. No, I have no doubt. I have no doubt. The only problem is that even... I will tell you this. When Lewand beat Devon, the first round, Lewand attacked fully outside. And whenever he came to pimp it, it was like one centimeter. And Lewand's wrist also was a little bit... I know, I know. Yeah, yeah. So what I just said is...
SPEAKER_01: Devon today, don't get me wrong. I'm going to be honest. When Devon comes, I will be just all over attacking him. Don't worry about it. But right now, between us, the guy is stronger than that time. You understand? Yeah. The guy is stronger than that time because he has more center. He has more insight. His elbow is healed up. He can do shoulder press. He can do anything right now. Anything he can do. So he is stronger right now than that time.
SPEAKER_02: So, and then I know that you don't have this side pressure like Levan that he did in the round two, but you will mostly go outside. But also your wrist is very strong, you know. I think that my wrist is stronger than Levan because all my matches against Levan, I all the time take his wrist and he beats me side pressure. In the past. I always manage to take his wrist and he's beating me like that.
SPEAKER_01: with uh the citation i understand yeah it's gonna be crazy much and listen i like your mindset that you really believe that you're gonna destroy his wrist like without believing without doubting yourself you cannot do that even you had that you have the power to do it if you have doubts then you will lose that opportunity but now i see that you believe that and it's good i think a great match is waiting and i think it will be very very tough match
SPEAKER_01: I know, I know. Yeah. How about your endurance? I think my endurance is
SPEAKER_02: is very high level because when i go in the in the in the training i start first i uh train two hours sparring sparring with all the people you know until the end i can still manage to pull the same the same way you know for big for big guy i have very big endurance because usually the big guys uh are not so uh good with the endurance yeah i think that one is back here
SPEAKER_04: So what happened? Milo won? No, he's going to win. He's going to win. But there's 709 entries. It's a massive event. There's like 50 people in his class. So he's going to still be pulling. So I can't keep holding you guys up. But I'll go back in there. I mean, for me, it's no problem. What's the matter with you? You look constipated or something. What the fuck is wrong with you? Artem you okay?
SPEAKER_04: yeah what the is wrong with you man i just i just i just already motivated him he's ready to destroy you oh my god he doesn't need any motivation this guy listen georgie relax man i'm not even training i'm not even working out you're over here listen i'm just gonna show up i'm i'm not even working out this is how serious i'm taking you i should probably take you something kind of serious right what are you ranked right now fourth
SPEAKER_04: how is it possible that nobody's betting on you and it's a shutout stake how is that even possible I don't know Devon I have no idea I don't know either why does nobody think you're gonna win not even you people think that you are very strong the most the best now but we will see my God
SPEAKER_04: Listen, just don't hurt yourself, okay? Don't hurt yourself. Believe me. It's not worth it. It's not worth it. Touching that crown is not worth it. Just relax. Let it pass. Go back to regular life. Devon, I'm dreaming your belt every night. You're dreaming of me every night? No, no, your belt. Of the belt? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, that's just a dream.
SPEAKER_04: after dubai it's coming to bulgaria no georgie don't be ridiculous you know if you win this one you are permanently having the superior weight belts well that'll be great georgie listen just calm down calm down and relax okay just just another day man just another day yeah
SPEAKER_04: I can see you're working hard. All I have to do is look at you. I can see. I can see everything I need to see. There's a certain shine. Yeah. But don't hurt yourself, man. Don't hurt yourself. Life is long. Okay, what happened after the pull? What happened after the pull? He says that first a couple of times he beat you and then you started doing this. How was it? You tell me, Devon. Oh, he killed me. He killed me. He's way stronger than me.
SPEAKER_04: no everybody should bet on him he murdered me he's gonna kill me hey look at how much do you weigh georgie like he outweighs me like over a hundred pounds he murdered me i'm just a little tiny terrible arm wrestler they won't can i ask you for something yeah to give you one challenge
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, what is it? You are more tricky than me. Can you be fair on the grip in Dubai? Oh, stop it. What are you insinuating? What are you insinuating? I am the most fair. I'm the most fair guy you will ever meet. I just refuse to be cheated myself. I'm a fair guy. You are very dangerous. The referee standard of East versus West and a king of the table, you don't need to worry about or complain about anything. They have everything covered.
SPEAKER_02: georgie georgie today he made a video i mean yesterday and he said that you will be crying a lot do you know what that means yeah i know what that means you tell us what what that means that he will be the stronger one that i will complain because of the referees that i will because of the referees maybe yeah no it doesn't mean that no you will be listen georgie i've i have already watched enough of your matches
SPEAKER_04: that I hear how you cry when you arm wrestle. Some people are fighters. Some people like to cry. Unfortunately, you fall into the cry baby category. It's okay. Whenever I was laughing, whenever I was laughing, who was crying?
SPEAKER_04: No limits. He was the guy. You call that repping? That's not repping. That is some bias. Your weapon was like high. I was like, wow. Stop it. You put the buckle on backwards, Engin. You're in no position to talk about that. Do you know why? Because you're not a good referee and you don't know how to earn it. No, it's just because I didn't want you guys to pull.
SPEAKER_04: Good, because that was... Hey, is Miles still killing it? Yes. He failed to win you a trophy. Oh, don't sweat it, buddy. Buddy, we hit the middle. Maynard. Oh, hey. Hey, George. You're good. He's going to... Look at this guy. He's going to stand up. He's going to stand up. You better learn how to do that. These guys stay over in Bulgaria and think they know how to arm wrestle. Well, Engin does. Yeah, Engin's not bad, but he's in Turkey. Yeah, yeah. Engin is not that bad. I don't know what they're doing. Engin is not that bad, but don't make me talk. Don't make me talk. Oh.
SPEAKER_04: I'm like four inches taller than normal right now. Anyways, I'm still looking forward to it. To me, this is like a vacation. It's just like a vacation match. Show up, beat Georgie, come home. David you see what happened to Zaur? Zaur just blew his bicep off. Zaur is like... Zaur and me, not the same. Not at all the same.
SPEAKER_04: zaur i mean he just had surgery he had major surgery we don't even know where he is devon yeah you beat him before his surgery as well well i don't know i'm looking georgie should kill me everybody who who thinks oh we got some bulgarian studs right here hey guys you know this guy you know these young studs
SPEAKER_04: guys he does one thing he does only one thing he does one thing man i'm supposed to have fans here in canada we're not getting a bunch of bulgarians come by it's terrible it's terrible
SPEAKER_04: Those kids are really good, by the way. They're really good. See you guys. But just because you got fans over here in Canada, don't think that that matters, Georgie. Don't think that that matters. I see you're really fucking fired up. I can see it. I can see it. People should go over and bet some money on you. They should. Georgie, tell us what you will do to his wrist. Show it again. Like this?
SPEAKER_04: But do you know what he said, Devin? Devin, he said that he will take your wrist for sure, and you don't have Jerry's press, so you will lose. Yeah. I can do anything. Anything. I can do every move, any style, any way. I can flop wrist press. I can King's move. I can hook. I can top roll. Georgie, I got everything.
SPEAKER_04: Ten weapons. Ten weapons for your one. Ten for your one. You can be a stronger top roller. Yeah, yeah, we know. You've got a great top roll. You've got a great top roll. Good luck getting me all the way to the pad four times. Good luck. I have one weapon, but it's very strong. You're going to have a heart attack round two. The way you look right now, round two, your fucking heart is going to explode on the sideline.
SPEAKER_04: good luck good luck i'll probably come in 260 265 my stomach is already going away nice and light nice and light champion of the world georgie champion of the world devon i have i have a question that your belly looked a little bit like fat you know when you were here is it because of it or or because you put a belt because of your rib
SPEAKER_01: I don't know what you're going to say. Do I look fat, guys? I just eat a lot of sugar in the last few weeks. When I eat a lot of sugar, I get fat very quick. I thought because you had a problem with your rib. I thought that you put some belt on. There was that, but it's better. I'm healed now. My rib is good now. But you didn't put any belt or something just to protect the injury? No. No, I'm good. I'm good. George, I hope you're ready, buddy. I hope you're ready.
SPEAKER_04: i feel like you should tell people and make people believe because right now i don't think anybody believes they should what you're ranked like number four or something in the world i don't know why me and everybody else is looking like this is a vacation match to me people say that you are too too strong for me but i believe in other things i did believe in my heart that i can beat you
SPEAKER_02: you really believe that yes really yes why would you think that georgie because with every each day i become stronger bigger and my dream for the belt is my main goal you know you're gonna you're gonna destroy him i tell you that i will destroy him but
SPEAKER_04: It's good. It's good that you think that. Because it's good to have the thought at least. The reality, I mean, do you remember when we arm wrestled, Georgie? Yeah, I remember. On the left? Yeah. Do you remember how quick I smashed you?
SPEAKER_02: I remember, but my left compared to my right is... I don't even train my left. I train my left. I train my right. Devon, did you see Zaur and Georgi's left arm? Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_02: Zaur was playing, but the right arm was... Zaur beat him even much easier than you beat him. David you see how I played with him on the left? Yeah, but again, I played with 10 people before I catch Zaur with left. Oh, is it? I played with 10 people. Oh, Zaur never told me this. Zaur never told me this. I played with Gamil, with a lot of people. Okay, so it doesn't count. But anyways, Georgie, do you remember how I destroyed you?
SPEAKER_00: yes i remember don't forget and you remember what happened oh but it was it was good you'll see it all afterwards hey everybody he's still in georgie oh it looks like he's gonna explode so shiny did you put makeup on just for the show it looks really bold
SPEAKER_04: It's just too hot in my place. Be careful, Georgie. He's still in it. There's like seven more matches until done, so he's going to be up like any second. Wow. I thought it was the last one match. What's that? I thought it was the last one match. Seven matches from now. Seven matches, he's up. Georgie, listen to me. You're going to regret all of this.

John Augustine, when life gives you lemonade, make lemonade. Okay.
SPEAKER_01: And Benji, Pumpkin King versus Lemon King. I am Madhouse. Will Devon stop Levan at the center? Will you stop him at the center? He may not even get to pull Levan. George is going to kill him. George is going to knock him. George is going to explode before he gets to Dubai. No, no, no. Be careful. I feel strong.
SPEAKER_01: i hate hearing about people have heart attacks be careful be careful um jeremy coleman is devon prepared for georgie exploding lemon techniques and right he got i know everybody knows but oh and jeremy coleman devon no lemons
SPEAKER_01: No other superchats. So you can go watch your son. And next time, when you give me time, give me free time, understand? Because a thousand people... Hey, I love you guys. But really, I mean, that's all you got to know. Devon, Devon. I am certainly going to beat you, Georgie. Devon, remember this. Remember this. You see this movement? Remember it. Forget about it, Georgie. Like that. Forget about it.
SPEAKER_01: Forget all about it, Giorgi. You're going to feel a level of ferocity you've never felt on that table. Rest up, buddy, and come in healthy. I'll be waiting for you. See you. Thank you. Okay, I'm coming for you. Don't go anywhere, Giorgi. Let's talk a little bit. Okay, I'm hearing you. Yeah. You know, this is going to be interesting, but you need to be, like, how confident are you
SPEAKER_02: You are confident? Very confident, thank you. How did you describe your winning as a miracle? Because from his side you meant, right? No, no, I wanted to say that he believes in his world that he will destroy me very easy. And imagine if in his world he was. What do you have with his big mouth? So miracle from his perspective, not your perspective. Yes, yes, not for me, for him. Because he is 100% sure that he will destroy me.
SPEAKER_01: yeah and if he imagine something uh go wrong what will happen with his big mouth tell me i i think i think it is going to be very very i will tell you something whenever you pull against him to be honest i talked with neil and he said that maybe first couple times you pin him but like he's neil wasn't sure that if devon was really super trying
SPEAKER_01: And after that, he started to have control when you do after pull. And... Like that. Oh, under the table? Something like that, yeah. Yeah. So I don't know how the rule goes at the King or the table. Over here at the East versus West is a direct foul. But I don't know how it goes. So you are saying that without going under the table, you had the full control? Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: he's he couldn't do anything to my wrist the game was like that you see like that he had zero control over my hands my hand control was 100 over his you know he was stopping me like that
SPEAKER_01: Not here. Here it goes like that. Okay. Just imagine that, you know, Mithal going below table, but he goes like this. Not like this. It's a foul, but like this. So do you think that in such case, who is going to guess out? He will guess out or you will guess out? Who will get tired? If I have bigger hand control, I think that I will keep pushing to the end. My right arm is totally different than my left. Totally different.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah. Wow. I think it will be very, very, very tough match, you know. And just to tell you something, when we played on left, I wasn't training my left arm. I was preparing my right arm for the world in Kazakhstan. This is big difference. I understand. No need to go into detail. Yeah. I focused only on my right arm because I want to conquer everything with my right. World, after that super match, the belt, you know.
SPEAKER_01: My left arm was just resting. So now he came here and then he repeated the same thing. You have zero chance. You have zero chance. David he get in your mind? David he get into your mind? David he intimidate you? Enters here, goes out here. Okay. So you are confident with your abilities. Yeah, yeah. I'm total maniac about the win and I don't care about his mind games. They don't work on me, you know.
SPEAKER_01: it will not work so i see only the belt the win and to come home nothing you are you are so focused and yes yeah okay yes so
SPEAKER_02: And whatever the videos he will be sharing from now on to the event, will it have any effect on you? No, right? No. I'm laughing when I see them and I'm happy. Because he's the guy who is attacking me. Maybe he's a little afraid. When he talks, he's confident, but why is he making these videos? They don't work on me. I'm just quiet, training, eating, sleeping and we will see.
SPEAKER_02: And you felt his hand, right hand? And you know how much you progressed since that time? And now... Engin, during the summer, when I was playing with Krasimir in Kukon, right? We were like that, you know. Before the match with Zaur, I couldn't feel Krasimir's side. Also Sasho. I may be much, much more powerful. Okay, okay.
SPEAKER_01: So okay, I understand you are in incredible shape and you have every right to be so confident and you felt his right arm before and then you are saying that you will give him a nightmare for sure. He will not be like you know you will be exhausted after round one or two as he claims.
SPEAKER_02: No. No, okay. You saw what I did to Jerry, I wasn't exhausted. Till the end, I was the guy attacking and I worked with false. Yeah. And something else he said that Zohr is not the same, we don't know his level. Three, four months ago,
SPEAKER_02: He was second in OMC. He almost beat Lovett in the final. They had a difficult match. This was four months ago. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, let's see. So we know where Zouris is. He's second place in OMC and he had four more months to recover. Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: And I thought that my match will be much harder against him. I was surprised how easy I won the match, you know. It was very easy for me. I was surprised for myself. I just told him and after that, nothing. I understand, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, there is a super chat. Matthew Day. Thank you. Georgie, don't be overconfident with that practice pool. It's a trap. And I am saying that as a Devon fan, good luck. I don't think that he is overconfident because of the practice pool alone. But I think that Georgie is over, he's confident because of the progress you have seen that time. Yeah. And then
SPEAKER_01: Because now you don't compete the amateur events. Now you're more focused on the professional. And then you are saying that you are saying that recently you just did a gym training. And compared to the before Zaur match, you lifted 10% heavier. Evgeny more. And I was very, I feel very good in the gym. You know, no pain everywhere. Very confident. I feel great, you know.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And this is a sign that my progress is going up, up, up, up. Imagine myself in three weeks. Can I ask you something? Is this the most important match of your life so far?
SPEAKER_02: So far, yes. So far, yes. Because I have the chance to win the East-West Heavyweight title. And also Devon. Devon is now in incredible shape. Yes, he's prime time. And if I beat him, I will be a megastar, you know. People will start liking me very much. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Because I come now like an underdog and people think that he will destroy me. And if I win, it will be very...
SPEAKER_01: It will be a dream for me. I understand. Let's see how it will be. I think it is not going to be as easy as Devon says. I don't even know if he really believes what he says. Because I'm sure that it's not going to be an easy match. If he wins, as comfortable as he claims,
SPEAKER_01: will be interesting your your hand and wrist is compared to your left is much stronger right maybe two times but his right is also stronger compared to his left so we will understand i'm just like thinking like how your endurance will be uh with right arm compared to the match that you guys had with left arm
SPEAKER_02: much much better so no matter how hard the match is you believe that your wrist will not be exhausted no no so every every round you will be able to to talk to him and maybe he will stop you like that or like king's move but i will be the guy attacking and his hand will be doing quite that i just feel that when we wait in manchester
SPEAKER_01: Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh. Yeah, I understand. I understand. Let's see. Let's see. Let's see how it will be. But I kind of believe it is going to be a very, very tough match. Very, very tough match. And Devon will not be as comfortable as he thinks he will be. That is what I believe. But who is going to win, we will see, you know. We will see. The things that you are telling me is just like...
SPEAKER_01: uh very important but i also know that the guy is also very strong and we will see we will see so what what is what is uh like more possible for him to stop you his top role is desperation it's huge
SPEAKER_01: But which move? His move is which move? Like he did something different to Hermes? He doesn't do that lately. He doesn't do that so much lately. Because he doesn't need to do this. Because he was controlling all the wrist and the hand control. But if I top roll him, how can he stop me? Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: this is my opinion that i will take his question one second there is a beach i need to block alexander silva okay this beach is gone anyway so um so you are saying that there is no possibility him to stay at the table like
SPEAKER_01: no he he needs to go i think that he will be like that trying to stop me like that yeah yeah okay that's interesting because because he i don't know but that's interesting so you are saying that he won't be able to
SPEAKER_01: match your orthodox type of arm wrestling ability so he will have to put himself in ugly positions to stop you in position to try to to bleed me to exhaust me and all kind of uh stuff you know
SPEAKER_01: yeah yeah that's interesting that's interesting wow i will be surprised because recently devon is coming to do like more to the table against gennady against dave chaffee against aramis against dennis you know he's like more protecting the center and having the hand wrist control right away so you are saying that he won't be able to dictate this kind of arm muscle to you
SPEAKER_01: So he will have to run away from you. This is what you are saying. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's interesting. That's interesting. Wow. And what is the possibility for you to win if he goes into the type of arm wrestling? I'm not sure how much percent, but maybe 50-50.
SPEAKER_02: 50-50. But do you also work on this? Yes. Side pressure work, hook training too. My biceps is maybe stronger in my career. And my side pressure, I train it a lot. Side, side, side.
SPEAKER_01: This guy, Tyler Engel underestimates Devon. Listen, I'm not underestimating. I'm just saying what he says. He says that I'm asking question if you can stay at the table. And then he says that he won't be able to. I'm not underestimating. These are his opinions. And then...
SPEAKER_02: then I'm just trying to discuss with him with the information he's giving to me. Can you do any shoulder pressure or not possible? Shoulder press, no. I'm not strong there, but my side pressure with the right arm is much better, much better than the summer, than ever. I just feel strong, super strong. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_02: And what's the possibility for him to hook you? I don't think that he can hook me. I think that if he tries to hook me, I will top roll him. And again, it will be like that. Okay. And what's the possibility for him to beat you with that wrist? That wrist, I don't think that he will beat me. Maybe he...
SPEAKER_01: Maybe if he keeps moving for a very, very long time, I'm exhausted. And then after that? And then after that, he can... But not right away? No. If he... No, no, no. I don't think so. Not right away. Okay, I understand. So you are basically saying, according to you, I need to repeat, according to you, because there are some people that probably the IQ level is one-digit number, and they think that it's my opinion. So according to you,
SPEAKER_01: um his only way to stop you is open on top roll which is yeah that's the only way yeah okay I understand yeah I understand okay cyber still how is George's confidence against Devon after seeing Devon did against Hermes and Dennis how many rounds does he think he will win versus Devon
SPEAKER_02: I think that I have better hand control than Hermes. I'm a bigger guy than him. And I also think that I have better hand control than Denis. So you are saying that this is a different story? Yeah, it will be a different story with me. And I think that it will be a totally different match against me. Topie role is for Smart. Georgi, we are watching Bulgaria.
SPEAKER_01: what uh top role is for smart saying that we are watching bulgaria he means the problem from bulgaria like his support message is supporting you yeah yeah thank you um drew navani dennis one month one month before devon match left-handed at 58 centimeter bicep 52 forearms he lost muscle and
SPEAKER_01: had super endurance back then, what would be outcome? One month before Devon match, left hand had 58 centimeters. I don't think so. I measured it was 50 centimeters. I don't think he lost 80. I mean, he had 50 centimeters bicep. I don't think he lost 88 centimeters. I don't know who measured that, but... Then he was bigger than the last time. What's that? According to...
SPEAKER_01: I say that Denis was bigger than the last time I saw him. Yeah, yeah. You saw him last time was July. Yeah. When you saw him. Yeah, yeah. He was bigger. Yeah, for sure. He was bigger. Yeah. But he was very ripped. You know, he was just like arm. Everything was just like very high level definition of the arm, you know? Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: yeah i don't know are you any heavier than uh already since this is our match i'm 165 just one kilograms more one kilogram more okay okay yeah but i try to eat clean good quality food i don't eat trash or you know uh-huh you eat cleaner yeah it's eggs this is my diet
SPEAKER_01: yeah you you you look i mean you look right now a little bit heavy as devon thought that you know you could be like this but this is because of probably i don't know why i don't know why i don't know yeah but you were in great shape like not only at the table but generally yeah more more athletic compared to before yeah um
SPEAKER_01: Thank you for your super chat. What is the length of Georgi's arm? How does it compare to Devin? That will be key in this match. David I measure this? Your length? His hand is one and a half centimeters longer than mine. Oh, one and a half centimeters taller. You measured it. Mine was 52 and a half. His was 54. Oh, okay.
SPEAKER_01: Okay. I remember the numbers. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't remember all of them. Yeah, but he's also taller than me and that's normal. Yeah, yeah. How tall are you? 190. He's maybe 195, 196. I'm not sure. Oh, okay. Okay. Yeah. And Drew Navani. No, Igor measured his right arm in 2019 video.
SPEAKER_01: My friend, you said one month before. I don't understand what you mean. I didn't measure the heights of the athletes. Maybe next time I should do the same. I did the bicep forearm as much as I can. Okay, so...
SPEAKER_01: neil pick up two of the best and most entertaining armors in the game today getting ready to throw down let's go neil pick up says we will see we will see how it will be it will be incredible and i i don't think that it will be an easy match i you know devon's uh
SPEAKER_01: riser you know i call that front wrist is the the point that makes his wrist so strong because without controlling the here it is very very hard to topple someone like this just the wrist usually goes like this so because of his riser um his wrist is well protected so that is why it is more important to control his riser you know
SPEAKER_01: Because if you remember, whenever Hermes was coming, telling him to come to hook, you know, and then whenever he came in, so he didn't use his riser and Hermes took his wrist and then he had to pronate out. So the problem is to control here and he's pronated, you know. So that is why you need to isolate here. Otherwise, you know, the guy is just very, very strong, you know.
SPEAKER_01: only only taking eating outside sometimes you are actually getting melted in his sense you know if you don't control here and then do this so but to control you need to control his pronator as well and his pronator is very strong you know just like very strong yeah very strong so i don't know whenever i tried to ref you guys he was going like even i tried so much he was still doing like one centimeter i was bringing him he was going so
SPEAKER_01: More equal the weapon is, your chance is higher. More equal higher, it is getting harder to control his front wrist. That's why I want to be a very good referee, to make us very fair grip. This is very important for my match.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I think that's why he says that you will be crying a lot, because that's how I feel that, you know, that will be the key. Yeah. People think that your hand is small, but your palm actually is very long, right? Yeah. That part, yeah, yeah. It's long, 22 centimeters, exactly as Devon's hand.
SPEAKER_01: So your hand from here to there is the same, but most likely his fingers are longer and your palm is probably longer, right? Yeah, but my palm is bigger here. Oh, your palm is bigger, yeah. And his fingers are longer, but this part is... Can you show your hand like this? Just go back a little bit, go back a little bit, and then raise your hand a little bit like this so that we can... Yeah, yeah, that part is here. Yeah, actually, yeah, it's not small. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it's just kind of fetters. The right one is fetters. Yeah, I know. I take it five times more than my left. I want everything to go in the right arm. It will be great. Yeah. I mean, people like people, people, you know, there are some people, they don't look so aggressive. They look like very friendly, very, I don't know,
SPEAKER_01: i'm i'm like this i can be aggressive yeah pauline is the same pauline is just very friendly very positive like it is very very hard to imagine them so dangerous at the table but what these guys when they go table
SPEAKER_01: understand they are very dangerous pauline is also very dangerous like pauline always smiling friendly respectful this like you wouldn't think that he's just like you know but at the table when the girl comes he's like lightning you know and also you are the same
SPEAKER_01: People tell me, be aggressive, talk to him more aggressive, make trash talk. Engin, I can't. It's not me, you know. No, no, no. You don't have to. You don't have to. No, it doesn't have to. But some people are more serious, more intimidating. You are not really intimidating. Whenever we see you, you see like a very friendly guy. You understand? Smiling, joking, laughing. But in fact, you know, you save everything to do table. This is how I see it. You know, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, some people don't say that they will do this, they will do that, you understand? The most important thing is what is your performance on the table. It's my opinion. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's for sure. But just remember, I mean, I and Devin, we don't, I tell him this directly, we don't like agree about the borders of the threshold, but we also realize that he makes, somehow he makes the matches
SPEAKER_01: getting the the most um attention also you need to you need to make him pay the price of not taking you seriously right now he's just you don't know how to arm wrestle you will be crying you will be like this you will be like that you understand and then you need to go to the table win or lose make sure that yeah you give him very hard time nightmares you know yeah are you gonna do enough
SPEAKER_01: you will yeah you will i go there and i will be ready to die on this table i i promise you to offer all our blessing community okay yeah yeah um drew navani okay 2018 yeah i understand yeah yeah but my friends i we need to say something uh
SPEAKER_01: Like a lot of comments, I see that like Denis is not the same Denis, so Devon can. Engin, do you hear me? Engin?
SPEAKER_03: Engine. Engine.
SPEAKER_01: i'm sorry did you see me something happened with the connection i don't know what i i think with my connection they said it was my connection yeah i think i think we thought we talked too much behind devon and he his courage came and sabotaged the podcast this is maybe yeah yeah anyway so anyway so
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I'm talking without opening my mouth. So you're going to train after this podcast again? No, today no. I had two trainings today. I'm going to rest. Tomorrow I will have training in the morning. Yeah, but you will not be over-training, right? You will be also resting. Good.
SPEAKER_01: yes i will try to be good rested not over trained to be uh in in good condition in very good condition yeah i believe so i believe so yeah anyway so i will be i will be i will be in dubai i will not be at georgie's corner um i don't want any i'm just joking i'm just trying to steer the pot but um all i want is just
SPEAKER_01: Let the better one win. Better of two. And so is my video now okay? Yes, yes. Yeah, okay, okay. That's good. I see you very good. Yeah, okay. That's good. Anyway, so and then I think everything will be great. What do you think about the card? I think that is one of the best cards that I have ever seen. Your match against Devon is the main event.
SPEAKER_01: events so we have two main events in one event you know it is amazing card amazing yeah and also now we have lady wheels and leonidas and they pull right on this this time and then we know that the
SPEAKER_01: he was getting for bodybuilding you know Larry was getting ready and he was dieting now his right arm match they said they will be much tougher and closer and we have Vala Dennis's training partner against Lars from Norway yeah another great match and then we have Arif versus
SPEAKER_01: Kalnyshenko yeah great great matches and then I also have my student Nisa will be pulling Sarah Raya so what is your opinion about these matches like for example Hermes versus Laletin just tell us honestly don't be nice whatever you think just tell us interesting match but I think it will be very long and difficult match but I think that
SPEAKER_02: maybe in my opinion or waiting we win because hermes uh has problems with guys with bigger hands with him well then then his hand and but just think about it just say just say that they both went outside and hermes lost but he still has the pronators yeah and then switched here
SPEAKER_01: How much Laletin's arm will handle that pressure? Because we know that Laletin is also sometimes having problems for that kind of pressure. His arm strength, like biceps strength, I don't know how he's formed right now. Maybe the first round or the second round, Hermes may win. But in the end, I think that the size of the hand will be more dominant and he will take the win.
SPEAKER_01: But you are expecting a war? Yes, very big war. They are almost the same kilograms but it will be very difficult match for both of them. And then your match against Devon, like you are of course going there to win. Do you expect to like really dominate Devon or do you think there will be some war? No, it will be war again.
SPEAKER_01: It will be war? So we will be just sitting and watching two main event wars. Yes. Wow. I have never said that I will beat Easy Devon. It will be very difficult match also. Long match, difficult, brutal match. You will see. And did you make this a little bit personal?
SPEAKER_01: After he acts like he is not taking you seriously? Yeah, of course, because he doesn't respect enough, right? He doesn't respect enough as an athlete. He thinks that I'm weaker than the other guys, but genetically I'm stronger than all of them. So you can see, right? Yeah. Yeah. Whenever I say like he doesn't respect you, I'm just trying to steal the pot, you know. But this is really like that. If he says that he's going to just...
SPEAKER_01: and lay down and no training and come for vacation and be with you. You don't see much respect there. We need to be honest. Engin, I don't believe in these things. I think that he's lying. I think he's training. Of course he's training. Of course he's training. I will be surprised if he's not trained at all. But maybe not so much because he usually rests a few weeks before
SPEAKER_01: Now we just get out of the Dennis match and Dennis match wasn't as easy as some people are thinking. Where do you see Dennis? Where do you see?
SPEAKER_02: Do you think that everyone in top 10 can beat Denis? No. No, right? I think that he can beat most of the people there. So if I rank him like 6 or something, do you think he was okay? Yes, I think that he can beat Revas. He will beat also Zeranov. I think that he will beat all of these guys. He will stop him with the biceps and after that he will finish them. You think he can also beat Morozov?
SPEAKER_02: what i saw from there was sparring i think that he will beat him now how about he versus jerry he versus gennady he he will beat very jerry i think because he jerry will go inside and dennis has very strong biceps and he will finish you how about this jay he's on the no i think that dennis will destroy jerry you think yes yes and how about gennady versus dennis
SPEAKER_02: this will be war very interesting match this will be very difficult match for both of them
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's what I was thinking. Yeah, yeah. Look, the thing that Denis lost to Devon doesn't have to be a reason people to think that Denis is not so strong. He's strong, but... No, he was very strong. Devon is on another level right now. Not only another level here, but another level here too. Because the guy came forward secure.
SPEAKER_01: Dennis's pronator and then you know he did this so he blocked Dennis's pronator and then hit out hit out he still couldn't finish him and then he did the press press press press and then went outside to finish him it wasn't easy I think Devon pulled him
SPEAKER_01: as smart as possible and i don't i know that many many things during that match that not everyone is capable of doing this and his full forearms help him to reach far to denis's grenade like not not everyone can do those things to dennis yeah yeah but you and me understand that but but the fans think that it was another thing you know because we know we understand the game
