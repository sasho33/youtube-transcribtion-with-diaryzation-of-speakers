SPEAKER_02: Hello, Ivan. Hello, Vladimir. Hi. Hello.
SPEAKER_04: waiting for david and roman i think they still have five minutes to be here so how can you ask uh vladimir how is he doing only like three weeks left how is his shape uh
SPEAKER_02: Well, I'm still preparing. I left 10 days to rest. The form is not the most peak form, but I'll do what I can. He's still training. He left 10 days for rest. His form is not maybe peak form, but still good.
SPEAKER_04: very good huh okay that's good and he hopes it becomes better yeah yeah yeah um i heard that he he pulled uh swiss open in the beginning of the november and around two months ago um how did he perform there uh people are a little bit like they are saying something but nobody really understand did he meet sundry status there
SPEAKER_02: in the Open class or not? Engin asks about Swiss Open. Two months ago you fought. How did you fight there? And everyone is wondering if you fought with Andris Sedis. Or maybe behind the scenes, behind the dressing table. At these competitions. I was at Swiss Open.
SPEAKER_03: I don't know if it's worth saying that I didn't prepare for it. Why not? I learned about this tournament two or three weeks before it. I didn't know that it was a qualifier tournament. I just went home, checked if there was anything else, and I went. It used to be another tournament, and there were no qualifiers.
SPEAKER_03: He participated without preparation.
SPEAKER_02: maybe a couple of um easy workouts um like pulling ups uh no specific preparation yes for swiss open uh and uh about uh sundries uh he says that um it was not serious they pulled it was after pulling or after it was after pulling and the only thing um
SPEAKER_04: that said it said that he is very good for his weight for it i understand i understand yeah okay okay um but i heard that he and uh he and kalnishenko also had a slow start and kalnishenko kind of a little bit struggled to pin him
SPEAKER_03: David you hear that you were standing with Kalinichenko and that you were holding him back a little bit? I mean, you couldn't win him quickly. Was it like that? Well, from the video, it seems as if I was holding him back, but I couldn't, for example... Well, as I see it now, those feelings back then... No.
SPEAKER_02: He says that it seemed that he could hold him for a little, but he thinks that he had no chance. Yeah, yeah, yeah. For winning, yes, it's normal, you know, but... Not even for winning, not even for holding. So he thinks it's just...
SPEAKER_04: just it seemed uh like that that he could watch him it was not and and can uh those three of the i think latvian guys also pulled in against him and they also said that he was very strong and they are like world level pullers you know what does he think about his own category and can you ask him which place he took in the overalls
SPEAKER_03: David you fight in Absolutka? And there were three more athletes from Latvia? Yes, there were. But it was... I don't remember the names now. But yes, there were three athletes. They are quite titled, I would say.
SPEAKER_03: I didn't perform for 5 years, but then I decided to watch a video of them performing in Europe and the world. One of them is younger, he's a junior. I stood behind the scenes with them, and I realized that if I played with them, it would be much harder for me. But because I knew they were serious guys, I didn't let them fight with anyone.
SPEAKER_03: That is, I won in the absolute. I won only in the absolute. Well, who were the big ones there? This is from Latvia or Belarus. He was so healthy, a kilogram, I don't know, maybe 150 or something. Well, very healthy. The Ukrainian himself was healthy. And so.
SPEAKER_03: To be honest, there were very few people in Absolutka, because it was 3 a.m. and a lot of people had already left. The hall was empty. Do you remember who became the first in Absolutka? The first, the second and the third. Well, as I said, the first one was Kalinichenko, then me, then this one from Belarus, or not from Belarus, I don't know where he came from, he was very healthy. So... So you became the first one, you became confident, right?
SPEAKER_03: Well, Ivan, to be honest, I didn't expect it to be so easy. I mean, I know who these guys are, and I didn't understand why they... Ivan, can you translate time to time? Yes.
SPEAKER_02: well he just said that uh yes there were three good uh latin guys uh so maybe one of them from junior championships some of them participated in europeans and worlds and he won them he won them um but when after pulling uh he understood that they were uh better than his
SPEAKER_02: uh they were quite good but he won them uh and in the overalls uh there were not many people first was kalinchenko and uh he became second and third guy was from um belarus from um how is it called uh belarusia
SPEAKER_04: Oh, a big guy. There was one. Yeah. Roman, can you reach to David? I can call him. I will move to my I mean, he should be here already was I sent him the link. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: And what does he think that his form was like by percentage during the Swiss Open? And what do you think, what was your form during the Swiss Open relative to your best? What did you understand about the fight? How confident did you feel? Well, before I went there, I did the measurements, honestly. And I was on the block.
SPEAKER_03: which, well, the direct weight, yes, on such a handle, on such a handle, yes, which is here, the bearing, here, here I am on it, 7.75, so I twisted it with a margin, well, how I twisted it, I turned it over, tightened it, pulled it, so I remember that at the best time I did it like this, 95, so under 100 kilograms, and I realized that somewhere it was 7.70, well, maybe 75 percent of the best shape,
SPEAKER_02: it was about 70 75 of his best form and he before pulling at swiss open he tried himself at his imitation exercise from upper pulling with this handle uh in his best form he did 90 95 kilograms uh for one rep real weight and now he did uh 75.
SPEAKER_03: So it was 35 out of 95. And now, after two months, where is his form in the same things? And now, after two months, where is his form in the same things? And now, after two months, where is his form in the same things? And now, after two months, where is his form in the same things? And now, after two months, where is his form in the same things? And now, after two months, where is his form in the same things? And now, after two months, where is his form in the same things? And now, after two months, where is his form in the same things? And now, after two months, where is his form in the same things? And now, after two months, where is his form in the same things? And now, after two months, where is his form in the same things? And now, after two months, where is his form in the same things? And now, after two months, where is his form in the same things? And now, after two months, where
SPEAKER_03: on the finger load, not like lorat, but more on the finger. I work 35 kg so far. I do pull-ups, and this handle, and plus pronator. I got better than I was when I started. I look at my pull-ups, that is, if at the beginning I did somewhere under 40, pull-ups like David does,
SPEAKER_03: in a short amplitude, clean, then now I'm doing a little more than 60, well, 60-65, and I'm planning to do it somewhere up to... If I can do it up to 80 in one go, then... I don't know, I won't translate it. Up to 80 in this exercise, in which exercise? Once again. Here I take pull-ups, which are in such a short angle, like David Zekian, yes. In my best time, I did it 80 times in one set, and...
SPEAKER_02: Without weight, yes. And after, for example, training, if I do it 50 times, it means I'm in good shape. There's too much information, let me say something else. His form became obviously better, but he doesn't do exactly that exercises to keep his elbows safe.
SPEAKER_02: uh he now concentrates on other exercises uh and he demonstrated that he uh uh he trained fingers on that handle like uh larat handle something like that uh and also he focuses on his uh another
SPEAKER_02: um key exercise it is uh they are pull-ups uh short short range for biceps and in his best form he did um 80 reps right now right now is he heavier than past his body weight is
SPEAKER_02: Your weight now is more than compared with Swiss or compared with his national championships? No, no, like 4-5 years ago when he was competing he was 75-80 kg or 78 at Zloty. Is he now heavier? Like is he also pulling more weight up? Yes, you used to weigh 75-78 kg.
SPEAKER_03: What? He was about 80 then, 80 kilograms. And now around 85?
SPEAKER_04: Yes, you're right. 85, 86. So he had five kilos. Oh, he's pulling actually 65 kilos now. Five kilos extra weight, yeah. Anyway, so, hello, hello, David, you hear us? Oh, David is just coming back again. Anyway, so...
SPEAKER_00: Hello, David. I think he's back. I think he's back. David and Vladimir, can you turn your phone? You know. We cannot hear David, so I told him that he needs to. But does he hear you? I'm not sure because. Probably he doesn't hear you either. Maybe you call him.
SPEAKER_00: okay i will call him again yeah what to do you know because yeah he needs to you know touch the screen and probably forget how to do he his microphone is not mute his microphone we can see but i guess he has other problems i will tell him yeah okay yeah have you pulled have you pulled body mirror me no no no no
SPEAKER_04: Um, so what I understand you want is basically, uh, not in his top form, but he still has more than three weeks and he is coming up to bear, you know, really close. Yeah. So what, what he means that like he was putting, he was doing 80 reps. Now he's doing 65 reps. We can say with the five kilo more weight, you know, whatever, you know, maybe it doesn't count that way, but, um,
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, so this guy, he's just laughing and he's saying he's trying to make podcast interesting, let me kick him out, you know, he can look at his own ass and maybe left there. Anyways, people still didn't learn how to not to fuck with me, but just what to do. So, David, you hear us? David, can you hear me?
SPEAKER_04: he he hears us but i mean he cannot fix his audio i will tell him to just use different uh devices can you talk privately or so yeah i think i can um we can continue chatting and so let's let's talk about uh
SPEAKER_04: At the beginning, he didn't want to directly pull, but he wanted to pull someone else. And later he wanted to pull David. And later he changed his mind. Can you ask him, you know, like, what was the reason he didn't want to pull? He just probably wanted to have longer time to be ready for this match. But you can also tell him that regardless of the result, sooner or later, I will invite him again, you know.
SPEAKER_02: So what do you have to ask? Why did he first refuse and then agree, right? Yeah, yeah. First he thought he wanted to pull someone else because I offered him the match. And then later he said that, like, you know, okay, let me pull him, you know. Volodya, Engin says that at first you didn't immediately agree to fight.
SPEAKER_02: But then he agreed to fight David right away. Yes. Well, Engelin says that if you talk from the perspective of perspective, it doesn't matter whether you win or lose, he will still invite you. That is, there is no such problem here. And you probably wanted more time to prepare, right? Yes. But then he believed in himself a little. Yes, yes.
SPEAKER_02: No, it's not that I believed him. My brother convinced me and said, you've got four weeks to prepare. Can I say something? Engin, you're right. Vladimir first, he wanted to prepare more. But his brother told him that he needed, that four weeks would be enough. So he agreed. Four weeks would be enough. When I offered him the match, he had like, almost like,
SPEAKER_04: seven eight weeks or something or seven weeks easily yeah so okay yeah so and how does he see his chances against uh david is he like is he confident and what does he expect and he needs to win four rounds
SPEAKER_04: because the world title matches now best of seven is it gonna help him or help david in his opinion people says that his endurance is also great what does he think about this uh
SPEAKER_02: And secondly, people think that you have very good endurance and that you will have to fight up to 4 wins. That is, potentially, maybe 7 rounds. And the usual fights were up to 3 wins. Is this an advantage for you or not? How do you think? Well, in general, how do you feel about endurance? Will there be endurance with an advantage in your case? I think that...
SPEAKER_03: Specifically, at the moment, today, I do not have the endurance that I once had. Yes, I am resilient, I can still fight for a long time, really. But there is also the fact that I am also resilient. And at the moment he is stronger than me in the hook.
SPEAKER_02: At the moment I don't count on my strength and endurance. I count on technique and speed. Vladimir thinks that his endurance is not that good as it was. He has still good endurance, but not like he had before. And also he thinks that David has also very good endurance.
SPEAKER_02: even better than him now and also he thinks same about the strength uh in hook he thinks that david perhaps is stronger than him in hook uh so he relies on speed and on technique so here not not strength and endurance so his plan is just to make a quick win
SPEAKER_02: He thinks it's the only possible way to win. Does it mean that if he gets stuck, he can now win? He thinks that he will have low chances to win in that case.
SPEAKER_04: So, can you ask him... Hello. Hello, David. Good to hear you. Can you ask Vladimir, does he regret that he accepted the match? Do you regret that you accepted the match? Emil. Volodya. I... Do you regret it? I understand, yes. Probably...
SPEAKER_02: Not really. Not really regrets. So he doesn't regret more than regrets, he says. But he's not sure, yes, in his...
SPEAKER_04: in his uh chances but he does not he does not regret whatever the outcome is he wants to come and fight okay okay so hello david david yes david doesn't hear us
SPEAKER_01: He's saying that prior to this time, he could not hear us. But now it's all good. Oh, OK. Because he's not talking. Looks like he's freezing. But yeah, OK. Yeah. So how are you, David? .
SPEAKER_00: I think there's a slight delay for David, but he said that, yeah, thanks. I'm good. I'm doing fine. No, no bad feelings, no injuries, nothing. I'm being preparing and, uh, looking forward to the match. And what's it, what's his weight? 39.
SPEAKER_00: He said 89 kg, almost 89. 89. And how is his shape? Like, better than before, the same? How is it now? Well, in general, I would say that in general, he is very strong.
SPEAKER_00: so he he could not say specifically relatively to other his prior shapes uh or which one he is right now he said that i'm not definitely not complaining i'm really feeling good and i also changed the gym that's what he said and
SPEAKER_00: uh he feels like weights that he's doing like uh heavy weights he's really really um uh satisfied of his working and his strength level so he's not complaining and he said that my actual form i will try to prove myself at the table and it will show yeah even you want to quickly translate what he says to vladimir would understand uh no
SPEAKER_02: David's form is good, he doesn't complain about anything, his weight is great, he's looking forward to the fight. Almost 90 kilos. And he's almost 90 kilos, right, Engin? 89 kilos, and he's still losing weight. Yeah, almost 90. I see. It'll be good for everyone. No excuses. It was a bad form.
SPEAKER_00: What's that? I will let first Ivan to translate if he wants, and then David also asked me what did he say. Vladimir Laksic. Laksic?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah, basically he said that it's good that Davit is dead, when he loses he will not have any, he wouldn't say that I was in a bad shape. Right? That's what he said. We can't even act like he's underdog all that time and look what he says now. Yeah, I will translate to Davit as well. Okay, that's interesting.
SPEAKER_00: It is possible to say that he was born in 1916, but when he was born, he was not born in the same form as I am. I think he was born in the same form as I am. Yes, it is possible that he was born in the same form as I am, but he was not born in the same form as I am.
SPEAKER_02: He said the challenge is accepted. He made sure that this is what Maiorov said, and he said the challenge is accepted. The challenge is accepted, Volodya. I understand. You said it's good that he weighs more, that he's in good shape. There won't be an excuse that he lost. He will lose, yes.
SPEAKER_02: Ivan, David is asking how much is Vladimir's weight right now? 86 kg.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah. So, Ivan, I don't understand Vladimir. Vladimir, from the beginning of the podcast till like one minute ago, he sounded like, you know, I don't have much chance, like he sounded that way. And then
SPEAKER_04: When David said that he's in very good shape, and now Vladimir said that, okay, that's good, that he's in very good shape, so when he loses, he will not have any excuse, and now it sounds like, you know, opposite way, exactly opposite way. Which one we should believe? Mask him. First of all, you behaved quite modestly, Volodya, because you're not very ready now, in general, for the future.
SPEAKER_02: Well, maybe not the best, but now there is already some kind of confidence, even a challenge in your words. Why, asks Engin, do you believe more in what was at the beginning or now? How is it really? I understand the question. But I personally, I will say so, Ivan, if I succeed in doing what I think,
SPEAKER_03: What I'm training for now, I think I'll be able to win. And if, for example, something happens, let's say, anything unexpected can happen to me or something else, then it won't be quite like that. No, I'm not saying that I will definitely come and win now. I'm doing everything, I even made a video for him, for David,
SPEAKER_02: I will do everything possible to win. Vladimir will do everything he can to win. He has a plan and he's going to do everything according to this plan. He's not sure, but he wants to win and he has a plan again. Okay, he's coming to Istanbul to win. Yes, not to lose for sure.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, he doesn't want to come here just to see, you know, how his form is, but he's coming here to win, okay. You can translate it, Roman, if you want. So, you're going to win, not just to check your form, right? Well... At least you're in the mood, you're in the mood. I'm in the mood, yes. I'm in the mood, and then we'll see how it goes. I can say right away that
SPEAKER_02: He has a good mindset. He didn't prepare like this, he said thoughtfully before.
SPEAKER_02: So now he thought a lot how to prepare better for this match.
SPEAKER_00: I will briefly also translate. Yeah, yeah, Roma, translate please, yeah, quickly. Yes, and here's the thing, as I said before, it's very important that you understand what I'm trying to say, and how to deal with it, whether it's psychological or physical, whether it's a mode of communication, and so on, because it's very important. And what I'm trying to say is that it's very important to think about it, to think about it, and to deal with it, because it's very important to think about it.
SPEAKER_00: Everything is clear for that. And he also said that
SPEAKER_00: yeah and he also said that uh i'm also coming there to win not to just uh check myself that's what that no i mean we know that he doesn't need to check himself he wanted to prove himself enough more than enough more than anyone else you know tell him this please yeah for sure uh david uh
SPEAKER_00: I know they have been in the same category, but have they actually armwrestled before? Volodya, have you ever fought David?
SPEAKER_02: But I watched all the videos on YouTube about him and I realized that I will fight against the reflection. And you never fought with him? Never in my life. He never pulled, David. But when he watched the videos with David, he started to think that he will have to pull with a kind of his reflection.
SPEAKER_04: with someone like him. I think it's going to be a tough match. David, what are your advantages and disadvantages against Vladimir? Do you feel yourself stronger? Do you feel yourself having better endurance?
SPEAKER_04: What is your game plan? You plan to stop him and outlast him and beat him as you usually do?
SPEAKER_00: David, I would like to ask you if you are interested in what you would like to do in the future, if you think that your job is very good, if your job is very good, for example, if you think that you will be very successful in the future, and maybe you will be able to achieve your goals, what do you think?
SPEAKER_01: I don't think my style of painting is the standard. I don't think my style of painting is the standard. I don't think my style of painting is the standard. I don't think my style of painting is the standard. I don't think my style of painting is the standard. I don't think my style of painting is the standard.
SPEAKER_01: I would like to add a few things to the discussion. We have two teams in the same category. The second team is going to be the champion of the season.
SPEAKER_01: He was in the European Championship in 1935, and in 1934 he was a major in Besameze in Zlotitur. He was a very good sportsman, a very talented sportsman. He was a great hockey player, and I think he is one of the greatest competitors in the world. He is one of the greatest.
SPEAKER_00: So he correlated to many different things. First of all, he said that considering my all eight matches that I have done at East versus West, primarily I do the same style. Like my style will not be changed just because I'm pulling my Orov.
SPEAKER_00: He thinks that endurance-wise, whether he is more endurable or stronger, he cannot say that in advance. Table will show and our match, how it goes, will show who is more endurable athlete and stronger. He also said that because of that, he is not going to come here in a different mindset. He will do what he is doing the best. And then also he wanted to say specifically for Vladimir,
SPEAKER_00: uh he remembered their prior matches not their matches but uh uh he said that uh we both participated two times in the same tournament it was once in europe uh in 75 kg category where i won and uh second time it was 78 category at slot
SPEAKER_00: yes yes engine and there my row end up on third place and I'm me first but they never happened to pull obviously uh even also translated as Vladimir also approved so they have never met but he said that myro is really really tough opponent for him yeah okay yeah uh but
SPEAKER_04: I think in the Zloty one, I remember, yeah, that, that, that was like the, the one that he and Maiorov and Alizhan Muratov were like a very, very long match, like maybe two minutes. I remember 2018 Zloty. Yeah. I think the, the Polish guy was second place. Yeah. Anyway, so let's, let's talk about some other matches quickly and
SPEAKER_04: These are incredible matches. I really hope that the community, majority of the community, Ivan,
SPEAKER_04: They understand the level of these matches because they are mostly focused on a few guys in the world. And then they kind of like ignore, you know, not everyone, of course, but some of the fans they ignore. But like, for example, level of this match is very, very high. And you, Ivan, you have been in the same national team with Maiorov, right? Yes. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: How do you see him? How would you describe, you know, how would you explain us, you know, the way you see him? Extremely strong side pressure, short rotators, and also extremely very, very good endurance. Maybe not that good a strong wrist, obviously strong, but maybe not the top level.
SPEAKER_02: wrist but his shoulder pronation pronators side pressure incredible i would say and uh perhaps i have i can compare him maybe with zaloif hadji maybe uh zaloif was more effective uh maybe but
SPEAKER_02: Zaloyev, Khadzhi. I would say that in this particular movement they were perhaps close, but Zaloyev had maybe more fast, he was maybe a little better wrist, he was more effective. But when you hold him, Vladimir is close, I think, to Zaloyev's level.
SPEAKER_02: I understand. Very strong hook. Actually, Vladimir, he came to my gym maybe three years ago or four years ago. And I tested him. Side pressure, wrist, fingers, all those tests. And we pulled him a little. And it was really difficult to get him from his angles. And the results were really good. Yeah, those numbers that he did?
SPEAKER_04: And numbers were really good, yes. And at the table. On the table, when you test him, he was very strong. Whenever he has his angle. Yeah, okay, I understand. So I was very impressed. Yeah, let us quickly ask them, you know, their predictions. David, Vala versus Aydar Khan.
SPEAKER_02: Do you know these athletes? Valiko and Aydar Khan.
SPEAKER_03: Only in the video, I know. I didn't fight with them like that. He didn't pull them. What do you think, who will win? Pichkidze, Aydarhanov? So there will be fighting, like, the Kazakh and the other one, the Georgian, right? Yes, I know. I don't know. He doesn't know. He doesn't know, OK. David, Marcio Barboza versus Oleg Petrenko.
SPEAKER_01: Fifty-fifty. There is no doubt about it. There is no doubt about it. There is no doubt about it. There is no doubt about it. There is no doubt about it. There is no doubt about it. There is no doubt about it. There is no doubt about it.
SPEAKER_00: judging by the you already know he said 50 50 judging by the marcio's um current shape as he's not his uh best that he used to be um hippie he says that it's 50 50 otherwise he would pick marcio a bit more favorite
SPEAKER_00: but on the other hand also oleg is really really strong and he's getting stronger and he's young perspective so he really has a capability to withstand a chance against this level of marcio so or both has like ups and downs so he said 50 50. and can you ask the same to william marcio marcio barbosa oleg petrenko
SPEAKER_03: So he is supporting Petrenko and he gives about 60% to him.
SPEAKER_00: To Petrenko. Yes. Yeah. And Robby Topie versus Aymeric. Unfortunately, he is not familiar with the name, so he cannot give the prediction. And can you ask to Vladimir? Robby Topie, Aymeric Predayens.
SPEAKER_04: Unfortunately, I don't know them. He's not familiar. Okay, let's go to the ones that I'm sure they are familiar. Artem Taynov versus Zaur Tavberidze. Taynov. Leva. Aha. What do you think about Zurab? Well, I don't know who he is, but I think Zurab is a good player. Zurab is a very good player.
SPEAKER_01: We all know that this is a very difficult time. We all know that this is a very difficult time. We all know that this is a very difficult time. We all know that this is a very difficult time. We all know that this is a very difficult time. We all know that this is a very difficult time. We all know that this is a very difficult time.
SPEAKER_01: I would like to say that Dainovi is a very good sportsman and he is very close to Samushia Andriyev. I would like to say that Dainovi is a very good sportsman and I would like to say that Dainovi is a very good sportsman and he is very close to Samushia Andriyev.
SPEAKER_00: So he picks Surabh, but not just because they are good friends and they are both Georgians. No, he says that all this time since Surabh's injury, he has been extremely focused on his left arm to make it as powerful as possible, as strong as possible. And he's in his best shape on the left arm, he said. And he's also motivated.
SPEAKER_00: Ivan, Zuhal is a very good player in the national team.
SPEAKER_00: And also, sorry, Vladimir, Zurab also, he said that Zurab will also come back even stronger on right arm. It's not about the years, it's about months. Yeah, matter of months. Artem Taynov against Zurab Tavberidze. I understand, yes.
SPEAKER_03: I see that Taynov is more universal, and Tavberidze has a good hook and good movement towards himself. And as I see it in the fight, if it was in one round, I would bet on Tavberidze. But because it's six or seven rounds, I still see that Taynov will be the favorite in this pair because of the universality. Because he can, for example,
SPEAKER_03: Vladimir says that if it was one round, he would think that Zurab would win, that he has more chances.
SPEAKER_02: uh seven matches in uh in many matches uh because tainov is more versatile um he he will most of perhaps he will win he has more chance he will have more chances okay and iraq is rakashvili pauline david oh
SPEAKER_01: Yes, I think that the society should be aware of the importance of education. Education is a form of education, a form of education. I think the education system should be aware of the importance of education. It is very important that education is a form of education.
SPEAKER_00: He picks Irakli as a favorite because he seems to be in his best shape right now. David could not remember if Irakli has ever been better than right now he is. He knows how good shape Irakli is. And he said that, what can I say? I would say Paul, like 60 to 40 Irakli versus Paul, the favorite.
SPEAKER_01: Paul is a great man. He is a legend from the beginning. He is a great person. He is a great person. He is a great person. He is a great person. He is a great person. He is a great person. He is a great person.
SPEAKER_00: obviously regardless uh he said like uh no no credits taken from paul he is the beast he said that uh paul is very very tough and uh challenging opponent but
SPEAKER_00: However, he said, considering their both matches against Babaev, he said that Babaev, we know he's legendary. Maybe he was not in his best shape, but he still, Davit still said that Irakli pulled, pulled like kind of convincingly beat him. He was like three-two, one round, he won, one round, another win.
SPEAKER_00: but this is what now it said right okay so and he said like uh considering to both uh matches he said that you're actually beat uh easier than paul did that's what he meant so okay you want uh
SPEAKER_03: And Irakli, who fought with Babaev. I don't know Irakli, because he was in the same category with me. Well, to be honest, I look at it the same way, like this, yes, in terms of endurance. Because the grid, it's like, well, when it's a one-on-one fight, it's one thing, and when it's a marmfight, it's another. In the sense that you can still adjust. And Irakli, well,
SPEAKER_03: As far as I know, this line is not very strong. I don't know. I would say that Zirakashvili has more chances to win. He thinks that Irakli has more chances. And perhaps it will be also the matter of endurance. Okay. And with Prava, right arm. Matt Mask, Wagner, Bortolato, Davidsson.
SPEAKER_01: Thank you very much. Thank you very much. In the year 2000, we had this meeting. After that, there was no information about how it was going to be. We had a very good dialogue, but...
SPEAKER_01: I think it was in the mid-1950s.
SPEAKER_00: He said that most, in his opinion, most objective judging of this, predicting this match is 50-50 for him. Matt Mask is not in the shape that he used to be, judging by his performance, late performances. However, he's also not sure how good Bortolato is on the right arm. So he said that it's 50-50. Bortolato with Matt Mask.
SPEAKER_02: So he knows Matt Mask well, but he is only one pulling with Bortolato on left hand with Larratt.
SPEAKER_04: He also thinks 50-50. 50-50, okay. Okay, this one I only ask the prediction of the winner. Only I'm asking, nothing more than the name of the winner. David Samushia or Vladimir Maiorov? David.
SPEAKER_01: Volodya, who will win? Where does this belt go? David or Vladimir Mayurov? Only one word. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know what will happen in the future, but the Moldovan championship will be held in Moldova in 2013. I think it will be interesting to see what happens in the future. I think it will be interesting to see what happens in the future.
SPEAKER_01: I don't want to talk about that. From that point on, in the 50s and 50s, there was a lot of discussion about whether or not it would be possible to do this, but in the end, it was very clear that it would be possible to do it. I was in the same category. I was in the same category. Of course, there was a certain theme that it was very difficult, it was very difficult, but it was not easy.
SPEAKER_01: He won the Boldovian championship because he is a very good sportsman. And this year, in reality, he is in his fifties or thirties. Two and a half or three?
SPEAKER_01: In Moldova, Marjana Khaylimo was in the 4th and 5th place, and in March, Shokhtan Gageta was in the final. It was a very good match. In the third place, Bogdan Simenovi was in the 2nd place, Demetrov was in the 3rd place, Zirakashvili was in the 4th place, and it was a very good match.
SPEAKER_00: So he said that he cannot claim that he is a very favorite or a favorite in this match against Maiorov because he remembered reminisce about Maiorov's... Moldovan performance? Exactly, Engin. Yeah. He said he, then he named those names. I'm sure you heard. He said Dimitrov, he said Bojidar, he said... Bojidar, Plemen, Dimitrov, Krasovski, Irakli, Zirakashvili,
SPEAKER_00: those guys were end up at the below uh in the rate rating and of the tournament below him so he gave huge credit and he said that i know how much from that point uh vladimir could have gone even higher levels so considering that uh even though david knows what he has accomplished he cannot say his favorite so he really he really estimates this match and estimates vladimir
SPEAKER_02: And what does Vladimir think? Who is winning this match? What do you think?
SPEAKER_03: He has his strengths. I know them. I will try to find his strengths. I will try to find his weaknesses and try to fight. If I manage to win through his weaknesses, that's the only way. I understand that I don't have a chance against his strengths. I understand that it's not my option to beat him.
SPEAKER_02: It is not one word. Once again, he says that David has his strong and perhaps weak points. And he doesn't think that he is able to win him in his strong points in hook. So that's it.
SPEAKER_04: And he would try to use his work points, but he's not sure about that. Again, we came back to that not sure point after saying that, you know, he will not have any excuse when he lost. Yep. Either he is himself confused or he's trying to confuse us, Ivan. Anyway, so let's go to the next one.
SPEAKER_00: before you continue i have a surprise for you like it's uh hold up i will do it like this yeah i hope you see it do you see this yeah you want to show the you want to show what you see the check mark here
SPEAKER_04: verification oh okay that's good that's good i got the channel verified so yeah it's good news for fans yeah i i i shouldn't be lazy and do for my channel as well yeah east versus west is my channel as well but still you know you guys are running or exotic versus two berries there samusha do you know that is there well enough what do you think about this young young guy
SPEAKER_01: From my point of view, there is no doubt that he is very competitive and has a weight category of 45 kg.
SPEAKER_01: There is no doubt about it. There is a lot of damage done to these sports. From this point of view, we know that there is a big chance that Oleg John will win. We know that in Oleg John, in the Maritsa region, there is a certain power that is very strong. From this point of view, we know that
SPEAKER_01: So he said that Avtandil...
SPEAKER_00: Avtandil is a very, very strong and promising young puller. He, David mentioned that Avtandil's last achievements, the big names that he actually made them to fall behind. He said, but still we're talking about Oleg.
SPEAKER_00: And at this weight class, Oleg is Oleg. Oleg is the one guy. So he picks Oleg's favorite. He said 60, 40. But he said that Tutberidze will be a legend soon, like a very promising athlete. And he wishes him to win. And Vladimir? Vladimir, Oleg Zhuk, Avtandil, Tutberidze. Tutberidze, yes.
SPEAKER_03: I think that if... Well, I watched the last tournaments of Zhokh. I think that if this person in Tutberidze, he will fight with him on... I'll say it now. Up to the top. In short, he has a chance to win only with the top. If he wants to twist him into the hook and fight in the hook, then there is no chance. Do you think Oleg will not be able to do it in the hook? And he can just do it up to the top.
SPEAKER_02: Yes, Topheridze has a chance. And if they are in the hooks, Oleg will win. What is the question? Who wins? Yes. Who is your favorite?
SPEAKER_02: I think it's Zhokh. He thinks Zhokh has more chances, but Avtandil also has some chances. Yeah. If he uses Chopra. Yeah. Okay, Daniel versus Mindaugas. David. Daniel. I think Daniel moves. I think Daniel moves.
SPEAKER_01: Daniel is in a very good shape. He was born in 1935. He is very strong and strong. I think he is a very good sportsman. I think Daniel is in a very good shape. He was born in 1935. Daniel is in a very good shape. I think Daniel is in a very good shape.
SPEAKER_00: guys so he said overall he picks daniel as like 70 favorite uh he is in his best shape david assumes and believes daniel is uh very strong at this weight class it this is like his weight category uh 75 he he thinks that at this weight even though um
SPEAKER_00: his opponent is really really uh also winning convincingly his matches 75 he still picks daniel as a favorite um 70 to 30 percent yeah okay you want to give it to kapchuk um
SPEAKER_04: He thinks that Prokopchuk is the favorite, but he has to be serious. I'm sure he will be serious because Mindaugas is not someone that you should take lightly. I have a question here quickly to Samushia before we finish the last five matches.
SPEAKER_00: Samushia, which of the 85 Kilo matches, your title matches, you had six matches in 85 Kilo, which one you think was the hardest? David, think about it. If you had six matches, you would have beaten Itulis, right? You would have beaten Itulis in every match against him. You would have beaten him in every match against him. David you hear that? David you hear that?
SPEAKER_04: Let's go to the last matches. We go to Ivan Ivan Matyushenko vs. Rino Macic. David, remember, Ivan is in the chat. You be careful. Rino Macic is the first one.
SPEAKER_01: It's a great sport, but I don't think there's a chance to compete with Ivan Matyushenko. I don't think he's going to be a great athlete. I don't think he's going to be a great athlete. I think he's going to be a great athlete.
SPEAKER_00: He started saying by, uh, how good Rino is. He said he's young, so young and still so powerful. However, uh, he doesn't, he tried not to be as rude as much possible. He said that we know Ivan and he, he believes it, uh, it will be easy for you. And actually he said that he will, he will beat Rino convincingly. This, uh, this is different, even though Rino is really, really good at his age. And Myro.
SPEAKER_03: And Vladimir, about me, Ivan Matyushenko, Masich, if you know Rima. Yes, yes, I know. I fought with him in the last Swiss Open. He put him at last Swiss Open. Left hand, right hand, to the right, to the left. To the left, to the left. And how? He didn't fight to the right. I want to say that this is probably like your young version. I watched an interview recently that you used to jump like this in the triceps to Zambulato.
SPEAKER_03: He also fights like that. He hits very hard from top to bottom. Half of his triceps. And he finishes with a hook. So I think you will win, of course. But I think you should be careful. Because he is also very fast. He thinks that Rino is my young version.
SPEAKER_02: Because at the very beginning, I used some not triceps move, but something like that, more side move. He thinks that I will win, but he says that I should be careful because Rino is dangerous and he can surprise. Okay. Okay. And let's go to the next one. Krasimir Kostadinov, John Bersink, David.
SPEAKER_01: I would like to thank you very much. I am very happy to be here today. I would like to thank you very much.
SPEAKER_01: It was in the modern form, not in the modern form, but it was in the modern form, but it was in the modern form, but it was in the modern form, but it was in the modern form, but it was in the modern form, but it was in the modern form, but it was in the modern form,
SPEAKER_00: uh now he thinks that uh neither of uh those athletes are unfortunately in their prime shape in their best shape he said that costa dino used to be better as he uh performs lately but so does so did uh john but still they are in the shape that will give tough battle he said this this match will be very insightful it will be very exciting to watch
SPEAKER_02: and he could not pick the winner he said like 50 50. but he thinks that christine will win
SPEAKER_02: He thinks that Krasimir will win, but still he bets on John. I don't know how... No, he bets. Maybe he supports only maybe John. He wants him to win, but he thinks that... Yeah, okay. That makes sense when you're like, I want this guy to win, but I think this guy is going to win. But when you say like,
SPEAKER_04: I think this guy is going to win, but I bet on this one. Like, you wouldn't bet. Yeah, yeah. Yes, that's what he said, but that was not logical. Yes. Okay, yeah. It wasn't, yeah. Yeah. And let's go to the next one. This one, Artem Morozov versus Alex Kurdecha. Morozov. Left arm. World title. Morozov's pick-up...
SPEAKER_01: I think it was in the 90s or the 20s. Of course, there is no doubt about that. I don't mean to say that I don't agree with it, but I think it was in the 90s or the 20s. I think it was the beginning of all the changes, and it was the beginning of all the changes.
SPEAKER_01: I think it's a very good idea. I think it's a very good idea.
SPEAKER_00: He didn't, David did not want to say how good Alex is, that's beyond the words for sure. But in this match, he picks Morozov heavy favorite. He said like 80 to 20% Morozov is a favorite. He said about the Morozov shape that he's active and Kurdecha somewhat inactive. So he thinks Morozov will beat him convincingly, even though obviously Alex is Alex and he's really, really tough.
SPEAKER_03: Artyom Morozov, Alex Kurdecha. I bet on Morozov. If nothing happens to him again, no infection or something else, some kind of trauma, then I think Morozov can win. I bet on him. I bet on Artyom Morozov. If Artyom feels himself well and all is well.
SPEAKER_01: Okay. And this much, my personal favorite one, Alizhan Muratov Evgeny Prudnik, left arm. David. I think it's a good question, and I think it's important to say that. But I think Prudnik is right about that.
SPEAKER_00: This match is going to be historical, Engin. He said it will be really, really good, close, but he picks Prudnik as like 55-45 favorite. But close, really, really close match. But he still picked Prudnik as favorite. Okay.
SPEAKER_03: And Vladimir? Prudnik with Olezhan Muratov. Evgeny Prudnik, Olezhan Muratov. Left. Left hand. Well... Damn, I'm 50-50, really. 50-50, because both are very strong on the hands, on the left. I have more, more preferences for Olezhan Muratov. A little bit more, I'll give. 55, somewhere at 45.
SPEAKER_02: uh a few things they are both extremely strong uh but a little more chances for alijan murad maybe 55 to 45. so he says that alijan has a little bit more chance and david says prudny has a little bit more chance percentage-wise they both said 55 for me to me to me
SPEAKER_04: like this like this 50 50 for me is i think this is like one of the best matches like although east versus west uh history from outside look you know um we will see and david david dadikian versus tatashins
SPEAKER_01: That's the way it is in Khachanskoye. Well, it's not like we're all coming from the same place. It's a bit different. Khachanskoye is very, very prosperous. It's very similar to Mongolia.
SPEAKER_01: I would like to say that he is a very good sportsman. I think he will be able to achieve this in 2022.
SPEAKER_00: He picked Todd Zilla, favorite. He said, I think he's a good opponent, tough opponent, tough challenge for Todd. But like considering Zilla's astonishing and outstanding performance, he said like really, really big words for Todd Zilla's recent match and his performance. It's hard to bet against him in this case. He thinks Todd will be 60 to 40% favorite against David.
SPEAKER_04: I understand. Okay. Melbourne Table Kings, thank you for your super chat, my friends. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. So, Vladimir? Todd Hutchings, David Dadikyan. I think David will win. Not because Todd...
SPEAKER_03: david is the favorite
SPEAKER_02: uh he has a little more chances uh maybe because he is more weak and maybe he will manage to enforce his uh style so he says that david dadikian is gonna win against sata yes yeah that that is like like david dadikian's win against iraqi was impressive
SPEAKER_02: Tata Shing's win against Ongarbaev was impressive. We will see. Can you remind us your opinion about this match one more time, Ivan? I said that when Todd pulled against Ongarbaev, I thought Ongarbaev would win quite easily with a quick top roll. But Todd surprised me
SPEAKER_02: very much uh and now i cannot uh vote against him um i think that uh before the match uh with anger i would think that david would be the favorite because he is very quick uh with his top role and he would the top role uh thought like um like he did against iraqli and um but now i'm not sure and i think that uh thought uh perhaps uh
SPEAKER_04: He's the favorite, yes. But Ivan, do you realize that when Dadikyan pulled Irakli, Irakli couldn't pass the center, not even one centimeter, you know. One round he stopped, the other rounds David dominated. But whenever Ongarbev pulled Irakli, the match was closer. In one round, I remember Irakli even took Ongarbev to here and from here he survived.
SPEAKER_04: so do you think that david may have better you know side pressure and wrists than ongar and maybe he can block maybe he can block uh or you think that the match is gonna stop and eventually he will be endurance game maybe david has better state pressure yes is more versatile and perhaps
SPEAKER_02: He has better top roll and he has better triceps move. Yes, with the flop wrist or something like that. Like he pulled Kurdecha. Oh, yeah. But hook is not his best technique. And David was good at hook. So, yes, perhaps his side pressure is better. And in this case, he has a little more chances than Angarboev.
SPEAKER_04: I understand. Anyways, guys, in less than three weeks, I will see you guys in Istanbul, all four of you, all of you. And thank you very much, David, thank you. Vladimir, thank you very much. And Ivan and Roman, thank you for helping for the translation. And you all have a great evening. Do you guys want to say anything lastly, David?
SPEAKER_00: It is a great pleasure to have you here with us today. Thank you very much for the opportunity to talk to you. What are your thoughts on the future? It is a great pleasure to be here. I am very happy to be here.
SPEAKER_01: I will work as much as I can, and I will do my best in the future. Thank you for your attention.
SPEAKER_00: Engin, he said, like, thanks. He's thankful to you for giving all the opportunities every time. He said also he's thankful for all of us to together have this conversation and this meeting. And he said that he will try his best. He wishes also best his opponent and he tries to put a really good fight and come very well prepared.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, thanks. And Vladimir, any last words before we finish? Vladimir, do you have anything to say before we finish our conversation? If there is anything. Well, I am very glad that I can take part in such an event, that I was invited. And I hope that I will be able to show a good form, to speak well.
SPEAKER_03: Before the tournaments or before... Well, yes, before the competition, I say a lot about the form. It happens for the first time that I say it before the competition. Usually, I just tell everything. It's not that I'm superstitious, it just seems to me that it's like a tail. And so, well, not many words, so to speak. But I'm glad that I can take part, fight.
SPEAKER_02: So he is very happy for the opportunity and thankful for the opportunity to take part in this great event. So he hopes to get to Istanbul and show his best there. Tell him that I know this might be a little bit early. Maybe. Maybe he will even improve more. Mask him.
SPEAKER_04: If he somehow loses, will this affect his motivation in a negative way? Or is he going to train and come back harder? I'm not saying he's going to win. I say it's a close match. But if somehow, if he's not ready. Vladimir, if you suddenly assume that you will lose, how will it affect your motivation? Will you continue to train and strive
SPEAKER_03: How do you think it will affect you? If I lose, I will say so, Ivan, that I now have such plans to return to armwrestling and earn money. I will say so. That is, it will not be East against West, or it will be AMC or some other tournaments. I will fight, but I will say right away that it will be
SPEAKER_03: It depends. Now I want to change my job. I live in Germany. If I manage to combine my job and sports, I will fight for money. I will not go to non-commercial tournaments. From the point of view of psychology, if you lose, it will not affect anything. It's not a problem.
SPEAKER_02: so it's not a problem for him to lose not a problem for his motivation he was going to get back to armwrestling he wants to try himself in professional armwrestling not amateur anymore and so it doesn't matter much he just wants to get back and pull yeah yeah but it doesn't mean that he's not gonna win this time right
SPEAKER_04: Can you tell him? No, he's not going to lose. Yeah, that's what I want to hear. That's good, that's good. And one last thing I want to say, and we're finished. Most likely, not most likely, but probably, the winner of this match in April will pull Sarmat.
SPEAKER_02: If Sarmat gets permission, but he is trying now. I have a question. What do you think about the fight with Sarmat? The winner of your pair will probably get a fight in April with Sarmat Diburov. There are talks, maybe he will get out of Russia for a fight. What do you think about this athlete? Didn't you fight with him?
SPEAKER_03: I've never fought him, but I can say that I look at this athlete, how AMC appeared, and I want to say that I don't see anything supernatural in him. For example, if we fought in the net, I would be more afraid of him than in a rum fight.
SPEAKER_02: He noticed that this sportsman from first AMC tournaments and he thinks he's strong but nothing supernatural and that he would not be afraid of him in an armfight in several rounds. He would be more afraid perhaps to pull in one round but not in many rounds. So it's okay for him to fall.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. And did David understand? David you translate to David? I will translate him now. .
SPEAKER_00: You mean Sarmati Blov, that's the name? What? The name of the athlete he wants to make sure... No, the AMC champion, Sarmati. Yes, that's right, Sarmati, the AMC champion. Well, I don't know. I don't know what to say.
SPEAKER_01: I think he is a very good sportsman. He is a very good sportsman. I saw him once in 2005. Two years later, in 2003 or 2003, in 2005, he won the Olympic Games in Sarotvap, Sarajevo. Well, I think he was very... I think he was very good.
SPEAKER_01: It's a fact that I was able to do it. I was able to do it because I didn't have to go through all that. I was able to do it because I didn't have to go through all that. I was able to do it because I didn't have to go through all that. I was able to do it because I didn't have to go through all that. I was able to do it because I didn't have to go through all that. I was able to do it because I didn't have to go through all that. I was able to do it because I didn't have to go through all that. I was able to do it because I didn't have to go through all that. I was able to do it because I didn't have to go through all that. I was able to do it because I didn't have to go through all that.
SPEAKER_00: David mentioned first of all we will decide me and Vladimir who deserves that match but for sure Sarmat is the opponent that is definitely worthy of the title he said though he thinks David thinks that prior AMC tournament like previous one when Vala got on second place in finals he thinks he believes Vala won but regardless the winner he thinks that
SPEAKER_00: uh he will have a definitely good opponent what's the opponent if he manages to overcome vladimir first yeah but but sarmat already won last three amc i think he deserves yeah yeah sorry sorry david also i forgot to mention like last years sarmat is not uh giving anyone title he said so he's definitely okay once again thank you guys thank you very much and see you in three weeks less than three weeks you all take care of yourself yeah
SPEAKER_04: Thank you, David. Thank you, Vladimir. Thank you, Ivan. Thank you, Roman. See you soon.
