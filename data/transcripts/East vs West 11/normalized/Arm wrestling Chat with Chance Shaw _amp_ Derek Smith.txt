SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: hello everyone
SPEAKER_01: hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello
SPEAKER_01: Yeah. Good to see you as well. Yeah. It's been a while. Yeah. I just wanted to chat with you guys about arm wrestling and also Derek Smith is gonna join us. Okay. Cool. And so we can just chat about, uh, arm wrestling. So how are you, how is your elbow injury? You remember you had one.
SPEAKER_01: during the qualification. It happened before that, right? Yeah, it happened when I was facing David Arabouli.
SPEAKER_02: the second or third round uh when i i was here trying to turn something yeah yeah yeah yeah that happens that happens yeah yeah but no it's good uh it feels healthy i haven't heard uh or felt anything in practice or anything so i'm i'm happy to to be injury free now especially with the stem cells i got today are you are you are you uh again the number one in florida
SPEAKER_02: uh me and brad uh it's it's hard to say because uh we haven't pulled at all uh only in practice and you know practice is practice but yeah maybe maybe not yeah how does it feel in the practice
SPEAKER_02: yeah it's it's hard to say because every time we practice it seems like brad is um like tired or had just had a match or something so then it's easy for me but i know that he's not fresh so it doesn't really yeah okay i understand i understand yeah yeah what what do you think about like
SPEAKER_01: Brett pulling 105 last time he came here he pulled 115 but he said I still have some extra weight I can be 231. like is he still on that way how does he look to you like I didn't see him recently yeah I saw him I saw him yesterday he's probably maybe 120 so oh yeah
SPEAKER_01: gain weight yeah instead of yeah well you know it's it's the holidays in the states so we have thanksgiving and christmas it's yeah so you think it's a temporary weight because of the holidays yeah i think so i think maybe 110 maybe 105 i don't know i mean we have one 105 and 115 at the east he won his last match i mean that was his only match and
SPEAKER_01: know what i was thinking you know arsene lily hasn't pulled for the last 11 years so if if he just comes you cannot really put him like in the like really elite like tatashins or dadichan or like how do you think that after 11 years of break you know like him pulling uh bread brandy i think that could be really interesting really really interesting that could be a lot of fun
SPEAKER_01: yeah yeah yeah it would be good yeah this is what i was thinking but um i'm sure that people will say oh come on couldn't you find someone stronger but listen you don't arm wrestle with your name you know not not like your career either you arm wrestle with your current shape and we talk about someone that hasn't pulled for 11 years you know yeah yeah absolutely yeah you don't want to give him to the top guy right off the bat yeah i i mean he's training now he said i cannot
SPEAKER_01: promise you that i'm gonna be back again but i'm training and i'm enjoying it and then he said like who do you think that i would i should pull and the breath's name came to me and i told him how what about this guy and he wanted to see and then i i shared the scott and kyle hashing so much uh and then yeah yeah i think that that could be a really fun match yeah
SPEAKER_01: The one guy just said that he doesn't understand anything except Turkish. I said it's an international organization and I need to speak English. And how about you? What are your plans?
SPEAKER_02: um well at the moment the only thing on my mind is um i got engaged so we're planning a wedding and so i'm just focused on yeah yes sir congratulations thank you thank you so um i'm back training uh getting stronger cutting my weight down uh but at the moment i have i have no matches or anything like that planned how about the florida event that you are uh promoting are you gonna pull in that event
SPEAKER_02: um i i made poland and the florida then it's the east versus west qualifier um so yeah i i might pull in there it just depends on how i'm feeling yeah and if this if you pull there you still will pull against brad uh if brad pulls yeah
SPEAKER_02: Brad and I talked about potentially just going in and taking one and two and locking down the spots for Florida, but we'll see. The finals will be in Florida? Yeah, the finals are going to be in Florida. I don't know if it's announced yet. I'm not sure. I think I heard that you advertised something, but I thought it was a qualification. Yeah, it's a qualification.
SPEAKER_02: that that i i announced but i've been talking with paul lynn and james reed about the finals in florida paul mentioned this paul mentioned about florida but i don't think that there was an announcement you know yeah no announcement yet but the venue is locked down uh everything's locked down we just have to announce it and it's gonna be when exactly uh in may oh may may okay yeah that's good that's good yeah i'm excited to have it in florida
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, Florida for sure is one of the leading states in Aymeric about armwrestling. The way that you guys are taking things seriously and professionally with those yellow color jerseys and everything, it already became a very respected brand. I have been following.
SPEAKER_01: Thank you. Do you follow? I think Derek came. Hello, Derek. You hear us, Derek? Do you follow, Chance?
SPEAKER_01: east versus west uh card everything you know the upcoming matches of course of course yeah yeah yeah how many times you have been here three times uh four four times wow so you are one of the veterans of the east versus west in such a young age yeah hello i'm sorry we don't we don't hear you derek

SPEAKER_02: um i don't remember what i was saying i was just saying that i'm very happy you're one of the veterans you know yeah i'm very lucky that you are gracious enough to invite me so many times and i'm hoping i can earn a spot back uh yeah i hope so i hope so we would like to see you here again and derek how are you i know you just woke up
SPEAKER_01: you just woke up it's probably it was the 10 30 over there in the morning uh it is yeah 10 30. I woke up about four hours ago I mean no sorry I woke up a half hour ago I slept for four hours uh oh you slept very less huh okay okay and are you gonna be in the cart armors cart no no and and Derek how is your shape
SPEAKER_03: Good, good. On most lifts, I am about 10 pounds below where I was against Mehdi, when I prepped for Mehdi. So you are just keeping yourself in right there. I was pretty far below that, but now I'm back up to there. And so I'm really excited about the way I'm progressing right now. I'm getting a lot stronger, a lot faster. How is your weight now?
SPEAKER_03: um how was my my rate wait your weight yeah oh wait my weight about 335. 335. you lost some weight or um i got down to 320 which was really light for me for a little bit when was it when was it when was it um about um two months ago i was 320.
SPEAKER_03: 320 okay yeah when I pulled Tom Nelson I was 370. when I pulled Tim I was about 360 and then when I go to East first West I'm usually about 350 345 350. okay yeah okay so you were in the East versus West eight or nine oh and I can't remember uh
SPEAKER_01: it wasn't was it jerry match or the jerry atmosphere nine i have a card nine okay so you were in the devon dennis match uh no no no no no ervis ervin steven match yeah yeah yeah okay okay listen this it hasn't been even two years to me it's just like five ten years you know like this thing you know just like it was just too busy too busy chance and like i don't know uh
SPEAKER_01: Only like this February will be two years since this regular East vs. West started with pay-per-view. Yeah. Was that when I came out there and you had the round robin with the lighter guys? You count that as the beginning, the first one? Yeah, but it wasn't East vs. West. It was the best 78. Right, right. Best 78. And I had a super match with Viorel Dobrin. I think you were filming. Yep.
SPEAKER_01: You were right, yeah, yeah, yeah. I was there since the first one, hang on, since the first, well, at least at the hotel, right? Was that the first event at the hotel? First of all, event what? At the hotel, at that hotel? No, my match with Arthur Makaro in 2019 was there as well. Oh, okay. Yeah, yeah, but yours was during the pandemic and, like, all restrictions and everything. If you remember, referees had their masks and everything, you know?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah. Hey, listen, when you came here, I was in very good shape. I don't know if you remember or not, but I was in very good shape. First time when I pulled, you know, like I have a photo with, with Adam as we are like this, my arm was bigger than his, but it's not, but it looks. You still got it. You do whatever you want. I mean, listen, I can concentrate. I, whenever I go train, I'm like,
SPEAKER_01: Am I betraying East versus West? My mind should be with it. What am I doing here? But I really want to compete as well, but I don't want to make any mistake with East versus West. But I understand one thing. If you want to be successful, you really need to focus on one thing.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, you can do other things, you can have a job and this, but East versus West organizing that is not a normal thing and it's really a hard thing to do. And so Chance, you said that you are following East versus West, you said, of course, that is one of the reasons that I would like to chat with you guys, because I don't consider you guys
SPEAKER_01: uh only arm wrestlers i consider you guys arm wrestling fans as well like like me you understand like you you like you guys yeah both you and derek you know i'll just um so let's talk about this uh upcoming event and i would like to hear your opinions because you guys are also very knowledgeable guys and
SPEAKER_01: Oh, man, I'm scared you're going to say some name I don't know, man. There's some new names. Oh, listen, listen. If you know, there are 14 matches. If you are knowledgeable enough about 10 of them, it's acceptable. If half, I will be disappointed, like seven. If less than seven, I won't even say hello to you from now on. Okay, okay, okay.
SPEAKER_01: okay just are you not following the east versus west events that you are not competing you are right i watch all of them yeah yeah let's go let's go with the uh robbie toppy versus aymeric aymeric is from france and i think where did you meet him when you were in europe when devon came and prudnik was aymeric there as well
SPEAKER_02: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I met Emmerich. He he actually picked me up from the airport and drove me around. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Super, super, super strong guy. Left handed. I wasn't familiar with him before I met him.
SPEAKER_01: But he's really impressive. I've seen videos of him taking Prudnik's wrist on the left. He had a super match with Krasimir. He had a real super match with Krasimir, and it was a close one. I think Krasimir won, but it was a very close one, yeah. And you guys know Robby Choppy, right? I mean, when I say you guys know, the guy has been there for more than 25 years, probably, because he said that he has competed in 2001.
SPEAKER_01: And so to compete in the 2001 WAF, you really need to be competing for some years. You don't directly go to the World Championships as soon as you meet Arnold Sting. But he said that he had some breaks. So when I say you guys know, I just want you to tell me, what do you know about Robbie? Robbie is unknown to the East.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah, as far as like 110 kilo guy goes, he's he's towards the top of our list here in northern North Aymeric. In my opinion, tons of huge wins. Obviously he won the East versus West qualifier left handed in a really strong class. I think Matt Mask was in his class if if I'm not mistaken on the left and he ended up winning that so super impressive.
SPEAKER_01: He's been around a long time, like you said. I think as far as raw horsepower goes, he's the strongest guy in that match. So he's stronger than Aymeric? I believe so. Yeah. I think Aymeric is technically better. More technical. Okay. Yeah. So, yeah. And he has come to some names that he has beaten, like Rambert and, you know, like many guys. He even had...
SPEAKER_01: win or more than one win against cody merit he said in the past he said yeah that was in wal i think like 2015.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah. And Derek, what do you know about Robbie? What can you tell us so that the Eastern fans would get to know him? I've pulled Robbie a few times. He is left and right-handed. Left-handed, he's strong both arms, but I feel like his wrist is better left-handed. It's more connected. And he's just a little more efficient or coordinated left-handed than he is right-handed. Left-handed, though...
SPEAKER_03: it it all comes together well our last match left-handed i um i was trying to roll him out i was getting pretty wild everything i had to the top roll and it was still i barely got it straightened out and then his arm was way more than my left arm this is three four years ago um and then he was able to reel me in and pull me across now my left is pretty far from my right but he um
SPEAKER_03: He's way more connected. Right-handed, I think he would have some problems with his wrists, especially pulling against Emmerich, who's going to be tacking that wrist. I feel like Robbie would have a good chance. He's going to be left-handed much?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah. Yeah. So I feel like Robbie might have, I think, a good chance if it goes to the straps and he can really start using all those big muscles he has and things like that. But I've seen a Merrick pull an old video with him and Devin, like an old practice, like a long time ago, I believe. I think if I'm thinking of the right person and he was giving Devin hell back in the day, I think he was even beating Devin up at practice. So it'll be, I think, an outside match. But I think if Robbie can really anchor him down, I think Robbie's definitely in it for sure.
SPEAKER_01: by the way chance uh get well my friend look like you you cut cold yeah yeah a little bit yeah yeah any any time that i travel and stay in a hotel i get a runny nose yeah yeah where are you now i'm in i'm in vegas for the virus oh yeah yeah yeah and marcio barboza and petrenko good match
SPEAKER_01: I think Chinese would have some more idea. Have you ever pulled, Marcio? Just in New Jersey when I was there, we did a little bit of side pulling, but nothing serious. Practice. Okay. But you still have some idea even by then? Yeah. Okay. And you pulled Petrenko?
SPEAKER_01: You gave him a tough time. He thought that he would flash you, but you kind of gassed out. I don't know if it's... Yeah. And how do you see this match?
SPEAKER_02: I think it's an extremely close match. I really wouldn't be surprised either way. I think Marcio has more tools. I think Marcio is faster. But I think as far as raw power goes, I'm going to lean towards Petrenko. I think Petrenko's hand is a bit better as well. It's really hard to say. I think to me it's 50-50. I'm really, really excited. When I saw that match announced, that's one of my favorite matches on the card.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, yeah. So you are saying it can go either way? Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised. Maybe a little strong while Marcio is well-rounded. Yeah, exactly. Marcio has tools. So if Marcio tries something round one that doesn't work, he can try something completely different round two. I don't think Petrenko has those same abilities.
SPEAKER_03: and you derek uh yeah marcio against uh pavlo that one that they had a while ago marcia really impressed me um traditionally if marcio always ends up getting a foul trouble kind of a lot but he he did uh pretty well in that match and like you said i mean marcio's been more versatile on the table i mean in that one match he went all the way to a super native position
SPEAKER_03: and rolled all the way out twice, from fully supernaded to all the way around Pavlo. So I think Marcio has always been a very capable person. And if he can stay out of foul trouble, I think he can do crazy, amazing things. Petrenko, I think...
SPEAKER_03: sticks to his move and trusts his strength a lot more. I don't think he's as experimental on the table as Marcio down to try some crazier stuff. So either way, I think it'll be exciting. Obviously, Marcio brings a lot of excitement and adrenaline to the match. But yeah, I think it'd be really close as well. I mean, physically, you see him walk up there, Marcio's probably going to look a lot bigger than Petrenko. But I think the match is going to look really exciting. I think it'll be whether Petrenko's... Physically, Marcio looks bigger than...
SPEAKER_01: uh petrenko i think so i don't know i think last time you like you met him chance he was also big there right with a bit yeah yeah he's he's not i mean maybe marcio's a little bit bigger but it's not by much yeah well maybe cameraman i mean it's this camera yeah yeah some some some people are really i don't know maybe you have seen more of marcio
SPEAKER_01: And a little size, I don't know, but like Marcio's physique is just like, I mean, like great, you understand? He's just shoulder has and everything, you know? Yeah. Who do you think wins? What's that? Who do you think wins? I'm organizer.
SPEAKER_01: i know you got a favorite in all these matches i know you have someone picked bro um like there is one match that is just killing me like i don't know and really like like i can't see like this is just like nightmare you know i see maybe it will not go as uh how i think but there is one match it's prudnik versus alicia murado that match is like one of the best matches
SPEAKER_01: I'm talking about on the papers maybe one of them will dominate I don't know but like whenever I look at it now right now I just like my elbows hurt from the pressure that will be applied and long this is how I imagine the match but I don't I cannot share um unless it is 50 50 and this matches yeah for me 50 50 uh alijan versus prudnik and voila hkt versus either hand
SPEAKER_01: um chance do you want me to remind who they are or you kind of yeah you remember or no if you don't mind reminding no voila the georgian guy that cool david samush for title uh two events or like before that was that nine
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah. And one round he beat Samushia. And then Samushia caught him and gassed him out and beat him. But the guy is a very, very strong guy. And Aydar Khan is the one that beat Mindaugas for the world title, lightweight world title, the Kazakh guy. And then he beat him 3-3-0. But the guy cannot lose weight anymore. So he will be pulling 187. So both of these guys are 187. And Aydar Khan right now is 190 pounds.
SPEAKER_02: Wow. I remember, if I'm not mistaken, I was at the event where he pulled Mindaugas and he had to show up and cut like 20 pounds the day before. Yeah. Yeah. So I think that that's a killer match. Probably going to be the grindiest match of the night. It's always...
SPEAKER_02: always seems like the lighter guys get into these dog fights that are absolutely brutal and it's really exciting to watch um i i think uh the kazakh has probably a bigger gas tank um i would see the early rounds favoring the georgian and then the later it goes uh favoring the kazakh but uh that's gonna be a really explosive match they they both go outside and either hand
SPEAKER_01: is known to be one of the fastest pullers in the world while wala is very strong guy very strong guy but we will see like they georgian guys i mean i don't want to say names but even some of the heavier top rollers they say they have problem uh with wala especially when they try to top roll him you know and we will see and derek do you remember the guys or
SPEAKER_01: Now you lost one. One credit go down. You have four credit to lose. Now, 13. Three more you can. More than that. If it goes nine, then I will just look at you like this. I'm going to start Googling these people right now. Okay. Let me go to the next one.
SPEAKER_01: Let me go to the next one. Artem Taino versus Gurb Taber is the left arm. Artem Taino, Derek Smith is the one that beat Sacho. I'm going to start with you. I'm not going to allow you to Google this. Artem versus Gurb is...
SPEAKER_03: yeah is is really exciting i i'm really excited that uh the item is on the on the card lately i mean that he showed up and stuff i've been watching him for years um i mean i watched i remember watching bull crazy george a long time years ago when he was a lot younger you know and um and he looked really really good last event he was uh east versus west so um i think he
SPEAKER_03: He's very explosive on the table. Obviously, Zurab's always trying to sink in that hook and trying to get into this long grinder and start applying that side pressure. I think that Artem is going to have more options than Zurab and maybe be more explosive.
SPEAKER_03: do think if rob's able to sink that in and really start cementing that elbow that that and start doing the side pressure hits that that can that'll be his lane if he finds it but i don't think he'll find it personally i think i think arnold will be a little too explosive uh high and sideways or whatever way he kind of wants i think it'll be a little bit too much i think i understand you chance
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I'm going to agree with Derek on this one. I really see Artem being a bit too much for Zurab. I just, I think he has the speed. What's the reason? Speed, well-roundedness?
SPEAKER_02: Yes, speed mostly. Excuse me. I don't think that Artem is necessarily a whole lot stronger than Zurab. But if it's close and one guy is faster, you know, with a better move off the go, I tend to favor them. Now, if Zurab can set it and stop it, he has a lane to come back through. But...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I mean, after I saw what Artem did with Sasho, I was really impressed. And I don't necessarily see Zurab a much higher level than Sasho. So I think that the results should be about the same. I understand. Okay. Matt Mask versus Wagner Bortolato. Derek. Right arm.
SPEAKER_01: um just make sure the table's bolted down obviously first the first super yeah reinforced everyone tells me the same thing you know i i just can't i can't enjoy one event without worrying you know about something last time it was about devon versus some of the russian guys who were trading them you know and then this time is the table just
SPEAKER_03: Hey, it's better to worry about the table than some kind of crazy fight. Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right, you're right. I think right-handed, I think Matt will be too much. I think Matt's going to take his wrist and then a lot of violent, ah, ah, ah, ah, until...
SPEAKER_03: Wagner wears down. Now, Wagner might have this shoulder-press, ugly lane if it's explosive enough to maybe catch Matt off guard. But I think Matt, one, is crazy hungry, obviously, because he hasn't been placing too well. And then I think Wagner isn't what he is on right as he is on left. So I think those things will equal up to Matt eventually taking the win. But I think either way, it's going to be a really exciting match to watch.
SPEAKER_02: i was actually talking to matt about this match last night uh i'm super excited for it um when's the last time wagner has pulled left-handed it was what oh yeah right right here yeah i think he said like some years ago in brazil in brazil events yeah but he has taken at least one time second place with right arm at 12.
SPEAKER_02: yeah 2012 yeah yeah yeah back back in you know before i was in the sport i heard he was very very strong on the right but we didn't see him as much because always right was less than left always
SPEAKER_02: Right, yeah. But he was still, you know, very good both. Strong, yeah, very strong, yeah. But he was dealing with an injury. So now that he's coming back to pull right-handed, I think it's great for the community as a whole. Like, Wagner is one of the most exciting arm wrestlers, and so is Matt Mask. So I think that this match is just going to be loud and yelling and screaming and, you know, flailing the arms and running around. And so to me, it's easily going to be the most entertaining match on the card.
SPEAKER_02: matt is probably going to be able to take wagner's wrist but just when wagner loses his wrist it doesn't mean he loses the the match a lot of times he just drives side and and uh i mean he's he's what like 340 pounds just massive guy just i think right now or 350. three fit what yeah so when someone or something yeah
SPEAKER_02: when someone that big is just you know fired up and driving as as hard as you can sideways that's scary so uh I think it could go either way but I'm taking that maybe like 60 40. well maybe 342 I don't know I think he said 156 uh kilo 150 is 346 is about
SPEAKER_01: what 13 say maybe 343 or something yeah okay this guy is not that old you know the guy is just like full muscle under 56 kilo what were you saying we're gonna need an oxygen tank on the on the stage he's it weighs more than me i'm six foot eight he's gonna be breathing heavy he's been breathing heavy um
SPEAKER_01: See, I thought traditionally Daniel won this every time they met up. But then people were telling me I was wrong on that one. So I was talking to some people about it. No, not every time. I think when you come to Istanbul, when you watch me against Viorel Doblin, in the same event, Daniel beat... Sorry, Mindaugas beat Daniel. Oh, okay.
SPEAKER_03: Um, I mean, I'm a, I'm a big, Mindaugas is awesome. I love talking to him. I think he's a great guy. I think he's very intelligent. Um, I just, Daniel's looked so amazing, uh, recently. It's hard to, it's hard to just see Daniel's arm getting opened up right now. Um, I mean, so I'm leaning towards Daniel winning it, but, um,
SPEAKER_03: Man, Mindaugas is a smart guy. He's really smart. And I think he might be able to find a way around it. And Mindaugas is very strong as well, of course. Yeah. I don't know. I'm leaning towards Daniel on this one. But either way, I think it's going to be a long match regardless. Because Daniel's definitely not going to be able to rip through Mindaugas, I don't believe. Not fresh, not quick. I think either way, it'll be a lot of adjustments and things and figuring out spots. But I think in the end, it'll be straps,
SPEAKER_03: Daniel's holding on to Medavius, anchoring him down and starting to wear him down a little bit and open him up. We'll kind of see how I see it going. Any chance? Yeah. Is this the rank two and rank three guy for the East versus West? No, this will be for the world title match because the number one guy.
SPEAKER_01: 85 kilos so this is world title match here yeah um i mean i see the match going exactly how derek sees the match going strap he can't stop copying me he doesn't admit that he doesn't admit that he doesn't know the guys and just because he doesn't know he's googling
SPEAKER_02: yeah i'm joking i'm on my phone i don't have a computer so um of course you know the guys yeah yeah i know i know both of them uh
SPEAKER_02: i actually i i hired daniel for some coaching for some arm wrestling specific training so i know them both very well um daniel has a really good sticking point with his arm kind of open here where he can just constantly continue to drag through drag through drag through um but he he really has all sorts of options he can hook he can top roll um don't see him pressing as much but um you know he has that as well mandalga is the same thing he's very well rounded most of the time he's going to go outside especially against
SPEAKER_01: Daniel never tries to go outside with Milagros. He tried one time, and then Milagros flash pinned him. But Daniel was lucky that he fouled during that flash pin. And then restarted again. So what he tries to do, he tries to hook him. And if he risk goes, and then he goes like this. Yeah, yeah. So I'm taking Daniel, but not by a huge margin. 55-45 Daniel. 55-45?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah. Okay. Okay. That is very, very tough math, you know. Very, very tough. Do you know what their record is? I kind of think that, like, it is, like, maybe for Dania's every two win, Mindaugas has a win. This is something like that, yeah. But I will just try to.
SPEAKER_01: show you guys okay the match that it was in the moldova event was crazy crazy crazy much you know and okay never mind maybe i would find it later but yeah so oh okay one second
SPEAKER_01: One second. Andre Yakhveladze. David Daniel had a war with Nur Nurdalet before Plymouth in the Augusta Day? No. In that event, there was no Nur Nurdalet. That was the second 78 kilo event. Not the first one. Okay, so let's go to the next one. Oleg Zhokh versus Avtandil Tutberidze. David you...
SPEAKER_01: like even care to search about the guy because he's only 19 years old from georgia do you know who he is no i i don't know who he is yeah because he is really new uh i think i don't think i'm gonna take any credit from derek for not knowing this one because this is just normal the guy is just because even i first time saw this year before i saw him at the europeans
SPEAKER_01: And at the Europeans, he won the youth category easily. And then before the senior category, he pulled everyone at the side table, including Rino Macic a little bit. You know, they say that Rino didn't try. I would believe that because Rino went on and won the seniors as well, while this guy couldn't win 85kg in seniors. But the guy went to Kazakhstan and won the world's over
SPEAKER_01: no um you know this guy and uh we are a goblin so this guy is very good incredible top roller yeah and he is going he is the 85 kilo champion of the wars in waf and oleg zok is the 80 kilo champion so do you like many people when i asked them they said
SPEAKER_01: We don't need to know the guy. If the guy is in the same way as Oleg Zhokh, and if he's top-rolling, we don't need to know who he is. He's not going to win. This is what they say. Yeah, I agree. Yeah. You agree? Yeah, I agree. I don't... Do you know the Gamtenazze, Irakli Gamtenazze? Yeah. Irakli Gamtenazze, I think, is his trainer.
SPEAKER_01: And we have a group, you know, Atlas group, Team East. And there, like, Irakli Gamtenazer said that, like, he's going to beat Zouk 6-0. Yeah. And Oleg said that, you know, are you joking, you know? Like, and then there was, like, some back and forth, you know. He was like, you will see, you know, what's going to happen.
SPEAKER_01: So it looks like they are very confident. Georgians are very confident with this guy. It's like Bacho type of hype, I feel. So what do you guys think?
SPEAKER_03: from the information I gave you. Well, Georgians are never not confident. I've never seen a not confident Georgian arm wrestler before. That's what I was thinking. But, I mean, to say you can top roll Oleg at his weight, like, that's blasphemy. That's crazy to say. I mean, who does that? Who top rolls him at his weight? Who's the last person to do it? Listen, listen, Derek. People say, Paul Strange says that, please take off one credit from Derek anyways.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, how can I, like, I mean, fans. Was it with the Super Chat? If it wasn't a Super Chat, it doesn't count, Hengen. Oh, yeah, okay. It was the Super Chat. So, okay, you guys are saying Oleg Zog is winning? I think so, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Todd and Oleg's love child. He says Oleg is returning to form. Very excited. Okay, let's go to the next one. We have David Samushia versus Vladimir Maiorov.
SPEAKER_01: Any idea about Vladimir Maiorov? Yeah. Didn't Vladimir win at the AMC event? No. Vladimir won 2018 Moldova event over Bojidar, Plemen, Irakli Zirakashvili, Vladislav Krasovski. You know, he was first. And with left arm, he only lost to Oleg Zhokh. And in 2018, he pulled Rast Serdekian with left arm.
SPEAKER_01: He beat him like this. And yeah, in the same category, 171. And he only lost to Ali Can Muratov, left arm. And the right arm, he took third place. But early round, he met Ali Can Muratov. Ali Can took his wrist, long, long, long match, and he beat Ali Can. But I can say that active pull with a few starts was very near two minutes.
SPEAKER_01: So that event he took third place. And David Samushia is his opponent now, but the guy took some break some years. He came with the Swiss Open early November. He dominated everyone.
SPEAKER_01: don't know and so now he's i offered him the match he said i need some more time and i said okay thank you and then a week later or something he come back he said no i want to pull him and i said okay and then i set the match um in fact i was trying to set the match between sasho and david for 95 kilo that was so much yeah yeah because david said that he didn't say it that way
SPEAKER_01: like I don't have anyone to play with you know you know and then he said how about me going 95 and I said okay I asked Samushia Samushia I'm I'm gonna give you answer in two days I waited two days and then Samushia didn't answer so next day this guy contacted me and I accepted 85 kilometers Samushia said I'm ready I said sorry Samushia because you said two days but you didn't and he said he didn't have internet or this and that
SPEAKER_01: because i asked him again you know two days finish what is your answer he didn't answer so so i gave this guy yes and then so i can't change uh so do you think there is a chance to be double summation 85. i don't see really anyone beating samusha 85. i mean when who's the last person to beat samusha poland but paul was 100 kilo samusha was right yeah
SPEAKER_01: Not in the same way. There was like around a little bit more than 25 pounds difference between them. It was Samushia's first match since 2019. And then he came with two months training. He still was very close. He was 3-2.
SPEAKER_02: It took one of the top 95 kilo guys to beat Samushia. I don't really see anyone at 85 kilos beating Samushia. I'm not very familiar with the other guy, but yeah, I will take Samushia every time, no matter who he is against at 85. Okay, yeah. And you, Derek? Yeah, I agree with Chance. I think Samushia at 85, dominant. Dominant.
SPEAKER_01: We will see. The next one. Rino Matic versus Ivan Matyushenko. By the way, Aymeric says hello to you guys and to me. Hello, Aymeric. Yeah. And Rino Matic. Chance, what do you think about Rino, first of all?
SPEAKER_02: Rino is super impressive. He's so young. He's only, what, 21? No, 19. 19. 19? Okay. This kid is 20. 20, okay. So 19. Yeah, he's incredible. Super strong. I mean, the kid is just amazingly impressive. I think he's definitely in the future.
SPEAKER_02: very very impressed when he when he beat very impressed when he beat like sundries and other guys yeah yeah absolutely uh that being said i think uh and then you're gonna say but yeah i i still think matashenko is too much i mean matashenko like is is just so impressive uh and he has been for a long time um
SPEAKER_02: way that he can set a hook against anybody is incredible and i don't i don't see reno going around it or going through it so you are saying anyone is gonna win i think so with with the most respect i can give to reno uh especially only being 19 i still i'm taking ivan okay and derek
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I mean... Listen, listen. That makes Ivan even more scared, right? To look very quiet, serious, and don't say anything. And then he's not built like very intimidating, you know, like he doesn't like big muscles or something. And then he comes, he doesn't talk shit, he's very respectful, and then goes like, boom, boom, boom. And then you watch the match to understand what happened in the 0.25 speed, you know?
SPEAKER_03: And then you're like, oh, okay, now I understand. Dude, Machecho, he's so amazing. He's such an amazing arm wrestler. I'm so happy he's at East vs. West, to be honest. It was a big moment just for me to meet him in 2015 WAF. And he remembered me when I saw him last year. He's like, hey, I remember. And I don't even look the same at all. I mean, I know I'm only 23, but I mean, I was like 13 when I went to WAF.
SPEAKER_03: uh the i but i'm really excited to see this match i think that reno i don't see a lot of lanes for him i don't think he's gonna roll be able to roll out um yvonne especially on left hand yvonne's obviously i was doing my homework on yvonne muchchenko for a little bit uh recently you know
SPEAKER_03: trying to get ready for that potential match one day and um he's just so long that's the biggest thing that people don't talk about is how long uh yvonne's arm is which helps him so much in in setting that hook and to try to top roll him in any kind of conventional top roll is like in wild so i don't think there's an outside lane
SPEAKER_03: And then what you're going to you're going to shoulder roll or press the best hook, puller, left handed, maybe of all time, potentially. So I just don't see I just don't see a really viable lane for Rino, although it's kind of sucks because Rino is so awesome. He's doing so great right now in the sport and he's upsetting so many people. But I just don't think this is this is a lot. There's a lot to bite off and maybe he'll be wow us all again and maybe he will be the guy. I just I think the safe money is on Yvonne.
SPEAKER_01: snatch him you know up in a hook and uh pretty looking pretty comfortable inside that hook uh yeah one guy said that you know uh Michael Merck I mean special man handling John and his weight is like 88 yeah for sure he can be David um there was a mistake uh we were like asking Atlas to about their weight you know and but whenever they came and they were in I don't know if you can
SPEAKER_01: see but um just say one second oh it cut off for a sec uh 95.3 point yeah 95.3 sasho with the the light pants and the t-shirt without the
SPEAKER_01: uh shoes he weighed 95.3 when he beat john so he was not 88 there was a mistake you know i just need to because often people says he was 88 and beat john they bought john and sasha way in the same you know okay let's go to the john bersing versus krasimir costa you know last four matches
SPEAKER_01: who's going first oh you know let let let derek do the google search you just start cheers it's it's a it's an exciting match um last time john and krasimir had a super match didn't krasimir beat him 10 years ago yeah yeah a long time ago but yeah john john i think after 2010 like 2012 or something he had a shoulder surgery
SPEAKER_01: then he come back he was trying to recover he was getting stronger nothing to take away from crossing across me one five zero and i organized this match and so but john also had one week before the event he had in slovakia senecan he pulled against golemano it was like you know and but john won so is there a limit for this match yeah 105 105.
SPEAKER_02: yeah uh i i think that krasimir is gonna get the get the upset here um i'm rooting for john we all want to see john win every single time um just having him still in the sport what a legend uh you know we're we're all blessed to have him but i i i think that krasimir is a little bit above pressure
SPEAKER_02: will open his arm you feel yeah yeah i i think it'll look similar to how john and sasha looked uh john gets to be a little bit bigger he doesn't have to worry about the weight cut so that could change a lot of things but i think krasimir is a little bit above sasha right now um and uh krasimir looked really good against lachlan as well yeah i'm taking krasimir slight favorite rooting for john though
SPEAKER_01: One guy said that John has been very sick. It was sick, you know, at that time. Last, it was like more than a week ago. We still have two weeks to the event, you know, that the cold, you know, doesn't really stay so long, you know. I think John told me, especially his wrist is in very good shape. We will see. And you, Derek?
SPEAKER_03: I have a rule on YouTube. I always predict John Brzee to win, no matter what. So I'll never root against John or even say that John won't win, ever. Because over time, he's proven to always more than likely be the winner. So I always predict John Brzee to come out and win. I do think that Kratzy is doing really well. I'm really excited. I love watching him pull.
SPEAKER_03: So I'm really excited to watch this match. I think John's hand and wrist, John always having a lot of options, obviously. I don't know if he'll be able to stay in a deep hook with Grazi very long, but John's automatic pronation from wherever he wants on the table is always available. And especially if he's saying his wrist feels good. So I will go towards John, but I can understand this being a close match for sure. But if John doesn't mess around, he gets bored on this table. He tries some silly stuff sometimes because he gets bored.
SPEAKER_01: but uh hopefully lp john takes it real serious and wins yeah it's one one of five category and when he doesn't lose weight uh like 95 he didn't look super strong but 105 i remember john like he is very good but we will see yeah and artem morozov versus alex kurdecha left arm last three matches
SPEAKER_01: wants to start okay the one that who is uh as tall as these guys or even taller than yeah yeah that's right these little guys
SPEAKER_03: So Alex has been a big kind of question mark, right? Because he's been gone for a while. What he's been doing while he was gone, how hard he was training, did he level up? Was he sitting on the couch? You know, what was he doing kind of was the question and what form is he going to show up? Now, I pulled Alex left-handed a little bit last year in Texas. He came out here. And I know, I mean, I wasn't in the best shape, but I couldn't move an inch of his arm in any direction in any way, shape, or form with everything. Oh, when we were out there, Chance, when we were out there together. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: and so uh and so I mean that you felt his left arm and he was very strong yeah yeah like immovable strong like I couldn't even budget did you see the last video he put on YouTube um I don't know which one was it okay just like it will take like only one second this one because I know where it is uh is that when he was pulling with brutnik and armies
SPEAKER_03: um no i saw one of him pulling bacho it is this one here okay i will show you one second i will show you oh yeah it was like a highlight reel of his left-handed wins and stuff okay i think i saw this yeah yeah yes have you seen chance no
SPEAKER_01: This is with Corey West. Yeah, he even hooks with Corey here in a second, like deep hooks right through. This is after their Supermatch though, right? Yeah, yeah. They put right arm, I think, day before or something. And then I think next day they put, this is half hook. Oh, my God. Yeah. But this left arm, of course. I think Corey's right hook is better maybe. And then I think what is the next one? Next one.
SPEAKER_01: David says he is with Dennis after I was there. Yeah. Of course, he's the only train and Dennis's left is not as good as before. But I don't think Alex is here in competition shape either. Because why would you be in competition shape if you don't have a match?
SPEAKER_01: Didn't Dennis hang Alex up on that same after poll right there, right-handed? Was it Dennis? Right arm, yes. Dennis was better, yeah. And this is with Devin. Yeah. And the last one is kind of surprising. Of course, it was like years ago. This is with Laletin.
SPEAKER_01: this is when they were doing top eight I think so I think so Vitaly looks so much smaller there than the Vitaly right now yeah same with Alex as well Alex is also bigger now Alex is right now is around 370 pounds wow yeah yeah
SPEAKER_03: I'm a big fan of Alex's arm wrestling style. I really am. I think that he utilizes and depends on height mid-match more than almost anybody. I think that he likes to stay front. If he pulls the exact same left as he does right-handed...
SPEAKER_03: then he likes to stay front of the pad until the mission is accomplished. Front of the pad, knuckles up until finally you crumble, and then he will start moving backwards, but not until then. And so I think a lot of guys, they'll use their height in a setup like Devin and things like that, but once the match starts, they're not emphasizing height the entire match. So I'm a big fan of the way Alex arm wrestles.
SPEAKER_01: That being said, if Morozov, we're getting a healthy Morozov, we're getting like a full bore, not eating soup only Morozov. I think the last post, what did he say? He was like 85, 90%. But yeah. He said that he will be at his best shape, you know, till the event because that was probably one and a half month before the match. Maybe not, but at least it was like five weeks before the match he was here.
SPEAKER_03: Something in my brain just tells me I think Artyom will be able to get a hold of Alex. Like, I really like Alex's spot. But like I said, Alex is a big question mark to me right now in terms of his shape. But I just, I feel like, because Morozov has more options left-handed than he does right. Right, he's pretty committed to hooking. He'll only top roll to get to the straps, and then he's hooking again. Left-handed, I think he can pull outside or inside. I'm not sure if left arm he can do anything to Kurdecha with top roll.
SPEAKER_01: I think more like side or inside or something like this because I remember he was trying to top roll Tobias. Do you remember that chance? Yeah. I was at Tobias' corner. Yeah. Oh, yeah. You were there. Yeah. But then he moved to this, you know, sideways, you know, and then.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, let's see. Let's see, Derek. I mean, you are saying that. Continue, Derek. Sorry about it. I just want to...
SPEAKER_03: No, I mean, I agree. It's hard to top roll Alex, especially with his style, too. And Alex being vertical like this, it's going to be really tough. But I do think that Morozov will be able to, he's really good at snapping into that hook. He's really good at starting carved in and shooting up. He's good at getting people into that hook when he wants them to. And I think he might be able to get a hold of Alex. He might have the horsepower to do it. And I think if it does go inside, I think Morozov will be the heavy favorite.
SPEAKER_03: so i i mean alex is my boy though i just something tells me i think morozov will get will want his comeback match like you know after after pulling svetkov and i want to show people what he's all about again so i'm leaning towards morozov but man alex is still a big question mark he could just run through warzone maybe that'll happen i have no idea um but i'm gonna lean towards morozov right now yeah i'm not saying that morozov cannot topple kurdesha but i kind of think it cannot happen in a fresh match
SPEAKER_01: later on more like he couldn't do something to Dave Chaffee but in the I think last round or something he finally top rolled him you know maybe for round four I think he toppled him but yeah and chance
SPEAKER_02: I think Alex Kurdecha is the type of guy that he will not accept a match unless he knows that he is in the best shape possible. I think that's the reason why we haven't seen him in East versus West yet, because he wasn't in his best shape. Being that he accepted a match against Morozov, I believe that we're going to see the best version of him that we've ever seen. That's my opinion.
SPEAKER_02: And Morozov, the last time we saw him, obviously he had been sick. He had only been eating soup when he faced Georgy Svetkov. So it's, you know, I can't base a whole lot off of that. Morozov is extremely strong. He can set a hook amazingly. But like you said, when we saw him against Tobias, when he tried to go outside at all, Tobias cracked his wrist. I'm taking Konecha, and I think it'll be pretty dominant.
SPEAKER_01: Mm hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Cloud fire says devil said he's part of the arm is available to anyone at any time. No. He's after this weekend, he's gonna just put himself to the cave and get ready for the monsters that we will talk about it is the last thing you know today. Okay. My favorite match. One of the
SPEAKER_01: favorite match of all my life, you know, and Prudnik versus Alizhan Muratov.
SPEAKER_03: I'm such a Prudnik fan of his savvy on the table, and I think he's so good at finding a way. He's such a smart arm wrestler, and he's so good at finding a way to make things happen. When he pulled Daddy Kim, I don't know a lot of people that thought Prudnik was going to win that at all. And he found a way to generate that force and to be able to slow him down.
SPEAKER_01: martov is like a whole it's it's a that's a big ask but if there's anybody that can do it it's prudent it's kind of the thing you know you remember you said that he finds a way yeah the question is is there a way yeah true true I mean sometimes the only way is not finding a way but just being either stronger or having better endurance that you know like not because there is a way
SPEAKER_01: I mean, maybe you can consider what I just said as a way as well, but it's not a technical way, you know, it is just like more about the power or endurance, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Go ahead. How do that account and Murtaugh do? They pulled left handed. Oh, I mean, I think you have to say Aljan is the is the favorite. I think on paper he has to be listed as a favorite. I think it is going to be a can do this, you know, underdog story again. Can he be the guy that comes out again? So I guess if I had to put a prediction, I'll go with the safer bet, you know, and say the Aljan wins.
SPEAKER_03: If Alizhan is able to win, it would be, I think, more of a dominant victory, like a 3-0. If Prudnik wins, it'll be like a, you know, third match or something. Or wait, it's best of seven. Is it a world title match? Oh, okay. So, yeah, either way, I think it'll be... Oh, man, that favors Prudnik, I think. He's going to find out. He's going to have a lot of time to figure something out. Alizhan is also... Alizhan in 2017, were you in Hungary, Chance? No, right? You were in 2000? You were? Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: In that event, I had a student who was in the youth category final against Ali Can. They pulled like two minutes, you know, all the starts, fouls, everything, you know. So Ali Can has good endurance as well. His endurance is not bad. And I personally don't see any favorite in this match. If I didn't see with my own eyes, Dadikyan versus Puritnik match, I would say Ali Can is favorite. Right now, Puritnik said that he is even in better shape than
SPEAKER_01: he said this so if he is in better shape than that he can and this is world title match and alijan just like for me it's like off the roof you know just like this level of this match is i mean mind-blowing you know and they both are incredible smarts very unique you know you're talking about alijan 94 kilo weighing in antalya i asked him winning the super heavyweight category of the waft
SPEAKER_01: You know, you cannot do that. You know, you are 210 pounds less than that, 207 pounds and winning super heavyweights. And then following year, you're doing the same thing again, you know. Of course, he had a tough match with Petrenko, but trust me, Petrenko, incredibly strong guy. Trust me, to go to his power lane and beat him, you know, it's very, very hard. You really need to...
SPEAKER_01: unable him take his everything you know but when you go to the powers power the guy is really strong guy and alejan i don't know if you guys remember that match alejan did many things there he started quick he did like this he came he did shoulder pressure he caught him on bicep like alejan is one of the guys that he can explode within the match you know
SPEAKER_01: and while the prudnik i i was 100 sure that he was going to kill him kill him you know yeah and why did you set the match what what you said i listen listen listen you set the match you set the match i will tell you i'm going to tell you something you will understand if you don't understand i will tell you privately sometimes you set the match by hoping that a guy would be at his best shape
SPEAKER_01: And then he says that I'm not at his best shape after the match is set. You understand? And then you said, okay, you're going to get killed while it was in beast. Yeah. Okay. Chance understood as far as I see. Yeah. Okay. And chance. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: um i think that on paper alizan is the favorite he just continues to impress me every single time i see him arm wrestle uh winning waft like you said at less than 210 pounds uh incredible uh his his matches and east versus west always incredible um super fast he can go all over the place
SPEAKER_02: but so can prudnik and i think like everyone else in the planet i thought dada kyan was going to walk through um uh prudnik with ease on the left hand uh east versus west nine that didn't happen somehow prudnik found a stop and being that it's uh best of seven i'm gonna take prudnik i think that he will find a way uh if there's a gap which everyone has a gap i think prudnik's gonna find that gap and uh round three or four is when prudnik's gonna start to take over
SPEAKER_01: and i think we're gonna see uh uh seven rounds but prudnik wow but if anyone who gets a early round uh fast win it would be it would be alijan if if you can i agree yeah yeah yeah so we need we we know that prudnik is to put a break first to get involved you know yeah yeah and his match with with cody was also impressive
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, very impressive. Ali Can, right? Ali Can just, like, being, like, 220. And then he just... Don't get me wrong. When he won the Kazakhstan Rally, he was over 220. In the Antalya, he was below 220. So you are saying that Prudnik is going to win by the endurance factor? Four to three. Four to three. Okay, okay. Yeah. Wow. Anyways, so...
SPEAKER_03: So the last one versus that again. Oh, this is going to be awesome to see. I love watching Todd poll, especially with the inside pollers. Like, it's the best. It's the best.
SPEAKER_03: I think, I mean, someone asked me recently the most impressive arm wrestler last year or whatever. I put Todd Hutchings. I mean, he's still so impressive. He's such an impressive guy. 57 years old and people are scared of you. Come on. That's the fact. That's the fact.
SPEAKER_03: And it's going to be so visually like crazy to see Daddy Count up there and Todd, someone like smaller, I don't know, just looks like a way smaller guy, you know, just hanging in there. And I'm going to go with Todd Hutchings, although Daddy Count is amazing and he's ridiculously strong and explosive and all the things. I just, Todd has proven over time that especially if you're down to pull inside, unless, I mean, the most uncomfortable I've seen him look inside was maybe with Rustam Babaev when they had their super match a long time ago. Just remember, but just remember.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know if you guys closely following, but art has changed things, you know, after the point, instead of like this, he started to build his tornado and he started to do tornado side pressure. And so.
SPEAKER_01: I would like to see, I mean, if it was possible, Rustam and Todd Hutchings after Rustam is totally fine with his chest and everything is fine with both of them. But the guy is not the same guy. They're like, OK, go ahead. Yeah. Oh, yeah. You know, I was just saying the angle for a long time ago kind of was like, oh, I was the only person I really saw dedicate inside and do really well with Todd in a long time. That just came to my memory.
SPEAKER_03: But I don't think that account pulls that way. And like you said, Todd Hutchings has changed now that he's pronating and kind of coming out the back of his wrist a lot more in the straps. So, like I said, I think Todd Hutchings will find a way to get it done. I sound so biased when I'm cheering for Aymeric and I say Aymeric to win. That's very normal. Very normal, you know. And I find this, like, very normal, you know. It is just you want the guy to win, you know.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I cannot do the same thing. I'm an organizer. But you can, you understand? It's normal, you know, yeah. And if that can pull through Todd, like, that'll be wildly impressive. I mean, that'll even set his right arm at another level. But yeah, I think Todd Hutchings takes it. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: I don't think it should be. If Todd wins it, if Dadikyan can't go through him pretty early and Todd gets the first couple wins, then I think it's pretty much over at that point. If he can't do it shockingly quick, first round or two or three, then I think once Todd starts winning, he's going to continue to win the rest of the rounds. I mean, the thing that in Dadikyan's advantage is that to beat, in my personal opinion, if you want to beat
SPEAKER_01: how touching is you need to control his pronator. No matter what you do, you go outside, you take his wrist, you think, wow, I took his wrist. You are just deceiving yourself. Once you miss that pronator, he has it, then you both now have the pronator versus pronator match. We could use it in control. And nobody in that way will beat him with the side pressure. You understand? In an equal position. You take his wrist,
SPEAKER_01: he has the tornado he's gonna beat you because he is first of all like his uh his strategy is based on this you understand this is what he does for like last 20 years and second of all nobody is like genetically as gifted as him about the the strong elbow and
SPEAKER_01: So, but the thing is, when Prudnik beat him, he realized that Prudnik had the full cup, you know, full cup to controlling his pronator, everything. So, Dadikyan is someone who may have the same wrist ability to control there. But is he as technical as Prudnik? I don't know.
SPEAKER_01: Who knows, maybe Katashin is also improved after Prudnik match. Maybe if they would pull today, maybe it would be different, you know, if Prudnik also is healthy. So, but Dadikyan for sure has the risk, but we will see. And Chance, your opinion about this match?
SPEAKER_02: Todd Hutchings continues to impress me. Honestly, going into Ungerbaev and Todd, I thought Ungerbaev was going to 3-0 Todd. I didn't think that Todd had what it takes to beat him. And then he came out in impressive fashion, won over Ungerbaev.
SPEAKER_02: I think that it could potentially go the same way with Dadikyan. But like you said, Prudnik kind of showed everyone how to beat Todd. You just have to control his pronator. You have to get your cup. And I think Dadikyan has the tools potentially to do it more than Angerbaev did. So really, to me, it could go either way. I really hope that Todd...
SPEAKER_02: can pull it off if he's fast enough if he just gets on his pronator and and you know puts his lock and and has that account on the B side he will win um I don't know my gut tells me that daddy John's gonna pull it off though oh you think that again is gonna win I I believe so I hope I'm wrong I hope I'm wrong but I I believe that yeah I mean
SPEAKER_01: For me, the most important part is controlling TASS coronators. And the way that he controlled directly,
SPEAKER_01: Kaino tells me that this guy's hand wrist is very strong. But it may not be enough. You need to be something coordinated behind, you know, the wrist. You may control here. You may lose while you have the wrist, you know. Yeah, I know all about that. That happened when I pulled Todd. I can take Todd's wrist, but if you can't control his pronator, it doesn't matter. Yeah, the guy is very strong, yeah. He's a score loser. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: did you hear that did he what did i say what did he say he said you're a sore loser i wouldn't bring up losing so yeah i'm off a win against a super heavyweight what no no i'm saying that if i was a sore loser i wouldn't bring up a match where i lost
SPEAKER_02: yeah you're right you did listen he's just joking you know right chance yeah yeah i know yeah but listen i understand where derek's coming from if i beat someone like uh 50 years old that no one knew about and i finally got my first big win like i would be excited too so finally let's go derek i'm proud you finally got a win for us
SPEAKER_01: yeah yeah so let's let's talk about the last one that that will devon larat beat can you guys be objective or you're gonna tell me what you wish
SPEAKER_01: of course we have jaguar can i don't have a chance he's persuaded yeah yes of course you you said that you are just like so biased you know patriotic about you know north america team west you know this one no i said people say that whenever i predict americans to win okay derek is always messaging me his predictions and he picks every single westerner he says only team west can win so don't believe anything he says
SPEAKER_02: yeah that's true but except your matches right chance yeah yeah he always picks uh my opponent always yeah no i picked in the last one picked on the last one no you didn't yeah i did i remember i picked on the last one on purpose because you said i never picked you no uh oh oh you mean when i yeah but not at east versus west you picked uh petrenko amen
SPEAKER_03: okay who is winning here who is winning here devin and levon um i think that um okay obviously everybody's talking about this match i thought about it a good amount
SPEAKER_03: You check on Google. Let that chance start. That's true. Okay, I'll check Google right now. Okay, Derek, let's go. I think there's no way Devin, no matter how much he's improved, wins center table against LeBron. I don't think that's an option, right? LeBron will, regardless, will have his way center table. So I think initial rounds, for sure, Devin's hitting that king's move. I think he has to. Obviously, the big things in question are LeBron's wrist, how healed up will it be by that time. Also,
SPEAKER_03: You know, Devin's injury, hopefully that's all good. It looks like it's been good now. But will he have enough outside? Devin keeps saying, if I'm 3% stronger and LeVon's 3% weaker, like, it's a match, right? And so I think we will see the Kings move at the beginning. I just don't think Devin has enough anywhere center table, fresh for fresh, to mess with LeVon. And then it's going to be out there again. Round one of their last match, LeVon's wrist straightened out, at least. I won't say it was cracked all the way back, but that thing straightened out. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: And so I think that that's going to be a lane worth pursuing. Now, later on, Devin might be able to start committing his shoulder and getting deep in there. And people are saying, oh, Devin can't do anything with him on a hook. When Devin gets his shoulder committed, I mean, he did really well with Gennady. Like, he was able to at least stop Gennady's surges when he really had his shoulder committed. I think his elbow is now better than before, you know, after the stem cells. Yeah. And I don't think he was even ready.
SPEAKER_01: for inside against Canada, but still he did very well, yeah. And that is the only way him to get the center. Like, I mean, if he can, if he can, you know, if it is successful. Yeah, I see that in the later rounds. Maybe that later rounds, definitely not in the early rounds. But we'll, and now it's moved to the best of seven, right? Now it's no longer best of five, too, so best of seven favorites. No, no, no, no, no, no. First time they pulled was also the best of seven.
SPEAKER_01: Oh yeah. But then we got hurt that the whole thing after round one, it was a wash, you know, after Devon. Okay. Let me ask you, do you believe that Levan pulled the same direction round one and round two? When Devon get injured, Devon was more like outer side pressure while the first round that you're talking about, he was just like hanging to top row Devon. So, and then like, do you think that,
SPEAKER_01: Devon got injured because of Levan's pressure was too much.
SPEAKER_03: yeah yeah i mean yeah i think that's what led to devin getting injured i think round one he almost got to stop in on the fringe and so round two he was like maybe more active hit the brakes earlier attempt the brakes earlier and then maybe i can actually stop him before the pad and then that's where he ended up getting injured but everything people talk about that match everything after that is the guy was torn like no other round meant anything after that people like oh the hook levon had did what he want with him but yeah when your arm's torn like all pressures are kind of
SPEAKER_03: affected by that um now that being said levon is uh trained really hard his videos are looking wild he's looking super strong um i it's it's a crazy match to think of again um you know it had devon not gotten hurt what that match would have looked like i know devon felt something in lavon's wrist round one he's screaming you know i got you now i cracked that wrist you know so um
SPEAKER_03: I'm not sure. I think obviously the safe bet, I think people have to list the favorite as LeVon due to how dominant he's always been and how well he's always pulled. You know, Ermey's showing that gap, that potential stopping point. I don't think, can you imagine Devin, I can't even see Devin doing that, wrist up and committing his elbow like that. So I don't think that's in his playbook right now.
SPEAKER_01: So I'm still going to favor Lavon. In my opinion, Hermes' arm strength is probably more than Devon's. Yeah, I agree with that. But not here, not yet. Here, Rene, this riser and everything, whenever they both go outside, so Devon's wrist survived. Yeah, it's all going to depend on Lavon's cup. I think it all is going to come down to Lavon's wrist.
SPEAKER_03: really in the end like will Devin crack it and start opening him up over rounds or is it stronger than we all thought and LeBron's explosive enough to uh finish Devin throughout the early rounds um but yeah I think I mean I'm gonna go with the safe bet on this one if we're doing predictions and the safer bet I think even Devin would admit you know on paper he'd be the underdog the safe bet would be live on and we'll see if they pull full six rounds which they don't have is best of seven um
SPEAKER_01: do you think that there are like you said the level is gonna win it means that you believe that that one is gonna win four rounds yeah so but do you think that later rounds uh that one can win oh yeah yeah if they actually pull all yeah yeah I think devil could end up cracking live on
SPEAKER_01: So you are saying that Levan can win enough to win this whole thing, you know, but not the full six rounds you are saying? No, I don't. Yeah, if they pull all six, I'd be shocked. If Devin's not injured, if Devin can't get a win on Levan. Uh-huh. Okay. And Chance?
SPEAKER_02: i am definitely in the minority of people that believe that if devin's bicep held up uh when they first pulled that that match could have potentially gone different um i going into the the first time they pulled i didn't think that devin would be able to get the stop until maybe round four um
SPEAKER_02: That being said, round one, Lavon's wrist got flattened. There was a small stop, and I was really excited for the following rounds. And unfortunately, when his bicep blew, you know, obviously, like Derek said, everything after that didn't matter. I think going into this with Devin doing all the preparation that he's been doing, having the stem cells, if Devin's bicep holds up,
SPEAKER_02: i think it's less about less about lavon's wrist and more about devin's bicep if devin's bicep holds up i think he's gonna get the stop um i think he's gonna get the stop kind of early on maybe around two or three um and i i truly believe that he can come through and win um especially with lavon having a wrist injury i understand that he's gonna have like six months or or longer of recovery on the injury so it should be fine by then but
SPEAKER_02: Typically, if you've had an injury in an area in the past, that tends to flare up again and again. So I, you know, yes, LeVon is a safer bet. I would agree 100%. I'm going to take Devin like four to three, maybe even four to two.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, I understand. It has been, it will be like 11 months from his injury to the match. Yeah. And I don't know, his teammates who are training with him, they say that he's now gonna be even stronger than before. Yeah. I asked you, I think Vala, I think I asked. And Vala said that he's already beaten all of them.
SPEAKER_01: really and all of them already and he still has three months three more months uh three and a half months almost yeah we'll see we'll see how it will be but i i think that i i kind of still think that when you say like if his bicep hold on like do you mean if he doesn't get injured or if he's strong enough to stop him i i mean if it if it doesn't get injured if it doesn't do you like do you ever think that he got injured because
SPEAKER_01: the because of the pressure not because of like unlock or something you know no no i think it was absolutely the pressure but so you are saying that his bicep needs to get stronger to stop him yeah it needs to get stronger and the attachment needs to get stronger as well yeah i understand yeah that that is like i i realized that most of the bicep injuries
SPEAKER_01: in my opinion is happening not when there is a pressure is coming and opening your arm when there is a pressure which is more than your bicep handles and then at the same time you force yourself back you understand like instead of waiting there you it's opening and you pull yourself back so one pressure coming from here
SPEAKER_01: One pressure coming from here because, and then the bicycle goes up, you know, it goes. So as Derek said, that round one, if you realize that in round two, he went this way while he was moving this way with his shoulder. And the same time Levan hit, this was like the same thing, you know, that happened. I think Levan did that so that whenever his shoulder was here, he stopped him like one centimeter.
SPEAKER_01: So he thought that maybe if he goes that way, so he will be stopping like even higher. But again, I still believe that Levan round one, Levan round two, he didn't put the pressure to the same point. One was just to take his wrist round one. This is what I believe. And then the round two was his more like, more like, you know, more like to the sideways, still with pronators, but more like a pressure to the sideways.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, yeah. Can I ask you, what do you think about Devin's shape? So what's his weight compared to that match towards what he's going to come in at? Do you know the difference? I don't know his plans. I don't know his plans, but all I know that, like, whenever he was, like, 260 and on against Hermes, and people say, oh, he's too small to say that. Listen, the guy is only losing pats.
SPEAKER_01: And whenever, whenever I had this stem cell therapy, the first thing happened to me, I start to lose weight and my muscles were just staying the same, you know, no muscle, weight is going down and I check it. And then I saw stem cell is making your metabolism
SPEAKER_01: was uh IV IV this is systematic you know yes and the other one others were just for the into the muscle for the injured area so and I think because he had so many stem cells I think the only reason that he's losing the weight he's just like like whenever you get older you have like inner fat as well you know and everything I think he is losing those I didn't I don't think he lost any
SPEAKER_01: any muscle anything and people said oh look at his arm you know you're gonna lose you need to be this many kilo that many kilo and every match is proven that it has nothing to do with that you know
SPEAKER_01: i think yeah his power is the same if not more and i don't know the guy is very strong anyone is judging him by his size or the weight of his body they are mistaken i think that he will still be like 270 or something but trust me like like he doesn't really need to be 300 pounds or something you know i kind of think that you know
SPEAKER_01: like he needs to be strong enough to put some break but he must not lose his endurance either yeah right yeah let's see let's see how it will be um thank you very much derek thank you very much chance i mean it is great to talk about arm wrestling with you guys and there is sorry one just super chat game and i need to um i need to i don't know why on computer i can't
SPEAKER_01: see the full name of the super chat guy let me see okay db talks thank you for your super chat he says devon beat georgie on smaller paths than east versus west making his win more impressive does this mean his chances against levan will be greater
SPEAKER_01: since he will have more room to drag back. Yes and no. I don't know because I mean he has one something here and Levan has one something forward but since Levan is also outside puller mainly so I maybe he may be right you know that you know because this is Devon that wants to stretch Levan more you know. Yeah. So what do you guys think? Does it matter?
SPEAKER_02: i don't really think it matters too much because both both guys have the same advantage and disadvantage uh they're both going to be dragging back uh if lavon wants to try to chase it forward he has that the extra centimeter to go forward so i don't think that the pad should play too much of a factor although there's one point i did bring up when uh when
SPEAKER_03: Gennady pulled Devin. I'm assuming Gennady and Livon talk at least sometimes. Gennady's style of pressing Devin took away Devin's Kings move. It X'd it out, right? Because Devin was going to go off the back of the pad every time if he continued to try to Kings move Gennady, because Gennady was pressing towards Devin rather than towards the pin pad more, right?
SPEAKER_03: so uh in between not towards well yeah yeah i don't mean like directly but you know more towards it than sideways yeah so um that took away the king's move essentially so devin had to fight him center table and really start committing that shoulder to really be able to be in the match now if that with the extra pad room
SPEAKER_03: That might affect that if Levon. So Levon has me in having a plan B. If my wrist does fail, if it is not ready, plan B, right? It's probably going to be a press. Imagine, right, to come forward with that big shoulder. And so if he ends up pressing like Gennady did, that extra pad room could actually help Devin a lot, right? He won't be going off the back of the pad nearly as easily. So in that scenario, I could see the pad room helping Devin. But if Levon, like he normally does, they both go back. Yeah, but the pad must not take him, you know?
SPEAKER_01: when many people get out of the same size on August 2022 oh okay I thought they were saying you guys made them bigger no no no and also I don't think that anyone has that kind of ability as uh about this one this right but again you know whenever whenever you are far when you like open on top row you are kind of vulnerable to
SPEAKER_01: anything to this way because it is very hard to keep your arm like this when you are that stretch you know you need to be like this so that you can block with your shoulder and chest because everything is connected when you are then apart so that's why whenever he went outside in general he was able to you know make him outside of the path anyways guys once again thank you it was big pleasure
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, thank you for having me. Because I respect you guys and I like you guys as friends. And I know that you guys are arm wrestling fans, even though Derek can answer only like 13 out of 14 matches. I only miss like two or three. I'm just joking. Anyway, so it is always a big pleasure to talk with people.
SPEAKER_01: who are knowledgeable and can very well express their opinions and you guys are the same this way and thank you very much thank you very much and thank you yeah yeah keep in touch guys thank you
