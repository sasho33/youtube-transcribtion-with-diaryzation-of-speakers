SPEAKER_01: Hi, Artyom. Hi. Hi. My name is Pasha. Nice to meet you. I'll try to translate. That's it. So, how does he say to switch the camera? I can't understand anything. Just turn the phone over. Are you sitting on the phone? Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Turn the phone to the side. Something doesn't work with the laptop. Yeah, put it like that. You have to turn the image over. Or higher.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I see that, yeah. How are you doing?
SPEAKER_02: How do you feel? Who, me? Yes. As usual, you know, the preparation of the East versus West, a little bit, a little bit exhausted. Yeah, it's okay. What to do? No, he's perfect now.
SPEAKER_03: Is Zurab coming? Yeah. Okay. Is Zurab speak English? Roman will come. Okay.
SPEAKER_02: yeah yeah i'm writing also so how is congratulations artem congratulations good job at the amc very good thank you thank you yeah yeah
SPEAKER_02: And so you are ready? Yes. Yes. Yeah. I'm here. Hello. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think he's, he's, he will join like a few minutes later. Uh,
SPEAKER_02: You know, he's training to beat Artem. Good luck. Good luck. Okay. Okay. And Artem, how is your form? Your form is better than last time when we saw you against Sasha?
SPEAKER_03: He says, how's your form? Better than last time when we saw you against Sasha? Yes, I think I managed to score this month. I don't know how I managed, but I scored quite well. I think it's even better now than it was with Sasha. Okay. Yeah, he's saying, yeah, somehow I gained for this past month very well, and he believes that he's much better than he was with Sasha. Oh, he's even better now? Wow.
SPEAKER_02: Wow, that's great. So is he confident about this match? Does he think it's going to be easier or harder for him? Well, considering that I won with my right hand, with my weak right hand, I think I'll win with my left hand too.
SPEAKER_03: yeah artem says that uh uh well if to take the consideration that i want the right hand with him my weak hand so left hand i will win too okay um uh and you're up in david david they told me that
SPEAKER_02: when they go to when they went to the amc event uh they said that they it took like them to two days you know at the border they made them wait and then hello hello they made them wait and and then they couldn't sleep and they arrived and pull you know and that is how he also got injured
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, and does he think that, you know, like, it may be because of that? Does Artem think that Zurab actually may be stronger than that?
SPEAKER_03: Oh.
SPEAKER_01: Did he say anything? Look, I think that, of course, such a heavy road affects the athlete's well-being in any case.
SPEAKER_01: A small percentage of it probably stopped because of the border, not sleeping, not eating properly, of course, it affects. Therefore, some percentage of strength, 100% went away, but how much, I can't say. I won, in principle, not to say that easily, but confidently, that is, controlling the course of the fight. Therefore, I will not say with a large margin, but relatively normal.
SPEAKER_01: I can't say how it affected the trip. Maybe it did, because sleep and nutrition are the most important things for an athlete.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, Artem saying that, yeah, absolutely. I understand that travel always impacts athletes and probably has some impact on Zurab at that match. He said it was not an easy match, but very confident from my side. So he said, yeah, we'll see, you know, probably a percentage of, we'll see. Yeah, Roman, I asked Artem if he feels confident
SPEAKER_00: against Zurab and he said that I beat Zurab even with my weak arm which is right arm just like imagine what I will do to him with my strong arm just let me let me little bit you know steal the pot you know
SPEAKER_00: He wants to make sure that Taino's stronger arm is left one. So that it will be even notorious to beat him on his strongest arm. Yeah, Paolo. Yes, he says that he wants to be sure that you are in good shape with your strong arm when I win. Well, I will be in better shape.
SPEAKER_04: yeah he said that he will be in best form yes in best shape yeah and yeah anything you want to say zura maximum
SPEAKER_00: So first of all, he appreciates and respects the motivation, how motivated Artyom is. And he said that
SPEAKER_00: Maybe like first two rounds at most that there will be some type of war, but after the second round his, Artyom's arm will just by itself will open up. Starting. He says that he appreciates your preparation and that you take this match seriously.
SPEAKER_01: He says, well, the first two rounds, there will probably be some kind of war with you, but then your hand will open on its own. Well, I'll tell you a little secret, that as soon as the first two rounds are over, all the fights will end. But I work on my endurance, and I've already added very well. And given the fact that he gained a lot of weight, large muscles tend to get clogged faster. And I'm a slim guy.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, Artem saying that how those two first rounds will start, the whole match will go. And he said, yeah, I understand what he's saying, but I've been working on my endurance very well and he gained a lot. And he said, I can see Zurab that he has huge muscles and he will get pumped up faster. And I'm still skinny and slim. May I translate? Zurab, do you understand what I'm saying?
SPEAKER_02: I understand. He understood something. We don't have to lose time if you understand. Yeah, that's okay. Yeah. Anyway, so, you know, it's going to be best of seven. Like you need to win four rounds. It's a world title match. And so these rounds to be like normally you had to win three rounds. Now you need to win four rounds. Who is going to help this? Is it going to help to Taino?
SPEAKER_03: 4-0, I will make it as usual and then it doesn't matter.
SPEAKER_02: okay and um he's saying that very interesting dream he's dreaming about right now it's very interesting dream okay we'll see uh who have uh the
SPEAKER_02: who have which dream and which dream will come true. Can you ask Zurab? I have been inviting people to this podcast and some of them think that the injury of Zurab will affect him and he won't be able to carry himself to the table.
SPEAKER_02: mentally you know and like is this the case or just because he got injured now he is just much more hungry and like he just can't wait to uh go to the stage and fight you know how how does he feel
SPEAKER_00: Yes, this is a very analogous question. You said that you have a very strong desire to win. How do you deal with your emotions? How do you deal with the desire to win? You said that you have a very strong desire to win. What is your motivation for winning? You said that you have a very strong motivation.
SPEAKER_04: After that, when I realized that I didn't need that kind of motivation, I was convinced that I was a big sportsman with big injuries. I was convinced that I was a big sportsman. Then I realized that I didn't need that kind of motivation. I was convinced that I was a big sportsman.
SPEAKER_00: So he said that this is a huge sport. This very second when he got injured, from that second, from that moment, he got motivated even more to come back stronger. So for sure, this injury will not let him to not compete at his 100%. Moreover, he will be even more motivated to come and prove himself. And he said that as the sport, this is a huge sport and such a motivation is very important to...
SPEAKER_00: go and chase your career goals so he will be motivated when he enters okay so basically he's saying that he's gonna go and get the belt from uh artem um
SPEAKER_04: He is a very good person, but now he is going to leave and he is going to live in Sabzola. And this room will be mine. I don't want to leave. I don't want to leave. Artemis' room will be mine.
SPEAKER_00: he's saying that uh um huge respect as a person to uh athlete to athlete he said that arthur knows we both know we respect huge um each other but it's time to put this respect slightly aside and fight on the table and he says that in my mind there is no other option than
SPEAKER_00: that belt artem's belt right now to become mine so okay so basically he's saying that you know artem please take care of my belt don't put any scratch on it you know until you give to me yes ask him ask him
SPEAKER_00: Keep it clean and shiny, don't scratch it, because that belt will stay with Zurab for a long time, so it has to be clean and all shiny. Now, Paolo, your turn. Give me a couple of seconds, because my memory is about to be aged.
SPEAKER_03: You can do it, Pavel.
SPEAKER_03: Zorab said, no, it will absolutely not interfere. At that moment, when I was injured, the motivation immediately increased in order to come back even better, even stronger. Therefore, I have to prove to myself that I can do it. This is very important and I am very motivated.
SPEAKER_03: Then Engin asked, so what, will you take Artyom's belt? He says, listen, we respect each other very much, but when we come to the table, we will put a little respect aside and seriously fight. He says, and yes, I will win and the belt will be mine. Engin says, that is, you want to say that Artyom took your belt and carefully didn't scratch it there. Zurab says, yes, yes, wipe the dust off it, keep it shiny, don't scratch it, please.
SPEAKER_01: Well, first of all, I want to say, well done, respect to him, that he motivated so much and didn't give up.
SPEAKER_01: continues to train and wants to show a high level, that is, as it were, of course, now he has one hand, that is, of course, it motivates him strongly, but my motivation is not worse, he lies here not far from me here now I can bring to show he is clean without dust because I know that he will remain with me for a long time, at least two more defenses and he will remain with me forever, so don't worry, he's clean, he's shiny, there's no dust on him, but unfortunately he won't go to you
SPEAKER_03: says yeah huge respect and uh I respect that you're motivated and I understand that you have one arm as of right now but uh huge respect that you want to prove and uh compete at the highest level and he said don't worry about the belt he's sitting not too far from me he's absolutely dustless and shiny because it's my belt and I have to prove it twice and this belt will be mine forever
SPEAKER_02: okay okay that's good that's good that's good i like that i like that both athletes are motivated time to time you can go and do one more set you know it's no problem
SPEAKER_02: yeah yeah i don't want you to i don't want you to just stop yeah just go to one set come back go once yeah look how happy he is he's smiling like yeah yeah yeah i want to i want to um talk about the cards because paulo in
SPEAKER_02: Zurab, Zurab is training and Pavlo needs to leave in one hour, so let's talk about the other methods. Taino, what do you think? That dumbbell looks big. What?
SPEAKER_03: i can't believe he's already training with such big dumbbell with right arm
SPEAKER_04: yeah be careful you'll be careful my friend you'll be careful please that's nice that's a serious progress yeah yeah i'm happy here um
SPEAKER_04: and after that, you will be able to do the Uke. So, in the future, Uke's sparring will be mine and it will be very important for me. As soon as it happens, I will be able to do the Uke.
SPEAKER_00: So he's saying that basically he started slowly to also do sparring sessions, but like very light level on his right arm. But he tries his best to restrain himself to do more. You know, he just tries to go slow, slow. And he feels that he feels very confident that his right arm is healing really good. And it may be even better when he comes back. I hope so. I hope so. Did you tell him that, you know, what? Yeah, I will tell him. Zula, Zula, get me a chair.
SPEAKER_00: If you weigh 50 kilos and weigh this much, it's a lot of weight. I don't know what to think. It's my opinion, but I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. Yes, I mean, you weigh 10 kilos and 10-11 kilos, but it's a lot of weight.
SPEAKER_00: so he said okay uh sorry uh i don't uh i can also curl 100 kg but i'm very lazy to set up that huge dumbbell so we're just gonna stick with the heaviest in the gym and let's talk a little bit about uh the matches maybe you translate what the last part here
SPEAKER_01: Well, I'm actually not a big weight fan. I don't even look at the results, because I do quality exercises, I do the technique that will be useful, and not just to make a big weight to make a picture. And in the end, I overplayed so many of them. They lift almost twice as much, but it's not worth it. So this is not an indicator. Well, yes, everyone has different techniques.
SPEAKER_03: yeah artyom says that yeah he he agrees that this is just the jokes uh he said that he's working with the lighter weights and he won a lot with the guys who working with the huge dumbbells he said you know it's different techniques and uh i'm using mine and i'm doing i'm doing my exercises in the perfect technique yeah yeah yeah okay let's let's talk uh about we have 40 minutes uh
SPEAKER_03: Artem, Valya Hichkiti vs. Nurdalet Aydar Khan. Artem, who will win? Do you know this guy? What matches exactly? One more time, Engin, I'm sorry. Valya Hichkiti.
SPEAKER_02: One second. Artyom, look at the screen. Yes, I'm looking. Valya is AMC second place with Sarmat.
SPEAKER_03: Well, Vala. Ishkiti. Ishkiti will win. Ishkiti will win? He's saying that Ishkiti will win. Ishkiti will win? He's very good. He's very fast. Yeah. And Zulab? Zulab, you have a mic, right? Vala ZDA, Nurdalec. I have a mic. I have a mic.
SPEAKER_04: I think it's important to think about it. I think it's important to think about it. I think it's important to think about it. I think it's important to think about it. I think it's important to think about it. I think it's important to think about it.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, he's saying that Vala will win, but not because he is Georgian and is biased. No, he just goes by the logic. He said that Vala is more used to of this weight of 85 kg than Nudalet. So he will be more comfortable at this weight category against Aydar Khan and Vala will win.
SPEAKER_03: OK. And... And David Samusha, Vladimir Mairo. You know what Mairo? Samusha. David Samusha.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, because he hasn't played for a long time and he doesn't know what form he's in. David Samusha regularly shows good form, so I think it's unconditional. He won't even give the Major a chance to win, so David Samusha is a pure victory.
SPEAKER_03: said david samusha for sure gonna win there is pretty much no chances for mayoral because mayoral has a big break and long time did not you know participate in anything big and he said yeah there is a clean uh for him it's a clean that uh david samusha will win just samusha no comment no extra comment needed
SPEAKER_02: Okay, I think it will not be easy match. I would bet all of you. I don't know if Samusha wins or not, but it will not be easy match. Zurab, you think it's gonna be easy match? Roman, I expect you to translate. He understood.
SPEAKER_04: There is no doubt that in the 5th round or 6th round, Samushia will be the winner. Because I know that he will be the winner in the next round. Because Samushia is the winner. Samushia is easy.
SPEAKER_00: He said that the supermatch style, when he has to pull multiple rounds, plays in Samusha's favor because he knows Samusha's arm, how endurable it is. And considering how much endurance Samusha will have during the matches, he's saying that every other round is basically better. Okay, yeah. Later rounds, yes. But the earlier round, I think it will be a better long match. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah. Yeah. Do you, Artem, do you know, or Zurab, do you know Robby Toppy from USA? And you, Zurab?
SPEAKER_00: Do you know Roby Topi? Yes, I know him. Do you know Roby Topi? Yes, I know him. When I was in Canada, he was a social worker.
SPEAKER_00: He knows Roby. When he visited Canada, they got friends there on social media, so he knows him. And now I will ask about the match. Oh, Roby was in Canada? No, when Zurab was in Canada, they... No, no, but Roby was in Canada when Zurab went. Zurab, was Roby in Canada when... I think he was in Canada when... I think he was in Canada when...
SPEAKER_00: No, no, they didn't meet in person. It was just on social media they got... Okay, he's going to pull Eimerick Preddinson. And I want to know if they have any prediction about this match. From France, France, left arm. Yes, yes, I know, I know.
SPEAKER_04: This is right arm, left arm. Yeah, Aymeric will win on left arm because Aymeric's left is stronger. Okay, Taino, who is winning here?
SPEAKER_01: Well, everything is clear and clear here, there is even nothing to discuss. Zura, thank you, thank you, Zura. Here, here, you see, Zura, you see what I have, I will keep it. Yes, yes, I'm sure, I'm sure, Artem, that you won't be able to do this.
SPEAKER_00: He said that now he respects Artung even like double, twice as much because of how great gift he's gonna deliver when they meet. Say again? Now he respects Taino twice as much because considering how great gift he's about to deliver when they meet each other. Oh, okay, okay. He says, now I respect you even more, taking into account what a good gift you prepared for me.
SPEAKER_04: Well, I don't give gifts, I take them. Okay, I would like to know, Zurab, who is winning here? I think that all of them are the favorites. I think that Alto, Shevkhty, Mimas,
SPEAKER_04: It's in a very good shape. I think it's going to be great, but if you look at it from a subjective and objective point of view, I think it's going to be a favorite for the community.
SPEAKER_00: He wants really, he supports and wants Avtandil to win, but objectively speaking, 60% he would think that Oleg is favorite in this match. So Oleg is going to beat Avtandil 60% here. Yeah, but he wishes vice versa. Artem, do you know Avtandil Chudberidze? You know, Oleg Zhokh and Chudberidze.
SPEAKER_01: I know, I know, but I still think that Dzhokh will win here due to his anatomical hand structure, but he is actually very strong. Therefore, I think Dzhokh's victory is certain, most likely.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, Artyom thinking that because of anatomical specialty of Zhokh, plus Zhokh is really strong, that Zhokh is favorite. Zhokh is favorite, okay. And Zulab, Daniel Prokopchuk, Mindaugas Sarasaitis. Prokopchuk. And Tainov.
SPEAKER_01: Prokopchuk, because he is phenomenally strong, resilient, can fight for hours, I think, without losing strength at the same time. So, of course, Prokopchuk wins. He said that Prokopchuk for sure, because he has phenomenal strength and endurance, and he can pull for hours, and yeah, he's Prokopchuk. Okay. And Marcio Barbosa versus Oleg Petrenko. Zura. Petrenko.
SPEAKER_04: I really like Marcio's style and I really like him as a sportsman, I really like him as a player. I don't know if he's in his best form, but I think Petrenko is in his best form, because he's a new guy, he's a player, and he's motivated to be a player.
SPEAKER_00: He likes really much Barbosa's style, how stylistic armwrestler he is. However, he would pick in this case favorite like winner Olek because of first reason is that Zurab is not sure how in
SPEAKER_00: more in Barbosa's prime shape Barbosa will be there how much he will be 100% there if you if he gets his good shape like he used to be he would pick Barbosa but now he thinks that that's not the case and Oleg is very young and he gets he trains he's motivated and he gets better and better as the time goes on so he picks at this moment Oleg is favorite and he's gonna take the match
SPEAKER_01: And you, Artyom? Which hand? The right one. The right one? Yes, I agree that he's young, that he's ready to win, about Oleg Petrenko. But most likely, I'm not going to say 50-50, because Marc Barboza is also a strong guy, and you can't count him yet. He'll show a good fight, so I'll say 50-50.
SPEAKER_03: he said 50 50. he said yeah i agree that petrenko is very prospective and young but he said that barbosa you cannot you know sign him off the list because he's still very good so he will say like 50 50. okay and ivan matushenko reno message
SPEAKER_04: They both said Matyushenko, yeah. They both said Matyushenko. And, and, and, what is, okay, say it, Zoran. To be honest, Matyushenko is a very good player. He has a lot of experience. He has a lot of experience. He has a lot of experience. He has a lot of experience.
SPEAKER_04: I don't know what else to say, but I think Supermzimezone is one of my favorites. In Marjohena. In Marjohena or in Martschena? It's not in Marjohena, it's in Martschena.
SPEAKER_00: ah he said that uh on on right arm uh matushenko is actually in the level of super heavy weights people are underestimating how strong he is but he says that also on lefty he is really really good and uh he just underlined the fact that uh matushenko can take on different like higher weight class category guys top guys he said
SPEAKER_03: So, yeah, he's a favorite. And what's your opinion, Paolo? Yeah, I agree with Zurab and Artyom Matyushenko. He's on a little different level.
SPEAKER_03: and then marcio i'm sure uh earlier podcast yes uh i have my opinion on this one marcio lately for my super match marcio again uh good form i i don't think he's in his best form but he's in good form and if he continues
SPEAKER_03: to work out and improving he will be in a very good shape but i still think if petrenko will bring 2019 zloty tour form petrenko will win okay and john bersing versus krasimir costadino 105 kilo who is uh who are you asking
SPEAKER_04: It's all from the period. Johnny is not in the form and Krasimir is not. But I think Krasimir will be in the form of Johnny in March. And he will be in the form of Johnny in March. And he will be in the form of Johnny in March. And he will be in the form of Johnny in March. And he will be in the form of Johnny in March.
SPEAKER_00: Currently, they both are not at their best shapes, but judging by their history all the time, like major times, Krasimir was capable to force hook and getting his favorite spot, like position during the match. But right now, since they are both not at their best level, he's unsure, so he's saying 50-50 at this point. And Artem?
SPEAKER_01: It's going to be an interesting fight. I think John recovered after the fight with Osho. Kostadinov is going to gain some weight. I think it's going to be an interesting fight. But I prefer Brezenko. He's more experienced. I'm not saying Kostadinov is inexperienced. He fights a lot and has a lot of experience. But I think John Brezenko will beat him up and win.
SPEAKER_03: I'm saying that
SPEAKER_03: john is uh john's experience is uh the greatest experience in uh basically the sport he said not that i'm saying that costadinov is not experienced he's pulling a lot but he still thinks that uh john will recover uh from his uh weight losing for sasha by that time and uh costadinov maybe will gain a little bit weight so at 105 kg it's going to be a great match but he still thinks that john brzing will be able to beat uh costadinov's wrist and uh topple him
SPEAKER_04: Enzrap, Iraq's Zirakashvili Pauline. Iraq. 50-50. I didn't go to Iraq on March 22nd, because I wanted to make progress. Zirakashvili knows
SPEAKER_04: He was very strong, but he didn't have the strength to fight. And I think he was able to do that. That was in the 80s and 90s.
SPEAKER_00: so right now he's saying 50 50 because paul lean is gain has gained like armor thing wise very much and he's becoming better and better and also iraqli since he dropped the weight zurab thinks that iraqli is gonna do better at uh even higher uh like the weight class he was before so this category change will be maybe playing some role that uh
SPEAKER_02: gonna be in disadvantage of iraqi so he's saying 50 50 otherwise he would pick iraq i don't know how disadvantage the the waist that he is lifting oh i know it's not like everything in arm wrestling but it just shows that he's like physically he's very strong did you see that the uh curl on the scott bench to him 150 kilo how low yes yeah i mean it's impressive like i mean while watching my neck hurts you know my back hurts already
SPEAKER_02: And how do you see this match, Artem? Well, I understand. He already said, right? He already said John is winning, right? Yeah, yeah. And let's go. Matt Mask versus Wagner Bortolato. Sorry, Engin. It was about Pauline versus Irakli. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. He didn't, yeah. Sorry. Yes, I saw Pauline versus Sasha's fight. It was very interesting.
SPEAKER_01: And Zarikashvili has been showing good form lately. If he manages to impose his own fight and load Paulin's wrist, I think he will be able to do it. Therefore, I will not say that Zarikashvili will win here,
SPEAKER_01: I'm more inclined to the victory of Zarekishevili, but it will be a very interesting, I think, long fight. And in fact, who will impose his struggle, will win. But I still think that Zarekishevili will be able to impose it on him and win. But we'll see. Here I can doubt.
SPEAKER_03: john saying that this is a very very interesting uh match and he said that uh pauline uh gaining as an arm wrestler a lot showing stable good results but he's saying that probably iraqli will
SPEAKER_03: will make you know uh the pulling he cited and he can uh he can push pauline to his you know style uh and he must not most likely but probably gonna win but he's saying it's you know it's very interesting because if pauline will be able to uh pull in his style that giving pauline better chances but he still thinks a little bit towards yeah
SPEAKER_02: I mean, personally, I won't be surprised if Paul wins. I won't be surprised if Irakli wins. I can imagine both sides being capable of winning that match, but we will see. I really hope that people realize how high level match these are. Matt Mask versus Wagner Bortolato.
SPEAKER_02: Is it left or right? Right. What's that? Matt Mask. Matt Mask will win? Yes. Okay. And Artem?
SPEAKER_01: I don't think that he's confident that Bartolato will win because he doesn't like the overall physical form of Matt Mask as of right now. And he's sure that Bartolato will win.
SPEAKER_01: Artyom, do you think he will win a flat press like this with a brush? With a brush, yes. I think Bortolato is physically stronger, but technically I won't say. They both suffer from the technique. But I think Matt Musk won't show anything. Most likely Bortolato will twist him, I think. He won't even be able to hit him with a brush.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, yeah. Artem thinks that Bartolato will probably even be able to put him inside. He said, I don't believe that Matt Mask with his physical form will be even able to take his wrist. Do you agree with that, Paul?
SPEAKER_00: I think it's a great idea, Roman, to have a new top-roller in the hook. I think it's a great idea. Artyom is right. If he spins the club, he'll always beat the top-roller. That's clear.
SPEAKER_03: uh no i i i don't know it's uh it's an interesting match of different styles but uh i believe that matt mask will win not three zero but uh or whatever but it's gonna be some break uh bartolato may win first or second or even second but long term uh yeah matt mask will will drain him physically
SPEAKER_03: Because Bartolato is much stronger, yes, I agree. But Matt Mask have his endurance, have his point, have his top roll. And, yeah, it will be interesting, Mitch. Be careful with your equipment. What's that? Be careful with your equipment. Bolt it down. Oh, yeah, the table, table, yeah. Yeah, I need to be careful, yeah. And Morozov versus Kurdecha. Morozov, 100%. How? Top roll, hook, how?
SPEAKER_01: He said that he is capable of both. Oh, he can toproll and hook Kurdecha. Okay. And how do you see that, Artem? Well, you can't say for sure, because Kurdecha won Gasparini, well, for a long time, but he won, he won many athletes, and it is not known what form he will bring to the tournament.
SPEAKER_01: Of course, I support Artyom Morozov, but I don't think it will be easy for him. Although Morozov is versatile, he can fight both in the hook and in the top. I support Morozov, but I doubt to make any predictions, because it is not known in what form he will come to spin.
SPEAKER_03: Artyom saying that he's cheering for sure for Morozov, but he said it's not going to be easy for him for sure because Kurdeche has some wins over very named, you know, athletes. And he said it's not going to be easy. It really depends on what form and what shape Kurdeche is right now. Not an easy match. I understand. And
SPEAKER_02: Evgeny Prudnik vs. Alijan Murado. Good match, huh? Good luck. You can see from the impression. Yeah, like, you know, 50-50. Very interesting match, actually, I want to say. I think this match will be won by...
SPEAKER_01: I don't know who will win. Two very strong athletes. It's hard to guess here that Olezhan Muratov is strong, that Evgeny Prudnik is here. They are both strong. Prudnik is probably a little more universal, although Olezhan Muratov fights both top and hook. I can't say the forecast for this fight, but I want to see it.
SPEAKER_03: Artyom says that he wants to see it for sure. This is unpredictable. Both athletes are very good. And he said that probably Evgeny Purnik is a little more universal. But Alizhan Muratov can pull anywhere too. So he wants to see it. It's unpredictable. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Incredible match, yeah. I don't know how it will be. I see Alizhan starting fast. But I can't even see Purnik stop him. And they can pull forever.
SPEAKER_02: i don't know how it will be i will be very surprised if one dominates the other one but if one dominates the other one adrian has chance to dominate but because of explosiveness but if someone stops that it will be worth my my so i see like 50 50. and user up
SPEAKER_04: Alizhan's fight was the most important and I didn't want to lose that fight because I wanted to fight him and I wanted to fight him. In the first round, I was sure that Alizhan was going to win that fight and that he was going to beat me. But this happened in the 7th round, in the 6th round.
SPEAKER_00: so first of all he wanted to make a point as a statement that he wishes wishes alijan to continue winning winning streak so that once time comes he himself zurab will beat alijan this is why why not
SPEAKER_04: Why did you choose Prudnik? Why did you choose Prudnik? I chose Prudnik because I thought that if I were to go to war, I would not have to go to war.
SPEAKER_04: I used to weigh myself and weigh myself at 15 kilos. Now I weigh myself at 17 kilos and I weigh myself at 17 kilos and I weigh myself at 17 kilos. And that's a good thing. I don't have a problem with that.
SPEAKER_00: Well, actually, he said that, obviously, mad respect to his current opponent. He thinks that if he is capable of beating dominant fashion, Artyom, he would ask you, Engin, to actually set up the match, either of those two. You say Purnik will also be a great opponent for him. Okay, if he dominates, okay. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Can you translate that power and ask him if there is a chance Zurab to dominate him? Not win, but dominate him.
SPEAKER_03: Yes, Zurab says, with all due respect to my opponent in the future, if I manage to be so dominant that I win dominantly, I will ask Engin not to make a supermatch with one of these opponents, that is, with Prudnik or with Olezhan. How do you think, hypothetically, is it possible that, let's say, Zurab will win dominantly?
SPEAKER_01: It's just a wish, brother, respect. I got it. In theory, you can imagine anything you want, in fact. In practice, there will be domination on my part, most likely. In general, yes, in fact, an interesting fight would have been with someone from them, with me, with them, on the left hand, on any, with them, with Murat, with Rudnik, ready to fight on the left hand, but a little later.
SPEAKER_03: Artyom says, yeah, we can imagine anything we want, but domination will be from my side this time. And he said, it's going to be an interesting match with any of those sportsmen from my side. So Artyom said, I'm ready to pull left-handed with any of those. Yeah. Yeah. A little bit later, he said. And the last match, Tata Chin versus David Dadikian. Zorab.
SPEAKER_00: One thing for sure that he knows is that Stadikian will take the first round. After that, he has no idea what's going to happen. First round, Stadikian will win, but after that, no idea.
SPEAKER_03: He says that the first round between Tad Hutchins and David Dadikian will definitely be won by Dadikian. But after that, he says, he has no idea what will happen. He says, he has no idea. What do you think? About Dadikian and Hutchins, that's right. Zurab says that Dadikian suffers from endurance, and it has already been shown in the match with Prudnik.
SPEAKER_01: So, of course, I would like to see Ndandekyan win, but the main thing is that he has enough endurance. And then, maybe, something will work out. But knowing the strength of Hutchins, if he stops, he will pull out from there, I don't know, he will pull out anyone from there. Therefore, here the forecast is 50 to 50, no, probably 60 to 40 for Hutchins. Yes, I sparred with Todd two weeks ago.
SPEAKER_03: uh yeah artyom said that uh uh 60 to 40 for hutchins but uh he said uh i i wish that the decan will have enough endurance uh to do something but if hutchins stops somebody like this is it but he said that uh yeah there is a there is a chance always and he wished that that he can will have enough endurance to do it but he's at 60 to 40 for hunches
