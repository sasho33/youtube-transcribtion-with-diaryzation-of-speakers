SPEAKER_01: okay you hear me now yes that's good that's good how are how are you good good good good to see you how are you doing uh a little bit tired but fine thank you that's good that's good good to hear somehow the quality that cuts
SPEAKER_01: don't know why but now i think we are um we are back to live yeah how is the weather there uh here's somehow it's very warm here like it's not yeah yeah it is like it is what's the second of january but it is
SPEAKER_01: probably do you use Fahrenheit or centigrade centigrade okay it's like like 10 10 degrees outside and it is like uh evening oh wow yeah but I don't know how it is in Brazil ah here is summer today is 32 degrees Celsius oh it is summer there okay here is winter
SPEAKER_01: So even though we take some warm clothes. Here it's hot. Hot, hot. Yeah, but it's not that cold here. Normally it should be cold. Like it should be maybe minus one, maybe plus one, like around the evenings. Yeah, but right now it's like not cold. Okay, good to know. So how are the trainings?
SPEAKER_03: he has been able to train uh even though the injured you know he has been doing some physiotherapy the the surgery he declined it because the doctor said we can try to fix one thing but we can damage another
SPEAKER_03: Then Wagner said, I prefer to stay like this and try to recover what I can with the physiotherapy. Okay, but his right arm is healthy, right? His left arm is injured. The right arm is fine. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, because he's going to pull math math with right arm. Yes, the right is perfect. Can you ask him if he's going to break my table or not? Are you going to break his table or not?
SPEAKER_03: No. Last time, at the press conference, I said, don't break my table. You said, yeah, yeah, don't worry. And the second thing you were like... He said, oh my God, I almost broke it. What? He said, oh my God, I almost broke it.
SPEAKER_01: He said that in the adrenaline, in the moment, he couldn't handle, you know? Yeah, yeah, yeah. So we cannot keep Wagner, who is competing, responsible for the promises that he gave when he's gone. I didn't understand, sorry.
SPEAKER_01: okay we cannot keep him responsible when he is competing and doing crazy things for the for the promises that he gave when he is calm you know when he is like calm you know because he he promised when he is calm but whenever he is competing we cannot keep him uh responsible for that yeah okay
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, he changes as another person. Let me tell him. He said, one thing is us talking to Wagner when he's calm, another thing is when he's competing. He's different when he's competing. Okay. Okay, so basically you are telling me Engin, no need to ask him to give you words.
SPEAKER_01: to give you promise because basically he will probably forget about it during the heat of the competition and so I need to take my own um how to say like I need to make table stronger have some extra table yeah let me say to him
SPEAKER_03: He said that the idea could be an extra table. Okay. And is it possible to use the phone sideways? Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: So... Better now? Okay, yeah. Better? Yeah, yeah. So... He's gonna cost me extra table, okay. He said that he's joking.
SPEAKER_01: The problem is not to break the table. The problem that I get a little bit upset with him last time. Because I was afraid that we couldn't continue the event. We had some tables, but not the official table. They were nice, but not like, you know, with the East versus West table cover and everything, you know. So I was afraid that we couldn't continue the tournament. Good that it was fixable. But this time, I will bring extra table. I have to bring extra table, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, I think Matt came. He's saying, he's joking, he's saying, if I was the last fight, then no problem. Okay, so I need to make his match main event, main event, so that there will not be any more tables, so...
SPEAKER_01: Hey, Matt, how are you, my friend? Good, good, you? Good, good, good to see you, good to see you. Wagner says that I cannot keep him responsible when he is competing for the promises that he gave when he is calm, you know? You thought you could or what? Yeah, I was hoping for that. Like, come on, dude. He has no clue what the fuck he's going to be doing. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: wagner are you gonna beat this guy yes that's the idea he needs to be careful what again that's the idea to beat him so he needs to be careful okay he's going to get him okay okay and and
SPEAKER_03: Matt is also not a very calm guy at the table. Is it going to make you more fired up? He says Matt is not a very calm guy at the table. Is it going to make you more fired up? He says Matt is not a very calm guy at the table. Is it going to make you more fired up? He says Matt is not a very calm guy at the table. Is it going to make you more fired up? He says Matt is not a very calm guy at the table. Is it going to make you more fired up? He says Matt is not a very calm guy at the table. Is it going to make you more fired up? He says Matt is not a very calm guy at the table. Is it going to make you more fired up? He says Matt is not a very calm guy at the table. Is it going to make you more fired up? He says Matt is not a very calm guy at the table. Is it going to make you more fired up? He says Matt is not a very calm guy at the table. Is it going to make
SPEAKER_03: He thinks that his adrenaline will also come up. I think it will be a very exciting fight. So, if Matt is thinking of himself, he better be quiet, right? Ask Wagner, please. He said that if he is too quiet, you will be quiet. If he starts with a lot of provocation, you will be quiet. Do you know what I think?
SPEAKER_03: He thinks as long as Matt is excited, Wagner gets excited together, and he thinks that... I think it's going to be a fire fight. I see. And Matt, Wagner looks very confident, but it's his right arm match. Do you think that if it was left, his chances would be higher than how it is? Right now, I'd say 100%, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, but right arm, right arm? Right arm, right arm, like he said, he better be careful. He better be careful, right? Yeah. He's getting old, right? He's getting old now. Yeah. He's also getting old. Everybody's getting old. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but Matt has more hair. But I just don't give a fuck, right? I just don't care. He also doesn't care about it. He also doesn't care? Okay, I understand, yeah. Anyway, so Matt, basically you are saying that Wagner is going down, right?
SPEAKER_00: Well, that's the plan, yeah? That's definitely the plan. That's been the plan for the last fucking four, East versus West, four weeks. But we need to change it, right, Matt? 2024 is a whole new year, right? Yeah, yeah. And, yeah, unfortunately, she starts with Wagner. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, Wagner, basically, Matt is saying sorry about what's going to happen on January 20th.
SPEAKER_00: with my deepest condolences he's shaking he's afraid right he's drinking yeah um can you ask him i don't i i can't see what his hands are doing i don't know what the he's doing but something's going on over there
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, Matt, do you think that, you know, when Wagner is shaking the table, in fact, it is because he's just like scared and then shaking while he's shaking, he's holding the pegs and that's why they was shaking? No, I don't think that's it. I think it's just a build up and him trying to hold it in for so long and eventually it comes out in one way or another, right? OK. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: He's saying that about the strength, that probably Matt Mask will not hold him about the strength. No chance, huh? He will destroy him? No chance. He's stronger.
SPEAKER_01: the tip that Wagner has. Oh, this is a peak of Wagner. Okay. And Matt, you're supposed to be scared? I'm not scared of nobody. I don't scare people. And Matt, I have seen you a few times losing against people with this pressure.
SPEAKER_01: And Wagner is capable of doing that. Did you make your plans to not to allow him? Because many people, they say that like, they believe that you will be capable of taking his risks. But some people think that, you know, if it is,
SPEAKER_00: like if he has the shoulder behind, he has chance to press. Like, do you have any plan to take him to like the outside of the center? But definitely, yeah. Obviously, I want to separate his arm from his shoulder because he's not really the smallest guy on the card. So I don't really want him behind his arm in any way whatsoever. So even I do believe that, yeah, I'm going to be cracking his wrist, whether or not I'm going to be able to get his arm away from his body quick enough before I can get him behind it.
SPEAKER_03: That's what we're going to find out. So let's see what what is what is. Let me do my part. You know, what is Matt Mask? We need a chance in percentage presence in the present. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
SPEAKER_03: You can't underestimate him. He comes from defeats, so he's prepared, he doesn't want to lose. If he had won, it would have been easier. So I'm not going to underestimate him, I'm going to give my best and I'm going up to win.
SPEAKER_03: And he's saying that Wagner never will underestimate Matt Mask because he knows that he's really strong and he has been preparing himself. So the percentages, he doesn't want to take a risk talking about percentages of chances. But Wagner will do his best, you know, but he will never underestimate his strengths.
SPEAKER_03: he respects a lot you know his uh his career and the all the the victories and yeah yeah only like a few minutes ago i thought that he was really confident of winning now it's just like sound different which one should i believe he is confident he wants he's preparing himself to win
SPEAKER_03: But he doesn't like to say he has percentages, you know, because he doesn't underestimate the power that is coming against him. And Matt, what's your weight? 250 maybe? Yeah, I'm 250-ish, up and down five pounds either way, but more closer to 250, low 250s right now. And did you have good
SPEAKER_00: Preparation. Did you have good training? I've been, I've been busting my ass pretty much ever since I got back last time. So it was a little, little tender last time, but there was no injuries, no crazy inflammation or anything like that. So I've been pretty much right back to it. So, and, and are you, are you in good shape? I feel, yeah, I feel I'm in incredible shape right now. So, wow. That's good. That's good to hear. Yeah. I'm feeling good. So yeah, that's good to hear. And let's, let's see.
SPEAKER_01: what will happen you know this time yeah anyway so we were talking about the table what to do with the table and he said he cannot give me guarantee so I will have to bring an extra table he said and good part about you you only slapped the table you are not trying to break it and I'll be smacking the pieces as they're coming off of him when him shaking them right
SPEAKER_00: No, I'm serious. Either I'm going to bring an extra table or I'm going to make you guys the last match of the event. I think you should bring an extra table. I think if he does lose his mind, I can pretty much, I envision it. The only thing I can guarantee 100% is that both of us are probably going to be losing our shit and our minds somewhere throughout the match, throughout.
SPEAKER_00: and when regner loses his every single time a table usually gets destroyed so unless you want to cut the broadcast and take a five minute intermission while we bring a new one i think you get one ready bring it out and then to cover your costs for what he's done for the table i think you take all the pieces of that table that he's destroyed and you auction them off okay that'll cover your costs
SPEAKER_00: So, so this way, this way we know Wagner is going to destroy the table, right? Especially if you give him a 20% cut of all the pieces that got sold, right? Because that's what everybody wants. He said that he will never break the table to escape from the fight.
SPEAKER_00: oh that's why there's going to be a spare so you don't have to worry about taking easy on this one go eight on the first one and then take it easy on the second one he brings out yeah i i just can't trust him you know he may bring him on five tables let's hope okay yeah yeah yeah
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I was really, really, really upset, you know. I said a bit, but I was upset that last time when he was shaking the table and then I saw that everything was getting apart, you know. And then I was like, you know, what did you do? Like, look at that, you know, how are we going to continue the match? Good that it was fixable, you know, and they fixed it, you know. Because I didn't want papery buyers to be upset with me. And they were like, oh, that was the best part of the event, you know.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I understand, but if we couldn't continue, they would probably complain, you know. Yeah. Well, lesson learned, right? Now you know you always need a second table on that. Yeah, whenever Wagner is coming, yes. Yeah. Does Wagner even remember that I was upset with him? Yeah, he remembers. He remembers it.
SPEAKER_01: He knows. He was feeling sorry. Yeah, yeah. He was like, yeah, sorry, you know. But I'm sure that, like, no one can stop him. Next round, he could break it again, you know. Yeah, yeah. Let's see. Wagner, do you think that, like, your right arm is behind your left arm when both are healthy?
SPEAKER_03: What is your best result at DWAF with right arm? I know you won many world titles with left arm, but with right arm, what is your best result? With the right arm, what was your best result? Because most of your results were from the left. But did you also have significant results with the right arm? In Brazil, I was the champion in general, right arm, left arm and right arm. And in Brazil?
SPEAKER_03: I think fourth in Manchester and second in Bulgaria. Second in Brazil too. In Brazil, he won many titles with the right arm and left with both arms. And what second? Kiviki Vina, Gennady Kiviki Vina in Brazil, World Championship Kiviki Vina Champion, I second place. He was second. With right arm.
SPEAKER_03: Right arm, in 2012. In Bulgaria, championship in 2009. 2009. No, 2007. Second place, Russia. Russia, one place. In Russia, first place. Yes. Bulgaria was in 2010, 2000.
SPEAKER_01: 10 was in America, but maybe 2007, maybe? 2007, yes. 2007. Yeah, yeah, yeah. . Yeah, yeah, yeah. Matt, we have a saying over here in my country. We say that when a crazy guy sees another crazy, he hides his stick, you know?
SPEAKER_00: you know he wouldn't want to mess with him you know just like do you think there may be a case like this this time yeah
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I understand. Maybe if it was a different scenario and ran into each other on the street, we may come to an agreement and be like, you know what? Yeah, well, this is going to hurt us both. We'll just walk the other way. But when it comes to, you know, we're not throwing punches or anything. Right. So it's.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah. So let's be 100% ourselves, right? There is nothing to worry about it. No, except the table. Yeah, set the table. Yeah. And your nerves. Then I deserve it, you know.
SPEAKER_00: Well, you set it up. You knew very well it could fucking happen. I didn't know this. This is all on you, Lincoln. Ain't nobody to blame but you. Yeah, but I didn't know that. At the competition press conference, I said,
SPEAKER_01: Wagner you are not gonna do anything to the table right he was like no no and then the next thing but you know everything that was your first mistake right yeah it was my mistake yeah right so that's why that's why I'm gonna bring extra one this time you know yeah he said that he promises that he will not throw the table on the people
SPEAKER_01: he's not going to throw this on table okay yeah thank you very very kind of him you know that he is that's sensitive yeah otherwise otherwise you're gonna have to start having a cage dome over the matches right how about how about the possibilities of him throwing the mat to the crowd yeah i'm soft though so yeah
SPEAKER_03: Can you ask him that one? Maybe he throws mats to the spectators. It's possible. It's possible. It's possible. How many kilos? How many kilos? How many kilos? 115. 115-ish. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: One, one, five. One, five. One, five. You are 150? Now, Wagner is 156 kilos. Yes. His intention is 160. He's very, he's around like 350 pounds.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, 343. Yeah. He's got about 95 pounds on me right now. And Matt, do you expect this to be a tough match or do you plan to dominate him?
SPEAKER_00: Well, I think I'd be an idiot if I thought it was going to be a tough match. If I thought it was going to be an easy match. I don't think anybody that goes East versus West that you're competing against is going to be an easy match. But sometimes you need to win easy because if it's a war... Well, I really want to win easy. I want to win every one of my matches easily because I want to be able to come home and just start training again. But sometimes that ain't always how it happens, right? No, what I'm just saying is like...
SPEAKER_01: there are some people that when you know that when it is an endurance game your chances are not that super high you understand and that's why your game plan is like mostly on just quick wins you know so what I'm just saying is like do you plan to go against Wagner to position first and pin or you plan to just without you know let him in putting the shoulder behind and just
SPEAKER_00: I want to beat him easily and quickly as possible if I can. Like, absolutely. I don't want to. I don't want a barn burner in any way. I don't want to test his energy levels. I don't want to test his stamina. I just want to send him home with his fucking tail between his legs as quick as possible.
SPEAKER_01: i understand and but the question is that like you will go directly to the pit you know not not the first top roll him you know and then because sometimes when you try to directly go to pin it may be possible to get a hook on the way so that's why sometimes we secure the top row first and then
SPEAKER_00: we go there you know yeah it all it all depends all depends on how everything feels once i get position obviously i want position first because i don't want to be caught anywhere on the inside with that man so yeah inside his inside is probably going to be a lot more powerful than i am but so when i got a question for wagner when was the last time you competed with your right arm it was the last tournament
SPEAKER_03: Good question. Long time. A long time ago. In Brazil or international? In Brazil. In Brazil. Internationally. Internationally.
SPEAKER_03: Bologna? Vysovye. Vysovye. It was an event in Zloty. Zloty tour. Which year? Zloty tour. Zloty tour. Oh, Zloty tour. So in Warsaw. I fought with Denis. He fought with Denis there with the right arm. But it was... Probably like 10 years ago. 10 years ago? His boss...
SPEAKER_03: Pushkar. I treat three places absolutely. He was in the third place. Right. Right arm. Oh, right arm. Yes. Wow. Long time. Ten years ago. Yeah. And since then, he hasn't been fighting with the right arm since then. Only we've been treating recently. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: But he continues training with the right arm and he had some small fights here in Brazil. He had a surgery on the right arm 10 years ago. And now that he has been feeling okay to fight again with the right arm. That he could feel really completely recovered.
SPEAKER_03: So you're a little nervous, a little nervous that you haven't competed in the last couple of years with the right arm? No, he's not nervous. Like riding a bike? He said that left arm, the nervous is the same.
SPEAKER_03: The surgery made him change some ways about how he's going to pull, you know? Top roll. Top roll. Things that he has never done before, like the top roll, he learned how to do now with the right arm.
SPEAKER_01: He had to change some moves. So he's saying that he's going to top roll, Matt? He will go outside? There is a probability that he can use the top roll with Matt. Matt, is he pulling your legs? What's that, sorry? Is he pulling your legs? I don't know what the fuck's going on in his head right now. But he was surprised to hear that, right?
SPEAKER_00: do you think he can top roll you and beat you do i think he can top roll me and beat me i honestly have no clue what the he's capable of besides pushing a whole lot of weight and lifting up big and heavy things in the gym with his right arm so i really don't know what he's capable of on the table so they know the power is there but
SPEAKER_00: is everything still working together is the main thing right so all the connective issues the fire the you know the snap is it you know that's it's different you can be the strongest in the gym but the weakest on the table right so not saying that that's way wagner definitely has experience in that area so he's going to come in obviously a lot better but
SPEAKER_00: been a while that it has been since he's actually tested it against. High caliber level goes the everything. It's it's a little different, right? So we'll see. I don't know. I don't really know what the hell he's capable of. I know I have a really good feeling and understanding more of what I'm capable of now, so. Yeah, we'll see. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: he's saying that he's gonna go to win uh as it has been 10 years that he doesn't fight with the right arm he has been training really hard and preparing himself for that you know
SPEAKER_03: So if it's top roll or hook or shoulder press, he said that in the moment he'll see. Basically, it's trying to confuse you, Matt. Yeah, but the techniques, he improved it more.
SPEAKER_03: with the right arm. He was obligated to improve more techniques because of the surgery. So these 10 years he has been training and improving techniques and strength with the right arm. Okay. Okay. And Matt,
SPEAKER_01: your opponent being also a little you know i shouldn't say maybe i should say sort of crazy at the table does it does it uh gonna make you lose yourself more or you think that you know no need for such thing that you are losing yourself enough and then you will just try to control your emotions and you know make your mind be the leader
SPEAKER_00: during the match for me i don't think it really matters who's on the other side of the table if they're super calm if they're super wired if they're crazy if they're talking it don't matter i need to put myself in that same mindset every time so it's yeah the map master sets up to the table the last 20 times it's going to be the net same map mass that steps up to the table for the next 30 fucking times i saw your your beginning beginner years and you were the same guy you know
SPEAKER_01: hitting the table and jumping you know yeah um there is a super chat by sean and let me read that one on the computer and then we can just go and predict the matches
SPEAKER_01: okay sean thank you my friend for super shed imagine if wagner top rolls and matt goes for a press i i don't know if wagner tacos but we saw matt is pressing last time yeah i thought it would be a bad day for me if i pressed the same way i did last time that was the ugliest press in the history of arm wrestling did it hurt you
SPEAKER_01: No, it didn't actually. I was waiting for it every single time he searched. I was like, okay, I didn't feel nothing. I didn't hear nothing. So let's keep going. You gave very difficult time to Lamparelli with that move. Lamparelli is an expert about top roll and you did very well. We were very surprised you two pulled that way effectively.
SPEAKER_00: Well, if I had pulled different angles, maybe it would have been a different outcome. I never really pulled, never trained, nothing in that area prior to. So, and it was going back and I'm running it through my head and the angles I was going, I was doing everything wrong, right? Very wrong, so.
SPEAKER_01: hopefully if I ever get in that position again, I can do more right. Yeah, I think that if Wagner goes for Tafel, you go for the dead wrist shoulder pressure, that would be effective. I don't know how experienced he is against his own medicine. The kind of thing that you guys...
SPEAKER_01: may not have very i don't know how to say big information about some of the guys that you know will be in this car but uh but there are some of them probably you will um robbie toppy versus i medic do you know i medic matt i don't know who he is no but i know robbie told me very well so yeah and
SPEAKER_00: So do you think you can have prediction by just knowing Robbie is open? I know if Rob is on point, Rob is a bad fucking dude. Very bad dude and retarded straw. So if if Rob has been training his ass off like he should have been for the last eight months.
SPEAKER_00: and not just the last two months, I got to go with Robby. So as long as he comes in, the jet lag doesn't affect him and his head's all right, I think Rob is a bad motherfucker. Okay. And Wagner, do you know them? Robby Tapie and Aymeric from France? It means the standard Robby, by chance. Aymeric? Yeah, Aymeric, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: He saw some fights. He knows. Okay. And who's winning there? Does he know Robbie as well? Robbie Toppy? No. The other one, no. He just knows the French one. Okay. Okay. So,
SPEAKER_01: Matt knows the Western athletes and Wagner knows the Eastern athletes compared to the U.S. Marcio Barbosa or Petrenko? Matt. Marcio all day long. He's going to beat Petrenko? Yep. All day long. That's a right arm match? Yeah. Yep.
SPEAKER_00: If Marcio can keep his elbow on the pad and he doesn't bobble himself out of a fucking victory and elbow falls, I say Marcio is going to destroy him. Marcio is bad. I think Marcio, in my mind, is probably one of the most underrated arm wrestlers in the world right now.
SPEAKER_01: i understand beastman says matt get better this is a super chat he says matt gets better i don't know what he means what gets stronger hopefully it doesn't sound like a health wishes but and wagner do you know oleg petrenko yes yes
SPEAKER_03: And Márcio Barbosa, who is winning here? Márcio Barbosa is very technical. Márcio Barbosa is very technical. And very strong. Márcio Barbosa. Two... Three or two.
SPEAKER_01: 3-2, he thinks, will be Marcio. Marcio wins. But, like, 3-2, you know? A difficult match. So it will be a very close match, but Marcio is going to win? Yeah, yeah. Okay. Very strong. Yes, strong, yeah, very strong, yeah. I think Marcio, this is one, maybe two on fouls, but I don't think Petrenko is going to pin him.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, if those fouls are like really minor, minor fouls, you know that we don't call them as long as it doesn't get outside of the pads, you know, not over the paper. Yeah, I know. Marcio's a floater, right? Oh, yeah. And if his opponent's given any bit of back pressure or anything like that, when Marcio does his drive, his elbow will skip, right? Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: So it's, and it's like, even though it's, it's little, it's still, it's still an advantage, right? So, and they usually end up, but as for versatility and his strength, I don't think many people are, many people are close to Marcio right now. You know that Oleg Petrenko recently beats Chen Shou. Where do you see Chen Shou compared to Marcio?
SPEAKER_00: Where do I see Chance compared to Marcio? Yeah. I think the style of Chance, if he pulls Marcio right, I believe could cause Marcio some trouble. But I still think Marcio is the stronger bowler. Okay. Yeah. Just because of Chance's style. Okay. Roman, SG Record says Matt will get better.
SPEAKER_00: and so let's go to another one iraq is rakashvili versus pauline matt that's the match i'm excited about yeah that's that's gonna be a sick match i think i think that that could be main event of the card if you ask me so yeah
SPEAKER_00: That's not enough of a prediction. I honestly, I'm obviously going to go with Paul Lin. Like, the shit that Paul Lin has been pulling off is absolutely unbelievable. His ability to be able to contain everybody is insane. His inside power is nuts.
SPEAKER_00: thing i worry about is i don't know if he's tested himself against an extreme top roller like rackley is rackley's ability to build to pop people's hands back and take the risks and put them in that compromised position where i haven't really seen paul in pull with a compromised wrist too much and how he engages with it but uh
SPEAKER_00: I think if Paul can contain him, then obviously it's Paul. But I do fear for how good Rackley's top role is to be able to put Paul into some compromising positions. So it's like a classic wrist versus pronator battle will be. Yeah. If it goes inside, Paul in all day long. All day long.
SPEAKER_00: Like that dude's arm strength is getting absolutely insane. So, and if it's, if his wrist strength has caught up to where his arm strength is, then, then I think it's going to be a very bad day for Rockley. Yeah. He thinks is it Iraq? You have to pull in. They won't bless you.
SPEAKER_03: He thinks Pauline is a very complete athlete, but he thinks Irakli is stronger. He thinks because of his strength, he can get this one. Irakli. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: If I can, he's asking you, are you training with Devon? But I don't think you are because once you train with Devon, we usually see. Yeah, we're...
SPEAKER_00: 3,000 kilometers away from each other. He's so busy in his world right now. And I'm flat out my world. We are getting together this weekend though. I'm going to be in Vegas. I'd fight a cell. Yeah, I'm going to be there. So I'm going to get together, get to see Paul in John, Ron bath, Devin, the whole works of them. So this will be like kind of one big last training session before. East versus West. So, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Make sure that you don't pull supermatch or something with right arm. No, no, no. Right arm is out of the equation. And okay, let's talk about Taino versus Zurab Tauberi's left arm. World title match. You remember Taino, right? Taino is the one that beat Sasha left arm. Yeah, he's a bad fucking dude, isn't he? From Russia, right? Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I mean, he was from Crimea and Crimea was part of Ukraine and now Russia. Yeah, got it. And now he's in prison. I don't know. He's originally Ukrainian or Russian. I don't know. But he's representing. Yeah, he's he's a bad he's a bad dude. And do you have a match with Brutnik, too? Um, I'm not sure.
SPEAKER_00: I don't think so. I'm not sure. That dude looks unstoppable, really. I don't know where Zurab is right now with his left arm, how much his right arm injury that he had. I know he's coming back with it, if it's affected his arm training or anything at all. But I'm going to say Tanev is going to take it 3-1. He's going to
SPEAKER_01: stay the world champion with the little time tyler is gonna beat yeah okay and wagner will compete with the army that he got injured no the other arm left arm is gonna be tyno
SPEAKER_03: Yeah. He's a complete athlete too, Wagner thinks. Okay. He was talking about the arm, his left one. And Matt,
SPEAKER_01: Wagner Bortolaccio, Matt Mask. Matt Mask, easy, easy.
SPEAKER_00: Easy. Do you think that you would let him win one round just to be nice or no? No, fuck no. I'm not going to let him win anything if I can't. If I could avoid him winning a thing, I want him going home with his tail between his legs. We talked about this. Bang, bang, bang if I had my choice. 3-0 Matt Mask. That's what you're saying? Yeah. Okay.
SPEAKER_03: And Wagner? Victor, Victor, Victor. I will be the champion. Victor is mine. I respect Matt Mask a lot. He respects Matt Mask a lot, but the victory is his. I will be very smart, he is very fast.
SPEAKER_03: He's saying that he's already paying attention about his speed, that he's really fast. So he's already tuned with this. But about all these techniques that Wagner acquired and the training that he has been doing, he will be the winner.
SPEAKER_03: But Matt has the will to train people there. I don't train with these people. Wagner is saying that Matt has an advantage, that he has more people to train. And Wagner is alone here. He doesn't have this level of people to train, but... You heard that, right? Yeah. You heard that?
SPEAKER_00: Which part exactly? I heard the end. I heard the end. Sounded like an excuse to me. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. It took my attention. It kind of like lack of confidence, right? Like,
SPEAKER_01: It was all like, wah, wah, wah, wah. Here's my excuse. Wah, wah, wah, wah is what I heard. Can you ask Wagner, is that the fact that it sounds like if I lose, it's just because I don't have good training partners? No, no, seriously.
SPEAKER_03: No excuses. No excuses. I will beat him and that's it, he said. He will punch Matt. No excuses. Okay. Okay. We will see. Okay, Matt. Daniel Prokopchuk, Mindagas, Tarasaitis.
SPEAKER_00: That's going to be interesting, eh? Yep. Is Danielle coming up a weight class or no? What do you mean? What weight class is that? 165. They're both in that weight class, right? Yeah, they are in their own weight category, yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know. It's hard to bet against Magnus, eh? Like, hard to, after his performances, his last couple matches. You're talking about Mindaugas or Daniel? Mindaugas. Mindaugas, yeah. I mean, like, how I will tell you is, like, just say with right arm, if they pull 15 times till now, just say that 10 times Daniel won and 5 times Mindaugas won. Like, something like this. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: yeah his table like you is yeah but then i don't know man i really don't know usually top rolls him and then daniel puts the shoulder and then you know and then finally he outlasts uh mindagos but sometimes mindagos wins as well you know
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I think if McNaggis can talk to him like he usually does, but ends up getting more in behind his shoulder and has a more open palm, I think he's got a chance. It's just getting there. If he's not applying too much side pressure where you don't have that open in the belt to pop in behind, right? Yeah. Matt, I have a question for you. Like this East versus West arm wrestling elbow pads are like one something.
SPEAKER_01: is bigger than normal pads, you know, from each side, from four sides. Does it help to someone who is top-rolling like Mindagas, or it would help to someone like Daniel who is doing the deadlift shoulder pressure? I think it depends on who's more in the positive position, right? I mean, Mindagas will most likely top-roll him. Mindagas will most likely top-roll him. But what I'm just saying is
SPEAKER_01: Whenever he is pulling against that shoulder pressure, that shoulder pressure guy has one something from the front side of the pad, and the top roller has one something from the back side of the pad. I kind of think that it helps more to the top roller because he needs to get more, more, more to your side. One centimeter inks.
SPEAKER_00: in a lot an inch will give you i think that much more of an advantage like the wl used to get an inch an inch more out the back right but but i think i don't i don't know if it would help i think if whoever's more in the positive position if danielle can get into his position first then yes is going to favor him if magnus can get into his position first where he's in the top role then it's going to favor him because he's got him more separated to his side of the body
SPEAKER_00: but so you are saying that whoever passes the center to the winning side will have more chance maybe like a half a percent more okay well i don't think i don't think one centimeter is going to make that significant of a difference so okay and what now
SPEAKER_03: He believes that's the highest chances for Mindaguas. Yes. Daniel has good conditions as well, but he thinks Mindaguas gets the victory. Okay. Oleg Dzok versus Tutberidze. Altangelo and Tutberidze.
SPEAKER_01: Most likely you both don't know about Tutberidze is 19 years old. He won the Wafors at 187 while Oleg Dzok won the Wafors at 176. And Tutberidze beat Algat Akteyev this year in the final, in the last Waf, who beat Oleg Dzok in previous year. So after that, Oleg Dzok went down one category and then Tutberidze won that category over Oleg Dzok.
SPEAKER_00: Halgan Akte who beat Oleg Zokh the year before. But these guys are both going outside. Yeah, Oleg Zokh. If he's a top roller, he ain't in the same weight category or close to the same weight category, I don't think he's beating Oleg. If Oleg is even close to the same form he was prior to his accident, nobody's top rolling Oleg.
SPEAKER_00: No, you can't even get fighting super heavyweights that are able to top roll Oleg when he's feeling the point. So I don't think there's any way in hell that's going to happen. I gripped up with Oleg before in Vegas the one year, had a left arm match with him. And I'm telling you, the way his hand is designed,
SPEAKER_01: the way you end up having to grab down onto him and in order to get your thumb down it's literally impossible to top roll that kid so you are basically saying that you don't need to know the other guy if you know the guy is in the same weight of oleg and is a top roller it gives you already an idea that you know it's over if i was a madman i would be willing to put money on okay
SPEAKER_00: Just knowing what Oleg was capable of back when and if he's even remotely close to that because I personally don't think in my mind there's a fucking dude 185 pounds that I probably would not be able to out topple like in the fucking world in a left arm match or whatever I would you know what I mean except for Oleg's up
SPEAKER_00: because i grabbed him before and it literally felt like i was grabbing onto the back of a foot and i was holding the kid down by his elbow so it's yeah artur is asking a question matt the fact your fingers are bent it doesn't doesn't it affect the way you pull when competing uh i i adapted
SPEAKER_00: Every single time I had an injury, I just ended up working around it until that injury got better and where it doesn't hurt anymore. But my style, my finger placements, everything have always slowly adapted and built around my injuries.
SPEAKER_00: So I don't know if it does affect me or not. Sometimes when it's cold or the weather changes, it affects me or grabbing change in my pocket affects me. But other than that, I don't really think it affects me much on the table. And Wagner, anyone in the same weight can beat Oleg Zok with left arm? Oleg, despite having a lot of problems,
SPEAKER_03: Oleg, even though he got a lot of problems, and he's back, he's really unique. He said that he's really a new guy, that he came back really well, that his hand is fantastic,
SPEAKER_03: And he believes that the win is his. And he's cheering for him. Independent if he's going to win or not, Wagner is cheering for him. I understand, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Ivan Matushenko, Rino Matic, Matt. Left arm, 253 world title match. Rino Matic is the current world champion, while Ivan was the world champion before his team was banned. Yeah, Matic is going to take it. He's going to maintain the world heavyweight title.
SPEAKER_00: Okay. Yeah, I understand. His ability to suck somebody into a hook and completely destroy their pronator is absolutely insane. His ability to suck and wrap right around somebody is unlike anything I've ever seen. How about if he pulls 253 title match against right or left against Devon? Can he hook him?
SPEAKER_01: In the left, he might have a chance. Yeah. In the left, he'd have a chance. He says that even right, even if he hooks in one round, he said Devon would probably beat him inside as well. He himself says that. In the right or the left? Right. He says that even hooking...
SPEAKER_01: Like, Devin with right arm, like, he may not be enough. You understand? He said that, like, maybe one round he can hook him. But even in hook, it will be very hard to beat Devin. This is what he says. But he said left arm, I think he likes his chances a little bit better. I think he'd have a fairly decent chance. If Devin was down at that weight cap and everything else, I think he would have a better chance than most, especially in the left.
SPEAKER_00: And the right, no, no chance. But the left, I think. Just like I said, his ability to bail to just swallow somebody and drive straight to that pad and still maintain
SPEAKER_00: full solid pressure while he's completing every single one of his actions is absolutely nuts like it's not even there's like six different things he's doing there but it's all happening at the same time you know what i mean like he's probably the most crispest crispest left arm top roller or sorry hooker i've ever seen in my life
SPEAKER_00: So Christmas, most finesse and not very many holes in his move when he does that. Yeah. And Wagner Reno message versus you want more to shanko. I want to show this is not to not want to change. Not to change. Is this the pronunciation? Mm hmm. Matthew Shingle. Yes. Yes. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: He agrees with Matt about the pronation, all these things that Matt told about the specific things, Wagner agrees. There's no chance for the opponent. He's really strong and solid. Wagner thinks he's going to win easy.
SPEAKER_01: John Burzing vs. Krasimir Kostadinov. These two gentlemen were in Dubai when you pulled against Rambet. Krasimir beat Lachlan while John beat Alexey Voivoda. You guys were together. How do you see this match?
SPEAKER_00: I'm not sure how John's feeling right now. I think I'm going to get to see him this weekend as well. I believe he's going to be there. So we'll see about to pick his brain a little more. But if John is feeling on point with no aches or tweaks or anything in his arm, I got to go with John.
SPEAKER_00: I got to go with John all the way just stylistically. I've pulled Krasimir before in the past and Krasimir has a very big hole and where his hole is, John is a fucking magician at it. So I think if John can low hand top roll him,
SPEAKER_00: which I think he's going to. I don't think Grazi is going to be able to do anything with him. As a Team West, will you guys be talking and discussing about the upcoming events? Oh, I guarantee it 100%. This is probably one of the first times we're going to be able to get that many of us from the West together in one shot. This is the first time I'm going to be able to get together with this many other teams
SPEAKER_00: other competitors from the West prior to a competition. I'm going to be picking everybody's fucking brain. You know what I mean? That's good. That's good. Yeah, no, I honestly, I think like Paul is definitely on to something he's mentioned in the past. If we were able to in the West here get together once a month or once every month and a half more often, I think it would
SPEAKER_01: you know all of our games right so yeah yeah yeah i think i should i should i should i should find something like that happen right so i think i should finance it before every east versus west just like i should finance you know the the tickets you know and then you guys meet once a
SPEAKER_03: you know like like before that i think that's the best idea you've ever had yeah yeah yeah and and uh wagner what do you think john or cross image even though the difference of age between john and the other guy it doesn't mean anything about the age
SPEAKER_03: John is unbelievable. John's hand is different. He's cheering for John Brzezinski as well. But he said that the... what's his name again? Gustav Dinov is always prepared.
SPEAKER_03: He said it's going to be a good fight, but he's cheering for John.
SPEAKER_00: I think we all cheer for John. Personally, I love watching Krazy win. I really wish he was pulling somebody else so I could cheer for Krazy. But yeah, you know what I mean? And I just think it's a bad matchup for Krazy in my house. He's an excellent athlete too.
SPEAKER_03: He already got close to him. He also cheers for Krazy, but he thinks also John will get this one. Even if I would pull John, I don't think I would cheer for myself.
SPEAKER_01: Donnie Anderson, Wagner could be Dave Chaffee's twin brother from Brazil. I mean. What? Sorry. Donnie Anderson sent a super chat. He says Wagner could be Dave Chaffee's twin brother. He thinks that he said that Dave Chaffee and Wagner looks like each other. This is what Donnie Anderson is saying.
SPEAKER_03: Vagner said that more people already commented that Chef and him look like brothers. I think it's because they're about the beard. Yeah. Let's go.
SPEAKER_01: Artem Morozov versus Alex Kurdesha. Matt, you have spent some time with Alex Kurdesha when he came to Canada or not? We never did end up gripping on. Did you see him in the same event or something or not? Yeah, we hung out together. We never pulled at all or anything. He had a super match the same time I pulled Krazy, he was pulling Rick Heisrad. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: But I never did get to hang out with him, do any polling or anything like that. There wasn't enough time for that over there. And he's pulling Artem Morozov. What's your opinion? Left arm, super awaited world title and winner of this match will probably pull Vitaly Lalesin.
SPEAKER_00: I love both of these dudes. Both of them are actually top fucking notch people. Some of the nicest dudes I've ever met in the fucking sport. I want to cheer for both of them. I honestly, I don't know where Artem is after he's gotten sick. Have you talked to him, Engin? Is he feeling as good as he was before? Or is he better than he was? Is he stronger? No, not better, but probably is in very good shape right now.
SPEAKER_00: You know, like he looks like he's in good shape. He doesn't look as quite as thick or heavier as he used to be, but.
SPEAKER_00: Like I I know I I said it as soon as I gripped up to Artem the first fucking time I said there's no fucking way in hell this kid if he goes injury free or doesn't have any health issues within the next two years, he ain't going to be number one in the world. And four or five months after that, he became number one in the fucking world in the super heavyweights. And I honestly don't see anybody taking that away from him if he is 100% feeling on point.
SPEAKER_00: I don't see anybody coming in as badass as Alex Berdecha is with the left arm. I don't see anybody taking anything away from Artem anytime soon as long as he maintains. So you put him as favorite against both Laletin and even if Levan comes back or...
SPEAKER_00: If he's feeling 100% in his left, yeah. If he's feeling 100% and continuing to get stronger, the progression that that kid did up until when he became sick was absolutely unbelievable. If he can get back to that and continues that progression, yeah, I don't think anybody's going to be taking a title from him for a long fucking time. And his stamina, he's proven that his stamina is absolutely insane. And I don't...
SPEAKER_00: I don't know where Alex Kredetsch's stamina is, but I don't know if it's on Artem's level. If Artem can sink anything at all and get a little bit of a hold on him, he just seems to get stronger and stronger and stronger as it goes. Yeah, in my eyes, he's the future of the fucking sport in the super heavyweight division.
SPEAKER_00: If he can stay healthy and continue to progress the way he has with the age of him, there's nobody that's going to be able to touch him, I don't think. He's going to be the new... He already is the number one in the fucking world, in my eyes, in the left arm, so... And what next? He likes a lot of traditions.
SPEAKER_03: But he thinks Morozov will take it. Morozov is coming up. He's really strong. He believes that Kurdesha will try the top row. If they go to the grip, Morozov wins. Morozov will hook him and beat him on top row and beat him.
SPEAKER_03: Let's see. Top row. Top row. Morozov will top row Alex Kurdeyshev. Okay. Yeah, he thinks. Okay. Wagner thinks that if both try the top row and escape and they go to the grid on the top row, Morozov wins. Okay. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And this match is my personal favorite one because it really confuses me. Evgeny Prudnik versus Alican Morado match. Yeah, I don't know who's going to win on that one either.
SPEAKER_00: right now I'm thinking more tough uh you ask me in 30 minutes from now I'm gonna tell you prudnik so okay so yeah I'm like back and forth like Muratov he's a bad bad dude in his left arm doesn't look like anybody can do anything but then you see what prudnik does and comes out with his left arm sometimes yeah did you expect to meet uh did you expect
SPEAKER_00: no no i didn't i didn't see that coming especially after he had lost the right arm match you know like the same day i i didn't see that coming and it came out of absolutely nowhere and yeah so it's like he was able to pull that off why isn't he able to pull this off right
SPEAKER_01: so not not the same opponents because these guys are all very special guys very very special human beings and in the world right so yeah yeah these two are just like
SPEAKER_00: like, like really, really elite or elite, you know, like for me, even if say Bordoff came in and just spanked Prudnik three times in a row, people that don't know arm wrestling would be like, Oh, Prudnik's a bum, but it's like, you can put Prudnik up against any other motherfucker in the world and the left arm in that class. And it's,
SPEAKER_00: it could be the exact same story but for prudnik right yeah so it's like it's yeah like it's honestly i i'm completely on the fence i have no clue who the is going to win that match either and watch it live myself very very special human beings that as an app that i really am fan of both both guys and i i really don't know what's gonna happen i'm just like that match like
SPEAKER_01: I won't be paying attention to anything else during that much, you know, anything else. Yeah, I will be probably
SPEAKER_00: even maybe going on the stage and just trying to get closer. Well, you just want to get a closer look, right? Just because the amount of technicality that's going to be going into their setup before the start, it's going to be a chess game, right? You know what I mean? Unless you really understand arm wrestling and kind of dissect it, you ain't going to have a clue. Why are they fucking around up there?
SPEAKER_01: but somebody that really knows it's like look at these crazy cuts right like they're constantly you know adjusting and making changes to what the other one is before the match even starts right yeah yeah yeah I mean everything that they did I mean incredible match incredible match I am like there is a possibility Murado to have maybe quick pin or pins I don't know but uh I don't
SPEAKER_01: Putin is capable of doing that. But if the match stops, then I really don't know where the match is going to go because they both have incredible
SPEAKER_00: um endurance so we will see well through nick's ability to build to manipulate a setup to his favor is is absolutely absolutely outstanding you know what i mean like it's really remarkable just the way he angles way positions his thumb to give himself those little bit of advantages it's it's it's quite awesome actually you know what i mean so there's no chance except going inside
SPEAKER_01: He put in a fresh match, top roster legend.
SPEAKER_00: mean i will be very surprised i could see him i can see him like i can see it being prudent going in and top rolling off the initial get go just about to get him into the strap so he can walk him in a little bit more coming out of the gates top rolling just about to get that connection with him so he can maybe sink something in or drive it inside right i don't think he will he will
SPEAKER_01: risk because the Alijan is so explosive that while you're trying to grenade and then if suddenly you are hooked you know then you will be in very terrible position but we will see who knows you know they can do they may do anything like that I'm still just watching and learning something new about them you know what they are doing you wouldn't expect but Alijan to just beat Cody Merritt without losing any round was impressive you know
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. Very impressive. Yeah. Yeah. And two weight categories below, you know, so. Yeah. Even, yeah. And Cody's no slouch. Like, Cody's a strong fucking dude. He ain't the fastest motherfucker out there, but he's like grabbing onto a fucking tree trunk, right? So. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Incredible athlete. Incredible. Just like, like, like, I mean,
SPEAKER_01: We all, human beings, are like all just getting better and better and better. But as of now, there is, I don't see anything better than this in that category with that arm, you know. And Wagner, Brutnik versus Ali Can. Ali Can, Kazakhstan. Yeah, Ali Can Murado, the WAF World Super Heavyweight Champion in last two years. Yes.
SPEAKER_03: The little bit that he has already followed them. Both are really strong. He thinks it's too confusing. Really, it's like a brain teaser. Think, who is going to win this one? But in Kazakhstan, as the people are really strong, normally people who he already faced, they are really strong.
SPEAKER_03: He believes that the guy from Kazakhstan can win.
SPEAKER_03: This one. I forgot his name. Alejan. Alejan, yeah. Because of the strength he thinks Alejan can take, they will win. But it will be a very close match. Yes. It's hard to think about it. Yeah, yeah. I totally agree. I totally agree. And just like, yeah, wow, amazing.
SPEAKER_00: And Matt, Todd Hutchins versus David Dadikian. Yeah, I cannot go against Todd Hutchins.
SPEAKER_00: What that guy does and what he's done in the last couple months and the levels he's gained, what he's able to do to maintain his side pressure and keep what he needs and gets what he gets. I've honestly I. Like the visa bad bad dude, I can see I can see David having the capability of possibly doing what Prudnik did to Hutchins.
SPEAKER_00: But, like, the level Hutchins is on right now and what he's done recently, I...
SPEAKER_00: Like my mind's saying, David has that possibility of doing that, but my heart and shit is going, dude, have you not seen what he's done and how he's completely fucked up every one of your predictions against him in the last fucking couple of goals? So it's like, that's another match I'm super excited. I want to see if Hutchins can do it to him too.
SPEAKER_00: Like, if he can, then, man, like, Hutchins is – Hutchins just put himself into a different category. So it's – I got to see Hutchins 3-2. I have to. Okay. It's just – yeah, I – you know, like –
SPEAKER_00: I can see David giving him a shit ton of trouble, but it's like, yeah, like how can you bet against Hutchins? Best of seven. Best of seven. Best of seven? Hutchins. Hutchins. Unless David can do exactly what Prudnik did to him and just bang, bang, then if they slow down in any way whatsoever, if that match stops in any way whatsoever,
SPEAKER_01: Matt, what is more possible? Dadikyan not to be at the level of Prudnik about that ability or you think that Puck is now better than the time that he pulled against Prudnik?
SPEAKER_00: I think it's a combination of the two culmination. OK, I think I really do believe that Hutchins is better than what he was when he pulled Prudnik and I don't know if the beat has that finesse to build to get. Around Hutchins, but.
SPEAKER_00: It's, I don't know, man. It's mind-blowing what that fucking guy is capable of doing and what he's able to do right now. Do you remember your prediction when he pulled against Ongar Bayev?
SPEAKER_00: Oh, yeah, I thought I thought on goodbye of honestly, in my mind, I I didn't see a possibility that Hutchins winning at all in any way whatsoever. I thought fucking I thought on goodbye was going to fucking dance around him and completely fucking immobilize his side pressure, turn him upside down, be able to get him behind it on top of it. I thought he was just going to ninja his ass all the way around him and take him to the fucking pad.
SPEAKER_00: And on Gabaya, the whole time he was just struggling, trying to be able to transition into anything from where they were when they started. It was pretty much hanging on, going, fuck.
SPEAKER_00: Like, what the fuck can I do with this guy? So like it's yeah. And just to see the frustration that was going on and I'm going to buy his mind on how strong Hutchins felt to him. It's yeah. Like Hutchins is Hutchins is Hutchins is the fucking man right now in that way, class in the right arm, unless prudent comes back to pull them. Ain't nobody's fucking touching them. So, and, and, and it comes back and they pull again.
SPEAKER_00: Where would your money go? I'd have to go with Prudnik just because of what he was able to do to Hutchins. But I wouldn't be betting with my money because...
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, like Hutchins just – I don't know. I'd have to see how this match goes before I can give you a full prediction on that. Okay, I understand, yeah. But, yeah, it's – yeah, Hutchins is – I don't know, man. The dude's like fucking mind-blowingly crazy where he is right now.
SPEAKER_01: yeah yeah and he's also a very smart guy very smart guy yeah I mean it looks like it looks like whenever it doesn't look like it's there's not a shit like no no no good policy point but trust me everything the angles the pressure that everything is calculated like
SPEAKER_01: it's nuts like it's absolutely nuts like you have to be a fanatic arm wrestler and actually understand it to really appreciate what Hutchins is actually able to do yeah yeah but if you just like the look then you will say like it's a very shitty way of pulling but trust me everything everything he's doing is super calculated like I I know I'm nothing what he is doing everything I see it and very smart guy but it's just just not like Orthodox way of arm resting that's why we are
SPEAKER_01: maybe thinking that that's why like remember Devon said like a worst technique guy against the best technique guy on Garvey with touching smash but trust me trust me he is not pulling in the way that you know we think is ideal but the way he's pulling he is putting you in a position that is ugly
SPEAKER_01: while he's very capable of doing and strong enough to apply, you know, all kind of pressure and you are not experiencing that keeps you there and just pulls in an angle and gives you pressure that you honestly only really feel from very beginners.
SPEAKER_00: Like when I pull Hutchins, the side pressure that he drives you in, it's almost the same kind of pressure. You know, when you first run up to somebody and you grip up to them and it's the first time on the table, but they're just really, really strong. And they got that just crazy side pressure. It's like, oh, that kind of hurts my elbow a little bit. The angle you're pulling in because it's unorthodox, but you're really strong, but don't pull there because it's going to hurt yourself. Like that's the kind of style and the angle that Hutchins pulls in. And he just has the ability to keep you
SPEAKER_01: in an angle to stop him from getting any other position on. Matt, do you remember the East versus West one in Yalova, my city? You guys, you know, he was pulling against Haji Murad Zola. Yeah. Yeah, that match, you remember, he couldn't sleep, you know, and, but that match was turning point. You know, after that, he really made his pronator, back pressure, everything more effective. Yeah. And now he is
SPEAKER_01: he is able to do like years ago when he pulled against you he was like more like the side way now he's using great yeah yeah now he's using his pronator a lot a lot with his wrist in a somewhat negative position just yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and anyone I'm telling you anyone who weighs as much as he does
SPEAKER_01: if the person cannot control his pronator, if Kat has his pronator, no matter if his wrist is like this,
SPEAKER_01: Todd is going to beat you. Yeah. Unless you are another freak that we never heard of you before, which is not possible. Yeah. But anyone that I know, the way that Prunik beat him, you remember he had the full copy. He was able to get much of his form up. He turned his pronator and then controlled and beat him. You think that you take Todd's hand, you're going to beat him? No, you are not going to beat him. He has a pronator. He will still beat you that way like this. Yeah. You know?
SPEAKER_03: let's see let's see how it will be what is incredible and uh what next attaching sources that he can Godzilla is coming up he has a very good endurance
SPEAKER_03: I think it's going to be a big fight, but Toddzilla is my favorite. He thinks Todd will take. He doesn't know exactly how the opponent is really pulling nowadays.
SPEAKER_03: But he thinks that Todd will take because he has a very good resistance and strength. So he thinks it's Todd Ziller. Yeah, but were you surprised, Matt, when David
SPEAKER_00: I don't know if I was completely surprised but it was it was kind of shocking on how well he did it but I I don't remember
SPEAKER_00: What's that? You remember the match? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I wouldn't say I was completely surprised by it, but, like, David's a bad fucking dude. Like, he's a serious, serious bad fucking dude. But, yeah, like, it's...
SPEAKER_00: hutchins is hutchins is on a different level i believe than when he had pulled even arachne like arachne's definitely leveled up since then too but the levels that hutchins have made when he took them six months off from competing everywhere and just focused on himself man that dude did some serious work some serious work so before before before we finish um
SPEAKER_00: There's one more match you forgot. I think, yeah. Yeah, the right welterweight world title. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I say, I say defeat. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah. Two of them we missed. Vala Ichkichi and Nurdale Aydar Khan. And David Samusha versus Vladimir Mairov. Yeah. I'll give you my David Samusha prediction. And I say David Samusha is going to beat him 3-0. Like he has beaten everybody else he's competed against.
SPEAKER_01: What do you think about David? How do you see him? He is quiet, he doesn't boast, he doesn't show off. Super good dude. Super awesome dude. Very calm, very collective.
SPEAKER_00: goes in, does his fucking job, gets his fucking money, doesn't bother anybody, and gets the fuck out of there, right? Goes back home, starts hunting, shooting fucking wild animals, eating fucking wild meat, and comes back when he gets a fucking phone call and does his fucking job and goes home again. Like, there's nobody that's got as many titles as that man does right now. And I don't think anybody's going to do anything to take it away from him anytime soon.
SPEAKER_00: So his ability to be able to lock when he gets that position and his stamina, he just doesn't type. Like he looks like he struggles a little bit out of the gates with some people. And then usually by around round two, round three, it's 100% all on his side. Yeah. The thing is, it's insane. Absolutely insane what he can do.
SPEAKER_01: things get even more difficult now it's best of seven and the guy is known with endurance so it is oh you just instilled him an extra 10 more years of holding that title right i don't know i i i i was i was gonna pull him and then i had an accident and and i'm i'm still training but just started now after stem cell i rested for like five weeks and yeah don't do it at a best of seven
SPEAKER_01: You should have pulled him before you made that best-of-seven rule. Yeah, there is nothing I can do. I mean, I need to beat him now four rounds, but it will be probably very, very, very hard. But, yeah, we will see. And I want to ask to Wagner. Wagner, will Levan beat Devon again? Or... No.
SPEAKER_03: sorry we couldn't understand the names i said will levan beat devon again or this time the things will change he believes that devon can take this time yes it's now or never
SPEAKER_03: What's the last thing? He said that it's now or never. Oh, okay. Is that because he wants Devon to win or he thinks that Devon levels up? No, Devon... Devon is increasing his level. He believes that he's preparing himself. He's increasing the level.
SPEAKER_03: And he's dominating better the hand of the opponent. He believes that if he can open Levan's hand better, he can take it. The secret, in Wagner's opinion, is to open Levan's hand, open more his hand.
SPEAKER_03: This is what Gasparini did, he thinks. He believes that Gasparini could open his hand a little bit and got the advantage. He believes that if Devon does the same, he can take it. Hermes took Lewand's wrist. Lewand took Hermes' wrist, but Hermes was like this.
SPEAKER_03: He managed to open it up here, right? Gasparini could open on the top. Just open, but after... In a negative position. In a negative position. And after Duda... And then he did the side press. No, it was a mistake. He didn't do a side press. It was a mistake. Where he took... He ended up refusing the two moves, right? Ah, it was the... Wait a minute. It was when...
SPEAKER_03: Wagner is saying that he saw that Gasparini and Levan was 4-0 for Levan, but Gasparini was giving a lot of work for Levan when he tried to open Levan's hand. That Levan had to
SPEAKER_03: get a lot of work so he believes that the secret is about trying to open more levan's hand and paul italian cigar is saying that devon versus wagner left arm he's asking would you pull devon again i think you want that but
SPEAKER_03: Would you like to see Devon again? Yes, he really wants. This rematch, he really wants. And Matt, how do you see this? Devon versus Lewandowski.
SPEAKER_00: I I picked Devin last time and honestly the the leaps and bounds Devin is made and you're looking at four months of preparations and probably about another 80 shots of stem cells getting pumped into that man between now and then and he's going to be dissecting the shit on himself now the fact that he's actually pulled the wand and understands his angles understands a bit of his strength see where
SPEAKER_00: He's been able to struggle with other people. I think Devin's going to come up with a little bit of a different recipe now. And I really do believe that Devin is going to be able to, I think he's going to be able to beat that mountain this time.
SPEAKER_00: Is it because this is the second match and he cannot afford losing again? No, I don't think it's because the second match and he can't afford losing. I just think that he knows a lot more about his opponent now and the progress that Devin has made since he's pulled LeVon to where he is now is significant. And whether or not if LeVon is actually going to be able to come back as good a shape or better,
SPEAKER_00: than when he had pulled him last time after coming back from the slight little injury because he doesn't really know because he hasn't really fully tested it yet so he's going to be he's going to be testing it against the best version of devon that has ever walked the planet and devon from me having a little conversation with melongo he's pretty much going to be flying underneath the radar not traveling a ton
SPEAKER_00: He's got a game plan going on, and he's going to stick his ass to it for the next four months. And the man's more focused and has a lot more clarity in his mind now than he ever has in the last 40 years of his fucking life. So I really, yeah, I think, I don't think we've seen the peak of Devin yet, honestly, to tell you the truth. I think there's still more of a peak of that man yet to come. And I think... He will be against Levan? His peak will come with the Levan match?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I think you're going to see a peak even after the LeBron match. I think another two, three years from now, you're going to see a peak out of that man. So I don't think he's hit his peak yet. Okay, okay. Anyway, so guys, in two weeks...
SPEAKER_01: i see you guys in istanbul and i wish you just over two weeks like 16 days 16 days ah maybe 15 days i think you're arriving on wednesday right i think i get i leave the 16th and get there or what am i yeah yeah so you are like in 15 days yeah 15 days yeah
SPEAKER_01: And Wagner, you take care of yourself, my friend, and don't get injured. And you can break my table. It's OK. I already accepted the fact. And so. WOLFF DOBSON, Yeah, yeah. I mean, not permission. So what can I do?
SPEAKER_01: He said, ah, so now you allow it to one table to be broken. What can I do? What can I do? I mean, I cannot just go there. I got a question for you, Engen. When is East versus West going to start giving out match of the night bonuses? Oh, match of the night bonuses. Okay. You want me to start from here? You want me to start from here?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, maybe we can do something. I'm going to make a poll on YouTube. I think there should be. I think it'd be like with some of those matches, at least this way, if you have like a match like Kredecha's and Hutchins, like it was phenomenal how much effort and everything went into that match. Like I personally thought Kredecha and Hutchins? Not Kredecha. Fucking...
SPEAKER_01: goodbye the last one it was i'd say theirs was matching that at least on goodbye gets to go home a little bit of a bonus too right yeah we will think about it yeah why not you know ufc does it other places do it yeah yeah it's a good idea good idea good idea but you two you two suggested with this event is a little bit opportunism but it's okay
SPEAKER_00: you know i don't i don't want my man to go home completely empty-handed right hey yeah you know yeah you are you are not going home with them completely empty-handed since it's not like yeah well i'm going to be taking a piece of the table with me so i won't be completely empty-handed right yeah yeah yeah i mean i mean just break the table but just make sure that it's fixable please you know yeah like last time
SPEAKER_01: Anyway, so you two take care of yourself and thank you for translation. And see you guys in two weeks. Yeah. See you in two weeks. Matt, Matt, don't overtrain, huh? Don't overtrain you, I guess. No, no, no. You can't make no promises. Come back healthy. Yeah. Take care. Take care, guys. No, we're going to leave the dumpsters alone. Mitch. Take care.
SPEAKER_01: eat well eat well why why why don't you break math
SPEAKER_00: Instead of breaking his table, why don't you break mine? That's true. That's a good idea. Both of them. There's only enough room for one crazy motherfucker in Canada, and that's me. Wagner, you ain't even allowed in Canada. So how are you going to come break my table? Thank you. All right. See you later.
