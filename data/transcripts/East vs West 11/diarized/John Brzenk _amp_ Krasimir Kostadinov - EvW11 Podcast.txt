John Brzenk: hey what's up i put some pressure in there yeah that's good you look like you gained some weight back yeah that looks good i gained the weight back it's mostly
John Brzenk: too much christmas cookies this is uh my newest uh training partner reagan reagan nancy hello hello nice to meet you this guy's a monster he's gonna be a world champion in another year or two that's good that's good happy to hear that where's the guys are showing up on time
Unknown: Stay home crazy. Hey, hey.
Unknown: I need some pro, some pro nation help. Bringing you some pro tips. I mean, he's pretty, keeping him one dimensional.
John Brzenk: In his tips, he's just in the right place, perfectly. Dustin left about a half hour ago, so we got some good work with Dustin too, so. Oh, you train with him as well, huh? Yeah, no, yeah. It's pretty much the guys that I train with, Reagan and Dustin, only the two guys. Occasionally I'll go to bigger practice, but it ends up being just a sit around party more than it is a workout.
John Brzenk: yeah yeah this looks better than the the the skinny John the skinny version yeah no I mean I be quite honest like I was texting you earlier I feel I felt so much better um as far as healthy and joints and everything yeah I just need more more time to
John Brzenk: you know get used to that weight i think if i you know lost the weight and stayed there for a few months it'd be definitely better but it's definitely the healthier healthier version crazy what's going on my man hey guys i'm here but i don't know what's happening do you hear me we hear you okay hey guys nice to see you how's it going
John Brzenk: is it cold there this uh christmas uh in this room it's cold and i was still uh we got some rain today but it's still in the 50s 50s here in phoenix i'm heading up to utah this afternoon though so hopefully they got some snow so are we on just he is training now that's why i've been getting all well it doesn't really look good on camera but
John Brzenk: A little bit. What can you do? How many kilos you are now, John? About 105. Yeah, I need to trim down a little bit. It's Thanksgiving. And then last week I went to Cancun for a week and it was all inclusive, all you can eat. So I'm a little bloated right now. But I'm going to, well, I'll still eat a ton tomorrow for Christmas and that. But I'm going to have to trim up a little bit. But I'm about 105, 105 or so.
John Brzenk: good good good we're pulling that 105 right we're not going to 100. i don't have to lose five kilos do i okay good yeah yeah it's amazing how quickly i mean it's just all of a sudden just put introduced carbs in my diet and i just never could feel satisfied within two three weeks i was like
Engin Terzi: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, Krasimir, John had been training last one hour just to intimidate you with his pump arms, you know. I don't know how to do the proper...
Engin Terzi: proper position you make yours looks huge again how do you how do you do that it's just because it is huge you must have one of them extra wide lenses on your on your and you need you need to know the angles you know like how can you be yeah how can you be the God and don't know how to
Engin Terzi: right come on yeah that doesn't work for me i don't have any biceps do you remember the the guest the arm master game i you and coach ray played and then you were asking me and i was trying to guess and you were like
Engin Terzi: this is number one tattoo you know and I was like yeah yeah yeah and then whenever you said whenever you said he just won the Europeans I was like crossing it you know so my mind is more working with the actual arm wrestling probably then yeah it was fun so how have you been customers I'm good I'm good my preparation is good so far so yeah I hope to be in good shape in January
John Brzenk: Yeah, it's sneaking up on us really quick. I've got maybe going to, well, Christmas this week. Next weekend, I probably won't train, and then I'll do one last workout in Las Vegas on the 4th, 5th. So yeah, no, it's...
Engin Terzi: Yeah, it's coming up quick, isn't it? You will do the training, last training on 4th and 5th, which is like almost two weeks, like 16 days. Yeah, normally I like to... Of course, Devin's going to be there. There'll be some big guns there, so it'll probably really be difficult not to overtrain, but I'm going to try not to overtrain. Yeah, yeah. I think you should only train with Devin and then tell Devin to just give you training, you know, instead of really trying to win, you know?
John Brzenk: just try to tell him to try to hook you but not really so that he will be training for against crossing it but but but why to hook him i may try to talk about him that would actually i would be happy if you do that that way but i think it's a it's a more fair it should be you should try to top row
John Brzenk: You know the new rules, right? East versus West. No, no, no. You got new rules. Two rounds, Atlas can win only with top roll. I love those. That was my idea years ago. I was like, first two matches, you alternate hook match, top roll match, and then you maybe have an alternate match where the loser gets to pick the next match. It would make it interesting for sure. Yeah, it would be like Rustem and Arsene are
Engin Terzi: competing first round hook hook match rustem one zero second round top roll match one one you know you just then it becomes a little bit of a chess match too right because you're like no I would just lay down I was just like do I not fight for this I know that I'm at a disadvantage I'm gonna get on the other side of the table I got the a different technique yeah yeah
John Brzenk: I know that you like to gamble, so that's why you like this kind of arm wrestling. I mean, not the arm wrestling is not complex, but I think it deserves even more complexity. I mean, and different techniques like that definitely would be, I think, helpful for
Krasimir Kostadinov: spectator and the participants john when you say this i want to say something that i don't know how many years ago but you were the first guy to beat michael tot's king's move after his long match with jerry and back then and back then
Krasimir Kostadinov: i thought john beat him with flop wrist press but i don't think this is the way i think that he it's because michael was tired but now after so many years later i realized that this is the way to beat the king smoothly the only way to beat it right because it's happening and this this is really impressive in my eyes that
John Brzenk: you were the guy that understood how to deal with that yeah I needed help but yeah well it wasn't on purpose it was just seemed like it was the only thing that was going to work at that point in the match so and I'm not I'm definitely not known for for doing for doing that but yeah but but just because you know how to beat that guy it doesn't mean that you are always strong enough to
Engin Terzi: to apply that so maybe that day you may be right that you know michael was a little bit exhausted as well you know after like two minutes yeah he definitely had he definitely had the edge you know for sure yeah we were we were texting earlier how did uh ferret end up with the layton
Engin Terzi: Ferit was in incredible shape. He came my way. I can say just this for Ferit today. David you watch? I saw that he beat Silayev, Zaur and Vitaly.
Engin Terzi: Yes, he beat in a row. But in the final, he lost. He couldn't sleep because his elbow was getting out, as far as I realized, you know. And then in overalls, I think also Slav did the same thing to him. In overalls, he couldn't make top four. But in his category, he was second place. But in this strap,
Engin Terzi: he really beat first live, second Zaur, and third Laletin, all with pin, you know, no fouls. And then in the final, you know, Laletin has very strong grip. He was catching from his fingers, his elbow was getting out while he's trying to go to strap. In the strap, he was almost untouchable.
Engin Terzi: Yeah. And now you've told me this before, but Barrett, he's, he doesn't pull, he doesn't have the strength that he used to have in a hook. He doesn't ever want to pull inside. Does he have like elbow issues or? Today, I saw him only side pressure and outside. I didn't see, but I saw that when he and Laletin, the first time they met in the strap, like first Ferit had the control. With time, more he pressed, then Ferit lost his wrist. And then Laletin lost, he lost, like they were like this. At the end, he just
Engin Terzi: push him like this with the dead wrist, and then Laletin arm. But Laletin really had a war against Ermes as well, like two weeks ago. It is still impressive that he pulled very good, but Ferit was incredible today. He was just like huge, you know. I wish he came to my event that day shape, you know. Well, what's the next match for him for East versus West? I don't know. I don't know. First, he needs to come. We need to sit down, talk. But he looked incredible. He was arms, everything.
Engin Terzi: He was very strong, yeah. Yes, today he did some miracles there. Yeah. Everybody has a day, right? I mean, when you think you're all washed up and you can't seem to win a match, all of a sudden you get in a... Yeah, today something else happened. You ever heard the name Abdullah Eldaro, John? I have heard that name. Yeah, Abdullah Eldaro was like world champion, but like one of the top puller.
Engin Terzi: He was there with Maxim Maximov and other guys. He was a very strong guy. But today I saw him in this event and I saw him one round,
Engin Terzi: the champion of the amc he took him here and then he won with two fouls and then somehow i thought he was in the final but then i didn't see him again you know but he pulled very strong you know he was very strong and he is also near very 50 years old 45. what's this organization it's a russian organization from yeah yeah amc amc yeah okay doesn't have any affiliation with the the old a1
Engin Terzi: No, these guys are I think from Chechnya. And yeah, this was their sixth event as far as I know. Yeah. Very, very, very good event. Yeah. And so let's see what will happen. But the
Engin Terzi: russian plus lately the super heavyweights not doing super good saliva is losing to zaur and lalatin and then zaur lost to swedco and today lost to ferrets and lalatin lost against hermes and but but still they are very good but just they need to win something yeah one you think you got everything figured out and then something like that happens and it's like oh no they aren't the best cool
Engin Terzi: yeah it was interesting and adamus was very good as well last last time yeah his match with uh vatelli was like yeah later like back and forth yeah it was a gut check for both yeah now it's nice to see you don't see those kind of matches very often but it's exciting when it unfolds like that let's see let's see let's see how it will be let's see how it will be and um soon soon
Engin Terzi: There will be another event with eight world titles. Eight world titles. I don't know how we will do it. You know that this is now best of seven. You know. Yeah. And the four rounds we need to win and
Engin Terzi: um but our our match will be best of seven as well no no best of five because this is not title three best of two looks like if i have my way so who are you training with now uh juniors mostly juniors and and dimitrina petrova oh yeah yeah is she gonna pull 60 kilo this year
Krasimir Kostadinov: I think so, I think so. She just came and won Europeans and Worlds, you know. But right now, when she's pulling me with two hands, we are 50-50. You're joking me. No. It's good news, John. John, you're going to destroy this guy. He can't even beat the girl pulling like this. I get to use two hands. I can tell you something, that when I won Zloty 2019,
Krasimir Kostadinov: And after that, when I beat Kurdecha, I was preparing with her as well. Yeah, yeah. But I kind of feel like you are being nice a little bit, not to hurt her. No, actually, we're nearly 50-50 right now. If I'm a little bit too aggressive at the start, I beat her. If she takes the start a little bit, she beats me. I mean, how is it possible? My student used to, he walks around 75, you know, world champion guy.
Krasimir Kostadinov: He cannot beat me with two hands like this. How can you beat Dimitrov? But you're top-hauling him, and I'm going for the hook. Oh, okay. Okay, I understand. Because you're pressing with the downside of your hand. Yes, yes. I don't attack her hand. Yeah.
Krasimir Kostadinov: Well, that's a trick. When somebody's pulling with two hands, if you're pulling this way, then you drive down on them. No, no, no. If they're lifting up, then you go backwards. No, no. She catch like this and I attack exactly where she is holding. Holding, okay. So you know where to attack, John? What's that again?
John Brzenk: so so when was the last time you guys met to it 2013. right yeah i remember pulling you after we had that super match in istanbul actually actually you beat me at a1 but i was just too exhausted after together i don't even remember that i i don't remember the a1 i think i was at a1 twice
Krasimir Kostadinov: i just i didn't pull you back then i was too exhausted i had two matches with anatoly's could dive and after that with tukarev and i didn't pull you yeah yeah but we but we had we met there oh we did okay what was it was it the year that john beat hajumrat zola when he was in the final or no no it was it was when he put dave chaffee
John Brzenk: Oh, okay. Yeah, but when he pulled Dave Sheffield, that's the one that, you know, he had final with Pushkar. No, no. Zolov, no, that's not correct. I pulled Zolov and then Dave pulled, or no, Andrei Pushkar pulled Saplenkov? Because I remember pulling, I pulled Andrei because I remember him smashing me that day.
Engin Terzi: And I never... Yeah, in the final, in the final, because Dennis and Dave killed each other. Oh, that was the one. That was the day that I beat JP. Yeah, yeah. So, yeah, you're right. You're right. I'm trying to think what the other A1 was then. The first A1. Michael Walkspace says, Merry Christmas, Legend, Engin Krasimir, and the God John. So, John...
John Brzenk: You're going to beat this guy?
John Brzenk: do my best thing and i'm you know i you know i've got my good days and bad days i i struggle uh during some workouts where i just shake my head and thinking what the hell am i continuing to do this other days i feel like i can still push through it i can do it so um i've done everything i can do i've been training hard you know i'm trying not to cross the line i've had some arthritis is is problematic but um
Krasimir Kostadinov: yeah i'm bringing my best my best so we'll see and you crossy i feel pretty good right now i just hope that i when i go there i'm i feel healthy enough and to right now if i consider the weight that i lift i'm in very good shape
John Brzenk: I hope that I bring this to Istanbul. That's a difficult thing is the timing, especially as you get a little older. You want to train, you want to train hard, but then it's so easy to overtrain and then be a little bit sore and it can definitely mess you up in a hurry. The preparation is actually more about how well you heal weeks before
Engin Terzi: the match then that is how the training goes looking forward to it yeah let's see let's see how it will be looks like looks like this is gonna be a tough match i don't expect it to be easy uh krasy how do you like do you remember that i i like nothing to take away from you you won't deserve him against john in the super match you beat him uh five zero
Engin Terzi: but do you remember that a week before that he was in slovakia pull senecan against golemano yes yes yeah you you remember right there that so do you i'm i'm sure that you are coming there to win you know i mean no need to be nice i'm sure that john is also coming uh uh to win but um but do you expect this to be tougher than last time
Krasimir Kostadinov: I don't know, I don't know. And I noticed that he pulled in Slovakia back then, but I can say one thing from my side. The last two months back then when I was preparing for him, I was not preparing my wrist and fingers. I thought that he is going to hook me back then. I was preparing my hook.
Krasimir Kostadinov: Because at Zloty, when we pulled, I hooked him out of the straps. And to hook somebody out of the straps is way more difficult than in the straps. And back then I was thinking, he knows that I hook him out of the straps and most likely I will hook him in the straps too. And he would prepare his hook. And that's why I was preparing hook for hook.
Engin Terzi: But if you remember, he still was getting back from the shoulder thing, you know. I don't think he had the hook to, you know.
Engin Terzi: the press so he had to get out you know i think yeah but i was thinking that he is going to hook me and i was prepared for preparing mostly my hook so yeah yeah i mean if you are john brzing i mean you have outside ability i think the year before when you beat him he still wasn't when did you beat him
Engin Terzi: actually it was just three four months before yeah yeah 2012 Zloty like like you pull him in march march yes it was four months yeah four months five months yeah yeah yeah yeah so yeah i understand but i i think that he probably was a little bit better than the Zloty shape because he was still coming back from his uh surgery and do you expect him to go inside this time
John Brzenk: Not actually. This time I'm expecting him to go for... It's pretty well known I got this much chance inside. And I'm sure that he doesn't expect me to go for the top roll as well. No. No. Well, yeah, that's the question. Is it going to be more difficult to top roll you if you're top rolling or when you're trying to hook? I mean, so that's something you have to decide. But yeah, no, I...
Krasimir Kostadinov: Yeah, I'm not going to be attempting any hooks. So how close are you to Samushia? I mean, Bulgaria is a big country. The thing is that we pulled about 10 days ago. Oh, you did? Oh, okay. Yes. And it's strange that he doesn't hook me, actually. He's top rolling against me. And he doesn't go for traditional top roll. He's doing something like this open arm top roll. But you like that?
Krasimir Kostadinov: you like it you like to squeeze the people there you know whenever they go the the truth is that he was taking my wrist he was thinking yes but i was beating him with dead wrist oh when they are that open then you just don't care about that and you just yeah this is what was happening he was taking my wrist and and i was holding here please don't pull a rockley on me don't be beating me with a dead rat
Engin Terzi: It is different. It actually was going back pressure, back pressure, back pressure, losing. He still had pronator, while Krasimir still protects his pronator, but still a little bit forward move, forward, not so much. Like, you don't start to pull back this way, unless you were pulling same against the, in your last supermatch against Lachlan. I don't know.
Krasimir Kostadinov: actually Lachlan was way stronger than I expected yeah he looks impressive against certain people and then not so much against others he seems to have his his side his side pressure is not that great but his biceps and pronation were really solid really strong you guys were in together right in Dubai
Engin Terzi: I didn't. You were in the same event, yeah. Yeah, I didn't get a chance to pull him, of course, but yeah. No, no, I mean, when you pulled Alex Voevoda, he was pulling Lachlan. Yeah, that was ringside. Yeah, we said this match even before that event. He said, give me the winner of Lachlan-Krasimir match. Right. Yes, actually, yes. Yeah, that's good. That's good. I like it.
Krasimir Kostadinov: So Sancho doesn't go inside. Is there anything? Actually, a week before that, we pulled a game and it was happening the same thing. He was top rolling me and once he was inside with me, I beat him inside. It was tough, tough match. Actually, we're very close.
Engin Terzi: very close very close yeah but you have always been close like last many years yes because yes you had I remember matches like minute long you know almost yeah yeah you remember you told me you told me that like there is no hook match more than like longer than one minute because you said that before one minute somebody's wrist is going back and any of your matches with Samushia those long matches were they around one minute
Engin Terzi: about one minute yeah about one minute but you don't see any two minute long match in hook right because you said the wrist is good this is what he said i tried and i couldn't find i think he was right about it john i didn't see like a two minute long hook match you know like actually even if they are both deep hook puller once wrist is just giving up after a point you know somehow
Krasimir Kostadinov: this is what happens i i was thinking about this the first years of my career and i realized that when you're in hook with somebody and you hold hold hold and after one minute your arms start your hands start to open automatically right this is what happens yeah even attacked how long was your your match with ferret
John Brzenk: probably wasn't one one minute huh oh you're talking my match with Farron yeah yeah it didn't last a minute yeah it seemed like a minute it seemed like an eternity but it was probably 30 seconds 40 seconds you know that's amazing
Engin Terzi: There is a super chat. Furious. John, I don't know if you saw, Travis was saying he could beat Hermes with ease on the left hand. What is your thoughts about it? Also, are we going to see you face any supers in the future or staying in 105?
John Brzenk: Yeah, I don't think I don't think I'm very competitive. Maybe with the B class super heavyweight pullers I could occasionally pull if they they want to pull me, but the A class guys you know the top 12 guys top 20 guys probably in the super heavyweight class I need to
John Brzenk: i have no i have no business pulling pulling with them anymore i mean some of them you can pull like you pull cordial but but it hurts you you know you don't need to put that pressure on you i could show up and maybe make a little bit of a fight but i i'm not going in with any kind of confidence like i'm going to be able to you know do anything so no i want to stay uh either 105 or um if i'm really motivated get back down to 95 again and try to
John Brzenk: know maintain that for a few months where i can get used to it um we'll see i mean i don't know i need to i need to sort this uh arthritis out i need to need bigger better drugs to keep this calm down because it's getting to the point where it's it's just really frustrating me i i i'm wondering what hutchins is doing about his arthritis because he's doing miracles
John Brzenk: yeah so he didn't he didn't start pulling until he was in his 40s so I don't know yeah yeah yeah my mom had a really bad arthritis so I kind of blame it a little bit on genetics I don't I don't completely blame it on arm wrestling because at this point I'm feeling it in my hips and in my back and in my left shoulder so I mean it's throughout my whole body but um yeah Todd Todd's just still doing 20 year old shit I mean I I it's crazy I mean yeah but people people compares the age you know they say okay John is 59
John Brzenk: thought is 57 but the the mileage yeah you have been pulling for 40 years he has been I don't even know if it's a mileage I just think it could possibly be just genetics I mean I know some people some friends from high school that never arm us in their lives and they're they can't they can't put their jackets on I mean their shoulders I feel like okay well I'm at least better than that but
Engin Terzi: But anyway, yeah. So that's my answer. 105 is for sure. Krasimir, just think about, just imagine the pressure that John had been handling during his career. Just think about Richard Lapkus, Gary Goodrich, Cleve Dean, like Pushkar, Vala Karev, and Travis, and Devon, and Dennis Cipengo. I mean, you also pull a lot, but you know that he has always been like overall
John Brzenk: There's only a few occasions where I could remember going, oh, I heard something or I felt something pull. So most of those big matches even were pretty controlled. You are not hurt, but just remember that you had that pressure. It's just like overused. You have so much pressure there. It doesn't mean that you need to get injured.
Krasimir Kostadinov: yeah but the difference the difference between me and john is that when he was pulling this super heavy weights he was most of the times or always yes yeah while i'm pulling like this most of the time but he probably had tougher matches like you also beat some of those super heavy weights but whenever usually when he was playing against dennis there was a match
Engin Terzi: But whenever you were meeting Dennis, usually it was taking like two seconds, you know? That's true. That's true. Do you remember his match with Vala Karev, 98? Yes. You know, like long match like this. I mean, like if you have it, like pulling Vala Karev is one thing, pulling Vala Karev like 30, 40 seconds. He's putting 200 kilo frame on you like this. We put him on a scale. He was showing 180 kilo.
John Brzenk: I would show error, you know, when he wasn't bringing him up, I would have loved to pull him fresh. What made him so tough was my pre-match with a Reckley. I had a, I had a fricking war with that directly from Georgia. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And it was like five minutes later, they called me up for, uh, for that, the, uh, Allen match. But yeah, no, I was in the bathroom running cold water. I'm like, baby, wake up.
John Brzenk: But, yeah, whatever happened to him, is he still alive or is he wrestling or what is he doing? I don't know. I don't know. No, he would be formidable if he decided to come back in the arm wrestling world, right? I mean, he was huge. I don't know. I don't know what he's doing right now. Hey, what do you think about the other question, Travis and Hermes? I was a guest for Travis' show and Hermes was there.
John Brzenk: I in fact I wasn't guess, but I they send me the link. I I join, and then they start to talk, and then today was in Adam as they posted. They would pull left arm. I don't I I really have to think about it long and hard, because I don't know. Travis's strengths are the same as armies. So
John Brzenk: I talk about left arm, huh? Left arm. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Left arm. Yeah, Hermes would beat him right up. But left arm, Travis got a lot of back pressure, and he's a master in the straps, and he hits hard. Evgeny if he comes 90%, I kind of think he has a good chance to beat Hermes. Hermes will be surprised, if nothing else. Yeah, it's not a...
Engin Terzi: know it's not going to be an easy match for either one of them by any means but i think that definitely travis is uh is competitive against irmi's left-handed if he comes in decent shape yeah cross him did you know that arsene is training really he didn't stop he was my guest here so it was my plan to bring him here and then so he would have the spirit you understand whenever he is here as a guest and now he has been training non-stop and april
Engin Terzi: He will probably pull, can't be. But of course, not the level that you are in, John, right now. But because he's like 11 years, he didn't pull. But eventually, you know what's going to happen, right? Eventually, he's going to pull you and pull John. You know, he will look for revenge. And John will look for revenge. I need that match to be sooner than later, Ingen. Yeah, but just let him train every month. Because 11 years is a long time, you know.
John Brzenk: Yeah. No, he looked good. That's interesting. Yeah, he looked good in Istanbul. I mean, you know, definitely a little soft. I mean, he didn't look like too badly out of shape. And I'm sure he's still, the tendons are still there. You never lose that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I love it. I love it that everyone is coming back. Evgeny, even, even, even...
Engin Terzi: Alex Voivoda, Denis Tiplenko, Arsene Villiers, you know, all of them are coming back. It's very good, you know, very good. Yeah. Whatever happened to the other big guy that was Trubin? Does he still pull or? I have no idea. I didn't hear anything about him lately. Where does he live? Does he live in Russia? I think he lives in Russia. He lives in Russia? He lives in Russia as far as I know, yeah. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: I think that he has four kids, so. Different priorities. John, did you know that Krasimir, you became father, right, Krasimir? Yes. Congratulations. Congratulations. And around the same time, also Bojidar became father, right? A little bit earlier than you. Yes, a few weeks before me. Yeah, yeah. You were expecting like a week or two after Dubai, right?
Krasimir Kostadinov: yes actually it happened a month after that oh okay yeah that's good very nice little boy or a girl girl a girl okay yeah bring a girl today she turns two months today oh yeah that's good that's good that's nice
Engin Terzi: So looks like you both will be very respectful to each other. John will say that, you know, he will do his best. I'm going to talk all kinds of trash. I'm going to show up with muscles flexing and yeah, maybe not. And Krasimir, you are like, you are type of person that like, you are one of the few people that never hold back what you think.
Engin Terzi: You know, not really politic talking, you understand? You are just straightforward. What is your chance about beating John? Of course I'm going there to win. Yeah, but what is your objective now? 60%?
John Brzenk: like you have like no i don't want to say such a thing you don't want you you like these odd things you're very you're very analytical like spot on is it 59 and a half yeah what is it like okay i'm just trying to steal the pot you know come on i'm an organizer i should say this that anything is possible because when i was going to pull marcio a few years ago
Krasimir Kostadinov: I was 100% sure that I would beat Marcio. 100%. There was nothing in me that was wondering what would happen. I was totally sure that I would beat him. And at the end he beat me. So I realized that nothing is sure in this life.
John Brzenk: That's, that's so true. Many cases when I've been super confident and then got my ass kicked and other times where I feel like I got no chance and end up coming out of the winter. Like, how did that happen? So guys, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what is this crazy guy doing here?
John Brzenk: Oh, yeah. No, he's going to hurt himself. He shouldn't be doing this. Someone should be watching him. He needs a baby. Tozilla doesn't get hurt. Tozilla is almost like Chuck Norris. I am sure about that weight. Yeah, he was so indestructible. And he's had a couple of surgeries now since he was mopping off. So it's still a possibility. He should be careful. He's getting older. I mean, I don't know. According to the rumors, the weight that he threw got hurt.
John Brzenk: yeah right what do you feel with david david david's form i mean from what i saw him do to iraqli uh i think todd might be pulling in an awkward position for a little bit but it'll be a that's good that's an exciting match you like to bet where is your money going i i won't bet against todd i know how he's got he's gotten crazy crazy crazy strong um
Engin Terzi: yeah he beats david i definitely want to see him lose the weight and cool sasho i think that'll be from what i felt from sasho um yeah that's a that's it yeah why didn't you put sasho versus todd hutchins actually said that he was gonna go down to 95 kilo right after the match he said he's gonna stay which wasn't planned it's not what he told me he said he's gonna stay in 105 kilo until
Engin Terzi: on Garvey against the rematch is what he said you know I had no idea and I said okay and then until yeah no but it was so in April in April if if if if touching swings April will be 100 on Garvey versus
Engin Terzi: Todd revenge match. Yeah, so if Todd beats Dadikyan, and then the Apple match will be his third title match. So if he wins, he's getting the belt permanently. Okay. But I asked Ongarbe, what is your plan? Apple, do you want to pull? He said, yes. Who do you want to pull? Hutchings, he said. And I said, what if Hutchings loses to Dadikyan? He said, like,
Engin Terzi: okay let me think about it because he is in between running after the belt or getting revenge from
John Brzenk: Right, I think so. He cannot decide, you know where to go, you know. No, if David with the Vatican wins, he should. He should focus on a match with that account, and then Todd can maybe come back in the picture of to regain it based on how that outcome is. But I think he doesn't want him to. He doesn't want him to go down to 95 and stay there forever, and he will just say your question. I mean, he was so deserving and and he was heavy after our match.
Krasimir Kostadinov: everybody wanted to see him go against critical so I mean it's just natural to have that match right I mean it had to happen in my eyes it was mismatched before the match I was 100 sure that thought will win oh wow really okay against you against you a gay stronger life
Engin Terzi: oh yeah but listen some people just i don't know i hope you are not one of them because my my opinion about you being knowledgeable yes the match was way harder than i expected okay okay that's good because people says how dominated on that way like i don't know probably their definition of domination in my definition of domination is different because it was a war you know like that was shaking here you know and a few times
Engin Terzi: Ongarbe was able to bring him here, but he couldn't stay there because of Tata's incredible side pressure. But that was a war, you know, yeah. Yeah, I agree. But it was the third round. The first two rounds, Toto was... Still, still, but it was just like a war here, you know. He was able to lock it.
Engin Terzi: he was holding him like no problem he was holding you know where he lost whenever he attacked and then he lost his wrist if he would stay here trust me he would hold him there 30 40 seconds more once he's like okay i'm holding let me go once he go and then when he face i kind of disagree i've been in that position with todd before and that you feel like i got great position i'm just gonna hold out and pretty soon it's like
Engin Terzi: yeah but just if you watch it if you watch it he had like more he even bring his shoulder he was he was able to hit him you know like hit him and bring him to the center but he was losing his wrist you know i do you guys agree that my opinion anyone who cannot control house pronator in that weight category cannot be taught but you need to really control the guys porn if he has the pronator
John Brzenk: you think that you are taking his wrist and you are winning and you're missing the pronator and he has that, he will hit you. You cannot, nobody can do a side pressure, you know, match. You almost have to attack him like you're going to hook him. You need to cup him. You need to turn his palm up right. That's how pronic beat him. That's how pronic beat him. Pronic has a full hand wrist control. It's hard to be confident doing that when he's so compact and he's
Krasimir Kostadinov: he's on fire to hit hard outside like that it's just it's not something that you feel naturally like you're going to be able to do do but actually i didn't expect prudnik to beat him that easy yeah me neither in the hook actually they were very close because the second match prudnik went in hook and thought stopped him here but after that nick was very dominant by the with the top row
Engin Terzi: Yeah, let's see how it will be. Okay, let's start with some of the predictions from the East vs. West XI. 14 matches, 8 title matches, 8 title, world title matches. Again, I think that this event will finish 2-3 a.m. No, no, no. Just imagine that John is going to do a trio against you, each match one second. So it will finish in... Just joking. Okay.
Engin Terzi: Believe me, this event will be very late. We will see. That's good. Mask my words. They're all words. That's cool. How long is your match going to take with John? Since you know how long the event will take. Just start from your own. Start from your own. Let me take you to the trap.
Engin Terzi: i cannot say this oh so you don't know how long your match is gonna be but you know that how long the event is gonna be okay yes yes anyways let's start let's start with you know you know these athletes you pull against him i'm eric i'm eric you know him right john from france i medic he's pulling against robbie toppy robbie toppy is going down to one of five i think actually he's already around there
Engin Terzi: Oh, wow. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And Robbie pulling left arm with Aymeric from France. Any any opinion?
John Brzenk: Actually, his name in French is Aymeric. I know he doesn't look like much, but I know he's super strong. And I haven't pulled Robby that much. My experience with Robby was probably 15 years ago, so it doesn't really apply. So I have really absolutely no idea how that would go. But no clue. No clue. And you, Krasimir? I don't know this guy, Robby Topie. I don't know him.
Krasimir Kostadinov: okay so then let's go to the next one marcio barbosa oleg petrenko for me it's very close i cannot say i really expect this match i expect marcio to try everything to try top row try cook this is what i expect i don't yeah i don't see marcio beating uh petrenko inside and petrenko has got
John Brzenk: very good hand control i i'll be surprised if if marcio get outside and pull off a top roll i i i see oh like yeah i i think if he controls a match he's got better better arm strength side pressure than marcio but marcio does have you know the back pressure and if he can get outside a little bit but oh like marcio
John Brzenk: i don't want to i don't ever want to you know uh this will be a tough match i'll be trying to be politically correct and i don't want to go against any of the western pullers but this will be a tough match for marcio if marcio pulls it off good job marcio oleg's a formidable powerhouse and classy i really don't know who would win very close huh yes
Engin Terzi: They're pulling at 105 also, right? Is there a weight class? 105. 105, yeah. Yeah. Okay, let's go to this one. I'm not sure if John would know. Vala Içkiti versus Aydar Khan. But I'm sure Krasimir knows the athletes. Yes. Very good two outside pullers. But
Krasimir Kostadinov: What I heard from Bojidar is that Aydar Khan was injured at the Worlds. No, Aydar Khan won the Worlds. You're talking about Saudi Arabia. Yes, in Saudi Arabia. I will tell you the story when we are face-to-face or privately, but he is not injured. Okay, because I saw that he won convincingly with left and with right, I don't know what happened. Right, he just lost like this, right?
Krasimir Kostadinov: Yeah. I will tell you that his ride is much stronger than lift. All you need to know. Yeah. Okay. In this case, Aydar Khan is the favorite in my eyes. Is it because of the speed or power? He's just a very technical arm wrestler. The other guy is super strong. But I just think that Aydar Khan is just the better arm wrestler for the moment.
Engin Terzi: Okay, I understand. So let's go to the next one. Artem Taynov versus Zulap Tauber is the left arm. In my eyes, Taynov is huge favorite. Wow. Do you know what is interesting? I think Prudnik and Ali Can, I think they were my guess. And I think they both said that Zulap is going to win. I think, if I'm not mistaken. And you are saying they're huge favorites.
Engin Terzi: like in my eyes yeah but you mean like domination you are expecting i think that he will top roll him and will beat him convincingly do you remember the match that efe top roll zura but zura beat him like this or not yeah but artyom is very strong everywhere and also he has the finishing force to top pro sasho it was very surprisingly for me the first two rounds he was able to top of sasho
Engin Terzi: Didn't Sasho also go outside? Yes, but still. No, I mean, whenever somebody is going outside like Sasho to top roll him and when he's going deep in top roll on him is just a little bit different, I think. Yeah, but in the second round, Sasho went for the hook and Tom was here and his pronation and back pressure were solid iron. He couldn't move, huh? Didn't move. Okay. Yes. Yeah.
John Brzenk: And you have any idea about title versus drop left arm? Yeah, all I can say is what I saw, how he competed against Sasho. So, I mean, I have to agree with Krasimir. I mean, seemingly he would be the favorite. I don't... Today, he very easily won AMC 95 kilo right arm because there was no left arm. Yeah, I remember pulling him when he was... I think it was at the Yalta back 10, 15 years ago when he was just a little boy. He was...
Krasimir Kostadinov: powerhouse so yeah i know yeah he's come a long way uh john won today with right arm no i think i pulled i can't remember if i pulled him right i think it was left no no no i asked him again i asked him again so today he won like in russia yeah yeah yeah yeah he won yeah well i didn't know that yeah yeah and so let's go to the next one
Engin Terzi: John, do you know that all of the elite pullers of today and last 10 years, 15 years are your fans? You know that, right? You know, right? Yeah. Well, thanks. No, no, that's the truth. You know, whenever you were going to stage, we were looking at you like you are an alien, you know. They've all grown up. They're all, yeah, I remember my young kids.
Krasimir Kostadinov: um a crazy man when you say this again i want to say something that i started arm wrestling 2005 and when i started i i had two goals in my mind to become world champion and to beat john brzenk while he is still competing i was hoping to get a match while he is still competing because back then he was uh how old were you 2005.
Krasimir Kostadinov: 41. yeah 40ish 41 yeah yeah and i was hoping i hope one day i will meet him and beat him and i never thought that we would meet twice 10 years later yeah yeah oh yeah and we might be together another 10 years who knows yeah so when you dreamed that 2005 now is 18 years since then huh
Engin Terzi: Yeah, John, first time I saw him, do you know where he was? You remember you beat Pushkar in Manchester Supermatch after WAP? All right. Yeah. In that event, Krasimir was like 18 years old and winning the junior category.
Engin Terzi: like i was around there somebody's screaming after every time your music goes up whoa like this with a huge biceps it was crossing me there okay yeah there was an event like the day before right the uh was it the laugh roads that was yeah there was waffles yeah yeah yeah yeah i didn't go to that part i just went to the uh you know the super match afterwards yeah okay okay anyways a crazy match matt mask versus wagner with right arm
John Brzenk: I think that Wagner will press Matt with dead wrist. Yeah. I mean, Matt does have, that's his, that's his weak area is his arm strength, the side pressure. I mean, Matt should have hand control. He's, he's looked really good as a blade. So, I mean, destroyed Ron, which isn't an easy task. So, um, I'm going to lean towards Matt, Matt beating Wagner. And, and crossing his head and,
Engin Terzi: and how about the table reinforcements on the table yeah i i seriously i will have some extra table there like a cowbell or something up there where you can just ring the bell yeah yeah yeah no anyway so next match very good one iraqli versus pauline 95 kilo
John Brzenk: In my eyes, Irakli is the favorite. Paul, believe it or not, is not easy to top roll. I think that Irakli is going to have a hard time with Paul. And I think Paul's arm strength is better than Irakli. If it gets turned down wrist to wrist or if he's able to maintain his wrist, I see the arms going to Paul's side of the table. But you're right. It's a super, super close match.
John Brzenk: Um, I, I worry that Reckley might not have the arm strength to finish Paul, even if he gets the hand advantage, it'll be a good one. Paul keeps getting stronger. I mean, talk to Hutchings about Paul Linn. You know what I mean? He's, he might be, you know, he might be the favorite. He's very explosive. He start the one that is scary me. You know what I'm saying? That, that, that, that, that, that starts to, to do what he did to Samushia. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: He's got a lot of arm strength. Yeah, he has, yeah. The wrist copying and the dragging is very, very strong, yeah. Yeah, I think he versus Krasimir would be also a good match.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, yeah. It depends what the weight is. If it's 95, 100 kilos, yeah. If 95 kilos, Paul may be favorite. If it is 105 kilos... It'd be a little tougher for him. Because whenever Kras is going down 95, he says that with right arm, he is losing some performance. I think because he's doing power match. With left arm, he says he doesn't lose so much because he is more like technical. Correct? Do I remember correct? Yes, yes, yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Engin Terzi: And so let's see what will happen there. And then Tutberidze versus Oleg Zhokh. 85 kilo world title match. Tutberidze is the world champion, WAF world champion, only 19 years old. He dominated everyone. John probably doesn't know him. And Oleg Zhokh won 80 kilo, Tutberidze won 85 kilo. And any...
Engin Terzi: idea, any opinion, prediction.
John Brzenk: Depends on how much Oleg's progressed. I mean, since his accident, which is how many years now? I mean, I don't know. He's seemingly getting better and stronger, right? Five years, yeah. I mean, it just depends on how much he's healed up and progressed. So you are saying that if Zog is in good shape, nobody can catch him? Yeah, if he's anywhere near what he used to be, it's hard for anybody to beat him. But I will tell you something, John. Like, 2015...
Engin Terzi: In the WAP wars, I flash-pinned Mazgan Shamiev. I won the wars. Mazgan took force after me. Only 40 days later, Mazgan flash-pinned Oleg Dzok at Zlotyser. And in 2018, I think, Moldova event, Oleg Dzok beat Pushkar. But some before that one, or no, no, a few weeks, no, one month after that one, Lem and Dimitrov,
Engin Terzi: really gave him a hard time in his category to joke. You remember at the Wofford, you watched that crossfitting? They were like this, like this, and then Oleg couldn't go, his wrist was going. So I'm just saying that in his category, there has been times that Oleg was challenged.
John Brzenk: yeah no yeah but it's hard to get a hold of him maybe if you've got the technique and the style to to to commit to hooking him or getting hold of his arm he's i think he's you know definitely beautiful but you know gripping him hand to hand that monster you know palm that he has it's very awkward to apply your your best your best pressure
Krasimir Kostadinov: And you watch this guy, right? In my eyes, Jock is the huge favorite. I would be very surprised if this young guy, he's super strong. He's super strong. But in the straps, I don't see him controlling Jock's hand. Especially if you are going outside, it's even harder, right? Yes. I understand. But you never know. You never know.
Krasimir Kostadinov: and another one i can see something that when i watched the king of the table just the last one i was ready to bet my house that once will destroy the the guy from russia valera yeah yeah yeah yeah but the guy was really strong i was 100 sure that once you beat him very easy yeah it was
Krasimir Kostadinov: surprising i resisted a lot yeah yeah because when i saw the training videos of valera versus and other guys i was thinking this guy is is huge but he doesn't even know how to pull and when he appeared there he pulled super professional i was super surprised to see that i couldn't believe my eyes what i'm seeing
Engin Terzi: Yeah, John has to go and catch a flight. So let's go last six matches or seven matches. Prokopcik versus Mindaugas, John. Who?
Engin Terzi: You know, Daniel Prokopchuk from Moldova against Mindaugas Tarasaitis, you know. The best arm wrestler in the world. Yeah, yeah. He is really good arm wrestler. I'll never vote against Daniel. I mean, Daniel is just, I mean, I think he should be pulling super heavyweights. I think like this, if Daniel beat Mindaugas four times, Mindaugas beat him two times. You know, they both have wins against each other.
John Brzenk: Okay. Yeah.
John Brzenk: I mean, but you are saying that Daniel is the favorites. I think so. Right. I mean, I just because I well, I only have experience with pulling with Daniel. And yeah, I mean, the little bit that I have pulled with him, I can barely beat him. So I can't imagine anybody his own. You know when it was, you know, it is like one month before one month before your return after five years break. Yeah. In Romania. Yeah. I pulled with him quite a bit. I was like, well,
Engin Terzi: Yeah, yeah, but you were still like five years away from Armas when you trained with him. Still, yeah. And Krasimir? In my eyes, Daniel is the favorite, but I can see it going either way. Either way, okay, okay. And Samushia versus Vladimir Maiorov, this is only I'm going to ask you, Krasimir, because you probably wouldn't know Vladimir Maiorov. No. I don't know how good Vladimir is right now.
Krasimir Kostadinov: Five years ago, he was super solid in hook. I heard that he recently beat Sandris at the Swiss Open in the overalls. This is what they say. If he's that guy, then Maiorov is the favorite in my eyes. Artem you serious? So if he's as good as his 2018 Moldova shape, then he has a good chance of beating? Yes, yes. Or it will be very close.
Engin Terzi: very close yeah i'm telling you i think possibly this will be one of the toughest match of samushia in this category but if he's not that good samushia will destroy him i don't know he looked good you know recently okay reno matic versus ivan matushenko oh see krasimir is the perfect person to talk about i can say this if reno tries top pro
Engin Terzi: or press against Ivan, he will lose. If he tries to stop him here on his biceps, then he may win the match. Okay, so he needs to, instead of his classic style, he needs to catch Ivan and then stop him on his bicep. Not tricep, not top row? Yes, exactly. Do you know Rino Macic, John?
John Brzenk: But I think Matyushenko is probably, in my eyes, from what I've seen in the last couple of times, in line to pull Devin. I mean, I just, I don't see, I mean, he's just mowing through people pretty effortlessly. So I don't know. I mean. Yeah. Rino is the current 242 world champion. Oh, he is? He's what? He's current world champion of WAF. And he beats Andris. And.
Engin Terzi: maybe does he have any win against you krasimir once maybe in the on the left yes yes on the left hand yeah yeah yeah and he's and he is 19 years old
Engin Terzi: he's 19 years old yeah yeah you never know what what that yeah what okay then the next match match is john bersing versus krasimir i'm not going to ask this one because because these guys are going to ignore me no need to spend time okay now last three matches good ones very very all of them are good for these ones alicia murado versus prudnik left arm
Engin Terzi: You know Alizhan, right, John? Yes, yes, yes. He's the one that beat... Cody, Cody Merritt and Petrenko. And then his last two years, super heavyweight champion, even though he's like a 220. Is he from Kazakhstan? Yeah, yeah, Alizhan, yeah.
John Brzenk: It seems like, I mean, as impressive as Prudnik's match was against David. Hard to say. War, war, war. I don't know. I'm very curious about what Krasimir thinks. What do you think? Where is your money going, John? My money is staying in my pocket.
Engin Terzi: i don't i yeah i would not know i didn't know who to bet on against in that yeah and you can ask him in my eyes is slightly favorite but not slightly slightly probably it is because he's better arm and like he is depending on more more of his left
Engin Terzi: while Prudnik is very good with left, but he is mainly the right-arm guy. I think Adi Can is more experienced with left compared to Prudnik. The guy is just, John, he's just like 220. I think he was only like 409 or something in 2022 wars. He just can't beat the super heavyweight, Vav. He beat all the super heavyweight guys. And this year he did the same thing again. In his home country, you know, like Vav, he won the supers.
John Brzenk: and then you saw he beat Cody Merritt and then you saw he beat um Petrenko yeah and yeah and then you cannot underestimate prudnik when he beats that again you know yeah no not again we don't have very much information on David because he doesn't he hasn't pulled the whole hell of a lot right but yeah looked really impressive against Iraq so if his left is as good as his right
Krasimir Kostadinov: You remember, he was 3-0 against Morozov in a super match. Morozov came back and beat him 4-3. Actually, in that match, David was way better, way stronger than Morozov. Morozov was cheating him so much on the grip. I don't like the way he beat him. Okay. Another conversation that we don't have time, but we can talk.
Engin Terzi: about it so what do you think about this man you say it's like religion is favorite and anything else you want to add about this match no i i can see like i can expect anything from this match yeah yeah and john daddy cam versus tatashins
John Brzenk: Got to count on David's got to pull him like Prudnik calls him. He has to flash pin him. I think he has the ability possibly to, because his flexor, his cup is world-class good. If he does exactly everything right and he's got a flash pin, Todd. If Todd stops a match, especially if they're in the straps, then I think Todd will win.
John Brzenk: If the first match goes to Todd's side of the table, which is not impossible, then Todd easy. But I think David has got formidable chances, and he's quick enough, and he knows where to pull. But he's not going to outlast Todd. If it becomes a war, if it stops anywhere. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: I don't know who can outlast Todd. I have no idea. In an equal match, I don't know. Maybe Devon. If they are in the same category, if Devon is heavier, then of course it's not even a match. Do you think that 231 Devon, 231 Todd, do you think that Todd can do something?
John Brzenk: I don't think it needs to be set up for sure I mean the way he took Devin down to the pad in many eyes uh was a pin and oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah but is there one the same day when you know yeah but either is Todd okay so Todd is you think now is that his strongest I think he's well time will tell but I think Hutchings is
John Brzenk: You know, he should be pulling the very, very best, Devin included. I mean, he'll prove himself, I think, in the near future that he can pull with the top, top guys. You mean talking about the heavier guys or in his category? Yeah, no, I would love to see Hutchings against Saplinkov. Oh, okay. Yeah.
Krasimir Kostadinov: I remember John saying this 10 years ago that he would love to see Hutchings vs. Tsiplenkov and back then the people were laughing but I was totally agree and I'm agree right now also.
John Brzenk: Listen, 10 years ago, it was something to laugh about. Yeah. Come on. 10 years ago, Dennis Sipenko would just... Well, Todd wasn't that much weaker than he is, but he's learned how to secure and position his hand way better in the strap than he did 10 years ago. Yeah, he would pull from really weird positions. He'd let his hand... You're talking about Dennis, right? You're talking about 10 years ago, Dennis. 10 years ago, Dennis is...
Engin Terzi: I mean, that then is like, you remember the match he had with Arsene Lille? Arsene, he didn't, he was just like, you know. Yeah.
Krasimir Kostadinov: Yeah, but the third match with the straps was not that convincingly, the third match. The first two matches, yes, he just stonewalled him. But the third match, he had some problems. Maybe he didn't hit him as hard as... I asked Arsene, Arsene said that all three matches was three seconds. He said next day, he felt like whole his body, like a bus hit him. This is what Arsene told me.
Engin Terzi: But I'm not sure how the match would go if all the three rounds were in the straps. I kind of think that Dennis had mercy on him, you know, after the two rounds, you know, I think. I mean, this is what Arsene says. Arsene says that that Dennis, that he's the strongest ever, except Levan. This is what Arsene told me. I don't know. So if we come back to the subject, Tadejian versus Tadjian,
Krasimir Kostadinov: I totally agree with John. If the Deccan is able to flash pin him, then he may win the match. But if the match stops somewhere, then it's all the way Todd. And what is the possibility that, you know, he can do that flash pin, in your opinion? Actually, he has the chance to do this. I don't know. With or without Sepp? Both. Both, okay.
Engin Terzi: I mean, for me, without the strap is more possible to control Todd. David Todd go to strap? He couldn't manage to go to strap with Prudnik, right? They were in the straps. They were in the straps. You sure? Yes. Yes. I'm sure. I'm sure. Prudnik versus Hutchings? Yes. I was surprised how easily Prudnik top-rolled Hutchings with the straps.
John Brzenk: hmm it takes a pretty confident commitment to try to contain hutchins now without you know without the strap you can easily get your hand
John Brzenk: opened up. Of course, Todd doesn't have the hand pressure to make it, you know, where he's going to control his opponent. So it's going to turn into a slip. But yeah, it doesn't feel very good to try to control Todd when he's loading back and knuckles high like he's doing lately. And Gil, I want to ask you, you said that round one, it was not strapped. Round two wasn't strapped.
Engin Terzi: Oh, round three strap. The last round. Yes. But still, he beats him so easy in the step. I don't know how he can do that. Me too. Me too. Wow. What were you saying, Krasimir? Sorry about it. I was taking this video. You said that Denis Diplenkov 10 years ago, in your eyes, is way stronger than this Denis that pulled Devon right now? Yeah, because the guy had this side pressure. He had it.
Engin Terzi: Right now, he's only going this way with the downside, ulna side of his hand. He doesn't have any side pressure. He cannot even... I disagree on that. I disagree on that. I mean, you disagree that Dennis has side pressure this way. Now he's the same guy. The guy that I see over-pronated and then...
Engin Terzi: don't even have any movement direct to the pad, you know, before he was holding and, you know. Listen, back then, when he was pulling Andrei Pushkar, he was never able to hook Andrei Pushkar. Listen, he was never able to. It's a different thing than he didn't have power. Right now, even with the weakest guy, you look at his training videos, he's pronating. He doesn't have. Just because he couldn't do that to Pushkar, it doesn't mean that he didn't have. I can show you 300 matches that he could just...
Engin Terzi: do this to many, many strong guys. Pushkar was like an extreme example, you know.
John Brzenk: But you name the year, he's struggled with Michael Todd. He struggled with Dave Cheney. Who didn't struggle with Michael Todd? He wasn't like so dumb. I can name a lot of points 10 years ago where he was like, yeah, that could have went either way. Evgeny when he pulled Michael, it was like many years of break. It was his return match, you know, just like in 2013.
Engin Terzi: yeah yeah yeah he was 2016 or 17 or something you know he was yeah no no no no no no no no no i talked about 2013 you know 2013 when i talked about arson there can't be like this little small window where he was like super incredible yeah yeah yeah i'm talking about that time you know this is exactly what arson pointed as well you know yeah
Engin Terzi: Yeah, but right now, even in his training, he is not doing that. I remember people doing two hands. He had this side pressure. I see that now, even if he top rolls someone, he's still struggling. Back then, when you say that he was the best, he had training with Ivan Matyushenko on the left and they were having war.
Engin Terzi: It was in 2013. Yes, it was 2012 or 13. I will tell you something. Maybe I'm sure you know this better than I do.
Engin Terzi: Matyushenko is the same guy all year round. Denis is a different guy off time and on time. I can tell you privately explain everything, the difference, but I'm sure that you would know this better. Yeah, but still, I don't think that Denis was way better back then. Because there were a few guys that were giving interviews in Russian.
Engin Terzi: before his match with Devon and all of them said that he's about the same Dennis if not the same very close to what he was listen the guy one Dennis is 140 kilo the other Dennis is 130 kilo one with the 60 something bicep the other one I measured 50 something 10 something you won't be on the bicep size difference I'm not saying that it's all about the bicep but I'm sure that he is not the same strong guy you know I mean I have no doubt it's the same guy
Engin Terzi: I mean I mean it doesn't completely equate to being a better arm wrestler I mean we all know that yeah but Dennis has never been so great because he was just so super technical including today you know he's holding from here and trying to grenade you know he doesn't even use the riser or it really like you don't hold someone from his wrist and try to go outside you know you do a little
Engin Terzi: higher, you know. So he still has the grip of the low grip and side pressure, the same grip, but he is doing
Engin Terzi: outside with that low grip you know i mean i listen this this is the wrist joint that you try to take if you apply the pressure here i mean it will be less effective you need to apply your pressure as far as possible to the somebody's hand so that's you need to have a little bit higher grip so you go higher if you hold like this then with your thumb you're applying pressure to the middle of the uh middle of the it's not always the case again it's not always the case
Engin Terzi: is you and i we can talk about hook and i will listen to you forever if we are talking about pronation please yeah but the thing is sometimes yeah there are guys that who are pulling like this they they grab very low and they depend no no no but they they have they have the tall forearm they do this but they do
Engin Terzi: low hand top of like like Vitaly but that that is that is most of the time against the uh hook pullers you know most of the times you know you don't you don't really if the board top roll except knowledge you don't see many guys that is just really like dropping their hand like this especially if you are pulling against Devon which is almost like 10 10 centimeter taller than uh Dennis you know I mean you don't want to hold him low
Engin Terzi: you saw that with low grip they will hit the cup in you anyway so i agree i agree i agree honestly or you just want to finish no no no yeah you're right you're right about this the thing is that uh it depends if your opponent is going to hook you or to top roll you
Engin Terzi: yeah yeah because if my opponent is going hook i also do a little bit to his little finger i i drop it and then put that because the guy can just go around my hand so i keep it a little bit far but if the guy is toppling i try not to drop this i i actually rise up you know yeah anyway so morozov versus kurdecha
Engin Terzi: I think it's mismatch. Yeah, we haven't seen Alex for two years. I mean, who knows where Alex is at, right? I don't know. Evgeny if he's in his best form, that's a tough match for him, right? His left arm, it is said that better than his right. And he is now over 360 pounds, 160 kilo. And he is, you know, no fat at all. He's just like...
Engin Terzi: You know, and he is almost as tall as Larrattin. And we will see, we will see Morozov. I'm not sure if Morozov can go outside with him, but I would like to hear what Krasimir is saying. Krasimir looks like he has something to say. I'm sure that if Morozov will try to hook him, he will hook him and beat him very easy. Hook him, but top row is hard, right? If he tries to top row him, he may lose the match.
Krasimir Kostadinov: Yeah, do you remember when he tried to top roll Tobias, he lost his wrist and then he hold him low and then did little bit supinated grip and hook him and beat him here. If Morozov tries the first round to top roll and loses the wrist and continue to pull with dead wrist, then he may lose the match. But if he tried to hook him right after the goal, I'm sure he would win.
Engin Terzi: Both of these guys have been in hiding for at least a year, two years. I mean, who knows what kind of shape they're going to come in. The last time Morozov pulled left arm, it was like last June. He pulled against Corey West. And he had very dominant performance against Corey West, yeah, left arm. But he was getting ready for Levan with right arm, super match.
Engin Terzi: and so he was in incredible shape so he was getting ready for his right but of course when he trained his left yeah so we will see the winner of this match will face vitality yeah yeah and then before we finish the last one leon versus devon i want to ask john and then i want to go with uh but one second before that classy devon said that you are incredible at chess game is that true
Krasimir Kostadinov: I used to play a lot about I was playing five years every day about two three hours a day so I mean here in our club in the town so I know I know a lot of theory in the chess if you don't if you don't know theory you like it's pulling on the table without technique like pushing like this
Engin Terzi: I asked Devon, Devon said that like Devon is good about it, but he said that in the community, he said that you are the best that he knows, you know, he said he cannot do anything against you. Yes, because he doesn't know theory. Okay. And one more thing I would ask, do you know how to play the Street Fighter type of games? I have played when I was a kid.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, because we need someone to play against them, and every time he comes here, he beats everyone, and he gets up during the bunk and he's like, anyone, anyone? Bring a six-year-old and a ringer that's a little kid that just crushes him. Yeah. Just, yeah, we need someone. Next time when I do the VIP offer, I will just say that, like, you need to know highest level of the Street Fighter, you know, game, you know what I mean?
John Brzenk: Okay, John, does Devon have a chance against Levon this time? Absolutely. I mean, Levon has hurt a little bit. We don't know if he's fully recovered or can ever be fully recovered. And Devon has obviously proven that he's improved a lot. I think he believes that he can beat him, and that's all you need. I think he's...
John Brzenk: Yeah, I think, I mean, it's a possibility that that match could have went completely different the first time they met. So, yes, I think he's got a definitely a strong chance and he's definitely proven himself to be in line, right? Who's better? Who's better to go against? I asked Levon, I said, do you think that Devon improved? He said he doesn't think so, like maybe a little. This is what he said, because he said that before his match,
Engin Terzi: He said, Engin, look at his performance against Michael Todd in a Supermatch in Dubai. He said he was already, you know, very, very good. And he said, you know, Engin, he was already very good. He doesn't think that he improved a lot. But is that your opinion as well?
John Brzenk: My personal experience, he has definitely improved a lot from what I pulled him a year and a half, two years ago to just recently, seven, eight months ago. Night and day. I mean, I didn't even have to pull him. Just gripping up onto his hand, you can tell right away. Like, what the? I mean, it's just he's a completely different person. Wow. Yeah. And you, Krasimir? I think that he has chance. I think that he has chance.
John Brzenk: He needs to stop him, right? Somehow stop him. And what does he need, Krasimir? What does he need to stop him? A little bit more back pressure. More back pressure. I mean, Levan's got probably the strongest cupping in the game, right? That crushing ability to do this. He can't, if someone can stop that from happening, Devin's going to...
Engin Terzi: before his injury, he was able to curl 100 kilos for wrist lift. That was amazing. I would like to talk with you because you like to analyze the things. The reason, the only reason that Hermes was able to stop Levan was his back pressure. Levan couldn't, like Levan didn't lose his wrist, but he couldn't control
Engin Terzi: So he went this way, he took the hand and wrist, but he couldn't really control the arm, you know. That is why Hermes started with the back pressure, back pressure, lost his wrist, and after he stopped and then he did the transition to here. If you realize that round three, when he stopped Levan and he was almost winning and Levan fouled,
Engin Terzi: And then second start, Hermes wanted to go directly there. He got flash pinned because this time Levan was able to use his cupping because he didn't start with the back pressure. So you need to kind of unable Levan's cupping
Krasimir Kostadinov: to stop him, more back pressure. The most dangerous pullers for those hand-dominant guys, those couple of guys, are the Travis, high knuckles, posting pullers. But the thing is that that huge back pressure from Hermes didn't take Levan's hand. He didn't take, but he couldn't control the pronator either. He couldn't manage this.
Engin Terzi: He controlled everything here. Just Levan's side pressure. His side pressure was not enough to finish the match. This is my opinion. I think that his wrist isn't handled. But look at the match. He didn't lose the wrist, but he didn't have popping like this. His wrist was flat. He wasn't able to turn him completely upright, right? Yeah, no, no, he couldn't. He couldn't. He had the pronator still. He had the pronator.
Engin Terzi: he couldn't because i saw he hit sideways and his wrist was stopped so and then he went out again but again levan was he had the control here he took hermes wrist but taking the wrist is not about the the the having the pressure like taking your hand is about your own pronator and back pressure but controlling hermes pronator is something different it's not it's nothing to do with
Engin Terzi: your pronation this is this is about the risk he couldn't like if he would do this listen like round three watch it he started the second start with direct flop instead of the back pressure as that's true but in my eyes
Engin Terzi: why the problem why levan couldn't finish that match was lacking of side pressure not lacking chris i think i think the guy has incredible pressure but he's listen this is very very hard to beat someone without like controlling the pronator with side pressure either you need to go that way like you need to control here that that luck here i i agree i disagree do you think dennis has a chance against levan dennis
Engin Terzi: with with um I mean not that not the dentist that we saw in Istanbul pulling against Devon no not not that one not that one but a little bit more stronger a little bit more like cup you know like at least he wouldn't lose his wrist so much uh but I will I saw something I think that he has chance
John Brzenk: I think that Dennis has a chance. I think Dennis might have a better chance than even Devin. And Devin dominated Dennis. But that's just because of the style. I agree. I agree on that. I don't agree. Not the one in Istanbul. One year later, improve more. You're using Hermes as a gauge. I think Dennis' style is similar to Hermes with that back pressure and that he's got enough side pressure that it might... Yeah, but just remember one thing. Hermes...
Engin Terzi: like couldn't do anything if he didn't have this i'm not sure if if like like if dennis is like this i don't think he's gonna put his shoulder and then do this like like i am i don't see him doing that like but listen dennis has better pronation than hermes hermes has very strong back pressure interest but his pronation is not that solid as dennis yeah
Engin Terzi: Yeah, that is something that, you know, because, like, in my opinion, Devon had a harder time against Dennis than he had against Hermes. Yes, he has. Yeah, his arm is for sure, but does he have the pressure to do that? Also... The thing is that he has this, he has the pronation, and when he has the pronation, he may go like this. Yeah, but once he lost his wrist,
Engin Terzi: his pronation didn't really help him. Once Devon went this way and took everything. I kind of think that Levon is gonna just take his risk like,
Krasimir Kostadinov: easy like okay he will take his wrist easy but levan doesn't have this doesn't have this devon has it they won't get i i think that the levan's arm is much stronger than uh devon's and his pressure to do here is i think it's not about the arm it's about the chest it's about this move
Engin Terzi: Yeah, but you know, whenever you're stretching down, you're pulling something with your arm as well, you know, but yeah, but I just don't see Dennis having this to finish Levan, but I don't know. We will see. All these matches, we will see. And like Hermes and Dennis may pull this spring.
Engin Terzi: that many people think that is a mismatch. Hermes is going to destroy Dennis and things like that. But do you guys think that way? I don't know. It would be a good match. Good match, yeah. I believe so. I believe so. If Dennis is like 5%, 10% better, everything can be changed. Anyway, so guys, John has time, doesn't have time. He needs to go to airport. Thank you very much. And I kept you extra 24 minutes. Very sorry. No, no, no.
Engin Terzi: thank you very much and take thank you classy you and i we should sit down and talk like hours and hours and hours and hours john is tired of our message john john is tired okay take care see you soon yeah good christmas christmas take care and thank you guys for watching classy don't forget her we're gonna sit down and talk about you i am devil we're gonna
Krasimir Kostadinov: Let me tell you something about Levan, why he couldn't finish the match. What I'm explaining is that he lacked this power and you may be offended, but I believe you have the same problem. You don't have this. Baba, that is not because of that.
Engin Terzi: It is because overpronation, listen, if whenever I do this, my problem is not this. My problem is looking that way. It is because my pronator, like the radial side pressure, is so much stronger than the downside of my hand. You know, your downside of hand and this bottom two finger is this downside of here, pressure here. And this wrist tendon is all about controlling the opponent's arm.
Engin Terzi: And here is all about the head. So because of my injury here, I cannot really apply pressure with it. Like this side, this inner side, I cannot. So I will tell you, no, no, I know myself. Like whenever I train supination and pronation, it is, you will not believe, but three times stronger is this top side. So whenever I do the full pressure, this here is not catching up with here. Like three times more power is coming. Whenever I give all my power, it is over pronating.
Engin Terzi: And they're missing the arm here. What I need to do, I need to control here and beat the guy. Once you, you know, only the hand is not enough. Once I have here, everything is changing. I'm becoming like a double stroke. Trust me.
Engin Terzi: i agree but it's because not of the arm it's because of the chest it's like this power this strength not the arm power my friend as long as you don't control the opponent's arm you only pronate like this you're missing the arm the guy like the same like like ongar wave did it john did it everyone did it but they didn't control todd's arm they went here
Engin Terzi: they had the hand and wrist you cannot go because you don't stop you don't really lock you know here you need to turn here either with the wrist or either with the downside of your pressure and here you need to apply pressure we are talking about different things i'm talking about and you against john for example yeah i believe the cases are similar
Krasimir Kostadinov: You both had the hand control, but this is... You're talking about my match with John, the second round? For example, yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. For example, when I pull Sasho, it's the same. He's going like this. He takes my hand. Sasho is super strong here, but he's strong here. He doesn't have here. Here.
Engin Terzi: I don't believe that. I believe that. Listen, you say you beat him like this. Just imagine that, you know, him having a cup over your pronator and you are like this. You are not going to beat him like this. I beat him like this. I beat him like that. I mean, listen, listen. If you are like this, I mean, this is very hard, you know, if you lose the wrist and the pronator. This is very hard. But if you have this pronator, I know that you use your pronator. Yes. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: I mean, listen, listen, here, look at, where is my tricep working now? The winning side. Where is my tricep working now? To the losing side. If I want to, if my palm is turned up, if I want to use my tricep, I need to make myself losing. Here, winning.
Engin Terzi: I agree. I agree with that. I just say that Levan needed more side pressure to win the match, not wrist. Listen, to apply the side pressure. Listen, there are some type of people like, for example, I got caught. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's good. It's good. Like, like touching touching style of side pressure. He doesn't need wrist. But people like the one
Engin Terzi: People like me, we are so much dependent on the hand control. It's because you guys don't have this. It's because you guys don't have this. That's why. No, it is because if we have here, we win. If you cannot turn here, you lose. It's all about controlling the pronator. But there are some people like, do you remember Bill Sinks? You don't know him, right?
Engin Terzi: From the head, like he had like this, he could just push like this, you know, side pressure. Me, I cannot do that. I need to have wrist. Levan is the same. Levan cannot pull this way. Yes, I agree. I agree on that. But in my eyes, you just need a little bit more
Krasimir Kostadinov: of this not more of this if you add more on this if you make the same business not only this but not only this but also listen um
Engin Terzi: You see here, this side of the hand, whenever I press it, if it is not strong enough, and if it is going like this, you understand? Your arm is overpronated because this doesn't catch up with the pronation. If here is 120 kilo, if it is 40 kilo, whenever I give all my power, I'm dominating the hand, even if I don't want, but here is not coming together. So I need to press with the downside here to the side.
Engin Terzi: Yes, you need this. You need your side pressure. Yeah, yeah, yeah, but listen, not only the chest, your forearm needs to, if your forearm is not staying here, because this, I think you cannot imagine this because your supinator is incredibly powerful that if you ever lack, you are lacking from the chest. But for me, I mean, I cannot really do this pressure if my forearm, the supination side is injured and I cannot apply, if it is going like, I go, it goes like this.
Engin Terzi: But once I'm healthy, if I control here, like I remember whenever I was playing with Mindaugas, even I beat him supermatch, my arm was going like this. But I had this like a training with him. But at that time, my spinator side, this side, the ulna side was very strong. So I put the pressure here. Whenever I pressed, it was... Exactly. Back then, you had better side pressure. No, no, no, no. It's the same side pressure. The forearm is not...
Engin Terzi: listen even you have chest the appliers all the pressure is not chest the applier on the arm your forearm your forearm like listen if i have super chest power but not strong pronator i will hit my arm will be because pronator is turning so what i just said if you have super strong chest
Engin Terzi: you go like this if the if the guy turns your pronator like this like look at pat hashing says the same pressure all the time whenever he put prudnik prudnik control his pronator he couldn't do anything like this but whenever people cannot control his pronator and they overpronate like iraqi did like john did like ongarbev did they couldn't control his pronator and he was able to boom boom boom but once you turn him here he goes
Engin Terzi: his arm stays there anyways you have your own opinion i am mine but it's good i respect you so much okay same here yeah thank you and see you in a few weeks i love i love chatting with you because that is always good you know even you don't agree each other you still learn something yes yes yes yeah yeah and is it still same in bulgaria when you say yes you do this and when you say no you do this
Krasimir Kostadinov: Actually, I don't use this in Bulgaria. I use yes and no. Yeah, but in the past people told me that, you know, when you say like this means no in Bulgaria. We use this no and yes. Oh, this is yes. When it's no and yes.
Engin Terzi: yeah there is there is a there is a super chat that i i don't want to be disrespectful and before i close and read that um sorry sean yeah you know sean right close friend or mad mask sean crowther i think so yes yeah
Engin Terzi: Hello Sean Thank you, he says you, you to need to debate techniques more often, this is awesome to watch you guys are teaching people so much right now yeah that that is how it is, you know, like you get both in the you discuss who cares, you know, like I mean it is not about ego satisfaction or something we enjoy I enjoy at least to discuss with you. yeah Thank you class to me.
Engin Terzi: are a legend you are a legend and i see that you are doing very well very well lately and i hope you will be going more up i cannot say anything about john match the organizer and i don't even support my own self against john um but it's good that you catch the round too about john john also told me that he couldn't go uh but i i didn't have but listen if you're not only side pressure it's also reached as well
Krasimir Kostadinov: like i was barely holding him barely barely holding him if if i would go more i would lose the risk you know i was like barely staying there yeah but listen now i agree on that yeah but your wrist was stronger than his and in your in your mind you think oh i need i needed a little bit more risk a little bit more risk but in my mind when i watched the match from the side i am thinking and gin was stronger here he just needed a little bit more here
Engin Terzi: yeah yeah more there but do you know what happens just i will tell you i hold here and do more this i will be like this no no no no yes yes i know i couldn't even move that's all i did i hit with the roll and you know people think that john was playing with me and john told me that he had very hard time he thought that whenever i hit him the roll he thought that i was gonna flash him you know um
Krasimir Kostadinov: But that pressure that you say is about the chest, trust me, Krasimir, do you know what it's about? It's about the elbow joint. It's not solid anymore. It really hurts. I cannot do pressure that even my 15-year-old junior student is doing the pressure. I don't know what's the case, but this is what I see that you're lacking. And Levan was lacking in my eyes too. Not the wrist. He had the better wrist against Emre's. Just he needed a little bit more side pressure to win the match.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, but him having better wrist than Hermes is not the case. Him controlling is not wrist versus wrist because he already took the wrist. Yes, yes. What was stopping him was this pronator and arm strength back here. Yes, but to overcome that pronator, you may overcome that pronator with extra side pressure as well. So...
Engin Terzi: yeah some people some people can apply the pressure if they don't have the cup but some people are like me really depending on the cup like todd hutchins he doesn't care so much about that but he just overcome with this
Engin Terzi: I understand, but he can pull without the wrist, you know. For example, on Galbaev, he also has very strong this side pressure. He doesn't care so much about the cup. He just uses his pronator and this side pressure. Yeah, but do you realize that you said you have very good, he has, but because he couldn't control Paz's pronator, he hit, he stopped somewhere, he couldn't go. But if he could have this, like Prudnik had it,
Krasimir Kostadinov: He would go. But the same thing I can say. If he hit a little bit more here, he would be able to finish the match. It didn't look like a little bit. Because if it was a little bit, as soon as he took Todd here, Todd was like...
Engin Terzi: boom again here like he couldn't even stay there like he would only like a one search he come there hey hey one hour ago you said that it was close match and it was a war and now you say no no no no no no no no no when i said close match just remember i said here he was holding him it was a war i said he could hold him here more but i said whenever he went tried to win it didn't seem like you know he had a chance to win i never said that
Engin Terzi: Ongar Bayev was close to win, but the match was a war, but Todd had the control. Ongar Bayev was struggling not to lose the match, but it was close because Todd could have also beat him. But I didn't see Todd in any danger, like almost losing or something. Yes, but if Ongar Bayev had a little bit more extra side pressure,
Engin Terzi: If it was about the side pressure, I will disprove you there. If it was about the side pressure, whenever he had the wrist, whenever he had the wrist, from here to here, he hit so good, as you said. But once he go and then he lost his wrist, he was stopped. Just look at the match again. Once he hits, he has cup here. Once he hits, he's losing his cup, you know, because no control over thoughts.
Krasimir Kostadinov: just watch the match again up here whenever he is he loses the cup you know do you know why we we see the things differently because you are used to control here to control here and if you don't have this control most of the times you lose and me i'm used to control the match here and i know
Krasimir Kostadinov: from experience that even if I lose here, if I control here, I don't care about this. I can finish it this way. It depends who the opponent is. It depends. I would like to see you and Todd Hutchings like this. I would love to see. It may happen. Okay. See you. See you soon. Yeah, okay. But one last thing.
Engin Terzi: You were talking about 90 kilo engine and John was near 240, 110 kilo. So you're asking too much. It's not regular, guys. Take care. Take care, guys.
