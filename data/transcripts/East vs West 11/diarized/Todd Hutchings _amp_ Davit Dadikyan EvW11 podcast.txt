Engin Terzi: to do his comeback. It'll be interesting. He's got a big mountain to climb in April. Yeah, yeah, we'll see. Listen, I think he's able to do things like that. With his base and knowledge, he's very much able. We've been practicing together a couple of times and his strength is untrained, but everything else is still there. Yeah.
Pavel: Hello guys. Hi Engin. Hello. How is everything? Doing well. That's great, that's great. Waiting for David to come and then we are already live. And so you're gonna pull Travis, huh, Paolo?
Engin Terzi: uh yeah sure well this is not like an official match right now not training right yeah i mean it's uh it's a tournament so yeah yeah we'll pull today yeah arkham will be there travis will be there uh brian wegener uh coming uh kent the mori coming i mean i didn't see him pulling for real for ages we'll see what where we're here
Pavel: We will have some fun. Yep. Okay, so I think he's going to join us soon and then we can start. So how is everything, Todd? Your shape is good? It's getting better every day.
Pavel: Mm-hmm. So what do you expect? Same as the last event or even better or may not be the same? How is it? Well, it's a different puzzle to figure out. But, you know, I don't know if I can hope on winning every single match, but that's always the plan. I mean, it depends, you know. If you are, like, in good shape, then we don't see why not, you know.
Pavel: I mean, if you are in good shape, then it looks like you are at the top of the category. You have the title, you beat Ongar Bayev. Ongar Bayev had a lot of matches out there to look at, so you're pretty confident about what he's going to do.
Todd Hutchings: I just can't find that many matches of David out there. Most of them are him just sparring and practicing, not even real official referee matches. Yeah, that's true. But I think that when you are unsure about those kind of things, then what you do is just you do what you do best and then hope that it works.
Pavel: yeah that's how it is so your ways and everything like that the only way to measure i think are they like top level you send us some video but i we don't know like how it was before yeah no my my gym lifting is uh i changed it a little bit for him because he'll be a different polar than agrabayo
Todd Hutchings: But the basic workouts are all there and slowly going up. You add weight every couple of weeks anyway. Usually you do a lot of table time. It's still the case? Yeah, I'm on the table probably twice a week, sometimes three. I'll be on the table three times this week. Yeah.
Todd Hutchings: do you expect okay how do you see the difference between as far as you can you know judge he's got that that funny dennis chafee it's sort of a hook sort of a top role i'm mostly worried about how fast he is so if i can slow the match down and stop it i i like my chances but
Todd Hutchings: A lot of times he's just blindingly fast and those people always give me fits. So I like referee's grips and I like straps and referee's grips when they're really fast. How do you plan to stop this speed with your back pressure? Um, I think so. That's what Dennis does with him. And I'm not saying I can do what Dennis does, but, uh, if I was in the straps for sure with back pressure, um,
Todd Hutchings: What I have to do with Chafee when I pulled Dennis a few times was almost hook into him, but keep my knuckles higher up and try to keep the match away from wrist to wrist and keep it more hand up, you know, hand to hand. So put a little more leverage into his elbow. Yeah, there are super shares already.
Pavel: Todd and Oleg's love child says, Todd and Oleg on the same cards, my favorites, thank you. And Jeremy Coleman says, ask Todd if he will change name from Tozilla to Toddfather, like Godfather, Godfather. Toddfather could be my nickname.
Pavel: And what's Toddzilla, the original name? That could be my real name. I'll pay taxes under Toddzilla and just my friends can call me the Todd Potter. Todd, did I analyze wrong or whenever you pull Ibrahim Sago, first you went a little bit like this way and he kind of caught you. And then did you, did you, did you like,
Todd Hutchings: push your elbow forward and make make your arm vertical in the following matches to make his down pressure you know you know come down yeah my first match with uh with sagov i tried to do more back pressure and he was very close to pushing me off the elbow pad
Todd Hutchings: So I was afraid he'd push me off every time. But at least then I'd felt how much power he had. So every match after that, I just jumped into the center with him, caught it. And I figured if I could stop it. He didn't feel stronger than I did. So I figured if I could stop it, things would go my way. Hello, David. Do you hear us? Oh, hello. Hello, Ingrid.
Engin Terzi: What does he say, Pavel? Yeah, he said that he's already connected. Very good. He can hear us. Say hi to everybody, hi to me. Hello, hello, hello, David. Maybe, David, you turn the phone.
Pavel: So, David, how are you? How is your shape? You healthy?
Engin Terzi: Yes, everything is fine. I finished my training and got up in a hurry to be in time. Everything is fine according to the plan. Everything is fine. He said everything according to the plan. Everything is good. He just finished the training and first came up to connect to us. And how much more weight to lose? How much more weight to lose? There are five left. Four and a half, five.
Pavel: yeah it's four four and a half five kg left oh it's nothing nothing left wow because he had around 10 kilos to lose now only four and a half left here that's that's good yeah total 12 kg oh total so he's going down from 117. yeah
Pavel: Wow. Interesting. Yeah. And David, Pat said that he sees his chances good if he stops you, your speed. And how do you see this match for yourself? How do you find Pat Hutchings, you know, as an opponent? What do you think about him?
Engin Terzi: David, we talked about this before. Tad said, I think my chances are good if I can stop his speed, if I can stop his match. Engin asks, how do you rate Tad's chances as an opponent? He's a great athlete. I respect him a lot.
Davit Dadikyan: Of course, I don't want to put more or less bets, but it's 50-50. So it will be very difficult for me, too, knowing the side of Todd, how he doesn't feel the side movements of all the young guys. So, of course, I'm getting ready. And as for me, and as for him, it will be hard. It will be a hard fight.
Engin Terzi: But I know how strong he is, so I added more strength. If he stops me, I'll try to do something in these corners. David said that Todd Hutchings is an amazing athlete and huge respect to him. And he said that he's getting ready and taking this match very, very serious. He's saying that chances are 50-50 and hard to predict.
Engin Terzi: And he's saying that, yes, if Todd will be able to stop the match, he's getting ready for that too, to be able to try, you know, to do something at the stopped match. Otherwise, very respectful and he believes it's going to be a very hard match for both of them. Okay, so he says that his chances are higher if he can, like with the Clash pin.
Pavel: But just in case if it stops, you know, he still has a plan B to be competitive in that match. He's getting ready for it strength-wise and side pressure, yes. Todd, people were talking about you versus Ongarbe and people were saying that Ongarbe may flash pin you and if Todd can't stop. But it never was the case. You know, the ready go and then the match was like to your winning side and Ongarbe's losing side.
Pavel: Um, do you believe that like when you are strong enough, that speed may not matter or it is, that again is a different type of puller compared to Ongarbayev who is going more outside while David can go directly to the side way with a strong copy. Yeah, I think that again is faster than Ongarbayev to begin with. And I also think he probably starts stronger.
Todd Hutchings: So he's got a little more force when he launches. The one thing that helped me with the Angerbaev match is when you change the ref's ready go to, I think it was like, don't move, then there is a pause and go. So go wasn't such a surprise anymore, you know. So I was able to time it a little easier. So that made things a lot better for me. And I knew where Angerbaev was going because I watched, like,
Todd Hutchings: 40 of his matches you know and out of 40 matches he did the same thing in like 39 of them so i was pretty confident yeah yeah it wasn't there wasn't a lot of surprise with what he was going to do the only the only match of his i saw where he did something odd was when he pulled kardechka and i didn't really count that too much because i wasn't going to feel anything like kardechka to him so i just threw that match out but all the other matches with people about my size
Engin Terzi: Angerbaev did, like, the same thing every time. Okay, maybe you translate that first. David, so Emgen asked Tadej, he said, how do you rate, if you compare your match with Angerbaev's and your upcoming match with Dadikyan? He said, look, they're different athletes. Dadikyan is 100% faster than Angerbaev, first of all.
Engin Terzi: Secondly, it was a bit easier with Angerbaev, and the start was easier, because he's very predictable. I watched, say, 40 matches of Angerbaev on YouTube, and in 39 or 40 he made the same start.
Engin Terzi: That's why I knew what he was going to do with me. When he started in a different way, it was with Alex Kurdecha, but I don't fit his size. He did the same thing with other people of his size, so it was predictable.
Engin Terzi: Judges, when there is no ready-go, but they say don't move, go, it also helped me, because this go is predictable, and I can improve my timing and start on time. Therefore, it all helped me.
Pavel: Thank you. Ready? David, people try to... People say that because Hart put Ongarware directly to the losing position,
Pavel: And people thinking that some people thinking that, you know, that may be the case with you. Do you think that you are different, different than Ongarbe? Because you pull Ongarbe Irakli and Ongarbe pulled Irakli in one of the matches Irakli took Ongarbe down to here and Ongarbe survived from here while you never passed the center to lose inside against Irakli.
Pavel: So do you think that your chances are better against TOT, like about protecting the center for a direct pin? Do you understand what I mean? Yes, absolutely. Let me try. It's a little complicated, but yeah, I completely understand.
Engin Terzi: Okay, so the opinion is that when Tad fought Angerbaev, he never went into a losing position. He always attacked and beat Angerbaev into a losing position. So the first question was, do you think it can happen to you that Tad will...
Engin Terzi: uh uh uh uh
Engin Terzi: from the center and beat you in the losing position. What do you think, how can all these conclusions affect the course of your fight and how do you see the course of your fight?
Davit Dadikyan: Let's start with the fight with Irakli. I think Irakli and Angarbaev both pull up to the top right away. They both have a side movement. I don't think it's very strong. They have the center right away. With Irakli, as it turned out, I pulled a little and immediately to the side, and he just didn't have time to turn.
Davit Dadikyan: He had a lot of pronators, so he couldn't get into his fight. And I think he did the same with Angorbaev. That was my advantage. I just got into the box and finished off Irakli. That's all. How did it happen that the first question was that he was not in a losing position?
Davit Dadikyan: What was the key point? Why is it so? If during the action the judges allow, let's say, we know that the opponent's shoulder hurts, right? If the shoulder is inserted and the hand is in tension all the time and the center is not controlled, it is naturally difficult for the starter to start. Therefore, if the action is correct and the center is set,
Davit Dadikyan: 100%. Angar Baiba, I think, would have been better. Angar, I just saw, right? Any starter starts a little bit with a relaxed hand. And that one held on tight, immediately lateral movement. Therefore, Angar Baiba did not give any chance.
Davit Dadikyan: He started with matches with
Engin Terzi: uh his his match was uh iraqli and he said that because uh of the style of iraqli pulling uh majority of his pulling is a back pressure yeah but but his side is not as strong yeah and he said of the start uh that he can pushed his side off a little bit and twisted his pronator a little bit
Engin Terzi: of the start and that's why iraqi couldn't uh couldn't uh you know uh
Engin Terzi: couldn't put himself in his favorite position. So he was right away off. And in his opinion, that's approximately why Angerbaev was always in a losing position because Todd's style is similar because Todd's side pressure is the king and against any top roller who is always back pressure, back pressurized the most, but not the side.
Engin Terzi: That's why approximately that's what's happening. In his opinion, because the rules are a little bit loose, it's in the favor of the side pressure guys. And he said whoever has a very fast start, they're usually starting with a relaxed arm. And whoever is a side pressure guy, they're usually reset.
Engin Terzi: with the side pressure and stick their shoulder kind of forward. And with that possibility, if the referee missed that point, then it's giving a little bit more
Engin Terzi: little better position to whoever has a side pressure but not that slower start yeah go ahead sorry and about and about his uh uh match restart uh future match he said you know what it's it's a little bit unpredictable we will see because todd is a amazing athlete and their styles are kind of similar and he said yeah that's that's that's i cannot predict it but we will see
Pavel: I mean, I personally don't find their style similar. While Dadikyan is like so much based on the hand wrist, while Todd is just more like using the pronated side pressure. Like he is kind of not focused on controlling the guy.
Pavel: but he is like okay you pull me okay that's good you know so I pull you from here and then we are now in equal position let's see where's the better side pressure and then he's he's like he doesn't mean I mean you're trying to top roll Todd in my opinion is like a like but you are falling into trap you know because like you need to control here while you're getting far from him and kind of missing here you're still holding but you are not attacking to that direction
Pavel: but you are just pulling this way and you are even allowing him more. And he has more, you know, uh, opportunity to press from here because in they, they may be the same position. They may have even a little bit risk. If, if Todd has the pronator, Todd is not gonna lose anyone. Like just my personal opinion under 105 kilo, he has his pronator. You are, you are finished. You know, the only like someone like Prudnik who has.
Pavel: full hand control that can control his pronator that has chance against him but I'm sure that he is still improving and let's see what will happen if they meet again you know I don't know if Todd is gonna go down finally and never meet Krutnik but we will see you know let me translate a little bit for David he knows what we're talking about Engin says that
Engin Terzi: He says that he thinks that your style and Tad Hatch's style are still different, although you both have good side pressure, but he says that they are still different, because you work more on cupping, on twisting the wrist, and he prunes, and his wrist is a little failed, and he fights from everywhere.
Engin Terzi: Todd, what was the part that was failing with Ongarve? Wrists?
Pavel: That was failing on Ongarbaev? Yeah. Ongarbaev was kind of holding you here. He's holding you here. And he locked himself. But once he moved this way, he was able to move to the center. But as far as I saw, his wrist was not really handling your pronation.
Todd Hutchings: I thought as he got tired, I'd be able to put enough back pressure on him that he would fold his wrist back every time he went sideways. But that happened once or twice, and then he always protected his hand. He was amazing with his hand control. He just didn't have enough strength in his elbow compared to my elbow, because I'll give up my hand some.
Todd Hutchings: And if he tried to go sideways and protect his hand, he couldn't generate, you know, enough force, you know, cause he, he could pull me over, but I was never like in danger of, you know, going over center where, you know, shoulder, but, uh, no hunger by his hand is pretty phenomenal. I was, uh, and I expected that because that match he pulled with Michael Todd where he maintained his hand position.
Todd Hutchings: for those very, very long matches. Anger Bayern's got one of the best hands I've ever felt. And I've pulled a lot of super heavyweights. And Anger Bayern's hands up there with the best in the world, you know, at any weight. I mean, that's impressive. You are amazed of his pronator and wrist coordination together like this, controlling here at the same time. His wrist didn't move like this, but more like, you know,
Todd Hutchings: know yeah like this way not not this way there was one match i think it was this i can't remember because we had so many starts but there was one point where he was down where he went and his wrist when he went his wrist came back he immediately came back with a position and then it never folded backwards again the rest of the evening i go i have you and then he protected it
Pavel: yeah yeah yeah but see this one i'm saying that there are some risks that are working into your angle so he is great here but whenever his wrist is going side pressure then it didn't really handle so he had to stop the pressure come back and protect his wrist for that so he he didn't really like he wasn't able to fight with you but how did you rate that match hard match or easy match for you that was it was hard
Todd Hutchings: I mean, you can't go by the score because, you know, we might have been like exactly there just a little bit. But towards the end, we were both like exhausted. I mean, had we pulled, you know, we're pulling anymore. You know why I'm asking this? People says, oh, after I saw...
Pavel: hard like dominating on Garber and I was like like listen listen okay the score is three zero but when you say like dominating probably your domination understanding and my domination understanding is it was a war of course they were not in the danger of losing but to pin him it was like a really really hard you know it was like a big battle you know yeah Prudnik dominated me I did not dominate on your biomes yeah yeah
Engin Terzi: Let me translate real quick, guys. David? Yes, I'm here. David, are you with us? Yes. Well, he asked Tad to analyze his fight with Angorbaev. He asked why Angorbaev didn't have enough wrist to win. He said he was surprised.
Engin Terzi: Because every time Angorbaev tried to attack, he started to lose a little bit of his wrist, he immediately returned back, defended it and took the wrist back under control. What he didn't have enough of was the power in the elbow joints. He couldn't develop as much power as needed to pull Tade back. He says, I'm just much stronger in this movement.
Engin Terzi: I fought a lot of heavyweights and so on, and he was there, at the very top, with a brush. His brush was gorgeous, I was surprised. Then we started analyzing the match a little, and at the end Engin asked, how was the match, was it easy? He said, no, it wasn't easy at all, it was difficult, we were about the same in certain moments.
Engin Terzi: David, do you see your chances?
Davit Dadikyan: Better with or without strap? David, do you think your chances are better with or without straps? I think with straps. If I had a left hand, I would agree without it. Because I control my left hand better. The right hand, since it's a standing hand, I think it would be more comfortable with straps. Well, for me, as I see it.
Engin Terzi: David saying that he thinks that in a strap on the right hand match he sees it's a little bit better for him because let's say left-handed his control is very good and better. On the right hand side he said my control is not as good as my left hand control that's why I prefer and see that strap is favoring him.
Engin Terzi: He said, yeah, we never grip up with Todd yet, so I cannot say for sure how big is the hand, how uncomfortable it is. And I said, like, I need a hand.
Pavel: It's a tiny hand. So he cannot answer that question for sure until he grips up, but he said, yeah, that's what it is. Yeah, the way that he controlled Irakli, of course we didn't see many matches of him, but does he consider himself having one of the hand and wrist in the category?
Engin Terzi: I'm sorry, he controlled Irakli? No, the way that we saw that he controlled Irakli. Does he think that he has one of the best hand and wrist in the category? He says, we all saw how well you controlled Irakli. He says, do you think that you have one of the best wrist and control in your weight category?
Davit Dadikyan: Again, I don't know, I can't say. But to be honest, my wrist is not in a bad shape. And after the Hercules, I added even more strength. To be honest, my main task now is to train every year. I don't rest. And every time my weight just grows. And I have a problem with the fact that I have to work on my weight. And the wrist becomes, to be honest, stronger. I think this shape, what is here now, is stronger than it was with the Hercules.
Engin Terzi: Okay, he said I cannot answer the question about the best in a weight class. He said that he's training constantly and his wrist power and control is growing every time and his form is probably one of the best in his life right now control wise. He said he's better than he was with Irakli. The only problem he's having right now is to cut the weight.
Engin Terzi: That's a problem because weight is constantly growing because he's always training. If he's losing 12 kilos, he needs to lose 12 kilos and he lost 4.5 kilos and he still feels himself as the
Pavel: Best form ever that it means that like he's about to make it. And another question for Todd. Todd, can you say that your Hajumraz Zola match is a turning point in your career about outside pulling ability? Once you couldn't sleep that match to go to step and lost that match.
Pavel: Do you think that after that you became more of what you are doing in an outside style or it wasn't like that? Because you kind of seemed to have a problem going strapped before. Now it is not really like this. Yeah.
Todd Hutchings: if I could say it was at one point in time, it would be that match. But the realization that I needed to change how I pulled outside happened over like a period of time. And it just, you know, you,
Todd Hutchings: know first arm wrestlers never want to change their style because they're very comfortable with it and i'm sitting here thinking i go i don't think this is working anymore you know so you think you want to change then you then the old way works a little bit so you don't just dive right into it but yeah around the zoloft match
Todd Hutchings: and somebody else gave me the uh my marcio match also was kind of letting me go that i cannot i can't cross center with these these outside pullers so i needed to and i don't have the hand to uh control them so i had to find something that worked for me and i had to find something fast because
Pavel: I'm closer to retirement than starting, so I can't screw around and try a bunch of different things. Yeah. And then finally you decided that you need to figure it out. Do you think that in this way, have you been stronger or more effective than how you are right now?
Todd Hutchings: I'm stronger and differently. My back pressure for sure is better than it's ever been and I'm pulling differently now.
Todd Hutchings: i'm not doing so much peak force numbers i'm trying to train for like 30 30 and 60 second matches because i'm not fast so what i want to do is stop the match and then just make it painful and grueling you know for as long as i can and then hopefully you know things go my way in the later matches i understand
Engin Terzi: Let me translate just bullet points real quick. Engin asked Tadek, your match with Hadji Zaloiev changed your technique, is it true? He said yes and no. Not only him, but there was also Marcio in the fight. He said, I understood that what I did before, it doesn't work as well as it did before. I need to change something a little bit.
Engin Terzi: And he said, yes, 100%, my tension is back, it has grown a lot, I'm training it, I've changed my style. I didn't have much time to think about where I was going, because I was already retired, it was time to leave the sport, not to think about the style, so the decision was made quickly.
Engin Terzi: Yep, ready, thank you.
Pavel: i i cannot read the name of this uh super chat uh the guy that who wrote hi england do you know mikhail nifonto yes i know him he made budget second actually lose in practice match practice but practice match even levan loses yeah would we see him in east versus west what do you think about him he's a very strong guy with left arm it's possible to see him over here anyway so
Pavel: Let's see how it will be, and then let's talk a bit about the... Oh, by the way, the pull-up thing. So, David does with the wrist and do like this, and then David says that this is different than Taz, because Taz holds normal grip. Can you ask him again, you know, how was it?
Pavel: So David is doing with his wrist. If this is the bar, I think they say that David is doing like this, or I don't know, maybe like this. And they say that this is different than how Todd Hutchings was doing. I think they are saying normal grip like this. But can you ask him again to explain?
Engin Terzi: Just to make sure. David, I'm asking you to explain again what you were trying to say earlier. You hold the crossbar without a brush, or with a bent brush, and Tad Hutchings holds it a little differently. Please tell us again what you meant.
Davit Dadikyan: I don't know guys, do you need a translation on it?
Engin Terzi: yeah quickly maybe so he's gripping the bar like this to make sure that he have pressure on the end of the fingers right here yeah and instead of this so basically it's on the bones structure no pressure on the end of the fingers
Pavel: Instead of this, he has a pressure on the end of his fingers. Looks like he just passed you the water bottle, you know, that he was holding. Yeah. I just want to make sure that, you know, I have something. I think I see them by each other, you know, because he was holding one and then you just get another one. Yeah. Yeah. Anyways, so let's talk a little bit about the matches and their predictions.
Todd Hutchings: And some of them I will not ask to Todd. Todd may not know them so well, but let's start. Marcio Barboza or Oleg Petrenko, Todd? Ooh. Pressure. I love Marcio, but I think Oleg. I think Marcio is an elbow-foul generating machine over there at East vs. West. So that's...
Todd Hutchings: I think Oleg's the favorite in that. Because I haven't seen Marcio pulling in a while. He just beat Pavel. He just beat me. Beat you when? In the top knuckles up in August. He beat me in 3-1. Yeah, but beating Pavel, I mean, we got children over here that beat Pavel. Right.
Todd Hutchings: i didn't know it's terrible asking the arm wrestling stuff because i don't really follow it i follow the guy i have to arm wrestle and i don't watch other matches yeah and and daddy can you marcia barbosa left hand or right hand left uh no no no probably
Engin Terzi: he thinks petrenko is a favorite he said that petrenko is gaining uh form very very good and nobody knows what barbosa form is right now okay and then i will ask him what did you say except for pablo except for probably okay and uh
Pavel: Do you know them? Do you know them? Do you know them?
Pavel: What's that? He doesn't know. Wow. That's interesting, guys. And Aymeric versus Robbie Toppy. Let's ask this to Tata Shinks. I like Robbie. Robbie Toppy. Do you know Aymeric from France? No. Okay. Okay. Yeah. And okay. Let's go to the next one. Matt Mask versus Wagner Bortolato. Right hand. Right arm.
Todd Hutchings: Matt Mask. Matt Mask? Yeah. Okay. Matt Mask won't be the favorite on that match. I mean, the popular opinion will have Wagner, but I think Matt beats Wagner. So how about this one? No? This one? Matt Wagner do it? I think Matt's finally going to have his shit together and get his timing down.
Pavel: And I think Wagner's going to end up pulling outside a lot. I see. Yeah, David thinks Bartolotto will win. Okay, Irakli, Zirakashvili, Pauline. Listen, this is an interesting one. People say Irakli is going to dominate Paul, and then
Todd Hutchings: attaching his goals to the thread and then puts a laughing, you know, and then, and then the guy says, I may be wrong, but you're not, he's going to dominate. And then Todd goes, yes, you are wrong, you know? Yeah. And so what do you think? I think Paul Linn beats him because, um, data can gave us data can gave all us inside pullers a class on how to pull a rock. So all Paul Linn's are going to do is do it. Yeah.
Todd Hutchings: But David didn't hook him. No, but he, he, he's the only, Irakli only got out of him twice. And, but, um, David got a hold of that hand where Irakli couldn't come back. I think Paul Linn's going to, and I practiced with Paul Linn a few weeks ago, and I think I'm going to see him in a couple of more weeks. So Paul Linn's either going to do what David does, or he's going to do what I did.
Pavel: Oh, I don't know. Okay. But it was funny that whenever you said that he gave us hopes, the inside pullers, when did he even pull last time inside? Come on, man. You are not inside. You are outside puller. Sooner or later, people will start hooking me. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's going there, you know? Yeah.
Engin Terzi: Let me translate real quick and ask David about his opinion. David, they asked who will win, Irakli or Paul Linn. Tad Khachin answered right away, he said, listen, Dadikyan showed us how to fight Irakli.
Engin Terzi: Now we all know, now everyone who can fight from the inside will win in Irakli. Engin says, well, he didn't fight from the inside. He says, well, yes, not quite from the inside, but he did, he held him, and now we all know how to win. Therefore, he says, I believe that Paul Linn will do either what David did, or what I did, and he will win. I agree, I agree, nothing to add.
Davit Dadikyan: Do you also think that Paul Linn can win? Yes, I think he will just spin inside and Irakli will not have time to flinch. If he flinches, well, Paul Linn is very strong, I also watch him, I observe him, he is a very strong athlete. I put more on him.
Engin Terzi: Okay, yeah, David is 100% agree with Todd Hutchings. And he said, yeah, I agree. Pauline will win. And I believe that he will be able to, you know, cop and twist inside. And he's going to win. And I believe that's the case. Okay, Divya Bamba. Divya Bamba says this. Georgi Tautiev versus winner of Todd and David. He was impressive in 105 kg at AMC.
Pavel: Yeah, Georgi Tauti was a great toppler. He took second to Ibrahim Sabo, whom Tata Sings defeated earlier. And again, I cannot read this name. Hey Engin, please ask everybody about their experience with brachialis pain and what they did to fix it. I am a beginner and curious to know about how to fix it whenever
Pavel: I train side pressure so much, please. If you are a beginner, your brachialis pain is very normal, my friend. I mean, that is the first place that starts hurting you. So it means that it is developing, you know, it's getting stronger, my friend. So let's go to the next one. I know where to drop, where is the left arm? David.
Davit Dadikyan: David, left hand, Taynov and Zurab. Taynov, yes. It's difficult, but as Taynov confidently goes forward, I think Taynov is very strong and very fast. I think Zurab just doesn't have time to spin. And Zurab has a habit, he immediately gives it here and puts it. And Taynov just spins well. I think Taynov is very fast.
Engin Terzi: He said that he believes that Taynov will win because Taynov is very fast and very strong. And Zurab will have no time, you know, to just engage all his power. Plus, he believes that Zurab have this bad habit where he, you know, giving up a little bit. And then from this position, he's trying to pull back. But he said it's not going to work with Taynov because he's copying very good and he's twisting very strong. So he believes that Taynov is going to win.
Pavel: Daniel Prokopchuk versus Minda Agas. Artem you familiar? Daniel. Daniel? Yeah. I love that guy. I will always pick him. It is like mini you.
Pavel: yeah yeah i love him i take him i don't he can say daniel versus devon and i go daniel by a mile you even pick dennis over the one so normal yeah yeah and oleg zog versus two berries there david do you know there is that the bridge
Engin Terzi: He said, I don't know how the Tavberidze style is, but he said that he was watching Oleg and he makes some gains and he puts his money on Oleg. Yeah, and he said that I really want to see that Oleg is...
Pavel: come back and he already gained his best foreman, which is best luck to him. And David, do you know Vladimir Maiorov? David, do you know Vladimir Maiorov? Yes, from Germany. Russian, but now from Germany. He is going to pull David Samushia.
Davit Dadikyan: It seems to me that if he gets the form that I saw when we performed with him in Europe and the world, he can create problems for David. He is gifted, he has a huge hand, he is very good and strong. It depends on what form he will be in. If he is in good shape, then I believe that he can connect very well.
Engin Terzi: He said that if Maiorov will bring the form that he saw him at Worlds and Europe years ago, he said that he has a very good and strong big wrist. He said that he may create lots of problems for David. Yeah, that's true. Okay. Pat, Krasimir Kostadinov or John Brzee? John. Is it because you love him?
Todd Hutchings: Well, I love both those guys. Both those guys are my brothers. I just think... Yeah. I think John's got that. I mean, if it goes... Yeah. I just think John's figured that out. How do you think that John should pull against Krasimir? I think John will try to...
Todd Hutchings: pronate out of it better than he did with the Sasho match. The Sasho match still, I mean, I have all kinds of respect for Sasho. I still, I have it hard to believe that Sasho beat John that easily, you know, but, uh,
Todd Hutchings: I think, I think, uh, John will, I think it'll stop and John will pronate it. If those matches go long, John's in trouble. John's good for like three short matches. You know, one long match changes John's whole, whole evening. So unless, unless John secures the, uh, top role and the guy gives him like this, then maybe he can continue pulling, but in a inside match, probably he gasses out.
Pavel: right and krazy will will pull from you know if john secures the top roll krazy will will stick with it you know so um you might see a long match with krazy's hand back i mean for me the best way to beat krasimir secure your pronator and go over his pronator like yeah you know to this way but and david how you see this match krasimir john brzing
Engin Terzi: David? He said that he thinks John will do it if he doesn't have to cut the weight. And in the 100-105 kg, John is very good. And he said that he believes that he will do it. Okay. If John is 105 kg, he believes that John is going to win? Yes. Okay.
Pavel: Last four matches, Ivan Matyushenko, Rino Masic. Do you know this gentleman, Todd? I'd vote for Ivan Matyushenko. Would you ever pull him? His weight is 115, as long as it is not a title or something. Or would you go for another category after you go down 95? And then sometimes you want to pull also...
Pavel: under 15 yeah i'll pull them yeah okay it would be incredible much it would be i think long match yeah yeah you only give me incredible matches you asked for whenever at the beginning of this east versus west paulo i was asking him you want to pull this guy or that guy he's like i don't know them give me the stronger one you know he's just like he never he never asked the easy one you know
Pavel: I would just actually set him with Levan or something, you know, seriously. He probably wouldn't say no. Yeah, yeah, do it, do it. I want to see some of those. Come on, let the guy lose some time. Okay. And you, Ivan versus Rino? David? Ivan, Ivan. Ivan is going to win? Yes. Yeah. Okay.
Pavel: And this one, I don't ask any detail, any, like, opinion. I just want to ask the winner's name only. Tad. Tad Hutchings versus David Dadikyan. Mr. Hutchings. Mr. Hutchings, right? Mr., yeah? Yeah. And you, David? David, no details. Who will win, you or Tad?
Engin Terzi: We'll see what happens on the 20th. It's going to be fun. How can I beat my grandfather's brother-in-law so easily? I'll be ashamed. He's laughing. He said, we will see on January 20, but then he started laughing and joking. And he said, how can I win that easy with the guy who is aged the same as my grandpa?
Davit Dadikyan: He's had all the respect and he's a great athlete.
Pavel: Okay. Usually, like we saw him two matches against Zog and Irakli. In both matches, he was in also brooding matches. He was very aggressive at the table. Do we expect him to be the same aggressive against Todd or he will be a little bit nicer because he's old enough to be his grandfather?
Engin Terzi: Yes, he says, David, we always saw that you were very aggressive behind the table. Will we see the same aggression with Todd Hutchings, or will you be a little calmer, because you deserve an old man?
Davit Dadikyan: I will say a few words about aggression. Aggression is not caused by my opponents, not that I have a negative attitude towards them. I have a good friendly relationship with Jokha, Prudnik and Rackly. We have a positive relationship. What happens during a fight is an emotion that is not controlled at some point.
Davit Dadikyan: But I don't have any negative feelings towards them. It's just a sport and it has nothing to do with my personality. I'll try to be more patient with Hutchings. I'll try to be as calm as possible so as not to offend him.
Engin Terzi: He said, my aggression on the table does not belong to my opponents. It's all, you know, emotions. Sometimes they may be a little uncontrolled, but this is all pure sporting emotions. Nothing personal to my opponents ever. I'm friends with everybody. And he said, with all the respect, I will try to control my emotions as much as I possibly can. I will try to be as calm as I possibly can.
Engin Terzi: Listen, if his aggression, as long as it's not personal, it's not extreme, if it's helping him to perform better, tell him to not limit so much, as long as it's not disrespectful. He says, if it's all with such respect, then you can be aggressive. He says, don't limit yourself, everything will be fine. As soon as it's in such friendly frames, everything is fine, go ahead. Of course, not more than that, of course.
Pavel: Because some people kind of get that kind of motivation. But as long as it is not disrespectful, you know, yeah. And Artem Morozov versus Alex Kurdecha. Left arm or title match? Morozov. Morozov? How is Morozov going to beat him? Hook him? Topie roll him? Or... Well, Kurdecha's got such a posting top roll. I think Morozov's going to just have to deal with that. So...
Todd Hutchings: Kurdecha will maybe even flop Morozov's hand. I just think Morozov's just too damn strong for Kurdecha. I mean, that man is just... Yeah, yeah. That Morozov is just impressive. Do you think he can also top-roll him or top-roll his heart since Kurdecha is like over two meters? Yeah, top-rolling somebody that tall would be very hard. I think he might be able to, you know...
Todd Hutchings: stop it or pause it or make it ugly. But I think he'll just have the ability to either, you know, throw a press in or slowly get some sort of something in there. I don't know. I don't, I don't know what you call it when, when, when one guy does this and the other guy is forced to hang out and I think it'll be in the straps. So, but I think I like more as often that. Basically you are seeing the, he has more pressure. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: okay and and and let me translate real quick
Engin Terzi: think that Morozov will win. When Engin asked what style, he said, well, it's hard for me to say. He says, either he will manage to twist it up a little bit, or in some other way. He says, I don't think he can pass it up, because it's just very high, it's hard to pass it up. He says, well, I think he will find a way, maybe he will press it with such a press, you know, or with some kind of lateral movement. He thinks that Morozov has it more interesting and better, stronger lateral movement.
Davit Dadikyan: Yes, a strong Maiorov. Uniquely strong is the side movement. Well, as I think, too. I fought with everyone for such a side movement, that's how it is twisted. It seems to me that I did not feel anyone on my hand. Very strong.
Engin Terzi: You also think Morozov will win? Yes, of course. He said that he believes that's exactly what it is and Morozov will win. And he said, I never felt anybody with that crazy side pressure was copying. He said, he's insane. He believes that he has the strongest he ever felt in his hand. Talking about left arm or right arm? Left. We're talking about left right now.
Pavel: Okay, okay. Superboy, a question to David. What is Denis' rank? I think he's asking what does he think that he ranks in the world. I think. David, someone made a superchat and asks, what is your opinion about Denis' rank in the world? What position is he in? I think he...
Davit Dadikyan: David thinks that he's probably in top 5 right now, but he said we can say for sure after his next supermatch.
Pavel: that's that's that's will be uh more or less the the last match i will ask is for me is the like most interesting match no disrespect to another match but for me it's very interesting match is the original murado versus evgeny prudnik left arm um do you know alicia murado yeah the guy that full uh
Pavel: He beat Oleg Petrenko, left arm, and then he also beat Cody Merritt. And then at the WAF, last two years, he is winning the superweight category while he is like 220 pounds, you know. And so he just competes there just to challenge himself, you know. And now he's going to pull against Prudnik. And how do you see this match? This is 405-kilo world title match.
Todd Hutchings: i think prudnik beats him beats him how how do you expect him to beat him like the way prudnik beats most people eventually get him into a hook and just wear him out but do you expect it to be easy match or hard match a war it's hard to tell when prudnik's matches are easy or hard because i can't really tell if he's stretching him out on purpose or not um
Todd Hutchings: And even when Prudnik gets done with a fast match or a really long match, he doesn't sweat. He doesn't look tired. I have a hard time judging, you know, Prudnik. I think he's a machine and not a person. Yeah. I think it's a very difficult match. But if the score went 3-0 either way or 4-0 either way, it wouldn't surprise me. But I think Prudnik wins that.
Pavel: But even if the match is 3-0, 4-0, it never means that it's not a battle. It may be 4-0 and 4 wars. And this is also David's category. And we know that David, probably after second round, I think there was a piece of bone broken in his elbow, as far as I know. And how does David see this match?
Engin Terzi: Okay, David, I'll start by explaining what they talked about. You got the match, right? Muratov and Prudnik. Tad thinks Prudnik will win. He says it won't be easy, it'll be a serious match. He says he won't be surprised if it's 3-0 or 4-0 on either side, but he thinks Prudnik will win.
Engin Terzi: When Engin asked him if it would be hard for him or easy for him, he said, how can you tell if it's hard for Prudnik or easy for him? He never sweats. He said, it's not clear if he's stretching this match on purpose or if it's really hard for him. He said, it's not clear. He said, he thinks Prudnik should win this match. And then, of course, they asked,
Davit Dadikyan: And he commented that probably in the second round with Prudnik, when yours was, you had a piece of bone in your hand, right? Well, I'll say that, and I'm sure that Olezhan will beat Prudnik. And with all due respect to sportsmen, it's pretty easy. As I see it, I look and also Morozov told, they both trained. Olezhan has a big hand and is very strong.
Davit Dadikyan: I won two fights during the third fight. Evgeny in the video you can hear how I was in this position, my hand just went behind my shoulder. There was a fracture, my hand was so swollen that I couldn't move.
Davit Dadikyan: I had a fixator for three weeks. I still haven't recovered. I think I need to have an operation. It happened with Morozov, where we fought in King of the Table. After that, I seem to have recovered, but it happened again. Now I'm not in a good condition, my hand hurts, it crunches all the time. I think I need to have an operation, and after that I'll have to train a little more to recover.
Engin Terzi: uh okay uh david said that he's almost sure and positive that uh alijan will win this match uh he talked with morozov and morozov said that alijan's hand is very large and he have that side move is very very powerful so he yeah he believes that alijan will win this match relatively easy
Engin Terzi: uh and then uh for his injury he commented he said yeah that started after king of the table match with morozov with arkham and he thought that he recovered but he didn't and in a third third one he heard yeah he heard a very bad click now it's you know painful and he has some fixations for three weeks but doesn't help most likely he will have a surgery to fix it and then yeah
Pavel: and then then he will start recovering that yeah yes your record says good luck david good luck grandpa and roman you know yeah and then before we finish i want to say guys who are watching us uh we have the yearly subscription uh normally for events around like 80 dollars this way like you're 69.99 so it's like normally 79.96 now 69.99 so you save 10 dollars
Pavel: and and then this event for every signed product that we have we sell uh comes with the east versus west strap just for your information and before we finish um uh part
Pavel: do you think that devon progress since last time he pulled against uh levon saginashvili and what is his chance uh this time just your opinion i think i think devon wins then wins
Pavel: Okay, just tell us why you think this way. Last time he lost, this time he wins. Is it because he progressed a lot or because Levan got injured from his wrist or he learned something or last time he lost because he got injured or what is the explanation? I think Levan's injured and he's coming back from an injury and Devin's a tough mountain to climb.
Todd Hutchings: You know, or not. So to come right back after that, I think Devin learned something from his match with LaVon. I think Devin learned a lot from LaVon's match with Hermes. Okay. And I think, um, Devin has a, uh, a singular unique and unorthodox focus to preparing for arm wrestling and.
Todd Hutchings: It's paying dividends. I don't think he trains in an orthodox, conventional manner. And he figured out what works for Devin. And I like his chances. I mean, I'm pretty confident Devin wins that. Wow. Pretty confident. That's interesting. And David? David, what do you think? Larratt, Ivan and Soginashvili in the upcoming match? Ivan.
Todd Hutchings: He said Levon will win. Levon will win? Okay. Anyways, the last super chat before we close. Clerks, will Pope give a head rub to Dadikyan if he wins? I don't. We'll see. I don't know him that well. After I meet him a few times, we'll discuss it. I only do that when I'm pretty confident I'm not going to get beat up. You know?
Engin Terzi: Someone asked me in the Super Chat, Tad Hutchings, will you scratch Dityan's head when you win against him? He said, damn, I only do it with those I already know well. He said, well, after we meet with David a couple of times, I'll think about it, will I do it or not. I only do it with those I know won't beat me back for it.
Davit Dadikyan: David, have you ever fought with Vitaly? If so, what did you feel? I fought with Vitaly on the left hand. It was in 2021, two years ago. There is even a video on YouTube showing it. When I managed to spin into the hook, I won it.
Davit Dadikyan: When he started, the fight took about 30-40 seconds. He punched me a little bit, but he couldn't get past me. I held him, held him, held him all this time. Then I realized that I wouldn't pull him out of there anymore and just gave him my hand.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, he pulled him once, like two matches. There is a video on YouTube. The first time when he was able to twist him into the hook, he won. The second time, Vitaly was able to, you know, beat his pronator out a little bit. But Dedican was still holding on his biceps. He said about maybe 30 seconds or so. But then he let it go because he couldn't pull it back. Okay, so let's finish it. Todd, do you have anything to add?
Todd Hutchings: anything to say to your opponent just two things on the uh on the pull-ups i don't have a pull-up bar so i have to use the squat bar on my rack which is why i did that grip the other thing was i didn't know russian plates were heavier than american plates so i just grabbed three plates i would have i would have grabbed more had i it was after you had posted the video someone sent me he goes
Pavel: They were comparing the weight. I go, I only did three plates because David did three plates. And he goes, yeah, but Russian plates are 25 kilograms. Yours is like 21 kilos or something, 21 and a half kilos or something. It's 45 pounds. Or 20.4, yeah. Oh, 20.4, yeah, yeah, yeah. I just didn't know. Okay, so you don't have more plates? I have more, but I didn't know at the time. Okay, but so does it mean that we will see you with the four plates?
Pavel: Well, we'll see. I'm waiting for another David Bullock video. Then we'll do an answer. Okay. And you can also tell David that it is not 25 kilos each task. Probably he thinks that it's 25 kilos.
Engin Terzi: Yes, I'm joking. About the pull-ups, he says, I don't have a normal crossbar, he says, I pull up on my cube for squats, he says, firstly. Secondly, he says, I didn't know that Russian pancakes weigh 25 kilograms, he says, I weigh 20 and a half, he says. Well, now, he says, I'm waiting for David's next video about pull-ups, and now I already know, he says, I weigh more.
Engin Terzi: He said, whatever you got, you got. Before the tournament, we will probably not do it. But after tournament, we'll see. Whatever you got, it's good. And can you ask him if anything he wants to add before we close?
Davit Dadikyan: I'm glad to have such a meeting. Thank you very much, Eugen, for organizing such a match. Moreover, it will be a super match.
Davit Dadikyan: Thank you very much, Todor, for accepting the invitation. It's a great honor for me to compete with such an athlete. I've been watching him for a long time, when he still had a mustache. I've been fighting for a long time. Therefore, I will fight with great honor and pleasure. Honestly, this is one of those athletes with whom
Engin Terzi: I want to go out and share this table, this evening, and have fun. Of course, God willing, I will win. Only positive emotions. That's all. He said, thank you, Engin, for organizing this super match, this match. Thank you, Tartt Hutchings, for agreeing for this match. And he said, huge respect. And he's following you all over back when you used to have mustache.
Engin Terzi: yeah and uh he said that uh it's his pleasure you know to pull on the same table and uh it will be a great night and he hoped that he gonna win but anyway it's uh it's a huge respect and huge pleasure to be on the same table okay thank you very much david thank you very much todd and thank you very very much paulo you all take care and see you in less than three weeks
