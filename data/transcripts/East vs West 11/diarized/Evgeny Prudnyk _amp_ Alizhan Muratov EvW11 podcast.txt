Alizhan Muratov: Wow. I have a question for you. Which one do you think is more dangerous for you, David Dadikyan or Ali Canmurado? I think Muratov. Why? Because he has the power same with
Engin Terzi: I think he has the power same with the gun, but he has endurance. Better endurance. Better endurance. Yeah, yeah. And also very explosive, right? Very fast. Ali Can, can you turn the phone sideway?

Engin Terzi: Okay, Raimon said that he will join in three minutes. Three minutes. Raimon will come for translation, yeah. And... And, Prudnik, when Raimon comes, are you going to speak English or Raimon will translate for you? Uh...

Engin Terzi: You beat Oleg Petrenko, one. When you win three championships, that belt will be yours. Do you know? Belt? Belt, belt. But you have to win three times. Aha. You beat Petrenko, now Prudnik. If you beat Prudnik, it will be two. Then if you win one more in 105 kilos, belt will be yours. Aha. Aha. Aha.
Engin Terzi: i tell him that i tell him that you know he beat petrenko once and then if he beats you he will be two and then he will need to win one more to have the belt permanently um what is your chance to beat this guy you do you see yourself favorite or 50 50 match i don't know we will see

SPEAKER_02: um
Alizhan Muratov: Well, our language is a little bit similar, some moments you can understand, it turns out. Is it Turkish? Yes, Turkish, yes. A little bit. Some words can be understood. How is your shape? Well, so ... You weigh 120 kilograms, more or less.
Raimonds Liepins: okay okay let let let me understand what they say hello raymond hey guys sorry i'm a little bit late i i just run in and said everything yeah but you got him okay let me i can't hear you guys give me a second okay okay um
Raimonds Liepins: I'll translate what I need to translate. What was the question? What was the answer? The question is, do they like Rymus Leopiens? That was the question. Ah, terrible, terrible. Should I translate that? I will not translate that. I'll ask something else.
Engin Terzi: okay so before you came i asked prudnik he is 108 kilo and alijan is 104 105 kilo and i showed the belt and prudnik said that it will be his his belt and then before then i have to okay uh i asked to prudnik i said who is more dangerous for you dadikyan or alijan
Engin Terzi: He said that Alizhan is more dangerous because Alizhan is as strong as Dadikyan, but also has better enduros. Do you agree with that, Raimonds? I agree with that. About Alizhan having better enduros? Yeah, I think Alizhan is more dangerous than anyone else on that division. Mm-hmm.
Raimonds Liepins: explosiveness power technique just like remember when we asked like what would happen if you can't do your move and he said he's like what do you mean i cannot do my move right he doesn't need plan abc he just needs a that's it you're talking about yeah yeah but he had it he did this he did bicep yeah under like this he did everything you know yeah yeah again against petrenko yeah
Raimonds Liepins: So, Alizhan, do you expect Prudnik to be more dangerous than Petrenko? He said yes, absolutely, 100%. I think he's way more dangerous.
Alizhan Muratov: But why? What is the reason? Why do you think so? Because Prudnik has been competing for a long time. He is an experienced and quite strong opponent. So you can't underestimate him. I think he is stronger than Petrenko.
Raimonds Liepins: He said that Petrenko, sorry, Prudnik competes a long time. He's very strong. He's very experienced. And not to take him more seriously than Petrenko would be a huge mistake. I understand. And can you ask him how is his form right now?
Raimonds Liepins: How do you feel about the training? How do you feel? What's your form? For example, if you look at how you were when there was a match with Petrenko and now. Well, I scored pretty well compared to when I was fighting with Petrenko.
Alizhan Muratov: Then I can say that I did not have any form, because at that time I could not prepare properly for the fight. And now I will approach this fight more seriously.
Raimonds Liepins: he said that when he was preparing for Petrenko he said he couldn't give 100 for the training because he had work and some other stuff and he said this is a way more harder way more serious preparation for this match than that match I'll ask him how does he feel like differently does he feel stronger better than
Raimonds Liepins: You said it was more serious, right? But in terms of weight and everything, do you feel stronger than you were when you were preparing for Petrenko? Yes. There is progress. He said yes, there is progress.
Engin Terzi: And Evgeny, I asked the same thing to Evgeny, but let's ask again, you know, he said that I think he's in better shape than many people in Dadikyan, but can you ask him one more time? What's your form now, if you look at how you were when the match with Dadikyan was, and now against Olezhan, how do you feel about the preparation and everything? I think the form is better, because...
Alizhan Muratov: I didn't have enough angle with Dadikyan. I had a very good side pressure, but I didn't have enough time to prepare. I don't know why, but before the fight with Dadikyan, I tried to pull the angle, but for some reason I didn't get it. I needed more time.
Alizhan Muratov: Now, at this moment, I just felt that I started to breathe, and the angle became stronger. Such an attack on the children, a good start, and a good attack at the beginning. Because I held it near the pillow. Because of the fact that I was running, my breath was getting...
Alizhan Muratov: Now you are better prepared for a fast start, right? Aljan is also very fast.
Raimonds Liepins: So he said that he feels like right now there's a little bit more time to prepare for this match than it was for...
Raimonds Liepins: Dadikyan's match. He said there's, of course, there's some things he worked on because with Dadikyan, he missed all the starts and he was always fighting for positions and always fighting to be, to come back from B side to the A side. So he said he spent a lot of time working on that and he believes he's better at that. And he knows that Alizhan is also maybe just as explosive and not more explosive than Dadikyan. So
Engin Terzi: those are the main issues he's worried about because uh he said he felt he feels good and strong I kind of feel Ramos we will see something that we will never forget again I think I think so I think I think we will see a big war big war you know
Engin Terzi: yeah the match versus dadikian was incredible right that was one of the greatest matches we have seen in a long time just after round two pretty start to have the control but here i kind of think that until the match finish you know and now it's like the best of seven you know they need to win four rounds
Engin Terzi: And but can you ask them do they know that starting from 2024 is that like the week all the title matches to win you need to win four rounds. David they know that? Can you ask them?
Raimonds Liepins: Does it change anything in your mind? Because in every championship match, in order to become a champion, you have to win 4 rounds, not 3, right? In the past, all of East vs. West was best of 5, but now it's best of 7. Best of 7. If something changes, let's start with Alizhan. Or anyway. So now we're for defense, right?
Raimonds Liepins: In order to become a champion, you have to win 4 rounds. It can be 4-3, not 3-2 as it was. Will it change anything for you? Well, one round is very energy-consuming.
Alizhan Muratov: For example, if you turn on the extra rounds now, it also costs more energy. Because of this, you need more endurance, more strength. It turns out that you can say that 25% you still have to work harder. For example, like this.
Raimonds Liepins: He said that, of course, every change will be something different. So it adds at least like, let's say, you need 25% more to win, literally, right? Because you need extra round to win. So he said, you need a little bit more endurance. You need to prepare a little bit better. You need to not make as many mistakes. So he doesn't know.
Raimonds Liepins: how it's gonna affect it but he knows that okay you need to like endurance will be the biggest factor for him I'll ask the same more rounds better for me he said more rounds better
Engin Terzi: Yeah, I understand. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, so any you have any question for them, right? Anything you're like, I want to ask something to pretty just don't forget if you have a question like pretty.
Engin Terzi: Do you see, or I want to ask both sides, do they see this match is going anywhere other than inside? Do you think there is a chance that this match will go somewhere else than inside?
Raimonds Liepins: He said that it depends if Alizhan cannot beat me on the inside, he might try to go on the outside.
Alizhan Muratov: And what does Alizhan think? He said, I haven't had a match with Brodnyk before.
Alizhan Muratov: so we have to have a match for me to figure it out so we will see when when the match happens foreign
Engin Terzi: uh he said this most likely is going to be a hook match even if uh allergen wants to go for a talk for a for a high hook it's still a hook or he said there's more likelihood on being a hook war than anything else yeah yeah i i i i talked with one time with krasimir said that there is no hook match that ended more than one minute he said that before one minute somebody's wrist is already
Engin Terzi: falling out, but I'm not sure. I just tried to check some matches. Yeah, I mean, I remember like Betkidi Oniyani and Raz Serdekian, they pull, but really after a point, one of them really fall down, but let's see how this one will be. And I have a question, another question, like to both of them, do they have any goal
Engin Terzi: to win any other category in the future? Will they have an eye on 115 and even in Supers? You should ask first. I'll just ask Alizhan first because I think that he might have. Yeah. Alizhan, for example, you win this match,
Raimonds Liepins: Do you want to stay in this category or do you want to try to go higher, for example, 115, 115 plus? What are your plans? Plans? The first plan is to win the upcoming fight.
Alizhan Muratov: Then it will all depend on the result of the neighboring fights, other arm-fighting, what kind of result they will have, and what kind of arm-fighting people are interested in. It will all depend on that. No matter what we want, people want to see. I think that's it.
Raimonds Liepins: so he said of course the first thing is this match uh I can't make any conclusions before we had this match we have to have this match and after that he said uh all the other matches that finished are interested for for the fans and interesting for me and interesting for you hanging right the promotion he said he would be very open to do and uh he just looks for something that would you know he could do right and
Raimonds Liepins: Because I asked him what are his plans, literally what are his plans, right? Can you also ask him what's his surprise when Prudnik beat Dadikyan? Ah, did you have a surprise when Prudnik beat Dadikyan, Aljan? Aljan, did you have a surprise when Prudnik... Not for me, not for me. No, it's for Aljan.
Alizhan Muratov: I didn't think about it, but it seemed to me that Prudnik would win. You thought so, didn't you? Why do you say that? I fought with Morozov before. I saw his hook, I held his hook. When Morozov won,
Alizhan Muratov: I realized then that he wasn't strong enough to show it to me. That's why I did it. You thought Prudnik had more chances to win this match, right? Yes.
Raimonds Liepins: uh he said it actually wasn't surprised for him he thought that prudnik will win he said that he has pulled uh Morozov a few times and he said when Morozov beat him um he said oh okay I feel like prudnik could beat him also that's how he felt I'll ask Evgeny about the plans of the future of the uh
Alizhan Muratov: You will win this match, you are a champion of 105 kg. Do you want to stay here or try to go to Vistula? And how much to Vistula, if? Now, in the near future, I have a plan to return the right hand. No, let's go to the left, to the left. To fight at 105 kg and left and right at 105 kg. When I feel that I will be...
Raimonds Liepins: He said right now his plan is to bring back his right arm. He said most likely he wants to stay in 105 and continue fighting there until he feels confident that he can go up. About left arm? Yeah, with both arms. He said when he feels confident, he might go up.
Raimonds Liepins: And Alizhan, how many times or has he ever pulled Morozov left arm in a competition? David you have a fight with Morozov in a competition? No, we just fought. With a guy? Yes, with a guy. Not in a competition? No, it was a long time ago.
Engin Terzi: uh he said no no no they they just pulled in a practice table at the and he said like 2021 at the end of two yeah but but in in one of the events was it like lotoshino or something they were in the same category i think for the overall left arm but they didn't meet each other i think alijan won that one
Raimonds Liepins: Were they not in the same category in one of the Russian events? Engin asking in Loto Shino. No, no, no, you speak in English. Oh, sorry. Engin asked you, in Loto Shino you were in the same category for one year, right? Yes, yes. And you won, but you didn't meet, right? No, we met.
Alizhan Muratov: I met him. It was a question. I thought you were fighting in a real competition or just on the table. No, you're asking about Matyushenko. Matyushenko, on the left hand, we met, fought, I won him. I absolutely won. It was in 2020, right? At the beginning of 2020, right?
Alizhan Muratov: Around 19 or 20 years later, about a year and a half later, in 2021, we fought with him in the city of Almaty. It was just like that. It was a back-to-back fight.
Raimonds Liepins: Didn't you fight with Ivan Matyushenko?
Alizhan Muratov: Let's do a sparring training on 19th of January with Ivan Matyushenko. We'll see who wins.
Raimonds Liepins: I'll translate for Egid. Prodigy asked, have you pulled Ivan Matyushenko? He said, no. He said, that would be an interesting match. You know what we should do? We should do a sparring match between you and Ivan Matyushenko on 19th. 19th, the day before.
Raimonds Liepins: If you beat Prudnik, would you like to fight Ivan Matyushenko up to 115 kg? Maybe two belts?
Alizhan Muratov: You can, you can. What do you think? Is it more difficult or easier than Prudnik? Ivan. It's a difficult question. Who asked it? How can I say? Dzeranov and Ivan Matyushenko, who did they fight with? Who? Dzeranov. Dzeranov. Dzeranov?
Alizhan Muratov: On the right, right, Kostya? On the world? On the left. I don't remember. I think his left and right are the same. I don't know. Can we fight, Kostya? Yes.
Raimonds Liepins: I'll translate. So he said, it's an interesting match. He said, okay. And I said, what do you think? Is it easier or harder than pruning?
Engin Terzi: he said well that's a very tough question then he started he's like didn't even pull the rano on left and uh most likely right he pulled him to 2000 he came in on the cause of alijan this is there i know matushenko but these are no winners
Engin Terzi: Right and left. Right and left, yeah. Do you see Dzerhanov? Ivan Matyushenko, I think, second. Second. Second. But Dzerhanov was 110 kilos. Dzerhanov is now 130 kilos. David you fight Dzerhanov? Yeah. We trained together.
Engin Terzi: You know, I don't know if people realize, but these guys are like very extraordinary, like extraordinary human beings. You know, these guys are like you find very seldom on this earth. Very special people, you know. I don't know if people realize, but Prudnik and Ali Can, like...
Engin Terzi: i don't care about i mean some people cares and i respect ronaldo messi but these are ronaldo messi here right here yeah yes yes yes very very special human beings you know just like incredible to come to this level is just wow wow uh jerry i'm not i'm not
Engin Terzi: Speaking Russian, I speak Turkish with Ali Can. Originally, we speak the same language. Anyway, so let's talk about some other matches from the card. Because it is late where Ali Can is. It is 10.30 p.m. over there. I don't want Ali Can to be so late to do that.
Engin Terzi: so raymond let's uh let's start with the some of the matches um i don't know alijan do you know america from france i'm married it is nice america is francia yeah he doesn't okay and
Engin Terzi: Do you know Robbie Toppy, Prudnik, from the US? It's very hard to have a prediction when you don't know the both guys. Okay, let's start from the 95 kilo world title match.
Engin Terzi: Ali Can. Artem Taynov, Zurab Tavberidze. 95 kilo world title match. Who is winning? Left hand. Left hand? Yeah. Left. Taynov and Zurab. Zurab, of course. Yes, Zurab. Who is winning? Zurab Tavberidze. Zurab Tavberidze.
Engin Terzi: Okay, both Prudnik and Ali Can says that Zurab is going to beat Taino? Yeah, yeah. Wow. So, Zurab. So, they believe that Zurab will be the new champion. Yeah. That's interesting. That is surprising to hear. After we saw the performance of Taino against Sasho. And this one is a crazy match. Matt Mask versus Wagner Bortolato. Bravo.
Raimonds Liepins: Right arm. Wagner versus Matt Mask. On the right hand. What do you think? Matt Mask. Yeah. Matt Mask. Yeah, I think...
Alizhan Muratov: What time do you stay?
Raimonds Liepins: I felt like Matt Mask was weak last match. He said, who did he fight? I said Lamparelli. And Prudnik said Lamparelli is a very serious opponent. Yeah, but Lamparelli is a top roller and Wagner is going inside. And Wagner's right arm and left arm is not the same, you know.
Alizhan Muratov: left arm is much stronger normally i think uh first and second round but uh but after third round musk will be top we'll take so who's winning we'll take him wrist and uh i think in finally we'll win oh matt mass will win creature yeah okay okay
Alizhan Muratov: And let's talk about another one. Oleg Petrenko, Marcio Barboza, Alizhan. Petrenko, maybe. Winners. Petrenko, yes. Do you think Oleg Petrenko? Right down, right? Right down, right? Yeah. Right? Yeah.
Engin Terzi: I think Petrenko will win. They both think Petrenko will win. But do they say anything else than, you know, just saying the winner? I asked them, do you think they're easy or not easy? And they said, if he has enough endurance, he will win easy. Okay, I understand. Let's talk about Oleg Dzok versus Tutberidze. Alizhan, do you know Tutberidze?
Engin Terzi: from georgia 65 kilo champion very strong very strong yeah people don't know him very young 19 years old and in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the
Engin Terzi: Tutberidze is going to beat Oleg Dzok 5-0. And then Oleg says, like, is that a joke, you know? And then they a little bit talk to each other, but... And what do you think, Oleg, who's winning? Oleg or Tutberidze? Well, most likely Oleg, but it won't be interesting. Up to the top. And if he had an opponent, a hooker, I think he would have won. He has a very good...
Raimonds Liepins: he said that um uh if he added on to but if he had a different opponent like a hook puller he would win him but he's most likely Oleg is going to win but it's going to be a tough match oh okay okay
Alizhan Muratov: Normally it is not easy to give Oleg Zhokh a tough match if the opponent is a top-roller, but yeah. And how do you see Prudnik in this match? Oleg Zhokh. Oleg Zhokh. I think right now he is returning to his form. He is much stronger than the time when he fought
Raimonds Liepins: He said that Oleg Zhokh, he believes he's coming back into his old shape. He's much better than he was when he pulled Dadikyan a while back ago and it's getting better and better. So he believes Oleg Zhokh. Okay.
Engin Terzi: A while ago we talked about the winner of this match to pull against Ivan Matyushenko, but Ivan Matyushenko has a match against Rino Masic. And so who knows, maybe Ivan Matyushenko will not be the man, maybe Rino will be the man. How do they see this match? Rino versus Ivan on the left hand.
Alizhan Muratov: I think if Rinna wins, there's no point in Alizhan and Ivan Matyushenko getting together. Alizhan, what do you think? I definitely think Ivan Matyushenko, because he doesn't have such a cool hook as Ivan Matyushenko. In any case.
Raimonds Liepins: um first uh prodnik said that uh if he said if reno wins there's there's no point of making alijan versus even match yeah then alijan said that uh he believes even will win because he said like his hook is just who is even even like you mean you want even even yeah yeah okay yeah yeah you want here you are you want you want even winnerman um but uh reno
Engin Terzi: Also, Güçlü. Güçlü. Güçlü? Yeah. Kuvvetli. I don't know. Maybe Matyushenko Güçlü. Yeah, yeah, Matyushenko for sure Güçlü, but we will see. And what do you think, Evgeny? Who's gonna win? Ivan or Rino? Ivan Matyushenko.
Engin Terzi: We will see. We will see. And then let's go to another match. Daniel Prokopchuk vs. Mindaugas Tarasaitis. 75 kilos. 75 kilos. World Championship match.
Alizhan Muratov: Daniel or Mendoza? Daniel Prokopchuk. Prokopchuk or Mendoza? Prokopchuk or Mendoza? Evgeny if he loses something, even if he loses the wrist, they're going to put on a strap and he'll just do this and beat everyone. And what do you think, Evgeny? Prokopchuk will always stand like this and watch.
Raimonds Liepins: He said Brogovchuk will do like he usually does, just stand and look like this. Baba, did they know that Mindaugas also has multiple times wins against Daniel? He will say, come on, fight, we are already fighting. Brogovchuk just said, Daniel will stand in place and say, come on, let's fight. And Mindaugas said, I'm already fighting.
Engin Terzi: I think they are underestimating Mindaugas. I mean, I'm not saying Daniel cannot win, but it will not be that easy as they are thinking, you know. It will be a war. It will be a war. Mask them if they knew that Mindaugas also has multiple times wins against Daniel. Mindaugas won against Daniel many times. It will be interesting to see.
Engin Terzi: he said it's going to be interesting for sure okay okay let's go to another match pauline versus iraqis rakashvili oh paul против iraq they're thinking oh maybe pauline has a good chance
Alizhan Muratov: But Radley has a chance. I don't know, 50-50. 50-50. He has a good side pressure. Yeah, good side pressure and very explosive. It will be like Tadzio with Radley.
Alizhan Muratov: I don't know how he fights in the last armfight.
Alizhan Muratov: I saw him when we met. I think Irakli will win.
Raimonds Liepins: He said he's still not too familiar with Paul Linn. He just saw him in the last Supermatch polling. He believes that Irakli, because of his strength parameters and how he polls, will win. So, okay, one thing. Who wins? Irakli. Irakli. Oh, he said Irakli. Yeah, and our predict it was 50-50. Okay, and...
Engin Terzi: Samushia vs. Maiorov. What do you think? Do you know Maiorov? Do you know Maiorov? Maiorov. Maiorov, yeah. And against Samushia. Can Maiorov beat Samushia? He has an uncomfortable leg. He is very fat.
Raimonds Liepins: Major hasn't played for a long time, right? Major has just returned from the Swiss Open. He played there, but didn't win.
Alizhan Muratov: I think Samushia will most likely win, because he's been competing a lot lately. He's in the competitive process. He hasn't been resting. And in this fight, I think Samushia is more likely to win. Prudnik, you said that Mayurov has a comfortable hand. Yes, yes. I think he can do it.
Raimonds Liepins: He asked me, did Maiorov compete? And I told him it's open. And he said, most likely because Samokier has competed so much and he's so good that it's very hard to beat him. Prudnik said that Maiorov has a very uncomfortable hand. He said his hand is very, very thick and very, very weird.
Engin Terzi: And it's, but still it's most likely Samushia. And Maiorov said, Alizhan said? Also Samushia. Alizhan, does he remember his match with Maiorov at the Zlotitor? With right arm? Left arm. No, right arm. Long match. Ah, yes. Yeah. Lepski doesn't remember. He remembers the right arm. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Very long match, yeah.
Raimonds Liepins: And can you ask him, this is something different, when he won the Zloty Tur with a left arm, did anyone cause him any problem? To Alizhan? Alizhan, when you won the Zloty Tur on the left, in 2018, were there any problems at all? Or were you just like that for everyone? I didn't have any problems.
Engin Terzi: No problem. No problem. Can you ask him if he remembers him? First, I won my category and he won his category. And then at the side table, we pulled a little bit. Does he remember that with the left arm? On the left hand, you won your category and Engin won his category. And then you were behind the scenes, standing a little bit under the table. Do you remember this? He'll ask. It wasn't the World Championship?
Raimonds Liepins: No, Zloty Tur. Is it Zloty Tur? Yes, I remember. What do you remember about that training? Well, you started to pull me. Someone cut me out.
Engin Terzi: He said, well, you started to pull on my hand. That's what he remembers. Yeah, yeah. He was like this. And I think I was like this. Right, Alija? With my pronator. And you were on the shoulder like this. Yeah. We were stuck there, you know, for some time, you know. And we stopped pulling, you know. But what was Prudnik saying? No, I don't remember that.
Engin Terzi: What does he say? Prudnik doesn't remember this. Okay, there is a super chat by Jeffrey. Prudnik, my favorite heavyweight. Let's go, champion, he says. And let's go to another match. John Brzing versus Krasimir Kostadinov. Alizhan. John versus Krasimir on the right. Damn, it's going to be interesting. I can't even make a prediction.
Engin Terzi: I told him that he will be 105 kilos not 95 kilos.
Alizhan Muratov: I think, most likely, there will be a break-in. Bulgaria will go into the corner, and they will go further into the corners. But I don't think Barzanek will go into the open, closed corner. He will go into the upper corner, I think. Yes, the upper corner. He won't let him go all the way to the end. He will go to Krasimir.
Raimonds Liepins: he believes the match will most likely go inside because that's what cross he does that's what bulgarians do um john will also might go inside but he will stay a little bit on outside not a lot allowing crossy to be fully in a deep hook i mean on the pronator like this pronator and back pressure yeah yeah and who's winning
Alizhan Muratov: He believes it's a very close match. They could be the same level and 50-50. And Prudnik?
Alizhan Muratov: Grambol was stronger than Samushia. In terms of endurance, they were about the same. Now at the moment, to be honest, I don't know how to describe it.
Alizhan Muratov: Because he suspects that he is a little weaker than Sash. But it's not even about that. Sash has, if he has fought Sash many times, he has such a binding, he has a certain position where he blocks the opponent in front of the pillow, practically. And it seems that you have already won everything, you have already won the position, and that's it.
Alizhan Muratov: I seem to have twisted it and not completely untwisted it with my finger, but I took the center, I took the information, and I pulled my fingers out a little bit, and it was already necessary to press. And it was in this position that Samushia was not very strong for some reason. I tried to do the same thing many times and realized that it was almost very difficult to go there, you have to look for another way.
Alizhan Muratov: Well, in general, on this John Brzenk got stuck. That's what I saw, that's what I was worried about before the fight. Therefore, I say, Samushia has more chances than John. But Krasimir doesn't have such a block. For some reason, I don't know how it is with Samushia. I, by the way, have not met anyone so far.
Alizhan Muratov: In such a position, the hands are blocked. It's easier for him to win in the hook than in the top. It's easier for him to win in the top hook. In general, Krasimir doesn't have that. I think, in general, from everything I've said, John Brzenk has more chances. More chances for John.
Raimonds Liepins: I'll try to remember everything he said and try to just make a little compact info. So he said back in the day when they used to fight Krasimir and Sasho, Krasimir was winning, but he was very, very close. He said he was winning by a small margin if it was in a long match. He doesn't know where the difference is now.
Raimonds Liepins: He said when John had a match with Sasho, John is very good at stopping you and then coming back, blocking you, pulling you back. And then he usually gets to the point where he gets over the center and can transition to a press. And he couldn't do that with Sasho because Sasho is very good in that position, very strong and very, very uncomfortable. He doesn't believe Krasimir has that same position.
Alizhan Muratov: And he says he believes... You said John, right? You think John is a better favorite? Yes, yes, yes. Krasimir doesn't have that kind of mapping. A close match. I think it's the technique of Zoran Brzenk that he mostly likes to use now. Before, he was more...
Alizhan Muratov: For John, I just couldn't hear.
Raimonds Liepins: uh he believes that uh because john has since different techniques transitions and and crossy is still he's very good at that one good move he believes john is the favorite but it's it's not like a big favorite it's very slight favorite and and did we hear uh alijan because i forgot it was so long did you ask the same thing
Engin Terzi: He said 50-50. He said they're very close. I kind of forgot because he was very long. Yeah, so let's go to the last two matches. Last two matches. Dadikyan versus Todd Hutchings. Alizhan. Who? Dadikyan and Todd Hutchings. Todd Hutchings?
Alizhan Muratov: Last time Khachat surprised me very well with his fight with his friends. Because of this, I can also say that it will be a very interesting fight. Also 50-50, I will say. Both have good hooks, it will be interesting.
Engin Terzi: He said both are very good on inside. He believes it's 50-50. I have a question for Ali Can. Ali Can, normally your left arm is your better arm. You even win in the WAF wars in the super heavyweight. But you were very strong at the WAF with right arm as well. You had war with Sandris. You had a war with...
Engin Terzi: uh reno i think you beat reno in the first match and where do you see your right arm alijan do you see your right arm like at the top level in the 105 kilo at the east versus west like who do you who would you want to pull with right arm in 105 kilo with uh right arm
Raimonds Liepins: At the World Cup, you showed a great result with your right hand. You had a great match with Sanders and with Rino. How do you feel about your right hand now at 105kg in the Easters West category? Is there anyone you want to try? What do you think? Your left hand is always much better than your right hand, but now we see that the right hand is also good.
Alizhan Muratov: It used to hurt. Now I'm preparing it by force. The result is increasing because of this pain. What can I say now?
Alizhan Muratov: I would be ready to fight with Rino Mask, with Andres. I think I have enough resources to fight with them. You can win. I think I won Mask once. Yes. And you can say that you can fight bravely. I don't spend a lot of time on the right hand.
Alizhan Muratov: Because the left is their priority. That's why they try not to lose a lot of energy. But she's kind of on the general... Well, let's say, you fight with both hands, you do it like this, like this, it's kind of pulled up. But I definitely don't spend time on it. Like this.
Raimonds Liepins: he said that uh he used to have a lot of pain a lot of injuries and a lot of a lot of weird stuff with his right arm so he prioritized his left arm in training now he does it a little less he trains his right arm as well uh but he said like not with the priority that he trains his left arm uh but he says he does all the same exercise with both arms so it's always getting trained but he believes it's getting better and better and he would love to have a like match with Rino or or Saunders he said
Engin Terzi: I could definitely give the match to both two of the WAF guys. But not in 105 kilos. Those guys are normally heavier than Ali Can. He knows that the 105 kilo guys and...
Engin Terzi: Okay, never mind. There is a super chat. DB Talks, thank you for your super chat. The world rankings say Prudnik is number two overall left because he beat Dadikyan. Does Prudnik agree with this? If not, where does he rank himself? My friend, I don't know who is making those kind of rankings, but they don't really use logic because when Dadikyan pulled Morozov, he was like over 115 kilos.
Engin Terzi: but when Dari can pull Prudnik he went down to 105 kilo so it is not the same guy you know when you are losing 10 12 kilos you know for a super match you cannot really uh judge that match for the overall ranking uh uh prudnik do you see yourself number two in the world with left arm in the open category
Alizhan Muratov: What do you think is your ranking on the left-hand side of the world? I don't think it's second. Absolutely not. I think it's somewhere on the right.
Engin Terzi: I mean, he lost against Tobias, you know. If he lost against Tobias, then Tobias should be number two, and then he should be. And then Tobias lost to Vitaly Laletin. I don't know who's making those rankings. He said that, of course, he doesn't feel like he's number two. He said, of course, he's like maybe top ten. He said maybe. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, the logic, anyone who has a little bit of brain would just think that way. And, yeah, that's good that he's not flying, you know. But, of course, he is…
Engin Terzi: We will see. He may be the best. He may be the second best in 105 kilos. We have to ask him about Dadikyan and Hutchings. Yeah, ask him. That's very important. Alizhan, this is the last one. And then we have Morozov, Kurdecha, and we finish. Because Alizhan needs to sleep. Yes. Prudnik, Todd Hutchings versus Dadikyan on the right hand. Todd Hutchings.
Alizhan Muratov: I thought that Hutchings, even if he takes it from the 130 kg of ligaments, I thought that even if he can win or do something,
Alizhan Muratov: I thought that at least he could hold Sagan's hand. It was such a pity. How did he turn it over? Well, it's just that he has a special technique, when the hunter is on such a peculiar ... You have to fight several times to analyze how he fights.
Alizhan Muratov: And it even surprised me that he had a weak spot at the start of the match. When they started, it didn't mean anything. But it was Sanya who started the match very quickly. He started the match faster than me in some rounds. He started the match faster because he worked with mistakes. I think at the moment everyone is talking about
Alizhan Muratov: We do this because we want to help our students.
Raimonds Liepins: He said that what Hutchings showed in a match with Sago was very impressive for Prudnik. He believes that Hutchings is the favorite. The only thing that was kind of weak for him is the start. And even then he catched him and pulled him back from some incredible positions and gave him a crazy match. And he believes Sago is extremely strong. And he said with Daddy Kane, we know Daddy Kane's left is better than his right. So Hutchings is the favorite.
Engin Terzi: And the last match, Alex Kurdecha, Morozov, Alex. Left hand. Left hand, yeah, left hand, world title. Put it like, come on, you are in a card, East versus West, 11, you don't know who's pulling right, who's pulling left. Kurdecha, how many kilos? Kurdecha now is probably 165, 165 kilos.
Alizhan Muratov: Putting sake, he got confused. He said most likely Morozov gonna win. Morozov is gonna win, okay.
Alizhan Muratov: And Prudnik? Yeah, Morozov has more chance on left hand. Morozov has more chance? On left hand, yeah. But how he beat him, inside, outside? Outside, outside. Outside? Yeah, outside versus outside. So you are saying that Morozov will top roll?
Engin Terzi: Wow. I will be surprised. I will be surprised, yeah. We will see. Yeah. And Alizhan, I have a question for you before we finish. If on January 20th, if Kurdecha or Morozov would be your opponent instead of Prudnik,
Raimonds Liepins: Would you have a chance, if yes, how much? If your opponent in the next match wasn't Prudnik, but Kurdecha or Morozov, how many chances do you think you'll have to win? Percentage? I'm not giving you a prediction.
Alizhan Muratov: Well, I can say that I try to be responsible for all my fights so that there is a great opportunity to win the opponent. He said it's hard to put like a percentage on it or chances, but he said to any match I'm going in, I'm always thinking I'm there to win and I'm giving everything a hand. Yeah, OK.
Engin Terzi: And there is one question Mika says that Kurdecha beat Tobias easier than Morozov did. Morozov beat Tobias left arm, Kurdecha beat Tobias right arm, you know. Anyways, thank you very much guys. Prudnik, thank you and I wish you the best and with the preparation and everything. And the same Alizhan, I wish you the best my friend. Preparation, get ready, be healthy and then I see you guys in
Raimonds Liepins: Four weeks, less than four weeks. Thank you. Is there anything that they want to say, the last words? Can you just ask them?
Alizhan Muratov: Thank you very much, good luck to you, excellent preparation. And to you, Yigin Terzi, in the organizational moments, so that East-West will flourish, so that we are recognizable, so that everything is bright and so that people like it all.
Raimonds Liepins: said uh i wanted to wish everyone a good preparation uh and for next year he wants uh uh to thank you engen and uh to hope that uh this will keep on going so our missing gets bigger we get bigger and everything gets better by the way when you go back your chest everything looks big huh thanks
Alizhan Muratov: Thank you, Andrey, for the organization, thank you for the beautiful fight. I wish you prosperity and the development of this festival, of our sport. And today I was thinking about the draw, about the victory.
Alizhan Muratov: You know, it doesn't matter if you win or lose. It's not the most important thing to win or lose. The most important thing is to participate, to get pleasure from the fight. The most important thing is that you can look at the sunset, at the sunrise, breathe this air. It doesn't matter if you win or lose. So don't worry.
Raimonds Liepins: So he said, I'll translate this. He said, of course, thanks everyone for organizing and making this bigger, making our sport bigger. And he said, then I was thinking about what's important in life. Is it winning and losing and put on so much on winning and losing? And he said, but it's the small things in life and it's most important is to compete. So Aljan shouldn't get mad when he loses.
Engin Terzi: Alizhan, any comment? No comment. I am night go training gym. Yeah, okay. You will comment? I am go no sleep. I am go gym. You go gym, okay. And then you will comment in Istanbul, right? Yes, yes. Allah see. I am in gym now.
Engin Terzi: Oh, yeah. Yeah. That is our superstar. Bravo. Bravo, Pritnik. Bravo, Alizhan. You guys are superstars. Superstars. The world needs to know you guys. You guys are incredible. And I am a fan of both of you. Thank you, guys. And thank you, Ramos, for the translation. And thank you to everyone who watched us. See you guys in four weeks. And we will rock again.
