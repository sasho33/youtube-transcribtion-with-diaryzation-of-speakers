Engin Terzi: See, people say Arsene's English is great enough. And one guy said that, Arsene, you are explaining just fine right now. So everyone is saying, Arsene, you speak. No, Engin, you know that one interesting thing I can explain and
Arsen Liliev: Only one man can understand all things that I say. It's only you because... No, everybody understands. No. Come on, come on. No, if we haven't translator, we must stop this podcast. No, no, no, no, no, no. Everything is good. Yeah. See, Rui says, hello, Arsene. Thank you for the effort of speaking in English. See? And...
Engin Terzi: Other one, Andrei Volkov, let's go full English by Arsen. See, everybody wants to listen. Ermes was the same, but now he speaks so good. All is fine. Okay, so I want to, yesterday, Prudnik was my guest, Prudnik. And I asked him, Arsen Liliyev is coming back, you know, what can he do in 105 kilos? He said, the level is different now. So he thinks that you don't have a chance.
Arsen Liliev: so but now i i don't think about guys like prudnik i think i know i know i know but in the future future like one year later maybe one and a half year later no no no now i think only about my first match then we maybe maybe okay this guy our brother he cried he will crush me and i stopped
Engin Terzi: Yeah. So yeah, but, but remember, remember whenever I said, I told you, okay, I said the Pauline versus Iraq, the gum 10 as a match.
Arsen Liliev: And then you said, I can even now go and beat both of them one after the other. Yes, yes. And now you are saying like, oh, let's see if I can. Yes, yes. Because in the past, I was Arsene Lille like a great champion 2008. Now I'm a student. Now I only...
Engin Terzi: and i only come back so i can't say anything but that's not what you said you said even now no training arsene would beat pauline and uh so i thank you you know so you made a mistake you made me no no no no why mistake i i can't beat anybody now okay
Engin Terzi: Okay. I thought that you said you can beat them now. I remember you and you said you could beat. You can beat them now or you cannot beat them now. I don't understand. Thank you. We need translator. Okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. You saw what Brett Grundy write, right? Yes. Yeah. He wants to pull you.
Arsen Liliev: No, I want to say thanks to this guy. We never competed in the past, so it's very, very pleasure to me that he will be my opponent in my match when I will come back. Oh, you accept it? No, if I... No, no, no, listen, listen. If you come back, you will accept it?
Engin Terzi: Yes, yes, yes. Okay, okay. One second. Hello, Brad. Arsene accepts to pull you on April 20th. Okay, okay. The match is set. Okay, thank you. Okay. So, we need translator. I don't understand what you said. No, no, I'm joking. I am acting. I know. Okay, if you know it, don't all the time say we need translator. You understood what I am doing.
Arsen Liliev: No, Engin, I can understand anything that you say, but it's really difficult to me to explain what I want to say. So I can say only yes, no, I think... Okay, can I ask you something? Travis Benjamin also didn't pull for many years. On April 20th, can you be with Travis again? Right hand? Yeah. We can do this much in January if you want. Right hand.
Engin Terzi: Without trade in January, right hand, Travis and I. Listen, don't say that you joke later. I'm going to call him. Right hand. Right hand. Okay, call him. Okay, okay. I will ask him. Yeah, okay. I will ask him. Maybe not now, but I will ask him. Yeah. He's going to come anyways to Istanbul.
Engin Terzi: In January, yes. Yeah, yeah, he will be commentator. No, he's very good commentator, yes. He is? I think he is. Yeah. Anyway, so, Arsene, when you beat Travis in 2009, what was the power difference, honestly? Between... Between... You and him.
Arsen Liliev: So, Enki, really, I think that Travis didn't train to that super much. That's not what I'm asking. I'm asking what was the power difference? It's... I don't understand. What was the... How much power difference? How many percent? Between me and Travis? Between me and Travis? Yeah, that's what I am, yeah. Oh, I'm here. Travis is not here, absolutely. So it was like this?
Arsen Liliev: yes but it's only right hand and because travis travis i think travis not trained to to that super much okay okay travis is travis is very very very uh through them it's good dangerous dangerous opponent when he's in in good shape when he's ready right yeah yes yeah yeah but on that day he was not close
Arsen Liliev: You were also a referee. I was a referee, I'm just asking what you felt. What I saw was like this, but what you felt was also a big difference. Really, really, again, Kravitz is a good man, but in this Supermatch I can't feel anything, yes, really, it's different, yes.
Engin Terzi: I can't say this about my supermatch with John Brzenk, because I... It was close. Yes, yes. When he stopped you, when he stopped you, even one round, he took your wrist. And maybe you remember that I said that nobody broke my wrist before. Yeah, before John, yeah. On the strips, on the strips. Yeah, yeah. He stopped you, and first I think you took his wrist, and then from here...
Arsen Liliev: He applied pronator, and your wrist was back. Yes, yes. And you remember that I said that how Taras, how he lost to John Brzenk. He broke his wrist, and then from here, John broke Taras' back. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I remember. And he...
Engin Terzi: the same thing with me too yeah yeah yeah yeah i think he he was very experienced about that kind of pulling style uh with uh pulling against taras taras was all time taking his wrist but he was also yes but but taras but taras side pressure i think is not so good no taras is only pronation yes yes yes yes yeah
Engin Terzi: He didn't have so much pressure with here, only with here, not here, yeah. Maybe, maybe, maybe like Vitaly Laletin, how do you think? No, Vitaly is still, you know, Vitaly is still hitting, you know, like side, like this, he hits, but still with pronator, but he hits, like Taras was like more like... Ah, yes, yes, yes, yes. Yeah, pulling, like only muscle weight, you know, yeah, yeah.
Engin Terzi: But Taras was one of the best top rollers that I have ever seen here. And I remember his match with Gennady. By the way, is Alain Carré still alive? Yes. How old is he now? He was 18 years old in 1996.
Arsen Liliev: like 44 or something yes maybe yes yes yes but maybe between 50 no 54 no i think maybe 50 56 or 46 48
Engin Terzi: No, no, no, no, no, no. He was 18 years old in 96. And I was 22 years old. He was four years younger than me. So 1978. So he's probably 45 or something. This year will be maybe. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He's like, yeah. So let's, and, and did you see him any recently?
Arsen Liliev: One time, I think, one year ago, I think. He is big, very big still? No, no, no. He had a big problem, you know. Health problems? Yes, with heart, heart. Oh, so he lost weight? Operation, and he lost, I think he lost maybe, serious, maybe 80 kilograms.
Engin Terzi: He lost 80 kilos. 8-0, yes. So what is his now, 130, 120? 120, I think, maybe. So he was 200 kilos and now 120 kilos. Yes. Okay. And his health now is okay? I think no. No good? No health? No good? He needs one operation in Germany. Oh, he needs one more, okay. One more operation to his heart. Okay, I understand.
Engin Terzi: Yeah. See, everyone is saying your English is good. Yeah, that's good. And I asked the same thing to Ermes. Before you, Ermes was my guest. And I want to also tell you, like, the athletes, they will come back, compete this year. And then athletes that have competed already, East versus West,
Engin Terzi: What do you think about this list, Arsene? Like you have been competing for, like you had competed since what, 2002 maybe? When did you start? My first competition, 2004, is Republic, our Republic, yes. And since then, you know armwrestling. Evgeny you didn't compete, you follow. Of course. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: So these are the athletes that will compete East versus West this year and before already. What do you think about this level of organization? I'm asking you. I'm going to count. I will count you the names. Levan Saginajvili, Devon Larat, Denis Siplenko, Ermes Kasparini, Jerica Doret, John Brzenk, Vitaly Laletin, Gennady Kvikvinia, Georgi Svetkov, Alex Kurdecha, Artem Morozov, Michael Todd, Georgi Dizgaranov,
Engin Terzi: Ivan Matyushenko, Devchefi, Arif Artem, Ferid Osman, Zaur Payzule, Wagner Bortolato, Kuri West, Serhii Kalinyshenko, Kody Merit, Kamil Jablonski, Rewaz Lutiz, Frank Lamparelli, Krasimir Kostadinov, Basho Saginashvili, Chance Cho, Kedirgale Ongarbev, Tata Sinks, David Dadikyan, Ibrahim Sagov,
Engin Terzi: The list is going like this. What do you think?
Arsen Liliev: So great champions, what I must say, between last year and now? Yeah, last two years, last two years, yeah. Oh, thank you. You know, you know that it's different, yes, it's different levels, because...
Arsen Liliev: Again, for this question, if we have now a translator, I can explain all things about what I think about your band. If now we have a translator. Now, really, it's very difficult for me to explain. But, you know, I said you before that when I come back to the
Arsen Liliev: to the house and many many guys with the great champions in armwrestling i said really said that this event is the great event that i watched any anywhere oh
Arsen Liliev: You mean the greatest event you have ever seen? Yes, yes, in November, in November. Oh, the East vs West 10? No, I was only on one event. I didn't know that you were talking about the videos you watched or you were talking about the one event? No, you know, videos and when you're on the competition with another, yes, with another sportsman, it's...
Arsen Liliev: It's different. My heart is broken. My plan was to bring you here. When you watch, you will be like, oh, I want to do it again. I think after five days after this event, I wrote you something, yes? Yeah. Five days. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You said you started training, right? Yes.
Engin Terzi: We don't know, you and me, we don't know what will be, but now I'm training a little. Yeah, yeah. And you already are very good. You are beating your students already, you said. Kellan Trans, thank you for your support, my friend. Yeah, yeah. It will be great, great, great, great to see you. You know, all those names that I counted, that are like, it was the health of the list.
Engin Terzi: And I want to see Arsene Liliyev, because this is the golden time of armwrestling. And someone like you needs to be part of it. Part of this time, you know. And if you become, if you get that belt in this time, it will be probably maybe the biggest thing, you know.
Arsen Liliev: You think if after 10 years I... Yes, yes, you can. Of course. How old are you? What are you talking about? 36, yes. But, you know, Engin, I started very early years. I won many championships when I was 20 years. So, and I don't know. I can't say anything. I want, serious, I want. But we don't know.
Engin Terzi: Yeah. Yeah. We will see. We will see. It will be, I mean, I believe you. I believe you. Look at, look at Tatasik. He started when he was 35. He was like skinny guy. I remember he was 80 kilo. I competed the same event with him. He was 80 kilo. I pulled Dave Patton in 70 kilo. It's the same event. I also beat Travis Bledsoe in the absolute category. And yeah, with left arm. Yeah. And
Engin Terzi: Tatasin couldn't do anything. I think he lost two times. 2001, like Halepul, 22 years, 23 years ago.
Arsen Liliev: You know, I don't know how it's working, but you know, the guys from Europe, European champions, they can't compete after 30 years, I think. Only maybe you. So Aymeric guys, he champions in 40 years, 50 years.
Engin Terzi: But it is because Eastern guys, they put themselves like a mental limit. Oh, I do this much now, I get older, let the young guys do. But the Aymeric, they never accept that they get old. Look at Ron Beth. He's 1962. So he's like 62 years old this year, he will be. John, 59. And 57 years old, Todd Hutchings.
Engin Terzi: And Jerry Cadoret is probably 51, 50-51. Michael Todd is also 50. Barboza, 50. And Devon, Devon. I don't know how Devon. Devon is 47. So what I just stated. It is only the mental barrier. Sorry, Engin. Devon is 40, 40. Devon, Devon. Yeah, 48, yeah. Oh, 48.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, I'm 49. Yeah, he's 48. 1974 and 1975. And I think Barboza and Jerry and Michael Todd, 73. And, yeah, I don't know how. Like, especially Tatachins. Like, how many times did you pull Tatachins? Only one time? Supermatch? No, and on Nimirov. I think it was 2011.
Arsen Liliev: 2010, 2012, 2011, I don't remember, yes. In the overall championship, overall category? No, 95 kilograms. In 95 kilos? And he took what, second place to you? Second place, yes. He beat all guys in 95 kilograms. Zambulat, Zorov, many, many guys, good categories. I understand.
Engin Terzi: wow yeah this is impressive you know it's impressive who did you think that was gonna win on that or before the match thank you i think i uh i know about arm wrestling maybe maybe a little but i know arm wrestling no no no you know a lot what is that don't be so so humble you know a lot yeah
Arsen Liliev: I explain you. I think on Garbaev, Todd Hutchings, maybe 5-1 or 6-0, something like that. I think Denis beat Devon. And who is there?
Engin Terzi: Devon, Todd Hutchings. And Zaur? Zaur and Georgie was? No, Zaur and Georgie 50-50. Baba, do you remember when you meet Devon Larratt in the hotel? You look at Larratt, you said...
Engin Terzi: on the photographs and videos you don't look this big but now you are like huge and you say now now i changed my mind maybe 50 years yes yes yes yes yes yes ah and i and i thought that john the john queen
Arsen Liliev: With Sasho. Yeah, Sasho, yeah, yeah, yeah. But I think John has maybe some problem with his shoulder because he absolutely having side pressure. But he also lost like more than 10 kilos. Yes, yes, yes. And you know, 59 years, he's not joking. Yeah. Just say that if John wants to pull you in August, would you say yes or no?
Engin Terzi: So now, first of all, we must win the first match. But do you think that if you beat Brad, the next step, John, is too much, just say like four months after the April?
Arsen Liliev: Is it John? I don't know. Maybe after six years or six months or eight months, maybe on my weights and in my power, I will be like an Arsene Leif, like 2012. Maybe. So I can say to Engin, I want to pull with Devon 150 kilograms. Devon said to me that if you want 150 kilograms, we must do this much. Yeah. I have a question.
Engin Terzi: like best of arsene lily 2000 like early 2012 you know like when you when you pulled it when was that day when you pulled those eight men category you know like you know in bulgaria you krasimir tatashins john was it your best shape you think no no no no no my best my best shape i think it's it's not shape yes but my best shape when you lost against dennis
Engin Terzi: yes when i won one time push car and yes yes yes a1 a1 i think okay so that shape that shape with that shape would you challenge today's devon in 115 kilo 115 yes you would challenge him yeah of course when when i have the the shape that shape that shape yeah yes yes wow because because because right now
Arsen Liliev: in 2012 i think i think really it's yeah it's really i think that i can beat devon i i i i don't i didn't think that devon is very dangerous opponent for me i but for michael todd i think that it is the my my the most dangerous opponent because his kink move is very difficult for my style so
Arsen Liliev: So right now, nobody believes that under 115 kilos, somebody can beat Devon. I mean, maybe some people believe, but right now, they say no. Enkin, Enkin, anybody think that in 2012 or 2011, anybody can beat guys like Denis or Andrei Pushkal when my weight, for example, was 95 kilograms?
Engin Terzi: so it's it's important yeah yeah yeah yeah but but listen like could you beat dennis fresh no no no no so we're talking about super match fresh matches but that's why i'm saying but like like so do you think that fans should hope that you can come back and be a serious dangerous opponent for
Arsen Liliev: Devon, maybe. Thank you. You know that if, for example, if I will come back and if I will win first match, then second match, and maybe you know that I want one more match in my career, you know what I want with one guy. Arsene, your picture video is gone. Can you go out and come back again? Can you do that? Because we don't see you now. It's just when you're black. Okay. Okay? Okay.
Engin Terzi: uh-huh okay he came yeah yeah good good no no i understand you what you are saying is that i want to come back let me see where i am and then yes yes but this and that that is mind how about your heart oh again your heart wants to come and crush everybody
Engin Terzi: Maybe not heavyweight because now heavyweight is... No, no, not super heavyweight. Those super heavyweights are at a different level. Yes, yes, yes. Some categories like 115 kilograms, yes, was great. 105 and 115, two categories. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Have you ever lost Ivan Matyushenko?
Arsen Liliev: yes one time I lost it was now I say it was near of 2007 I beat in first match yeah yeah but you were you were 78 kilo then no 78 kilograms I I beat in first match Ruslan Babaev he was champion 86 kilograms then I beat Yonanchesko he was champion in 100 kilograms and in third match it was with
Engin Terzi: Whenever you gained weight, over 80-85 kilos, how many times did you win against Ivan? Many times, I think maybe 4-5 times. Have you ever lost against Laletin? No. And you beat Laletin many times as well? Yes. When we met him, I beat him of course.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, but what was the heaviest of Laletin when you beat him? 100 kilo maximum? Yes, 100, 100. When he was 100 kilo? Okay. Yes. I understand. Yeah. I mean, maybe the young guys, some of the young guys may not know about you. So, yeah. And whenever you imagine like to make a comeback, do you have a dream match around your category?
Arsen Liliev: You know it, you know it. Of course. It's like, yes. Because it's not, we must do it one more time, one more time after 10 years. Yeah. Yeah. I told him this. I told him that he was my guest together with John. And then, yeah, I said, listen, Arsene, maybe, maybe coming back, you know, and if he comes back,
Engin Terzi: you both be ready i said to john and uh yeah and what and what and what they say they were saying okay you know yeah i don't exactly remember but yeah they were happy that you you were coming back you know and and another question arsene um after the east versus west 10 you went and you start training and since then exactly two months passed
Engin Terzi: Artem you satisfied with the gains, like with your progress? Artem you satisfied, like is it going better than you were thinking or worse than you thinking? Like how is it? Like two months passed, are you happy with the results?
Arsen Liliev: Engin, one clever man said to me that Arsene, don't do your exercises like you're now a champion, only enjoy your training. So now, yes. You know this guy? It's very smart. I see myself from the, yeah. I know you're playing with the waist, but like more you do, more you like, you know,
Arsen Liliev: you know it's good that you know i decided to train do you enjoy yes i enjoy my weights but again i have so many years pain in my elbows so now for example on the table uh i very careful careful yes careful yeah you're very careful yeah i don't know i don't know one one of the things that was very surprising to me that you didn't do a lot of table time but you did
Arsen Liliev: most of it was like weight you know you know uh i every time i'm training the the most focus my focus on on the weights i'm not like john brzenk who has many many times many a lot of time on the table walk yeah yes i like iron i like weights so yeah but remember like at the beginning of your career you were very good even in the about the long matches
Engin Terzi: and then later you were only like only like flash pin flash pin flashing and but you know that the super matches you know of course you if you do flash pin is good but sometimes you may need andrews as well you know uh do you think that your strategy will be only like
Engin Terzi: quick finish, quick finish, quick finish, but just say that you have someone like Ruslan Baba, you took the risk and then you need to like, and then your career beginning, you were a top roller, pure top roller, super top roller. And then it suddenly became more like, you know, side pressure, you know, side with the risk. And then
Engin Terzi: you little bit little bit lost like your pure top roll ability um do you think that like you will be having both side pressure and top roll together or you plan on the side pressure and fast finish as before now now now i think that uh
Arsen Liliev: Now I want Arsene to leave only top role, not side pressure. I want to do something like in the 2005 Wiesgaschews. I remember you, even 2007, very good, very good.
Engin Terzi: top role you had it remember at the side table i was with john brisson yes and you were 78 kilo and in the same category yonchescu was the world champion on 90 kilo and in 95 kilo category he he was second place i think and then you you put him overall and you hold him and look at his race and easily beat him yeah i remember
Engin Terzi: yeah it was it was just his style is very comfortable for me you know i very like guys uh he's more like speed like he was going like you know yeah yeah i don't know um anyways arsene uh would you share your opinions about
Arsen Liliev: the upcoming East vs. West. David you look at the card? You know who are there? Which matches did you check? Yes, but yes, yes, yes. Of course, you have a very good event, but maybe you can ask what is the main match. Oh, you don't know about every match, but some of the matches?
Engin Terzi: Can you say that? Okay. I will tell you the matches and then you say, okay, I mean, I do this. And if not, then you say, let's do the next one. You understand? Okay. Okay. So I will ask you. Do you remember? He had a super. I know, I know this guy, but I don't know who is, I'm sorry. Who is this guy? Yeah. I don't know. I mean,
Engin Terzi: I need the charger. Sorry. Nurdalet Aidarkhan is the Hibit Mindaugas for the world title of the lightweight from Kazakhstan. And I, Zolaev Haji Muratov, and this guy won WAF five different categories.
Engin Terzi: His guy won in three different categories? Five. Oh, five. I won five different categories in WAF. Zolev Hazimov won and also this guy won five different categories. And he also beat in 2022 World Championships, he beat Daniel Prokofiev as well. Right hand, he's just like very explosive guy, you know, very explosive guy. And...
Engin Terzi: Yeah, and I want to show maybe if you remember, maybe you look at him, maybe you will remember. Okay, never mind. So if you don't know, I go to the next one. Yes. Okay. Oleg Petrenko, Marcio Barboza. Oh, it will be a great match, but I think maybe Petrenko, he will win.
Engin Terzi: Arsene, you again became dark, my friend. Can you come back again? Sorry, my friend, but it's dark. Welcome back, yeah. So you're thinking Petrenko?
Arsen Liliev: yes he's younger he's very very strong hook so i think he will win but right hand or left hand right right right hand i think petrenko will win yes okay and i'm eric versus rabitapi okay uh iraq is rakashvili pauline oh it will be great much
Arsen Liliev: but you know i think iraqli uh now i watched him he's much i think he's very very good top roller and i i'm i'm sure that he beat pauline oh you think he's gonna beat pauline yes it's it i think my opinion sorry guys but my opinion it's not the close much i think yeah see richard richard
Engin Terzi: Gamrad, he wanted me to, he reminded me that, you know, Nurdalet, the Kazakh guy, I said the five different category world champion. I asked him only a few days ago. He was my guest. I said, who are your favorite arm wrestlers? He said, John Brzenk and Arsen Liliyev. Sorry, sorry, but Engin, I'm not so following. No, no, no, I'm not saying anything. The guy is actually pulling like you do, very fast, explosive.
Engin Terzi: No, no, I just wanted to say this now. There is no problem. Thanks for his opinion for me. Thanks. And so let's go to the next one. With right arm. Wagner, Bortolato, Matt Mask. Right arm.
Arsen Liliev: Oh, you know, I very, I very like Matt Mask style. I very like what he do on the table, in near table. So I think, but Wagner Bartolotta is power, power like a horse. And I don't know, but I think, but I think Matt Mask, he can beat him. Yes.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, Wagner's normally left arm is better arm. Yes, I know Wagner, but you know, I think in 2005, 2007 in 110 kilograms, he was the best left hand. Yeah, I think he won 2006 Manchester Vapors. Yeah, and also 2007, I think in Bulgaria. Possible. 2012 also in Brazil. When you had a final with Krasimir.
Engin Terzi: Yes. Yeah. Okay. Can you beat MadMagic? Now I think no. Okay.
Arsen Liliev: and but my mask is really good good good opponent for me for example for second match in uh okay first match is brad groundy second match is madman but yes anger we're speaking about my opponents in the future but we don't know how i what i what i can do with this guy with bread maybe he beat me and
Engin Terzi: And my career in armwrestling stopped for a time. It is all about just good time, you know, nothing serious right now. Yes. Don't worry about it, yeah. Artem Taino versus Zurab Tavberidze, left arm world title. Oh, you know...
Arsen Liliev: Only one guy from Europe, Artyom Taynov, he's like an Aymeric guy. Now he's, I think he's 36, maybe 35 years, but what I watched on your event in November, he beats Samushia three times, three different styles, you understand? Topie roll, hook, cyber without priest. So he means that he is well-rounded, he can do many things.
Arsen Liliev: yes yes yes yes yes so that's why you are saying he's like american is this because yes the americans also can do many different ways yes yes and uh i said it because i think uh now our time time off is better than then we competed together i think now is our time better than in the past
Arsen Liliev: So, European champions, for years, for years, he goes and only Artyom goes up. Oh, okay. So, I understand. I understand what you mean. Okay. And who's winning? Artem or Zurab? Left arm? I think maybe, I think maybe hook by hook, it will be the close match. But Artyom, he can do many, many things on the table. So, you are saying that
Arsen Liliev: because he can find a weakness. Yes, he can do for one round, two, another round, different things. So, for example, in first match, for example, hook by hook and Zurab beat him. In the second match, Artem do top roll or something another. And we know that Zurab is the great champion by hook.
Engin Terzi: What if Zurab takes him in every round, every round, every round? Oh, it's a very interesting match. If it will be all rounds by hook, I think 50-50. I understand, yeah. We will see, we will see. I think this is going to be a great one. And let's go to the next one. This one probably you don't know. Do you know Avtandil Tutberidze? No.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, this guy is a 19-year-old Georgian, WAF senior champion, 85 kilo. And Oleg Zog won 80 kilo, so Oleg Zog and him, they will pull. Yes, left hand, yes. And Daniel Prokopchuk versus Minda Mindaugas Tarasaitis. I think Prokopchuk. In what category? 75? 75, yeah.
Arsen Liliev: I think Prokopchuk will win, yes. To watch his matches is very good to my eyes and to my arm wrestling, yes. Because he is a great champion, he can do all things and he has a great hook. Do you know who is your biggest fan in the world?
Engin Terzi: Yeah, I think yes. Young guy from Georgia. Yes. Yeah. Misho Meladze. Can you say Misho Meladze? Hello. Hello. Misho Meladze. Misho Meladze. Hello. Hello. I speak him by telephone too. Yeah. You know, the guy, the guy, even it has nothing to do with your podcast, YouTube. He all time Arsene, Arsene, Arsene, Arsene. Oh, look, look who is here. Brad.
Engin Terzi: Grandi. Hello, Brett. Hello, Brett. Yeah, Brett Grandi. Yeah, Brett Grandi personally told me that he will beat you so badly that you will never want to see Armasinghe again. Maybe, maybe, maybe. Why not? Maybe. No, I'm joking. He didn't say this.
Arsen Liliev: So can you say, Brett Grande, how old is he? He's 40, 42? No, no, no, Brett Grande is young. Brett, how old are you, my friend? Okay, Brett Grande says he's 53. 53, so I thought... No, no, no, joking, joking.
Arsen Liliev: I'm 44. Joking. He said he's 26. Oh, serious? Yeah, 26. 10 years younger than you. So I think if I will come back, he beat me. Oh, you are scared? No, young guy. Young, powerful guy. Okay, should I find you an old guy? How about Todd Hutchings? He's very old. Crazy George is good. No, no, Todd Hutchings is 57. What do you think? No, Todd Hutchings is not good.
Engin Terzi: Maybe something like 78, 79 years. You have? Okay. Something inner-blasting. Yeah, I don't know. Okay, let's go to the next one. Do you know Vladimir Miro? Who? Miro? Miro, yeah.
Engin Terzi: From Russia? Yeah, originally, but he is in Germany now, I think. Do you know him? Yeah, he's a very strong guy, very strong guy. I think he won, yes? He won Moldova events. He beat Bozidar in the final, yeah. Yes. And he's going to pull David Samushia.
Arsen Liliev: I don't know. Anybody can beat Samushia in this weight category. Maybe Engin Terzi or maybe Haji Murad if he has good shape. What do you think about it? Do you think Sarmat can beat Samushia in Supermatch? Like six rounds?
Arsen Liliev: I don't know. I know David Samushia and I watch his opponents. And you know now Sarmat, he's competing only in Russia. Yeah.
Arsen Liliev: And it's hard. Sarmat is great. Sarmat is great. Like Alain Zoloft, yes. But I don't know. If you have $100, where do you put the money? On Sarmat or Samushia in Supermatch? Because I am from Assetta and Sarmat too, I said $100 to Sarmat. But if you ask me like in my heart, in my heart of Armistice, I said $100 to Samushia.
Engin Terzi: When you say, oh, you mean your heart or your mind? Your heart is rich. No, no, no. My heart too. Sarmat, my mind. Your mind is good. Okay. So in fact, you believe that Samushia is favorite? I think yes. Yeah. Okay. Let's go. Rino Matic, Ivan Matyushenko. Right hand. No, left arm world title, 115 kilo.
Arsen Liliev: Oh, I don't know how Ivan Matyushenko's left arm now, good or no. Oh, he's good, he's good. He's very good. Yes, now Matyushenko is great because he's with his good, good body. He has more power. And I think Ivan beat him.
Engin Terzi: I think you must maybe maybe in the future maybe in the future you must do something like Ivan Matyushenko at the Volorad to left hands how do you think yeah yeah yeah yeah for sure for sure and also I am thinking maybe Alizhan Muratov Matyushenko Evgeny Prudnik Matyushenko these are very good matches yeah and so who's winning do you know Rino
Engin Terzi: yes yes yes yes very strongly also 19 years old this year he will be 20. i think yeah he's from croatia croatia yes yeah okay john bersing versus krasimir costadino
Arsen Liliev: oh i i want to maybe maybe i want to uh come to your event only for this much because it's i don't know it's do you want me to buy your ticket
Arsen Liliev: no you know thank you my friend you know it's it's like arnold schwarzenegger sylvester stallone for me you know yeah yeah it's it's two great champions i don't know i don't know i don't know because john john uh 105 kilo 105 kilo not 95 kilo
Arsen Liliev: Yeah, I understand. I don't know how's Krasimir now. He's in good shape? He said he's in very good shape. He's in very good shape. He said this, yeah. So I think Krasimir beat him because then I watched in your event in November. Unfortunately, John Brzenk's side pressure is not good. Yeah, but he was 95 kilos. I understand, but I don't know. But you know that I think maybe Krasimir is not...
Arsen Liliev: is not bad who is stronger how do you think sasho or krasimir krasimir said that right now he is stronger than sasho so i think krasimir beat him he said he said that right now sasho takes his wrist with right arm and krasimir beats him like this i don't know but i think krasimir beat him yes okay
Arsen Liliev: Let's go. Artem Morozov, Alex Kurdecha, super heavyweight, left arm, world title. Very good match, very good match. Two very strong guys. I don't know if Kurdecha, he can do his top role, but I don't know. I don't know.
Arsen Liliev: then sorry hanging it's difficult to explain when i watched kurdecha the side table with uh yes with denis yes kurdecha i think good but i don't know marozov is great he's his power is great and i don't know how do you think explain your your opinion about i'm organizer
Engin Terzi: I saw your... I cannot. If I say this... You are director of Arman Eslik now. Yeah, but people say, oh, you say that this guy is going to win. So they say, why you said this match? If you think that way. I don't know everything. I think it's a good match. And if I say this, they say, oh, Engin wants this guy to win. You know, they will just... I mean, you wouldn't say this. You wouldn't say this.
Engin Terzi: But there are a lot of people with very loose mouths. They are looking for opportunity to throw some shit. And so I just stay away. Yeah. So this one is my favorite match.
Arsen Liliev: Alizhan Muratov, Evgeny Prudnik, left arm, 105 kilo world title match. Yes, great match. Incredible match for me. For me too, yes. But if I don't know, for right hand, Evgeny is super. For left hand, I don't know. He beat Dadikyan. Ah, yes, he beat Dadikyan, yes. But the more interesting thing,
Engin Terzi: He said right now he's 15% stronger than that time, he says. He said at that time he wasn't this strong right now. He said that right now he's very strong. And we know that Alizhan is also very strong. Yes, yes, yes. Hook by hook, yes, I think. What's that? Alizhan is hooker. I mean, yeah, he goes like...
Arsen Liliev: like high pressure, hook, you know, dragging. He does everything. He do this, he go bicep, he go like this, you know, like he does everything at the table. No, serious. Yeah, yeah, seriously. I don't know, I don't know. About this much I don't know because two very strong guys and we will see. I think you, you
Engin Terzi: You don't know about this match? No, nothing, nothing. I have no idea. Serious, serious. Yeah, yeah. I have no idea. Very soon we will find out and I will watch this match very closely, very closely. Yes. I may even go on the stage and watch close. And then the camera guy will say, go down. Yes, it will be great match. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: So you don't know anything about this match. So the last one. Tatachins versus David Dadikyan, right arm. Oh, Dadikyan is super strong, super strong. But in that... One second, one second. Oleg Alexandrov said, actually, Arsene can be a translator for other arm masters. His English is good enough. See?
Arsen Liliev: this is all about guys but confidence confidence you need to thank you guys but it's so difficult to me to explain and you you know i have some right because because my english is bad and i think all time that i can say something that people smile you understand now be confident my friend you are you are
Engin Terzi: a great arm master. What did you do? But yes, but maybe my English in the future. It doesn't matter. People, people respect you. You know, they cannot explain a guy from Russia, from Ossetia,
Engin Terzi: like to speak perfect english you know they cannot they should be happy that you are trying to express yourself and i respect this and i'm sure the people who watch this also respect and if anyone doesn't respect i mean just ignore them you know just forget it yeah yeah thank you thank you guys thank you yeah okay who's winning tatasins or dadikyan
Arsen Liliev: Engin, you know, 105 kilograms, yes? Yes, yes, yes, 105 kilograms. This is for world title, world title. I think Todd beat him. You think? Yes, yes, yes, yes. Because I think that he can left arm is better than his right arm, yes? I mean, we think that way, but the way that he beat Irakli Zirakashvili, did you see that match? Yes.
Arsen Liliev: He was very dominant with right arm. He beat Irakli easier than Ongarbe with Irakli. Ongarbe and Irakli had like war, you know. Yes, Engin, about this much. You know, I'm sure that you know this thing too. If Toth can stop him,
Arsen Liliev: stop i think yes i thought beat him i'm sure but but you know the thought is not so he's not verified very fast man so if that you can can beat him so if thought can stop him on this yes i think that will win yes yeah so you are saying that that again chance he needs to dominate him yes yes yes stop somewhere and then
Engin Terzi: And then you are saying that Todd is going to win that match. Because Todd, yes. Todd is like a tractor. Yeah, tractor. Yeah. Very strong. Very strong guy. But now, in the past, he was trying to hook like this.
Arsen Liliev: Now he uses his pronator. Yes, yes, yes. Tight pressure, yeah. And you know, before his match with Kadir Ghali, John, yes, we see, John, I think you and you, and John said that now Todd is something another because he can do something without straps, go with his pronator, and then on the straps he can do hook or side pressure and he can do many things.
Engin Terzi: I remember you were sitting there, John was sitting by you, and I was sitting on the way. And John said that he is in a different level. And John said that Ongar Bey will feel something that he has not felt before in his life. Yes, yes, yes. You remember? Yeah. And you know, I want to say one thing.
Arsen Liliev: You know, in 2012 in Bulgaria, I beat Todd 3-0. 3-0. And we have too much with strips. Yeah. You don't understand that, yes? Yeah, yeah. Against Todd?
Arsen Liliev: Against that, I beat him 3-0, so I'm a champion. So I'm a champion. 3-0. Was it not like six rounds? I think you beat him four times. Four, four, yes. Yeah, you beat him four times. And then you said that you want two matches on the strips. Yeah, this was final match, yeah. Five match and final match, yes. And like said John, that I never...
Arsen Liliev: feel uh so strong i beat him yes on the strips too but but he's he's very strong really he's very strong i don't know so you whenever you were in the strap with him you felt something different yes but yes but we we we i think we didn't start it i'm i'm yes yes yes did you get an elbow foul or something first
Arsen Liliev: Maybe, maybe. I don't know. Because after 4-0, it doesn't matter for me. You didn't care. Yeah, I understand. So, okay. Okay. And the last one. Will Devon beat Levan next match? Never. Never. Serious, guys. Sorry, guys. If anybody, one time, if anybody from Canada or from North Aymeric, one, two, three, ten,
Arsen Liliev: 10,000, we can, all this money, for example, 5,000 for me to, and from another guy from North Aymeric, I take Levan Saginashvili. So you are saying that if anybody wants to bet money, you are ready to bet money on Levan? Serious, serious. If anybody from North Aymeric want one, two, three, $5,000, not problem.
Engin Terzi: Not a problem. All money to Engin and then who will win? No, no, no, no. I'm not going to be even part of it. It is against my policy. No, no, no. Okay, not part. But maybe anybody must be a guarantor. You understand? Okay. I mean, if they want us to do something, they can come to Istanbul, you and him. You can talk directly. But in Apple, you will also have a match and Brett Grundy is going to kick your ass. I understand. Sorry.
Engin Terzi: I'm just saying that if anybody wants to bet money with you about Devon versus Levan match, they can come to Istanbul and meet you. And you guys can talk to each other. It's not my thing. But in the same event, Istanbul event, you will have match with Brett Grundy. And you will be concentrated Brett Grundy match more than money betting. And I say Brett Grundy is going to kick your ass. Oh, I understand.
Engin Terzi: You know, I'm a businessman. Money here, money here, it's not a problem. Okay. So you are saying that if anybody wants to lose money, they can reach Arsene Liliev? Yes, yes, yes. If they think that they have too much money, you are saying, listen, what if, what if Devon stops that match? Just boom, you see it, just stop. The endurance...
Engin Terzi: You know, they had like very, very, very horror movies, like movies, scary movies, you know, film, you know. But imagine as an arm master, Devon stops you. Isn't it very scary, you know, like fearful? Yes. Yeah, because he's going to hold you, start talking with you.
Arsen Liliev: know he's not gonna pin you he will be like this he will talk you know devon in this uh aspect of in this thing devon is great yes but i don't know how how um you know you know i try to explain you if anybody

Engin Terzi: you hear me no i don't watch you you don't you don't see me yeah there is one thing that's okay anyway so somebody called and they just get like this but do you hear me yes okay let's continue a little bit because we are finishing so you are saying that levan is superior about everything he's genetic he's training he doesn't have money problems you know yes you are saying that basically
Engin Terzi: everything in his in his advantage that's what you are saying yes yes thank you yes indeed yeah i understand yeah anyway so i understand but don't you think that devon is now in dangerous shape what if he cracks that one's wrist
Arsen Liliev: So, then Levan has problems, yes, of course, Engin. It's of course, but I don't think that Devon can stop Levan. You don't think? Engin, Engin. And you know, for the heavyweight guy, Levan is a very speed guy. Fast, huh? Fast, fast, sorry. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I understand, yeah. Yes, for the heavyweight guy. Yeah, yeah, he's very fast, yeah, you're correct, yeah.
Engin Terzi: But you saw Devin, he beat Georgi Svetko, he beat Hermes, and he beat Denis Tiplenko. The only thing he needs to do is he needs to stop. Stop. One stop and everything changes.
