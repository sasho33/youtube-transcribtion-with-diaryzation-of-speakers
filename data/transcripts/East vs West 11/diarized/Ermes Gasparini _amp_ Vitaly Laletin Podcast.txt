Most likely spring because Dr. Mask told me to not to train for one month. And I'm already not, I haven't been training for one month already, another month. So two months, no training. I will go back again. I don't know where, but maybe 60%. I don't know. When I was young, I wasn't, my power wasn't going that fast.
Engin Terzi: Hello, Hermes. Hello, Engi. How are you, my friend? I'm fine. You're fine? Yeah, yeah. I told the wrong time to Vitaly. Why?
Engin Terzi: Because I made a mistake. You said that it was like 5 o'clock, right? No, but first you said 6 and then we made it 5, remember?
Engin Terzi: yeah yeah i forgot this day in my mind i told to vitale it was 11 so now it's it's just midnight for vitale vitale told me that he hopes that you know he will not fall asleep you know because midnight over there because where he is from is four hours ahead of my time and then five hours ahead of your time you know and now uh what do you mean now

Engin Terzi: I don't know. Whenever I talk with Hermes and whenever I talk with Vitaly, they both sound very confident. And then they are making plans for after the match already. But of course, if they feel good. But let's see how it will be. Nice. Yeah, it will be very, very interesting. Now the people think I'm the rich like about that.
Engin Terzi: And then you will show them right this time. Depends, depends everything about the setup. Okay. So you are saying if setup is fair and square, you're gonna win? For sure. For sure. Okay. Okay.
Alexander: Alexander, can you translate what Ermes is saying? Yeah, I should translate it in Russian? You want to hear the Russian version? No, to me. In Russian? No, I'm just teasing you, Jovi. I can try Turkish, but like, I don't know. You can translate Turkish? I can try, but like, I can try multiple languages.
Alexander: Oh, you speak Turkish? No, no, I can try, but I won't be successful, probably. Oh, I'm trying. Try a little bit. No, I was joking. Only Russian English. There is a super chat for Hermes, Russell Tyrone Jones. Hermes, let's go. Crack Vitaly's wrist like a pasta.
Ermes Gasparini: Good, good. For sure, for sure. Okay, Hermes. You say the very beautiful, the very beautiful videos. I made a video with another YouTuber. But
Ermes Gasparini: I'm in the morning, 124. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You look much healthier, much healthier. The mask is more or less the same.
Engin Terzi: maybe you don't need the unnecessary water probably yeah but still eating still eating every time every time i say animals can we talk he's like i'm i'm eating now so when can we talk 30 minutes later like every time you know it looks like you know you all day you're eating you know yeah today is big pizza you show well beautiful pizza pizza yeah
Engin Terzi: okay okay where is where is vitally vitally probably fell asleep let me check where vitally is
Ermes Gasparini: Let me ring him, you know, so that... So, Hermes, what do you think about the Georgie vs Devon match? The only problem for Georgie is we have only one way to put, only one technique.
Ermes Gasparini: uh-huh and i think if you want to be best of best of three in the top level you need to have more weapon okay you mean best of five best of five top five like this oh you mean you mean that you want if okay uh vitaly is here
Ermes Gasparini: So you are saying that he is only one way and so it may not be enough to beat Devon? No. Maybe for sure he will make some trouble. But if Devon can stop this position, I don't know what he will do.
Engin Terzi: I have a question. We know that... Hello, Vitaly, how are you, my friend? Good. Sleeping? Yes. My city night. I'm sorry. Tell him that I apologize. I made a mistake about the time calculation, Alexander. In general, Engin asked for forgiveness. He confused the time. The other one wrote first. He apologizes.
Alexander: So Vitaly is saying that maybe it's the Hermes who didn't want to talk with me.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, Ermes, yes, you are right. Tell him that he is right. I tried to bring Ermes here, and Ermes is like, I don't want to face Laletin already, I'm so scared. And then I barely, barely, barely convinced him and finally brought him here. Yeah, he is right. Vitaly is right.
Alexander: It's very good. I'm glad to congratulate everybody.
Engin Terzi: okay okay there is a super chat before george secombe message for hermes does the ultra grip handle train your fingers or just wrist i have just purchased one ultra grip for me is one of the best but for finger also risk both both okay okay um literally uh before before before the pandemic
Engin Terzi: Number one was, people were thinking that number one was Levan, and number two was you. Now, after the pandemic, you mostly pulled tournaments, but you also started to pull, you pulled one match against Dave Chaffee, and now you pull against Rewaz. Now you're going to pull your third match.
Engin Terzi: So do you think that right now you are coming to Dubai just to make sure that you are the most dangerous opponent of Levan? Before the pandemic, everyone thought that Levan was number one, and you were right behind him.
Alexander: And after that, there was a period when you fought in tournaments. Then, not so long ago, you began to fight in supermatches. There was a match with Dave in Chaffee, then with Rewaz. Now you will fight with RMS. And in your opinion, will it be your strongest opponent of those who have been in this time?
Vitaly Laletin: I think that Rivas has been my strongest opponent lately. I haven't seen how Hermes fought Rivas. I would like to see it and draw some conclusions, but I haven't seen it. But for me, Rivas was my strongest opponent at the moment. When I fought Sheffield at the moment, I had an injury that prevented me from fighting.
Alexander: Okay, so I think that recently Rivas was my strongest opponent. There wasn't a match between Rivas and Ermes, so that I can compare them to each other. But for now, I think that my strongest opponent was Rivas. And with Dave Chaffee, I had an injury which prevented me from performing better.
Engin Terzi: And how does he see his chances against Hermes? He says that he doesn't know, he never pulled Hermes, but how does he see his chances? Well, again, the table will show how it all will turn out. I don't know how ready Hermes is.
Vitaly Laletin: If he is as ready as he was with Devon Larratt, I think there will be a beautiful fight. If, of course, he scored, it is possible that I will win in touch, but this is not a fact. But I will say right away that even if I lose, it will not be easy for him.
Alexander: So the table will show. I don't know how Hermes is already, is he now. So if his shape is like in the match with Devon, so it will be a beautiful fight. If, for example, he gained in shape,
Alexander: then he may win me fast, but it still won't be easy for him in that case. I understand. And Hermes, how about you? I understand what he said. I mean, I think, okay, can you repeat again, Alexander, what Vitaly said?
Alexander: So if Hermes' shape will be like in the match with Devon, it will be a beautiful fight, like close. And if he gains from that moment, then he may win me fast. But even if Hermes gains, it won't be easy for him to win.
Ermes Gasparini: For me, he is one of the strongest men in the history of Topie Roller. For me, this fight is very important, really, to know how I can throw up my power in my hand.
Alexander: And it will be a very good test for my top role. And for sure, it will be a war, I think. Can you translate that to Italy, please? Yeah. So, I think, you know, Ramos says that he thinks that you are one of the strongest right-wingers in Europe now.
Alexander: For him, this armfight is very important. During the armfight, I will see how my wrist has improved since the match with Devon. And it will definitely be a hard fight. Antonio Luiz, Engin, you serve our sport very good. Thank you, my friend.
Engin Terzi: Congratulations to you. Questions to Hermes. Who felt stronger, Levan or Devon? Levan. Levan was stronger. OK. And I have a question for Vitaly. Vitaly.
Engin Terzi: You know that you both go top roll, Hermes and you both go for top roll. Just in case, if you take Hermes' wrist, are you prepared for Hermes' shoulder press? Because you are good top rollers, but are you ready for such an attack from Hermes, a counter for your top roll?
Alexander: Vitaly, you know that it will most likely be a top-to-top fight, and if it turns out that you will pass him with a brush, that is, you will just pass him with a top, are you prepared for the fact that Hermes will keep you the same way as in the match with Levan? At the moment, I am just preparing for this moment.
Vitaly Laletin: so that in this situation I can overcome Hermes. That is, I am training at this very moment, because I assume that this can happen. Therefore, I have plans.
Alexander: uh so now i'm training specifically for this moment if for if the match will stop in this position uh for me to be able to pin him and so i have i train for it and i have a plan okay you have a plan and and ermeth do you think that vitaly is
Engin Terzi: low hand top roll style is good for your style that you know you like that kind of style because uh instead of the riser he is generating his power from the low hand side to your little fingers and then and do you think that this is an advantage for you um
Ermes Gasparini: I think there are no big advantages because if you saw the match with Revas, Revas was super high. He pushed, he lost his wrist. The most important thing is if we do a close
Ermes Gasparini: and good pronation in this position. But his pronation can open your wrist a little bit. You are 50-50, you know, like two hands open it. Can you translate it, Alexander, for Italy? Please.
Alexander: Hermes said that he saw how your match with Rivas went, that Rivas was attacking top, and in the end his wrist slipped and he got tired, and you beat him in the first part of the first round. David Hermes see in Russia how they initially put me and how they put...
Vitaly Laletin: So Vitaly wanted me to ask Hermes, so did you see how high
Alexander: Hermes' hand was on Vitaly's hand in the first round, so it was like this. You're talking about Yumi Rewa's hand? Yeah, Rewa's. So, and if like in the second round it was even, and in the second round Vitaly won, so if this happened in the first round, it would be probably the same.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, yeah. Hermes says the same thing. Hermes says that even though Revas was so high, still Vitaly was able to win. This is Hermes is saying that even with low hand, he says that Vitaly is still very dangerous, right? Am I right? Hermes, is this what you mean? Yeah, yeah.
Alexander: Yeah, I didn't translate that part. The referee was not very fair in this case.
Ermes Gasparini: He was too much higher than us. I understand. So, not much left. Less than three weeks. It is only 19 days. And how long are you going to rest, Hermes? I think I will do the same like last time. This week, 80%.
Ermes Gasparini: Next week, 50 of my power in the gym and the training. And I think five days is enough. Five days. Tuesday, I do only pumping for blood, some blood in the muscle. And you, Vitaly, how long are you going to rest? When are you going to finish the training?
Alexander: So, I rest 10 days before the match and 10 days after the match. Oh, he's gonna rest 10 days before the match. For me, 10 days before the match.
Engin Terzi: And how old is Vitaly? How old is he? Vitaly, how old are you? 34 years old. 34. 34. And you, Ermes, 30? 30. 30, okay. Okay, I understand.
Engin Terzi: Yep, let's see how it will be. There will be another match. I would like to ask Vitaly, what is your opinion about the Dennis vs Devon match? Vitaly, what do you think about the match between Dennis and Devon? Well, I will say that Dennis, as always, defended, but he lacked the power that he had before.
Vitaly Laletin: In order to win. And Devon, as always, attacked. Denis hoped, as I understand it, for his power. That he would be able to withstand the attack, as he always did. And then win after that. Denis should have been the first to attack.
Alexander: So, Dennis was defending through the whole match, and obviously this stopping power wasn't enough to win against Devon. On the other hand, Devon only attacked as he usually does, as he can. And Dennis thought that it would be enough to win the match, but apparently it wasn't enough.
Ermes Gasparini: so he thought that it would be enough to stop him and win him but it wasn't enough okay yeah yeah and how did you think about this match i think danny he need to change this training because he could i saw every time in this training he continued to only hold his opponent and maybe if we train some more
Ermes Gasparini: More power in his hand and his pronation will be super mega dangerous. I think next year he will become super strong. Then next year will be very strong? Next year, if he continues like this... Do you think that it is all about the power or you think that there should be some changes in technique as well? Technique, maybe a little bit power, but more technique.
Engin Terzi: Maybe like more clapping? Yeah, and you know, staying on the stage with emotion, because I saw him too much emotional about this level. And Vitaly, do you think that Denis will be back stronger next year?
Alexander: I think Denis will be stronger next year than he was this year. Denis needs a little time to recover and recover. He rested for a long time. Okay. Yeah, I think yes, he will be stronger in the next year. He needs more time to rest and to gain. And he will be stronger. Okay, I understand.
Alexander: And Vitaly, where do you see the current Denis in the top 10? Where do you think that he should be ranked? Artem there people in the top 10 that Denis can beat right now? Vitaly, what do you think, in the top 10 at the moment, among the heavyweights, what place does Denis occupy and who could he beat in theory?
Vitaly Laletin: Well, I would say that it's the same as pointing a finger in the sky and not knowing what to talk about until you check. I wouldn't stand with him, I would stand with him, I would tell him who he would be able to beat, from those opponents with whom I fought. And so I haven't stood with him for two years. I think he needs to be checked by someone else to get an understanding. And so I won't even say anything.
Alexander: so it's uh i really can't tell for now because uh there wasn't many opponents uh that dennis had had a match with and i personally for two years uh haven't been on the table with dennis so i just there's no information i i can't tell but he cannot guess how by the difficulty of the match with devon
Vitaly Laletin: Well, you can't guess, judging by how the match with Devon went. Well, recently Devon passes everyone easily, passes everyone easily. Therefore, it is not known how many forces there are in Devon. But again, Denis gave him good resistance. This already means something. If we take, for example, not to offend Hermes, but the fight between Devon and Hermes, then Hermes lost the first fight faster than Denis.
Alexander: uh so like currently devon wins everybody pretty easily it looks like that and you can't really tell how much strength exactly is in devon arm so uh but dennis uh give very solid resistance and like no offense but in the
Engin Terzi: in the first round of Devon vs. Hermes match, like, like, Hermes lost more quickly, quicker than Denis in the first round. Hermes, you want to add anything? Opinion, right? Respect. Opinion about what? No, no, no, no. Like, do you want to say anything about it? Because I saw that you were a little bit upset. No?
Engin Terzi: About my last match? No, he says that Devin won against you easier than he won against Denis. You know, the style makes some different matches. Do you think that there are people in the top 10 that Denis can beat?
Engin Terzi: For sure. For sure, right? Yeah. I mean, we don't need the same name. I think it will be in the top five. Yeah. I mean, Devon won, but we all saw that, you know, he was strong. I don't think many people could do that to Dennis, you know, like Devon did it.
Ermes Gasparini: Yeah, if I compare really in the second match when I close a little bit Devon and really I don't feel amazing power. If he came to me, I think 90% I won this fight because I felt really super power here.
Ermes Gasparini: So his power is mostly riser and pronator, right? Yeah. Sometimes, yeah, with Denis, he was super strong to hold here, but he continued to hold his hand. This is the most difficult part with Nemo.
Engin Terzi: It is very hard because he is holding so low and Devon has a very tall arm and then once he comes... It's hard to hold someone like this. Yeah, he holds that low and Cronen is very... Yeah, it's like when you know when you want to beat one, to have more difficulty, you take here and you want...
Engin Terzi: yeah i mean whenever usually we hold low we go for hook or side pressure but he is holding low and also trying to pronate outside it is like very hard like you need to have a little bit far grip to be more effective when you have this low and then trying to pronate is not that easy no yeah and when they lost very quickly really i felt immediately
Ermes Gasparini: My wrist is already open and I don't have the fire inside to fight if you feel the setup is not completely... I have a question. I asked this question to Devin. He answered, but I'm also curious about your answer. When Devin toppled you and you were resisting like this,
Engin Terzi: And then if he couldn't do the shoulder pressure, but if he tried to pin you, like Levan tried to pin you, you could also open him with time or you think he could still finish you with top roll even if he didn't do the shoulder press? Like did Devin need shoulder pressure to finish you? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure. I understand. Yeah. Maybe not. Maybe not.
Ermes Gasparini: But he has this technique and if you want to win easily, you can use this press. I think if someone with me doesn't have the press, if I lose my wrist, it's very easy to win with me.
Ermes Gasparini: I understand. Everybody has a difficult time because every top roller, if they don't have the pressure, it's very difficult to finish against the shoulder pressure. Every match is very hard. Vitaly, if you top roll Hermes,
Alexander: do you have a weapon or shoulder pressure can you do that um
Vitaly Laletin: Secondly, for this I need a very strong triceps, which I don't have. And I will still fight the way I always fought, as I fought with Trivaz. That is, I will attack and hang. That is, I have a lot of endurance in this position. When you go up, you just hold? Yes, yes, I hold.
Alexander: um so i haven't experienced uh this move in my in my matches in the past uh like with shoulder with uh this tricep and uh you you need to have a really strong tricep plus it's very dangerous i mean the risk of injury so i probably wouldn't do it um and on the other hand i have uh
Alexander: like very good entrance when i uh top roll like i take the hand position yeah yeah but uh do you remember vitally against ferid osman at amc you did a little bit this right uh
Vitaly Laletin: A little bit. Well, yes, there was a moment, but there was also a situation. We fought back with Dima Silayev. And we have a very long fight, a good one. And my wrist didn't work, and I had to keep it in this position. As they say, you want to live, but you don't.
Alexander: yeah it indeed happened but the situation was that before the round with Farid I had a match I had a really long round with yeah so my wrist didn't work I know I'm not asking that like why it happened but it happened he was able to pull this way this is what I mean
Engin Terzi: You understand? Whenever he needed, he was able to use it. I'm not saying that it didn't happen because of SlyoMatch. SlyoMatch was hard. His wrist was tired. I understand. But what I just say that whenever he need, he was able to do that. He has the ability to do that. That's what I mean. You understand or not? I understand. Okay.
Alexander: Andy, I didn't mean why you lost your wrist, but if you need to press your triceps, do you have the ability to do it? Yes, it is very dangerous.
Vitaly Laletin: Yes, so...
Engin Terzi: When my wrist happens to be gone, I can hold in this position a little bit, but I cannot attack. Only hold with the joint, okay. Yeah, a little bit. I remember you, Vitaly, with Alexander Getalo in Malaysia. Ten minutes. Ten minutes. More! More!
Engin Terzi: I think it was 10 minutes that you top roll him and waited, waited, waited. The table, table in your face was like, like it rained, you know, the whole table was like wet, you know, like you could see. Tell him that I remember that the whole table was because of the sweat. 10 minutes, Alexander Getalo is like this. Vitaly is like this. Vitaly just didn't even try, you know. Why did he wait that long? I don't remember. Because he had a foul before? Can you ask him?
Alexander: Tell him everything, the table, everything, please. Thank you. In general, Engin says that he remembers the match with Alexander. Yes, in Malaysia. In general, he says that he kept you like that for 10 minutes, that is, you won, you just kept it.
Alexander: And the whole table was wet, it was just dripping from it. And Engin asks, he says he doesn't remember why you kept it for so long, that is, did you have a fall? Look, I already had a loss, I was going down, I was going down the lower grid. And plus I already had a fall. I tried to jerk the first round, and when I jerked, I had a fall.
Alexander: And then I just held it and tried to press it, but I couldn't, so I held it. Okay, so it was a tournament, and like the first match in that tournament, I lost. Because of the fouls? Elbow fouls? Yes, yes. No, no, it was the match before. No, no, I understand, but no, he understands me. Early match.
Engin Terzi: Vitaly lost because of the elbow fouls. He top rolled him. So this time he decided to wait and not to foul. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So, and then I remember he waited, waited, waited. And at the end, I think if I don't remember wrong, Geltalo was like this.
Engin Terzi: You know, just like no resistance. I thought that Vitaly was the most patient armwrestler ever. You know, he waited like until Vitaly couldn't do, Alejandro couldn't do anything, you know, just like, wow. He was very patient. Yeah. Alexander, say that this time we will stand like this for 15 minutes.
Ermes Gasparini: So Vitaly just said that with Hermes, we will stay like that for 15 minutes. His endurance will be not enough, my friend. Really, I put my shoulder inside. To risk my elbow, I want to break my everything, but I don't...
Engin Terzi: Ermes, be careful. He's playing mind games. He's making you think that you will lose your wrist. Focus on top roll. Yes, top roll. I will do like this. Alexander, can you ask if we have 15 minutes before the prize is given?
Alexander: So Vitaly is asking if me and Hermes will stay like that for 15 minutes, will there be some kind of bonus? Listen, listen, listen. I organized East versus West. You need to ask the king of the table. I don't know.
Alexander: I mean, Vitaly says that he is only joking.
Alexander: such situation happens if we will stay for long and there will be a bonus he will give that bonus to ermus to like to help ermus heal his elbow injury
Engin Terzi: Yeah, that's good. Russell Tyrone Jones. I think Hermes lost first round faster because Devon knew he had to execute fast. But against Denis, he felt there was no more than bicep so he could play. Okay. Thank you, Russell, for your super chat. And let's see what happens.
Engin Terzi: Okay, I have a question for Vitaly. Vitaly, how do you see, what do you think about Georgi Svetko? His pitch match? No, no, I am asking what is his opinion about Georgi Svetko as an arm-master?
Vitaly Laletin: Engin asks what is your opinion about Georgiy Tsvetkov. I have never fought him. I saw a very good angle, good tension. His hand is probably shorter than mine. I put my hand like this, and he puts his hand like this.
Alexander: So I haven't been on the table with Georgi yet. I mean, so as it seems to me now, he has a very strong back pressure.
Alexander: and like for example his arm probably not as long as mine so when he arm muscles he is like like putting it like vertically like to the to the sky maintain his up right here yeah and he pulls with his very strong back pressure and wrist but the side pressure is not the great
Vitaly Laletin: Okay, what does he think about his chances against Devon Larratt? What do you think, Vitaly? What are Georgi's chances in a match with Devon? I think that Devon can get into Georgi's head just like he did with Hermes and scare him, make him worry. That will be a 50% win.
Vitaly Laletin: As for the fight between Devon and Hermes, I think that Hermes didn't show his full potential. He was very worried and burned out at the competition, in my opinion.
Alexander: So I think that Devon will be able to get inside Georgi's hand as he did against Denis and Hermes. So it will make Georgi feel frustrated a little bit.
Alexander: and by like additional information so I think that uh Vitaly thinks that uh Hermes didn't show his uh full potential against uh Devon because Devon got inside uh Adams's head okay okay yeah and and he thinks that Devon is gonna beat Georgie uh
Alexander: Yes, I think Devon will win. Not to let down Georgi.
Alexander: But I think that Devon will get inside his head. Because Devon is very tricky. And it will play a big role. Okay, so he thinks he's going to beat Jorge. And can you ask him, could Devon also get in Vitaly's head, as he does to other people? In general, Vitaly, what do you think, if you have a match with Devon, will he also get into your head?
Vitaly Laletin: I don't get into these provocations on everyone. I've known Devon for a long time and I've been playing on the sidelines for a long time, I have a lot of experience, and that's why it doesn't affect me in any way. So I think he won't be able to do anything against me with this technique.
Alexander: So I won't fall into these provocations from Devon. I have a very big armwrestling experience, so I think that it won't affect me and Devon won't be able to influence me in that way. And does he think that he can beat Devon?
Vitaly Laletin: Well, at least I'll try. But in any case, I'm not going to give up. If I go, I'm going to do the maximum I can. And there, as far as my body allows.
Alexander: uh I uh I I think that if this match happens I will try my best I don't know obviously if I will win or not but I always go to the certain competition to give everything that I have so I will try very hard to win
Ermes Gasparini: Thank you for your superchat. Hermes, how long do you need before you go for a rematch with Devon? Next year? End of next year maybe? Maybe in the summer. So you are looking for that match? I told you my friend, the bag will come back here again.
Engin Terzi: yes yeah that's the spirit never never your hand may touch to the pad but your soul should never be broken just keep it keep it going yeah yeah that's good that's good that's that's the spirit i i don't want any any of you
Engin Terzi: to think that you cannot beat someone, you know. There is always a possibility, there is always a way. And I'm happy that you are already. And people are asking, would you want to fight against Denis? Like, fight, arm-wrestling, I mean. Franco? No, yeah. Yeah, yeah. You want? Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure. It will be super amazing. Yeah, that would be great. I'm confident to win, really.
Engin Terzi: Not too confident, but I know I have a good possibility. But really, it will be a super mega fight for me. Yeah, yeah. I was right, huh? Whenever I said that arm wrestling is great, but with Denis, it is even better. Amazing, amazing. He's a great guy, yeah. Look at Vitaly's arms. He's trying to intimidate you with this, you see?
Vitaly Laletin: Oh, my God! You see, my friend? New quality, my friend, 2.0. Wow, wow, wow, wow. Big size. Yeah, yeah. Whenever you do like this, it's very big. Yes, yes, Hermes, Hermes.
Alexander: Vitaly said that he will put the arm like this, like Hermes does. So when there is a photo, Hermes always puts his arms like in front. Him too, him too, same.
Alexander: We're running for this. Hermes says you're doing the same. Hermes! Good? Good, yeah? His weight. Yeah, this is what I was going to ask. What's his weight?
Engin Terzi: 136 grams. And you, 124? In the morning, 124. Okay. And another question for Vitaly. Vitaly, you and Hermes had some
Engin Terzi: training session in Dubai like did you feel him uncomfortable for your style or did you feel comfortable I think you both top of each other he took your wrist some you took his wrist some you know I remember that way did you feel him comfortable for your technique
Alexander: Vitaly, you had a sparring with RMS in Dubai. Was it comfortable for you in that sparring? David you feel the control or it wasn't very comfortable? In the first two fights, when I didn't get involved, I let RMS try.
Vitaly Laletin: By the way, I posted a video of Hermes, where he beat me twice. And where I turned it on, I beat him. And then I beat him on the left hand, and he didn't post that video. So remind him. So he only posted the first two draws and won? Yes, yes, yes. Where I beat him in full control, right? That is, I overcame him, overcame him. He didn't post it.
Alexander: So there was multiple rounds and in the first two rounds armwrestling won me, but I didn't engage in armwrestling too much.
Alexander: And, like, funny thing that Hermes posted, like, these two rounds where he won against me, but he didn't post later, like, rounds on the left arm where Vitaly won. See? What do you expect from Hermes? See? Not true. I remember very well.
Ermes Gasparini: a i posted there are the video on my youtube channel there are full video about the grip and the full video about uh quite uh four four times to win and the two two inch win more or less yeah i posted everything every time um yeah translate that one please alexandria
Alexander: In general, RMS says that he remembers this moment very well. He posted two videos on his YouTube channel. The first is where, apparently, there is a capture, and the second video is the rounds themselves. And he says that he posted everything.
Alexander: So Vitaly is asking, like, if Hermes will lose, like in case if he will lose, will he post something on his channel? This is not a good way.
Vitaly Laletin: Okay, Alexander, you don't translate. He's saying, let's go. If I lose, I'm going to post the video. If you lose, you're going to post the video. Is this what you said?
Engin Terzi: yeah yeah really wow okay now one second
Engin Terzi: Vitaly was, from the beginning, was saying, I will do my best. We will see how this match happens. And now he's saying, if I lose, I'm going to post. If you lose, it means that he's very confident. Tell him that he now showed his real face and how confident he is coming to Dubai. After the first round, he's confident. And then he will change his mind about this. When he will feel my hand,
Ermes Gasparini: yeah translate this here he don't understand where he is in dubai or russia he don't know he's on the table we don't understand now okay alexander translate all this first what i said and then second what okay
Alexander: And before that you said that you weren't so sure. Then Hermes said that when there will be a capture, you will take Hermes' hand, then all your confidence will disappear, you will not understand where you are, whether you are in Dubai or not.
Alexander: I will not cheat, eh? Let's see what he said. I will not cheat. Listen, Hermes, let's see what Alexander translates first. What did he say? Vitaly said that he just wants to advertise Hermes so he can make more...
Alexander: What again? I missed it. Say it. He wants to make Hermes more popular after the videos to make him more subscribers. So I'm not confident in myself, but I want to advertise Hermes to make him more popular.
Alexander: Yeah, but does he think that if Hermes is sharing the match that he loses, how is he becoming more popular? Engels asks, if Hermes publishes a match where he loses, how will it make him more popular?
Vitaly Laletin: Vitaly says that if Vitaly loses, he will post this video on his channel.
Engin Terzi: and it will make more subscribers to Hermes. Okay, but why does he want Hermes to share then, if he loses? Because he already knows he will lose.
Engin Terzi: No, no, but what he just said, he also offered you. That part I understood, but what is it about the other part that if Hermes loses, he's sharing, how is it going to help Hermes, that part? The first part I understand, Laletin loses, he shares, and more subscribers to Hermes. But if Hermes loses, why does Laletin want Hermes to share if he wants more subscribers for Hermes? That part didn't make sense to me at all.
Alexander: I think it's a misunderstanding, but I will ask. So, what you just said, he understood, but if Hermes loses the match and publishes a video about it, how will it help him make more subscribers? So, Hermes won't make subscribers anymore? Maybe he won't lose?
Ermes Gasparini: um so if uh if aramis if aramis loses he will make me subscribers okay so in both ways you know okay i understand so it looks like that there should be anything i will don't cheat i don't uh we don't cheat in in the setup
Engin Terzi: Ermes, why you mentioned it? Evgeny if somebody doesn't think about it, when you mention this, you prepare the person, you know, this guy is afraid that so I should cheat it. No, no, no, no. Very important. No, no, I think the referee will not allow that. But people were confused. You translated that his weight is 136, but the Russian speaker guys in the chat, they said that Laletin said 133. Can you ask him one more time? 133 or 136?
Engin Terzi: uh no he says that it's 136 36 okay okay so we shouldn't trust those guys in the chat that who says that they speak and and criticize your translation and and guys please the the the moderators we are finishing and you share the uh paper really
Alexander: Mask him if he saw my lift. 55 kg, rise. 55? 55 riser. In general, RMS asks, have you seen his lift for 55 kg? No, let me see.
Alexander: No, Vitaly didn't see it, so Hermes probably should send it. Go to see, go to see. Please, my friend. Direct. Say to him, go to see. Okay. So, in general, Hermes says that you should see it. Okay, I want to see it, but let him weigh his pancakes first, so that everyone can see that it's 55 kilograms.
Alexander: So Vitaly said that, okay, I want to see, but first you, like, Ermes needs to weight his, weight what he's putting on and lifting with rice. No, like, weight, actually, like, that we should see that it's really 55.
Alexander: somebody told him that uh engine uh did 60 kilogram on rice
Engin Terzi: Evgeny. Evgeny I did. I don't understand. He says that you are using plastic waste, plastic waste. Plastic? Yeah. He will fill the plastic on the table. Tell him, tell him. Ermes says that he will fill the plastic waste at the table, the real, he will make him fill in Dubai.
Alexander: Well, Hermes says that you will feel these non-real 55 kilos behind the table. Okay, let my people feel 35 then. Vitaly says that's okay. Let Hermes fill my 35. Okay.
Engin Terzi: So he says that his 35 is stronger than your 55, and he will show you in Dubai. This is what he says, Hermes. No, no, no. I said this to Hermes. I said to Hermes. I said that Laletin's 35 will feel stronger than... Yeah, yeah. You are like saying that we will see, right? We will see. Yeah. Maybe now he's 60.
Ermes Gasparini: But I don't want to risk it, really. Yeah. Do you think that, Hermes, these kind of things automatically translate to the table? I started, really, two, three months ago. You know, when I wrote to you, I started to train like this. Yeah. With 40 kilos, it was very hard.
Ermes Gasparini: 40 kilos, now 55. Now 55, but... 55 is 40% more, yeah. I think really I came 57 or maybe 60. But I don't want to risk to have any pain now that I'm very close. And here really I improve a lot because I started with static exercise.
Ermes Gasparini: the 20 kilo for many for 30 40 seconds like this and now i can do i can do 50 52 kilo for 20 seconds now is less time but the power completely different and did you have any improvement the exercises that i show you yeah static
Ermes Gasparini: Do you also improve the exercises that we talk about it? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I do a lot of exercise, static movement. You are always strong. You just need a static beginning position, you know. Yeah, because really, really I did a big mistake to go train for one more, for training a little bit. I focused only on my bicep, back pressure.
Engin Terzi: We need to train all things, everything. Vitaly, the last question. We are finishing. This is more than one hour. Hermes needs to go training. You need to go to sleep. Last question. When you lost against Dave Chaffee, you said that you had a trauma. Right now, you're going to Dubai if you lose. Do you have any excuse?
Alexander: Vitaly, when you had a fight with Dave Chaffee, you said that you had a shoulder injury. And now, after the fight with RMS, if you lose, will you have any excuses? No, I won't have any excuses. When I went to fight Dave Chaffee,
Vitaly Laletin: Everyone knew that after Tilaev, after AMC, I had a rupture in my lip joint. This ligament was torn off. After Dave Chaffee, I had to do an MRI. I needed to sew it on. The doctor told me that I needed to sew it on, and I was able to cure it.
Vitaly Laletin: I mean, I have other muscles working there, but I will say now that there will be no excuses. I am now fully recovered, the injury does not bother me, and I am in very good shape. Therefore, let the RMS rest, because it is already too late to train. We will soon be able to fight it.
Alexander: So Vitaly says that no, there will be no experience for me if I lose. During, before the match with Dave, I had a shoulder injury. It was, I don't know how to say it exactly, but some kind of tear, like in the middle, as I understand. And doctors after the match told that it should be reattached.
Alexander: But Vitaly decided not to do it. So now he is in a very good shape. And he is saying to Hermes that now Hermes shouldn't train, he should only relax. There is only one request. To give me a normal, good, honest judge. I don't need anything else.
Alexander: And he's asking you, but I think, I don't know if you're the right person, that somebody should give him a fair setup, not like in his last match. Oh, for Lelekin?
Engin Terzi: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, I don't understand. Listen, I bring referee from US and the Eastern guys complain. I bring from here, the Western guys complain. These are the best referees in the world. I don't know how these kind of mistakes happen. You know, I have no idea. I talk with them. I don't know. I don't know what to do. You know, like, like, if there is any problem, there shouldn't be. There shouldn't be.
Vitaly Laletin: Engin says that he doesn't understand how this happened. Engin, you will be the referee on the table. I don't know. I don't know. Let's make it so that Engin promises us last time that he will judge if there is a bad judgment. Let Engin judge us. Yes or no? Engin, referee. Engin, referee.
Engin Terzi: yes yeah perfect okay okay no problem if i left if i left i terrorized you guys terrorized you guys
Engin Terzi: don't move really you know i was really like you cannot even move yeah okay but i think that king of the table is referees as referees if they ask me to do it i would do it but other than that i wouldn't even ask such thing because you would be disrespectful they are their own organization i will be there i will be there but yeah yeah you maybe you translate this and i will also ask him uh one more thing his shape
Alexander: compared to the shape that when he pulled against levan is it close to that shape or better or any less how is it um
Alexander: What did he say? Vitaly said that if the referees
Alexander: like if Vitaly and Hermes will not be satisfied by referees, so he asks you that in two months they will re-arm wrestle on East vs West.
Engin Terzi: Okay, okay. I trust the referee in King of the Table. If they want me to ref, they can ask to the King of the Table. If King of the Table asks me, I will do it. I will do it. It's no problem. But I cannot tell them, you know, I want to ref or something. They have their job very good. Can you ask him about the second one, his shape compared to when he pulled against Levan?
Vitaly Laletin: In general, Engin asks, how would you compare your form when you fought with Hermes? Well, of course, the form is much better. The form is better and the weight, I think, is 10 kilograms better. And even the weight, so to speak, is not real.
Vitaly Laletin: Yes, I have a good weight. Back then, I was a lot weaker. But, again, back then, Levan was a lot weaker. I think that now Levan is stronger than it was back then, when I fought with him. Now I feel much better.
Alexander: so italy says that his shape is uh i mean like like not significantly but uh like better like there is a significant like improvement so his body weight became uh like more quality and uh but uh he also said that like in that match he was uh
Engin Terzi: like weaker, and so as Levan was weaker. So they both get stronger since that time. That's what he said. Yes, yes. Okay, that's good. That's what I want to hear. Levan in the best shape of his life, he has no excuse. And you, Hermes, do you have an excuse? No, right? You are also ready.
Ermes Gasparini: Yes. Yes, that's good. That's good. I will go to win. For sure. Yeah. For sure. So you're saying bye-bye. I show them my able, but I will win. If he will take my wrist. If.
Engin Terzi: you are saying that you will do whatever it takes to win. Evgeny if it takes, you will sacrifice your shoulder, elbow, everything. So there will be a war, big war, between the Italian gladiator versus Siberian bear. That's good, that's good. Guys, this is like, this king of the table, probably the best.
Engin Terzi: on the table uh we have seen so far because i think georgie versus devon will be a war i don't know he's gonna win do not underestimate georgie i'm not saying he's gonna win but the guy is different with right arm as devon is the same but this match also could be at the main event
Engin Terzi: Right now, Devon is ranked number one. Probably that will be the main event. But this guy, this match could be the main event of any event in the world. And this match will be a war. Do not miss it. Get your pay-per-view.
Engin Terzi: These guys are in great shape, and they both know that if they want to reach the top, this is the test that they are going against. And this is a very serious test. And thank you very much, Hermes. Do you want to say anything before we close? To do anything, I need to tell you to be relaxed.
Engin Terzi: don't hurt yourself in the training and everything will be fine everything will be fine he doesn't need to resist if he doesn't want to get hurt he should just go relax and yeah and translated alexander please and then ask ask you we tell you if he has any last words
Alexander: Because now the podcast is being held. In general, Hermes says that he wants you not to get injured during training, not to do anything unnecessary, so that you come in good shape, so that you rest. And then Endin asked if you have any last words. Yes, I also want to wish Hermes good training, so that he reaches the competition without any obstacles.
Alexander: So Vitaly is basically wishing the same. He wishes Erma good trainings. And he said that he
Alexander: You wish that Hermes will come to Dubai healthy, without something that can prevent him from going to Dubai. And he wishes and wants a real equality fight. Yeah, yeah, he will for sure. Yep.
Engin Terzi: Tripboard, the last word. Tripboard says, Ermes has many supporters from Turkey. He says that Ermes has many supporters from Turkey. Yeah. Thank you. Anyways. Okay, guys. Thank you very much. And thanks to everyone who watched us. And then we will come back with more podcasts. Thank you, Vitaly Laletin. Thank you, Ermes. Alexander, thank you very much, my friend. And hope to see you again. Thank you, guys. Bye-bye.
Engin Terzi: Stay strong, eh? Stay strong. Good night, my friend. See you in Dubai. Thank you.
