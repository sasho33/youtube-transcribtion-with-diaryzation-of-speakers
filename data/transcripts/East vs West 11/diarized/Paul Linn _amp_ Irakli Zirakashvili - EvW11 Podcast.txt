Unknown: Hello, Paul. How are you doing? Good, good. Tired, tired, but good.
Paul Linn: How are you? I'm good. Just got back from the gym. As soon as I'm done with this, I'm heading to Maryland to go train with Morocco and Goga and Kenny Smith. Tomorrow? Today. You're going to train today? Yep. And you came from gym? Yep. I hope you're not overtraining. There's no such thing.
Paul Linn: good good there is no such thing wow but you don't believe in resting or you know like i don't i don't adapt my table time around my strength training stuff like i don't i don't rest before practice like
Paul Linn: for the most part i think a majority of the gains i'm getting um usually are coming from you know the movements i'm doing in the gym so i don't ever want to sacrifice that and then when i go to practice it's more like conditioning and muscle memory and technique wow i mean i was like that when i was like 16 17 18 but
Paul Linn: Yeah, I got, I got started late and I'm making up for lost time. I'm just pretending I'm young. Yeah. Incredible. Incredible. Wow. So how's everything with you? Um, today I did shoulder. Front, front, medial and rear delt. And then, and then.
Engin Terzi: external rotation. Yeah, yeah. And then, you know, it's just easier to show you understand all of them. Yeah, you feel good and healthy. Um, I just like started, what I did today was probably 50 to 70% depending on the the moment.
Paul Linn: And I mean, yeah, I mean, I still have, I think I'm eating so much carb. And I think that that is the reason of the inflammation, I think. Absolutely. I guess there's different schools of thought on that. There are certain schools of thought that say like meats and proteins will promote inflammation. And then there's a whole other school of thought that says carbohydrates do. I know my inflammation is at its best when I'm on a carb-restricted diet.
Engin Terzi: That's when I feel the healthiest. When you are low in carbon, you feel healthy. Yes. Yeah. I mean, I I'm, I'm sure that because I don't eat a lot of meat because all my career, you know, I ate so much meat, meat, meat, and then like, like if I don't have any serious competition coming near, I try not to eat so much meat and
Paul Linn: But now I see that I'm eating so much carb and then I think the inflammation is coming with it, you know? Yeah. I tend to, my joints, my joint inflammation is definitely flared up when my carbs are high. So usually my carbohydrates are a little bit higher over the winter. And that's usually when I'm the sorest.
Engin Terzi: But I feel that's why I like making that cut to 95 because I actually get like four to six weeks of really clean diet. And I almost always feel my best health. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I agree. I should do the same. I should do the same. But just I have been competing like so long time, like more than three decades. And like dieting is just like.
Engin Terzi: I know. And it is really, really hard to focus on multiple things, you know, and so I'm type of guy that like, I like to focus on one target, and then really lock myself there instant. And, and so right now, even if I start training, do something, I feel like, as I said before, I, like, I'm like,
Paul Linn: I don't know. I'm doing something bad to East versus West because I'm focused now on something else, which is my own training. Yeah. But it's got, you gotta be fair to yourself too, but you're a hundred percent right. We're, we're at our best. All of our energy. Sometimes it's not even about like physical aspect. It's more about like that emotional energy. I find like I do so much in my life, but I'm always at my best when I have one, like you said, one date, one target, one thing.
Paul Linn: But if I have like two, three, four stacked up, it means my energy focus. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That is why you can't really focus when it is like really deep in football season, I think. Yes. I mean, like I said, I could compete, but I just know I wouldn't be bringing my best. I can always do the physical stuff. I can make time to do all the physical stuff.
Paul Linn: but like that emotional energy that you apply to those workouts and those trainings is just at its highest when you've got something else nagging in the back of your head at least that's how i feel yeah yeah that like i kind of feel that my mind is just there and then
Paul Linn: I need to shift here. And I kind of feel that I cannot be successful if I don't give my all to one thing, you know, this is how I feel. I mean, I think sometimes you can be successful, but the level of success, you know, or, you know, like it's one thing to maybe win a competition, but I mean, how many times do we win some form of competition, but we don't like the way we won, you know?
Paul Linn: uh i deal with it with football like if we're not winning by a margin then i'm not happy i'm still upset yeah alex kurdecha is in the chat if it is really him he says hello good fellows hey alex
Engin Terzi: Alex, Alex said that he was over 160 kilo right now. And yeah, which is hundred 360 pounds. That sounds about right. Yeah. Yeah. And yeah, it is. And yesterday I had Levan as my guest. And whenever I talk,
Engin Terzi: about I asked him about Morozov Kurdecha you know these guys are thinking you know that they're gonna become the best and um and he said that everyone is free to dream you know hello yeah thank you for your support Troy I I'm happy that you like your Jersey
Engin Terzi: Yeah, and then whenever I said, Adamus says that the title is going to go to him, and he says, yeah, he can probably make something similar, you know, the belt in Italy, then that's the only way for him to have the belt, you know.
Engin Terzi: and then I I talked about Devon and he said Devon Devon should just for now can enjoy in the sense is he needs to better um take care of my belt he says you know so it it it doesn't give any any anything away you know he's just like the other guys just can just deceive themselves that's what he says basically yeah
Paul Linn: I love it, though. I mean, I love that he's coming back. I think there's a lot of questions like, you know, where is his level going to be at with the injury and time off and everything else. But I love that he's he's bringing all that positive energy like he didn't skip a beat. Hopefully he didn't. I would love to see him and him at their best. What's up, Irakli? Hello Irakli. How are you Irakli?
Engin Terzi: Good, good. You? Good, good. How are you, Roman? I'm doing good, thanks, Engin. How about you? What's up, Roman? Roman, you need to increase the sound, you know. Okay, I will do that. I barely hear you. What's that? I think... Is it better now, guys?
Engin Terzi: I don't know. To me, it's very low. How is it for you, Paul? For Irakli, it's also low. I will change the headset. I'll be back. Okay. Irakli, what is your weight? How many kilos? Ninety-eight. Ninety-eight. So, three kilos left. Yes, yes. How is the power? Good? Yeah, yeah. Very good.
Paul Linn: And how about you? I'm sure you are not below 220. I'm at 220. I'm right at 100. So 220 right now you are, 100 kilos. Yeah. Okay, okay. Yeah, I'm actually a little bit smaller than I normally am at this time, but my body composition is good. But you said that you are in great shape, right? Yeah, I'm definitely leaner, less fat. Uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah.
Engin Terzi: Less fat? I don't remember you fat. Sometimes. Winter time's tough, Engin. Winter time's tough. Uh-huh. Irakli, your power now compared to Ruslan Babayev match, more, less, or same? More, more. More? Yeah, of course. Okay.
Engin Terzi: So you want to beat Paul first and then you want to beat Sasho? Yes. Very soon, like rapid fast. What's that? He wants to do it really quickly. He wants to beat Paul quickly or he wants to pull after Paul, he wants to pull Sasho quickly?
Roman: he wants to get these both wins done as quick as possible like he said that i need to have sasha match as soon as possible that's what he meant so he's gonna quickly done with paul why why that hurry why is he hurrying that much you know is he planning to not to stay in the 95 kilo
Irakli Zirakashvili: And why did you choose to go to Arapi Repo in 2005? Well, it was my dream to go to Arapi Repo, and I didn't want to go. I wanted to go there.
Roman: uh so he meant it the way that uh the title was his dream and he still is he's all he wants as soon as possible he wants the title as soon as possible that's what he meant so he would definitely if you beat paul and then if you beat sasho the next would be kata chings in 95 kilo okay the revenge revenge revenge yeah sure yes and paul
Engin Terzi: You want to beat this guy, and after that, you want the revenge against Sasho. You both pulled against Sasho. Irakli lost, I think, 4-1, and you lost 3-2 from last match that you had with Sasho. David you learn a lot? I know you are now focused on Irakli, but is a little bit part of your mind is there still?
Paul Linn: I mean, I had a lot of months to think about that and dissect that match and where I went wrong and things I could have done better in preparation. But after, you know, after the last match and then this match being announced, of course, I have my long term goals. But like I said before, I'm only at my best when I'm focusing on the nearest thing. So I'm not I'm not counting my chickens before they're hatched. I'm worried about January 20th.
Engin Terzi: okay yeah because you know that there will not be any anything you know uh any uh match uh beat up beating uh exactly this is the only thing on my mind yeah yeah yeah i need to one second
Roman: Hey, Paul, I didn't get the chance to say hey. How are you doing, Roman? Good to see you again, man. Yeah. Do you want to tell to Irakli what Paul said? Yeah, sure. I always want. I just don't want to interrupt your podcast. No, no.
Roman: I would like to ask you, Mekha, what do you and Paul have in common? What do you and Paul have in common? What do you and Paul have in common?
Roman: Thank you very much.
Engin Terzi: Many things you have already understood, but alongside, I get in details. There is a super chat, Furious. He says, Paul, when you beat Sasho, will you ever consider going heavier and possibly ripple John at 105 or on Garbera?
Paul Linn: So far in advance, man, that I can't even think that far. I've talked to Ang and him possibly in the past about maybe moving up a weight class. My natural weight where I'm happiest and where I'm healthiest is this 95 kilogram place. But crossover matches for sure are not outside the realm of possibility. Definitely entertain them.
Paul Linn: but for the time being i'm just kind of focused on being the best 95 kilogram puller i can be at this point so sasha all those things potentially down the road i got january 20th and then we'll see maybe reassess after paul do you do you see that you are still progressing yes i'm definitely 100 still progressing
Paul Linn: I have my common barometers. I do strength checks in preparation for all of this. I'm definitely progressing technically because I'm still learning. I'm still green when it comes to understanding certain aspects and learning how to apply them. And every time I grab some of these guys, especially the higher level guys with different styles, I'm downloading data and then I'm taking it back to the gym and practice and I'm working on it. So I think I'm progressing technically and
Engin Terzi: From those common parameters, you know, measuring yourself against, you know, the people that you pull regularly and the people that you pull back, I'm definitely getting stronger. And can you ask exactly, he was pulling light heavyweight, now the middleweight. David he lose any power?
Irakli Zirakashvili: Ira, you have been in this category for a long time, right? Since 1995 and it is very interesting what kind of regressions you have experienced. No, not at all. I mean, I have experienced a lot of things in the past. I mean, I have experienced a lot of things in the past. I mean, I have experienced a lot of things in the past. I mean, I have experienced a lot of things in the past.
Irakli Zirakashvili: This is a very comfortable zone, it is very comfortable and it is very easy to walk on it. It is very comfortable and it is very easy to walk on it. It is very comfortable and it is very easy to walk on it.
Roman: Actually, he did not regress his strength wise. Vice versa, he meant that he actually feels very comfortable, much more comfortable at this weight. And he feels his muscles during the workout progressing and he's even going heavier weights right now and he even has a progress.
Roman: He feels healthier. Strength. He feels definitely healthy. He said that I feel way better when I don't try to push myself, my body to have some extra extra weight. So he feels much healthier and stronger. That's what he said. He said that thanks for the good advice of giving him that to drop the weight.
Engin Terzi: he thinks that that was good why do you say that now paul is gonna hate me um so paul what is there any concern about iraqli
Engin Terzi: of course do you do you do you take like do you know this match for me is very very interesting very very interesting because you hook john you hook rambat i mean anyone that you pulled i mean of course some of those athletes were hook pullers anyways but like in your category
Engin Terzi: I mean, like we know that Rambat is like, he can pull outside very well and John can do that very well. And when you hook John, of course John was coming back, but I don't think that you were anywhere near where you are right now. It was just like long time ago. You are like now internationally, very high level experience puller, you know. You won East versus West title and it was just like very close match with Sasho. He could go either way.
Engin Terzi: and so your hook inability because of your explosiveness is like you don't only just hook but you also it's sideway incredible and it is very very hard to hook iraqli um like he he i think rushtam did two times but he was able to unable rushtam hooking him three times so
Engin Terzi: And he pulled against Marcio, he pulled against Krasimir, and it is very hard to hook him.
Engin Terzi: so this match is very very interesting you know your hook inability of course mixed with side pressure and his you know uh top reliability so how do you see this match paul like i mean well i mean it's it's it's a huge test for me uh stylistically it's definitely the biggest challenge that i faced like some people can look at those names john and ron and
Paul Linn: and rustum and everything uh but iraqli is the toughest stylistic challenge and it's it's new territory for me you know at the international level his back pressure and hand and wrist are insane clearly um so um it'll be it'll be a huge barometer for me understanding my ability and my ability to prepare and my ability to impose myself or have to pull reactively
Paul Linn: so i'm looking forward to it um mainly from the perspective of testing myself um but i have the utmost respect for for iraq i mean between him and angrabaya who who out there are better as far as being a pure top roller he's the best at what he does is that i know you wouldn't want to share your game plan but in backside of your mind somewhere you know that there may be any like something plan b
Paul Linn: Yeah, I mean, I can't like I'm the type of person that sometimes the best approach is to do the same thing, only harder, you know, the Travis approach. But me personally, it's kind of hard for me to go if I lose one way or feel like I lost that way from like with a big margin, I feel like I have to have a plan B. So I have to have an outside option. There has to be. So, you know, my focus has been balanced in the preparation for this match.
Engin Terzi: Just because if I lose, I don't want it to be the same way twice. Roman, can you explain the same thing to Irakli? Maybe you translate what I said, what Paul said, and then you can ask him how he sees this match, Irakli. Sure.
Roman: Yes, that's right. I think it's important to be aware of what's going on in the world. I think it's important to be aware of what's going on in the world. I think it's important to be aware of what's going on in the world. I think it's important to be aware of what's going on in the world. I think it's important to be aware of what's going on in the world.
Roman: After that, the method will be the same, the same rules, the same rules, the same rules, the same rules, the same rules.
Roman: However, it is important to note that there are a lot of cases in which it is not possible to say that the asset will remain the same after a certain period of time and that the asset will remain the same after a certain period of time and that the asset will remain the same after a certain period of time and that the asset will remain the same after a certain period of time and that the asset will remain the same after a certain period of time and that the asset will remain the same after a certain period of time and that the asset will remain the same after a certain period of time
Irakli Zirakashvili: Well, I think it depends on the situation. I think it depends on the situation. I think it depends on the situation. I think it depends on the situation. I think it depends on the situation.
Irakli Zirakashvili: There is a lot of interest in it, and it is very interesting to see what kind of style will come out of it. As Paoli said, I don't know what kind of style will come out of it, but it will be interesting to see what kind of style will come out of it. In my opinion, it will be interesting to see what kind of style will come out of it.
Roman: So, Egin, he remarked multiple times that he mentioned to you that Paul was the name that he would love to do. And also he underlined the weight category changing announcement that he said that after Dadikyan match he also wanted to
Roman: go willingly down so these two factors coincided and that's why we have this match one of his mostly anticipated match him versus paul he said that paul is very
Roman: Interesting matchup, but he also said that stylistically it's good for him. He feels comfortable pulling against hook pullers. I think we could understand why. He meant that he finds always something that he can just take as an advantage of against hook pullers.
Roman: But he also said that anything is possible. He doesn't exclude the fact that Paul may surprise him. And he said that neither of us can say what will happen for sure. And he thinks that this is a very interesting metric. And can he compare Paul with Rustam? I'm not saying which one is better or something. What is the difference? What is the similarity? Is there anything like that?
Irakli Zirakashvili: Okay. What did you do? You said that you and Paul were going to play together. Is that what you were going to do? Well, we were going to play together, but I didn't know what to do. I was going to play in the club, but I didn't know what to do because I didn't know what to do.
Irakli Zirakashvili: There was a lot of competition. There was a lot of competition. There was a lot of competition. There was a lot of competition. There was a lot of competition. There was a lot of competition.
Roman: So, Engin, I once asked maybe he wanted to add something extra because he did not say much. He said that Rustam, he still thinks that Rustam is at this weight category most capable of hooking armwrestler. He also
Roman: mentioned it back in the when it was last match he said that he was pulling the number one in his mind at this weight category so he said that they are both similar but like Rustam he thinks that Rustam is more bit more capable at hooking and then I asked maybe there's some difference and he could not say anything specific in difference wise so roughly he measures them roughly the same that's why
Engin Terzi: Yeah, get some more and more, but he didn't say much. Roughly the same. I mean, in my opinion, Paul is more explosive. I know Ruslan is very explosive, but I think Paul is a little bit more explosive. But just my opinion.
Roman: Maybe he has something to say. In my opinion, Gaigo, as you said, it's just that they're all really strapped. Yes, they're strapped, and they're really motivated, and that's why they're so smart.
Roman: yeah i know yeah he said yeah much much faster and also motivated he seems all the time like very motivated armistead to come out and prove something at the table so yeah yeah yeah and and uh paul
Engin Terzi: how do you see iraqi like compared to the other top rollers like how do you see did you talk with marcio did he have any or with john or so even even with tatashins all your teammates you know he pulled tatashins he pulled marcio he pulled uh john so three of the americans he pulled against
Paul Linn: Yeah, that's not by chance. That's planned. So yeah, I picked everyone's brain. I think I learned a little bit from each. Whether I can apply what some of those guys do or what they think is yet to be determined.
Paul Linn: But as far as like what I think I've learned in my preparation for this one, I don't think I rewatched the same matches over and over as many times as I have with this one. And I usually, you know, I usually watch a lot of film. This has been the borderline obsession, especially it's because I, you know, to me, this is absolutely the biggest test that I've had.
Paul Linn: You know, it's one thing pulling a hooker who wants to go there and me being okay going there, maybe getting there first. It's another thing forcing the hook against what I believe is probably the best top roller at 95 for sure. Moving into 95, there's really no other top roller names that jump out to me. 105, obviously, you know, there's Agrabayev and Dottie Kahn, you know.
Engin Terzi: But now at 95, I don't think that... Whenever you say top rollers, like top roll versus top roll is a different thing. Topie roll versus hook is a different thing. He may still be right there for 105 kilos against the hook pullers. Right. He may be the best top roller against hookers.
Engin Terzi: Maybe, yeah. He's very effective because we don't see him getting hooked. The Sasho match to me is possibly... He was 90 kilos and he was still young. Of course, we cannot take anything. Sasho won. He was the man. Now, Irakli is...
Paul Linn: When he pulls Sasho, Sasho was prime already. Right, but from a technical... But Irakli is still progressing, in my opinion, because Irakli is younger than Sasho, I think. From a technical standpoint, though, I mean, re-watching that match over and over, Sasho never got to a comfortable hook position in any of the rounds that he won. It was like total commitment to it, flat-wristed, you know... But that's how Sasho is. Sasho just puts here...
Paul Linn: And the side pressure, he doesn't really hook. Yeah. Yeah. So to me, that one was very interesting that, you know, even for the duration of the match, he wasn't able to really get any wrist flexion at all. And I know he's jamming sideways and everything. Yeah. That's the match I find myself watching over and over.
Engin Terzi: yeah as a top roller i hate that i hate it like if i flatten somebody's wrist he shouldn't be able to apply the pressure but for sasha he just puts here you think that he is just like he cannot do anything he was like and then he slams down yeah
Engin Terzi: Yeah, he can still hit, you know, yeah. But, you know, Sasho looks like he has good endurance. In the John match, if you realize, last round, he even went outside. He did the same thing to Irakli. Last round, he went outside. He did the same thing to Rob Visions. He beat him this way.
Engin Terzi: And then he beat him outside. So, but I just hated the guy is very good. So I think that, I don't know who's going to win this match, but for Samushia mesh, either you need to be much more explosive, so they will never be an endurance game, or you really need to work with a bit more on. Endurance. And how do you see it? Like, how did he, how does he like to see his own endurance? Like compared to Paul?
Roman: Ira, what do you think about your relationship with the police? Do you think it's a good relationship? I don't know. I don't know. I think it's a good relationship, but there's always a problem when you don't know what to do.
Irakli Zirakashvili: Now, there is a problem with the translation, as you can see, the translation is not as good as it used to be. There are no subtitles for me, but I will try to translate it for you.
Irakli Zirakashvili: And if you do this, you will not lose weight. And you will work hard to lose weight. But if you lose weight, you will not lose weight. And if you lose 10 kilos, you will lose weight.
Roman: He's not quite sure to say I'm the better more endurance wise better arm wrestler than Paul. He could not say for sure, but he said that since he dropped his weight and also he changed his gym where he's training now, he's training with the multiple, even though lower weight guys, but multiple of them like six, seven of them and constantly he's trying to improve his endurance and he feels he's better
Roman: uh and more endurable than he was back in when he was heavier and he said that like when i was one 105 basically after first round i felt like i was already exhausting and now i have none of those feelings when i'm training that's what he said so he feels he feels now he's more enjoyable but he could not say that he's better than him he's not sure
Engin Terzi: Sprite says Sasho can be 95 and 85 kg champion at the same time. He will do it. Guys, there is a small mistake. When you watch John Brzenk versus Sasho match on the card, it was written, I don't know how, Sasho was 88 kg. But Sasho weighed exactly 95 kg.
Engin Terzi: against John. He had just the sport pants and no shoes as far as I remember. And he was exactly 95 kilos. So if you think he was 80 kilos, he was not. Can you ask Irakli, what if Paul hooks him? Can he fight? Is he prepared for anything outside of the main plan?
Engin Terzi: Because I remember that East vs West 2, Prudnik and he, they pulled inside. It was still like a tough match. I remember him, Irakli, doing some training in hook and he was strong.
Engin Terzi: But in the competition, I didn't see that. Whenever Rustam hooked him, Rustam didn't have much problem and he did not do the transition to hook. He just lost. So how is he right now? Does he have any plan B or if he gets hooked, he's going to lose or?
Roman: Thank you very much. First of all, I would like to ask what kind of a factor it is. You mentioned earlier that there was a reform in the EU. How do you think, how will it be implemented? And I would also like to ask you to tell us about your and Prudnik's decision, which you mentioned earlier.
Roman: And at the end of the day, it's very comfortable to go to the club. If you go to the club with your parents, they won't be afraid to go to the club. And if you go to the club, they won't be afraid to go to the club. And if you go to the club with your parents, they won't be afraid to go to the club.
Irakli Zirakashvili: One of them congratulated Rustam that if he had entered the ring, he would have been in the first match, and in the second match, he would have been out of the ring, and he would have been out of the ring, and Magitom would have been out of the ring. In fact, he was very proud to have entered the ring, he was very proud to have entered the ring, he was very proud to have entered the ring, he was very proud to have entered the ring,
Irakli Zirakashvili: You can go to the book store and buy a book. It's a good idea to go to the book store because you don't have to worry about not being able to buy a book. You don't have to worry about not being able to buy a book. If you buy a book for $5, it's okay. You don't have to worry about not being able to buy a book for $5, it's okay.
Roman: So, Engin, the fact that he did not continue fighting against Rustam in hook was basically his strategic move. He had such a mindset prior to the match that if Rustam manages to hook me at some point, force me in hook,
Roman: Since that's not my prime major movement, I will not exhaust myself. I will let it slide if it's not decisive round. If it's decisive round, then I will go all in. He said that during the practice, he did not mention any specific Georgian athlete names, but he said that against hook pullers, I pull all the time during practice. I have no problem.
Roman: Well, I mean, he meant that he is comfortable as well, but since he's not the prime primary, his weapon, we know what it's outside. So he said that he just doesn't want to exhaust himself fighting in the position that he doesn't feel as comfortable as he does when it goes. Okay. So he entered for the Rostam. So does it apply the same for Paul?
Roman: He said, we will see, we will see. And prior to that, I did not finish my thoughts was that he said, if I beat Paul 3-0 up to five rounds, we can go all in hook, no problem. He said, yeah.
Engin Terzi: except except except the title matches it is like best of five the one who comes to three and then it's finishing yeah and then he just looked yeah okay okay okay yeah and and paul what do you think about all this now he's writing you he's asking you where did
Engin Terzi: against Irakli. It is very, very hard to ask a question regarding your match because you are so humble. Evgeny if you believe you can do something, you say like, okay, I will do my best and we will see. So, but he's asking you, he's asking you, he's saying that like, where do you see your chance against Irakli? I think it's obvious that if you fast hook him and drag him, but you would know better.
Paul Linn: Yeah, I replied to David in the comments. I said, I'm happily the underdog. If I'm handicapping this match from the known quantities, I'm the biggest odds makers and I'm setting the odds. I'm putting me as the underdog.
Paul Linn: unknown quantity against top rollers you know the different things you know recently um and where rackley has been uh with title contention in 105 if i'm looking at that i'm making myself the underdog right uh but at the end of the day i'm i'm happy being that corner dog the corner dog fights harder um and i'd rather be chasing than being chased i mean i kind of feel that
Engin Terzi: Like every time you say you are underdog, you are just giving all the pressure away. You sound like humble. Yeah, you are humble, but you are just taking all the pressure away and putting on your opponent. And I kind of think that it's a very smart strategy. I mean, I apply my own pressure to myself. I try not to dig into the outside pressures. Those pressures are weighing on me at all times.
Paul Linn: I have goals and things that I want to prove, not just to everybody else, but mainly to myself. So those pressures are there at all times when I'm trying to sleep at night, things are in my head. I am 100% sure that you put a lot of pressure on yourself and you are like, I don't need anymore. Yeah.
Paul Linn: I try to take it one step at a time. And I said it to you, Ang, and I will not bring a version of myself to Istanbul that is lesser than the one that was there prior. I won't do that. So I can't guarantee outcomes or how I'm going to perform on a day. But what I can guarantee is that I'll be a better version than the last time I was there. Yeah, that's good. That's great professionalism. Porkchop says,
Engin Terzi: Forcing a hook on Irakli is a tough task. The way Tozilla won in the straps and as of his late matches is a good example on how to beat the top role. This is in my opinion. Yeah. I mean, the example is there. I see Superman going on the skyscraper and then jumps down and boom, and he walks away. And then if I try to do the same thing,
Paul Linn: i will probably die so so that must be something good hutchings is a very special human being yeah uh and you know we there's he puts a lot of information out there that people can follow but i've come to the conclusion that genetically some of us are not the same and todd is one of those genetic anomalies but speaking of pork chop he looks like he's recovering amazing uh did you practice pulling with devin
Engin Terzi: he was pulling in the same fashion as as todd and looking really really tough side pressure wise yeah he looks like he's kind of okay they we we enjoy real guy very very strong guy here and yeah let's see let's see how he will be doing against david so let's let's talk about the upcoming events upcoming events other matches i mean and
Engin Terzi: Let's see. Let's see. Okay, let's start with Aydar Khan versus Vala Irakli. Irakli, Aydar Khan, you know Aydar Khan, very explosive and Vala is very strong here. Super top rollers. Who's winning? Irakli.
Irakli Zirakashvili: Well, if a child is sick, then he can go to the hospital, but if he goes to the hospital alone, then he can't go to the hospital. The child is very ill and he can't go to the hospital alone. The child is very sick, but he can't go to the hospital alone, and he is very strong. This is the 4% of the cases when a child is sick.
Roman: saying that like 80 percent of ala is the favorite he thinks that he will beat uh but the only lane that he thinks that nugal has a chance is by his explosiveness he said that nudolet is very fast compared to wallah so that's like wallah's disadvantage but but strength wise while uh he trained with wallah iraq himself and he said that he will beat him uh if it comes to the strength but yeah yeah but the man he's not always like you don't win always with
Engin Terzi: So his chance with explosiveness is only 20%, he says. That's what he said, yeah. Okay. And do you know this gentleman, Paul? Yeah, yeah, I got the name. Valhalla is the one that you remember. He gave a good match to David Samushia. Yeah. And he beat him round one, and then they had a war, and then he got exhausted, usually, out of people.
Engin Terzi: Get exhausted. And Aydar Khan is the one that beat Minda Agha in 75 kilo world title match, but he cannot lose the weight anymore. So he's trying now 85 kilo. I was thinking to give him the direct title match against David, but I choose to do this one instead. Yeah, I like the match. I thought Walla pulled David very well. I was very impressed.
Paul Linn: um you know i remember the nerlet matches as well with uh mendagas and which i also thought was very impressive but i i i don't root against georgians unless they're pulling americans so i i'm back in wallah thank you thank you mate yeah so you think what is gonna be
Paul Linn: I do. I do. I think his outside is just a little too much. I think he's going to have a ton of back pressure and be able to nullify some speed. Yeah. Marcio Barboza, Oleg Petrenko, Heraklit. I'm not interested in that, but I would like to say that
Roman: I don't know if it's true or not, but Petrenko is my favorite. So slight favorite like 55 to 45 Petrenko is the favorite in your opinion. Very interesting match, but slightly edge to Petrenko.
Paul Linn: I genuinely think that Marcio has enough versatility in this match. And a lot of Marcio's ups and downs are based off of his work schedule and his ability to train and injuries. And after talking to him and pulling with him, I think he has options to win this match.
Paul Linn: Um, we know, we know Petrenko can pull in, in several different styles as well, but I think, uh, this Marcio has taken this serious and this is a big kind of a comeback match for him, um, and a statement match. And I genuinely believe whether, whether Petrenko is the favorite or not, I think Marcio wins this. So Marcio is going to win. I believe so. And Irakli said, Irakli said that?
Irakli Zirakashvili: 55% to 45%. Let's go to the next one. I'm Eric versus Robby Toppy. Artem you familiar with these guys? I'm not familiar with these guys. I'm not familiar with these guys. I'm not familiar with these guys. I'm not familiar with these guys. I'm not familiar with these guys.
Engin Terzi: He finds it hard time to remember Robby Toppy. Okay. And you know, Paul? Yes. Don't worry about those people. They are just coming here just to take attention. Just ignore them, my friend. The one match that I organize is just I can organize 150 matches, you know, only with one match budgeting. You tell me, Paul.
Paul Linn: Yeah, I mean, I'd like I'm, I'm pseudo familiar with Aymeric. Explosive outside puller, you know, been has a ton of longevity. Robbie Toby has for a long time been
Paul Linn: either in the top three super heavyweights, left arm in the country. And now he's traveled down and weighed a little bit. He's been, even though he's not social media active, but he's always pulling, he's always training. He pops up with some huge wins. He had a huge win over Cody Merritt a couple of years back. And then he won the East versus West qualifiers. I would, based on like, if I'm making odds,
Paul Linn: you know, on what's known and what's not known, you got to kind of make Aymeric favorite. But don't be don't be surprised if Robbie shows up in his best form ever at this light of weight. I know he's taking it super serious. I've been talking to him. Obviously, I'll be supporting him. But he gets that that that blessing of probably being the underdog as well. Okay, that's good. And
Engin Terzi: this one i only want uh the name of the winner okay not not any detail exactly who's winning iraqli or paul 50 50 50 50 ask him does he does he believe or he is being now like you know humble or politic you know just like
Roman: Politically correct. That's the way it is. What do you think, Nambilad? What do you think, Samboko? Do you think that you have a political point of view? That it's not what you think it is? I don't think so. I think that it all depends on the situation.
Roman: He doesn't like to talk about his upcoming matches in advance too much about them, so that if it appears completely wrong, then he doesn't want to embarrass himself. So he's just saying that table will show the match we will see. Okay. I don't think that Paul is going to say he's going to win either, you know. Yeah. That's why I like the Georgians. That's why I like the Georgians. 50-50. All right. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: We'll know. We'll know. We'll know 10 minutes after we throw. Okay. Matt Matt versus Wagner. Right arm. Wagner takes the win. Big advantage. Big advantage. But Wagner's right arm is not as good as his left. Does he know this?
Roman: So he's saying that everybody beat Mask, so why would Wagner lose? He said this way. What's that? He said that everybody has beaten Matt Mask at East versus West. He means, so why would Wagner lose? That's what he said.
Paul Linn: Okay, so he thinks that Matt Madsen will forever lose the match at the East versus West. Okay. Could be. I don't know. And Paul, how do you see this match? The only person that's guaranteed to lose anything in this is you losing a table. Table, right? The table is losing and you're losing one of your tables.
Roman: I'm telling you, we need the extra table, man. We have to bring the extra table. Engin Irakli asks you to set Matt Mask versus Wagner after Paul and Irakli are done. Because he needs to guarantee the table will be there. Yeah, this business is taking time.
Roman: If I were you, Engin, that's what Irakli is saying, I would just exclusively order a specific table for those two and that's it. So they can break as they want, right? Exactly. Not to touch the other matches. What did you say, Paul?
Engin Terzi: What you gotta, you have to have a special made table where all the joints are welded. It's set just for right on the pin lines. Everything is welded in place. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. I mean, I, I, I'm, I'm not joking seriously, uh, after what Wagner did last time to the table. So I'm really thinking that, you know, I, I, no, I'm not joking. I will have extra table, like probably one more extra or two more extra like official table.
Paul Linn: Not the warm-up table, yeah. As far as the actual matching, I do think Matt Mask is winning. I think Matt is on a good trajectory right now. And I think stylistically, especially with this being Wagner's off-arm, I think Matt's going to be able to secure an outside move and potentially finish quickly. And Zurab versus Artem Taynov directly.
Irakli Zirakashvili: Well, it's interesting. In my opinion, Trabzonsk was the second most popular city in the world. It was the second most popular city in the world, but it was also the second most popular city.
Roman: He's siding obviously with Zurab. He's cheering for Zurab. But he would say 50-50 because Taynov is also really a good armwrestler. We have seen, he has seen and he finds this very interesting good matchup. So 50-50 he said, but he would obviously cheer for Zurab. I don't remember which one was it. Maybe it was Rino and Matyushenko, I think.
Engin Terzi: where both they said that like, they said like Zurab is going to win. And no, did I host them? No, I didn't host them. David I host them already? No, no, no, no. Zurab and Taynov, no. No, no, no, no. Ivan and Rino. David I host them? I'm just doing too many shows. I don't recall. Yeah. Paul, how do you see this one?
Paul Linn: Well, you know, I love Zareb. I think, you know, with the right arm injury and the focus on the left, I think that we're probably going to see his best left arm yet. So, you know, when I look at those factors, I just don't think Zareb is coming to lose. I think he's coming to make a statement. I mean, I see that Zareb is now very, very hungry. Yes. Because he broke his right arm.
Paul Linn: And now he wants to pull, he just like, he wants to do something, you know, and then he's going to give his all, you know. Well, he's got that champion mindset when something bad happens, you know, he breaks his arm, all that course of bad actions and everything, things that happen. He responded so positively, all of his social media posts. He never stopped training, you know, so like all of that.
Engin Terzi: that was being split right and left is now going into that left. And for that reason, I think he's winning. Yeah. Roman, you're sending superchats, concrete table. Concrete table. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Thank you, guys. Thank you. These fans are incredible, you know. It was Prudnik versus Ali Can. Yeah, you're right. All right. Prudnik versus Ali Can. They both said that Zulap was going to win, you know.
Engin Terzi: and yeah that's interesting you know and this is a title match which is probably drop's dream to go there and put the belt on you know because the guy really loves our machine and the next one olex rock versus two berries exactly what do you know about it right
Irakli Zirakashvili: Well, as you know, I am from all over the world, from Europe, from all over the world, from all over the world, from all over the world, from all over the world, from all over the world, from all over the world, from all over the world,
Roman: Engin, he knows Tutberidze as much as you do because he also lives in a different city and they have never met each other. But from the videos of his performance at WAFs and Europe Championships, he watches him dynamically and he thinks that he has progressed a lot and he thinks that he would do a good matchup against Ork. But he doesn't say who's going to win.
Roman: He thinks that John is like favorite like 55 maybe percent is John favorite in this case because because of the lack of information we have about. Paul do you know you don't know Tutberidze right? No not not much but it's I mean I know Oleg.
Paul Linn: To make Oleg an underdog is tough to do. So you are saying that it is hard to say Oleg is underdog in his own weight category? Yeah, it's just he's one of those guys that you don't want to bet against, especially at his own weight category. But I don't know enough. It'll be interesting. We'll see what happens. Yeah. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: And Daniel Prokopchuk versus Mindaugas Tarasaitis.
Roman: I think it's very tough to answer all those matchup predictions because Engin, you pick it very close this time. Like super close, 50-50, he's constantly saying that. So he thinks it's tough to call who would win between Daniel and Minda Agassi.
Paul Linn: 50 50. this is 50 50. okay and paul i think this match is going to be insane i think it's going to be entertaining i think the build-up is going to be entertaining like i i like both of these guys personally and for different for like polar opposite reasons um mendagas has obviously mastered the sport of arm wrestling so you can't you can't count them out
Paul Linn: But I think there's definitely, you know, there's, I think, a level of a strength gap with Daniel and Mindaugas. So I think it's going to come down to, you know, Mindaugas' technique. He's so good pulling defensively. I think I would give Daniel a slight favorite, but very, very slight. And I wouldn't be surprised if it went the other way. So you are saying that slightly Daniel is favorite.
Engin Terzi: slightly, and that's only based off of sheer strength. And there's a huge possibility that the dog is can find a hole in that arm. Okay. Iraq Lee, you remember we let him in my room. My room. Yes. And, you know, he likes to go inside, and that would go in inside.
Roman: Do you think it will be a good match?
Irakli Zirakashvili: Yes, that's right. It's very important. In 2013, I went to the European Championship in Moldova. I was in Moldova in March. I was in a very good shape. Dimitrov and Bozidar were all very good. It's very important. David is a favorite.
Irakli Zirakashvili: It is very interesting. It is very interesting. It is very interesting. It is very interesting.
Roman: Irakli reminisced about his past experience of pooling with Maiorov and he said that like the European Championship 2018 they pulled and he managed to beat Vladimir but then in Moldova they pulled only left hand and Vladimir took the victory
Roman: and he said that he beat then many many uh guys tough guys like such as like uh he said yeah um he said uh also um yeah yeah so those names so vladimir myrob is really tough tough guy but also um samushia is like six times already a champion he proved himself and he said that this match will be really warm inside
Engin Terzi: it will be tough match but but that david is gonna win he thinks i know yes yes yeah it won't be easy like tough tough match but he thinks that would will okay paul you don't know you you don't know william not a ton not a ton yeah yeah i i kind of think that i kind of think that i i'm not saying he will win but i kind of think that you will be
Engin Terzi: surprised with his performance like I think it will be it will be one of the toughest maybe the toughest Metro someone should just my opinion and this guy is just making a comeback he just competed I think Swiss open early early November and I heard that in the overall they say he beat sundries but I'm not sure wow yeah wow that's a that's a huge one wow I mean this is what I heard I heard yeah
Engin Terzi: And so, okay, let's go to, since you don't know the guy, let's go to the next one. And next one is Ivan Matyushenko, Rino Masic. Exactly. Ivan Matyushenko. 60 to 40% Ivan is favorite. 60-40? 60-40, Ivan. Can you ask him as a top roller?
Engin Terzi: would he like enjoy pulling against someone like Matyushenko? Just my question. Yeah. Because usually we top rollers, like outside pullers, we don't like people like Samushia, even Matyushenko with the tall forearm and with the explosive, you know, hand speed, you know.
Roman: Plus Irakli also said at the beginning of this podcast that he loves going against hook pullers. Irakli, is there anything you would like to say to the audience? What would you like to say to the audience? I would like to say a few words. I would like to say a few words. I would like to say a few words. I would like to say a few words.
Roman: He said that he could not remember any athlete, any arm wrestler who pulled against Ivan and Ivan could not manage to force hook. And he finds it really, really challenging and interesting to someday maybe they meet each other and pull.
Roman: Yeah, but he accepts the fact that it would be difficult. For sure, I will re-ask again. He finds it really tough call. Yeah, Rino and Matyushenko.
Paul Linn: Yeah, getting into the sport late. You know, I'm catching up with Matyushenko, all the stuff he's done in the past. But seeing him pull recently and now following him on social media, the guy's just a stud, a powerhouse. And, you know, looking at the fast shoulder roll and how he dealt with it with Camille, I think that that's going to be a tough lane for Rino. But I do think Rino is a little bit faster. I think he can go inside, outside. I really like Rino.
Paul Linn: I'm like rooting for him, but I see it similar to what Irakli had. You are saying Rino is faster than Kamil or Rino is faster than Ivan? I think Rino is faster than Kamil. I don't know if he can meet Ivan.
Paul Linn: What do you think he wants? He wants speed. I think he's fast and I think he's fast and strong. I think that shoulder roll lane is just going to be shut down. So we'll see if Rino has, you know, other options up his sleeve. But I mean, right now, Yvonne just looks like he looks scary. Yeah. I see him as a favorite. I'm rooting for Rino.
Roman: Tell him how he sees the match.
Irakli Zirakashvili: Well, it's a very interesting match. John Zoghannet is not very good at scouting. I don't think it's a good match for him. I don't think it's a good match for Krasimir, but there are moments when he is very good at scouting. I think it's a very good match, but I think it's a very good match for John.
Roman: He said that John is good at such a stylistic opponent such as Krasimir. He also said lately we can see that Krasimir's wrist can be taken relatively easy from John. We could predict that, he said.
Paul Linn: And also because of 105 weight category, not like when John was below, he thinks that John would be victorious. How do you see that, Paul? I mean, again, I just don't bet against John, you know what I mean, as like a principle. But I do think this one's probably going to be very interesting.
Paul Linn: Just hearing the rumors of how training between Sasho and Krazy goes and stylistic similarities, I think this could wind up being a really, really good match, regardless of which way it goes. I believe John has the versatility, obviously, to win this match and potentially take Krazy's hand. But then there's always the question about where is John's health, where
Engin Terzi: There's this interest level of things around nature. John will be 105 kilo, unlike his 95 kilo shape against Sacho. Do you think that if John was 105 kilo versus Sacho at his weight, do you think that he could win?
Paul Linn: different match for sure i don't know if he wins it but i think he's more in it you know i think the weight cut did not suit john because he had such an extreme weight cut and so on i think it was definitely like i don't want to sit there and say like hey you know if if john didn't have to do that cut he would open the match because that's detracting from sasha's success um but i do think it would have been a much like it would have definitely been a variable
Paul Linn: so i gotta believe that that's a positive for john coming into this match as well he'll come in healthy and eating and not on keto for a month you know you might not have the abs but he'll probably be healthy very very shortly roman is that top roller directly like stylistically which one he thinks more dangerous sasha or krasimir you know what a top roller
Roman: Yeah, so tell us about your work. What kind of work do you do? Artem you working with Sasho or with Krasio? Sasho. Sasho. I work with Sasho for a long time.
Engin Terzi: Sasho's wrist is much stronger. And also arm is also stronger. So he said Sasho is more... Okay, let's go to last three matches. Ali-Chan Muratov vs. Evgeny Prudnik. I'm not interested in all of them.
Irakli Zirakashvili: The most interesting match for Irakli is that one on his card. And it's a very high level match. Yes, yes. Well, Deba is a very strong sportsman. Prudnik is very strong. Muratov is very strong and strong.
Irakli Zirakashvili: It's not like he's going to say that he's going to pass, he's going to pass, he's going to pass, he's going to pass, he's going to pass, he's going to pass, he's going to pass, he's going to pass, he's going to pass, he's going to pass, he's going to pass, he's going to pass, he's going to pass,
Roman: So, like he said, this is a very, very interesting match, the favorite match for him at this competition, he said.
Roman: We have both very strong, also smart, and also fast armwrestlers. And he said Prudnik is really, really smart. He can technically pull many ways. Alizhan is very, very fast. We'll definitely go in hook, he said. But such a matchup, he can only say, he has no idea who will win, who will take it. It will be endurance-wise battle in hook. He said 50-50.
Paul Linn: I can't say for sure clearly now I understand and and you Paul I think this is really close and again I I'd like this is one I'm looking forward to prudnik's always so entertaining um my gut kind of makes alijan a slight favorite but I'm I'm picking prudnik the win
Paul Linn: I think Prudnik has so much heart. His last left-handed match was just unbelievable. One of my favorite matches, one of my favorite highlights of the year. So I'm picking Prudnik, but I probably have Alejandro as a slight favorite. You are picking Prudnik and Alejandro as favorites?
Paul Linn: Yeah, I think on paper Alizhan is slight favorite, but I'm picking Prudnik to win. When you say on paper, according to who? You? Like if I was just saying, like, who do I think is the favorite and who do I think will win? Like sometimes I think, you know... Artem you saying that you think Alizhan is stronger, he's going to probably win, but you support Prudnik or...
Paul Linn: I'm saying that I think based off Alizhan's tools and speed, I think he's the slight favorite. But I actually think that Prudnik will win this match. I think he'll get a stop. So when you say that Alizhan on the paper is favorite, you are talking about the general understanding of how it should be. Yeah, let's say Vegas is making odds for us to bet on.
Paul Linn: Carl John would be the slight favorite, but I'm betting on Prudnik. But interesting, whenever I did the poll on YouTube, almost 80% said that Prudnik was favorite. You know that when you do polls, people just pick who they want to win. Yeah, Prudnik speaks English pretty well. He's funny. He can sing. People are picking him because of that. But I think he's going to win because of the size of his heart.
Engin Terzi: Okay. No, what I just tried to say that what you think and what community think is the same, you know? Yeah. Yeah. And let's go to the last two matches, Todd Hutchings versus Daddy Can. Very interesting matchup, you said, but Todd will take the win.
Roman: Because he has enough horse power to stop him. If Dadikyan will willingly go to hook, it will be even better for Todd to pull. So, either Todd forces him, stops him, and then a stylist by his own style wins, or if willingly Dadikyan goes in hook, it will be even better for Todd. That's all.
Roman: and he cannot think that that again can flash pin uh he says like only like 10 percent is the chance that uh that he can will top roll see like that 90 90 he will not manage that's what he attributes well he may top row but cannot finish
Paul Linn: He gives only 10% of the chance to happen that. Okay, yeah. Okay, and you, Paul? I mean, I do think this is potentially Todd's toughest match.
Paul Linn: I think Daddy Khan has a very strong hand. And if there's anybody who's going to be able to defeat that pronation a little bit up top, it's probably Daddy Khan. But I just think Todd's getting better. His back pressure and some of these things that people don't think about when they think about Todd Hutchings, he is improving in those areas. Back pressure and pronation is crazy. And he's kind of, I think he's kind of mastered
Paul Linn: not you know he's kind of mastered top role defense so yeah it's it's it's similar to what iraqli says it might be the best lane for daddy kyan might to be just might be to just dive in a hooker i i just checked with ongar web ongar wants to pull
Engin Terzi: Todd Hutchings again. And I said, what if Dadikyan wins this match? And then he wasn't sure if he wants to run after the title or run after the Todd. You know, he was like, let me tell you later. I want to beat Todd, he said. So it looks like, you know, he wishes Todd to win so that the title and revenge can be in the same game, you know? Yeah. Yeah.
Irakli Zirakashvili: Okay, let's go to the last match. Kurdecha vs Morozov, Irakli. Left arm roll title. Well, it was a very tough fight for Morozov, but it was tough.
Irakli Zirakashvili: Kurdistan will be my favorite country because it is a very beautiful country and I am very happy to be able to live there with my family. I think Kurdistan is the best.
Roman: He thinks, strength-wise, Morozov may be slightly stronger, but against such an anthropometric, like, long-leverage guy like Kurdecha, it will be tough for him to pull from outside. For Morozov, it will be tough. He said that he has grouped up with Alex and he knows how awkward it could be for top-rollers to try to top-roll Alex, so that's why he gives, you know, like,
Engin Terzi: more chance for alex to beat him because how awkward it would be for morozov to beat him three times and did iraqi when you train with alex uh right and left which arm of the alex did you feel stronger
Roman: He said that to grip up and pull, they did not pull neither of arms. He just knows how awkward the arm is, but they did not try to practice or pull neither arms. Okay. And Paul, how much did he smash?
Paul Linn: Man, Irakli basically took all of my words. I like both of these guys, and I do. I agree. I think Morozov might be the stronger human being, but I think a lot of this is going to come down to anatomy and just how large of a human being
Paul Linn: uh kardec is and how awkward his style is um i i make kardec a slight favorite uh but again i'm really looking forward to seeing these these guys back seeing seeing uh morozov back and healthy and then now seeing kardec on the east versus west stage is just monumental these are these are two names that um either arm can shake everything up i mean i will tell you something anyone
Engin Terzi: that we see on that stage is just like extraordinary human being, you know, like these guys, they, they just like, you guys just sit down, talk, you know? Yeah. But the things that you guys are capable of doing is just mind blowing, you know, just I'm, I'm really fan of each of you.
Engin Terzi: and i really enjoy and people wanted me to ask you guys uh two more things um the other day i was a guest of the travis's program and then hermes was there and then it started that way this way it just ended up like travis versus uh hermes left arm in april and i want to ask i want to ask you i mean i'm i'm sure i'm gonna be there
Engin Terzi: And I reminded during the program to Travis and he said, yeah, he's going to pull, you know? So how do you guys see if that match happens for four months later? You go ahead, Paul, and then I will translate for you. Okay. I mean, Travis is the big X factor, right?
Paul Linn: Like he hasn't been motivated in so long, but we all know his potential and his ceiling, right? If he gets back to where, anywhere near where he was, let's say within 10% of, you know, his best. I mean, I think when you look at Hermes and how he, you know, dealt with Devin at the table, Travis also brings like another level of that, you know? So like if Travis shows up,
Paul Linn: and he's not training he's not taking it serious then obviously hermes will be the favorite but if he shows up serious like with the intention of more matches after this like i can't bet against travis you know he's and i think getting that match set if that match happens it's so monumental for arm wrestling if we can spark a little bit of interest in travis to actually get on the table and train consistently that's a huge piece of arm wrestling that we're missing
Engin Terzi: So I'd love to get Travis back. And if it happens... You know what I will do, Paul? I will pay him for every round that he wins so that he better bring his ass in shape. Yeah, that's how you do it. Yeah. And Roman, what does you like to think about this match?
Roman: I will also quickly translate what Paul said and then we will hear his opinion.
Irakli Zirakashvili: Well, now I have to say that when you look at what form he is in and what he looks like, he doesn't look like anything. And when he was at his peak, I think he would have been a pro-favorite. And that's what I thought, and that's what I thought. I think he would have been a winner, and I don't think so. And now that he's in that form, I don't think he's going to be a pro-favorite.
Roman: Yeah, basically he shares what Paul said, Paul's approach, like since we have technically no idea how much good form Travis will actually enter the match, he could not, Irakli could not give the prediction, but he said if Travis takes it serious enough to at least get some, his percentage-wise, his best shape, he would take this match and beat Hermes, but...
Roman: Right now, if he doesn't take it seriously, then there's no point in pulling him. That's what he basically said. It's up to you, Yangin. If you motivate Travis enough, then we will have a match. Okay, now the last one. Devon versus Levan.
Engin Terzi: Yesterday Lewa was my guest. Whenever I said, Irakli, I said, Ermes says that the title will be his. Alex and Morozov think that they will reach there. And he just tells them that they are free to dream, and the title is not going anywhere. What does Irakli think about this?
Roman: This is the first time Levan has been on the podcast, and I would like to say that I am very happy that you have come to talk to me. I am very happy that you have come to talk to me. I am very happy that you have come to talk to me. I am very happy that you have come to talk to me. I am very happy that you have come to talk to me.
Roman: De unis, de leones mas.
Irakli Zirakashvili: I don't think Devon knows what he's going to do. I think Devon is a great player, he's a great sportsman. I think Levani will be able to compete with everyone. He will be able to compete with everyone.
Irakli Zirakashvili: In the case of Lebanon, there is no problem with the situation in Lebanon. There is no problem with the situation in Lebanon. There is no problem with the situation in Lebanon.
Roman: So I obviously translated what you have told yesterday, Levan, and Levan's reaction to it. And then I asked Irakli's opinion, what do you think about Devon versus Levan? He said, like, what do I think? I mean, even Devon has no idea what to think about that match, he said. And then he said, like, despite of the Levan's injury,
Roman: he thinks that he will be completely recovered and Devon will not have a chance to beat him, even though he finds Devon favorite against everybody else but Levan. He said that like right now, if you put Devon against anybody, if it's not Levan, Devon will win, he said. That's the thing that Irakli, he thinks that Devon has improved since the last match.
Roman: Do you think that after the match between Leone and Maguri, Devon will be the winner of the match?
Irakli Zirakashvili: I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. Because I went to Lebanon for the first time and I was very happy to be there for the first time.
Irakli Zirakashvili: It's obvious, but the fact is that it was very strong, and I don't want to say that I don't want to say that it was very strong, but the fact is that it was very strong.
Roman: Evgeny Levan himself said how powerful Devon was back then when they faced. And Irakli said that I could not say that he progressed, Devon progressed so much since their last match that there could be decisive factor to beat Levan. He said that judging by how dominantly he beat Michael Todd back then, Devon has been already in a
Roman: great great shape he said that leon was already in a good shape such a best shape that uh he could beat anybody else so he doesn't say that uh he neither progressed or did not have any progress he says that the one has always been that strong since we saw him competing against michael and even leon said that he was that one was really really strong back then so
Paul Linn: He could not say like there was progress will be decisive factor to beat Levan. And you, Paul? I mean, it's the factors at play here, you know, with Levan coming off the injury and Devin progressing make this so much more interesting than I ever thought it could be for a rematch. You know, after we saw the first one and then I spoke to Devin right after the first match with Levan.
Paul Linn: um and i asked him about the gap and he said the gap was huge you know he was very honest and said and i was like you know do you think there's anything you could do to close that gap he was basically said like man it would take like something life-changing at that time and then that was you know that being a couple years ago we watched devin progress and again like hutchings we're talking about somebody who is somehow getting better
Paul Linn: like every match um and then you you pair that up with the bond coming off the injury to me it creates that perfect storm for like a build-up like for devin having a chance and i do think devin has a chance um but he'll be the underdog in this one for sure um but i'm very very interested in the match i mean like this will be the biggest match since i've been in arm wrestling for sure
