Engin Terzi: Devon has some questions for you that he wants me to ask you. Yeah, he wants me to ask you some questions. And anyways, guys, also the trading cards are available.
Engin Terzi: Okay, so Levan, last time you and I, we talked, you said, what you told me was, you were around 30%, but it was about a month ago, and you said that you don't have pain anymore, and you are very happy that you can train without the pain. So what happened in last one month, you know, from that time to this time? All the same, it's dynamic.
Tornike (Translator): I think that in the past there was a lot of pressure. There was a lot of discomfort, a lot of pressure. But I think that there was a lot of pressure and there was a lot of guidance. In this country? Yes. Yes.
Levan Saginashvili: So I really had a great month of training recently. I've been progressing really quick. I think that I need just two months more to regain my strength fully. I'm already doing really good. I don't feel any pain. There is some burn in the wrist, but that will only get stronger as I train more.
Tornike (Translator): Well, sparring is one of the most important things in the world. It's a very important sport. It's a very important sport. It's a very important sport. It's a very important sport.
Levan Saginashvili: i'm not rushing the process i'm taking it slow i i only had some light sparring sessions nothing too heavy um and the weights are gradually increasing so i gradually take the steps to recover fully so does he have any uh plans you know which month where he should be or his
Engin Terzi: Levon, you are making decision like you are doing it and then making decision or in your head there is already plan you know for the next months
Tornike (Translator): Well, it's hard to say, but I would like to say that I am very happy to be here, because I am very happy to be here, and I would like to say that I am very happy to be here, because I am very happy to be here, and I would like to say that I am very happy to be here, and I would like to say that I am very happy to be here, and I would like to say that I am very happy to be here,
Levan Saginashvili: i have a specific plan which i'm following uh i try not to rush it too much um i think that overall my strength is already coming back
Levan Saginashvili: I even have to hold back some, not to rush too much. Okay, so he can do more, but he's not doing it yet. Just following the plan. He's following the plan and he doesn't want to repeat the situation like during the preparation for Morozov. Smart, very smart. Evgeny two months prior the match, he already was at his peak strength and doing his peak weight. So he's doing the steps gradually.
Engin Terzi: And we see him, Levan, we see you with training with your friend, you know, the, what's he like powerlifter or what was he? Strongman. And as we see you, are you training with the arm wrestlers at all at the table or you are just focused only the lifting right now?
Engin Terzi: I mean it's not my business but I would suggest you to do with the like junior guys or something slowly like I mean table time adaptation as well slowly like how you do with the weights but how are you doing
Tornike (Translator): With Sandro Labadze, who is the European champion in 10 kg, he is a very strong athlete. He has a very strong body, and his weight and proportions are very good.
Tornike (Translator): I was visiting Konstantin Janashia, Strongman.
Levan Saginashvili: Just as a guest, he lives in a different city, and we just had a couple of training sessions together. Apart from that, of course, I train with a great athlete, Sandro Labadze. He's the European champion in 110 kg category. And his arm length and overall his height is very close to Devon's.
Levan Saginashvili: and we are already having great sparring sessions together. And Levon, you are as careful when you do table time as you are careful with the weights, right? Do you start sparring as you do with Jonas, or do you do regular sparring? Yes, I start sparring as soon as I can.
Tornike (Translator): It was very uncomfortable for me. It was very difficult for me. It was very difficult for me. It was very difficult for me. It was very difficult for me. It was very difficult for me.
Levan Saginashvili: Of course we are trying to be careful but with the human opponent you know how it is. We have gone full power a couple of times and
Levan Saginashvili: I'm happy that I'm already able to stop Sandro comfortably and he's a very strong athlete. I think that as I progress, I hope to easily handle Sandro and this will give a good indication of my strength against Devin. Levan, you and Devin pulled against each other already in one super match.
Engin Terzi: Do you know exactly what you need to do? Is your game plan ready or are you still analyzing?
Tornike (Translator): As usual, I'm preparing all the angles, all the techniques that might be needed.
Levan Saginashvili: I have to prepare everything and ready for everything because the match can go into different ways and I have to be at least twice as strong than him in any movement. Okay, so just not to take any chance. Yeah. Levan, do you see any difference with Devin? Performance, abilities?
Levan Saginashvili: since the time that you pull against him. Do you think that he has improved or you think that it's the same, Devon? Devon, I would like to ask you about your match. What did you do? What did you do and what did you learn? I think I learned something.
Tornike (Translator): I don't know how to describe it. I don't know how to describe it. I don't know how to describe it. I don't know how to describe it. I don't know how to describe it. I don't know how to describe it.
Levan Saginashvili: I think he might have gotten a little bit stronger in some angles. But overall, I don't see any drastic change. Already back then, he was very strong. We could remember how easily he beat John Brzenk and Michael Todd right before our match. So already back then, he was very strong.
Engin Terzi: And I don't see him progressing very much on top of that. I understand. Anyway, so maybe time to time I ask you Devon's questions and let's see what this guy says. Okay.
Engin Terzi: Devon says, ask him how he feels that a 48-year-old heavyweight is the biggest threat to his crown. How do you feel about the fact that this is the most important year of the 20th century in your opinion? I would like to say that in this year,
Tornike (Translator): Only great respect to him and to his age. I wish I was at the same level as he is when I'm 48.
Engin Terzi: okay that's good that that was kind of provocative question but uh leon just answered with it's politely like very politely and so another one ask him how he would feel if he lost to someone so much lighter than him
Tornike (Translator): I will never know that. You better ask Tvetko about that. Oh, okay, okay.
Engin Terzi: Okay, that one will never know the answer, right? Yes. That's good, that's smart. That's smart, yeah. Another one. Engin, ask him if he thinks he needs to be much, much bigger than the last time he faced against me. Yes, yes, thank God.
Tornike (Translator): I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
Tornike (Translator): It was a promise, and everyone knew that it was going to happen, and that it was going to happen, and that it was going to happen, and that it was going to happen, and that it was going to happen.
Levan Saginashvili: I can say with all the honesty and placing a hand on my heart that I'm trying to be as light as I can. I'm only eating chicken breast, eating less carbs.
Levan Saginashvili: but gaining so much muscle that it's hard to control. I recently started training legs, only that added five kilos easy on top of my body weight. So I'm losing fat, gaining strength. I will really try to be even lighter than what I was before. Okay, what was his weight against Devon? What was your weight, Levan? Ratsanakant Devontan.
Tornike (Translator): I can't say for sure. I don't know if it's 135 or 134 meters. But I think it's about the same height. I think it's about the same height. I think it's about the same height. I think it's about the same height. I think it's about the same height. I think it's about the same height. I think it's about the same height.
Levan Saginashvili: I don't remember exactly. I think I was in 175, 178 range back then. Against Devon? Yes. 175 because when I arrived in Dubai, I lost some weight. So he remembers the 175 being the actual weight. And then what's your weight now, Devon?
Engin Terzi: Don't tell me 180. No, no. 180. But I see your shape. You are getting more and more like athletic looking, you know. Because I'm training legs. I'm training legs in one week, one time.
Tornike (Translator): I think five kilo of bomb legs plus. And you remember you said that you were 30% with the weights that you are lifting right now. David you reach 50%? 50%? Yeah, even more. Oh, even more. Okay, that's good. And no pain. It's very good. Yeah.
Tornike (Translator): I'm very motivated during this preparation.
Levan Saginashvili: I'm taking much more time in the gym now than I used to do before. So previously, during my previous two matches, I was in the gym maybe for two hours per day, but now I'm reaching even five. Now he's more dedicated. Now he's more dedicated and he didn't expect that much gain in just one month. So he's happy with the progress. You know, sometimes, Revan, when you rest...
Engin Terzi: because you train like many years years years years and then sometimes you train you rest six months and everything is healed up you know and then you even get more you know like more performance you know and looks like this what's happening to you because like how how many years have you been competing 15 maybe 15 yeah yeah and have you ever rested this long
Engin Terzi: Yeah, he never had such a long rest before. So 15 years of all the small, big injuries, everything, not only your wrist, everything is now healed up. And so I think you will be even at your best.
Tornike (Translator): Whatever happened, I remember it, and I remember it as if it was the beginning of my career. And I can say that Mola Khekhe, the founder of Isevvardzhi, was a very famous and well-known person. And there were periods, all periods, when I would go to Isevvardzhi.
Levan Saginashvili: Yes, that also plays a role and on top of that when I had such an injury I got a bit depressed and was fearing what would be the future of my career.
Levan Saginashvili: uh but now i'm so happy with what i have and what i have gained i'm really happy to be back to the training uh so even before i was sometimes even forcing myself to train but now i'm happy and hungry to train again
Tornike (Translator): I think that it is very important for Europe, very important for Marx, and very important for the whole world to understand what is happening in the world.
Levan Saginashvili: And overall, I'm very thankful to Devin, Rod, Mask, and Engin for the chance and for the improvement that they got me. Big thanks to Devin for getting me the treatment with stem cells and helping me out with the travel. I'm really thankful for that. And a special thanks to Rob.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, Rob is a great guy here. Rob really helped a lot of people. I have a question for Levan. Levan, you said that before in previous event, you said you were like two hours in the gym. You're talking about when you're getting ready for Morozov or Hermes match? Hermes sisters match, that's the story that they were talking about.
Tornike (Translator): It's been a long time since I last spoke to you. It's been a long time since I last spoke to you. It's been a long time since I last spoke to you. It's been a long time since I last spoke to you. It's been a long time since I last spoke to you. It's been a long time since I last spoke to you. It's been a long time since I last spoke to you. It's been a long time since I last spoke to you.
Levan Saginashvili: He meant the preparation for Ermes. He overall is not happy with that preparation. Not only he had some health issues, but he thinks that he was lazy in some aspects and during some times, which usually
Levan Saginashvili: gives that the result is not the best. So he feels that during the preparation for Morozov, he was more motivated. He maybe even rushed a bit where he shouldn't have. So he got what he got. I have another question for him.
Engin Terzi: David you see the video when Devon was talking about you and him after you put the belt on him, you both, you know? Okay, the question, like, listen, let's be honest, you know, there is nothing wrong to feel like bad about this. Like you are injured, you were injured and you were coming
Engin Terzi: You are not able to train. You don't even know if your wrist will be okay or not. And then you come in Istanbul and put in the belt around Devon that you have beaten 6-0. Like, how did you feel? Like, did you feel like, like I'm going to come and destroy all these guys and, you know, like the top will be mine again? Or how did you feel?
Tornike (Translator): You were in front of the audience, there was a crowd, there was a big crowd for Devon. What did you think? David you think that you would win and all of us would win? How did you feel? Well, I thought that I would win and all of us would win. I thought that I would win and all of us would win. I thought that I would win and all of us would win. I thought that I would win and all of us would win.
Levan Saginashvili: I always think, just give me some time and I will crush everyone. Yeah, that's good. I like that. He's so honest. He doesn't play games. He doesn't say, you know, oh, I was so happy for him. No, I didn't think that way. But that is the spirit of a warrior, you know. Yeah, even before my professional career, even when I was watching Pulling John,
Tornike (Translator): uh so every time uh i'm hungry and always coming for the top spot yeah um
Tornike (Translator): Overall, of course, I was very happy for Devon.
Levan Saginashvili: I was happy that he won the match and got the belt. But overall, my thought was that you can play with the belt for some time, but soon I will take it.
Tornike (Translator): Okay. Okay. Yeah. If, if that thought dies in me, then I will just retire from the sport. So as, as long as I'm here, that thought is with me. I will never stop. Yeah. And Sean,
Tornike (Translator): Moose, thank you for your superchat. Ken Levan show us the legacy hammer. I want you to show us the legacy hammer. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
SPEAKER_04: Christmas preparation. Oh.
Engin Terzi: Here it is. Levan, Devon just sent me a message. He says, Levan, take care of my hammer. Well, don't lose it. Soon I will take it from you. I'm joking, joking. He didn't send me this. No problem. Thank you.
Engin Terzi: he put his hammer right on the table yeah oh yeah that is the hammer huh yep come and take it if you can huh that's good that's good so okay so basically basically you are saying that you are in very good shape you are healthy everything is going according to the plan
Levan Saginashvili: And Devon can play with the belt a little bit. But you know what? Devon took the belt permanently. You know, right? Yeah.
Engin Terzi: So I would need to go to Canada to take the belt back. No, no, no, no. Because he won three title matches. So he has the belt permanently. Now in Istanbul, there will be a new belt. Yeah, because he beat Hermes, he beat Dennis, and then he beat Georgi. So when you win three title matches, and then you take the belt, like,
Engin Terzi: Samushia has two belts already because he won six title matches here. Yeah. Samushia has a collection. What do you think about Samushia? Samushia has a collection. Samushia has a collection. Samushia has a collection.
Tornike (Translator): He is a legendary sportsman. He has a lot of experience in Europe. And he is a footballer, right? Yes, he is. I think football is a very strong opponent. And I think he is a very strong opponent. And he is a very strong opponent. And I think he is a very strong opponent.
Levan Saginashvili: Samushia is already a legend to me. Evgeny though Sasho is a great threat and Samushia will have to prepare his best shape.
Engin Terzi: and bring the best performance on the table. When he beats Samushia Andreev, he will become even a bigger legend. Levan, there are two superchats and one is tripboard. Is he working hard for Devon's wrist more this time?
Engin Terzi: I don't exactly know what it means, like, for Devon's wrist, hard. Okay, is he working for Devon's wrist more this time? Like... Will it be harder for Devon this time, maybe? The question is, is he working for Devon's wrist more this time? Devon is much... Devon is much...
Tornike (Translator): Well, Deon is not a very interesting person. Deon is a very interesting person. If you look at Gasparin's works, you can see that Deon's words and actions are very similar.
Tornike (Translator): Devon's wrist and overall cupping is very strong and always have been strong.
Levan Saginashvili: I was saying this back with the match with Hermes, that he would be able to win this match thanks to his wrist. And even with this current match with Tsvetkov, where he stopped his top roll, it was very impressive. Yeah, but I saw a few rounds, Devon's wrist went back like this. And yeah. Okay, I know. Zorger Arifov, Meron Anatolievich Devonsov.
Tornike (Translator): Yeah, it's not a problem for Devin. Sometimes his wrist might bend back a bit.
Levan Saginashvili: uh but he does not lose the control of his wrist and uh still can i can fight uh for the center and then take it back yeah yes yeah michael's workspace 11 you are my favorite arm master congratulations on 800 000 subscription oh thank you very much thank you yeah
Engin Terzi: Another question from me to you, and then we can talk a little bit about... Evgeny my left hand has grown. That is exactly what I was going to ask now. This is what I was going to ask. How is your left doing?
Engin Terzi: Do you think that someday we will see you left-arm king as well? Because before your injury, before your professional career, your left arm was untouchable at the WAF. Still, I'm not sure. I don't know.
Tornike (Translator): It's hard to say if it's true or not. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
Tornike (Translator): I'm training my left arm too. And I can feel the progress. It's hard to say exactly but due to the injury of
Levan Saginashvili: both the left shoulder and the wrist. The left hand doesn't feel the same anymore. I will definitely try to get it back into a great shape. At the moment, I'm still focusing on the right more, but keep training the left. I really hope I can bring it back to the shape that it was before. Is there any plan? Do you think for next year, end of next year, there is a possibility for Supermatch?
Tornike (Translator): How do you think it will go in a year? Will it be possible? We'll see. I hope so. I hope so. I hope so. I hope so. I hope so. I hope so. I hope so. I hope so. I hope so. I hope so. I hope so. I hope so. I hope so. I hope so. I hope so. I hope so. I hope so. I hope so. I hope so. I hope so. I hope so. I hope so. I hope so. I hope so. I hope so. I hope so. I hope so. I hope so. I hope so. I hope so. I hope so. I hope so. I hope so. I hope so. I hope so. I hope so. I hope so. I hope so. I hope so. I hope so. I hope so. I hope so. I hope so. I hope so. I hope so. I hope so. I hope so. I hope so. I hope so. I hope so. I hope so.
Tornike (Translator): Yeah.
Levan Saginashvili: Engin knows me well. If I accept the match, I will bring the full performance of my left arm. But I don't want to disappoint my fans or anyone. I will look how it feels. If I can bring my top strength, I will definitely accept the match. But I will not accept it if I don't feel confident with my performance. But it is...
Engin Terzi: levon sometimes you know how it is since 2019 i didn't compete with left arm when you don't compete when you don't train it is like kind of getting weak you understand and you are not like so confident and like but once you really try if you put it here i think it will come back it doesn't come back because you don't focus you know this is i know you have injuries i also have injuries but
Engin Terzi: You are not that old. How old are you now? What are you now? 34, 33? 35. 35. You are still very young, you know. I mean, Patashin started arm wrestling at your age now, when you first started. Yeah, yeah. And I think that if you really want, you can do it. And your left arm, like, for example, like, who would be, like, who do you think right now is the best left arm in the world?
Engin Terzi: Right now, because it is proven, Morozov is ranked number one, he's champion. Now, Kurdecha is going to pull, and the winner of this will be pulling Laletin. Do you see anyone else that would cause problem to these people, these three? I don't think Laletin is going to win. I think Laletin is going to win.
Engin Terzi: Maybe not at the moment, but I think Laletin is a great candidate and he can be number one on the left. And you have pulled him at Zlotito, right? Left arm. He's a little bit stretched and from here you bring and beat him, as far as I remember.
Tornike (Translator): I am not a technical expert, but I am very familiar with Martskhenakhe. I am very familiar with Martskhenakhe. I am very familiar with Martskhenakhe. I am very familiar with Martskhenakhe.
Tornike (Translator): Rino Zloty said that he was going to leave, and then he said that he was going to leave because he was afraid that he would not be able to continue the discipline. He said that he was afraid that he would not be able to continue the discipline. He said that he was afraid that he would not be able to continue the discipline. He said that he was afraid that he would not be able to continue the discipline. He was afraid that he would not be able to continue the discipline.
Levan Saginashvili: Yes, I did fool with him and overhand always had less technique, but I think it was so crazy strong that at that time I would even beat Dennis on the left. Overall, there was no one to touch my left at that time.
Levan Saginashvili: I really hope to bring it back. I will work on that and I really hope that I can bring the same strength to my team. Up until then, I think Lletin is the favorite for the left. I had a podcast with Kurdecha and Morozov. Kurdecha said that he is now over 160 kilos.
Engin Terzi: more than 160 kilo. And whenever I asked them, if I'm not mistaken, whenever I asked them, what do they think about you versus Devon match? And both of them, instead of talking about the match, they both said that they will come. And they didn't exactly say this, but they implied that they will come and take the
Levan Saginashvili: belt both kurdecha and morozov how do you how do you think about this um
Tornike (Translator): It would be nice if you could tell us what you think about Levan. Well, he's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy.
Tornike (Translator): When I was 13 years old, I used to think that I was going to die, because I was 13 years old when I was born. And that's when I realized that I didn't want to die. Because if I die, I will die, and if I die, I will never be able to live again.
Levan Saginashvili: Well, they can always dream and continue dreaming. For Kurdecha, I can only advise that, especially for the top-roll puller, I want to advise to gain that match rate in a short time period. So maybe it would be even better for him to lose some
Engin Terzi: To lose some weight? Yes, for Kurdecha. Why is that? He thinks that 160 plus is too much for him. But the guy is like two meters and like five centimeters or three centimeters. Very tall guy. He doesn't look fat. He gets big, but he doesn't look any overweight, you know. He's only two meters tall.
Tornike (Translator): It's not about the height, especially with his technique, he needs to be very tight and close to the table.
Levan Saginashvili: and gaining weight you will be further from the table no matter what so just free advice to him from me but basically he's saying that basically he's saying that everyone is free to dream
Levan Saginashvili: Of course, they can always dream. And is that the Morozov, the guy who was one planning to beat me, but then lost to Tsvetkov? Levan, do you think that if Morozov didn't get ill and lost weight, he would still lose to Georgi? I don't think so. How do you think?
Tornike (Translator): I can certainly say that Gheorghi would take his risks anyways.
Levan Saginashvili: Maybe, maybe, possibly. It's hard to say after that, but I would guarantee that Gheorghi would still manage to take his risk. Levan, Gheorghi is one of the best top-rollers right in the world. Yes, Gheorghi has a very good pronunciation.
Tornike (Translator): Georgi's pronation is very strong. I have competed with him on Europe and World Championships multiple times, so I know it very well. His pronation is very good.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, Michael's Workspace, Levan, I believe you are number one left and right. He says you are number one left and right, yeah. And I don't know, often, often comes to my mind, some, if you, questions with sometimes, I forget while I'm listening. So if you talk about, if you talk about the,
Engin Terzi: this upcoming East vs. West XI. Quickly, I want to ask is we are together for 47 minutes. And what is your opinion about these matches? Like, for example, Vala vs. Aidarkhan. Both top rollers. You are familiar with Aidarkhan, Levan? Aidarkhan Stoichnopo.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, I think he doesn't remember. Aydar Khan is like in five different category world champion in WAF. This year he won 80kg. Where are you from?
Tornike (Translator): Kazakhstan? Yes, yes, I know. You know him, yeah? Very interesting. Very interesting. Very interesting.
Tornike (Translator): Yeah, this is a very interesting match. Of course, I'm rooting for Vala and I think he has a good chance.
Levan Saginashvili: Also, we know how good of an armwrestling school Kazakhstan has and it will be a very interesting match. Both go top row. Vala is very strong, but Aydar Khan is also very explosive. We will see. As I know, Aydar Khan is very quick.
Tornike (Translator): Yeah, very, very fast, yeah. It will be troublesome for Vala, his speed, and I would advise him to work on the speed specifically. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And guys, while we are here, I want to say again,
Engin Terzi: you can now do yearly subscription, yearly subscription, both East versus West and King on the Table. Of course, these are separately, separately. East versus West is $19.99. So next year we will have four events. So it is basically $79.96. But for the yearly subscription, if you, it is going to be,
Engin Terzi: We are going to offer this till January 15. So it is $69.99, almost $10 you are saving. So we will have great events next year. So don't miss this $10 discount. And then let's go to do another match. We asked to Rino versus Ivan Ivan Matyushenko, left arm. Rino is the world champion this year in Kazakhstan. In 110 kilo, Rino is very strong guy.
Engin Terzi: And we know Ivan Ivan Matyushenko, no need to even, uh, explain who he is and how do you see this match? This is world title match because Ivan was the world champion in this category, uh, 2021, and then the Russians couldn't compete anymore. And now Rino is the current champion. And the guy that can pull against them, you know, is Devon.
Engin Terzi: And Dadikyan, Dadikyan is now injured left arm. And maybe Alizhan, not maybe, Alizhan for sure. And Prudnik, we will talk about them. But right now, because Devon is now in the super heavyweight, we needed to give this title match. And how do you see this match? Well, Rino is a new fighter, a very successful sports fighter.
Levan Saginashvili: I think Rino is a great young athlete with great potential. But I think Ivan Matyushenko is too much for him at the moment. Yeah, I understand.
Engin Terzi: Ivan Matyushenko may not be ready for the super heavyweight top 10 guys because Ivan Matyushenko is 113, 114 kilo. And it may not be easy for him to pull against Zerano. If you remember, Zerano beat him at WAF when they were both 110 kilo. Now Zerano is like 130 kilo. It is very hard, you understand, for Ivan Matyushenko. So we need to find Ivan Matyushenko either super heavyweight guys but out of top 10.
Engin Terzi: or 115 kilo guys but 115 kilo who do you think they can pull against matushenko
Tornike (Translator): There is a 15-year-old boy who is going to beat Ivan Matyushenko. In March? Yes, because he is the opponent of Tuli Mosadzebni. I think that Ivan Matyushenko will not be able to beat him in March. I think that he will be able to beat him in March. I think that he will be able to beat him in March.
Tornike (Translator): At the same time, I can say that I have a relationship with Laledi. In 2015, I had a relationship with Rodling. Laledi was with Rodling.
Levan Saginashvili: Yeah, Ivan Matyushenko is very good. There's almost nobody that can be a good opponent for him. Evgeny I think that he would beat Morozov or Kurdecha. So maybe Lilletin could be a problem for him. And in 150 kg, maybe Prudnik.
Engin Terzi: But other than that, he sees nobody. Talking about left arm or right arm? Or both? Left. Left. Or left. Okay, how about Devin versus Ivan Matyushenko, 115 kilos? Right. Left. Oh, Ivan Matyushenko or both? Ivan Matyushenko for sure. Ivan Matyushenko would beat Devin, left arm? Yeah. Wow.
Engin Terzi: Do you remember Ivan Matyushenko in Laletin pull? Was it left arm or right arm? Right? I don't remember. But I think two rounds Ivan Matyushenko hook him, right? I mean, hook in Laletin is very, very hard thing to do. Very, very hard thing to do, yeah.
Levan Saginashvili: Yeah, I remember him even having great sparring matches on the left with Pushkar, even with Denis, great sparring matches. So I think there's a great potential with Ivan Matyushenko and he deserves more great matches.
Tornike (Translator): Yeah. Okay. Okay. I understand. And then let's talk about Marcio Barboza Petrenko. Uh, I don't know Marcio's current shape.
Levan Saginashvili: have not seen any last matches of his and overall i'm rooting for petrenko on this one and do you know robbie toppy from us yeah robbie toppy versus uh aymeric from france left arm oh you know yes i know
Tornike (Translator): It's a great match. I think due to the experience,
Levan Saginashvili: uh the french america has a slight edge uh hard to say but he thinks that the experience will play the role so i medic is the favorites yeah okay and then let's go to your friend iraqis rakashvili versus pauline oh
Tornike (Translator): I'm looking forward for this one. I'm happy to attend this match.
Levan Saginashvili: This is a very important match for Irakli and his career. I respect Paul Linn both as an athlete and as a human, but I really hope that Irakli can pull this off and win. You hope or you believe? I believe that Irakli will win, but it will not be easy.
Engin Terzi: Oh, okay. Okay. Okay. And let's go to a crazy match. Matt Mask versus Wagner Bortolato. Oh. Hey, Levan, do I need extra table? You need that match, last match in the event.
Engin Terzi: Last match. So if they break it, then we will not worry about the next match, right? You're right. You're right. We should do the last match. Yeah. I think I will talk with the guys. Not because it's the main event, but it is just the most risky match, dangerous match.
Tornike (Translator): Well, I think our sport is different from other people's sports. I don't know how to describe it. It's a kind of emotion that can't be expressed in words.
Tornike (Translator): This will be a great entertaining match to see and I advise everyone to
Levan Saginashvili: to watch it. Overall, I think that bringing this emotions and energy to arm wrestling, it's great and it's only beneficial for the sport. I just hope that they don't just break the hole or do some earthquakes. I hope that it will go alright. And who's winning? Right arm match, who's winning? Moscow.
Engin Terzi: Matt? Matt is going to win? Right arm? Okay. Okay. One second. Wagner is calling. Wagner is calling. He's not happy with you. And Zbigniew versus Argentino. Left arm, 95 kilo world title.
Tornike (Translator): There are very few examples. For example, there is a famous writer, Stashu Andres Mougo. I can say that he has a lot of problems with communication, but there is a lot of communication, I think.
Tornike (Translator): I have a lot of work to do and I have a lot of work to do in the future. If you follow me on Instagram, you will see that I have a lot of work to do.
Tornike (Translator): In general, there is no doubt about one technique, and I would like to mention the name of the technique, because it is very, in the sportsman's way, it is very easy to understand the style of the player. It is very universal.
Levan Saginashvili: Overall, this is a great match and they are both really good opponents for each other. We all know how good Taynov is and how versatile he is. He can even change the technique in the middle of the match, in the middle of the round.
Levan Saginashvili: Tavberidze is also gaining back and preparing a good shape. My advice to Tavberidze would be to prepare not just one technique, but to be diverse and to be ready for anything. And this will be a really hard match. Yeah, yeah. It can be a very tough match.
Levan Saginashvili: this will be a very long tough match and very close one and the referees referees will have will have a tough job yeah yeah uh SG records Roman says rest in peace table and triple is asking what was your most important match
Tornike (Translator): My guess is either Devon match or the Laletin match. That's my guess, but you know better of course.
Tornike (Translator): Both were very important matches for me, with Leighton and becoming the champion of Topie 8.
Levan Saginashvili: That was a new level for me. And beating Devin was an even higher level. So both were very important. And how about the upcoming match with Devin? Is that also important?
Tornike (Translator): Because I have been training for a long time. This is a new experience for me. I have a lot of motivation to train for a long time. And I don't think that I will ever be able to compete in a sports event. I don't think that I will ever be able to compete in a sports event.
Tornike (Translator): That's why I think it's important for us to make sure that we don't have to go back to the way we used to go back in the day. It's better to go back to the way we used to go back in the day. What do you think? After all this, I think it's time to go back to the way we used to go back in the day. I think it's time for a new level.
Levan Saginashvili: Yeah, this is a very important match for me, especially considering that coming back from the injury, this is a new challenge for me and going right into the title match with a great opponent. It's a great challenge and overall that's the way I prefer. Not to have any compromises, not to have any way back or to
Engin Terzi: uh have excuses uh just go directly for the title but I think I think this this will be the most important just my opinion because right now Devon has proved more than what Devon has proved before people level last time he beat Michael told he beat Dave Sheffield these guys yeah he beat he beat John
Engin Terzi: But right now, Devon is coming to pull Levan as someone who has beaten all the Europeans one after another.
Engin Terzi: He beat Prudnik, he beat Sandris, he beat Dave Chaffee, he beat... except with Gennady. And then he beat lately Hermes, and then Denis, and then Georgi Svetko. I think that right now, in my opinion, this is the highest level of the armwrestling. Today, I'm talking about. Armwrestling has never been this high level. And if Levan beats Devon right now,
Engin Terzi: I mean, it is beating a Devon that has proven more than before, you know. Like Levan beating Devon right now will prove that, you know, probably nobody is close to Levan. I mean, he wasn't close before as well, but this is just my opinion here. We will see. And then Oleg Zhokh versus Tutberidze, your countryman.
Engin Terzi: What do you know about Tutberidze? How much do you know about Tutberidze? Not very good. I don't know. But did you hear about him? Yes. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
Tornike (Translator): Yes.
Tornike (Translator): Yes, I have not trained with Avtandil myself. I have not called him. Overall, of course,
Levan Saginashvili: rooting for him, but I'm very happy that Oleg Zhokh is still active and competing. Evgeny considering after the tragic events, I'm really happy to see him at the competing table. Yeah, yeah. I'm inviting
Engin Terzi: Andriy Pushkar's recipe, his wife and his son to the April event to present the title. And okay, let's go. What you're saying, sorry, sorry.
Tornike (Translator): Well, I think it's very important to say that it means a lot to me. And I hope that when I am with you, I will be able to see you and talk to you.
Levan Saginashvili: You are a great person, Engin, for doing this, for keeping Pushkar's memory alive. And I'm sure it's a great honor for them to be there.
Engin Terzi: yeah yeah i'm happy that they accept it and yeah that that is how we should how we should do it here and mindagos versus daniel last fv match and we are finishing we are not gonna keep you this 1am over there i remember one time we did a crazy how many hours was it
Levan Saginashvili: Three hours? Five hours? You remember? Yeah. Yeah, but it will not be that long. It is one hour and ten minutes, but we are doing a few more matches and then we are finishing. Tonica, you were there? Yes, I remember. You were translating that one? I think. I think I was translating one of the long ones. I think that was... Okay, okay.
Levan Saginashvili: So who is winning, Daniel or Mindaugas Lewa? Prokofchiki versus Mindaugas. I don't know. I'm sorry, but I just don't know. He says that he can't tell. It's very hard to say.
Tornike (Translator): yeah okay and today he got a gift from who what's that is this dragon ah yes this is the ear of a dragon and he messed up
Engin Terzi: This is for them. Yeah, I will be the dragon. Okay. If you don't know about the one, how about Alicia Muratov versus Prudnik? Oh, incredible match, huh? Yes. .
Levan Saginashvili: Muratov is very strong but I think that the old Prudnik will win this one.
Engin Terzi: you know you know levan whenever i saw first time prudnik like i it was already my careers like 17 years i was honest and the first time i put me and then whenever you say now old prudnik i'm like old prudnik come on it's just kidding yeah and i want to ask you then samusha versus vladimir myro do you know myro or no um
Engin Terzi: Vladimir Maiorov won 80 kg in Moldova 2018 over Bojidar, Plemen Dimitrov, Vladislav Krasovsky. He might not remember his name, but he thinks he will remember from the face.
Engin Terzi: yeah yeah i think okay if you don't know much about him then then this is hard to say but samusha and him will have a minute long one minute long hook match you will see very long match and jumbers in krasimir oh 105 kilo john john yeah yeah
Tornike (Translator): Last time we saw John, he lost so much weight and he looked so lean.
Tornike (Translator): it's crazy for such an age uh he he probably knows something that we don't okay last two matches hutchings versus david dadikian for 105 kilo world title oh it's uh
Tornike (Translator): This is one of the best matches of the card. It will be very tough, very close to even but that would give maybe five percent advantage to Todd Hutchings.
Tornike (Translator): 55? Yeah, 55 against 45. If Todd manages to get the strap, that will increase his chances. Then he has a good chance.
Engin Terzi: But that's the question, if he can get the strap. If not, it would be tough for him. I understand. And the last match is Kurdecha versus Morozov left arm.
Tornike (Translator): In this way, I think it is very important for Morozov's work. Well, there are two variants. First, Morozov's work is done, and if Morozov doesn't like it, Morozov can't do anything about it. Of course, there is one variant where Morozov wants
Levan Saginashvili: It's really tough to say. We have not seen Kurdecha pull for a while now. I see there are two scenarios. Either Kurdecha manages to get Morozov's wrist
Levan Saginashvili: And that way he has a chance to win. Or if Morozov manages to get the hook, then it will be very tough for Kurdecha. And also considering that Kurdecha has gained the weight, it might have not been the best for his endurance and also
Engin Terzi: Considering that Morozov can still give a fight with a lost wrist, I would give a slight edge to Morozov. Okay, the last Superchat is Andrei Chera. Thank you for your Superchat. Levan, are you training your press or defense against the dynamic attack they will use against Denis? Good luck next year. Thank you very much.
Levan Saginashvili: I was keeping this a secret. I was keeping this a secret, but since you asked, yes, I'm training.
Engin Terzi: okay i'm training the press okay and and the thing is yesterday i was a guest at travis's program and i hermes was also there and somehow it ended up that i said travis versus hermes left arm match for april 20th
Engin Terzi: And if Travis does not back up, you know, on April 20th, there will be Travis Bajent versus Hermes Gasparini left arm match. Who is winning that? Bajent will win. Can you say that? Bajent will be in good shape. He will be in good shape. If Bajent is strong,
Levan Saginashvili: Yes, it's hard to say Travis's current shape. If he manages to get back what he used to have, he would definitely win. But with today's budget, it's hard to say anything.
Levan Saginashvili: Yeah, but me as a fan, I would gladly watch that match. Travis being back on the left, I would happily see this and looking forward to that match.
Engin Terzi: Okay, I understand. Anyways, Levan, we are done. One hour, 20 minutes. Thank you very much for your time. And thank you, Tornike. Is there anything that you want to say lastly, Levan, to Devon? He asked you so many questions. Would you want to say anything for him? Would you tell him, like, I mean, anything? Devon, it's my pleasure, Todd.
Tornike (Translator): Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,
Tornike (Translator): I can see that Devon's questions are around my weight. He's already making
Levan Saginashvili: making excuses when he will lose to blame it on my weight uh i'm not forcing him to be any weight he he can be 150 or more but if he wants to compete in super heavyweights i am the king there so you have to he should either go down to heavyweight category or if he is put in the super heavyweight category he should stop talking about the weight right because yes he he
Levan Saginashvili: Yes, he can gain as much as he wants. He can be 150, 160, how much he wants. You can eat however you want, but you've got just... Yeah, I'm not gaining the weight by myself. This is just how I am. So you have to face me.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, yeah. And Levan, first time you pulled against him, there was a serious tension, really serious tension, you know. And we know that how Devon can be like very, how to say, un-nice whenever he has a match.
Engin Terzi: you know, because of the psychological games, you know, he can say a lot of things to just like disturb the opponent, make him mad. And last time I remember, you also get upset. But since then, he buy you ice cream. Do you expect, do you expect, right now he's talking about you
Engin Terzi: like you are the mountain you know you are the like giant titan he calls you titan yesterday and do you think that it will continue like this or do you think that he will start to be a little bit you know spicy you know um
Tornike (Translator): . . . . . . .
Tornike (Translator): I think that this is a very important moment. I am very happy that this moment has come. I am very happy that this moment has come. I am very happy that this moment has come. I am very happy that this moment has come. I am very happy that this moment has come. I am very happy that this moment has come.
Levan Saginashvili: He's continuing the previous question that weight is not the critical importance in armwrestling. We saw that also with the Devon versus Tvetkov match. You can be heavier, but you can be lighter.
Levan Saginashvili: But the top deciding factor is the technique and the quality of the fight. So for Devin, we all saw that the optimal weight for him is around 120. Evgeny if he gains more, 130 or higher, it might be even less beneficial for him. So the weight can be only an excuse in this situation.
Tornike (Translator): Yeah, he wanted to add on top of the previous question.
Tornike (Translator): There are many other ways to make money. The second way is to work for us. To work for you, but also to work for me. To work for you, but also to work for me. To work for you, but also to work for me. To work for you, but also to work for me. To work for you, but also to work for me. To work for you, but also to work for me. To work for you, but also to work for me.
Tornike (Translator): because there are no people in the situation. If there were, I think we would be able to do it, because the republicans, I think, would not be able to do it. If there were people, I would not be able to do it, I would not be able to do it, I would not be able to do it.
Levan Saginashvili: I think Devin has learned that he should be good with me because anytime he tries to be rude or impolite or aggressive, this only motivates me further and makes me angry. So now it's his strategy to start with more sweet talk. Respectful. And respectful talk.
Levan Saginashvili: Overall, I'm a very friendly person by nature. So I don't try to destroy anyone unless they make me angry. So this is just his another strategy. And I think it would be better for him to keep the sweet word. Yeah, it's better for him, but will he keep it? What is your guess? He will continue to destroy?
Levan Saginashvili: I think at least two months before the match, he will have to start to become more aggressive. I think he just can't do any other way. So this is in his nature that he cannot stop himself. Whenever he gets closer, he will get aggressive.
Tornike (Translator): I don't know if it's appropriate to say this, but I think that a minister's job is not to work for Magidastanid and Redigovsidzakhis. A minister's job is to work when he is in power, and he has to work for the people.
Tornike (Translator): I think that's the way Devin is. I know him very well already.
Levan Saginashvili: For him, match doesn't start at the table during the ready-go. For him, the match starts right after it's announced. So that's the way he is and that's the way he needs to get into the role and into the mindset for fight preparation. I guess that's the way the fans love him to be in that state. So he thinks sooner or later,
Engin Terzi: he will have to become more aggressive. OK, I understand. Yeah. And yeah. Let's see how it will be. Let's see how. You say something, Levan? I will be very aggressive also. Levan, you know, Devon doesn't win normally.
Engin Terzi: If Devon usually holds, if he knows that he's going to beat the guy and then he really destroys him mentally, emotionally, physically, you know, he holds and talks and a little bit mocks his opponent. Do you have that kind of phobia that what if he stops you? What if he starts talking to me like that?
Engin Terzi: Like, do you do any kind of empathy or like Devon's opponents so far that Devon, when Devon wins, how he talks in this, like, does it, does it like make you afraid to be in such position? Um, um, um,
Tornike (Translator): to fight for their rights, to fight for their positions. But there is no other way to deal with this situation. Well, what I would like to say is that Tevon is a very good player in this field. He is a great player and a great player.
Tornike (Translator): He was not afraid of anything. He was not afraid of anything. He was not afraid of anything. He was not afraid of anything. He was not afraid of anything. He was not afraid of anything. He was not afraid of anything. He was not afraid of anything. He was not afraid of anything. He was not afraid of anything.
Tornike (Translator): In other words, Genadiy Muakhekha said that he did not want to. And I was in Genadiy's shoes, and I was very happy to hear that he did not want to.
Tornike (Translator): If it doesn't work out, and you have to go to the gym, then you have to go to the gym. And of course, in our country, everything is the same. Because it's a sport, and you have to go to the gym. And if you have to go to the gym, you have to go to the gym. And if you have to go to the gym, you have to go to the gym. And if you have to go to the gym, you have to go to the gym.
Levan Saginashvili: Yes, so if we look at all the recent matches by Devin, would that be Hermes, Denis or Tsvetkov? Well, except for Gennady, he already had the psychological war was already won by him at the beginning of the match.
Levan Saginashvili: He defeated his opponents mentally already before the match, which played a huge role in how the match turned out. In case with Gennady, we all saw how in the first round he was trying to break Gennady mentally. I was by Gennady's side that day and I hope that I helped him also, but Gennady managed not to break
Levan Saginashvili: mentally from the first round. And that's why he managed to give the equal fight to Devin afterwards. So I think this is very important. Me as an athlete, I'm preparing for the match both mentally and physically. I'm ready for the war. I'm ready for the lengthy battle. I don't have like a false hope that I will win all the rounds in one second.
Levan Saginashvili: I'm ready for the heavy battle and he just can't break me mentally from the same way he can do with other opponents. And his previous win, does it give him any psychological advantage?
Tornike (Translator): Well, I think it's possible. I think it's possible. I think it's possible. I think it's possible. I think it's possible. I think it's possible. I think it's possible. I think it's possible.
Tornike (Translator): And I also think that this is the way it was, this is the way it is, and I would like to say that all of us are the same. We are all the same, and I think that this is the way it is, and there is no doubt about it.
Levan Saginashvili: Maybe there's a slight advantage for me because Devon already knows how it feels to lose to me and he already has this planted into his head so it might be
Levan Saginashvili: disadvantage for him in that regard. For myself, I don't want to think about my previous victory and I don't want to relax on this one just because of this victory. I'm coming fully prepared. I won't be less prepared just because I won the previous time.
Tornike (Translator): So, it doesn't give advantage to me. I will have to bring my full performance, especially against such a dangerous opponent like him. There is a moment when you say, for example, if you want to win a match, how do you think you can win it?
Tornike (Translator): He was born in Levan and he was born in Levan. He was born in Levan. For me, this is very important, because...
Tornike (Translator): In other words, it is possible to say that it is possible, but it is impossible to say that it is possible. It is impossible to say that it is possible, but it is impossible to say that it is possible. It is impossible to say that it is possible. It is impossible to say that it is possible. It is impossible to say that it is possible. It is impossible to say that it is possible. It is impossible to say that it is possible. It is impossible to say that it is possible. It is impossible to say that it is possible.
Levan Saginashvili: There's another moment that fans will be expecting him to win as easily as he did the previous time. So even if he wins, but not as easily as it was before,
Engin Terzi: some evil mouths might say that here you can see that it's not easy anymore and uh who cares yeah yeah i mean yes i mean just listen listen when you talk about these guys everyone needs to be respectful it doesn't matter who is
Engin Terzi: if Laleti wins or Hermes wins, if Devon wins or Levon wins, these guys are like very, very special human beings. These guys are like... I mean, it is very, very hard to...
Tornike (Translator): achieve you know what they have done you know and then people talking just ignore them leon ignore them i mean you you are like i mean you have nothing to prove
Levan Saginashvili: uh yeah it's it's not only with the fans it it might be uh uh too high expectations from the uh maybe even out athletes too like I had the
Levan Saginashvili: 4-0 victory against Hermes and then we becoming not able to continue and Hermes' celebration like it was his victory. Overall, this is like a matter of expectations and it might be between the athletes too. I mean, it doesn't matter when you come to the fourth round, you win it, then it's over, you know, I mean,
Engin Terzi: There is, I mean, you continue or you don't continue and it doesn't really matter. And when you say like Hermes, Hermes, after he beats La Lettine, he said the belt will come to Italy this year. Do you agree with that Lewa?
Tornike (Translator): Yeah, only if maybe he makes the same belt in Italy somehow with his own master, maybe that way, but no other way.
Tornike (Translator): If you look at it from the point of view of social problems, for example, in 2014, it was clear that there were all sorts of problems. And if you look at it from the point of view of tennis and wrestling,
Tornike (Translator): He says that probably he thinks there's a slight
Levan Saginashvili: different case with him. For example, Hermes or Denis, they could not continue the match and it's all right. But in case with him, if he can't continue the match, it becomes a critique. So probably this is maybe because he's been undefeated for so long. Yeah, because he's like a mountain in people's eyes.
Engin Terzi: Any kind of small weakness on people's eyes, oh, okay, it's possible, you know, it's possible. Because everyone is here and Levan is here. So whenever people see that Levan, like, gas out, you know, and Hermes is going like this, people said, okay, there is a possibility. That's why. Evgeny when they do this, it just shows how great Levan is, in my opinion, yeah.
Levan Saginashvili: You said that when Devon is talking trash, it is not good for him because it makes you angry. But whenever we talk about
Engin Terzi: Morozov in Kurdecha dreaming to be number one you say it's good to be everyone can dream you know and then when when Devon says like this oh Devon you can keep my belt temporarily and then when when when Hermes said the belt is coming to Italy only if he makes the same belt in Italy you know somewhere you know so you think that when you talk like this they are motivated more motivated
Tornike (Translator): Maybe I am motivating them more, but that won't help them. Yeah, yeah. So he's not trying to motivate them. It is exactly how he feels and how he believes he is safe. Okay. Yeah.
Tornike (Translator): Of course, they are athletes and they want to win and that's their goal and that's the way it should be. But what can you do? I'm not giving up anything.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, so, yeah, okay, I understand, I understand. Levan, thank you very much, thank you for your patience, thank you for your time and everything. And I just can't wait you to come back and have a big battle, yeah. This is mine. Yeah. Levan, you remember, you remember this?
Engin Terzi: Anyways, thank you very much, Tornike. Thank you. You take care and thanks to everyone once again. Guys, the yearly subscription is now available for events next year. And then you save $10. It's $69.99. You can go to CoreSports. You can buy CoreSports, King of the Table, East vs. West. Both are available.
Engin Terzi: Thank you very much. And that, that is getting bigger. That's getting bigger, but still, still not there. Little bit more, little bit more. Hey, hey, okay. You show your forearm and you, you bring another question to my mind. How much are you far from the, your best size, your prime size? What was it? Your prime cold. And now how much is cold or how much was warm and how much is now warm?
Tornike (Translator): There is not much difference between the two. The maximum is 2 cm. But there is a big difference between the two. In my opinion, there is not much difference between the two.
Levan Saginashvili: I am not too far off by size, maybe maximum two centimeters. Strength wise, I'm sure that I will be getting to my peak.
Levan Saginashvili: Especially when I get to the same level that I was for the preparation for Morozov, I will be unbeatable and Devin will have no chance against me. That's good. That's a good mindset. No need to be fake and nice. Evgeny if I don't reach that level, Devin still doesn't have the chance.
Tornike (Translator): Baba, do you agree that when he said that if you are 3% less, and if Devon is 3% more, he will destroy you? Yes, I agree. 6% is not enough. 3% is more or less than 6%. I don't think it's enough. I don't think it's enough. 6% is not enough. 6% is not enough.
Levan Saginashvili: It's very strange. How did he calculate those three and three percentages? Maybe even with the 6%, where did he see those 6% difference? I think it was 86, 96% difference that day.
Engin Terzi: I can give him this 3%. He still can't do nothing. Oh, Lewa, now you are provoking him. You are provoking him. Yeah. You are asking for it. You are asking for it. But listen, he can make you angry. I know. Yeah, yeah. I know he'll find something.
Engin Terzi: to get me angry, I expected. Yeah, I'm waiting. I'm sure that he will find something to make me angry. OK. So Michael Workspace Levan, you should see it as a sign of respect if they celebrate even the smallest type of victories against you. That is how dominant you are. Let's go.
Engin Terzi: he says that like if people are happy with when you when they win a round one round it means that how great you are the guy agrees with me okay this time don't show me your arm or hammer or anything because i will listen i will ask you another question you take care of yourself tourniquet and take care
