Unknown: Hmm.
Mindaugas Tarasaitis: I was trying to be a bit early just to make sure that everything works well. How are you doing? How are you hanging? All good?
Mindaugas Tarasaitis: yeah fine and you yeah it's just a nice period like holiday period you know all the families here and stuff like that so it's fun that's good that's good i'm happy that you had good time and you guys are not so celebrating it now right no we we this is different culture we don't we don't celebrate yeah
Host/Interviewer: But you still wait for the new year, right? What's that? You still wait for the new year. I mean, people over here does. I don't. I don't even celebrate my own birthday. I see. Hi, can you hear me? Oh, hello. Hey, hey. Hello, Daniel. Okay, how do I...
Host/Interviewer: Okay, I move this way. So we are all together. We are live. Yeah. So how is everything? Dania, how are you? Very good. We just finished the training session. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Listen, Dania, listen. If you do this, what if he just cancels the match?
Daniel Procopciuc: It's pumped after training. In reality, it's not like that. Oh, it's not like this. Okay, okay. You don't have to be scared. It's okay. No, no. I think Daniel cancelling a match is what I should be worried about more than him. I'm not going to cancel a match for sure. No, no, no.
Host/Interviewer: It was a joke. It was just a joke. I know, I know. Yeah, okay, good, good. And how is the form, Dania? Good form? Yes, yes, a good form. He's starting to peak. Okay, so good timing, good timing. And you're going to beat this skinny guy? I think so.
Mindaugas Tarasaitis: you think so okay and you and you mean diverse yeah so i'm also i don't know this match somehow is very it's very special to me so um you know normally i talk a lot of yeah this time somehow i felt like daniel is already in position where you know he proved himself very well so maybe it's now time for me to get a bit more quiet and just work my
Mindaugas Tarasaitis: Worked towards a good win. I don't even want to talk that much or trash talk so much this time. I feel like I'm much more focused just on delivering. Do you guys even remember how many times you guys pulled with right arm? Like, did you guys pull about like 20 times maybe? Do you remember how many times I pulled with right arm? A lot. A lot. A lot. A lot. A lot. A lot. A lot.
Host/Interviewer: 20 times maybe? No? I will tell you what I remember. Last time you guys pulled in Antalya, one match, Daniel won, right arm. And before that, you pulled in the top eight, 78 kilos in Istanbul, and then Minda Aguas won two times. So it's now 2-1.
Mindaugas Tarasaitis: I think you missed something at the Europeans in Lithuania. But it was before, it was before 2001. No, no, I think it was... Oh, it was after 78, yeah, you're right. And then he beat you there, what, twice? No, on the right only... Okay, yeah, maybe twice, twice, yeah. Okay, so now Daniel 2, 3, you are 2. And then... You tell me.
Host/Interviewer: I really have no memory. In Moldova, supermatch, 3-0. So now it is 6-2. But before that, the Moldova, you also beat them in the final in a normal tournament.
Host/Interviewer: So you beat him one time or two times? One time you beat him or two times? Only once, I think. Only once. So it is like 6-3. And then what else? And Nemirov maybe? In 2017, Daniel lost at Zloty Tur. Twice? Only right, Aron. Left and right.
Host/Interviewer: Both arms, left and right. Daniel won? Daniel lost. No, no, no, 2016, 2017 you won. Yeah, yeah, 2016, yes. Yeah, yeah. Okay, so it looks like, you know, he's every three wins, you have like two wins or every six wins, you have four wins or like this, yeah.
Mindaugas Tarasaitis: Yeah, so to me, Daniel, he proved that he's really, really good. So I feel like it's now my job to level up and maybe equalize the score a bit more. So he is for sure my favorite. Yeah, on the paper, yes, yes. And the question, can you beat this guy in your head? No, in my head, I'm always beating him. Don't worry about that. Like I have.
Host/Interviewer: Oh, okay. Because, listen, when you lose this many times, like, it is normal that I ask you this question. Like, whenever, like, he's beating you more than you beat him. And so it seems like last three times, two times at the Europeans and one time at WAP, he beat you. So do you feel like, you know, it was even a discussion at the arm wars, I remember. Like, you were saying that you need to improve your hook or something. You remember? Yes.
Mindaugas Tarasaitis: I feel like I look at the situation in a bit different way. Over these many years, me and Daniel are both progressing somehow. He's getting stronger, I'm getting stronger. Both of us are still beating many of our opponents, which we maybe couldn't beat before. Throughout this whole process, I'm just happy about my good improvements.
Mindaugas Tarasaitis: Evgeny if I'm maybe not really trying my best, I'm just kind of having fun and enjoying the sport, having a nice good hobby, traveling a little bit. But this time is different?
Mindaugas Tarasaitis: I think it is a little bit different. Yeah, it's about time. It's about time. But yeah, what I was trying to say that it's never really made, I was never really sad about Daniel meeting me, you know, it's just another day. Let's keep improving, keep pushing. These like, you know, it was still, I was enjoying the progress, you know, I never felt like I lost, you know, I'm just pushing forward, pushing forward. And now I feel like me, we are both at a very good level.
Mindaugas Tarasaitis: so i will for sure focus a bit more on daniel now which i'm doing so there is no mental block i don't think so no i'm just uh that's good that's good that's good that's good and how do you see your chances to win um so yeah i was thinking about it myself a little bit and sometimes in some situations i um
Mindaugas Tarasaitis: Not necessarily with him, but sometimes there's a situation where the chance is maybe a little bit low. Evgeny if it exists, it's a little bit low. And here, I have to be honest, I feel like it's more than that. I feel like it's quite good. I feel like it's quite good. I can't give you any percentage, but it's more than a small chance. So more than his chance of winning?
Host/Interviewer: He still must be the favorite. No, no, listen. Objective-wise, it's different. I'm asking your eyes. My eyes? I feel like I have 55% against his 45% chance. Okay, so that's what I wanted to hear. So 55% that you have a chance. So that's good that you come immediately. Of course, I know that I'm not going to be able to prove you guys before I actually do it, you know?
Host/Interviewer: But in my mind I feel quite confident. Listen, who cares about what we think, you know, just focus on what we believe in and have confidence, you know, just ignore the rest. And what does Daniel see, his chances? He says 55-45 for himself.
Daniel Procopciuc: Mindaugas has always been an uncomfortable opponent for Daniel. Very good puller. And he doesn't give the percentage. He thinks it's a close match. Oh, that's why he thinks it's close, yeah? Yeah, yeah.
Daniel Procopciuc: I understand. It's easier for Daniel to fight with pullers who have more raw power but are less uncomfortable. Yeah, yeah. Binda Agos is very smart and very technical. He is not like a normal art master, like an artist. He's at the table.
Host/Interviewer: So he knows where to attack and that's why very difficult match for anyone who is pulling against him. Yeah, that's for sure. So it is quite interesting that Daniel is recognizing, you know, the threat. I guess, yeah, I guess, you know, he had so many matches with me. I feel like even if he won, sometimes those matches were not that comfortable to him also, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure. Like very seldom he beat you, like comfortably.
Host/Interviewer: I remember in Moldova match that you hit him like 30 times, you know, like boom, boom, boom, boom. You remember? Evgeny in the last WAAF in Antalya, it was very, very dangerous match for him. And I think that that match took some energy from him before Aydar Khan match. Yeah. Yeah. It was a long match. Yeah. Very, very, yeah. And we will see, we will see. And Mindaugas, do you have any, like,
Host/Interviewer: b c plan or is this mostly like just a all way a you know um
Mindaugas Tarasaitis: The plan A is very clear and I would say that it's quite strong. The plan A is not to simply pin him. That's not plan A. I don't think it's an option. I don't think it will work through the six or whatever rounds. So the plan A is to use a bit more shoulder, a bit more maybe sideways pressure. And that thing I'm quite happy about.
Mindaugas Tarasaitis: Just recently we were practicing and training a little bit and it feels pretty good. I feel like I found my angle which I can use to maybe become more efficient than Daniel in that position where we get stuck. I feel like I can maybe outlast Daniel just because of the different position this time. Yeah, but do you remember the way that you beat him in Istanbul?
Host/Interviewer: and and do you remember do you remember or not like do you watch them yeah like is that the plan uh what do you have in mind exactly tell me like because i i i don't know i i i think that in that match you were a little bit different instead of hidden hidden hidden you were like more like yes yes yes
Host/Interviewer: And my elbow being a bit more forward was somehow quite comfortable also. So many small details which I will try to maybe combine and use now. Daniel, a question for you. How is it that you lost against him in Istanbul and then you went to the Europeans? I think in the Europeans, you beat him more comfortably, right? He kind of hooked you and beat him, yeah. And then...
Host/Interviewer: Somehow in Antalya, you again had a big problem with him. Why is this happening, like changing so much? He is taking your wrist, you're hooking him, and then he is again taking your wrist and you are like this. Is it because of the form or you guys are doing different things every event and improving, you know, more, you know each other. You do counter-attack, you know, for what happened earlier.
Daniel Procopciuc: So, some part is injuries. In Antalya, before Mindaugas, he had a match with Yanis.
Daniel Procopciuc: And he beat him, but he tired his wrist. He used a lot of pressure on his wrist. And that may affect the match with Mindaugas. It wasn't too long, right? Yanis' match was like maybe five seconds or something. It wasn't too long, but any match with a lot of pressure, because it's hard to rotate Yanis, to attack a little with the right hand. And I hit him with the right hand, but I couldn't rotate him at all.
Daniel Procopciuc: Yeah, it wasn't long, but Janic puts a lot of pressure. He didn't beat him with his wrist fully cupped. He was more like a side dragging with the supination side.
Mindaugas Tarasaitis: and also I think it was it was also maybe mostly my problem uh both in Antalya and uh Vilnius I feel like I was not 100 some health issues just small things like that so I feel like maybe it was just me and not being able to bring my best shape um so it looks like we are arm wrestling and this is like kind of
Host/Interviewer: hard on the joints and you cannot be 100% all the time. And probably whenever you are fresher, maybe you make the difference. Whenever he is healthier, he makes a difference. And this time, any health issues? I'm good so far. I'm good. Very good. I feel like I have more experience, which will help me to maintain my good shape. And Daniel, are you as healthy as? Yeah.
Daniel Procopciuc: As always. He trains non-stop. Every day he trains. The form, he doesn't know. The weights are rising, but at the table, he doesn't have an opponent to compare. This is the world title match.
Host/Interviewer: I will try to like, I already invited and he was honored and he wants to come. But as only he cannot get out of Russia. You know who I am talking about? Vala Zolaev. Yeah. And if he can come outside of Russia, the winner pulls him. Right. Yeah. And if he cannot, then winner of you pulls most likely the second best guy of AMC, which is Arthur Makaro.
Daniel Procopciuc: Great, awesome. So it's very interesting, very interesting category. Yeah. And Daniel, this year you're going to go 75 at WAF? So he doesn't know exactly. He weighs around 78 kilos.
Host/Interviewer: If he said if he will gain weight, maybe like 82, maybe he will go to 80. But if he doesn't, he will stay at 75. And if he goes to 80 kilo, then if he wins this match, he will be the world champion at 75. And if he goes 80, probably he's not going to pull 75 anymore.
Daniel Procopciuc: He wants to have four belts. Oh, 85, 75, right, left? Wow. Wow.
Host/Interviewer: Yeah, but to have this 75 belt, you need to defend it. If you go higher weight category, if you cannot go down, the belt... And he can't grow more than 80 kilos. He can go both categories. Yes, yes. Okay, I understand. I understand.
Host/Interviewer: It will be, it will be incredible match. I just can't believe, like, do you know how it is for me? You have the coin, you just flip, you know, either comes tail or the other side and like your match will be like this, you know? Yeah. I kind of think that, I kind of think that possibly you will take, but can you finish? I don't know.
Host/Interviewer: And I don't even know, you know, maybe Daniel is just too strong. Maybe I can't even take his wrist anymore. Yeah, maybe. Maybe there's also a possibility because it looks like his endurance may be better than yours if the match is close. If the match is close,
Mindaugas Tarasaitis: Yeah, but if you take everything, then maybe he gets exhausted. I don't know. I think they both have good endurance, but maybe my problem before was that I was stuck in a bad position, the position which was more efficient for him. So this time I'm trying to change something so I stop him in a better position so where I maybe can outlast him. So we will see.
Host/Interviewer: We will see. I only believe one thing. If Daniel is healthy, his elbow is healthy, only with outside is very hard to beat him. You need to control his pronation. You need to turn here. Like only pull, pull, pull. You'll hit the wall here, you know, just like super strong, you know. But if you also can turn here, then maybe.
Host/Interviewer: Maybe Daniel wants to try top roll round one. He tried top roll one time in Lithuania. He didn't like this. But let's ask him. Maybe he likes it. After Lithuania, he started to train the top roll. Yeah, but in Lithuania, he tried one time. He get boom. And then second start.
Host/Interviewer: Inside, yeah. Yesterday, Ivan Matyushenko was my guest, and he says, Daniel is good, maybe he top-rolls Mindaugas. And I said, maybe not. But Daniel is thinking that his top-roll now is better? He can say now that his right arm is better than his left.
Host/Interviewer: That's what he can say. No, no, no, no. His top roll now is better than before. Because his left arm is not top roll, only hook. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, but his right arm is now... Does he believe that he can beat Mindaugas with top roll? He thinks at training, maybe he can, but at the competition, he doesn't think so.
Host/Interviewer: Uh-huh. Maybe. Okay. Okay. So, Mindaugas, you have your answer about round one. It doesn't seem like he would go for it, right? Yeah, but he top-rolled some other guys. He top-rolled Corey Miller, and then he top-rolled Douglas. Yeah, yeah. You top-rolled, yeah. Yeah. Let's see. Corey Miller.
Mindaugas Tarasaitis: Corey Miller and Douglas, I think he only did it in the later rounds, not at the beginning. But with Samushia, he was trying to top him. Maybe I can beat him in a hook. Can you please translate that part? David you translate it?
Host/Interviewer: I think he understood. He doesn't think so. He wants to see them. Round one. How do you call when you kill yourself? You call it suicide? Suicide, yeah. There are much better ways than going inside with Daniel. That's a terrible way. That's a terrible way.
Host/Interviewer: Yeah, but armwrestling is kind of interesting sport that like you beat Cercaso and Cercaso last time we meet, he beat Daniel and then Daniel beat you last time you meet him. Like Daniel, if you would ever pull Cercaso again, what would you do difference? Because I remember in Romania, you guys had the final match. I think you took second place. Where was the problem? Looks like he controlled your
Daniel Procopciuc: like a pronator, you know, like a pronator and then he drags you like this. What would you do differently if you pulled him again?
Daniel Procopciuc: Yeah, so he will not change something. He said his right arm has been injured for four years, and now he started to recover and actually surpass his left arm. So he would pull the same, the force would be higher. This is thanks to you again, because at his versus, he mostly pulled the right arm. And so he focused on his right arm.
Host/Interviewer: Yeah, listen, this is his problem. His left arm is way too strong for many people. It's really hard to find an opponent for him. Okay. Yeah. With right arm, there are like more closer guys for you. But do you know what would be the good match? What is the guy's name? Like from Kazakhstan, 80 kilo. He did finale with Oleg Zhokh.
Host/Interviewer: He just completed the AMC. Now he has 100 kg. I think he was 95 kg at AMC. But at WAF he was 80 kg. 80 kg. You and him, 85 kg would be very good. Hey, listen. Would you pull... 85 kg? Yes. 85 kg?
Host/Interviewer: Wow, would be incredible match. Yeah. I would just like bring for like 24 hours food and drink with me. And then watch the match, you know, long hook match like for like three hours every round. Mindaugas, who would win that match? We are talking about left hand, right? Left arm. Yeah.
Mindaugas Tarasaitis: Well, it looks like Resh is maybe even stronger because lately he was really doing very well. Yeah, he was 85 kilos. Maybe I would even go with Resh. What's that? Maybe I would even go for Sedrakin, Resh Sedrakin. He would beat Daniel? I think so, I think so. Now, Daniel, you need to beat Mindaugas even more.
Host/Interviewer: This doesn't affect him at all. He is ready mentally and physically. He's ready? That's good. Listen, we may have a surprise, you know, surprise guest now. And yeah, he would be, yeah. I would like to hear his opinion as well.
Host/Interviewer: about you guys and yeah so let's see let's see who's gonna put the belt now you have one belt daniel left arm and then right arm belt if you have that you will have the two belts is there anyone at the east versus west who has the belt right down left no nobody no no if you win you win you will be you will have two bills wow can i maybe ask a question to daniel uh yeah
Daniel Procopciuc: Does he think that he is pound for pound the best in the world? He thinks there are many people contesting for this spot. Maybe even Mindaugas is there. He doesn't know who is number one. Look, okay.
Host/Interviewer: the right person the right person the guy knows arm wrestling very well and knows the category very very well probably better than anyone else you know how are you yeah what's that yeah i'm good yeah should i change my camera to horizontal or what yeah yeah the sideway yeah yeah you mean uh
Host/Interviewer: Is that better? Anyway, so how have you been, Yanis? I'm better. I'm better. A little healthier.
Yanis: So when are you going to come back and beat these guys? Quite soon, I believe. Good to hear. That's what we would like to hear from you. It's getting closer. It's not like I'm beating my records, but weights are better, elbow is better, pain is less. So that's at least like some positive part of all this story. Yeah, that's good. And how do you see this match, Yanis?
Yanis: uh mean dog is uh has a chance to take it has a chance to take a wrist but i don't know if he's like have have understanding or a strength to finish the game but definitely he has a chance to get in a good position but usually his attack attack vectors from from positions he gets is not the best ones
Yanis: And he need to attack much more rotator, much more pronator. And then he need to separate his biceps and take maybe a little bit position to center. And then it's possible, but still it's very hard. And I'm not saying that there are many top rollers who can do that. It's also a question of strength. Sometimes it's not only because the top roller is not good, but because the guy
Host/Interviewer: against them is very strong. Like Daniel Daniel. Yeah. I mean, it's like a wall, you know, you just, you, you just wouldn't think that, you know, this guy generates that kind of power, but whenever you feel it, you'll feel it, you know, you're like, okay, his elbow is like more like, like not this foot in style, but the elbow, the, the, the joint, like, like a touching elbow joint, you know, like you also probably, yeah.
Yanis: Yeah, but also I think Minda has improved a lot in his arm strength. In previous fights, when Minda pulled against Hristo, he didn't care much about wrist. He attacked arm almost directly. So it's making it much more fun. It's making much more fun, this fight. So yeah, I'm definitely looking forward.
Host/Interviewer: Yeah, the only thing is that Daniel is a unique case, very unique case. Daniel, another question while I find you here. Your left arm. I asked you Mazgan Shamir because he pulled in 2021, he pulled Alain Zola in the final. In 2022, he pulled you in the final. He thinks that it would be a great match.
Host/Interviewer: Someone like Alain Zollet, would you find your right arm or left arm more competitive or the same? With both arms, yeah. What's that? He said no problem.
Host/Interviewer: No problem, okay. Listen, it will be more fun when Arthur and Vala Zolaev also get in the mix because that is helpful to the elite armwrestlers we're talking about around that category. He thinks if Vala is stronger, still Mindaugas is more uncomfortable for Daniel.
Host/Interviewer: yeah yeah because because against it against it alan daniel can apply his power as he wants against mindagos we don't know where the match is gonna go yeah yeah and and i like yannis like for example you you watch the match uh emily versus alan zola where emil top rolled him and the match was like more than more than half minutes you know he top rolled him
Host/Interviewer: But he couldn't finish it, yeah. In an event in Chechnya, like... AMC, AMC event, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Previous ones. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Do you, like, looks like it is possible, you know, he top-rolled him, but couldn't finish him. Like, do you think that, like, Alain Zolaire in 75 kilos, do you see him? Like, in my opinion, no disrespect, looks like he is favorite against anyone under 75 kilos. Looks like. But...
Yanis: How do you see him? Do you see him like, you know, he would beat everyone or certain guys may have a chance against him? How do you see that? He is favorite, but armwrestling is armwrestling, you know, and there is always a good chance for other elite athletes to get some win against him. Stylistically, like Minde, I see that Minde could put Vala in a bad position. It's very possible. Vala's hand is very solid, but wrist is...
Yanis: he's kind of i would say i don't know this name like a little bit swimming time to time and his control is not always so great so it is possible i'm not sure again if minda could finish him but uh definitely could put him in a bad position i said before that uh maybe nordelet is not uh
Yanis: lightweight anymore or he's heavier, but I think Nurtillet would have a good chance with his explosiveness and speed to really give Vala some hard time.
Yanis: Absolutely. Stylistically, Daniel was right. Maybe stylistically, Vala is even a more comfortable opponent for him, not a weaker opponent. I'm not saying that Daniel would be favourite, I don't know, but definitely stylistically, he could get in his position. Yeah, but the same applies for Vala. The same applies for Vala, that Daniel would be stylistically better than the Mindaugas.
Yanis: Yeah, yeah, true. Because Vala very often, it seems like because he's so confident, we don't know, but very often he kind of allows the opponents to get in a more or less decent position. And he's like, okay, get in your best position and I will beat you from that. So, yeah. I kind of think that, like Andriy, he wrote Andriy Yavakhaletze,
Host/Interviewer: He wrote that, like, if Mindaugas would top roll Alain, his chance would be more than Emil, he says. I kind of agree. Emil kind of pulls, like, a little bit, like, arm a little bit open, you know. He doesn't, like, not joint, like Mindaugas. We can say that, oh, Mindaugas also loses Daniel with the dead wrist, but Daniel is using joint while Alain was just, like, more like dragging with the bicep. I think it would be more comfortable for
Host/Interviewer: and he would have more room you know because daniel doesn't leave you in a room he comes forward either you pull your elbow will get out i think that with with um alan it would be like i would prefer to pull alan then pulling against daniel personally you know yeah yeah
Yanis: Yeah, it doesn't mean that I can beat this, I can lose the other one or something, but it's more like muscle you are armwrestling against. The main thing is we should see that. We should see that and we should make it happen, those fights. That's why armwrestling is interesting. We can talk about some chances and possibilities, but those are potentially great fights.
Yanis: I have told before that I think nowadays in East-West and King of Table, we don't see enough of those lightweight fights because that quality, that strength, that level behind them are crazy high. And many, many, and also those two guys we are sitting and talking about today, Mindaugas and Daniel, I believe they could both win many of guys from heavier classes in East-West, in King of Table.
Host/Interviewer: And that's only showing the level. I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think,
Host/Interviewer: very low weight, and then you won. Both of them, yeah. Yeah.
Yanis: Also, Daniel, who is theoretically like 75 kilo class arm wrestler, when he pulled against Samushia, who is right now winning six fights in a row and then has defended his title. I think first round, Daniel won first round. But I think Daniel was also 81 kilo or something. You were right. But still, as a current champion, he was able to win the first round. That's only showing that level.
Daniel Procopciuc: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, this match took place after the Worlds. He didn't have time to gain weight and his shoulder also hurt a bit. So he was 79. He wasn't recovered fully. Oh, OK. Yeah. I mean, both were like also Samushia had like illness, like
Host/Interviewer: stomach problem you remember or no um but yeah they they both were like one was like didn't recover from the valve the other one had the stomach issues couldn't eat for like one one day or two days or something you know they both weren't in great shape but uh daniel daniel pull very good daniel very good yeah
Yanis: I'm always, when I came to training with my mates, with Coach Rey and Antonovic, we start with a complaint who has a worse illness and worse injuries and then who hadn't slept for three days. So it's always the same story. Okay, so before we start talking about the predictions of the other matches,
Host/Interviewer: Anything you want to add to your match against Dania? You said you are not going to talk trash. It's good that life brought you to this point. You were just saying all kinds of trash talk. And finally you said, I'm not going to talk anymore. I'm going to just do it. It's good. It's good. I'm just happy about this kind of fight. I feel like both me and Daniel, we had a long road up until this point.
Mindaugas Tarasaitis: And I am proud both in me and maybe also in Daniel. I feel like we both achieved it in a very good way, very healthy way. You can see that we are both armwrestlers, not bodybuilders. So I feel like it's a beautiful armwrestling fighting. And I'll really try my best. I feel like I have a smart plan and I'll try to win this fight. If I manage to win, I feel like it would be...
Mindaugas Tarasaitis: i feel like it will be great because daniel in my mind is really one of the best maybe pound for pound the best guy in the world so if i could at least take a little bit of that kind of achievement i would be very proud i mean you are also very successful and again you know like the winner of this match possibly alan zolev and most likely arthur macaro the next and so we will we will see we will see how it will be but
Daniel Procopciuc: Anyway, so, and Dania, we will start the predictions. And before that, you want to say anything to Mindaugas about your match? If I had a match in a month with Mindaugas, I could tell you what the prediction would be and what percentage I would win. But from the last match, about a year and a few days have passed. In a year and a few days, I can change radically. I can increase the strength of both athletes.
Daniel Procopciuc: If the match took place a month ago, maybe he could give us some percentage. But from the last time they pulled, it's been a long time. So both of them have progressed. He doesn't know. Yeah. So he thinks 50-50. 50-50. Yeah. Okay. Okay.
Host/Interviewer: Let's see. Let's see how it will be. Let's see who's going to win. And let's start. These three are very knowledgeable guys that like I can, I'm not going to probably ask, do you know this guy? Because many of the times whenever I ask the guys, like they say like, you know, I don't know this guy. I don't know this guy. Like even yesterday when I asked Rino about Morozov versus Kurdecha, he asked me, oh, which arm was it, you know? And so...
Host/Interviewer: i hope i won't have the this this problem with you guys and then we can just have a very nice okay i'm starting with an incredible one incredible because if you guys were heavyweight i wouldn't say this because probably you wouldn't understand but it is like lightweights either versus wallah who is gonna start you started did i start okay so um
Mindaugas Tarasaitis: Yeah, this is an interesting one. Vala was very impressive lately. So I would maybe even go with Vala this time. I feel like he has the power and the style is good. I feel like I like Vala here. And can you just even explain, like I will explain my way. I kind of think that Vala is probably a little bit stronger.
Host/Interviewer: but either honey is more explosive so whenever you are slow to reach your max like somebody may catch you at your 85 90 and then put you out of position and then you may lose the match you know and do you think that like wada being stronger either being faster do you think this is the case or you disagree
Mindaugas Tarasaitis: No, I agree. That's the case. But also, I feel like Vala is going in the direction, you know, a bit backwards, which maybe he doesn't have to care about Nord-Oleg's speed as much. Because maybe if Nord-Oleg will be too quick, he will maybe open up himself. So, I don't know. I feel like Vala can catch it well. So, you think Vala is slightly favorite? Yeah. Okay. And you, Daniel?
Daniel Procopciuc: He thinks Norda Oleg has very high chances because of his explosivity. And Ianes? They both are super explosive and super fast. It's a question of who will get in a better position from the start.
Yanis: I believe they haven't met before, so it's hard to predict. Also, when we were talking that Wallah is maybe a little bit stronger, it could be true, but also we don't know what to expect when we talk about Northern England. 85-86 people, 85, yeah, that's a different guy.
Yanis: it could be quite a big difference from 75 so uh that strength level could be very close very close and uh it's it's a great fight and uh nordic is also good with those long fights and the endurance is great and and we have seen him pulling those long fights against daniel also his mindalga super much wasn't fast so
Host/Interviewer: It's very close. His match with Daniel wasn't long. I think Daniel's match wasn't long. Either Daniel catch him or he just quickly won, you know. Okay, it was a 10-0 match and still you need a good endurance for those. The endurance or the more matches, but not within the match, you know. Yeah, maybe not one match, not a super long fight.
Daniel Procopciuc: In the past, when he was lighter, when he was like 60-65kg, he had long matches.
Host/Interviewer: And later he started to be more explosive, but not long matches. I remember he, and he, and, um, I forgot like almost, and he had like one minute, two minute long matches, you know? Yeah. Anyway, so there is a quick super chat, SG records. Nice to see two greatest encyclopedias of arm wrestling in one stream, Yanis. Best of luck for Minda for his match. So do I wish Daniel the same?
Host/Interviewer: thank you and there was three four thank you I support prokopchuk he will hold Minda and smile this is Daniel Daniel if you if you would have the control you know normally in the professional matches you do that that little bit playing you know hold and you know
Daniel Procopciuc: And will you do the same to the Mindaugas if you think that you are stronger? He can't do this with Mindaugas because every centimeter lost is a big danger. That's good. That's good to hear that Mindaugas. It just shows how dangerous you are.
Mindaugas Tarasaitis: And I think you cannot do the same thing to him either. You know, I almost want Daniel to be more confident because now he may be understands the danger too much too well. Okay. Okay. Okay. That's good. That's good. That's good. I like it. And let's go to the, um, another match. I make versus Robbie toppy, Robbie. Um,
Yanis: you may not be so familiar but very strong guy especially with the left arm i think he was heavyweight he's going down to 105. um janice you do you know robbie i know both of them and uh i know i i'm really quite well and then know him for years and then he's absolutely powerhouse especially with his left arm when he gets in his position he's very dangerous i think he has won before uh
Yanis: Not sure if it was a competition fight against Krasimir inside or... No, I mean, I think they played supermatch and I think Krasimir won, but barely. Like, hardly. Yeah, yeah. Or even first round was won by Eimer. Yeah, maybe. I could be wrong, but yeah.
Yanis: I remember there was a war. Very tough match, I remember. I think Krasimir was not as usual, but he was a little bit escaping of Aymeric's hook.
Yanis: And Robby Toby, I know I met him before as well, but last time I saw him this year in Arizona and he was in final in Arizona State Championship with Sandry Shedis. So Sandry won against him with left arm, but he was in final and he's absolutely good class armwrestler and always doing good in USA. But I think...
Yanis: Like, if I have to predict, I kind of see that Aymeric is a little bit favorite in this one. But we haven't seen much from Aymeric lately as well, so we don't know about shape. And Daniel and Mindaugas, you guys have any opinion about this match? I would guess Aymeric. Aymeric will win? Yeah, yeah. Okay.
Daniel Procopciuc: This one is also very very tough to predict. Let's start with Daniel. Marcio Barboza and Oleg Petrenko. Daniel said
Daniel Procopciuc: He pulled with Oleg. He knows his strength. And if Oleg is going to be at good form, he doesn't think Marcio will take his risk and he will lose. Okay, so you think that Petrenko is stronger, Garcia? Yeah. And Mindaugas? Yeah, this one is difficult, really difficult. Somehow depends a lot on what kind of shape they bring in. I can see Marcio winning. I can see Petrenko winning. It's different, yeah.
Mindaugas Tarasaitis: 50 50 to me because they are both still strong inside quite okay outside so it's hard hard to predict him you know and these guys they are so muscular um it really matters you know how how much how already our way you know maybe sometimes endurance huh maybe get them pumped or something yeah and you Yanis
Yanis: Oh, Marcio is in sport for 30 or what years and he has won almost against anyone in this world.
Yanis: has done so much and of course he's not getting younger but we have seen how good could be john and ron bass and then todd hutchings at at uh at the age so uh he's absolutely capable of beating beating uh also also oleg but uh we haven't seen much from from uh marcio barbosa lately so i don't know
Yanis: don't know if marcio can can be in a shape of his life or or or as as good as he has ever been he definitely have a very good chance and i would say even he could be favorite but uh because marcy marcio is great armistler and uh i have seen him uh doing doing big oleg
Yanis: Oleg is interesting. Armistler, he's not most technical, but he's super strong. He's super strong. And also this technical advantage I see on Marcio's side.
Yanis: He could maybe even be more advanced in some technical aspect. But Oleg is super strong and can pull in any position. Topie roll, side press, hook, some flat, anything. He can do anything on table. And if fight goes longer, also it could be a question about Oleg's endurance, in my understanding, in a longer fight. Yeah.
Host/Interviewer: So, next one. Artem Taynov vs. Zurab Tavberidze. Daniel, left arm, 95kg world title. Artem Taynov beats Sasho and now he's gonna pull Zurab. Zurab broke his arm. After he broke his arm, the only thing he does is the left arm. And how do you see this match?
Daniel Procopciuc: The match between Taynov and Sasho surprised Daniel. He thought Sasho would win. He doesn't know Zurab's shape.
Daniel Procopciuc: But he thinks that his injury affected him mentally. He doesn't think he will be... His table positioning won't be that good. He will have some... Yeah.
Host/Interviewer: Maybe yes, maybe not. Maybe he will be even more hungry now. His right arm is hurt. He just wants something because he wanted this match so much. He just pushed, pushed, pushed, pushed and he got it, you know. And let's see. And you, Mindaugas? I think that even if Zurab manages to hook Taynov in round one or two, I feel like he will be top rolled in the later rounds and he will not finish the match. So I feel like Taynov will take it.
Host/Interviewer: Just because Zurab will lose his rest. Interesting thing. If I'm not mistaken, Ali Can and Prudnik was here. They were here. And I asked them. And I think they both said that Zurab is going to win. I think. Yeah. And I was surprised. I think those were the guests. And you, Yanis?
Yanis: About injury, yeah, always when I injure my right arm, my left is kind of improving a little. So maybe you're right about Zurab's left arm. But shape, what Artyom is showing lately in a fight against Sasho right now in AMC in Moscow in an event. And he's looking great. He's looking very dominant and explosive fast and pulling any position.
Yanis: So it will be a very hard task for Zurab in my eyes. And Taynov is capable with his explosiveness and also technicality to put Zurab in a really bad position. And the question is, can Zurab get back from that? But yeah, right now, when his right arm is injured, maybe he has progressed with his left so much that he could be so good. We don't know.
Yanis: We don't know. And also one more thing from Taino. He is in great shape, but you can't be in a great shape all the time. And he was in a very good shape in a previous East-West. He was in great shape right now, just this week in Moscow. So how long he can remain in that shape? Exactly. And at some point,
Daniel Procopciuc: It goes up and down and Christian can keep that. Yeah. And Matt Mask versus Wagner Bortolato. Right arm, Daniel. Matt Mask. Matt Mask. Matt Mask will win? Right arm? Yeah. Left arm Bortolato wins, but right, Matt Mask.
Host/Interviewer: Can you ask Daniel if you would help us as a security during that match to protect the table? Both of these guys are a little bit unpredictable to me.
Mindaugas Tarasaitis: I would, if I had to guess, I would maybe even guess Bortolato, just because Matt Mask didn't really impress me last time when he faced, who was it, the Italian guy? Lamparelli. Lamparelli. So, I don't know, maybe I would even guess Bortolato. But it's hard for me to judge this one. And you, Giannis?
Yanis: I would say Matt Mask. I hope to see him in good shape. We always kind of think that in any fight he has before in his 20s that he could really be even a favorite or a good chance. And he's not pulling as good as we expect usually, but he's a great arm wrestler. And with right arm, I see him as a favorite against Wagner. However, I love Wagner and I...
Yanis: I hope to see some good fight and hope that he could get in his position. So that would be good for event and for a show. But I think that the mask is a favorite in this one. Yeah. Okay. Another one. Irakli Zirakashvili, Pauline. Daniel.
Daniel Procopciuc: So, after his last sparring with Paul, at After Pulse, at his... He was strong, right? He was strong, right? I felt him really, really strong. Yes, yes, yes. He thinks he has a very good chance against Heraklion. Yeah.
Host/Interviewer: He pulled a super match with John. He tried to top roll John. He lost badly. And then after the round, he hooked John. I asked John, John, did you go hook or he hook you? He said, no, I didn't go hook. He hooked me because of his wrist, very explosive. And not only that match, Daniel, just remember the Sasho match. Sasho is very good to start. Sasho was right here in every match because his wrist and
Mindaugas Tarasaitis: Dragging, you know, very strong guy, yeah. And whenever you look at from outside, he's nice guy, smiling. You think that he's, I mean, you don't find him dangerous, but inside he's very strong. And you, Mindaugas, how do you see this match? Yeah, so Poland has a pretty good drag, I would say. But if you look at it technically, like his hook should be, he should be in a bit of a disadvantage against the top roller. Like if Poland was attempting to hook,
Mindaugas Tarasaitis: And he cannot really top roll as well as Irakli. So maybe technically I can see Irakli being in a good position. Except if Polin manages to drag him and extend him quickly. Do you think Polin is just getting over his pronator? Or you think that Irakli will do the same as he did to Rushtan? I think Irakli would get out. I don't think Polin can hook Irakli.
Daniel Procopciuc: That's why I feel like it's a problem for Paul Linn. So you believe Irakli is going to win? Yeah. And Daniel, you said that Paul is so strong, but we didn't hear your opinion. Who is going to win? I don't think Paul Linn wants to hook him. He doesn't think Paul Linn will want to hook Irakli. He thinks he will hit sideways with his wrist straight. Straight? Yeah. Okay.
Mindaugas Tarasaitis: So more like a drag, I guess, more like, or kind of sideways. Yeah. It is more dangerous for the wrist, but, and you, Yanis?
Yanis: yeah every every time i see paul pulling i'm more and more impressed and i have to see that say that he he is one of top guys in a category for sure and uh he's really i think big danger for iraqi as well with his arm strength and cyprus strength and the fight level he showed against uh rustam before against sasho and and many others he's super dangerous and uh my my opinion and and uh
Yanis: like what what i what i have said before about pauline that he still is new in a sport and beginner and not so technical and so on right now is absolutely wrong he's showing us that he's a high quality armistler super super strong and really dangerous and uh for me question is in how good position pauline uh will get with with iraqli because uh
Yanis: If it will be somewhere in the centre, that they both will stop, as in that side press, that side press, what Pauline can produce, could be even too much for Irakli. But the question is, can he get in that more or less good position with his hand, with his wrist, not absolutely lost. But he's very dangerous, for sure. So, OK. And let's go, Oleg Zog versus Stutberg-Zeh, Danija.
Daniel Procopciuc: You know Tutberidze, right? The 85-kilo quarterback. Yes. He knows Tutberidze, the world champion at 85. He is very strong, but with Oleg, it's a very hard fight. He thinks Oleg. Dania, would you want to pull Oleg?
Daniel Procopciuc: You don't want a left arm? No? If Oleg Zoc wins, if I don't win the rest of the match, you vs. Oleg, do you believe you can beat Oleg? I don't know.
Daniel Procopciuc: if there would be someone for daniel to prepare to reach 85 kilo that would be olizo what's that uh if there would be one person to motivate daniel to oh to play 85 kilo okay so you are ready
Daniel Procopciuc: When he will reach 85 kilos, he will be ready. Now at 75, not ready. Yeah, but just say that Daniel is 82 kilos. Would you pull Oleg? Probably, yes. Okay, okay. I'm planting seeds, you know. And you, Mindaugas, Sudberize?
Mindaugas Tarasaitis: Yeah, I think two birds is normally top rolling and it's really difficult to do against Oleg, so... But is Oleg the same Oleg, Mindaugas, the same Oleg? I'm talking about the Oleg who we already know in the past year. I mean, you know, you see like back, you see back to his, you know, top shape. Maybe not fully back, but still clearly at the very top level, so...
Host/Interviewer: Do you guys remember how Plemens stopped him in 2018, Vaf? Just a little bit stopped. About 20 seconds, 15-20 seconds. He couldn't go. Yeah. But Kazakhstan guy, what was the name of Kazakhstan guy who gave really a word to Oleg this year, Vaf? Nick, what was his surname? Oh, yeah. But his point is the same. We were talking about him.
Mindaugas Tarasaitis: uh before you came but his plan is more like more like uh daniel's yeah yeah yeah yeah but this guy is a top roller you know yeah i know i know i know yeah and so you are saying oleg is gonna win mean nervous well got that i also did it very well but uh so if if the georgian guy would be you would have a style more similar to talgat maybe i would say the georgian but uh since the georgian guy is now trying to top roll
Mindaugas Tarasaitis: I don't think it will work against Oleg. David you see his match with Talget Aktaev? Yep. The Georgian guy. Maybe, but I don't remember now. He beat Talget. Anyways, and you, Yanis?
Yanis: I have to agree kind of with Min, that Jorgen Tutberidze, he's a very good armwrestler and you can't win a Waffbold 85kg class if you are a bad armwrestler, he's great. But stylistically, I also remember that this year's European Championship, Tuoms Rosic, my student, top rolled Jorgen Tutberidze.
Yanis: You talk that he won in Evop, but he won against Talgat, he won against Mezhgan Shamil, but those both are inside armwrestlers who are trying to get inside with him, and he's doing great against someone who's trying to get inside, but not sure if he can really do something against Oleg's hand.
Yanis: We can never know, especially Georgians are saying that in Europe he was not in good shape and in above he was in much better shape. The problem is that the Georgian guy, are you talking about Stuttgart? Yeah.
Host/Interviewer: I mean, after he won the juniors, he went and then he pulled with everyone, side table, everyone. Like he pulled many guys and then he competed the seniors. I mean, I don't know why he did that. In Europe ends. Yeah, Europe ends. He pulled with Rino and many other guys, side table. Anyway, so let's go to do this one. I only want the winner's name. I don't want any prediction.
Mindaugas Tarasaitis: daniel prokopchuk versus mindagos tarasaitis who's winning daniel and mindagos friendship just one name
Yanis: just just one name just one name yeah let's see yeah indiana is just gonna be like politically you know just like you know like uh i see there are slight advantage for daniel yeah
Yanis: it is what we say today jan is mostly based on what we saw exactly exactly i'm talking about what we have seen before and about and that's only what what we can uh have our predictions is what he we have seen before but we can never know what will happen after after a few weeks and uh what shape our guys know true i have seen another beat daniel too but last night yeah yeah okay this one is good i'm very interested this one
Daniel Procopciuc: I don't know what you guys think, but Vladimir Maiorov vs Samushia. I think Vladimir Maiorov is a very strong guy. What do you guys think? Daniel, do you know Vladimir Maiorov? Yes, Maiorov, if he remained in that form, if he trained continuously, as he was in 2017-2018, he was good. But now I don't think he could be called Samushia.
Daniel Procopciuc: If Maiorov would still train from 2017 or 2018, he would be really strong. But right now, he doesn't think he can be so strong. This big break was bad for Maiorov. Yeah, I know, I know. But sometimes when people rest good,
Host/Interviewer: everything is healed up because he competed the swiss open right in the beginning of the november and almost two and a half months a little bit more than two and a half months from swiss open and people told me that at the swiss open he was very strong did he did he pull uh sundries or nuts
Yanis: You have to ask Sandris. I asked him and he was like, I don't know, I don't know who I won, who I lost. He didn't want to talk too much because he lost to someone. So maybe it was Maiorov. Because Rino yesterday told me that Maiorov and Kalnyshenko, they agreed in a competition for a slow start.
Yanis: Kalinyshenko took his wrist, but he couldn't pin him so easily. It's what Rino said. He was resisting like this and he was impressed. Tuomas pulled, Kaspars Gravis pulled, Kristaps Bluman, they all pulled against Maiorov and they all said that Maiorov is super strong and they couldn't do much against him.
Yanis: So and they are all quite, quite high quality army flares. And they all agree that Maiorov is really, really super strong. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And Maiorov has very good endurance as well. And we will see, like, I remember he and Ali Can Muratov pool.
Host/Interviewer: at the 2018 WAF. Yeah, he top-rolled him, but long match, like maybe two minutes, like a few starts, and finally he beat Ali Can. And he lost his wrist, you know. So, I don't know. So, Daniel, you are saying that Samushia is going to win? Yeah. Yeah. And you, Mindaugas, do you know Maiorov?
Mindaugas Tarasaitis: Yeah, yeah, of course I know him, yeah. I was at that Zloty Tur when he killed everyone. So... He killed everyone at the Moldova event. At the Zloty Tur, he took third place after Samushia and the... What's that Polish guy? David Bartusewicz. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But David meets Vladimir after the war with Alizhan, you know, yeah. And even then you can see that the guy is really solid. So...
Mindaugas Tarasaitis: But also, like, normally we don't really see anyone just coming back, fighting against the champion who defended his title for six times in a row and winning. It doesn't really happen. So I feel like it's a little bit unlikely that Maiorov was able to already catch up and reach that kind of level. So I would also think that Samushia will probably defend it once again. But I'm sure Maiorov could also be pretty good now.
Host/Interviewer: I don't know. Jerry was away from 2019. He just came and beat Gennady. Pongarbe was away from 2019, the top eight, and he came and beat Bruce Lee and Michael Todd. Sometimes it happens. Sometimes if you know how to arm wrestle, if you know what you are doing, you will see. And you, Yanis, how do you see it?
Yanis: Maiorov is super dangerous for anyone who tries to toproll him. His hooking capability, same as Samushia, is great. His hands don't seem like big, but he's very well with getting in a position he wants. So it will be quite similar, like Samushia against, I think, against the previous fight for him against Abdulmano. Abdulmano is not dangerous.
Yanis: Abdulmanap doesn't have good endurance. They both will go inside and then get in this good hook position.
Yanis: and i think it will be good hook war and a question of endurance i i i'm not i'm not uh um i don't i don't know if one will be so much stronger that he can pin other quickly so uh i think it will be a little more yeah yeah i think it will be a hook war and a question of endurance so uh i hope i hope to see a good fight yeah and daniel uh matushenko versus message reno
Daniel Procopciuc: Daniel said Matusencu is a very smart puller. He thinks he analyzed Rino and he will pull in Rino's weak point. Rino also can pull in many different ways.
Mindaugas Tarasaitis: He goes sideways, shoulder pressure, hook, you know, we will see. Yesterday he seemed very confident as well, but we will see. And you, Mindaugas? Yeah, I like Matyushenko also here. He seems like the guy who is perfect at defeating these guys like Kamil Jablonski or also Rino Masic.
Mindaugas Tarasaitis: He can just shoot sideways a little bit quickly and then put them out of position. And then he is still strong to finish a match. I feel like it's just a perfect... He's perfect technically to defeat these kinds of pressers. So, yeah. But I don't think he's going to go for press. I think he's going to go inside. This is what I understood from what he said. And because press, if you go this way, you just...
Mindaugas Tarasaitis: Like, Matyushenko is very dangerous for the press. I think that Matyushenko is even dangerous for Jerry Cato, right? Yeah, yeah. And you are saying that Matyushenko is going to win, like Daniel said? Yeah, because if Rino decides to do anything else, then his best move, I don't think that he will be good enough for Matyushenko's hook either. So, I feel like Matyushenko will simply be stronger.
Yanis: Yeah, or we all will learn something new. We will see. And you, Yanis? Yeah, Rino is a young and super talented armistler and we have to understand that at his age, he probably is growing faster than anyone else and getting stronger. He's still just almost a junior armistler.
Yanis: Probably every event we see him, he's getting better and better. The question is, is he already in that level that he can beat someone like Matyushenko, who is strong, smart, experienced, technical armistler, and you really can't...
Yanis: surprise him with some some some uh much things so uh question has is he is is reno strong enough to because i don't see it any option as a hook i only see only option for for for reno to pull against matushenko is to go against him in a hook and i i don't know if he's strong enough to do that we will see we will see but he's he's he's of course his advantage is that he's so young that probably he's
Host/Interviewer: improving a lot every every every year every month that's how it should be at the age of what 19 or or what yeah 19 yeah next year it will be 20. John Burzin versus Krasimir Daniel after this one we have three more matches this is the last four matches John Burzin versus Krasimir
Host/Interviewer: whoever will would fight with john and doesn't matter how many chances he always thinks john will win because john is john yeah john john yeah even you are so young daniel you are so young before your time before mindago's time you know i have been pulling from early 90s yannis has been pulling since the late 90s correct like second half of the 90s yeah yeah and like john
Host/Interviewer: inspired all of us all of us when john in his prime he was like an alien ellie you know like like he was like
Host/Interviewer: you know and then whenever he goes stage like like he was different different like we're talking about 90 kilo 95 kilo guy beating everyone 90 95 kilo guy just imagine like artem tyno or sasho beating the super heavyweights so he was just so special now people look at him people like oh is he the god you know come on man he's talking about 60 years old man
Host/Interviewer: And imagine, imagine Daniel, you know, like how much pressure he had, like 90, 95, you know, 40 years, you're pulling against super heavyweights. Imagine how much pressure his shoulder arm, everything, you know, the guys.
Host/Interviewer: People say, oh, Tatasic is also 57 years old. Tatasic started armwrestling 20 years ago. John started from his teenage years. So the guy is not even, not 40 years, 45 years he has been pulling, you know. And I don't know, do you agree with me, Yanis? But I don't know what you are thinking about this.
Yanis: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. And we also have to remember that last time they had a supermatch, Krasimir won, if I'm correct, yes? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, so it should be a good... It was like he had a shoulder surgery, he was coming back,
Yanis: And then John also pulled Senecant one week before. He pulled against Golemanov in the final. But he doesn't take anything. Krasimir won 5-0. I organized that match. But it was not really... What I'm saying is that right now, like 10 years later, John is still capable of winning this fight. And I believe he's...
Host/Interviewer: he's maybe maybe maybe in even better shape or definitely not uh not lost much so uh yeah yeah who would you want to pull who is like better for you would you want to pull sasha or krasimir
Host/Interviewer: i would want to pull krasimir like me too yeah it's just like it is just even you like krasimir is still using some pronator you know like you understand like but even you control sasha's pronator here like this he can still hit you this way so i mean even you you do everything like this you think that you win no your arm is going still here you know he's just hitting you fully supinated
Host/Interviewer: like this yeah so but you know it's not the same case with krasimir is using more pronated once you control here it may not be as effective you know so i don't know so what i'm just saying that john lost against sasho but john went down 95 kilo now 105 kilo and
Host/Interviewer: people against Sasho and Krasimir now is beating Sasho but it is different they both go most likely inside you know or Sasho goes outside he said he's still busy with the dead risks but um how how do you see this match like technically Yanis
Yanis: think that john will do the same as he has done uh all this year and then and he will try to take uh krasimir's wrist and hand and maybe also a little bit control his pronator crossing krasimir could be in in this uh open open maybe defensive position and trying to hook hook john will will he get in a hook we will see i don't know i don't know i i i even think that the john
Yanis: could be favorite in this one john could be favorite uh and uh it could be if if question of course how john feels and how motivated he is and all the other things around but uh if if john is feeling good he could get in that position and he could take that hand yeah but last like some year ago or something i didn't see crosses so good but against in this rough when he beat ongar wave left arm and also
Host/Interviewer: When he pulled against Lachlan, I saw Krasimir very good. I think he's coming back. True, but that's again, Lachlan is a much different arm wrestler who is also strength style arm wrestler who is going arm against arm and it's much different from John. No, no, it's different. He doesn't look exhausted anymore. Krasimir, for a while, he looked exhausted, you know. But now it looks like he's coming back again, you know.
Mindaugas Tarasaitis: always hopefully i i i would love to i would love to see uh also also crossing in a great shape and uh that would be absolutely great for sure who's winning this one no stylistically somehow i don't like john not being able to hook as well as he used to be able to hook well i feel i see a small danger of him getting hooked by krasimir because of course krasimir is quite good at it
Mindaugas Tarasaitis: You know, these Bulgarians, they always shoot sideways quite well and they really secure that hook position well. So I would maybe even guess that Krasimir has a stylistic advantage. So it just all depends on the power levels and the preparation. And, you know, John is maybe not low-handing as well as he could do. So I feel like Krasimir might get him inside and then it could be a problem for John where he cannot generate enough power to defend.
Host/Interviewer: And this one is mind-blowing one, mind-blowing one. Ali Can Muratov, Evgeny Prudnik. I mean, like, after I saw Dadikyan versus Evgeny match, before that match, I would just say that Ali Can would smoke Prudnik. But now, I see a very close match, but I'm curious about your opinion. Daniel? Hmm.
Daniel Procopciuc: Prudnik wasn't in his best shape against Alizhan. If Prudnik will have a good shape, he thinks Alizhan has no chance. But if Prudnik will stay in the same form, he will be tough.
Host/Interviewer: Yeah, but I don't understand. This statement, I don't understand, Daniel. And I disagree. Of course, I respect you. But, like, do you believe that Mindaugas with left arm, left arm, proved himself more than Ali Can has proved? Like, Ali Can, I mean, to me, like, more known with, like, his left arm career. While Prudnik, yes, is great. Right arm is incredible. But left arm, like,
Daniel Procopciuc: Do you believe that he proved himself more than Aligen did?
Daniel Procopciuc: Prudnik didn't prove as much as Alizhan, but he always had his left arm strong. For him, the top rollers are a problem on his left arm, but the hookers, he is good against them. Left arm, usually also Sasho beat him, right? Correct, Yanis?
Host/Interviewer: In Moldova last time, Prudnik won against Taso. In left arm? Yeah, left and right. Yeah, I remember that, yeah.
Host/Interviewer: right i don't remember right i remember sasha lost to attachings and i don't know yeah and sasha on krasimir has a much before as well i think huh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah anyway so and so who is winning daniel uh prudnik told me that his shape is now even better than when he beat that again
Mindaugas Tarasaitis: If he is in a better shape, Prudnik wins. And you, how do you see this match, Mindaugas? Yeah, I don't even know. Both guys are quite comfortable in the hook, I guess. Maybe Alizhan's speed can somehow be a good advantage against Prudnik. If Prudnik cannot catch it well enough, I don't know. But otherwise...
Mindaugas Tarasaitis: I think I would maybe I would like to see Alizhan win somehow just because I hope that he can maybe you know just keep beating all these big names it will be somehow beautiful if he could do that he's already on a good path um but I don't know I just uh 50 50 for me I just I would like Alizhan to win but 50 50. yeah
Host/Interviewer: I think Andrea also reminded me, after Moldova there was VARF, you remember? One month later. I think there again, Sasho beat Prudnik in Antalya. It could be, yeah. 90 kilos, he won. 85 kilos, there was Zolaev, Petrenko and Ozan. And the right arm, 90 kilos was Sasho, Prudnik and left, I think it was the same.
Mindaugas Tarasaitis: So you are saying that Prudnik is going to win? I was saying Alizhan. Only because of the speed? Just because I hope that Alizhan has even more power than Prudnik expects him to have. The power level will surprise Prudnik.
Host/Interviewer: I had a student, his name is Muhammad. He pulled in 2017 in the youth category against Ali Can. They had a hook match, like all together with the stars, like qualification, more than two minutes.
Yanis: Ali Can also has good endurance as well, so I think he will be a very tough match. And Yanis, what is your expert opinion? Yeah, absolutely. That's what I'm thinking about Ali Can. In a long fight, it's very, very hard to beat Ali Can in a long fight.
Yanis: his his uh ability to pull in those uh uh not so great positions sometimes bad positions open open hand positions and in a long fight it's very hard and uh it's not like uh prudnik when he pulled against the dadikian when prudnik faced the decan for for for for evgeny if he he knows that uh if he will stop that again at least hold him for for for uh five ten seconds in some
Yanis: more or less good position that he can slowly will gas out. And that's not with Aligen. That's absolutely different. I think this endurance factor could play a big role. And Aligen is great in different positions. And he can not really like top roll, but he can
Yanis: in in in uh it's not really a king's more but really open hand proper or sometimes as well he can use and so yeah he does like this he comes back shoulder pressure yeah he does like so many things you know and do you realize that within the match
Yanis: He explodes again, you know, like he looks like yourself and then he hits you again, you know. And the thing is in a super match, in a super match, the one who can change those styles and jump from one position to another position and then use different muscle groups, different positions, usually is much more dangerous against who is pulling just in one position. So it is advantage for Alizhan if he can pull good in all those positions.
Host/Interviewer: But at the end, it will be who is the stronger one. I heard that there was a terrible elbow sound during the match. Prudnik and Dadikyan. Dadikyan also had that injury against Morozov. And then, yeah, like Babken thinks that he lost because of that injury.
Host/Interviewer: Yeah. Maybe, maybe. Could be true. Yeah. And then this one also is great. Todd Hutchings versus Dadikyan. Why don't we talk about Dadikyan? Go ahead, Dadikyan. No, you go ahead. Yeah, go ahead. Whatever. Cool. Okay, Yanis, you go.
Yanis: What I wanted to say is that we are talking about another fight now, but from previous ones, I want to see Todd Hutchings and Matyushenko right on. But yeah, if Todd Hutchings and Dedekian, I don't know.
Yanis: Who can beat Todd Hutchings in this slow hook? Maybe it will be that again. I don't know. Who says it's going to be hook? And who says it's going to be slow? Yeah. So that is one of the... What's that?
Host/Interviewer: So you think Dadikyan will try to top-roll Todd Hutchings? I mean, I don't think he's going to go inside. Listen, Dadikyan's right arm, you saw against Irakli, you know, he didn't go inside or something, you know, he just goes straight, sideways. And I was very impressed the way that he beat Irakli. I really didn't think, like, I have seen them during the training, he was beating him easy, but I don't really know much.
Yanis: care about the training, but he was very dominant, you know. Yeah, but it's much different when Irakli goes for this top roll and Dadikyan's hand is great and his biggest strength is his hand. It's very good. So it's hard to top roll him and he can block Irakli. But that's not the same what Todd will attack. Todd will attack his hand.
Host/Interviewer: Yanis Todd also attacks him. Just look at his matches. He goes with the pronation. He goes pronation. He even took Irakli's wrist when he goes sideways. He's using a lot of pronator, you know, like...
Host/Interviewer: Yeah, it's true. Without a hand, he was able to top-roll on Garbaev as well. That's true. Yeah, it's interesting. The only guy that beat him comfortably lately is Prudnik. And Prudnik had the wrist control. So maybe I'm thinking that he may block.
Host/Interviewer: touch the pronation because I don't think that you can beat Tata Shin. I don't think anyone in 105 kilos can beat Tata Shin without controlling his pronator. If Tata has the pronator here, he will beat everyone with the pressure, you know. You need to really turn him. No, but the thing is, what I'm thinking, if Dadikyan will try to go for top roll, it could be a mistake for him. Baba, listen, not really top roll, but more like protecting the pronator and back pressure and
Yanis: Because that's where he needs to attack, to attack a rotator and to get Todd on his biceps position. That's where he needs to put Todd. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So who's winning, in your opinion? If Todd will be able to stop Dadikyan, he will win.
Yanis: The only chance for Dadikyan to win is explosive. Yes, that's what I'm saying. If he will win his fights, he will win in the first like 3-5 seconds. If those fights will be more than 5 seconds, I think Todd Hutchings will win. I understand. And Dania? Todd Hutchings. Because Dadikyan has a very strong ending, but he won't get to the pro-nationals to win everything. And he won't be able to flex. He will try to pull back.
Daniel Procopciuc: He thinks Hutchings will win. Dadikyan has a really strong wrist, but his pronation won't hold on. And he will try to pull with his back, and he will lose. Can you repeat one more time? Sorry about it. So, Daniel thinks Todd will win.
Host/Interviewer: He said that he can have a really strong wrist, but his pronation will not hold on against Todd. And he will try to pull with his back, that he can, and he will lose. Yeah, but Todd's wrist is not like that super dominant. Todd doesn't even attack this way so much. He more like attack like this. Why would that he can lose the pronator when...
Daniel Procopciuc: Todd is not even attacking there. Evgeny if he attacks, he is not known with the greatest risk. Of course, he has very strong risk, but why would Dadikyan lose the pronation? His static pronation isn't strong enough to hold Todd. You'll open him like this.
Host/Interviewer: Oh, okay. He's not going to turn, but he will go more like arm. Oh, okay. With the pressure. Okay. Okay. Yeah. And you, Mindaugas? Yeah, I agree with Daniel. I think it's going to be Todd. It might be a little bit difficult to stop it initially, but I think round one, round two, the match will stop and then it's going to be Todd. Okay. And the last match, Morozov versus Kurdecha.
Daniel Procopciuc: daniel i think eating what or i think morozov in fact if it didn't yeah yeah okay we see you yeah he thinks morozov because he's young and he's progressing and and how how is he gonna beat him in hook
Mindaugas Tarasaitis: Yeah, he thinks he will turn Alex in hook. Okay, and Mindaugas? Yeah, I can see that happening. Morozov has a long arm, so it is quite likely that he will be smart enough and maybe have a good grip. Normally, Morozov, I feel like on the table, he's always quite smart and he always manages to get a good setup, good grip. So, most likely he'll do it again.
Mindaugas Tarasaitis: And also Alex was away for quite a while. Is he really still as good as we think he is? So I think Morozov, I don't think he wants to, I don't think Morozov wants to lose twice in a row. So he will be... Yeah, one on right arm, this one left arm for world title, yeah. Yeah. And Yanis?
Yanis: i haven't seen kurdecha for for for a long time and uh but his left arm before as as he said was even better than his right arm and uh he is he's very dangerous and uh like uh if if uh morozo will try to top roll alex kurdecha it could could be very problematic as well so uh it will be fight for it fight for a hand but uh morozo is uh
Yanis: lately pulling so much super matches that he's prepared for for anything in a super much format and his experience is growing a lot and uh and uh some some technical tactical aspects i believe are
Yanis: better on Morozov's side but that size and the strength for Kurdecha what he could bring on table is really impressive and I hope to see them both in a good shape and that could be a good match okay because also of course I hope that Morozov is back healthy and strong again as he was before
Yanis: Like not the last time we saw him against Georgi Cvetko when he was struggling with his health issues. Yeah. Is that the main event of the card? The main event will be Pat Hashings versus David Daligian. And why not Mindaugas and Daniel? Minda, right?
Host/Interviewer: we don't want we don't want them people like we don't want them to steal the show they will anyway they will anyway do that yeah yeah yeah yeah there will be a time that you know um I think arm wrestling community uh will same as like UFC community will realize that you know it is not all about the size but the the the
Host/Interviewer: quality like how they like hubby versus mcgregor and it was like biggest match you know and mayweather is like about 70 kilo guy is the guy making the most money yeah yeah yeah it's true ufc i know that but the reality is different janice yeah unfortunately
Yanis: The reality is that many of those so-called lightweight guys could have a great fight against even top five, top ten ranked heavyweight guys or super heavyweight guys. That's the reality. And many of them have proved that before in some overall classes as well. Yanis, there is another problem. I've been trying to tell them and I'm going to close it.
Host/Interviewer: Unfortunately, most Odo arm wrestlers, they don't promote themselves. Forget about promoting the event. They don't even promote themselves. Mindaugas is trying to do something, but unfortunately, they don't promote. People cares about arm wrestling, yes, but they also care about the personality, his goals, his daily life. What does this guy do? What does he think?
Host/Interviewer: this is the reality of today i'm a pure arm wrestling guy you know but the reality is different unfortunately so they need to every every professional arm master who wants to be professional at least needs to build their own fan base
Yanis: But see, Mindaugas, now he has stopped his trash talk like no one cares about him anymore. Yeah, yeah. Start to work, start to work. Listen, he mastered that. Sometimes you just have to take it seriously. I feel like... Sorry, sorry, Mindaugas, I didn't hear you.
Mindaugas Tarasaitis: i feel like at this moment i feel like i can get a bit more recognition by simply beating daniel so no kind of trash talk will help me here i will not convince people that i will be the favorite so i just need to be daniel now um and that will that will be maybe the best for my recognition yeah
Host/Interviewer: yeah i mean you are already great trust me you are you are one of the best couples i have ever seen you know for sure the same with yanis as well you know anyways guys thank you very very much and see you in three weeks mindagas and yanis hope to see you here just get in shape your matches you know ready just don't injure yourself thank you again just one question
Host/Interviewer: many people are asking me how can they get into the venue should they uh contact you about it should yeah they what they all need to do is just come to the the venue and then just buy the tickets that's right here we go yep take care guys and thanks to everyone who watch us
