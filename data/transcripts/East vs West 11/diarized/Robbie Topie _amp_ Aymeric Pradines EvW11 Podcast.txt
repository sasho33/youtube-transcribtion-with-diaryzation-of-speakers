Robbie Topie: By law.
Robbie Topie: Hello, Robbie? You hear me? .
Engin Terzi: Hey, what's up David? Hello Dan. Hello guys. Hello Andrew.
Engin Terzi: How are you doing? Hello, hello, Robbie. Is your connection fine? Looks like a little bit freezing or no, you're fine now. Yeah. Is it possible that you make the phone sideway here?

Engin Terzi: Let's see, they still have nine minutes. I saw you early came, so I just wanted to come early. Yeah, trying to figure out how to operate this stupid thing. Yeah, so are you going to ask Aymeric about winner takes all thing, you know, tonight? You're freezing.
Engin Terzi: I'm freezing? Yeah. I don't know, maybe, I don't know, maybe it's me. Do you guys see, ... Robbie? Smooth? Connection or, guys? Hello Turipur, hello David, hello Teng Bora.
Engin Terzi: Engines works fine. Robbie, not so much, they say. Hello, Benji. Okay, give me one minute. Let me see if I can find a Wi-Fi. I mean, right now is okay. Like right now you're moving, your sound, everything is okay. But sometimes you're freezing, you know. But I don't know why. Right now is okay. I can try to hook it to Wi-Fi right now. I'm just using my cellular connection. Yeah, right now is fine. Okay. Yeah.
Robbie Topie: So what's your weight? Uh, right now I probably two 45 to 44. Oh, okay. Yeah. Okay. So I'm about what? Five. You are your, your shape is your shape is good. Very good. Yeah. I think I'm five. We agreed to a two 35, right? Um,
Robbie Topie: Artem we doing a catch weight at 235, or do I need to be at the 105? Yeah, 105. Yeah, 105. Either way, I'll be good. Yeah, I'm checking, you know. Oh, let me see that.
Engin Terzi: Let me, uh, let me try to hook this thing to the wifi and see if it makes it better. I don't know right now is very smooth. You know, there is no problem right now, but okay. Okay. Yeah. I mean, any problem, any problem I will tell you. Okay. Yeah. So, uh, Robbie people from the east, they don't know you much. They don't know much about you. What's that? That's good for me. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: And can you a little bit introduce yourself to us? Like, which wins you are proud of, you know, till today? Like, for example, how old are you? 45. 45. For how many years have you been pulling? 26. Wow. And what are your biggest wins? So that, like, people from the East, they would know
Robbie Topie: more about you i know you but i'm just saying for the fans that from the east uh i've been national champion uh multiple times uh multiple almost every single state champion um competed competed in the wal and made the final you are from utah you are from utah no i'm from idaho idaho idaho yeah yeah idaho yeah
Engin Terzi: So you have been playing for 26 years. Were you there at the main event? What's that? Main event. 97, 98, there was a main event in Idaho. Pocatello, Idaho. No, no, I was not. At that time, I was living in California. Oh, California. Okay, yeah, yeah, okay. I understand. And, like, who are the biggest wins, like I'm talking about, against the Armresters? Let's see, I beat Ryan Espy.
Robbie Topie: I'm sure most people have looked up and seen my super match with Cody Merritt. I lost the match, but he was number one at the time. David you have one single pin on him or no? No. I beat him. It's the match that he broke down, right? Yes. I don't know. I beat almost everybody in Aymeric.
Engin Terzi: at one point or another yeah yeah can you remind us those names you know some top names so like Ryan S pay you said yeah Ryan SB CLB Cody in the past yeah you also have wins against Cody yes in the past yes not not not whenever he got to uh that number one level okay but still you know yeah
Engin Terzi: No, I don't even know. I try to think about the names. Have you pulled someone like Ron Bass? Oh, I've beat Ron Bass numerous times. This is why I try to remember. Yeah, yeah. I try to remind you. Ron Bass, Michael Todd, Ron Bass. But you usually pull in a super airweight, right? Yeah, I
Robbie Topie: So as I'm getting older, my joints are getting beat up. My shoulders are bad. So I decided it's time for me to lose some weight and come back down to a normal size, I guess, instead of trying to maintain that super heavy weight. 275 is just getting harder and harder as I get older to maintain that size. And you won 253s at the East Versus West qualification or supers? No, I won the 205.
Engin Terzi: You want one of five? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, okay. Hello. Hey, Marek. Hello, Engin. How are you? Good? Just want to introduce each other. Robbie, Marek. Yeah. Nice to meet you. But we start to check each other on Instagram already. Yes. Yeah. And not much left. Less than three weeks. And then you two will be at the table.
Aymeric Pradines: And Aymeric, how was your preparation? Yeah, it's good. It's good. Not the best I wanted, but the maximum I can because of my job and my other activities. I feel good.
Aymeric Pradines: a bit you know but it's normal when you start to preparing if it's a bit pain somewhere but it's uh it's just little i i think with a bit rest before the competition it would be everything would be okay i understand and many older people that um who are on the east versus west 11 cars
Engin Terzi: From the East, they are familiar with you, but they don't know much about Robbie because he's from West. And they think that you are favorites. Do you agree with that? I think yes. So you think you are favorites in this match?
Aymeric Pradines: you are comfortable about but did you analyze robbie yeah i analyzed yeah but i uh i know robbie before the east versus west because i am i'm a fan of arm wrestling and i follow all the big competition uh around the world so i saw already robbie did great in usa
Aymeric Pradines: and why I think I'm favorite. Robbie is really strong, really solid arm wrestler. But I think his style of pulling is good for me. And as you know, the style, it's important in arm wrestling match. Yeah. And Robbie, whenever I said this match, right after that, you said, tell Aymeric, winner takes all. Do you still offer the same thing?
Robbie Topie: 100%. Yeah, I accept. It's okay for me. You accept? You want to accept? Of course. I will win. 100%. Thanks, Robbie. Robbie, why is he thanking you? What's that? Why is he thanking you for this? I'm assuming that he's thanking me for the opportunity. I think he's a little overconfident and thinks that he's going to beat me.
Robbie Topie: But that's going to be to my advantage that he doesn't really know who I am. He has no idea what my strengths are, and he's never held my hand. So he'll be up for a rude awakening whenever he holds my hand the first time. And then he will realize? That he made a mistake. Ah, okay. Okay, by accepting your offer. Okay, I understand. Yep. I will buy him a beer afterwards, though.
Engin Terzi: That's good. That's good. Like most of the most of the East versus West veteran pullers, you know, pull over here a lot. They are more careful about what they say.
Engin Terzi: You know, they are like, okay, I don't want to talk so much. It's like 50-50. But like you two are like so confident and you both are saying you're going to beat the opponent. And that's interesting. I remember after Zurab beat Rambeth, he was going to pull John, his next match. And he was like, you know, like I want to go super heavyweight. The only guy I cannot beat, Levan, you know, but the rest I can beat.
Engin Terzi: But whenever people realize this, you know, no disrespect to Zurab, but this stage is really top stage. So next time they are a little bit more careful about what they say. As you both accept the fact that, you know, you cannot win, like both of you cannot win, one of you will be disappointed. So that will be an experience, you know, but let's see who will personally be, you know. And you, Robbie, do you know,
Engin Terzi: Aymeric, have you studied him? Oh, yes. I've been watching his videos every day. Okay. And what do you think? He said that your style is good for him. And, like, what's your opinion about that? I think we both pull in a very similar style. And so, in my opinion, it's going to be who the stronger man is is going to win. I watched...
Robbie Topie: The way he pulls, I know the way I pull, and I believe that it's going to be very similar. So whoever brings the best form to the match, most likely going to come out on top. Do you expect this to go inside? No, I'm an outside puller, I'm a top roller. Yeah, sometimes when both outside pullers are
Engin Terzi: like they both have very strong wrists you know when they cannot manage you know toppling each other and so what makes you think that you're gonna beat Aymeric i will ask the same question to Aymeric but he basically said that your style is good for him and in what is your base like it's like because you feel yourself stronger than him more experienced
Robbie Topie: So my training right now is going very well. I set parameters for myself that I try to achieve as I go along. And for my end result and my peak performance, everything is on pace. I'm hitting all of my parameters that I've set for myself. I'm going to show up as strong as I can possibly be and the best prepared that I can be, which is why I feel like I will be able to come out victorious on this match.
Robbie Topie: But, you know, I don't ever, ever think that I'm going to lose. If I went into anything thinking I was going to lose, it would be a waste of my time. So if I have to, if I don't have the confidence, like I'm assuming that Eric is confident in his abilities because it would be silly for him to accept this match and think that I'm going to kick his butt. Yeah. And who are you training right now? Like, are you training with the, like,
Engin Terzi: Cody and other guys or they are because they are in other states? I have a team that comes to my house every week. So I have between between 10 and 18 guys that show up to practice every week. Okay. And then they say that your shape is good? Yes. Yes. Okay. Yeah. And I'm Eric. What makes you think you're gonna win because because of only his style?
Aymeric Pradines: Yeah, I have a bit the same analysis than Roby. In some way, we pull in the same way. But I think I'm more versatile than him. It's mostly outside puller, but I can pull also inside and I'm good also inside.
Aymeric Pradines: Of course, I think I'm favorite, but I'm very careful because I know, I saw his match and he's very powerful. Maybe more than me in some axis, but I'm pretty confident to find a way. I'm faster and I'm confident of my capability to win this fight. Thank you.
Engin Terzi: And Robbie, if you win this match, like, do you have some higher goals somehow just to become like even very, very best one in the world? Yes. Yeah. Yeah. So you'll have the size that you, you are not coming here, you know, just, just to be beat, beat, uh, just to beat Aymeric. If you win this match, you want to even continue until you are the best in 105 kilo.
Robbie Topie: That is my plan. 100% is to, um, use, use a Merrick as a stepping stone, uh, to prove to, to, uh, East versus West that, that I am a, um, forced to be reckoned with. And, uh, hopefully, um, you as the promoter will be impressed with my performance and offer me another match and, uh, continue on up the ladder.
Engin Terzi: I mean anyone who wins this match you know just for sure some point will be invited you know maybe not the next one but for sure we'll be invited again you know and Aymeric do you also have such plans or someone who is more familiar with the eastern level of armwrestling you are more careful about your goals?
Aymeric Pradines: Yeah, my goal is to stay in East versus West. And I know because I am already training with Evgeny and some people like this, very high level, I'm the best in the world. And I know I'm not so far. I just need to have more preparation to be more involved in my training. And I think with time, not now. Evgeny, of course, is stronger than me.
Aymeric Pradines: But in, in some, in some part of my training, I can, uh, I feel I can put him a bit in trouble. So I need, uh, really, uh, more focus on my training and more time. And, uh, as Robbie say, it's, uh, also for me, it's a step to, uh, uh, to me, uh, to, uh, for the future to, to put more energy in my training and maybe, yeah, start to, to.
Engin Terzi: work less on the side and put more focus on my on my training again yeah trust me as a promoter first of all ahmed salam alaikum how are you and you
Engin Terzi: fine fine hello to everyone hello Robbie hello um um Ahmed is the friend of Aymeric uh maybe some points he said that he may need him as a translator but I think Aymeric is doing very well you know he's expressing himself yeah like as a promoter I love that you know as a promoter I mean
Engin Terzi: Of course, there are like very, very elite athletes. But whenever I see the passion is missing, it doesn't excite me. I don't care who the person is. If the person doesn't have goal, you know, higher than where he is, to me, it's kind of becoming boring. But whenever like you and Robbie together, you know, when you say that you have higher goals and this is a step, you know,
Engin Terzi: one more step to your higher goals you know it just excites me so much you know to hear such thing you know i love that just as long as you have that passion i will have eyes on you just both of you so let's see how it will be and i i already started to think what to set you guys the winner after this match you know so that's good i'm happy about it yeah um
Engin Terzi: Aymeric, you took second place last year at the Europeans, only to Rino Massic, who also won the World Championships. You beat some of the tough guys from Georgia and some other countries.
Engin Terzi: It makes the sport look bad and not professional. What do you guys say? If both parties agree to something, it sounds like a friendly wager. Yeah. Okay. Do you know what happens? I don't accept this. I do the payment separately. Whatever you do between amongst you, it's your problem. So I don't get involved.
Engin Terzi: Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So, okay, Michael, I'm not doing anything. I'm not allowing anything. So, but if they do something, they do. If they don't, they don't. Anyway, so what was I asking you? I was asking, okay, yeah, your form. It was last June, early June, right? First, beginning of the June in Moldova, you took second in the Europeans. And compared to that time, where are you now? Oh, yeah.
Aymeric Pradines: I think my connection is the same, but because I, I ought to say, I know the same preparation before European Championships. I cannot, I can test myself on my really best maximum. And before to East versus West, I think it's too close to take a risk to other injuries. So I have some, how to say,
Aymeric Pradines: uh not all the information on my maximum but I think I feel good and now I will not test my Max uh because it's too close yeah yeah yeah yeah so you want to just see where you are at the competition yeah I was more uh what to say not confident but I I had more information on my pick uh on my maximum
Aymeric Pradines: Good on the table. Connection is good. Sparring is okay. But the muscular parts, I don't push myself before. I understand. And so we understand you both are in great shape and you both have bigger goals and you are using this
Engin Terzi: match as a step for your main goal which is to become the best and you both are very confident this is all i understood and um anything more you want to add before we do the predictions like uh robbie do you follow the east versus west matches events oh yeah oh yes you do like like who are you uh who are
Robbie Topie: your favorite pullers over there that impresses you? My favorite pullers on East vs. West? Yeah. You know that in this card there will be the world title match in this category. I am so honored to be a part of this card knowing the caliber of arm wrestlers that are going to be at this event. It's very exciting to be able to witness this in person. But there are
Robbie Topie: You have some of the amazing arm wrestlers. For the longest time, I was in a super heavyweights and I never focused too much on some of the smaller weight classes. I would never have to deal with them. But as I brought my weight down and then watching some of these events, it's exciting to see some of the guys like Daniel. I'll probably mess up his last name. Prokofiev. Prokofiev. Yes.
Robbie Topie: Yeah, he will have a world title match against Mindaugas. Artem you familiar with Mindaugas? Yes, I've watched both of them. They're both amazing. But it's pretty impressive what these smaller guys can do. Thank you.
Engin Terzi: Ali kardeşim, ben de seni özledim. Buradan Güney Azerbaycan'a selamlar. So let's start with the Daniel vs. Mindaugas match since you mentioned. What do you think about this match? I think it's a 60-40 for Daniel. But I think Mindaugas has a lane that if he can get there and he's put enough power together,
Engin Terzi: Um, I, I think he has a, I think he has a chance to pull it off. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I understand. Um, you know, do you know? No. Who? Uh, is the one from Kazakhstan. He beat Cody Merritt. He's two 31. Yes. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: And he, in this event, he's going to pull Evgeny Prudnik in this event. This is your category, the one that you want to become the best. He's going to pull 105 kilo with left arm world title in this event. Yeah. Were you surprised when Ali Can with such a small size beating Cody? It blew me away. To tell you the truth, it blew me away. Yeah. It is a...
Engin Terzi: His power is amazing. His speed, he's phenomenal. Yeah, we will talk about that much a little bit later. So you are saying that 60 to 40, Daniel is the favorite against Mendoza? Yeah, 60 to 40, 70, 30, somewhere in there. But I think Mendoza... So you are saying heavily favorite, huh? That Daniel is the favorite, yes. But I think Mendoza has a lane, yes.
Aymeric Pradines: And Aymeric, you know both pullers very well. Yeah, I know well both. I think the same as Roby. I think Daniel has an advantage on these fights because of the past also, because they meet each other already. Many times. Minimum 20 times maybe, like each match. Yeah.
Aymeric Pradines: I know also Mindaugas is a very smart puller, very strong wrist. Maybe this time I feel him more prepared, more confident. And maybe he can create a surprise for this fight.
Engin Terzi: I have to choose Daniel. On the paper, you are saying that Daniel is the favorite. Yeah, I understand. Same as the other one. And this one, I am not sure if Robby is familiar with both atlas, but Nur Nurdalet Aydar Khan versus Vala Içkici. Do you know them, Robby?
Engin Terzi: No, I'm not familiar with either one of these guys. And Aymeric probably. Yeah, I know. But for me, Vala is not more heavier normally? No, 85 kilo. This category is 85. What a pull.
Engin Terzi: Samushia for the world title and lost 3-2. And Nurghanet used to be lighter, but this year at WAF, he was 80 kilos and he won the WAF in Kazakhstan at 80 kilos. So he said that he is normally lightweight world champion of East versus West. He beat Mindaugas 3-0. But he said, Engin, I can't lose weight anymore.
Engin Terzi: So when he cannot make their weight, now the title is free. So it is the Daniel or Mindaugas they will pull. And then the winner of that, maybe Alain Zolaev if he can get out of Russia. And if he cannot, then Artur Makaro probably, who is the second best after Alain Zolaev over there. And so what do you think about this match?
Aymeric Pradines: Nurdalet is an incredible puller. He won over Daniel also, not so long time ago. Yeah, in Antalya 2022. It's very fast. They are both outside pullers. Vala is really strong, like all the Georgian guys. They are really crazy, how to say, weight lifting.
Aymeric Pradines: When I saw his training, it's crazy for his weight class. It's difficult to predict, but I will put my money on Kazakhstan. And maybe more endurance, maybe, also from Kazakhstan. We will see. I think, again, Wallah will win. Because I know, I speak with Georgians, it's really...
Engin Terzi: in his best life shape he's really strong and uh i think uh i think uh he will be he will be the winner in my opinion time time will show if you talk with the kazakhs who are training with either hand probably they will say something similar but yeah we will see yeah and robbie this one is not super hard i just don't want any opinion
Engin Terzi: in a detailed way, but I just ask you the, the, the winners, Robbie Toppy versus. Robbie. Yes, sir. Yeah. And what is the percentage of, uh, as you said, like Daniel versus Min Douglas and this one? Um, I think, I think that, uh, my match is probably going to be a three, three to one victory.
Engin Terzi: Oh, so you give him one round? Yes. Okay. And any, how to say your last name? Okay. You don't say S at the end? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Sorry. Go ahead. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
Aymeric Pradines: No, no. Okay, he's winning. Yeah, but the winner is Emre Pradines. And what's the percentage of winning chance? Only if I make a mistake, but 90%. 90%. And are you going to give him one round as he gives you one round?
Aymeric Pradines: No, if I will lose one round, that means he won, he will win this round. But that means I will do some mistake in my setup or in my starts. Okay, Robby, Matt Matt versus Wagner Bortolato, right arm.
Robbie Topie: That's a tough one to call. If it was left arm, it would be easy to call. Yeah, left arm would be super easy with Wagner all day. But, I mean, man, he's so big and he's so powerful. If he's able to get his shoulder behind, I think Matt's going to have a hard time to deal with that. But if Matt...
Engin Terzi: and get outside and keep him separated from his shoulder, then I think Matt's got enough hand to win this. So it's a 50-50 for me on that, just because of Wagner's size and strength. So you are saying that Matt needs to take Wagner's hand to do his winning side quick so he cannot put the shoulder behind. But if Wagner puts the shoulder here, if Matt is caught here, it will be hard to recover from that.
Aymeric Pradines: Yeah, I don't know that he'll be able to. Yeah, I agree. And you, Aymeric? I have the same point of view, but I would... Which possibility is more likely happening? Yeah, but the right hand and the back now right hand is not the same than his left. So I would put Matt... Still 155 kilos. 150, well, yeah, it's really big.
Aymeric Pradines: But sometimes when you become really, really big, you lose stamina, you lose speed. So I would put Matt's favorite for this fight because he's stronger. Matt is really fast. And I think it's really...
Aymeric Pradines: angry and angry after it's uh it's lost or against uh uh yeah I think it is his motivation is uh I think it's very high so uh Matt it's favorite for me and Ahmed quickly who's winning
Ahmed: I think Matt Mask will win. But 150 kilograms, there will be some surprise there. We don't know. And Robbie, Irakli Zirakashvili versus Paul Linn. I've got to go with Paul Linn. But I don't think it's going to be an easy match. I think it's going to be a war. But I do think that Paul Linn pulls this off.
Engin Terzi: You hope or you think? I think he will. Okay. So it is not because of the country, you know, man thing, you know, but you are objecting to policy. Okay. I say the same thing to Georgians. When Georgians are making a prediction against the Georgians, I say, is this what you think or what you want, you know? And so that's what I try to understand, yeah.
Robbie Topie: I watch Paul in his training and see how his power is looking. There's enough information out there on how to beat a Rackley. I think Paul is smart enough and I believe he'll put it together. But I think it's going to be a war. I talked with Todd Hutchings yesterday.
Engin Terzi: And Todd said that he has trained with Paul recently. And he thinks that, you know, Paul is going to win. He said that Paul is in a great shape. And he thinks that he's going to win. Let's see. Let's see. I mean, this level of arm wrestling is incredible. And, like, losing is never a shame at this stage, you know, because everyone... Oh, 100%. I mean, it could be something as simple as not getting a good night's sleep could be the difference in this match. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you're right. You're right. And you, Aymeric?
Aymeric Pradines: I think Irakli will win this fight. Paul is really, really strong. He impressed me a lot when he faced Sacho Andreev. I did not expect such power from Pauline, but I have doubts on his ability to catch Irakli and to
Aymeric Pradines: uh to to put the the match inside I think hierarchy will take the wrist and uh and go straight to the pad I don't know if Paul can pull uh without a wrist maybe maybe with this uh so you think do you think that Paul cannot do what rustam did two rounds yeah I'm no I'm
Aymeric Pradines: Maybe I'm wrong, but I think his wrist is not strong enough to catch Irakli. But if he can catch Irakli, yeah, it will be a war for sure. Okay. And Zop versus Tutberidze. Probably you don't know Tutberidze, probably. No. Tutberidze is a young guy, 19 years old.
Engin Terzi: and he just won the WAF wars in 187s. And while Oleg Zhokh, you know Oleg Zhokh. Yeah, Oleg Zhokh won 176 at WAF. So these two world champion from the WAF of this year, so they will pull for the East versus West world title. Because till now we didn't do the world title match for 187 category. So this will be the
Engin Terzi: first one but and do you remember Aymeric do you remember Tutberidze yeah yeah I saw remember he was at the Europeans you know yeah I saw him he won the Europeans youth category easy and then he was so confident about the probably the seniors and then he pulled many guys at the side table and he lost at the seniors and then he went to the world championships and then he beat everyone including uh including
Engin Terzi: We are at Dobrin and my mind is so terrible. Aktaev, you know, in the final, he beat him so easy, you know. And what do you think? Both are going outside top role? Yeah, Oleg is... I think he's not the same now than before. He's getting closer, but still not there yet.
Aymeric Pradines: but it's hard to bet against Oleg in the same weight class. I will put Oleg because more experience and also I think for
Aymeric Pradines: Osorov, it will be difficult to deal with Oleg's hands. It's very particular, the hand of Oleg's. Maybe he has the power to win these fights, but the hand of Oleg is very particular. On the paper, it looks like that.
Robbie Topie: do you agree with that that it's very very hard near impossible someone to weigh as much as oleg zog and beat him with left arm yeah i i think oleg is the has got to be the favorite in this even though i don't know the young man who who has the opportunity to pull him but being that he's only 19 years old uh he does not have a lot of experience um
Robbie Topie: Nowhere near the experience that Oleg does. And his hand and arm makeup is just phenomenal. I mean, it was built for arm wrestling, right? And I think it's going to be very difficult for anybody his size to beat him. So you are saying that basically I don't need to know the other guy. I know Oleg Zhokh and that's enough for me. As long as it's in his category. Yes. Yeah. And Ahmed, how you see this match?
Ahmed: I think I agree with Emre. I think Oleg will win. I think I know Tutberidze is really strong, but with top role win to win Oleg John in his weight category, you have to be really, really, really strong. So I think in the paper Oleg will win. But we'll see. Yeah. And Rabih, do you know who Artem Taynov is?
Engin Terzi: Artem who? Kaino. Who's the point? Artem Kaino is in the last event, East vs West. He beat Sasho with left arm and he won the... Do you know Sasho, who beat John Brzee with right arm? I'm not real familiar with the guy, but I've seen a couple. Baba, do you remember him from the last event? Yes. When he beat Sasho, left arm, yeah. 3-2. Yes, yes. Yeah, he's going to pull against Zurab. And you know Zurab?
Engin Terzi: I do know Zerob. Yes. So they will pull 95 kilo world title match. Yeah. Who is the current title holder on that? Taino. Because he beat Sasho. It was the first left arm title match for 95 kilo. And these two met in 2021 and in the final Taino beat him. But in the past Sasho beat him as well. Got it. I don't
Robbie Topie: I don't know. I'm not real familiar with Zurab's left. Everything I've ever seen with Zurab is his right hand. And since he's had his injury, um, you know, we haven't seen, we haven't seen much of Zurab. Um, he's a strong dude. There's no doubt about that. So I would imagine that with his right arm being, being, uh, damaged,
Robbie Topie: And only focusing on left hand, his left hand should probably be in his best form ever. You know, he has a good arm wrestling pedigree. So I think it's going to be a good match. But I could not give a prediction either way on this one. I think it'll be a good match. But as far as who comes out on top, I couldn't give that prediction.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, I understand. Zulap pulled one left arm match for Petrenko in 105 kilo category. He kind of was injured. He shouldn't pull that match, but he pulled and he lost kind of badly. And then he also had a match with...
Engin Terzi: Do you know Efek Ömek? He took third place, I think, in WAF. Long last time.
Engin Terzi: and in supers and Zurab was able to beat him in that wrist. And then the first East versus West on paper, he beat Jonathan Breda. You know Jonathan Breda, Robby? No, yeah. Yeah, he beat, yeah, Zurab beat him convincingly, you know, 3-0 with left arm. He hooked him and beat him. In the same event, he also pulled against Rambat with right arm, you know.
Aymeric Pradines: So Aymeric, you are familiar with these guys. And what's your opinion? For me, Tenof. Zurab is stronger inside, but it's like Sasho Tenof. I think Tenof is more versatile. He can pull inside, outside. Press transition is very, very good, very fast. Explosive. Yeah, explosive. And I think it will be a real problem for Zurab to deal with this.
Aymeric Pradines: So you are saying that if Zurab wants to win, he needs to kind of dominate him with power. Yes. If the match is balanced, you are saying that he's going to find a way. Yeah. And I think he cannot. I think he's stronger than Tanoff, but I cannot think he can overpower Tanoff and he will be not enough to beat Artem Tanoff.
Aymeric Pradines: But do you expect a tough match or domination? Yeah, probably a tough match, like a Sasho fight. It's it was not. I think it's very good. Very good. Look a bit the same fight. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, do you enjoy? Have you been enjoying watching the East versus West? Of course. Of course. I enjoyed this. And, you know, I like to analyze all the fights and put on replay every time I can watch one on time the same fights.
Aymeric Pradines: and try to understand what's really happened. Artem you nervous or excited to be on the stage? Yeah, not nervous, exciting.
Aymeric Pradines: I have a habit to be on a big stage, but it will be pretty new because, for example, press conference or face to face, I never do this before. So it's very new in armwrestling to do this. When you had been watching East vs. West, have you ever dreamed to be there?
Aymeric Pradines: yeah of course and i think it's also um you know i i manage a french arm wrestling federation i have my my job i'm physiotherapist i do a lot of things around and for years i stopped a bit training to focus on arm wrestling development in france and my business also on the side and his versus west gave me a new motivation to really come back at my best level
Ahmed: So, thanks. Yeah, I thank you guys. We all together make it look this exciting. And Ahmed, how do you see Taino versus Fabrizio? I think they're both really, really close. They're really strong. Taino, he did a big competition tournament.
Ahmed: a few few few weeks ago imc now again yeah yeah maybe he will will not have enough time to recover 100 why he pulled the right arm he's gonna pull left arm here yeah but the body sometimes you know nervous system i don't think so and uh and um about zurab i know he's in canada now
Ahmed: No, no, he's in Georgia. In Georgia, he come back, okay. I think he's really angry to have the anger to win back after his injury. So, I don't know. They're really close and it's hard to say. And, Robby, John Bersink versus Krasimir Kostadinov. I'm excited to see this match again.
Robbie Topie: Yeah. Have you ever pulled Krasimir? No, I've never pulled Krasimir. No. Never have. Very, very powerful man, though. Exciting to watch. I think, obviously, everybody wants John to win. Just John is John, right? Yeah. The sport of arm wrestling is where, I mean, it's because of John Brzenk. Wow.
Robbie Topie: He's everybody's hero. So to vote against or to think against him is kind of foolish in my opinion. I think Krasny will have his hands full, but I do think he has the ability to beat John because he's younger and most likely stronger. And John's hand is so incredible. He does things that we all still look and ask ourselves, how is this man still doing this?
Aymeric Pradines: Okay. And you, Aymeric? Yeah, the same. Everybody wants to see John win the fight. But in other hands, Krazy is a friend, so I want to see Krazy win the fight. But I think for me it's a pretty...
Aymeric Pradines: Close match, but it's in favor of Krazy because of stamina, firstly. And Krazy also is very versatile, so he can find a way. And now John, he looks less versatile than before. Age is already incredible to be so strong at this. Shoulder injury and everything. So I think Krazy is favorite for this fight.
Engin Terzi: Anyway, both, John or Krazy, will win. It's good for me. I understand. And Matyushenko and Rino, are you familiar with them? Me? Yeah. Ivan Matyushenko and Rino Matic. Yes. Do you know them? I do. Yeah. What do you think about a left-arm world title match, one category above yours, 253?
Engin Terzi: Yeah, I think Ivan is the favorite on this one. Ivan Matyushenko is the favorite? Yes. Why do you think? Is it because of what you see till now convinced you that? Or is there any specific reason, past, or what do you think? Yeah, his past, his pedigree. He's been the man for a long time. I don't know. I think Rino is...
Robbie Topie: you know up and coming he's fairly young right 19 he will be 20 this year finally yeah I mean he's he's pretty impressive I'm not I'm not going to take anything away from me from the kid but uh I think uh I don't think he's quite there yet I understand and I am Eric you you pull Rino you know he's he's strong but uh he's not enough for matushenko I think yeah and uh
Aymeric Pradines: For me, the Rino is crazy. He's versatile for his age. He's strong in every part in our wrestling. That is incredible. At only 19, it's crazy.
Aymeric Pradines: And I think it's the main weapon for Rino. It's the start and it's the speed. But against Matyushenko, it's not worked. So you are saying that his main weapon speed is something that also Ivan has... Which one of them do you think is faster? It's hard because they are fast...
Aymeric Pradines: I think Matyushenko. I mean, like maybe Rino's
Engin Terzi: body is moving really fast while the wrist is moving so fast yeah yeah very strong very dominant uh wrist yeah while you are saying uh all this and uh ahmed is also shaking his head you know like he agrees with his story for uh reno and uh let me ask this one you guys are
Engin Terzi: from France. And are you guys familiar with Vladimir Maiorov? He's also from Western Europe. And Maiorov is going to pull against Samushia. This match, I'm not going to ask you because you probably don't know Maiorov, probably. No. No, but do you follow Samushia, David Samushia? Yes. David Samushia is like, he won six, he pulls six world title matches. He won all of them.
Engin Terzi: We are trying someone to beat him. He says every time, Engin, not good enough, bring another one. So I'm trying to do my best. But he is impressive, right? Dope. Phenomenal. Yeah, yeah. That's very dominant, like six super matches. The guys that he beat, he beat Daniel, he beat Bojidar. This guy you got coming in to challenge him this time, what is your take on this?
Engin Terzi: Yeah, we are going to talk about this one now. Vladimir Maiorov is good. But the only thing is that Maiorov, like around four years, he stopped competing. And then beginning of November, he pulled Swiss Open. In his category, he destroyed everyone. And he gave some damage to the overall competition as well. So I offered him the match. He said that, you know, Engin, listen, I need more time. And I said, okay. And then...
Engin Terzi: He come back to me and said, I changed my mind. I'm going to pull the guy. And no matter what the outcome is, for sure, I'm going to invite the guy again. So I'm just because I know his potential. But I still think that it will not be easy. Yesterday, he was like a little bit humble at the beginning on the podcast. And then when Samushia said he is in a great shape.
Engin Terzi: And then he said, oh, I'm happy that you're in great shape. So you will not have an excuse when I beat you. So then I'm like, okay, the guy really coming here to win, you know? So we will see, we will see, you know? Yeah. But yeah, but Samushia is just, I mean, rock, you know, but we see, you know, and Aymeric,
Aymeric Pradines: Yeah, I see David clearly favorite for this fight because of his recent domination. Maiorov is, yes, he's really strong, but four years ago, yeah, he did really great. Now he come back. What if he was like in the same shape of four years ago? Yeah, we'd be close. It would be close. Also, you are thinking right now it will not be close.
Aymeric Pradines: Yeah, I don't know how close he is now from his very best shape. But he did great at Swiss Open. Were you there? No, but Ahmed was there. Ahmed, did you follow him? Yeah, I followed him. This guy, he really impressed me every time. Because I think he's...
Ahmed: the type of guy who can always make a surprise you know he can beat he can be truly really strong guys so i i will be not surprised if he beat samusha or he will be close to samusha and i will be not surprised if he lose fast because like you said he he come back from four years of no cup eating uh if we don't uh
Engin Terzi: take Swiss Open so we will see it will be I don't I don't I will be surprised if someone right away beats him and dominates myro early round fresh round I don't think it will happen the fresh round I don't think that it will be easy match yeah I think yeah if if one guy wins fast on the round one it may be myro my opinion yeah but but him to do that four times
Engin Terzi: You know, if it goes to endurance game, you know, we will see. We will see. Yeah, I don't do prediction, but just one round. I don't see Samushia because Samushia is not type of guy, Samushia. Yeah, I see. You don't see Samushia doing this. I mean, maybe he did it, but I kind of don't remember so much.
Engin Terzi: I think David will lose the center, but he will come back on the fight. I understand. The other day when I asked Samushia which one was his toughest match, he said it was Bojidar. All of the title matches. Samushia is not really like...
Engin Terzi: like dominating guy you know he's just like a warrior you know like you saw that he lost one round to Daniel and the second round was a war and then and then the guys get exhausted you know the same with Bojidar he won round one second round maybe he was a pin maybe it wasn't he wasn't cold uh so and then he come back and he beat three one so also while I beat him round one and then Wars and then he wins so we will see we will see um
Engin Terzi: Anyway, so let's go to the next one. Okay, this one is my personal favorite one. Ali Can Muratov versus Evgeny Prudnik. You know, Ali Can is the one that beat Cody Merritt and Petrenko. And it is, just remember, this is your category. These are the guys that you are...
Engin Terzi: like planning to beat in the future. Yes sir. Yeah. And what's your opinion? I think this is another one that's ...
Robbie Topie: I think Prudnik has the advantage because of his pedigree, his dominance in the past. But this kid, I mean, he's so explosive. I think he's going to cause a lot of problems. I think Prudnik has the slight advantage, but it could go either way on this one for me. So Prudnik is the favorite, but it can go either way? I think so, yes. Okay. And...
Aymeric Pradines: And you Aymeric? You're training with Prudnik you said? How many times did you train with Prudnik since this match was set? We planned to train this Saturday but we cannot meet each other this Saturday. But before? Yeah, before I trained with him during his preparation for Dadikyan. Oh, okay.
Aymeric Pradines: He called me for this. But not for this time? Not because he had some problem at the beginning. You know, it was some pain in the forearms and wrists. And so he preferred not to do so much sparring.
Aymeric Pradines: Now it's okay for sparring, but we missed this chance this Saturday to meet each other. And after, it will be very close to the competition, maybe the sixth, I don't know. But it will be the last time for sparring with him.
Aymeric Pradines: But I know his power for Dadikyan. And I think if he has the same power for Dadikyan, he will win these fights. He says now he's in better shape. And the other day, who told me that he's trained, Ali Can trained with Morozov and they said that Morozov is going to
Aymeric Pradines: Bonozov said that Alizhan is going to easily beat Prudnik after he saw his shape. And I don't know. I don't know. I don't think because if Prudnik is really in good shape, no problem, no injury, nowhere. I think also the style of Prudnik is very problematic for Alizhan. Because Alizhan likes when you go a bit outside. Yeah.
Aymeric Pradines: uh when you go directly inside deep deep inside like prunik and and prunik also is very fast so he can uh stop the alijan uh advantage on uh on the go and uh and i think prunik is uh is more endurance than alijan and if he stopped the fights it will it will go to four prunik sure so you do you think that alijan's endurance is not that good
Aymeric Pradines: No, he's great. All the Kazakhs have all the capabilities, he's great in armwrestling table, but I think Prudnik in this part of armwrestling is really on the top. Is there any way Alizhan to dominate Prudnik? Yeah, it's a possibility on the start to go directly like Dadikyan did a bit, it's possible.
Aymeric Pradines: But no, I don't see this happen. Maybe one round, but... Not four rounds, you're saying? No, and I think Prudnik will find a solution. If he lost the first or the second fight, he can do some adjustments for... You know what? I'm organized, so I just want to jump on the...
Engin Terzi: stage and then watch it from there especially this match all matches are great but somehow this one just because Alizhan Muratov
Aymeric Pradines: For left arm, this guy is just going and winning the WAFs in supers two years in a row, while he is like 100, 105 kilos. I think the first one, he was only like 94 kilos or something. Yeah, but if you watch the fight on the WAF, every time when he pulls a super heavy guy, when the guys start to go outside, it's very comfortable for a lesion. But when some go inside, it's more problematic for a lesion.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, but he holds, holds, holds, holds. Yeah, yeah. He's strong. Prudnik inside is stronger than all the heavyweights in the world. Do you think that Prudnik has proved himself with left arm as he has done with right arm? No, not the same, but... Yeah, but beating Dadikyan was just incredible.
Aymeric Pradines: But like other than that, like usually he pulls Sasho and usually he lost against Sasho, right and left in the WAF. Yeah, but I think also Prudnik, it depends on his preparation and how he put energy on his preparation. I think now it's really focused on arm wrestling. So it's level, it's more higher, you know, both arm, right and left. Let's see. Let's see how it will be. But for sure that match is going to go inside.
Engin Terzi: sure yes i think yes yeah for sure it is gonna go inside and let's go last two matches artem morozov versus alex kurdecha robin oh man left hand and the winner of this match will probably take against uh vitaly laletin the winner of this match i i think that alex kardech is going to pull this one off
Robbie Topie: I think with his height and his long lever, whenever, because they're both going to go outside. No, don't be sure about that one. Probably don't be sure about they both going outside. Yeah. I mean, I know Morozov can come inside, but I think that, I think Alex's hand is going to be too dominant up top. And I think he's going to take his hand and beat him. Alex, he looks big. This is hard to say though, because they both,
Robbie Topie: been away for a little bit, right? So nobody knows what their actual form is right now, only what you see on their training videos. Nobody's seen them on the table in quite some time. But just my gut feeling tells me that Alex is going to pull this one off. And I'm...
Engin Terzi: uh i don't know the shape of alex right now um alex is about minimum 15 kilo heavier than last time we saw him competing yeah he is like 160 65 kilo or something
Aymeric Pradines: Yeah, but yeah, Alex, of course, he's strong both arm, but his left arm, it's not the stronger arm, I think. No, his arm is his stronger arm. His left is stronger. Left, yeah. So that means it's not pulled off so often on the left hand at the top level, mostly on the right hand, no? I mean, you know, usually the focus is on there, you know, usually it was focused on there, but I organized many left arm matches in this event.
Aymeric Pradines: There are eight wall tidal meshes and five of them with left arm. So if it's left, it's stronger arms. Yeah, it's more closer than I think previously. Firstly, I will put
Aymeric Pradines: Morozov favorites for this because of all his fights before, he was pretty dominant on the left hands, very comfortable with everybody. But when you watch very attentively the fights against Hermes,
Engin Terzi: On the first round, Hermes put Morozov in trouble. It was difficult for Morozov to hold Hermes. And Hermes left is clearly... Yeah, I will tell you something, information. Around those times, Morozov had some injury here. He couldn't go inside. He was going outside. If you remember, he couldn't go inside with Dadikyan either. He was pulling. And so... But after that, in last June, we saw him against Corey West. He was...
Aymeric Pradines: yeah able to go so whenever you are hurt inside here so usually go outside and when you go outside against hermes yeah you know yeah yeah so uh yeah i think yeah alex can can win this fight but uh from all the the the history before i have to choose uh most of
Engin Terzi: This kind of match is hard to predict because we don't have enough information in the hand. Alex's comeback, two years now, he didn't pull. I think it's something like this, two years. No, I think last year, early last year, he pulled against Dave Chaffee, right arm, and he lost. Before that, he beat Hermes, but these were right arm.
Engin Terzi: before that i think he beat ryan spain left and right at the arm wars and these are the ones that i remember yeah and then before that we we had the the i think close i 55 45. and what do you think happens
Ahmed: i think it's difficult to say you know like you said we don't have enough information but i think morozov will be more maybe confident i follow him a little bit on instagram you know it looks like i know that they always show confidence but i think he's really confident but uh 55 for 45 i say for morozov
Engin Terzi: Yeah, Jerry Jerry Antila. He reminded me credit could also beat Corey West with right arm at the King of Table. Yeah, and the last match. David Dadikyan versus Todd Hutchings. Robbie. Todd Hutchings. No doubt. Hey, the man is on on fire. He is so strong, so dominant, I mean. I don't think there's a doubt whatsoever that Todd wins this.
Engin Terzi: I understand. When last year at the East vs West 2-3, Tatasic beat Jordan Sonev and then he beat Irakli Zirakashvili and then he pulled Prudnik for the title. We were expecting a close match, but Prudnik somehow
Engin Terzi: Yeah, Prudnik looks so dominant. Do you think is there any possibility something like that Dadikyan should do it or is it because Dadikyan is not Prudnik or is it because Todd has progressed since then? I think that Todd's lost to Prudnik lit a fire in his ass and
Engin Terzi: His strength has just continued to go up and his dominance is, I think he's just advanced so much since that loss that I don't think it'll happen again. Okay, so that's the thing. So you are saying that he is now in a different level. And are you saying that in 105 with right arm, he's favored against anyone right now? Currently right now, yes. Okay, and you are saying he's going to be that again?
Aymeric Pradines: 100%. Oh, good. And Aymeric? Yeah, me, I will be not so confident for Todd. But yeah, Todd recently impressed me so much against Ongar Bayef and also against...
Aymeric Pradines: Tagov. Yeah, Tagov, yeah. It was crazy how he stopped the press. What does it say again? Tagov, again, Tagov. Oh, Tagov, yeah. How he stopped the press, I don't know how he did this. I don't know how he did this. He impressed me a lot, but I think...
Aymeric Pradines: It's not about the power or the capability of Todd, but I think that he can have a bit the same style as Prudnik and he can put really Todd Block in a bad position with speed and a very strong hand. It will be hard for Todd to stop the fight, I think. If he stops, yeah.
Aymeric Pradines: It will be a war for sure, but I'm not sure it can stop Dadikyan.
Aymeric Pradines: because of the style of Dadikyan. He's pretty similar to Prudnik when he hits on the side. So you are saying that most likely Todd will not even put a break against Dadikyan? It's hard to beat against Todd because every time I beat against him, I lose this. Because, for example, against Sagov, I was pretty sure Sagov a bit more... Yeah, because you are saying that by step he was going to open.
Aymeric Pradines: I expect a war, but I put more on Garbaev. And this time I was afraid to bet against Todd. But if I follow my armwrestling analysis, I will go for Dadikyan. Yeah, Dadikyan, but you are saying that
Ahmed: The old man always do the hat trick. Yeah, yeah. Todd is crazy. Todd is crazy strong. And Ahmed, what's your opinion? Todd is incredible. Incredible. And again, for his age, he's like, wow. But I think that he can have enough side pressure. They have a great hand, you know, hand control. So I think he will win.
Engin Terzi: I agree with the analysis also of Emrik, with his hand, with his hook, he will beat him, I think. I understand. And then before we finish, I want to ask, Robbie, will anything change when Levan Saginashvili and Devon Larratt pull again? I think that the outcome will be the same.
Engin Terzi: However, I think Devin will look better than he did last time. Yeah, but whenever Devin looks better than last time, it means that he puts a break. And once he puts a break, it's very, very hard to see him losing. Yeah, but LeBron is so strong.
Engin Terzi: I understand, but if he's so strong, he should dominate. If he stops somewhere, you know, do you see that he will find a way? Because I don't kind of remember. Do you guys remember Devon is just stopping a guy and he's getting exhausted? No. No, right? I mean, yeah, yeah. I mean, whenever we would like to think it to be like to be tougher and then Levan still winning, but whenever we make a calculation, like Levan couldn't win when Hermes stopped him.
Robbie Topie: Yeah. But of course he won some rounds. He stopped him still and he still was able to pin. But Levon has never been in that position before. That was the first time that's happened to him since he's got to this level. So I would assume that he learned something from that and changed up some of his training to find power in an area that he was uncomfortable in. Right?
Engin Terzi: I mean, losing any match is the best information for all of us to become better. Yeah, but just because you learn something, it doesn't mean that no matter what you do, your endurance is going to be better than Devon's. Because sometimes you want to do something. I also want incredible endurance, but, you know, we all have some limits. And this guy, for some reason, he has a nickname, No Limits, you know. And so, yeah, the guy, if I was the one,
Robbie Topie: I would learn to not to be stopped instead of being stopped and then having better Andrews. Of course. Yeah. Sorry. What you were saying? I stopped you. I'm a friend of Devin and I would love to see nothing more than him to win that match. I think everybody wants to see somebody take down the giant, right?
Robbie Topie: I know for a fact that Devin is going to put every waking moment of his life into this. That's his personality. That's who he is. And you can bet that Devin will show up on April 20th, the best form that the entire world has ever seen.
Robbie Topie: he will believe in himself so it makes it deadly it makes it makes it a very deadly combination so is it their possibility i think there's a possibility there's always a possibility right just levon is so strong it's one of those deals that you can have as much technique as in it and and as much endurance and whatever but whenever you have somebody that is that much more dominant in strength as we've seen um
Engin Terzi: You said that Levan will still win, but Devin will look better. So does it mean that Levan is not going to dominate him, in your opinion? I don't think that he will dominate him, no. I actually think that Devin might get a win or two on him.
Engin Terzi: at the last or in the beginning because it changed a lot in the end yes and now okay okay so you are saying that yeah Levan is gonna win to secure the victory and then something like Hermes match you're saying yeah yeah yeah and Michael I think it'll be more I think it'll be a little bit more more uh more
Robbie Topie: like the third round I think it's going to get kind of dicey in the middle uh the Levon will not have it secured yet and and Devon is going to start to uh make it very interesting which is where I think it could go either yeah Michael Mask says that Devon got exhausted in the fifth round versus yes my friend let me explain to you that um for many years many many years uh Devon couldn't really pull
Engin Terzi: inside because of his elbow. So he built his endurance mostly to outside. But whenever he tried to pull against Gennady outside, Gennady's dead wrist press was too dangerous for him. So his elbow got out. So Gennady basically forced him to pull Devon like inside where Devon didn't have the endurance. So Devon's endurance is mostly outside.
Engin Terzi: Not inside. In the past, he was everywhere. Inside, outside. But now, maybe he may have the inside endurance as well. Because lately, his elbow has been doing better. And Aymeric, how do you see this one? Yeah, for sure, more close than before. And if Devon is able to stop Levan, I think Levan will lose the fight.
Aymeric Pradines: But also depends on where the match stops, which position. Yes, of course, position is important, but I think Devon can hold a very, very bad position. And we saw Levan against Hermes, he's not so versatile when he cannot finish directly. He has not so much capability to change his way to pull.
Engin Terzi: Maybe he will improve this. Maybe it's... He had it. He had it. I remember he started with outside against Gennady and then they went inside and he couldn't finish and he pressed with the shoulder. But maybe he was just, as he said, he was too big and too... Maybe he wasn't quick enough because a few times he attempted to do the shoulder pressure against Hermes.
Engin Terzi: And Hermes was so smart, you know, whenever Lewand got up and he hit him and he again put him to this position, he just couldn't get behind his hand, you know. But let's see. I think he's capable of doing it, but not on that night. Of course he's capable. Of course he's a really good artist now, but...
Aymeric Pradines: for for transition transitioning against uh Devon it's very you have to be very accurate on your transition and what are so big and so heavy it's not so so easy to do this and I think uh endurance factor will will play a role and who is really I will closer yeah closer but I will choose uh 11 yeah
Aymeric Pradines: yeah but i think this uh this devon version now it's it's he can be he can be really uh levan i think because his formation is is crazy and uh with his uh open top roll or king's move he can maybe spot levan's in some points and uh
Engin Terzi: Does he have strong enough biceps to hold on this time? Yes, maybe this time. To see Devin against Georgi in Dubai, did it give you more hopes for Devin? Or you thought that if Devin is here against Georgi, then he will be in more trouble against Levan?
Aymeric Pradines: I think, yeah, this version, I don't think Devon one year, two years ago was able to do this against Georgie. And now Georgie is really, really strong. He's trained hard. He's in really good shape. And Georgie on Asian is really crazy. And we saw Devon pretty, how to say?
Aymeric Pradines: not easy but on control on this fight and he was able also to give a bit to to georgie and even come back to to the fight uh yeah when you say give it to it is did he give or or
Aymeric Pradines: Georgi took it. Yeah, I think it's not give to give, but he tried something, I think, Devin. He tried some other way to beat Georgi. When you compare the first round, it was very tight and focused. And the later round, he... Every round, Georgi had the control of the match. This is what also Devin said on Travis' podcast. He said, I never had control until every round he got exhausted.
Engin Terzi: Georgi had the control, he was coming back, he was hitting him again, Devon was only trying to survive. No, when he start to talk at the beginning, Devon, no. No, Devon also said, I can show you the podcast. He says that people because I was talking shit, people thought that I was having easy time. It was like, it was the red line, you know, borderline, you know, he said that, like, he was like, in very hard, I mean, anyone who knows Armaz, his wrist went back in.
Engin Terzi: How beautiful is Hermes? Hermes couldn't do what Georgi is capable of. Georgi cannot do what Hermes is capable of. If Hermes would take Devon here with shoulder pressure, he would kill him. But he wasn't capable of doing that.
Engin Terzi: And Georgi is not capable of doing the shoulder pressure. So he did the one. What's that? Yeah, the pronation of Georgi put the hand of Devon away. I saw Devon until here, you know, like this. But if Hermes would catch you like here, he would just go on you and then he'd press you. But when... No, yeah, he would. Yeah, yes, yes. But whenever Hermes and Devon went outside, Georgi took here, but Hermes lost here. So he couldn't do that to Devon.
Engin Terzi: I mean, so this is the beauty of armacy. There's some parts. So that is why when they messed up the people like Devon, that is like more versatile, you know, can always find a way to do it. Yeah, of course. Yeah. It's some way I think we can compare.
Aymeric Pradines: the pronation of Georgi with Levan, after it's about the arm power. Levan is stronger on it, more side pressure, stronger on the arm. But I think the hand of Georgi is not so far on the pronation, but not on the fingers control. Levan has more fingers control. And Levan has bigger hand and stronger wrist, maybe, probably. And maybe more pressure to the pad, you know? Yeah.
Aymeric Pradines: Georgie is only pronating and with muscle, while Levan can actually apply some side pressure. Yeah, of course. Yeah, but maybe Devon can stop him very close to the pad, maybe. If this is possible for Devon, we can see a match against Levan. If not, it will be the same result than before. And Ahmed? It will be 6-0. 6-0, Levan.
Ahmed: And Devon is winning? No, no, Levan will win 6-0. I am sure 100%. He is too dominant, too strong, even with the progression of Devon Larratt. Yeah, of course, he is favourite. Can I ask you something, Ahmed? When Levan pulled against Hermes, what was your prediction? David you expect such thing?
Ahmed: no but i know what's happened with levan i know why why why we had such a result he had some uh he was i think he was too heavy too too much weight on his body and he had some some some illness you know he was he was ill a little bit yeah that's why so much my technical opinion levan doesn't lose the wrist but his inner wrist
Engin Terzi: he couldn't control Hermes' pronator. He was over pronating and going like this, but he was missing one round. I saw him, he hit sideways, but he hit Hermes' arm like it was like a wall. He didn't move, but he was able to take the risk, but he was leaving the pronator of Hermes in the back pressure. And then Hermes was capable of coming closer. But whenever you look at Devon,
Engin Terzi: Against Hermes, when he top rolled him, Devon was at the table like this, not open like this, like Levant. He was here and then he brought him here and then he was able to do the transition and finish it here. I don't know. I don't know. Incredible matches waiting, but I know that this match is very important for Devon. Probably the most important thing right now for him.
Engin Terzi: and we will see we will see we don't know what kind of shape he's gonna bring and let's see anyways guys probably we are finishing do you want to say anything uh to the community or to your opponents anything you want to say before we close i want to thank i want to i want to thank you for the opportunity making this happen um what you're doing with the sport is amazing and i'm thankful to get this opportunity pull america
Robbie Topie: One of the best things about our sport is the people that we get to meet. I've never met Aymeric, didn't know anything about the man until you set this up. And now I'm sure that after we have our fight, we'll probably become friends. So good luck to Aymeric. I hope you show up with the best form that you can bring, but I'm coming to win. Yeah, thank you very much, Robbie. It's not opportunity for you. It is
Engin Terzi: something that you deserve you know we didn't guarantee the left-arm winners but you went to the east versus west qualification and you were under like the consideration and and thank you for coming and hope to see you in a little bit more than two weeks my friend and and I'm Eric yeah but first thank you again to organize all the a new team also to organize such a great event I think uh
Aymeric Pradines: what you did start to, how to say, to transform all the armwrestling community and the world.
Aymeric Pradines: We go in the next step of the sport. And I wish also, yeah, good luck to Robbie and wish you a good preparation without any injuries. And I wish you a happy New Year's in a few hours and stay safe and healthy with your family. And see you soon. And the best will win this fight.
Ahmed: Yep. Okay. Thank you Aymeric. Thank you also for coming. And Ahmed, thank you for joining us. And thank you for coming to Istanbul. I will be there. I was there a few times, you know, in Guinea. I saw the progression of the show, you know, it's always...
Ahmed: Every episode of the S2RC starts to be more interesting, better organized. So thank you for your work. And again, it's a great event also for us in France that Aymeric was selected to the competition. We are really excited. Thank you.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, I think you guys, and the progression is because of the vision, because of where we want to see arm wrestling to be. And thanks to you guys, thanks to the sponsors, and most importantly, thanks to the fans that support me, and then we come to this level. But this is not enough. Hopefully, we will be getting better and better. Cody is super married. Cody says, hello, all. Hello, Cody. Hello, Cody.
