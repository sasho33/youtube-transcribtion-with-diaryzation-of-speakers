Unknown: Hmm.
Engin Terzi: Hello, hello, Oleg, how are you? Good to see you. Hello, hello, hello, hello. Hello, Pavel. Hello. You will be our translator, right? I will translate, yes. We are waiting for the next presenters. We will start.
Engin Terzi: So, how are you, Paul? I'm okay. Got sick. Tired? Sick. Sick? You got cold or virus? Yeah. Yeah. Coughing like crazy. Yeah. And Oleg, how are you, my friend? Good? Good. He's good. Yeah. Good to get to know. Yeah. And
Anzor (Translator): Hello, it's a great pleasure for me to translate for you. Yeah, what's your name? Anzor. Anzor? Okay, hello, my friend. Nice to meet you. It's a great pleasure for me to translate for you. I don't know if you remember or not, but I have said, I've greeted you on the European Championship before. In Moldova? Yeah, in Moldova. Okay, yeah, I think I remember you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Great to see you.
Engin Terzi: um so where is our thumbnail he's coming probably um so how is training going uh yeah he said that uh training going very well he's training
Engin Terzi: He's getting ready and he hope that he will be very ready. Okay. So Oleg, unfortunately you had an accident and then you couldn't train. You had some health issues and then after that you started to train and you continue winning.
Engin Terzi: European and world. But like, how close are you to your prime? And how is how is it going? Like, are there progress that in your form?
Engin Terzi: Oleg, you had an accident and you continue to recover and continue to train. How far are you now from your best form? And how is the progress going? Is it steadily going up?
Engin Terzi: Progress is stable. It's hard for me. My hands are not the same as they were before. But I don't leave it. I try to train.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, he's saying it's a stable progress. He's training constantly. He said that as of right now, it's a little bit more than half of his prime form.
Engin Terzi: And he's not sure how long it's going to take for him, but he will bring us the prime form. I understand. So can you call...
Engin Terzi: I think he doesn't press the on the screen about the sound in the camera. He has got a little problem about the camera. So I'm going to make another server for us. We're going to fix it and I'll be back. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. So we can continue while you're gone.
Engin Terzi: Oleg, you pulled lastly in Kazakhstan, and you won the WAP Wars, and before that you won the Moldova Europeans, and now you're going to pull Avtandil, who is a weight category above you. And so in the WhatsApp group,
Engin Terzi: You and Irakli Gamdanazze, you know, when Irakli wrote that, you know, Tutberidze is going to beat you 6-0. And then you said, like, are you joking? You know, like you acted like, you know, like he doesn't know what he's talking about. And so how do you see this match?
Engin Terzi: Oleg, you won the European Championship in Moldova, then you won the World Championship in Kazakhstan. And when you were replying from Irakli to AktoNadze in WhatsApp, he said that you would lose 6-0. You said you were kidding. How do you see this match, this match, how will it go? How do you think? And he can be so high in one category, right?
Engin Terzi: I count myself as an underdog, because I am smaller. But I do everything for it, I train. I want to move to the category of 85. I think that this is my category. And in the next World Championship, I will prepare to win the European and Ukrainian Championships in the category of 85. Well, maybe 80, my weight is not big, but I will go to the category of 85.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, he's saying that he considers himself a slight underdog in this match as of right now, but he's getting... Yes. Oh.
Engin Terzi: but he's getting ready and he's getting ready to uh switch the weight class uh for next year he will be participating uh ukrainian championship and world championship in 85 kg weight class so he's training and he will uh he will try to bring a uh close to best form next year we'll see how it goes okay that's interesting that's interesting because he he didn't seem that way he seemed very confident in the whatsapp group
Engin Terzi: You said you didn't feel that way when you were replying on WhatsApp. You were as confident as you were when you were replying on WhatsApp.
Engin Terzi: He said that I'm always very confident but because of
Engin Terzi: am a one weight class lower that probably you have to you have to uh count me the underdog is that correct i don't know i don't know like he i i don't understand he's confident and he's underdog so he's underdog no no he he he he makes it a little clearer that he's underdog because of his weight
Engin Terzi: Yeah, but underdog according to who? Yes, no, it's a language barrier here. Oleg, underdog is the one who is weaker. Not the one who is lighter in the lower category, but the one who is weaker. The one who will probably lose. Well, but the one who is weaker in the lower category, because the next 85 is a stronger category.
Engin Terzi: I just considered myself to be the least, and since I'm not the least, I consider myself to be the weakest. I thought so. It's not that I'm the weakest, but I'm from the least category, and the least category is the weakest category.
Engin Terzi: yeah he's he's talking about the weight class mostly that's that's how he found that the less weight uh class that they found that uh the people is uh you know less powerful but uh yeah he didn't know but according to him what was his winning chance let me understand because i don't like like when the things are not like really clear he meaning that uh people think that the less weight is uh less power no no i mean i can tell you that like
Engin Terzi: I have been hosting people and I am asking them and I can say that like maybe one out of 10 people from the athletes, you know, during the podcast, they said that this is 50-50 match. Other than that, everyone says Oleg is going to win. I don't care what people think. I want to know what Oleg thinks about his winning chance.
Engin Terzi: Oleg, Engin asks, what do you think about your chance to win? How many percent? What percentage of what you will win? Well, honestly, I count 50 to 50. I don't count myself stronger, I don't count that he will be weaker. Well, here, like, I don't know who will be stronger, there will be some very small difference. The chances will be equal.
Engin Terzi: Oleg thinks it's 50-50. He believes the chances are pretty equal at the moment. Maybe some percentage of him or the opponent will be just a little bit better. So he expects a close match? Yeah, a close match.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, he thinks it's going to be close. Yeah, and would he say this about any other person than Avtandil Tutberidze under 85 kilo that it is 50-50 or he would think against anyone else he would be favored?
Engin Terzi: Artem there any other people besides Aftan with whom you would say that a very close match is 50-50 or only with him and the rest will be weaker? Well, I would fight with the coach. I think it would be difficult for me there, but I would not give up and would not refuse that opponent. I just prepared myself stronger. Who would you fight again?
Engin Terzi: Well, his coach, Irakli, we had an interview with him, he said that he would win. I said that I was not so sure at that time. I would have to say that I will fight with you. I can fight with him, I'm not afraid of anyone, but I will just prepare more. If he wants, then no problem.
Engin Terzi: He said that I would pull also with his trainer, Irakli. And he said, I'm not afraid of anybody. It's just a matter of time for my preparation.
Anzor (Translator): Yeah, yeah, yeah. Maybe you translate this to Avtandil that he expects a close match, 50-50 match. Autog, this is mine. This is mine. This is mine. You said that it's 50-50, right? And I think that it's 50-50. And I think that it's 50-50.
Avtandil Tutberidze: My name is Nara Namduli. I live in Tzvuli. I am a college student. I am a college student. I am a college student. I am a college student. I am a college student. I am a college student. I am a college student.
Anzor (Translator): So it's obviously a tough match. Of course, Oleg Zhokh is a legend. My trainer is not sure that I will win, but I'm not sure since I also think that it's a 50-50 match. It's going to be a tough match and tables show.
Engin Terzi: Yep, yep, that's true.
Engin Terzi: Can you ask Oleg, has he ever lost against a top-roller in his weight category? Of course, after he started playing internationally. Oleg, have you ever lost to a top-roller in your weight category?
Engin Terzi: No, never. I didn't lose to DTP. And after DTP, it was a one-on-one situation, when I either didn't turn on my head, or just fell asleep. Because of my inattention. And because of my strength, I rarely lost to anyone. But I won't say that it was easy for me. There were tough fights, but I tried to win.
Engin Terzi: he said that uh he never lost before the before the accident he never lost for sure but uh after accident maybe a couple times but uh he said because of his head but not with couple right against apple right uh
Engin Terzi: Well, maybe a long time ago, but I don't remember. I don't remember because it was a long time ago. I lost, but it was a long time ago, so I don't remember.
Engin Terzi: He said, I don't remember such a thing. He said, maybe a very, very long time ago when I just started, but he doesn't remember. Yeah, but no, what I'm just saying is his two losses after the accident was not against the top roller, it was against Aktaev. Not top roller, but the inside, you know. He says that after the fall, when you lost two times, you didn't have to go to the roof, you didn't have to go to the roof,
Engin Terzi: Yeah, he said yes, and he said even if I lost some long time ago, it usually was not in my weight class. It's maybe some absolute. Yeah, I remember only two times in his weight class. It's only one match.
Engin Terzi: against alexander kovalchuk in kazakhstan you remember one time yeah and then one time he said that was his first world championship in 20 years yeah yeah yeah but he won he won the europeans in same year he won europeans
Engin Terzi: He beat Serhat Arslan in the final. And then in the Worlds, he beat Aleksandr Kowalczyk. But one match he lost, but he two times won. And also he lost one match also in the same category against Mazgan Shamiev. Just one time at the Zlotysur. Yeah, yeah.
Engin Terzi: to me he said yeah yeah and you're right 2017 but he won 2015 15 15. but this guy for many years he didn't lose the competition he lost only one match he won the competition and so what i just tried to say that he is very very dominant in his category i don't remember him losing you know in his category i don't remember until
Engin Terzi: uh 2022 in istanbul so and i want to ask to autandil um your opponent usually is doing great against top rollers in his category and you are a top roller but i can see that i saw you first time in moldova you are a genetic genetic freak you know not not not normal you are uh
Engin Terzi: special guy, I can say, and you are a very good armwrestler, even though I didn't think that it was smart for you to pull after the youth category with people and then lost in the seniors, but I think you didn't make the same mistake as Duaf and you won. And what do you think about pulling against Oleg Zhokh, who is doing usually very well against the top rollers?
Anzor (Translator): Can you translate all of them, please? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Anzor (Translator): In my opinion, Toproll and Shesadzlevel are the best teams in the world. Oleg is not the only one who is known to be the best in the world. He is also known to be the best in the Ukrainian championship. And he is also the best in the world. I think Toproll is the best in the world. In the first place, Madloba is the best in the NBA.
Anzor (Translator): So Engin, Avtandil wants to thank you for the some compliments you said to him. And it's going to be the first time when Oleg Zhokh will be beaten by Toprol. Okay, okay. I thought it was 50-50. So looks like more he told, more he really tells how he feels.
Anzor (Translator): I would like to ask you a question. What do you think about 2020 and 2022? What do you think about 2020 and 2022? What do you think about 2020 and 2022? What do you think about 2020 and 2022? What do you think about 2020 and 2022?
Anzor (Translator): uh so uh so obviously i'm coming for the win but uh i'm not gonna predict for the future and we'll see everything in istanbul i understand and what's his weight right now
Unknown: uh 89 89 yeah 89 so you need to lose four kilos yes in eight days eight days yeah and what's your weight right now or maybe you translate first uh
Engin Terzi: Oleg, I asked Engin, how do you see the fight? Oleg has always won against other top top players. How do you see how it will go? It will be the first time Oleg will lose to Topie Roller. Then he says, I will win and we will see at the table, it will be a tough fight, we will see how it goes.
Engin Terzi: Then I asked him how much he weighs. He weighs 89 kg now. He needs to lose 4 more before the fight. And I asked him how much he weighs now. 85. 85? 85. 85-86 kg if we eat. I always weigh like that. Oleg's weight right now is 85-86 kg after the lunch.
Engin Terzi: Okay, so he's not 80 kilos, so there is no weight disadvantage. Why does he even talk about that he's underdog because of the weight disadvantage? They both will be 85. I thought he was 80 kilos. So he's in good shape. Looks like it. He says, why are you saying that you're underdog now? It means you have the same weight. It means you're in good shape. It means you've gained weight. But I've already gained weight from my weight.
Engin Terzi: yeah he said that yeah i'm walking around uh i'm walking around like that but my uh competition class is 80. i mean in this competition his class is 85 so they both are 85 there is no disadvantage you know when he pulls 80 his class is 80 when he is pulling 85 if he is weighing 85 so he means that he is 85 you know yeah yeah
Engin Terzi: Yeah, anyway, so maybe you tell him about his weight. Okay, maybe you translate to our Daniel about his weight.
Anzor (Translator): So, Avtandil said that he almost understood everything, yeah. So, Avtandil's English is good then, huh? Yeah, I understand, yeah, yeah. Whenever I asked the weight, he said 89 directly. It is in the translation, yeah, yeah.
Engin Terzi: And Oleg, can you please tell us, while you are here, and we are, we know about, but can you, do you remember the athletes that you have beaten? Like, just like the, in the competition, those heavyweight guys, some super heavyweight guys, do you remember? But only the competition, not the training ones. Can you tell us some of them so we can share a little bit to Tutberidze?
Engin Terzi: While Oleg is here, can you name a few well-known super heavyweights or heavyweights that you beat?
Engin Terzi: I think that, for example, from the Georgians, I don't even know who is so strong from Georgia. They have, for example, Bulgarian Kostadinov, the first, because I fought all of them in the 18th generation. Kostadinov fought from Russia, Leletina fought, but we had to fight back, I didn't get it.
Engin Terzi: Dimitri Rubin?
Engin Terzi: Trubin. Trubin? Trubin, yes. Trubin. Trubin. Trubin. Trubin. Trubin. Trubin. Trubin. Trubin. Trubin. Trubin. Trubin. Trubin. Trubin. Trubin. Trubin. Trubin. Trubin. Trubin. Trubin. Trubin. Trubin. Trubin. Trubin. Trubin. Trubin. Trubin. Trubin.
Engin Terzi: I think he beat Ferid Osman as well. In Russia. Long time ago in Russia. Yeah, yeah.
Engin Terzi: And I mean, I kind of feel that, you know, he has win against a lot of people. Like, I think only the people he didn't really win, like Ivan Ivan Matyushenko. Ivan, who beat him? Can you ask him? He said Ivan Matyushenko, yeah, I have some wins against Ivan Matyushenko very long time ago, but usually I lost, he said, yeah.
Engin Terzi: Usually what? Usually Imam wins? Usually he lost, yeah. Yeah, because he's spoken English. He has some words. I mean, he has beaten, I mean, he's just for sure, like pound for pound, the best lifetime in history for no doubt, you know, yeah. Strongest for sure, yeah. You know, if you count pound by pound, you're probably the strongest leftist on the planet.
Engin Terzi: In 2018, he was an absolute world champion in Moldova, where there were Aymeric, Georgians, Bulgarians and Russians. He was an absolute winner in March 2018. In 2018, he was in Moldova for the first time and became an absolute world champion, where it was a big deal for him. Absolute what?
Engin Terzi: Absolute champion. Absolute champion in Moldova, yeah. I think in the final he beat Pushkar, rest in peace. Yeah, he was incredible, for sure. And what do you think about Avtandil? How do you see him, his style? What do you think about him?
Engin Terzi: He's genetically gifted, he's fast, he really loves what he's doing, he's confident, you know. His style and control is very, very good. And, like, what do you think, Oleg, about Avtandil? How do you think your match with Avtandil will go? He has very good control, he's very good at getting in, he's fast, he's got everything. What do you think? How will it go?
Engin Terzi: He just said that he's getting ready and he understands that it's not going to be the easiest one.
Engin Terzi: No, that's not what I meant. I'm talking about as an armwrestler, what does he think about Avtandil's abilities because he saw him at the WAF. What does he think in general, you know, that's what I meant, you know. I'm not talking about his match. Okay, okay. Yeah, I didn't say it wrong then. What do you think about him in general, not as your opponent, but as an armwrestler?
Engin Terzi: He said that I'm not sure about the age of him, but he became a world champion and this is a very, very hard work and this is not easy.
Anzor (Translator): It just means that he's very good, that's what he's trying to say. Maybe you can translate to our language, shortly? Yes, that's what I wanted to say. Anu, you can say whatever you want, but I don't think it's the right time to say it. Yes, that's right.
Anzor (Translator): so he said that when the oleg had a question about his age of tunnel said that he's 19 and i shortly translated to him everything uh so uh iraqis trainer wants to express his opinion uh and i'm going to translate his uh out on his trainer's opinion he's with you
Anzor (Translator): No, he just messaged me. We had a discussion. We have usual discussions about matches before in the gym. Tell him that I'm not allowing him to express his thoughts. No, I'm joking. Go ahead. So if you compare Aftangl's current form and Oleg Jok's current form, we can see that Aftangl is actually better.
Anzor (Translator): Since Oleg Zhokh could not win the 2022 World Armwrestling Championship and Avtandil did it without, even his arm wasn't warmed up, he did it so easily. And that was his opinion. But I need to, I'm not saying that Avtandil can win or cannot win. But what Irakli says is a totally different thing.
Engin Terzi: He is comparing Avtandil's win against Talgat Akhtar with Oleg Zog's loss against Talgat Akhtar. Talgat Akhtar is the shoulder-pressuring guy, you know. But Avtandil and Oleg, they will both go outside, so they will hit each other's hands. So it is hard to compare them with the performance against the shoulder pressure. Yeah, but...
Anzor (Translator): the one was like 15 months ago you understand maybe who knows maybe also there's one more question sorry uh if uh oleg joe waits 85 kg why did not he competed this year at 85 kg category category why did he lose at 80 that's a question
Engin Terzi: I mean, maybe he just wanted to secure, you know, his win, you know. I don't know. We can ask him, but maybe he wanted to secure, you know. But again, if he went down, he didn't go for Avtandil because he didn't even know who Avtandil was until Moldova. We didn't know him. But probably he did it maybe for Aktaev. But again, you know, Aktaev versus Oleg and Oleg versus Avtandil are two different things.
Unknown: One is going inside, Avtandil is going outside. Avtandil is going to hit Oleg's hand, not the arm like this. So we will see. I'm not saying Avtandil cannot win. I'm not saying Avtandil can win, but this is like different comparing. So I don't know what was I going to say. Yeah. So, okay. You are 89 kilos and you are 19 years. Probably this year, in 2024, you will be 20 years old.
Engin Terzi: and so and you are now 89 kilo you're going down to 85 kilo um do we expect should we expect you to go this year 90 or still 85 at the Europeans involved
Anzor (Translator): Do you think that it is possible to say that the year 2019 will be the year of 1995? No, it is not possible to say that the year 2019 will be the year of 1995, but it is possible to say that the year 2019 will be the year of 2019.
Anzor (Translator): So this year he's going to obviously compete in 85 kg. But since he's still 19 years old, he's gaining fast his weight. So probably next year he will compete in 90. So you say he will compete every categories. Yeah. So he doesn't see himself in this category for a long time. Yeah. Okay. I understand. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: No, I mean, the reason I asked, you know, like, are we going to see you at the East vs. West in 95 kilos as well? Or the only place for East vs. West you would be 85? That's what I wanted to ask. Like, would you feel ready for himself also in 95? Avto, this is a big question for you. What do you think about East vs. West in 95?
Avtandil Tutberidze: Can you beat Artem Taino? Can you beat him? What do you think about Artem Taino and Zoran? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
Anzor (Translator): So he thinks that correct preparation, everything is possible. Obviously, he's more comfortable with hook pullers and it will be much easier for him to pull with, for example, Zurab and Artyom Taynov. Taynov can topple as well.
Engin Terzi: Yes, yes. I know. Yeah, okay. Anyway, so, but if just say that Zurab won the world title in 95 kilos, just an example, because he's Georgian and he's like an older brother, would Avtandil, just imaginary, you know, would he accept such a match?
Anzor (Translator): There are two Georgians, right? You are from Zuraumi, right? Do you know the name of the car and the name of the owner of the car? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
Anzor (Translator): uh so uh if he will not be able to lose his weight to 85 kg then maybe he will face uh surab as a friendly match yeah and he he wishes success to disrupt to win to title yeah yeah yeah yeah i know i know so i think like we are from the same
Engin Terzi: closer region, you know, you have neighbors. I think the same in your country too. Like when a guy from the team is older, you know, there is a respect, right? Yeah, exactly. Over here, we have the same thing, you know. And like whenever I saw
Engin Terzi: when Vala was pulling against Samushia, I saw that they were not like extremely happy, you know, like winning, losing, you know, they were like, okay, this is something amongst us, you know, not to get too excited. I mean, in fact, Samushia never gets excited, no matter who he wins, you know, he's just like, so let's start. So since we talked about Zurab versus Taino, let's start with Oleg. Oleg, what do you think about
Engin Terzi: Who do you think will win? Zurab or Taynov? I think Taynov.
Engin Terzi: And can he tell us in which way he expects him to win? Like, which style? How the match is going to go? How do you think the match will go? I think it's going to be short. I know Budapest is our home. He said that he thinks that I know who will win the top role. Topie role, okay. And how, Kandil? How do you think the match will go? I know who will win the match. I think it's going to be short.
Avtandil Tutberidze: I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
Anzor (Translator): Obviously, it's going to be a tough match since it's Zurab's first or second match after his injury on the left hand. And he wants Zurab to win. He wishes him success. But the percentage will be 60-40, 60 for Taino. For Taino? 60 for Taino. Wow, wow.
Engin Terzi: Avtandil is very, how to say, open about his thoughts. He doesn't feel like, oh, now the Georgians will be angry with me. No, he just says his opinion. Yeah, that's good. Not that it's good that he thinks the title is going to win, but it's good that he says his own opinion, which I've been so much scared of. Anyway, so let's go to the other one.
Engin Terzi: See, it is very, very easy to talk about the WAF guys, you know, about some of the matches. Like if I say now, Aydar Khan versus Vladimir Maiorov. Oleg, look, you know Vladimir Maiorov. In Moldova, you had a final with him. You remember, right? Vladimir Maiorov. You know him, right? In Moldova? You remember? You had a final with Maiorov in Moldova. 80 kilos.
Engin Terzi: He said it was not too hard for me. Is that true? No, it's true. He said it was not hard for me.
Engin Terzi: He remembers. No, I didn't say it was hard, but I just tried to help him to remember the guy. So he's going to pull against Aydar Khan. And this guy, in the same event in Moldova, won with right arm. And now he's going to pull Nurdalet Aydar Khan. Who's winning? Nurdalet Aydar Khan. Who do you think will win?
Engin Terzi: No, no, no, no, no, no, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, I just, my mind is... Nurdalet is pulling Vala, Vala. They're from Georgia. Sorry, sorry. Vladimir is pulling... Vladimir is pulling... Nurdalet will turn into Vala from Georgia. What do you think, who will win?
Engin Terzi: He said that Nurdalet is a very good opponent and he thinks that he's going to win. Does he know who Vala is? Valiko? No, he doesn't know that. And what do you think?
Avtandil Tutberidze: Vala vs. Aydar Khan. My opinion is completely different. Vala is very smart, but Aydar Khan is a very smart guy. He is very fast and technical. But Vala is very smart and I think he will win.
Anzor (Translator): So as a strength, if you compare, I think Wallah is stronger in general, but Aydar Khan is a dangerous opponent. His explosiveness and also combination with his explosiveness and strength. But in general, Wallah's strength will be enough for him to beat him. So Wallah is favorite for him.
Engin Terzi: Okay, okay, okay. And since we talked about Vladimir Maiorov, Vladimir Maiorov is going to pull against Samushia. Oleg Zhokh. Vladimir Maiorov and Samushia. I think it's Samushia. Samushia, he said. And Avtandil, do you know who Maiorov is? Yes, yes. Yes, okay.
Anzor (Translator): In my opinion, Samushia is the world's favorite and he will definitely win. David Samushia is obviously favorite in this match and without any doubt I'm sure that he will win. Oleg Petrenko vs. Marcio Barboza.
Engin Terzi: Petrenko. Petrenko. Yeah, Petrenko. Easy, hard? How do you say? Okay, you say Petrenko, but how the match is going to go? He said it's going to be a hard one, but he still thinks that Petrenko will win.
Anzor (Translator): And you, Alphandio? I think Petrenko is going to win this match. So obviously Petrenko is going to win. From my opinion, Petrenko is going to win this match. Does he have any specific reason? What specific reason? I don't know. I don't know.
Anzor (Translator): So if we take past East-West competitions, he was in a great shape. So because of his shape, I think that his form is great. Matt Mask versus Wagner Bortolato. Bortolato.
Avtandil Tutberidze: Bortolato? Evgeny with Brava, still Bortolato? Yes. Okay, okay. And you? How are you doing? I'm fine, I'm fine. I don't know how long it will take, but I'm not afraid of anything, and that's for sure. I'm confident and confident.
Anzor (Translator): so obviously it's gonna be a tough match and i'm not sure about who will win i think it's 50 50 match and it will be as a show and as it will be good to watch and emotionally it will be so good okay okay okay oleg do you think the table will survive after you know
Engin Terzi: He said it's going to be tough for a table. Tough on table, right? Yeah. Okay, yeah. And let's go. Aymeric Pradines versus Robby Tappi.
Engin Terzi: Do you know them? Do you know them? Do you know them? Do you know them? Do you know them? Do you know them? Do you know them? Do you know them? Do you know them? Do you know them? Do you know them?
Anzor (Translator): So I think that Aymeric is going to win. He has been on the European Championship and I think his form is actually good.
Engin Terzi: It's good. You know what I like about Avtandil? Avtandil is not only armwrestler. He's also a fan. You know, you can see that, you know, he's searching, he's checking everything. That's good. That's good. Yeah, that's very good. Yeah. And Oleg, Irakli Zirakashvili versus Poli.
Engin Terzi: Tell me something more than the guy's name. Just tell me some details.
Engin Terzi: I see. I understand that the plus and minus are equal, but Paul Linn also won a lot, and it will be a very interesting fight. I don't think it will be easy for one or the other, but for some reason I think that Irakli will win, but it will be a tough fight.
Engin Terzi: he said that it's going to be a hard one it's not going to be easy for either or but he thinks that iraq can you ask him does he watch east versus west events uh when he doesn't compete uh
Engin Terzi: he said i didn't miss it he said i didn't miss the single one oh yeah that's like good boy good boy i love oleg yeah yeah and and tell him that i apologized him that i didn't invite him long time no yeah
Engin Terzi: He said, yeah, I had a time. He even been talking to Devon, to Lared, and asked for a revenge. And he said, yeah, yeah, but I need, Devon said, yeah, yeah, no problem. I'm not against it, but I need time to prepare too.
Engin Terzi: Who? Devon said this? Yes. I think Oleg needs a little bit more time just to, you know, get in shape, but yeah. Anyway, so Avtandil, your countryman. First of all, first of all, can you ask him what does he think about Paul?
Avtandil Tutberidze: Pauline, he knows very closely because of Irakli's Camtenazza match. Anu, what do you think about Pauline in the first place? Irakli's opponent is Pauline, but what do you think about Pauline in the second place? Pauline is a very strong player, a very strong player. That's why he is one of the reasons why he can beat Irakli.
Avtandil Tutberidze: It was a very comfortable game. Everyone was very comfortable. Everyone was very comfortable. Everyone was very comfortable. Everyone was very comfortable. Everyone was very comfortable. Everyone was very comfortable. Everyone was very comfortable. Everyone was very comfortable.
Anzor (Translator): So we know Pauling well. His side pressure is so strong since his setup at the beginning is so discomfortable for any opponent. And also in general Pauling is so strong. But we believe in Irakli and for us Irakli's strength will be the reason why he will beat him.
Unknown: Okay, because I'm so tired, Paolo. Who did Oleg say that was going to win in this match? Irakli. Irakli, right? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Let's go. Oleg. Oleg Zhokh versus Avten Yusuf Berizde. Oleg Zhokh. Oleg Zhokh. What is the score?
Engin Terzi: What is the score? What score? 3-2. 3-2. No, just you know that title matches starting from 2024 are best of seven. So the winner needs to win four times. They changed it this year. It will be better than seven. So you need to win four times to win.
Engin Terzi: 4-3. 4-3. Oh, so it's very close match he's expecting. It means that he also trusts his endurance. Because he thinks he's going to go seven rounds and he's going to win. Okay. That means you trust your endurance. That's very good. If you can withstand seven rounds, that's great.
Avtandil Tutberidze: more to do is he said yes i can i'm getting ready okay and and our sandia sorry
Engin Terzi: Can you repeat the question so I will make it clear? There is no question. Who is going to win? Al-Avtandil or Oleg? Of course, Al-Avtandil. Al-Avtandil is going to win? How is he going to win? Tell us, Al-Avtandil. Tell us. Just show your vision to us. Al-Avtandil. Al-Avtandil. Is he going to go strap? Okay.
Engin Terzi: If Oleg was strapped, you want to start directly strapped or you just want to pull and go strapped? From the beginning, not. If you get a slip, then it might be strapped. Okay, okay. And then we put the strap. So what's going to happen now? Ref will say, don't move.
Engin Terzi: And then, GO! So what happened there? You hit him? Yes, yes. And that pin? Tight pressure. Okay, what is the score? I don't know. Listen, you told him and you beat him. So are you going to lose later on?
Avtandil Tutberidze: It's not easy for me to work with Oleg. It's not easy for me to work with Oleg. It's not easy for me to work with Oleg. It's not easy for me to work with Oleg. It's not easy for me to work with Oleg. It's not easy for me to work with Oleg.
Anzor (Translator): So it's so hard for me to predict since Oleg Zhokh's palm is so big and uncomfortable and it needs endurance since the fingers are so uncomfortable at the time when Oleg's palm is so big his fingers should be endurable enough. So that's why he's not sure about the score.
Engin Terzi: But he's sure he will win, but he doesn't know the exact score. Yeah, exactly. Okay.
Engin Terzi: He says, no, we'll fight first. If we break, then there will be a stream. He says, are you sure you'll win? He says, yes, but I don't know what the score will be, with what score, because he says, well, it's not known how it will go. Because Oleg has a big, big thumb, very big, it's not known how it will sound to me, to hold it or not to hold it. He says, well, let's go from the start up and then immediately strongly to the side. And he says, we'll fight, we'll see.
Engin Terzi: After all, you are only 19 years old. And how does it feel to know that you're going to pull at the East versus West stage? Artem you excited? Yes, I'm very excited. It's a new experience for me. It's a new experience for me. It's a new experience for me. It's a new experience for me. It's a new experience for me.
Anzor (Translator): So obviously he has got so much respect for that. And he's so pleased that he will be able to gain new experiences and to compete at East-West versus Estonian agreement. Yeah, we are happy that you will be competing over here. Let's go to the next one. Daniel Prokopchuk, Irakli Zirakashvili.
Engin Terzi: I think I need to get rest from this. You realize I'm making so many mistakes.
Engin Terzi: like day before i did four and a half hours uh live and yesterday was two and a half hours and then i just i i need rest yeah sorry about it uh daniel prokopchuk
Engin Terzi: Well, Daniel is not an easy opponent, but in order not to impose his fight on him, well, Daniel likes to fight in his position, as if he were running away from the connection, but in order not to impose his fight on him, for example, with a hook or in a hook, it will be an interesting fight here. Who will take the start? Who imposed his fight is important.
Engin Terzi: Who do you think will win? I think that if Daniel holds him, if he catches him, he will hold on, he will last longer.
Engin Terzi: he said the the this match is very very interesting very close it's very depends on who will be able to you know push his style Daniel is usually mostly side pressure guy and the other side is may you know uh push his style he said it's going to be very hard for the Daniel if he will not accommodate his uh stop on the start it's very important he said that if he will be able to stop in there uh
Avtandil Tutberidze: proper position then daniel will win but it's it's a tough one okay technical realities
Avtandil Tutberidze: Minds, uh, kind of just, uh, so I'll answer the area. How is category national?
Anzor (Translator): It's going to be a hard match, obviously. Daniel Prokopchuk is so strong, but I think Tarasaitis will be able to take his wrist. But Daniel Prokopchuk is also very strong compared to his weight category. But as a final prediction, I think that Daniel will be able to beat him. Daniel will win, he says. And okay.
Unknown: Ivan Matyushenko, Rino Matic, Oleg. Left arm, Lewa. I don't know if he's Ukrainian. Is this Lewa? Lewa.
Engin Terzi: Interesting, but I think that Rino is a dangerous opponent. And he can impose his own fight and win. That's what I suspect. But I think that Matyushenko will be well prepared. He understands everything. I think that Rino will win. I think that Rino will win. But Matyushenko will be well prepared for this.
Engin Terzi: He said that Ivan Matyushenko will be very well ready, but he still thinks that Rino has a little bit, slight better chance to win it. He may push his style. Wow. I think Oleg may be the only one or maybe second person that is favouring Rino over Ivan. Yeah, that's good that some people believe the opposite way. Yeah, that's good.
Engin Terzi: You are probably the only person who thinks he can win. It's good that some people don't think like everyone else.
Engin Terzi: Well, I just saw how he fought, I saw how he fought on the street, and he beat a lot of very difficult opponents. He even imposed, I don't remember exactly the details, but they had something with Alizhan.
Engin Terzi: It was all in one place. I don't remember how it was.
Engin Terzi: He said that he's been watching him at the World Championship and he said that he's been able to push his style with very, very serious opponents. And he said even with Alizhan it was not an easy match, it was some back and forth a little bit. It was right arm, this one is left arm. Alizhan's left arm is a little bit different, yeah. Yeah. It's going to be left, but it was right, so...
Engin Terzi: Alizhan and Rino were on the right. I understand. They were on the right. But I remember they were arguing.
Engin Terzi: i say he said yeah i just remembered that uh there was uh you know back and forth so it was uh yeah yeah first match alijan won and the alijan hospital countries sandras won after the war and then reno and alijan pulled again and this time reno won yeah it was like that yeah and autandil how do you what do you expect from this match ivan matushenko versus reno message
Avtandil Tutberidze: I think Ivan Matyushenko is my favorite, but Rino San is strong and strong. I think Ivan Matyushenko is my favorite, but Rino San is strong and strong. I think Ivan Matyushenko is my favorite,
Anzor (Translator): So, undoubtedly, the favorite is Ivan Matyushenko in this match, but Rino message is so explosive and fast at the beginning of the match. So, I'm going to say that match is 70-30, 70 for Ivan Matyushenko. Oh, okay. Okay, let's see the next one. John Brzing versus Krasimir Kostadinov, Oleg.
Engin Terzi: I think it's John Brzee. They've fought before, I think they've met more than once, but I think he's probably the oldest athlete in our sport, a veteran of this sport, but I think he knows the key to everyone, if he wants to.
Engin Terzi: He said that he thinks that John Brzenk will win. And yes, he is one of the oldest athletes in our sport. And they've been pulling before with Kostadinov. But he said that his ability of finding the keys probably is the best. And he can find the key to any athlete. So John is going to win? Yes. Avtandil? Yes. My name is Avtandil. I'm from Krasnyi Milim.
Avtandil Tutberidze: John is my favorite club member, but the fact that he's been here for so many years makes me feel like he's a part of my family.
Anzor (Translator): uh so in this case uh oh john zank is my favorite i'm wrestler of all time he's a one-hour slow who inspired him but because of his age i think that his strength is kind of gone away already and i think that crossing will be able to beat him i understand and my favorite match
Engin Terzi: All of them are my favorites. I said all of these matches, but one of them is really confusing me. Oleg, who is winning? You are from Ukraine, so you will say Evgeny Prudnik probably. Evgeny Prudnik versus Ali Canmuradov. But it may be your real opinion, objective opinion too. Who?
Engin Terzi: I think it will be the most interesting fight. Of course, I support Evgeny and Zhenya. I think he will win, but I think it will be a tough fight for him. I support Evgeny and I think Zhenya will win.
Engin Terzi: He said that this is the most interesting match of the card. And he said, yes, absolutely. I am cheering for Evgeny Prudnik. And he thinks that he will pull the win. But he said it's for sure not going to be easy. Okay. He says Prudnik, he thinks it's going to be easy. It will be a win, but it will be a war. That's what he says, yeah. Yeah. Okay.
Avtandil Tutberidze: What is your opinion? Thank you very much. I am very happy. I don't know if it is true or not, but I would like to say that I am very happy to be able to talk to you today.
Anzor (Translator): So it will be one of the hardest matches. It is obviously 50-50, but I think that Evgeny Prudnik will be able to find the key of his win, which will open the door of his winning. So, Avtandil, do you see yourself in the next few years
Engin Terzi: Being around 105 kg and pulling against these legends that we are just talking about, like Prudnik and Alizhan Muratov and all these guys, do you see yourself... Do you see yourself in any of these years? I mean, in any of these years, do you see yourself in any of these years? I mean, in any of these years, I mean, in any of these years, I mean, in any of these years, I mean, in any of these years, I mean, in any of these years, I mean, in any of these years, I mean, in any of these years, I mean, in any of these years, I mean,
Anzor (Translator): So slowly he's getting ready for everything and he will accept any challenge you give him.
Engin Terzi: So he thinks he's gonna be there, right? He has such a dream, he has such a dream, when he watches the video, you know, one day, one day I will be there. Yes, yes, of course. See, Paolo, whenever I see such a young guy, 19, 20 years old, like, it is like, I kind of feel like it is my duty to motivate him, you understand? Because it's just like, yeah.
Engin Terzi: and I like when when those young guys young boys saying yeah slowly we are getting there I mean yeah slowly within a year they got on the very top of the world yeah this is this is our future these guys are our future yeah absolutely and our where is where is Oleg Oleg
Engin Terzi: he turned off the camera for some reason one second he said he he's he's he's listening okay let's start with our autumnal first artem morozov versus alex kurdecha
Avtandil Tutberidze: In my opinion, the goal is to win the World Cup. And even though Morozov is a very good player, I think he will be able to win the World Cup. I don't know how Morozov will perform. I don't know.
Anzor (Translator): So again, one of the hardest matches of the event. We don't know Artem Morozov's current shape yet, but if Alex Kurdecha will be able to take Morozov's hand, then I think that 100% Kurdecha is winning if he takes his hand. So you don't think that Morozov has a chance like this, no? No.
Engin Terzi: i think no okay and you continue translating here please so yeah that's what he said oh that's all okay so how how how do you think that uh morozov should pull which style morozov should try hook
Engin Terzi: So hook 100%. Oh, you should try hook. Yeah. Okay. Okay. And let's go. Yeah. You want to try? No, no. I want to ask him what his opinion is for Morozov. Yeah, you're right. Yeah. Kurdecha and Morozov.
Engin Terzi: I think for both of them, but for some reason I think that Kurdecha will win. First of all, he is more experienced and has a lot of athletes. He has spent a lot of years in sports and has defeated very big and difficult athletes. And Morozov, well, he's still, first of all, well, I've been doing it, he's still very young. And I think that if he wins, he's very strong, but for some reason I think that Kurdecha will win, but it will be difficult for one or the other.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, he said it's going to be tough probably, but he believes that Kurdecha has more experience, longer experience in the sport, and he believes that Kurdecha have better chances too. Okay. And the last match. Let's start with Avtandil. Pat Hussings versus David Dadikyan. Yes, we cover moves.
Avtandil Tutberidze: It's not a big deal. It's just a main event. And for me, it's a big deal. But there's one thing I want to say. For me, it's a big deal. It's not a big deal. It's not a big deal. It's not a big deal. But for me, it's a big deal.
Avtandil Tutberidze: I don't know if it's because of the performance or because of the music. I think it's because of the music.
Anzor (Translator): So undoubtedly it's a main event for me. So if we compare Daddykian and Todd Hutchings, I think that Todd Hutchings will win. But there is a doubt that Daddykian is so explosive and as in the past Todd had such problems with explosive and fast starting opponents.
Anzor (Translator): but uh I I was not sure about his win about to the uh against the category on Garbaev and it surprised me since on Garbaev's explosive but as the final result I think that Todd will be able to beat that he can okay and Oleg Oleg
Engin Terzi: To be honest, Diken is definitely good for Hutchings. He's definitely not an easy opponent. I've already fought him, I've already lost to him. I don't really agree with him, but I think I lost. And I think Hutchings, as the practice showed, as the fight showed,
Engin Terzi: He can win anyone, regardless of his age. He is an older athlete, but he can win. You don't have to write them down. They are still top fighters. But I think Dadikyan can win with his non-sportive style. You think Dadikyan can win, right?
Engin Terzi: Yes, but if it is stopped by Hutchings, then the game will be won by Hutchings. He can just hold it, I think. With that iron bond. Okay. Yeah, he said that there is a couple of basic, basically there is a couple of ways where the match can go. Sometimes unsportsmanlike shape of the decan may make a difference.
Engin Terzi: He believes like with him it was. But he said also if Todd Hutchings will stop the match, then Todd Hutchings will win the match because of his steel tendon.
Engin Terzi: um anyway and he said that the decan can be easily a hutchins son but it's too early uh to sign him off the you know of the charts and he said that he's winning very very uh powerful athletes so he said that yeah if he will stop it then it's hutchins but he believes that the decan have a little better edge also he thinks that he thinks that daddy can look favorite to him but somehow if that stops and he's gonna win
Engin Terzi: That's exactly what he said. Okay, yeah. What's that? Yes, Oleg. What did he say? He asked me what I meant, and I told him that if Tad Khachan stops, then he will win. But you think that Dadikyan is a bit of a favorite,
Engin Terzi: Before we close, I want to ask these guys about Levan Saginashvili and Devon Larratt. How did it go? For me, Larratt is in a very good form. I can tell you that.
Avtandil Tutberidze: I think it would be a good idea, but it is very likely that Levan will lose after the draw, but I think he will be able to win.
Anzor (Translator): So obviously the shape of Demolart is much better than he faced Levan Saginashvili and everyone he faced except Gennady and Levan he won undoubtedly favorite.
Anzor (Translator): But the result I think will be the same. But it's going to be tougher than in the past. Because for Levan it will be harder to get back to the stage with an injury. And it will be hard for him I think. But the result will be the same.
Engin Terzi: Okay, so he says Levan is going to win, but it's going to be harder? Yes. Yeah, exactly like that. Yeah, this part, yesterday I told the same thing to Coach Ray. It doesn't make sense. If the match is harder than last time, it means the match is somewhere stopped. And if the match stopped, it's hard to beat him.
Anzor (Translator): Yes. First of all, I would like to ask you something, Mr. Isogushin. If something happens, this region will be destroyed, right? And if it is destroyed, there is a chance that something bad will happen. What do you think about that? Yes, I think Levan is right. He was very angry with the Spanish government.
Avtandil Tutberidze: I think he was able to do it, and he knew that he could do it, and he was able to do it. So, in fact, I don't know if he was able to do it, but I think he was able to do it. So, the main thing that made... No, I mean, there was a psychological moment, because when Trump died,
Anzor (Translator): So it's a psychological moment to get back to the stage. Psychologically, it will be a little hard for Lewand. And he thinks that Lewand made a little mistake when he faced Gasparini with too much weight. And because of that, his endurance was not that good.
Anzor (Translator): and i think that he will not make such a mistake to devil larat and his endurance will be high level okay so i i still didn't understand so it is gonna be hard mentally harder or it's gonna be physically so if it is gonna be physically the match is gonna stop because last time it didn't stop this time i don't know
Avtandil Tutberidze: uh
Anzor (Translator): so psychologically the first round will be hard for him as he's new returned from the injury but after he he gets his confident back i think he'll be able to win okay so it basically will be like last time he's saying yeah
Engin Terzi: But do you understand my point, Paolo, when I said this? Like, harder, it means that the match needs to be a little bit harder, you know? So, usually... You're right, but there is, you know, different ways of how the match can be stopped. David you see them pulling left hand? David you see them pulling left hand at the Vitasel event? Yeah. Match was stopped, right? Left-handed. But in what position?
Engin Terzi: If it's open Kings move, then Levan just push it back to the center. I mean, I think it would probably be a foul at the East versus West foul. So there is, you know, there is a question. So you are going to say that the match is going to be stopped like this close to the pad, you think? What's your opinion? I don't remember your opinion. Yeah, it's a possibility. I still that Levan is a favorite in this match.
Engin Terzi: But the gap is much closer right now because A, Levan is after injury, coming back to the stage, and B, Devon is progressing. So, and yes, you're right. If match will be stopped in somewhere, you know, in the normal position, like to 45 degrees in the middle of the table, to 45 degrees each side, then yes, Devon will win this match. He will bleed him.
Engin Terzi: But if it's stopped in an open top role position with a Kings move and stuff like that, first of all, it's going to be fall and restart. And most likely the second time, Levan overpowered Devon. It's getting harder. It's getting harder. I still think that Levan is slight favorite. But if he will not get his homework, he has to be in better shape than he showed us with Gasparini.
Engin Terzi: Definitely. If he will bring the same shape to Larratt, to Devon, he will lose. Okay. And Oleg? Oleg, what do you think? Well, as we saw in the fight with...
Engin Terzi: But the fact that it was a match between Ljubljana and Gasparini showed that Ljubljana is not a winner.
Engin Terzi: Everyone understood that you can fight with his attitude and that it's hard for him to fight his opponents who force him to fight. I think Devon can impose his own fight on him and he will be much more persistent and it will be an interesting fight. And I think that if this fight happens, Rad will prepare for it and it will be completely different from the last time when Rad lost to him.
Engin Terzi: Who do you think will win LARAT? For some reason, I think so.
Engin Terzi: uh so uh alex saying that uh uh he thinks that devon will do his homework much better than the last time and he'll be ready and the uh last match of gasparini and uh levan showed that you know it's it's possible to go and uh pull with levan in the there is he shows us the door where it he can be beat it and also he said that uh listen the the
Engin Terzi: the fact that he did not show up to the last round he did not walk to the table for the last round it's it could be you know a fail of his winning and Gasparini could have take the you know the the win depends on the rules of the Federation and he said that yeah Devon will will bring a better form and he thinks that he have a slight better chance so he thinks that slightly Devon is the favorite yes
Engin Terzi: Okay. Yeah. There are some people think that way. Some people think the opposite way. Yeah, we respect all of them. But yeah, for sure. For sure the match will be closer. You know, I don't know how it will finish, but I am 100% sure that Devon is now in better shape than their previous match. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: yep anyways thank you very much oleg thank you very much and thank you for translation my friends good to see you again hope to see you maybe next time in slovakia are you going there uh i'm gonna be on the east versus west event in istanbul oh you're coming yeah okay that's good it will be nice to see you and paulo once again uh thank you very much my friends and my pleasure yeah so see you guys in how many days you arriving on probably
