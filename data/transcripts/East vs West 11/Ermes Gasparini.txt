SPEAKER_01: Hello, guys. Hello, Nick. Hello, the Buffalo. Yeah, looks like like yeah, yeah. Let's do some solo podcast with these guys.
SPEAKER_01: And it will be like, we will be focusing one person at a time. White stone hanging. Thank you for all you do for the sport. You are welcome. My friend. Thank you very much. Hello. Hello. Hey, I heard about quick. Yeah. I mean about what something happened or generally. Yeah. He will be my guest. We are, we are in touch with him. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: In five minutes, Hermes will be here. Gennady is coming to Istanbul. I have no idea any news about Dennis lately. Who knows? Anything is possible.
SPEAKER_02: And soon we will be banger. I don't know why they put this heart here. Yeah. Yep. Dennis is a very good man. Good person.
SPEAKER_01: After this one, we will have maybe 30 minutes break, and then Arsen Liliyev, he will be my guest. And then probably later on, Genadiy Kilikviniyev will be my guest. And so we'll talk about these elite pullers.
SPEAKER_01: Hello, Engin. How are you? I'm fine. Thank you, my friend. Thank you. I hope you are fine as well. Arsen Liliyev is training. He doesn't give any guarantee about to come back or when to come back, you know. But, you know,
SPEAKER_01: As of now, I'm more focused about the East versus West XI. As I always say that, you know, you guys now talking about the matches. When we said those matches, and then you are ignoring those matches that you mentioned earlier, and you're mentioning some other imaginary matches, you know. So I am different type. I like to go one at a time. We have East versus West in 12 days later, 12 days later. And I'm focused on that.
SPEAKER_01: And then when we set the matches that you talk right now, then I will be focusing on them. But you will probably be focusing on something else at that time because it's already talked about it. But that is like I'm not like bored and want to talk about something. I actually want to make it happen. And I have enough respect for what I am doing and for the athletes that I set so that if I set them, I will be focusing on that event. Of course, we will be talking about some other things as well.
SPEAKER_01: but mostly about the things that I already said. No, Travis doesn't know what he's doing. I talked with him, you know, the other day. He said he beats Devin, he beat all his sons, you know, everyone, all the family. And then I asked Devin, and he said he's like, he's full of it, you know, just like he only pulled a little bit with Milo, he said.
SPEAKER_01: He said he was going to give me answer in two days, and then I call him. He's online, he doesn't answer, so I'm not going to ask him one more time, you know. Hey, Hermes. How are you, my friend? Hello, my friend. Good to see you. Me too. Yeah. I'm fine, I'm fine. I was just, somebody asked you if you could answer to my offer or something, you know, and I say, like, alaykum salam, Mohammed.
SPEAKER_01: He doesn't, I mean, I asked him, I said, okay, two days finished. You said two days later you were going to answer me. I asked him yesterday and no answer. And he is online and he doesn't answer. I know my friend. It's just very, very hard to do something with people that, you know, when they say something, but they just, I kind of take it as a... I know this when you proposed to him the fight.
SPEAKER_01: uh-huh okay i mean important is not accepting or not accepting you can just say i don't know yeah this day i'm gonna say yes or no and that is the day you say yes or no you say no okay you said no but the important is to keep in your words like in this day i'm gonna answer or you understand yes or no okay yeah yeah it's not but just that's not the thing you know just yeah
SPEAKER_01: So I kind of see nothing has changed. What we can do? Nothing, nothing. I can set you another match, a better match. Yeah? Why not? Yeah, yeah, we will see. Can you beat Dzerhanov left arm? Dzerhanov? Did you know that like a few times, like I have seen Dzerhanov involved beating
SPEAKER_00: Really? Yeah, like this. Gerrano, a lot of people underestimated him, but he's super strong now. Now he's incredible. I saw him when I fought with Jerry, he was super big, super powerful. His shoulder was like my head size.
SPEAKER_01: I'm telling you, many people, they don't even realize what is happening today. You understand? They talk about to me, like, did you see that? Did you see that? I look at it like they are comparing, you know, just like a really like maybe second league with the Champions League or something, you know, just like, I mean, like, did you see the list that I put yesterday? No.
SPEAKER_01: You didn't see the list that I, the names that competed the East versus West and the names they will come through? No, I don't. Look at this list, Ermes. Like, it's not like I'm not like prideful or something, but just like, like if somebody would tell me, I wouldn't believe him that this would happen, you know, someday. Look at, look at the names that this year will compete and already compete. You understand?
SPEAKER_01: Levan Saginashvili, Devon Larat, Denis Siplenkov, Hermes Gasparini, Geri Kadoret, John Brzezink, Vitaly Laletin, Gennady Kuvitbinia, Georgi Svetkov, Alex Kurdeyev, Artem Morozov, Michael Todd, Georgi Dizeranov, Ivan Matushenko, Dev Chepi, Arif Ertem, Ferit Osman, Zaur Payzolev, Vagner Bortolatov, Gori Veser, Yigal Nishenko, Kody Merit, Kamil Jablonsky, Reva Zulci, Zefran Glamparelli, Krasimir Kostadinov, Bacios Saginashvili,
SPEAKER_01: I get tired. The list is still going. Imagine that. All this in East versus West, you understand? I agree. If I were a fan, I would appreciate. I also appreciate the fans. But this is something mind-blowing. It's not because I've done it. It's we did it all together.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's incredible to see. And really, sometimes I think about these two years and I think it's like five years for me. Because too many matches. Yes, yes, yes. You think it's only two years, but the thing about these two years,
SPEAKER_00: To me, like, minimum five years. Minimum. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. For me, too. For me, too. If you think when I competed with Gennady or Farid. Not Farid. Arif. Arif. Yeah. Two years ago. Yeah. It's like, if you think about this. Many years ago, yeah. Many, many years ago. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: But I'm telling you, it is because we have been busy. I counted, I organized 135 supermatches. And the one that now with this event, it will be 149 supermatches. And these are not regular supermatches. Like this event, upcoming event, there are eight world title matches. Yeah, yeah, incredible. Really is incredible.
SPEAKER_00: It was a very big work, but it grew a lot with my show. Yeah, yeah, yeah. There is a super chat.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know how to pronounce this, but penacles or senacles. Given how absorbed is strong your pronatoris engine, which exercise has contributed the most to your journey from being weaker than your family goals? My friend, for... Um...
SPEAKER_01: I don't think it is about this exercise or that exercise, but it is mostly about knowing how to use pronator when you are arm wrestling. Some people have very strong pronator, but they don't have the strong hand and wrist. And imagine that you are trying to pronate, and if something is opening your finger,
SPEAKER_00: How are you going to pronate? Maybe with the straps we can do, you can do, but... Still, in the strap, if you lose the wrist, I mean, you need to really, yeah. Yeah. You need a solid hand, a finger, and the pronator too. Without the hand, it's very difficult to use. I think that a very strong hand, very strong hand and wrist can make pronator very effective.
SPEAKER_01: More stronger. Yeah, as strong as possible. If your wrist is not so strong, your pronator cannot do anything. So, Hermes, how are you, my friend? I'm fine. Your wrist was hurting? My wrist is better. Shoulder too. I think I don't have any problem.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe now I will start to train specific exercises for the wrist and I want to see. A little bit now the shoulder because I felt a very big pain after the match. I think it was when I pushed him in the middle of the centre, when I pushed him from here.
SPEAKER_00: Because if you push like this, you don't have any problem with your shoulder. But like this, it's only a rotator, you know. Yeah, yeah. This one is mostly like you put in the body weight. Yeah, yeah, this is no problem. When I push it like this, it's only shoulder, this point. But yeah, I don't have any injury and it's only inflammation.
SPEAKER_00: There is a question, Country Boys is asking, who would win, him or Dennis? You would win or Dennis would win? They're asking. Or table will show. Yeah, table will show. I think I have a very good chance to win and I don't think I will have a very big problem. I tell now.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe for endurance, maybe. But if you see about the technique, leverage, everything for me is very comfortable. It's a style. I don't know, that match was like really bread-cutting, you know? You versus...
SPEAKER_01: lalakin match was incredible and you you recovered your reputation with that match it was very risky match very risky match very risky right after you lose against them if you would lose one more time because people are ready you know people are ready oh he never was good bring him down bring him down push him to the ground yeah he's weak he's nothing you know just like you know and
SPEAKER_00: People are ready. Long liver is impossible for him. But sometimes, really, when I saw these opinions and I know I can do good things. Really, I trained my wrist like crazy. My wrist, finger, pronation. Really, I never trained like this for this match.
SPEAKER_01: And it was good if I trained like this for them. If I have time, you know. But it's okay. But, Hermes, we cannot really be, like, as long as it is not really hateful comments, we cannot really be angry with those comments who said that, like, your problem you have with the long leverage in the hand and wrist. Because if you didn't think the same way,
SPEAKER_01: you wouldn't really push your limits about the hand and wrist after the Devon match. So you also knew that there was some kind of problems. And it's good that you focused on them because if your wrist was a little bit weaker, Laletin would beat you. Yes, if you see the first time when he pushed me like this, and I hold him here.
SPEAKER_00: If my wrist was weaker, for sure he opened my wrist. For sure. When he pushed here in the middle, the first round, when we had the strap. If my wrist was weaker, for sure it was. Like when he fought with Reva, you remember? He opened the wrist of Reva with his pronator. Because he continued to push with his pronator.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah. Like at the beginning of your career, your hand wrist was ahead of your arm. And later when you became like bigger, heavier, your arm got so strong that once you were losing the wrist a little bit, you were just doing this. I realized that when you pull against Laletin, when Laletin took the center, you bring you here, you didn't try this right away, but you try to, you try to make sure that you don't lose the wrist.
SPEAKER_01: You were focused on more here. So now I kind of think that your mind is not about, I mean, let me win, whatever it is. Not like that, but you do this only when you are sure that you need to do this. But now you're more focused on hand control. More confident, I think. And more confident because...
SPEAKER_00: When you train it and you have focus on your wrist and you feel. I was confident because I saw the result in the gym with the weight. If the weight is growing up, for sure your wrist is stronger. But it is mostly about the mind because you thought that I need to change something, I need to focus.
SPEAKER_00: Here. Here needs to be so strong. Here is not enough sometimes, you know. Yeah. And for me, with this and the changes, my training, everything, I'm growing up more now. I like it about you. When you lost, you were like...
SPEAKER_01: you were like, okay, I need to do something. I need to change something. First, you talked about thing, thing, thing, thing, thing, thing. And then I said, okay, this is what must I do. And you focus there, only there, you know? So you remember, I started making it in the night with you. Yeah. Yeah. I remember. Yeah. We were talking all together. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But it is very good. Some people, they are not like this. Some people,
SPEAKER_01: They don't think that something is wrong. You know, like, listen, no need to be prideful. If you think that way, you cannot get any better. You need to sometimes think, what am I doing wrong? And then immediately, very quickly, you need to fix the problem and then go to the next level. Maybe... This is the way if you want to have a good mindset. Yeah, yeah. If you want to grow up,
SPEAKER_00: Your level... Only this way you can do something. Listen, anyone who says, I know everything, there is nothing I can learn... Eh, but there are many people like this. Many professors. Yeah, yeah, a lot. When I lost with Debo, many people, you need to train here, you need to train this, but no, no, it's not good, this training, no, no, no.
SPEAKER_01: And these people don't train in his life, don't compete. I don't understand sometimes, really. What to do? Do you study or did you follow the next East vs West card? Do you have any favourite match there?
SPEAKER_01: But Kurdeca and Morris were interesting. Very interesting. Yeah. Did you see the last video that Kurdeca shared? Yeah, he shared he won... Left-hand training matches. Training matches. Training. Yeah. Like the one with Corey, he was just holding him low, even like half-hook. It was impressive to me, him to control Corey.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I want to say one thing. If I recover my left, I can do something good for sure. Because one month before this fight, when he fought with Corey, he pulled with me with the left hand in the bedroom. Alex? Yeah. And I pulled very good with him, I remember, when we were fresh.
SPEAKER_00: I understand. But I think in the practice like this is not very important. Yeah, you can see something for sure. But, you know, I don't remember when he fought last time.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I think in the competition, I think he beat Ryan Espy in arm wrestling. When? When? Probably two and a half years ago or something, you know, with left arm, yeah. But just remember, like, in arm wrestling, like, before our organization, the left arm wasn't really, like, so much important right now. Eight super matches, five of them are eight world title matches, five of them are left arm world title matches.
SPEAKER_01: And also, after the war started, I don't see you. No? No, now it just became dark suddenly. Maybe you get out and come back. Oh, one moment.
SPEAKER_01: Yep, yep. So what I just said, now I think everyone will have their chances and I think very soon Lewand will come, left-arm as well. The question that I asked yesterday, Prutnik was my guest yesterday, and when everyone is ready, Denis ready, Lewand ready, Laletin, everyone is ready with left-arm,
SPEAKER_00: Who do you think has the biggest chance to be the king of left-arm? I think Laletin. Laletin, but... Laletin, Lewand. I think Laletin and Lewand pull in the Zlotito, right? Yeah, but I remember Laletin, he pulled very well with Lewand. I think first he went here... He pulled him like this and...
SPEAKER_00: And then he brought him back and beat him, yeah. It was a good start, yeah. I think the favorite is Lewandowski or Laletin, for sure. You think? Yeah. Lewandowski first, Laletin second. You think? Okay, we will see. Very soon, all these matches will take place. All these matches. And then we will find and this will be the real reality check.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And do you think you have a chance if you really focus? Yes. I don't feel the same things, same power, you know, same connection like right hand. But I think I can do a good fight for sure.
SPEAKER_00: When I fought like with Morozov, I think if I was fresh only for the left hand, like this, I trained more left hand than right, maybe I was better. You think you would be closer? Yeah, more closer, yeah. We will see. Right now, who do you think that you can win?
SPEAKER_01: Any of them? Just say no, no, no. Like right now, who are the guys that you think you can beat with left arm? Who are the guys that you cannot beat with left arm? The other thing, I don't think. Yeah, hard, huh? He's too strong, I think, with left.
SPEAKER_00: But maybe I have more chance. Maybe with Morozov, maybe I have more confidence. I don't know. What's that, say again? Maybe Morozov or Gennady is ready with left, no?
SPEAKER_01: Oh, Gennady. I don't think Gennady is ready for left arm. Who is ready with left? I don't know. I think Kurdesha, Morozov, Laletin and Tobias left arm. I think, yeah, Laletin beat him. Maybe Tobias, maybe. Yeah, he's strong, very strong, very strong. And he is very strong.
SPEAKER_00: If I have more focus to train the left, I can do good things. When I trained for Bortolato, I saw very good improvement in the gym. Really. I was very strong with the left. So you are saying that one of the reasons
SPEAKER_00: your left is not super good right now, it's because you don't focus. Yeah, I train like right, but you know, my mind is not, if I don't, my focus, my mind, I put my energy only right. I train left, yes, but no, with 100% focus.
SPEAKER_01: There is an idiot, he's saying that, why are you disrespecting Hermes and watching videos? The idiot, I'm trying to find a video to show Hermes, you know, who the fuck are you? Now you're banned, and you can just go and bitch anywhere you want, you know, idiots. Why you need to kiss somebody's ass like this? Come on. Idiot. They have to say, just like to kiss your ass. Why are you disrespecting Hermes? Like, why are you...
SPEAKER_00: idiot you know just what can you say i'm trying to find a video so that i don't know what they do what they do when they put some bad comments i put like this there are three shake selection yeah finish the problem this is this how you do yeah every time it's the best way right yeah out my friend go out
SPEAKER_00: And Dadikian with Todachin, amazing fight. Prudnik with Alijan, another super fight. Now I don't remember very well all the list. What do you think about Matushenko? His weight is incredible, right?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. Super mega strong. Super mega strong. His hook, his capacity is good. To go in the hook is very nightmare for the top rollers. Yeah, I agree. I saw him when he took a hook in two rounds. With right hand?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, was it the right time or left? Right? Right, I think. Was it? Okay. Many years ago, two, three years, four years ago. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Lalletti is like, he's impossible to hook with this leverage. And he hooked it to Lalletti. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Anyway, so let's talk a little bit about these matches. And then we can talk about your...
SPEAKER_01: Preparation. Let me see one second. I'm trying to find the matches. You don't take it as a disrespect, right? What match? Like, I want to ask you the matches, like the ones that you know. Like Vala Içkiti. You remember Vala?
SPEAKER_01: while I pulled Samusha, the other Georgian guy, he pulled Samusha for the title in the one round he won. And then he took second at the AMC. Ah, okay, okay. You remember? Like really, like today he shared the photo, look at here. Look at here, the guy is just like, look at this. Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I know, I know, because the name is...
SPEAKER_01: And no one knew this guy. Come on, man. Like, what kind of back is that for 187 pounds, you know? 85 kilo. Like, it's just like, to me, it's just like, like, okay, I need to press here and then keep it longer. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure, sure. Yeah, but it's incredible, you know? Just like the guy is just so strong. And also his opponent, you know, Aydar Khan. The concept guy.
SPEAKER_00: He beat Nurdalet Aydarhan, he beat Mindaugas. Nurdalet, yeah. He beat... Mindaugas. Mindaugas, yeah. And last year, the year before, Edouard in Antalya, he beat Daniel Prokopcik. Ooh. Yeah. And he is very fast. I saw this guy in Sicily. He won with everybody. You mean Vala?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah, like now. Very strong, right? Like training. Is it true that after the events he also took your wrist? Yeah, a little bit. I think he's the favourite. Wale's favourite? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I show videos, training, shape, super strong.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, very strong. Yeah, you're right. And they have a very good top role. But he pulled it after the competition in Sicily with the Ukrainian guys, you know? Yeah, yeah. And this guy is super strong. Yeah, I know. I think he was world champion. I think he was.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah. He won't like nothing. Zero effect. Zero. I think he's a favorite for sure. And Marcio Barbosa and Oleg Petrenko. Close? Very close. Depends who will go in the top row.
SPEAKER_00: I think in the first round they both will go outside. But in the straps for sure they will go in the hook. I saw Martiu the last time. He's very super big and strong. But Petrenko is amazing. I think he's 50-50. Really...
SPEAKER_00: I don't know, really. Very, very beautiful fight this. This is very beautiful. I agree. I agree. Very, very good matches. I think they will go on the hook and he will win with whoever has better endurance. Let's see. Let's see how it will be.
SPEAKER_00: And so other than that, let's see Robby Toppy from US versus Aymeric. You know Aymeric? Yeah, Aymeric, yes. Robby Toppy, I don't show competition about him. I don't know really. Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Eric, I know, he's a super champion, but I don't know... And Zrakashvili, Pauline? I think Irakli will win. Irakli will win? Pauline is very super strong, but I think Irakli with his top role...
SPEAKER_01: in the hook for sure I don't know I think Irakli is better is better you mean in hook maybe maybe in the hook he will win too wow people people I made a poll and there people voted for Irakli and then and then one guy said I think Irakli will win but maybe I am wrong
SPEAKER_01: And then Tatachins wrote there, yes, you are wrong. And Tatachins trained with Paul only a few weeks ago. And Tatachins thinks that, you know, Paul is very strong. And whenever Tatachins saw the Paul result, he put a laughing, you know, laughing, you know, underneath, you know. Somehow he is sure that Paul is going to win. Because as you remember, Tatful against Irakli as well.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah. I don't know. I feel Irakli will win. I don't know why, but if Paul will win this fight, his level is going up a lot, his prestige.
SPEAKER_01: And the winner will be Sasho. Who has more chance against Sasho, you think Paul or Irakli? Paul lost 3-2 to Sasho and Irakli lost 4-1 to Sasho. One was in 2021 and the other one was in 2023. It's difficult to say.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe Irakli, maybe Heath. But Sassu is very good to hook his opponent. It's the problem for Irakli. But I think Irakli, I don't know. But I think with the top-rollers, sometimes he's weak. He's weak with the top-rollers. You're talking about Irakli? Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: But with Hooker, I think I have better chance. Yeah. And Matt Mask and Wagner Bortolato. Are you ready to change the table? Yeah. I saw last time Bortolato. It was in the same event, right? When you pulled Jerry. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: and then i look at it everything was platform everything was just there but it's beautiful to see i was worried about the rest of the event so i mean yeah yeah i'm glad it was possible he have he showed me a problem of with his hand right arm yeah he has a problem of some nerve he can't
SPEAKER_00: training his hand, the muscles are not connected. When I pulled with him with the right hand before our fight with the left, I felt his wrist very weak. He doesn't have the hand power.
SPEAKER_00: insane for this problem but how about the dead dead risk pressure yeah yeah yeah maybe he can do but i think uh mathematics the favorite hmm yes okay i just got the
SPEAKER_01: Information from Roman tonight, yeah. Gennady. Okay, this one. Zura Tavberizde versus Artem Taino. Left arm. Left arm world title match. 95 kilos. I like very much Zura, but I think Taino is the favorite.
SPEAKER_00: Why is that? What is the reason? I saw Taino now with the left. I saw him in the EMC. I don't know. I saw him on the right, but the left is more strong and the right is super strong. And he has this technique and he will open for sure Zurich. After this, he can use the press.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, so him being super explosive and being so versatile in many things is a problem. Yeah, it's a very good title to use the press. Like me, when he's like this, he can use immediately the press. So Zulak needs to be very fast and took him out of position so quickly.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but Taino is very super fast every time. I understand. And Oleg Zok versus Tutberidze. Do you know Tutberidze? Probably not, right? No. Avtandil Tutberidze is the 85kg world champion and a top roller from... You have a photo.
SPEAKER_00: photo I think I think one second let me see everybody right yeah right here but probably Danish yeah ah I don't remember very well this guy yeah I saw him first time last last Europeans and then
SPEAKER_00: Second time he went to WAF Kazakhstan and he won the Seniors. He beat Talgat Akteev and I think he beat Vioraj Doblin and he won there. But is he a top roller or a hooker? Top roller, yeah. If he was a hooker, zero chance. Top roller maybe, but really I don't know, I don't know.
SPEAKER_01: matches. Okay, then let's go to the next one. Daniel Prokopciuk, Mindaugas, Tarasaitis. Very close. Super close. As a top roller, do you want Mindaugas to win or not? Or you don't care? I don't care. I think 50-50.
SPEAKER_01: Very beautiful fight, because I remember when they fought in the first East vs West. They fought many, many times, many times. Last time it was in Istanbul. No, in Istanbul, in Istanbul, Mindagos won, and after that they pulled, same year at the Lithuania, Europeans, and Daniel won, and then they pulled at Waf here, very tough match at Waf, very tough match, and Daniel won again.
SPEAKER_01: Ah, maybe Dali will win again, I don't know. It's 50-50, it will be very beautiful to see this fight, for sure. Do you know Vladimir Mairov? You have a photo? I do have a photo. Yeah, this is the guy, but probably you may not remember what... No. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I think he's originally Russian, but lives in Germany. Now German citizen, maybe mother German. I have no idea. I'm not sure. I have no idea. And do you remember 2018 Moldova event? He won there. He beat Bojidar in the final. And third place was Clement Dimitrov. Fourth place was Vladislav Krasovski. Fifth place was Irakli Zrakashvili. And you beat this guy.
SPEAKER_01: This guy even beat Red Serdakian at the Zloty 2018. He just like this left arm, you know. Very, very strong guy. But he took break for a few years. Now he's coming back. Let's see where it is, you know. It's too to say, my friend. Because I don't say too many times.
SPEAKER_00: Last five matches. Ivan Matyshenko vs. Rino Matic. First of all, what do you think about Rino? Rino, I'm sure if he will continue like this, he will be a super champion. Whenever you say this,
SPEAKER_00: If you continue like this, it sounds like right now he's not ready. This is how I understood from you. I mean like if he wants to go like top five, top ten, super heavyweight or top level, I mean like this. In short, can he beat Ivan or no? Left arm, off title match.
SPEAKER_00: If I need to put the money, I put the money on... Ivan or Rino? Ivan. But my heart is with Rino.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, so your money is on Ivan, your heart is on Reno. Why is that? Why is your heart on Reno? I hope Reno, he will win. Why is that? Because... Yeah, we are friends. Oh, he is your friend? I feel very good friendship with him. Okay, that's good, that's good. And he's young and, you know... You want to support him for the future? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, like a young hope.
SPEAKER_00: Like I supported you. Yeah. Okay, cool. Okay. And do you think he doesn't have a chance or he has some? No, he has a chance for sure. Depends. Because Rino, he has like a press. Yeah. But if...
SPEAKER_00: Even if he starts very fast like last time, it's very difficult to stop him. But I think Reno can pull in different ways. He can go outside, he can go full, he can go press, he can go side. So I think he may not be doing the same. To win this match, he really needs to not make any mistakes. Nothing. Nothing.
SPEAKER_00: Nothing, yeah. Yeah. Only one mistake, he will lose. Yeah. Okay. And then last four matches. He competed many times, Reno, in Italy. Super match. Yeah. He won this Lamparelli, Battaglia, like nothing. Yeah. Really super mega strong. Really. And with Camille. Camille. Yeah. Of course.
SPEAKER_00: He won the Supermatch. He won the Open class left and the right. Last time. Last four matches. John Bersink vs. Krasimir Kostadino. Last time I won Krasimir, I remember. Ten years ago. A little bit more than that.
SPEAKER_00: ten years ago it was different. If you compare right now. It was bigger, different. I don't know. Yeah, yeah, for sure. And John... In the hook we win...
SPEAKER_00: I think Krasimir has a better chance. But if John can take a little bit of pronation without going on the hook, maybe like this, I think he will win. Little favourite, John. I understand. Yeah. John, when he is not losing weight, last time I saw him, 95 kilos, he looked healthy, but he looked a little bit... Too skinny.
SPEAKER_01: No, no, no, no, no, no, no. 105, 110 is good. Good for him. Yeah, yeah. 95, it was not too much. Okay. This one is my favorite match in the whole card. It is Ali Canmurado versus Evgeny Prudnik. Yesterday, Evgeny Prudnik was my guest. Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_01: And he said he is for sure 15% stronger than the time that he pulled against Dadikyan. Really? Yeah, he said at that time he wasn't super ready. But this time he said he is 15% stronger than when he pulled against Dadikyan. And whenever I saw the arms of
SPEAKER_01: Ali Can, after the training, together with Morozov, I also think that he is in incredible shape. And it's just like they both are getting bigger, stronger. What do you think about this match, Hermes? The right hand, right arm of Prudy is healthy now or not?
SPEAKER_00: he's not ready yet but let's talk about the left arm match first yeah yeah I think who will have more endurance will win 50-50 maybe you are saying that
SPEAKER_01: You are saying that they will fight, the match will be stopped, and then the one who has the better endurance will win? Yeah, yeah. Like Dadikian, same. Yeah. But do you think that Ali Can may have better endurance than Dadikian? Yeah. Yes. Because Dadikian, after two free rounds, was pumped too fast. And you, I gave you
SPEAKER_01: A thousand dollars. Where are you betting that money? Don't get me wrong, I don't bet, you know, it's just imaginary. It's against my belief, yeah. Too difficult.
SPEAKER_00: I know Alijan. You know why? Why? Because there is a possibility... You can use skill move a little bit when they fought with Petrenko. You remember? Yeah, but he was like... When you are very tired, this helps you a lot. Yeah? You have experience? Do you have experience with this?
SPEAKER_00: No, but I saw a lot of guys, many guys that are tired and they are open and continue to push you, but you can hold with this move. Yeah, Petrenko did this.
SPEAKER_01: He did this, he did this, he did here. He did everything. And do you realize that within the match, the match stops, he can again hit, boom. You think the match stops, but he can still explode. Yeah, yeah. It will be super, super amazing. And they both very high level IQ. Yeah, yeah. Very high level. Yeah. Rudnick more.
SPEAKER_01: But Broodnick was for many, many years super smart. Yeah, for sure. Broodnick is one of the smartest arm masters on this earth. There is no doubt. Yesterday I asked him, I said, Broodnick, if everyone is ready, everyone is ready, who is winning 105kg right arm world title? He said, he showed himself and he said, I'm gonna, I will win.
SPEAKER_00: He said he would beat everyone. He said he would beat everyone. He said he's the king of 105. Yeah, I think when we come back strong, like a year ago, he can win with everybody. 105 for sure. For sure. Let's see. We will see.
SPEAKER_01: Let's see, there are many people who are training with the same dream, who never know. It is very easy to win on the paper, so when you go and put your arm... There are many people very strong to write behind the PC. You see, yeah, many. Many, many. Super mega strong. Okay, let's go to the last two matches. Morozov versus...
SPEAKER_00: Alex Kurdecha. If I need to see about competition, Morozov is the favourite because he competed many times, he won many times.
SPEAKER_01: Now, Kurdejka is 160 kilos. Maybe more. He said he has a scale that shows until 160 kilos, and then whenever he steps, he says error. So he's more than that. Maybe 165, maybe 170. We don't know yet. Yeah, yeah. Hmm...
SPEAKER_00: Maybe Kurdejka can win the first or second round. But if it will be a very hard match in the stress, maybe after this Maradona can hook. You know, when you are tired in the top row, you are exhausted. You don't have, you know...
SPEAKER_00: Yes, he's 50-50. Maybe there is more chance Morozov can win easily. Maybe Kurdejka can win easily. He has more chance, Morozov, to win than Kurdejka, I think. So Morozov has more chance? Yes, I think so. Do you think Morozov has chance to top Kurdejka in the early, fresh rounds?
SPEAKER_00: I don't know. It's very difficult. But I don't know. When he competed with Corey West, I saw him super solid in the top, around the hook, everywhere. I don't know, really. I think he will go in the hook with him.
SPEAKER_01: I understand. Okay, so the last one. The last one is the main event. David Dadikian versus Todd Hutchings. Guys, don't ask the provocative, hateful, you know, these kind of questions. No need, you know. Just, like, if you are here to cause problems, just please stay away, you know. Okay.
SPEAKER_01: go ahead just ask yes tell me in your opinion uh that he can i think that he can we win wow because most of the people think sata shins is gonna win and you think that he can is gonna win with the top row like when they bow to this
SPEAKER_00: Because I think Dadikian has more back pressure than Ongarbeev. You think Dadikian has more back pressure than Ongarbeev? Yeah. His bicep is more strong, I think. I understand. I mean, I don't know about him, but his wrist is very strong.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, super strong. I think a little chance to win more than he can. He's very fast. Yes, very strong. Especially hand and wrist. I watched Irakli versus Ongarbev.
SPEAKER_01: And I watched Irakli versus Dadikian. Dadikian was much more effective. He had the control. Compared to Ongarbe and Irakli, he was some dwarf. But he had better side pressure, better wrist. Wrist, fingers, incredible. Super strong. Also, remember, somebody just wrote in...
SPEAKER_01: also it is something to remember that he also had the long long matches against prudny before he pulled iraqi with left arm oh yeah yeah yeah he pulled long matches and then he still like i was like wow after this energy loss it will be very hard for him but yeah yeah yeah let's see when you have the two fights too close like this
SPEAKER_00: When you spend a lot of energy, your mind, everything is very hard to be... I think for sure with Irakli it was 90%, not 100%. You know, the energy, the power. After the left hand, for sure. If you win easy, no problem. Maybe a little bit...
SPEAKER_00: but after this long fight your mind to your power of your mind connection is going down for sure yeah i think really i think that he can he will win i don't know why but with his top role very strong wish and i think i have more chance to win i understand
SPEAKER_01: okay so i want to uh announce guys this year 2024 will be an incredible year incredible like all those events will be incredible and especially the upcoming april event you know what's coming in april event i would suggest you to consider the euro subscription and to save ten dollars
SPEAKER_01: Instead of 79.96, you pay 69.99. So like almost $10 you save it. This will be finishing in like 10 days. 10 days later, this 9 days probably later. I think next, not this Wednesday, but the next Wednesday will be the last day. And Hermes, let's talk about Levan versus Devon a little bit before we close. And I also want to announce that...
SPEAKER_01: every signed merchandise that you buy about East vs. West 11, you get East vs. West strap. Oh, man, dude. Yeah, yeah. So every signed t-shirt, poster or the trading cards will be coming with the East vs. West strap. Okay, Hermes, after you... I saw yesterday...
SPEAKER_00: my fight with Levan and the fight with Devil. Sometimes when I don't watch TV, I prefer to watch a video on YouTube, arm wrestling, everything. And yesterday, you know, it's very beautiful to remember a very good fight like when I fought you. And I saw the first
SPEAKER_00: with uh with the devon levan and devon and they saw he tried to to you know they want the the setup he he wanted to have advantage but with the lever is impossible because he have two two
SPEAKER_00: too big his hand. Too big and too strong. Too strong. He can do nothing with this. With me and other guys, very effective. But with Levan, he can do nothing. For sure, they want to be stronger than last time. But if you think
SPEAKER_00: the difference of the of power from this year about this year it was too much difference you know like maybe if 30 percent more oh between uh devon and the levan
SPEAKER_00: It was too much different power. You mean when they competed last time, there was 30% difference? Yeah, I don't know now the percent, but it was a lot of difference, too much. Yeah, they won a little bit in the first round, but... MS, I always say the same thing. Do you also agree, the first round,
SPEAKER_00: Lewandowski went only outside while the second round he was more a little bit more side. Side, side. Still pronated, but more side, you know. First time he go a little bit. Only attack his hands. Not only back, but a little bit more. Like this corner to here, yeah. The second time directly on the back. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: And yes, I think David will be stronger, super strong this time. He will do everything to beat Lewand. Maybe Lewand, he writes to me and me with Lewand. He told me now he's 75%, but for April it will be 100% for sure. He wrote to you?
SPEAKER_01: yeah i show him with the 120 kilo bicep i will tell you something hermes sometimes people think that oh he was injured long time now he will not be as good as before but sometimes when you train for many years and then when you take a rest if you are totally healed up you may even be better because your body now is totally rested totally yeah yeah only one things
SPEAKER_00: If you don't compete for many years, one year, you don't... The emotion is very... You have more emotion, you know? More stress, more... Yeah, I understand. Mentally not ready, maybe. Yeah, this is very big problem. When I fought with Larrity, after many fights, it was, yes, stress, but not too much.
SPEAKER_00: like normal you know because you you this happening all the time yeah yeah july jerry august devon december yeah yeah yeah yeah um but uh yes now uh i recap everything uh it was very big difference now do you really believe it was 30 percent hermes you really believe it was 30 percent
SPEAKER_01: I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't want to. No, you said 30% the first. Yeah, my 30% like a lot. Maybe it was 20 or 50. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Because whenever he hit totally outside, when he came to the pin pad, they both wrist was like. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And then, and then whenever he went to sideway, it was easy, but it told,
SPEAKER_01: his bicep that's why boom you know and but people need to understand that the bicep didn't get like that you know by itself it was because of the pressure of levan but at the same time when when they would force himself here you know you here is forcing out going away and at the same time here is going away so if he stayed in the arm open it wouldn't happen but whenever your arm is opening and then you also force this
SPEAKER_00: It's double, double pressure. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's why it's getting, yeah. I think Levan is the favourite for sure, and I think he will win. I don't know why, but... Davon, he needs to beat Levan. More power in the back. Back, yeah. Pressure.
SPEAKER_00: So he needs to neutralize his wrist. He has very strong wrist pronation, but he needs more power in the back, back pressure. Yeah, I agree with you. I agree. That's why I'm saying that he needs more arm power than pronator, wrist, riser. If he will have my bicep. Yeah, he would win, right? He will win. I think he can win. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, Todd and Olex Lovechild says, is Travis match set? My friend, Travis said that he was going to answer me and then after that he said two days later, which ended yesterday, I asked him, he didn't answer. He said he's going to call me one hour later and he didn't. So he's not answering and I'm not going to ask him, you know, anymore. So if he wants, he can reach me and says.
SPEAKER_00: if I still didn't say anything for Hermes. I knew this in the beginning. What did you know? It was only a joke like this. Not from you, from Travis.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, I don't think he's joking, but... I don't think a lot too much with this match because I know it will not happen. I mean, I thought that... Maybe, maybe, but I don't know why, but Trevi is like sometimes... I don't know. Do you think that he will never be back?
SPEAKER_00: Maybe yes, but... What if he doesn't come here and pull with the elite guys and stay in the US and then meet some local guys and say, I'm the best? Maybe he wants to check before with me in Istanbul now.
SPEAKER_01: Now? Oh, okay. Very smart, my friend. Maybe you want to check a little bit after this. Yeah, we can do or not. I understand. Anyway, so, Hermes, thank you very much, my friend. Thank you, too. I told you maximum 45 minutes. No problem, no problem. Yeah, yeah. One hour, five minutes. I can talk with you like five hours.
SPEAKER_01: Guys, just be ready. In 25 minutes, Arsene Lillier will be my guest. 25 minutes. A few hours after that, Gennady Kvigminia will be my guest. So stay tuned. Thank you, Helmut. See you in Istanbul. Thank you so much, Engin. Bye.
