Speaker: you
SPEAKER_02: Hello, hello, guys. Hi, Ingen, can you hear me? Yeah, yeah, you know, how are you, my friend? I'm very good, thank you. How are you? Good, good, a little bit tired, but fine, you know. Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Hi, Engin, can you hear me? Yeah, yeah. Yep. So, how are you training? Trainings are good? Yeah, it's going quite well. But I would like to maybe train a bit more. But because of college obligations, I just didn't have enough time to train as much as I would like to.
SPEAKER_03: But I did get some good training sessions in, and I think that it's definitely helped me a lot. Where are you now? I'm in my hometown right now. Hometown? And you had some good training there? Yeah, yeah, of course. Here I can train normally. Now when the holidays are in full swing, but...
SPEAKER_03: when I'm in Zagreb, in the capital city of Croatia, where I'm studying right now. Yeah, I can't really train as much as I would like to. You do only the lifting, weightlifting? No, I do everything the same. I actually took one of the tables and the Krassi pulleys with me and I asked the people in the gym, can I bring my equipment? And then they allowed it and I can train normally there.
SPEAKER_02: And then you cannot do table time as you like. No, I usually don't even do table time. So I'm like, all right with that part. But like, how is it? How is it? Like, like, you don't want to do training when you come to the like world championships and no, no, no, no. Only lift weight and the compete. Yes, yes, yes. That's interesting because how to be in like
SPEAKER_02: But good pulling endurance. Hello, hello, Ivan. Good to see you, my friend. Is Ivan here? I can't see him. Just move the screen. No, I still can't see him. You cannot? No, no. Yeah. Ivan, can you put your phone sideways, please? Yeah. Now I can see Ivan.
SPEAKER_02: hi hello nice to see you nice to see you too yeah he was reno was saying that you know he lifts weights and he doesn't do much table time and he can't be i know you don't do so much table time either i think yeah once a month maybe
SPEAKER_00: uh maybe more often but uh with students who are much weaker so okay yes yeah but was it the same when you were as young as reno 19 years old 19 yeah yeah yeah 19. i do not remember well perhaps i pulled more more often i pulled
SPEAKER_00: With every opportunity, because... Well, I do not remember, actually. But I pulled more often, yes. For sure. If there was anyone strong in the gym, I tried to pull him. And now there are not so many strong guys in the gym.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, but in Moscow, if you want, you can find some people, right? Maybe. When I was young, there were many, quite many pullers who were maybe not strong, but equal, or maybe even stronger. Yeah. Not so many in Moscow. Maybe Bogoslov, but he doesn't pull much. He works with weights also.
SPEAKER_02: uh that part is interesting that part is interesting that like like how would you have the endurance of something when you don't do the actual thing you know like you understand you go inside hook to hook with the guy
SPEAKER_02: You know, I'm just saying like, how would you have that? And I know that you are, you can be strong, but just how can you have the endurance of it? How can you have the same feeling? Like I can tell you, I go to three hours. I train whatever I train and then let me go and then do like three session. Like every one is 45, 50 seconds table. My arm would be like this, you know?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah, I understand. But the weightlifting, no matter what I do, it doesn't really pump my arm. But the feeling that I get whenever I compete in a competition, it's that big pump, you know? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So, like, how do you... I mean, I understand. I also... There has been times that I had been injured and I couldn't do table time, only lift. But how would you get that endurance, you know? Like, can you have, like...
SPEAKER_03: a super match endurance like one minute or just say like six rounds like um i guess i guess i'm counting on my strength to kind of build up my endurance so what i'm uh like thinking of is the stronger i am the less tired i get with someone that's weaker than me uh so i guess i rely
SPEAKER_03: a lot on my strength and the ability to flash pin someone or to just get into a good position where i can like get less tired but i definitely um do feel the pump a lot faster when i do like some table time um because i don't do it as often but i just noticed that i don't really need it that much and it could be like because i'm a lot younger so i maybe have some you know
SPEAKER_03: advantages when it comes to my body. It might recover faster than someone that's, let's say, older than me. So I don't know. I just don't find the table time to be so practical for me because my tendons get sore and then I can't really train for the next like a week. And I find that a week of training is better for me than a day of spotting. So I don't know.
SPEAKER_02: I understand. Yeah, I understand what you're saying. But I mean, is there any support that like the training is not the actual thing? What did you say? Is there any sport discipline that, you know, in the training you don't do what you do at the competition? You're saying if there is any sport that you don't...
SPEAKER_02: do you don't do what you do in the competition in training you understand like like yeah you're a tennis player you play tennis like you you yes yes yeah yeah yeah i agree i agree yeah but i guess uh
SPEAKER_02: By the way, I'm not criticizing you guys. I'm just having a discussion. By the way, there was a message between his words, Ivan. He says, I am recovering faster than my older opponents. You get that part, right, Ivan? I'm not so old, first of all. No, I know. 15 years older, probably.
SPEAKER_00: Sorry, 20 years older. I am 20 years older, yes. I am 39. You are 20 years older than him? Yes. You are 39? Yes. Okay, okay. Prime years, Ivan. You're in your prime years. Thank you. I think that endurance becomes better with age, perhaps. Don't you think so, Engin?
SPEAKER_02: I mean, he says that he's recovering faster than his opponents because he's younger. And he's not usually meeting the 39 years old people. Usually at the WAF, he's meeting Sandris, Ali Can, you know, these guys, you know. And you are much older than the guys that he's meeting at the WAF. So he probably thinks that your endurance really sucks. No, no.
SPEAKER_03: I think that I have some advantages when it just comes to general, you know, recovery from training and all that stuff. And I think that some of that does translate to competition when you're like resting in between sets, in between matches, especially in a supermatch format. I think that I can get the blood out of my hands maybe a bit faster than someone older than me. So I think that that's where the advantage is.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, like those Bulgarians, like Krasimir, Sasho, Georgi, I mean, sometimes they pull two times a day. They almost pull every day. If they pull once a day, they say like they are not training enough. They do table training, you know.
SPEAKER_02: And usually they have good endurance. Karasimil has good endurance. Sasha has good endurance. But from other side, I know Ivan has also good endurance. But he gets his endurance weightlifting, probably perhaps Ivan choosing the health over limit pushing. What do you say, Ivan?
SPEAKER_00: What is the question? How I train? The question is that you have very good endurance. But Krasimir, Sasha, they also have very good endurance. They do their endurance with table time. You do your endurance not really so much. With exercises. Rather big volume, I think. And imitation exercises that are very close to my pulling. So it's rather the same, I think.
SPEAKER_02: My exercises are very close to my point, I would say. I agree. Mine are the same, but you cannot really coordinate as many muscle groups you coordinate when you are with the weights. I mean, I also do very... I think I can. You can? I think I can. With the weights, you can really train your fingers?
SPEAKER_02: the wrist, pronation, supination, bicep, lats, side pressure, all of them at once? I would like to know what the machine is. I train them separately and I train them in one imitation exercise. Imitation at the table? Yes. Okay, yeah, that's what I am saying. When you say imitation, you don't mean still lifting, you mean the table.
SPEAKER_00: No, lifting with table from pulley. Oh, pulley. Oh, okay. So, it is very similar to my move, actually. So, it gives endurance. You hold the weight? You hold something, handle? Just this move.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but whenever you do the fast spin, I talk about like you do this, but I'm talking about just thinking about the deep hook match that you cannot press the guy, but the guy is also working on your bicep, like he's also, and he's, you know, pulling you with his lat and everything. But if I do 10 sets of 10 reps, it also goes for endurance, I would say.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, endurance, but in one direction, not the direction that your opponent is all the time applying, you know, because he may be putting pressure with like a dragon hook or he can transition to do something else, you know, just, yeah. I mean, the greatest armwrestler of all time, he has done table time and we know Devin does a lot of table time, but as I always say, like, there is no one way to reach to the top. There are different ways, you know, it depends on how you are programming your body, you know.
SPEAKER_02: yeah yes yeah yeah so this guy has better endurance than you you think you want because he is young i'm not sure you are not sure in fact you just said that endurance is coming with the age you said why i always said that he's recovering faster because he is young i think that he is more healthy than i maybe more healthy healthier than you yes those things
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, many, many people think that this is a mismatch. It can be, it may be, but it may not be. Because I think that Rino is smart enough to know which way. I think Rino can go three, four different ways. He can go quickly outside, he goes sideways, he does shoulder pressure, he can go deep hook.
SPEAKER_03: As far as my opinion, top rolling you is not that easy. Not an option. Not an option. You really believe what you are saying, Reno? Yes. Yes, I do. Yeah. There's just, in my opinion, there's very, very little chance for me to even crack his wrist, let alone top rolling him.
SPEAKER_03: But, yeah. I think only super heavyweights, elite super heavyweights, some of them have a chance to do that to him. Yeah, people with bigger hands definitely have an easier time cracking someone's wrist open. But, yeah, me with these small hands, I don't think I can do that. But his weights are impressive, I would say. 74 kilograms for this movement.
SPEAKER_00: is very good thanks thank you i will do badly i think you're talking about the hammer pressure yes that is not your your primary uh direction but i think it's not um rino's primary direction also
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but I have seen him often. He can just suddenly just boom outside as well. I don't remember who you ever, ever toppled in the elite level. Have you ever toppled anyone in elite level, Ivan? I'm not sure. I personally don't remember, but maybe you would know better than I do. Yeah. Not a lot, but some Russian regional level, yes.
SPEAKER_02: But that's not true for sure. Yeah, Russian regional level doesn't make you a world elite top roller for sure. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So what is the plan? People say shoulder pressure is not the right. They think that bicep to bicep is the way. You don't have to tell, of course, your game plan, but anything you want to say?
SPEAKER_03: I have a few, of course, plans. And I'm, of course, taking Ivan extremely seriously. I actually consider him to be one of my, if not the toughest opponent that I faced yet. And I definitely don't want to take him lightly or like maybe fall asleep at the start. I know he's very fast, very alert on the start. So I got to be on my top.
SPEAKER_03: top game and I gotta bring everything I got to the table and I think that the endurance um will show if we are at equal level or if someone is a bit stronger or a bit weaker um if there's a big gap uh I mean strength wise in between us two then uh like in their endurance will be really obvious
SPEAKER_03: But as we get closer to some equilibrium, then we will see definitely who will get more tired quickly or quicker. So it's going to be really interesting and I honestly can't wait. And Ivan? I think that Rino's advantage is that he is very motivated.
SPEAKER_00: And he has nothing to lose. He's too young, maybe now. And he has many years in front, I think. Well, in terms of technique, I'm not sure that Rinato throws me. But perhaps he has some chance in hook, maybe. Maybe. I don't know. We'll see. And do you think that here the speed will be very important?
SPEAKER_00: It's important. Only if he goes like Kamil with that triceps move. If he starts first, it will be difficult for me to get from that position. But I think that I'm rather quick also, so we'll start together. Yeah, I know that. I kind of think that you may be quicker.
SPEAKER_02: I mean, I really need to make your match speed 0.25 to understand what you are doing. But I know that he is also very quick. But I kind of feel, it's my opinion, I don't say any prediction who is going to win or something, but I think that Reno is the one that needs to stop you. But that's just my opinion. Yeah, I would agree.
SPEAKER_03: Yes, I think speed will be definitely a lot more important to me than to Ivan. Just so I can if I can't maybe get into some position that I would like to, to at least like get into a lock or somewhere where I can hold him a bit easier and where I can transition into something else.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, you said that his advantage is he's young and he's hungry, but his what you call advantage on the paper in reality is also your advantage that when you say he's young, it automatically also means you are more experienced, right? And when you say that he's hungry, yes, he's hungry for sure.
SPEAKER_02: Uh, but I kind of think that you are hungry as well, because first of all, uh, your team didn't compete for some years. And second of all, you majority of your career grew yourself in WAF events. Now this is like a, like something like a new beginning.
SPEAKER_00: a new career and you are at the beginning always you know like yeah am i wrong like you also feel like you have like some goals different goals now you're right all right but um um maybe in my head i know that i'm a little favorite and so it's um i have not so much motivation one training maybe i mean that way and when pulling but um
SPEAKER_02: yes I have some advantage for sure you you you would be it's not disrespect at all but after you pull in like 20 years it is normal that you know you would have like you would like to pull someone let's just say like Devon Larratt to be more motivated push your limits you know and is it correct
SPEAKER_00: Yes, but on the other hand, I'm not too sure now. I'm not sure that I'm able to win him. I'm, as you said, also feel that I'm at the beginning of this, we can call it professional armwrestling. And I'm not sure that I'm very good here yet. I mean, to me, it's a good match.
SPEAKER_00: Sorry, Katynia, what you were saying? But I'd like to pull Devon, yes, left hand. I feel that I have some chances, maybe more than others, but I need definitely to become stronger, I think. Can I ask you something? Your chance with left arm against Devon is Ireland, you're right?
SPEAKER_00: Well, I think that I have chances on both arms to force him into hook. Maybe in first round, maybe. But I think that he can stop me even in hook and win. In hook or he may after that go out? I think in first round he can stop me even in hook.
SPEAKER_00: and in from a second round he can maybe trouble me as well because he's he has much more endurance than me i think so if he stops me once uh i will not be able to continue i think because his endurance is from other level yeah he's doing a lot of table time yeah
SPEAKER_02: and uh also did a lot of table time six times a day yeah and it seemed that he had no endurance no no no no no listen there are two types of endurance you know like every round like even the sixth round somehow he didn't like finish every round he got the control ever i thought that after second round
SPEAKER_02: would lose the control he couldn't do but every round like 30 seconds 40 seconds uh jorge had the condo i i just i came here from another podcast there was devon and he also said the same thing he said that he was very very hard for him very very hard for him and he said that like he was very surprised that like he never guessed out on within the match i see like two two different endurance one is
SPEAKER_02: like pulling many matches, the endurance. And then there is another endurance within the match, the same match. Yeah, he had the endurance of pulling many rounds very effectively. He couldn't finish it. But almost every round he put Devon almost the same position, you know, like he never gassed out and then start to lose the control right away. But within the same round, yeah, that's for sure that he couldn't finish.
SPEAKER_02: maybe i don't know i don't know so that that that is that is interesting it would be very interesting if you really forced devon into hook with right arm because i don't remember when last time he was forced to hook with right arm maybe with uh what's his name i already forgot uh georgian big oh no no no no no devon devon devon went in
SPEAKER_02: Like, round one, round one, he had the full control. He got a foul. And then when Gennady went like this to him, and then because he didn't want to go out, because once he go out, Gennady was hitting him so hard, his elbow was getting out. So Devon had to go also inside with him. Yeah, they pull inside, but Devon also went inside. And Devon, if Gennady didn't tear his bicep, Devon was preparing himself for that match for inside. He was going to go directly inside with Gennady, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: yeah yeah yeah so he wasn't forced in a hook he went there willingly yeah yeah he had to because once you over pronate
SPEAKER_02: And if the guy is hitting so hard like this, like your brachioradialis is not enough, you understand? Yeah, it's not able to hold it. When Devon is doing that, he was kind of open. When you're open, you don't also have enough side pressure. Like when you are like this, it's okay, high hook. But whenever you are open arm top roll, you don't have this while the guy is coming with all shoulder and everything hitting that way. What were you saying, Ivan? Sorry. Sorry.
SPEAKER_00: No, nothing special. I was thinking about how Dejan likes triceps moves. Thinking about it. Because you said he was getting ready for hook against Gennady. But on the other hand, he pulled effectively against Jerry.
SPEAKER_02: Maybe because Jerry doesn't have so much front side pressure. It was the same way. It was the same reason. Devon said that he cannot beat Jerry with this move. He has to do like what, you know, take the center from him. Like they, John and Devon both think that, you know, when you do full top roll, full pronation,
SPEAKER_02: Like, it is very hard to bring Jerry to this side, you know. So, Ermes was very smart, he hold him low, he pressed with the bottom side of his hand, center, and then, yeah, he didn't allow him to put the shoulder behind, yeah. Let's, let's see, let's see how it will be. Gennady also coming, Levan also coming to Istanbul, and they will have stem cell therapy. Hmm. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: it becomes very popular yeah yeah it's becoming more and more popular it's rather expensive uh i talked with the doctor he said quite big amount of money who knows maybe video video for the maybe they would sponsor like world title matches winners you know like maybe all you need to do is be beat in devon oh yeah you're gonna pull that out so maybe i can talk with them
SPEAKER_02: yeah where do you have the injury you said with right arm you had right like bicep it was before uh you mean my injury yeah yeah this guy is young I don't think he is even he gets injured through three months later he's fine I don't think he has any chronic injury no no
SPEAKER_00: Fortunately, not with my left hand. My left hand is rather good. No, no, right, right, right biceps. Yes, yes, biceps problem. There is some still sometimes. Now it's all in all it is good. But sometimes I cannot train, unfortunately. Yeah, yeah. But did you just say that you cannot beat Devon? I cannot beat Devon.
SPEAKER_00: as of now as of now or never well under 115 kilograms there will be a little advantage uh also his left hand is not so good as his right hand so i think i have maybe about 50 chances to beat him left hand about 50 left hand yeah and i think less chances right hand because i i think right hand he can win uh
SPEAKER_02: He can be stronger in my move also. Inside, huh? Yes, but perhaps I will be able to also hook him. Perhaps. I'm not sure. There would be also something crazy to force him while he's going outside. Yeah. Were you surprised, Ivan, when he was all over on Gennady's bicep and Gennady just was able to...
SPEAKER_00: bring him here did you did you see that i was very surprised yes yeah he was just all over like once again that one is like this i mean you feel like it's building on your bicep i thought it was over uh everything was over for guinadi but guinadi was not thinking so when i watched that arm fight what's the say again uh i thought it was uh everything was over for guinadi uh yeah yeah
SPEAKER_00: But Gennady was not thinking so. Yeah, Gennady is different from me. You know Gennady. You also know Gennady almost for 20 years. The guy is not normal either, you know. Gennady is great. Yes, we beat him several times. I think that he beat me most times with right hand. Maybe I beat him twice or three times. And he beat me five times or six. Right hand? Yes.
SPEAKER_02: yeah but still like five threes you cannot say like this you know it's just so close you know one more match it would be four four and and irino your style is more fitting for the uh someone like you know 115 kg devon you think i have no idea which one is better for you uh stylistic not about power but like someone like even or someone like uh devon
SPEAKER_03: uh i would say probably someone like oh that's a difficult question because both of them uh i i don't have any problems with any of those styles uh but i would probably prefer devon's style over over events maybe yeah yeah
SPEAKER_03: even though Devon can get out of even that kind of situation if you don't apply enough pressure and if you don't allow him to separate you from from if he don't allow your hand to get away from your body so much then you can pin him easily but once it's outside your shoulder then it's very difficult
SPEAKER_03: So you probably choose him because he is not as fast as Ivan and you believe that you can apply everything you have, but may not be enough. Probably, yeah. But Ivan's style as well. Ivan's style doesn't bother me a lot as well. But I would probably prefer someone to go in an open top row and then straight into a hook.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah. So if Ivan's style doesn't bother you, it means that Reno is... Confident. I mean, not confident that he's going to win, but he believes that he's going to put the brake on you. And then finally, we will not see Ivan Matyshenko like three pins, total three seconds, you know, anymore. It will be a bit longer.
SPEAKER_02: a bit yeah i will at least if i don't uh win i at least uh hope to give you on some good matches and a good fight so that yeah um you know like people think that like not people everyone but just say the 60 70 of people thinks that he's gonna dominate you as he dominated like other guys in
SPEAKER_03: Do you also believe that there is a chance for you to dominate him? Maybe for one round, one or two rounds. By speed? Yeah, by speed or maybe I surprise him with some move that he didn't expect. But I know that Ivan is smart and that he will try to change something or...
SPEAKER_03: try to pull a bit at a different angle so I don't think that there's like a chance for me to dominate him but uh I think there's a chance for me to win a bit more comfortably than some people might think okay that's good that's good I like that you have the confidence I don't I don't know who's gonna win in
SPEAKER_02: as an organizer, I don't care who's gonna win. But I would love to see two competent guys there, you know, and I like that. I like to hear that from you. Because on the paper, you look underdog. And to see you that you have a game plan, you're not confused, you are. Yeah, that's good. That's good. Yeah, there is a super chat. Let me check on the PC. I don't see. So good.
SPEAKER_03: one second um okay drew navani what is reno and he wants max hammer curl ever uh that depends on the way that you lift it but max hammer curl now i didn't do any like curls when you do like a classic with a dumbbell and then you pull yeah you don't do that towards you yeah but my max was
SPEAKER_03: 75 kilos, if you are not counting the loading pin, which is like half, one and a half kilos or two kilos. Is it with a dumbbell? No, no, no, it's through a pulley. But is it single pulley or? Single, single pulley, 70. If you counted the loading pin, it would be 77 kilos, I guess. You mean like one rep? Yes, one rep and that's it.
SPEAKER_00: And you, Ivan? Well, you know, I'm a testing sportsman. Yeah. And I test when the cable is 90% 90 degrees towards the forearm. And in this position, I drew 55 kilograms maybe. Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_00: And the way Rino does, perhaps it's a bit easier, because he has not 90 degrees. He has maybe... I mean, maybe he starts that way, but while lifting, maybe he's getting a bit... He starts a bit lower. So I think in his variation, I will do 60 kilohms, maybe. 60, 65, maybe less.
SPEAKER_03: i'd like even to try even to try that it's not that i'm like uh saying that it wouldn't that he wouldn't live that many kilos but it would be really interesting to see if he would be able to lift uh like 60 or more kilos i think it would be an interesting video to see why is that why is it interesting you wouldn't expect him to do because he's no i i just think it's interesting i think we should have like a universal lift
SPEAKER_03: that everyone can do and compare each other with you know we have all this different variation at this angle but I did it with two reps I did it with three so I think we should like have one Universal lift that everyone can do uh for us to like compare each other strength wise um and that I think that would be pretty cool and it would be easier to like rank people um in the long run I think by strength
SPEAKER_00: I think we should focus on winning at the table. Yeah, of course. But this would be an interesting way to see where people are strength-wise. Yes. I wonder what would take. What do you say, Ivan? About this move, about Hemical, I think the best variant is with free weight to raise weight.
SPEAKER_00: with your forum parallel to the to the ground so something like what Hermes did and something like maybe Devon but without yes but it was not 90 degrees it was not parallel to the ground the forum was a little higher and if you do it strictly parallel it would be right thing i think interesting
SPEAKER_02: Yeah. SG Records Roman says, Reno is 18 years old. He is stem cell himself. So both of those things are wrong. I'm not 18 and I don't use stem cells.
SPEAKER_02: No, no, no. He doesn't say you are using stem cells. He said that you are so young that you don't need stem cells. Your cells are so young. In fact, we all have stem cells, but mine is 49 years old. Yours is 19 years old. I don't know about many of the lifts. I don't really believe...
SPEAKER_02: I mean, like, as long as you don't know how to translate to table, you know, I just think, like, I mean, I don't do very heavy wrist curl. I mean, whenever you put the strap, I go topple versus topple. Like, now I'm injured, but most of my kind of, not most, but almost all the time, you know, the other guys wrist wet. But the guy says he's curling 70 kilos.
SPEAKER_02: don't know if i have done more than like 45 kilo risk or you know so it's like not not really the the the same thing you know just like like you hold in the the rolling thunder and you you move in like this and just imagine yourself you are in the set with the guy set beside and you load in both loading do you really feel like it is something like you know like a rolling rolling under handle
SPEAKER_02: not at all you know has nothing to do with that one for me they're like like risks you know to handle the pressure to not to bend back is more important than his current power you know but you know yeah this thing yeah so i believe more like a coordination of the muscle groups then then then like like being like i can say that you are as strong as your weakest links you know like this is what i believe you know
SPEAKER_02: I think Ivan knows how I see the training, probably from the EnginTerzi.net years, you know. Remember I had a website, you know, I was sharing the videos. Maybe you remember, maybe you don't remember, Ivan. I remember something, but not everything. Yeah, yeah. But I think we were talking a lot about the training, you know, ideas. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: mean i do agree that coordination is important but if you don't have like strength to kind of back that up uh it's really hard to do anything so i think that uh maybe you didn't have like strong uh wrist curls uh or uh your wrist you couldn't lift that as much as some other people but other uh things like your maybe your back pressure your rising your pronation was maybe
SPEAKER_02: stronger than some of your opponents so that's why when you got into a strap you may be no no i just don't believe that whatever you live with the rolling thunder is not the same holding the guy and turning his pronator it doesn't like roll in your hand like like those those you know things you know just like yeah i agree totally different i mean it doesn't matter it's uh at least for me it doesn't matter uh so much to simulate a human hand i just want to get
SPEAKER_03: this power you know the cupping power is stronger it doesn't matter what's in my arm if like a i don't know a towel is in my arm and i'm doing this with it it's kind of the same as long as i strengthen these muscles that's kind of my my thing i mean i would suggest someone to like pull my hand like this and then me to control like those two arm it is just much better than any handle to me
SPEAKER_02: Because I can hold him, it's hitting my fingers, hitting my wrist. I can use my riser. At the same time, I can apply pressure from here because, I mean, when you are doing wrist curl, I mean, like you do wrist curl here like this. Whenever your wrist is like this, can you do your max wrist only with the descender?
SPEAKER_02: When your riser is down, can you do as heavy as wrist, like when you are like this? Probably not. Probably not. What do you say, Ivan? For sure not. For sure not. So what I'm just saying, when I say coordination, so you need to keep here high, wrist, little bit pronation, little bit this, just like the coordination, the synergy. Okay, the right word is synergy. Like you may have here...
SPEAKER_02: 10 kilo power, 10 kilo, 10 kilo, 10 kilo, 10 kilo, but you coordinate like three or four muscle groups while you have like eight, eight, eight, eight, but you are coordinating everything. And then.
SPEAKER_02: this this is my opinion that john brzing success that you know he was just like so like complete you know at the table just he could just make everything together and attack on your one point and then you would become helpless because the other muscle groups did not support the the muscle group which was attacked by everything that john created as a synergy you know this yeah
SPEAKER_02: And your training things, Ivan, like when you do the one rep, not even rep, you just press something and then you measure it. Do you use this as a training or just to measure the power? Just to measure the power and to find out what is better, what is worse for a particular sportsman. Someone has better wrist, someone has better hammer, curve, fingers.
SPEAKER_02: pronation side pressure. And a very interesting thing you said to me and to Devon, or was Devon there? I don't know. But you said school boys risk power max more than yours and Vitaly's. Is that correct? Yes. He had 97 kilograms and I had 93, my best. Vitaly's is almost about 93, yes.
SPEAKER_00: Wow, that's impressive. But he is not very good at using it. Unfortunately for him. He doesn't have coordination. Because when we pulled, he had some mistakes when using the wrist. He didn't use it, actually.
SPEAKER_00: he didn't use his his strong wrist when pulling you know and i asked him why don't you use this girl he started to use it just to call and he became much stronger and before yeah yeah before he was only going outside now yes and he didn't use it yes and uh he could be very effective if he used
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but this is what I try to say that when you do the dumbbell training, whatever training, I mean, you train, train, train, you come to table and you are not using it. So, I mean, like that is the place that you need to use it and just get, I mean, like transfer that power that is strong, but you need to do the movement at the table as well.
SPEAKER_02: Yes, but if he did it, he would be very strong. And I think he will be very strong. Yeah, he's getting stronger. Yeah, he's getting stronger, for sure. Paul Italia Cigar. Who are Reno and Ivan's favorite top three armwrestlers? I believe that Ivan will say one of them, John, but who knows? Let's see. I'll let Ivan start first. Well, for sure, that's John. And it's difficult to...
SPEAKER_00: to say after him um maybe because there are quite many after him there is john and john is here yes there are more than two yes and there are more than two other yeah yeah reno like ewan is one of those guys even i started even earlier when john in his prime when he was going stage
SPEAKER_03: we were looking at him like Ellie, you know? Yeah, yeah. I mean, once John is up there, the whole venue was just like watching him, you know? Am I right? Yeah. Yeah. And you, Reno? I won't rank them first to last. I mean, I'm only mentioning three of them, but they're all equally favorite of mine.
SPEAKER_03: So one is Arsene Liliev for sure. I enjoy watching his matches so much. It's super entertaining and fast and it's incredible how he managed to beat so many guys using that kind of open hand technique without using his shoulder as much, only relying on his bicep and kind of back pressure. Then I would say Andrei Pushkar.
SPEAKER_03: for sure he's a great legend and unfortunately he passed too too early and I would say John and Devin are kind of in as well I know I'm only supposed to name three but they're kind of on the same level for me um
SPEAKER_02: There is another Superboy is asking what Ivan thinks of Denis now compared to past. Like 10 years ago just say 2013 Denis compared to today's Denis. I think all in all he is maybe
SPEAKER_02: 80 percent of brem dennis the other day i was i was talking with uh krasimir about this and krasimir is saying that now he's better than before and i was saying no and then because he was saying that he and you had like a long left arm match you know in training and i said that like dennis was a little bit different when he's competing in the training correct
SPEAKER_00: You're right, but maybe that was my peak. I was very good then. Maybe just that day. I also was very good. Do you believe that on that day you would give the same trouble to fresh Denis at the Zloty Tur? Maybe.
SPEAKER_00: No, no, no, no. Of course, Denis didn't start. He just caught me. If he started first, he would maybe beat me quicker, maybe. But you believe that his shape in that training and his Zloty shape, general or A1 shape or Lotoshina shape, whatever, was the same shape, you think? No, no, it was not the same, for sure. Okay, this is what I do. Yes.
SPEAKER_02: but maybe not too much he was also not weak then when we pulled no no he was strong i can see that he was big but just he was just becoming a little bit stronger you know yeah i i i talked with uh arsene i think 2013 arsene said that he was in his best ever shape you know and he said that he hit him like he did nobody before like this and he said that like
SPEAKER_02: next day he felt like you know a bus hit him you know like he was he said everywhere was hurting you know he said that he was very strong so i don't really believe that dennis of today is the same as dennis so 10 years ago you think 80 of it uh yes i would say that uh when dennis pulled john uh it seemed that he had a better technique uh not better but in uh um more how to say
SPEAKER_00: a classic technique his angles were smaller uh he did you mean in dubai dubai he seemed to become a better arm wrestler maybe more how to say his angles became smaller and more classic technique and before that when he had very big biceps he looked rather awkward i would say with big angle and um
SPEAKER_02: But in terms of strength, for sure, he is not so strong now. Krasi is in shape. Best luck to him. Reno and Ivan on 11th. Thank you. Lux, how does Ivan see a match versus Murado, left arm?
SPEAKER_00: How I see, my match or Prudnik's match? No, no, your match against Murado. You know, I have always wanted to win the Supers at WAF. But now Alizhan won them twice. So I'd like to win him. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: But I think he is a very dangerous opponent, and maybe he's about my strength level. Maybe stronger, maybe the same. I'm not sure. He was very explosive, but now he's not so explosive. And I think that's why I have some more chances now. Because earlier he was very explosive.
SPEAKER_02: I have a question for you. Normally, people, whenever pulling you, people are just thinking how to stop Ivan, how to stop him, you know, the speed, the explosiveness. If he would be pulling Alijan, in your mind, would be flash pinning him or stopping him? Well, I thought before...
SPEAKER_00: that I would think about stopping him, because he seemed to be very fast several years ago. But now he became slower, and that's why I think that we can start together. So he will be like, ready, go, boom. Yes. But that match is 100% going inside. Nobody is going out from there.
SPEAKER_00: Yes, and his wrist is rather good. I'm not sure that I can add any toproll there. Because I can use a little toproll. Ivan, your toproll level is like regional level. Forget about toproll. I do not mean toproll. I mean a little of toproll added to my hook.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, okay, okay. I'm just teasing. I'm just joking. But listen, you kind of top-rolled Arabuli, but because he was trying to top-roll you, and then you just went out. Yes. That's what I mean. Not a basic top-roll, but a literal pronation to my move, yes. Yeah. And it looked like top-roll because he was also trying to top-roll you. So whenever you're trying to top-roll someone who uses his hand very strong, and then you kind of get your hand, you know, sometimes moves like this. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, anyway, so there is one more super chat. CZBK, yesterday I said goodbye to my dog of 18 years. It is incredibly hard saying it simply helps me feel better. I appreciate all of the arm nursing community. My friend, you're losing your dog for 18 years. You are together. I lost my cat some years ago. I didn't even want to have cat at home, but somehow it was three months old. She was, and then she ate it.
SPEAKER_02: plant she was poisoned and died like I cried like a kid you know because I couldn't protected her you know just I felt like I felt responsible yeah I don't know yeah it really yeah I feel you I feel you my friends anyways so anyways so let's let's talk about let's talk about uh one more question Reno you're right and left compared to each other
SPEAKER_03: My left hand is a bit healthier than my right hand. I have some issues with my shoulder on the right hand, but the left is really, really good. So I'm expecting to be a lot. I am a lot better in the hook on the left hand, while on the right, I do suffer a bit just because I have some pain in my tendons in the shoulders.
SPEAKER_02: so even you at this age yeah just make sure that it heals up perfectly otherwise it becomes chronic and then you won't be able to use some moments you know anymore yeah I'm sure you will you will heal up but yeah let's let's talk about uh the cards your opinions you know I'm very happy to uh
SPEAKER_02: Discuss with two very intelligent guys. Of course, one of them is much more experienced, but Reno will be coming on the same way. Okay, let's talk about Vala Içkiti versus Aydarhan. I'm sure this is this program. I like it because you guys are both full love.
SPEAKER_02: lot and then you guys are um familiar both with the east and west uh guys so i'm sure that you guys have some idea you know what i write ivan yes so i saw him at amc at uh also against samusha yeah um go outside mainly and uh i think that um
SPEAKER_02: Veliko is bigger. Ichikichi is bigger a little. Am I right? I'm not sure. I'm not sure anymore because Aydarhan said that he cannot make 75 anymore. He makes 80. So usually these guys are a little bit over the weight category that they are pulling. So I'm sure he's going to come in around 85 kilos. I have no doubt. But I think that generally Ichikichi is bigger a little. And also his chop roll maybe...
SPEAKER_00: uh more dangerous uh is is better against um his opponents top row maybe you mean it's more dangerous against the top rollers uh yes uh because i saw him against um maybe yeah he managed to to win the risk so i think i think um he has a little more chances
SPEAKER_02: While Aydarhan is also explosive, very explosive guy, yeah. He's very explosive, yes, but maybe he's better against hook pulls, maybe he's better. But I'm not sure. He was able to control Mindago's top roll, and he was in low weight, you know, they both were 7'7". And how do you see Dimash Reno?
SPEAKER_02: Unfortunately, I do not remember who they are exactly by their name. So do you have maybe a picture on your phone that you can just turn on? Aydarhan is the guy that is, you know, he won 80 kilo waffles. He is the one of the three guys that... Where is he from? Kazakhstan.
SPEAKER_02: uh oh my god it's uh a shame that i i don't uh know whenever he beat me in daggers for the world title 75 kilo um i'm i'm like almost 100 sure that and he pulled a lot with cherkasov this is ah him
SPEAKER_03: him yeah yeah yeah of course yeah yeah yeah maybe big picture you will see better yeah no no I can see him yeah thank you uh yeah I I am um more familiar with his style of pulling than his opponents uh as I remember he's quite explosive and uh he's a good top roller maybe he'll be Daniel he'll be Daniel in uh yeah
SPEAKER_03: yeah it was a very impressive uh and i do agree with uh ivan here i think he prefers uh hook pullers a lot more than someone that goes for top roll uh but i'm not sure if his opponent goes for a top roll the georgian yeah yeah yeah
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, so he might find it a bit more difficult if he can get some good hand control. And I didn't see him really do any kind of transition into a press or a hook or any kind of defensive style after he loses his wrist or just doesn't get into a position where he wants it. So I think he's definitely going to be relying a lot on the flash spinning and just getting a good hand control. And if he doesn't,
SPEAKER_02: He's going to definitely be in a lot of trouble. Yeah. And this other match is Marcio Barbosa or Petrenko, Ivan? Very interesting match. It's difficult to say who will win, actually.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe Marcio, he's cutting down to 105. He's bigger, maybe. He was bigger. No, both will be 105 kilos. Yes, they will be, but he's cutting down to 105. No, no, he said that he is like 100s.
SPEAKER_02: nine kilo i think this is what he said hundred nine hundred eight yeah for for for you maybe this is a big way to cut three four kilo i don't know anyone because i know that you don't do those kind of things but but these people like easily cut five six you know even some sometimes in last three days or something you know yeah i'm i don't think that uh myself will be able to top roll oleg
SPEAKER_00: Ah, and maybe they both pulled John, right? They both pulled John. Yeah. Well, it's difficult to say. Petrenko has great side pressure, great wrist, a good top roll. Perhaps they will pull in hook. I do not know who will win, actually. So you see a close match? Yes, I think so. But I do not think that Masi will be able to top roll Oleg. I think it will be...
SPEAKER_02: uh in hook perhaps um there is a super chat between this uh before i asked reno super boy is asking there is a training footage ivan is using his second hand to pull with dennis and still couldn't beat him was dennis that strong then is there any training footage that you used two hands uh that was in 2008 or 2007
SPEAKER_00: and we pulled uh and it was just a training uh session and uh maybe i used it just to train dennis uh and dennis was getting ready maybe for uh zloty first zloty maybe uh so it was not it was not a pull but uh in those days dennis was stronger than me for sure yeah yeah
SPEAKER_02: Is there any days that he wasn't stronger than you? Well, I beat him in 2005. Oh, you mean earlier. Okay, okay. It sounded like, you know, because it's like the beginning of Dennis, 2008, like when he was coming back. You're talking about the junior category? No, it was first I beat him in the Open...
SPEAKER_00: weight class in Moscow. I remember those videos. I think you never seen the first match I beat him because I
SPEAKER_00: I didn't see it myself. But two months later, he wanted a rematch. He wanted revenge. And we met at another competition, and there he had one win, and I beat him twice. He was maybe 125. I was about 90. And that was... Yes, I was also fast. It was...
SPEAKER_00: he didn't manage to start yeah yeah yeah you want very quick answer i want prime levan prime dennis well i i would i would say dennis because he's he's he's a russian um
SPEAKER_00: And frankly speaking, I'm not sure, frankly speaking, I think that perhaps after, especially after match of Levan against Hermes, I think that Denis in his prime could stop him with his open hand stop roll, so to say. And I thought so.
SPEAKER_02: But I'm not sure, actually. I think that it is about 50-50, something like that. And this 50-50 doesn't have anything to do with you being from the same country? This one is an objective one? Yes, 50-50 is objective, yes. Okay, Rino, Marci or Petrenko?
SPEAKER_03: I don't know. I think Petrenko has an upper hand here just because he's a bit younger. And I remember saying that as well when Oleg was about to pull John and then he lost. But I don't know. Oleg seems to be a bit uncoordinated on the table. In my opinion, he seems to be going only for strength while Mario Barbosa is a bit better.
SPEAKER_03: And I think he has a bit of a better technique than Oleg. But it's going to be interesting to see who's going to win. I don't think it's going to go into a top role. I mean, I don't think Barboza is going to be able to top role Petrenko. It's going to go inside and then it's going to be a game of endurance and power. Okay, so who is winning?
SPEAKER_02: um from in my opinion i think oleg is winning okay and even um robbie toppy versus americ predines or pradines i don't know how to pronounce i haven't seen uh robbie but i saw some matches uh with america
SPEAKER_00: perhaps against Krasimir. It was several years ago and he beat Krasimir. It was a close match, yes. And that's why I think that Emeric is the favorite. And do you know Robby Toppy, Reno? No, no, I don't. But I do know Emeric. Or how do you pronounce his name? I don't really know.
SPEAKER_03: uh and i i fought against him on the left hand uh on this year's european europeans yeah you were first place you were thinking yeah yeah yeah uh he was quite good in the qualifications i saw that he didn't really have too much issues with anyone and he definitely is uh strong and because i don't know
SPEAKER_00: his opponent very well i'm going to say that it's hard to compare yeah let's let's go to very interesting match inactive versus paul ivan paul is uh has very good side pressure and he showed himself great against sasha
SPEAKER_00: and from that day i took i take him very seriously yeah yeah yeah he is because nice guy people doesn't think he's real deal but he's just very dangerous guy he's very yes but um also i do not think that he is uh he has such such pressure as todd hawkins uh to to win iraqi without risk and i think that uh iraqi
SPEAKER_00: has more chances to win uh the wrist to top row how do you know that paul is gonna lose his wrists uh um well just um just uh yes yes yes yes yes um maybe because uh iraqli is more experienced anyway paul seems to be very strong and his wrist is is also good
SPEAKER_00: uh but maybe he is a bit slow maybe a bit slow maybe no no not so quick maybe no very very very explosive guy very okay sorry yeah very explosive i just remember sasho just twice he caught him on the pad
SPEAKER_00: the third one he just lifted him up like maybe this much i think if i'm not mistaken like sasho lost the century like he was right here with the goal you know and i don't know um maybe you're right maybe you're right i don't know i don't know but uh yes we'll see um but uh yeah maybe some more chances for raquel because he's more experienced uh perhaps he's not strong stronger but he's more experienced
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, when we say like strong, you know, you saw that the 150 kilo, Scott Bicep Curl, that he reacted it. I think it's 140. I mean, I didn't see the 150. No, there are two, in the same video, there are two lifts. The first one was 140 with three reps and the 150, two reps. Oh my God. I think that Georgians, Georgians,
SPEAKER_00: like big waves too much. It's rather dangerous for them. They do those waves and sometimes they have injuries. And you, Reno? I think that Irakli has an upper hand on Paul just because I think that
SPEAKER_03: Irakli prefers pullers like Paul in when they go like pure side pressure or if they're going in for a hook. I think that Irakli's defensive top roll is very, very good at taking his opponent's wrist. And if Paul doesn't have a flop wrist press or something like that,
SPEAKER_03: in his arsenal, I think he's going to have a lot of trouble trying to beat Irakli. But again, Paul is really, really strong and has shown multiple times that he's someone that should not be taken lightly. Yeah, yeah. And it can go either ways, really. But in my opinion, right now, I think that Irakli will win. But...
SPEAKER_02: It doesn't need to be a clean sweep. It will probably be like 3-2 or something like that. I understand. Okay. Matt Mask versus Wagner Bortolato, right arm. Oh, my God. Right arm. Will the stage or the table survive? We will see. I'm seriously... I'm not joking. I will have some extra table there. I'm not afraid of Matt Mask. Matt Mask only slaps. You know?
SPEAKER_03: You have to have insurance for every referee and everything, so they don't get absolutely destroyed. Okay, what is your opinion? You start first, you know, this time. Right hand, just remember, it's right hand. Yeah. Okay, okay. It's difficult to say, if I'm not mistaken, Bortolato pulled Farid on the left hand, right? Yeah. Yeah, and he was really impressive.
SPEAKER_03: But I don't know. You know, Matt has been on a losing streak lately, and it's difficult to vote for him, especially when he kind of lost so many matches that I thought that he might actually... One before he beat Rambeth at King of Zebu. Yeah, yeah. But I don't know. I think that... Oof.
SPEAKER_03: I think that Bortolato has an upper hand here and I think he's going to win. I saw Matt trying to flop his press Frank Lamparelli and that was the most awkward thing that I watched in my life and I think that he's just not meant for that because he has such a long lever and has a huge hand. But I think that exactly because
SPEAKER_02: but a lot that can pull without his wrist and he can go into a press that's going to be a big problem for matt yeah taking his wrist may not be like the hardest thing but to bring him this side matushenko is one of the probably the most experienced guys about wagner how many times did you pull i think you guys were in the same category 110 for some time or not or you were 100 kilo um when he was the champion um in the 110 i was in 100 years
SPEAKER_00: so we pulled only once in Kazakhstan and only right hand perhaps 2011 and perhaps i won perhaps i won quickly with right hand but we didn't pull left hand i don't know why actually i don't know why i have a question would you pull him left arm anyone
SPEAKER_02: I'd like to, but my great priority is the title. I'm just thinking that this guy was winning 110kg category when he weighed 110kg. Now he's 150kg. Do you feel like someone going inside you? And do you feel like you have a chance to win? I think I have chances.
SPEAKER_00: He's very dangerous. And if we were under one weight, I think I would have more chances. But now when he's much bigger and he gave troubles to Georgy Dzhiranov. And I think that Georgy now is stronger than me when he became bigger.
SPEAKER_00: and he was also big so it would be difficult for me but perhaps i would try uh because uh can you imagine yourself can you imagine yourself he's putting his body on your bicep and you're lifting up from there or your chest
SPEAKER_02: would try to be quicker than him and true yeah yes uh i think i will not be able to hold him i'm sure he's too dangerous yeah you would probably feel like a skyscraper fell on your forearm and then after after that an earthquake hits and then everything destroys yeah um artentino versus
SPEAKER_02: Hmm. Left arm, 95 kilo world title. Interesting thing, Ali Canmurado and Prudnik, I think, if I'm not mistaken, they both said that Zurab is going to win. While Taino beats Sasho. And he looks in very good shape. And also Zurab looks very strong and hungry as well, you know. Yeah. I don't know in what shape Zurab is right now. And I do know that when he injured his right arm,
SPEAKER_03: at the amc tournament uh i think he definitely focused more on his left hand but i don't know if that uh has any significance you know he might be five percent stronger or something else even though that is a like a big step up even if it's such a low percentage but i don't know if it's going to be enough to beat uh you know tyne of uh he just if i if i remember correctly he goes for top roll and he can actually go
SPEAKER_03: in a hook as well and he's quite versatile and last time that we saw Zura pulling on the left was with Oleg and he got absolutely destroyed but of course it's a different weight class and everything I don't know I would say Tainov is my vote here I have more confidence in Tainov and you Ivan? I agree with Rino I think the same
SPEAKER_00: maybe especially last month we saw Artyom in great shape especially against Sasha and I remember Zurab losing to Alizhan right but it was maybe Petrenko Petrenko he was injured he shouldn't have pulled Petrenko Petrenko yes
SPEAKER_00: It was long ago, yes? Yes, perhaps he is much better now, and the only thing... I'm not sure that Artem has recovered after Sashon, because he had some minor problems in the last rounds, if you remember. There was something... Maybe he didn't get injured, but something wrong. There was something wrong, and that was because he didn't... Well...
SPEAKER_02: All in all, I think that Artem has more chances, and especially because he is more versatile. If he is not successful in hook, he will try to toproll him. Even after toproll, he has even the shoulder pressure. Yeah, let's see how it will be. I don't know. SG Records says, my donation for referees insurance.
SPEAKER_02: on Wagner's mask. Yeah, he did a two euros super chat for the insurance of the referees. Yeah. And let's go quickly, Oleg Zok versus Tutberidze.
SPEAKER_03: Don't tell me you don't know Tutberidze, you pull... No, no, no, I know, I know him. Oh, that's the guy that you trained with at the European side table, but looks like you didn't... No, we didn't train, we didn't train. I just tried to pull with him a little bit. But he is strong, definitely. Though they're pulling left hand, right? Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: It's difficult to see him dominating this match. But I definitely have seen Oleg suffer when somebody gets into a good position where they can hold him. He does get tired out quite easily. And he kind of stays a bit too open, in my opinion, on the table. Are you talking about Jorginho or Oleg? Oleg, Oleg.
SPEAKER_03: oleg is getting tired quickly you're saying uh yes yes and i think when uh someone gets a stop on oleg against the other cousin that was going deep hook to beresley is a top roller yeah
SPEAKER_03: And I think that if I think that when Oleg gets stopped, he goes for the pin too urgently and he kind of seems a bit scared that he won't kind of win. And then he tires himself out and puts him puts himself in bad positions, even though he does sometimes pull it off. But I don't know about I forgot his name, his opponent. Can you remind me, please?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, he goes for a top role. I don't know how that will work out for him. But if he goes inside and quite deep inside, like in a deep hook, and if he starts earlier than Jacques, he will definitely have a better chance of winning. Ivan, it is like 11.15 over there. Are you very late? No, sorry.
SPEAKER_00: Well, I have some minutes. Oh, okay, okay. So I want to, yeah. Oleg versus Tutberidze. Do you know Tutberidze, Ivan? Well, I saw a couple of matches. He is a top roller, also a low-hand top roller, I think. Yeah, he won the Waffles in 85, Oleg won in 80. The only person I remember that stopped Oleg with a low-hand top roller was Plamen Dimitrov.
SPEAKER_00: Yes, and that was the only time. All other matches Oleg lost was against Kukpuls. Well, I'm not sure that this guy will be able to topple Oleg. I think Oleg would win, but it depends on their shape. And Daniel Prokopchik versus Mindagas?
SPEAKER_03: I shouldn't say only Mindaugas, the greatest armwrestler ever. I say because he said that he mastered armwrestling and everything. Of course, he's an incredible puller. I'm just joking. It's on the right hand? Right hand, yeah. My God. It's honestly hard for me to say. I don't know Mindaugas that well. I don't know how strong he actually is. Daniel is super impressive with all of his weights and the way he can hold and pull people.
SPEAKER_00: but i don't know um i i have daniel as my favorite uh i have uh my vote for daniel i think he's going to win yeah and you iwan i also vote for daniel maybe because i saw him last time i saw him maybe at your event against samusha was it
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, he pulled many people in my event, but he pulled also some shit. Last time, and he managed to top roll effectively. Round one, yeah. Yes, and I think that with this move, he's the favorite, maybe against his opponent, maybe. If Daniel goes outside, Indagos will probably beat him.
SPEAKER_02: Daniel, one time when he tried to topple Mindagas, it was 2021 Europeans and Mindagas just flash pinned him, but there was a foul in the restart. He didn't do the same thing. He went inside. No chance in the top row.
SPEAKER_02: no no i mean if daniel goes outside fresh round beats mindagas with top row i will be very surprised i'm telling you one time he tried to do that he got flash pinned by mindagas but there was a foul restart he didn't do the same thing he went inside usually either he barely hooks him or he goes like this i mean uh not top row but a side pressure with a little top row uh high side pressure i i guarantee you will lose his wrist
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, it's difficult to keep your wrist with Mindaugas, especially the way he pulls. He keeps loading his back pressure at the very beginning. He starts a bit slower as well. I think it all depends on how Daniel starts. And if he starts earlier and if he gets into a better position, he's definitely going to have an easier time with Mindaugas. I also saw several times that Daniel...
SPEAKER_02: pulled him with the bench with the cooperation yes most of the times it goes that way most of the time like if they pull 100 times they didn't pull on the time but just say if they pull 20 times i can say this 17 times 18 times daniel probably lost his wrist but eventually he won most of the times here uh but how do you think is the best uh way to win uh mindagos
SPEAKER_00: If you're asking me, it's like this. I can show you the video. I also think that with such kind of top roller, you better top roll a little. Maybe not. I think if someone would ask me, I think the flopper is pressed would be like ideal. Yeah, if you ask me, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: I mean, you wouldn't need flop wrist against Mindagos. You are much heavier than him. But if you were 75 kilos, you sure would need it. Yeah, yeah. And it's all how you set up. If you put your hand on his hand and you don't touch his wrist and you go into a flop wrist press, it's a lot easier to press someone like that than if you are holding him like this, this low. It's a lot more difficult to flop wrist press here than here.
SPEAKER_02: Were you in the Swiss Open event? Yeah, yeah. Did you compete? Yes, with my left hand only. Okay, but do you remember Vladimir Mairov? Oh my god, no, I can't remember people by their names. 85kg winner, they say that maybe he beat Sandrić in the overalls, maybe, 85kg guy.
SPEAKER_03: Maybe if you have a picture, I could remember him. But overalls on the right hand or left? Left? No, no, no. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I remember him. I don't remember beating Sandris, but it was really close when he strapped up with Kaliczenko. Yes, and it was really close when they started.
SPEAKER_03: slowly so they they like talked in the setup and they said okay we'll start slowly and then he was actually able to stop sergey like really close to the pin and so he had a hard time you know pinning him really really was difficult but if it's a normal ready go of course of course still you know you're talking about so impressive he's crazy strong there was 2018 moldova events and in this event he took first place second was
SPEAKER_02: Fourth was Krasovskis and fifth was Irakli Zirakashvili. This guy won first. He's a very strong guy. And Ivan probably knows him well because they were in the same team. I think he is originally from Russia, but now representing Germany. Ivan, what do you say? Does he have a chance against Samusha? If he's in his best shape, I agree with you that it can be one of the most difficult matches for Samusha.
SPEAKER_00: Because Vladimir perhaps had maybe the best side pressure in this category. Not the best wrist, but very, very good side pressure. With hook and side pressure, yes.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but since Samusha is not like pure top roller, since most likely it will not be a problem then to go inside. Samusha will have a hard time with him for sure. For sure. I mean, I pulled with him on the left hand and I think his left is not as good as his right hand. But I kind of didn't feel him at all just because I think I was just faster. But watching him...
SPEAKER_03: uh literally run through some of the heavyweights uh at that event at swiss open was uh absolutely insane i couldn't believe it he took your attention right he took your attention
SPEAKER_02: of course yeah he beat imagine it was the beginning of the november i think november 2nd so he had november he had december and now january 20th so after that he had 80 more days because he is coming back you understand he didn't go for some years so i think that he will be he has huge potential if he continues on this path he's super strong for someone his size and weight i i couldn't believe it honestly
SPEAKER_03: There's no other way to describe it. It's incredible.
SPEAKER_02: Endurance. He has great endurance as well. Very good endurance, yeah. He has very good endurance, yeah. But that's why I'm saying that Samusha is also incredible about endurance. Samusha is not a super explosive guy. So it means that the match will just boom. It will stop. And they both have incredible endurance. I think we are going to see an unforgettable match. This is my opinion. Especially now when there's like, you've got to win four rounds if I'm not mistaken. Yeah, title matches, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: oh my god it's going to be a war a war yeah yeah let's see let's see the other one um we go to the next one this one i only asked for the uh the winner uh prediction i want i don't want any detail just say i already know the match okay just give me the answer it's my my match with ivan our man i said give me the answer i'm not asking you
SPEAKER_03: okay uh the prediction is only the winner right then i gotta say me i'm the winner and you ivan is it what is it well perhaps um perhaps i have a little more chances okay okay even it's too humble even it's too humble
SPEAKER_02: i don't know how do you know you think that you're gonna win so if he says that he has more a little bit more chance so it's no no but but he's like he's not like oh i'm i'm gonna win definitely this kid has no chance against me you know he's way too humble you can't maybe maybe it's not humble maybe he's realistic who knows yeah it could be yeah yeah
SPEAKER_02: um john bersing versus krasimir costadino this this is something that uh ivan probably has very good opinion it's like many years he pulled with krasimir many years i think you competed 95 kilo with john um only once i pulled him in 2007 at zloty uh 95 and he beat me easily with right hand
SPEAKER_00: I started first, but no one noticed that. But left hand, I beat Gennady, and Gennady beat John, then I beat Gennady, and after that John beat me and Gennady. Oh, left arm. Wow. Yes. Well, I think that perhaps John is a little favorite.
SPEAKER_00: uh and um only because uh i think uh krasimir is not in his best shape uh in recent uh year maybe not not his best version uh so i think that um john has a little more chances and how you see this you know i agree with ivan i think uh john has uh the upper hand here um just because
SPEAKER_03: As Ivan said, Krasimir is not in his best shape and I think that Krasimir doesn't really like when a lot of pressure is put on his wrist. And I think that if he doesn't have something like a press or something in his arsenal,
SPEAKER_03: which I've never seen Krasimir press or Flopris press, so I don't think he's going to do it now. I think he's going to have a hard time. He hit Flopris Alex Kordesha in a Supermaster page. He beat him. Oh, yeah, yeah, I remember that. Okay, yeah. But that's an exception. But I think that John is going to win, yeah. I understand, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: anyway so guys quickly i will just say and then we go to the last three matches guys now uh yearly subscription is available normally one event is 20.99 and four events is 79.96 almost 80 with the yearly subscription 69.99 you can become yearly member of the east versus west and this match is incredible match the one that i'm just gonna say like like
SPEAKER_00: Evgeny Prodigy versus Ali Canmurado, which is like 105 kilos. Were you surprised when he beat Darikyan, Ivan? When Prodigy beat him? Not really, because I saw them pulling after East-West maybe, and that was almost the same. It was almost the same, and it was difficult for David to finish him.
SPEAKER_00: So he also held him there. And also, I know that David had an injury after Morozov. So it was not... I thought that something like that could happen, yes. And how do you see this match? I think that... No, it's Ivan's turn, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: well it's unpredictable for me i think that moratov is like david in terms of strength and speed but he's healthy perhaps but on the other hand prudnik says that he has improved he has become better and he's sure so so
SPEAKER_02: I don't know. It will be a great match, I think. But Evil Four should go inside, right? Yes, I think it will be inside, for sure. Because Alijan Drist seems to be very strong. Alijan forced Cody Merritt inside. And Cody Merritt, you know, he also played well. He's very strong and incredible. I don't know. And how do you see the ring? I think Prudnik might...
SPEAKER_03: a bit more trouble with uh muratov than he had with the dikian i think that muratov is more explosive maybe not at the start uh but after they get into a hook we're not just kind of weights and then starts hitting yeah yeah back into his position waits a little bit and then again and i think that prudik is going to find that uh really uncomfortable
SPEAKER_03: And especially if he's left at that position where he was with Adikian, like inches or like centimeters from the pad, and then Muratov hits, I don't think we could stop that as easily as he did with Adikian. Adikian was way slower during the match. So I think that Muratov will win. But it's, again, four rounds. Yeah, it's a title match, right? Yeah. Yeah, so...
SPEAKER_03: uh predicts endurance might be a bit better I don't know I don't honestly know how uh Muratov is with his endurance but um yeah I think Muratov will win okay let's go to the daddy camera to start touching smash Ivan I'm very curious about your opinion about this match well last time I thought that uh now I
SPEAKER_00: I think that Todd is perhaps the best athlete under 105 right now. The Deccan obviously has chances because he is very explosive and he beat Irakli quickly with a good top roll. And I think that it is possible for him to beat Todd. But after Angarbaev, I think that Todd is the favorite.
SPEAKER_02: I understand. Yeah. Do you, do you agree that it is almost like in my opinion, at least I should say it is impossible to be Tatachins, to be in the same weight with him and not controlling his pronator. If you cannot control his pronator, if he has the pronator, I mean, he will, he will, I mean, hit you. I don't think that you can hold anything, you know, you really like, like, do you remember how, how Prudnik beat him? Prudnik had the full,
SPEAKER_02: like wrist and cupping not like pronating because you think that you're taking Todd's wrist but you're pronating when you're pronating you are not controlling here you are all pronating out and you're missing here so I kind of believe that you need to make Todd's palm like a little bit like this way so that he cannot hit you so hard once he has that pronated here
SPEAKER_02: is incredible i don't think that anyone has the same genetic to fight with him with the side pressure but what's your opinion i don't know you're meeting different and i respect you if you think different no i agree with you so is is you as a hook puller you think you have more chances because you are directly hitting his pronators with your wrists
SPEAKER_02: Not sure, not sure, but maybe, yes. Because Todd also has strong biceps, where he held Sagov. You know, it was like, you were there, right? Yes. I mean, he went first and he got a foul, but did he realize or not, when Sagov was pressing down like this, like this, and instead of pulling himself,
SPEAKER_02: What I saw, Todd just even made his forearm forward and then made his arm even more vertical, and then the press didn't really work. You understand? He even, like, you know that he's an engineer, right? Todd Hashing is an engineer, and he is a very smart guy. The only disadvantage he has, he just started arm wrestling way too late, after 35. The motor ability, you know, like after 35, you cannot be like, you know, this smooth. He's not smooth at all, you know.
SPEAKER_02: But he is very smart. I mean, he's doing something that, you know, people are not used to. You know, it looks like you're going to beat him. You can't. Also, his genetics is very good. What do you think? I agree with you. His genetics is, I think, first, it's genetics. Because as far as I remember, he beat John two or three years after he started.
SPEAKER_02: do you remember that he beat him um i remember john john was pulling two weight category 90 and super so when when john was pulling todd was playing one match in the 90 kilo john was playing one there and one super heavy weight one there one super weight and i think john pulled put him to the b side i think in the final he beat him twice as far as i remember i may be mistaken but i was there in vegas but it was on the
SPEAKER_02: Two or three years that Todd trained, maybe. Maybe five years. Because the first time I saw Todd was in 2001. So if he was pulling in 2001, probably if he's pulling professional category. He wasn't professional, but professional category. So just say he started in 2000. And John Mesh was in 2005 Vegas. So it was like five years. But it was impressive, yes. Yes, he was. Well, he's great.
SPEAKER_00: Would you pull him? Yes, but not under 105. It is not a title match. He won, let's meet at 110 kilos. Would you pull him? If my right is good, I'll try to. I think I have some chances. It will be very difficult for me. It won't be easy, I think.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, but your speed or using your wrist? Only my speed, yes, can help me. Because we know that he used to lose with quick pulls. Yeah. But unfortunately, for quick pulls, now he's not losing. Yeah, yeah. He's using pronators. In the past, he was only diving in like this. And while he's reaching there, Rustam was already beating him. While he's diving there, Arsene was already beating him, you know?
SPEAKER_03: And yeah, I remember him. And how do you see this match? I think that it's going to be difficult for Dadikian for sure. Even though Dadikian is really impressive with his right hand, I think his right hand is stronger than his left. And I think it's going to be a war, but I think that...
SPEAKER_03: uh Todd definitely has a like better endurance than him and the way he is pulling uh makes it so he gets less tired uh during the match and I think he can hold there for like five days without getting tired uh while the dickian relies more on his muscles where Todd relies more on some kind of bone lock and some genetic stuff that nobody else has so I think that Todd will win
SPEAKER_02: So you are saying that if the match is going to be a war, so it's hard to win that against. Ivan, did you tell me that Brudnik told you that if there was one extra round against Tatasins that he couldn't win? Are you the one that told me? Somebody told me this.
SPEAKER_02: Somebody told me, somebody said that, you know, I don't know. I'm going to ask that to Prudnik because it didn't seem to me that way because it seemed to me that Prudnik could win like if it was six, seven rounds. But somebody told me that Prudnik told him that if there was one extra round against Hutchings, he could win. He was done, you know, after the third win. It didn't seem to me that way, but I will ask that to Prudnik. The last match, Morozov versus Kurdesha.
SPEAKER_03: I think that Morozov has the upper hand here just because he's more versatile. And it's on the left hand or the right hand? What's that? It's on the right or the left hand? The match? Yeah. Reno. Come on. You compete in an event. You don't know what the main event is, left arm or right arm. Come on. Okay, okay. Left arm.
SPEAKER_03: It's left arm. Okay. I just wanted to make sure. I think that Morozov is going to win this. Just because he's way more versatile and stronger on the left hand. And the way that he handled Corey West was just incredible. Even though the only similarity that I see between Corey and Kordecza is the size of his hand.
SPEAKER_02: But still, I think that Morozov will win this. The first time, I think Alex is probably around 165 kilos or something. Because he told me that he has a scale to 160. Now, whenever he's on it, he shows error. But he's not fat at all. And how do you see that, Ivan? This is the last match.
SPEAKER_00: Actually, I do not remember any matches with Kurdech left hand. Who did he pull? Do you remember left hand? I remember him right hand, but not left hand. Yeah, but he said left hand is better than his right. I know that Kurdech is very good against hookers when he pulled Armes, but he's not very good against hookers, maybe.
SPEAKER_00: Angarbaev beat him with some side... Dead wrist. With dead wrist and Krasimir. And maybe... I didn't like Morozov last time. He was obviously not in his best form. He was only 120 maybe. If he's really good now, like when he pulled everyone else on left hand,
SPEAKER_02: Well, I think it will be a good match. I'm not sure who will win. Because Kurdeche is very dangerous for top-rollers. I'm not sure that Morozov will be able to top-roll Kurdeche. Yeah, see, Richard Gamrat, he said that Kurdeche pulled Ryan Espin's left arm at the arm wars and beat him. Ryan, uh-huh. Ryan, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Top roller, yeah, Ryan is a top roller. I pulled once Ryan, right hand. He managed to top roll me a little, but with fouls. And I had a win. Against Kurdecha? No, I pulled Ryan. Oh, Ryan, okay. I had a win, but he was, I think, better that day.
SPEAKER_02: uh well i don't know i think that morozov has chance of beating kurdecha in cook but not in top row oh yeah i kind of agree that i agree and before we finish the last one i'm gonna ask uh who is winning next time lemon or devil ah that's a difficult question uh i would say uh i would say levon
SPEAKER_00: And you, Ivan? If Levan gets his 100%, I would bet on Levan. Uh-huh. No, it was right-arm match. Say again, Ivan? If Levan is 100%, I think Levan is the favorite. But if he is 90%, I think that there will be
SPEAKER_00: that it will be very difficult for him. They are rather close now. Do you see anyone else beating Devon? Laletin, I think. After his match with Hermes, you would think that Laletin would beat Devon? Perhaps, yes.
SPEAKER_00: But I think that Laletin has to pull more seldom. He has to prepare for several months. Okay, I understand. Because now he doesn't look healthy enough. And if Gennady and Devon both are healthy, this time, who do you think would win? Again, Gennady or Devon? 50-50? I was with
SPEAKER_03: I don't know. I think Devin wouldn't take him as lightly as he did the first time, and I think he wouldn't mess around as much. I think Devin would be a lot more serious, and he would go for quicker wins and less showboating, let's say. Perhaps Devin has more weapons.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but isn't it interesting that Ivan, like till recent time that like we thought that like Devon didn't pull against Eastern Europeans, this and that, and now looks like except Levan, you know, he has beaten everyone except a few guys like Laletin or something.
SPEAKER_00: So do you think that Devon is in his best time right now, Ivan? Yes, he has improved greatly. I do not see him in him. Now that Devon, well, several years ago, he had some problems with wrist. He was small. He was much smaller. He was 105, 110. Now it's another years, another effort.
SPEAKER_02: uh that's interesting that you know at some point you know uh yogi took his wrist but he couldn't finish him you know that was interesting yeah you saw that right like some point like his wrist was like this there was this but he was able to recover from that point anyways guys three weeks later exactly three weeks later i see you guys and
SPEAKER_02: You both are great pullers. Of course, Ivan, you are a legend, no doubt. And whenever I ask Reno, like, what do you think?
SPEAKER_02: And Reno said, let me think, you know. And I said, you cannot become a legend without beating legends. Let me come back and say, I'm going to pull him, you know. Yeah, yeah. That's what Moro did in me. Yeah, yeah. I know how to touch you. Don't worry about it. That's why I brought Arsene here. And then Arsene just saw the atmosphere and Arsene is now training, you know, yeah. Because we all speak the same language. The only thing that I have been speaking this arm wrestling language a little bit longer than you guys. And...
SPEAKER_02: i know where to touch and i'm happy that you accept it so we will see we will see if the birth of a legend or the legend continues his new career professional career to the next level we will see thank you guys for coming and being my guest thank you for inviting me sorry that it took long very long but whenever i find
SPEAKER_02: Two people like to talk about arm wrestling. It is very hard to stop. So thank you again and see you very soon. See you again. Bye. Bye, Ivan. Bye, Ivan. And thank you guys for watching. And you all take care.
