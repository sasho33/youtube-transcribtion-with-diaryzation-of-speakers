SPEAKER_04: The language.
SPEAKER_01: Hello, hello, hello, everyone. Today, we will have two of the elite welterweights as our guests. Nurdalet Aydarhan and Vala IÃ§kiti. Nurdalet Aydarhan is the WAF World Champion currently.
SPEAKER_01: it was a little bit questionable final but and then he had a tough match with Samusha but lost 3-2 in the world title match hello Robin hello Nathan hello my friend
SPEAKER_01: Guests will come in nine minutes. Hello, that's Sony. Thank you. I'm fine. I hope you are fine as well. MRX. Hello, my friends.
SPEAKER_01: Things sound positive. Hello. Hello, my friends. Hello. Hello to Macedonia. Mind muscle. Yes. I'm thankful to be here. Mind muscle says, good to see you, Engin. Good to see you here as well. Igor Chang. I saw in a video that Morozov asked why he doesn't have a belt. I explained to him and he apologized me.
SPEAKER_01: You know, hello Terzi, how are you, training? I mean, not so regularly because of the East versus West, but I'm doing my best. Yeah, I heard about the video too, Igor. You know, when you make a change, when you say from now on, King of the Table matches will also affect
SPEAKER_01: rankings then the thing starts from that point to the forwards it doesn't work from this point to the past you know every every rule when you when you say that like any sleep is strapped and then you don't go six months ago a match and you say you don't you cancel that and you say okay like
SPEAKER_01: losing position but we changed the rule so you guys need to go back and then compete again so a rule change is effective from the point that is decided to the forward not not to the past you know so it is one of the biggest nonsense i ever heard and i explained to morozov and he said oh i understand i apologize i'm sorry you know and then so we will go forwards
SPEAKER_01: Thomas Papachvili. I don't know what that means, my friend, but hello to you. Looking forward to the incredible matches you have put together. It will be great, hopefully. Joseph Vela. Hello, my friend. Hello. Everything will be fine, hopefully. And
SPEAKER_01: Yep. When were you in the strongest shape in which year? Pound for pound, probably late 90s, pound for pound. My strongest ever shape? I don't know. If somehow this...
SPEAKER_01: stem cell you know i feel already positive effects of the stem cell but if somehow i become like pain free and my elbow joint is stronger as it used to be you know then then my best
SPEAKER_01: Hello, Roman. Look, look.
SPEAKER_01: know so i really need to make it effective so that it can mean something you know yeah look is good yeah yep the forum is here
SPEAKER_01: Good. In fact, you know, when I started arm wrestling, it was like very small. But then with time, it just became big. Okay, who's coming? I think it's Wala. Hello, Wala. How are you, my friend? Good to see you. Fine, fine. How are you? Good, good, good.
SPEAKER_02: I share your photo. Yeah, I see it on Instagram. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, how are you? Feeling good? Yeah, I feel good. Now I'm in the final preparation stage. And what's your weight now? 86 kg is my morning weight.
SPEAKER_01: morning so only one kilo you need to yeah only one kilo yeah that's good that's good that's nothing you know yeah and all the georgians who train with you they said your shape is very good and they have big confidence in you yeah sg records roman roman says that looking at that forearm as a georgian i'm wishing you not to compete in 85 kg class then brother slow it down a bit
SPEAKER_01: yeah i don't know he's talking about me or about you roman who are you talking because before you come i was showing off my forearm maybe he's talking about your forearm that i posted on the uh instagram and facebook and also i posted i think on the youtube you start also preferring training after injuries um
SPEAKER_01: I was in very good shape before the East versus West 10. And then I think it was about four weeks. And then I was doing this exercise. I was hanging myself from here.
SPEAKER_01: badly, you know, I mean, if you were there, you would thought that I died or something, you know, because the sound that I hit my head and the neck, trapezius, everything was so bad. And then I stopped training. And so after that,
SPEAKER_01: Like last East versus West, two days before the event, I had the stem cell therapy. Yeah, everywhere. Like I think 17 different points, including my knees, you know. And then doctors who applied me, Dr. Mark, he said, don't train for like five weeks or something, you know.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah, this is what he said. Yeah. And then so before that, I didn't train four weeks around. And then after that, maybe five weeks more. So and then after I come back from Dubai,
SPEAKER_01: I went there as a trainer, you know. And then I started to train. So how long I have been training? Like maybe 15, 20 days I have been training. And I have like positive feeling. I still have some inflammation on the elbow. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: i think that some of them is because very chronic you know just because you have one therapy like 30 years damage it doesn't go away right away and another thing i'm eating too much carbs you understand so when you have that much of carbs you know it also causes some some inflammation i think i need to eat start eating clean you know like yeah you know i understood yeah too much sweet
SPEAKER_02: What's your weight now? 92.5 this morning. I mean, if I was as ripped as you are, trust me, I would be matching on 75, 77. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm working to don't going higher my weights. I don't training big muscles, chest, back. Because when I
SPEAKER_01: start training legs chest my weight is going high high and that's also bad for arm wrestling because i mean you can still train your chest but you don't need to really grow so much because your height i think is good for 85 kilos yeah yeah i think this too yeah and let's see how it will be and uh
SPEAKER_01: After the last AMC, do you know who wrote to me? No. Sarmat wrote to me. Sarmat? Yeah, and he said that, Engin, probably I can come in April. And...
SPEAKER_02: I think if he can come outside of Russia, I think he's going to pull the winner of the Vladimir and Miro. Yes, that's very interesting. You know, this IMC is not like last IMC. When I was at IMC in June,
SPEAKER_01: here is more concurration is high. Now is not like this concurrency. Yeah, it is basically like 95%. This is like a Russian champion. Yeah. 95% there is like, I saw one Armenian and then I saw one Azerbaijan and then I saw Ferit Osman, my countryman.
SPEAKER_01: Like maybe four or five guys, maybe not. Who is your translator? Just tell him to come close to you. Okay. Yeah. Assalamu alaikum, my name is Alibek. What's your name? Alibek. Are you back? Yeah, I translated last time. Okay, okay, okay, okay, yeah, yeah. And how are you, Nurdalet?
SPEAKER_01: okay um so what you were competing like you have very different story that people don't know uh
SPEAKER_01: That story is that you started, first time I saw you was in 2015, Malaysia. And you were 55 kilo. So 55 kilo, like 55 and then 60 and 65 world champion. 70 kilo, third place or second? Second place, yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: second place and then you won 75 kilo and 80 kilo so now you won five different category in the in the world championships and um and now uh you are gonna compete 85 kilo east versus west 85 kilo east versus west uh-huh and and what what is your weight now 20 kilos
SPEAKER_01: OK, Roman, I met you and I wish my guy Vala to be there.
SPEAKER_01: 85 kg just in case other guy fails against it for um yeah this is this is an incredible match this is an incredible match i mean you are many times world champion you are just like a machine and you want 75 kilo east versus west world title you beat mindaugas and now you cannot lose weight so that is why you are pulling 85 kilo and
SPEAKER_01: and you we know you are very explosive while your opponent i mean i cannot say slow but not as explosive as you are but he is also very powerful and
SPEAKER_01: Lately, I see you in the past, you, Nur Dalet, also, you were going hook. But lately, I see you more like sideways and outside. And Vala is also going outside. And it will be a battle of the top roll. Top roll, it will be a battle. I have a question for Nur Dalet. Nur Dalet, in the past, I remember when you were younger,
SPEAKER_01: and lighter you were 50 60 65 kilo you had very long hook matches long matches like you can you can even say that you had very good endurance but lately we see you explosive how this can happen
SPEAKER_03: It happened because I had many experience of it and I had many training because of it I have more power and I have to just explode and end the match at the beginning
SPEAKER_01: But does he still have the endurance? Just say that if he and Vardar just stop somewhere. Does he still have explosive endurance or he kind of loves it? We will see in the match.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know, but I'm training the fast finish. I am training the explosive one. Yeah, yeah, we see that, yeah. And another question, but this time for Vala. Your real name is Valiko, right? Yes, yes, Valiko. We didn't know that we wrote the poster the first time and then we continue that way. But Valiko, I have seen you.
SPEAKER_01: Not so many times, I think, Europeans involved. Yeah. Yeah. But it was like your beginning. How old are you? I'm 25 years old. 25 years. So since the pandemic already three years happened. And then before the pandemic. Yeah. So it was like your international beginning years, right? Before the pandemic. Yeah. I was competing at under 18 and under 21s.
SPEAKER_02: I win European champions, world champion, but when I go in seniors, start pandemic and after pandemic our federation gets a disqualification and that's
SPEAKER_02: is very bad for me i continue training but we don't go in any international competition first competition after uh this is uh dubai in dubai when i meet bojidar and kashirsky and after this i'm going in imc in russia yeah i remember yeah so right before the pandemic it was your beginning years of the seniors
SPEAKER_01: yeah yeah okay okay i understand and now you so you are saying basically that there was no pandemic the way that now you became one of the stars in our messing you're a very powerful guy that it would continue in the waffen europeans right if there was no funding yes so
SPEAKER_02: i think i think now now here is more interesting for me east and west and this like these championships uh but uh i think uh after some years i get back on waf or europeans and world champions but what i'm just saying that
SPEAKER_01: you will be well-known champion anyways you know if if there was no pandemic then then right now we know you as a voila who is coming professional events that time we will be seen as you like either champion or medalist in the as a team part of team georgia you know you know when when i was uh 20 years old
SPEAKER_02: I'm competing also in seniors in Turkey, 70 kilogram classes. 2018? Yes, 2018. And I get third place in the left half. Right now, Andrea Yavakalatze, he wrote that he beat Mindagos and Akdev on his last Europeans lefty.
SPEAKER_02: Sorry, repeat me. Did you beat Mindaugas and Talgat Aktaev? Yes, yes, yes. I beat them. Was it in Greece? No, in Turkey. In Turkey, I beat them. Oh, okay, okay. Then it is not the Europeans, then. World champions. It's world champions. Mindaugas and Talgat Aktaev. That is the event when Cerkasov and Daniel were the finalists.
SPEAKER_01: yes yes yes and and in the right car right arm i uh get uh fourth place get the first place it was very top category first was macaro in the august correct yes yes yeah that's that's that's interesting yeah and now this this is a very tough match how do you see how do you see
SPEAKER_02: Nurdalet, what do you think about Nurdalet? Everyone knows my opponent is very experienced and very smart. I have not met him at the table, but I'm looking, watching him, how he competes in international competitions. And it is not easy to fight against him. And I think I will be very careful against him to win.
SPEAKER_02: um i know he have uh many styles he can full top roll also in biceps he's very fast also and i'm preparing for this i'm referring for this and my shape now is better uh i working uh
SPEAKER_02: when you say your shape is better you mean better than last time you put at the east yes yes yes because um when i start preferring for imc i prefer several months and i worked on my mistakes and weak points so i think now physical shape is better now you know there is many experienced unrestler around me and i have taken their advices and it helped me so much
SPEAKER_02: yeah yeah and what what is your biggest concern about nurdan is his speed explosiveness yes uh i think he's very fast and that's very bad for me um yes yeah but but you are also very powerful you know yeah now i i uh one of the main mistake i made is overtiring last times
SPEAKER_02: and not getting enough rest. Now I'm working about this and I think my physical shape now is very good. So you are saying that when you train now, you rest more and you progress better? Yeah, I'm training very hard, very intensively and then resting very few days.
SPEAKER_02: that's good now yes yes now i i must rest more times and i feel better i understand yeah but that is that is part of it you know like training eating
SPEAKER_01: What do you know about your opponent? Do you know about him a lot? What is your opinion, what is your concern about him, about Valiko?
SPEAKER_03: I've seen the competition of Valikon in Russia and last time's competitions. And I've seen the competition with David Savusha and I've learned a lot from it.
SPEAKER_03: And I'm training because of it. And what did he learn? What did he learn about him by watching it? Yeah. So, what did you learn about him? What did you learn about him? What did you learn about him? What did you learn about him? What did you learn about him?
SPEAKER_03: I think that the biceps and the top is very better. What did you say? Biceps and top roll? Yeah, top roll and the biceps is very good. Very good, okay. And how does he see his chances against Waliko?
SPEAKER_01: Do you think he expected a tough match or an easy match? What does he expect? I know that he said that he wants to win quick, but you know that he knows that, right? The title matches right now is... But this is not the title match, so sorry about it. Yeah, yeah, go ahead. I think Umayl Kacpit is a very good player.
SPEAKER_03: I think that this fight is going to be tough because Valiko is a very tough guy. But I am training a lot and in the future maybe I will win. Okay. What do you mean in the future? You mean this event? Yeah, in the competition. Ah, in the competition. Okay. Okay. And yeah. So...
SPEAKER_01: How do you see the category? Right now, Vladimir Mairov and Samusha will pull. And then the Sarmat from Russia, he's also probably going to come. How do you see your chances against all these guys? Valiko, Samusha, Vladimir Mairov, maybe Bojidar will come back.
SPEAKER_01: And Adam Orzenski will probably pull in this category. And Sarmat is coming. Like, how do you see Sarmat? Sarmat wins AMC event. Do you think that Sarmat can win the title over here? What is his chance?
SPEAKER_03: David Samushyan is the founder of IMC.
SPEAKER_03: I've seen the videos in AMC of Sarmat. Very tough guy and fast. He fights with David Samush and wins faster. He's very tough guy. At the AMC, did Sarmat pull Samush there? No, right? No.
SPEAKER_03: I think they didn't meet each other, right? He thinks that he will win Samushev. He thinks that Sarmat is going to beat Samushev? Yeah. Yes, Sarmat will win. Okay, and what does he think for himself? Can he beat Sarmat?
SPEAKER_03: I think that I'm going to win after Valiko. I'm going to win Samushev and then Salmakkozu. So he has plans to beat everyone?
SPEAKER_01: That's good, that's good mindset, that's good mindset, yeah. And Waliko, is Sarmat a little personal for you? Yes, our final match, everyone knows our final match at IMC. I don't think he beat me.
SPEAKER_02: uh i i put i pulled him i win this uh match and after 10 minutes uh the refers come back and tell me you must fight again fight again and that's very bad uh here is many things i don't want to speak about this uh zarmat is very good sportsman very strong um very smart
SPEAKER_02: But I can't say that he can beat me or he can beat David Samusha. David Samusha is number first now. He wins every opponent and we must see.
SPEAKER_02: uh when you you know here is big difference uh standard competition and when that has yeah my my many friends iraqi david say me here is big difference but when i uh have a window against david uh
SPEAKER_02: then I understood what they mean here is very important endurance endurance and here is a little uh difference about rules uh you know starting in standard competition is already go and here is don't mo go and this is total is give us a big difference and after this when did I get this experience
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, the reason that we eliminated ready, because when you say like, ready, go, like, yeah, it's very hard to start like, like, athlete needs to start at the goal.
SPEAKER_01: when you say ready go sometimes some start with red d go you understand so yeah i understand we just say don't move so everyone is ready for the goal only go because like before like this is like ready or he's diving here he's already pulling you know i don't want it i want people to start with the one command go you know ready go no go oh yes yeah that's the reason that i want to do but about the endurance i agree with you
SPEAKER_01: um no no no andrea says don't move command is not necessary no it's just necessary atlas needs to know that go is coming because you may think that they are ready and you say go but athlete may not know that it's coming athlete needs to know that go is coming you know anyway so um about the endros here i agree if you would pull up with some shit in a tournament
SPEAKER_02: you would put him already to the b side yeah yeah yeah and then he had to come back and do many matches to come back to the you know you know that is why between matches in standard competition you rest five minutes six minutes and here is here is a very you must you must uh preferring uh more
SPEAKER_01: more endurance for Vendettas yeah yeah you're right you're right yeah all you need to really dominate you know every round you know so quickly yeah I understand yeah anyway so and and
SPEAKER_02: He believes, Aydar Khan says that he believes he's going to beat you. He believes that after that he beats Samusha. It's normal. Yes, that's sports spirit. And you? And how is your... Of course, I think I win. Yes, I'm coming for a win.
SPEAKER_01: And I want to will be first in this category. Yeah, that's good. That's good. That's good. Yeah. I mean, I want to say iPhone. Yeah. OK, so let's let's let's talk about some other matches as well. And then and then.
SPEAKER_01: We can continue, but I want to ask one more question to Nurdalet. Nurdalet, this is a new category for you. This is a new category. You are putting 85 kilo. How do you see the difference between
SPEAKER_01: Lightweight category and the. Uh, well through weight category, like 75 and 85 in 75, you know, there is, uh, like, uh, Daniel, you know, these, these guys, while in 85, you know, now you have. Hopefully will come.
SPEAKER_03: like how do you see the difference like do you have do you have can you compare these two categories
SPEAKER_03: There is no big differences between the 75 and the 85 because the fighter can win. Alonzo will win.
SPEAKER_03: but but i understand in the in the open category open category yeah yeah in the open category he won yeah alan won but yeah he realized that you know there is yeah there is no differences between guys in 75 and 85 uh yeah everyone can be
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but the match that he's comparing is it.
SPEAKER_01: open category overall absolute category so in the absolute category it is not so so much like healthy like in 22 years ago in the open category absolute category i beat travis versions boom like this but i was 70 you know he was super overweight but so it is not really absolute category is not really healthy judgment this is what i want to say you know
SPEAKER_01: yeah anyways yeah so this is good and also who knows maybe i also come to that category
SPEAKER_01: you are very tough tough guy and a smart guy yeah of all of us yeah you guys are also very tough and smart too if if i come i'm i'm almost 50 years old this year i will be 50 years old would he take me seriously if he sees me if he sees me across the table would he take me seriously ask him
SPEAKER_01: Your question is? I said this year, I will be 50 years old. If someday, if Nurdale sees me across the table, arm wrestling table, will he take me seriously? Or he will just say, it's the old guy, I'm going to kill him, you know?
SPEAKER_03: no no i don't think so because uh you're very tough nowadays in 50 years
SPEAKER_03: I think that toughness and smartness is very big thing of you. Because I had the experience. I fought with you two times.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but now he's like Superman, you know. No, no, no. No, no, you, you. Same, same, same Superman. Yeah. We will see. It's incredible. I really hope that people understand, Waliko, like the level that this, like you, Nur Dalet, Mairo,
SPEAKER_01: and Samusha like many other guys you know like Sarmat you know it's just like incredible you know and I really hope
SPEAKER_01: because you guys all are very like special human beings you know like in my book like extraordinary human beings and i really love watching you guys and whenever i organize this event i'm the one that who enjoys the most to to watch the matches you know it will be it will be great um you said that your shape right now is better than the last time you pulled at the east versus west and
SPEAKER_02: Do you still planning to pull Samuse again in some point if he is still the title holder? Yes, my shape now is better. I know this, but I don't know that's enough for Samuse or not.
SPEAKER_02: But I think after New Dalit this match are coming against Dawit again and I think I get prefer for this better. Do you think that when StarMath comes he should direct the pool title for Samusha or he should face the winner of this match?
SPEAKER_02: against fight against sarbat is also interesting for me uh because i i he win imc's final uh but more interesting is against david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david david
SPEAKER_01: little bit more matches to yeah i know yeah yeah okay so let's talk about let's talk about uh the cards other matches let let's start while we are talking about the samusha do you guys know vladimir myro yeah i i remember i remember uh my euro uh
SPEAKER_02: at slot tour also in Moldova matches he's very strong athlete but I don't know he have a rest time yes because last time last time I don't watching any international competition him I think that's interesting much but
SPEAKER_02: David wins, because two times, how I remember, they are same categories and David wins this competition. The last one was 2018-20, but there, Mairo and Alijan Morado really killed it.
SPEAKER_01: i remember that that event and with left arm myro even beat uh raster they can he just like not long match he with left arm he beat raster they can and left arm left arm he had like gazia or something gazia i think um he and uh myro had a long match and then still myro stopped
SPEAKER_02: but in the in the final he and gazia had like maybe like two minute matches myro he again myro won and then he couldn't stop this time uh it's very important uh now how how is his shape now because you know uh three or four three years he resting long time right yeah that's very long time yeah
SPEAKER_01: How I remember, he is fighting in Swiss Open, yes? Yeah, he just come in the beginning of the November. He won easy, yeah. He has like very strong wrist and then like a dragon, you know, he just like pulls himself. And I think in Moldova event, in the final, he beat Bojidar.
SPEAKER_01: Davit also have very strong biceps and have very big endurance. Now title matches you need to win four rounds. Yeah. And do you expect this to be a tough match or easy match for Samusha? Because you said Samusha is gonna win.
SPEAKER_02: I think that's easy match for Samushya. Easy match? Yeah. Even the round one? First round, maybe here is some stop, stopping in biceps. But after this round, David, easy win. Can I ask you something? Whenever we are talking with...
SPEAKER_01: Valiko can you turn the microphone off because your translation also coming everything is getting mixed you know yeah but right now I will talk I will talk with Nur Dalet yeah right now you don't need to stop the microphone Nur Dalet how do you see Vladimir Mayr versus Davut Samushe?
SPEAKER_03: Last time when I saw Dmitry Maiev, it was in 2017. A very long time passed.
SPEAKER_01: and uh because of uh he has a rest i think that i'm gonna win oh okay okay i understand um you don't need to turn off your microphone valiko because you are not you are not translating anything that no sound is coming from you yeah but you guys say that you all say that like you know there was a rest long rest but that for example jerry cadarest after 2019 he didn't compete he just came and beat gennady
SPEAKER_01: and then after the top eight he didn't compete anywhere he just came and beat john and then beat michael thors and iraqli you know so some people can come back you know and then still win you know but let's see how it will be so you both are thinking that david samusha is gonna be uh winner and let's go to the next match okay
SPEAKER_01: This one, as I say always, I only want the name of the winner. Valiko versus Nur Dalet. Who is winning? Valiko. Of course, of course. I'm coming in Turkey for winning. Okay. Turkey. Who is winning? Valiko. I don't know.
SPEAKER_03: I've been training a lot and I'm going to win. I think Oleg Petrenko. That's a very hard match, but I think Oleg Petrenko will win.
SPEAKER_01: Oleg Petrenko. Okay. And Nurdanet? Oleg Petrenko. And Robby Topi versus Aymeric. Aymeric is from France. Are you guys family? Are you guys family with these names?
SPEAKER_01: Which guy? Tell me again. Robbie Toppy versus Aymeric Pradin. I don't remember these guys. Okay. Does he know them? Yes, he knows him.
SPEAKER_01: okay but opponent does he know the opponent as well rabitabi okay i understand okay let's go to the next one artem taino versus left arm 95 kilo ball title match
SPEAKER_03: i think that timers is gonna win because i've seen the fights with such and it was great fight okay yeah that's that will be very uh hard hard fights but uh i think zura surah can win yeah
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I heard he's in good shape, but his opponent is also in great shape. Yeah, I know he's in very good shape. Yeah, let's see how it will be. And Irakli Zirakashvili, Pauline. Nur Dalet. Just microphone please, yeah. I am Irakli Zirakashvili. I am currently in uniform.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, Irakli is in good shape. I'm gonna go to Irakli because he's young. And what does he think about Pauline? I know about Pauline, but I'm gonna go to Irakli. Okay, okay. And you?
SPEAKER_02: i i know i know iraqli is not a very good shape uh 85 category is very good for him and i think iraqli win i understand and you you also are near levan
SPEAKER_02: yeah the other day we saw some photos all together you yeah we we're training uh together we're training together and we have how is levan doing levan uh started training and uh he get big and get big getting bigger how is his shape can he be iraqi right now or no of course of course leon can be now he can be directly already yes of course
SPEAKER_02: But Levani now is very careful about his wrist and he only working, only working. Only with the weight? Yeah, yeah, yeah, only working. Yeah, because we saw one video of Irakli and Levani together. Yeah. Yeah, Levani is always working about it. He not use full power. Okay, okay.
SPEAKER_01: So he's not really pushing his limits. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. I understand. Yeah. And with Sarkozy, Wagner versus Matt Mask. Sarkozy. Wagner, Wagner, Wagner, Wagner.
SPEAKER_03: i'm gonna take uh yeah but it's not why is that is that because he is much bigger
SPEAKER_03: We do not have any problems with sports. We do not have any problems with sports. We do not have any problems with sports. We do not have any problems with sports.
SPEAKER_03: Because Matt Musk lost last times in the competition. The Barcoa had tough guys against, but he find a way to win in this match. And he's very explosive. And you, Waliko? I think Porto Lato win, yes.
SPEAKER_02: i i look looking his training and he is in crazy crazy form okay do you think the possible that matt can take his wrist no no i think uh in shoulder and shoulder press is okay so the wagner will not need to do this because he will have to yeah yes okay okay
SPEAKER_01: And the next one, Aydarhan. You know them very well. Mindaguas, Daniel. Your category. Normally, it was your belt. But you're not going down by a kilogram, 75. Who's going to be champion? Daniel ProkopÃ§uk. Daniel ProkopÃ§uk will win? Yes, he will. Is it easy or hard?
SPEAKER_03: It's not like that. It's not like that, but it's not like that, but it's not like that, but it's not like that, but it's like that.
SPEAKER_03: Because when I fight with Mindawas, I spend a lot of power, a lot of time, and Mindawas is very tough. I think that Mindawas is going to win. Oh, Mindawas is going to win, not Daniel.
SPEAKER_01: yeah but like how does he think about his match with mindagos was it hard or easy that when he pulled for the title
SPEAKER_03: Mindawas was easier than Prokopcik because I win 3-0. And Prokopcik is harder and tougher than Mindawas. Okay, okay.
SPEAKER_01: No, no, Mario, it's not because I was like, what the fuck? Because he said first Prokopchuk and the second time he said Mindauras. That's why I was confused, you know. You guys misunderstand everything, you know, come on. And you? I think that's a very hard match. Very, very hard match. And Daniel will be winning. I think his endurance is more higher than Mindauras'.
SPEAKER_01: I understand. But you expect a top match, so maybe possibly Mindaugas will take his risk? Yeah, I think maybe. But Daniel has very high endurance. So four rounds, it's hard for Mindaugas to do that, is what you are saying? Yeah, yes. Okay. But your heart is a top roller? Your heart is with the top roller or you don't care?
SPEAKER_01: i don't care you don't care right because it's not your teammate or something i understand you
SPEAKER_01: Usually, because I go with outside, whenever I see two guys, my mind wants top roller to win. Not because of the guy, but because of the style. Because I am also fighting against these guys. I cannot really put myself in that imagination, but I can do empathy for the top roller. Yes.
SPEAKER_03: Oleg Dzok vs Tutberidze. 85 kg champion vs 80 kg champion. I would say Oleg Dzok. Because he is a very good fighter. I would say Oleg Dzok is the best fighter. Oleg Dzok? No, I would say Oleg Dzok.
SPEAKER_03: Alekcho is going to win because they're going to fight on the top. Yeah, on the top. And Alekcho is going to take it. OK, OK. And what does he think about Tutberidze? TUTBERIDZE TUTBERIDZE TUTBERIDZE
SPEAKER_03: I saw Tukberidze in Almaty and he had a belt in the senior and in the adult. He is very tough, but I think Tukberidze is better and tougher than Tukberidze. And you, Vala?
SPEAKER_02: Tutberidze is a very good guy. He is young and he has a very good shape. I wish him to win, but Oleg is a very bad opponent for him because both of his top rollers and everyone knows against Sho, top roll is very hard. If Tutberidze has the same power in hook,
SPEAKER_01: i think uh he he will beat uh oleg but on top roll uh i wish him to win okay let's see how it will be and let's go to the next one ivan matushenko reno message
SPEAKER_03: I think 50-50. I can't say that.
SPEAKER_01: So it looks like he is very impressed by Reno. Because usually people say that Ivan is going to win. But if he's saying 50-50, then it means that Nur Dalet is very impressed by Reno.
SPEAKER_03: No, I have seen the last years. Murat Valijan, Sandr Isteduktu. But they were right. This is Solkol. How do you call Solkol? Rin. Rin, right?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, Reno is very impressive because he was the world champion. World champion in the left hand. Yeah, but left arm he didn't pull Ali Canmurado. Ali Canmurado with left hand, he was in the super category. But this super match,
SPEAKER_01: This is left arm. This is so-called. Ivan Matushenko. So you say 50-50. Yeah, 50-50. Yep. In the last press conference, did you speak English or did you need translators? Sorry?
SPEAKER_01: did you speak English or you need a translator in the last time, the last event you played the East versus West press conference? I speak English. I speak English. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Because I think that you are doing better and better. Yeah. Yeah. Roman also wrote, while us English, English is good, improved since last match. He says, yeah. Okay. About, yes, about Reno and,
SPEAKER_02: Ivan, I think Reno is very good, very young and progressing good, but Ivan Matuszenko is professor. He's like flesh, fleshman. He's very fast. Were you surprised when he beat David Arabuli that easy? Yes, yes. David is very strong, very good condition, but he can't use anything.
SPEAKER_01: uh ivan matushenko is one of the top uh in left arm today in the world so basically you are saying he's gonna beat reno yeah yeah i think i understand and okay krasimir costa do you know john brzing yeah i think john brazil
SPEAKER_01: Is that because he wants John Brzing to win or is it because his objective opinion? In my opinion. Your opinion. And Nurtenet, who is your favorite arm master? Like all time, like not today only, but all time. Who is your favorite arm master or who are your favorite arm masters?
SPEAKER_01: Arsene Liliev and you, Aydar Khan is almost same, Arsene Liliev. Yeah, almost same style, same style, yeah. And so, John Brzezink and Arsene Liliev, correct?
SPEAKER_02: the greatest two guys for me is this one yeah good picks and how do you see this match krasimir and john i think john john will be uh win uh i i compare uh iraqli um fighting both of uh
SPEAKER_02: john and krasimir iraqi win krasimir were easy i think and uh not easy against john i think john win john win okay yeah but do you do you do you expect a tough match or the dominance uh i think this uh tough match tough match okay yeah okay
SPEAKER_01: Let's go to the left arm super heavyweight world title match. Artem Morozov versus Alex Kurdesha. Before this, I want to ask you something. Is your left arm better than your right? Or your right is better? Or the same?
SPEAKER_02: My right is better, but sometimes my left arm is in very good shape. In many international competitions, for example at the World Championship, many times I win with my left arm and in second or third place with my right arm.
SPEAKER_02: uh sometimes sometimes my left is better sometimes okay and and how about this match morozov versus kurdecha left arm i think i think morozov will be win uh because uh last match how i remember when he meet gasparin hermes gasparin morozov's left is very very strong
SPEAKER_01: do you think gasparin's left arm is as good as his right arm no but no but uh i know gasparin have very good left yeah not like right but also good okay and let's go to
SPEAKER_01: This match, for me, is the best match. No disrespect to any other match. All of them are incredible, including your match. But this, Ali Can versus Prudnik match, for me, is incredible. Yeah, for me also. For me also, because... Yeah, this is an incredible match. I mean...
SPEAKER_02: Last time when I saw Prudnik fight against Tadykian, Prudnik is very, very strong and smart. But Murato is also very strong, very strong, very fast. That's very interesting. Very interesting. 15-15, I think. 15-15. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Wow. And do you expect, I expect that, you know, Ali Can starts faster and maybe first round or something he may pin, but eventually the match will stop. If Prudnik stops him, I think Prudnik's endurance will be better. But Murato has very good impulses. He has a very strong start.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah. And before this, I want to ask to Nurdale about Morozov versus Alex Kurdeca. So-called world title match, super heavyweight. Left arm. Artyom, Morozov. Artyom, Morozov. Artyom, Morozov.
SPEAKER_01: I will take Ayrton Morozov. He's in a good shape and they're getting better, getting stronger. Okay. And then the other match that I just asked you, Waliko, which is my personal favorite. Sorry about it because the phone is turned off. It's okay. No problem. No problem. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: The match between Ali-Chan Muradov and Evgeny Prudnik. 105 kilos. The world champion. Ali-Chan is very strong right now. But we saw the results of Prudnik in the past. Tadik Samoyshev gave two rounds to Tadikyan. Prudnik is a very smart and strong athlete.
SPEAKER_03: uh
SPEAKER_03: and uh in the shape but protnikov just show us that he is going to the end uh with fight uh we we saw in david he just lost two times uh two rounds and then he got wins yeah he can take uh the losers in the two rounds and then take a very tough guy
SPEAKER_01: And I think that it's very tough. 50-50. 50-50, wow. Yeah. Looks like anyone who has an opinion about this match, they think that it's like 50-50 or maybe a little bit Ali Can is better or a little bit Brutnik is better. Everyone is just so confused how this match goes, you know. And Nur Dalet, what do you think about the endurance of Ali Can?
SPEAKER_01: Alican is very explosive. And who do you think that has better endurance? Prudnik or Alican? We know that Alican is more explosive. Who has better endurance? Alican. Alican has better endurance? Yeah. Okay. Then it's interesting you to say 50-50 because he is more explosive and better endurance.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know how it is and it's gonna be like this and how do you think that is better and gross Valiko in this match put it again uh I think I think prudent have better endurance or prudent better endurance but uh uh Alijan have a very strong start like not only the start even the match stops he he
SPEAKER_01: Explosive again. Explosive again and explosive again. But endurance, I think Prudnik has better endurance. If the match stops and if the valiant antenna is exploded. Stop, stop, stop. I understand. That's an incredible match. I just can't wait. Two weeks. Only two weeks left. And the last match. Tatachins vs. David Dadikian. Valiko.
SPEAKER_02: Hutchins is a monster. That's also a very interesting match, but I think Hutchins will be winning. I understand. And what is the chance of David Dadikian to win this match?
SPEAKER_01: do you give him any chance or you are just thinking 100 percent no uh 37 70 30 70. um
SPEAKER_03: Toghachins is going to win because Dadikan is tough and Toghachins is tough too. But Dadikan can get the first round and then Toghachins take all the rounds. What does he think about Toghachins generally?
SPEAKER_03: He's a legendary sport for us because when we were children, we just saw the videos of him. And nowadays he's in a good shape.
SPEAKER_01: and uh can't take this fight and does he believe that he says that todd is gonna win so does he believe that peter galley will come back and beat todd uh sorry who um
SPEAKER_03: Qadir Ghalib, does he believe that Qadir Ghalib will train better and will beat Tatachins? Yes, Qadir Ghalib will beat Tatachins. Qadir Ghalib will beat Tatachins. Qadir Ghalib will beat Tatachins.
SPEAKER_03: Qadir Ghali is training now, training hard, and maybe after these championships, in other championships, if they want to fight, Qadir Ghali is going to be in the other shape, better shape, and Qadir Ghali will take it. And was he surprised when Qadir Ghali lost against Tata Jinx?
SPEAKER_01: Why was the old Kazakh team, Shardara, Shardara, Shardara, was surprised, shocked? Yeah, it was very surprising. Yeah, so they were expecting Ungarber to win for sure. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: yeah next next time on my wife will take the watch uh-huh and and you valiko were you surprised when menongar were lost against not no no because i know uh todd hutchins is very strong yes he doesn't doesn't care about his wrist like this or like this he have very strong shoulder press and
SPEAKER_02: As we see, Kurdilgal can't do anything against him. Do you think that next time the result may change or you expect the same results if they ever pull again? I think the result will not change because Huchin's level is higher.
SPEAKER_01: I understand. And before we close, Nurdaret, Devon versus Levan, the revenge match, will the result change next time? And can you ask him, what does he think about Devon Larratt? Just can you ask him? This is my point.
SPEAKER_03: He's clever, can take the time, he's tough, and he won all the opponents.
SPEAKER_01: But he had one loss of Levan. But he's very tough. Yeah, but he not one loss only. He also lost Gennady. Yeah. Gennady kicked Gennady Levan. Yeah. 3-2. And next time, do you think that next time Devon will beat Levan? Do you have any chance?
SPEAKER_03: I think that Levan is going to win. As easy as last time he thinks or it will be tougher?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, this fight is going to be tougher, but Levan is taking. I understand, yeah. And Valiko? Valiko is smiling as a Georgian with Levan. I know Levan. I know Levan. He has unlimited power. Unlimited power. No one can beat him. No one can stop him.
SPEAKER_02: When Lewand prefer good and seriously no one can beat him. What do you think about Devon generally? I think Devon get second tattoo on his right arm. No, that's not what I asked. Generally, what do you think about him as an arm wrestler? About Devon? Yeah. Devon is very good.
SPEAKER_02: very strong, very experienced athlete. He is very smart also. He can beat her opponent. Maybe I must speak about Gasparini and Larat. Gasparini's physical power is higher, but Devon is smart and beat him. But against Lewandowski,
SPEAKER_01: He can't do anything. So what Devon did to Georgi Swetko, to Denis Siplenko and Ermes Gasparini, you say that he will not work against? No, not working against Levan. And how objective are you when you say this? Are you speaking as a friend of Levan who is from Georgia? No. No? No.
SPEAKER_01: okay and you are saying that he's on his bicep uh i think uh leon's uh uh shape get better and better now now we we will see uh leon in another level you you believe that because people think that because leon has been injured and he couldn't train a long time many people think that he will not be as good as before
SPEAKER_02: you agree with that no leon leon uh shape now will be better i know this even better than before yeah better than before you know this because of you know the leon's uh thoughts because his opinions was his plan and everything that's why you think that he's gonna be because yes yes leon is very smart yeah he's very smart he uh uh
SPEAKER_02: explaining his preferring very good always and now is uh starting preferring very good also and I think his shape will be better than last time okay okay so you are saying he will be even better and this is this is probably what levan believes and then whenever you see him you hear from him
SPEAKER_02: And then you are thinking this way, right? Because Levan is also... I know Levan, we training together after 2015. And I know when he had bad moments in his career, I mean now like against Gasparini, against Gasparini,
SPEAKER_01: uh this uh give him very big Motivation very big Motivation because once he little bit you know shake everyone attacks him so he is he's not gonna give this opportunity yeah exactly exactly I understand yeah let's see let's see how it will be I hope it's gonna be uh great and another thing the Levan's left arm is coming is he training
SPEAKER_02: yeah he's training his left arm and uh that's very interesting leon's left arm is always better than right arm always better yeah we training together and after leon's training when we have sparring time he has many time we pull right arm he's tired and tired but
SPEAKER_02: always we can't do anything about his left arm he have very big endurance you're talking about even now or in the past you're talking about uh i think about past past times now also also very good also any any training yes uh we can't do anything about his against his left arm
SPEAKER_01: Oh, nobody, huh? You cannot even go? Nobody, yes. You Iraqi, Arab, you try, try, try and nothing? Yeah, yeah. He stopped and looking us. Okay, okay. So looks like he's coming for two bells soon. Yeah, yes. Okay, let's see. Let's see what Kurdesha, Morozov and others think about this and then we will see.
