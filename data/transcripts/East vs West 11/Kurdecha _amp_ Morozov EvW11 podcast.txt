SPEAKER_02: hello hello hello paulo hi and how are you good good and you i'm okay i'm okay moving forward um so how are the trainings training is uh very good i'm uh changing my training a little bit before i was mostly training for you know strength and power
SPEAKER_02: now i'm more training for uh arm wrestling specific exercises because yeah i'm just too strong and too big you know it's it's i'm too big yeah but just make make sure that you know maybe not as often but still time to time train other things that has given you advantage still today you know no no yeah i do but yeah not as much not as much not as much yeah yeah
SPEAKER_00: But let's see. Do you follow? How do you see the cards? Do you see the cards? Yes. Very interesting. Very interesting. Interesting, right? Yeah. I really hope that the number of the fans, arm wrestling fans, will be...
SPEAKER_00: more and more every day instead of I am only a fan of this guy. Yeah, it is great that you are a fan of one guy, but you need to be a fan of the sport as well, you understand? Not only because of this guy or that guy, you understand? It's good. But you also need to like, I mean, there are many people that, you know,
SPEAKER_00: uh likes other sports but like they they like just say like athleticism but there has been carl louis there has been ben johnson there has been usain bolt you know just because they like the athleticism but you know yeah no it's it's skyrocketing the amount of amount of people who is watching carm wrestling is skyrocketing i can see it it's very recognizable right now
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, that's good. That's good. Because that is how we will grow with the permanent armwrestling fans. Because many of the really famous armwrestlers right now they are getting older and they can't be there forever. They cannot be there forever. So eventually, you know,
SPEAKER_00: so that's why we are also trying to bring new faces new guys like we are inviting Reno message and Bacho and some new guys from US some new guys from Kazakhstan Ukraine you know that is absolutely absolutely yeah arm wrestling is an old sport and yes it's very good but listen we are not forever here right yeah yeah yeah
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, so we need to make a good plan, serious base for the... Younger generation, absolutely. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Because we don't want him to stop after us. So what are the plans? You had a match, but I think he got cancelled because of the shoulder problem of Corey. Yeah, Corey was cancelled. So instead of that, I got the match...
SPEAKER_02: uh with uh cody married it's not it's not uh officially on the flyer yet but i got it the way now you're gonna put him april oh april yeah left left so uh that that i got i'm trying to set up some smaller matches here on the local events um in florida i will pull uh

SPEAKER_00: It's busy. Yeah, that's good. That's good, yeah. Oh, I think somebody came, you know. Oh, Alex is here. Hey, Alex. You hear us? Hey, Alex. Hello, guys. Hello. I mean, because when the new guy come, you know, it's in the different screen. You need to move the screen to see the new guy. So I didn't even realize you came here. So how is everything?
SPEAKER_00: Always cool. How are you? I hope you're better than after Dubai. I mean, your sickness. Yeah, yeah, it's getting better. Yeah, yeah. I'm drinking some cold medicines and I just train. I did yesterday. No, two days ago I did bicep curl. Even when I do when I do the barbell curl, I was putting the bar here.
SPEAKER_00: This time I started to put like my palm even under, so it even puts more pressure to supinate my forearm and it really puts pressure on my pronator so much because like this is different than whenever even you put this. But I really needed it because my arms are really like staying like this, you know, it doesn't turn that way.
SPEAKER_00: and but because of that now i have big big soreness on the um i don't know probably because of that or because i didn't train for two months on the brachialis and then whenever i have the brachialis problem you know you want to open your arm but he doesn't want you know it hurts you understand
SPEAKER_00: and then yesterday you know i slept like this on my arm and then it hurts because it's straight so much whenever i wake up it was just so much pain you know anyways i think morozov came as also yes yes hello so how is everything going guys
SPEAKER_00: Everything is good. He's asking how are you? Let's start with Artem. We know that he has some stomach problems. We would like to know how he feels right now. Are you okay with your stomach, Artem?
SPEAKER_02: Artyom, we know you had problems with your stomach. How are you doing now? I'm doing good. I'm just holding myself back. I don't eat what I get. Like before. He said everything is okay, everything is fine, but I have to control myself. Not to eat everything in a row, but to control myself.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah, I understand. And how is the training right now? What is his weight? Yeah, training is fine. He's training with his trainer, Evgeny Gekalo. And weight is okay, about 126 kg. 26?
SPEAKER_00: 126. Yeah, so I expect him to be 130 kilo till the event. You're expecting? Yeah, to be 130 till the event. He still has one month. He's coming from 118, 119. So he will probably 130 kilo. What does he expect? Does he have any goal to do that or he doesn't care?
SPEAKER_04: Engin says, I think you'll be 130 kg when you come to the event. And what do you think, how much weight will you gain? Well, I'm not trying to gain any weight yet. I'm just training. My strength is going up, so I don't see any point in gaining weight. I feel so comfortable. But if I do gain weight, I will.
SPEAKER_02: Okay. He said that there is no specific expectation. He said that his power and overall strength is growing very good, but he's not really having a goal to, you know, to eat up as much weight as possible. He said, yeah, it's growing slowly, but there is no goals set for the weight. And Alex, we didn't see you for a long time, long time. And finally, finally, you are back to armwrestling.
SPEAKER_00: at the world level. And this will be first time at the East versus West and we are honored to have you here. How is your shape? What is your weight? Like how do you where are you right now? We saw some training video with Bacho is very strong, but you look very dominant in the training. And can you share with us how the things are going with you?
SPEAKER_01: So first of all, thank you so much everyone who watched us. Thanks Engin for this beautiful opportunity to be part of this one of best, in my opinion, event in the world of arm wrestling.
SPEAKER_01: About my absence, it was a lot of different events. As you remember, guys, if you search on my Instagram, it was in Jordan, in Morocco, in Sicily last time. Before that, it was a lot of training camps, which we organized with Iron Fight Factory.
SPEAKER_01: which i believe uh was good and successful because they like bring i'm racing in the place where it's not so developed so it was helped to develop i'm resting in such a place about my shape honestly guys when i stand on the scales they show show me error last time when i tried to scale my waist so it shows it shows still what normally 160
SPEAKER_00: yeah normally something like that but now it's error so i need scales and do you remember your weight when you pull against like dave chaffee oh it was 42 maybe 42 something like 142 45. oh okay so you are probably minimum 20 kilo heavier than that minimum oh yeah yeah at least something like that
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let me real fast translate to the Russian-speaking community. Engin asked, how are you, how's the training? We haven't seen you for a long time, Alexey, and how's everything going? Lyoha said, yes, I was working at the Armfight Factory, doing local events, trying to promote armwrestling in places where it's not promoted.
SPEAKER_02: He said that everything was fine. He said that when he tried to weigh himself for the last time, the scales showed an error. He said that the last times when he saw it, it was about 160 kg, he probably already overcame it. Engin asked how much he weighed when he fought with Chaffee. He said, I don't remember exactly, it was either 142 or 145 kg. Well, now it's probably 20 kg more. Is everything clear? Big.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, so you can continue, Alex. So you don't know about your weight, but how are the ways that you are lifting? And who did you train other than Bacho? Who did you train lately? Did you have any...
SPEAKER_01: You know, always like gym stuff, it's gym stuff. You know, the best quality checking is table time with somebody who, you know, like level. It's like of the guys who is good to check you. Because in the gym, sometimes you can know, you compare yourself with previous version of yourself. And of course, you try to put some personal record in some exercise.
SPEAKER_01: which I really did last time in some of my favorite exercise. And you know, all this, it's also about to do not only your favorite exercise, but also exercise which you need to do to be better. Sometimes you don't like them, but you really need them. And about the shape,
SPEAKER_01: It looks like shape is good, but for me, I want somebody to check on the table. And I think Artem is the best guy because he's actually number one left-handed in the world now in the rankings. And this is a good opportunity to check. So after a match with Artem, I think I can say something about... Yeah, but don't you think that you need to...
SPEAKER_00: train with someone to see like where you are good at it where you are not and then so that you can just fix it if there is any problem before you find out that the world title match you know yeah you're right you're right but you know even sometimes like you goes pretty good but so
SPEAKER_01: table on the gym it's not the same when you compete on the competition so what i miss and i really miss it's like really competitive time i mean this competitive challenges when you when you go uh you know in the process or with real referee the real table and you have like you don't you don't believe in you don't believe in table training
SPEAKER_00: I believe, but I believe it's not the same. No, it's not the same for sure. Listen, it's not the same for sure. Lifting is not the same thing either, but we need to prepare somehow. We need to lift, we need to do table time. Of course, it's not the same, but do you think that lifting and then competing is enough? You don't believe in preparation at the table?
SPEAKER_01: I believe that practice is very good because you check and after that you like put something new in your methodology of preparation. But for me, it's very important to compete, real compete. I mean, for example, to go to competition once, second, because the reality, never practice in the gym will show you the same results which competition show you.
SPEAKER_00: So I really believe in competition time. No, no, no. For sure. Competition is like you cannot avoid, you know. I just talk about preparation to the competition. Do you think that you should need for preparation, you should need table time or not, you know? Oh, yeah, for sure. I believe both of them. I believe we need to do lift and we need to do table time because I don't believe that...
SPEAKER_00: whatever we lift isn't gonna like go and translate to the table automatically so that's why I do both of them you know both of them so I was just checking you know if you are just gonna lift lift lift and then go to the Artem Morozov match or you plan to do any like with the two hands with the smaller guys or
SPEAKER_01: anything like that you know yeah yeah yeah we use exactly that method with two hands sometimes without the pads like you know because if you need somebody with longer forearm you just take away your pads to like put your elbow a little bit down and all you open a little bit higher uh different methodology but like you said of course we do practice but the competition is the best
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let me just translate a couple of points for our Russian speakers, okay?
SPEAKER_02: The guys talked, Engin asked Alexey how the training was going, how the weights were going in the gym, how he felt behind the table. I'll shorten it a little bit, because we've been talking for a long time. Alexey answered that the weights were going a little bit in the gym. In my favorite exercises, he raised his personal records, as far as I understand.
SPEAKER_02: They tried it at the table, but there was no good competition, no rivals. We used different methods, someone was holding a pillow with both hands, to compare the levers. It's not bad at all, but of course there wasn't enough of those ready-go competitive judges to do it properly.
SPEAKER_02: Alex, is there a part where you turn your phone sideways?
SPEAKER_00: Artem, how do you see your own form? Like Alex explained, you know, his form and how do you see your form compared to your stomach issue? Like where are you now? 80% maybe? Or where are you?
SPEAKER_04: I think before the training, I think, there was no form at all. There was, you know, a formless puddle. And in the mirror, in the reflection, it was not very much. There was somewhere 117-118 kilograms. And there was something extra on the stomach. Then I started to train slowly. Now I'm going to the neighboring town.
SPEAKER_04: to the coach who initially took me out. And we are gradually gaining. Now, I think, we are trying to add as much as possible, but such workouts that the hands hurt, well, not injuries, just from overload. And most often we use a percentage there, somewhere light, somewhere add, somewhere reduce.
SPEAKER_04: But we are constantly progressing. I think right now, if we take my current state, I think 80% is there.
SPEAKER_02: uh so yeah i'm saying that uh training is going very well uh before he started training uh you know at the moment of the thickness when the stomach was bad he said the scale didn't look good 116 117 kilos and he said that uh you know reflection in the mirror did not look too good too uh so he said was you know
SPEAKER_02: skinny and something on the stomach and not not where it's supposed to be and it didn't look good but he said that he is constantly gaining and they are training with his trainer which is which is uh the neighboring city but not too far from him he is going there to him and they are they are working with uh relatively light weights but it's constantly growing and he thinks that at the moment he's about 80 percent from his best shape
SPEAKER_04: And did he say, you know, what he is planning to be? Not yet, I will ask. Artem, plans to come to the event, how much percentage do you think you will have, what plan? Well, I think, I said that for today, 80%. 80%, yes, I translated it like that. Well, I just didn't leave after yesterday's training. I think when I leave, I will recover and closer to the competitions,
SPEAKER_04: We'll finish the weights, we'll get to our maximum, then we'll rest and work on the table. I think it will be 100%. As far as I can, it will be 100%. What about your best form? You know, my best form is...
SPEAKER_02: I don't know. I understand. Artyom said 80% as of right now. He said, I'm still sore after yesterday's training. He said that if the plan will go well, whatever they planned, he said he will be close to 100% at the moment. That's what I was guessing.
SPEAKER_00: i don't think that after the last experience i don't think that he would come here ready for a world title match you know and yeah that that's that's good to hear the athlete will be ready it's good to hear that scales are not showing alex's weight anymore and yeah that means that means that we are gonna witness a great event um alex who do you think is the
SPEAKER_00: uh contender you know to the winner of this match like who do you think that is like good enough you know right now but is not there yet because didn't pull enough like what do you think about it like is that anyone that deserves to pull this world title match you know uh outside you know
SPEAKER_01: You mean, don't count us, but somebody else who also... Yes, yes, you too deserve, you too deserve, you know. I wouldn't say too much if I didn't think you guys didn't deserve. But other than that, is there anyone that... You know, one tall guy, one tall guy, I think... Almost as tall as you? As tall as you? Even a little bit taller than me, I know that he wants this title, but I will tell that it will be not so easy, I think, to get this title.
SPEAKER_00: And is this the guy that, you know, people are saying that, you know, he, in fact, you know, is the best right now, but he still doesn't have the chance? Is this that guy, Vitaly Laletin, we are talking about? Yes, yes. And do you agree with all the other people that are saying that, you know, it should be Vitaly? I would say that he deserved, I mean, to be like the guy who, like, really won this title. To pull, to pull. He deserved, he deserved to...
SPEAKER_00: pull on on this shot on the highest level and i know that he really wants so it's like unavictable the fights yeah definitely but but him to deserve the title deserving the title match and deserving the title are two different things so you are basically saying that he needs to
SPEAKER_01: come and prove that he deserves the title you know it's not that easy you are saying this is what i understand from what you just said a while ago you know i i would say one thing that i remember because i remember correctly that we have legacy hammer yeah yeah and the owner actual owner said that he will give
SPEAKER_01: To Vitaly. So, potentially we have the chance in the future, in the upcoming future, a winner with a belt and a winner with a hammer. And then the winner will have both of them, right? Yes. Another thing, Artem, how many world title matches do you want at the East vs. West? Two, right?
SPEAKER_00: yes yes and if you win this match you're gonna have the belt permanently you know because it's three times yeah um on on the night of january 20th uh are you gonna have the belt permanently are you gonna take that to kazakhstan forever
SPEAKER_04: I wanted to say I'm a religious person, but I won't. I'm not responsible for that. We'll see. We'll see how it goes. I'll be hoping. I really want that. We'll see how the card goes, how the table shows, how mom says, how the coach says. And again, Artem says that yes, he really, really wants it, but we will see at the table. Table will show.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, that is good. Engin, once when I talked too much, I couldn't do anything. That's why I decided to stick to old traditions. Artem said, Engin, one time I already talked too much and it didn't work well. So now I will be a little bit quieter.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, so you just want to, you know, there are some people, Artem, talking and winning. Do you know the guy's name lately? He says there are people who are always trending and still winning. He says, do you know who it is? No, I know, but we kind of...
SPEAKER_00: I know who's dead, but here in Kazakhstan, it's not acceptable. We don't do that stuff here. Oh, okay. Okay. I understand. Yeah. Yeah. And Alex, is this guy taking the belt to Kazakhstan?
SPEAKER_01: I like this guy. I respect this guy. This guy definitely deserves my respect. And he's really achieved this right to be number one for now. But it will be after the match with me. We will see 20th of January. You said again the last phrase? If it will be the same, we will see the 20th of January.
SPEAKER_00: I said before he deserved to be number one, but what will be after? We all know that we will see if he deserves or not on January 20th. But I'm just asking your opinion. We know that if he wins or not, we will see on January 20th. But what is your opinion? You know, to be objective, I like Artem Mech.
SPEAKER_01: Not only about his power, but about his style. For example, with Dadikyan, remember these matches on the left, he was lose, lose second match. And after that, he was like, everyone already was thinking that he's dumb. And he was able to find the key and to find something in his character. And after that, in the end of the match, he was winner. And he did it not only once.
SPEAKER_01: did it a couple of times so i think this artem is uh guys who have couple of surprises in uh his own and uh it's not only like to be just more powerful than artem you just also need to be a little bit more smart or more experienced or also have some secrets to one without resorting so i believe
SPEAKER_00: i believe that you are you are confident with yourself you know you you want it because for one year one year you wanted to pull our term for one year every time i offer you someone else you said i want our tone that's because i like him okay okay okay i i i realize that both of you don't want to
SPEAKER_00: like talk too big and like and then just want to do the job on the on january 20 then as a promoter i'm trying to steer the pot but i i'm unsuccessful as on air but it's okay you know let me translate real fast what uh okay uh
SPEAKER_02: And Alexey said, listen, Ilya Artyomov will take the belt with him, we'll see how it goes on January 20th. But he's a worthy opponent, look at how he fought in his last matches. And there was also a very interesting match with Dedekian. Everyone thought that he was done, he was ready, but no, he said he found it.
SPEAKER_02: He turned around and said, listen, a serious opponent with surprises, it's not enough to be stronger than Artem to win. You need to have more experience, you need to have your own surprises, then you can fight on equal terms and win. And it just won't work that way. So we'll see on January 20th and see.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, there is a super chat.
SPEAKER_00: the unsung hero of these interviews is the most intimidating and capable translator paulo looking forward to east versus west 11 gentlemen thank you for your super chat yeah i agree with you about paul um another one we have is ibrahim cemlal um hello engin i hope you are doing well i remember
SPEAKER_00: Okay, remember my name because I'm coming next year for arm fights in Europe. Yeah, I will remember you. And I wish you the best. Yep. So let's see. Let's see. And Artem, how do you find Alex stylistically? You know, we all know that he has a very strong top role and
SPEAKER_00: Can you say, Alex, your left arm is better than your right arm or is equally the same? It's like when I pull, I actually not left-handed, but left always doing better than right. Right have some troubles and left has more stability. Do you know why, Alex? I'm also right arm guy, but I want world titles almost same numbers, right and left.
SPEAKER_00: um because there are like many more right arm guys in the world right arm competition is usually a little bit tougher because there are more of the stronger you know like strong right arms and less older so when when you are like someone who is right and left is
SPEAKER_00: like almost the same and then you are more successful because the left arm competition is a little bit lower compared to the right arm and and then this is the same for the practice too when you practice you are always working in a positive way because you know your left is as good as your right you know and then with while your right arm you always have
SPEAKER_00: like i'm talking about when we are growing you know becoming anonymous with left arm you are always controlling always dominating you know always working in a positive way while you know with the other one it is just sometimes you are even in a position that it is not really how to say uh pleasure to be in but the thing is that you are getting stronger stronger
SPEAKER_00: and this is becoming more technical because he is just all the time having the control and easier competition level maybe that that may be the case you know i don't know if you agree or not yeah i agree let me translate hold on let me translate
SPEAKER_02: Artyom, we had a question for you first, then we started discussing it. I'm going to cut it short now. The question was, how do you find Alex's style? We know that Alex has a very good taproll, and how do you think the match will be stylistically? And then we started discussing why Alexey Engin said, your left is better than your right.
SPEAKER_02: Lyosha says, well, not that they are better, they can be about the same, but in competitions the left one turns out to be better.
SPEAKER_02: And Engin tried to explain to us why this is happening. Maybe because if you have two hands that are about the same strength, then the competition on the left hand is usually a little less than on the right, because most of the right-handed people. But if physically, I have the same thing, the left and right are about the same,
SPEAKER_02: then with the left hand in the ranking, you will probably even climb higher than the right one, because there are fewer competitors. And now answer the question, what do you think about the match and about Lesha Toprov? Well, I also noticed that Alexey on the left fights much better than the right one. Well, again, Engin answered this question.
SPEAKER_04: He has a very strong upper body. To be honest, I don't know how strong he is, because I haven't seen his workouts, for example, I haven't seen his weight, I haven't fought with him at the table, I haven't stood. And I think that even if his hook is weak, for example, then I think it's not a problem with his weight. You can torture the biceps in the hook, but in any case it's strong.
SPEAKER_04: Even with a stretched angle, it will be difficult. Well, it will be visible there. We need to be prepared for everything. I think there will be a fight. I myself am interested. By the way, it has always been interesting for me to fight Alexey.
SPEAKER_02: okay yeah the answer was uh yeah i know that uh alex's top role is uh known and very strong he said i don't know how strong and uh because we never never before but he said that even if his let's say hook is weak with the strength of his bicep and his body weight it's it's gonna be uh you know
SPEAKER_02: top level anyway very strong and he said that uh very interesting match and artyom is interested himself uh how it will go and uh he believes it's going to be a very nice war we will see we will see i i know think that it depending on the position if it goes to inside i think that morozov has more chance but if it if it somehow he cannot hook
SPEAKER_00: Alex, then it will be a very hard day for Artem. But as an organizer, I don't have any prediction for this event. And we will see. And so basically, so you guys are here. The winner of this match is going to face Vitaly Laletin. Agreed already? Yes.
SPEAKER_00: yes okay okay so about the dates i mean it can be talked later yeah and then we will find and then another giant will be coming soon looks like Levon Saginashvili he had some therapy on his left side if his left arm is also getting better then you guys will have
SPEAKER_00: another guy to the party, you know, and let's see how it will be. Yeah, Artom, this match is very, very important for you, this match. Because after this match, because this is your match to get that belt permanently. After this match, there will be more guys in the party.
SPEAKER_02: Artyom says, this match is very important for you, because then you will keep your champion belt forever. But after this match, there will also be a lot more people in this holiday. Vitaly will probably fight the winner of this match. And Levan seems to be coming back from the left side, because he received a certain therapy.
SPEAKER_02: And maybe he'll come back with his left hand. So, will you have fun, guys? Let's start with Vitalik and Levan. And I'll prepare.
SPEAKER_02: Can you please put Vitaly against Levan first? And in the meantime, guys will train a little more. No, I'm just a little bit... I just said it like that, a little bit impudently. I mean, if I manage to win, then... I'm a little bit... Alexey, I'm sorry, I'm just... Dreams, dreams. I translated correctly, don't worry, I covered you.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, what was the last part? He said, I'm sorry because I said, Artyom said, and I will train a little more, but I know exactly what he meant and I translated that we train a little more. Okay, yeah, yeah. And Alex doesn't need it, right? Alex, you're ready.
SPEAKER_00: I'm happy to pull with everyone if you ask about that. Yeah. I mean, I love that, you know, I love that, you know, because as I say, always like we have one world and when we talk about world title,
SPEAKER_00: we would like everyone to be in the same playground, you know, and then the guy can say, I'm the best, you understand? I don't like when everyone is playing somewhere else and saying that I'm the best. The other guy say, I'm the best. Okay, let's pull. No, we cannot pull because we are, we cannot, you know, we are not allowed to pull, you know? So that is why I wanted to secure that, you know, we are all in the same,
SPEAKER_02: playground you know and okay so I have a question can I can I ask a question uh I'm sorry I know I'm translator but I have a question uh so this is East versus East match or Alex yeah okay yeah yeah so Vitaly and Levon is East also right who's gonna represent West
SPEAKER_00: No, no, no, no. Listen, listen, listen. Even from the first East versus West, we always had East versus East matches. When I pulled Arthur Makaro, I mean, East versus East, you know. I mean, the matches has never been the whole card is the East versus West, you know. Like the second event, just remember, like Oleg Zogpul, Betkili, Oniyani, you know, he was also the same.
SPEAKER_00: like i know rebecca from slovakia was 65 kilo world champion fear was 70 kilo still you know so it is like more likely name we are trying to make as much as possible east versus west but you know i mean how about how about incorporating devon's left in this party let him lose a little bit
SPEAKER_01: i mean you are not gonna you are not look look at look at that how happy are they i think she's like come here i just appreciate these jokes devon we need you we need you for the left just come back to east to the left you know it's going to be interesting it's going to be east versus west and uh finally devon will lose to somebody because come on
SPEAKER_00: how do you know maybe he's just gonna destroy all of these guys you know with left let him prove yeah but when you say like Peru you know I I don't even think he has such a goal maybe 115 kilo 115 kilo maybe matushenko maybe dadikian prudnik maybe he would even go 105 kilo yeah we don't know yet but right now he is busy he is busy with the biggest mountain on the earth yeah
SPEAKER_00: yeah we will see we will see during his preparation to the biggest monster on the right he can pull a little you know party arm left i don't think he wants it he he just wants to he he told me that he is gonna be like a priest
SPEAKER_00: till the uh this match and i said priest priest doesn't talk you know but he's like in horror and yeah we all see but the guy is seriously i don't know about his left hand but right arm
SPEAKER_02: Day by day, he's proving that he's the real deal. He's very, very strong. Let me real quick translate myself and the whole conversation. Just the bullet points. Okay, yeah. We joked a bit and talked a bit, but every joke is just a part of a joke. I say, listen, it's all East with East. When we invite someone from the West, let's bring your Larratt there.
SPEAKER_02: We were a bit disappointed, because Larratt is not bad with his left hand, but he's probably not at the level to fight in heavyweights. Engin says he's focused on his right hand, he's preparing for Levan, and he probably doesn't want to fight with his left hand, so forget it.
SPEAKER_00: we will see okay let's let's let's talk about uh the event guys um a few things i want to say the one of them is the the east versus west 11 the vip sponsorship right now is available
SPEAKER_00: and also we have the yearly membership normally for events is almost 80 you know 79.96 and when you do the yearly membership it is there is like 10 discount and it is 69.99 and yeah and also yeah let's talk let's talk a little bit about the matches and then i want to ask as i see that they are not going to
SPEAKER_00: uh talk much about uh the match that is upcoming because they both want to do the job as far as i see they don't want to do any kind of trash talk and i respect that yeah
SPEAKER_00: and i don't want to push so much uh let's see here we can start with the matches okay this one uh i just want a name i don't want any kind of detail you know uh about the prediction
SPEAKER_00: And only name. I don't want to hear anything else. Alex Kurdecha versus Artem Morozov. Alex, what's your prediction? It's not a question for me. You know, never ask a guy who competes. You know the answer. Yeah, I know the answer. But some people say it goes like 50-50. You know, they say 50-50. And so I just want to do...
SPEAKER_00: Okay, so you say you're gonna beat him. Okay. Oh, finally, I found something, you know. Yeah. And Artem, you? The strongest will win. Oh, okay. And who is that guy?
SPEAKER_00: he said in the name there is a letter a oh there is letter a in the name like oh okay okay so they both will win yes okay that's good that's good and let's start with the
SPEAKER_00: ones that are really really really interesting yours is interesting too but it's about you so hutchings touching sources i put like slight favorite hutchins because of his last matches so you are saying that hutchings uh is the favorite
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, slight favorite. But because of his match with Kadyr Ghalib, which was amazing, with Sago, which was really surprised, I put like slight favorite Hutchins. Artyom is going to say Dadikyan is going to win, probably. Artyom, what do you think, Hutchins or Dadikyan? Well, I'm going to root for David, of course, but I understand that it's not going to be an easy fight.
SPEAKER_04: Alexey was right, considering the last match of Toda Hutchings against Kader Ghalib. I will be rooting for David, and I bet more on him. He has speed. Toda Hutchings' age and speed are not the same. Plus, the last fight was hard.
SPEAKER_02: And I don't know how he recovered after that or not. I don't know how he recovered. I fought him a week ago. I was crazy. Well, it doesn't matter. I won't interfere with your predictions. Okay, so I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. I know I'm a translator, but I cannot... No, no, you are not a translator. You are one of the guests, you know. I'm participating.
SPEAKER_02: uh so yes artyom said that uh he for sure will cheer for his uh teammate for the decan and he said i believe i believe that his speed may help but this is very very tough match and especially after the last match we saw uh against kidder billy is that very tough but he said obviously i'm cheering for uh david and he said again that uh you know
SPEAKER_02: todd hutchins uh doesn't have that speed anymore and he is aged his age is you know very serious and we don't know if he's uh completely recovered from the very hard kidder gali match and i stick my five cents in it and like yes he is because i did him a week ago and that was something different for out of this world yes yeah yeah he's not he's not yeah he's different yeah right
SPEAKER_01: And John Burzing versus Krasimir. Kostadino, Alex. You know, I always buy my heart with John. I don't care about results. I will be cheering John. I also respect Krasimir, but John is very special for me because I begin arm wrestling because of John and such guys. So I cheer him, John. Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_04: And he's also originally from the same country as you are, right? Yes, yes, that's true. And Artyom? John Krasimir? What's the weight? 105 kg. He said, I think John will win.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, so if it was 95 kilo, he wouldn't be sure, but for 105 kilo, he thinks that John is, yeah, I understand. Yeah, John kind of looks small when he went down to 95 kilo, yeah. At that age, you know, when you are not explosive, it doesn't really help a lot. Ali Can Muradov, Evgeny Prudnik, Muradov, you start this time.
SPEAKER_04: Artyom said that because of the speed and his insane side pressure, Alizhan will win.
SPEAKER_00: I was thinking the same way when Prudnik pulled against Dadikyan. His speed and incredible side pressure, but somehow Prudnik was able to stop him. What does he think about this? Dadikyan is also similar to Ali Can, but Prudnik was able to stop him.
SPEAKER_04: Do you understand what he says? He says, I also thought so before Dikyan and Prudnik fought, but then he says, well, you see, it didn't work out the way I thought. Well, here, you know, I trained with David too, right? I know what his strength is in the side movement. He doesn't have that... He has a good explosion, good traction, but it's the side movement
SPEAKER_04: not as strong as, for example, Alizhan's. It can be seen. David is stronger at some points, but it is the side movement, this rib, this triceps is stronger for Alizhan.
SPEAKER_02: uh i'm saying that uh he's been the training with daddy can too and he said that yes there is explosiveness and uh you know the back pressure is very good but side pressure he believes that alijan has a greater side pressure i understand so he he thinks so yeah
SPEAKER_00: Artur, one more question. How would you rank the level of this match? I mean, to me, I cannot just imagine anything better than this, you know, a deadweight category, you know, like with that arm, you know.
SPEAKER_02: What do you think, how high do you think this match will go? Because Engin says, for me, there is nothing more interesting than this match in this weight category. It's very interesting for me. And what do you think? I'm also very interested, because I don't know what form Prudnik will be in, but I know what Olezhan will be in.
SPEAKER_04: will be better than before. Better than David or Tobias. I think it will be very interesting. Artyom says that it will be very interesting if
SPEAKER_01: Evgeny Prudnik will bring a better form than his previous matches. Then it will be very, very interesting because he knows exactly what Alezhan is bringing there. And you, Alex? I agree with Artem about that it will be a tough match for both of them. It will be not easy for both. I don't see one-sided winner in these matches. Obviously, there will be a real war on the table.
SPEAKER_01: And it depends on the motivation of Rudny. If he's motivated enough. I believe and I remember that Rudny is also the guy who has some surprises in his own. Yes, yes, yes. I never thought that he would beat that again. I was like, no way, you know. But he really stopped him and won, you know.
SPEAKER_01: And now he has also more time to prepare himself for this match, because I believe that even that day with Dedekian, probably according to what I hear from the guys who trained with Prudnik, that it was not his top shape. So if now he will be better, it will be a really interesting match. And I even put Prudnik like a favorite because of his endurance, if they both have inside.
SPEAKER_00: brutnik some time before won the matches which everyone think he should lose and he wanted the matches so you know this this match can i make the poll poll on youtube he was favored like 73 percent or something i was like i mean yeah he may win but he's not that heavily favored the match is ready do you expect this match to finish quick
SPEAKER_00: Or do you expect this match to have a war until like one of them will lose? Like do you think that any of them will beat each other because of speed or power dominance? Or you think that this match will be up to endurance? Like one of them will be finally tired and then the other. I kind of think that this will be a bread cutting match. This is my opinion. You ask me or Artem? No, I ask you.
SPEAKER_00: so i need to ask artem before answering these questions did alijan when he pulled with before he was in the best shape or he will be best shape only now i think lately he is in incredible shape i mean because he won two 2022 waffles in supreme weight category and same this year 2023 i mean the guy is just like like like a train you know just
SPEAKER_00: so it should be really war it will be very interesting i believe that both of them will be in the best shapes it will be definitely very unpredictable so endurance game huh endurance game i believe yes yeah okay and and these these matches what are your uh opinions uh paulo uh i'm not gonna ask alex versus artom i don't want to put you in hard time front of these guys
SPEAKER_02: This Alex versus Artyom is unpredictable. If those two, they're both my friends. And if those two would pull every East versus West with different opponents, it would be predictable. I wouldn't give you my prediction. I have no problems with that. But as of right now, it's unpredictable.
SPEAKER_02: We don't know. We don't know how Artyom came back from his health problems. We don't know how Alex came back from his break. We don't know that. Unpredictable. I want to see it. I agree. And the John Vizcarrazi? John Vizcarrazi, I believe John will do it. One of five, he will restore his power, he will do it. Ali Can versus Purnik?
SPEAKER_02: I would give slight H to Prudnik because of endurance. And I'm sure that Prudnik have enough power to stop the match. After I saw Cody and Alijan, I believe that Prudnik have favored. I mean, 55 to 45, maybe. What do you mean after you saw Alijan and Cody? What was wrong with the match that you gave? What did you see negative with Alijan that you gave to Prudnik? Because...
SPEAKER_00: uh he doesn't have enough power he doesn't have enough power to finish prudnik fast that's my personal opinion yeah but what is going outside i'm not saying he can but i i don't know how you do the judgment because of that match because it is cody is pulling very
SPEAKER_00: strong back pressure yeah to to get him but I don't think he has that able he will not have to try to stop a top role but just he will just go the side way you know directly I'm not saying that he has power but that match
SPEAKER_02: didn't seem to me like the perfect example to compare Kody and... I'm just trying to figure out the power of Alisson. His speed and stylistically he is amazing, but I'm talking right now about amount of power to push Prudnik to pin pad.
SPEAKER_00: And I believe the match will stop. And if the match will stop, which I think the case, Frutnik will out in Durham. The first time I remember Alican was 2017 WAF. I had a student, Mohamed. They had a final left arm, 80 kilo. And they also had a match in the qualification rounds. Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_00: together it was like three minutes or something you know so alijan do you remember alijan he also had a war with uh petrenko and he also have very good endurance so i think that it will be very long match two minute match if it is like a two minute match or something i won't be surprised yeah me too me too very interesting match but i would give a slight edge to your game yeah yeah yeah
SPEAKER_00: No, don't get me wrong. I don't have anything. I'm just trying to discuss. Yeah, figure out. Yeah, yeah. And let's go to another one. And a little bit crazy match. Matt Mask versus Wagner, but with right arm. Bravo. Here, I think Matt Mask will win. Artem thinks Matt Mask will win.
SPEAKER_00: i think the table will lose that table will be broken that worries me that worries me i think i it's not a joke you know i think i should bring there like something extra right yeah you have an extra you have to say they for sure check the strength of the table until 100 limits for sure and it is all about wagner now matt is just slapping you know wagner
SPEAKER_00: i mean we need to talk with you remember at the press conference i told wagner don't do that okay he's like yeah yeah the next thing he just shake in the old like the riser on the you know feed everything was i was like what did you do you know he's like you know sorry he really loses himself you know
SPEAKER_00: yeah i think yes okay i think matt i i think matt mask will win right hand but do you think that do you think that he will have arm to finish him if he goes to flop pressure yeah yeah i think so and alex how do you see that match like other than the table loser being loser um i think if it will goes outside because of speed of matt um yeah
SPEAKER_00: I would not want to say 50-50, but I would say like 51 for Matt. Okay, so you also think that, you know, it is going to be Matt's match. Okay, so this one is interesting. This one, people, some people think it's great, great, great. And some people think that, you know...
SPEAKER_00: Ivan is going to dominate. Ivan Matushenko versus Rino Macic. Rino Macic is the current world champion with left arm in 100 kilo Waf. And he is the current Waf champion. And while Ivan was the world champion before, you know, his team couldn't like when he was like still competing, you know, so
SPEAKER_00: What do you guys think about this match? And then there are some criticism like, oh, give Ivan a better match, you know, this and that, you know. Ivan doesn't want to pull top 10 super heavyweight guys. And there are some guys that are outside of top 10, but they are like not available, like Corey West, you understand? And then there are some other guys. And in 115 kg,
SPEAKER_00: Just, Alex, who would you, or Paolo, who would you set Ivan Matusenko right now? Like, who would you? Devon is the super. And then, Prudnik and Ali Can are pulling in 105. Dadikian's left arm is injured. You? This is what you're saying? You? No, Prudnik, give Prudnik the second match. Not me. No, no, that's for sure. The winner of this is, I understand that part. But what I'm saying, as of now,
SPEAKER_00: I mean, there are not many in 115 kg. Not many. There are some guys, but... What about Sandris Chedis? Sandris is injured, but Reno beat him with left arm. Yeah, Reno beat him with left arm. So, what I just say... Yeah, it's a little tough. Yeah, you're right.
SPEAKER_01: yeah but but i saw i have been really obedient is one of the smartest guys really one of the smartest guys he if you watch on his uh methodology of preparation you really understand arm wrestling you really understand the meaning of the movements and the effectiveness of training
SPEAKER_01: And I'm really happy that the guys from Russia don't go to to even train together because he become the very strong team, which will be the trouble for everyone. You know, Ivan is like one of the most experienced and really one of the best guy who make a good and right conclusions from his exercise. And I believe
SPEAKER_01: like i said before he's very successful with his methodology he really understand what to do to be better and i in this match with big respect to reno and he's definitely rising star he's also very smart but in this match i probably put matushenko like a favorite i understand but whenever i saw reno like i have seen him beating krasimir
SPEAKER_00: And I have seen Krasimir beating Ivan, even with left arm. Ivan has beaten him as well. But what I'm just saying, I wouldn't underestimate Reno. And like there are many times that whenever I organize a match at East versus West, like John was like 80% favored against Sasho.
SPEAKER_00: I think Ivan will win 100% against Rima. Rima is still young.
SPEAKER_04: He will not pass the top 100%, because as Arsen Liliyev said last time, Ivan's wrist closes in any case, even if the top fighter fights against him, it closes. In the process, of course, it can open for him. With those who fight in triceps, as we see, Ivan has no problems at all. So I think that Ivan
SPEAKER_02: What's that? Okay, yeah. And he said that he's 100% sure that Ivan will win because it's impossible to top-roll Ivan because, as Arsene Leliev said, that his copying will be closed anyway in any circumstances. So he believes that he's a heavy favorite and he will win. And you? I...
SPEAKER_02: i think that matushenko is heavy favorite but i would not be very much surprised if our raising star rising star will uh do something very interesting to that i want to see that match because uh reno is very impressive very impressed so i want to see that match for sure i believe that matushenko is a heavy favorite yeah yeah yeah
SPEAKER_00: And let's go to another match. Pauline versus Irakli Zrakashvili. Let's start with Alex. I like Pauline. Oh, one second, one second. We didn't ask you about Rino versus Ivan. Or you said Ivan? No, no, I said it before. You said, yeah, okay, okay, yeah. Like, I like Paul, really like. He's a humble, nice guy, really nice. And it's cool that we have him in our basketball.
SPEAKER_01: And with Irakli, he was present on our Sicilian trip last time, not so long ago, and I saw his shape. And I will put Irakli. So Irakli is going to win, in your opinion? Yeah. And Morozov? I also think that Irakli will be easier here.
SPEAKER_02: Artyom saying that he also thinks that Irakli most likely will win.
SPEAKER_02: And you, Pavel? Okay, I have my opinion. I think that Irakli is slightly favorite in this also, but Pauline is my teammate and my friend. I really think that Irakli is slight favorite. There is only but. I thought so when he was Paul Rustam Babaev. And when in the last match, I understand that Rustam got injured, but we all saw that stop in the middle of the table.
SPEAKER_02: that he stopped him so in that moment i believe that paul is capable of doing a little bit more than we think he can so i very explosive very explosive yes that's exactly what it is so uh i would give a slight edge to iraqli because of his uh
SPEAKER_02: back pressure and ability of preparation for the special event. But I would not be surprised at all if Paul will stop him or give a very good match. I believe it's going to be a war about 3-2-2. And Alex, Artem Taino versus Zourab Taverize, left arm, 95 kilos. So Artem won a match with Sasha previously, yes, I'm correct? Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So I think because of that result, I would put Artem like a slight favorite because he's like a very good top rower. And I don't remember, Zurab probably can feel a little bit uncomfortable with somebody who's really fast on the start and very like hard on top row attack. Do you remember Efek Kömek and Zurab left arm match?
SPEAKER_00: no with with whom you know the turkish guy with the i think he took third place at the waf and very strong welcome yeah he toppled he's like he was 120 kilo a top roll but zura was able to um beat him uh that way without race you mean yeah with yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah like sasho sasho
SPEAKER_00: Artyom, how do you see this match? First of all, I'm very good friends with myself.
SPEAKER_04: Artem is more versatile. Zurab has a strong hook. But we know that he has problems with his biceps before the fight with Petrenko. He injured his biceps, tore it off. If, of course, he healed all this and prepared, it will be very interesting. I think 50 to 50.
SPEAKER_02: Artem really thinks that this one about 50-50 because, yeah, Tainov have a very good top roll and Zurab have very good hook. He said that I remember that he has some issues with his left bicep. But if there is no injuries anymore, if everything healed, that he said that 50-50, it's very, very interesting match. And in your opinion?
SPEAKER_02: Same way, same as Artyom. I want to see it. I believe that Zurab is leveled up. I would give it to Artyom Tainov before, maybe a few months before, but I saw how Zurab training his left right now. I'm following him on social medias. This is insane. This is very impressive. So I want to see this match. I wouldn't say who is the favorite. It's like 50-50 to me. And Daniel Prokopchuk-Mindaugas.
SPEAKER_01: Alex, world titles. In this card, we have eight world title matches. Both guys are amazing. First of all, I need to say both are really cool, best of kind of human being in the reality of our missing world. And, you know, for me, I will put Daniel. But I don't think it will be easy match. But Daniel is favorite for me.
SPEAKER_04: Daniel? Artyom? Yes, I also think that Daniel has more chances here. Because I haven't seen Mindaugas have as many styles as Daniel has. And Daniel can fight and talk at the same time. It's very interesting to watch.
SPEAKER_02: He said that, yeah, that Daniel is a favorite and he said that he doesn't think that Mendoza has the same amount of styles as Daniel has. And also he said that Daniel can do a couple of few things in the same time. He can pull on a table and talk at the same time. Very interesting to see.
SPEAKER_02: yeah yeah yeah yeah they are there yeah they pull like million times but this this is the probably one of the most important meeting you know yeah yeah and your opinion i i think daniel is slight favorite but i love him dougas styles and i know how strong ming them in dougas is so i want to see the match but i would give a slight edge to daniel um alex do you know who vladimir miro is yeah
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, very strong. Very, very strong, seriously. And that is the next hope for our medicine community to defeat David Samusha. David just wants to put the record of the genius book.
SPEAKER_01: by defending of the title, so he will do it. Because he already... How many times he already defeated the title? He pulled six matches, all of them title matches, he won all of them in 85 kilos. So he for sure needs seven, so he will get seven. So you think he's gonna beat Mairo? He really wants to seven, so yeah. Even if he needs to do Miracle, he will do it. Okay, okay, okay, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: And do you know who Myro is, Artyom? To be honest, I haven't seen him for a very long time. I can't even remember.
SPEAKER_02: He said that he saw him a long time ago at Zloty, but he said, I'm sorry, but I don't even remember how he looks like and his style, so he cannot predict. And do you know him? No, I don't know him. Okay, let me ask you, Oleg Zloty... But I know who we need to stop Samusha.
SPEAKER_00: Morozov? No, Engin, you have to get back to it. You have to get back at it. Yeah, I was like, really, I was in good shape. It's just that the accident was really terrible. I thought that, like, my body gets just, like, pressed like this whenever I fall down. I think my upper body is heavy. It just hit the floor. Like, I was like, I thought I died, you know. Like, I was like, okay. But anyway, so... We have time, Engin. We will wait.
SPEAKER_00: No, no, I'm training. I'm training. I'm going to say I'm not going to give up. Oleg Dzok versus Avtangil Tutberidze. Avtangil Tutberidze is, I think, 19 years old, a Georgian guy with incredible top role. He just went to WAP Wars in Kazakhstan and he won the wars, 85 kilo, while Oleg Dzok won the 80 kilo world title.
SPEAKER_00: They both are top-rollers. We don't often see Oleg Zok getting beat by top-roll. How do you guys see this one? But probably you guys don't know about our time deal, but the guy is really, really strong guy. Any opinion or?
SPEAKER_02: I have an opinion, if you don't mind. If Oleg is facing a top-roller and his opponent doesn't have a good side and a high hook, then Jock will win. I never saw him beaten by pure top-roll, except maybe with Levan. Or maybe that he can match.
SPEAKER_02: Yes, yes. But Zadikant did not use a pure top roll against him. I think he did everything, I don't know. Side, mostly side, yeah. But top roll is not working against Zhokh because of his anatomy. And in our opinion... I agree with Pavel, because Zhokh has some peculiarities, because of which his opponents...
SPEAKER_04: It will be inconvenient for the opponent to tie up with him. And Oleg will always have a favorable position for himself. You can fight with him either by twisting him into a hook, or by punching sideways. Therefore, here I put more on Oleg.
SPEAKER_02: artyom said approximately that uh he's agree with my opinion and he said that because of his uh you know special build of his left arm uh that there is uh you know very uncomfortable for his opponent to be in a strap with him and there is only two basically only two options is a side or hook
SPEAKER_02: If Artem agrees with you, it means that Artem's English is getting better.
SPEAKER_00: Artem's English is actually very good. I'm chilling here and enjoying the conversation. I'm not really translating much. He understands, I think, like 99%. 99% he understands, yeah. And the last match is Aymeric Pradines. Or Pradines, I don't know how to pronounce. From France, very strong left arm. And he is against Robby Toppy. I'm sure you know Robby.
SPEAKER_01: and do you know aymeric yeah alex probably knows both guys you probably pablo you probably saw him but maybe not remember the name it's very strong guy from the france before he like he's thrown in the hoop oh i yeah i know who he is yeah yeah okay i know who he is okay and robin is going down i think they both will be around 231 not heavier and
SPEAKER_00: Robbie asked me to ask Aymeric winner takes it all and I said you ask I don't get any more with that one you know so Robbie looks very confident about his victory how do you see that match Alex maybe I ask you first and then we are finished for me honestly it's more
SPEAKER_01: for Amiric Pradinić, because if he's really in good shape, and I believe that if he takes the match, he's in good shape. He was like big names in the past, even in the practice table, even in the competition, he already proved his name, so probably it will be more for him.
SPEAKER_01: And maybe Roby will prepare something special and make a surprise for us. But for Roby, it will be more to make a surprise. And for Americk, it's more just to take his best shape and bring it to Istanbul. And do you have any opinion, Paolo? Before we finish, I want to ask.
SPEAKER_00: Devon shared the video. How do you call that? Sink, you call? That they both guys, you know, did you guys see the video that when after Levon put the belt around Devon?
SPEAKER_00: and then Lewand went side and at the same time they did like this to their nose and Devon thinks that this is a sign of like like uncomfortable moment and Devon is thinking that you know Devon is not comfortable Lewand to put the belt around him because while Lewand beat him 6-0 and probably Lewand is also not comfortable while like you know thinking that listen
SPEAKER_00: You know, like you can hold the belt temporarily for me, but I'm coming for it. You know, they belongs to me, you know? And okay. What's going to happen? What's going to happen? Who's going to win?
SPEAKER_02: Morozov, you start. You are sleepy. Before you fell asleep, it is almost... It is after midnight in Kazakhstan, yeah. Okay. Artem, do you understand that when Levan put his belt on him, they both felt uncomfortable because, well, we don't know exactly why, but Engin thinks that maybe Devon felt uncomfortable because he kind of lost to Levan, and now he has this...
SPEAKER_02: And Levan felt a little uncomfortable, because he was like, why is my belt put on someone else? The question is, what do you think will happen, what can happen in their fight? I don't know what will happen in their fight, but I know for sure that sooner or later the belt will be with another person.
SPEAKER_02: artyom says that he cannot uh say or predict what exactly gonna happen in this match but he said that uh sooner or later this belt will be at another guy is that guy a blonde hair and blue eye guy
SPEAKER_00: yes okay see see he can talk about far far far far future so sure but he cannot talk so sure about the message he has a month later you know okay
SPEAKER_04: Whose match will it be? Levan's and Devon's? Yes. Will it be in a month? No. Really? In April. I think Levan will win again. I think Levan will add cardio this time and win.
SPEAKER_02: yeah artyom says that you know it's understandable that uh levan is gonna win win again uh and levan will add a little cardio to his uh incorporate little cardio to his training process and he will win again alex
SPEAKER_01: I so like the previous version of answering by Artem on your question. I really want to repeat that next year, maybe the year will bring all us surprise and the belt goes to another man, not Levan and not Trevor. See, I loved it. I loved it. We are asking them who's going to win and they both are like, we don't care about their dreams. We care about our dreams and it's going to go. And I loved it.
SPEAKER_00: i love that you know they don't they are not like you know this guy is so big we cannot beat or something see that dream i respect the most you know i mean they can do it or they cannot do it to have that goal and dream it's just i so much respect i hate when the guys are like you know oh i cannot do that it's too big too strong you know and yeah that is already you know
SPEAKER_00: then i mean just quit man if you don't have a big dream just quit it's good congratulations to you guys seriously and and and and you paulo
SPEAKER_02: don't tell me that you know it's gonna the belt is gonna go to you now this belt is not going to me uh no but uh i believe that yes levan will have to uh do a little more special preparation for devon this time because devon is changing very much and he is uh different and he approached things differently so i believe that levan is favorite but he will have to do extra work
SPEAKER_02: this time if he will come uh in the same shape as he came to uh uh hermes in dubai he will lose he cannot do that yes if he comes to the devon devon shape they will match shape then it is closed so you are saying that to secure the win he needs to come even better shape than before yes yes he will have to step up yes and the last question
SPEAKER_00: Alex, can Devon beat you with left arm? You know, I will not answer it on this question because both of us, I mean me and Devon, know the answer. Okay. Listen, listen, listen. When you say this, even this is like more clear than the answer, you know, like only Adam wouldn't get it, you know, like, so we got it, you know.
SPEAKER_02: No, no, I have an answer. Devon cannot beat Alex's left arm. Yeah? No, absolutely not. Okay. How do you know that? I pulled Devon on the side table. And did you pull Alex?
SPEAKER_02: did not pull uh by the way i want to pull alex and i want to put paul artyom so whoever moves in this match give me that match left 115 kg or the supra weight whatever okay okay because because alex needs a long long time to die at 215 but so yeah i don't want to go there don't go there don't go there and that's fine i will step up with a weight class no problem one thing one thing paulo paulo
SPEAKER_00: Are you serious? Absolutely. I'm not going to set you the winner of this match, but if you are that comfortable with your left arm, then we can do something about 115 kg. But did you not lose to Lachlan's left arm? I did. How are you going to beat him then? Are you now much better?
SPEAKER_00: oh yeah like where are you right now like who did you beat lately left arm just no i'm just asking to understand you know like like because maybe we should set you up i'm ranked i'm ranked at super heavyweight in usa number three after cody married and uh and and then there's the one one category below do you have two categories
SPEAKER_02: 250 category, we're not ranking here. So I'm ranked number... 240? 242, I'm ranked number two. Who's number one? Marcio. Marcio, okay. But did you pull against him or it's just like a... Not left hand. Not left hand. Okay. So I won with Michael Todd left and I won with Ryan Esprit left with super heavies.
SPEAKER_00: Oh yeah, those are good ones. And your left arm you think is better than your right arm? Maybe a little bit better or at least the same. But in some positions it's better. Okay, so we need a match for you for 115 kg category. Just forget about these big guys. You don't want to embarrass them. They are huge guys. Just don't beat them. Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Anyways, guys, thank you very much. Artem, thank you once again. You came. And Alex, it was great to see you, man. And we will be very, very happy to see you on that stage, such a giant as yourself. And just, sorry, I cannot finish it. Artem, are you intimidated that, you know, Alex's scale doesn't show his weight anymore?
SPEAKER_04: He says, well, Artyom, to be honest, I don't know if you're a little afraid that the scales don't even show Lesha's weight anymore. Well, I don't know, it's the other way around. Cody was also heavy. And who was that? Remind me. Corey West. Yes, yes. He was also very heavy, so it's not scary.
SPEAKER_02: Artyom says, you know what, no, it's a little bit stimulating me, yes, but I'm not intimidated or afraid by any means. He said, listen, Cody Merritt is very heavy and Cody West is even heavier, so it's okay, it's all good. Yeah, yeah, he pulled both of them, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: yeah anyway so once again thank you thank you alex and thank you paulo we miss you just and always great to see you here you are like your big part yeah absolutely thank you engine
