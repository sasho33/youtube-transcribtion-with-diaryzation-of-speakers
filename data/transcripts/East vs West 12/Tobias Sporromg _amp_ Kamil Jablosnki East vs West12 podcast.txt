SPEAKER_03: Berserker. Hello, Engin. Do you always have backup matches planned in case any match gets canceled? No. I just, whenever I hear and then quickly, I set in my mind, but then I need to ask the guys and then I ask them. I don't know. There is no event in June at East versus West. I don't know when Arsene will be available.
SPEAKER_03: Hello, Killzone. Hello. Hello to Azerbaijan, Revan. Can't wait for East versus West. This is a national holiday. It's going to be a great event. It's going to be a great event. Yeah. Hola, Luis. Hola, my friends. Where are you from? Brazil? I don't know. We will see, my friends.
SPEAKER_03: We'll see if Sporan will crush Kamil or Kamil will crush him. Time will show. Today, 27 days. Akis Stojkovic, I was hoping he's going to pull at the King of Tebuncun, Carolina. That match will most likely will happen in July in Istanbul.
SPEAKER_03: Have we announced who is the commentator announcers for this event yet? Travis is coming. Ramos will be here. And Neil Pickup will be here as well.
SPEAKER_03: Is this your favorite event so far, Engin? I mean, all of them are great. All of them are great. My judgment, an event, like how great it is, is usually after the event happens, you know, I just watch it. And then it's totally up to the matches, you know, how hard they are. But from outside looking, it looks like this may be the best. But who knows, you know. Biker Manish, greetings from Poland, Engin. Greetings to Poland, my friends.
SPEAKER_03: Hello, Umar Farooq. Love to Pakistan. Will you give your prediction about Dennis versus Ermes? I talked about that one, but I don't want to talk about the same thing every podcast. Hello, my friends. Yes, Ermes and Ali Can on Tuesday. Yeah, this is what they agreed. Any plans for your next match? No, I need to get informed first and then I will do it.
SPEAKER_03: Angie Todorovic. Who do you think will win between Prime Evgeny and Morozov? I think if Morozov in shape, I think Morozov probably, but who knows? Yeah. What do I think about Levan? Levan is the strongest armwrestler I've ever lived, in my opinion. Eliso. Gyorgy has very big, strong atlas to world records in Olympic lifting. Yes.
SPEAKER_03: If Alain Zola can get out of Russia, yes. But if not, then how can I say that much? Hello, Kamil. Hello. Good to see you, my friend. You hear me?
SPEAKER_03: You hear me? Yes, I can hear now. Can you hear me? Yeah, yeah, now I hear you, yeah. Yeah, I just first time using the Zoom on my phone and I have to install the microphone. That's good, that's good. I think very soon Tobias needs to be joining very soon as well. Okay. How are you, Engin?
SPEAKER_03: good good and you you you can you you you use it in the sideway right yeah sure i can i just yeah just to make sure that you know that there will be uh it will be fuller on the screen we are three only yep yep and so how is everything you are training without opponent lately and now this is happening and
SPEAKER_03: how do you feel you said you were training pronator but now you are switching to inside again you said what did you say you said 90 right now you're inside the pressure the shoulder pressure no to be honest uh
SPEAKER_04: I training the side pressure and the press like last five years. So I am all the time pretty good. But that's what I mentioned to you about 90%. That's how I checked and is going pretty well. So probably, even if I will do 100%, probably I can do it right now. Yeah, you know, usually after our super much I have in
SPEAKER_04: january so if you're giving rest that's what i done it's it's the best way to recover and come back to the to the best shape quickly yeah yeah yeah hello hello tobias tobias how is it to pronounce your name like tobias or tobias
SPEAKER_03: Tobias? Yes, yes, that's the right way. Because some people say something different. They call Tobias. Tobias, yeah, they say Tobias. It's not, right? It's not, right? No, no, it's not. But I mean, it's fine either way. It's fine, but I just didn't know which one. I would like to say the correct one if I can, of course. Yeah, it's Tobias. Yeah, Tobias, yeah. Todd and Olex Lovechild, the greatest promoter with the greatest pronator. He says, thank you very much.
SPEAKER_03: It is your kindness, yeah. We were talking about Kamil. Kamil said that last five years he has been doing all the press, side press, and then
SPEAKER_03: Lately he started to do pronation and then now when this match happened, probably he thinks that this is not super good idea to try to topple such a hand that like you have. And probably he started again the pressure and he said he's 90%, but he said that this was the first try. He feels like any moment, I don't think that he would go anywhere. Just you didn't recently train last five years when you train press, press, press.
SPEAKER_03: And then just say one month you train, the press is not going anywhere for sure. Even if it goes a little bit, it's going to come back in two weeks, I believe. Yeah, I agree. So, Tobias, you kind of...
SPEAKER_03: surprised me i don't know if you surprise other people as well but i was very surprised with your performance against wagner not because you won uh easily but i was surprised the way that you arm wrestle you know we we did talk tobias that we know is just you know
SPEAKER_03: going this way and then we saw like first round you just went straight through you know sideways and now your opponent is how do you compare Wagner
SPEAKER_03: and Kamil Wagner is more like if he can he likes to go that way while Kamil is you know he can also sacrifice his wrist and go I mean he can use his wrist as well but he can also do without wrist so how do you see these two athletes what is the difference what do you expect
SPEAKER_00: The difference right now at this moment, I think, is that Kamil is probably stronger than Wagner. Yeah. And I mean, it's the same style, maybe a little bit different, but yeah, I'm pretty sure he's stronger than Wagner. May he be also quicker? Yes. Yes, probably. So how do you see your chances in this match?
SPEAKER_00: That's always... I will try. I think I can win for sure because my development like this last year with more side pressure and overall strength. But you never know, as you know. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And so you decided to go more side way after Vitaly match?
SPEAKER_00: No, not really. I think it was because of Wagner's style with the press. So I tried to get him out of his strong position directly after the go. It's very different to face a hook puller compared to face a presser.
SPEAKER_03: So I feel comfortable facing pressers, but Kamen looks very strong. So that's the big question. The question is, did you need to pull against Wagner to improve your side pressure? What do you mean?
SPEAKER_00: Why haven't you trained? Did you really need to pull someone like Wagner to make your side pressure stronger? No, no, no. I've always trained my side pressure, but getting strong at this level, it takes time. And I feel like I reached the next level of strength like last year after Vitaly. I trained hard for a very long time. So I reached the next level.
SPEAKER_03: And were you surprised, before I ask to Kamil, were you surprised after meeting Vitaly? Did you think that, like, you were expecting this much strong? Were you surprised by his power? Yeah, very surprised. And I don't really think people understand his level.
SPEAKER_03: I think we need to see more of his left hand. I hope so. Soon? Yeah, I hope so. Soon. He and Levan, you know, Levan is also planning to make a comeback. Yeah, that's amazing. Yeah, it will be. So then we will realize, you know. And Kamil, were you surprised by Tobi's performance against Wagner? Yeah. Or were you expecting it?
SPEAKER_04: I think I was expecting because I think Tobias is really on the top. He's not like top 10 or something. When I watched his fight with Vitaly, this wasn't that big difference between them. He's giving nice stops on the losing position. I think Tobias is so strong.
SPEAKER_04: and but when he pulled wagner i see wagner had nothing to him basically nothing he even do a little bit false starts and tobias still take him back through his side pressure so and i think tobias will be very dangerous for me as well and you know i've got some experience already on the high level stage and i think this will help me a lot
SPEAKER_04: to set up properly with so strong guy like Tobias and just be ready with the fight. Because at the moment, I don't have much time to prepare properly, but my press is very strong, but the press is not the key. The key is the side pressure. If I win the side pressure, I'm not worried about the rest. I'm pretty sure I'll pin him.
SPEAKER_04: if I win the side pressure, if I win the center. So this will be the game for me to see how he will pull me with the high
SPEAKER_04: hand or low hand because i'm not sure what he will try to do to stop my when you say like high hand you're talking about his high hand or his low hand right no his high hand because for yeah yeah that's what i'm saying his high hand or his low hand yeah yeah because you know if i think if you hold so high you will be able to sleep if you hold so low yeah exactly if he go high he will let me go inside club press if he go low i think i will go
SPEAKER_04: inside with the wrist like a hook hook side pressure so i think i've got two options for him and the match will show how it go i am not i'm not worried about each of them because i train
SPEAKER_04: lot of supination and i'm ready to to supinate and i'm ready to go flop so you know i will see how it's going what will be the better but you know the key for me is the after ready go boom boom the first few centimeters there is no ready go as you know right just don't move yeah go yeah now i've got a little bit experience after ivan because
SPEAKER_04: first round I sleep, then second one I was slightly too fast, so now I need to just be ready perfectly. This will be the key. Same for every athlete. Everyone who comes there, they need to ready, go. Yeah. I was checking the power of my fingers on the flat piece of wood and it's actually at the moment I have
SPEAKER_04: my uh life record so i am pretty uh happy to test that as well on tobias if he will want to try go top roll i want i want to see if i can block him or i can't yet because you know usually i giving the wrist just to secure the center but i'm not afraid to to go inside with him and try hold his hand and and and see how
SPEAKER_04: powerful he is as well. So it will be very interesting match for me. You are saying that if he tapers you, you have this option. If he tries to hold on, you can even go inside with him. Yeah, you know, he is not that big like, let's say, Cody. I have a problem with Cody because his hand was bigger than mine.
SPEAKER_04: And I couldn't grab him properly. His hand was like, boom. And it's very difficult, especially if he go top roll. I was losing the wrist. So I have no choice. I have to give it to him. But I have stronger center of the hand. And I was taking him back to my side. So, you know, I'm not sure how big is Tobia's hand. I was feeling one time, but I just don't focus really. I don't know if I can grab him more or just little.
SPEAKER_03: Tobias, do you think that overpronating against someone like Kamil is a bad idea? It depends on how strong that person is in that position. Yeah, but we're talking about someone, Kamil, you know, like you have any estimation, any guess to overpronate? And like whenever you overpronate,
SPEAKER_03: then mostly your bicep is now loose. And then it's all about on the brachialis, which is not super strong, you know? Yeah. And do you think the overpronating is an option or you think that because of his press, it is like, you cannot avoid such thing or like, you don't even need to say this, this is like your strategy. You don't need to say, but at the end, you know, like,
SPEAKER_03: Just because somebody knows something, it doesn't mean that he can stop. Like whenever I invited here Minda Aguas for a Supermatch, we were sitting and eating. And I said, I exactly told him, this is what I will do to you. I will hold you and this and that. And I will attack right here, you know. And if you stop me, you stop me. If you are strong enough, you will stop me. If you are not strong enough, you are not going to stop me. But just because he knew, it didn't mean. So I beat him.
SPEAKER_03: Right and left 5-0, 5-0. So sometimes, you know, there is nothing like really super secret, you understand? Like we know what it is. Yeah. So what do you think about this? Do you think your strategy will be identical to do against what you did to Wagner? I don't think it will be that easy for me to win. I'm not really sure. The strategy will be the same. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe it will be different, but I, to be honest, need to feel it in the setup where he puts the pressure to me to make a decision. But I'm not really worried if I overpronate. I think it could be good even if I do that. But I know what you're talking about in this position. Because I can't use my side pressure if I overpronate. So it will be mostly on biceps. And that's, in general, bad for me.
SPEAKER_00: So that's why I train my side pressure. So I could not overpronate. So they get into my forearm instead, but still, still pronating to get control. But so. Pressure from this side as well, not only from thumb side, but you have pressure here and here, but, but, but you are not going to give up on your pronator. So basically you are saying that you will be ready for any,
SPEAKER_03: any case and you will decide whenever you feel his sense yeah yeah yeah i mean this is this is a match that like like going to the top this is a match if you are really targeting to become number one this is a match that you need to win i'm talking about both of you like this is like
SPEAKER_03: otherwise you will have to wait a little bit but if you win then it means that your climbing will be going so yeah so anything you guys want to add about this technical aspect coming or yeah basically um it's a long way for me to get a match on the left arm at east vs west because i won last qualification it was last year july
SPEAKER_04: and or may no i think july july so it's almost one year and i will really do my best to stay there so you know but you know the qualification qualification event was not guaranteed for the left arm it was right yeah but it's it's you know from my point of view is like i am back because i show my research there and uh yeah and basically my left arm is
SPEAKER_04: very uh like no injury nothing uh i stretch a little bit my fingers but like two two months is already and i just don't feel any more the pain i using all the power for any exercise so i think it's disappeared and but the main point is i have no no elbow pain nothing whatever in the chest or side pressure so i'll be feel comfortable you know whenever i go on table
SPEAKER_04: I'll be feel comfortable that I can go full power and I don't need to worry for nothing. Just if I get him down, then I'm lucky and happy, but you know, can be,
SPEAKER_04: it can be anything you know last two fights what i have uh these guys try go inside with me and they lose badly so i'm interesting as well if tobias will try go inside one at least one one fight to see if we can get in like kind of deep hook and and see because um that's what i training i train a lot of deep hook to to test it with the top guy
SPEAKER_04: and uh we will see i have a lot of options this time to be honest because like i say my left arm feel pretty good uh i start training even top roll but i am far far away from from the best guys with top roll so i will not try to use it but side pressure and hook it's it's my big guns at the moment about the hook is only my wrist if i can get it inside or not but i train so much
SPEAKER_04: so much i trained the wrist at the moment and the right the right hand wrist is very strong the left one is slightly less but you know it's everything more pressure with left right
SPEAKER_04: yeah my left can press a lot of more because on the right i have some pains but uh even i push i pull dave chafee i have the pain but on the match i just forgot i go maxing power but after the match i couldn't move my hand like one week it was so painful so yeah so but like i say after left arm i come back home after the the new york fights and i i after four days i feel like i can just go back training so
SPEAKER_03: I am so happy about that, you know? Yeah. Tobias, we saw you a little bit hook pulling with Wagner after the match. Do you mean with the right arm? No, left arm with Wagner, I think. I don't think it was hook.
SPEAKER_00: After the match, I think your trainer sent me the videos. Yeah, I don't remember that it was a hook match. From what I remember, it was he tried to press me. Yeah. So I got in a losing position, but maybe I remember wrong. Okay, I will try to. Maybe I misremember.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe now I remember. I think it was right at the beginning I capped him and I hooked or maybe pressed him sideways. I attacked his pronator. One second. I'm just checking for my own. Just right now. Maybe I misremember.
SPEAKER_03: i don't know yeah it it seemed like a little bit hook to me but i think it was the cupping and uh yeah but like press press with the bottom side of yeah yeah yeah oh maybe shoulder pressure
SPEAKER_03: yeah i shouldn't show this i shouldn't show this it's okay yeah i have to i have to re-watch because i can see this guy who is talking so tobias was talking and i couldn't see properly but i hope it will be safe yeah yeah yeah what was it what was it was it uh tight pressure or the shoulder pressure
SPEAKER_03: obvious that you are getting ready so what i'm just trying to this was like a with a cup you know yeah yeah um just say that you you have an option of this top roll as well it just in case if you top roll and stop coming do you have the ability to bring the shoulder you have that okay yes yes okay but from my point of view you will have to break me to do that
SPEAKER_04: There is no way you can go through my body. No way. Come in. This guy used to be very shy guy, very quiet, shy guy. And whenever you said that to do that, you need to break me. And he's like, don't worry, I can do that. Yeah, go ahead. Yeah, I just can't imagine if I put my shoulder behind the hand and someone can go through. It's just I just don't know.
SPEAKER_04: You know, it has to be so much power, so much personal experience.
SPEAKER_03: I know by the weight what I am doing. And if I can just imagine someone put that weight on his biceps, there is just no way he can hold that. No way. Sometimes, Kamil, sometimes you, top of someone, you don't end up here. But maybe if you get center here and then you are like this, but he is here. You understand? He has the center. And then maybe he can come and break. So not when you are totally over him. He's on his...
SPEAKER_04: only if only if i will let him you know i was pulling kalinichenko and he is really good on the left arm and i was on the left arm he just beat dave chafee and dave chafee is not bad as well they have his left arm okay yeah no no what i'm just saying kalishenko
SPEAKER_04: The one that pulled with Devon Larratt, right? With left arm. Devon was holding the peg. Yeah. But never mind. I was testing my left on him and I was giving him everything and I was able to come back just whenever I want. So I think I'm pretty good on the really side pressure. Even I am far away. I just don't know how I'm doing this, but I'm just coming back. I don't know how.
SPEAKER_04: but you know i feel comfortable with this move so you are saying that even if you lose this painter yeah no problem no no problem i just rotate all my body like and it's like like mashing just come back easy win easy win for hood obvious well come in it seems like like that that's how it will go okay no no i'm just joking tobias don't stress
SPEAKER_04: Okay, I see two confident guys in front of me. You know, after how I fight Cody and the other guy, I feel comfortable on that move. That's good. I want to face a strong and confident company. Yeah, I feel comfortable and, you know,
SPEAKER_04: this is every super match is new experience and you learn from every each one and the most you learn from the losing one so you know even give me so much new experience which i will never do this stupid mistakes again uh what was the mistake yeah i've done a lot of mistakes with him just can you share with us
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, sure, I can. It's anyway over. So the first mistake, it was loose hand, you know. The first round, me and him, we have a loose hand.
SPEAKER_04: and this technique was much faster than my one because he have to bend the wrist and pull the hand inside me i have to rotate all the body so his move is twice faster than my one so when i start doing my one he already pinned me so this was big mistake and uh
SPEAKER_04: So next time never lose hand with someone fast, you know, never because I just can't lose a lot. And now second, if the flop doesn't work, don't do again in the next round flop. I should go inside with him. I should.
SPEAKER_04: go in the hook like he go and try hold him with the back pressure which i have pretty good so it was big my big mistake you know i just uh in my mind i know it ivan is the best hooker in the world don't go in the hook with him because he will smash you that was in my mind ivan ivan is the best he has the best hook inability like to hook someone but once you go inside with him
SPEAKER_03: he's great great great but best i don't know about that one you understand yeah so you know i think there you made a mistake you know like his hook inability and his hook are different if his hook inability is 10 his hook is nine i would say yeah when i watch uh one bear and tobias
SPEAKER_04: uh i was sure the one girl won't make won't make the same mistakes what i done and he didn't change i was sure he would go in the hook in the last third round uh but he just go
SPEAKER_04: flop flop flop flop and everyone same same same so i'm surprised he didn't change the technique and now i will never do this mistake if something doesn't work i must change it so you're talking about wagner much right wagner wagner yeah yeah yeah but but i i kind of feel that what wagner felt there was something that my opinion no matter what he did there was a
SPEAKER_03: difference that that wouldn't change anything this is what i felt i think he got even a little bit hurt after which round that he was holding his arm a little bit around three three i think
SPEAKER_03: round three yeah yeah i i think i don't think there was there was a lot to do for him and i also suggested him to rest you know some a few months you know so because the guy is all time training training you see all the time he's pushing huge numbers he's not super young i think time to time he needs to really rest and then start from the beginning you know
SPEAKER_04: I think he doesn't listen to you because I see him pulling again. Crazy. It's because I wrote to him. I saw he put some video with the pulling back down. So I think he just loves crazy weights.
SPEAKER_03: And when he do biceps pull, he's doing pretty good weight as well, like 130 kilos. So that's why I was pretty sure he would go with the hook in the last rounds. Yeah, whenever I see you pressing all those 100 kilos or something, I feel the same. I hope this guy doesn't get hurt, you know, on elbow. Because you never know. We always think this is like we are super. And then one click, you know, tick, and then everything is just never the same again, you know. Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: yeah yeah but 100 kilo is not a lot you know it's just like good training weight i i feel comfortable
SPEAKER_03: but 120 this is the weight which is risky you know you have to hold all your pressure and holding a lot but today i saw uh ibrahim holding 130 and i say that yeah yeah i i wrote him i wrote him as soon as i saw him he technically stressed and i told him just don't injure yourself he said this is the last heavy training but still like i don't think it is that necessary to push the limit with weights that much because weight is something that doesn't get tired
SPEAKER_03: like if you are training with someone that's another human being you know like it just moves a little bit it gets tired the weight is not the weight per second it is 100 kilo 30 seconds still 100 kilo you are the one who is getting exhausted not the gravity you know so yeah so i don't go crazy he go crazy
SPEAKER_03: Do you believe that if Kamil gets his position, do you think you can stop him? I think I can stop him.
SPEAKER_00: Not near the pad. Then it's probably too late because my angle is too open. But how about here? Yes, I think so. But he will be putting the pressure. Whenever I saw Cody, I saw Devin, their arms were open. I won't do the same as they did. How would you do? I can come forward. But to come forward, first you need to stop it.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So this is what I am saying that before you come forward, can you stop that pressure? And do you think that the key to control that pressure is controlling the pronator or the opponent? Because here,
SPEAKER_03: your tricep is working to the winning position. Once your palm is turned this way, you can still do this, but it's not tricep. Right now, to use your tricep, you need to work on your losing side. So the pronation here, pronation here, here, so much difference. So do you plan to? Do you plan to? Do you think that the key to beat him, to control his pronator?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, that's one of the keys. My cupping strength is good, especially on the left hand. Is your cupping as good as your grip? Yes, I would say they are equal. If they are equal, then Kamil, you need to be careful with that guy. Tobias, don't forget I was training pronator last two months.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, that's true. Kamil, it's very important, right? You think that, you know, maybe you wasted time because you have a super match, but whenever you make your pronator stronger, you know, to keep your pronator here is so important, right? For you to apply that shoulder pressure or side pressure. Because once you turn here, I think it's very important for Jerry as well.
SPEAKER_04: this could be very helpful and you know especially my press is fresh very fresh so this should work together nicely nicely and then you winning this i hope so i hope so you know i want to show good match you know not like always people say i'm boring i want to make a good match to you know just don't go and
SPEAKER_04: and flash pin Bam Bam with the flop press. So you will be nice on him and you will not make it boring? Yes, I will try and make a nice fight and hopefully I will not lose it from doing nice fights. So you will not try to win quick? Yeah. Wow. How nice, you see that Tobias? Yeah, yeah. I want to make a nice match.
SPEAKER_03: yeah but you're probably at the beginning you should check yourself the first round you know at least yeah but after that will be boring because people will say oh keep playing i want to just but now after you said all this thing people will say the same thing you know if they say it's up uh i i will you know i will make them believe you will make them believe
SPEAKER_04: no you know i am expecting tobias very powerful on the back pressure you know that's how he curling 138 kilos this is just amazing when i saw some time ago so i am pretty sure this he will go try outside and try hold me like he say this is one of of his plans i see so this will be uh very difficult as well because he will try pull me as far as he can and he got the power to do that
SPEAKER_04: So now it will be if I can hold some way with the fingers or the strap come on and I'm safe. So that's how I see. So you believe that 100% this match is going to be a strap match? I'm pretty sure yes. Unless he holds on. Yeah, you know, when I tried to pull the other two guys this year, I tried to do without strap and this was my mistake because especially with Cody, I lost
SPEAKER_04: lot of energy for him because always he run away before i pin him so i hold hold then i try pin and he run away he run away so it's i just think like it's wasting of energy wasting of time to try pin someone with this better just let him go boom get straps and then i can i can save the power and have a good match
SPEAKER_03: Kamil, because of your style, you say that people run away from you. Do you feel like a hunter and these people hunt when you arm wrestle? Like, I am stronger than you. You cannot escape anywhere. I will catch you. You know, people, let's say one year ago, when I go first time to Italy for the Supermatch, people don't know me.
SPEAKER_04: so i shocked few good guys like i think i shocked reno as well with the flop press he was thinking he can get he maybe can get me in the top role but he he couldn't then i shocked uh frank lamparelli he was thinking he can get me but he again lost with the flat uh flop press and then uh
SPEAKER_04: But Battaglia, Manuel Battaglia, he is another top guy and he was shocked as well. So, you know, from the first time you went there, Reno beat you, right? Actually, it was like two to one. I won one fight. He won two fights and he get the final on the open category.
SPEAKER_04: so yeah so you know i was uh i didn't know him as well you know so but second time second time you guys meet you beat him two zero or two one again uh second time i meet him in july i i go especially to to fight him because he he will he say he will be in the croatia zg strong and he will he will be pulling left arm so i go especially to him and uh i knew that
SPEAKER_04: him and me have same technique which is uh press so whoever first get there is smashing so this time i was faster two times and i won the uh the did he win any match or it was two zero yeah he he won one match yeah okay so first time you he won he was two one and second time he won you want two he won once yeah so it looks like we needed a super much
SPEAKER_03: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. He just pulled against Matushenko. I think it was 4-1. But I think he can pull super weight as well. Tobias, what do you think about Kami's confidence that he's going to make the match tougher and this and that? Like, how do you feel when he says these kind of things? He wrote to me a few days ago that he was scared after I beat Wagner so easy. And I told him that I didn't believe him.
SPEAKER_03: And now I think that I was right. You were right. Okay. So he was just doing the mind games with you and he said he was scared. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: okay no you know from my from my point of view i i just exactly see the match how it will go him and wagner and me is because wagner pulled same way flop press so he just showed me exactly what he will do and i know what i need to do to don't let him to do that so you know he catching glow he catching that way to keep the fingers away and stuff like that so you know
SPEAKER_03: but he have as well a lot of of my videos to see where i am strong and he need to find the way for himself yeah i'm telling you there is nothing secret nobody is hiding anything from each other you know um so obvious how do you see your chances in percentage yeah i didn't think of that before you're gonna be you're gonna be you're gonna be like now like
SPEAKER_03: nice or this and or you're gonna just say exactly what are you gonna be like coming coming on the messaging or let me be totally honest okay i would say 70 30 for me and if he beat me then he's great incredible yeah yeah i think so
SPEAKER_03: That's my honest opinion. Okay, I understand. So you are 70% and he's 30% you are saying. Another question before I ask Kamil, the same thing. What has changed since the Vitaly match? Like, as an armwrestling fan, forget about being organized or something. As an armwrestling fan, should I expect you to come back and become the best?
SPEAKER_03: or vitally in your eyes, unreachable, or you already progress a lot that maybe not now, but soon the things may be different. Like, I want to know what's going on here. Are you speaking to me? Yeah. Uh, what did you say? I didn't hear it. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'm just saying that as an arm wrestling fan, as an organizer, I'm asking you,
SPEAKER_03: because you are one of those young hopes for armwrestling, but you lost Vitaly convincingly. And so what I'm just saying, what has changed since that time till today? Should I hope as an armwrestling fan, you to come back and become the best? Have you progressed since that time? Like what's going on in your mind, you know? Yeah, I progressed a lot.
SPEAKER_00: At the same time, I know that Vitaly, in my eyes, I believe he is number one. So I think I'm not there yet. So I need maybe a few years. And for some people, that maybe seems like a very long time. But I think it's important for me to be realistic. Realistic, yeah. Yeah. So another question.
SPEAKER_03: And don't be like, don't be shy to say, answer this. In your head, of course, you are a top arm wrestler and then you'll follow everything. Do you see yourself as favorites against anyone else than Vitaly?
SPEAKER_03: Like if we take... Just Morozov, Morozov. Like right now you said you are 70-30 to Kamil. Like to Matushenko, to Alijan, to just say Hermes, just say Morozov. Like where do you see yourself? For sure in the like top five.
SPEAKER_00: maybe i could be the favorite against adames because he is right-handed his left is also good but it's a it's a big difference you could take his wrist yeah you are saying yeah take his wrist or something maybe not only taking his wrist i don't i'm not sure if we take alicia that's very very hard match to predict
SPEAKER_00: because I can't really understand how strong he is in the setup, in the cupping, in his fingers. So it's very, very difficult for me. But then we come to, like, Kurdec and Morozov, Vitaly, then I think they are the favorite. Not only in my eyes, but also in the... You said that Matyushenko, Morozov and Kurdec are favorite against you?
SPEAKER_03: No, I didn't say Matyushenko. Okay, who did you say? Kurdeca, Morozov, and Vitaly. Oh, Vitaly, yeah, you already said it. Yeah, okay, okay, I missed that part. But what do you think about Matyushenko? Matyushenko's hook inability is great. Would you try to go outside with him? Yes, outside or high hook. High hook, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: I mean, all these guys, it's a very, very high level. So it's very hard to predict. Yeah, I understand. So that's why we need to set these matches and people will see, you know, what the reality is. Yeah, yeah, I agree. The left arm is getting more exciting. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Everything is more matches happening. And so arm wrestling is not going around five, six guys anymore with just...
SPEAKER_03: every guy that has something to say is placed at the stage. Kamil, how do you see your winning chance against Tobias? He said 70-30 for him. How do you see from your side? Yeah, to be honest, I am surprised what he said. That 70, he will take it. How were you expecting?
SPEAKER_04: Maybe 55-45. I was thinking maybe he would think that the match is similar. So he's underestimating you? Yes, I think yes. And I think like 55-45 because he's calling himself top five and I'm calling him top five in the world. So I will have a hard match. And if I can get it
SPEAKER_04: him i think i can try go get it another top role guys which is vitaly and kurdecha i am not sure yet about hookers like morozov alizian or even matushenko but if you want to become the best you cannot avoid you know you need to you know the thing is i need to feel it and try it then i can know it if i'm ready or not yet because
SPEAKER_04: You know, how I training is never show how he's on the table. It's always slightly different. You need to feel what? I need to feel them power to see how is in the life. You mean, you mean, you mean, you mean other than our competition? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. If I can, if I can, if I can just touch it and feel it, if he smashed me or not, then I will know. What are you going to do? If they say, I'm not going to give my hand to you, you're not going to pull them.
SPEAKER_04: You know, before Supermatch, Hermes sent me a message. If I will be there, I can come for training. So he was happy to test my left hand, but I didn't go there. So maybe, you know, maybe I can have a test and feeling sometimes. We will see.
SPEAKER_04: At the moment, I think I can get any top row guy down, I think. Because, you know, even Vitaly, if he don't use side pressure and if he don't have strong side pressure, he will not take me because I give him all. And in the time when I give him all, I am already here. And I have so much here. If I just put the hand behind the shoulder, I really can't. I think that you guys all need to climb the stairs slow.
SPEAKER_00: or was slowly i think i think they also want to add something yeah go ahead uh i've underestimated people before and i want i don't want to be in that situation again so when i say 70 30 for me i that's what i believe but i i also know that maybe he will surprise me and maybe i will change how i
SPEAKER_03: believe the match will go just when I feel in the setup maybe he feels super strong and then I maybe he will shock me no one knows yeah yeah but but do you exactly understand and know what to expect did you analyze him like do you like is the game plan clear the game plan is clear
SPEAKER_00: It is. I've seen most of his matches. And I think I feel confident because of my current shape, but also about his style. Oh, his style is good for you? Yeah. Yeah, I feel good against pressures. But he's probably the strongest one for me so far. For the left arm, yeah. Yeah. Okay. That's good. That's good. You guys both have...
SPEAKER_03: Good confidence. And even though Kamen says 55-45, but still he gives the edge to himself. Yeah, as he should. Yeah, we will see. Let's see when Levan is going to come back. Levan is training his left arm. He's not really, with left arm, he's not really pushing what he's doing with right arm. Left arm is not pushing it.
SPEAKER_03: But just remember, every time he does barbell curl, every time he does chin-ups, whatever, both arms are working. That's why if you look at his pictures, you will not see so much size difference. Yeah. Right and left, yeah. Did he fix his wrist with the stem cells? I think it's getting better. I think it's getting better, yeah. But just remember, when he pulled against Vitaly, I think 2017 Zolotitur,
SPEAKER_03: yeah yeah yeah that was a good match and then he come back with his arm i think his arm is ahead of his uh hand uh yeah but let's see let's see where he where he will be when he comes we need them we need them like can you imagine having a left arm like lebanese but you're not competing you know just come on yeah this is yeah and so let's talk about the matches
SPEAKER_03: Okay, I don't know if you guys analyzed the card, but let's start with Nugo Skadze versus Petro Marharint. Are you guys familiar to both guys? Me, not really. Especially Petro, I know about him from Ukraine, right? Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: And the other guy, I think I've seen some videos like recently. He beat Krasimir last Europeans. He toppled him and beat him. Yeah, I know about both guys. Any prediction for that match? Kamil, you said that you don't know about them so much.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I don't know so much, but today I look at before we chat now. So both of them looks incredible, but I think Petro didn't pull a long time. I saw his videos since 2017, 18. No, no, no, no, no. 2022, he competed well in Turkey, Antalya. So maybe I don't see this video. And those 2022 competed. So he's not that far.
SPEAKER_04: If he is in shape, I think maybe slightly, I would say Petrov. But I think both of them look incredible and hungry, I think. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I think it will be a nice match, to be honest. It will be a crazy match, I think. There is no tougher reality check than that stage. So if you are coming there, if you are invited,
SPEAKER_03: you and you have a goal you want to become number one in the world that that you see as an opportunity and then you are like i have no other option but winning so because one mean is automatic invitation again a higher level match yeah of course that i would like to invite everyone we lose it doesn't matter but sometimes you know you don't have so much room you know
SPEAKER_00: Tobias, do you have any prediction about this match? I believe that Petro, I think his hand is probably too strong. That's my guess. If he is in good shape right now, I think he is too stable. His wrist is too good, I think.
SPEAKER_03: And it would control him, yeah. And the thing is that Nugo is very good against the hook pullers because his arm is incredibly strong. If he ever fails, he's failing from here. But still, his arm, that's why when Krasimir tried to hook him,
SPEAKER_03: he actually in strappy top roll. You don't see Krasim's wrist like this so often. Yeah, it's a good match. Yeah, very good. And then Sandris versus Ibrahim Sago. Kamil. Yeah, I think Ibrahim will take that match. I think it will be too much for Sandris. I know Sandris is very strong, but I think
SPEAKER_04: His press and how I see him fighting in AMC is just amazing. I think he's too powerful for Sandris. But maybe I'm wrong. Maybe Sandris will surprise me, but I don't think. And Sandris, I think, lost some weight for that match. He had to lose some weight. Not for that match. He wanted to pull light. Under 7-8 kilos he was. He was 2-3 kilos. I think...
SPEAKER_03: probably bragging needs to lose more weight than sanders maybe i'm not sure but yeah yes and you you go sorry sorry no i mean i am for the flow presser guy or presser okay now now i understand the connection yeah and and tobias is he usually doing flop press or with the
SPEAKER_03: both but no no ibrahim likes to hook and press but if he cannot then he is doing this but usually he hooks people yeah okay yeah he usually he hopes if you do you remember his match with takashi yeah yeah yeah then he got inside right yes
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I think if Sandris can go outside, I think that's his chances. That's where he can win. If he gets hooked, I think no chance. That's what I believe. Sometimes against the pressers outside, not always the best option. Yeah, it's a tricky opponent for Sandris. Yeah. And...
SPEAKER_03: Talcat Akteyev vs. Betki Leoniani. I'm not sure about these guys. Kamil, I thought that you were like breathing armwrestling. Like you said you love armwrestling, but you don't really look around so much. Yeah, because it's small weight. Both of them are world champion. Both of them are world champion. Yeah. Maybe I'm slightly favored to Talcat.
SPEAKER_03: Talgat is the one that in 2022 he won against Oleg Dzok at the WAF. But he is going inside while Betkili is also going. Did you see there was a match between on the armwrestling engine, if you remember there, they put the video between Raz Serdakian and Betkili, like long, long, long two-minute hook match. Yeah, so Betkili is that guy that he can pull forever, you know.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, you are saying Talgat is the favorite in you, Tobias? Oh, very difficult. They both gained weight, right? Yes, yes. When they pulled last time, 2017, they both were 75 kilos. Now they both will be pulling, I mean, 95 kilos. Yeah, I think I pulled with Betkile. I think it was in Turkey after the competition. He was much lighter than me, but I remember him. Oh, you pulled with him?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I did. Did you feel him? He was very, very strong in his position. Do you realize that in that event, he pulled very, very long matches with Oleg Zhok? Yeah, that's crazy. Very long matches. If he still was very strong, then yeah. Yeah, he was. I'm not sure, actually.
SPEAKER_03: But I must say 50-50. Okay. Okay, now let's go to other matches. Let's start from, let's see, I'm just trying to do on order. We can start from Fia Raizek versus Ekaterina Nikiseva, your countrywoman.
SPEAKER_04: yes what do you come in first or me first it doesn't matter whoever come coming doesn't seem like so familiar no i i think pia will take because i don't see uh irina too much nothing no no no no no no no no no no no no no
SPEAKER_00: or training i don't i don't know what what is her shape she was very good in the past and i don't know we'll see but you remember her right yeah yeah and you fabius yeah i think and i hope that fia will win it seems like she is taking arm wrestling very seriously right now i mean she has been doing that for many years but it seems like she is in very good shape right now
SPEAKER_03: So I think the camera. Yeah, that's a tough match. Yeah. And Minda was versus Arthur Makaro. Tommy, the goat, the Minda was. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I remember.
SPEAKER_04: last time like a year ago when there was a discussion at arm wars with uh devon lara you'll pick up and everyone and mean that was about his technique so after that i see it was working you know it was working this technique what what they discussed how to beat uh how to beat daniel daniel prokopchuk yeah so this i see it's get working and this time i'm really not sure you know because we
SPEAKER_00: I am not sure, to be honest. 50-50. And you, Tobias? Yeah, Mindaugas, he is in good shape. And I think maybe he can do not exactly the same, but something similar that he did in his last match.
SPEAKER_00: So maybe not in the first round, but maybe in the second or maybe third round, he can take his wrist and go outside. So I think that's possible. That's possible, but Arthur winning is also possible? Yes, yes. So how do you see a close match? 55-45 to Tarasaitis.
SPEAKER_03: So Tarasaitis is the favourite? Yes. Yes, because of his last match. Yes, I think. Okay, now we have an incredible match. All of them are incredible, but Irakli Zrakashvili versus Oleg Petrenko. I think I am with Irakli. That's how he's pulling Levan. It's just amazing. I think he will take it.
SPEAKER_00: And you, Tobias? Petrenko, he can also go with back pressure and side pressure. I don't think he can hook Irakli. But maybe he can go with side pressure. Maybe. Or maybe he will lose his wrist if he tries to do that. We don't see him losing his wrist so much. I don't even remember him losing his wrist.
SPEAKER_03: But they could continue if they go. What's that? Verschenk against John Verschenk? No. Did he lose it? I don't know. When? He even toppled John in the last round.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, maybe I remember wrong. I mean, you can flatten his wrist. Yeah, that's what I mean. He doesn't go like that. He flattens and then he hits, hits, hits, and then slowly he gets cupping and then a win. I don't think he can do that. I don't think he can do that with Irakli because that's Irakli's strong position and he can just surge sideways. Did you know that these two pulled three years ago, again in Istanbul, and Sasha won 3-1?
SPEAKER_03: for one okay yeah but it was three years ago yeah yeah um okay they say i said petrenko iraqi versus sasho did i say petrenko yes oh i'm so sorry
SPEAKER_03: I'm not looking for, this is Sasho, Sasho, Sasho. You're talking about Petrenko. Yes, yes. Okay, that's why I'm saying why he lost his wrist. Okay, okay, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Do you know why this happened? Yeah, I know the story. Because the match is canceled, but on the poster it's still Petrenko and I'm fasting. So from sunrise to sunset, I don't eat and drink. So probably it is last 25 minutes. So that's why probably I'm saying wrong. Sorry about this. This is Sasho, Sasho. I don't understand.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, Sasha versus Irakli, yeah. Yeah, Sasha versus Irakli. I think Irakli will win. I think so. It's very difficult to hook him. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, it looks like Irakli is in top shape as well at the moment.
SPEAKER_03: by the way it's what he's doing they are crazy yeah yeah incredible shape but but i'm i don't think this hasho will come here uh with the best shape either so it will be incredible like whenever we look at these meshes
SPEAKER_03: like people those community they need to realize i'm sure they do but if there is anyone who doesn't realize this that these are extraordinary human beings including you too like like like these are the elite of elites in the world not not
SPEAKER_03: not any regular guy over there you know like i mean even the the matches that i don't even know which match i should start the event because it is it is everyone is so high level you know so let's go to the brandon assessor versus stojan golemanov do you guys know stojan golemanov
SPEAKER_03: I saw some videos, but I don't know this guy much. I saw some videos, so it looks amazing. In my book, one of the best top rollers I have ever seen. He doesn't have so much joint side pressure, but his top roller ability, even last year, he had a war with Krasimir. He top rolled Krasimir, but at the end, Krasimir won with the deadlifts. Yeah, those damn deadlifts pressers, you know?
SPEAKER_03: It's just hard to deal with it for sure, you know. It's hard to deal. Yeah, he's going to pull against Brandon Assessor. Yeah. And so you guys have no prediction? No, it's difficult to predict. But I'm sure it's a good match. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it will be. And Schoolboy versus Leonidas.
SPEAKER_04: i think this will be very interesting match because schoolboy is very experienced and lonidas is very strong and i am pretty sure that the match will stop on the schoolboy side and he will have a problem to finish lonidas because his open angle is just amazing so
SPEAKER_04: yeah you know it depends about his wrist if he if if schoolboy can rotate his wrist then he will take it if he if he will not rotate his wrist then i don't know already maybe he can take it back because arm to arm power then leonidas is stronger yes yes
SPEAKER_04: biceps biceps are stronger maybe not wrist but the biceps for sure and now it's it's the the key from school boy how he will avoid that biceps you know he need to find a way to avoid that power and i think he and i think he will because i think he will because he's more experienced you know he he pulled since baby so i think he will find a way
SPEAKER_03: Scooboy will find a way to win? I think yes. And you, Tobias? I was thinking the same, actually. I think he can take his hand, but can he finish the match? I don't know. I think if Scooboy takes the hand, he's going to win. But if he cannot take the wrist, even if he
SPEAKER_03: in a winning position the guy Leonidas bicep power is incredible to finish him is not that easy but we will see you know yeah and Michael Todd versus Frank Lamparelli coming that's very interesting match but I think Frank won't be able to finish Michael Todd after that's what I saw with Pavlo and Michael Todd
SPEAKER_04: He will probably win the center, pull to his side, to Frank's side, but I don't think he'll be able to finish him. And I think Michael Todd will bleed him and they take him back with their press. Especially he knows that he doesn't like press. How do you see your chances with right arm against Michael? Oh, I think I'll have to be quick. Because if he will stop,
SPEAKER_04: or he will kill it because I think he have good, how to say that, you know, like conditions. Endurance. Endurance, yeah. He have a good endurance. He can hold as much as his body can lift. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: be difficult if if i'm quick with the push side not not straight down because straight down he can maybe stop but sideways far away maybe i can get but maybe not you know he's he's not young man maybe he's not that fast like me so i think will be very interesting i like to try one day uh to press there are there are so many matches and we will see them just we just can't do all of them at once but we will
SPEAKER_00: eventually see all these matches. What do you think about this match Tobias? It's a great match. They are both very good and Maiko just came back from the injury. What is the name of the guy that he pulled in USA? Pablo.
SPEAKER_00: He did great against Pablo. He looked very strong and I was in shock to see that shape so quickly. But also I'm very impressed by Lamparelli. What he did with Matt Mask was incredible. Yeah, he's very technical, very smart arm wrestler. Yeah, I believe in Lamparelli. I think he can win, but it will be difficult for him. But I think he will do it.
SPEAKER_04: And last four matches, David Samusha versus Nur Dalet Aydar Khan. Do you guys have a prediction for this match? I think Nur Dalet could be faster than David. And I think he can flash pin him. Because that's what I, on the last East and West, that's how lost... Against Vala, he won. Yeah, fast flash pin. And I think this could be...
SPEAKER_04: unstoppable maybe but maybe i am wrong i don't know can you do it four times so that's the question yeah that's the question yeah so very good match and uh like slightly more to the to the noodle and you tobias
SPEAKER_00: Oh, it's hard to say that Samusha has gone loose after winning like six or seven times. How many times did he win? Seven times in a row he won. But does it mean that he will forever win? No, absolutely not. If someone is going to beat him, it's Nurdanet, I think. Yeah, so...
SPEAKER_03: It doesn't mean that he is going to either, right? Yeah, yeah. It feels boring to say 50-50, but I really don't have a clue. So you are saying that the one is explosive, he has a chance to win, and the other one has good endurance and power, he has a chance to win. So it is impossible to say that this guy for sure is going to win. Yeah, I don't think Samusha will win with 4-0. That's all I can say. Okay.
SPEAKER_03: And if Aydarhan wants to win, it needs to be 4-0? Yeah, I think so. Otherwise, he will just get tired. Yeah. I think so. Okay. Georgi, Svetko, Alex Kurdecha. Looking forward to this match. So come on, Tobias, you first.
SPEAKER_03: Tobias, before you start, I want to ask you. Tobias, do you have anything to say to these guys with right arm? Do you mean... We know that your left arm is there somewhere. How is your right arm doing?
SPEAKER_00: My right arm is actually quite good. I wouldn't say that it would be a good match for me to face like Svetkov on the right hand right now. Maybe if I get a right hand match, I would maybe want to face like Arif Edetem or Kalina Cenk or something like that. I think it would be better. Yeah, I think that would be fair.
SPEAKER_00: So I think they are too much for me right now on the right hand. But my right hand is getting better. You are not in a rush. So how do you see this match? I think Svetkov will attack Khurdecha's weakness. And we could see this when he faced Chafee. When Khurdecha faced Chafee. But maybe Khurdecha...
SPEAKER_03: has fixed that problem. I mean, I believe it will still be his weak point, but maybe his weak point is very strong right now. Do you think that Alex Kurdeca at that match was in the shape that he is in right now? Not even close. So you are saying Alex Kurdeca right now is bigger and stronger than at that time?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, much stronger. Yeah. And also remember that Dave Chaffee has incredible side pressure. Yes. And I think if something is not enough for Georgi, it's I think his joint pressure to side with. He's just... He's...
SPEAKER_03: muscle pronation to the end to the death you know it's just pronation but not so much not so much like not close to what dave chef is so do you guys agree that they both have good hands
SPEAKER_03: Good pronation, especially right arm. Left arm, Bissau-Kurdesha could do even shoulder pressure, bicep, everything he could do. But with right arm, I didn't see Kurdesha doing things like he did with left arm before. And so I think for me, the bot goes outside and it's a handball battle, but not so much joint pressure. So I kind of feel that that will not be an easy match. But yeah, go ahead and finish. Sorry about it. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: I think, as I said, Svetko will attack his weak point. But we know about Jörge's shape right now, but we don't know about Krdeca's right hand. So if Krdeca's right hand is much stronger than before, I think he can win.
SPEAKER_03: but it's difficult to predict because the height advantage the leverage everything is in the favor of kudecha or it doesn't matter for uh it matters but he also needs to have his riser yeah yeah to use that advantage yes yes and and how do you see coming i i think georgie setkov is the top of the world and i think he will smash kudecha oh
SPEAKER_04: That's interesting. I'm just joking. I think it's life favour at Stadko for me. Because Kurdeca didn't pull long time on the right hand. And we really don't know what we can expect. But, you know, the power just don't come so quick, easy. So how long he preparing? Six months? Left arm he didn't pull at all. But his performance was great. Right arm, at least he pulled some matches before.
SPEAKER_04: left arm, I think since the arm work, did he pull anywhere when he pulled? No, but he just came and he gave hell to Artur Morozov. Yeah, but about the left arm, I don't think Morozov was in the best shape as well. I think he was just coming back from the trouble. So it was perfect time for Alex to pull Morozov.
SPEAKER_04: still didn't have a note but he showed good level but on the right arm i think georgie zetkov is is top of the world right now and i think he won't give up easy and i think he will take that much okay alicia murado hermes gasparini this match is a bit related to you guys yeah yeah these are future opponents yeah i think i think alizian
SPEAKER_04: Alizian can surprise everyone. I think his power... People think Alizian is going to win. I think many people think so. Okay, so I think similar. I don't think Hermes will have the same power inside like Alizian. Yeah, but why do you need to go inside? He's an outfielder. That's his only chance to take his risk. Yeah, but when I watch Cody Merritt and Alizian, Cody has a huge hand and
SPEAKER_04: he have difficult to get it out from Alizian and this was like I will say Alizian wasn't in the best shape now he's in incredible shape and I think Hermes won't be able to take his risk I think do you do you think that Cody is Cody is very strong but do you think that his technical ability you know sometimes what you lived or something is
SPEAKER_03: like not 100% translated into the table, but just like your coordination and your ability at the table. I think that the top role, ability and quality of Hermes in to take the risk while Cody is just more like eating outside, but to the pin pad, you know, do you think that there is a possibility that Hermes to be a better top roller than Cody in technical way? Could be.
SPEAKER_04: Could be, but I don't know how strong his left arm of Hermes, you know. The right arm he's showing, but he's not showing the left arm pronation, the biceps lift. You know, we can see 92 kilos on the right arm hammer biceps, but we don't see on the left arm. But how much does he need compared to right to beat Ali Can? If this was right arm of Ali Can, right arm of Hermes versus left arm of Ali Can, I would have no doubt that Hermes winning that.
SPEAKER_04: I think he needed quite a lot. I reckon at least... What's that, 80%? Yeah, I would say 85 kilos on the back pressure he needed to maybe win it. Not less. And you, Tobias, how do you see this match? I was also thinking about the Cody match. As far as I remember, Cody could take his wrist just a little bit, but then he...
SPEAKER_00: Just a little bit, yeah. But the lesion is for sure much stronger now. But if Hermes can get in that position, if he can take his hand a little bit, I think he has a chance to finish the match. I think Hermes' left arm match was with Wagner. He beat Wagner very convincingly, left arm. You guys remember, right? King of the... Yeah, I think it was 4-1.
SPEAKER_03: No 5-1 I think. 5-1 but this one round you wanted to control him. You don't want to control Wagner Bortolato on your bicep. He just presses you. So and then the other match was Morozov match but Morozov match first round actually he took Morozov wrist here. If Morozov tried to go in his wrist would lose but from here he kind of rise and he attacked to
SPEAKER_03: Hermes' hand, you know, but this is not where Ali Can is going to go. Ali Can is probably going to go here, you know. So top-rolling against top-rollers and top-rolling against hook-ballers are a different story. So, yeah, so I don't know. Also, he was kind of exhausted. Of course, Morozov also had a match with Rewaz, but sometimes some people recover, some people don't. Hermes was without, he was going to pass away, you know, he was just like...
SPEAKER_03: so hard to breathe in and everything, you know? So how do you see who's winning there? I think Alisson will win, but it won't be easy. Maybe 55-45. So do you see a clean sweep? Or will Hermes also win the round? Maybe.
SPEAKER_00: But I think if Alishan wins 4-0, then I think maybe the first and second round will be tough and then it will get easier. But that may not be the case either. Maybe RMS can win. I don't know. It's a good match. I'm looking forward to it. Okay, last question.
SPEAKER_04: One second, from my point of view, if you will ask me a question, Kamil, who you want to pull, Hermes or Alizian? Hermes, you will say. So I will say Hermes for sure. Yeah, because he is attacking with braky radials while the other one is going to attack on your arm. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And also, I remember the words from Morozov. He said he can pull anyone but not Alizian. He said, keep Alizian away from me. Yeah, so this means something. This means something for sure.
SPEAKER_04: yeah yeah yeah yeah i would say slightly more elysian like 55 45 but yeah exactly what tovia said i hope hermes will win because you know the future can be easier
SPEAKER_03: You never know, we will see. Nice match. Okay, Devon Larratt versus Levon Slaginashvili. And finish, I need to go and eat my dinner. Yeah, of course. Tobias, you first. Last time, I don't know why, but I always think that Devon is going to win. And he didn't do it last time.
SPEAKER_00: But at the same time he got injured and I don't think he will get injured this time. So this is very difficult. Do you see Devon's progress since last time? Yes, of course. He did. He progressed more than Levan did. So it will be closer than last time. I'm pretty sure of it. But I don't know how close it will be.
SPEAKER_00: Did you follow my visit to Georgia? Yes, I think I've seen most of the videos. How did you judge Levan's shape? That it's stronger than I thought it could be after the injury. I didn't think he could get that strong that quick after such an injury. So I was surprised. So you were expecting him to be weaker?
SPEAKER_00: Yes, I was a little bit weaker. He showed the pronation lift, but I don't think it will be about that. I think it will be about his cupping ability. Did you find his cupping at his best? What was that? Did you find his wrist at its best? Okay, it's very hard to say.
SPEAKER_00: It seems like he has no problem with it, no pain. And it looks strong, but I don't know how strong his cupping was the last time. And how do you see this match? Me? I think... No, no, no, no. One thing, Kamil. First his prediction. How do you see this match, Tobias? And then I will ask Kamil. Sorry, Kamil. I have to say... Devon.
SPEAKER_04: Devon is going to win? This is what you want or what you believe, think? Actually both. Both, okay. Yes. Okay, so you coming? I think I watching these guys very carefully with everything what they do and I think Devon is stronger than last time and Levan is weaker than last time and I think
SPEAKER_04: And I think Devon is very clever and he knows where he has to fight to win against Levan. And I think Levan is not ready there yet. That's what I'm thinking. But how much difference was there in your opinion last time? I think like for Levan, maybe...
SPEAKER_04: 10% he was stronger on the wrist and even on the biceps. Like he was curling 165 kilos for three times. Now he's curling like 135. So 10% he is weaker. No, no, no. What I'm just saying, what was the difference between them?
SPEAKER_04: not much last time not much last time not much last time like five when when when level one six zero there was no much difference between not so much you know maybe looks easier but devon almost stopping him so it wasn't so much different last time but this time devon is much more prepared he know what he's coming for and he also
SPEAKER_04: he knows that Levan has a problem with the wrist. And this is the key for him. This is his way. And I am pretty sure it will Devon win.
SPEAKER_03: I would be really surprised if Levan will give the reason. That's very interesting. That's very interesting. Two of my East vs West guests who are going to compete and they both think that Devon is going to win. While Levan is going to win. You see Devon's preparation. He's doing everything.
SPEAKER_04: to win it so in his mind in his body everything he's doing to win it this is he's like i would say last chance or something like that and i'm pretty sure he is very confident that he coming and he will crack that wrist so you know i will be surprised if levan can hold it but you know levan have a huge hand which can make difficult for devon but levan also have huge hand
SPEAKER_04: This, you know, amazing match, but I think also endurance of Devon is amazing, you know. He can push Levan before the match a lot to make him tired and, you know, the weight of Levan is huge, so he can gas out twice faster than Devon.
SPEAKER_03: That's very interesting. Before I went to Georgia, I was thinking 60-40, 55-45 for Levan. Now I'm thinking more like 55-45, 53-47, but still Levan. I saw him, he's huge, he's strong. But that is interesting that Levan, according to you guys, he's underdog. That is interesting.
SPEAKER_04: You know, it's nice to have a new king, you know. That's why I'm asking, is this what you want or what you believe? It's also nice to have a new king because before Levan was unstoppable and Hermes showed that it is possible. And now Devon will try to prove the world that it is possible.
SPEAKER_03: i am pretty sure so do you think do you think that do you think that whenever we judge these kind of things uh like levan was stopped by hermes do you think that there is also there are sometimes people are also have bad days because of being so dominant it makes them so confident anyway so guys
SPEAKER_03: The my time came because after fasting, I need to, uh, I have been passing more like, because last time I was in the morning. So, how many is it? 17 and a half hours? No drinking, no eating. So now time came, I heard it and. I will ask you permission and we are.
