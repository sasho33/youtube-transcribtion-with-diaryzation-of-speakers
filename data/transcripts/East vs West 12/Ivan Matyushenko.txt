SPEAKER_01: good to see you yeah sorry about it i don't know i don't know why this happened but how are you good great great yes thank you yeah it was good maybe another city another internet i don't i don't know why yeah i think this is because of from my side if it works right now probably i did something wrong yeah yeah there was janice somewhere here also yes what's that uh janice
SPEAKER_00: i know i thought i thought i could like when it is uh youtube imitation like this i i thought it would be more than one like zoom but whenever i realized that you can only send invite one person at a time i think this is how i check it so i told janice like sorry you know just like i invited you one before i'm you so let's do another time with you said no problem no stress at all you know you know i would never disrespect him uh but
SPEAKER_01: Looks like I could do one at a time, yeah. So, how is everything? How is arm? Everything is fine? Yes, quite good. You know, that golfer's elbow always disturbs. But it is always like this, so it's okay. But now I feel I need to be better. So it disturbs me more than usual.
SPEAKER_00: oh yeah whenever you push more it hurts more yes and now i have to push more because i need to become a little bigger a little stronger i think for june but you can imagine like right now you are going for double title yes yeah double title can you imagine you already have the heavyweight title and then and then stylistically i kind of think this is not that easy morozov to top roll you
SPEAKER_01: and looks like that match is gonna go inside and i kind of believe you are faster let's see let's see how it will be yes but uh he has very good defense and uh i do not like uh such guys that have good defense um so he's a difficult opponent for me for sure i have advantage in speed maybe maybe in uh
SPEAKER_01: wrist yes maybe but but i need to go through through his defense and to do that i need to be stronger i think than i am now yeah yeah i have three months well i try to eat more but it's difficult to get some weight yeah yeah but this is an incredible opportunity yes yes i agree yeah
SPEAKER_00: That's why I accept it with pleasure and I'm looking forward to it because it's a rare opportunity. I think if I'm mistaking you, you tell me, you correct me. I think you said that with right arm he is like 60-40, but with left arm you thought something like more closer, something like 50-50. Am I wrong?
SPEAKER_01: Or no? Actually, I don't remember. Maybe, maybe. But I'm not sure because now my right hand is perhaps even stronger than left. Just now because it is rather healthy. Yeah, you just pulled one month ago with left arm.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, and my left is a bit painful, but I know that he also had a very tough match. So we are in even conditions, even he had a really difficult match. Yeah, I think his match was tougher than your match. I think his match against Kurdesha was tougher even than your match. Yes, yes, it for sure was much tougher, yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And listen,
SPEAKER_00: um would you prefer to match have a match in april as well with right arm or would you prefer to do a big golden shot you know for the july uh sorry sorry once again about my right hand like do you think that do you think that like would you like if you are gonna pull in july with right arm
SPEAKER_01: would you prefer to pull also in april or you would want to do only one and in july actually i would not um i would not like to participate in april no i think because i have some other um
SPEAKER_00: some other things to do at the beginning of april so i will uh go uh this will be difficult to um but but we may discuss it yes but i would prefer uh july i understand yeah yeah yeah it was your answer privately as well when we do private chat yes but i would prefer but it's not this is only if you have an incredible match in july just say you versus
SPEAKER_00: devil narrate or something or is it in any case you would want to pull in july well i think in any case in any case yeah
SPEAKER_00: uh maybe not maybe maybe august is maybe august uh but in august perhaps it's not in istanbul august is different event it is in florida it is um orlando florida and i don't know i was just thinking like devon because he has a good reason that he has been pulling in super away category but he hasn't been pulling
SPEAKER_00: heavyweight category because he has been pulling super heavyweight category but i think that around july he needs to defend his title if he still wants to have it and then i was just thinking you or david dadikian would be the the best options great but there is also michael todd there and uh prudnik yes
SPEAKER_01: Kruton is still injured. Yeah, but you versus... Listen, would you prefer to pull Michael or Devin in July? I would like to pull Devin if possible. First. Yes, and after Devin, other guys. I understand, I understand. We talked, so if there is a chance, I would...
SPEAKER_01: uh try to pull the best yeah yeah yeah you want to go for the title um not i'd like to uh pull down uh when i have a chance because as we discussed if i lose to anyone yes uh else it's it will be not um maybe so easy to get this uh this fight oh okay while you are ranked very high you would like to have this yeah yeah yeah yes because if i lose to other guy uh i will not have this chance yes
SPEAKER_00: Listen, just dream about it. You have now one title, world title. And now June, imagine you're pulling Morozov just if you beat him. And then a month later, you're pulling Devon. Imagine that like having like three titles. It's very hard to do it. It's very, very hard to do it. But I mean, like you're not going to go there to lose for sure. But yeah, opportunities exist.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, then maybe go down to 105 to beat Alizhan. I'm joking. I don't think that I have any chance to beat him at 105. Because I'm against Alizhan. I think I have no chance. Oh, I thought you meant right arm. Right hand may be possible, but left hand...
SPEAKER_01: I think I have some chances, only at 115. The guy is just like six strong, you know. He is too strong, yes. And at 105, I will lose my speed, my power. All power, everything you will lose. Yeah, you're right. You're right. And what do you think about Ermes versus Ali Can? It's a good fight. It's difficult for me to estimate. Ermes' outside skill, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yes, I do not think. But I think he has chances. He has some chances. Yes, yes, yes. Because... Whenever he lost against Morozov, it was his second match. But it was also Morozov's second match. You know, Morozov pulled Revas and Hermes pulled Dave Chaffee on the same day. But after their matches...
SPEAKER_00: Hermes looked more exhausted, you know, he was just hardly breathing, you know, and it was after the Rewaz match, his match was after the Rewaz match, so what I just say that, still, he, at the beginning, top-rolled Morozov, and Morozov rise up and then beat him, but not, like,
SPEAKER_00: this way. So what I just say, I think if Ermes has his own cup, which he will have, I believe, against Ali Can, especially in early rounds. If he gets tired, then I don't know about that. But early rounds. So if he has his cup, I think he's going to hit his pronator very strong. And also,
SPEAKER_00: Um, Hermes is also quick guy, fast guy, explosive guy. And Hermes will be training for Denis Sitlenko for June. So I think he will be in incredible shape on that way, you know, end of the April. And I kind of think that it is very hard to beat
SPEAKER_00: Ali Can like by overpowering him. If there is any hole in his hand, whenever I watch his match against Cody Merritt, he was just like a little bit like hang here, you understand? And then he was like win. And also Oleg Petrenko kind of stopped him a little bit, you know, there. So I just think that we will see. Maybe, maybe RMS will find because I don't see any of Ali Can's opponent last a few years.
SPEAKER_00: looks like Hermes. I don't think any one of those guys at WAF has that top reliability like Hermes. Kody maybe was close. Kody was close. Kody has maybe a close style. But not the same coordination, not the same speed and like no respect, but not as much as quality of Hermes. You know, no disrespect. Yeah. Yeah. But
SPEAKER_01: We will see. We will see how it will be. But you think that Alijan is the favorite? No. I think 50-50. I'm not sure. I'm not sure at all. Perhaps, yes, I think maybe in the first rounds, maybe even Hermes would win. Maybe. But perhaps in more matches, I would bet on Alijan.
SPEAKER_00: I understand. It's interesting, yeah. And how did you like the card, East vs West 12? Great, yes. As usual, every time it's better and better. But this time it's maybe the best. It's the best. Yeah, I also think that way. But, you know,
SPEAKER_00: in this life we shouldn't repeat ourselves right we should try to do maybe not all the time we can better ourselves but i mean we should do our our best um so let's talk about the this this matches uh i said uh nugo versus uh petromargarins do you know nugo no nugo is the guy at the last europeans he toppled krasimir and he beat him the georgian guy
SPEAKER_00: And his surname... Shikadze, I think. Shikadze. Oh, Shikadze, yes, I remember. Extremely strong, maybe not that big, and not that muscular, but very... Against the hook pullers, Krasimir said that he is against the hook pullers, very, very strong, because his arm is very strong. And then Krasimir is going there. If you remember, Krasimir hooked John, even without the strap, while...
SPEAKER_00: Chikatse toppled him even in strap. He really, really, really toppled him. It's not that easy to topple Krasimir in his category. And this guy did it. But whenever we think about his opponent, Petro Margarin, his wrist, his cup in power, if you remember how he hooked Revas Lutizze in Moldova event, insane cup in power. So I want to ask you how you see this match.
SPEAKER_01: um i would bet on margarine because i saw many more matches with him and i know for sure that his wrist is extremely strong i remember him pulling john when he also called him and i have seen only
SPEAKER_01: only a couple of matches with Chikadze. I know that he's strong, but I'm not sure that he's at that level. I'm not sure that Krstimir was at his best when he pulled him. But Petrov, I think he proved to be very strong. Yeah, yeah. We'll see, yes, we'll see, maybe. Yeah, but listen, 105kg category,
SPEAKER_00: is very tough i think 105 no disrespect but and also super heavy weight like incredibly tough categories super heavy weight and 105 kilo uh now arsene lille is coming there it will be wow let's see today today yeah yeah we will we will come there uh let's go another one sundry studies
SPEAKER_01: Ibrahim Sago. You know, these guys, these guys are like around like your category and like these are like your specialty. You know, you know these guys very well. But actually, I never pulled Ibrahim and never pulled Sandry's right hand. I only I know that Sandry has become much stronger after 2021.
SPEAKER_01: uh when he beat guitar right hand and he beat him in hook uh if i'm not mistaken also he beat pavlo in hook yes in an arm fight somewhere so his hook became really strong but maybe uh well he missed some some events and he didn't pull for some for some time right
SPEAKER_01: Maybe he had an injury or something. Who are you talking about? Sandris? Sandris, yes. Maybe he had an injury or something. Because he didn't pull for several months. Or maybe for half a year or more. After he won Pavlo. Yeah, I think after that he was...
SPEAKER_00: hurt i don't know when did he pull was it east versus west 10 or eight because nine was around the same time of the waff i think in waff he had some tough matches yeah i think in waff he had very tough matches and he i remember i maybe i saw some matches from his
SPEAKER_00: Oh, he got hurt, I think. I think all together he got hurt, but in the World Combat Games. I think after World Combat Games, he told me, Engin, I need to rest some time because he said, Engin, I'm very exhausted. And then my shoulder hurts, he said. Yeah, yeah. And I also saw some matches or a match from his page in Instagram. And he put there with his floor priest, with shoulder press.
SPEAKER_01: It was a very difficult match, and I think that in this shape, he has nothing to do against Ibrahim. No, no, but right now, you said he's 100%. If it is the version who beat Gitala and Pavlo, then he has some chances. But how much? In his best shape, I would also think it is something 50-50.
SPEAKER_01: I think that he has bad endurance, but I'm not sure that he will manage to stop Ibrahim. But if he stops... That match is going to go inside, you think? Ah, yes. Andres also can top-roll, yes. But I think he will not be able to win this way.
SPEAKER_01: I think hook... You think it would be the same as like Tautiev versus Ibrahim if he tries chop roll? Yes, and I think that he has worse chop roll than Tautiev, maybe. Difficult to say, but in a hook match, he has chances. If he stops somewhere in the middle. Not in the losing position.
SPEAKER_00: So you are saying that basically if everyone is in good shape, first two matches, okay, which matches we talk, we talk, Ermes versus Ali Can, you said 50-50, Sanderiz Ibrahim 50-50, but you are saying that Margarine is favorite against Shikadze. Yeah. What's funny? I remember that when you asked at the press conference, everyone,
SPEAKER_01: who would win, Lerat or Gasparini? I said Lerat, and Gasparini said, you're not my friend anymore. Oh, yeah, yeah. So now he doesn't tell you? Now I think it's better to stay 50-50. Oh, is it because of that? Not to hurt anyone's feelings.
SPEAKER_00: Well, no, not really. I'm joking, I'm joking. Okay, let me call Hermes then, if you are saying this. Anyway, so let's go to the next match. Next match, so... So... One second. We go, okay, incredible match. Talgat Akteyev versus Betke Leoniyani.
SPEAKER_01: know them right yes uh i would prefer talgat maybe if i had to to choose because he's faster he's faster and i think he he will manage to but yes it's it's again it's very difficult to predict
SPEAKER_00: Did you know that they pulled at 2017? No. No. So what happened? Betkili won. Betkili stopped him in a losing position and then slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly lifted him up and beat him. Yes. I know Betkili, how he pulls. I saw that several times. He usually stops his opponents, yes, and then...
SPEAKER_01: But I'm not sure that he will manage to do this. So you are saying that he may not be able to stop him? Yes. I understand. Yeah, we will see. But are you seeing him like heavily favorites? No, also 55-60 to 45-40 years. Something like that. Okay. So 55-45 or 60-40?
SPEAKER_00: And if the match stops, do you think that Betkili has more chance? Yes, 100%. If it stops, then he'll win. Okay. Mindaugas Tarasaitis versus Artur Makarov. First of all, were you surprised Mindaugas beating Daniel Prokopcik? Yes. Especially after two rounds, right?
SPEAKER_01: I was very surprised to see those first two rounds. I didn't believe that Volkovchuk managed to strengthen his wrist so much. Because he dominated, he just called with ease, I thought. And I thought it would continue all the other rounds.
SPEAKER_01: But something strange happened in the third round and from that time it was like in the previous times. But Prokopchuk was not so, how to say, didn't have so much endurance. Yeah, I was thinking that I kind of have my own theory about
SPEAKER_00: Like before, when they pull, even with dead wrists, Daniel was winning. But this time, it didn't go that way. Of course, Mindago started to pull smarter, better. But also, last a few years, Daniel made his wrists stronger. So he didn't really...
SPEAKER_00: put this position so much so he was usually copying and beating copying and beating so when you don't pull often this way and with time you are not well trained about it because you are not making your plans this way you are not pulling this way you are now actually copying copying copying copying and then boom and now you are not that well trained this way anymore you understand this this is my yeah
SPEAKER_00: Never pulled like that, and I do not want to try this style. Yeah, but that match I enjoyed. First two rounds I was like, oh, what a boring match. And I was like, oh, that mismatch. And then suddenly, round three, everything changed, you know, yeah. Yes. Yeah, let's see, let's see, let's see. Everything, I don't know, this is crazy. What do you think about now...
SPEAKER_00: What is the next one? This is left arm or title match. Difficult to say. Have they pulled before? I'm sure they pulled many times because they were around 65, 60, 65, 70. Those years they all pulled.
SPEAKER_00: uh that gladkaya nikisha malin and heidi even maybe came to their time you know maybe maybe not i don't know um and for sure uh sarah was pulling i have seen her against gladkaya and of course fia um we will see what do you think what do you think about uh
SPEAKER_01: She was maybe in top three, but not the champion. After Glatka, maybe after some other. But she beat Glatka too many times. But she started to beat her maybe three years ago. But before that, she was maybe not so strong. But once she gained...
SPEAKER_01: Great level, I think. Yeah, yeah. And, well, it's an interesting match for me. I'd like to see it. And I'd like to see what is Serena capable of now. I haven't seen her for some time. Maybe she also had a pause in her tournaments in Poland. Yes, maybe she had a child, maybe.
SPEAKER_00: So for several years she was out. One guy just reminded me. Thank you very much, Richard. We started talking Minda Agost and we forgot Minda Agost vs. Artur Makaro. I forgot, I'm sorry. Sorry, guys. What do you think about this match?
SPEAKER_01: It's always difficult to answer these questions, who will win. It's a great match and I think that... Mindagos has chance? For sure he has, yes. For sure he has. I cannot say who will win. I think it will be a close match.
SPEAKER_00: it can go yeah i can imagine arthur just dominating mindagas but i can also imagine arthur is trying to dominate and just getting stopped by mindagas and then mindagas exhausts arthur so i can see both both cases in my head and what is what is the wage class 75 75 so it's a good class for both of them
SPEAKER_00: I would say Makarov, but I'm not sure at all. I think they are very close, actually. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And the other thing, people are talking about Alain Zolev, and Alain Zolev is usually beating Artur Makarov. Not usually, but always beating him.
SPEAKER_00: I have seen Artur beating him once after a long match, but Alain Zolev fouled out at WAF 2021 first match. But I also have seen Alain Zolev being toppled by Emile Amirshadian.
SPEAKER_00: But he beat Emil with that risk, you know, but long match, long match. But as you know, Emil pulls, you know, like an open arm top roll like this, not like Mindaugas. So I kind of feel like if somehow Mindaugas top rolls Alain Zoller, it will be hard for Alain Zoller to beat Mindaugas that way because it's not like shoulder pressure, but he is like dragging with the bicep the way that he beat Emil Amir Shadyan. Do you think that, like, I kind of think that
SPEAKER_00: it is possible because like zolev is still technical puller not like arthur makarov arthur makarov like a machine you know he's just like he drags his rowing you know everything in his incredible side pressure while alan zolev is just using like his hand you know more active way you know like more standard arm wrestling way um so if if somehow if mindagos somehow a little bit take his wrist
SPEAKER_01: There is a chance for Minda Agos to win that match as well. But you feel differently? I do not think so. I think he can open Alon's wrist but he will not manage to pin him. You think he will not? I think he will not.
SPEAKER_00: he will open he will most probably open but not finish so you are saying the mindagas most likely will open alan's hand but he won't be able to finish the match yes yes i don't know we will see yeah we will see
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I hope he can travel and then we can see him. You know, the guy is incredible. I mean, but he just cannot come right now. People ask him all the time the same question. Where is he? Where is he? Where is he? And he told me, Engin, right now I cannot travel outside of Russia. Yep. Anyway, so we talked about that. We talked about this. And then Irakli Zrakashvili, Oleg Petrenko. Another great match.
SPEAKER_01: Petrenko was so dominant last time against Martiu. He seems to be extremely strong now. Remember, Irakli also had the same dominant performance against Martiu at the King of the Table two years ago. Yes, yes. But maybe Irakli looked a little better.
SPEAKER_01: He looked better against John than Oleg. But no, Oleg managed to curl John. He also won one or two rounds, if I'm not mistaken. I think no. Or maybe one round. I think one round it was like, but they called foul and the second start, I think John won. I think it was 3-0. Hmm.
SPEAKER_00: But the thing is, to beat Irakli, it is much more possible to attack his hands. The guys that beat him was David Darikyan and Ongarbev. So it is, to me, very hard to hook Irakli. Very hard to hook him.
SPEAKER_00: But top rolling is also very hard, but it's more possible than hooking him. And Petrenko is arm wrestling with outside skill, you know. We will see. Petrenko wanted to have a title match against Dadikyan. And this match is going to show where Oleg Petrenko is going. Sorry, Petrenko will have a title match? No, no, he wanted to have.
SPEAKER_00: he wants to have he wants to he wanted to have even in april he wanted to have it but like he he beat like some guys but he lost against john so i kind of think that he needs to climb up a little bit more you know before the title match you know yeah so that's why he pulls iraqi no
SPEAKER_00: yeah iraqi versus him is i think very interesting match i was gonna put almost iraqi versus petro margarine that would be an incredible match because i i don't know when i mean two rounds through some kind of hook him right two rounds but three rounds iraqi won yeah and one round rustam top road so once he hooked and once he dropped iraqi
SPEAKER_01: So who's winning here now, Irakli or Petrenko? Petrenko has more raw power, I think. More raw power. But just side pressure. But Irakli can open his wrist. Do you think that they both can open each other's wrist? Yes, but they can open like that, yes. And in this case, side pressure.
SPEAKER_00: I think Petrenko has better side pressure in this case. Yeah, Petrenko has better side pressure, but just remember Petrenko couldn't beat John with floppers, but Irakli did. Yes, maybe Petrenko doesn't use this technique. Irakli neither, I've never seen Irakli doing this before, never. All Georgians, I think, use it. I've never seen Irakli before.
SPEAKER_00: never i never seen in competition i don't remember him winning like this maybe like this but not like this anyway so but i just think that if if somehow petrenko top rolls directly i don't think iraqi can beat him like this as he did to john because i think petrenko's arm is very strong i agree so 50 50 or a little bit going somewhere 51 49 or yeah so maybe 51 49
SPEAKER_00: Petrenko, maybe. Petrenko, okay. Okay, so let's go. Schoolboy versus Leonidas. You watched Leonidas with Larry Wills? Yes. It was a tough match. Early rounds was a tough match. And I also remember almost pinning him.
SPEAKER_00: Or maybe even actually pin him, but they didn't give. Or almost pin him, Larry Wills, Sandri Sedis, in Arizona State Championships. And I heard he has beaten Derek Smith. And I have seen only the practice with John. And I have seen him also taking John's wrist as well. I'm talking about Larry Wills. And this guy actually beat Larry Wills. But with some open... Open...
SPEAKER_00: Arconas was like this. His angle is not armwrestling angle, but incredibly strong. So Skullboy for sure. How do you pronounce his last name, Alex Bez... Bez-yazykov. Bez-yazykov? Bez-yazykov. Bez-yazykov. Bez-yazykov. Bez-yazykov. If I'm not mistaken. Bez-yazykov. Okay. So Alex Skullboy is for sure better armwrestler.
SPEAKER_00: But I kind of feel that the other guy is, like, physically stronger. And, like, if somehow schoolboy cannot finish him, maybe he can beat him. But you don't think so. You told me that schoolboy's wrist in your own machine test was stronger than yours and Vitaly's, right? Yes, yes. But he was not good at using it. Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: yeah yeah this is how it is they don't use it at the table but i realized that his hook inability is very good right now he's catching people in hook very well you know before he was trying to top roll but now he's also going inside as well he may have some difficulties because his side pressure was not that good but he has also very good back pressure one of the best school boy
SPEAKER_00: One of the best that I measured. Wow. I didn't measure some top guys, but he is really good at this. So his wrist and back pressure actually are very good, world level, huh? Yes. I mean, you're saying that his wrist was stronger than yours?
SPEAKER_00: And yours is, I mean, incredible. But, of course, use it at the table and use it with those machines sometimes can be different. But the guy is still young. I think he's like, what, 25 maybe, 24, 25? Or even younger, maybe younger. I think in 2001 WAF, he was 21. I think it was his last year. So 2021. I think he is 23 maybe. 23? Okay, okay.
SPEAKER_01: maybe a better check he has very good wrist but his side pressure is not so good so he cannot hook like me because he can force the hook but he cannot finish the ball that's his problem but do you think he's gonna beat Leonidas? I would bet on schoolboy
SPEAKER_01: but as far as i remember he lost to a guy he lost to some guy also who pulled with open arm top roll do you remember also not not a professional arm wrestler are you talking about you're talking about uh that's different like
SPEAKER_00: uh leonidas is pulling that way that guy was like this under the table you know yeah in in my event that that is not allowed that if shoulder i mean humerus goes like down angle like this at the same moment it's a foul of course it's not a winning position a lot of people are like sometimes they see me beating the guy like this he's like oh you were saying the shoulder shouldn't go under table
SPEAKER_00: I mean, they don't understand the difference. There was this difference between winning position and losing position shoulder. I think I need to make a video so they can be educated a little bit. But yeah. So it's not really exactly the same. The one was just really like desperation move like this, you know? Yeah. And so let's see. Arsene Lille, Brandon Assasore.
SPEAKER_00: Do you think that Arsene Lille, after 11 years, can come and beat a guy? You know, Brandon Astor with left arm, he pulled against Travis. And Travis also wasn't well trained. And he beat Travis with left arm. And with right arm, he beat Craig Tuller, even in lower weight. So Brandon Astor, this time will be 105 kilos.
SPEAKER_00: And he is already a huge guy when he is like 90, 95 kilos. And so do you think there is a possibility that this guy will come and beat Arsene? Because like, I mean, like people say that, oh, why did you put Brandon Assasore against Arsene? You know, I mean, like we are not talking about Arsene that was...
SPEAKER_00: I think Arsene will beat everyone in 105, but maybe in a year or two.
SPEAKER_00: I think he's a professional and he will bring good shape. Do you think that just because he's professional, 11 years no training, I mean, do you think that he has like a, like, I don't know, like, I mean, sometimes even you know arm wrestling very well, 11 years when you are gone,
SPEAKER_00: three, four months, five months. I mean, like it may not be enough. It may not be because it's too short time, you know, because you have been away so long time, you know, I mean, it is not like two years or something, not three years. Then I understand 11 years is kind of long. And I don't think Arsene has such an experience before. He doesn't. Okay. So you are saying that he's professional and he will be smart enough and then he will be ready for that day.
SPEAKER_00: Yes. As far as I know, Arsene, I think he will not go not prepared. I think he will be ready. We will see. I'm excited. With 105 kilos, with Arsene, nobody will be safe there. And even 115 kilos, Arsene will be very dangerous. Super heavyweight, I cannot say. I would like to have a match against Arsene.
SPEAKER_01: Because I'd like to take revenge. He beat you more than you beat him. He beat me last time at Russian Nationals in the open category. It was like a non-fight. Two or three rounds, I do not remember. He beat me convincingly. I managed to hook him, but he won with more side pressure.
SPEAKER_01: He was, yes, he was more powerful then. But I was 103 maybe then, or 104. And he was 90? No, he was about 100 also. 100, we were about the same. He was big then. Yes, and now I'm 10 kilograms bigger, and I think now it will be difficult.
SPEAKER_00: See, you are looking revenge from Arsene, Arsene is looking revenge from Krasimir, John is looking revenge from Arsene as well. So now the old, old, let's open the old books, you know, and then clean the dust, okay. I think Arsene will be very dangerous for me in 105. In his best shape,
SPEAKER_01: I'm not sure that I will manage to win in 105. In 115, maybe. But 105, it was his great weight. Yeah, but he can also become 115 as well. Yes, but I'm not sure that he will be efficient. Yeah, yeah. He's heavy now because he's old, you know. Yes. When I say old, because he gained so much fat, like me, you know. Yeah. Yes.
SPEAKER_00: And it would be interesting to see him against Darikyan. Yes. Wow. And listen. How about Prudnik? Best shape of Nick. And best shape Arsene? Best shape of Darikyan, best shape of Prudnik. Best shape of Prudnik, best shape of Arsene. Best shape of Arsene, best shape of Darikyan.
SPEAKER_01: Who is winning there? I would bet on Arsene. But I'm sure that Arsene would win Prunik's arm, I think. He will manage to top the whole team. Yes, I would bet on Arsene. But yes, it may be a close match. How about, you know, we have been talking about going down to 105 and beating everyone.
SPEAKER_01: I won at 105 against Arsene. 50-50 maybe? I won because he is very uncomfortable for Devon. He is explosive, he has good side pressure, good centre. So I do not see Devon winning in 100.
SPEAKER_00: Arsene, if he comes as strong as before, not right away, so most likely you will win the title. Wow, wow, wow, wow. That 105 kilos will be crazy. Arsene also will make 115 kilos more expensive as well. Yeah. Sure. Yeah. And let's see. You want to say something? Sorry.
SPEAKER_01: you want to take something no no no okay michael todd versus frank lamparelli i would bet on michael uh he seems to be in good shape now already uh stylistically uh frank is not comfortable for for michael but uh i think michael can be more powerful and uh
SPEAKER_00: win him even if he loses his wrist a little i think i understand so you are saying that there is a possibility for him to even top roll him possibly but he may not be able to finish it yes somewhere michael will stop him and uh and when from that position that's interesting
SPEAKER_00: And then let's go to this one. David Samusha versus Aydar Khan. Were you impressed Aydar Khan the way he beat Vala? Yes. Yes. Does he have a chance? Aydar Khan has a chance? I would bet on Samusha. Because of endurance? Because of endurance, of strength.
SPEAKER_01: And also Samusha beat Vala, I think. But it was tougher than the way Aydarhan. Yes. Maybe Aydarhan can win a couple of rounds. With explosiveness? Yes. But it can be a close match, yes. It can go both ways.
SPEAKER_00: Another thing, if somehow Vladimir Miro, or I should say Alexander, do you think that if he would train like six more months and come back, do you think his chance would be this time higher against Samusha? Or do you think he has potential to become the best and beat everyone?
SPEAKER_01: For sure he has the potential to beat everyone and he has the potential to beat Samusha. We saw it was a very close match and if he were a couple of percent stronger he would win. Even in that event he had chances to win. I think he made some mistakes and maybe he was not confident in himself.
SPEAKER_01: But we'll see. He has the potential. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yes, but there are some other strong guys, Kazakhs also. Yeah, yeah. And I'm not sure that – I think that Samusha is rather comfortable for Vladimir. Oh, yeah. But maybe – what's his name?
SPEAKER_01: Who is pulling Samusha now? Aydar Khan, Nur Dalet. Aydar Khan, yes. But he may be more dangerous for Vladimir. Because of the explosiveness, right? Yes, because of the explosiveness, yes. Explosiveness and top row. Ivan, have you seen my match with Dobrin? I think yes. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: i don't remember the details but do you yeah okay so if you don't remember details you don't remember my shape i was gonna ask you do you think that like if i can really train or something after this age anything is possible or i'm just dreaming i think you can for sure you think like do you think that there is even a chance to have the belt or maybe not that good you know um
SPEAKER_01: Listen, you don't need to be nice to me. I think you can be close. You can win all the opponents, but I'm not sure that you can win them all the rounds. But you can win some of the rounds, so you're rather close to all of them. But I'm not sure about your endurance and about your health, that it will allow you to pull all those four rounds.
SPEAKER_00: But in one or two rounds, I think you can follow them. Can I ask you something? Sometimes when you dominate someone, like, do you think that the guy who seems to have, like, I had a tough round with Viorel Dobrin. Viorel Dobrin is, like, incredible endurance. You remember he beat Tautiev in Romania in the final, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: And like his endurance is incredible. And I had a tough round on round two with him. And then after that round three, round four, round five, I just beat him like this. You know, so what I'm just saying is sometimes when you dominate the guy one, two rounds, it doesn't mean that he will get closer. He may even be getting farther because of you hitting him. He's just like, like dominated. You understand?
SPEAKER_00: I was thinking when you asked me about Samusha and about Vladimir Majorov. Both of them have great endurance. Did you know that Viorel beat Samusha in 2019 Europeans? No. He took the hand and then he won on fouls but Samusha couldn't go anywhere. He actually beat him.
SPEAKER_00: So you are saying that their endurance should be better than Viorel Dobrin's endurance? That your endurance should be better? No, no, no, no. Their endurance is better than Viorel's endurance. Whose? I mean, Vladimir and Samusha have better endurance than Viorel Dobrin? Maybe. Actually, I'm not familiar with Dobrin so well.
SPEAKER_00: Before I pulled Dobrin, he beat Zvetan Gasevskiy. He beat Daniel Prokopchuk. And then after I beat him, he beat Tautiev. And even in Kazakhstan, he won the WAP Wars as well. So he can pull a long match, a minute long. If he has his arm here, then he'll
SPEAKER_00: As far as I remember, he beat Tautiev quickly, yes? No, no, no. He just came here, they were like this, this, this, this, and then suddenly, boom, and then he still resisted like this. I'm talking about Tautiev. In fact, he beat him a few years ago as well at the European Championships.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. And he beat him this time with arm like this way, two forwards, you know. Yeah. He didn't beat only one time. He beat in that event twice. And some years ago, again, he beat him, Tautiev. And Tautiev is no joke. Tautiev has beaten Zolev probably more than anyone else within his career, Zolev's career, in the same category. Yes. Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Anyway, so let's go to the last two matches. I think we talked already, Ermes Alican. So, Georgy Svetkov versus Alex Kurdecha. Right hand. Yep. Did you know that they also pulled before? No. Did they? 2017 Zlotys Tur. And Svetkov pulled? No, Kurdecha toppled him and beat him.
SPEAKER_01: Difficult to say. I would bet on Svitkov only because I saw many more matches with him. And I haven't seen Kurdeche right-hand lately. But I know that in previous years, Kurdeche lost to some guys in hook against Flo Priest, Angarbaev, Krasimir Kostadinov.
SPEAKER_00: Yes, so time goes quickly. So it was one goal. Yeah, but he was able to manage to topple them. And he won Hermes also, right? Yeah, he beat Hermes, yeah. So his topple is good, very good.
SPEAKER_00: And I'm not sure if he somehow topples Georgi. I don't know if Georgi has this. I think they are very similar. They have very good hands, very good wrists, and then they have very good top row, but not with right arm I'm talking about. Kurdesha proved that he's even hook very good with left arm. Even shoulder pressure is very good with left arm. But with right arm, I didn't see him
SPEAKER_00: enough to believe that he has incredible side pressure or hook so georgie is the same like incredible top roll but the finishing power not so much joint you know but i don't know what you think kurdich is bigger here that's his advantage because so if you if you say that he's uh he beat
SPEAKER_00: But it was also a long ago. It was also five years ago. Yeah, long ago. But the other one is when you say 2019, you're talking about Kurdesha versus another guy. But when we say 2017, we are still talking about the same guys. And then following year, Georgi was second place to... I think he even had some wins against...
SPEAKER_00: Levan, but I think it was left arm. But you remember, in the WAF that you competed, I think you were in super heavyweight category. I think Georgi took second place to Levan in Antalya. I was third. But Georgi took it, right? Say, second, second. Ah, right hand. Right hand, he was second, yes. Yeah, yeah. I think first was Levan, second was him, yeah. Yes.
SPEAKER_00: And who is winning there? Do you see a close match? Close match, yes. Difficult to say. So, another one. 50-50. I can just choose one of them, but actually I'm not sure at all. Yeah, okay. So, we are together for 57 minutes. Let's finish it quickly with the last match. Devon Larratt versus Levon Saginashvili. Did you see that?
SPEAKER_01: Vitaly Laletin said that his favorite is Devon. No, no, I didn't. Yeah, he said that his favorite is Devon. I think that Levan, if he's ready, and it seems to me that he is ready, he will be back again.
SPEAKER_01: but uh perhaps it will be more difficult for him this time this is the part that i don't understand i think i did i ask you again this is the same thing like when something is difficult like is it still possible to be there if it is difficult uh last time he had absolutely no chances to take any round
SPEAKER_01: uh this this time he has some chances but uh but uh i think that levan's chances are better okay how much how much is it like something like 80 20 or 70 30 or i think it was 7 to 30 last time or maybe 8 20 last time and now it is maybe 65 35 yes but maybe in some later rounds maybe a third round fourth round
SPEAKER_00: uh something may happen listen if something happens in third or fourth rounds it means that 15 six rounds will probably be even harder yes yes for sure and it it means that it means that devon would win that if it is really hard but i'm not sure that uh he will be able to do anything in the third or fourth it's just just a possibility
SPEAKER_00: Okay, I understand. But you wouldn't underestimate him, right? After what he did to Georgi, Denis, Hermes, Dave Chaffee, Brudnick, you know. So this guy proved himself to be a worthy opponent for Levan. Yes. Now he is close to Levan as he never was. Yeah. It depends on Levan, I think.
SPEAKER_00: If Levan is not 100% ready, he may lose. Another question to you. Do you see anyone, except Levan, has more chances, better chances against Devon than Devon has against them? Do you see anyone beating Devon other than Levan?
SPEAKER_00: Right now, no. So you are saying... Potentially, yes. But right now, Devin has more chances against other people, right? I think yes. So you are saying that Devin like 100% is the guy who deserves to pull against Levan right now? Yes. I would just say...
SPEAKER_00: I would like to see Laletin. He lost, he had some losses. Didn't you see on the round five he said let's start in strap with Dave? Yes, he had some problems, yes. Not problems, he couldn't beat him, he lost. What I'm just saying is that if Vitaly doesn't allow people to go to strap,
SPEAKER_00: then I understand. But once the match is in step, Vitaly, I think, like, it's not my place, but I think he needs to a little bit improve his wrist. Do you agree with that? Yes. Because of years and years, he pulled this way in lighter weight categories, and he was so tall, so he was very comfortable, especially against people like Krasimir. And it was not easy to top-roll him for that category of pullers. But whenever he's going to super heavyweight,
SPEAKER_00: like i realized one thing if you pull years or years like this it is very very hard for you to build here you know because like many years you did like this so i kind of think that like in the super hair way pulling that style is kind of giving listen you are a professional guy about the wrist can you do risk like this at your best
SPEAKER_00: like you do like this no if you are like this i mean probably maximum 60 70 percent then doing like this so you understand i think his risk whenever he is really facing a like high knuckle posting top roller guy this is sometimes causing problems you know i don't know what's your opinion about this i agree i agree with you i think but i think he has to learn how to curl
SPEAKER_01: um yeah with the normal wrist and from that position go uh his usual top roll he he should um in my opinion he had to do that in first round against levan uh he had not to go uh with back pressure he had to curl his wrist and from that position go um but it
SPEAKER_00: won differently? I think in the first round Lewand just wanted to go sideways. And then whenever somebody is going sideways, if you realise that Lewand went this way and then he was stopped with
SPEAKER_00: Laletin and Laletin went here. If you realize that when Levan was going like this and then there, Levan started rising up, you know. He rise up and then he took him back. And after the round one, he realized that sideways is not the way. So he started directly doing this and it became easier, easier and easier.
SPEAKER_00: If Laletin doesn't improve his risk, my opinion, no disrespect, his chance will not be so high to be the best guy, the champion in that category. It's only about Levan. Because even against Hermes, it was an even match. Very close, very close.
SPEAKER_01: So only Levan is very dangerous here. And Devon, he also uses that kind of top roll, I think. No, not too much rising. He tries, but even against Sitkov, he uses pronation more, right? Yeah, but he doesn't do like this.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, listen, not really. I try to ref him. Even in the ref's grip, he likes to rise up, you know. He wants to make his weigh-in higher, you know. Devon does that. So, okay, when you talk about Vitaly, the last thing, July, there is a match against Jericho. Do you think it's like some, I made a poll, people said that
SPEAKER_00: like 80% Vitaly is winning that match. If I'm not mistaken, maybe not, but like majority, big majority, you know, thought that, you know, he's going to beat Jerry. Do you agree with that or...
SPEAKER_00: since jerry is sliding hand like this there is a possibility big possibility him to go strap because people say that if if hermes didn't allow jerry to go strap they say oh la latin has even stronger hands so he's not going to allow but it was in case the reason that hermes didn't allow him to go step because he put his hand the supination side you know like this and then
SPEAKER_00: beat him a little bit sideways. He used the bottom side of his hand. Laletin doesn't have that kind of ability. Laletin pronates. His finger is good, but whenever the guy is trying to get up like this, but if Jerry falls low and then presses down and slides like this, I kind of think that there is a big chance for him to go to strap with him. What do you think? I don't know. I agree with you.
SPEAKER_01: It will be a difficult match. It can be a difficult match for Olesyan. Yeah. In straps. Especially in straps. But also, it's difficult to go to straps with Olesyan. He has really strong fingers. And he also uses, how to say, triceps move, maybe, in this case, when someone wants to go to straps.
SPEAKER_00: So it will be also difficult for Jerry to go to straps. But do you realize that like the finger you're closing like this, like Vitaly will not have any pressure to this way. Like Vitaly will have something that is sliding down like really like from his hand. I don't know how to show it, but like it will be more like, not like trying to open his hand, but more like, you understand?
SPEAKER_00: like like this way not not not to open his fingers like he's there but whenever somebody is shoulder behind and really pressing with the tricep like this it may not be super super super um easy anyway so if it if it goes to strap how do you see that match now when vitality seems to be better in such pressure
SPEAKER_00: I think he has more chances. Shoulder pressure as well, maybe to finish. You know, take the wrist and then maybe even this needed, but I don't know if he can do that. I think Vitaly should not go, should not top roll Jerry. He should go sideways from the very beginning.
SPEAKER_01: And he has this move. Sometimes he uses it. And I know that he trains it. So he can win, Jerry. Even in straps you are saying? Yes, even in straps. He can take the center. I think he is able. If he is healthy, he is able. But also Jerry can take the center and...
SPEAKER_01: So whoever takes the center would win? Yes, I think so. So it's all about the start now. Jerry has to stop Laletin somewhere. If he manages to bring his shoulder maybe, I'm not sure. But so about this match you couldn't be sure, is what you are saying?
SPEAKER_01: I would say 55 to Lalesin. I would say that, yes. But not more, not more. And then you wouldn't be surprised if Jerry wins? Yes. He's very uncomfortable for Lalesin. For top-roller guys? Yes. But I'm not sure about his center, Jerry. Sometimes he's slow.
SPEAKER_00: Okay. Let us know. Let us know. It's quick. Okay. Anyways, Ivan, thank you very much, my friend. You are a very, very, very knowledgeable guy and also a great legendary athlete.
