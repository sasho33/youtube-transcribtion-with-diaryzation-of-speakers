SPEAKER_03: yeah yeah yeah i can see that i can see that but he has always been a great arm master i mean he has always been a great top roller and it is great to see him in our events so let's
SPEAKER_01: Talk a little. Did he compete anywhere since his last Supermatch? No, no, no. No, he didn't compete anywhere. Yeah, he had some problems on the left shoulder, so he stopped a bit, but now he's healed 100%, even on the left arm. Okay, Michael came.
SPEAKER_03: Hello, Michael. Hello. We need it to be 100%. Let's go like 85%. Hi, Michael. Okay. Michael, is your connection a little bit or is it something about my connection? I don't know. I should have good connection. I should have full signal. I don't know. How do you guys see Michael? Do you guys see Michael a little bit freezing or not? A bit bad.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, let me go switch to something else. Hang on. Okay. Let me switch. It should be good. That wasn't good.
SPEAKER_03: it may be where you are your location maybe maybe if you move somewhere else yeah now now seems okay anywhere now looks that looks better looks better yeah signal's bad out there so i gotta do it in here okay i know it was bad out there i was cutting out so i gotta do it in here yeah well i mean yeah we're about to go then okay
SPEAKER_03: if possible keep the phone sideways so you can have more i'm trying to yeah thank you
SPEAKER_03: Okay, that's good. That's good. So we are ready to start. Michael, your opponent says that he is 115 kilos. He was 117 because of his birthday. He was not a good boy. He ate a lot. But he is now 115. How about you? I bet you are 265 maybe? Well, that's a funny story because Friday morning,
SPEAKER_00: I was 115.3. Yes, I was 254.4. And then yesterday morning, I was 269.4, so I gained 15 pounds. So are you doing this for...
SPEAKER_03: Like experiments, you know, like... No, it was Easter, so I cheated. I had a cheat day for Easter and I got a bunch of birthday cake and pizza. So are you going to come to Istanbul on your way or you are planning to do some other cuts? Talking to me? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Are you planning to come to Istanbul at like wait 115 or you plan to just one week before last day or something? You plan to do other cuts?
SPEAKER_00: well i hope to get back i mean i hope by sunday i'll be back to 115 you know um like real close to 115 116 something like that because i want to be able to eat on the flight over you know because i fly on tuesday i arrive on wednesday we don't wait until friday you know so hopefully my wage is much closer and then i just cut cut off my food and water thursday night and i just make weight the next day i understand
SPEAKER_03: please add wrist size and playing style like hoop topple with biceps forearms also with the cards of players on videos okay i will consider but i can't promise and and so looks like you neither of you have any any weight problems and so how are the trainings what happened after after paulo match since paulo match what has been happening michael
SPEAKER_00: uh very good training um everything's been going up i took some of your advice with the cupping exercises and um i mean i'm as good as i can be for this match so i've done everything i can do healthy i have no excuses arm feels good one second martino when you translate yeah yeah sorry sorry yeah because i cannot really understand yeah you say that everything is okay michael and yeah yeah arm feels good um are you are you in better shape right you are
SPEAKER_00: better shape then better better than when I pulled Pablo yeah probably probably five percent stronger than when I pulled Pablo but on a couple of lifts quite a bit more than that because um I've got a new video I'm going to upload I don't know tomorrow or something it's my heaviest ever Devon pronation lift so I was pretty pleased with it so okay yeah okay so so that is one of them
SPEAKER_00: with more than 5% increase? Oh, yeah, yeah. I mean, I was not successful at it when Pablo was here. And so it's, I don't know, man, I feel good. Frank's a great arm wrestler. I'm excited to arm wrestling. I was very impressed with his performance against Matt, which is why I asked you to pull him. But yeah, I'm excited for a good match. Michael, you and him, you had a super match 16 years ago or maybe 15 and a half years ago.
SPEAKER_03: You were a different type of bowler then. You were more into the table while you are more like open arm top row. Did Michael, sorry, did Frank surprise you when you come to Italy? Did you like expect it to be easier for you? Because it became a nightmare for both of you, you know? Right. I knew he had a great top row. I'd seen him at the WAF Worlds like
SPEAKER_00: two months before or something like that and I think he did real well in the 100 kg class I mean he just he posts so hard you know he he's tall but he gets down so high with that post pressure and I tried to match him with with the top row and it didn't work I got my hand cracked so then after a couple of rounds I thought I gotta dive in on the press and just hold on for dear life so that's what happened uh-huh and and uh at that time
SPEAKER_03: your style as i said you know was different and today is different style do you think that your style of today will do better against frank than that time i'm certainly hoping so oh yeah yeah it needs to do better because that was a bad that was a hard match yeah yeah yeah i understand but stylistically that would be better for you to do open on top roll against him
SPEAKER_03: Well, I mean, the version of me right now would destroy the version of me from then. But I'm sure the version of Frank now would be the version of Frank then too, right? And Frank, did you expect to beat him in 2008 when he came to the Supermatch 2008? I didn't expect to beat him, because Michael Todd was already very strong.
SPEAKER_01: I was growing up, I was one of those, I was an emerging player in Italy and so I was still waiting to play, to hope not to lose 3-0 and to have won the first two shots for me it was an escalation, I was very happy. Then I also lost 3-2 anyway, to lose 3-2 with a name, a champion, a character like Michael Todd, it still made me
SPEAKER_01: It was a great experience. Now I think it will be even more difficult to do this challenge.
SPEAKER_02: so he's saying that he wasn't expecting to win uh because he was still like a newcomer in the italian arm wrestling scene so it was a great opportunity for him he was super glad not to lose trio and that was his main goal let's say because even just by winning the first round he was like so happy because it wasn't against nobody but it was i guess michael todd
SPEAKER_02: so uh to face such an established puller such a great name it was already a victory for him um both on like the personal uh point of view and also as an arm wrestler because it also boosted like his his career and also he's saying that this time he think it will be more difficult
SPEAKER_01: For who? The match in general or is it going to be difficult for you? The match in general is going to be difficult for me. It's going to be difficult for me because even my shot has changed a little over the years. But Michael Todd has become much stronger than when we shot 15 years ago. I've grown a little less.
SPEAKER_02: So he thinks that he's the underdog because he thinks that yes, he improved and his way of pulling changed a bit. But he thinks that Michael Todd went from when he faced him to a good puller to an elite level. So Michael established himself way more than he did. So Michael climbed way more from that match in his opinion. So he feels like he's a heavy underdog because Michael is like very strong.
SPEAKER_03: Michael, do you think this guy is doing mind tricks right now, playing perception games, by saying that he's the only underdog in this? Do you really think that in his head, he believes in sidetrack?
SPEAKER_00: I believe he's come to this match to beat me. So what I think, um, so we're both going to give it our best and may the best man win. So, like I said, I I'm very aware of how strong Frank is and what he did to Matt mass was extremely impressive. Um, I just, like I said, I think we're both come to this thing as prepared as we can be. We both want to want to win and, uh,
SPEAKER_00: The coolest thing about Frank is he's a nice guy. I like him. But I do need to get a little bit of that fire back that I've had in the past. So I'm excited to get on stage and get a good international ready go. That's what I'm looking for. Frank, what is the part that will be the most difficult for you to beat, Michael? The hardest part will be his usual joint block.
SPEAKER_01: It's impossible to pull it down, but you try and there's nothing to be done. I think it's faster than when we did the challenge 15 years ago. It has a very fast start and that could put me in a bit of a crisis, but then you have to see the start with the goal.
SPEAKER_02: So he's saying that proteins
SPEAKER_02: first one is of course michael is known for his crazy good sticking point so of course the match will become way more difficult the closer to the part that he gets and he doesn't know yet if he will be able to crack that angle as time as many times as he needs and also that michael is very fast and he thinks that he become he became way faster than when they faced the first time and michael also has a great press from the good so he thinks that you need
SPEAKER_02: when you face Michael not only to be aware of his defensive capabilities but also of his crazy good offensive capabilities if you focus only on this you will get pressed down yeah and the question is has Michael ever sorry has Frank ever done shoulder press to finish his opponent
SPEAKER_03: And does he plan to do that this time? He says no? He's basically going for like top or nothing. What's that?
SPEAKER_03: Top roll or nothing? Okay. If you are saying the truth, then Michael is probably feeling more relaxed than 30 seconds ago.
SPEAKER_03: Because hard to finish, hard to finish that even Pushkar, rest in peace, had such trouble, you know. Anyway, so Michael, do you agree with the statements that like,
SPEAKER_03: if you are only focused, if you're open and only focused on your sticking point, you know, to finish, but if they ignore the shoulder press, which is like your time to time, do you seem like you're gonna go out, but just suddenly you're going in? Do you agree with that? Yeah, I mean, it's pretty obvious what I'm good at, right? So, and that's, I mean, the biggest thing is,
SPEAKER_00: In the past, if I can stop the match, I usually can win the match. In my recent performances, I didn't always win the long matches. My wrists would get compromised or someone would turn my palm up some, climb my fingers, transition to press. I've been working on those things a lot. I do still have access. I probably have better access to my shoulder press now than I have had in recent years due to the more range of motion.
SPEAKER_00: I'm excited to test myself. So that's it. I mean, I'm excited to test myself. Now, do I want to try to win conventionally? Of course. But if it means I have to full-blown Kings move within the rules, of course, to win this match, I'll do whatever I have to do to win, right? No doubt. No doubt.
SPEAKER_00: i'm taking i'm taking frank as serious as i have any match ever um this this comeback to me is very important and uh i'm excited to be across the table from somebody who who poses such a threat because he is a very established top roller and 115 kg which recently was 117 kg is a bigger
SPEAKER_03: uh frank lamprelli than the one that pulled matt mask i believe he's like 105 and he pulled uh matt so this is a heavier bigger person i think he was heavier than 105 because i wasn't because everybody's talking about him being upper class i mean he no he he wasn't exactly the same okay well okay well in 2022 michael pulled supers
SPEAKER_02: Oh, Frank pulled supers, yeah. You remember, what's that? His matches back off is amazing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Quick note. Even when Frank pulls the opens, he always weighs the same. He never went up over 115 in his life. Yeah, but 115 is already supers. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But it wasn't heavier than last match. Wow, okay, cool. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: There is a super illusion because he looks really big from here. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't think I ever listen. Sometimes people look bigger because of muscle percentages more and fat percentages less. I think this is how I don't remember Frank looking like this before. Like what I see right now, I don't remember like this. I don't know. Shoulders, everything. He looks really big, you know.
SPEAKER_03: It is the camera. It is the camera. It's only camera, right? Only him, right? Not you. The camera just works for him. Yeah. Okay. John Hutchison. Super excited to watch Michael come back and compete. Let's go, monster. Yeah. Okay. So...
SPEAKER_03: I can't remember from my head. Frank, what is your rank at the East versus West under 15K? Nine. Nine, okay. He's saying the last one. Now listen, we all start from somewhere and then go up, you know? Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: And Michael, your main goal is right now 115? Yeah, I mean, I can't say it's my main goal. That's the two matches that I have accepted are at the 115. It's so much easier for me to be bigger. Like, my body just naturally wants to weigh more. But short-term, 115? Of course, of course. Like, you want to hit the title for the 115 before Supers, right?
SPEAKER_00: My main goal is beating Frank. That's my main goal. All that other stuff later, I have a plan. But it looks like I could beat Frank. Frank just said that you are lucky to have such a long bird because it will cover the elbow folds. Hey, whatever it takes, man. It's strategy. Strategy.
SPEAKER_03: anyway so and and michael he said that he said that he your sticking point and your shoulder pressure um how about prank just hand control
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I mean, Frank applies a lot of leverage the way he arm wrestles. Like, he gets a lot of just leverage off. He posts off his elbow. His knuckles stay high. His riser stays intact. He's got great pronation. His fingertips look strong. His containment looks good. I do have a strategy of what I plan on doing. It's just am I strong enough to do it? So we'll see.
SPEAKER_03: I remember about 10 years ago, your riser was incredible when you pulled Pushkar for the first time. A little bit more than 10 years ago. And then later, did you have some kind of problem with the riser for a short time?
SPEAKER_00: well I had nerve damage in my hand and uh I lost a lot of my control the things that made me me kind of I didn't have access to for a bit I think I had I mean so when I had my elbow surgery and when I had the bicep reattachment they took a large percentage of bone outside the front to close this angle right because it used to not come here now it closes to here right they took a bunch of bone out they were going to go into the back side
SPEAKER_00: Um, but they ran out of time because he thought it was my two and a half hour surgery is four and a half hour surgery. But the one thing he did get to was right here. He had a compressed on the nerve and I hadn't felt these two fingers since 2007. So they decompress the owner. Well, that compression, the owner nerve is what caused this nerve damage in my hand that may basically made this whole thumb muscle atrophy. So it's starting to come back. So the hand feels strong. The pronation feels strong. Um,
SPEAKER_00: My riser so far hasn't, hasn't really been, been dropped in training or anything so far. Um, not saying that it, it's not possible to, to force drop. It feels like it's intact. It feels like it's like I would, you know, obviously we don't have a time machine, but I honestly, God, like my chances, this may be crazy, but I like my chances where I'm at right now today versus the guy that beat push car in 2012. Hmm.
SPEAKER_00: I think I'm close to that guy. That was a very strong version. I mean, it's a very confident version. And that's the thing. You can be strong, but if you're not confident in your capabilities, I mean, sometimes you can't access all that power on the table because your mind's not there. And I've been working a whole lot on getting... 2023 is a very rough year for me.
SPEAKER_00: especially uh so a lot the arm wrestling and tearing the bicep that was just part of it obviously losing my mother was hardest thing ever went through my life and took me a whole lot to try to get on the other side of that so I've been I've been working hard both physically and mentally so so where did you see the problem if you saw any when you pull against Paulo
SPEAKER_00: uh my cup wasn't as strong as i i want i thought it was i thought my cup would be stronger any improvement since that time today yeah yeah quite a bit actually i believe so um now artem came and trained with me and he actually i i don't know how to set up in the straps really like what i'm supposed to do and he did show me a couple of things that felt a lot better so maybe i'll get a chance to to see if that works you know
SPEAKER_00: i pull when i pull frank you know i have not done a whole lot of arm wrestling since pablo um i've just been doing a lot of training like that's the biggest thing is you and i know how to arm wrestle frank knows how to arm wrestle we all know arm wrestlers it's getting stronger in the areas to make you stronger at arm wrestling right i don't necessarily need to arm wrestle to get better arm wrestling i just need to be stronger to execute the techniques that i want to use right yeah but
SPEAKER_01: And Frank, how is your shape right now? Like compared to the all other time, just say compared to the match compared to the before. I feel good, I feel good, I don't have any pain. My usual problem is that I still manage to train very little, both for the problem with work, since I'm always on board the ship,
SPEAKER_01: When you get home, you have that hour every now and then. I've done a bit of weight training at home, and unlike with Mask, I've done table training three times. This time I've done six table trainings. I don't know if they'll be enough with Michael, but this is the time I have.
SPEAKER_01: at the moment I can dedicate to the arm of iron unfortunately it is not my job and I think I am a little stronger than when I shot with mask but not having shot with anyone I can not
SPEAKER_01: I can't have a real confrontation. But certainly not worse. Yes, not worse. And compared to the past? Well, I'm in a better shape. More than anything, I'm calmer-headed, so once I was much more agitated.
SPEAKER_02: so first of all he's saying that his shape now i start from the end his shape now is either the best one or one of the best of his life because now like michael said he has a lot more confidence he's way more way more more calm and he doesn't let like the the his nerves affecting his performance on the table
SPEAKER_02: And I think that is at least as good as when he faced Matt Mask. But it is difficult to say if he's better because he hasn't pulled with anyone strong enough to know how he feels. It's not a problem, but how he feels great. He doesn't have any pain. He feels great.
SPEAKER_02: He said that when he trained for Matt Mask, he did only three timetables, and this time for Michael, he did six timetables. But his problem is that he works on a ship, he has a very tight schedule, and the time that he has to give to the sport is not as much as he wanted it to be.
SPEAKER_02: to be for example you can train like maximum maximum three times per week but more often than not is a bit less than that because he's in the ship and he really can't train he has maybe just one hour and he tries to train in the tower but not every not not everything goes like
SPEAKER_02: wants he's very envious of uh when he see my when he sees michael training like a madman he's very envious because he really wanted to push himself like michael does just like to feel really accomplished of giving everything to the sport but he can't so he giving his best with the timing yes
SPEAKER_01: He's always welcome to come over and train with me if he ever wants to come to America.
SPEAKER_02: He's saying that, of course, he's coming to win, but even winning just one round, he will take that as a victory because he says that he trains so little that even one round for him is a huge victory because he says that if he really could train as much as he wanted, it would be a different person.
SPEAKER_01: with Michael and still do a show where even if you lose but you manage to give a show that is to play every shot with a name like his and still it only brings you points or in any case a beautiful thing
SPEAKER_02: is also saying that as you mentioned multiple times before hanging there is a huge difference between three zero and three zero because you can lose but if every round is a war like super close it is different from like getting flashed so he says that
SPEAKER_02: um the things that he looks forward the most is not like winning rosie of course he wants to win but like he wants to give a spectacle you want to give a really tough match you want to be in the fight and like for both of men it it will be a struggle that yeah i i i'm not gonna have you know any prediction at all but i can give him guarantee that this match will be a war
SPEAKER_03: This match is going to be all because you have such a great hand control and Michael has an incredible defense and I don't think that neither of you will dominate each other.
SPEAKER_01: He's saying that the most important thing is to have fun because he does arm wrestling only because it brings fun to him and that he won't lose his smile and losing his smile
SPEAKER_03: for him it's very difficult but it is the only thing that cares about so having fun yeah by the way probably he didn't listen here or you didn't hear but michael said that uh frank is always welcome to his home in us to train did i understand correctly michael or of course of course anytime yeah
SPEAKER_03: Frank says perfectly because we are so close, we could be great sparring partners. Exactly. Here you go. Be fun, Tom. Don't be too lovely before the match. Anyway, Armfella, super chat. Thank you. I want to send good vibes to the both of you. Michael, I admire you for everything you have done. You have gone through, sorry. And Frank, tutti no... tutti...
SPEAKER_03: voglia amo bene i don't know what that means what does it mean oh it means everyone loves you ah yeah yeah frank is very likable guy yeah yeah let's see
SPEAKER_03: anyways so let's let's talk a little bit about the uh event guys um generally michael do you think that this may be the best east versus west in your opinion or one of the best how do you see this one well it's definitely one of the best but we have probably the most anticipated match of all time with devin and lavon on the card so that's exciting and to be there and have a front row seat for that's exciting but
SPEAKER_00: Like I told you last time, when I was there just commentating, it's always fun just to be around my friends. You know, arm wrestling is just a big extended family to me. So to get there and to fellowship and hang out and this opportunity to get to compete again, it's just exciting to me. So I think this is going to be an amazing card. I think it'll be the most watched card you've ever had, whether it's the best.
SPEAKER_00: i think it's definitely one of them but i think they'll definitely be the most watched card i think the most in-person watch card you'll ever have will be the one uh in orlando i think that place is gonna be packed but yeah this card coming up is gonna be great yeah orlando
SPEAKER_03: I think it will be a dream team. I think it will be like a US team, not US, but North American team that we have never witnessed before. That will be, I mean, I don't want to now all do names, you know, mentioning, but it will be incredible. Yeah. And let's start with...
SPEAKER_03: Frank. Frank probably knows some of these guys better than Michael knows because some of them are very waft type of guys. You know, Michael has competed waft, but I think last time he competed, when was the last time you competed? 2008 or? 2009 in Italy. Italy, yeah. Only left arm though. I only pulled left-handed there. Yeah, I remember. Yeah, yeah. Anyway, so let's start. Petro Marharin versus Nugo Cicadze.
SPEAKER_03: Frank, you remember Nugo from the last Europeans? In Moldova? Yeah, when you had a very tough match with Reno Masic. He remembers everyone. He said that he remembers them. And he thinks that Nugo will win. Nugo will win? Really? Maybe. But do you remember Petro Marcarinzi? Ah, because, in my opinion, he prepared himself.
SPEAKER_01: He's saying that
SPEAKER_02: looks very prepared and uh it is also a mental thing so maybe the man that wants it more will win and of course and of course they say that petro is difficult to say in which exact shape it is so maybe the one that is more like active at the moment can have a lead but what if they both are in a best shape
SPEAKER_01: Petro, who when he did the Mendoza. It would be hard because he could have won at the last minute, even to make them. So that's the speech, you know, because even there they count. Sometimes you win, you get there, it's a war, you get to do a two-to-two, the third, maybe you win it, you're tired and one wins it to make them. So in my opinion it's a nice battle.
SPEAKER_02: It will be a war, but it's very difficult to say prime shape of this one, prime shape of that one. And also he thinks that a lot can happen, like falls and stuff. So it's difficult to say with those athletes who would win in prime shape.
SPEAKER_03: Michael, are you familiar with these guys? You haven't seen them at the East vs. West, but do you know who Petro Marharin is? Petro Marharin is the guy in Moldova that beat all the guys. Beat Rivas and John. John, Rivas and other guys as well. Sandris and other guys, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: he looks very impressive that's the guy you mentioned me pulling so um i'm gonna go with him the last europeans you know in this everyone you know yeah
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, but you said, I mean, this guy, the Petro guy can pretty much force almost anybody in hook. Yeah, and the other guy we don't see being forced in hook. Yeah, that makes an interesting match then. I wouldn't honestly be able to make an opinion, but I'm going to go with Petro just because he looks strong in the Moldova event. That's what I got. Okay. Michael, you know Brandon Assessor very well. He has competed in your events. And I'm sure you also know who Stoyan Goliamano is.
SPEAKER_03: Of course. Yeah, S√∏ren Golemano is like, same as Frank Lamparelli, to me, one of the best hand control, you know, top rollers. So how do you see this match? Because we don't see the brand and the light category now is huge. And yeah, how do you see this one?
SPEAKER_00: I'm always very impressed with how hard Brandon trains. Um, he puts in, he puts in the work for sure.
SPEAKER_00: uh stallion is like on the match where i beat push car in 2012 he was pulling todd hutchins that day and he looked he gave todd all he could possibly handle so if he's anywhere near that form that's a that's a bad bad dude obviously i'm gonna i'm gonna go with brandon because he's a fellow united states guy but i mean stoion if he comes in for him i mean he's the more accomplished of the two athletes but i think brandon may be the hunger of the two
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, you're right. By the way, Stojan gave hell to Tatachins but lost 6-0, as far as I remember. Yeah, I thought it was 5-1, but it might have been 6-0. Maybe 5-1, maybe 5-1. I can't remember. I only know that Tatachins won, but he toppled him, but he couldn't finish him. That was a mess. And how do you see it? Do you know Brandon Assessor, Frank? Yes, he knows everyone. He knows everyone, that's all right.
SPEAKER_01: So I think so. What's his name? Golemanov. I remember Golemanov when he shot Edmil Faroku in a revenge. And he shot him because he's very, very good. He has a small hand, Golemanov, but he can use it anyway. He has that malice in the starts. So in my opinion I give the victory.
SPEAKER_01: Even though he's as old as I am, I give the victory to Golemanov because he's very good at starting and he knows how to use his hand a lot. Even though it's a small hand, he knows how to use it and he puts those with big hands like mine in trouble.
SPEAKER_02: So he's saying that he knows both of them. And of course, Brandon Alcesto is younger and more angry. But Stoyan, even though he's as old as him, he joked about it. He said that he knows him very well because it had a six-match supermatch against Edmir Ferrocu. And he won that match because he was very good with his hand placement, like a really top role master. And despite his hand being small, because he said that Stoyan's hand is not that big, he's like,
SPEAKER_02: super super smart at how attacks you in every good position and he says that he was able to put in difficult even someone with an hand because in so he thinks that historian will win because of uh is not table IQ but more experience and malice in the setup so it will be like it will take everything from Brandon in the setup and top for him like uh with hand control
SPEAKER_02: I mean, if it is referee's grip or something, it's very hard to take anything, you know. You know, because, yeah, because the referee is going to... It didn't mean that it's cheating. It didn't mean that, like, it's every time, like, in the perfect position, and when he starts applying pressure, it is every time the pressure, like, in the points that matter. No wasted pressure. Okay. I understand. Yeah. Let's go. Are you familiar with these guys, Michael?
SPEAKER_03: more time who was it betkili oniani from georgia i don't know if you saw or not you know like maybe a month ago at the arm wrestling engine uh facebook group they put a match of red sardakian you know the armenian guy yeah and and oh this guy beat him
SPEAKER_03: no they had like two minutes three minutes you know long like many stars fouls you know war you know what finally was 2018 world final and berkeley
SPEAKER_03: is um that guy that was right here with uh restaurant and his opponent is active that is i go with him yeah he's a bad dude that's what i got yeah i love that guy he's awesome he's so explosive i don't know if he's gonna win but i love watching him arm wrestle
SPEAKER_03: They pulled in 2017, but it was 75 kilos, 165 only. And at that time, Badkile won. Cal got lost. And he started quick, but Badkile has incredible endurance and he won. But now they are 20 kilos, 44 pounds heavier than at that time. Wow. Yeah. Yeah. Let's see. And I'm sure he knows them. Frank has pulled in the same WAF events. All...
SPEAKER_01: I think Talgat wins because he's very fast. He's very fast and even if he has 20kg more, I think both of them, I give Talgat the victory. It's a very fast start.
SPEAKER_02: but this time he feels that Talgat active will be too much and he sees a 3-1 victory maybe for Talgat because of his speed and despite both of them having gained 20 kilograms he thinks that the 20 kilograms that Talgat active made him stronger compared to Betkely so he thinks that Talgat will win due to his speed and massive
SPEAKER_00: I understand. Okay. Let's go to the next one. We have Tobias Sporong versus Kamila Blonsky, Michael. Look at Fred. You got to be impressed with Kamil arm wrestling, Cody Merritt, and then two days later, Devin Laird and beating both of them. You know what I mean? That's crazy impressive. But Tobias Sporong is an animal.
SPEAKER_00: Like what he just did to Wagon World Lotto was horrible. So unless Camille can somehow ‚Äì I'm going Tobias in a sweet 3-0. But Camille could shock me because I had no idea he was going to be able to do what he did to Cody and Devin. But, I mean, Tobias to me is a couple levels ahead of those two guys. Oh. You mean the two guys that he beat? Yes.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I don't I mean, I don't see how Cody or Devin would stop Tobias's long lever explosive hit. I think it would just be the guy. What? Man, he's super impressive. I don't know. I mean, I know Vitaly beat him, but that kid and he's young, too. Right. Yeah. Yeah. I think I like Camille.
SPEAKER_03: Camille's doing good with the social media. Camille's making funny posts on his social, so I like watching his social. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Whole family, whole family together. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's good stuff. They're having very good fun, you know, and I think they are doing good promotion, you know, good promotion. But who is winning here? I got to go with Tobias. Okay. You think that he needs to pull in the same way that he pulled against Wagner?
SPEAKER_00: I mean, they pull the same move. Wagner and Camille are doing the same thing, basically, right? I mean, I think Wagner wants to have a little bit more risk control. Camille doesn't care. And Camille's younger, so he might be better than Wagner. He might very well be better than Wagner, you know what I mean? But I don't know how you get around Tobias. His center of the table control just looks like I don't know how he's going to knock him out of center.
SPEAKER_01: And I think he's so fast, I don't think he's going to get a chance to. I think it could look very similar to the Maraschinko-Camille right-handed match. Ok. And Frank? Let's start from the beginning. I've always lost weight with weightlifting. And even if I've gained a lot of weight in recent years, I don't think the increase in weight has brought an increase in proportion to an increase in strength.
SPEAKER_01: Tobias beat him big time, but I don't think Bortolato is the fast and technical Bortolato. Bortolato has a different press than Camille. Camille is an emerging truck. They are both very strong. It will be tough. It's hard for me to give a point to Camille.
SPEAKER_01: But it will be tough for Camille and for both of them because Tobias manages to stop the press and Camille has increased his strength. It will be tough, but it's one of the good matches to watch.
SPEAKER_02: So he says that, first of all, it is one of the match that is most interesting in and one of the closest one in his opinion. And basically said that he won't be surprised if either of them win. At the same time, he thinks that Camille maybe has a slight edge with his strength and also because he pulls differently than Wagner. And also he said that he had a long history with Wagner and in the past, he always lost to Wagner, frankly.
SPEAKER_02: But he thinks that the weight gain that Wagner had in those years didn't do him any favor. Basically, he gained a lot of weight, but he lost speed. He lost technical ability. He thinks that the Wagner of today is not the fast, explosive and cunning Wagner that he used to pull. So he thinks that, of course, Tobias is very good at preventing a presser from entering the press. But at the same time,
SPEAKER_02: that Wagner might not have been the best representation of Wagner as a puller. And he thinks that Tobias is crazy strong, crazy fast, pulls the right way, but the press of Wagner, the press of Kamil are different, and that Kamil might be just too strong. But, of course, he said this multiple times, he thinks that either way they are close. He won't be so effective.
SPEAKER_03: yeah yeah he is not expecting like a clear sweep he said that could go either way but if he has like to toss a coin and say the name it will be coming because he also gained weight so maybe too strong okay quickly this people chat alexander uh can you ask frank about his dream training weight like can he tell us quickly because we need to finish these predictions a dream training
SPEAKER_01: gym training weights like the weights that he is lifting yeah maybe a few examples so he's saying that he does bench press with 100 kilograms he does like a shoulder press with 30 kilograms each hand and then he does like a hammer curl with 30 kilograms each hand
SPEAKER_03: Full motion, like this? Yeah, perfect motion. Perfect motion. Perfect motion. Perfect motion. Perfect motion. Perfect motion. Perfect motion. Perfect motion. Perfect motion. Perfect motion. Perfect motion. Perfect motion. Perfect motion. Perfect motion. Perfect motion. Perfect motion. Perfect motion. Perfect motion. Perfect motion. Perfect motion. Perfect motion. Perfect motion. Perfect motion. Perfect motion. Perfect motion. Perfect motion. Perfect motion. Perfect motion. Perfect motion. Perfect motion. Perfect motion. Perfect motion. Perfect motion. Perfect motion. Perfect motion. Perfect motion. Perfect motion. Perfect motion. Perfect motion. Perfect motion. Perfect motion. Perfect motion. Perfect motion. Perfect motion. Perfect motion. Perfect motion. Perfect motion. Perfect motion. Perfect motion. Perfect motion. Perfect motion. Perfect motion. Perfect motion. Perfect motion. Perfect motion. Perfect motion. Perfect motion. Perfect motion. Perfect motion. Perfect motion. Perfect motion. Perfect motion. Perfect motion. Perfect motion. Perfect motion. Perfect motion. Perfect motion. Perfect motion. Perfect motion. Perfect motion. Perfect motion. Perfect motion.
SPEAKER_00: I think, what's the other guy's name again? Ibrahim. Ibrahim. I think he's a stronger presser. So if he gets his press in and Sanders presses with him, I think he'll beat Sanders. But what I think will probably happen is that guy might beat Sanders once or twice, and Sanders will figure him out and then find a way to win 3-2. Hmm.
SPEAKER_00: Okay. Which way? Top road? Sideway? Or whatever way? Whatever lane is available, but I would think it would probably be some way, probably in the strap, top road, something. Okay. I don't know. I mean, but the other guy could win 3-0 too, Ibrahim. I can't say his name right. Ibrahim is the same as the American name Abraham, you know, is the same. Ibrahim. The same, the prophet's name, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: He's very impressive. I mean, he gave Todd Hutchins all Todd could handle, you know. Very impressive guy. Very, very good match he was, yeah. And Frank? I think Sandwich will win. He's very skillful in the shingles as well as being very versatile. At the moment, it's the young version of Michael Todd if you add the beard. No, no, I think Sandwich will win.
SPEAKER_02: so he said that first of all sandries is clearly the younger michael todd without the bell so if we have to make him grow up here then it's michael todd 2.0 and he thinks sandries will win like michael said because he's more versatile and he has like a lot of different routes and he also in this trap is very tactile very smart so he expects sandries to find a way to win
SPEAKER_03: Okay, so you both are saying that Ibrahim is very strong, but since Sanderis can pull in different ways, he will figure out and find a way to win. That's what they are saying. Okay, I understand. Let's go to the next one. Very, very big match. Sasho versus Irakli. 95 kilos. Incredible match. I really hope that
SPEAKER_03: I'm sure the majority of the community realizes the level, but this, I don't think at 95, you know, I don't think there is anything more than this to, you know, on the earth right now. Go ahead. I think, I think Iraq. You think Iraq? Yeah. I mean, Sasha is extremely impressive how well he beat John. It was just, he's, he's a stud. Um, but I think Iraq has got his number.
SPEAKER_00: I think there's something to that pronation, top roll, speed. I just think he's going to be able to expose. I think so. I don't think Sasha gets him turned in. Did you know that they pulled three years ago? I think I've seen something, but I don't remember who won.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, Paul Van Sasho won, but it was three years ago. Was that at your event? My event, yeah. That's what I thought. Yeah, I remember that. I remember that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I probably picked Rackley then too. Yeah, he was close. I mean, the first round he won, and then it was war, and then he guessed out. If the match is close...
SPEAKER_00: In my opinion, Sasho has better endurance, but we don't know if the match is going to be closed or Irakli is going to dominate. We don't know that yet. I think there's something to be said to be training with Levan. I just think having that guy as your training partner pushes you harder than probably anyone else out there gets pushed. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_03: But just think about it. You're training with Levan and Levan is mainly outside puller. But Irakli is losing his wrist to John, lost against Ongarbe, lost against Tariq and all outside pullers. Sometimes, yeah, he doesn't really, I don't know, I don't understand how it happens. And Frank?
SPEAKER_01: They are both very strong. I like both of them. Then they have big biceps like my head. It's hard because... I don't know. I see Sasho more... He has a lot more resistance, in my opinion. A lot. He has a little more resistance. It will be a war. Even here I see it difficult to give a...
SPEAKER_01: So he said that both of them have biceps as big as his head.
SPEAKER_02: And it's very difficult for him to predict this match because he starts and says, like, Irakli will win. Then he thinks about Sasha having a better endurance. And so he changed his mind. I think, OK, Sasha with endurance maybe will win. Then he thinks about it again and changes his mind again. So it's like really on the razor sharp edge, like,
SPEAKER_02: he can go either way for him and it's impossible for him to predict like oh he will win because he sees a route for both of them to win the match iraqi can just mash him but at the same time he could get tired out and maybe three two uh sasha with endurance yeah so
SPEAKER_03: The reason that he is saying this way, because his experience, brain experience, and he can see the abilities of both Atlas. But at the last point, the power, power says the last word. It's hard to measure the power that they will generate at that moment. So we don't know it yet.
SPEAKER_03: even they don't know that they will understand when they pull you know so it is not easy to really predict yeah razer says what about an official poll for the match of the day with a prize stay strong guys yeah that's good idea yeah i think we should do that yeah but if i put devon
SPEAKER_03: In that poll, most likely he's going to win because he has the most pants. Whatever you put there, I think he's going to get the most votes. But who knows? Yeah, let's go. Leonidas, Arcona versus Coolboy. Michael. Well, I just did a prediction video on my channel, and this was the first match I talked about.
SPEAKER_00: School boy, that right arm just looks insane. I mean, either they're photoshopping him or that right arm really got big since he tore his left bicep. Right. So, and some people just still don't realize how big he is. I mean, he's six foot five, 270, massive, massive dude. Now Leonidas continues to impress me because, um, I didn't expect him to be Larry at the last game of table. And so, I mean, I think school boy has to be the favorite.
SPEAKER_03: But nothing surprises me nowadays. But I would go with schoolboy. I understand. Yeah. Did you know that, you know, that I think I saw you doing the training that Matushenko is doing. You remember? Yeah. Did you know that schoolboy came to visit Matushenko? He did that wrist training more than Larekin and more than Ivan Matushenko.
SPEAKER_03: Wow. Yeah. He said that those three schoolboy was the strongest one. That's what he told me. Do you know what weight they're using? What are they using there? I don't really know, but we can ask you if you want. But I can give you his WhatsApp number. You can ask if you want. But it's surprising that he's stronger than those guys. That's crazy. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: he's got he's got a very bright future i mean like i said he is a very large human and he seems to really love arm wrestling so yeah i agree and frank all right
SPEAKER_01: As far as the exercise is concerned, I don't really believe in the records of the exercises with machines and so on, because I think it is the living proof that the exercises with me matter little. I do with the biceps less than most women and the arm of iron.
SPEAKER_01: So I don't think it's worth it. For example, I've never trained my wrist. I started doing exercises to cover my wrist before Matt Mask, so I don't think I'll do any record exercises. But I think Leonidas will surprise us this time as well.
SPEAKER_02: so first thing that i want to personally add because i remember the number it was like 87 kilogram for michael he was wondering about the number and frank says that of course those numbers are impressive but he doesn't believe in number he says that he lifts personally like half the number of the woman and wrestling and um he thinks that numbers don't translate as good as to the table as many people think yeah yeah
SPEAKER_02: And for example, he said that he personally never, never trained his wrist in his life, like never. Only at the table, only at the competition or table training. Yeah, he never did. And for the first time for Matt Musk, he tried a bit and the numbers weren't that good. But he says that my numbers are not good, but then on the table, I have a very good hand control. So he thinks that there is a discrepancy between numbers and strength on the table.
SPEAKER_02: And also it says that Leonidas is like the man of surprise. Every match, every time they think he will lose, and then he surprises everyone. He did it one time, he did it two times, three times. So he thinks that this time as well, maybe Leonidas will surprise everyone. So he thinks Leonidas will win. Yeah, tomorrow Schoolboy and Leonidas will be my guests.
SPEAKER_03: Uh, in the, on this channel and yeah, that that's interesting because at the beginning you also went to training, uh, Larry Wills, but after Larry Wills just committed to armwrestling more and more in US, we saw that like he gave trouble to Sandris. I heard that he is causing problems with Derek Smith and we saw even some table training with John.
SPEAKER_03: I mean, he was very strong, but Leonidas was able to beat him with right arm as well. Leonidas is different. He comes to East versus West to watch, and after the event, he does some after pulls. Every time I saw him, he was better and better and better after pull.
SPEAKER_03: And I see that he still doesn't have the close angles, but his bicep in this angle is just incredible. If he really gets you there, it will be very, very hard to outlast him. I want to add to that point.
SPEAKER_02: I remember very well what you are saying because I was there as well. And the first time in the after pool, he struggled with Mark Basile and the time that the, after the, the time that, sorry, the next time it was like with Zurab. So he went from like Mark Basile to Zurab in month. So he's really improving. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, so let's go to the next one. Fear Isaac versus Ekaterina Nikisheva. Michael.
SPEAKER_00: man uh both amazing arm wrestlers right uh i just have a hard time ever betting against fia i mean she's very disciplined very determined but i mean both of them are like i said very very accomplished arm wrestlers um i just and i'm not sure but i think fia just is more active and just i don't know i gotta go for you
SPEAKER_03: I understand. This match, I know the ladies wouldn't want me to say this, but this match may be a little personal as well, but I'm not going to go into that. First time I offered this match to Fia, Fia rejected. And the second time, Fia accepted. And this time, Ekaterina rejected. And the third time, finally, they both accepted. But I'm not going to go into details, but
SPEAKER_03: You know, that is one of the, my opinion, looks very silent, but very intense, trust me. And when the women are intense, it may be sometimes more serious than men, you know.
SPEAKER_01: I don't doubt that. Frank, you have pulled in the same events with FIAA and with Catarina. How do you see this match? I think I'll win. I'll give the win to FIAA. First, because it's the only one that says I'll win against Michael. It's the only one in the world. So I support it for that. Secondly, I think, aside from the jokes,
SPEAKER_01: She's very experienced and she's never stopped as long as Niki Seba, so I think she's much more prepared than FIA.
SPEAKER_02: So he's saying that first of all, in every life and in every poll, everyone is giving Michael Todd as winner. And the only person that said that Frank will win was Fia. So Fia automatically wins the match. Bro, Frank is, Frank just at the beginning,
SPEAKER_03: He says something like, Engin, as you always say, remember you translate it, you know? And then I was like, Frank, do you speak English? You know, it looks like you understand because how do you know I always say this? In the second of all, now he says that in every podcast, people say Michael Wynne. It looks like he is really following. Yeah, he says that he likes to follow every athlete.
SPEAKER_02: And despite this, he thinks that Fia will win because she never stops, basically. She's way more active than Ekaterina. So with these type of matches, the hype of Ekaterina might be a question mark. With Fia, we have seen her perform every event, so it's difficult to doubt someone that never stops. So it goes with Fia.
SPEAKER_03: Come on, bullshit. We know the real reason. He just told one minute ago. I'm just joking. Anyway, so this is the match of the GOAT. Who is going to win? You think this time GOAT is going to win? Greatest of all times, Michael? Who are we talking about? Mindagas Tarasaitis.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So, um... Artur Makaro, I mean, but one second, one second, one second. You couldn't even realize quickly when I said the goat? You better hope that Mindaugas is not in the comments section. I'm telling you, right? So, what Mindaugas did to Daniel was remarkable. Perfect display. Did you expect that? Did you expect...
SPEAKER_00: No, but it was a perfect display of arm wrestling. You know what I'm saying? Spectacular. Now, Arthur is the guy that beat you. You know what I'm saying? And I've seen you beat Madagascar. So it's, I mean, obviously Madagascar. The second match, even Arthur doesn't think that he beat me. He says that I was pretty good beating him 5-0 if I didn't get injured. There you go. Okay.
SPEAKER_03: No, no, you know what happened with Bicep. The first two rounds, it was a total of nine seconds. The same guy, Alain Zola, in the same year, beat him. Two matches was like 130 seconds, more than two minutes. They played in Romania. Yeah, anyway, so, yeah, I have to say sorry about it. That's okay. Just out of sheer wanting to be...
SPEAKER_00: The guy, I think Mendoza will find a way to win. He's just a specialist, right? Very cerebral. And he will take his losses to find that weakness, to find that angle, that lane that he can attack. So I think it might be a 4-3 victory, but I think Mendoza will win. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, this guy is very smart. I'm sure Artur is generally strong. Only one second. Michael said 4-3. More horsepower. What's that? Sorry. Michael said 4-3, but it is not a title match, if I'm not wrong. It is a title match because Mindavas is champion. Champion. Yeah. So it's 4-4. Okay, okay.
SPEAKER_01: You know Makarov. He's saying that since Makarov beat Engin, Makarov will win. No, no, for me Makarov is very strong. So, having seen the last meetings,
SPEAKER_02: He explained that of course he likes to joke but Frank when he gives his prediction he always thinks that the past history of the pullers and like he said before he likes to know everyone and he remembers their history and that in the past Makarov always won against Mindaugas. Except one time, except one match that in 2018 one round Mindaugas won in the final.
SPEAKER_03: In the rematch? He remembers that and he says that in his opinion, Makarov will win. Oh, okay. I mean, I can see if that match stops somewhere. I mean, stops in the way that Mindaugas stops. Mindaugas likes that it will be. Okay, this one I want quick, just percentage, Michael. Michael Todd versus Frank Lamparelli.
SPEAKER_03: Come on, just tell me. No politics. I'll say you, from the beginning, Frank. Oh, if I win only one round, I will be the happiest guy. This is not what you believe in. Bullshit. You are not coming to Istanbul to lose, Frank. Come on. Tell us what you really feel. Go ahead, Michael. My honest prediction is I think I'm a 65-35 favorite.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, let's see if Frank is there. Frank is there, I agree with him. Frank says that he agrees with the prediction. I know that. I'm canceling the match. Canceling the match? Yeah, let me cancel the fight. Who do you want as a replacement, Michael? That's funny.
SPEAKER_02: But if I can defend this man, if I can break a spear in favor of Frank, he always says that he was going to lose. Even with Matt Mask, trust me, he was saying Matt Mask will break me. I just hope to not lose my arm. He's Frank. He's Frank. I will tell you something. It just means that he is also deceiving you. Okay, nothing else. Okay, let's go. David Samusha versus Nurdalet Aydarhan, Michael.
SPEAKER_00: How can anyone bet against David? Do you remember Aydar Khan? Do you remember Aydar Khan from the last match? Oh my God, yeah. That dude's amazing. But I mean, until someone beats Samusha, you got to go with Samusha, right? What do you think about just beating all the best guys in 85 Kido?
SPEAKER_03: Seven matches, seven wins, and now he's pulling the 80-kilowatt champion. And you know this guy, Aydar Khan, also beat Mindaugas, and he was the lightweight champion. But he cannot make the weight anymore, so we took the title away from him. So, yeah. Let's see.
SPEAKER_02: okay so you are saying that david is the favorite because he has been okay it has to be frank he was trying he was trying to write on his hand samusha and he's like he thinks
SPEAKER_01: Why did he want to write on his hand? Because he wants to joke. What? He wants to joke. He said at that weight, like Michael said, it's really difficult to beat Samusha.
SPEAKER_03: And if he gains 10, 15 kilos, it will be a problem for the others as well. I say that if he ever gains weight, it will be a bad day for a lot of people. Okay. And let's go. This one may be the opponent of Monster Michael Toth, the winner of this match. It is not 100%, but we will just talk and then we will decide.
SPEAKER_00: Georgi Stradkov versus Alex Kurdeca. Alex Kurdeca said that he would beat you for sure if you beat Georgi, while Georgi said that it's a close match, you and him. Right. Yeah, so I would love that future match if I'm successful against Frank and against Lars. I like the idea of being in the super heavyweights again. But...
SPEAKER_00: And this is, I did this prediction on my channel earlier today. I released it. It is, uh, Alex to me is literally a giant, you know, he's, he's a huge, massive individual who is really coming to his own, right? Like what he did against Morozov easily could have went either way, the right arm. You want to say with all the things and tools that Alex brings to the table that Alex is going to pull it off, but spec off is just
SPEAKER_00: very very tenacious and his pronation is ridiculous and his arm and hand are strong I think Alex is way more versatile but on my channel I predicted three to two you are you that's what I think so you are saying that he will be your opponent in Orlando
SPEAKER_00: Complete transparency, I think I would rather pull him than I would Alex. I mean, I like the stylistic matchup against me and Speckhoff more so than I do me and Alex. Now, if Alex wins and I am able to win my next two matches, then I will more than happily pull Alex. Yeah. So it's just...
SPEAKER_00: Like I said, the only thing I'm thinking about right now is that nice Italian fella right there. That nice Italian fella. That's who I got to get through. But, yeah, this is going to be a very exciting match. And two very, very large, very, very strong men. Okay. Connolly family. Can't wait to see the new version of the monster at the table. Let's go, Michael. 4-0.
SPEAKER_01: 4-0, he says, you are going to win. But it's his best of five, so the best he can do is 3-0, yeah. OK. Thank you for the support. Appreciate it. How do you see Frank, his match? I think Giorgi is much more resistant than I am currently, I think, of Kurdeca. But Kurdeca manages to change his shot, so I don't know.
SPEAKER_02: He's saying that when he pulled against Giorgi after that match in WAF, he was completely dead while Giorgi was still fresh and ended up winning many more. So he thinks that... Yeah, he won the gold. He won the gold, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: He thinks that Georgie will win thanks to endurance. Of course, Alex showed great adaptability and versatility on the table, changing not only topper, but also hook press. But he thinks that Georgie endurance will be the key for the win of this match. And yes, Georgie is the winner.
SPEAKER_03: So he says Georgi is going to win because he's in there. Yeah. Okay. Michael, I watched your prediction video, but I also still would like to ask you, Alijan versus Hermes. And can you tell us again? Sorry, but. Yeah. So the thing is, Alijan might be the best guy on the planet. He is unbelievable and all that. And that's what's crazy is he's unbelievable.
SPEAKER_00: but I still think somehow armies is going to win three to two. I just think he's going to, I think his post and his top rollers pronation is going to be like, I don't know. Like it could be three, two armies. It could be three, zero. I was, I don't, you know, it's just so hard to pick these matches when they're at that level. I was on what he did at Prudnik was something incredible.
SPEAKER_03: bizarre yeah yeah totally unexpected right totally oh my God I'm sitting there watching that as a commentator and I'm like what the hell is happening you know it was crazy yeah yeah yeah yeah and and Michael you said that three two Hermes do you think that Hermes has such endurance to win three two when he lost already two rounds to alijan so you you think that just he may be positioned and he may win right
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I mean, I think he'll be, you know, for him to win 3-2. Who knows? Maybe he wins 3-0. Like I said, I'm just throwing out random shit. I honestly don't know. But I think he, you know, I think it's going to be hard to hook him. And I think Alizon would spend a lot of energy trying to get the hook, even if he was able to stretch him out to pin him. I think Aramis would be able to find a way to bust that hand back. And he has the great transitional shoulder press. I mean, I don't know. I think Aramis is still, I think so. I think he's going to win.
SPEAKER_00: let's see have you seen him with left arm shoulder press no but i've seen a lot of people left-handed you know i just i feel like you could if you can do it one hand and you have like if it becomes a necessity to win the match you will find a way to do it the other hand you know something like i kind of think that i kind of think that people who has like risk dominant uh technique like ali john
SPEAKER_03: i'm not sure if they can resist once they lose their wrist because they're not so much used to uh pulling back i i what i just said if herman stop loss he may not even need that shoulder yeah yeah maybe i don't know we don't we will be and and frank alisa al momento potrebbe essere un figlio non riconosciuto da superman sinceramente per le doti che ha e
SPEAKER_01: However, as I said when the challenge came out, I said 50-50 because I saw how they both grew over the last three or four years. I don't know, I have to be honest, Tifo Hermes, even if I give a 50-50, I think Hermes could win, but it's hard to decide. On this one I stop at 50-50.
SPEAKER_02: he says that on this one he will stop at 50 50 because it's really hard to predict uh it's used for armors but he thinks that alizan is like the secret son of superman because the things that he's doing are like mind-blowing so he thinks that very hard to predict this match he sees the match going either way so it is one thing this is the other thing and he really yeah he really can't decide
SPEAKER_03: in which direction the match will go yeah yeah i i saw yesterday today hermes hermes said my left is in very good shape not like my right but much better than last time this is what he wrote to me now i'm reading he said that his left arm is in very very good shape all i can say that
SPEAKER_02: it will not be easy as Frank is saying that Hermes is he speaking about legs or arms?
SPEAKER_03: legs and arms yeah he likes to joke all the time yeah he said his left arm really he says that is i also uh alex kurdecha and him they train alex also told me that hermes's left arm they didn't say win lose or something only training but alex also said hermes's left arm is in uh very good shape all i can say that i don't think that alejan has ever pulled someone like hermes like that technical
SPEAKER_03: that that like that top role specialty you know i don't think that adrian has ever so let's see how it will be okay let's go to the main event michael the last one and we are finishing devon versus levan i i let you say whatever yeah man i i still i've said this i don't know how many times in the last ever since this match got announced um in my opinion lebanon has to beat him the way he beat him last time
SPEAKER_00: He has to beat Devin as convincingly as he did previously. If at any point the match stops and Devin gets that confidence that, hey, he's strong enough to be in the match, Devin's going to end up winning. So I think it's going to be 4-0 LeVon. But, I mean, the moment Devin wins one round, he wins everything after that. Hmm.
SPEAKER_03: So today I saw your video. You said Levan is going to win 4-0. You said because if one round Devon wins, then there will be no more for Levan in a win. It's what you said. I understand that, like that Levan has to win. But in your opinion, Levan is going to dominate him four times because you said 4-0. So, I mean, it means that you believe he's going to dominate him four times.
SPEAKER_00: that's what i think i mean i mean it's very difficult to i mean you can't discount devin devin is amazing what he's doing and what he's done the last two years has been nothing short of amazing but i just don't know i mean i think he's gonna go full-blown kings move round one like i think he'll go all the way did you have a chance to watch my today's video probably didn't see right
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, there I said Devon's career is like different before the pandemic and after the pandemic. I say like totally two different career. One is mostly limited to North America and the other one is just super level international. You know, he started to pull in Levan and then Prudnik and then Sandris and then Gennady and then Dave Chaffee is North American.
SPEAKER_03: Hermes, Denis Siplenko, and then Giorgi. Yeah, so what I'm just saying that in my opinion, the experience that Devon gained in last two years is at least, if not more than what he has experienced
SPEAKER_03: on the other 25 years or 30 years. I'm not saying that he wasn't experienced. He was experienced, but it's a different type of experience. These guys that we are mentioning now are all either world champions or whatever, incredible level guys. And this guy is pulling them one after another, one after another, one after another. So I'm just saying that he is right now. Do you believe that stem cell
SPEAKER_03: like i i have this kind of a theory like not theory but like when once you cannot use your supination you all the time use your pronation here is not only injured but it's also becoming weaker and weaker and weaker you know that this part bottom part of your hand is responsible to block the arm while this side is putting pressure to the hand of europe on the pronation side
SPEAKER_03: so right as you saw that i was very surprised i was in dubai when i saw devon against dave cheffy going directly to flop press like i don't remember them doing that kind of thing i mean right from the start i mean i don't remember even when he was young healthy this and that so what i'm just saying that he is now he can pull he's much more healthier than before so and then even
SPEAKER_03: Just say in a hormonal level, he is not stronger than before, but just because he is now able to use all the muscle groups that he hasn't been able to, he hadn't been able to use, I think that it makes you stronger because you are getting so much support from those injured areas because they are not injured anymore. I don't know how you see this. Do you think that Devon is different Devon than two years ago? Without a doubt.
SPEAKER_00: Without any doubt. I mean, I've had a lot of stem cells since my injury as well. And I think it has helped me out tremendously. But seeing what Devin's done to himself to change and have like, it's like he started over with a brand new healthy arm, you know, like everything about a healthy body, everything about him just seems like it's firing on all cylinders. I just think the probability that LaVon
SPEAKER_00: ready go can go straight to the pad is more likely than devin stopping him yeah okay yeah now i'm not saying i mean like i said i wouldn't be surprised if devin beats him hell devin might beat him four zero you know he might stop in the first round
SPEAKER_00: yeah it's all about can you stop or not anyone who has a different opinion than that is is not followed arm wrestling it's he stops him and it's not that he stops him because levon can arm wrestle levon's a very experienced arm wrestler yeah and i said this in my video there's still a part of devon right now that doesn't know if he's strong enough to stop the match he still doubts whether he can do it
SPEAKER_00: But the moment it happens, that lack of confidence turns into extreme confidence and belief that I'm the man. And I'm going about, I'm about to show the world. And if that happens, we're in for something special. I'm just telling you that I believe that with a whole heart, if, if he stops him and that switch happens at that moment, we're going to see something different coming out of Devon. Yeah. You know, Devon probably.
SPEAKER_03: better than 99.90% of the people out there, you know. You have pulled against him three super matches, am I correct? Yeah, we've had three right-handed super matches, but I've known him for a very long time, you know, so. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And, yeah, and Frank? All right.
SPEAKER_01: He is very strong, but he has a great gift. He manages to win a part of the match with his psychological terrorism, because he manages to devastate a person on a mental level with what he says on the table. And you've already seen this with Giorgi.
SPEAKER_01: and he saw himself with Hermes, because I think in those matches both Hermes and Giorgi had the chance to win or at least to bring home more matches, but it wasn't like that because he manages to devastate them with his way of doing things, of talking, of distracting, and this is a gift, something that he understood works with many opponents. I think this thing won't work with EVA, and EVA for me,
SPEAKER_01: So, Frank's saying that Devon has a very
SPEAKER_02: a very big ability of making people weaker let's say and going inside the head of his opponent and he thinks that both frank and georgie didn't perform as best as they could because devon is a master at mind games and like distracting them not letting them express themselves at their best but it is that this thing won't work on 11 and 11 is likely too strong for devil to win but
SPEAKER_03: Strangely enough, Frank said that he thinks that Levan will win, but not a clear sweep. So not as dominant as the first time? No, not the same way. Yeah, but that part is interesting. I will quickly say, because Michael says once the match stops, it's over. While you are saying maybe harder, when you say harder, what is harder? There is no stop? There is no stop?
SPEAKER_01: He learned from the last match he won with Hermes and I think he also trained the resistance. Yes, but you said Devon stops him. Everyone says that when Devon stops someone, he wins. In my opinion, I don't know if he'll be able to stop him. I don't think so. Then how can you say it's harder without a stop?
SPEAKER_02: Well, both of them are tired. There's nothing to do. So he's saying that Levan will get more tired, but he will have worked on his endurance after the Hermes match. But at the same time, he doesn't think that Devon is going to stop him, just that Levan will
SPEAKER_02: will feel him way more than the last time and that levan will win without a stop but it will be way harder for him like let's say that last time he flashed him like like this and this time he will still win but like he will feel that way yeah yeah and and michael this is not like uh the the auto strap the they will start without the strap do you think there is a possibility levan to win without letting them go to strap
SPEAKER_00: Yes. So I'm going to go ahead and elaborate on my stock prediction. Devin stops the match with any type of crack in LeBron's wrist. If he stops the match and LeBron has control, LeBron can beat him. If the match stops and LeBron has control, I don't think that Devin wins from there.
SPEAKER_00: If Devin cracks LeBron's wrist, if LeBron hits full side pressure and his wrist goes back a little bit and Devin's full-blown kings or whatever it takes, if that wrist gets compromised, that's when I believe Devin can win. If the match stops and LeBron has control and Devin just stops the match, I don't think Devin wins from there. I think Devin has to have a chink in the armor. He has to crack the wrist, in my opinion. You are saying that it has to be on the outside, right?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I don't think he goes towards him. And he's saying, I mean, some people are saying he's going to try to go towards him. I think that's the worst mistake you could possibly do. I mean, I don't know. Maybe Devin can do it, but that's not what I think is going to happen. Franks as well says that there are different types of stops. And like Michael said, there is one type of stop like this and one like stopping someone like this. So to stop and win, he needs to write really a good stop, not like just a random stop like this.
SPEAKER_03: Michael, just say that Lewand went outside and do you remember the way that Georgie put Lewand? Like the position that Lewand lost a little bit wrist, but he had the pronator. So he stopped him like this. What if they both don't have the wrist and they both go like, and Lewand's wrist is like this bent, but he has the pronator.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, so here's the deal. This is my belief. Certain people who arm wrestle can arm wrestle without their hand and wrist. They still have their pronation engaged. Devin Larry, Todd Hutchins, myself. Dominant arm wrestlers such as LeVon and some of the other greats that we've seen, the moment they lose what they need to win and it goes back, they're not as confident.
SPEAKER_00: where people like myself and Todd and Devin, we have supreme confidence because we've been there a million times, right? Probably not a million times, but we've been there a bunch of times. So if the matches go there, you have one guy who is very uncomfortable in that position because he's not used to arm wrestling there, and you have someone who's extremely comfortable there because he's very used to arm wrestling there. So if the match ends up like that, I 100% think Devin's going to win. Okay, so what you are saying that...
SPEAKER_03: as long as devon maintains his pronator where the stop happens then then that that is possibly is going to win you're saying i think if levon's wrist gets opened at all if his wrist his knuckles go back past his wrist
SPEAKER_00: That is the moment. Devon's wrist doesn't matter. Devon's wrist doesn't matter. As long as Devon's wrist is bent, you are saying that Devon's going to win. That's what I believe. I mean, I've always believed if I was strong enough, like if I had the power to stop the match for Devon and I stopped him that way, I think the same thing would happen to me. There would be this crazy switch that I'd be willing to break everything I have to win that match, and I think Devon's going to be in the same place. You know, because you're going against the strongest hand I believe we've ever seen in the sport. I think Devon has the strongest hand we've ever seen.
SPEAKER_00: So to win the match, you have to beat the strongest hand that's ever been here. So the moment you see that risk go back, your confidence is like, I'm in this shit. Like, and I think that's, if that happens, that's where we see an entirely different Devon Laird than we've ever seen before. Yeah. Yeah. I understand.
SPEAKER_03: I don't know. We will see. We will see. It will be like you said, it's going to be a 4-0. And it means that in all four rounds, you believe that Lewand to finish the match, round one, round two, round three, round four, is more than 50%. That's why you are saying that. But the question is,
SPEAKER_03: what is devon's chance to stop the match it is less than 50 because you said that it's gonna 4-0 i think he's got a 35 chance of stopping the match which is significant that's significant i mean yeah that's a huge i mean what we're saying here is at best at best lavon's a two to one favorite miles okay okay so basically his chance is more than last time
SPEAKER_00: Devin's? Without a doubt. I got like a 2% chance last time. I don't remember. I probably did a prediction video. I have no idea what I said last time. But in my opinion, the Devin that exists today, this is far better than the Devin that faced LeVon last time.
SPEAKER_00: And do you think that this is also the best Devon ever? Without a doubt. I mean, I can't even see a close comparison, right? Like maybe the previous guy he was just when he poured Yogi or Dennis or whatever. But he's known this match was coming. He's had time to prepare for this match. He's given up everything. Like when Devon prepares for a match like this, he goes to a different place. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, and everything he's done leading up to this was to prepare for this comeback. After he lost to LeVon, it was either go down to heavyweight and stay there, go down to light heavyweight, or chase the supers. And he's done everything he could to get back to this match. So every match he's had has been a learning experience and a process to get back to this match. So, I mean, we're going to find it out. Yeah, go ahead. Now, can that mountain be toppled? I mean, can Devin sit atop?
SPEAKER_00: You know, that Everest, can he be the very best at this sport? And if he can, it'll be spectacular. And even to that point, it's not like, well, how long can you stay there? Who cares? If he does this, and this is, I'm going to say some dumb shit right here, because John Brzezink is the greatest arm wrestler of all time. Yeah. There's no argument. He's the greatest arm wrestler of all time. His career is insane. Yeah. If Devin does this, in my opinion, he can be the second.
SPEAKER_00: Well, I think he's the second already because of what he's done in this comeback. I think these last two or three years had solidified him as the second best because he's done things that even you and I both thought he couldn't do. Like, we had no idea he was going to do that to Hermes. You know, like, no idea that was going to happen, right? But if he can come back and beat LeVon, it will be the greatest single victory ever.
SPEAKER_03: In the history of our sport, in my opinion. Yeah. You're not saying anything about the goal, but the one thing that is the hardest thing that has ever been done. I agree with that. I agree. Yeah. Yeah. And, okay, John Lewis, will Michael Todd face winner of Devon versus Levon? Not yet, my friends. Not yet. Michael needs to do a good cleaning up there to get that shot. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: I'm going to prove that I deserve that shot, right? Like I said, I've got some very formidable people in front of me right now, so I'm not looking past Frank at all. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And also, you are very thirsty to win at East versus West. Oh my God, I haven't won yet. That's crazy. There's never been a league I haven't won at. Like, what is this craziness, you know? I got at least a good damn victory. All were very tough, tough matches, you know, very tough. You choose very hard matches.
SPEAKER_03: Anyway, so Frank, is there anything you want to add? Sorry, Frank. I asked about this match more to Michael because Michael is like probably someone that knows Devon better than anyone else. But is there anything you would like to add, my friend?
SPEAKER_01: So he's saying that
SPEAKER_02: Devon won everything last year and it has become pretty boring. So he really hopes for Levan to win because like, come on, we need some change. And that if Devon wins, he will quit the sport because he has won everything. So he will lose. No, no. There is somebody that often says, no, there is somebody often says, oh, Panna. You remember that one? Yeah. Panna.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah. Not everything. There is another thing that he needs to take care of. At least Devon, once he wins, doesn't do like Michael Jordan. He wins against Levan and then goes like Michael Jordan did in baseball. Baseball? Basketball? No, no. Michael Jordan was in basketball and at one time he switched to baseball. Oh, okay. So you win, you become like the greatest and then you change sports because it's boring.
SPEAKER_03: Does he think that if Devon wins it, he will be greatest? He said that John is like number one, but he agrees that it will be like the greatest victory of the sport. In the single. Yeah, I agree that 100%. Michael said Michael gave a great title. I think the best title.
SPEAKER_03: third you know about this match it will be the greatest victory single victory that ever happened i agree with it i agree anyways michael thank you very much my friend you would like to say anything to before we finish or to the fans or anything whatever you know yeah yeah man i really appreciate all the support i've gotten uh
SPEAKER_00: through my recovery with everything I've dealt with this past year. So it really means a lot to have this type of support and encouraging words people sent me. I'm excited that I get to face Frank. So it's been, you know, it's been 15 and a half years since we arm wrestled each other. So I think we're gonna have a great match. Safe travels, everyone. And I guess I will see you guys in a couple of weeks. Yeah, it will be great to see you, Michael. And Frank, do you want to say anything finishing? I'm very happy
SPEAKER_01: That there is this challenge with Michael, because I have always valued him as a person, as an athlete. Also because he too, like me, is one who gives an easy smile, who is less noticeable with the beard, but he still laughs as often as I laugh. So he's a sunny person and I've always liked him. So, nothing, I'll do my best for everything. Everything that has to do with sport and life.
SPEAKER_02: good everything to michael in every in every aspect of his life in the sport aspect in personal life good luck to everything and he really is really grateful
SPEAKER_02: for this opportunity because he likes Michael as an athlete but also as a person and he said that Michael smiles a lot like him but due to the bird the beard is not always visible so he likes Michael because he smiled just as him and he's like a cheerful person so he's really looking forward to his match and to face Michael once again
SPEAKER_01: And another thing, I know he cares a lot about his beard, but if he wins, he has to cut his beard. If he wins, he has to cut his beard. Frank said that he knows that you really care about your beard, but if you win, you need to cut the beard. Yeah, Rebecca's saying no to that already. He won't let me, so I can never put the beard up.
SPEAKER_03: Guys, thank you very much. And everybody, there is only 18 days to the greatest armwrestling event in the history and the greatest match by far, the biggest match by far. Levan Skaginasvili versus Devon Larratt, as Michael described, you know, if Devon wins
SPEAKER_03: single victory ever and we will see just keep following us and you all take care yourself Michael thank you very much my friend Frank thank you very much my friend Martino thank you for the translation my friend and you all take care see you in two weeks take care bye
