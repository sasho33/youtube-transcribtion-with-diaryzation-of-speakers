SPEAKER_01: Hello, everyone. Hello, guys. Hello, hello, hello. Yeah, this is Chance Shoals.
SPEAKER_02: You sure? Yeah. Sorry, guys. It's time for the glasses.
SPEAKER_01: Hey, Dan, how are you, my friend? Hello, guys. Hello. Hello, everyone.
SPEAKER_01: I really need glasses. I just won my first local junior tournament. Thank you for being. Okay, Chance, notice came. Thank you for being the legend that inspired me. Congratulations, Thomas. Look at that. You have the East versus us. I have the Florida. That's good. That's good. How are you, Chance? I'm doing good. How are you, Engin?
SPEAKER_01: Good, good, good. I'm fine. Thank you. Thank you. I'm ready to announce the card. And so after that, we can also announce, tell people, you know, what we are planning to do, things like that, if it's okay for you. Okay. Yeah, perfect. Okay, guys. So everyone is ready. Let's see how many people are.
SPEAKER_01: Online, is it 130 or 400? 430. Yeah, either, but yeah. Yeah. Okay, guys. So, we have Devon Larratt versus Levan Saginashvili, as you know. This we announced. The half of the matches we announced already. And the other half. And Hermes Gasparini versus Ali Can Muradov.
SPEAKER_01: uh todd and olives olex love child thank you greatest promotion greatest pronation we love you i love you guys as well thank you for your super chat and we have alex kurdecha versus georgie swedco um right arm right arm and dizzy does
SPEAKER_01: That's a good match. Yeah, hope you are in good health, Mr. Terzi, your legend. Thank you for everything you do for the arm wrestling community, true legend. I thank you very much, my friend. I do all this by your support, and you know this. That's a good match, right? Remember, one time, Georgi was saying that he has never been top role, and then Devon put this video when Alex Kurdeco was kind of taken outside, you know, at the Zlotys tour.
SPEAKER_01: let's see how it will be i think it's just a little bit personal maybe not i don't know from the georgia side you know what do you think i think it's a really interesting match i'm excited to see alex uh you know finally on these versus west stage like his match with morozov was amazing left-handed and now we get to see him right-handed i kind of think that like especially with the right-hand perspective you know with left-arm you saw he has hook and this and that with right arm i don't remember him being that
SPEAKER_01: Powerful with the horsepower like shoulder pressure. I don't remember personally. I see I remember a pure top roller and then Georg is also pure top roller these guys Don't have like that incredible side pressure, but they have incredible back pressure and pronator and hand control So yeah, see how it will end up. Yeah. Yeah, it's gonna be really interesting. I think that's a great match Yeah, and then we have as you guys know Michael Todd
SPEAKER_01: Okay, let's talk one by one. Ermes Alijan, how do you see this one? Ermes says that there's no way he's going to lose to a 105-kilo guy. I don't know how many people on the planet can stop Olazon. He's incredible. I think Ermes is in trouble.
SPEAKER_01: Hermes isn't terrible. But do you think the beat in Ali Can is like power, of course, but something that his opponent also needs to be a great arm-master, smart, fast, technical, to hit the key points. You know, to overpower Ali Can is just like you need to be really like big, super heavyweight, something like Levan or something. But other than that, I think that it is mostly like it's some technical...
SPEAKER_01: necessity and and i think hermes is one of them and another thing advantage the hermes is hermes is getting ready for dennis blanco yeah so he will be in a i mean incredible shape and that alijan is on his way to dennis you know so so you don't think you don't think alijan uh hermes's chance huh uh i i mean did army start training his left arm more since he faced morsoff
SPEAKER_01: I mean, like, he has been training right now, yeah, like crazy. He doesn't, I mean, listen, people like Hermes, I mean, they don't like to lose, you understand? They don't, not because it's only right-arm, left-arm thing, but especially against someone who is 25 kilo lighter. Let's see, but you are saying that Ali Can is going to win? I think he's the favorite, maybe 60-40, maybe 60-40.
SPEAKER_01: But you never know. Like you said, someone like Hermes doesn't like to lose. And if Hermes' left is here and his right is here and his left is catching up, then it could be scary for anyone. Okay. I'm going to say that Devon versus Levan is the last one. By the way, how long time do you have? Do you have an hour or less? Like an hour is fine. Okay. And Michael Todd versus Frank Lamparelli. Frank has beaten Matt Mask. And we know that Matt Mask is in incredible shape.
SPEAKER_01: And now Michael is coming back. How did you see Michael against Pavlo? I saw Michael against Pavlo. I think it was satisfying when we still have two more months. I mean, it's not a regular two more months. When you are coming back, every day you are getting better. But how do you see this match? I thought Michael looked really, really in really, really good shape. Pavlo is incredible. He's very strong. He was huge. 278.
SPEAKER_00: yeah but still i saw michael a little bit here a little bit problem yeah yeah a little bit yeah and and michael said uh him and pablo worked on some some training so he's going to be working his cup for the next two months we'll see i i really like that match it's interesting it's hard to say who who will win since it's michael's you know big comeback match pablo was like for him um but when was when was it was like uh 2012 or something they had a really good match okay
SPEAKER_00: 16 years ago. Yeah, so it's, you know, it's a rematch, but you can't really read too much into that. But the style should be the same. Just like when Michael had his match with Hermes. Like the style sometimes gives Michael some trouble. Yeah, Michael at that time was doing like more like this kind of arm wrestling. Now he's more like this kind of arm wrestling. But yeah, we will see. And then the next one we also know. And I like talking arm wrestling with you because you are a new generation of
SPEAKER_01: uh armwrestler and you know everyone and you are a fan of armwrestling a lot of people they don't know like west doesn't know east usually he doesn't know i mean after east versus west they get to know each other a lot but still not enough right and david samusha versus nur dalet that that that's that's a really good match um
SPEAKER_00: Nerdlat, his hit is just so nasty. But David Samusha, we don't see him lose at 85 kilos. So for me, I have to beat Samusha every single time at 85 kilos until he proves me wrong. He's incredible. What is he, seven times?
SPEAKER_01: champion seven times already seven this will be the eighth time i need to make sure that this guy doesn't win ten times yeah he might might have to make him go up a class he's too strong for 85 kilos yeah we will see we will see yeah i don't know i don't know i i don't accept that statement we will see yeah is coming up from 75 right
SPEAKER_00: No, I mean, last world he won 80. In Kazakhstan he won 80, yeah. Yeah, yeah. So, I mean, it's always interesting when you see people change weight classes. Sometimes they are really successful and sometimes they're not. But someone like Nerdlet, I think he's going to be really successful and he should give Sumusha a lot of problems. Yeah. People are asking what are the matches so far. Some of them are the same ones that you heard already.
SPEAKER_01: Devon Larratt, Levan, Hermes, Ali Can, and Michael, Frank, Lamparelli, Samusha, Aydarhan. And the only one that we didn't announce before and I'm announcing now is Alex Kurdeca versus Georgi Svetkov. This is the match, yeah. And okay, the next one is Skullboy versus Leonidas. Ah, interesting. Yeah, you know that they both beat Larry.
SPEAKER_01: Right, they both beat Larry Wills. Larry, yeah, they both beat him, yeah. But I think Leonidas beat a better version of Larry. I think Schoolboy also beat him good, but I mean, it was a little bit...
SPEAKER_01: He was still not arm wrestling good, but after he went to the US, I see Larry looks like almost pinned or pinned, you know, Sandris, you know, I don't know what was happening there. I saw him training with John Berzink. I heard that in training, he beat Derek Smith sometimes, you know. So now what do you think about this match?
SPEAKER_00: I think on paper Schoolboy is probably the favorite still. Because he's a better armwrestler in technical perspective, yeah? Yeah, technically he's a much better armwrestler. Leonidas actually came to Florida and competed not too long ago, in November. So I got to see him a little bit. I think the thing that might be good for Leonidas is he has a really sticky open bicep move. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know if Skuboy can transition from outside into the press strong enough to beat Leonidas. So I think Skuboy will win center table. But from there, it's hard to say. That's a really interesting match. I like that match a lot. Okay. So another one. Mindagas Tarasaitis versus Artur Makarov. Who is winning this one, Chance? We already announced this one. I mean...
SPEAKER_00: I didn't think Mindaugas had a chance to beat Daniel Prokopchik in the last event. And the first two rounds, I was like, oh, yeah, this is too easy for Daniel. And Mindaugas was able to adjust out of it. And that was an incredible match, probably my favorite match on the last card. But I think Arthur Makarov is maybe even a step up from Daniel Prokopchik. So...
SPEAKER_01: I would take Makarov with a slight edge, but that's going to be an incredible match. That 75 kilo class always has incredible matches. Yeah, yeah. I wish Alan Zola could also join. That would make everything perfect. Yeah, yeah. I don't know when he can get out of Russia. I know that he cannot get right now.
SPEAKER_01: But I offer him, he said he would be honored and he's going to let me know whenever he can get out of his country. But let's see how it will be. So you are saying that Arthur has more chance, huh? I believe so. Do you think that if Arthur wins, that will automatically mean that Alain Zolev is the best 75 kilo in the world?
SPEAKER_01: All style mixed matches or things like this? Yeah, I would still like to see, I would say Alan, like on paper, would be the number one in the world, but I would still like to see him at East versus West and the Supermatch format. Supermatch format, so okay, I understand, yeah. Yeah. Okay, let's go. Fiyar Isaac, Ekaterina Nikishova. Ooh. That's... This is left arm match.
SPEAKER_01: Left arm? Yep. When did Ekaterina pull left arm last? Was it last year? No, no, no. The Russians have not been competing for a while now. Does she compete in the AMC, or is there not a woman? No, there is no woman in the AMC. But, I mean, I always believe one thing, that whenever, like when Cherry was away for like three years,
SPEAKER_01: Whenever I invited, it was a direct title match. They were like, oh, what are you doing this and that? He just came and beat Gennady. I remember. And Ongarve was away for three years. He just came, beat John, and then beat Michael Todd and Irakli, you know? So, I mean, if you know, like, what it takes to be in good shape, and if you know how to train and everything, I think this is, you really...
SPEAKER_01: don't need to be like i don't think that i really really train you know i can say like since arthur macaro injury um but i think if i get in good shape i can if i know what it takes to be there you know i think i can come and do something good you know that's what i yeah absolutely i was just trying to remember the last time i saw her compete i i felt like it had been a couple years uh not that she's in great shape like you said when you're at that level you know what
SPEAKER_00: When you've been there, you know what you need to do to get there. It's really interesting. Left arm, I think even with the time off, I would favor Ekaterina over Fia on the left. Maybe Fia by 45. Okay, we have Irakli Zrakashvili Oleg Petrenko. Ooh, 105 kilos.
SPEAKER_01: Because I think Sasho is going to pull Irakli in July. But now Irakli in 95 kilos, he beat Paulin, he beat Rustam Bavev. And so Irakli at 105 against Petrenko.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, that's really interesting. Obviously, I pulled Petrenko at East vs. West 8 in the shirt that I'm wearing now, and he beat me 3-0. So I know how powerful he is. He looked incredible against Marcio. I thought Marcio was going to give him more trouble than he did. It seems like Petrenko each time is getting a little bit better each match. He looks a lot better now than when he faced John Brzezink back in, what was that, East vs. West 5 maybe? Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_00: yeah petrenko incredible iraqli has been looking amazing as well uh iraqli just beat russababaev um not too long ago and then pauline pauline yeah yeah he beat pauline yeah in 95 kilo he looked um more effective yeah pretty unstoppable uh who was it uh uh david that that beat him um
SPEAKER_01: I don't know. This match is going to kind of prove where Petrenko is going. If Petrenko passes Irakli, it means that Petrenko is ready for a title shot. I agree. I agree. Yeah, yeah. But if Petrenko cannot pass Irakli, he may not be ready for David. Yeah, yeah. Is Irakli ranked 2 then in 105? Yeah, he's ranked in 105, yeah. And so who do you think is winning here?
SPEAKER_01: uh for me it's 50 50. maybe iraqli 55 percent let's see yeah okay we have do you know who petro margarine is i'm sorry petro margarine do you remember the moldova event big moldova event yeah
SPEAKER_01: In that event, Petro Margarine, if I'm not mistaken, he beat Sandris, he beat Revas, he beat John Burzink. He kind of, he hooked Revas without strap. Wow. And he is like 100, 105 kilo guy. Wow, okay. And yeah, and then same Revas only two months ago gave hell to Levan.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah. At the Waffles. Like, they had a long, long, long, long match. And Petro Margarine beat him. Petro Margarine is, like, almost un-top-rollable. You know, the hand. I mean, just think about who can reverse without strap. It's just not like everyone can do, especially a light, heavyweight guy. Right. So he's going to pull. And do you know Nugo? I don't. He is from Georgia. He won the last Europeans. He top-rolled.
SPEAKER_01: Krasimir, he took his wrist. Wow. Yeah. Nugo, yeah, Nugo took Krasimir's wrist and he beat him. He beat him twice. Is Petro Bulgarian? No, Petro Bulgarian is from Ukraine. Ukraine. So it's, okay, Ukraine and Georgia. Yeah, Ukraine and Georgia, yeah. And yeah, Shkodze, yeah, Lagie, you're right. Yeah, that guy, that guy is very, very strong. Like,
SPEAKER_01: Like Nugo is very, very hard to be hooked. You know, like to hook him is very hard. He's incredibly effective against the hookers. While it is near impossible to top roll Petro Margarine in his category. Imagine that Krasimir hooked John. John's pronator is not bad. He hooked John without strap while he couldn't hook Nugo.
SPEAKER_01: With crap. With crap. I mean, if you want, I can send you, I mean, show you right now the match over here. Yeah. Quickly. Lugo is just really very interesting guy, you know. See, he is here. He put the video when Krasimir is beating John because he made it.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, and now he's going to put his own look at him versus Krasimir. He took his wrist. You never see Krasimir with his wrist like that. Yeah, I mean, I saw Kurdesha did it, but yeah. So I'm very, very curious about, I don't know how this...
SPEAKER_01: match will go yeah yeah anyways so what do you think it's it's interesting uh i mean i don't know too much about them so it's hard to say it would just be a guess but uh he's also world champion the margarine like 2021 he beat easily reno but reno was very young then and reno took second place and
SPEAKER_00: Being a top roller, I'm always going to pick the top roller to beat the hook puller. So I guess in this case, I would be taking Nug over Petro. But it's just a guess. Okay, the next one. Sandri Sedic versus Ibrahim Sago, the AMC 105kg champion, I think four times, I believe.
SPEAKER_01: And Ibrahim pulled Todd Hutchings, and it was a good match, right? Yeah, yeah. It was a long match. They had, like, a battle, you know, yeah. And, yeah. 105 kilo, Sandris and Ibrahim. What do you think? Sandris is going down to 105? Sandris said that he's already, like, 107 or 108 or something. He wants to pull 105, yeah. Okay, okay. Because before he competed 115, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Hmm, hmm.
SPEAKER_00: It's a tough match. I think Sandras is probably, from what I've seen at least, technically better. How do you say the other guy's name? Ibrahim? Ibrahim. Ibrahim is the name of, how do you say in the United States, Abraham.
SPEAKER_00: Abraham is over here, Ibrahim, Ibrahim, you know, same. Yeah, I think Ibrahim is much stronger. I don't see Sanders being able to give Todd Hutchings as much trouble as Ibrahim gave him.
SPEAKER_00: uh i i never want to count sanders out because you know he he's very efficient at pulling everywhere top roll hook press uh he's fast uh he's smart but i i would take ibrahim just because of pure pure power i understand and this is now the next one is very very interesting one and then i will uh announce the arsene lilliev's opponent um this one is do you know talgat active
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, super fast. Yeah, the fastest. Do you remember Badkili Oniani? Yeah, of course. Badkili Oniani is many times world champion, super left arm. He gave hell to Oleg Zok, but he couldn't win. Yeah, it was a match at East First West 2. Yeah, yeah, you were in the same event. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And they are going to pull against each other. Super match. Incredible match. 95 kilo. And Aktaev, better flash. If the match stops, it's going to be a long day for both of them. Yeah. A long one, yeah. And I have seen them pulling against each other many years ago. Betkeli won after a long match. Yeah. Yeah, that's a really good match. I think it has a chance to be match of the night.
SPEAKER_00: If it stops, because I also think that there's a chance that Talgett is just too fast, but Kili doesn't have the chance to stop it, it's a quick match. But if it stops, it's going to be a war. Yeah, there is a big possibility that the match may stop, you know. I can see 55% the match, but Kili will stop, but for sure...
SPEAKER_01: my opinion bet killy will stop him like in somewhere like losing way you know not not not right here you know i don't think so but we will see who knows you know yeah but kelly has such amazing shoulder commitment to dig out of a losing position yeah yeah his positioning is crazy
SPEAKER_01: Yeah. And now, now we have Arsene Lille. As you know, we tried to set Arsene Lille against Brad and Brad Grandi had a match with Paulo. And then I was waiting this match to see the result and to make a decision. And then Brad told me that he has like studies and he's like,
SPEAKER_01: I mean, he cannot really go for many days and come back. He said, maybe can we do later? And I said, okay. So I was thinking, you know, people may expect Arsene to pull like someone like really top level, but just imagine that this guy is near 40 years old and 11 years, he didn't do anything. And then he just came to the Denis Diplenko match as a guest. He watched.
SPEAKER_01: He got inspired and now he started to train. So about like three or four months maximum, he has been trained after 11 years. So we cannot really give him like a rank guy, you understand, in his category. So what I did, I asked to Brandon's assessor and he accepted the match. He said he can be 235 pounds and he said he's in very good shape. And these guys will pull. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: and so let's see how the match will go you know yeah yeah like incredible shape he's really big and strong right now have you seen videos uh yeah he's big and then he will be even probably bigger yeah yeah yeah and i think i i don't think it's uh i mean walking in park for arson i sent him the video and he accepted you know he accepted
SPEAKER_01: Probably whenever he sees him, he will be a little bit intimidated. Because I saw him live when he was under 190. So now when he's 235, I just can't imagine how he looks. Yeah, yeah. And the thing is, at 235 pounds for Brandon, it's like a normal person weighing like 270 pounds.
SPEAKER_01: Because Brandon's legs are like this big. He trains upper body only. He's just so much bigger than he should be. That could be really interesting. What's Arsene's weight at? Arsene is about 240, but he's just fat. He's not fat, fat, fat, but he has extra weight. I think he would be 210 pounds or something.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, three or four months. Josh Rowe. Josh Rowe. Engin, are you involved with matchmaking at King of the Table? No, my friend. King of the Table is its own. But next card for the June event I saw for the King of the Table is mind-blowing. Yeah. Anyway, so one more time, I will just read these matches. April 20th, East versus West, 12th.
SPEAKER_01: Devon Larratt, Levon Saginashvili, Hermes Gasparini, Alijan Muradov, Alex Kurdeljsa, Georgi Svetkov, Michael Todd, Frank Lamparelli, David Samusha, Nurdalet Aydarhan, Schoolboy versus Leonidas Arconas, Mindaugas Tarasaitis versus Artur Makarov, Fia Raisek, Ekaterina Nikiseva,
SPEAKER_01: Irakli Zrakashvili, Oleg Petrenko, Petro Margarin versus Nugo, Sandris versus Ibrahim Sago, Sandris Sedis, Talgat Akteyev versus Betkili Oniyani, and Arsene Liliyev versus Brandon Elsassor. Okay, so what do you think about it? About the card? Yeah. I think the card is amazing. There's a lot of matches I think are really, really close here.
SPEAKER_01: lot of matches that i've that i want to see uh that i'm excited about that i would buy a pay-per-view just for one of these matches and that's not even including devin and levon uh yeah but by the way people are asking this is 1999. 19.99 yeah there is not no difference here yeah um so yeah i like i i would be like feeling like i'm disrespecting
SPEAKER_01: any match that I'm putting to the number one because I don't think that like any of them is a starter match you know they all are like really high level matches you know yeah we just try to put Margarine versus Nugo one is European champion other one is world champion yeah Ekaterina Nikishova Fia they both have like multiple times like world titles you know they won
SPEAKER_01: Talgat Akte, world champion. Betkili Oniyani is world champion. Arsen Liliyev is legend. Which match are you going to put first? Irakli vs Petrenko? Which one is the starter match? All amazing matches. All amazing matches. Yeah, I agree. Okay guys, let's talk about a little bit the future plans.
SPEAKER_01: Should we start with your own events, Chance? Would you like to talk about it or later you want to do it yourself? No, yeah, sure, we can. Yeah, okay, just tell us what you are going to do and what is the... Maybe it's better if you can describe it, so I don't... Okay, okay, so what happens is that Chance's show is...
SPEAKER_01: planning to start he is going to start um if i say anything wrong just correct me chance um his own super match events pay-per-view high-level matches and and then we are going to be working with chance uh as east versus west so chance will actually be organizing
SPEAKER_01: North American not the North American East versus West that I'm gonna organize but he wants to do regular events on pay-per-view and He will still have some guests from the Europe and but he will be hosting the top
SPEAKER_01: uh american guys in super matches over there and how you know i don't know if it is correct to say but how you have the ufc and then ufc fight nights am i correct fight nights
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, so Shane's event will be like fight nights, but probably higher level. Not really fight nights, but maybe not the East versus West level, but he will have very high level super matches. And then I plan to, let's go after this one, if you want to say anything.
SPEAKER_00: No, yeah, no, you hit it on the head. I'm excited to set a lot of West versus West matches. Everything that I do is going to be purely East versus West format. East versus West rules, East versus West weight classes, East versus West, you know, the pads being one centimeter bigger. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_00: referees, everything, you know, the same level as far as that's concerned with East versus West, but mostly West versus West matches and maybe, you know, like Ingen said, a few guys from Europe, maybe some guys from Asia. So basically, basically every match that you will organize will also have effect on the rankings if those are
SPEAKER_01: pulling with the ranked guys. Whatever you said there, it will be officially accepted as an East vs. West supermatch. Maybe the level will not be the same, but all those matches will be East vs. West matches. So, yeah. So, it is, I mean, and then, like, I also have East vs. West North American event, and I decided that I work with Chance Cho,
SPEAKER_01: And the East versus West event that we have been talking, you guys have been asking to be organized in North America will be in Orlando, Florida. Am I correct? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. My pronunciation, everything. Yeah. And so we were just thinking in August, so it would be good.
SPEAKER_01: if the people would also travel with their families, maybe they take them to Disney or something. And then they said that, I'm informed that it is easy to fly to Florida. The people says a lot of places from North America to Orlando is like $100 per person to fly there. And so I think that it will be a great event. Chance already have the venue. We already made the plans. And most likely, most likely it will be
SPEAKER_01: different than Core Sports Paper. It is an extra event, East versus West, North America event. And so these are the news. And we plan to change. We need to make a dream team. Like Devon Larratt, Matt Mask, Todd Hutchings, John Brzezink, you know, Dave Chaffee, Michael Todd, Paul Wien. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it will be incredible. Like, one of the guys that I will for sure invite is Jonathan Breda. Yeah. Today I almost had him against Aymeric, Aymeric Breda. And Aymeric is competing on the same day to, on WAF Wars. Same week, you know, a week later or something, yeah. So it will be incredible. So, and then when are you going to, when are you going to...
SPEAKER_00: uh announce your cards it's gonna be in june yeah yes the date is gonna be june 15th that's that's uh i'm still talking to some athletes to try to make sure they're available for the day and a little bit about certain matches but uh hopefully i can announce a card within the next two weeks
SPEAKER_01: You know, I also have some other plans. There may be a match East versus East in the August card as well. But we are right now working on Visa. So we talked the Visa thing, you know, I'm not going to announce it. But I think great days are waiting for the North American fans. They have been asking this. They have been like, you know, you need here, you know, more excitement, more fans, you know, everything, you know.
SPEAKER_01: Of course, we will be also getting support from Pauline as well, my friend, who is also with James Reed together, coordinating all the East versus West qualifications. And everything will continue as it is, but this time we will also have these super matches. And I think that Chance, the reason that I would like to work with Chance is that Chance is very passionate.
SPEAKER_01: And Chance, I trust Chance and not that I don't trust anyone else, but I also trust Chance. I work with him, you know, three times. He was my guest over here. Chance is very knowledgeable. Four times, right? Yeah. See, what a terrible organizer. Don't remember all the numbers. Yeah. And so Chance is like very knowledgeable. Like whenever I talk about, I'm messing with Chance, like he knows east, west, everything and representing the new generation and
SPEAKER_01: And so smart and I believe that this is the right person and then we will start doing it. And then who knows, you know, maybe there will be different parts of North America as well, you know, with time, you know, we don't know how often we will be doing this, but this is a start, you know.
SPEAKER_00: I'm really excited to have the opportunity to work with you and finally bring East vs. West to North America. I think it's going to be amazing. I hope that all the fans that have been asking for it, I hope they show up and support. And we have a room, a stadium just filled with thousands of fans. That's my dream one day. I mean, the truth is that North American fans deserve this. They have been supporting what we are doing.
SPEAKER_01: And I always say that North America is not the motherland of arm wrestling because arm wrestling started long time before even America was discovered. But North America is the motherland of the modern arm wrestling. That is how people learn all those terms, the top roll, hook and everything.
SPEAKER_01: That is how we learned armwrestling from John Bersink, from Rumpet, from Cleve Dean, Johnny Walker, Dave Patton, Cobra Rose, and all those guys. The whole world, in fact, learned how to armwrestle from these people. And that is why when you talk about the history of armwrestling, modern armwrestling, all the names that you mentioned are like 90% of them are
SPEAKER_01: North Americans, like Gary Goodrich and other guys. So what I'm just saying that this event right now is one of the top events and North America deserves to host this event. This is my personal opinion. And all the time North America is sending team to this side of the world. So let them
SPEAKER_01: sit and then let the east come this time yeah yeah but we need to make a dream team like we need to really make a great team absolutely yeah yeah yeah yeah so anyways so it will be great and we now have east versus west uh 12 and i believe it will be an incredible
SPEAKER_01: event and um vip offer spots almost sold out you know a few more and then we will be closing it and we are selling the tickets already uh for the seats first time we are selling online tickets and yeah let's see how it will be chance yeah yeah
SPEAKER_01: I'm excited. April 20th is going to be killer. Yeah, it will be. And yeah, we were going to talk about the last one, Devon Larratt versus Levon Saginashvili. What do you think? There is one super shit, let me read before he goes away. Kevin Tomkey, thank you for your super shit. Is it possible for a blind person to be a world champion? Is arm wrestling the only sport in the world?
SPEAKER_01: where this is actually possible. My friend, yeah, I mean, the truth is I don't remember exactly a blind person competing in the senior division. Even if they did, I don't remember anyone being champion over there. But there is at the WAF, there is a competition for those people with vision problem. There is also for the people who has hearing problem,
SPEAKER_01: But physically, there are many of them. But arm wrestling, I will tell you something. Arm wrestling, one thing for sure. Like thousands of years ago, there was arm wrestling. There was no football. There was no basketball. There was nothing. And I believe if we still exist, thousands of years later, there will still be arm wrestling. But there may not be basketball, football, volleyball or something. So what I'm just saying that arm wrestling is...
SPEAKER_01: One of the oldest and best and truest. Is there a word like that, truest? Yeah. Like true, truer. Is there anything like that or no? Almost true. Nothing comes to mind, but yeah. Yeah, but you know my point, you know. One of those sports, yeah. Yeah, let's see how it will be. Yeah, Devon versus Levan. Chance.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, it's the match everyone wants to see, right? The rematch. Let's hope Devin's bicep stays intact this time and can hold up to all that pressure that LeVon is bringing. It's super interesting. There's a lot of factors going into this match.
SPEAKER_00: Things have changed. I believe things have changed for both Devin and LeVon since last time they pulled at King of the Table. It's hard to say. LeVon will always and has to always be the favorite in every single match he takes until he loses, for sure. But I really think that Devin possesses all of the right tools for the job. When you take into account all factors,
SPEAKER_00: i really think i really think devon's chances are even higher than last time round one in king of the table uh when they faced uh devon stopped him for a second and i was really really surprised and i think devon made a error in round two that caused his bicep to uh you know tear and and from that it didn't really matter but
SPEAKER_00: If Devin can hold up, I really think that there's a lane where LeVon's wrist will go, Devin will stop it, and Devin obviously has way better endurance than LeVon. I think everyone can agree on that. And if that match stops, it's… Chance, say that you are not objective because you are from North America. I'm not saying that you are.
SPEAKER_01: But just say that. Did you hear what Laletin said recently? I didn't hear what he said. Laletin said that if he would bet, he would bet on Danny Devon. Really? Yeah. Okay. A guy that, I mean, he knows. He is around there. He's this category. And he believes that Devon is going to win. This is what he said.
SPEAKER_01: I'm not saying Devin is going to win, but people, whenever I said that it was like anything can happen before the Hermes versus Devin match, people were like, you're trying to sell pay-per-view, how Devin is going to look at his arm and look at the other guy's arm. Like, really, like, I understand that some people may not understand from our match so good, but Levan may beat Devin. Maybe he will.
SPEAKER_01: Crash him. I don't know that. But if anyone is saying that there is no possibility for Devon to win, it's not like that. It's not about how big your bicep is, how big that... You just go, you have the strap, you both load, and then one's wrist goes...
SPEAKER_01: And then who cares if your bicep is 60 cm or 75 cm. I mean, something is happening with your riser, your hand cup, lat pressure, pronator. When both are applying that, one will be just going. Maybe Devon's will go. But to say that Devon doesn't have a chance, just remember how many times
SPEAKER_01: this guy had the stem cell. Arm wrestling is all about this connective tissue. Everything is about these joints, how the joints are holding. It's not like how big the bicep is. If it was all about the bicep, after Devon match, Hermes would focus on more 50-centim, 60-centim bicep. But what did Hermes train? Hermes trained here. Hermes trained here. If Hermes didn't lose against Devon,
SPEAKER_01: he would lose against Vitaly Laretin. Because after that match, he understood that it is like, okay, I so much trusted on my arm, but now I start losing here. Then he started train there. So that's how he went head to head with the wrist position with Vitaly Laretin. He barely survived, yeah. So you understand my point, right? So now this guy, just remember,
SPEAKER_01: i know i'm talking too much but just remember my friend it is a lot of people at the age of 50 52 45 they are all damaged guys they they cannot use what they know at the table because of those things you know some things are missing once these things are fixed
SPEAKER_01: I mean, you can even get 10%, 20% stronger. Not because it gives you hormonal power, because now you are able to use those parts that for many years you are not able to use. So something new is coming to you. So what I feel that Devon's difference after the stem cells is because of this. The guy was just what he was. Even when he pulled against John, no disrespect to John, but John is not at the level of...
SPEAKER_01: Right now, sorry about it, Giorgi Sivetko or Ermes Gasparini. But even with John, he was like, he barely was like this. But now he had the center right away with Gennady. He had the center right away with Ermes. He was like this, but I don't think that he went to Giorgi Mesh with the same motivation he did. He went to Dennis, no disrespect. But still, the guy is not the same guy. So I would like to hear your opinion as well.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah, no, I completely agree. And like you said, I'm not biased. Just because someone's from North America, maybe I root for them, but it doesn't change my mind, my perspective on what I think realistic outcomes are. I put out a video like four years ago or something like that, like my opinion of the top five arm wrestlers in the world, and I didn't include Devin. Artem did an interview with me like seven years ago, like top five arm wrestlers in the world, and I didn't include Devin. So...
SPEAKER_00: I'm definitely not a Devin fanboy or biased towards him, but I do think he's an incredible athlete. And like I said, again, I just think he has the tools for the job. He can apply a lot of pressure on LeVon's wrist, which did go through an injury. He's had plenty of time to heal. But sometimes things don't heal up the same way as before. Sometimes they heal stronger. It's just hard to know until it gets tested.
SPEAKER_00: people said Devin had no chance against armies like you said and he dominated armies um Devin has got probably a hundred stem cell injections at this point and uh he's able to recover so much and and he's all in he's doing everything he possibly can um and this isn't to say that Lavon doesn't have any of these factors as well I'm just saying that uh you know it's it's any given day when you have athletes of this caliber of this level uh it's it's really hard to predict it even even like
SPEAKER_00: for someone like me or even someone like Ingen to predict matches. Sometimes it's too difficult because you don't know all of the factors with all of the athletes and how things are going to play out. So for me, it's like, yeah, it's almost 50-50. On paper, again, I think LeVon always has to be the favorite.
SPEAKER_00: until he loses. It's been, what, seven years since he's lost or something like that. So unless you count the two rounds with armies where he didn't pull. But, you know, I think if someone's going to break the streak, it's going to be Devin. Yeah. Another part is I respect people who believe that LeJuan is going to win, no problem. I respect their opinion as well. But I don't understand when they are like, oh,
SPEAKER_01: Like, same people saying why Lewand is pulling so seldom. And the same people are saying, oh, Lewand is going to kill Devon. Why you said this match? So just what do you want me to do? Are you like, yeah, what is your problem? You know, like, I mean, should he pull or not pull?
SPEAKER_01: If he's going to pull, if Devon is not the one, who is the one, you know? Devon is the one that beat Dave Chaffee, he beat Sandris, he beat Prudnik, he beat Hermes, he beat Denis Siblenko, he beat Georgi Svetko. I mean, if this guy, this guy didn't lose against Levan and then come back, hey, I want rematch or something. This guy just went and cleaned and then come back, you know, except Gennady match. But he was going to pull against Gennady as well.
SPEAKER_01: Gennady got injured. They couldn't pull. And Gennady is injured, still cannot pull. People cannot wait, you know. I mean, not that Devon didn't want to pull Gennady or something. These are all true, you know. It's not about, like, defending Devon or defending this guy or that guy, you know. I mean, let's be honest. You want this guy to pull Armisen or no? He pulls. Why he pulls? He doesn't pull. Why he doesn't pull? Come on. Right. Exactly. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Anyway, so I think, yeah, it will be great. But just who has more to lose in this match chance? Is it Levan? I don't know. I don't know. Because this is Levan's last chance, right? Because I don't think that there will be another one. He's not getting any younger. It's not like that he can get another shot like five years later or something. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I think that this is Devin's last chance to be the number one guy in the world again. I don't think he can do it. You know, in a weight class, maybe. Maybe he can try it. Yeah, maybe. But not in Super ZRC. This is his very last chance in the rest of his life, more than likely, where Levon, he has the legacy. He has the undefeated. He's never lost a super match. He's never lost a professional match.
SPEAKER_00: But the flip side is he could lose this match and next year come back and be undefeated for another seven years. So LeVon still has longevity. It's really hard to say who has more to lose. I think they both have a ton on the line. Yeah, because I think that Devon also has huge dreams. He wants to be remembered as the guy. You understand what I mean? Yeah. He wants to be remembered that way and...
SPEAKER_01: Um, I think, yeah, I think both have a lot to lose. Yeah, you're right. Is the Michael works, uh, space, um,
SPEAKER_01: East versus West 12 card is fire. Chance, WVW, North American events, fire. And he put heart for Pushkar. What did you think about me inviting Pushkar's wife, Svetlana, and did you see that? Yeah, yeah. And his son. And Lev, yeah, together. Before this, Pushkar was the number one. Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_01: I now this is for really number one match in the world. And even when Devon was pulling against Hermes, people was still pointing, but there is Levan. So now Levan is here. So there is nobody that they are saying that, you know, um, I want, I want Pushkar's son, the eight years old kid to come and have the East versus belt. And then.
SPEAKER_01: give it to the winner, the champion. I think that is a very deserving moment. I really think that's amazing that you did that, Engin.
SPEAKER_00: Pushkar is a legend. It's really sad that we lost him so young, and it's also sad that a lot of the new fans of the sport, they never got to see him compete. I was lucky enough to meet him in person and get to arm wrestle with him. He came down to Florida, and I'm really blessed that I had that opportunity. So the fact that you're bringing his wife and his kid, I think that's amazing. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I think it is not only because to make them happy. It is what they deserve. And I kind of think that this is what this match deserves as well. You know, you understand? Yeah, the best guy before he passed away, you know, in his memory because he was the
SPEAKER_01: champion he was going to pull against siplenko as far as i remember and then yeah by representing his father the son comes and do that it will be great moment that's what i believe yeah anyway so so these are for the guys i will repeat one more time the card and then we will slowly finish and then i will remind quickly about what we are doing with chance
SPEAKER_01: East versus West 12, April 20th, Devon Larratt versus Levan Saginashvili, Hermes Gasparini versus Ali Canmuradov, Alex Kurdecha versus Georgi Svetkov, Michael Todd versus Frank Lamparelli, David Samushe versus Nurdalet Aydarhan, Schoolboy versus Leonidas Arkonas, Minda Agvas Tarasaitis versus Artur Makarov, Fiyar Isaac versus Ekaterina Nikiseva,
SPEAKER_01: Irakli Zirakashvili, Oleg Petrenko, Petro Margarin versus Nugo, Sandri Sedis versus Ibrahim Sago, Talgat Aktaev versus Betkili Oniyani. And today, finally, I found the opponent for Arsen Liliyev. It will be Brandon El Cesar. And Michael Wolk space another one. Levan can still advance. He can go.
SPEAKER_01: for number one left hand. Yeah, I'm trying to convince him for the left arm as well, but somehow I see him. I see him. He's training with left arm. I see him, but he's not ready, I think, to pull. But I think he's secretly coming. He's coming secretly, yeah. And also, I want to talk about the North American event. Most likely, we hope August 17, Florida, Orlando Free Florida,
SPEAKER_01: And Chance Shaw will be the person on the ground that I will be working with together. And then Chance also will be, from now on, will be organizing Supermatches, North American Supermatches with the East vs. West name, East vs. West rules, East vs. West table with all those pet things. It will be one level.
SPEAKER_01: behind the main East vs West but it will be really high level and there will be some we still have some competitors from Europe to travel to North America and there will be some top North Americans all the time pulling against each other and all these matches will be official East vs West matches and it will affect it will have effect on the rankings so
SPEAKER_00: Chance, anything you would like to add? Anything you want to say? No, I mean, again, just thank you so much for allowing me to have the event in June and also working with me. I'm happy to help in August, do everything that I possibly can to make this the best East versus West
SPEAKER_01: yet that's that's my goal i want it to be the best east versus west uh you know to date so that that'll be east versus west it will be east versus west 14 yeah and and and you will you will be the one uh who will be doing all things of course i will come as well but i will also be working but on the ground you will be doing everything and you will be the first person
SPEAKER_01: for the North America. Yeah, you will be going in history. That chance is the first one to
SPEAKER_01: do the East versus West event. And trust me, you are like, I have zero doubts. And I know you, I know your father. Your father is also very good, smart man, also very friendly as yourself. And I'm sure that my eyes will not be, you know, looking what's going on there once we make everything together. That's how much I trust you.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I can guarantee it's going to be amazing. And like I said, it's my goal to make it the best event possible. As far as my event in June goes, if anyone, like a match comes to their mind on West versus West that they might want to see, DM me on Instagram or on Facebook and make suggestions. I'm totally open to suggestions and seeing what the fans want to see. And like I said, hopefully I'll have a card announced in the next two weeks for that. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: and michael workspace please get big north american arena because everybody will come yeah he says so and yeah that's all thank you thank you very very much guys and chance needs to go and chance to keep in touch my friends messenger what's up you know let's let's let's rock let's rock our messing world this is what we love and then we have the opportunity just make it
SPEAKER_01: As exciting as possible. And then we need to work a lot. That is how I made this East versus West. If we can count successful, that's how it is. You need to have knowledge. You need to have everything, but you need to really work hard as well. Once again, congratulations and for your events. And I have no doubt that you will be successful as a representative of the new generation arm wrestling and with the international vision you have.
SPEAKER_01: And I'm sure that even the events that you competed over here, overseas, also help you, your experience to be, you know, as an experience. Yes, sir. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Take care of yourself and keep in touch. Yeah. See you again. Thank you. Yeah. You're welcome, my friend. Guys, anything you guys want to ask me, I will try to...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, Samusha beat Brandon Alcestor, but it was 187 pounds. Now there will be 230 pounds Brandon Alcestor. So there will be more than like 20 kilo, around 20 kilo, 20 kilo heavier Brandon. And that will be a little bit different. But just remember, Arsene Lille has not been...
SPEAKER_01: competing for 11 years and he has been trained only for three four months thank you engin and chance for everything you do michael's workspace thank you my friend thank you thank you for your support um yeah he says the guy says what does he say stoic
SPEAKER_01: Can't wait for Devon to lose again. So that is success, my friend. That is Devon's success. Do you know what is Devon's success? Devon's success is that like 90% of the community
SPEAKER_01: cannot be like cannot ignore the guy either they want him to win like crazy or they want him to lose like crazy so that that that is success that is also what muhammad ali was able to do that like people didn't say like oh i don't care about him people either hated him or love them you know yep yep lucky it will be incredible event
SPEAKER_01: Um, I think there are more, more qualifiers. Yeah. Yeah. In Europe and also in, uh, there will be Australian qualifier as well. And I think the winners will come to Istanbul in July, right before the July event. Guys, East versus West is really growing. You know, that, that, that is a fact. And, but it is, I don't see like, like my event, it is, I run it, but I, it is like our event. That is how it happened.
SPEAKER_01: During the pandemic, when the things finished, we started and we did all together. We did East versus West. So now there are so many qualifiers all over the world. And these are not my events. These are those guys' events. This is not like East versus West event. Those are those own events. It has a meaning of the qualification. And I'm happy that we do things all together, you know. Switzerland, yes, we'll have another one here, I think, in June. And there will be...
SPEAKER_01: Also in Hungary, there will be in Czech Republic, end of the year there will be in Romania. There will be many. We will do also in Asia as well. Also, I decided that the winners of European Championships and Asian Championships, which one is in April, the other one is in May, the winners in certain categories will also have the automatic qualification to the final qualification.
SPEAKER_01: and and then the waft winners as well but buff winners will not be for this year but buff winners will be for the next year whatever is happening good is we are doing all together if you didn't support me i would i would have no chance but quit you know hello hello hello everyone just a little bit more chat and i also go i need to really do work i finally
SPEAKER_01: finalize the the card and i'm very happy that finally we did it um yeah at the same time buying the tickets and everything you know soon i will do the hotels and
SPEAKER_01: How is my training, Andres? I'm not training. I wasn't training so good. Anyways, after this hair transplantation, also I had to stop. I don't know if Dennis, it is because pay-per-view is $19.99, Jeff. $19.99. It will not change. And end of this year is $19.99. It will not change.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, Petrenko versus Irakli. Yeah, that's a good one. Yeah, thank you. Thank you, my friend. Yeah, I started the line. Everything is just looking fine. Hopefully, it will be better. East versus West has never been 30 pounds, my friend. And I think that you paid 30 pounds. I will explain to you guys while you are here. I will explain.
SPEAKER_01: I think you pay when the King of the Table, you buy from application. On the website, it was still $19.99. Application, the price was high because application is taking 30% of what you pay. So I think this is why King of the Table made it like this, but I'm sure they will consider this. Either they will not sell from the, I don't know, it's their decision.
SPEAKER_01: or something else. But it was $19.99 on the website. You can ask to people who buy from the website. But East vs West will not be like that because East vs West, I don't sell on the application. I sell only on the website. You just go $19.99 and you buy it. You know, that's all. And the people who did the yearly subscription already before, they pay $17.50 for each event.
SPEAKER_01: King of the Table was only when it is on the application, my friend, as I explained. Auron was already favored, as I explained. He was much heavier. As far as I remember, he was much heavier than Whisperer. And I knew he was going to win. And that happened as it is.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, I mean, yeah, just use the application or you don't use the application. I don't know about it. But that is the reason, my friend. Just you can ask anyone who buy from the website. It was $19.99. Oh, Derek versus Matt Mask. It could go either way, but...
SPEAKER_01: It went to Matt's way. When I say it could go either way, it didn't look that way. But before the match, I was thinking it could go either way. But Matt was better, clearly. Engin, who signed the East versus West strap? Looked great. My friend, everyone signed a few of them. I don't know which one you get it. I also signed.
SPEAKER_01: Irakli is going to pull 95 kilo world title probably in summer, most likely in July event. Devon said, Hermes versus Dennis is a mismatch. I don't believe so. It's not a mismatch. It is a very good match and
SPEAKER_01: Hermes better be careful. I asked this to Morozov. Morozov said it was a 50-50 match. Yeah, when you guys hear the King of the Table June card, you guys will be surprised. It is one of the best, no, probably the best King of the Table card that I have ever seen.
SPEAKER_01: Is it possible to invest in East vs West stocks? You mean like buying the percentage? In July event, will Arsene have match? I mean, I don't think, I think first year, I think Arsene wants to pull on it twice. It's for the beginning, you know.
SPEAKER_01: most likely my plan is in november event i want to say john bersink versus arsene lily the rematch yeah nisa possibly yeah we can consider i was gonna say nisa versus carolina yeah hair transplant for like first 10 15 days 20 days you need to be more careful
SPEAKER_01: I mean, just because Morozov made one wrong prediction, it doesn't mean that every prediction of Morozov is going to be wrong. Like, have you never predicted something wrong? Never? So we should just say that you predicted that one wrong. So anything that you say is, like, doesn't make sense or something, you know. Aleyküm selam, BM kardeşim. Nisa versus Carolina. Yeah, I'm thinking, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Andreas, but most likely probably July events, yeah. When was the last time our sample was 2013 Europeans? Yeah, digging digger, yeah. With the hair transplant come more power. We will see. We will see if there will be more power. I don't think so, but...
SPEAKER_01: I don't think that Arsene kept his power. But Arsene is not a normal human being. Arsene, I mean, he's a normal human being, of course, but he doesn't have the normal past. He came, I think, from wrestling first. I think it was Greco-Roman wrestling. And then he became a great armwrestler, legendary armwrestler. In eight years, he did more than what many people couldn't do for like 20, 25 years, you know. And...
SPEAKER_01: So even if he doesn't train for 11 years, he's not a regular guy. You know, he's Arsene Liriev. And, of course, it will take some time, his power, to come back. But by April, he will be probably training already near six months. So five months, six months, you know. Thank you very much, brother. God willing, you will be fine. Yeah, Dadikyan versus Petrenko would be great, only if Petrenko beats Irakli.
SPEAKER_01: Anything would be good. Like Dadikyan versus Matushenko would be good. Matushenko versus Devon would be good. Dadikyan versus Devon would be good. 115 kilo, I'm saying. Arsene's form with the weights, my friend, Arsene said that from 70 to 80, 85 kilo, as far as I remember.
SPEAKER_01: You guys are underestimating Jerry Calderas. Yeah, Prudnik's right arm is not ready yet. Prudnik's arm is not ready yet. Levan cannot be pulling everyone, my friend, Ed.
SPEAKER_01: I think Vitaly needs to beat some other guys to get a title shot after he lost against Hermes. Yeah, Cadoret versus people says that Vitaly is going to kill Jerry. I'm not sure about that one. And I don't think that even Vitaly would be so sure of himself after that fifth round he had against Dave Chaffee.
SPEAKER_01: Krudnik's left and right, both are right now not feeling good. He's going to inform me whenever he feels good. We don't know. Both Hermes and Levan have matched. Levan has Devin matched. Hermes has Dennis matched. So I don't think it is the right thing to talk about this. Let them pull and let's see.
SPEAKER_01: set the matches right away without knowing what's going to happen.
SPEAKER_01: Engin, can you flex your forearm? Bicep, bicep, no good. I'm telling you, I'm not training for like
SPEAKER_01: Long time and it's getting smaller and smaller. They will be fine. I will start by the beginning of the march, but light, you know, not so heavy. Yeah, Bacho will pull again, yeah. Bacho is our contracted athlete. Aleykum salam, kardeşim.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, you cannot say if Topol is safer than Hook or something. But, I mean, you can get injured in both ways. Greetings to Toronto, Canada. Thoughts on what would be a good matchup for Arlen? I didn't think about it, my friends. You need to pull some young guy, you know.
SPEAKER_01: Or Arden, you know, young guy. Or like this match, you know, some lighter guy. But we will see, you know. We will see. I think it's just let himself and his father decide his level. Because I don't really know the level of Whisper. I have trained with Arden. And I know he's strong. But I don't exactly know...
SPEAKER_01: I think he would like to pull also some like, again, like famous guy.
SPEAKER_01: I'm not getting any anger. When is the anger coming back? I am dedicated to start early, beginning of the March and go forward. Let's see where it goes. Hair transplant is not painful so much, except the injections at the beginning, you know, so that you wouldn't feel the pain. So that, that hurts, but other than that, the, the, the procedure or
SPEAKER_01: No, it didn't hurt, you know. What percentage of Bacho's power do you think Allen possesses? I don't want to say something wrong, but probably 50%. No disrespect, because Bacho is just... I mean, I will tell you something. Bacho...
SPEAKER_01: Yesterday, he lost against Reno. But trust me, Reno is the stylistically the worst, worst, worst case for Basho. Most likely, anyone else would get destroyed, you know. I'm just talking about 95%, 98% of the guys, you know, in the world in that category. I'm talking about our masters, except some elites.
SPEAKER_02: Like, Bacho is incredibly strong. Incredibly strong. Yeah, you're right. Like, yeah, you're right. That the joint pressure, that the press that
SPEAKER_01: um reno applied and remember reno they are same age but reno is much more experienced than uh macho for some years georgians they were not allowed to compete the walls and i don't know where basho will go either 100 or 110
SPEAKER_01: I don't know where it will be going. But probably 105 kilo. 105 kilo at the East versus West. I didn't see Irakli and Pacho. How did it go? I don't know if Pacho's plans, I don't know if he's going to compete or not.
SPEAKER_01: Hello, Connolly family. And again, I'm really excited about Levan versus Devon match. It can go either way. Levan is the favorite until proven otherwise, but the current Devon has a good chance. Anyway, arm wrestling wins. I agree with you. I agree.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, Schoolboy is pulling in the Apple event against Leonidas. Let me one more time read you the cards, and then I'm finishing. Devon Larratt versus Levon Saginashvili.
SPEAKER_01: Hermes Gasparini vs. Ali Canmurado. Alex Kurdece vs. Georgi Svetkov. Michael Todd vs. Frank Lamparelli. David Samushe vs. Nurdalet Aydarhan. Schoolboy vs. Leonidas Arconas. Mindagos Tarasaitis vs. Artur Makarov. Fiyar Ayset vs. Ekaterina Nikiseva. Iraklis Rekashvili vs. Oleg Petrenko. Petro Margarin vs. Nugo Kishatze. Sandris Sedic vs. Ibrahim Sagov.
