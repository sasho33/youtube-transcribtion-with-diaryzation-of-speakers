SPEAKER_04: And we have a WhatsApp group. And in the WhatsApp group, especially today, we had a long, long, long conversation today. That's great. Yeah, normally it's more like information. But today, okay, guys, let's start. Now we are four. Can you introduce yourself? Hello. Hello. Where can I change the name? I don't know how.

And I agree to the challenge. Let me use two arms and you use one finger. How about that? I think I think right now all of you would beat me. Oh, OK. All right. But it's it's got to be left handed.
SPEAKER_01: yeah okay guys let's start introducing yourself uh i'll go first so i've only been watching arm wrestling for a little under two years but uh i got obsessed in basically like a month and this is like the only sport i've cared about for pretty much the last two years um i saw a video of devon layer rock climbing and i was like
SPEAKER_01: arm wrestling, that sounds ridiculous. You know, I'll look up a video to see what it's like. Right. And then, you know, I end up becoming a fan and like, you know, within a month and then I'm obsessed. And now you became you became obsessed and now you are VIP. Yeah, exactly. For the East versus West 12. You know, just imagine how that works, right? Yeah. OK, let's go to the next one with me. As far as it went with me, I started
SPEAKER_00: I started getting on YouTube and watching videos, and what really intrigued me was the Vegas event that Neil put on on the rooftop of the MGM. So when I started watching Devon on the rooftop of the MGM, you know, it started getting me more entrenched. And then WAL came around, and I remember the infamous Devon-Michael match.
SPEAKER_00: And after that match, I just became more entrenched with it, was watching tons of it, but never really got into training or actually arm wrestling myself. Now here about the past two and a half, three years, I've really gotten into training and gotten serious about it. And it's just...
SPEAKER_00: been an obsession that's taken over my life now that's just all there is to it i love it you know as much as i love anything i really do it's great that's great and who's next benny yes um so my name is benny hapke i'm from germany
SPEAKER_02: This is my fourth year of armwrestling and I first got into touch with it because a friend of mine asked me, hey, have you ever seen, he called it American armwrestling and I said no. And then he showed me the match Devon Lorette versus Wagner Bortolato, the left-handed match at WAL. And I just saw this one video and then I fell down a rabbit hole of YouTube videos of more and more armwrestling.
SPEAKER_02: And four months later, I think I started building my own table and getting guys together and started an armwrestling club.
SPEAKER_02: uh so that was uh that's roughly four years ago and uh today i'm the president of the german arm wrestling federation uh i don't understand like four years ago yeah you just made arm wrestling and today you are the president and i don't think you became president today when did you become uh the very first year we joined the federation so my second year of arm wrestling was my first year as president
SPEAKER_02: That's very interesting. You become a fan and next year you are president of the German Armwrestling Federation. Yeah, I was surprised myself. I didn't expect it. It wasn't my birthday even as well.
SPEAKER_02: Somebody suggested me to continue as the president. And I thought I hesitated for a moment. And then I thought, man, this is a chance to make it bigger, to to grow the sport of arm wrestling. You know, I can make decisions now and this could be a good idea. So I said, yes, let's go. And soon, soon, I think in less than two months, you will be organizing
SPEAKER_02: tournament which will be also east versus west qualification exactly on may 25th in germany we will have a an east versus west qualifying tournament arm wrestling and we also have so we don't only have these uh senior classes we talked about the senior categories but we also have categories for newcomers and amateurs so people who have only been in the sport for maybe two to five years uh who are still rather new they will also have a chance to get trophies of course they cannot uh
SPEAKER_04: uh qualify for east versus west right because they're amateur classes but uh we want to give all the amateurs because i'm basically an amateur myself um but to give the opportunity that's how the things start that's how the things start you become amateur and then you became yeah yeah which which i never had chance i directly competed seniors when i was 18 and then yeah no we didn't have junior categories and he smiled hello again how are you good good and you
SPEAKER_03: yeah i'm also fine thank you thank you for having me um yeah i just um five years ago i watched a youtube video with devin and juji mufu uh who has seven as a guest and since and then i'm hooked at uh an arm wrestling and i watch all the videos but just about two years ago i started also arm wrestling and here in hamburg
SPEAKER_03: And also I recently participated at the German national championship as a newcomer.
SPEAKER_03: But I lost. That's not the most important part. The experience and also the fun and meeting new people. It was very, very fun. And I was at East versus West 9 as a guest, but not VIP. And this time I decided to become a VIP and also
SPEAKER_04: yeah i contribute i want to i want to share some memory in the past there was northeast message board like i don't know how you compare but i think northeast message board was from one side biggest thing at that time because all the best arm masters were member of that now we are all divided our youtube channels and our social media at that time we were all together john devon cobra everyone michael todd neil pickup all of us were together
SPEAKER_04: And one day subject was like, it was like, who is the person that inspired you? And everyone was writing either John or this and that, that, you know? And then John came and wrote that the arm masters who come to the events and they go home zero two. It means that they pull two times and both matches they lost.
SPEAKER_04: And they go home and they continue competing. He said that those are the ones that inspire me. It means that they love unconditionally without expecting even anything. You understand? Like, like, I mean, many, many. Yeah. So he said that.
SPEAKER_04: People like that inspired him the most. That was very interesting because everyone was giving top arm wrestlers name, while Jon's perspective was totally different. It's normal that there was nobody to inspire him since he's the...
SPEAKER_04: I will tell you guys before we have the last guest. Like I say this many times and I'm saying that when John was in his prime, which I'm talking about many, many years, when his name was announced and he was on the stage, trust me,
SPEAKER_04: no no exception everyone was right there watching him competing like we all were like we saw an alien or something you know people now sees him 59 years old with all those injuries you know millions of miles on his arms just imagine the pressure that he has been experienced in last 40 years you know all those super heavyweights and everything wild the guy was most of the times 90 95 kilo guy you
SPEAKER_04: Okay, can you also introduce yourself, my friend? Is that Henry or me? Yeah, yeah. Hi.
SPEAKER_04: Hi, nice to meet everyone. So my name is Mehmed. I go by Mike. It's a lot easier to pronounce Mike. I find, but yeah, I mean, I've been an arm wrestling fan for a long time and I live out of Toronto, Canada. And of course, Devon is my fellow Canadian. So I do support him and I feel like he's done so much for the sport and the sport.
SPEAKER_04: I thought went through a period during COVID where I think there was the top eight that never happened and a lot of things got delayed. And then now it's just exploded into so many amazing events. Thanks to our friend Ingen here. It's just incredible how much it's evolved. Only in the last...
SPEAKER_04: two to three years, and I'm so excited to be part of this and and support the sport. And yeah, I have a 15 year old son and we'll be we'll be coming to this event and he's excited. He loves it, too. And I feel like armwrestling just hasn't had its day yet. You know, I mean, it's just it takes lots of time. I remember the UFC 25 years ago. You know, it was a sort of like a sport that no one really thought about. And armwrestling has so much potential to become far more mainstream than it is right now. And
SPEAKER_04: it's just super exciting to to be part of this as i say it's like iceberg the the the part that you see but the most is still you know we don't see i mean i see it but many other people in the world they don't they don't see it you know arm wrestling is beautiful sport like
SPEAKER_04: that that is my main motivation because imagine that you have been competing for many years and you know how beautiful how hard it is when you understand more all those muscle groups and then to make coordination and then when people goes are missing this
SPEAKER_04: yeah but to do this do you know how many muscle groups you need to train specifically and then coordinate them and they don't understand but now they slowly understand so my my motivation one of my motivation is to let people
SPEAKER_04: That should be our main goal because can you imagine it has this much of potential while it is known this much. All we need to do is just to make sure that everyone knows. By the way, with this event, this will be 163 Supermatches.
SPEAKER_04: that I'm organizing, 163 total. Yeah. And plan is end of this year that I will be organizing, hopefully, if still alive, if everything goes well. This is 200 matches, my plan, like from the East versus West, the first one to the 15th. I think now it's 12, 13 is July, 14 is August, and 15 is either end of October or something, you know?
SPEAKER_04: So in 15 events, 200 super matches at this level. So that is incredible. Yeah, it's incredible for our support. And then this is happening because of all of the fans, especially VIPs as yourself that is doing a great support. Thank you for giving us a shout out, Angus. Yes, absolutely. I'll take that shout out.
SPEAKER_04: You guys deserve it. Especially that guy, Henry, really helped the sport. Yeah. One thing, I'd just like to just put one more point out there. So what I find really special about arm wrestling is all these personalities. And that's something that I think could grow the sport as well.
SPEAKER_04: just more of these talking points these videos that you make like like five years ago when i first saw a picture of lavon i thought this guy is you know just a massive man you know he he you don't really know much about him and now after seeing how many countless videos of lavon he he is such a funny guy he's got such a quirky personality and
SPEAKER_04: you can't you can't help but like Lavon he's such a likable guy and then there's armies you know you know my friend like everyone loves armies right so yeah yeah yeah everyone they're all unique they're all just like everyone in this on this Zoom calls is different and unique as well right right absolutely yeah and and think about this in this community if you say my friend
SPEAKER_04: everyone will understand yeah yeah anyway so let's talk about the event are you guys excited oh very much very much
SPEAKER_02: yeah this is the most most excited i've ever been for anything may i ask you a favor real quick okay um i would like to extend a greeting to my uh to my club members who are watching right now and we have um we have like a chant that we use in practice it's a german word and i would like to ask you if you could say that word for us it's not a bad word it means something like power
SPEAKER_02: okay okay okay and uh the word is must i just said must must yeah very good that's all that's all for arm wrestling club dresden uh must okay okay okay then that was too fast what was the beginning um for the arm wrestling club dresden oh okay for the arm wrestling club in dresden must
SPEAKER_04: Oh, you're making everything longer and longer. I won't be remembered. The last word I add. Ordentliche. Say again. Ordentliche. Must. Thank you very much. Engel, you're a hero. No, it is more than pleasure, but I don't want to mess the things, you know, because I don't think I'm good about pronunciation.
SPEAKER_04: So guys, which matches are like you looking forward the most?
SPEAKER_00: Well, I mean, the elephant in the room would be Devon and LeBron, right? We know what the main subject is, but in my, in my opinion, the, just the whole card in general, what you've done with this card is just unbelievable. I mean, you got a Rackley and Sasho and Alex and Georgi, and I mean, it's just, it's such a deep card and you got Fia there as well. And yeah,
SPEAKER_00: And that's a great match. That's a great match. I need to apologize because I talk about John like I sounded like John is the goat or something. So I apologize. I mean, Douglas, who is the real goat here? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You got it. You got to remember he's a real guy. Yeah. But yeah, the card in general is just amazing. I mean, it's to me, it's the best one yet for sure. Without a doubt.
SPEAKER_01: You know, because I was thinking the other day, I was like, if Devon and LaVon wasn't at this event, this event would be awesome. You know what I'm saying? Like, it's still a good event even without that match. And if it was only that match, it would still be a cool event. So it's like, you know, it's like two events in one. You understand? Like, it is so much more, you know, like if there's someone who buys some and doesn't buy others, they're definitely buying this one, you know? Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: and if it didn't have devin and levon this would still be like a card you have to get you know that's why there's so many vips you know everyone wants to be there you know yeah and other guys just just really quickly um what surprises me is 20 us dollars for this quality of arm wrestling
SPEAKER_04: Honestly, I know it's early in the sports progress and you want to draw people in, but I feel like there's potential for getting a little bit better on the economics. I don't know if everyone agrees with me, but 20 sounds like such a low number. I would pay $20 just for each match, honestly. Yes. I would pay $100 for the pay-per-view. Devon't get me wrong.
SPEAKER_04: Devon't get me wrong. I'm not saying you're doing anything wrong. You're going to grow this the way you're supposed to grow it. I don't want to take advantage. I don't want to take advantage. I said this year will be 1999. I said it and this is 1999. As long as I cover it, one reason, of course, I would like to make money out of these events, but it is more we make it
SPEAKER_04: it for sure, it will affect the product, it will affect the Atlas payment and everything, you know? So we need to be stronger. We cannot just stay small and expect to grow so big, you understand? That should be together. So, but again, you know, 1999, I mean, I can cover the event. This is my estimation and I think everything is fine. Also, I would like to say, whenever I make the matches, I tell you what the truth.
SPEAKER_04: If there is Devon versus Levan match and then you put five more good matches, trust me, it will sell as much as it's going to sell now 14 matches. But that is not my goal. My goal is to involve as many as athletes. So this is not just to entertain you, but this is make sure that we build a league with the rankings. Everyone gets enough of matches so that
SPEAKER_04: that we will be taken seriously by the rest of the world. And I can keep all the top athletes busy. You understand? They have a goal. They have a goal to run after. That's why we are doing all the qualifications all over the world. Now we started, we can show challenger series in US. So that is like, I think UFC has a real main event and then fight nights, right?
SPEAKER_04: I heard it. So this is going to be like five nights, you know, like, so just like, just everything will be better, you know? Okay. Which matches do you guys are looking for? Ismail, what's yours? I'm looking forward to Alex and Georgi. Alex and Georgi. Yeah. And also Irakli. Oh, Sasho Irakli match? Yeah, also. Very excited for that. But...
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I agree with everyone. Every card is great. A great matchup. And the interesting thing is that we didn't know this many of Atlas. It was usually circling around five, six, ten top guys. But whenever you give the community more matches and give the stage to the other Atlas, so now we have
SPEAKER_04: community that is becoming fan of the other athletes too because i mean there are so many people if you give them a stage trust me they will show themselves and then they will also you will also become uh fan of them you know and and you uh benny your favorite matches of course i'm a huge devil right i actually i didn't know this was going to happen but i do have a
SPEAKER_02: uh like a i'm not gonna show it but it's like a devin lorette fan t-shirt i'm just i'm wearing right now um so i'm looking forward to that match but i'm also looking forward to uh irma's uh left-hand match um because yeah with aljan i think if because there's not much information on irma's left hand and um we can i think this is uh this would be a great match if he wins it then there's more opportunity here or to just to see where is irma's
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, a part of that match is also very interesting to me. I think Prudnik and Ali Jean was, I think, one of the best matches that has ever been set ever. It's like two hook pullers in the same weight class. It was like perfect. And then he just ran through him. And I don't think anyone saw that coming, right? Everyone was like, this is going to be a war. It's going to be close. Maybe it'll be like 4-1. No, I don't think. If you asked 100 people, not one of them, except for me, would have said that Ali Jean would win 4-0 like that.
SPEAKER_04: so no you know it's okay but four zero is okay yeah but in that manner yeah absolutely yes that was unbelievable i will tell you guys something very quickly and i apologize all the elite athletes that i am i have been invited to talk about arm wrestling with you guys is more fun than talking with them you know
SPEAKER_04: I see more passion with you guys than those athletes. Not that they don't have passion, but with you guys, like I see that the hunger that you like to talk and you all are very knowledgeable, very knowledgeable. I feel like a lot of the athletes aren't, they aren't fans. They're just competitors. You know what I'm saying? They kind of follow it, but they're not like, we are like, we're dedicated to the story, you know?
SPEAKER_00: I guess there was a time when they also were more into it, but you get used to it, I guess, over time. You know a match also that keeps getting looked over is Camille and Tobias, obviously. Nobody's even talking about that match very much, and that's a main eventer. I mean, that's a match to me that's just...
SPEAKER_00: I mean, pure inside shoulder press versus quick, fast outside. I mean, that's just, that's a great match. That's a great match. And that's another match that I consider 50-50. We will talk about it. We will talk all of them. We will talk about all of them. Predictions we will do. Yeah. And Mike?
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I'm gonna say outside of Devon LeVon. Obviously that's the big one, but I really love this Kurdecha versus Georgi match. I know Kurdecha is a bit more dominant on his left. But to see a big guy like that, like like his last match against the.
SPEAKER_04: against Morozov when he came out and did the flop press. I mean, that was, for a big guy like that, it's very impressive. And I can't wait to see how he fares against Georgi. Georgi's got that iron wrist that's, you know, he says has never been broken, right? So that's going to be a war. And I'm trying to envision a big guy doing what Gradec is able to do with the press, the flop press.
SPEAKER_04: I'm trying to think about, you know, is this something that LaVon is training for? Does he have something up his sleeve for Devon? If he has to use it, I don't know. He tried to sort of do that against the... No, no, no, no. We are not talking about that. We are not talking about match analysis now. We will just start from that. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Sorry, sorry. Yeah, yeah. I just asked which match you are interested because then at the end, we will not have anything to talk about.
SPEAKER_04: yeah i might say kurdecha and georgie for me that's that's number two okay okay for me all of them are all of them are yeah crazy absolutely yeah that's all you got to say okay that's exactly what the promoter would say they're all the best match
SPEAKER_04: Oh, but trust me, they are. Oh, I agree. No, no, no. I'm not a promoter. I'm an arm wrestling fan. Arm wrestling fan and arm wrestling a little bit author as well. You understand? A little bit I understand from what I'm doing, yeah. And so let's start with, do you guys know? Okay, now I will see how deep your fanaticism is. You know, when I say fanaticism, like your passion is about arm wrestling. Let's see if you did the good homework.
SPEAKER_04: Nogo Chikadze versus Petro Marharint. Who wants to start?
SPEAKER_04: Henry wants to start, I think. Okay. Do you know what I will do? I will randomly pick so that you won't be copying from each other. Let's start with Benny. Benny is an arm wrestling guy, but he is only four years. So Benny, you start. And before I start making up stories, I have to say I have no idea who any of those two are. I'm sorry.
SPEAKER_02: you serious penny i am serious uh my i have one uh excuse because last weekend we had uh the uh our nationals and i was part of organizing everything and so i had busy busy weeks before and i didn't really oh okay yeah okay okay does anyone have i think i can say that this is
SPEAKER_04: the least known, one of the least known in the card because Nugo is fairly new and Petro Marharint hasn't been super active. So is there anyone that
SPEAKER_04: Ingen, can you say the names again? I didn't realize there was another woman's match on the card. I thought Fia was the only match on the card. It's not a woman. It's Nogoshikaze versus Petro Marharint. So it looks like we're going to pass this one. Okay. Yeah, I'm not familiar. Okay, so let's go. Brandon Assessor versus Torian Golemanov. Anyone? I met Golemanov last year.
SPEAKER_02: in uh in croatia and um there was nothing like like i think i um armrested him at the side table but he's multiple european champion i think right and yeah i could feel that so um did you train with him a little bit oh yeah just some some side table uh stuff just a little bit and how did you think about his table uh i was to be honest there's a point when people are so strong they just like drive you over and for with him it felt like this like he just
SPEAKER_04: smashed me to the pad there was nothing i could do and um so i think he will beat right now assessor yeah do you are you guys familiar with brandon assessor a little bit yeah okay not much any any any prediction any opinion about this match from anyone
SPEAKER_00: I feel like Brandon has to stop it somewhere and try to get set somewhere in the match, whether he can be stretched out and sitting and try to hold and wait or try to supinate in and hold and wait or something. He has to stop it somewhere, but I don't think it's going to be him being offensive. I think he's going to be playing defense the entire time. It's just can he play enough defense?
SPEAKER_00: to switch it over to offense because brandon does have a good press if he gets it to inside his shoulder he will press and and if he gets to that position then it's going to be trouble but it can he hold on and can he you know hold the surge that he's going to feel at the go because i don't think he'll be on offense at all i think he'll be playing defense the entire match
SPEAKER_01: Any other one or should I go next match? Well, I was going to say Brandon Alcester is like destroying everyone in America right now. And I think it's very interesting when you get a guy who's very dominant in his region. You don't know how good he is. Right. So it's like I would personally say just off that I have him as the favorite with me not being too familiar with his opponent. But whenever you have a guy that's like trapped in a region and he's just killing it, I think
SPEAKER_04: When you take him out of that region, he's going to be very good. So I would say probably Brandon Alc√©sar, but I don't have any strong opinion, you know? I understand, yeah. Okay. Do you guys know about Betkili Oniani versus Talgat Aktaev? Do you guys know these guys? Okay. I think I go next one.
SPEAKER_04: sandra said this versus ibrahim stago that's a big anyone that's that's a big one whoever wants to go first mike you don't need to be invited if you have anything to say
SPEAKER_04: I mean, I've watched Sandris quite a bit. I don't have too much knowledge of his opponent in this one. So it's tough for me to give an educated opinion on this. But I mean, Sandris is obviously a juggernaut. He's very, very good. I just don't know enough about the opponent, fortunately. Did you watch his opponent pull against Todd Hutchings?
SPEAKER_04: Is Ibragim the one with the fast press? Yeah, he's the AMC champion with the beard. Yeah, yeah. He and Todd Hutchings had a kind of tough match. And Todd won 3-2, but all the rounds that he lost were on fouls. Right, right, okay.
SPEAKER_01: yep that's what I was gonna say about that I feel like I'm talking too much but I I've studied a lot of these matches so anyway but it bringing saw I have AMC as like a very high level tournament I think a like if you if you're an AMC champion you're gonna be very good basically basically the Russian Championships like yeah I think except three four opener uh in last seven the rest were
SPEAKER_01: uh russians yeah it's just like more like russian championships yeah yeah and and because i believe he won amc at 105 kg if i'm not mistaken yeah um i think four times yeah so he i mean he's been killing it over there same thing with brandon el cesar it's like if you got him in like a certain area and he's just killing it you know i have todd hutchings like really high up and he had a war with todd hutchings so
SPEAKER_00: would give it to ibrahim but i'm not like uh that's another like really close match you know if sandras you know killed him i wouldn't be shocked you know that could really go anywhere there's a lot of variables you know i think i think it i think if you put a vote out on this match i think that everybody would be voting sandras and thinking that sandras is going to get the win but you know after seeing what ibram did with todd hutchins and and what he's done at amc just like henry said
SPEAKER_00: it it will not surprise me a bit if he runs right through him inside like sandras is going to have to be really strong outside and and pull him out of his shoulder or or match him and and i just i don't know if he can you know we'll see but um yeah in my opinion i think ibram's a slight favorite in that match and any other opinion
SPEAKER_04: Ismail, you look like you're waiting for the more main event matches. Yeah, I don't know much about Ibragim, so that's why I am not. Okay, let's go. Schoolboy versus Leonidas. That's a good one. You start, Benny, you start.
SPEAKER_02: uh yeah he's uh leonidas is german right he's um yeah representing representing germany um i this is this is very difficult to say this in the public but i don't think leonidas is gonna win i don't think so i think scuba is too much gym that's sorry i just said it i can't uh take it back um
SPEAKER_04: But I'll be happy if he surprises us or he surprises me and actually beats Skoolboy. But I don't think he can do it. I think Skoolboy is too much. Leonidas is very, very strong. Yeah. But Skoolboy is more experienced, even though he's very young. Yeah. Yeah. And others? Yeah. I think it's going to be... Sorry. Go ahead. Go ahead. No, go ahead. Go ahead, Henner. Oh, that's Mike. Go ahead, Mike.
SPEAKER_04: Just really quick, I honestly think... You don't say much, just go ahead. I mean, just honestly, to your pointing, in Leonidas, he's very, very strong, but when you watch his left versus right, there is a bit of a difference there. This is a right-handed match, correct? Yeah, but he also... Yes.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, but I wouldn't put Larry Wheels at the level of Schoolboy. I think Schoolboy will take this match very comfortably. He's just got too much strength on the top role. He's too good and too experienced. I don't think he's going to be overpowered to that extent. Like he was versus Khalid. Khalid beat him by sort of overpowering him. I don't think Leonidas will be able to... You mean Khalid beat him by overpowering? No, Khalid beat him just waiting here until Schoolboy got exhausted.
SPEAKER_04: and then get up and beat him, you know, just... Desperation. I would call it foul, you know, in the same second. Right, the later rounds. The later rounds, he sort of, like, you did... Yeah, but he exhausted the guy, you know. You don't spend a lot of power when you're like this, while the other guy is just, you know, killing himself. Yeah, yeah. Trust me, the schoolboy was stronger than Ali, you know. Yeah, trust me. That's why he had to go under the table.
SPEAKER_00: He's not a small guy. Schoolboy is 280 pounds, right? He's a pretty big guy. He's very big. Yeah, he's very big. Benetola is as well. Yeah, sorry. What do you think, Skyler? You were going to jump in? Well, I think that clearly Schoolboy is a favorite, and he's got the leverage advantage. But I'm going to tell you something. Leonidas has got a sticky spot, and he's got a sticky brachial. And if he stops that match anywhere close to the pad,
SPEAKER_00: schoolboy can get tired he can and i i think you know if it gets to the straps every round and leonidas can can wear that handout wear that hand up i i do think there's a lane i mean i don't think schoolboy is just gonna run right through him and crush him like if everybody else thinks that that's not what i think at all i i think that it could very well turn into a war very quickly by around two or three if schoolboy isn't careful but schoolboy is the favorite yes
SPEAKER_04: Okay. I will tell you something. I think I have seen Leonidas in at least four or five East vs West events. And he did after pulls. Every time I saw him, he was better than last time.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, he was like, he's just becoming better and better technically. And if that match, as you said, you know, it goes to the war, it will be hard for Schoolboy to win if it is really a war. Yeah. Yeah. And so let's go to the next one. Fia Rijstek and Ekaterina Nikisheva. Any opinion on this match?
SPEAKER_01: um okay well okay I I don't want to speak up I I have yeah so with this match uh Ekaterina hasn't competed in a very long time but when she did she was very Elite like I I believe she won laugh in her weight class left and right arm uh
SPEAKER_01: so i think this is another match where there are many variables so it's hard to to predict um but i believe fia ryzic is the favorite since she's been much more active than uh katarina but this is another great match where you know i think in general when you get these like weight class matches you're always going to have a war if there are two elite people in their weight class it's very rare you see like a one-sided match i think this one has potential to be a good match
SPEAKER_00: But I could also see, like, Fia, like, just running through her if she's, like, not in shape and hasn't been training recently, you know? So that's a great match. Yeah. Yeah, in my opinion, Ekaterina's great, but, I mean, we're talking about Fia or Isaac. Like, I think that she's the clear favorite, and it will most likely show. Okay, if there is no other...
SPEAKER_04: opinion we are going to do match of the god mindaga star ascites versus arthur macaro okay who wants to start do you have any any opinion about this match absolutely well i see him and
SPEAKER_03: Go ahead. I would say Mindaugus will win this match against R2. So it will, I think, 4-0 for me. Were you impressed by Mindaugus when he pulled against Daniyat Prokopchuk? Yeah, definitely.
SPEAKER_02: okay guys let's start what's the weight category for this one or the weight this is 75 so okay so makarov is also 75 yeah yeah yeah makarov was only 74 kilos when he pulled adam was just
SPEAKER_01: uh if no one has any thoughts on this uh i guess i'll talk i think uh arthur makarov is gonna just like absolutely run through him he has been like completely dominating waft for like the or not wafer amc with like very little resistance at all no no no no no no it's just alan zola is that
SPEAKER_01: Oh, I'm getting him and Alan's okay. I take it all back. I'm an idiot. Artur usually puts breaks to Alan's goalie, but... Okay, so he's not winning. Yeah, Alan ends up winning, yeah. Okay, I take that back then. Yeah, then I don't know. I've got no clue. Well, that's the way I see it going. I mean, I think Mindaugus is going to, you know, attack the hand like he always does. But, you know...
SPEAKER_00: Artur's got a very weird hand to grip. I mean, you've arm wrestled him, Ingen. You know. I mean, does he feel weird to grip? Yeah, I mean, you know, you cannot... You can't access his hand. I mean, you can, but it is not comfortable, you know. Yeah, exactly. And that's the thing that I think Mendy might have a little trouble with, but...
SPEAKER_00: You know, I don't know. I mean, if Mindaugus gets his hand, I mean, I think Mindaugus wins. But, I mean, Makarov's about containment, you know, and if it gets in the straps and he can contain him, then it might be a different match. You know, I think that that's a closer match than a lot of people think. I don't know. I mean, that's a tough one. For sure it's going to go to the strap.
SPEAKER_04: And these two pulled a lot of times before. I just imagine while you're talking, the goal came and then it was like breath cutting from my side. It's just like my category. I have pulled both guys and it is incredible. I mean, people need to understand that these guys, I will say this, like Mindawas,
SPEAKER_04: compared to i can say 99 of the heavier guys he is making less mistake than the heavier guys yeah i'm not saying that he can beat them but just what he is doing is very near very near to perfect i'm not saying that he's doing everything perfectly but what he is doing is very near i would just say 95 from 100.
SPEAKER_04: He's a technician. There's no doubt about that. He's a great technician. And that's why I would consider him the favorite in the match. But if Makarov gets the brakes on him, then it turns into a different match. No, it's not that Makarov brakes on him. Makarov will be the one who is attacking. Defending. Oh, he thinks. He will be attacking. And Mindaugus needs to stop it. Makarov is a machine. Yeah. But it is Mindaugus that needs to...
SPEAKER_04: crack stop yeah and then the control exhaust him and beat him very similar to the daniel match basically i mean the pulling style is different but yeah of course yeah but similar in a way after tight pressure is just like it doesn't belong to that category would you say yeah would you say that yeah whenever i pull him especially the second match i had the hit because my angles
SPEAKER_04: i'm not as strong as him but my angles are more coordinated so he was he was giving up from here you know but trust me if he hits you you will feel like like a train hit you yeah would you say i believe that is more powerful than uh would you say that makarov is more powerful than daniel like in terms of i mean in my opinion yes yeah okay yeah but i'm talking about different different power you know
SPEAKER_04: daniel is also making not so much mistake while like arthur is so big but i don't think that his his hand control his the large big hand is also a little bit causing him to have that super hand control either yeah you know what i mean like he doesn't have that super great grip sometimes he even closes his own
SPEAKER_04: index finger, you know, because that hand is no disrespect, but not regular hand, you know, it's a different hand, you know. So it was an incredible match. Like for me,
SPEAKER_04: Right here. Like almost, almost as big as Devon versus Levan match in my book. Because I look at from the pure arm wrestling perspective, like not the size, not the fame or something. I have different, different view of arm wrestling. Yeah. And anyone else that would like to say about this match or I should go next one?
SPEAKER_04: Okay, I go next one. So this is another incredible one. Sasho versus Irakli. Mike?
SPEAKER_04: i'm gonna go with sasho i mean when he gets you into that hook i feel like you need you literally need a train to get to get past him he's just so strong and the paul in match was an incredible match and it really showed his stamina and his ability to go through a very long war i'm not sure if iraqli is going to have the same level of endurance and i got to go with sasho on this i understand they have pulled three years ago
SPEAKER_04: istanbul in istanbul best 78 kilo event there was eight guys and they competed not the 78 kilo but they we also had super masters there they they pulled there and four one such a uh won and first first round iraqi won though and then more rounds iraqi got exhausted yeah uh it's mine i'm familiar with these guys
SPEAKER_03: i would say directly i should i would get the win um let's say i get inside sasha will take the win but i think iraqli won't it won't happen he will go to top roll and get the pin yeah for me at least yeah yeah i think it's sasha
SPEAKER_02: I think Sasho can, I think it will be, I think it won't be like 4-0 either way, but I think they will, Irakli might be able to get outside of his hand, like maybe first and second round because he's so explosive and he has that back pressure. It's like I could imagine Sasho losing the first two rounds, but I think then he can, he should have it from there on.
SPEAKER_04: So maybe a 4-2, 4-1. I understand, yeah. Just one opinion from me. Trying to top roll Sasho is almost suicide. Okay. Yeah. I'm not saying that you shouldn't go outside, but trying to take his wrist completely is not a super good idea. But to hang him on your pronator and curl his pronator and go over
SPEAKER_04: over his pronator like you understand you you like you don't take his wrist but you stop his wrist you hang him on your pronator and then you curl his and then like almost like punching the pad with your fist
SPEAKER_04: Like this. Yeah, like a high hook, I can say. That is probably the best way to beat him. We will see. We will see. But a few days ago when I had them as my guest, Sasho said that he doesn't supinate anymore. He protects his pronator and he does only with the wrist. If he does such thing, then there may be a possibility that he may lose his wrist because usually he's protecting his wrist, not only with his wrist power, but also
SPEAKER_04: with supination side pressure with here you know he's putting so much pressure on openness if he keeps his own pronator like this then he won't be putting pressure from here because he's not supinated but he will be doing only with the wrist so I don't know is there a reason why is he doing now that who
SPEAKER_03: uh sasho sasho is um world champion every year no no i mean yeah he said there's a reason why he's doing that yeah the supernatant i mean yeah he's not tomorrow so i mean that okay can you repeat again i'm sorry now why he changed his style from supernatant now to this because because he thinks that he thinks that he shouldn't be giving his
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, he thinks that he should protect here at all times. This is what he said at least. Maybe he's doing mind games to Irakli, who was in the same podcast. Who knows, you know? Yeah. Any other opinion about this match?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah. Oh, you go ahead, Henry. Go ahead. Okay. I was going to say, basically, Sasho was used to going up against people who are much taller than him and try to top roll him. Yeah, it's like a Venus flytrap. It's just like the moment he just like clamps down, there's like no chance.
SPEAKER_01: I personally think Irakli's top roll is not even close to enough to get past Sasho's wrist. That guy has, like, a super freaky hand. I mean, it is really hard to top roll Sasho. You don't see a whole lot of videos where he, like, loses his wrist. So I personally think it'll probably be 4-1, maybe 4-0. But it's just going to go straight inside. Who's been in?
SPEAKER_01: Sasho, Sasho. OK, yeah, it's going to go straight in the hook. Iraq is going to do everything he can to try to, like, pull out of it. But there's just not enough back pressure to get out of that cup. I mean, his cup is just ridiculous. And he also has a press. John did everything he could to topple him, literally just like.
SPEAKER_01: and it's just he made no progress there was just no there's no bending that guy's respect so i think uh if iraqli were to top roll him and win i would be super super impressed with iraqli but i i don't think that'll happen but he doesn't have to do that i mean do like he can he can go this and that way you know do you guys remember his match with ruslan babaya
SPEAKER_04: he didn't really exactly take the risk but he just hang him here and then he went to uh sideways like iraq yeah after after he lost against kasha iraqli he beat krasimir who is a hook puller very convincingly and he beat pauline his wrist is incredibly explosive the sideway
SPEAKER_04: And lately, I also read Rustam Bauev. Rustam Bauev is, in my book, probably pound for pound, like best guy, hook inability. I'm not saying the strongest pound for pound, because probably this is all Elijah Murad in his prime.
SPEAKER_04: But about hooking someone, I toppled his wrist in 2001. After that, with right arm in his category, I don't remember somebody taking his wrist. But Irakli was able to hang him and beat. But Rustam said that, do you guys remember, Rustam injured his chest when he was pulling against Pauline. And Rustam said that he was still afraid, but
SPEAKER_00: We cannot take anything away from Iraqi, but Iraq is very effective. So you go Skyler. Yeah, I know everybody has Sasho was the favorite, but Iraq Lee is just looked very dominant lately. I mean, I think he's even changed a little bit. He just looks really good after what he did to Paul Lynn. I mean, I still think Sasho was probably still the favorite, but it would not surprise me at all if Iraq Lee won the match.
SPEAKER_00: like not at all not at all would it surprise me because i think he's leveled he's he's leveled up that much and i and it's been three years since they pull i know sasho's probably leveled up as well but iraqli just looks really good lately i mean sasho is going to have to a major time dealing with him you know if he if he's going to win the match he is going to be a major difficult win that's my opinion i i think that if the match is close the power level is close
SPEAKER_04: I'm not saying my prediction, but I'm just saying if the power level is close, I think I see the match in more favor of Sasho because of endurance. And this is a title match, best of seven. The winner needs to win four times. But there is also possibility, like if anyone, if any of these will be dominating the others, right from start to the end, it is Irakli, if that happens. So Irakli's chance is more in a domination
SPEAKER_04: Well, if the match was closed, I think Sasho would exhaust him. Yes, I agree 100%. And Mike, did you share your opinion? I'm just getting old. I don't remember. I'm on the Sasho train as well, just largely because of his endurance and his strength in the hook. If he gets you there, you're not getting out of it. So I'll stick with Sasho.
SPEAKER_04: Sasho, okay. Heart and Alex love child. Hello Engin, greatest promoter with strongest pronator. Thank you. That's your kindness, my friend. And there is one guy I saw. He said, where was it? He said, thanks to VIP guys. Where was it? I just saw it. Scroll down to the bottom.
SPEAKER_04: yeah yeah yeah i don't know how to read but hook wiji fitness sorry if i pronounce wrong thank you vip sponsors yes vip sponsors is one of the uh reason that this event is uh brought to you anyway so let's go to the next one um michael todd versus frank lamparelli
SPEAKER_02: oh that's a good comeback match for michael yes i think he can he can win this and this will be good for him and i'm looking forward to the match i don't think either guy will just smash through the other this will be a long a very long and entertaining match i'm pretty sure very well contested on both sides
SPEAKER_04: Let me guess, Benny. You are saying that Frank is going to have the hand control, but he will have a hard time to finish it. Is this what you see? I do, yeah. I do.
SPEAKER_01: All right, I'm going to say something controversial, and I may, you know, eat my words so hard, but I'm going to say my honest opinion. I think this is a 99 to 1 match. Michael Todd's going to kill him. It won't even be close. I think stylistically, this is a really difficult match for Frank to win, unless if his press is just like unbelievable. But I think what will probably happen is at the start, Mike will open arm top roll and...
SPEAKER_01: Maybe best case scenario, Frank somehow keeps his wrist through that, but I don't think he'll be able to finish Mike off in this position. But I might not even get there. I think Mike might even flash pin. I think this is like a very one-sided match. But I'm prepared to eat my words. Michael winning this match is very understandable.
SPEAKER_04: michael right from the beginning flash pin in french that that will be i think very difficult you know remember i said this and when it happens i'm going to be looking at you okay i think you will be looking at me like you know oh okay yeah i never said this thing
SPEAKER_00: Henry, I got to come back with, don't you remember that Frank's the guy that took Matt Mask's hand three times in a row? It's true. Have you seen that mask, Henry, before? Michael Todd is going to be on B-side. There's no doubt about it. Yeah, I totally agree, but I think he'll be in full control. Have you seen that first mask, like, some years ago?
SPEAKER_01: um i haven't i i i actually i do remember that i think it was like like nine ten years ago a long time ago i believe it was very close match if i remember correctly yeah three two three two michael won but michael stopped him you know like position oh yeah it was very like ugly break arm like you're like watching it going like this you know yeah yeah yeah
SPEAKER_04: okay i regret saying this now because then you know everyone's going to be laughing at me when you know really just boom nobody's going to laugh at you because you had you had the wrong wrong in their in their head they'll laugh at me no i still think michael's favorite henry yeah i still i still think michael's the favorite because i still think it's going to stop the match
SPEAKER_01: I'm big on like I always check Armbet to see what like the people with the money think. In the first hour, Mike's part was sold out instantly and Frank Lamparelli had like $10. But yes, but just remember that the speed or the betting
SPEAKER_04: the speed of the match are not the same thing you know so what i just tried to say that that if you ask those people just because they bet quickly it doesn't mean that they think it doesn't mean it's gonna win quickly yeah yeah we will see what's that do i pronounce your name correct or no
SPEAKER_00: Who, me? Schuyler? Yeah, that's right. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, no, like I said, I think ‚Äì
SPEAKER_00: I mean, Frank's hand is obviously unbelievable because if you, I mean, you don't see a whole lot of people take Matt's hand. So anybody that can take Matt's hand, he's for real. So I don't consider Michael Todd's hand to be up there with the elite's hand. So we know that Michael's hand is probably going to get taken. He's going to stop the match in my opinion. And I, and I do think Michael is the favorite and I do think he'll come out and win the match, but yeah,
SPEAKER_00: I do think it's going to be a war. I think it's going to be very, very, very long drawn out matches. And I just think he's going to have to gas Frank. I mean, that's the only way he can win, but I do think he is going to win the match, but it's going to be very difficult for him. And to be honest with you, if Frank did win, it wouldn't surprise me at all, at all. Mike.
SPEAKER_04: I'm going to go with Michael Todd. I do think this is a great opportunity for him. It's a good comeback match. And it'll be a drawn-out war, probably a very ugly win. He'll go into his king's move and utilize it as long as he needs it. And I can't see him losing this match. I think he's just a bit too strong for an easy sort of quick top-roll win on Frank's part. So I think Michael Todd will take it.
SPEAKER_04: But after a war? Yeah, I mean, it'll be as ugly as you can imagine with the King's move and it'll be drawn out and he'll just bleed him out slowly and eventually he'll get the win. I feel like it'll be a close match though. And Ismail? I also agree. I think Michael will take the win. But it won't be 4-0.
SPEAKER_03: My opinion, though, maybe a close call for 3 or for 2. Maybe he will finish it with the last, maybe last round of a press, quick press. Let's see. Yeah, but this is that title match, so whoever comes to 3 is winning this one. Ah, 3. Okay, best of 5. Okay. Yeah. So, let's go. Davit Samushia versus Nurdaulet Aydar Khan.
SPEAKER_00: Any opinion about this one? Yeah, super close, I think. I mean, closer than probably what most people are going to think it is. But I still think Samushia is the favorite. Until somebody proves otherwise, he's the guy. And honestly, Ingen, I thought you were the guy that were going to prove otherwise. And that's what I was hoping for.
SPEAKER_00: But until that day happens, I still think Samushia is the guy at that category. So you are waiting for me to pull him? I'm waiting for you to come out and give it to him. When is it going to happen? Do you think that if it happens, it's going to be an anticipated match? There's no way that he can contain you. People will care about that match? Absolutely. Absolutely.
SPEAKER_00: you're gonna beat him seriously i don't know about that i don't know about that i'm serious i think that your style is very very dangerous to him yeah but but he has he i mean you know you know more than i do but i mean that's my opinion i think you're very dangerous to him my friend whenever you know more you doubt more because yeah you know you know all the possibilities like when i was young i'm gonna go destroy something
SPEAKER_04: The more you experience, the more you are careful. I understand. That's what I want you to do. How about that? I'll just say that. That's what I want you to do. Yeah, that is making more sense. Because it looks like you are telling me what you want to see. I would love to see it. Anyways, Davit Samushia, seven title matches, seven wins. I mean, this is just...
SPEAKER_04: like unbelievable unbelievable like you're pulling i'm bringing him all the best guys and i'm like i'm gonna bring you this time someone but did you guys uh see the vladimir myro or i should say alexander yeah yeah yeah oh i i um i was really looking forward to this match because i i saw alexander uh at swiss open in october live
SPEAKER_02: It was a very long event. The champ of champs class was finished at, I think, 4 in the morning. I didn't know who Majorov was at the time, but just one of my friends, he said, you have to watch this guy. And so we just waited for the entire event.
SPEAKER_02: to see him pull in champ of champs with his like 70 kilo or whatever he weighs uh beating the 110 kilo guys and 120 kilos 85 stories yeah or 85 sorry yeah um and he but it's still very impressive because he doesn't look like that at all like when you see him you don't think oh yeah that's a very strong he gave listen this guy last time i saw him was 2018 and in 2018 he was first place in moldova second was bojidas
SPEAKER_04: Third was Plamen Dimitrov. Fourth was Krasovskis. And fifth was Irakli Zirakashvili. So Maier was incredible when he stopped pulling. And later, when he was, at that time he stopped because he didn't see a future with arm wrestling, is what he said. But now he's coming back because he sees a future. And I think he gave a very tough match to Samushia.
SPEAKER_04: Very tough match. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. And now, Aydar Khan. We saw Aydar Khan is flashing Vala. He's losing one round. And then last, next three rounds, he flashed him. And Vala gave big problems to Samushia in their world title match. Two Georgi pulled. First round, Vala won. And now, we will have Aydar Khan, who is the current WAC champion in 80 kilo also. So...
SPEAKER_02: Any opinion about this match from you guys? I'd be super impressed by, even more impressed by Samushia if he defends his title once again. I'm also very impressed by the fact that he doesn't seem to get injured or anything. You keep throwing these great pullers at him and he just beats them and goes on with his training. And three months later, you give him another opponent and he just beats that one again. So I'm very impressed by that. I think he will also win this one.
SPEAKER_01: Another another prediction.
SPEAKER_01: I love the idea of having like an undefeated champion at East versus West. So I am on Team Samushia until the day he dies. I want him to get 15, 20, 30 matches in a row. I want him to just keep winning. That being said... You'll be on his side until he loses. Until Angan fights it. Until Angan shows him who the pro-nation king is, you know? Corporal him. If...
SPEAKER_04: Taking his wrist is going to give me the win. Trust me, I'm the winner. But it's not enough. When you are taking the wrist, you also need to control his pronator. You're telling him your tricks, Enka. You're telling him your tricks. And you need to do this four times. The guy is...
SPEAKER_01: uh big problem yeah i mean he's kind of like john where like literally he he can go into a hook he can top roll you he can press like it's like there's no there's no hole in his game and him they were in hook
SPEAKER_04: And one point, Vladimir top-rolled him. We were like, oh, yeah, he's top-rolling. And then Samushia beat him. Yeah, with the deadlifts. Because Meyer was in better position when he was controlling Samushia's pronator. Once he stopped putting pressure there, and then he went there, now Samushia had no pressure on his pronator, so he was able to put more pressure.
SPEAKER_04: So taking the risk is not always the solution. That's why Ermes didn't try to top roll Jerry, but he just went through his grenade. And that match was incredible. Yes. Georgi Tsvetkov versus Alex Kurdecha. Ismail? Ismail, get him off, my friend. Get him off. I'm for Alex. He will take the win, I think. Alex?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I see Alex winning here, but it will be a close match, I would say. They will be maybe, but I don't see Alex taking Georgi's wrist, but they will stay, I think, center and towards the pad. So they will stay more flat wrist, I would say.
SPEAKER_04: so they both will go outside but their wrist will remain straight and then he will go with the side pressure i would say so or press maybe oh okay okay maybe he will surprise with a press let's see who are you supporting in this match is my supporting yeah alex alex is for okay yeah anyone else mike there's a big match
SPEAKER_04: I'm going to go with Georgi on this one. You know, we know that Kurdecha has the press. He used it against Morozov very effectively on the left. So that was very impressive. But Georgi's wrist is ironclad. I mean, I don't think he'll lose it. And I think he'll just be able to go through. It'll be a tough match. I don't think it'll be a dominant victory. But I do think Georgi will ultimately take this probably like three to two.
SPEAKER_04: 3-1 maybe. Is it best of five? Best of five, right? 3-1. I don't think either guy is really going to have a big advantage on the conditioning. Neither is big on cardio, but I do think they're similar in terms of their endurance. And Georgi, I just feel, has a bit more of an advantage with his hand strength. Is your son around you?
SPEAKER_04: He's actually, he's at home. I'm not home right now. He'll be at the event though. Okay, if he was at home, I would just say that maybe we would also ask him what he thinks. But we will meet him in Istanbul. Yeah, it will be great. It will be great memory that you are bringing 15 years old son to Istanbul together. It will be probably unforgettable. Yeah, that's great. That's great.
SPEAKER_00: and he wants to meet the legend known as engen terzi the legend he wants to meet england oh there there are there are much bigger guys yeah yeah anyways so you guys georgie or kurdesha yeah i uh i made a little video on my channel about this one just a little quick video and i i think that um i just think georgie's got too much hand he he's
SPEAKER_00: He's probably improved as much as anyone in the last year from what I see. I think that he just keeps improving, keeps getting better. He's lost weight. He looks like he's in better shape if you look at him compared to where he was in the Jerry match and even matches before that.
SPEAKER_00: He looked a lot thicker, a lot bigger, but now he looks leaner. He looks like he's in better shape. His hand is rock iron solid. I think he's got too much hand. I think it's going to be 3-0. Alex is ‚Äì I just don't think he's going to be able to access anywhere. I think Georgi's going to take center, and Alex is going to be playing defense the entire time. I got 3-0 Georgi.
SPEAKER_02: I may have developed a little gambling addiction here when it comes to arm wrestling. So I have a friend of mine and we always bet on almost all the matches. And oftentimes I don't choose the better option, but I just choose the one who I would love to see win more. I would love to have a better story.
SPEAKER_02: uh and here I put money on Alex because I'd love to see him win I would just love this because I think he has more moves uh he has more tools in his in his toolbox than Georgi I think and that would be like I kind of see Alex more as the athlete and I would like to see him win like I don't know if that makes sense just I would love to see him win okay all right
SPEAKER_01: um this match like if credential if you told me right now credential doesn't have a press i would say this is like 90 to 10 uh georgie's gonna win because georgie and devin just had a match where devin was like peaked out ready for dennis and devin at the end is going like i could do nothing with your hand he's doing this the whole time like just like slowly no no it was long before long before dennis mesh
SPEAKER_01: no the right-handed georgie match that was after the dennis match no no no i thought you were talking about alex and alex and devin no no no so devin and georgie like he couldn't take it yeah yeah so he was like tip-top shape um and he wasn't even close he said at the end of the match he said in his words he goes i could do nothing with your hand right so if alex top rolls georgie
SPEAKER_01: like we had we could have you know the next levon challenger in my opinion uh because if he can top roll georgie when devin couldn't that means that that is a freakishly strong hand um but what i think will happen is i think very quickly he's going to lose his wrist
SPEAKER_01: um but i think there's a good chance he'll have press right against the morozov we saw him he could do hook he could press he could talk about that that was left arm but it was left arm which is which is the big caveat so um if he can do all of that on the right arm
SPEAKER_01: this is going to be such a terrific match. If he can, this is going to be a one-sided win for Georgi. But I'm going to hope that he can because I want to see a good match. But I would say Georgi's probably the favorite, maybe 60%. But yeah, I mean, if I could sit down and talk to Kurdecha and ask him what things he has, I could get a much better idea. But he's just such a mystery right now, you know? Okay. Let's go. Mike.
SPEAKER_04: Ermes Gasparini vs. Ali Canmurado. Left hand. I mean, left handed, you know, Muratov is an absolute beast and his performance against Prudnik was literally unbelievable. So very hard for me to see him losing. And we haven't seen I think the last time we saw Ermes on the left was
SPEAKER_04: when he pulled against Chafee earlier and then he pulled against Morozov later on in the event, left-handed. So maybe he was drained a little bit and he held his own. He looked pretty good on the left, but I just can't see Morozov losing. Yeah, I mean, Alizhan is just, I think he's just too good on the left. And I love Ermes and he's a powerhouse as well, but I just can't see Morozov losing this.
SPEAKER_04: I think it's going to be a war. It's not going to be easy like against Prudnik, but I'm going to go with Alizhan on this one. Okay. Do you time to time talk with your son? Is your son a fan of Armwrestling like you or he's just joining you?
SPEAKER_04: No, he's a fan. He's a fan. I'm trying to get him to do some. It's hard to find tournaments and stuff in Canada and Toronto. There's not that much. And it would be nice to see the sport grow and have a bit more. Who is his favorite armwrestler? Devon? Well, of course, Devon. I mean, we're fellow Canadians. We have to support our fellow Canadians. So it's Devon. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: But do you time to time talk with him about the matches that you guys come in to watch? Do you have any prediction together? Yeah, I mean, he's a bit nervous. I mean, I remember, you know, before the Ermes match, he was nervous. He was nervous before the Dennis match. And we all know how those ended up. So, yeah, that's good. He's a Devon fan and he's.
SPEAKER_04: yeah undeniably a devin fan you you can call them like they say on the on these um uh message boards devin fanboys we're proud to be devin fanboys call us what you will okay i stand with you mike i stand with you and your son ismail or alijan i see alijan the favorite but it will be very interesting to see on which level mss we've left now
SPEAKER_03: But I think Aljan will take the win. Who do you want to win? Aljan will take the win, but I would like to see Ermes to win. Okay. And how about you guys? I think Aljan is going to kill it.
SPEAKER_02: i think and again uh that might be because i put money on him but um i do think he is the stronger guy here i also i love alejan because he has this um like when i just a small little uh anecdote here when i uh two years ago i was already in istanbul for east versus west uh as a vip and one of the craziest things about the sport is when you see
SPEAKER_02: the athletes live in front of you because they have this freak factor i'm just going to call it a freak factor and it's the most positive meaning of freak that you can imagine but this makes i also like this so much about the sport that you have like dave chafee's hands and they are just as wide as two of my hands and you shake hands you can't grab his hand and stuff like that um and i think alejan is also one of those guys that
SPEAKER_04: When he's done pulling, his left arm is twice the size than his right arm. And I just love that. And I think he's just too strong with the left arm. And I think Ermes is in for some trouble. Yeah. Did you guys watch the podcast? Ermes told him that he's scared. And he said, you are just one of those many billions of people. Why would I be scared? Who are you?
SPEAKER_04: And he said, I will show you who I am at the table when I take your wrist. And Alizhan told him, good boy. And Ermes told him, you too. We will see. Yeah. How about you guys? What do you think about this match? You want to go?
SPEAKER_01: Go ahead, Henry. All right. So I think there's, I only see really two ways this could go. I think it might be a close match where Ermes wins, but I think there's like a 70% chance like Ali's going to look like the Prudnik match, maybe even worse. Like he was, he's just going to absolutely run through him. And there's a 30% chance that army shows up with like a really prepared left arm, which in that case, we could very well like get into war territory.
SPEAKER_01: um but you know it's like it's weird because i i don't really see alex on getting top rolled on the left arm but i also don't see him going against good top rollers on the left arm so it's sort of like he hasn't been challenged with a top roller like ermys before um
SPEAKER_01: But, like, Ermes is showing up to fight Alizhan when Alizhan is coming off the match of his life. You know what I'm saying? I mean, just, like, dismantling, you know, a champion, you know? So it's very difficult to predict this one. But I would say about a 70% chance Alizhan will run through him. And a 30% chance it's like a war where Ermes maybe is close. But I'm leaning towards Alizhan just, like, easy. And you, Skyler?
SPEAKER_00: Well, it basically comes down to Alijon's wrist and side pressure against Ermes's hand and back pressure. Will Ermes's hand hold up to his wrist? I mean, if Ermes's can take his wrist, then we got ourselves a match. But if Ermes's is in that spot like he got into with Morozov, where he just gets turned palm up and he can't take his wrist, then we don't even have a match. Alijon will just run right through him.
SPEAKER_00: but um there is that small percentage that that that uh armies could get the hand and we could we could see something you know armies is what 25 kgs heavier am i right about that around around yeah he told me he would be at 130 you said yeah and he's 104 kilos that's what he said
SPEAKER_00: Which I know that doesn't make a huge difference because we've seen Alijon beat Cody Merritt, and Cody Merritt's bigger than Ermes. But Cody Merritt's definitely not an Ermes's, in my opinion. So I don't know. We could see a very close match. I got it 55-45, Alijon. Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_04: Okay, I think we missed a match. We didn't talk about Kamil versus Tobias. We didn't. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, let's go. See, everybody keeps looking over that one. Let's go. Who's going first?
SPEAKER_01: All right, I'll go. So if Camille can get in his position like on the press, I actually don't think anyone in the world can actually stop Camille's press. Like maybe Morozov, maybe Vitaly, but it takes a really strong arm to stop Camille's press.
SPEAKER_01: It's just, can he get there, right? Against Ivan Matyshenko, we saw, because he went up against the fast guy, he never even got his position. So he got, you know, flashpinned three times, right? It looked like he wasn't even there. He just kept false starting, you know? So...
SPEAKER_01: If Tobias is fast enough to get him off center, I could see Tobias just running through him. I could also see him being too slow and getting just run through by Camille. I actually think it hurts me to say this, but I think there's a very real chance of an arm break here if commit because it's the it's the combination of styles of a heavy side pressure guy next to a guy who's only going to go in for a press.
SPEAKER_01: Um, so if like Camille really commits and he's just like, I am going to press. And if he just goes in there, um, I could see, I could see a break happening or at least him, you know, maybe pop an elbow or something. Uh, I hope, you know, obviously I hope it doesn't happen, but, uh, I think if Camille ever gets on the B side, he just loses immediately.
SPEAKER_01: because he would be holding like this and there's just no chance of him surviving that. But if he can get into his position, he can win. But I would say Tobias maybe 70%. I think he'll probably be fast enough to be getting Camille off center. But if he makes some mistakes and Camille is fast, Camille could run through him. Okay. Anyone else?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, so the way that I see this match is even though Matashenko ran through Camille the way he did, that was also on the right hand. But it's going to Tobias is going to be going a completely different way. So it's definitely going to go to the straps. And I think the straps are definitely going to favor Camille when it comes to.
SPEAKER_00: The press that he has and and you know, just like Henry said, it just all boils down to if Tobias is fast enough to get him outside of his shoulder. If you can get him outside of his shoulder, then obviously he's probably going to beat him. But man, you get Camille in that strap and he gets committed with his shoulder behind it with that left arm. He's very dangerous. I mean, we saw what he did to Devon. You know, I mean he just basically destroyed him and I mean I know it's Devon's left, but Devon's left is still no joke. You know, I mean it's still legitimate.
SPEAKER_00: And he destroyed him. So Tobias is going to have to be very quick, very strong, very explosive. If he's not, then...
SPEAKER_00: he he will lose but I I the way I see the matches is is 50 50. I think it's a 50 50 match I really do because the bias is looking very well you know I have a hard time um like um seeing where uh Tobias is he's like a wild card to me I can never really assess his his power like um
SPEAKER_02: i wouldn't be surprised if he he can win but i'm also i'm how do you guys see this i'm not a big fan of camille pressing all the time to me i see this a little bit like like with the monster michael todd king's move kind of thing when all he did was kings moving and he became very unpopular uh and you would always vote this is what like how i felt but i'd always vote for the person uh on on um at the other person and michael's table to beat him
SPEAKER_02: because i wanted to see somebody beat michael i wanted to see them beat the king's move uh i feel like the same could happen maybe with camille because all he does is just press all the time it's not very entertaining as a match because it's over very fast it's just this one move i don't really like it as an as a fan you know um do you think this could also make him be unpopular in the sport that people are just waiting for somebody to stop the press
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, but I mean, the press, many people can stop the press. Also, press is not always quick. Remember, Jerry versus Gennady match was a long one. And Jerry versus John Brzee, I remember many wars, many wars. Also, Jerry versus Georgi Swetko match was, I thought it took three years to end, you know. I was like, really, I was like, you know, yeah. So it is not always boring. It's a different challenge.
SPEAKER_04: And as every technique has some like borders, like you do hook or something, your shoulder cannot touch to your or opponent's hand. When you do the open arm top roll, it needs to stay above the table level. It cannot go like this. And then when you do the shoulder pressure, as long as it doesn't cross the center. So, I mean, everything is okay. I mean, I don't like this style either, but I cannot take anything away from there. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Any addition, Ismail? Nothing more to add. I think Tobias will win this match because he's very explosive. So I think he will take it. And you, Mike?
SPEAKER_04: Just real quick, so I thought that just in reading some of the commentary, it's hard to tell from looking at, depends on what angle you're looking at, but the Camille versus Devon match, I did feel like the starting position, the shoulders didn't seem to be squared.
SPEAKER_04: And I thought maybe that's what allowed him to get to that press so quickly. I'm not sure if the reffing was maybe different than what we're going to see at East versus West 12. But I mean, do you agree with that, Ingen? You saw that match too. Did you feel like they may be? I don't know about that, but I kind of think that there was no way they want to win that match. I think you need like that. I don't think that they want with left arm has the tools as of now.
SPEAKER_04: He goes with part of the arm. He doesn't really focus on that. I don't think that he could beat Kamil. But to beat Kamil, you need to... My understanding of beating, that kind of shoulder pressure... See, now, where is my... I explained this many times. Where is my tricep working to win inside, right? See? Yeah. How about...
SPEAKER_04: When the match start, if the guy turns you this way, where is your tricep working now? Winning position or losing? If you wanted to open your tricep, you know, anything that you open your arm is a tricep move. So when your pronator is turned this way, your palm is up, you can now use your tricep in winning position. You can only, if it was a cable, the tricep now would be working this way. You know, you hold the handle and you do tricep. But whenever it is like,
SPEAKER_04: this, now you're working that way. So controlling that, that's how Ivan Matushenko did it. He just turned him in so quick. So he was, he was here. So, and then not only he was like this, but his hand was put behind his shoulder. So he couldn't put any joint pressure. So when, when Devon is pulling
SPEAKER_04: This way, I don't think Devon has super side pressure with left arm. So he's pulling that way. It is exactly what Kamil wants to catch you on your brachioradialis. And it is not super strong because you are taking the risk, but you are not actually doing anything to the angle of the shoulder pressure. You don't do anything.
SPEAKER_04: To eliminate here, people try to get away. The more you get away, the more you are squeezed. But you need to enable here. What is the pressure coming? The pressure is coming from the body weight and shoulder.
SPEAKER_04: But once you took here, that the shoulder is now not supporting your hand because your hand is away now. You are just, what can you press like this? So you need to, instead of taking this risk, you need to focus on making them palm up, you know, facing up. Yeah. Anyways. I was also going to say, I actually very much so agree with what Mike said about how at arm wars, like,
SPEAKER_01: I'm not one to complain about refereeing, but they were not squaring the shoulders before these matches. They were letting Camille start like this. And they were letting Devon do the same thing, but Devon doesn't capitalize on the same way Camille does. So I still think Camille had him that day, but it definitely made it a lot harder for Devon to win because Camille didn't need to earn the press. He was just giving it at the start. I still think he would have won, but it definitely made it like...
SPEAKER_04: zero percent chance i mean if they pulled 500 rounds camille would have won everyone it wasn't even close so yeah right yeah mike anything you want to add on this one no no that that was that was it i i thought your analysis on beating that press was very very good so thanks for that indian yeah okay let's come to the main subject who wants to go first
SPEAKER_02: Nobody? Okay. I'm happy to take you first since I'm a Devon fanboy. Devon! Maybe Benny's heard it. Benny's got the shirt. Why don't you go ahead, Benny? I have a whole collection of shirts about... If only I could... Give me a second. Somebody else starts. I can still hear you. Let me... Just a second. All right, I'll start. It's... Okay, well... We all know...
SPEAKER_00: who LaVon is. We're all well aware. After the wrist injury, and Ingen, I know you have more insight about this than anybody because I know you were just with him. I shared everything I know. The only thing I wanted not to show was that 80.5 kilo, the pronator, but I also shared that one.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, that's ‚Äì yeah, so we all know that he's still in incredible shape. But I just think this is ‚Äì this is in Devon's legacy. I just think that this is his time, and I think he's going to be the one ‚Äì if there's anybody in the world that's going to get it done, I think he's the guy to do it right now. I really do. And ‚Äì
SPEAKER_00: I agree 100% with what Devon said. If he's either going to win the match, he's either going to get the stop and win the match, or he's going to get injured again. That's 100% what I believe, and I'm sure he believes that as well. Because as strong as he is right now, if LeVon's able to just power right through him again, then I couldn't see Devon not sustaining an injury. But I do see a 4-2 victory.
SPEAKER_00: For Devon and I I think by round three he gets to stop. That's what I think. I think the first two rounds of on is going to take it, but this is this is different. This is different than King of the Table. Because King of the Table they went straight to the straps. You know Devon didn't have any time to touch his hand to manipulate to make him put any pressure anywhere. He didn't have any time to do any of that and.
SPEAKER_00: Under East vs. West rules, you do have some time. And that's why another reason I think Devon said that East vs. West rules benefit into his favor. And I think he's right about that because not going straight to the straps I think is definitely going to benefit him. We know who... At that time, that was what Devon wanted. In fact, Levan didn't want that. Because if you remember, right before that match, there was Dave Sheffield match and Dave couldn't go strap even once. And
SPEAKER_00: So is there any possibility LeBron to not let him go strapped? The way Devon talks is, you know, LeBron is going to have to be something extra incredible to keep him from slipping, which I agree with that. But then again, we have seen LeBron clamp down on people and not let him slip. So look, if LeBron pins Devon in the first round outside of the strapped,
SPEAKER_00: then we're going to know right there that, okay, this is going to be a repeat of the first time. Because if Devon can't even get to the straps, then we don't even have a match. We already know that. I don't see that happening. I think that Devon is not going to have any problems getting to the strap. And like I said, the more and more times he's able to each ready go, whether he fouls or whatever happens,
SPEAKER_00: the more and more load that's going into those fingers and into that wrist i mean i just think eventually he's going to crack his wrist and once he crack his cracks his wrist one time that's all it's going to take i mean everybody knows this everybody knows that this is all it takes and and if he does it he's going to win the match that's the fact okay that's my opinion okay who's next
SPEAKER_04: I'll jump in. I actually have the same prediction as Skyler. So Skyler, beautiful analysis. I like the details there. 4-2 is what I'm going to call for Devon. And what I really find very, very interesting is that the last couple super matches, well, maybe not the Georgi match, but going into the Ermes match, all we heard about was Devon can't hold center. He's going to get just...
SPEAKER_04: flash pin by Ermes. Ermes is way stronger. None of that happened. Same thing against Dennis. Everyone loves to dismiss Devon's power and how much Devon has actually evolved over the past, call it, two years. And that's what I think people maybe just sort of dismiss. And it doesn't make sense to me. So everyone knows how powerful LeVon is. He is the pinnacle of power in this sport.
SPEAKER_04: I don't think he's going to pin Devon four times, and I certainly don't think he's going to be able to do it the same way that happened last time because we all know about the injury. Devon does not make excuses. He tore a bicep in round two, didn't even flinch, said nothing, continued on. He's a warrior, and I do think he's going to get that stop. Maybe it takes a couple rounds.
SPEAKER_04: inevitably going to happen because Devon is significantly ahead of where he was a couple years ago. I can't say the same for Lavon, even though he will come in probably in a similar level that he was a couple years ago. And I just don't think it's going to be enough to take Devon down four times flash pin. I can't see it happening. I think Devon's worked too hard for this.
SPEAKER_04: And he's got every tool in the toolkit to make adjustments. So it'll be very different than the Ernie's stop. Once Devon stops him, it will look very, very different. He's going to have his way. So I'm going to go with Devon for two on this one. Okay, always nice.
SPEAKER_02: yeah i don't i don't have to add that much it's all i have to show here this okay and so it's not it's not levon is the limit it's no limits yeah exactly and uh engen you should get the oxygen tanks ready for levon i think he's going to need a couple of those um that saturday so yeah uh i can only agree with what skyler and mike said on this i'll be out that's very very surprising you know if you would if you didn't like see anything
SPEAKER_04: since last time they pulled in last two years, you didn't witness anything else, but just saw their first match. And then suddenly tell someone that, you know, that person that just listened to this podcast and they would just say that you guys are out of your mind, you know? Like, yeah. But since that time to today, like Devon really progressed a lot. I really don't know what is because I remember
SPEAKER_04: When I said Devon versus Ermes match, I repeated this, but people said, Ermes is going to kill him. Whenever I said, listen, this guy has leverage, you know, this and that, you know, I explained, and there is a possibility. Devon't be so sure. They said, you're trying to sell pay-per-view, this and that. And then it didn't go as they expected because they were thinking about bicep size, this, where the key point was totally different. So now I say, I don't say,
SPEAKER_04: like you guys, but I don't see huge gap between those two. And they tell me the same thing. They say, you are trying to sell the pay-per-view, you're trying to make it look exciting. But I mean, that Devon today is different, different. I don't know how close they are now, but for sure closer than last time. And when you say closer, like when you talk about Devon,
SPEAKER_04: I mean, just you're talking about one good stop. And then, and then things are just suddenly changing. You know, the guy, I mean, your guest record had six better starts, six better starts, but wasn't enough. Once you can't be, then the guy is just like, it doesn't get out, you know, except the other match in Ghana, the match, he.
SPEAKER_04: had to go inside I don't think his endurance inside endurance was as good as his outside endurance because I mean last some years you saw Devon probably two percent inside 98 outside where whenever he went outside again is that the heat was kind of no good for him so he had to pull inside so his endurance wasn't that good okay who is next now
SPEAKER_03: um i guess i'll do you want ismail to go and i can go yeah it's mine yeah i can't i i cannot agree more uh agree more with uh skylar and um mike i think devin will win this match it will be close uh because yeah devin is had evolved much not only he is stronger he's old also healthier than previous last two years the stem cells are working
SPEAKER_03: so um yeah this time it will be close and not so maybe four or two or four three so can it can be that level Levan takes three matches but it will it will be a stopping at two or round three
SPEAKER_04: Okay, Petro is saying that Engin, come on, they are all fanatic Devon fans. He hasn't heard my prediction yet. This is a joke, he said. My friend, these are the VIP sponsors of the event. And I wanted to do podcast with them. Actually, I don't know who is Devon fan. I don't know exactly who is Devon fan.
SPEAKER_04: But when you judge by the fan base, I mean, I am not surprised that Devon has more fans who care to come to Istanbul and watch this as a VIP. Just my opinion. But just remember, there are some others, even some elite players, who think that Devon is favorite. Just two days ago,
SPEAKER_04: or three days ago, I don't remember, both Tobias and Kamil, they said that they think that Devon is favourite. So I don't think that this is because they are fanatic Devon fans. So people may have different opinions. But let's see. Go, Henry.
SPEAKER_01: okay so i guess i'll make everyone in the in the uh in the chat happy um i could talk for like 30 minutes but i'll try to just sum it up in like a minute so against georgie devin didn't didn't do anything to georgie's wrist the whole time georgie like this right um and georgie's arm i don't believe is very strong i think georgie has a pretty weak arm but he just has such a strong wrist that he's able to win anyways he's not really a pretty weak arm
SPEAKER_01: Well, relative to Levan. Your arm may open, but he was able to also hold a match. Yeah, compared to Levan, maybe not as much. Point is, I believe Levan's wrist is stronger than Georgi's, which makes it so that way there is no world where Devon will be able to take Levan's wrist.
SPEAKER_01: So assuming that that is true, I believe LaVon has a stronger side pressure. And I also think he will have better endurance because in his match against Ermes, the ventilation at the venue, he had health problems and he was not able to cut weight. He was trying to cut those three things made his endurance much worse than it was supposed to be.
SPEAKER_01: if those three things didn't happen against Ermes I believe that would have been a six zero um he'd also said that he could have continued uh fighting those next rounds although I believe he would have lost he just didn't want to leave the match in a stretcher he said so he was like he didn't want it to look bad on TV I've watched every interview so basically I believe that because the Vaughn won't lose his wrist um
SPEAKER_01: I believe it's going to be 6-0, just like last time. He's got too much side pressure in comparison to Georgi. And Georgi got him like this far from the pad. So you are saying that Devon is going to win 6-0? Devon 6-0, pretty much like last time. There may be a little more stopping here because, I mean, last time Devon tore his biceps. It wasn't really the match it was supposed to be.
SPEAKER_01: um but yeah devin on his member only live said he's only 10 stronger than he was last time and i firmly believe that that's probably true um and yeah he just can't take devin's or he can't take lavon's wrist lavon can't take his either so it's going to be flat wrist like this uh and then lavon's side pressure is just way way way too much so he he won't lose his wrist he'll just drive straight to the side six times in a row and if it ever does get stopped i think he'll go in for a press he's training a press
SPEAKER_01: No chance. Henry, do you want to bet on it? I won't say how much money. I have a lot of money already bet on this outcome. I see. So I'll eat my words if I'm wrong, but I don't want to put more chips on the table. Henry, it looks like you will be minority.
SPEAKER_01: this vip group yeah the chat the chat seems to be very pissed that we're you know a devin fan meetup or whatever but uh you know you know we're all here to watch the match and if we knew what would happen we wouldn't be watching so we all don't know you know we're just fans right so yeah i think those two days from thursday to saturday you guys will be
SPEAKER_01: discussing about this all the time. Maybe me and you can come to an agreement, Benny. I may put a little more cash on it. Maybe I meet Devon and I'm like, holy shit. We'll see. I want in on that too, Henry. I want in on that too. Okay, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: i'm uh you know i don't know how many more chips i want to put on the table because i have a lot with some i have some private bets i have some money on arm bet uh but uh yeah i'm i'm fairly confident in my prediction and i've like obsessed about this for like the last four months so yeah most gamblers will say before they can uh get the jackpot right okay okay okay i'm against gambling
SPEAKER_04: You guys are free to do whatever you want, of course, but just do it privately, please. Yeah, I understand. I understand. Yeah. Guys, thank you very, very much. I really enjoyed spending like we are like in 15 minutes, it was going to be two hours. And it was like, because we spent time with something that we really are obsessed. And thank you very much to all of you. And see you in what?
SPEAKER_04: Three weeks? No, less than two and a half weeks. Two and a half, two and a little bit. Yeah. About 15 days. 19 days. I'll be there on the 11th of April, so I'll be there very early. Okay. Yeah, where are you going to stay?
SPEAKER_01: I think we're going to stay at the same hotel the whole time. I didn't want you booking the hotel because my dad was having health issues, but everything's fine. I also just want to say, Engen, it is very amazing seeing your childlike love for arm wrestling. Every time the camera is on you during these matches, you're like a kid watching your favorite superheroes.
SPEAKER_01: So I just wanted to say, you know, thank you for from all of us for not just being a promoter, but like you are a fan. You're a fan and then a promoter. You know what I'm saying? I mean, I'm a promoter because someone had to do this. Yeah. But you're so much of a fan. You're like, I have to be a promoter because I got to see these matches, you know? Yeah. I also feel so responsible. Trust me. I want to set like 30 matches. I want to set many matches. Many people said they need a match for me. And trust me,
SPEAKER_04: to say no to them, most of them are much younger than me. Some of them are young enough to be my son. And to say, to be like, I'm not able to set some of the matches, like it is just like so hard, so hard to say, sorry, I can't. And like, trust me, I feel guilty. Like I wish arm wrestling was much bigger and I could do much more events.
SPEAKER_04: understand but right now this is i i feel it from the paper numbers i feel like this is the right now the capacity if you do more maybe there will not be enough interest and if i am not successful financially i cannot continue so i i cannot i can only go as much as you know i can you understand but hopefully it will go like last two years if you realize last year there was five east versus west and this year again with the north american event
SPEAKER_04: There are five East versus West. So maybe there will be more. I want to make it international. If I find opportunity, some just say, like some people can say, let's do it here. We have the, here we have sponsors, let's do in this country, let's do in that country. We can do it because I want to do it all over the world.
SPEAKER_01: Uh-huh. Yeah. And also, like, we know that you don't care about the money because if you cared about the money, this would be Devon and LeVon and nobody else, you know, and you would sell 80% of them. But you want to grow the sport, which is why there's all these matches, you know, because, you know, you're setting matches. People don't know who these guys are, but they're legendary athletes, so you think they deserve to be here because you believe in them, you know? It's not because they're going to, you know, no one's buying the pay-per-view because of some of these matches. They're buying it for, like, the top five, you know?
SPEAKER_01: so you could lose no sales and have five matches like king of the table but you're like someone needs to be cultivating the next generation so you take that upon yourself financially to help you know arm wrestling as a sport so that's that's yeah i mean but just think about it is it is also an investment because now whenever i said these guys like you see who is this guy
SPEAKER_04: But whenever he uses the chance very well on this stage, next time you are like, oh, this guy is also there. You understand? So more and more people are becoming famous as they deserve. But it is totally up to them to also promote themselves. I'm not going to give a name, but some guys, they don't really promote. They don't promote the event. They don't promote themselves. I can. I can do to a certain point. They need to use this opportunity.
SPEAKER_04: and touch to the fans directly. Yeah, they need to share their trainings, they need to share some of their tasks, they don't have to be fake. People want to know them as they are. Because we all have unique personality. Even in this podcast, we are six, we all have different different personality, we all have our own, you know, ways, you know, saying, like, not everyone likes
SPEAKER_04: Not everyone likes Devon. Devon is the most friend, but Devon has almost as much as Hayter as the fans. So what I'm just saying, some likes that way, some likes the other guy, some likes white guys, some likes, you know, dry-talking. We just need to be ourselves, but people need to know who you are.
SPEAKER_04: first of all anyways guys so it has been before before we go so sorry one thing so if i take levon and devin and i combine them maybe i get close to one arm wrestler called the enigma of rage so if you could just show us the arm just one time just show us the arm we got to see it do you want me to show you the enigma of rage that's right i haven't been nobody's even close to that
SPEAKER_04: it's just small right now but i i don't know how but if that's small i would love to be small that's what i wanted to say take care of yourself and see you in istanbul thank you for your support and thank you for having me thank you
