SPEAKER_00: um okay guys we are live here from uh east versus west channel uh today uh i'm joined by number one contender no dollar tyder khan uh margin shamil will help me translate uh
SPEAKER_00: roman is there fixing technical problems uh roman gantanadze will help us with translation from david samushia i want to welcome everyone here so while we wait for samushia i'll ask um so how do you feel how was the preparation where is the mind
SPEAKER_00: Just how ready are you? Nur Davlet, how do you feel? How was the preparation? Where, how to say, physically, mentally, how do you feel 2-3 weeks before the competition in Poland? Everything is fine. Everything is fine. Everything is fine. Everything is fine. Everything is fine. Everything is fine. Everything is fine. Everything is fine. Everything is fine.
SPEAKER_02: I have a good preparation. Everything is fine now. At the moment, I am setting up all the settings to make the speed.
SPEAKER_02: I work a lot for speed. Everything is fine, no injuries. Everything is fine.
SPEAKER_00: so he said training has been very good he feels very well there's no injuries uh no trauma no nothing uh the thing that he's really focusing on right now is the speed um and that is that is what he's preparing for um i'll ask him what does he feel about four rounds because four rounds might not be about the speed it might be about strength and endurance um
SPEAKER_00: In order to win a championship, to become a champion, you have to win four rounds. There may be more speed at the beginning, and then endurance and strength. And we see that Davit is a very good
SPEAKER_00: If the match goes on for a long time, how to say, third, fourth round, he already takes control, there is already a good one. Was there any preparation for this? Or the strategy is just to finish everything quickly, every round and that's it? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
SPEAKER_02: Yes.
SPEAKER_02: He knows how to prepare for the match and how to prepare for the start. He knows how to prepare for all situations.
SPEAKER_00: okay um so he's saying that uh he knows what kind of opponent david samushi is he knows what kind of match it is he's trying his best to prepare for every single outcome uh no i'll ask if the main strategy is still the speed no it's
SPEAKER_02: I don't know if I will be able to do it in the future. I don't know if I will be able to do it in the future. I don't know if I will do it in the future.
SPEAKER_02: He said, of course, I don't know where the match is going to take me. Of course, I want to win fast.
SPEAKER_00: But you never know how it ends, but I'm coming for the victory. Roman, is everything okay? Can you hear me? Nothing. You can hear me, yeah? Okay, translating will be very good. Is Samushia coming?
SPEAKER_00: because i know georgians are always late so i'll i'll call roman i said get georgians up we need to do interviews and they're three hours later coming up all team they're like yeah i got everyone so yeah
SPEAKER_00: I want to ask how impressive is the win streak of Samushia? How impressive is the winning streak of Samushia? Because he won 80 matches.
SPEAKER_02: How do you look at this? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
SPEAKER_02: He is a very strong opponent. When athletes fight with him, we think maybe his opponent will beat him.
SPEAKER_02: We've been watching him all the time. He's won eight times already. That's a good motivation for us. And Nurdoglu wants to break that... The winning streak. Yes, the winning streak. He wants to become a new champion. 85 kilos.
SPEAKER_00: So he said, of course, when you look at Samushia and you look at some of his opponents, sometimes you think like these guys are going to beat him. Like these guys are strong enough. They can beat him. They can take him. But he keeps on winning, which is a great motivation for Nur Davlet and everyone else, he thinks. But of course, he wants to be the first guy to break this streak. And that's the biggest motivation for him.
SPEAKER_00: um okay let's see if romance audio is working yes i i hear something yes yeah sorry guys sorry it took me time yeah how are you doing i'm doing good i'm doing good
SPEAKER_00: and i asked you again even though you didn't hear me how about you are you doing well doing good you look good yeah always in shape the the commenter comment i got was uh egg it's hair transplant really works he looks great um okay um
SPEAKER_00: Is Samushia coming? I messaged him, yeah, he's coming. He has just technical issues as well. I fixed his plan, I will fix his. Okay, I'll talk a little bit with Nur Nurdaulet and then we'll get to Samushia. I have some little more. I want to ask, because he's a many-time world champion, I think he has won five classes, only one who has won five classes. What is his ultimate goal? Nur Nurdaulet, you are a world champion many times, right?
SPEAKER_00: You won many categories many times. You are one of the best. What is your goal? How do you want the world of armwrestling to remember you? You understand what I mean, right? I don't know how to say it.
SPEAKER_02: I think he was born in 1911. I think he was born in 1911. I think he was born in 1911. I think he was born in 1911. I think he was born in 1911.
SPEAKER_02: He says that he wants to become a legend of this sport. I also want to become a legend of this sport. I want to make a good story.
SPEAKER_00: so um he said he wants to at the end become a legend of our sport as some of the people are right now he wants to be remembered as one um if i'm correct he has won five
SPEAKER_00: 5 different he's been world champion in five different weight classes uh uh
SPEAKER_02: How is your weight now? Do you have to lose up to 85 kg? Or can you eat more? How do you feel? He is now 90 kg. And he is going to lose 5 kg.
SPEAKER_00: I asked Nurdaulet how big is he? Does he have to cut weight or anything? And he said right now he's 90 kilos. He has to cut 5 kilos and that's how we're going to show up to the match.
SPEAKER_00: You've never been... Is it the biggest you've ever been, 90 kilos? Or was it even bigger? 90 kilos, is it the biggest you've ever been? He's never been 90 kilos. It's the first time in my life I've been in such a category.
SPEAKER_00: uh he said first time in his life he's 90 kilos he's never been bigger and uh this is pretty much the biggest he is Roman do you have some questions you want to ask
SPEAKER_04: Well, I was planning to tell you some things before Samushia would join because I talked with him and he also had some questions with his opponent. But like 10 seconds ago or so, we just called. So he already has the link and he's about to join. So we can actually skip my questions and start with Samushia. He's joining right now. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Did he ask a question or what? No, no, no, no. I just asked. He said that he was confused. Hi, Davit. Hi. We can't hear you. We can't hear you.
SPEAKER_01: How does the champion feel? First, how does the champion feel? First, how does the champion feel?
SPEAKER_04: He's feeling good, he's feeling healthy, he's feeling fit and ready. Right now he's at the gym, by the way, and he just finished his workout and yeah. So I want to ask you, Nur Nurdaulet is the biggest he has ever been. He's 90 kilos, he will cut five kilos. Is that giving him some worry about it? How big is Davit right now? Davit, Ramteni kilo Kharueh, Lajeres with Kharim.
SPEAKER_01: Thank you very much.
SPEAKER_04: right now david is actually 90 uh 89 almost 90 kilo so he looks pretty uh massive and uh ready for the fight and uh sorry uh ray uh what was the first part of the question uh what would technically be uh intimidating for david yeah yeah because nur daulat is 90 he's never been 90 kilos before oh oh yeah so yeah he's also got some weight just to get to 85.
SPEAKER_04: OK, OK. Yeah, I just translated, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: So Dawid is saying, like he's greeting to you, Ray, and he's saying hello also and greets to his opponents. He's just happy to be here. He's not intimidated, but he just said that to say hello to you guys. I'll translate in Russian.
SPEAKER_00: Davit, this will be your ninth title defense, if I'm correct? Ninth title match? Yes. Is Nur Daulat...
SPEAKER_00: based on the last match he had with Lala does that give him some worry that he might be really tough opponent especially for his style
SPEAKER_04: Davit, your opponent, Nurdaulet, is from Wallachia. How did you manage to get out of that situation? How did you manage to get out of that situation? How did you manage to get out of that situation?
SPEAKER_01: It's been a long, long time since I've played, but I'm still a great sportsman. No matter what I do, I always say that I'm a great sportsman and I'm a very confident sportsman. I think that the maximum I can say is that
SPEAKER_04: Well, basically, he said that Bala is really strong, Bala is really tough. As you already remarked, he knows by his own experience how strong Bala is. And he said that, yeah, it was really, really
SPEAKER_04: astonishing and surprising how well Nur Dalet handled Vala. And he knows that he must not underestimate his opponent. He said Nur Dalet really beat Vala in a good way for himself.
SPEAKER_04: and david said that he david himself must do like his maximum in order to try to defend his title and beat uh noodle this time yeah he he knows that he has to push his maximum
SPEAKER_00: Okay, I'll translate for them so they understand a little bit of this. Mecgen, I asked Davit what he thinks about Nurdaulet vs. Val, how Nurdaulet defeated Val. And Davit said that he knows how strong Val is. He saw how comfortable
SPEAKER_00: Nur Nurdaulet won it. He takes this match very seriously. He knows the level of Nur Nurdaulet and he never forgets it. What do you think? Of course, yes. Thank you, Mohamed, for giving me this opportunity. Thank you, Mohamed, for giving me this opportunity.
SPEAKER_04: Roman, do you have anything you want to ask any of these guys? Yeah, I wanted to actually ask the kind of same question, but from Nudel's perspective, because he also has experience against Vala and he knows how Dawid performed against Vala. So from that point of view, what does he think that how tough opponent would Dawid be potentially for him? That was my question. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Here is a question from Roman. He wants to know what Nurdoglu thinks about the same thing. He saw the match between Vala and Samushia, how hard it was. And he also had a match with Vala. How does he feel about his own match against Davit? What else will happen?
SPEAKER_02: Do you and Davit have a conversation? Do you and Davit have a conversation? Do you and Davit have a conversation? Do you and Davit have a conversation? Do you and Davit have a conversation? Do you and Davit have a conversation? Do you and Davit have a conversation? Do you and Davit have a conversation? Do you and Davit have a conversation?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I don't think there are many differences between them and Vala. I think they have the same strength, but there is a potential for endurance. He won with endurance. I think he won Vala with endurance.
SPEAKER_02: Tomorrow will show how the situation will turn out, but I think that there is a slight difference in strength between them and Valya.
SPEAKER_00: so um says he thinks david and vala is pretty close in strength uh the reason why david won was that he had more endurance in that match but of course the match that they will have in 20th of april will show but he believes that strength-wise they must be very very similar
SPEAKER_04: I will very quickly also translate what Nur Dalet said to Davit, okay? Davit,
SPEAKER_04: OK.
SPEAKER_01: I think that there is a lot of nuance here, a lot of nuance, it is very clear. I think that there is a lot of nuance here, a lot of nuance, it is very clear. I think that there is a lot of nuance here, a lot of nuance, it is very clear. I think that there is a lot of nuance here, a lot of nuance, it is very clear. I think that there is a lot of nuance here, a lot of nuance, it is very clear.
SPEAKER_01: There were three Erdoneses, and they were in different colors and different nuances. And the nuances were different from each other, and they were different from each other. I was the leader, and Bekhame was my assistant. I was the leader, and Bekhame was my assistant. I was the leader, and Bekhame was my assistant. I was the leader, and Bekhame was my assistant.
SPEAKER_04: So, I find Davit's idea really interesting and I think quite accurate. He said that I listened to what Nurdaulet said, I could technically go along with that, I could understand why he says that strength-wise we could somewhat be equal, but what Davit said was that
SPEAKER_04: well we must not generalize the strength like to oversimplify he meant that strength uh as we say we have to mention a bit more specific like different positions we show ourselves less strong or more strong you know like stronger or weaker in some positions right so he said like all three of us
SPEAKER_04: uh vala and me david said we are equally strong strong wise but in some aspects in some specific positions that actually matters during the match especially on long run like in several rounds
SPEAKER_04: those aspects play a huge role. So some aspects I'm stronger than Vala, some aspects Vala may be stronger than me or than Nurdaulet and so on. So it's like all these different aspects we have over each other. So I can't just say that I disagree with what Nurdaulet said.
SPEAKER_04: like when he says that we are equal in strength because we are not that equal in everything but overall i think we are still somewhat same level extra at strength that's what david said yeah okay i'll i'll
SPEAKER_00: For viewers, I'll make it easier. So it's strength in specific positions. So one can be very like in armwrestling, it's all about can you get where you want to go, right? Either your opponent gets where he wants to go or you go where you want to go. And if your opponent gets where he wants to go and he's really strong there, it looks like you might look like you're weaker one, right? But if he just cannot access that strength,
SPEAKER_00: that's the one and for every arm wrestler is different Vala and noodle sorry Vala and Davit I think are very similar because they both went inside like they both just went inside um Davit just went into Bala's strongest point in my opinion right that's where he went for the match uh no dollar avoided that he didn't go in he did he went the opposite he you know disengaged it pretty fast and that's how arm wrestling works um
SPEAKER_00: For me, it's a big match as a puller close to this weight class. I'm very excited to see two of the great pullers of this era facing each other. I think it's an absolutely great match.
SPEAKER_00: But the card is absolutely stacked. And let's talk about a little bit of the rest of the card. Let's talk a little bit about the rest of the card, East vs. West 12. I'll start with Makhzhan and Noor Dovalet. The last match that was made was Kamil Jablonski vs. Tobias Sporrong.
SPEAKER_00: With your left hand. Who do you think is the favorite in your opinion? I think Tobias Swangen will win. He just won with Daewon. Tobias won with Wagner. Tobias Swangen. Tobias Swangen. He thinks Tobias Swangen will win. Tobias Swangen. Top roll.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, so they're going with Tobias Sporrong. Davit, what do you think? What do you think?
SPEAKER_01: It is a very important issue. If you look at it from the point of view of the government, you will see that it is a very important issue.
SPEAKER_04: so uh he said that uh on on left arm most likely like uh very convincingly uh camel will win he said that uh camel is really strong considering his uh last match against demo larat he showed himself he performed really well and he just expects camille to be uh like convincing winner officer on left hand he specifically said on left
SPEAKER_00: Okay, so we're cut in half already. Very good. Very good start. The next one I'm going to ask, I'm not going to ask who they believe is going to win, but I ask why do they think this guy is going to win? We'll start with Davit. Why does Davit think Yulian Yanni beats Talgat Akhtar?
SPEAKER_04: Davit, I would like to ask you, and I don't know if you will be able to answer this question or not, but I would like to know what you think about this question. Davit, I would like to ask you, and I don't know if you will be able to answer this question or not, but I would like to know what you think about this question.
SPEAKER_01: I think it's the same. The advantage is that we have a lot of people in the city and in the city, and we have a lot of people in the city and in the city, and we have a lot of people in the city, and we have a lot of people in the city, and we have a lot of people in the city, and we have a lot of people in the city, and we have a lot of people in the city, and we have a lot of people in the city, and we have a lot of people in the city, and we have a lot of people in the city, and we have a lot of people in the city, and we have a lot of people in the city, and we have a lot of people in the city, and we have a lot of people in the city, and we have a lot of people in the city, and we have a lot of people in the city, and we have a lot of people in the city, and we have a lot of people in the city, and we have a lot of people in
SPEAKER_01: There is a lot of work to be done in this field, in this modern championship, and we are doing our best. We are doing our best. We are doing our best. We are doing our best. We are doing our best. We are doing our best. We are doing our best. We are doing our best.
SPEAKER_04: So, yeah, he said that, yeah, obviously, Betkili will win, but he explained why. He said, considering all their matches that they have ever faced each other, which they did during WAFs, every time Betkili came on top, Betkili beat him, Betkili managed to, you know, deassemble his opponents, you know, like...
SPEAKER_04: uh versatility like all the uh possible angles that uh active could have uh uh gained any advantage was unable to do because bet gilly like really countered uh countered it so he believes that just this will be one of uh they are same type of match but uh in a super match uh way and uh bet gilly will be victorious like considering all this experience that they have
SPEAKER_00: Okay, before I ask Megzhan and Lourdal, I'll say on Friday, Bichir Oniani, Talgat Aktaev is going to be on a podcast, also with me and Roman. So Roman doesn't know this, but now he knows. Yeah, I was waiting for you to message me and now... I just set it up, so yeah, I wanted to say.
SPEAKER_02: I won't ask which one you think will win. We know you think Talbot will beat Onyane. But tell us why and how he will win. Because I know how strong his opponent is, Onyane. I also fought with him. I know his strong sides.
SPEAKER_02: I can say that I know his glorious side. Talgat is working hard now. He is not only training for his start, but also for his endurance and strength. I think that
SPEAKER_02: so so they said um
SPEAKER_00: Of course, they support Talgat. They know Betchelioniani very, very well. A lot of the people on this podcast have had matches with him, and they know where is his strong points, where are his weak points. He's a very tough opponent. Talgat has been working not only on his speed, but strength and endurance as well. So he's more than ready and prepared for this match. We go next one.
SPEAKER_00: Nugzari Chikadze vs. Petro Marharint. Same one, mate. You're not asking who. No, no, no. For you, no. For them. For them. For you, of course, no. Nugo Chikadze vs. Petro Marharint. What do you think? Petro Marharint. Petro? Yes, Ukrainian Petro Marharint. He's also very good. I think he'll win. On the right, right?
SPEAKER_02: So they think...
SPEAKER_00: Petro Marharint is going to be the winner they think that he proved himself like he's been when he was on his best shape he was unbelievable uh but you guys is of course a very strong opponent and uh they they know this but they go with Petro uh what does Davit think Davit she has picked up
SPEAKER_01: I think that in 2018-1919, we had one sportsman, we had two sportsmen, but we had a lot of opportunities. We had the opportunity to participate in the World Cup. The prognosis is very good. I can say that the two of them are very strong. It is possible to say that they are the best in the world. I think that in 2018-1919, they will be very strong and strong in this regard.
SPEAKER_04: well samushia knows both of both of the athletes knows their performances he's aware of their uh like capabilities in arm wrestling uh however right now he just would uh like to just say that most um adequate way to put it would be to say 50 50. that's what david said
SPEAKER_04: so he's not just saying that Georgi will win in this case he just says 50 50 because they are both very strong that's what petro is very serious opponent I think that's they are half they are close they are both very strong then he would say 50 50 chance it could go either way yeah I like that match because it's uh hooker stop roll it's a great match uh next match Sunday share this Ibragim Sagov Davit
SPEAKER_01: I would like to ask you, Sandris, if you have anything to say to Marguerite. Thank you very much. I would like to say a few words about the style of the film. It is very interesting. It is very interesting and very interesting.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know what to say. It's very sad. I don't know what to say. I think it's very objective to say that we are in the 50s and 50s. We are very young people, we are very young people, we are very young people, we are very young people.
SPEAKER_04: This one, though, it also says anticipates roughly 50-50 match. They are stylistically different arm wrestlers, like mainly Sagov, we know he pulls inside whilst Sandris is, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: so he says it's 50 50. i would say personally it depends whoever gets his game on like engage first then it will be easier for that guy too yeah i mean this is just the obvious but the least that i could say in this match here um
SPEAKER_02: I don't know, but I saw that Ibragim is a very good player. He is a very good player. He is a very good player. He is a very good player. He is a very good player. He is a very good player. He is a very good player.
SPEAKER_02: I think Sagov will win because he has been showing himself very well in AMC lately. He even beat Silaev once and there are a lot of good athletes. Sandris Sedic is also a very strong athlete, a world champion, but I think Sagov will win.
SPEAKER_00: So he thinks that Sagov will win because Sagov, he did an amazing job on AMC, even beat Silayev. He believes San, this is a very tough opponent, world champion, but they believe that Sagov will win this match. Okay. Ray, I will not ask you your opinion, I'm sure. I'll keep my opinions to myself. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: What do you think of Ekaterina Nikisheva? Davit. What do you think of Ekaterina Nikisheva? Davit. What do you think of Ekaterina Nikisheva? Davit. Davit. Davit. Davit. Davit. Davit. Davit. Davit. Davit. Davit. Davit. Davit. Davit. Davit. Davit. Davit. Davit. Davit. Davit. Davit. Davit. Davit. Davit. Davit. Davit. Davit. Davit. Davit. Davit. Davit. Davit. Davit. Davit. Davit. Davit. Davit. Davit. Davit. Davit. Davit. Davit. Davit. Davit. Davit. Davit. Davit. Davit. Davit. Davit. Davit. Davit. Davit.
SPEAKER_04: Like he goes towards like he gives
SPEAKER_04: more chance of winning to fear because mainly because nikisha ekaterina is being inactive quite a while he'll be more like uh coming back from long pause and we know it's not that effective at this high level so this is mainly because of that i would slightly go towards to fear so he thinks fear has more chances to win okay uh mindaugus and makaro
SPEAKER_04: I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
SPEAKER_01: I don't think that Makarov's hand is very comfortable for everyone. I think Makarov's hand is very comfortable for everyone. I think Makarov is good.
SPEAKER_01: Ray, do you secretly know Georgi?
SPEAKER_04: He says huge, huge respect towards Mindaugus, towards both athletes. But yeah, like you said, and like you already know, he said that because of this palm, anatomically, the way how it's built for Makarov, his hand is awkward pretty much to everyone. So yeah, he says that Makarov will win. He's stronger in this case. And because of this awkwardness, it will be really tough for Mindaugus to claim the victory.
SPEAKER_02: What do you think, Minda or Makarov? I think Minda will be able to win. Because in the match, he was able to win the whole game. He was able to win the whole game. He was able to win the whole game. He was able to win the whole game. I think he will be able to win the whole game. I think he will be able to win the whole game.
SPEAKER_02: I think Mendoza will win. When he fought Prokapchuk, everyone thought that Prokapchuk would win. But he made a mistake. After the third round, he defeated Prokapchuk.
SPEAKER_02: They said that Davit Lee Mindaugus will win. He gave an amazing match.
SPEAKER_00: versus Daniel prokopchuk where uh first two rounds he lost but then he made a great comeback and took full control of the match um and Nodala said that he's been following minogas very closely and he said he's been getting stronger and better and uh and even better armistler every time um we go to uh Ray uh quickly uh
SPEAKER_04: say that there are some some people also asking some questions i encourage them to also ask whilst we are interviewing these two legendary athletes there's one question for both athletes how do they keep somewhat healthy their elbows that's the that is the question sergey is asking
SPEAKER_04: So I will, I will, I may ask Davit first. Davit, .
SPEAKER_01: There is not a single percent of the population in the Trump administration. There is a very large number of people in the Trump administration. There is a very large number of people in the Trump administration. There is a very large number of people in the Trump administration. There is a very large number of people in the Trump administration. There is a very large number of people in the Trump administration.
SPEAKER_04: So Davit said that everybody has injuries all the time and I'm not the exception. That's what Davit said.
SPEAKER_04: and uh but however i don't have specific uh ways to like specifically try to heal or maintain the good health of elbow it's just uh for me it's important to make sure that it has enough time to rest like resting period after workouts or after the uh sparring or after matches rest is very important for me that's what david said nothing too specific for animals just make sure that they have good health
SPEAKER_00: There is a question from the fans. They ask how to keep the elbow healthy. How to keep the elbow healthy. Yes, yes, yes. How to keep it healthy. How to not get injured, right? Yes, yes, yes. Is there something special that he does?
SPEAKER_02: What do you want to say? I want to say thank you. I want to say thank you. I want to say thank you.
SPEAKER_02: I think that you need to train properly. And before the training, you need to warm up properly. And if it hurts, you need to do the right massage, you need to apply the right ointment. And I think that doing this will not hurt.
SPEAKER_00: said first of all it's correct training second of all is correct warm-up if you have pain you should do massage and you should take a rest that's pretty much what he said and also the cream he said i think he said yeah he said cream yeah you can put on some creams like uh different ones the the heating ones the cold ones right they they all differently help um we go to next one uh leonidas arcona versus schoolboy
SPEAKER_02: I'll go with the Kazakhs first. I'll go with the Kazakhs first. I'll go with the Kazakhs first.
SPEAKER_02: He just didn't see his fights. But lately he's been showing good fights. He's beating his opponents. I don't think he's going to lose a fight.
SPEAKER_00: he's going with schoolboy he he doesn't know much about leonidas arcones he hasn't seen his matches uh in uh like you know now schoolboy is winning and he's doing much better and he believes the schoolboy will win
SPEAKER_04: Well, despite him knowing Arkona, he knows who he is. He still shares the same idea as Nurdaulet. He thinks that schoolboy will take the win. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, okay. Yeah, Leonidas is a little unknown, dark horse right now in this competition, right? And it's a little bit more of an influencer match, but I think it's a fun match because Leonidas is definitely strong. He's definitely strong, and he's becoming a really good armwrestler. We've seen him after pulls on East vs. West with Surab and other... Yeah, yeah. He's strong. Really strong, really strong.
SPEAKER_02: Again, I'll start with Kazakhs. Sasho Andreev versus Irakli Zirakashvili. Sasho or Irakli? I'll start with the Kazakhs. Sasho Andreev versus Irakli Zirakashvili. Sasho or Irakli?
SPEAKER_02: They think it's going to be a tough fight. Both of them are strong opponents, strong athletes. They think it's going to be 50-50. I don't know who's going to win. It's going to be a good fight.
SPEAKER_00: he believes that this uh 50 50 very close match uh both guys are very strong very hard to predict it's going to be a very very good match david tell us how iraqli wins is he ready now is he finally ready
SPEAKER_01: Yes, my opinion is very objective. I am a Georgi, and I would like to say that I am a Georgi, and I would like to say that I am a Georgi, and I would like to say that I am a Georgi, and I would like to say that I am a Georgi, and I would like to say that I am a Georgi, and I would like to say that I am a Georgi, and I would like to say that I am a Georgi, and I would like to say that I am a Georgi, and I would like to say that I am a Georgi, and I would like to say that I am a Georgi, and I would like to say that I am a Georgi,
SPEAKER_01: In fact, Zirakashvili is a great man. I think he is a great man. He is a great man. He is a great man. He is a great man. He is a great man. He is a great man. He is a great man. He is a great man.
SPEAKER_04: I don't know if I can say that, but I think it's possible. I think it's possible. Davit, I would like to ask you a question. If you were to fight against Iraqis, what would you do? What would you do if you were to fight against Iraqis? And what would you do if you were to fight against them? Well, this period is not over yet. We still have a long way to go. We still have a long way to go. We still have a long way to go.
SPEAKER_04: So, Ray, I will just briefly summarize and then I will just translate. First, he answered the question and then I asked another question that Frank
SPEAKER_04: uh gave to david about whether he trains with the iraqli to go against top roll or not and uh he answered also that one quickly so first of all about a match uh about david's um opinion on iraqi versus sasho he said that for sure i'm georgian i would love to see every time georgian win uh and uh that's the the way i i will root for them but i'm gonna be objective
SPEAKER_04: And coming from the objective point of view, Dawid said that considering how much has Irakli gained from his previous match against Sasho, which was back in like 2021, right? Like two years, three years or so ago. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: yeah and uh uh since then iraqli gained tremendous better shape he's like almost doubled more like doubled his uh uh performance uh that's what david believes so it's like really really
SPEAKER_04: easy for him to objectively say that iraqi is upgraded since the match and uh same way we cannot say to about sasho so coming from that approach and not just because they are both georgians he thinks that because of this current shape how good iraqi performs and uh how much that
SPEAKER_04: translates to the uh difference of what they were do back in 2020 uh 2021 and now he thinks that because of the sheer difference iraqi is the favorite and he will beat sasho however david did not say score and neither have i asked
SPEAKER_04: And about the second question, he said, unfortunately, under current circumstances, I'm in the western part of Georgi and Iraq is in the eastern part, which is the capital city, which Engin was, we know, several days ago. I was also there with boys. Davit cannot practice with Iraq for this specific match. That's the answer to the question.
SPEAKER_04: Okay, that's a very objective. I have a bunch of things to translate. You have great memory. Yeah, I'm practicing, I'm doing the translations all the time. I'm making notes. But wait, sorry.
SPEAKER_04: i have to be honest uh we uh i mean i talked to uh um pablo and uh rented his memory skills for this translation so yeah just just between us you know yeah the apollo's memory uh okay georgie svetkov uh
SPEAKER_00: Do you think it will be hard? If Alex takes the ticket, because they met, in my opinion, once in the Zloty Artur. Alex won. But now we see that it is very difficult to finish.
SPEAKER_02: Georgi. He defends himself very well. Do you think Kurdecha will understand this or not? Maybe Kurdecha will understand, but I don't know. Tsvetkov has been showing himself very well lately. And Tsvetkov may win.
SPEAKER_02: Once again, please.
SPEAKER_00: 60 to 40. Okay, okay, okay. I asked about Georgi. I said that, well, we know that Georgi is very hard to beat. And when they met last time, Kordechov won. But maybe this version of Georgi is even harder to beat, even if you get the hand. And they said, well, it's hard to predict what's going to happen, but they believe Georgi will win. It's 60 to 40, 60 to 40. Davit, what do you think?
SPEAKER_04: Dawid, now it's your turn. After Georgi, it's Alex's turn. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
SPEAKER_04: It was Davit couldn't hear what I said, I will just repeat myself. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
SPEAKER_04: He said that I share the same opinion. I think Zvetko will convincingly beat Alex. Okay. Frank Lamparelli vs. Michael Todd.
SPEAKER_00: Can Frank Lamparelli beat Michael Todd? Up to 105 kg with his right hand. Michael Todd. Michael Todd. 115 kg. We think Michael Todd will win. I don't know.
SPEAKER_02: Lamparelli is also good, but we think that Michael will win here. Lately, his training has been going very well.
SPEAKER_00: So they said that they believe Michael Dodds is going to win. They believe Frank Lamparelli is very strong, but Michael has been looking very good in his training, progressing very, very well. What does Davit think about this? Michael or Lamparelli? Davit, you can talk about the match. What do you think about Lamparelli?
SPEAKER_04: audio is a bit laggy for me i don't know if it's the same for you so but yeah he said 50 50 uh both has roughly equal chances to beat one another yeah
SPEAKER_00: oh great okay okay you say it and then now stop it what does he think can frank beat michael without the press oh great question now it's uh two gonia and two pick up two mega chain or frank is
SPEAKER_01: I think it will be very difficult. There are a lot of sportsmen out there, and if they do well, they will be able to win. I think it will be very difficult, but I don't think there will be a single sportsman who will be able to win. Yes, that's right. I mean, it's not a matter of whether the press will be able to win or not.
SPEAKER_04: he said it's really tough to tough to say yes to that answer but also he cannot say no because he cannot rule out the fact so it's possible but it's kind of not that easy so there was one question i saw for
SPEAKER_00: for uh about his plans if he wants to stay at 85 kg regardless of uh
SPEAKER_00: It doesn't depend on the result. Is it your category, or do you want to go back to 80, or go further to 90? Or now, 85 is your plan? And even on the World Cup, where do you want to participate? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
SPEAKER_02: I want to say that the world champion is 805 kg.
SPEAKER_02: And he said right now at this point...
SPEAKER_00: He's right now concentrated on 85 kilos, East versus West and Woff. His plan is to become world champion at Woff at 85 kilos. But he said if his weight keeps going up, then he will go to a different class. That's how he feels.
SPEAKER_04: And actually, following up that question, there is Vladimir Majorov actually in the chat. I'm not sure if he's the same or the one, but he claims, he thinks that Nurdayev will stay up, he will not go down. Maksim, did you see there, I don't know, look at the chat, there Vladimir Majorov wrote. I can...
SPEAKER_00: Nurdaulet has already gained a lot on Kumis. He came to events in the past and was not 85, and now he needs to lose weight. Well, at 80 he will not return to his wife.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, okay. He said that in last event he was 86-87, he had to cut 1-2 kilos for that, so yeah. You see there's Engin in the chat, he said. There's no Vladimir, that is Alexsandr.
SPEAKER_00: Sorry, it's not Vladimir Majorov, it's Alexsandr Majorov. As Travis said. Okay, we go to the next match. Ermes Gasparini vs. Alizhan Muratov.
SPEAKER_00: let's go david let's go without okay david um
SPEAKER_01: Both of them have big chances, both of them are very strong. It's a fact that Muratov is very good in the national team, he is very good in the national team, but he is a very good sportsman. He is very good in the national team, but he is a very good sportsman. He is a very good sportsman.
SPEAKER_04: Davit thinks that this match is also close. He says 50-50 because obviously we have seen
SPEAKER_04: uh how amazingly strong uh alijan is and how convincingly he has beaten his opponents and he's like he's uh prime right now so to say that's what david said however ermis is really smart and great technical arm wrestler and he has uh he or the type of arm wrestler that can come up with some type of solutions in the battle
SPEAKER_04: And we cannot just underestimate his potential skills on left hand during the match against Alizhan. So he says both guys have roughly same chances to beat one another like 50-50. His personal opinion. Okay. What do you think? Ermes vs. Alizhan. Alizhan, Muratov.
SPEAKER_02: In my opinion, we think that Ermes has no chance against Alizhan. Alizhan is very good with his left-handed category. But we'll see how it goes tomorrow at the match. But we think that Alizhan will win.
SPEAKER_01: Sorry, he just wanted to add up something. Sorry.
SPEAKER_01: Gasparini is in the middle of the category. And now he's going to be in the top 50, he's going to be in the top 20. Do you think that's the main factor? I think it depends on the situation. In the first category, he was in the top 50, and Muratov was in the bottom 50.
SPEAKER_01: Davit just wanted to add up what he has said before about this match.
SPEAKER_04: Had it been under 115 kg, if it was like limited to 115 kg, then he would not say 50-50, he would go towards to Alisson. But considering like maybe 20 kg or like 15 or 20 kg heavier than Ermes is currently, it's like super heavyweight match, left arm.
SPEAKER_04: even though Alizhan had also beaten super heavyweights, this factor that Ermes is that much heavier will help Ermes more than it will play a negative role towards Alizhan. So basically, because of this weight difference, he says Ermes has a chance. That's why he says 50-50. Had it been like 150 kg limit, then heads down, Alizhan would be...
SPEAKER_00: taking the match i'll i'll ask us what they think because they said there's no chance that uh
SPEAKER_00: Davit said that he thinks 50-50, because if there was a weight limit, for example, 115, something like that, he thinks that Alizhan will win without talking at all. But Ermes will be more than 130 kilograms, Alizhan will be, well, maybe 110, maybe. Do you think there is some factor or is it not a factor at all, in your opinion?
SPEAKER_02: In our opinion, Ermes Pravchar is good on the right hand. Very good. And Alizhan, on the contrary, is good on the left hand. And it turns out that many percent is on the side of Alizhan.
SPEAKER_02: That's why we think that Arishan will win. He proved that weight doesn't matter at the World Championships. He won 130 kg with Georgi and Bulgarian.
SPEAKER_00: Ermes' best hand is right arm, Aljan's best arm is his left arm. And Aljan proved already in World Championship that weight for him doesn't matter. He beat everyone. It doesn't matter what their weight was. So they believe it's still a huge edge for Aljan just because it's his best arm, just like it would be if it would be on the right arm, you know, for Ermes. Then a huge favorite would be Ermes.
SPEAKER_00: OK, we are down to the last match.
SPEAKER_00: Levan Levan Saginashvili vs Devon Larratt. I'll start with Cossacks. Who do you think will be the new heavyweight champion? Will Levan be in such good shape that he will show what he was last time, or will Devon be what we see now, the other Devon that we saw two years ago?
SPEAKER_02: Yes, of course. I am a sportsman from Makhta. I have been training in Levan and Larratt. I have been training in Levan and Larratt. I have been training in Levan and Larratt. I have been training in Levan and Larratt. I have been training in Levan and Larratt. I have been training in Levan and Larratt.
SPEAKER_02: I follow the training of Levan and Devon. Devon is not the same Devon who was two years ago. He gained strength and weight. And Levan is also a very huge, very strong athlete.
SPEAKER_02: They are both good, both strong. I can't say that someone will win. My prediction is 50-50.
SPEAKER_00: He said they've been following Devon's training and they see that Devon is probably in his best shape ever, coming up and really improved. They see that Levan is back in training and doing the same thing and also showing up in great shape. So for them, this is a 50-50 match. It's very hard to pick a winner for this one. He's no winner, but he's a winner.
SPEAKER_04: let's move on to david yeah he said he believes that history will repeat itself like it was back in two years ago so it will be a dominant victory by level that's what he's saying okay okay um
SPEAKER_04: Before we end this, maybe any last words you want to say to his opponent, Davit, to Nurdaulet and us, Nurdaulet the same. Meanwhile, I will also look in the chat maybe. Yeah. Yeah. Davit, .
SPEAKER_01: I don't think it's right to say that this is the end of the world. It's not the end of the world, it's not the end of the world, it's not the end of the world, it's not the end of the world.
SPEAKER_01: I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so.
SPEAKER_04: So that would say I would wish my opponent good preparation time and I wish him and both of us to finish up the match without any injuries. That's first and foremost. And he doubled down one more time about kind of a brief prediction to their matches. He's anticipating Nur Dalet as his really tough opponent.
SPEAKER_04: maybe one of the toughest he has had so far. And he, Davit himself, is coming for the victory. And he wants to push his limits. He wants to show his maximum because he believes that's what it would take to take down Nur Dalet in his upcoming match. And he lastly said that best of luck, Nur Dalet. We'll see each other very soon.
SPEAKER_00: I'll ask him the same question and translate. The last word you want to say is for Davit. I will translate what he said. He said good preparation. He hopes that the fight will be good and there will be no injuries at the end.
SPEAKER_00: For him, Nur Nurdaulet is one of the most difficult opponents. He comes to this fight very seriously. And the most important thing is good luck for both of you. He can't wait for this match. What does Nur Nurdaulet want to say to Davidov?
SPEAKER_02: It's not like that. It's not like that. It's not like that.
SPEAKER_02: Davit is a great athlete. I have been training with him for a long time. I have been training with him in the world championships. I have been training with him for a long time. I have been training with him for a long time. I have been training with him for a long time.
SPEAKER_02: I have been training from the beginning. I have been training from the beginning. I have been training from the beginning. I have been training from the beginning. I have been training from the beginning.
SPEAKER_02: I have known Davit for many years. He is a very strong athlete, a very serious athlete. I have a very serious relationship with him. I have a very serious relationship with him. I have a very serious relationship with him. I have a very serious relationship with him. I have a very serious relationship with him. I have a very serious relationship with him. I have a very serious relationship with him. I have a very serious relationship with him.
SPEAKER_02: But I wish good luck to my husband and we are also looking forward to this fight. And I hope to see you on April 20 in Istanbul.
SPEAKER_00: wishes good luck in preparation in competition he knows david samushi for a very long time he's very strong and very serious athlete they also cannot wait for this match to happen and of course they wish david good luck same
SPEAKER_04: yeah um there is uh some other questions as well but if we are running low on time it's like i think we can finish it's it's very late in yeah so i would just say one thing that um for sergey this is the guy i was talking about the question he has the question towards david about who he has beaten uh the best top roller in his uh career so i can just uh ask david in person and then
SPEAKER_04: Then we can finish this up.
SPEAKER_01: Yes. I think that I am one of the few people who can compete with all the other competitors and compete with all the other teams.
SPEAKER_01: He just wants to...
SPEAKER_04: Even though I was speaking first person on his behalf, even though I had many great top-roller opponents at East vs. West, I will restrain myself to say one guy was the toughest and the best top-roller.
SPEAKER_04: so basically uh what david said was that uh every athlete that he has beaten uh was his opponents were toughest opponents that uh anybody could have thrown at him so to say uh at east versus west so he just wants to remark how strong opponents he had and he did not say any specific name this guy was the best of brothers so he let it uh for the people to just judge all right
SPEAKER_00: That's it. So, for everyone, tomorrow.
SPEAKER_00: uh we're still setting up the time so uh nugo and uh petro margarit is going to be our guests and then on friday talga taktayev and betkili oniani also will set up the time so everyone knows i want to thank uh david samushius uh specific uh spasiba mexiana spasiba and of course thanks to roman for being awesome guys always
