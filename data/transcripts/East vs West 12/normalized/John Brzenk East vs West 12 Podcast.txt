SPEAKER_00: hey john hey how's it going everything is good everything is good good to see you my friend yeah before we get started um phone this way or this way no no opposite way opposite way but we started already yeah yeah just this way though yeah yeah that one's good okay after after so i don't have to hold this thing this the whole time i'll try to figure out this mount i haven't used the uh the cell phone in a long time so when i got your
SPEAKER_00: your thing and it said only good on mobile, I thought, oh, shit, hurry up, get this. Oh, I didn't know that. I didn't know that. Yeah. So, yeah, no worries. So you don't have to hold it, right? You can put somewhere and then it can stay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's good. My left will be my right arm and my right will be my left arm because I'm doing a selfie, right? I'm not sure.
SPEAKER_00: Show me your right arm now, I will tell you. No, that's correct. Yeah, so that it looks like my right arm? Yeah, yeah, it is your right arm, yeah. Oh, cool. All right. So how's it going? Everything is fine. Everything is fine.
SPEAKER_00: yeah um i was gonna ask you you said that you just joined a training recently and you felt good do i remember correct or no i haven't done anything i have not really touched a table other than a few amateurs um since my match with uh krazy i haven't i haven't really done anything in fact i had i really hadn't done anything in three four weeks before i pulled krazy um just trying to rest up after um
SPEAKER_00: know my previous match um with sasho so yeah no i've been uh i'm just doing kind of a long-term put no pressure on my shoulder just to see how it goes yeah yeah i mean i'm not pulling in april and um yeah i mean august is quite a ways away so i decided instead of instead of forcing it and trying to stay in shape with you know arm wrestling i was going to try to get my shoulder like a chance to really completely heal so i haven't really done anything so
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, but I think that's the best thing to do. Just you pull whenever you feel ready. Not like we pull, we put, you set your match and then you try to get ready. I don't think it makes sense. I think you need to get ready and then we set the match. I mean, like whenever you feel ready. No, it's been, arthritis has definitely been more and more of a problem as I've gotten more involved in the sport and probably due to my age, right? But
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I'm almost kind of on the camp of doing other exercises, getting away from the just arm wrestling for getting in shape and doing just a lot of hand and wrist and forearm and elbow stuff and trying to really limit the exposure that my shoulder has been getting, you know, my arm wrestling.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I had a hair transplantation. Oh, I see that. Yeah, you get a little darker up there. But it just comes first and then it drops and then it comes back again, you know. So now I feel like it's going away now.
SPEAKER_04: But this is what they told me. First it comes, and then it goes. But the roots stay, but somehow it looks like it's cut. Whenever I sleep, I wake up on the pillow, I see it's like they are like one centimeter cut here, you know. It just falls. And I was worried, you know, like what's happening, you know. And I talked with them, and they explained to me. Everything is fine. But now it's going a little bit away, yeah. Okay. So is your procedure done? When did you have that done? A couple months ago? Three weeks ago.
SPEAKER_04: Three weeks ago? No, probably four weeks ago. Monday will be four weeks. Monday, two days later will be four weeks. So 19 days, yeah. And one procedure and you're done. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But I entered there and get out. It was 13 hours.
SPEAKER_04: Is it painful? The only part painful was the injection so that you wouldn't feel the pain. The injection probably somewhere else in my body wouldn't be that hurtful, but the thin skin on the head, it's painful. After the numbing agent, then they're putting like actually needling you with plugs with hair? Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: they they um i think took the uh hair from back sides everywhere and then here they made some you know places to plant them and then and then they put it like 4 600 of them or something oh wow yeah that would be a long procedure unless it's unless it's some automated machine that
SPEAKER_04: yeah no no no they just do it one by one that's why it was so long kind of my neck hurts you know but everything you should have told them just put you to sleep wake you up when it's done yeah yeah i think i fell asleep a few times um so i i wouldn't want to bother them by possible snoring or something because your your head is just going back anyway so um
SPEAKER_04: What was I going to say? Anyway, so they told me not to train for one month, but I just started a few days ago, so I could only wait for like two weeks, you know, but I have to. What's your plans? Do you have a match in mind that you're trying to shoot for? I am in the same exact position as you are.
SPEAKER_04: Like, I want to just start training, training, be pain-free, get into shape, no pressure. Because if I have, like, put something that I'm pushing myself, and it gets worse. So just slow by slow, yeah, everything is better, you know. Yeah, people give me advice all the time. You need to do this, you need to do that. I'm like, okay, listen, I've been doing this for 40 years.
SPEAKER_00: When I have a hard time pushing myself out of bed, it's not due to the lack of wanting to try or train. It's my body just not, you know, it's just hurting and it's difficult to balance on that line. Bill, understand. Two days ago, the goat, arm wrestling goat was my guest.
SPEAKER_04: Mindaugus Tarasaitis. He told me that you and anyone else were getting injured because we didn't know how to train. I explained to him that, listen, I gave your example that I said, John, as a 85, 90, 95 kilo guy, most of your career, you're going to pull Cliff Dean, Richard Lapkus,
SPEAKER_00: All of those guys you're going to pull and you're not going to have any damage, overuse damage. Well, you know, to be quite honest with you, Ingen, I think I've skirted most of the really heavy physical damage. I can't really...
SPEAKER_00: I mean, yes, I've got a little, you know, muscle tears and little tendon tears, but those things all healed up, you know, I think stronger. So to say that I didn't do the right things to stay healthy and not hurt myself, I would argue that I, you know, I escaped big injuries for most of my career. But I mean, you're not going to be able to escape arthritis. I mean, you know, everybody gets, well, not everybody gets that, but if you're genetically, you know,
SPEAKER_00: But don't you think that overuse, overuse, like whenever you do something overuse, then like there is a damage. It's not the damage of just one thing. Of course, of course. But I'm feeling the effects now, you know, even in my left arm, my left shoulder, which I pretty much have not done very much arm wrestling throughout my career. I mean, just a little bit here and there, but it's the left shoulder is just getting as bad as the right shoulder. So it's,
SPEAKER_04: I think it's more than that. But John, I think that whenever I'm training, if I'm not really pushing my limits, I feel better. When there is a blood circulation,
SPEAKER_04: you experience it's just even like like everything is hurting everything but once you do blood blood flowing it doesn't have to be a hundred percent you know just a little bit like if you move if you do a little bit like training i think i think it's gonna be helpful you know yeah yeah no i agree my mindset right now is like i got i got i gotta stop arm wrestling i gotta quit arm wrestling but i i know what you're saying you know the reason is being that i'm just like picking up a gallon of milk i'm going oh my god that's
SPEAKER_04: That's not easy. But I can tell you something, if you every day, 5 kilo, 10 kilo, a little bit shoulder or something, I think that, you know, the things will be better. Like whenever you don't do anything at all and suddenly even you have a gallon of milk or something, it still will hurt, you know. But if you do...
SPEAKER_04: if you do every day some training you know the things even the metal whenever it's working it doesn't get rusty right right once it doesn't move it gets rusty you know this is all right well i appreciate the pep talk and i'll you know i'll definitely start starting slow again here maybe in another three four weeks another month i'll give it yeah so i mean just like even now like five kilo ten kilo i think i think it will make your pain less my opinion just but of course your experience may be different than mine yeah
SPEAKER_00: Anyways, did you have any chance to see the card poster, the matches? I did, and I'm super impressed. I mean, you always say this, and I laugh, that it's the best card ever, but I think this for sure is the best card ever. Yeah, I agree. You have some monsters going at it. Yeah, yeah. I'm super impressed. Like, every match is a great match. I'm super excited to see it. Yeah, thank you, thank you.
SPEAKER_04: And June, June one lay. Thank you for your support, my friend. Thank you. Um, yeah, but, uh, it would be great, you know, if you would be part of it too, but hopefully next time. It's a long trip. I would love to, um,
SPEAKER_00: I'm sure at some point I'll be missing going back, but I don't know. Maybe as it gets closer, I'll just jump on a plane and go. Yeah, yeah, you're more than welcome. People love your commentating as well, you know. You saw yesterday, right, the tweet? Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's crazy. What's his involvement with arm wrestling? How does he even know? I have no idea. I have no idea. How do you pronounce his name? Scheil?
SPEAKER_04: Shale, yeah, I think Shale. Yeah, the guy is just probably the most entertaining athlete. Super articulate. Yeah, no, he's a great, great speaker. I mean, he's on the level of McGregor, right, as far as the exciting. Probably even higher about talking. He's more like Muhammad Ali level. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: yeah imagine him being just uh did you know that somehow you know we reached him and we invited him here and he said he will take time to think about it oh okay yeah i mean i would love to see once he got a little educated over you know about the sport and the athletes i would love to see him as a commentator holy cow that would increase the excitement level of the sport for sure yeah imagine him at the press conference ah yeah yeah
SPEAKER_00: I hate to say it, but that's what everybody needs. It's a shame that most of the arm wrestlers don't have that type of personality. Yeah. It would definitely bring the entertainment value up. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It would be incredible, yeah. Anyway, so I would like to talk about the matches, you know, at least...
SPEAKER_04: some of them that you are familiar i'm sure you are familiar with everyone but um like okay let's let's let me still ask you all of them and then you can tell me if you are familiar or not but you know all the guys are world champion but yeah yeah of course i you know i've seen most of their
SPEAKER_04: What matches a lot of these guys I've seen, but I've not had firsthand experience to really grip up with them to see. Okay. One of them, let's start from Nugo Chikadze. It's Nugo Chikadze from Georgi. Okay. And before the pandemic, he was a youth category player. He was very strong.
SPEAKER_04: And now he came to the Europeans because Georgi was like kind of banned by WAF or something, you know, and they didn't compete like for three years or two years. Yeah. And then he came in the last Europeans and he top rolled Krasimir in strep. Oh, wow. Yeah. Yeah. He top rolled Krasimir in strep. He really...
SPEAKER_04: Poptis Rizzo, right? Yeah, Poptis Rizzo, and then beat him. Yeah, he beat him twice. Okay. So, but his opponent, so anyone who is top-rolling Krasimir in strap must have something very strong here. Very strong top-roll, for sure. Yeah, yeah. And his opponent, whenever I say his opponent, then you will also say that it is very, very hard to top-roll this guy. This is Petro Makarins. Do you remember him? Oh, yeah, of course I remember him. From Beldova.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, no, that guy's got like a 20-inch forearm. I mean, his cupping ability is incredible for putting people in a hook, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so I do have first-hand experience with... You pronounce his name right? Petro Marharint. Petro Marharint, yeah. Wow, well, so, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I mean, who beat him that day in Moldova? Nobody. No, he beat Ravaz as well. He beat Ravaz too. Yeah, he hooked him, he hooked him. Ravaz, two months before that event, he had a war with Levan at the WAF. Okay. And this guy just hooked him, you know. So it'll be interesting to see what his condition is. Obviously, the kid that you talk of is current and training and pulling.
SPEAKER_00: active in big events and has proven that he's definitely capable of top-rolling, we'll have to see how Morant comes in. I mean, I haven't seen him since Moldova, so that's what, three, four years ago? Five years ago? Yeah, yeah. It was 2018. So it's a little bit more than five years. But Petro Marharint also competed in the 2022 World Championships.
SPEAKER_04: There he beat Krasimir after the war. And then he got tired and lost a match on fouls and something. So Krasimir ended up winning the war. Petro, is he from Ukraine? Yes. Where is he from? Ukraine. Oh, okay. Currently still in Ukraine? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. All right.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, so what do you think? Anything can happen? Well, like I said, it just depends. I mean, five years is a long time to be away from the sport. But, I mean, he definitely has the build and natural ability probably to just walk off the street not doing anything and still be effective on 99% of the people. So, yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Has anybody ever seen him pull? Can he adjust and pull if he gets his hand flattened or taken away? Even if it's just flattened? Or is he still... Petro? Yeah, Petro. I don't remember. I think Petro most likely has the pound for pound strongest cupping. Oh, cupping ability. I think one of them for sure, you know. Not many people's cupping impresses me, but this guy is one of them. Mohinder Singh says, I am a big
SPEAKER_04: fan of arsene lillier and he said he is a fan of him yeah and he is example we will be talking about that one too okay yeah arson yeah how was he doing i i haven't seen your podcast uh that you guys did like a little four-way with um brandon and
SPEAKER_00: Who else was on there? Oh, Matyshenko. Matyshenko was a translator. Oh, he was a translator. So this is the current form of... He's looking massive. Not that bad. Well, you know, like I said, he's...
SPEAKER_00: got that natural ability also that he could be away from the sport and not have done anything and still be probably 95% of the pros already, you know, just walking off the street, doing nothing. So if he's, if he's committed and been, been arm wrestling since probably, probably the last event that I saw him at East versus West, he was talking about getting back in shape. Now it's just not going to take long. He's going to, you know, he's, he's still had, he still has that build and he still has that, those tendons and that genetic, um,
SPEAKER_04: genetic ability so you know you know what's coming into this year right ah what's it oh you you're going to match him up against me you're going to throw this another sacrificial lamb sacrifice listen i i was the one who convinced alexis to come back and then he pulled 20 years ago you lost against him and this time you beat him and and now arsen lilly he has defeated you
SPEAKER_00: three two because you are so stubborn to just like i'm gonna hook him i'm gonna hook him without the step you know yeah every time you went to step you took him and beat him and that wasn't easy that's that's what that was when my mindset was that i just couldn't beat anybody when i was on the bad side of the strap so i think i i was just set on when i got put on the the wrong side of the straps i was like okay well i'm gonna try to
SPEAKER_00: try to force that hook or get that hook. I should have at least attempted one time to try to still battle up top being on the bad side. It's head games. My mental state wasn't the greatest then, I guess, for that. It wasn't that I was trying to do anything different or special or...
SPEAKER_04: You are the only one that in his career, you really, in his weight, you crack his wrist. No, you crack his wrist like this. He also says up to this day, John Bersing is the only one that cracked my wrist, you know. He says that, yeah. Yeah, and looking at that match, it wasn't so much that I had superior back pressure, it's that I was able to
SPEAKER_00: maintain kind of a flat hand and just almost threw him sideways. So that's the side pressure that I was able to apply, took his hand. So he's got to be one of the very top, top guys. I mean, I would put him up like at the level of Ermes as far as a posting style and Travis, a posting style top. I mean, there's not many people that have that ability to keep their knuckles high and strong like that. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: The guy did in eight years more than many people could do in 30 years, you know that eight years 2005-2013 he was just like a wind, you know from a lot, you know, yeah. Go ahead. No, I was just gonna say that he learned to develop his strengths. I mean, he never really had a super
SPEAKER_00: Big hand dominant hand in that respect. So he had to he had to pull that way I mean his hand was obviously super strong, but not Dominant were you you know, the palm could really take advantage of your yeah. Yeah. Yeah, he had to rely on that. I'm so small 400 Yeah, even like Gary Goodrich's Travis. Oh, yeah these guys
SPEAKER_04: yeah you can adapt i remember gary goodish pulling cleave dean he was just only holding his thumb yeah yep yep keeping his knuckles high keeping that back pressure going yes yeah mohinder thing says please tell arson he doesn't need translator i tried to tell him my friend but uh he doesn't know i spoke with i spoke with him in istanbul he he was like normal conversation i never i forgot i was forgot for a second that he was russian i was like damn yes yeah
SPEAKER_04: He cannot really express deep thoughts, detailed thoughts, but he needs to get used to. Three years ago, Ermes knew nothing about English. He came to Istanbul, he couldn't. Right now he's just speaking, you know. Yeah, he speaks better than most Americans, better than me. Okay, Sandris.
SPEAKER_00: from Latvia, Sandris Šedis, versus Ibragim Sagov. Do you remember Ibragim, the pull against Todd Hutchins? Yeah, Todd Hutchins. Yeah, super strong in a hook. Yeah. And super good endurance. I mean, from what I remember, Todd was... Long match. To the end, to the limit. So, I don't see him fading. Great match. I mean, you know... 105. How good is this top pro? I mean, I don't see him...
SPEAKER_04: beating him in a hook, right? I mean, I don't know. It's just awesome, you know, awesome match. Two of the very best at what? What's the weight going to be? 240? No, 231, 105. Because Sandris is 108 now. He wants to pull 105. Yeah, he wants to pull that category, yeah. And we will see, you know.
SPEAKER_04: Ibragim is four times AMC champion, you know, the Russian event, four times champion. And it will be tough. Both are very confident about that. Yeah. I didn't get a chance to pull with the... What's his name again? Ibragim or Sandris?
SPEAKER_04: Ibragim. Ibragim Sagov. In English, his name would be Abraham. Abraham, Ibragim, Ibragim, all same name, yeah. Yeah, no, I mean, I just air pulled with him in the lobby, super, super rock solid hands, super strong hands. You mean when he pulled Tatashins?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, when he pulled Todd Hutchins, yeah. Of course, I didn't get a chance to pull him on the table, but just meeting him and just gripping up, I thought, oh my goodness, yeah, he's... This was after the event? I think it was before. I think it was before that. I mean, we didn't do anything, you know, hard. I just, like, just a little bit of feeling each other out. I'm like, damn. Wide, thick, strong, solid, woodsy-like hand. So, yeah, that'll be an interesting match for sure. Okay.
SPEAKER_04: Another one. This one, I don't know if you are familiar, but both are world champions. One is Talgat Akdev, super fast hook puller, Kazakh puller. And he in 2022 in Antalya, he beat
SPEAKER_04: oleg zok in india in the final and his opponent is betty oniani he also goes inside maybe you remember the first time you guys come here for the east first west it was his first was true he also had a match with oleg zok but oleg top rolled him and then he had a long fight with him this way you know so this is a left-handed match yeah left-handed matches at uh what's the weight these guys are 175 165 no no no these are this is uh 209.
SPEAKER_04: Oh, 209. Oh, big guys. Yeah. Oh, okay. Yeah. No. No ideas. I've been out of the left-handed. Uh-huh. Okay. Let me go to the next one. I knew that you wouldn't be so... Okay. Artur Makarov versus Nindaga Tarasaitis. You remember Artur? I don't. Artur Makarov is the one that beat me. Oh, yeah, yeah. The guy that pulled you. Yeah, yeah. Pulled me. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah. And he's gonna put like, until now, he always came up winning against Tarasaitis.
SPEAKER_04: Okay. They pull in three, four different events, and then Artur always won. Mindaugus just won one match, but then he took second place. So is he defending his world title? Is he defending his title? The champion is right now Mindaugus, because Mindaugus beat Daniel Prokopchuk, if you remember. Of course, of course. But I wasn't sure if that was the weight class that they were going to pull at. Yeah, it was 165, and now Artur is coming here.
SPEAKER_04: And Artur is the second guy in Russia. He gives tough matches to Alan Zolev, Hajim Razolev's younger brother. But Alan beats him, you know. But Alan right now, he's going to military school. He cannot get out of Russia. So we couldn't invite him. But Artur is coming, so we will see how it will be. One is going inside, sometimes even side pressure, Artur. And Minda goes, as you know. Yes, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, very impressive what he did to Daniel. So, I mean, I got to stick with him now because he proved me wrong.
SPEAKER_00: with the, you know, Daniel match. So, um, yeah. What did you think about that match when you are watching after two rounds? I was like, wow, what a mismatch I was. Yeah. It's funny. It's funny how things switch like that. Like, I mean, as Daniel, I know, I know he's in great shape cause I pulled with him and he's, he's made me give up. So I, um, but maybe he's just, you know, more explosive. He's got that, that type body type that just kind of,
SPEAKER_00: know drops down 10 or so after a match or two no error maybe maybe i mean that was that high knuckle but the third round he was like more you know loaded everything there was no empty space yeah uh daniel to go and combination of a lot of things right i mean you could be mentally letting down thinking that you've got it in the bag and you're you're just gonna you know kind of cruise control and i i think even some of us probably go into that mode of
SPEAKER_00: letting out a little rope, right? They want to see if they can still win, if they ease up a little bit. It seems like that. Round three, it seems like that, yeah. Sometimes it bites you. But if that's what you enjoy doing, then you just got to let them do it. Yeah. Okay. This one, you know FIA, right? For sure. But do you know Ekaterina Nikisheva?
SPEAKER_04: No, sounds Russian. Yeah, she is also world champion, multiple times world champion. Yeah, this is going to be another world title match. Okay, then, okay. This one now changed. Normally, Irakli and Oleg Petro, they were going to pull against each other.
SPEAKER_04: Okay. Normally. But then what happened that Kedirgada Ongarwev and Tata Sings, it was set for Dubai, June 1st. The revenge. Okay, gotcha. And then Tata Sings had to join Memorial.
SPEAKER_04: The next day. He had to join what? The funeral, memorial. Okay. You know, funeral, then you go. Okay, a funeral. And there is a memorial, you know, like when. Memorial funeral, okay. Yeah, yeah. I just don't want to because it's a private thing, you know, just I don't know. Okay, maybe I say it's like his mother's.
SPEAKER_04: memorial the next day okay okay okay so he cannot make it we just check all the flies or something they check it and then he couldn't make it so he said that i cannot make it and i said of course you know like and then there are important things more important things in this life you know so what we did i was just thinking uh petrenko was also asking a title match against uh
SPEAKER_04: He beat Barboza, he beat Chancho, he was like looking for a Dadikian match. And then, so we thought that since Ongarbaev was also looking for a title match, so we just removed Petro from Apple events to King of the Table events. And I said Sasho versus Irakli, 95 kilos. Right. Yeah. And this is world title match. World title match? Yeah, of course.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, because Irakli is walking around 96, 97 kilo. He was going to pull 105 against Petro. In fact, his category is 95. But Sasho didn't answer me. He was late, you know. And then I said this match. And later he said he would pull him. And then this was the thing. So we moved Petro there. And then Irakli and Sasho, they are going to pull. Normally they were set to pull July. But now it's going to happen in April. They bought once.
SPEAKER_00: Gotcha. At the world title, 95 kilos, which is 209. Yeah. Did you know that they pulled? Yeah, I've seen their matches. I mean, directly comes out of the gate hard, fast, and kind of top-rolled him. I think he won the first match or second match, right? First round he won, then he lost four rounds. Four rounds, yeah. Once he ran out of gas, it's tough to bounce back once, you know, with a minute and a half, two minutes rest between rounds, I mean. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: And Arecle is a race car, right? He's high fuel, low distance. Sasho, yeah. Chit, I don't know. It's hard for me to say. I mean, if it stops, I think Sasho for sure. But Arecle has looked so impressive, so explosive against top guys. In fact, didn't I just see him smacking, which I don't know what the situation was. He beat me.
SPEAKER_04: And then he beat Rustam Babaya. And then in a training match after the Dave Sheffield match, he pulled a little bit with Vitaly Lalesin. That's what I saw, yeah. That's what I was seeing. So it's training and you don't know what kind of condition Vitaly was in.
SPEAKER_00: You wouldn't bet on Irakli if they would really pull. Yeah, fresh for fresh. That tall arm would probably be very difficult for Irakli's move. Super excited, super impressive. Where do you see the match? Who's going to put the belt on? Both of them are top, top guys. Irakli's probably going to be a little more hungry, I would imagine.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I mean, they got experience against each other, so they should know what they're going to be up against. It's just all depends on whose day it is. I mean, I won't even say who's more prepared because they're both completely fully dedicated to the sport. So, yeah, just depending on, you know, if they're completely healed and the referees are kind to them and everything is a happy, you know, they got a good night's sleep and
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, you are saying that even little tiny details can make a difference. The tiniest sway or something could happen, you know, somebody could yell in the crowd and it could change the whole dynamic. Is it because they are very close to each other? Yeah, super close. But I do believe that as soon as Sasho was able to figure out somehow to
SPEAKER_00: you know slow the match down and get it stopped somewhere um then he'll he'll be the guy to be looking at for the for the later rounds right so or actually it's going to have to just stay focused and mean and vicious and clean and just be popping hard and you know staying fresh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah anyway so i have a question for you like you see the 105 kilo category you see
SPEAKER_04: There is Petro Marharint. There is Petro. Even Irakli can make that category. And then you and Tata Sings and the many others, you know. I don't remember, like, this one category being that competitive in the history. Like, I think this is right now two categories that, like, incredibly, like, competitive. One is 105. The other one is a super heavyweight. The super heavyweight, look at now, Devon.
SPEAKER_04: Levan, Ermes, Jerry, Gennady, Denis Tiplenko, Artur Morozov, Georgi Tsvetkov, Laletin, Dzeranov, Alex Kurdecha. You know, it's just like, in the past, there was like three, four guys, you know, in the conversation. Now it's just...
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, very tough. Of course, Levan is just like, we will talk about it, but there are a lot of really high-level super heavyweights, you know. Right, a lot of contenders for sure. The contender category is very deep.
SPEAKER_00: And I agree with you, the 105 kilo, it'd be interesting to see those 10, 12, 14 guys maybe pull a double elimination tournament just to see because it would change things. Right. I mean, a lot of the guys that could with super matches might come out a little bit better and one and done and sit down and then go to the next next round. So.
SPEAKER_04: But yeah, I'm super excited to see Khadigali pull Hutchins again. I mean, that's still on, right? For the Kings League table? Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, no, no, no, no. It is not. It is right now Petro versus Khadigali on Garvey. Oh, okay, Petro. That's still a great match. Okay, still awesome. Yeah, yeah. Of course, of course. But listen, if the life still continues, you know, there is no nuclear war or something, these matches are going to happen, you know, sooner or later. Yeah, right. Yeah, I know.
SPEAKER_04: Good stuff, for sure. Good stuff. Yeah. Anyways, so let's go to the next one. Are you familiar with Leonidas from Germany? Do you remember? He does usually the... Yeah, so he's the bodybuilder. He's the guy that's pulled... Yeah, he's the one that beat Larry Wills. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, I don't have first-hand experience. I don't think we've personally ever met, but I've seen some of his matches for sure. Super...
SPEAKER_00: Kind of like Mike Alejo. Mike, yeah. Just super strong upper body, big triceps. He does a lot of bench pressing, but obviously a good arm wrestler.
SPEAKER_04: he's pulling and he's pulling he is he's gonna pull a school boy oh okay but there's just one second i want i want to ask you something you had a training with letter wheels yeah yeah and larry wills also did some thing you know against thunders you know he was like wearing you remember that match also i heard larry was doing good
SPEAKER_04: at the training or something against Derek Smith like this so and then whenever this Leonidas is beating Larry without losing any round and he's also getting better and better so do you see like this guy is not like some people say that he's not like like
SPEAKER_00: He's not good? Is Alex going to be the favorite going in in most people's mind? Are people saying that he's not capable of even giving Alex a match? Is that what you're suggesting? Yeah, it looks like everyone says that a schoolboy is going to just... Kill him? Wow. Well, if a schoolboy kills him, that's a lot for a schoolboy because I feel like Larry's kind of...
SPEAKER_00: know not careful at at you know my level so yeah yeah yeah yeah being able to beat larry i mean yeah he's definitely capable so you are saying that this guy if he somehow gets the matching yeah yeah so it's gonna all depend on the hand and wrist i mean alex is definitely probably more
SPEAKER_00: aggressive and and and technical as far as the top roll goes and so i mean but yeah i mean you never know i mean yeah if it goes wrist to wrist i i don't see why not i mean he's he's proven that he's stronger than anybody yeah yeah yeah i see that yeah uh told paul hutchins he says engine versus birthing one last time yeah
SPEAKER_04: Listen, listen, last time we pulled in Norway,
SPEAKER_04: it was like none of my ever intention you know the organizer like he's like let's do like a legend something you know and i i just had the bicep tear and i was like no i mean even if i didn't have the bicep there i cannot really do anything the guy is just naturally you impressed me i and i was probably 105 ish 106 107 i mean if i had a diet to 95 kilos
SPEAKER_00: i would have a hard time handling you again it would be a serious it would be a yeah you told me the same thing after the match you said that you said that like uh you felt my pronator uh tough you know i remember yeah you said yeah yeah breaking your wrist was impossible that was just my my ability of applying a lot of side pressure with keeping my hand high that was able to
SPEAKER_04: To overcome you. Yeah, just one round that I really started with the roll. And I was like, you know, normally, John, all my career, I was the hunter at the table. You understand? I'm the one that has the better coordination than the openers. If they beat me, they beat me with...
SPEAKER_04: so much raw power you understand but whenever i did that and then like i couldn't move i couldn't move because if i hit with all pronation with all my power i would lose the wrist if i would just try to concentrate your pronator i would lose the pronator so i was like like this and then i could i couldn't move anywhere like that
SPEAKER_04: I remember it was very awkward for me too. I was almost like I was doing like a little, the only thing that really worked was like a tricep press or some weird stuff that I just don't typically do. Yeah. But I can tell you, yeah. Yeah. Your, your coordination, the synergy of muscle group is just incredible. You just probably need a little bit shoulder and yeah, probably. I'm talking about the, not about me, but about the, your, your category top guys, you know? Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: yeah i just i just need to figure out how do you somehow get this uh achiness arthritis under control but yeah just just trust me i'm not teaching you anything i don't have anything to teach you but just a little bit about blood flowing more activity blood flow daily base daily with blood flow with rubber bands a little bit of waste but not heavy trust me whenever it is moving that the pain will be gone now you have so much damage for like 40 years now you are not moving
SPEAKER_04: so that thing is gonna come uh heavy this is but i will tell you something just you to destroy not to destroy but beat the best guy in your category is just you may lose to fifth place in your category if you are feeling bad but there may there may be a day that you may be feeling good just three months and you train at your best and then you can you can beat the best guy in your category yeah it is totally because it's not
SPEAKER_00: It's not constant, to be honest. It's not constant how you feel. Yeah, no, I have my good days. And as long as mentally I can go into thinking that I have a chance, that I can be competitive, then I'm going to say yes. I'm going to continue to try. But it's just been more and more difficult to really put the proper effort into training because away from the matches, I just like to cut.
SPEAKER_00: go out in the backyard and do whatever, it's like, I'm not going to do it just because I know, I mean,
SPEAKER_04: I have a hard time putting my jacket on in the morning, so it's like, I'm going out there because it's going to hurt. Yeah. Just don't force yourself. Just have the intention and do it. Whenever you feel good, boom. You don't feel good, sorry, Engin. But anytime you want to come here as a special guest, as a commentator, as an athlete, just all you need to do, I'm coming. I appreciate that. Yeah. John, can you give me one second? The battery is...
SPEAKER_00: sorry about it okay let's go the next match we told okay arson lily brandon all depends on arson i mean um brandon i'm sure has still been training hard i don't think he's ever probably you know backed away from the sport like arson has um but arson yes is going to have
SPEAKER_00: more potential genetic ability uh but rand is no slouch i mean it's it's hard for me to even think or predict i mean um yeah is it possible you should know where he is at 105 yeah at 105 kilos uh
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, no, it's not going to be an easy match for Arsene, but I would suspect that Arsene would be able to, you know, he's not going to be accepting matches if he's not in somewhat decent shape already. So I imagine that I have to give the nod to Arsene. But may he be mistaken because he didn't do anything 11 years until Dennis versus Devon match. After that, till the new year, he did some cardio. And then by the new year, he started. So
SPEAKER_04: January, February, March, and then April, he's pulling. So, like, I'm just thinking, just imagine it, one stop, one break. Like, can he have the endurance against, no way, 11 years, no pulling, three months, you're going to have the endurance. So, he better win quick. Otherwise, Brandon really may beat him, you know. Yeah. Yeah, no, I agree with all of that.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, he's probably going to get a lot better match out of Brandon than he's going to get out of me in six months. So he better be ready. I mean, he's jumping in against decent guys. Okay, the question. First, I'm going to ask the question. If you remember the time that you competed in Bulgaria and it was after your shoulder thing, you know. Oh, right, right. Yeah, I can remember. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Do you remember his shape, Arsene's shape there? Yeah, I know. He went through Tom Hutchins pretty easily that day, yeah. Yeah, do you think that Arsene at that shape could win today 105 kilos? Like, just think about, just say, Darikian, Ongarbev, you know, other guys, you know. What do you think his chance in that shape?
SPEAKER_00: I think he, I would, I wouldn't, I would say he's just in the mix. I mean, I, Davit Datacon impressed me tremendously against Hutchins and I know how ungodly strong Hutchins has gotten. Um, you know, then you've, you've got, uh, Evgeny Prudnik. I mean, there's, uh,
SPEAKER_00: Oh yeah, Evgeny Prudnik as well. I don't know, if I start thinking about everybody, I mean, he's right there in the mix, but... You can never be sure, right? I wouldn't put him like, I wouldn't say, oh yeah, no, Arsene, he could do it. He's going to be in for a little bit of an awakening that the competition has definitely gotten a little stronger. So you are saying possible, possible but not sure. Possible but no for sure, yeah. Okay, I have another question. This Dadikian, he was 105, right?
SPEAKER_04: when he weighed in. But this guy is dieting down from 260. That's what I heard. Yeah. So of course that when he is 260 and when he is 231, I mean, it cannot be the same. When he is 260, probably he's stronger because it's almost 30 pounds. You cannot lose all of them by water. You need to do diet and everything.
SPEAKER_04: What do you think, who do you think they would be? Right now in 253, Devon looks all alone, you know. And people complain why he doesn't defend his title. Like there are countless people that are really looking forward. So what do you think that, you know, Dadikian at 253, if he's 30 pounds heavier or 20 pounds heavier. He's for sure the clear,
SPEAKER_00: clear contender to have a shot at Devon. And in my mind, I think he's got a lot of the correct attributes to possibly take a win or two off Devon, whether or not he could win six rounds. But he showed extremely strong cupping ability. And that's something... Todd couldn't even go... Todd couldn't go... Yeah, I mean, he just...
SPEAKER_00: He beat the act so easy. That tells me that his hand and cupping ability is so powerful. And I think, well, that's the reason Devon's going to have a hard time with LeVon. LeVon is obviously probably the best cupper in the world. But, I mean, to be able to do anything with Devon, he's got that super long arm. You have to have that hand and wrist and cup to be able to bring that arm down if you can't.
SPEAKER_00: He's going to pronate you and bleed you. Davit is one of the guys, like LeVon, that is...
SPEAKER_04: Top, top, top in that category. Yeah. In 105, probably Prudnik versus Davit would make the toughest match. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, Prudnik, if he can maintain his wrist and get it hooked, he's, I would say, maybe even a possible advantage. But, yeah, he would be successful. But don't you think that if Todd Hutchings hooks, Prudnik can also do it?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I don't know why Todd's hook failed him in that situation when Dada kind of surged like that because they seemed to be kind of wrist to wrist, but it may be the fact that he was also kind of, you know, hooking a little bit of turn on the hand to flatten the hand out. But yeah, no, Davit's no slouch. I mean, he's not going to go down easy. No, no, no. But what I'm just saying is if Todd could put him in hook,
SPEAKER_00: Prudnik probably would put that again in hook as well because his hand and wrist is even more. It's so explosive. I mean, yeah, yeah, yeah. But Todd, yeah. Todd was having to give up a lot to stop that. He was coming across the table and trying to, you know, um, yeah, he wasn't, he wasn't beating them to the punch and keeping them on his side of the table. So,
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, no, definitely a good match. I mean, right there is, you know, well, Prudik's already had a shot. Prudik versus Dadikyan. Prudik, Dadikyan, Devon, Dadikyan are the matches, right? Yeah, I agree. Correct, correct. Okay, let's, a few matches left. We talk about it. Michael Todd versus Frank Lamparelli. Frank is the one that pulled Matt Mask. You remember? Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I mean, it's going to be different for Frank. I mean, I'm going to feel for Frank. I think he's going to probably get position off the go.
SPEAKER_00: feel like he's super comfortable, has the wrist in control, and he's on his side of the table. I see the same thing. And then he realizes, shit, this sucks. I'm in trouble. So we see the same thing. He is having the control, but the finishing power, if he can do it, he can win. If he cannot do it, then he will be in trouble. So, I mean, I can see the match going first two rounds to Frank, and then Michael figures out how to turn it around. And once he turns it around, it'll be...
SPEAKER_04: He'll have the endurance and heart to be able to finish it. Another great match. Do you remember the guy Aydar Khan? Nur Dalet Aydar Khan. He pulled against Vala Ishkiti. He beat him sideways, the Kazakh guy. He's going to pull this time against Davit Samushia.
SPEAKER_00: Davit Camus is our seven-time champion, you know, the Georgi. Okay, so this is, okay, maybe I don't know. Who is the bigger guy that beat, was it Petro or who was it that the other one? This is 187.
SPEAKER_04: Okay, 187, so smaller version of the... Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, Davit Samushia won all of his 85-kilo matches. He got two belts permanently, and he's also holding a belt with one win. And so now he's going to put against Aydar Khan, but if you couldn't remember, then... Yeah, maybe I don't remember him then. Yeah. Okay. Exactly. Georgi Tsvetkov versus Alex Kurdecha.
SPEAKER_00: Alex looks so good the last match. Well, so did Georgi. Just another great match. I have no real prediction on that or no thoughts on how that one would go. I mean, Georgi's definitely proven that he can fight with even the best. I mean, Devon, as far as the back pressure and the hand control and going outside, I don't see Alex trying to hook him, so...
SPEAKER_00: his move, his strength is going to be something I think Georgi can deal with. So I just see, I see that just as a outward, both outward pulling stalemate for, and then whoever can outlast the other. Uh, uh, yeah, I don't think it's going to be a flash match. Um, it'll, it'll be one of them stuck in the middle fighting for the hand grip in the strap. I suspect, I mean, I,
SPEAKER_04: Neither one of them, to me, has shown anything inside, so I don't see it going there. I have a question for you. July, East versus West 13. I said Jerry Cadoret versus Vitaly Laletin. People think that Vitaly is going to smoke him. Do you also think that way, or...
SPEAKER_00: People say that Vitaly's hand is so strong that Jerry cannot go, but Jerry is not going to sleep this way. Jerry is going to, you know, it's very hard to hold it this way. Jerry is going to quickly put Vitaly's arm in a bad position at an angle. Vitaly relies on his size, his height. Talking about strap or without strap?
SPEAKER_00: It'll have to go the strap. Jerry's not strong enough in the hand to... So you are saying that Vitaly, with outside move, he cannot flash Jerry? He would have to do it and study and do it correctly and be...
SPEAKER_00: committed to pulling more sideways than he's probably used to. He's probably, you know, if he falls into the trap of thinking that he can stretch Jerry out by pulling backwards, I think he can get himself into some trouble, some serious trouble. But if he stays tall and relies on coming forward a little bit more than going backwards, then I think he's going to have a better chance to beat Jerry. But
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, Jerry's one of the few styles that is going to shut down those tall arms if they don't play their cards right. If Vitaly doesn't do the right things and talk to the right people, an instinct's going to take over.
SPEAKER_00: feels normal to him and what he's done his whole life. So it's going to be hard to convince him differently that don't do that with Jerry. But he'll learn. He'll get the experience and it'll be a good match. Listen, whenever you say he'll learn, it sounds like he's going to lose. Yeah, no, I mean, I'm not going to say he's going to lose, but I think he's going to realize he's in for a lot tougher match than he expected. John, I know you like the...
SPEAKER_04: gamble bet yeah you know yeah i know you have hundred dollar where is it going that money between vitale and jerry yeah oh man
SPEAKER_00: I'd have to go with my countryman. I'd have to go with Jerry. I mean, I think it's going to be really ugly. But Vitaly is susceptible to getting shoulder pressed. I've seen it. It didn't happen this last time with Dave, but I know that I can see it in my mind that it's a possibility. And I guess it depends on who shows up. They're both so unpredictable as far as, I mean, Vitaly just keeps getting bigger and bigger. And it just depends on how...
SPEAKER_04: how strong Jerry is. I mean, if Jerry comes in like he did against Ermes, then, you know, I'm going to change my mind. Did you, did you, did you, but listen, Ermes really hold low, and he pressed with this side of his hand. Ermes, Ermes. Yeah, he was very smart.
SPEAKER_00: Ermes did the right things, yeah. I'm not sure if Vitelli has the same ability of this one. Correct. His arm is going to move. I don't think in three, four months he can build here, you know. No, I mean, Vitelli's somewhat built like Devon. If he just watches videos of how Devon's been able to handle Jerry recently, I think he could figure it out. Yeah, he doesn't need to press, like tricep press, but he needs to stand tall and stay forward.
SPEAKER_04: and force the issue sideways into Jerry's arm, so he can't, you know, get that angle. Okay. Anyways, okay. Nate Ballantyne says, we need to see more of John. Whenever he's ready, we are not going to put any pressure on the Goats. Whenever he is our treasure, you know, whenever he's ready.
SPEAKER_00: the doors are wide open. Whenever he's not ready, we are not gonna put pressure on him. Right, okay, cool. Are you still, is it, you said July for Eastward versus West. Istanbul and August is Florida.
SPEAKER_04: okay we need to make it we need to make a dream team north american dream team devon john michael todd you know todd hashings we need to make okay so is is this what is this east versus west in july it going to be mainly an east qualifier before you're going to send this team to florida in the following month or is that is that in july we have the east qualification of all those qualification events in europe
SPEAKER_04: And then the finals will be there. But I think the West qualification is April 27 in Florida.
SPEAKER_04: So when you say East vs. West 13, it's not really going to be East vs. West tournament in Istanbul? No, no, no, no. It will be East vs. West Supermatch. But the day before, there will be the qualification event. The winners from Switzerland, Italy, Latvia, all those countries, they will come. The winners will be invited later for the Supermatch. And Florida, August, will be East vs. West 14. And you're doing that at the end of the month, end of August?
SPEAKER_04: like something like 17 because in the one week later is waffles okay yeah i hope it works with you because it's very i've got yeah no that might not work for me because i got my houseboat um vacation i think like 13th through the 13th through the 20th so i might have built i've been able i might be able to rest until like november oh come on come on okay let me think about it i just don't want to put on the same date with
SPEAKER_00: but we can talk about it. Okay, this one is important. Ermes Gasparini versus Alizhan Morado. That's the Kazakhstan that I was thinking of that I met recently. There is a powerful beast. I don't know. We all know that he's the best, just crushes anybody and everybody left-handed, but is his right arm just as good? Is it going to be right arm, right, or
SPEAKER_04: Left arm, left arm. Right arm, Ermes would destroy him. Destroy him. Oh, okay. So this is a left-handed match? Left hand, yeah. Ermes, yeah, his left arm is also very good. And this guy is just going in. You know, he's not attacking like Morozov did to Ermes' hand. And Ermes was kind of exhausted after the Sheffield match. And so I'm sure that...
SPEAKER_04: Alizhan horsepower stronger, but I don't think that Alizhan has ever meet as technical guy. Yeah. Like the, you know, speed and, you know, I mean, you can apply the same power, but if you are like more coordinated and.
SPEAKER_04: You know, I don't think that Ermes is any slower than Alizhan. So I really don't know where it's going. Ermes says he's going to be 286 pounds. He says that because he's getting ready for Dennis in June. So he says that there is no way a 230-pound guy is beating him. He says he's going to do probation training and then send him home. Better record that so we can play it back. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Lee, you sound like Ermes is going to lose. I just, yeah. I mean, I guess I haven't been as much of a fan and follower of Ermes' left hand as maybe I should, but the other guy has definitely been super impressive. Every time I've seen him pull, I was like, oh my Lord, is anybody going to be able to stop him? Yeah. So who's winning?
SPEAKER_00: I would hate to ever vote against Ermi, so I won't say. Okay. You basically are saying Ali Can is going to beat him. Yeah. I mean, in my mind and my thinking that, boy, until he stops, I got to go with that train going in that direction. He's got the momentum. Yeah. Okay. Let's come to the last one and the main one.
SPEAKER_00: Devon Larratt versus Le'Veon. They both obviously are looking like they're taking it very seriously. I was a little worried about Le'Veon, what his condition would be after the injury. But he's looking bigger. I don't know what his weight is, but he looks bigger than he's ever looked and lifting more than he's ever done. And Devon, to me, I don't know. He doesn't look like he's
SPEAKER_00: I mean, he's still, what, four weeks out, five weeks out? He hasn't shown quite the fire that I've seen him have in the past, so I'm a little worried that maybe he's figured out a combination that he feels really comfortable and he's at his strongest. I mean, the last time that I saw him and pulled with him, he just keeps getting stronger, and I know he's motivated to, you know,
SPEAKER_00: to do anything and everything that he possibly can to be victorious. The last video I saw, he said, I think if I didn't misunderstand, he said, Levan, you might not get even one round. That's what he said. Yeah. I mean, he knows what to expect now. I think you have to give it, Devon's going to, you know, I'm sure he's, ever since their last match, he's analyzed every aspect of it.
SPEAKER_00: Even if they both come in at the same, exactly the same people that they were in the last match, I think the situation, I mean, as long as Devon doesn't get hurt the first round, I mean, that could have completely played out completely different. I mean, everybody said, oh, Obama's so dominant, dominant. But, I mean, all it takes is just a little tiny bit or a little change up or, you know, or not getting hurt or maybe not, you know,
SPEAKER_04: I'm having it, you know, be manipulated a little bit more or whatever. And that, that could have, that match could have changed. So yeah, but John, I'm not going to be surprised either way. John, like you remember their match and then remember the, he beat Prudnik and then Sandris and the, the, again, the match happened and then Dave Sheffield and then Ermes and Dennis and Georgi Tsvetkov. To me, I,
SPEAKER_04: It is not the same Devon that pull Devon. After this, because you and I, we didn't have so many stem cell therapies. I had only one. I don't know how many you had, but this guy had like maybe 15 different therapies. And I saw with my own eyes, I was in Dubai.
SPEAKER_04: One of the rounds, he did, with the start, flop wrist press directly to Dave Sheffy. Like, normally, with his elbow condition and everything, he shouldn't be able to do that. You understand? So right now, if you realize, he's closer. You remember, he was more like this every match. Look at his last matches. You know, Gelgi match, he was a little bit extended. But other than that, with Dennis match, he was close. Ermes match, he was close. So I don't think that we see the same Devon. And about the physical strength,
SPEAKER_04: he told me that with his you know the pronation lift he did 135 last time he pulled 11 this is what he told him right and now he's doing 160 so it's almost 20 more so that is that risk of levan will have 20 more pressure most likely right yeah so yeah i mean and he was injured you know that one was injured i don't know how how much he recovered but we will see yeah and and you're i mean that's going to be the match
SPEAKER_00: It's not going to be how strong LeVon is, side pressure or upper arm strength or elbow. It's going to be his cupping ability. Can Devon's back pressure and pronation be stronger than LeVon's cupping? And if it is, Devon will win. If it's not, LeVon's going to turn Devon's hand upright, and he has plenty of strength to beat him if that happens. So that, to me, is the match. If Devon can maintain this, he's good.
SPEAKER_04: he gets this he's bad okay the question is the question is after levan's injury do you think that it is possible him to be even stronger than before or the best thing he can do is the same condition after that injury only he knows that i mean if he still lingers a little bit he's had to
SPEAKER_00: pull back a little bit. But do you believe that Levan's risk from that time to this time would improve 20%? Could be stronger, could be a lot stronger. I mean, he's had the stem cells and he's had plenty of time to recuperate and I mean,
SPEAKER_04: You know, what doesn't kill you normally makes you stronger, right? Isn't that the saying? So you are saying that is it possible, like, if Devon improve here 20%, do you think that Devon also could improve 20% the risk? Yeah, yeah, of course. Yeah. I don't believe that the risk can go that much. There needs to be something.
SPEAKER_04: That really is something special because Levan was already like up to his limit. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Because Devon has changed because his injuries are fixed. I will tell you something. Most of our problems are because we are not able to use some of the parts because we are injured. But when those parts come, you know, it just gives you not hormonal power, but because you are healthier, you understand? And then I kind of think that Devon's...
SPEAKER_00: back pressure and pronation improved more than Levan's wrist. This is what I believe. So even if it is 10% more, yeah, okay, sorry. Yeah, no, but he still has to deal with the size issue, right? I mean, even with Devon's new strength and ability, he had a hard time with Georgi. I mean, so I don't, he's...
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, he's going to still have to play the endurance card, right? I don't see him having that much strength to really put that big of a man in a bad position off the go. He's going to have to be calculated and get in a good spot and wait him out. Yeah. It's going to be good. I don't know if Devon's preparation, which is four weeks after the Dennis match,
SPEAKER_04: for for georgie match i don't know his preparation for that match was as much as his preparation that right now he's having for uh levan like mentally physically yeah yeah i don't i don't see things like that like i don't see somebody getting out of shape in two three weeks four weeks after a real hard preparation in fact from my experience a hard preparation a hard you know
SPEAKER_00: six months a year two years of preparing for somebody normally doesn't show the benefits until five six months after that match has ended right so i mean arm wrestling is kind of a weird thing in that respect it's not like weightlifting i think you get a lot of your your gains months after you know a hard preparation just my life so who's winning this match in your um
SPEAKER_00: I just hope it's a good match. It should be a good match. I just hope we don't get let down with an injury after the first round. I hope we end up being able to see the second round, the third round, both of them in still good fighting condition. If that happens...
SPEAKER_00: How do you see Devon's chance? The more rounds Devon can go and still be in a fierce, healthy spot, the more advantage he's going to have. We've all seen Devon having to have oxygen and suck air at the king of the table with Ermi. It's hard, no matter what kind of great shape you're in, to be pumping
SPEAKER_00: proper blood through a body of LeBron's size. So the longer the match goes, yeah, for sure, Devon's going to have the advantage in that respect. So just tell me clearly who is winning this match. Like, or who has the more chance? Just give me at least some percentage that I could understand you better. 50-50? I mean, I'm going to be, I'm going to be rooting for you. I'm not going to go out on a limb and say, oh, Devon's going to, like I did last time. I just, I mean,
SPEAKER_00: respect, just out of respect for LeVon, the guy's the man, right? And he looks like he's ready for this match again, and he's training and big and strong, and so he's probably going to have to be the favorite. In this case, I guess I'm going to root for the underdog. I'm going to root for Devon. I think it would be fun for arm wrestling. Not that he's not already the champion in numerous classes, but
SPEAKER_00: just to shake things up a little bit. Yeah, but that's what you want. Yeah, yeah. I want just pure mind answer. I kind of did in a roundabout way. I feel like LeVon is still probably going to be, unless proven wrong, he's got to be still a favorite. I'm not going to say the strong favorite. I'm going to say the favorite, especially in the early rounds. Like 55-45 or something?
SPEAKER_00: No, not even that. Okay, 55-45. Sounds good. I'm not really clear on the percentages thing. But as long as Devon can make it to the second and the third round without having to change his whole game plan because he got tweaked, I'm not going to give up on him even after the second, third round. Okay. Okay.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, because Denis and I think Laletin said that he would bet on Devon. And Denis also thought that there is possibility Devon to win, if I'm not mistaken. And you are saying that it's just close, the 55-45 or something. So you are not like one of those that Devon doesn't have any chance at all. Yeah, and I haven't seen or hung out with Devon to understand even what he is.
SPEAKER_00: progressed into since the last time i saw him which is shoot maybe almost six months ago or so i mean so it's um it's hard to say just going based on what i'm seeing in his matches he's definitely gotten more more and more dominant but everybody's a little different and levon definitely is a different animal yeah yeah i i talk with devon all the time and he is he has planned he has he has confidence yeah and he's already about in his shape then it's my shape and he's
SPEAKER_00: planning to make everything in this last six weeks to get stronger but yeah yeah if anybody's got it figured out i'm sure devin's got to figure it out as far as timing and being able to you know rest properly i mean that's that's the downfall of a lot of a lot of new arm wrestlers they they want to get that little extra in before a match and that i think that that little extra training is going to make you know make the difference and and across that line and doing you don't doing damage instead of
SPEAKER_04: of being well prepared, but I think Devon's got it figured out, so he'll be in top form for sure. I understand. Okay, John, thank you very much for your very valuable time.
