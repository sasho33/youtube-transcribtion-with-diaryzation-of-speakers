SPEAKER_02: Let's start talking about these matches. Let's see. Let's start with this one. This one is very interesting. Do you know Nugo Nugzari Chikadze?
SPEAKER_02: Dino? No, Nugo, Nugo, from Georgi. Ah, no, I don't know. The guy that the Europeans last year beat, Krasimir Kostadinov, he toppled his wrist. You don't know him? Maybe I saw... He's pulling against Marharint. Ah, okay. Do you know him or no? Marharint? Yeah. No, his opponent. Oh, no.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, you don't know the guy, huh? Yeah, like this here. Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Got it. You know the guy? Yeah, yeah, I know him. Yeah. He's very strong in hook. He's very strong in here. Here also, yeah. Yeah, he's not strong. I don't know about his hook. Very interesting, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: yeah and he's lifting very interesting weights like 100 kilo bicep curl and things like that he's very strong guy but i don't know what he can do what do you think about marharin marharin do you think that his his wrist maybe the strongest in 105 kilo yeah his work is very strong though i didn't see them uh
SPEAKER_04: someone open him reach anytime. I didn't see it. Yeah. He even, he even hooked Revas. And if he do this, will do this, it will be, it will be, it will not expect from me. Yeah. You don't expect that somebody open his hand. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: It was very interesting. Do you remember his match with Rebas in Moldova? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, it was a surprise, huh? Yeah, yeah. Big surprise, yeah. Let's see, let's see how it will be. Do you think that this Georgi guy has a chance to beat him? Yeah, he has a chance, but I don't know exactly. It will be a very interesting fight, yeah, yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: He has a good start. Which one? Marharint or Georgi guy? Georgi guy, yeah. He has a good start. Marharint also has a good start because of his wrist. Ready, go. Boom. And the other guys are always here. Marharint always controls the pronators.
SPEAKER_02: I saw Marharint has many wins. He beat John, he beat Krasimir, he beat Dadikian, he beat Ongarbev, he beat even Zeranova. Zeranova and Lutizze. Yeah, Lutizze he beat. He beat Sabin, he beat Sandris, he beat everyone. Did he ever beat you? No. No? Did you ever beat him?
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, yeah. Where did you beat him? In Moldova? I won him every time in Moldova also. Moldova, maybe Moldova now. In Moldova, I saw he beat one match, he beat Ruslan Babayev there, one match, I think. Yeah, yeah, yeah. When I was in Moldova, Mabril did excellent.
SPEAKER_04: Moldova was two times, yeah? Oh, yeah. First time, I was first time, and I lived second time. Yeah. Yeah. And when you pull him, you don't remember when you pull him.
SPEAKER_02: And European champion in 2017, maybe 18. But how old is he? How old is Marharint? I think same like me, 35, 37. Is he? He looks younger. Maybe younger. Because I remember you even from 2008 or 2009. When was your first time? Me?
SPEAKER_02: When did you compete in the World Championships for the first time? You. Which year? Which championship? When did you compete for the first time? First time? Yeah. 2007, 2008, 2009. You mean when I started to do wrestling? To compete for the first time in the World Championships. Ah, World Championships.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah. European Champion 2008 and World Champion 2009. Okay, so 2009, Italy, you were at the World Championships? Yeah, yeah, no, no. Italy. No, I lost and... On European Champion 2009, I... You and Pascal had a long match, you and Pascal.
SPEAKER_04: I took third place, yeah. And in Italy, in World Champion, I took fourth place. I won two times, won Pascal, but took two falls. Ah, you lost, okay. But I won, I don't know, I can't hold my elbow. I don't know how the reference of the...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah. And so you are saying that Marharint has more chance to win against the Georgi? 50-50. Oh, 50-50. Yeah. So let me go to the...
SPEAKER_04: Because Georgi men have a good endurance, maybe, and play well. We will see. Okay, next one. Brandon Estesos from USA, Stoyan Golemanov. I know Stoyan Golemanov, but I don't remember.
SPEAKER_04: Brandon. So if you don't know both athletes, it's hard to compare for you. But what do you think about Sean Golemanov? Golemanov? What do you think about him? It's right hand or left hand? Right hand. Right hand. He has a stronger right arm, I know. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: And his top-roll is very good. Very good top-roll, if you remember. I pulled with him one time. When? 2015. Oh, Fia. Fia in the World Cup. In the World Cup? In the World Cup, he beat you? I beat him. It was left-arm?
SPEAKER_04: I took first place left and right. But in 2015, Malaysia, your right... No, no, no, no, no. It's not Malaysia. It was European Championship. Yeah, Fia. Fia, yeah. Yeah, is this the time that you had a long match with Spartak? Yeah. Oh, okay. Okay.
SPEAKER_02: In that competition, you won first place? Yeah. And second was Antonovic? Yeah. And the third was Spartak, right? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I remember. Okay, yeah, yeah. And I got that injury on my right. Yeah, and then you went to America to pull Tim Breslin. Yeah, yeah. And then you went to America with injured shoulder.
SPEAKER_02: mistake huh big mistake yeah anyways so let's talk about Betkili Oniani Talgat Akdev repeat Betkili Oniani Betkili Oniani from Georgi yeah against Talgat Akdev Kazakhstan yeah yeah you know Talgat from Kazakhstan
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, yeah, yeah, Talgat in 2022, he beat Oleg Dzog. Dzog, Dzog. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I remember. From Georgi, show me him a photo, please, from Georgi. What's that? Oniani. Do you remember Betkili Oniani?
SPEAKER_02: In Istanbul, when you pulled against Morozov, he also had a match with Oleg Dzok, the Georgi. Oleg Dzok top rolled him, but he defended. Betkili Oniani many times world champion. Who won? Oleg Dzok won. Oleg Dzok won, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but just remember, just remember, but remember, remember, this Oleg is top rowing. These two guys, they both go inside, so they will be hook versus. So to beat Oleg Zok, it is about the start and this.
SPEAKER_04: but now they both go inside so yeah i i think uh that's enough uh man has a more chance because when you go in hook uh with top roll you need more um level level yeah you have the more level and more you use more power
SPEAKER_04: Yeah. Okay, let's go other one. Kamil Jablonski, Tobias Sporrong. Jablonski, Sporrong. Good match? Yeah. I think the first round, Jablonski... Tobias opened with Jablonski. Jablonski is going to press...
SPEAKER_04: and win, but it's obvious to take the open reach and take the center. Yeah, you can't use center and front, you can use the press.
SPEAKER_02: It depends from the start. It depends from Tobias. Oh, Tobias' form. No, from his technique. Oh, his technique, okay. Do you think that this is a mistake? When the opponent is going like this, to do this, it is a mistake? Because you are catching the black radialis. So it's better to hit the center this way? Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Did you see the match between Wagner and Tobias, King of the Table? No. No, okay. Because Wagner is also going like this, Tobias beat him straight side pressure. Yeah. So who is winning? Left hand.
SPEAKER_04: Okay, let's go to the next one. Sandris versus Ibragim Sagal.
SPEAKER_04: Right hand. Right hand, yeah. Here I think Zagor will win. Zagor will win? I think, yeah. Zagor has more chance because he can pull like Jablonski without this threat.
SPEAKER_04: Something that doesn't have a good side depression, I think. He has a good top role, but he needs a more stronger side depression, I guess.
SPEAKER_02: Okay. Levan's massive oxygen. I can't see the rest, but why are you 70%? Come on. Bring the fire. There is a super chat. They are saying that why are you 70%? It says come strong. Okay. I will be strong in June, July. July. July. I will be 85%.
SPEAKER_02: Chris the Greek, thank you very much, my friend. Thank you. And let's go. This is very interesting. Sasho versus Irakli. Irakli? Yeah. This is a world title match. 95 kilo world title. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Really very interesting. Last time when they pulled the show on,
SPEAKER_04: But now, Irakli changed. Irakli changed and I think he has a more chance now. Because, for example, Sassou won Grosvenor.
SPEAKER_04: Half a year ago, yeah? Yeah, I mean, three months ago. That's also very interesting. Interesting, my friend. Because Sassuaro did block the formation. Yeah. He did block the down formation.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah. He's not familiar. So to beat Sasho like this is very hard. To beat him this way hard. Yeah. Maybe pull. Yeah, maybe like this. This way. But also very hard and need good endurance for this. Yes, very good endurance, yeah. And good endurance not just for one match. It's for...
SPEAKER_02: How many rounds? You need to win four times. Because of endurance? Many rounds. Is it possible that Irakli wins quick?
SPEAKER_02: Or no? Yeah. It's possible. Possible? But you are saying that if the match stops, Sasho has more chance? Yeah. We will see. And this one, Schoolboy versus Leonidas. Leonidas? Right arm. Right arm. I think Schoolboy.
SPEAKER_02: I don't fool with schoolboy, never, but I fool with ... Can you talk a little bit louder or close to the ... It's hard to hear. I have a ... Yeah, maybe, I don't know, but you need to be a little bit ... I hardly hear you sometimes. Uh-huh. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Oh, okay. Okay, yeah. Sing for us. Opera. We have a...
SPEAKER_04: I forgot about what. You what? What did you ask? I asked you Leonidas versus Skullboy. Ah, Skullboy. I think Skullboy has more chance. Skullboy has more chance. You can even sing us. When you tell your opinion, you can sing us. Skullboy has more chance.
SPEAKER_02: Okay. Okay. Fia Rajsek versus Ekaterina Nikisheva? Fia. Fia? Fia Rajsek. Fia Rajsek, yeah, from Sweden. Sweden. I think Fia Rajsek. You think you are fair, okay.
SPEAKER_02: No, no, because he didn't finish my career. I pulled John Brzenk and Rymond Liepins after that. There's another. Mindaugus Tarasaitis versus Artur Makarov. Artur Makarov and who? Mindaugus Tarasaitis versus Artur Makarov.
SPEAKER_02: What did you think about Mindaugus? Mindaugus? Yeah, what did you think his last match against Daniel Prokopchuk? He's a very technical guy. He's a good technique.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, smart guy. Yes, he's very smart. And he will pull with who? What's that? Have they pulled before? Again, pull. Artur Makarov. Ah, Makarov. Makarov is very strong and very difficult. He has a difficult technique.
SPEAKER_04: I think Makarov has less chance. Less chance? What did you say? Mindaugus has more chance? Yes. Interesting.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, so let's go to the next one. Michael Todd versus Frank Lamparelli. Michael Todd, Lamparelli.
SPEAKER_04: He will be better control wrist. Oh, he will have more control with the hand? Better control? Yeah. But can he finish?
SPEAKER_02: But he can finish, I think. You think he cannot finish? He can finish, yeah. With Michael Cook. So you are thinking Michael is going to win? Yeah. Hmm. Okay. Davit Samushia vs. Nurdaulet Aydar Khan.
SPEAKER_04: Samushia, you know that Samushia has a level like you. Level what? Level. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Level like me. Yes. So his hand is, forearm is very tall.
SPEAKER_02: I remember you had a match with him when you won the Zloty. I think Samushia was third place and Sandris was second, right? He had a very long match with Sandris, I remember. Evgeny, I want to ask you something. Will you be a champion again?
SPEAKER_02: What do you mean? In 105 kilos, you will become champion? You think? In the World Championship? In the East vs West? Yeah. You will become champion again? Yeah. Yeah. When?
SPEAKER_04: i will start in july july you will win the first match you think and then you will continue winning okay but left arm was alijan very strong yeah i need more uh more time more time now i think that is on um
SPEAKER_04: The world champion, absolute, is Wes Dolphin. You think he can beat Morozov? He can beat Morozov, he can beat Laletin, he can beat everyone that can. Really? Yeah. Okay, we will come there. Maybe. Is it because of his speed? No, because...
SPEAKER_04: He has the arms, he has the arms. He has a strong wrist, the fingers, he has the speed, he has endurance, he has the power. Okay, one question. Matushenko is going to pull Morozov in June 1st. Who is winning there? Matushenko, I think Matushenko. Matushenko will beat Morozov, you think? Left arm?
SPEAKER_04: I think, yeah. That's interesting. Okay, let's go to the next one. Alex Kurdecha. Very interesting fight. Kurdecha now has more experience and improved. And now he feels very well.
SPEAKER_04: He up his level?
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, he needs to up his level. I mean, no level. I mean, he needs to up his rate. He up his rate? Rating. Rating. Rating.
SPEAKER_02: Evgeny, can you talk without the... Are you there, Evgeny?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I can talk with you guys, but I don't want to just start talking. And then in one second later, Brunig is coming in. Okay, he's coming back, I think. I know. Yeah. Yeah. Rating. Rating. Rating? Rating. Rating. Rating. Okay. Yeah, but how did he increase his rating? He didn't compete two years.
SPEAKER_04: I mean, now, Sipol has a higher rating than Kurdecha, yeah? OK, basically, Brodnig, who is winning? Alex Kurdecha or Georgi Strivatko? Georgi Strivatko is a very difficult opponent.
SPEAKER_02: I hope that ... Can you hold your ear pod and talk like this? No? No. Hello? Yeah, it's better, I think. It's better? I think, yeah. I don't know. Let's see how people hear. One, two, three, four. Yeah, I mean, yeah, I think people hear.
SPEAKER_02: Let's see what they say. I hope that Kurdecha will win. Yeah, they say better. You hope or you think? I hope. But what do you think? I think 50-50. 50-50 match? Yeah. This is your mindset, but you want Kurdecha to win? Yeah, yeah. What kind of problem do you have with Georgi?
SPEAKER_02: Why do you hope Alex to win? Is it because Alex is your friend or you have a problem with Georgi? No, because Alex is my friend. Because Alex is your friend, you want him to win, but you see a very difficult match 50-50. Okay, let's go. Alizhan Morado vs. Ermes Gasparini.
SPEAKER_02: Alizhan lost. Alizhan lose? He will lose five times. Alizhan will lose five times? Yeah. You say that Alizhan can beat Morozov, he can beat Laletin, but he's going to lose to Ermes. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: You serious or no? Yeah, yeah. But Gasparini, I forgot about Gasparini. He has a left arm stronger than right. And now, he will win.
SPEAKER_02: Engin, don't forget Superchat please. I already told him, my friend. Were you not here? I told him already. I read your Superchat. John Palmieri. Engin, what is your opinion about Minde vs. Makarov title match? I believe Minde will retain the title. Do you agree? My friend, I don't want to just say. I only talk about Devon vs. Levan match.
SPEAKER_02: Other than that, I try not to talk so much, but I mean, if, I mean, Makarov is stronger than Mindaugus. He will start better. He has stronger side pressure, but it is all up to one stop. One stop in a position that Minda likes, and then it will be very hard. But there is a possibility Artur to dominate him as well. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I will read one more time, you know, you said that why it is 70% Prudnik come back, you know, as strong as possible. And I told him and he said he will start by July event. Anyway, so you are saying that you are saying that Ermes is going to beat Alizhan? Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: You're thinking... No, no, no. I'm not thinking. What surprises me, you to say that Ali Can can beat Laletin and Morozov, but not Ermes. So I would like to understand why. You think that Ermes is stronger than Laletin and Morozov with left arm? Or you think it's because of his style, his technique, he will be more dangerous? No, because it's Gasparini.
SPEAKER_02: Because he's Gasparini. When you are Gasparini, you don't lose? Gasparini never lost? No, never. Never? Not even one round? No. No, no, no. It's only in our dreams. Okay, so this never happened?
SPEAKER_02: I hope Ermes is not watching you. Only if I will pull the steam, he can watch. Only you can beat him? Yeah. Okay. I have a question for you. You a little bit trained with Bacho, but you competed in the tournament, you are only 70%. Do you think that Bacho is strong?
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I tried him after Kalinchenko and I didn't feel my wrist. And he's strong, yeah. He's strong, very strong. I think I like Kalinchenko also. Hippo with Kalinchenko? No, but I think he has the same... Power? Same level? Same power, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Did you ask him his weight? Weight? Bacho. Bacho, no. I don't know. Okay. Anyway, so let's talk about the main event. Devon Larratt versus Devon Levan Saginashvili. What is going to happen? Just tell us a little bit loud. You can even sing for us while you say your opinion.
SPEAKER_04: um now larat has a more chance uh for for victory um favorite uh this much favorite is uh how how how how big favorites what percentage he is
SPEAKER_04: to win this time because it's first match after the injury first match Levan after injury and Larratt has more improvement after last match with Levan
SPEAKER_04: He has more improvement in his technique. And now I think he will pull another way. He will take another way how to move with Milan. Okay, which way?
SPEAKER_04: I think like last time, he used his lever and he upped his hand more and more. Like this, something like this.
SPEAKER_04: okay and what is his chance of winning devon's chance well it's 50 50 also oh you think like two minutes ago you said levan has more chance now you say 50 50. no no everyone has a more more chance yeah 60 40 55 45 about but uh has a good chance
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, even 45% is a good chance. The interesting thing is that when people who are at the elite level, I see that they are giving more and more and more chance for Devon. When I say more, not more than Levan, but more than before.
SPEAKER_02: People believe that he has a chance. I also think that he has a chance. I mean, you know, when you pull Devon, it is only once you stop, then problems start.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, if Levan goes and then somehow his wrist a little bit move and Devon stop and then Devon gets stronger and stronger and stronger. Not that he gets stronger, but he remains his power while the usually opponents cannot remain their power. Like Devon is somehow not really getting tired when he does his own outside move, you know.
SPEAKER_02: I see that when you were training with Kalnyshenko, you were also doing these kind of things, you know. I would prefer you to have that full wrist control type of Prudnik. Yeah. Because your hand control and everything is very, very good. Anyway, so you are saying that this match is 55% Levan.
SPEAKER_02: And 45% Devon. Yeah, if Devon will win, I will sing songs for him. You will sing songs for him? Yeah. If he wins. Okay. There is a Superchet, Mr. Cigar. Who is Prudnik's next match? He is one of my favorites. Mr. Cigar says that you are one of his favorite arm masters. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: And we don't know Prudnik's next opponent. We are trying to find an opponent. We offered a match to one of the top guys, but he was not available. So we are going to find someone else. Levan's massive oxygen. Prudnik, can you make video and sing?
SPEAKER_02: Unflappable song. Did you see Devon's song? I am unflappable, you know. Did you see his song? No? Okay, let me find for you. One second.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I think this one was it. It's this one, I think. Yeah, it's a close one, yeah. Welcome back to Canadian Idol. Next up, we have a contestant named Devon Lorette. I wonder what she's all about. Okay, bring her in, please.
SPEAKER_03: a professional arm wrestler, but Gasparini, LeVon Levan Saginashvili. So it's really, it's my honor to be here. So the song that I prepared is, so I have this big match coming up on the 20th of April, and I've erased that from people's minds. Yes, yes, yes I have. Interesting combination. Okay, well, let's see what you got, kid. Okay.
SPEAKER_03: I put my elbow down and I show you how strong I am.
SPEAKER_04: And when I take the risk, I'll show you that I am. I'm unstoppable. With Camille, it was just for faith. I'm invincible. United, nothing, nothing, nothing. I'm so powerful. From way back in the day. I'm so confident. I'm impossible today.

SPEAKER_02: I am also very motivated. Putnik, what do you think about what happened after the pandemic? There's all this East versus West, Supermatch, league, title, all the arm masters together. What do you think about all this? Do you enjoy this league?
SPEAKER_02: Repeat, please. Repeat, please. What I just stated, the American Arm Masters and East Arm Masters all the time, every one and a half months, King of the Table, East vs. West, all the time, super matches, league rankings, title. What do you think? Do you enjoy it? Do you like it? Yeah. Yeah. You like it? Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: It's good when you have a collaboration with many sportsmen, many title sportsmen. It is good that you guys are all together. Interesting, yeah. But not all time is the...
SPEAKER_04: with West. Sometimes West against West
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah. We have many East versus East matches, but the West versus West matches, I will do most likely when it is title match, because in the West, we're talking about a few countries. When you say East, you're talking about many countries. Now, I said the European Union countries also West, but it doesn't really matter. In fact, you know, it is...
SPEAKER_04: Apotheos. Answer this word, Apotheos. Its culmination is West now. It's less than 12, its culmination part. Because now strongest from the West pull it with strongest from the East.
SPEAKER_02: I think this match is the most important match in the history because now Devon is stronger than last time that they pulled. Do you agree? Do you think that Devon now is stronger than two years ago? Yeah, of course. Thank you very much, Real Slim. Another question.
SPEAKER_02: Evgeny, do you have American visa or no? Yeah. You have American visa? Yeah. Kill 2025, yeah. Kill 2025, okay. So do you want to pull in July or August or both? Both. Both, the same arm or different arm?
SPEAKER_04: I think different. Maybe same. I don't know how I feel. After the match. After the match, yeah. I understand. And is there anyone from North America that you want to compete? Yeah. Who? If left arm, maybe Larratt. Hmm.
SPEAKER_02: And right arm? His right arm may be John Bersink. John Bersink? Yeah. Would you want to pull against someone like Dave Chaffee? Can you pull against him? Or he would be too strong? No, August. August? Right, left? Probably right. Right?
SPEAKER_02: Maybe, yes, maybe, yes. Maybe, okay. Anyway, so we have so much time. I need to see the results of the East versus West 12. And then I need to see the June 1st results from King of the Table. And then I need to see which match makes the most sense. Yeah, yeah. Anyway, so... Are you going to watch the event? Huh?

So you are saying that when you were growing, you watched John Bersink, you want to be like him, and now you want your fans who are armwrestling to look at you and then become even better than you, correct? That's good, that's good, that's good. Good wishes, good wishes, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Anyways, Polunek, thank you very much, my friends. We miss you. In this event, we will miss you, but the next event, we will have you in Istanbul and maybe hopefully in Orlando. We will see. You take care of yourself and keep in touch, my friend. Thank you. The mustache looks good. Good. Yeah. Take care.
