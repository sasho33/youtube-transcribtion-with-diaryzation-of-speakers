SPEAKER_02: where she lives is six hours ahead of FIIA. And somehow we couldn't make it today. In the weekdays, it didn't fit to do this program. And then now it didn't fit to FIIA. So I decided that I do this one at a time today with Ekaterina Nikisheva. And then
SPEAKER_02: In the weekdays, I will do it with Fia. Yep. Ayane. Ayane and Dimitri will be incredible match. The first 60 kilo will be match. I look younger? I don't know. Hello, hello, Ali. Hello to Yorak.
SPEAKER_02: um how is my arm i started training i started training again this time i am not planning to stop this time i'm going to hopefully continue and i'm not getting any younger i'm almost 50. october 18 i will be 50. so
SPEAKER_02: Not many years left, so I need to do as soon as possible. If I'm gonna do something, maybe I will fail, but how can I know without trying, right? Ah, the bicep, bicep is not legendary. Bicep is torn from here, you know, just hard to do something with it. Hello, hello to St. Petersburg.
SPEAKER_02: Yep, I think very soon they will join. I think in 10 minutes, I came a little bit early. I don't know why I did that, but came a little bit early. I kind of made mistake. I say I made mistake because you guys also need to wait for the, our guests.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, experience is good. I have, but I don't know if my body will handle. Yeah, I'm back training, Edward. I hope this time I can make it. The only time I could make it was Coach Ray match, Raymond's match. No, my friend, physically, my body is just everywhere. My neck hurting, my back hurting.
SPEAKER_02: Elbows hurting, everywhere is hurting. Probably depends on your style. I think if you have hook or press style, bench press will help more. But I think that everyone should do either bench press or you need to do either push-ups. I used to do on fists, you know. But it's coming. It's coming. Inshallah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I told them to join me at 4 o'clock my time. And it is 4 o'clock, 4 p.m. Matushenko time. But it is 8 p.m. Ekaterina time. Ekaterina, where she lives. I didn't know that she lived that far east. She is a world champion armwrestler. Also her opponent FIAA.
SPEAKER_02: She is a legend, and it will be incredible match. I'm planning to do, like, if it was up to me, like, I would do just, like, every month, 10, 15 matches. I would do, I mean, I would do all kind of, all kind of matches, you know, that you would desire. But as of now, I need to be realistic. Yeah, I do full body training, but I just started now.
SPEAKER_02: I think my shoulders, my chest, everything will be good in just three months, I believe. In three months, I think I will be in good shape. After three months, I will start thinking of how to compete. I will not consider any opponent before I'm in good shape. Otherwise, it puts pressure on me. I try to get there. I set a match for two months.
SPEAKER_02: I tried to get ready that that is not what my body wants. My body wants to have no pressure and slowly get better and better and better. And then once it reaches to near limits and then say, okay, let's talk about a possible match. I'm not young anymore. I'm not sure exactly where she leaves, but let me check.
SPEAKER_02: Maybe she wrote her Instagram. Okay, it is written, but let me check the translation. I don't see where she lives. Let's see how many times she says world champion. One second.
SPEAKER_02: She is two times world champion, four times European champion, and six times Russian national champion. Yeah. Maybe, maybe. Maybe they will train. I don't know. Ermes and Alex, they are in Italy, as you said.
SPEAKER_02: Slow progression to compete, you will do amazing. Yes, yes, I need to go slow. I need to be ready mentally, physically. I need to be ready. If I'm not ready, then I will have a lot of doubts and I won't feel good. Coffee with a lot of milk.
SPEAKER_02: Engin put perfume and shaved his face just for Ekaterina. That's not true. I have never been that kind of guy. I many years competed WAP, Europeans. After every Europeans WAP, there has been party. What I did was go to competition, check my weight, weigh in, go to my room, rest, compete. After the event, no party, nothing, just go to room.
SPEAKER_02: rest and come back you know i have always been a guy on mission hello nate hello my friend good morning to you yep mental part is very important you need to be ready you need to believe in yourself especially if you are far away you know from top you coming back you just need to
SPEAKER_02: probably I need to do a lot of table training, a lot of table training. Then I will need to see myself with my teammates who are at the world level, such as Arif Ertem. There is no way for me to beat Arif, but he can tell me, you know, like my shape, what he feels, you know.
SPEAKER_02: Right now all I care is to bring our medicine to the next level. That's all I care. Nothing more than this. I mean, of course, this is not something I can do by myself, but I can do my best and then see how much it helps.
SPEAKER_02: yeah jeff the vision you have in your mind that works and it worked when i was young but at this time you have the vision you have the desire but your body can handle another thing is that i don't think it is that easy to make two things uh two world level things at same time being an organizer at this level and being an athlete also in same level i mean i'm i'm not a boss or something i'm doing
SPEAKER_02: lot of things by myself you know i'm really there are people helping me as well but i'm just all my day is just about east versus west so it is not that easy for me to focus um as an athlete i don't think that if you just say who is that just think about top athletes in other combat sports they can't be doing what i am doing as an organizer and be successful as enough at the same time it would be very hard very hard
SPEAKER_02: No, I'm coming to Georgi. I even buy the tickets on 15th. I come to Georgi on 15th till 19th. I told to Levan and Levan was like, oh, only four days. You know, I was like, I need to really work for East versus West too. I said, it's my friend. And he said, okay, you know. I mean, I have many food that I like. I don't think there is one favorite food, but.
SPEAKER_02: A lot of them. For sure I like to eat bread and cheese together. Yeah, you're right, but we need to do more and more. More, like I want to see something much bigger.
SPEAKER_02: can go to just you need to make the rest of the world see arm wrestling through your eyes through my eyes then they will be how to say become they will become fans if they will win will win
SPEAKER_02: they call it king's move i think this is just like i don't see anything like king you know it's just something that devon tried to make people i mean the the name father of this is direct simits but uh the pink i mean just i mean in our messing that that is the probably the last thing that i would call king you know the king should be representing
SPEAKER_02: this no and this is garbage this i understand this is open on top yeah this i understand but still not the king it's not the ideal way to our muscle this this is for sure garbage this is acceptable you know but i call it open on table um ivan matushenko will be translating
SPEAKER_02: I think somebody came. I think that is Nikisheva or Matushenko. Let's see. Hello, Ekaterina. Hello, Venget. Hello. Can you, is it the side way, the phone? Aha, okay. Yeah. Very soon, very soon, Ivan is coming. Let me just.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, he already came. Good. So how are you today, Ivan? Good, thank you. You waiting for your kids in the course or lesson? Yes, yes. What kind of lesson is that? Region club.
SPEAKER_02: What club? Reading. Reading. They read books and discuss them. Oh, that's good. That's good. Yeah. I would expect nothing from such a smart father. Not so smart. Ah, to me, you're smart. A lot of people think you're smart. So can you ask? Okay, she's gone. Okay. So let's talk when she comes back.
SPEAKER_02: we have one hour i will do a different uh separate uh meeting with fear isek yeah he didn't feature and there is there is six hours difference between where where does he live do you know i'm not sure uh maybe novosibirsk okay okay
SPEAKER_01: okay let me see if anything is wrong with your connection or something let me anyways so how is how are trainings um it's okay you know golfer's elbow it always bothers me
SPEAKER_02: Can you ask her where she lives? Because we are not sure. Because it's four hours ahead of Moscow time. So it's very interesting. It must be very near to Korea or something. Angel asked me where I live. I assumed it was Novosibirsk. Yes, Novosibirsk. Far from Moscow. Far from you. I remember correctly. Yes, yes, yes. Correctly, yes, Novosibirsk.
SPEAKER_01: Where is it? Novosibirsk is far in Siberia. So she is in the north? Yes, in the north. Very cold area. Does she live somewhere near to where the Latin lives?
SPEAKER_00: 800-900 kilometers. For them it is close.
SPEAKER_02: For that reason, it's rather close, but not for us. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I understand. And can you tell her for how long she has been inactive? Like, I remember her competing, maybe some championship, but when was the last time she competed? Tell us, please, when was the last time you fought? How long did you have a break? Well, it turns out...
SPEAKER_00: With pregnancy and giving birth to a child, four years, I didn't compete in such big competitions as Russia. Only Siberian Bear was able to go out, because it's not far from here, you can take your child with you, light flights are not long. Therefore, four years without such big competitions have passed.
SPEAKER_01: So it's almost four years she was inactive just some a couple of tournaments not far from here like Siberian Bear. Okay. So she competed but she didn't train hard so that's all
SPEAKER_01: because of the baby. Now she is very motivated as you invited her to the event. Can you congratulate her and her husband because of the baby?
SPEAKER_00: Happy birthday. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And can you ask her when she started to train now for this event? Well, it's probably all together, it turns out, from October-November of the month. It's been almost 3-4 months, yes. I started to prepare. Well, there I just went to the Siberian Bear to check.
SPEAKER_00: How is my training going? It's much better than last year. There are, of course, nuances that need to be improved, corrected, gain strength. But again, my weight is still less than it usually was. Now I've reached 64-65 kg, I've gained weight. In the last 2-3 years, my weight hasn't increased by 62 kg. So now I'm trying to gain a little weight and, accordingly, strength.
SPEAKER_01: She's been training since October-November, so for 3-4 months already. She went to Siberian bear to check herself and she finds herself better than she was in previous years. In the last years, I mean, maybe last several years. Also, she's trying to get weight. Now she's still smaller than she used to be, only 62, she said.
SPEAKER_01: 63 and she wants to maybe i'm mistaken uh she waits 64 and she wants to get some more weight so okay okay can you uh ask her like she has still six more weeks and where does she think that she will be compared to her best time
SPEAKER_01: And how do you think, how much will it be possible to return the form that was, well, your good form, competitively? It's very difficult to say, of course. How many percent, approximately, would you like and think it is possible to return? Of course, I would like to add, because I do the same weights,
SPEAKER_00: But in wrestling, I very rarely fight with someone, I come and catch a moment to catch someone from the boys, I understand that there are places where I have not yet reached my peak, because when I weighed about 70 kg and my training was full, then it was not at all scary for me not to fight in any weight category, I was ready to fight with anyone at all. But now, of course, I understand that I do not have this confidence yet.
SPEAKER_00: But maybe because I don't have much competitive experience. Well, not experience, but fight experience now. Because I don't fight with anyone for so long and I don't go to competitions. So you've almost reached your own weights? Yes, I've almost reached my own weights.
SPEAKER_00: It's difficult for her to say. Now she's working with her previous weights, so she managed to
SPEAKER_01: get to those numbers but she is not at all sure about her real strength because very little sparring and even now so she is not at all sure and mainly perhaps because of her weight because she is now smaller than she used to be she was about 70 kilograms and now 64 so she's not so
SPEAKER_01: She's not sure. Yeah, but she can still lift the same weight, huh? Yes, yes. And she doesn't have any training partners to train like she used to train? She says she tries to have some table time, but it's difficult to organize that. Yes, it's hard to organize, of course.
SPEAKER_00: And that's why it's so rare, isn't it? Rare, yes, extremely rare. It doesn't happen to me when we have guys training, because I find free time when someone with a child can sit with me. Yes, it's difficult for her to find time for that. Well, in principle, I always trained alone. We have very few girls here, in principle. Well, you know, they left us, me and my sister, in principle, no one else. And so...
SPEAKER_00: But actually here, workout routine was always mainly with weights.
SPEAKER_01: And she tries to have some table time with her husband, but her husband is rather big. His hand is very big, so it's not so close. He's also an arm wrestler. Yeah, yeah, I think I know him, yeah. And he pulled at Europeans, I think, once. Yes, Ivan, I think, fought in Europe. Yes, he was the third in Europe. With Vitaly, they were in the same category, I think, in 100 or 110. He was the third even.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, he competed at Europeans. You don't remember the date, right? Maybe the 15th year at Europeans. You mean 2015?
SPEAKER_01: Maybe. I don't remember. Was the 2015 European Championship in Bulgaria? Yes, in Bulgaria. 2015 European Championship, yes. And he was third, maybe. Okay. Which category? 100 or 110. Okay. Were you there, Ivan? I think, yes. I won left-hand 100 chan against Krissimir.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, okay, okay. Maybe. Yes, it was Krasimir in the final. Okay, I understand. And this event is going to be a left arm world title. And does she think that her right will be ready as well for the future? What do you think about the right hand? Because now there will be a fight on the left hand. How do you feel about the right hand?
SPEAKER_00: Now my right hand doesn't work at all. I even stopped lifting my biceps because my right hand hurts. I got injured in the training. Not even in the fight, but in the training. And now I can't even do it with both hands. The last time I lifted my biceps, it was two months ago, and now my right hand doesn't work at all. I don't even train it. But it was a sign for me that I only trained my left hand for now. I've never done that before. Interesting.
SPEAKER_00: Unfortunately, she injured her right hand while training with weights. So she doesn't train it for two months already.
SPEAKER_01: And usually she trained both hands even if she was getting ready for one hand. But now she thinks it was maybe even good to get ready better with her left hand. Left hand, yeah. For the future? For the future? I think so. Just time to recover and that's it. Why not?
SPEAKER_02: Yes, she thinks so. Just she needs time to heal and then she will get ready. Okay, another question. I saw on her Instagram she has two Worlds and four European titles. And can you ask her which arms, you know, she had on this? Tell us please about your achievements.
SPEAKER_01: There are two World Champions titles and two Europe titles on Instagram, right? Four Europe titles. Four Europe titles and two World titles. I wonder how many titles are on the left side and how many on the right side? On the left side, I have gold, on the World title, I have left and right titles in one, that is, in two times.
SPEAKER_00: In Europe. I won Europe in 2015 with my left hand. Then in 2019... Was it the same year? No, it was the same year. Yes, it was the same year. And I won a lot there. You know, I was in the prizes.
SPEAKER_00: So, the first time I won, I got the prizes in 2011. Since 2011, every year I had second, third, second, third, second, third. And until 2015. In 2015, I was with Irina. In 2015, you won both the left and the right World Championships. Only on the left. Only on the left and on the right I was the second. In 2015? Yes. And the second time in the World Championships, it's already... Listen, probably in 2016, and then in 2019, I missed a year or two.
SPEAKER_01: She doesn't remember exactly, but it was one time left hand world champion, one time right hand. But maybe one more in the 19th year.
SPEAKER_01: And she was many times second and third from the year 2011. Yeah. Many times second. Last time it was 2019, she won Russian Nationals, Europeans and World Championship.
SPEAKER_02: Left and right, yes. So she was going up like this before the pandemic. She was going, and now she had to stop because of the pandemic. So it was her best years, prime years, right before the pandemic, and now she had to stop. So it's good that she's coming. Can you ask her if she has ever competed in the same category with FIA RISIC? Have you ever competed in the same category with FIA RISIC?
SPEAKER_00: Yes, we met. It was about 10 years ago. I think it was 2016 or 2014. I lost to her then. To the left, right? I think I lost to the left and the right. She lost to her in 2000... She doesn't remember exactly. We met a long time ago, yes. Maybe in 2015 or... Maybe. Or earlier.
SPEAKER_01: It was long ago, she said. Okay, right or left? Maybe both. Oh, she lost again, sir? Yes, yes. Yeah, but in her last years that when she started winning, they didn't meet again. When you started winning more, you didn't meet anymore, right? No, we didn't meet anymore. I don't even know, FIA probably fought in the 65 category, and then I fought in the 70 category.
SPEAKER_02: She was not at 70 last year. She thinks maybe she was in 65. Yeah, yeah. And another question. Since her weight is around 64 or something, for the future, would she prefer to pull 70 or 60 or both?
SPEAKER_00: In the future, would you prefer to fight at 60 kg or at 70 kg? Or both? Well, 60 is probably too much, right? Yes, 60, because when I weigh 62-63 kg, I am quite the same with my height, because I am almost 180 cm tall. Well, at 70, better at 70, of course.
SPEAKER_01: 70 is the best weight for her, she thinks. 65 or 70. 60 is too small for her. Yeah, we don't have 65. She's rather tall, 180. Is she 180 something?
SPEAKER_02: About 180 cm. 178 cm. 178 cm. Okay, still very tall. Now, we don't have 65 cm, so she will be playing 70 cm, because she will be training more and more. I think she will gain a little bit of weight. Okay, that's good. Can you ask her if she has been following East vs West events?
SPEAKER_00: In general, do you follow the fights? Of course, how can you miss such an event in the world of armwrestling? Of course, I follow. Especially when our guys are fighting, we always watch and cheer. Yes, yes, she follows us to our events. Okay, okay. So, I was going to ask her, you know, about the matches, what she thinks.
SPEAKER_02: By the way, can you ask her, before we go to the predictions of the matches, can you ask her how does she see her chances against FIA? We will discuss the matches later. Engin usually asks everyone.
SPEAKER_01: And before that, he wanted to know your opinion about the upcoming fight with FIA. What do you think? What is waiting for you? What will happen? I think we will have an exciting fight with her. I think it will be a difficult fight, both for me and for her.
SPEAKER_00: She thinks it will be a spectacular and difficult fight for both of them.
SPEAKER_01: uh she watched her videos she made some uh she analyzed them found some um she has her strategy and she thinks it will be a very good fight she watched the videos where she lost to her and some other some other videos she made some some homework
SPEAKER_02: Ok, I understand. I was just checking her Instagram. Is she her toughest opponent? I would even say that I could have moved to category 70. At that time, it seemed to me that category 70 was easier for me.
SPEAKER_00: Yes, she was her hardest opponent.
SPEAKER_01: uh was very motivated to uh to pull and win her she even didn't go to upper category uh before she won her several times okay because i remember every russian championships every european always like finale you know katarina nikisheva and irina gladkaya always the final final final you know i remember that
SPEAKER_02: yes so principle by the way i was told that she said of course how can you miss catch an event about east versus west she didn't only say that she follows is it true uh is it true that she follows that she follows an event uh i'm not i'm not sure but she uh i think um
SPEAKER_02: it can be true because uh uh she uh her husband i think they uh perhaps they um yeah no but i'm just saying that you you translated like yes she follows but i there's somebody on the chat room says that she said of course i follow how can you miss such an event she said is that true this okay because you didn't translate that way i'm just checking if the guy is saying
SPEAKER_02: She said she follows. Yes, she follows. I said yes, she follows it. Okay. Does she know...
SPEAKER_02: I don't know how I should ask, but let me ask. If she follows, I'm going to ask all the names. And then if she wants to have comments, then she can have a comment. If she says she doesn't know much about these guys, you know, like we can ask about Chikadze versus Petro Marharint. Does she know them? If not, we can go to the next match. No pressure. Yes, without any pressure.
SPEAKER_01: Although you said that you follow the armfighters from the West, you probably don't know all of them. So if you don't know, let's skip it. Most of them are the ones where our guys are fighting. Of course, I know the guys from Kazakhstan.
SPEAKER_01: So let's skip. What's that? Let's go to the next one? Yes, go next. Okay, let's go to the next one. Sandris versus Ibragim Sagov. Sandris versus Ibragim Sagov.
SPEAKER_00: Well, I'll bet on Sagov. He fought so well at AMC that he just has to beat everyone in his category. Of course, we'll root for him and bet on him in the fight. Moreover, I don't know the second opponent very well.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, she knows Sagov for sure and she would support him. She liked his participation, how he pulled at AMC.
SPEAKER_01: uh and she really doesn't know much about sundries uh so so she would bet on uh but um yes she doesn't she cannot analyze because she doesn't know the details yes okay does she know uh talgat active versus betkili oniani uh talgat octave bitkili anyani
SPEAKER_01: I already know everyone here, because I can translate in the course of all the nuances. Okay, ask her. Okay, ask her. Just tell me only the percentage. 55, 45, 70, 30, whatever. Only that one. Well, that's it. Just guess who will win.
SPEAKER_02: How many percent? 100%
SPEAKER_02: Oh, that's good. That's good. The confidence is good. When people believe in themselves, it's good. It doesn't matter if they believe or not. When someone doesn't believe in you, you have to believe in yourself twice. That's good. That's good. That's good. Okay. Artur Makarov, Mindaugus Tarasaitis. Mindaugus Tarasaitis, Artur Makarov.
SPEAKER_01: Does he know Mindaugus? Does he know? Sorry. She bets on Makarov. She knows that Mindaugus is a strong guy, but she bets on Makarov. Okay, this match, Ivan,
SPEAKER_02: This might change, I think, after we even chat. It is now Irakli Zirakashvili versus Sasho Andreev. So about this one, I also ask your opinion. But maybe first ask her. Sasho Andreev. Oh, Sasho Andreev? Yes, she knows that there was a replacement. She thinks Sasho would win. Would win, OK. And you, Ivan?
SPEAKER_01: difficult to say but i would i think that a little little favorite is iraqi because he is good against the hooplers yes yes and uh before before he was only pulling this right now when somebody's going hook he just curls and beats over his grenade yes and it depends on sasha's uh form for sure but i think iraqi will be very good
SPEAKER_02: Sasho wanted this match. I offered Sasho this match for July, and he said he's ready to pull anytime soon. And when Tatachins had to cancel his match against Ongarbe, we needed a good opponent for Ongarbe. So Petro is a very strong guy. So Petro versus, you know, Irakli lost against Kedirgade, but it was an easy match, you know. I mean, Irakli took him down here.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know who.
SPEAKER_02: You know about the club, right? Of course, of course. She doesn't know Leonidas. She supports the countrymen. Yes, she supports the club. Okay, this one, Arsen Liliev is coming back and he's going to pull against Brendan Assasour. Does he know Brendan?
SPEAKER_00: Arsene is coming back, and his first opponent is Brandon. I won't say his last name. I see, I see. Arsene is not the kind of athlete who would agree to lose, right? So I think Arsene will surprise us and win, despite the fact that he hasn't played for a long time. I think Arsene is very motivated to win, and he will do everything possible for this victory.
SPEAKER_01: She thinks Arsene will be very motivated and he will do everything he can to win the match as usual. And he's not the guy who will agree to pull someone just to pull. He will do his best to win. Yeah, so it's the same as Ekaterina. If he's pulling, he's coming for serious. Yes.
SPEAKER_02: Not to lose. He's coming not to lose, yes. Yeah, yeah. And did Ekaterina pull in the times that Arsene was pulling? I think I remember Ekaterina even in Kazakhstan, 2011. So they pull in the same times, right? Yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes.
SPEAKER_02: For a very long time, we all fought at the same time. Did her sister compete before her or they started together? Because I remember her sister, I think, in 2009, Europeans, Bulgaria. But was she before her or she was before? She asks about her sister. Did she start training earlier?
SPEAKER_00: No, it turned out that we started to fight at the same time. In 2006, we both went to the Russian championship together. That was the first time I won, by the way. But then somehow I... I always trained, but I didn't leave Russia. That is, I always fought in Russia, but I didn't go to the championship. She is younger by one and a half years, and somehow these last three years, I already went to the adult, then I went to fight for about 20 years.
SPEAKER_01: So they started at the same year, 2006. They went to junior national championship. But Tatyana went to some...
SPEAKER_01: International championships. And Serena didn't for several years. Tatyana is one and a half year younger. So maybe she was more in junior. Yes, yes, yes, she only fought in junior. She fought and then she left one or two times for adults. She was even in Brazil, in my opinion, the second at the World Championship. And that's it. And then she finished fighting.
SPEAKER_01: She made a few attempts to start over, but it all stopped. Now she doesn't train at all. So she went to junior championships, then maybe once or twice she went to international senior championship, maybe to Brazil. And she became second there, as far as I can remember. And after that she stopped.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe tried for several times to get back, but now she doesn't train. I think she got ready for Russian nationals in 2017 or 2018, I saw her. Yes, maybe in 2018 I saw her. She was in Russia, I think. Yes, probably even earlier, in 2017. No, not in 2019, probably earlier. 2017 or 2018, those years, yes.
SPEAKER_00: And I think she was even in the top three in Russia, right? Yes, she was. I think she was in the top three. She was in the category of 65, not 60, but 65. I was in the category of 70. Wait, she was in the category of 70, not 65. She was in the category of 70, not 65. She was in the category of 70, not 65. She was in the category of 70, not 65. She was in the category of 70, not 65. She was in the category of 70, not 65. She was in the category of 70, not 65. She was in the category of 70, not 65. She was in the category of 70, not 65. She was in the category of 70, not 65. She was in the category of 70, not 65. She was in the category of 70, not 65. She was in the category of 70, not 65. She was in the category of 70, not 65. She was in the category of 70, not 65. She was in the category of
SPEAKER_02: and became third. Yes, when he was absent. So she trains sometimes, but not too serious. Yeah, that's why I asked, you know, maybe if she doesn't have a good training partner, maybe she would train with her sister. Anyway, so Michael Todd versus Frank Lamparelli. Michael Todd. Michael Todd. Michael Todd will win, okay.
SPEAKER_01: And Davit Samushia versus Nurdaulet Aydar Khan. Does she know them? Davit Samushia, Nurdaulet Aydar Khan, if you know them. Samushia, yes. Samushia I know, yes. Hello. Shiso Samushia, but she doesn't know. Aydar Khan. Aydar Khan, yes. Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Let's go to Georgi Tsvetkov, Ekaterina, Alex Kurdecha. Alex Kurdecha, Georgi Tsvetkov. Tsvetkov, I know, yes. Tsvetkov. Tsvetkov. Tsvetkov, okay. Ekaterina, I think Ekaterina votes for those who know. No, I know both here and there, but still Tsvetkov. Yes.
SPEAKER_01: Okay. Ermes Gasparini vs. Alizhan Muratov. On the left. On the left hand. Ermes. Ermes rarely fights on the left. Alizhan is a very strong athlete. He fought in the small category first. Alizhan, I know. I know that he fights great. I just thought he was not on that hand. But Alizhan, of course. She thinks Alizhan is the favorite.
SPEAKER_02: And she thinks he will beat with ease. He will win with ease. Oh, okay. Okay, Ermes will be very upset. One second. Hello, Ermes? Ekaterina says that Aligen is going to kill you. Just joking.
SPEAKER_02: Because Ermes doesn't like it. Ermes is super heavyweight, 130 kilos. And Alizhan is only 105 kilos. To idea, to, you know, 105 kilo guy, to beat him, he just doesn't like that, you know, opinion. So I'm just joking.
SPEAKER_00: Alizhan Muratov, I know, I saw how he fights. Especially since Ermes is not on his strong hand, as I understand. We know that he can fight. It showed in the fight with Vitalik that he can win the very top. But here, for some reason, I still think that Alizhan will win.
SPEAKER_00: Yes, I think most of them. Again, it may be convenient for some athletes, but not for others. You know it all yourself. One fights differently, so you can't say that if one athlete wins, then the other one will win too. She thinks Alizhan would win, and that's it.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, the last match, the biggest match, maybe the biggest match in history. Levan Larratt versus Levan Levan Saginashvili. It's a match, of course. We know how big Levan is, but what Larratt can do, I hope he can do something that Levan can't withstand his strength, his trickery.
SPEAKER_01: She says, we know how big is Levan, but she hopes Lerat would be able to win due to his... How to say? Not his sly, but with the...
SPEAKER_01: With some tricks, maybe. I don't know how to translate it 100%. So she supports Larratt, I think, in this match. And she would like to see him... Winning. Winning, and yes. Okay, but can you ask her, other than what she wishes, what does her mind says?
SPEAKER_00: Well, how do you think this match can happen? First of all, Larratt has a start. Larratt can... Although, damn, it's so interesting. Larratt himself is a very interesting athlete and can fight in different ways. He can surprise. I think even Levan thinks the same. How will he fight?
SPEAKER_00: She thinks that Larratt can surprise everyone and he uses different techniques and he thinks that
SPEAKER_01: Levan, for sure. Now he's thinking about how Devon would surprise him. Again, his endurance. Again, Larratt's endurance. We need to prepare Levan's mask, in case of oxygen.
SPEAKER_02: Endurance will be important in this match. Let's see how it will go. We are happy to finally have her in our event. Can you tell her that I thanked her?
SPEAKER_01: for this podcast and also for being part of our events.
SPEAKER_00: She also thanks you and she is very happy that
SPEAKER_02: not withstanding your refuses uh you went on uh inviting him uh to your event yes she's she's very she's very motivated and um yes and uh that's good that's good if she's ready if she wants to compete win you know go up you know she will always find place you know as the other elite athletes you know and before we close can you tell her to show us her bicep
SPEAKER_01: Sorry, there is some problem with my connection. We asked her to show biceps, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. She asked me to show her biceps. So, right, left, to fight on the left, right? Of course, we are probably smaller than my opponents.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah. Anyway, so thank you, Ivan. What did she say? She wants to show the lever? No, she says that she thinks that her opponent has bigger arms. Bigger arms? Yes. Okay. Anyway, so okay, once again, thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.
