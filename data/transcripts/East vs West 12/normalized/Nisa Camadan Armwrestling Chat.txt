SPEAKER_00: Aki, hello. Hello, Engin Turbo. Hello, Denver. I'm happy that you like the t-shirt. My friend, I don't, I cannot read that.
SPEAKER_00: Thank you, Misha. Essential, progressive. Hello, Engin. Will you have Morozov? Yeah, I'm planning to have Morozov podcast as well, yeah. Yeah, she will join in five minutes. I started a little bit early. Next match, she's going to compete the Europeans. She's going to compete youth class category and the seniors.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, she's very good, but still early, very early for her to be in an adult category, senior category, to be the best. Hanzo account. Okay. I will try to find it. No, no, everything is okay, my friend.
SPEAKER_00: Can you still beat Alden? I don't know, my friends. I started training today. I had some, what did I do? I did bicep. I did bicep with the barbell and then S bar. And then with the squat machine, I do all full motion. And then I did front lifts with the holding thick handle.
SPEAKER_00: dumbbell bar with the weight on one side. And then I did a finger and then some side shoulders. Yeah. I asked to Irina Makeva not long ago. Normally I was asking her every three, four months. And then once she said that she had a baby, she has a family and job, everything, she can't come back. And then I didn't, but lately
SPEAKER_00: Uh, I asked her one more time after maybe one year, and then she said that, uh, her baby is like, what's some months old, but not so big, like six months, seven months. I don't remember what she said. And she said that, but who knows, you know, so it is little bit like 10%, 15% possibility. I saw the Georgi people love you. I also love my Georgi friends. Um, yeah, Heidi Anderson, Heidi Anderson.
SPEAKER_00: was my favorite female arm wrestler when she was competing here. Hello, James. Hello, my friends. Mexico rules. In your opinion, who is the biggest star in arm wrestling? Biggest star. I mean, there are many stars we have in different categories, but probably the most famous one is Devon.
SPEAKER_00: My PR, barbell curl, my friend, I think I have done either 65 or 70, but whenever I do it, I don't do like those guys, you know, like this, you know, or I don't do this. Only forearms move when I do, only forearms. I do like, like whenever somebody asks you, show me your bicep, you don't do like this, right? You just do this. And this is how I, how I do.
SPEAKER_00: Engin greetings from Croatia. When will Nisa compete again? She will compete Europeans. Next month. Not next month. Early May. Levan style dumbbell rescores? I mean, I wouldn't call it Levan style, but probably you said this just so that I would realize what you are talking about. I mean, yeah, that is how I do it, but
SPEAKER_00: I don't move my leg, my hip, or anything, just only wrist moves. But I think maximum I did 50 kilos or something with a thick handle. I don't know, my friend, how you do that on the TV.
SPEAKER_00: Probably people who watch them, you know, by buying paper, we would know better. No, no, no. Matushenko is not scared of Morado. Scared is a different thing than thinking that I need a little bit more time, you know. It doesn't mean scared, you know. These athletes are not scared of anyone. These athletes are like dark-eyed, we call over here, you know, like they are not afraid of anything.
SPEAKER_00: Nugo and Petro Marharint will be probably next week by Raymond Liepins on the East-West Channel. I think my guest came, my student, Nisa Jamadan. How are you, Nisa? Hi. Hi. Hello, how are you?
SPEAKER_00: I think people would want us to speak English so that they could understand what we are saying. So how are you? Fine. I'm at home. How are you? Good, good, good, good. Yeah. And so
SPEAKER_00: uh for the people who don't know uh mexico rules do you know who brian shaw is if so what do you think he could bring to armistead with his popularity and his strength and commitment to training i mean he could bring i know who he is i think he could bring a lot um but uh we don't know if he if he's he
SPEAKER_00: But I'm sure that he would bring a lot. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, so Nisa, for the people who doesn't know about Nisa, can you explain to us where you are studying at right now?
SPEAKER_02: I study in Istanbul. I'm a medical student. Istanbul is so near to the city I live, Yalova. So every weekend I come to Yalova and I go back to Istanbul. Now I'm in Yalova. So you go to Istanbul, you're going to become a doctor, hopefully. Hopefully, yes. And this is your second year, right? Yes, second year. Yes, second year, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: And so when you are in Istanbul, you are training in the place that you stay? Yes. But do you have the equipment, enough equipment or? Not enough, but there are some equipments. I do what I can. Yeah. So that's why you come on weekends and then you train?
SPEAKER_00: friday and sundays you know and then you go back to uh your university yes that's the reason yes yeah can you tell us uh i i know everything i am asking but for the people who don't know uh like how you started arm wrestling when did you start and what have you done in this sport okay my big brother
SPEAKER_02: was doing armwrestling in a club in Yalova, the city I live. And just a regular day, he asked me to armwrestle with him.
SPEAKER_02: Of course, he was stronger than me. And then he said, you're strong, you should start arm wrestling. And I just went to the gym, started training without any goals, without knowing anything about the sport. Then I loved it. I continued to do it. In 2017, I started. It's been like six years. Did your coach think that you could have some chances in the future?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, he told me so. He told me so. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. That is, yeah, quite just reminded something. Nisa versus Sara at the King of the Table currently has 1.5 million views. Professional female arm wrestling is growing. Yeah, that I couldn't understand. On the same King of the Table channel, not the Mad Rose channel, but the King of the Table channel, the same,
SPEAKER_00: Ermes versus Vitaly was like last time I checked was 500,000. In your match with Sara was one and a half million. I don't understand. Some of your reels and Instagram up to 10 million, right? Views almost. Yeah. I think the last one is like 14.5. 14 million? Yes. 14 million views. Wow. I sometimes think that, you know, I mean,
SPEAKER_00: why am i trying you know just like i'm i'm trying the best guys in the world here and their videos they don't they don't uh they like only only devon videos as much as your last one but they are most likely armesses i don't think my viewers are like armesses uh one guy is asking do you know who is nisa's coach
SPEAKER_00: yeah anyways yeah so um okay after that since then what have you done what was it what are your biggest successes uh i have uh 12 national titles national championships both seniors and juniors youth all of them
SPEAKER_02: yes all of them i have seniors i have juniors i have youth category championships yes also i am european champion in sub juniors i mean under 15 age category and also in youth category under 23 age category and also i got second place at the europeans in seniors same thing yeah yeah
SPEAKER_00: Okay, there is a question. Engin, what potential did you see in Nisa when she first started big hands, strong arms, coordination? She was smart. She was very smart. That's why she's going to become a doctor. So she learns quickly. And her coordination, muscle coordination is good. And I think she's also genetically gifted.
SPEAKER_00: I don't think that she's ready to be a senior category superstar, but her future looks bright. And now she's going to go to the European Championships in Slovakia, hopefully in early May.
SPEAKER_00: And then I plan to set her against Carolina Patterson in July, East versus West 13. So let's see how it will be. Yeah. And so let's a little bit talk about what's going on in arm wrestling. Who are your favorite female pullers?
SPEAKER_00: Is there anyone that you look up to? Like, say that, like, you know, I think she's very, very good. Yeah, I think Fia Isek. Fia Isek? Yes, she's like pound for pound, I think one of the best. She's a legend in my eyes. Yeah, maybe even the best, maybe, who knows. Maybe even the best, yes. Yeah, you saw that, you know, the other day, she just jumped on the pull-up bar and then wait here, like, probably she waited like 15 seconds or something, at least, you know.
SPEAKER_00: one arm yeah it was amazing i was amazed like i didn't know that a female player would do it that easy yeah yeah i was very surprised and because i remember when i had podcast with her i asked her like can you try she said like i think i'm gonna do for you and then whenever she put on and she says i did this for you so you can see that she was not uh she was not joking yeah
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, that is a good one to look up. For sure, Fia Isaac is a legend in our sport. There are, of course, many other great legends. One person said that Andreev Volkov, maybe she can do a practice pool video with Barbora.
SPEAKER_00: Barbara would be too much for me. Maybe if I use my both arms, maybe. Yeah, yeah, she's very strong, yeah. I have seen her beating some of the world-level lightweight male arm masters. Yeah, she's very, very strong, yeah. Yeah. Anyway, so how would you describe your pulling style?
SPEAKER_02: I think other side pressure. So pronator base side pressure? Yes, yes. But it changes when the mesh goes other ways. Yeah. Do you plan to be well rounded that you can pull in hook, side pressure, top roll? Of course, of course. You would like to be able to do any style? Any style. Okay, just wait one second.
SPEAKER_00: Does it include this? That's not a style. Okay, that's good. That's a good answer before I reject you from being my student, you know. Yeah, yeah. Anyway, I was just checking, I was just testing you. If you would just say yes, that would be the last time that I would call you my student and would be the last time that you enter my gym, you know. Yeah, I know, I know. It's been six years, I know what to say, what not to say.
SPEAKER_00: But is this because something that you shouldn't say or you really agree? I really agree. Okay. Anyway, so, um, and what are the goals? The main goal is to be the best female arm wrestler on the world, including
SPEAKER_00: overall or in your category overall that's the main goal like my life goals yeah but with your size how is it possible like do you see yourself one day i mean i sorry you know you're my student but i don't see you being 70 kilo and beating someone barbara no matter no matter if you get 300 years you know in arm wrestling you know that that is
SPEAKER_00: different you know seriously sorry but i know yes in your category i understand to have that the other one that's the first goal i want to be the best in 70 kilo like around my category but maybe i won't be 70 in the future okay yeah anyway so they are asking you if if
SPEAKER_02: you make any money from armwrestling? not really like the last time i got like a little bit of money from my european champion championship
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but sometimes your club gives you some award, right? Yes, yes. And also from the king of the table, you made your first professional award. Oh, yes, yes. I forgot about that. Yes. That's the first money, big money, like I earned. Yeah, when you say big money, people will think that it's money to buy a house or something. Okay, yeah. It's not much, but it's money just. It's the first time I get money.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Anyway, so. Okay. Levan from Devon and his wife, but you're great for sure. Wish you luck. I don't know what you need to learn from Devon and his wife, but anyway, so Maxim Oliver, do you remember me?
SPEAKER_00: I don't know who you are asking, but personally, I don't remember you. Anyways, so let's talk a little about, okay, before we talk about the East versus West, let's talk a little about your possible match with
SPEAKER_00: Karolina Pettersson. Karolina Pettersson is very, very dangerous. She has European title. She has world title. And how do you see this match? She is very experienced. I think first time I saw her, I think it was 2009 Bulgaria. So 15 years ago, she was a junior puller.
SPEAKER_00: so since then she has she she gave a small break a few years i think i don't remember exactly how many but um so she is very strong and very experienced and how do you see your chance against her i don't think that she can like convincingly beat me
SPEAKER_02: But I can see myself beating her convincingly. So I think my chance is higher. Also, I think I have more ability on the table. She just goes for one point and she's so strong at that point. But we'll see. I'm confident about winning the match, but I'm not sure about how.
SPEAKER_00: that's interesting that's interesting that's interesting so you are saying that you have more chance and you are confident to beat carolina i think yes yeah okay okay yeah i mean it is like
SPEAKER_00: It is, like, good to be, how to say, play humble. I mean, it is good to be humble, but it is good to be 100%, it's better to be 100% yourself than being a fake humble. I agree. So that is why you are saying that, like, this is how I believe, why would I say that something that I don't believe in, right?
SPEAKER_00: Yes. But are you worried that, you know, she may take it as a, not disrespect, but you know, okay. I didn't say that I'm going to be 100%. What's that? I said that I'm confident. I didn't say that I'm going to be 100%. But confident means like, okay, okay. Okay, probably I misunderstood you. Yeah. Okay.
SPEAKER_00: I'm not sure about winning. I think I have a higher chance. That's it. I don't think that she would take this as a disrespect. So when you say that you don't believe that she can dominate you, it means that if she wins, there will be a war? Yes. But if you win, there is a possibility that you may win convincingly. Yes, that's what I said. Yes.
SPEAKER_00: Um, I I know why she's. I know why she's hanging in color listening. OK, well, how do I know that she is listening? Oh, is it? Is it her car in the gym? Oh, did you see you? Can you see this? Yeah. Wow. Female arm wrestling needed this kind of this kind of challenging. You know, that's good, that's good. And.
SPEAKER_00: maybe she wants to join us if she likes you i think that in this this this type of youtube uh invitation i think one person you can invite okay okay yeah yeah i tried but only one person as far as i know um so but but for sure
SPEAKER_00: Hopefully, before your match with her. Let's speak Turkish. 98% of the viewers are foreigners. If we speak Turkish, who will listen to an international organization? Please. If you broadcast the whole world in Turkish, only Turkey will listen. But if you broadcast in English, the whole world will listen.
SPEAKER_00: Anyways, Ramadan Kerim Michael, yeah. Anyways, so it is... What was your reaction when your match, I think your arm pull became, arm pull he probably says supermatch, became one of the most viewed King of the Table video? What did you think? It was so unexpected. Like, I didn't understand why it got that much views.
SPEAKER_02: But it's good for armwrestling. Yeah, that's it. It doesn't make me so happy because it's not so armwrestling fans. It's just got views, but it's not so armwrestling related. I understand. I understand. Yeah. So let's see. This is... Thank you, Ali Said, my brother.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, let's talk a little bit about East versus West matches. Are you familiar with all of those guys? Do you know all of them? I think yes. Listen, if you know, you are 19 years old, if you know those athletes, if you have an opinion about them, more than many of the athletes, arm wrestlers that have been my guests, and they didn't know, some of them, many of them, you know,
SPEAKER_00: I will be very surprised. Let's see. Let's see. Let's see how much you know. One second. Okay. Okay. Petro Marharint versus Nugo Chikadze.
SPEAKER_02: Who are these guys? What do you know about them? Let's see. As far as I know, Petro Marharint has a strong cupping ability, has a strong wrist. And I, as far as I know, Nugo is a top roller kind of puller, like he goes outside. Correct. Yeah, I think it's going to be exciting to watch.
SPEAKER_02: Like inside puller versus outside puller. They are high level pullers. And who do you see favourites? How do you see? Or do you see any favourites? Maybe Marharint because if it goes to strap maybe he could be better with taking the control of the pronator.
SPEAKER_00: but there's there's no like favorite favorite it's just like so you are saying that you are saying that it looks this but maybe slightly edge to one side yes yes okay okay okay let's go brandon assessor versus stojan golemanov that's the only match i don't have so much information about so
SPEAKER_02: I don't really know how it goes. I cannot guess. That's the only match I think. Okay. And Betkili Oniani, Talgat Aktaev. I think Aktaev might be favorite with his speed and also ability to get the match off the center to his winning side. But is it a title match?
SPEAKER_02: No, the title was owned by Artem Taino. Yeah, yes, yes. So it's going to be 3-0 and over. It's going to be best of five. So the one who wins three times is, yeah. Okay, I think Aktaev is the favorite in my opinion. So if it was one more round, then you think that Betkili would be favorite? Maybe because I'm not sure about Aktaev's endurance, but...
SPEAKER_00: He looks favorite to me. By the way, I kind of was thinking something else when you were saying this. What did you say about Karolina? Why? Because I was thinking something else. I think I have the bigger chance against Karolina.
SPEAKER_02: I'm just trying to provoke her. Let's see if she's still watching us. I know what you said. Okay, Kamil Jablonski versus Tobias Sporrong. I think Kamil has the slight edge. I don't know the ability of Tobias, like of like supination ability. If he is able to
SPEAKER_02: use his supination before Kamil does the move with the shoulder, I think Tobias can win. But if he's not able to take the center before Kamil, I think Kamil would win. So you are saying whoever takes the center most likely will win? Yes.
SPEAKER_00: I understand. So far, so far, not bad, not bad opinions. Sandris, Sandris versus Ibragim Sagov. Ibragim Sagov. Sandris is a more, like, he has more ways to win. He doesn't have just one style.
SPEAKER_02: so i think if ibrahim is able to get him hook in a fast way i think ibrahim would win but if match goes like closer not so dominant i think sundries would would be maybe okay carolina said i feel exactly the same as nisa
SPEAKER_00: okay that's interesting she also thinks that she also thinks that she's gonna lose she feels like same as you that's interesting that's interesting yeah i'm still i'm still messing with her i know what she meant she meant that she feels confident she's gonna win but whenever she said that she feels exactly you feel so um okay hello hello paul hello my friend
SPEAKER_00: okay so you you are saying uh ibrahim's favorite or sundries i forgot i missed the last part i think ibrahim he's a slight edge okay slide edge yeah okay and let's talk about sasha versus iraqli i think iraqli may have the edge
SPEAKER_00: Oh, one second. Karolina. If match go to straps, it will be more even. But I don't know if she can get to the strap. Maybe I don't need strap. Okay, maybe you don't need strap. Oh, you're based on that practice pull you had with her. I don't know. Maybe. Maybe. I cannot take Karolina in the chat. As far as I know,
SPEAKER_00: With this YouTube invitation, you can only invite one person. It's not Zoom. Okay. I think Nisa trusts herself because of that small training on the restaurant table, but
SPEAKER_00: I have been telling her that when Carolina is standing and putting her foot to that corner, front corner, then her back pressure is getting much stronger. But Nisa says that she is confident and we will see. Also, I don't understand why she thinks strap would favor her.
SPEAKER_00: No, she didn't say that strap favor her. She said she believes she's going to win. But if it is strap, then it will be more even. But she doesn't know if you can go to strap with her. Okay. But do you plan to go to strap with her? Or you are planning to arm wrestle with or without her?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, that's the plan. I think I would do good in both straps and without the straps, but I think I am generally a bit stronger than her. So I think strap would favor me maybe, but I'm not sure that I'm going to need straps. Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, let's go. Sasho versus Irakli. Sorry, you started. And this Karolina girl, she doesn't leave us alone, you know. Even though we don't provoke her, I don't provoke her, she continues riding. So this time... Okay, let's go. Who's winning? Sasho or Irakli? I think Irakli because Irakli is good against inside pullers.
SPEAKER_02: I think the way to beat Irakli is to go outside with a good wrist control. And Sasho is an inside puller. But Sasho has beaten him before. I know. But is it a different time? Yeah, I think Irakli is in a better shape than before. Okay. Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Let's go next one. Leonidas versus Skullboy. I think Skullboy is gonna win because Leonidas has a good strength in his body but he is new to armwrestling and I think Skullboy's wrist control is so good.
SPEAKER_00: So I think Skullboy is gonna win. Because he's more technical armwrestler? Yes, he's like a complete armwrestler than Leonidas. So just say that you lock them in bicep and start like this in a slow start, then their chance would be more close, I mean, to each other?
SPEAKER_00: It would be more close, but I don't think that schoolboy is so easy to get in hook. Uh-huh. No, I mean, they will start in hook. Will they? No, no, no. I mean, I'm just trying to say if it was a bicep versus bicep, do you think Leonidas would have a chance to win according to you? Yes. Okay. Okay. Okay, let's go. Fia versus...
SPEAKER_02: nikisha ekaterina nikisha versus fear i say i'm excited for that that one what's that i'm excited for that one you're excited yes your future opponents in right are yes enough time i'm not sure i think fia is the favorites
SPEAKER_02: because we don't see Ekaterina so much like I don't know her shape is good or not but Fia is like has a great endurance and also has a great control but if Fia loses her hand without the straps
SPEAKER_00: And the match continues. If they don't go to the steps, maybe Ekaterina would be better. What do you base this on? Do you remember Nikiševa, like Pullin? When did you see her? In Romania, 2019?
SPEAKER_02: yes yes she won the class oh she won the class yes yeah which right left or i remember right but i'm not sure about left but i know her pulling style and i think she is a problem without the straps okay i understand
SPEAKER_00: Okay, so let's go to Minda Tarasaitis versus Artur Makarov. You are probably very knowledgeable about these two pullers because your coach had been pulling against them. And how do you see this match? Let's hear your expert opinion.
SPEAKER_02: No. I remember my coach beating Mindaugus Tarasaitis convincingly. Also, I remember my coach being better than Artur Makarov. That's not the question. People will think that you are... No, I'm just gonna... I'm just making it... Like comparing them? Yes, yes. Okay.
SPEAKER_02: But not sure about Makarov's shape. I don't know if he's the best he's ever been. I don't know. But in first two rounds, I think Makarov would win. Okay, this is best of seven. The winner needs to win four times. I know. I'm not sure about the other rounds. But I think in a fresh round, Makarov would be better.
SPEAKER_00: Hmm, I understand. Yeah. Did you know that the Mindaugus Tarasaitis as of now is considered by the majority of the community as the goat? I know. I know. Do you agree with that? I agree with that. Yeah, I totally agree with that. Yeah. People are delusional to think that John Bersing is goat.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, like they don't know anything about Amritsar, I think. Yeah, yeah. But did you know that Mindaugus is a goat and also very humble? The other day I saw he's just like, I'm just a regular goat, you know. Of course. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, of course. Nobody would say the opposite way. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, anyway, so let's go to the...
SPEAKER_00: next match but listen mindagos is really joking aside really really good arm master you know he stopped all everything he's the way that he pulled uh last match against daniel prokopchuk he was like you know okay just this is for free watch me like uh me giving arm wrestling lesson you know the guy was just
SPEAKER_00: But whenever I talk this, no disrespect to Daniel. For Mindaugus to deserve all this praise is because the victory was against someone incredible, like Daniel Prokopcik. That's why we were surprised about the rounds, about winning Daniel, because Daniel is so strong. Yeah. Mindaugus Tarasay is the only guy that Chuck Norris is afraid of.
SPEAKER_00: I'm serious. I asked Chuck. Chuck said, anyone except Mindawes. Anyways. I'm not so good at it. I played it like in high school a little bit, but I'm not so good at chess.
SPEAKER_00: Did you try or just a little bit you play? Just a little bit. Okay, Clark says Nisa has better mind games than Devon. No way. Yeah, also Karolina said that she would start with you like this, that this one centimeter from the pad. She said she would just
SPEAKER_00: bring you like this, this, this to the pad and she said that she would finish only with wrist movement like this. She wouldn't think about it. She wouldn't say such thing? No, she wouldn't. Okay, okay. I tried at least. I tried for provocation, but anyway, so yeah. Okay, let's go to the next one.
SPEAKER_02: next one michael todd versus frank lamparelli i think beating michael todd is a very very hard thing you need to have everything to beat him like you cannot hook him so i think michael is the favorite if he is in a good shape
SPEAKER_00: okay so if he is in a good shape michael wins because someone to beat him needs to have everything just hand control everything is not easy to beat him he just still needs to have some pressure or something yes yes it's a very different game like not a usual usual pulling style um
SPEAKER_02: I think Georgi wins this one because he has a good risk control. He has a good pronator. He has a good general power. I think he is the favorite and I think he's going to be able to win. Okay.
SPEAKER_02: and david samusha versus nur dalet aydarhan i think nur dalet is the best guy to beat samusha because he's he's like he's really strong pound for pound and also he's better against hook pullers inside pullers i think nur dalet
SPEAKER_00: may win but i see this match like nearly 50 50. okay you are saying that one is explosive while the other one has better endurance and then you don't know which one if either can come to the four or not because if he cannot come he will be hidden to the samusha's endurance maybe
SPEAKER_02: Yes, yes. I think if the match stops, it's going to favor Samushia. But Nur Dalet is really explosive. Also, he's good against hook pullers. Okay. Let's see how it will be because Samushia won seven world title matches in a row. You know, just like amazing.
SPEAKER_00: Now we will see if Nur Dalet can change this. But I will do my best as an athlete to make sure that Samushia doesn't win 10 world title matches in a row. I really need to be ready. Nothing against him, but someone needs to stop him. We will see. Anyway, so this is interesting. Ermes versus Ali Can.
SPEAKER_02: I think Alizhan wins. Alizhan wins? Yes. Why? He is really impressive about getting the match in hook. He has a good, great hooking capability. I think Ermes' left is not the best, one of the best, of course one of the best, but
SPEAKER_00: I think Ali Can is going to be too much. How would Ermes' right versus Ali Can's left, if it was possible, how would that be? I think Ermes would win. Ermes' right would beat Ali Can's left because Ermes' right is so hard to be hooked. But how do you know that if left is 80% of the right, do you think no chance?
SPEAKER_02: Ermes' left is 80% of Ermes' right? No, I'm just saying if Ermes' left is 80% of his right. Yeah. Okay, okay. Sorry. 80 is not enough, but if it's like close to 90%, then Ermes has the bigger chance in my opinion.
SPEAKER_00: Let's see the last one. Devon Larratt versus Levan Levan Saginashvili. What is this match for you? This match is the most exciting match in the armwrestling history in my opinion. Okay, why is that? Because
SPEAKER_02: In history, there was nothing like East vs. West. There were the same guys pulling each other. And I think now, the best guys are facing each other. And among them, this match is the most important match in the armwrestling community.
SPEAKER_00: I agree with you because I, in my opinion, um, there has never been any arm wrestler that could beat Levan Levan Saginashvili. I believe this. And Devon before their first match, like his experience, especially with right arm against the Ekaterina pullers was
SPEAKER_00: this much because he didn't really pull any eastern pullers and that was the biggest thing that people criticized, you know, like you are afraid of the Ekaterina Europeans, you are afraid of the Ekaterina Europeans and he pulled Levan, he lost and after that he pulled all the Ekaterina Europeans and except Gennady match which was very close, he won
SPEAKER_00: The rest, convincingly, you know, he really beat everyone with domination. And I'm 100% sure that he now deserves this match more than he deserved the first match to pull. He cleaned, you know, everywhere. And then he came, and after those stem cells and everything, and I will tell you something, you know.
SPEAKER_00: We talked pulling the best of Ekaterina Europeans. You, your experience, no matter if you're pulling for 30 years, something, something is missing with that experience because the world is not all about North America. So Devon, his experience since Levan match with right arm till the Georgi match, which was one and a half year period.
SPEAKER_00: And he, I mean, I think that he gained experience probably as much as what he gained before that in his career. Different experience, the experience of the years and experience of the feeling, experience of something different is just different things, you know? So what I just say, with that experience, with that,
SPEAKER_00: Um, I think is psychologically is ready. He's ready. And those stem cells, you can see that he can do incredible things and at the table. So as of now today, if anyone deserves to pull Levan, that that's for sure Devon. And soon we will find out.
SPEAKER_02: Do you see Devon having any chance against Levan? Or you are giving heavy favourites for Levan? No, he has a chance against Levan. I think he is the only one who has this much chance against Levan. And his pulling style is the perfect match for Levan.
SPEAKER_02: I mean, perfect for Devon's side or Levan's side? Devon's side. Devon's side. Yes. Why is that? Because her... I'm sorry. His riser, his wrist control. I think he has better wrist control than Ermes has. Also, his style of... But just remember, Ermes didn't stop Levan with the wrist control.
SPEAKER_00: this he lost right away you know he lost start with the back pressure and then he he protected his pronator and arm strength stopped him yeah yeah i know yeah yeah i don't see devon as favorites levan is the favorite of course but
SPEAKER_02: i think if levan is not in his best shape like he if he's not better than ever then it would be more equal but in every possibility i think levan has the edge but not so big not so big because it's four rounds and and i think
SPEAKER_00: Devon may do some things that surprise us. He may pull in some different ways, you mean? I think so. I mean, for sure, for sure that Devon of today has more center than before those stem cells that he was opening all the time. Okay, he had also
SPEAKER_00: some opening against Georgi Tsvetkov but for sure his shoulder was you know really up you know yeah anyway so we will see we will see how it will be and and what is your opinion did you follow the Georgi videos yes yes what is your opinion how do you see Levan's shape yeah Levan is like strong
SPEAKER_02: I think his general power is near to his best. That's what I saw. But I think the match is going to be about Levan's wrist, not general power. And I don't know if Levan's wrist is better than ever. That's the key point in my opinion.
SPEAKER_00: Did you post any PRs in wrist of Levan? I mean, he did 80 kilo one rep. People say that he has done 100 kilo before. But two days before, he did the wrist curl. He did some chin-ups. Of course, 180 kilo. Of course, your wrist is holding. It doesn't have to go. Whenever you keep your wrist like static,
SPEAKER_00: It is tiring, 180 kilo you are pulling. And also he did some wrist curl with the handle from the cable. And before he did the wrist on his knee, he did some one-arm dumbbell curls. And he did with 110 kilo. I mean, it doesn't matter if it is...
SPEAKER_00: bicep curl or not it is to the weight is still you know you know here so it's putting pressure here too you know under it's 10 kilo you are holding so i'm sure inside his wrist i just don't know i talked with matushenko matushenko said that in guinness is like probably if he was totally fresh he could do 10 or or 8 or 12 kilo like 10 10 to uh
SPEAKER_00: 15% or something, he said, which is equal to 88 to 92 kilos. So, yeah. Also, I don't blame Levan because if I had such an injury, just remember this injury happened probably like maybe 10 months ago. So I don't think they would be very smart to push the limits there. If I were him, I would do the same thing.
SPEAKER_00: I wouldn't even do that 80 kilo one rep. I wouldn't do anything one rep. I would do a little bit less and do a lot of reps. And then I would save my max for the competition day. If it gets injured or something, let it be injured there. I wouldn't risk it at gym training, you know. Yes. Yeah, we will see. We will see. But that's interesting that people right now, I see polls.
SPEAKER_00: And I see Devon's favorites. That is interesting. And my opinion, I would give, like I said already, 55, 45, 53, 47 for Levan. But even some of the top arm masters that have been guests in my podcast, they say that
SPEAKER_00: Devon is going to win. I can see Devon dominating Devon, but I cannot see Devon dominating Devon. Devon doesn't need to dominate him. Devon's style, especially in early rounds, has never been domination.
SPEAKER_00: strategy he would like to stop secure the match tire the person he dominates after he tires the opponent you know yeah but i agree with you what you are trying to say that you are saying that there is a possibility 11 to win with the flash pins while devon's victory can only be by being
SPEAKER_00: more endured you know like having more endurance yeah yes that's what i think yeah let's see let's see how it will be let's see how it will be and you have been part of the is have you been part of the all these forces west except one that you went to kazakhstan except east versus west nine i have been to all of them ah maybe not east versus two because i think one of them i missed i don't know
SPEAKER_00: So this will be 12 events and you missed two of them. East vs. West 2 and 9. 9 is I don't remember. You had to go to Kazakhstan. Yeah, that's the only part because I missed best of 78 kilo competition. No, no, not those ones. East vs. West 2. Were you there when John Brzing pulled Hajim Razdoler? Yes, yes, I have been to all of them. Okay, so you only missed one because you had to go to Waffles. Yes. Yeah, by the way, I was reading the comments and I missed it. What did you say about Carolina?
SPEAKER_00: I am confident about beating Karolina. You are confident about, okay. Karolina, are you there? This 19-year-old girl, she thinks that she can beat you and she's confident. Just tell her something back. Karolina, keep focusing on your training, Nisa.
SPEAKER_00: That's good, Karolina. That's good. Fire back. Fire back. I tried to stop her to talk about you, but she never stops. So what can I do? Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, so is there anything more you would like to say or talk? Yeah. Thanks for having me in the live. That's all.
SPEAKER_00: Okay. Okay. Anyways. So thank you guys. Is there anything you guys? Yeah. Sergi Meyer. Engin the instigator. Yeah. That's me. Yeah. Yes. 324. Karolina, how many 90 years old have you been? Karolina says all of them.
SPEAKER_00: If she is set for a supermatch against a 19-year-old girl... And she says, Nisa will be next. Uh-oh. Yeah. Yeah. That is... That's interesting, yeah. That will be very interesting. Sandris Volkov, I don't...
SPEAKER_00: really train my neck, but I recently do because I have injuries. Sol Arkona Engin, the chief, there's three in the pot, more than Gordon Ramsey. I don't know who that person is. Yeah, we should train the neck. Neck is, I think, I believe, very important. Very important. Karolina said that
SPEAKER_00: Nisa should find an opponent at her level. This border for her is too deep. Did she really say that? Yeah, she said it. Devon't you see on the chat? It doesn't sound like her. It doesn't sound like her? If a woman is set against a 19-year-old girl, then that 19-year-old girl must be strong.
SPEAKER_00: What do you mean? Like, if there's a supermatch set against an adult woman and a 19-year-old girl. Yeah, but sometimes, sometimes, Karuna needs to have some only relaxed matches, you know. She asked me, you know, and set me against someone that I can easily beat, and I said, okay, how about me? She said, yeah, that's what I want, you know, yeah. Yeah, this event is not for that.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm trying to stir the pot. But remember, your event, your match is not the next one. It will be in July. So before the July, I think on social media, there will be a lot of back and forth between you and Carolina. And I promise that I will do my best so that, you know, like to stir the pot. I know.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. See, Sergei Meyer says that Karolina got this. Karolina, yeah. He says Karolina is going to win. We'll see. Yeah, we will see, yeah. Karolina said that, Nisa, you should stick in your junior competition. Karolina wouldn't say that. Karolina wouldn't say that? No. Come on. Come on.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know. Either I need glasses or this is what she's saying here. Yeah. Anyway, so let's see. But they are still going to become all legacy. Yeah. Okay. Unchained says, Nisa, how did you fall in love with arm wrestling and strength?
SPEAKER_02: I have no idea. I just started for fun. And I don't know how I loved it because I don't really remember. Like I'm this passionate about being the best. I'm not, of course, I'm not the best. I'm not close to being the best. But you are saying that you want to be best, like this passion. Yes. Yes. I don't know.
SPEAKER_00: But have you tried armwrestling before you came to my gym? Yeah, in school with my friends. Were you beating all the girls? All the boys in my middle school. Oh, you were beating even the boys before you came? Yes. Wow, you are very good. Very good. Yeah, I didn't know that. Yeah. Anyway, so guys, you all take care of yourself and
SPEAKER_00: And then I will have another podcast with Michael and Frank Lamparelli and also Schoolboy and Leonidas. Sarah Lightning Latona Nisa. Yeah. Anyways, yeah, I think you guys are friends from the social media, right?
SPEAKER_00: Yes, yes. Yeah. Anyways, guys, you all take care of yourself and hope to see you next time. Yeah. Take care, Nisa. Take care. Bye-bye. Bye.
