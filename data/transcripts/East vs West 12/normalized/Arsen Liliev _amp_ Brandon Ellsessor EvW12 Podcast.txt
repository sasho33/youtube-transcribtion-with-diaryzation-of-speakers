SPEAKER_02: How bad does Engin think Devon gonna whoop up on Levan? I don't know. I think 40% Devon has chance, 60% Levan has chance. But, you know, this is from what we know. But what we don't know, only those athletes know. I think I will go to Tbilisi, Georgi.

SPEAKER_02: you are right in that yeah pound for pound the pronation is not bad for sure that that is not bad but of course that's not the formation right now i'm showing but still okay i'm missing roman what
SPEAKER_02: are trying to uh compare you know depends on what what you are thinking compared to what if you are talking about compared to like other 19 years old guys such like reno and bacho alden has long way to go but yeah if you are saying like in a normal level yeah i mean he's doing very well you know
SPEAKER_02: use them very well, but just a long way to go. I'm just like this type of, I mean, Adan came here, has been my guest, his father is my friend, you know, but just like, yeah, he's on the right direction, but a long way to go. Hello to Ukraine. What is your opinion about, okay, I already answered it.
SPEAKER_02: Hello, Osman. I understand your name. Please don't be writing all the time the same thing. Did SG Records channel really got deleted? I didn't know that. Wow, why would that happen? Hello, Meladze. I'm okay, normal. Ivan Motishenko is the translator.
SPEAKER_02: When is your next competition? I don't know. Today I train. I'm not 50%. Last four and a half months, I only trained one month. And so I just started again from the beginning. I did some as well, you know, bicycle motion streak. I did only with 25 kilo just to start. How are you after the hair transplant, Eden?
SPEAKER_02: A lot of bread and cheese for recovery. I eat bread and cheese all the time, yeah. Not for recovery, but I love it. Adam versus Frode. No, no, no. Frode. Adam is not there. Adam needs to compete, in my opinion, more tournaments just to be well-rounded.
SPEAKER_02: Engin, if you were to set up a match for Alder in his own weight club, what would be a good match for him? I need to think about it. Right now, I focus on what I'm going to organize. I don't know. I'm very excited about organizing East vs. West 12 and all those matches are incredible.
SPEAKER_02: a real thing is just waiting for us and it may be the best event in history. Yeah, Ivan is not only a translator, Ivan is also a good person and a legendary athlete.
SPEAKER_02: This seems like Devon is going to win the match against Devon Richardson. I don't know. They both look very strong, you know. I'm just like, I wouldn't want to feel the pressure when the goal comes, you know. There will be a lot of pressure when the goal comes.
SPEAKER_02: Hello, Engin. Like, if Ken reaches at least 60% of his peak, then he will win easy. Who are you talking about? You're talking about Levan? No, no, no, no, no. You are mistaken. Even he is like 90%. So, you know, I would be worried, you know. Will I be in the Philippines for the qualifiers? No, I have never been in any club qualifiers.
SPEAKER_02: michael workspace east versus 12 is going to be national holiday taking the whole weekend off to watch the event yep it will be great here alaikum salam mike tyson what the hell why the channel is gone or sg there is so many great conduct
SPEAKER_02: Roman didn't tell me anything about it. We communicate, but I didn't know anything about this one. Okay, I think Ivan came. I mean, you can have high expectations for Arden, but it will take some time. No need to put so much pressure on the guy. Just slow by slow.
SPEAKER_02: hello how are you you want great thank you so we're waiting for our son arsene who came here some arsene came yeah he's just trying to wanna he he he was very happy when i said that you're gonna translate for him because he doesn't trust his uh english i tell him that
SPEAKER_02: You know, I told him that you are coming. He doesn't trust his English. I told him that he needs to speak so he can improve. Yeah. His English was rather good, I think. Yeah, he understands everything, but he said that he can't express everything, you know. I mean, like, don't tell him it is between us, but I really dislike that guy. I don't like him. Oh, are you here, Arsene?
SPEAKER_04: You cannot see us or what?
SPEAKER_01: You probably see yourself there on the big screen. Yes, but why don't I see you, I can't understand. Vanya, do you see me? I see you, yes, you're right on the whole screen now. You're getting in shape, good. Wait a second. One second.
SPEAKER_02: Hey, there's Arsene Lilliev, John. Yeah, the guy in the middle is Arsene. You cannot see him? Okay, okay, okay. One second, one second. I made a mistake.
SPEAKER_02: see you see me now so whenever i turn this way don't you think i mean you turn yourself a little bit you move it to the right move it to the right the other way the other left then down okay but you think when uh arson is guy guys what's going on yeah i i i'll send arson and you end of this year
SPEAKER_04: Okay, yeah, I need to figure out some issues with my shoulder, but I'm hopeful, yeah. Yeah. So I have some problem. I have pain in my shoulder and my elbow. It's not a problem, Joe. The end of this year. Hey, he wants to pull your end of this year. Yeah, yeah, let's see how it goes.
SPEAKER_03: We'll see how it goes. Yeah. How are you feeling? Good? Good. Yeah, I've just been resting. I pulled a little bit yesterday. I tossed this tournament. It went really well. That's good. Yeah, East versus Qualifier thing. And I'm just sore. And I just, you know, I stopped taking, you know, my anti-inflammatory meds. So that just makes it worse. So it's been hard. Did you just say you compete East versus Qualifier? After book. Okay.
SPEAKER_02: okay okay okay okay anyways we are live so keep in touch okay thank you john take care of yourself thank you
SPEAKER_02: Sorry, guys. I thought it would be good, you know, Arsene and John to meet each other. Brandon, this guy is dreaming to pull against John. Do you have anything to say? Like, are you not planning to send this guy home, like, retired again? Are you not going to retire this guy? Well, first of all, I feel like a little fly in a room full of spiders right now, so I feel like I shouldn't do too much talking, but
SPEAKER_00: um that uh arson has definitely got a lot of accolades and he'd been out for 11 years so the game's a lot since then and hoping uh i don't want to discourage him or ruin his motivation or anything but i'm hoping to come out with the win yeah but but just i mean like can you tell him that you know to not to quit after he lose
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, please don't quit. I would love to see you continue on for sure. Yeah. I mean, Arsene, he doesn't want to feel guilty, you know, because, like, we, after 11 years, we barely brought you back to arm wrestling, and he is so sorry. He's so sorry that you have to, I mean, like, he's afraid that you are going to lose your motivation after you lose. It sucks. I want to root for him. No problem, my friend. You're a good opponent for me.
SPEAKER_04: What did he say? Something is wrong with you. First of all, I want to say thank you that you agree to compete with me. So it's... Vanya, help me. I'm very pleased that he agreed to fight me and that he agreed to be my first opponent. Right? I'll translate it. They're joking that...
SPEAKER_04: They don't want to feel guilty if you win. Well, yes, if I lose. And you lose, yes, and you get a pension again. There is such a message. I understood it differently. I thought that I wouldn't give up. Well, if there is such a message, then say that you will have to do everything as usual. I greet you. You are in good shape, I see it on your face. Yes, yes, we look at the physiognomy.
SPEAKER_01: Arsene says that he will uh he's glad to pull his opponent first and he will do everything as usual he's going to do everything as he's used to do he's used
SPEAKER_02: And Arsene, are you going to quit after Brandon beats you? If Brandon wins, he will quit for sure. Oh, Brandon, there's too much pressure on him.
SPEAKER_00: puts me in a tight spot i want to see him continue i don't want to lose though i'd rather not lose so yeah if i can help it yeah yeah the pleasure sorry go ahead brent i was just saying the pleasure is all mine to to get the opportunity to pull arson so i'm i'm
SPEAKER_02: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, yeah. We were thinking about like also you and Brett Grundy, you know, and Brett Grundy couldn't pull because of his study, something he said that he doesn't have time. And then, yeah. And then we were thinking about you. We were just, that's why I asked you if you could be 105 kilo and you said you could be heavier. You said, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, so it's 105 kilos, correct? That's what, 232 pounds? Yeah, around there. I'm already like 223-ish around there, and I can for sure gain 10 more pounds before then. I'll definitely be stronger than I've ever been, so I'm really excited. So you are already over 100 kilos? Yeah, just barely, yeah. Yeah, that's good, that's good.
SPEAKER_01: So, Arsene, do you have anything to say? Arsene, do you hear us? Arsene, can you hear me? Yes, I can hear you now. Maybe you want to say something else? I didn't quite understand myself. I think the opponent said that he is usually smaller, but now he is gaining weight. Well, actually...
SPEAKER_04: Arsene says again that he thanks his opponent for accepting the match.
SPEAKER_01: He wishes him good luck. And let the strongest win. What? No, no, no. Come here. No, no, that's it, Vanya. I'm done. I think Engin is missing now. Hello.
SPEAKER_04: Hello, hello. Why are you so angry? I don't know, Vanya, my son's birthday is on the 1st of May, and today is the 2nd. In a day, in short. Congratulations, handsome. Thank you, thank you, thank you. You have two, right? We all have something in common. It seems to me that we are staying together. You have two, too, right, Vanya? Yes, I have a son and a daughter. I think so.
SPEAKER_01: Well, Tengen doesn't write anything yet. How's your form, Vanya? Let's do it while we're together, at least. How's your form? The form is fine, but I need to gain something in three months. I'm going to have such a serious fight with Morozov on the left. And I think that I need to gain something on Morozov, and something is now epicondylitis, as usual.
SPEAKER_01: Can you a little bit translate Ivan? Because it's just like so much conversation is going on. We don't know what to say. We thought you were not here and we started talking about everything. Arsene told about his children that one of them was born on 1st of March and the other is on 3rd of March. So today he's another son. Why did you think that I wasn't here? You don't see me?
SPEAKER_01: Yes, we didn't see you and we didn't hear you. Right now you don't see me? No, now I see you. But for some time we thought we were alone. And after that we started discussing just our form. Oh, okay, okay, okay. I was like curious, you know. They are just chatting, you know, while we are here. So what was your chance, Arsen, meeting Brandon? Arsen, what chances do you think
SPEAKER_04: Arsene says that he never competed anywhere where he wasn't sure that he would win.
SPEAKER_01: so if he agreed to compete at your event he thinks he is the favorite and no he thinks he will win okay
SPEAKER_04: So he never competed anywhere. Does it include like Denis and Pushkar when you compete against them? Oh, Engin, you started. Yes, I said it about my weight category. Weight category, yeah, I believe, I believe, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: And so he's saying, Brandon, basically he's saying that he has never competed in his class in his entire career without believing like 100% is going to win. So what do you think? What do I think? Yeah. So he's like after 11 years, he is still confident. So I don't have a lot to go off of based on
SPEAKER_00: the current level of Arsene's abilities, the most I can really go off of is like his matches in the past against like John Brzezink and the level John Brzezink is at currently. And I know that he hasn't, he's been active for quite some time and Arsene has. I can only assume that he can't be too much
SPEAKER_00: above john if he is he might be around that level and i can only assume how well i think i would do against somebody like john to give myself a rough estimate if we're in the same ballpark or not and i am very it is to me it's very interesting um i think i would have to say 50 50 to be honest
SPEAKER_02: um days i feel like that i'm i'm only getting stronger i'm i think i'm better than most what most people think that i am based off my list and east versus west um you you lost so much weight you were like like under 190 pounds you know you were just yeah yeah yeah right now you are you are right now gonna be as strong as possible i'll be like 40 pounds heavier
SPEAKER_02: yeah yeah 40 pounds heavier you're right yeah yeah and where do you where do you see like like you already have your game plan or you're still trying to figure out you know by watching his old videos yeah i already have game plan you have the game plan yeah okay yep yeah he seems whole uh he's like he said he has the
SPEAKER_00: What he wants to do he's he that's what he's good at and that's what he's what he's gonna do so I already have a plan for it and we'll see if it works or not, I have more than one plan but yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah, I understand. I mean, some people, they don't have faith in you. Like, and these people, I see that they're from same country as you are. But I kind of think that, like, this is a great opportunity. Like, not everyone can get a match with this legend and he's like coming back match.
SPEAKER_02: And I think that it is a good opportunity for you to write your name in the history.
SPEAKER_00: i absolutely agree with that and going back in my past matchups every almost every super match that i've had there's always people saying that i shouldn't even be on the same table as this guy or it's going to be 3-0 to the other guy and i have so far i've continued to to prove people wrong and that's kind of
SPEAKER_02: just the path I've been taking as I've been progressing. And so to me, this is just another day. You are used to being called underdog. Yeah. Yeah. I've been called underdog many times too. Yeah. I mean, from one side it's good. It takes so much pressure away and you save energy, you know? Oh yeah. I have nothing to lose. Yeah. Let's go.
SPEAKER_02: I definitely, I know for sure when I'm the underdog, I'm a lot more, I feel like I just have a lot more energy during the match for some reason. Yeah, you were, when you pulled Samushia, you lost all that weight, but you still was very big. You were still very big. I can imagine how you will look in real when you are 230. Then did you guys know, Arsene, you, Arsene, you hear me or you hear me?
SPEAKER_02: Yes, yes, yes. Yes, yes, yes. Yes, yes, yes. Yes, yes, yes. Arsene, you and Brandon have something in common. Do you know what it is? Ivan? Do you have something in common between you? In what? In what? Yeah, you both beat Travis Baszons. Ha, ha, ha. Ha, ha, ha. Ha, ha, ha.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah. And anyway, so, and Arsene, can you tell us about your current weight? Like, where are you? Your bicep, your wrist, your finger, your hammer, your pronator, your legs, like your weight. I know you cannot be in, as you were in prime at the table, you need to compete, but where are the weights? Like which percentage?
SPEAKER_04: Do you understand, Darsan? He asks about the percentage. What do you have with the strength indicators? There are hammers, there is everything. Yes, I understand. Well, I always, Ivan, if it is difficult for you to translate, for me the indicators have always been pronator, shoulder and biceps. As for
SPEAKER_04: And the wrist, of course, yes. My wrist is fine, very good, I think. I'm not far behind those maximums that I did in good shape. Surprisingly, the biceps has increased. The pronator is fine, but the shoulder blade is far behind, as I think. I don't know what to do with it, but I've been doing light training for a couple of weeks now, I don't know. In general, the shoulder blade is not very good. I'm happy with everything else, in principle.
SPEAKER_01: He usually estimates his form with his wrist, his hammer curls, biceps, and pronation, for sure. He thinks that his wrist is very good now. Perhaps top form. But he's not sure about his hammer. Darsan, you have a hammer bend now.
SPEAKER_04: Not at that level yet, right? Yes, for some reason I didn't add as much as I wanted to. At the same time, the biceps, on the contrary, surprised me, but the biceps added well. I added 5 kg for each exercise. But biceps is rather good. Yeah, this is what he told me on the phone as well. He said that his best was 45 kg full motion.
SPEAKER_02: 10 reps and now he's doing 40 kilo about the same reps, like 10 reps. Is it possible, Ivan, you and Arsene to turn the phone sideways? Horizontal. Yeah. Thank you.
SPEAKER_02: Ivan, have you ever pulled Travis Baszons? No. Maybe after a tournament. After a tournament, it was not on the table. Yeah, if he would also pull him and beat him, then four of us would be something in common. Yeah, Brandon is laughing there. But we're talking about right hand, right?
SPEAKER_02: I mean, it doesn't matter, right, left. Brandon beat him left, I beat him left, and Arsene beat him right, but you didn't pull him. So, Ivan, you don't deserve to be with us, sorry. I'm just a translator. Yeah, you are probably the strongest translator, together with Paolo. Arsene, did you see Paolo's match with Brandon, Brad Grandi?
SPEAKER_04: Did you see it, Arsen? Yes, yes, yes. Yes, yes, Vanya. Yes, of course I saw it, of course I saw it. My manager himself sent it to me early in the morning, so I saw it very well. But what should I say? Brandon... Wait, not Brandon, what's his name? Grandi, in general, added well, and I didn't expect him to win at all. And even more so so confidently. Well, in general, the guy is talented, he has a lot to add.
SPEAKER_04: I haven't seen the fight. Brandon won, are you sure? I'm sure. The opponent won the first one. And then Brett won, to be honest. Yes, Pavlo won the first one. He also won the first one. And then Grandi took him up and he couldn't do anything.
SPEAKER_01: So Arsene saw that for sure because you sent this video. Yeah. And he was really impressed. Yeah. And he was like, oh, thanks God I didn't pull against Brett Grundy.
SPEAKER_04: Why not? Why not? Thank you. Why not? I don't know. Because you were very impressed. I thought that maybe you felt like you were not ready. So, Vanya, please translate. I always have to say something. You shouldn't, I think. You shouldn't.
SPEAKER_02: What was the result of this match? I think, was it 3-1? Did you watch it, Brandon? Yeah, it was 3-1. Pablo won the first one in straps and Brad won the rest. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But he was very impressive. I need to see it. Yeah, Brad Grande, yeah, he was very, very impressive, that match. That is a super chat, Skyler Brooks. Ivan, what is your opinion? Devon versus Devon.
SPEAKER_02: You ask me? No, not me, the superchats. They're asking you, the fan. You ask me who wins, Lerach or... Yeah, I mean, I am just repeating the question, you know, the fan is asking you in the chat. Ah, I see, I see. I think Levan has more chances.
SPEAKER_01: A little more chances. But it can be an even fight. And there are some chances for Devon also. I see some chances. But I think that if I have to bet, I would bet only one. But it may be very close. 55-45, 60-40? Yes, something like that. Yes, 55-45. Yeah, that's my opinion as well. Yeah, we will talk about these matches.
SPEAKER_02: Brandon, how do you see your chances against Arsene? You said 50-50, but when I say how do you see, I mean, like,
SPEAKER_02: Like you trust your explosiveness. It's hard to trust our own explosiveness when you are playing against Arsene, but he's not 25 anymore. So you more trust on your endurance. Do you think that after 11 years break, he can have the long match endurance if somehow the match stops?
SPEAKER_00: Well, like I said, it's, it's such an unknown because we just haven't seen him. So it's, it's so hard. I can't, you can't really predict how anything, um, I think that he'll still be as explosive. The question is going to be is if he has the, as much power in this, he has the endurance. I think I got an edge when it comes to endurance and I think I have popping power. So, and I, my hand is getting way stronger also. So.
SPEAKER_02: Let's see how it will be. It is very interesting. I just can't have an idea after 11 years. You started training after Denis Splinkov vs Devon match, right? Arsen, did you start training after the fight between Splinkov and Devon?
SPEAKER_04: Did you return to training? Well, I started with warm-ups. I did warm-ups, I did the track. Specifically, what I'll call it, I started getting ready. I started getting ready, I think, on January 8th, if I'm not mistaken. It was already preparation. Everything else was just a little bit of the body moving. For 11 years, apart from the fork and the knife, I didn't hold anything in my hands.
SPEAKER_01: Arsene says that he started training for this match from the 8th of January. And before that, he did some warming up, some cardio, just to feel better, to get ready for this preparation. And Arsene, is there any better place in the home that you know for your internet? Like, am I the only one that is seeing Arsene frozen? I do not see Arsene at all.
SPEAKER_04: I'm right next to him, two meters away. I don't know what's going on. Let's try to get him to the side. One second. I had this feeling. It was uncomfortable for me to talk. I thought you had something to do with the internet. Now do you see them, Ivan? One second, one second, one second. I have VPN on.
SPEAKER_02: I do not see your son. Yeah, but you see that there are like three dots at the bottom of your screen? Now I see all of you. Oh, okay. Yeah. This is what I meant. Yeah. Yeah. And Brandon, what were you doing? Were you training? You are in the gym or where? I saw a squat bench there. Oh, well, it's the quietest place in the house and we have three boys. Okay. Okay. We have two before this. Yeah. That's it. Yep.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah. Arsene noticed that Brandon has so many cups. Trophies. Cups.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah. More than we have altogether. Not you, Engin. You have, I think, better. No, no, no. Look at that. Wow. I mean, what is that? A trophy store or what? Trophies, medals, plaques, whatever those things are. No, I mean, it looks like it's a trophy store that you are selling them. It's like so many.
SPEAKER_02: I like to keep them. I think it just brings back memories and it keeps me motivated. Yes, yes, of course, of course. Brendan, can you show your upper arm to this guy? Yeah, let me set the camera. Because, yeah. All right. I want to see Arsene's. Arsene, let's see your forearm.
SPEAKER_02: no you're showing your elbow like this show like this so okay yeah that's big yeah now now i was better than this guy yeah scary scary anyway so let's let's talk you both are like too nice to have any kind of trash talk and so let's
SPEAKER_02: uh talk about the event okay by the way it's not completely you know we always need uh all kind of people and you two are very uh respectful to each other and that's great that's that's great um brandon do you follow the eastern atlas
SPEAKER_00: or like other than other than the east versus west and king of the table like do you follow for example european championships or i am subscribed to pretty much every european youtube channel that i come across on my youtube so as as they pop up on my youtube news feed i i usually watch them but i don't see everything like do you watch european championships waffles or something or yes
SPEAKER_02: Love watching those, yeah. Did you know the guy Chikadze, Nugo Chikadze, from Georgi last year at the Europeans to beat Krasimir Kostadinov in the final? I might have seen that. I don't remember. And Arsene, do you know him? No idea.
SPEAKER_01: I got the question, but honestly I don't know him. I watched him and won, but I didn't know him before. What did he say? He didn't know him, but he maybe saw one match with him lately. He what?
SPEAKER_02: He never heard of him before, but he saw maybe one match with him recently. This is from his video. Krasimir will be upset with me for showing this, but otherwise you guys wouldn't probably know. Look at this. This is he versus Krasimir, European Championship final.
SPEAKER_02: He actually top rolled and Krasimir says that this guy is very, very strong in hook. And he's going to pull against a very tough opponent from Ukraine, Petro Marharint. Do you know Petro Marharint, Arsen? I remember him, yes. Where will they fight? At this event too? Yes.
SPEAKER_02: Petro Marharint in Moldova event in 2018, he beat John Burzink, he beat Rewaz. I think he beat... You know, right? Yeah. I think he even beat, he even beat, I don't know if it was like which category it was, but he even beat Davit Dadikian, I think. But it was like six years ago. They both were very young, you know. They both were very young and
SPEAKER_02: And let me see, I think the lucky I just put the video. Yeah, right here. I don't know if you could see, but anyway, so the guy, his wrist, Petro Marharint has a wrist, like, incredibly strong, incredible, like, very, very hard to talk about. What do you think about Petro Marharint's wrist, Ivan? Do you remember him?
SPEAKER_02: Yes, I remember. I remember him pulling. And I think his wrist is one of the best. So it's really interesting, yes. Yeah, one is very hard to hook. He topples Krasimysh. And the other one is just strong enough to hook Rewaz Lutizze, the WAF shape of Rewaz Lutizze, who had a war with Levan at the WAF 2018. Emir, get your phone charger.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah. And what do you think, Ivan, about this one? I would bet on Petro because he's more experienced. And I saw him many times. Only because of that. And when Nugzari pulled Krasimir, did Krasimir try to hook him? Yeah. Because he beat him twice. He beat him two times.
SPEAKER_02: First, Krisimir tried hook, and next time he tried top roll, I think. Yes, when you showed. I think both times he tried hook. One was probably without the strap, I think. And I think the second one was with the strap. But I don't exactly remember. I was there, I watched it, but I don't remember the difference, yeah. And what do you think, Arsene? Arsene, who do you think will win?
SPEAKER_04: I also think that, well, first of all, since Ngin is responding to him, apparently he is really a very strong guy. And since he was able to beat Krasimir, then yes, there will probably be a war. But it's not difficult for someone to give a preference, because the Georgi team is just incredible. And they can add every three months. So it's hard for me to say. But judging by the way he beat Krasimir, I think, well, at least,
SPEAKER_01: He thinks it can be a war but overall he thinks that Georgi can become better quickly. So he thinks that
SPEAKER_02: uh it's possible for him to win yeah and and what do you think uh brandon you're probably not familiar to either athlete but who is the guy that petro is pulling petro is pulling against uh nugo oh because the the georgian guy that just toppled uh krasimir
SPEAKER_02: I'm just not familiar with either of them. Yeah. I want to show you. This is Rewaz versus Petro. See, Rewaz is trying to topple and Petro is hooking him. And Petro Marharint was maybe 100 kilo, as far as I remember, because a few months before that, he was 95 kilo category.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, the guy, I mean, to hook Rewaz without strap, not so much forward coming, but with the wrist power is just very hard. Yes. Very hard thing to do, yeah. Anyway, so let's go to other one.
SPEAKER_02: this is you are you you are you like familyers like arsene and uh ivan masyshenko ivan just shared his opinions about this matches but still you know you can add your opinion whenever you want ivan um but brandon you also know uh sandris
SPEAKER_02: And do you remember Ibragim Sagov, Brendan? The Russian athlete that pulled against Tata Kings. Yeah, and he was an AMC before that too, right? Four times AMC champion he is, I think, as far as I know. Yeah, I remember him, yeah. It's 105 kilo category. On the day that you pull in Arsene, there are also three other 105 kilo matches in the same day.
SPEAKER_01: If you need to translate Arsenal, let me know. No, I got it. Did he ask me that question? I didn't hear the question, but apparently we're discussing Sandris Ibragim. What do you think about this match?
SPEAKER_04: Arsene, can I ask you something? Can you try to speak English as much as possible and then whenever you cannot, then because... So, Engin, it's difficult to me explain. I can understand all things that you say, but for me it's difficult to understand what say guy, because he speak American English and it's difficult to me to understand him.
SPEAKER_02: yeah yeah but but still like what do you think about who's gonna win you think yes you know you know
SPEAKER_04: Oh, you know, if Sagov have one centimeter here, he absolutely win this match. But I don't know how his wrist now because I think maybe the last time I see he have some problem with his elbow and I don't know how he shape now. But I think yesterday I watched his training and he is very, very good.
SPEAKER_04: so ibrahim is very very strong guy and for me for me favorite you think yes yes yes but i'm not in this much i'm not uh i'm not objective
SPEAKER_04: i'm not objective in this much because ibrahim for me is very good athlete his technique his power is very uh very good he likes the way he pulls so here he's yes
SPEAKER_02: Today I asked Bojidar, you know, he was injured, you know, are you able to hook now or only still top roll? He says, I can, but I'm scared to break somebody's hand, he says. We're talking true. Bojidar, Bojidar. Yeah. Anyways, and Brandon, what do you think about this match? Since you know both guys. I think Sandris is naturally a little bit bigger. Am I right?
SPEAKER_00: I think he's a little bit taller, but Ibragim is not a small guy either. He's really also a big guy. Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to go with Sandris just on like natural frame and size, height advantage, I would say more. Yeah. I could go either way though. I don't, it's hard to say. Yeah. Brandon, you know, since the last event,
SPEAKER_02: know right now the european union countries are considered as west so you and sundries now teammates we are am i am i in the west you are in the west of course the sundries now is in the west as well i saw a picture earlier on your cover photo or something and it looked like i was on the east side i was like that doesn't make sense oh no no that is not separated east and west yeah that is just yeah
SPEAKER_02: Anyway, so let's go to the next one. This is Talgat Aktaev versus Betkili Oniani. Arsene, are you familiar with these guys? Talgat Aktaev from Kazakhstan and Betkili. Yes, yes, I am. You know both of them? Yes, yes, yes, yes. Yeah. What do you think? Left arm?
SPEAKER_02: They both are world champions. After last year beat Oleg Zok, not last year, but 2022. Only Mirov, I think. Yes, only Mirov. No, no, no, no. 2022 he beat in Antalya. Yeah, in Antalya, Vaforz. So I don't know...
SPEAKER_04: Vanya, you better translate here, or I'll miss it. As for these two guys, I think that at the moment, I'll probably repeat it again, the Kazakh and Georgi teams are the strongest. And since I'm impressed by the athletes from these two teams, it's hard for me to say. Well, there will probably still be a war, because Betkely is also a very good athlete, and it's hard for me to answer who will be the favorite here. John's point.
SPEAKER_01: Difficult to say. Arsen is impressed both by Kazakh and Georgi team and he thinks that these two are now best in the world. He thinks it may be a war and he cannot say who will win.
SPEAKER_02: You say that these two are both like best in the world, but at the East versus West, number one rank is Artem Taino, and number two is Sasho. So this is 95 kilos, not 85. You mean that in general, yes, the Georgi and Kazakh schools are better? Yes, yes, I'm saying that, yes, yes, I'm saying that the Georgi and Kazakh schools are better. Not exactly in the category, because in the category, 95, it turns out, is the first class. Yes, I understand, of course.
SPEAKER_02: generally that uh overall kazakh school and georgian oh yeah yeah yes yes you're right and brandon are you familiar with these guys yeah oneani was he the one that pulled oleg at the last east versus west
SPEAKER_02: Oh, no. Nobody could hook him. The only guy that beat Oleg Zok at the East Coast was Dadikyan. This guy beat Oleg Zok at the Waffles in 2022 with the shoulder pressure. Oh, okay. This time, both guys right now, they both are going inside. And Betkili, the Georgi, has beaten Akhtar once.
SPEAKER_02: I remember in 2017 Waffles in Hungary. So it looks like you are not so much familiar with these guys. I guess not. I was thinking the other guy, Oniani or whatever was a top roller, but
SPEAKER_02: No, Oniani is also going inside. They're both going inside. Talgat is a flash spinner, while Oniani can pull like 10 minutes in hook. You remember, I don't know if you saw the match they posted lately, him versus Rez Serdekian. Did you see they posted on Facebook, like they have like a two-minute long match, you know?
SPEAKER_02: You know Rez from Armenia? They live in California now. Oh, Rez. Yeah. Oh, okay. Yeah, they had a long, long, long hook match. Anyway, so another thing I want to ask you, Brandon, like, where are you now, your shape? Like, how good are you compared to your past? Are you already at near your best and you are planning to even pass?
SPEAKER_00: that that uh your previous best or you are a little bit behind in trying to reach your best so i'm i've been getting better as the years have gone on and the good thing about now is i've had a brachioradialis like nagging injury that went on for years like every time i eyes or back pressure pronation it would flare up
SPEAKER_00: It was, it was a setback because it was always affecting my training. I couldn't do it as frequently and as heavy as I wanted to. And the last few months I started stretching, uh, I figured out a way to stretch it while laying in bed. So I stretch it at night and in the morning and it's, I can train rise.
SPEAKER_00: multiple times a week now and it doesn't bother me and I can go heavy but I'm super excited to increase my numbers like all things back pressure and I think I have plenty of time to do it before my match against Carson. And you think you will be even better than your previous best?
SPEAKER_02: For sure. Yeah, I already am. I am right now. Is this, may this be your most important match or one of them in your career? To win this match? No, no, this match, like how important this match, like compared to your career, you know, till today? I think my most important match so far was against Craig Tullier because that put me at the top in North America and opened up like so many doors and
SPEAKER_00: gave the opportunity first in the first place so but now we're we're moving up the ladder still and arson would be the biggest one in my career if i if i beat arson but i think it would be more if i lose it's okay because it's arson but if i win it's huge yeah you have you have this much to win and this much to lose
SPEAKER_02: yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and arson does this put pressure on you that you are arsene lily and now if you lose like does it have stress on you pressure psychologically for me yeah does it put pressure on you because like you are your name is very big like in eight years from 2005 to 2013
SPEAKER_02: You did things that 99.9% of the athletes couldn't do in their 30-year career. The guys that you beat, I don't want to count them, but I think you have wins against almost everybody. So now you're coming back after 11 years.
SPEAKER_02: Like, do you feel nervous? Are you nervous? Like 11 years, you are not on the stage. And also it's not possible to be at your best after three, four months training. Are you scared to lose?
SPEAKER_04: Of course, of course, I'm probably more nervous than usual, because 11 years is simple and really no one knows what I can do now. We lift iron, I like iron, I lift weights, but no one knows what I can do on the table. So in terms of what I can be very good, maybe I'm very bad. So, of course, I'm nervous and for me it's probably
SPEAKER_04: It's a big fight in my life, you know, to try to come back and fight in 11 years. So, yes, it's a responsibility on me. There was a question about responsibility and your name. You were the best for many years.
SPEAKER_04: created such a big name, and now you just have this additional factor, because if you were there from scratch, yes, this is one thing, and now you have such a past that additional ... Well, I'm starting from scratch now. The fact that Arsene Lili was in the past, it doesn't matter, he stopped performing 11 years ago. Now Arsene Lili is back, the same guy with the same name, but no one knows what he can show. Try to translate it, there is too much information now.
SPEAKER_01: Arsene feels nervous, but not because of his big name. His big name, as he says, is in the past, and now he is another Arsene de Lis, who is starting from the beginning. But he feels nervous because he doesn't know what is his form, because wait awaits, but he is not sure how he will pull.
SPEAKER_02: in real match so uh that is uh what makes him nervous a bit and are you planning to do some table time are you already doing it in the past when i asked you you were saying that we when we do the table time we get injured that's what you were saying but now how are you gonna know your level
SPEAKER_04: If you don't do any table time, are you doing any table time with those? No table time.
SPEAKER_01: Unfortunately, he has his tendinitis and it doesn't allow him to pull at the table. So just weights and rubber bands now. Wow. I mean, listen, it's not my business, but at least with the light guys, you need to do it some to feel it, you know.
SPEAKER_04: He never did table time. Only weights and some rubber bands for some workouts before the competition.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but do I remember wrong that you said that sometimes you all together before the event was going to the mountains and pulling like a few days and then coming? How did I not understand, Vanya? Well, he remembers that he heard that you still worked a little behind the table before the tournament. Maybe you were working, I don't know.
SPEAKER_01: Before this tournament? Well, not now, but when you were preparing earlier, there was some kind of work behind the table.
SPEAKER_04: No, no, no. First of all, I worked with my coach, Ibragim Chochiv. We worked after every training session. But the last 3-4 years, when this evil Picandelit appeared, it was impossible at all. Because you fight even with small guys, and then you couldn't train for a week or two at all. Therefore, without any deception, for the last 3-4-5 years, I didn't work at all.
SPEAKER_01: he did some table work with his coach Chuchiev in the first years but his last three four years of his career no in the 2010s yes he didn't do any table time because of that tendon it of both golfers elbow what
SPEAKER_02: if it is it is both for the outside and tennis no no inside inside okay okay yeah brandon iraqli zirakashvili oleg petrenko who is winning here that's that's right-handed yes um i like i i like iraqli's chances i think oleg and he's very strong i think
SPEAKER_00: I think Irakli just looks really good right now. You talking about his last East Coast match or even talking about his training with Vitaly in Dubai? His last and the after polls and I know it doesn't mean that much. I just have just a feeling I guess that Irakli is going to win it. And you Arsene?
SPEAKER_04: This is probably the most interesting match, which is much more interesting than watching Larratt and Levan Saginashvili. Because Oleg Petro is an incredible, just some kind of animal force. And what is happening in Iraq for me now is...
SPEAKER_04: He finds this match most interesting, even more interesting than the Levan Saginashvili-Larek match.
SPEAKER_01: He thinks that Oleg has some animal power, that he's too strong on the one hand. And on the other, he thinks that Irakli is the most talented athlete now. First, he thought that Gasparini would be second John Brzenk, but now he thinks that Irakli would be that guy.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, okay. Anyway, so let's go to Fia Lysak and Ekaterina Nikisheva. Brendan, are you familiar with these ladies? I'm familiar with Fia and I've seen Ekaterina Nikisheva compete, but I can't recall any of her matches. Okay, and you, Arsene?
SPEAKER_04: I don't know anything about this match because I think Ekaterina hasn't competed in 5 or 6 years. So I can't say anything about this match. Okay, so this is an unknown match for you. Okay, Arten. Mindaugus Tarasaitis vs. Artur Makarov. It will be a great match too.
SPEAKER_04: First of all, Makarov is increasing a lot now. I think he's interested in armwrestling again. And the guy... What's his name, Vanya? Mindaugus? Mindaugus. Mindaugus, yes. He won against Prokopchuk in the most difficult match. So I think there will be another war. I don't know. Of course, we will root for our guy. But I think it will be a very difficult match for both of us.
SPEAKER_01: He likes this match, another great match. He thinks that Artur Makarov now is more motivated and he started to train better. Also, he thinks that Tracetis is great and there will be war for sure. It will be a difficult match for both of them. Brandon, are you familiar with Artur Makarov? Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Well, here's the thing. I mean, you're so good at picking matches that every match is really 50-50 because we don't really know what's going to happen. So I can only, we can only just make opinions and it's so close. What do you think about it? You don't need to say this guy is going to win, but what do you think about this match? Like, how do you see it? You don't need to say this guy is going to win or something. If you want, you can say it, of course, but like...
SPEAKER_00: i i think uh makarov is extremely impressive in terms of his uh just like his physique and his arm and hand yes massive and um i think mendougas is very impressive arm wrestler and his style and technique and his experience so i think it's it's like brute strength versus like yep technique yeah it's very
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I agree. I agree. Yeah. Power versus art. Yeah. This is this is what I was called. Like, I mean, that was like, really, he's an artist at the table. And let's go to the next one. Schoolboy versus Leonidas. Arsene, do you know them? I know this guy, but...
SPEAKER_01: I don't want to offend anyone, but this match is less interesting for him than others. And Brandon?
SPEAKER_00: I'm going to go with school boy. I think he's more experienced and I consider him more of an arm wrestler. I don't think Leonidas has been around long enough. And I think he's going to go to a king move. And I think school boy is already expecting it and is going to be prepared for it. Were you impressed when Leonidas beat Larry?
SPEAKER_02: Because I see that Larry lately in the U.S. is not doing bad. He almost pinned Sandris. Maybe it was even a pin in one match. And then I heard he has some wins against Derek Simmons. I don't know if it was practice or tournaments. I have seen him training with John and then really giving a hard time to John. And Leonidas beating Larry. You don't think that he has any chance because of his
SPEAKER_02: maybe he may be too strong or not not at all nico legit all of larry wheel's wins were either um i i'm gonna go with school boy might but nico okay and this one i just want i don't want so much detailed uh opinion but just like tell me who is gonna win only the name
SPEAKER_02: Brandon Arsene or versus Arsene Lillier? Brandon? Brandon, Brandon will win. All right, I can't be arrogant, so I'm going to pick Arsene. Okay, so you both pick each other, okay. He's a very good guy, very good guy. Yeah, they both are very nice. But Brandon, don't believe him. He's not this nice at the table.
SPEAKER_00: i know i yeah i don't i don't expect him to be i wish he was i wish he was more disrespectful because then i could let the lion out of the cage yeah yeah yeah yeah i agree um okay let's go michael todd versus frank lamparelli arsene
SPEAKER_04: Another interesting match. According to the names, it seems that Michael Todd is a favorite in this match, but the Frank Lamparelli that I saw with Matt Mask, it seems to me that it will not be an easy walk for Michael Todd. But still, I think Michael Todd is a favorite in this match, probably 60-40. But it seems to me that it will not be an easy walk for him, especially after the injury.
SPEAKER_01: He thinks that Michael is the favorite, maybe 60%. But he was impressed by Frank's last arm fight when he won Matt Musk. And he thinks it will be difficult for Michael to win. Also because of his injury. Both factors. On the one hand, Lamparelli seemed to be better. And...
SPEAKER_00: So it will be a good match also. And Brandon? I think Lamparelli has a good technique to face Michael Todd's style. But Michael's coming back. He looks impressive. I think he's going to be too strong. But I don't know how recovered he is from his injury at the same time. But I'm going to say 65-35 Michael Todd.
SPEAKER_04: Okay, so you are saying that Frank technically is good, but he may not have enough horsepower to finish, Michael? Horsepower and endurance, yeah. Yeah, okay. Let's go. Davit Samushia versus Aydar Khan. Arsen. I think this will be one of the most difficult matches for Samushia. Because, once again, how can these guys from Kazakhstan prepare? It's unbelievable.
SPEAKER_04: It's hard for me to say who will win, but it will definitely be a tough match for Davit. We'll see. It's a very tough match to say who will win. Very difficult match to say anything, to predict the winner. He thinks that it may be the most difficult opponent for Davit.
SPEAKER_02: Because of the explosiveness speed? Yes, yes, yes. Strong explosive. What's that? Sorry? Yes, strong explosive. Very dangerous. Yeah. Brandon, you pulled Davit. And in the last event, have you seen Aydar Khan's victory against Vala?
SPEAKER_00: yeah i saw it yeah and how do you see now until i beat david he is beating everybody else wow okay what what do you mean are you not gonna say beat i'm i'm just saying because david beat me so he has to be everybody else now oh okay okay now i understand yeah okay being um go ahead sorry
SPEAKER_02: it's a very tough match articon looked really impressive in his last one and very very surprised of uh vladimir miro who you know the guy travis calls alexander all the time you know when he was pulling against david okay last event you remember one guy he really gave you one pin david one time
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, he had endurance in there with Davit, which was really impressive. He looked strong too. Yeah, if he comes back with six months training, the things will be even more interesting in that category. Okay, this is interesting. Ermes Gasparini versus Ali Canmurado left arm, Arsene.
SPEAKER_04: I'm curious about how you picture this on your mind, you know, because we have no idea. Go ahead. Alizhan Muratov for me is the most impressive guy which I ever see in arm wrestling because it's...
SPEAKER_04: I must say it's Russian because I have so much emotion. Artem, do you think that he is a little bit like you, a little bit, but you are more out while he is more in, but he is just like same, the hit? Yes, yes, I think yes, but it's the most speed hooker in the world, I think, yes, left hand.
SPEAKER_04: So, Angel, I... Speak in Russian, yeah, okay. Yeah, okay. Go ahead, go ahead. For me, Alizhan is just something incredible. Now, the most interesting match that I represent in armwrestling, I would like to see you, Vanya, and Alizhan with the left hand. That would be a real armwrestling, and it would be very interesting. Well, incredibly interesting. As for this fight, Alizhan is definitely a favorite, and I think Ermes...
SPEAKER_01: Almost no chances with the left hand. Arsene thinks that Alizhan is the best hook puller now. Or maybe ever. Or maybe ever. Or maybe ever. Or maybe ever. Or maybe ever. Or maybe ever. Or maybe ever. Or maybe ever. Or maybe ever. Or maybe ever.
SPEAKER_04: Ever, ever, Engin, ever. Because Neva was a sportsman who was so strong and so speedy. Yeah. And interesting thing, the guy also has good endurance as well. Yeah. Vanya, please translate what you said about your match. He also wants to see my match against Olezhan.
SPEAKER_02: yeah it will happen it will happen don't worry about it everything will happen we are still alive yeah yeah that's why i'm here you know if i didn't believe that you know this beauty you know would be together you know i wouldn't be uh uh so what do you think about hermes casparini
SPEAKER_04: He thinks that is on his absolute favorite of this March. Yes. Unfortunately, Gasparini have, I think maybe 10% for win. Only 10%. And Brandon, what do you think? I think, well, Gasparini is primarily a right-handed arm wrestler and Alexsandr is amazing. He's like the,
SPEAKER_00: chuck norris farm wrestling like it's gonna go on yes yes yes so you are saying that alijan is gonna win you think i i'm gonna pick alijan i'm gonna give hermes a little better chance though i'll say 30 for hermes 70 for alizon uh okay let's see let's see hermes
SPEAKER_02: I have a guy here, he says your chance is only 10% against Ali Can you see them? Or no? No problem. It's my opinion. I can see it all time. You see them? I mean, why would you? How about now? No, no. No, no.
SPEAKER_02: Wow. I can't see. I don't see nothing. You don't see anything? One second, one second. Okay, now. Put only one face on the screen. Put only one face on the screen. Anyway, so basically, Arsene Lille is saying that your chance to beat Ali Can is only 10%.
SPEAKER_02: Arsene, don't be upset. We are just joking. No, no, no. He really said that. No problem. It's my opinion. Yeah. It's a good 10%. Really? Listen, listen. Is this guy, this 105 kilo guy, is he going to beat you? Is he going to beat you? No. He's too small, right? Yeah. I mean...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, 100, 105 kilos. He should just go and play with the light heavyweights. Oh, you are already 130, yeah. So you're going to beat him 3-0? Engin, you know... Say, say, Arsene, say. Engin, you know that it's not a problem that if a guy is about 100 kilograms and...
SPEAKER_02: 140 kilograms. It's not a problem. It's very difficult match to Ermes. He said it's no problem. He said that he was 100 kilos. He was beating the heavyweights. Yeah, but Arsene also beat Richard Lapkus. He beat like some...
SPEAKER_02: So Arsene is better than Alexsandr Morado? Yeah. But Arsene says that there has never been... Engin, another opinion. 100% for Ermes. 100% for Ermes. Arsene says 100% you're going to win. Arsene, listen. One year later, one and a half year later, are you going to beat this guy as well? Right arm? No, I don't know. He said it's impossible because you are too small.
SPEAKER_02: I think many guys in the past said the same thing. Yeah. He says that right arm is impossible. Arsene, whenever he repeats like this, impossible, impossible, you want to just turn and beat him? I almost didn't understand.
SPEAKER_01: Every time they tell you it's impossible, you want to... Well, it gives you motivation. Every time they tell me it's impossible, I win. He wants to teach you good quality top roll.
SPEAKER_02: Maybe one day. He said maybe one day. Listen, when you say impossible, I asked him and he said in his life, every time somebody said impossible, he beat them.
SPEAKER_02: He said he will wait for you, Arsene. Brandon is over there. Brandon is like, you know, come on, Arsene. Just first beat me, you know, and then you can talk about it. But Brandon never said impossible. Oh, Brandon never said impossible. He didn't use that magical word. The magical word, yes. Yeah. He's going to be waiting a long time because Arsene's going to lose motivation after the next match.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, Ermes, you said you will have to wait a long time for Arsene, because this is Brandon said, because after Arsene loses to Brandon, Arsene is going to lose the motivation. So Brandon, Brandon apologized, you know, you saw that this mess is not going to happen.
SPEAKER_02: Brandon is so good guy all this evening but now he have the great mistake great mistake oh okay anyways you continue eat it eat pizza pasta yeah yeah eat them eat them yeah okay
SPEAKER_02: You say your bicep is 54, when I measure it's 50, 30. Come on, come on. Yeah, you measure like this way. Not this way, but this way. Take care. Bye-bye. Yeah, yeah. He says hello to you guys. Yeah. Brandon? Arsene just said that you made a huge mistake by saying such thing.
SPEAKER_02: He was thinking you were a good guy until you said that. I just wanted to make him motivated and help him to train harder. Okay. Yeah. I must say thank you. Thank you. Yeah. Brandon thinks that you are as of now, you are not enough. So you need to train harder.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, guys, listen, don't be upset with me. I'm an organizer. I need to fill the pot, you know. No, no, no, super, Enki. Now it's show. I see you in November that now armwrestling is another level because in the past when I competed, it was only sport. Now it's like UFC. It's like show. It's like...
SPEAKER_02: yeah yeah so it's great i'm happy that it's going that direction yeah anyway so we were talking about the last matches so okay you both said that alejan is gonna beat hermes and georgie versus kurdeca swedco versus kurdeca
SPEAKER_04: I don't know. I've never seen anyone beat Kourdetchev with a brush like that. But I've seen him so many times at competitions. Every time he adds something. He's an incredible guy. I really like the way he fights and doesn't give up.
SPEAKER_04: He thinks it's 55% in Georgi's favor. He has known Georgi for long.
SPEAKER_01: uh he thinks that georgie's wrist is one of the best he never saw anyone to open his wrist also he thinks kurdecha makes great progress and becomes better every match so it's difficult to say but he would he would give more chances to georgia you have never seen george's wrist
SPEAKER_04: It was the first time I saw Kurdecha. It was 2017. Kurdecha is a very good guy in sports, because he can be better and better from competition to competition. So, Brandon, what do you think about this match?
SPEAKER_00: I think that match from 2017 is nothing compared to where they're at now. I've never seen anybody do as good against Devon that lost as Georgi did. I mean, he stuck with the same style the whole time, but he was able to fight every single round. And Devon wears everybody out to where the point they just give up and they can't do anything.
SPEAKER_00: toys with them but devin devin was still never able to really take georgie's hand and we see devin do that to everybody and but uh kardeccia is a different build he's tall he's huge but i'm gonna go with georgie okay db talk thank you for your super chat i think ivan could beat chefy because
SPEAKER_02: Currently, Dave doesn't do well in a hook. Also, Kamil thinks Ivan could beat Jerry's right arm. Does Ivan agree? I would like to pull both of them if I have a chance. I think I have some chances, yes. Jerry maybe is comfortable for me.
SPEAKER_04: uh for my style but i know that he can be very strong in uh defensive hook also because i remember him uh holding hajimarat yeah so he can also yes but hajimarat was yeah hajimarat was 85 kilograms you 20 i think 120. no chance jerry is not arm wrestler no chance with ivan no chance
SPEAKER_04: Did you just say Jerry is not armwrestler? Did you say Arsene? So it's armwrestling. I don't know. It's armwrestling. What is it? It's armwrestling. Who is it? He's a hooker or he's top roller. Who is this guy? That is shoulder pressure, man.
SPEAKER_04: Shoulder pressure, yes or no? Yeah, there is shoulder pressure, yeah. So how you expect? I want to ask you one question. Okay. Shoulder, best shoulder pressure after the very quick hooker. Who have more chance? The one who is stronger.
SPEAKER_02: No, Engie, in this match, the power is not interested in much with this technique. The one round, Gennady tried to hook Jerry. Gennady went inside and Jerry pressed him down. So another... What's that? Yes, but...
SPEAKER_02: Jerry has some defensive hook. Yeah, Jerry not only defensive, also offensive as well. He can press this way as well. He doesn't always have to do. He can do this as well, you know. I mean, I understand. I don't like to pull against this style. But just because I don't like this style...
SPEAKER_04: i cannot call them like not arm master or something because i mean the guy has a big technique king's move king's move technique is better than this technique i don't know what is what is it it's it's what what i must training that i competed with shoulder pressure what am i training dry chest chest everything you know everything that is pressing forwards
SPEAKER_04: For me, it's not arm wrestling. It's the most, how to say, disgusting one. I will tell you something. Jerry would destroy you. Maybe me, because I have not competed 11 years. Yes, maybe. Even two years later, he would beat you. Nasty. One question for you. I'm just teasing you.
SPEAKER_04: He hates such arm wrestling. He what? He hates such arm wrestling.
SPEAKER_02: no i understand it's just like very very difficult to pull against because you are toppled i'm also going outside you really need to control the the the pronator to make him turn this way so that he cannot use the tricep because when when you turn this way
SPEAKER_02: now your tricep is working to lose inside that's why people like going in like when kamil kamil tried to do the same thing to ivan ivan was so easily thrown him and beat him you know um the only thing i like about this technique is because it's it beats uh king's move
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I mean, I call it like open arm top roll. If this is, this is, this is, this is not arm wrestling for sure. Because this is shoulder, like your arm cannot come there until you either need to break it or you need to press so much, the guy will feel hurt and he will need to jump up. But if it is about the table level, the shoulder like this, I respect that. And I call that open arm top roll. If I would ever call something kinks,
SPEAKER_02: Anything that John Brzenk should be doing should be called king. Yeah, king is moving. He's the king, you know. So anyway, so you both are thinking that Georgi is the favorite. And the last match, and then we are finishing. Let's start with Brandon. Devon Larratt versus Devon Levan Saginashvili. Well, we all know that Devon got injured in the last match. And since then, Devon got injured in training.
SPEAKER_00: And Devon is stating that he is stronger than he was before. I think Devon has better chances this time than he did the last time. And I remember watching the last, the last time they pulled, I remember watching it live. And after the first round, I saw LeVon's wrists get flattened just a little bit. And I was telling him, I was telling everybody in the room that Devon was going to win. And then the very next match he got it.
SPEAKER_00: i thought for sure that he after that first round he was gonna wear him down more and more and eventually take over it didn't happen but i think this time he has better chances he's smart he knows what he's up against levon's coming off an injury i'll i'm gonna i'll say 55 45 devon
SPEAKER_02: wow i i asked devin what you know his his uh that move you know that he is doing lifting from the ground that pronation move he calls it um i asked him you know how much he was doing that when he pulled levan first time he said he was 135 pounds
SPEAKER_02: And now he just did recently 160. So this is almost like 20%. And we still have like seven weeks. So in that move, he is 20% stronger than that time. So you are saying 55% Devon and 45% Levan. And you, Arsene?
SPEAKER_04: Larratt never ceases to amaze me. I also said that Cyplenkov is the absolute favorite in the match against Larratt. But Larratt just showed incredible form. And probably we all agree on one thing, that if Larratt can stop Levan in the first and second round, then there are chances for him. I just don't know, Levan is an incredible athlete. I've never seen so much strength in one person.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know. It all depends on whether Devon will be able to stop Levan. He is very impressed by Devon and last time he thought that Denis would win, but Denis lost.
SPEAKER_01: It's difficult to say, but in the end, who will you put? Well, probably, Levan is a favorite. Just an incredible power. But he thinks that Levan may be the favorite this time again. Big favorite or small?
SPEAKER_04: uh i think maybe middle middle middle middle inside something like 70 70 or 65 35 maximum 65 35 percent for everyone yes but they won't have chance so we should talk about we should talk about
SPEAKER_02: the possibility they want to stop him or not like 35 he will stop him 65 he will not be able to stop and you are saying that once he stopped he's gonna win is devon gonna win if he stops him uh if he can stop him i think maybe 50 50. oh even the if the match stop level still has 50 chance per se yes okay yes
SPEAKER_04: That's interesting. And how do you think that Devon should pull outside to his wrist, Devon's wrist? Well, he can only stop him in the losing position near the pillow. I don't know how he will do it, how he will stop him. But I can only imagine that somewhere near the pillow he will be able to catch him in the first or second round, if he can.
SPEAKER_02: that he could only stop him in the losing position somewhere yeah yeah only in the losing position with with hand or without he doesn't know okay okay i understand and another thing uh ivan matushenko has a match against artem morozov one is 115 kilo heavyweight champion the other one is super heavyweight champion um what do you think about this match arsene
SPEAKER_04: Vanya, are you going to fight with your left hand? On the left, in June, yes. Left. It's a very tough match, because... Well, for the forecast. Because I'm not saying that Vanya is going to switch, but... Ivan, you've really improved a lot lately. I've probably never seen such a strong, high-quality progress from you.
SPEAKER_01: And Morozov is just a giant. So I think it will be a super interesting match. I don't know. I really don't know. Arsene doesn't know. He thinks that I improved, gained some quality recently. And also Artem is great and big and strong. He thinks it will be a difficult match and an interesting one. He doesn't know who will win. And Brandon?
SPEAKER_00: I think he's got the speed and he's got great technique. I think it's going to be a war in a hook. I think it's going to come down. I think Ivan's going to have to really attack his pronator inside and make him fight with his bicep to wear him down. I think Morozov might have more strength, but Ivan has the tools. I'll give Morozov an advantage because he's much bigger and very powerful.
SPEAKER_02: But I like the match. Yeah, me too. I kind of think that Morozov cannot top roll Ivan. Ivan is going to hook him and it will be an inside work. This is what I believe. Speed is with Ivan's side and horsepower will be with Morozov's side. But the important thing is where the match stops. Does it stop like this at the middle or
SPEAKER_02: Will Morozov be like that? That is the deciding factor. They will be interesting. Let's see. Okay, Arsene, this is only for you. We are finishing. Does Ivan have a chance against Alizhan? I'll tell you how it is. The only one who has a chance against Alizhan with his left hand is Ivan Apishenko. 115 kg, right?
SPEAKER_01: He thinks in 115, I have only chances. In under 115. Yes. Yes. If you lose 105 kilos, you will lose power, Ivan. I don't think that you should pull him 105, you should pull him 115. Arsene said, only I have chances under 115. Yes, yes, I agree. No, no, no, no. Yes.
SPEAKER_04: Yes, but there can be a weight difference of about 120 kg. You can find some consensus. And then it will be an incredible match. It's just that at 115 kg you probably have to lose a lot of weight. No, I weigh 113-114 kg. I don't weigh more. Really? Now I weigh 113 kg. Then it will be a super match.
SPEAKER_01: Arsene thought I am 120, but I am 113, 114 now. I want to gain, but I cannot do it. I have to eat maybe more, some junk food. Ivan, your chance against Artur Morozov is higher or to Alexsandr Morozov is higher? Or about the same?
SPEAKER_01: I think that they are different pulls. Artem has defensive biceps, and I usually find it more difficult for me to get through defensive biceps. And I saw that Alizhan lost to Tevberidze. It was long ago, but he managed to Tevberidze.
SPEAKER_02: He was in the youth category, and two days before the seniors, with one of my students, Ali Can had two, three minutes long match. He had two matches together, maybe two minutes, maybe three minutes. And then two days later, he pulled the senior category. Still, he took third place there. Actually, I do not know.
SPEAKER_01: who is more dangerous for me but I think that maybe if I maybe I have more chance against Alizhan maybe I don't I don't know I don't know actually you are saying that your frame is bigger if you stop him your chance is higher then
SPEAKER_01: your chance against Morozov because he's the bigger guy once the match stops maybe his endurance so you are saying that basically Morozov's endurance is better than yes and he's and he's dangerous in his defensive position yes yeah but uh but Alizhan can just uh beat me from the beginning but if he doesn't uh maybe I have some more chances yes okay I understand
SPEAKER_01: And I need to beat Morozov, I think, from the very beginning to the end to win the match. I think. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So you are saying that if Morozov locks himself, then it will be hard for him? Yes, it will be difficult. Maybe I saw that he has some problems also in finishing his opponents also. So maybe I can also hold him, but I'm not sure. Then it will be endurance battle. Yes, but I think his endurance is better.
SPEAKER_02: As far as I saw, as far as I saw. I understand. Yeah. Anyway, so, Brandon, thank you for being my guest. And is there anything you want to say to Arsene before we finish the podcast? Arsene, thank you so much for even giving me the time to get on the table and arm wrestle with me. I appreciate it very much.
