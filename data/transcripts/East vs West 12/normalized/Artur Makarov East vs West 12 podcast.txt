SPEAKER_03: 2017, I think, Poland. European Championship final or maybe no? Poland. I don't remember. How many times did you do it in Mindaugus? Three times in Mindaugus, three times in Antalya. Anything else?
SPEAKER_03: No, Antalya... Three times. Antalya, Yuvun, one, two, Mindaugus, one. So three times. Yes, yes, yes. Antalya, yes. Antalya, three times. And where else? Where else? Where else? Antalya...

SPEAKER_03: Okay. Now, two minutes, Matushenko.
SPEAKER_01: um okay um
SPEAKER_00: Hello, Vanya. Hello, Artur. How are you? The golden key to the translator. Why golden? Because it's hard for us to understand each other. I see, Engin is already writing to me. Am I going or not?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, anyways, how are you, Ivan? Feel good? Great, yes, thank you. It seems that we see each other every two days, you know. But soon it will be over, right? Because not too many Russian pools. Yeah. Yeah, but who knows? I don't know if I can find a translator. Just say for Alizhan what to do. Yes, Alizhan also speaks Russian.
SPEAKER_03: But maybe you understand his language, yes? I don't know. You much understand Kazakh? I mean, you know, we in Kazakh, same nation, like same race people, but we left there 1,000 years ago. If I spend time with them, like even one hour, I understand many things. If I stay there like two months, then probably I would understand everything, you know.
SPEAKER_03: But it will take some time to understand the small changes here. Anyway, so let's talk. I was just telling him that, did you know that his mother is also, Qatar is also Turkish, Artur's? No, no. He speaks some, like I told him to count in Turkish, he counted like,
SPEAKER_03: same as we do you know like the same thing you know yeah anyways but his his father is a russian yeah anyway so let's talk about this we had uh he told me that he is 77 kilo right now and can you ask him he said his form is good but can you ask him in percentage where he thinks that he is right now uh
SPEAKER_02: You have already said that it is good, maybe you want to say something in detail? At the moment, I am gradually gaining form, it is in the process, but I think that I am ready for 80%, 75%, 80%. But in any case, these 10-15%
SPEAKER_02: These are the little things that need to be improved a lot. Therefore, I really hope that I will succeed in bringing it to April 20.
SPEAKER_00: Do you think you will gain 85-85% by April 20 or now? Now you have already gained by 85%? About 75-80% I think I gained. The rest is yet to come, that is, you are going to gain more. Yes, because I started training in early February. That is, I have been training for 1.5 months.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, he started getting ready at the beginning of February, so for six weeks now. He thinks it's about 75%, his form is about 75% of what he wants to have on the 20th or 22nd of April.
SPEAKER_00: uh but his two things that those 20 are most difficult to get but he uh it's in process so he said that he will be around 95 percent um he said that he is about 80 percent now and he is going to get uh other percent uh other persons uh oh he believes he will be 100 percent
SPEAKER_02: I will ask him again. Artur, do you think you will be at your 100% on the 20th? No, 100% from my peak, he means, Engin. No, I probably won't have time to get to the peak, because all the same, thank God, the patients who were with me from the beginning, they are slowly coming to me, so to speak. It makes me very happy. I have already started
SPEAKER_02: He had some injuries. Now they do not bother him so much.
SPEAKER_00: They are not so painful and now he's working with weights which are bigger than he used to work not so long ago. But he thinks that he will be only about 90% in April and he thinks he will be 100% only in summer.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, can you ask him, does he think that 90% of his best will be enough to beat Mindaugus? He thinks so, yes. He hopes so. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: And can you ask him also when he is, because I know that since we pulled, he said that he has been in pain and he never was the same again. This is what he told me personally. But so when he reaches to 100%, does he think that like he can beat everyone in his category or still would be not possible to beat Alain Zolaev?
SPEAKER_00: Engin says that, if I understood correctly, you had a good form when you fought him, but after that you had problems, right? All sorts of injuries. Did you mean Tarasaitis? As far as I understand, with Engin. With Engin. I also don't understand who I fought with. Well, when did you have a good form last time?
SPEAKER_02: For 100% it was the 2017 World Championship. And when I fought with Engin it was 95%. The first time I fought with Engin it was 95%. Sorry, Engin. Once again, he said that he was 100% only in 2017.
SPEAKER_00: at world championship and when he pulled you he was about 95 percent when he pulled me yes uh about uh and what did you ask but what in 2017 he was 70 kilo in when people me was he was 78 kilo uh maybe he's talking about injuries maybe oh i don't know yeah and what was your question
SPEAKER_03: My question is if he can become 100%. About Alain Zaloev, I remember. Yeah, yeah. Not only Alain Zaloev, but can he beat everyone in his category? How do you think, if you get your 100%, will you be able to beat everyone in your category? Well, in particular, Alain Zaloev. If I'm at the top, I think I'll be at the same level as him. That's what I think.
SPEAKER_02: Yes, of course. Because if we take 2017, I was 70 kg stronger than now. Engin was surprised too, because you fought with him at 78 kg. Yes. 95%. And in the world 70. Yes, and I was stronger then. Because nothing hurt me.
SPEAKER_00: Yes, he thinks that he will be about the same level with Alonzo Lloyd. And he will be able to give him an even fight. And I also asked him about the weight in 2017 and when you pulled. And he said that it's true, he didn't have injuries.
SPEAKER_03: He's talking about injury. I would bet on my life that he would kill the 70-kilo shape when he was the 78-kilo shape. Yes. Can you ask him that way? Does he believe that he can beat his 70-kilo shape of 2017, him beat when he pulled me in Supermatch when he was 78-kilo?
SPEAKER_00: He said as he knows himself, he would cheat himself. He would what?
SPEAKER_00: As he knows his weak points, he would cheat and win himself.
SPEAKER_03: So, yes, with weight 78, he would win 70 because he knows his weak points. He knows himself. No, it's not because he's 8 kilos heavier. It's almost two categories above. He's 70 kilos heavier, is what I say. I think it's a difficult question. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Can you ask him, how does he see his chances right now against Mindares?
SPEAKER_02: Right now, what do you think, what are your chances against Mindaugus? I think 60 to 40. In your favor, right? Yes, even 65 to 40, I think so. Right now? No, no, no, not now. Definitely not now, when I will go to... No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
SPEAKER_02: In general, I think that the fight will be equal. But still, I really hope for my preparation. I will even give a little preference to myself. Perhaps it will be wrong. But still, I really hope that I will succeed. Let it be 55 to 45. Right now? No. Not now. Not yet. It's too early. You wouldn't have won.
SPEAKER_00: I think 50-50. It was also a difficult question, maybe. First, he thought it was 65-35 in his favor when he is ready, not right now. Then he changed his mind and said that he thinks that it will be an even fight in April and he will have a little
SPEAKER_00: um advantage maybe 55 to 45 and uh right now he's not ready yet so so right now arthur gives himself 55 and 45 to mindagas right now he gives 50 50 but he's not ready oh 50 50 okay okay i understand yeah what did he watch his match mindagas match with daniel uh but this material uh
SPEAKER_02: And what did he think about this match? And what do you think? I think that Daniel, I think he overestimated himself and in the first two fights he won quite confidently, but there Mindaugus just didn't
SPEAKER_02: When he was being twisted, he gave up. And then he just got uncomfortable. Once he had enough to hook up, and Daniel already started to swim, and he lacked endurance. I think he just underestimated Mindaokas, and that he didn't twist him. He just made a move, but he didn't make a clean move into the hook.
SPEAKER_00: He thinks that Daniel underestimated Mindaugus. And in the first two rounds when Daniel curled his wrist, Mindaugus didn't push his limits, he just
SPEAKER_00: gave his hand, if I can say like this. And also that the New York has some problems with endurance. And only after one good fight, he could not pull effectively anymore. So that's it. I understand, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, let's see. Let's see. And Artur, I know you don't want to, you wouldn't probably want to share, but do you see it is more likely to hook him or toproll him for you, Mindaugus? Maybe you don't really want to answer, but do you think Mindaugus will be better at toproll or hook?
SPEAKER_02: It will depend on the grip. He will decide when session the grip.
SPEAKER_03: He says he can both trouble and hook, but he thinks that it will be hook. I understand, yeah. Let's see how it will be. I think that for the last few years we have seen Artur more going outside than inside, but let's see. Looks like he's ready for both of them.
SPEAKER_03: And then we will start to predict about the matches. And can you ask him? A lot of people are just talking, you know, like I and him, we should pull someday again. And what does he think? He told me last time that, you know, he...
SPEAKER_03: He was sorry about what happened to the bicep, but I told him like, I mean, what can you do about it? You are just pulling and I mean, I got injured, you know, there is nothing to be sorry about it, you know, at least from his side. Yeah. And does he think that someday we will pull again or he thinks that that, that, that thing is closed? Sandris asked about the fight with him.
SPEAKER_00: a lot of people say about this fight that it would be good to fight you again, he also turns out to say that
SPEAKER_00: You were worried that you would injure Engin, his biceps. And he says that you have nothing to do with it, it's a sport, you just fought. How do you think, is the fight between you two possible? Or is it already good? Interesting.
SPEAKER_02: Artur is interested. He would like to pull you if you are not against. If I'm not?
SPEAKER_03: if you are not against if you if you uh want to no no i'm not i'm not against but just like does he does he consider himself beat him he beat me twice or he considered himself he beat me once can you ask him this uh could you could you remind me uh i mean does arthur think of himself that he beat me in two different super matches or he beat me only once
SPEAKER_00: How do you think, Artur, did you beat Engin in two Supermatches or only in one? In one. In one. He says in one. He beat me only once? Yes. In one. Why does he not think that he beat me twice? Why don't you think that he won twice? Because...
SPEAKER_02: In fact, in the second fight, there is nothing to hide, Engin was really stronger, and it was visible. I think the card lay in such a way that Engin was injured, and everything turned out quite the opposite. But in any case, it would be interesting to fight.
SPEAKER_00: Because he does not feel that he was stronger. He knows that he was weaker in that match. But the injury happened. So he thinks that if I wasn't injured, I would beat him? That's what he says? He said that you were stronger that day. So without the injury, you would have won. So he thinks that I deserve one more shot.
SPEAKER_00: him you know one more time you are not the person who need to deserve
SPEAKER_03: um but no no no because listen i mean you you may have a good career or something but if somebody really really really beats you twice i mean it it would be kind of shameless to ask him third time you understand the only only reason that i can ask third time
SPEAKER_03: Only if he thinks that he didn't beat me the second time when we pulled. So this is basically what he told me personally. But I just wanted Mindaugus to also hear this because Mindaugus doesn't think that way. So yeah, I'm now 92 kilo Artur.
SPEAKER_03: program so yeah i need to lose weight and then maybe maybe but yes yeah like 49 years old so i mean it's very very hard but i will do my best yeah
SPEAKER_03: The fact that four rounds, not three, to win.
SPEAKER_03: No, normally, normally in the title matches, there was three times winning was okay, but we made a change. And then last matches that now is just like with the East versus West 11, you were there as well. You had to win four times, you know, against Reno and yeah, another match the same way. So this from three to four wins, is it in his favor or Minda's favor?
SPEAKER_00: There were up to three wins on East-West, and now there are up to four wins. You need to win in a title fight. Is it an advantage for you or a disadvantage? I think it's a disadvantage. I think it's a disadvantage. I think it will be a disadvantage with Mindaugus. Because...
SPEAKER_02: he thinks that is a disadvantage for him because his endurance lets him down sometimes so in
SPEAKER_00: Pulling with Mindaugus, he thinks, is his disadvantage. So he thinks that Mindaugus is better endurance than Archer. I think Mindaugus is better endurance. It's hard to say, actually. But I would assume that yes. I think that yes. But in any case...
SPEAKER_00: He's not sure, but he thinks that maybe his endurance is better than August's. He put him six years ago and now actually he
SPEAKER_03: doesn't know what is his form but still he thinks that yes endurance his endurance is better yeah but in 2018 when they pull they did the first final and that was one and right after that they did the second final and then arthur won even though he lost him in the next next match in the super final you know arthur won what does he think about that oh somebody just came
SPEAKER_00: Oh, what? Somebody just came. Somebody came? Yeah. Perhaps I know. Artur, do you understand what the question is? You fought in 2018, and from the bottom you lost in the first final, but then won in the super final. Yes, absolutely right.
SPEAKER_02: In the preliminary fights, I won. In the final, I lost. And in the super final, I won. That is, you can say that your endurance was better there? Or did you make some mistake there? You know, we didn't have a long fight, so, probably, endurance didn't play a big role here.
SPEAKER_00: It was not the match of endurance, he thinks. Yeah, but arm wrestling is like that, you know. Just consider there was a second round, and Mindaugus was won, and there was a third round, and Artur won. You know what I mean? Yes, but he thinks that they were rather short.
SPEAKER_03: matches and it was the matter of technique not uh not endurance yeah but this can be the same this can be the same like there are two types of endurance one endurance within the match and the other endurance pulling more matches like he lost he lost his wrist and then he came back
SPEAKER_03: And this time he won't, you know. So that can happen in Supermatch as well. Artur, when you see these skinny arms of Mindaugus, don't you feel like you want to destroy him? Look at the arm, you know. When you see Tanya's arms, don't you want to destroy them? I really hope that our fight will be without injuries. That's the most important thing.
SPEAKER_02: He hopes the match will go without injuries. And that's most important. Artur, I think you already know that you will lose, right? I think the table will show. We have, as they say, don't say a word until you jump over. Come on, the table will show.
SPEAKER_03: okay what's happening three three of you speak russian i have no idea and many people who watch us they don't have an idea either i was just saying that um arthur probably already knows that he's gonna lose but he said that uh the table will show so he wasn't he didn't want to go into a big any big trash talk so you could you couldn't provoke him huh
SPEAKER_03: Could not, yeah. It's very hard to do that. It's also hard to do that to Ivan, hard to do that to Denis, like these guys. But Artem Liliev is a little bit different, you know. Yeah, he can get angry and talk back, you know, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Artur, the poll results shows that you are going to win. 55% people think that you are going to win. And 45% mean Douglas. I just hope that people will remember that Artur is a big guy. I hope it will not start saying that Artur is not so strong anymore when he loses. Hmm.
SPEAKER_03: So Artur is going to lose only because he's not strong anymore? If he was strong, he would beat you? You know, that's what happens sometimes because, you know, I beat Cercasso. Then people start saying, ah, Cercasso was in a bad shape. I beat some other guys. Suddenly other guys are in a bad shape also. So I hope that people will not stop saying that Artur is in a bad shape.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but it happens the same way as well. You lost to Aydar Khan and then you beat someone else. You said, from last time I took lessons and that's why I won this time. But it was a totally different opponent, you know, not Aydar Khan. Yeah, no. But you gave him a good match. Whenever I look at Aydar Khan against Vala, then, I mean, you kind of, like, really...
SPEAKER_03: You just needed a little bit more power probably, yeah. Yeah, so it's not that bad. But I'm telling you, my shape was not that great. So I'm happy when I see that I still was able to stop it. Artur, if you lose against him, this is what's going to happen. Is Artur going to say that, Mindaugus? That he lost because he's not as good as he was before? So maybe we should ask Ivan to translate, right?
SPEAKER_03: i don't know i don't know but this is what you mean the artist is going to make the excuse or people are going to make maybe people are going to make it oh but arthur is not i think arthur will take it in a good way he will go back to training okay and what is your winning chance he said 50 50. uh 100 now 100 okay ivan that's yours
SPEAKER_00: I need to translate all that. Yeah, please, yeah. Yeah. Ah, well, here's a talk that's so... Remarkable in terms of percentages. In general, Mindaugus believes that 100% of it is already in his pocket. So... What was also discussed is that... People there...
SPEAKER_00: Now, I think, 55% of the fans of TIFF agree with what Engin said. Well, I didn't quite understand the move there, but... Mindaugus, what's the idea? That people will later say that Artur was out of form? Yes, after I win...
SPEAKER_02: The usual excuse of Armwrestler is that the person was not in shape. Well, in general, such jokes. If you want, you can comment on something. I would like to say. I do not take responsibility for myself. In any case, even if I come to the match, I will come to the maximum.
SPEAKER_02: Artur says he will not make any excuses. He will get ready. He will do everything he can to get ready. So that's it.
SPEAKER_03: Artur, what is this guy doing? Is it rice? I don't know what he's doing. Yeah, yeah. Rice bucket. What is this? Is this for training or the health? A little bit of both, I guess. If you are healthy, you are strong, right? So...
SPEAKER_03: I mean, if you're healthy, you are strong. Would you all your life train this for the calm just to be strong? Or you think you do some other exercises to get strong? Must do some other things to get strong. Yeah. But this is more like to be able to use your power as much as possible by being healthy. So this is good for blood flowing? Exactly. So if I don't do it, I feel like maybe I will start getting injured more.
SPEAKER_00: Did you recommend this? I do, yeah. Good blood flow, good health. Ivan, do you guys have this kind of training in Russia? Many times I saw it in old films, American martial arts. I thought about it, but never did. Maybe we should try.
SPEAKER_03: Maybe we should try just because I saw Matt Mask was doing this. And lately I saw Michael Todd is doing this. I need to, I mean, I would never do that for training, you know, just to be good at arm wrestling. But if it is going to help like blood flowing or something, you know, so you put your hand and you do this outside or you do inside as well.
SPEAKER_03: both so but yeah but it's nice that it also you can go outside yeah so some resistance so that's good but mostly i'm still i'm still focusing on the inside actually just a little bit of outside yeah okay yeah isn't it to raise raise them right yeah yeah after people think that 57 you're gonna win what's your opinion
SPEAKER_03: I mean, until Mindaugus came, it was 54%. Once Mindaugus raised his arm, and then people saw the arm size, and then it just went boom, 57. You know, suddenly they were like, how the hell is this arm going to beat Artur Makarov? Maybe we should ask Artur to show it once again, because before people didn't see it, I think...
SPEAKER_02: Artur, can you show your hand? Mindaugus, I haven't changed it for 10 years, so don't worry, it's the same as it was. Well, that's good then. It just increases the camera.
SPEAKER_03: I mean, one time I asked you, Artur, he said his bicep was 57 centimeters. Is that still the case? I mean, like, I mean, 57 for this weight. I mean, sorry, sorry, 47. My mistake. 47 something for like 75, you know, guy is just, I mean, huge. Can you ask him? Maybe somebody mistranslated me. Is it 47 something, his bicep? I have also 47. Artur, do you have 47 biceps?
SPEAKER_00: Yes, 47-47. 47 and to the left and to the right? No, to the forearm. And the biceps, wow, the biceps are healthy. Yes, he has both forearm and arm 47. Forearm as well, 47? Wow. Yes. And this skinny guy is thinking of beating this guy. Can you believe that? Look at that.
SPEAKER_02: Artur, every time you see his arm, don't you feel like you're going to just crush him, like, destroy him? Look at that. I think it's going to be difficult. I know my coach, who weighs 70 kilograms and is 1.90 meters tall.
SPEAKER_02: And Engin also knows him well, they fought, well, maybe not together, but in some championships. And he won the World Championship many times with such a height, so to speak, with such hands. Artur remembers his coach, who was 190 cm and about 170 kg. Where is Kimi?
SPEAKER_00: Very skinny, yes. Incredible top roller. Who is he? Serhii Blokhin.
SPEAKER_03: He doesn't underestimate skinny arms. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Smart. I'm just teasing Mendoza. Every time I see him, I just can't stop. The way he's just so relaxed and, you know, he's just like... I kind of can't stop myself not to tease him, you know. I think Serhii Blokhin was world champion in 2005 in Japan. Right? 2005 in Manchester.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, and 2005 in Manchester. Yeah, Manchester was the left. Left, yeah. And then Japan, Prawa. Yeah, Prawa, yeah. I think Manchester, Prawa was second after Jabba Saginashvili. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And in Japan, I think he was first and second was Blenko. I don't remember that. Yeah, Alexsandr Blenko was second.
SPEAKER_03: Maybe Bulenkov, or maybe it's Kazimir, maybe Iskandarov. No? Not Kazimir? No, no, no. Bulenkov. Bulenkov was with Lewa, number one, and this, number two. And Blochin was, Sergei Blochin was number one. Very big, big couple. He is, but he's skinny, but his wrist, Blochin's wrist was thick.
SPEAKER_03: And does Blokhin still train? No, last time in 2009 he trained and never trained since then. Yeah, I think 2008 Canada he was fourth. I think number one was Zole, number two was Slovakian.
SPEAKER_03: Do you remember the match between Emil and Alan at AMC, when Emil top rolled Alan and Alan was winning this way?
SPEAKER_03: yeah okay can you tell him that i am thinking that emil is just too like open on top roll like open like this emil is not like this but like this little bit while mindagos is close like mindagos is close if mindagos top roll first can you ask him is there a possibility that mindagos top roll a lot
SPEAKER_02: Do you think Mindaugus will be able to beat Alan? Well, at least take his hand. I think... Why not? Why not? I think everything is possible. It all depends on what form Mindaugus will be in and what form Alan will be in. Everything is possible. I won't be surprised now, I won't be surprised by anything.
SPEAKER_00: But it will be very difficult, I'll tell you. No, but the question is, I didn't quite understand, to win at the top or just to open the hand at the top? Let's say, if he can open the hand, what do you think? I think he can. I think he can. It's more likely. Probably, to reach it is another matter. Yes, yes, this is already another question. This is already another question, yes. Because statically Alan is very strong.
SPEAKER_00: So it's a difficult question. He said, why not? Everything is possible. But it will be very difficult. And Alan is very strong. And he has very good endurance. He said statics. I think he talked about endurance. He has a good wrist. Most probably,
SPEAKER_00: it's easier to take his wrist but not to finish him and why why arthur cannot take his wrist did he take his wrist ever okay
SPEAKER_00: In my opinion, you didn't pass it, but at least they were straight for you. And he couldn't bend it either, right? No, no. There was more straightness, but in any case, due to, probably, the angle, statics and endurance, probably, it's enough. In general, you didn't manage to go up, did you? No, I didn't manage to. So, Artur, yes, he didn't manage to throw. But as far as I remember,
SPEAKER_03: Alan's wrist was straight, so he couldn't also manage to cut out his wrist. So it was somewhere in the middle. I think they both were like flat wrists like this. They both. Yeah, like this. Both of them. Artur didn't really take his wrist, but I think I kind of find Artur super strong, super strong, but not super
SPEAKER_03: hand control, like you understand, like, like Mindaugus says. My opinion, Artur is stronger than Mindaugus, but the Mindaugus hand control is better. Whenever I say that Artur is stronger than Mindaugus, I'm talking about raw power. And this guy is shaking his head. I'm like, you know, come on, you know. Wow. Can you translate that?
SPEAKER_00: I said that Artur is stronger, but Mindaugus has better hand control. And this guy, shaking his head when I said Artur is stronger. Can you please translate? Engin says that he thinks that your overall strength is higher, but Mindaugus has better hand control. Well, he probably means the coordination of the movement.
SPEAKER_00: And when he said that you probably have more strength in common, Mindaugus shook his head and said, I don't agree, I don't agree. I'm not ready to accept it in any way. That you're stronger somewhere. Well, praiseworthy. Mindaugus' side?
SPEAKER_00: uh he said um it's good it's good i said it's good okay yeah this is praiseworthy praiseworthy okay okay let's let's ask to uh let's ask to
SPEAKER_03: arthur arthur by the way sorry so if you will go into these uh yeah you can you can leave yeah yeah exactly so see you next time uh yeah arthur just sleep well uh i'm pretty sure that i'm gonna beat both arthur and alan's a lawyer and uh okay he left you tell him what he what minago said please
SPEAKER_00: What did he say? He said that and got offended and left the chat. He got offended?
SPEAKER_00: He said that, then felt himself offended, hurt, and left the chat, yes. It's a joke, of course. Okay.
SPEAKER_03: big grow goes ending can you ask each of your guests what john brzenk means to them and the support of arm wrestling can you ask him um can you ask arthur what does john brzenk means to him and to arm wrestling for me john brzenk is probably the most
SPEAKER_02: John is the most legendary puller for him.
SPEAKER_00: the founder of armwrestling and armwrestling is a part of his life okay and okay you still translating no he just repeated the same two times that he's a he's a most legendary and what's your opinion shortly
SPEAKER_00: about him uh yes he is the icon of um i would say uh the best of the best and uh um uh the the person that the puller uh who's uh everyone um is looking uh for uh is looking up to
SPEAKER_00: uh for for many decades uh 30 years ago 20 years ago 20 years ago and even now yeah i mean many other people no one is even close to him and uh it will be very difficult for anyone true uh to get close to his uh yeah people people don't understand that you want people who did not witness his prime time people think that we are just
SPEAKER_03: imaginary something we are just creating something understand but people don't understand it when this guy went to the table we all were like focused like like alien from space you know somebody just came and put in there he was just i mean like including today's best ones levan denis devon all of them michael well i mean whoever you know
SPEAKER_03: They all were inspired by him. There has never been anybody that, you know, really was just by everyone accepted as the best ever, you know, like there has never been. And now the new guy comes and then they see him at the age of 59.
SPEAKER_03: And they are like, oh, John, you are extreme. Come on. He wasn't that good. They have no idea. They have no idea how good this guy was, you know. And I wish they knew it. And then, like, it is so easy to talk about something that you did not really witness, you know. And even yesterday or two days ago, I was watching his young year matches. I was like, oh, I missed arm wrestling. Like, to watch him.
SPEAKER_03: like one of the, like made me want to arm wrestle again, you understand? Because I'm so tired, this East versus West, but whenever I watch him, I want to arm wrestle, you know? That this same exact thing was 30 years ago. Still didn't change, you know? Okay. Nugo Chikadze versus Petro Marharint, Artur. Do you know these guys?
SPEAKER_00: Artur, I'm not going to translate it. He's asking about the predictions about the fights. Chikadze vs. Petro Marharint. You probably hear it, right? Who will win? Maybe a small comment? To be honest, I don't really know this fight.
SPEAKER_02: Yes, I don't know much about athletes, so I can't say anything. He cannot comment this match, he's not familiar with the post. Okay. Sandris Šedis vs. Ibragim Sagov. Artur. Yes, I think that... I don't know how strong Sandris Šedis is, but I know that...
SPEAKER_00: He would bet on Ibragim. He knows that Ibragim is getting ready seriously. Unfortunately, he doesn't know the strength level of Sandris, but he would bet on Ibragim.
SPEAKER_02: I think if Talgat manages to enter his main movement, which is strong, and he can win it right away, then Talgat will be the first.
SPEAKER_00: If there is a long fight, I think Betkili will be able to beat Talgat. If Talgat starts and finishes, he will win. If the match stops anywhere, Betkili will win. Fia Isaac vs Ekaterina Nikisheva.
SPEAKER_02: It's hard to say. I will root for our Russian, but for some reason I think FIA will win. He would support our Ekaterina Dmitriyeva, but he thinks that FIA is the favorite in this match.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, Artur. Irakli Zirakashvili vs Sasho Andreev. It's a crazy fight. Right hand, right? Right, right. They already fought, I think. Irakli won the first fight and then Sasho won. I think 50-50, it's very hard to say.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know what kind of form Sasho is in right now. If he is in his best form, then Sasho is my favorite. But in any case, Irakli Zirakashvili is a very strong opponent. And for some reason it seems to me that it's 50-50. It's very difficult to say.
SPEAKER_00: It's difficult to say. He thinks it will be an insane match. If Sasho is 100% of his form, he would give him a favorite. But all in all, he thinks it will be a 50-50 match. Okay. And does he know Leonidas Arkona? Leonidas is nice.
SPEAKER_02: No. No. Okay. And does he know Brandon Assessor? He doesn't know. He doesn't know.
SPEAKER_00: Do you think that after 11 years of absence, Arsene can still become the best in 105 kg?
SPEAKER_02: No, in any case, there is always a chance, but it will not be immediately and not quickly. I haven't trained for a year and as far as I fell down, I realized what day I was on, and here I am 11 years old. I hope he doesn't have an injury, and I think within 1.5-2 years it is possible.
SPEAKER_00: He thinks that everything is possible, but not too soon. He himself didn't train for a year and his shape went down greatly.
SPEAKER_00: to the bottom he said and uh and he thinks it's possible for some but maybe it will take a year and a half or yeah i exactly the same thing i think the one and a half year he needs is what i will be and michael todd frank lamparelli arthur michael todd
SPEAKER_02: he thinks he's gonna win okay and samusia versus aydar khan but
SPEAKER_02: He thinks it will be one of the best matches together with Irakli Sasho.
SPEAKER_00: difficult to predict uh about 50 50 as well but uh still he thinks that uh samusha has uh bad endurance and uh perhaps he will be able to catch uh and uh and win he has a little more chances georgie swedco last three matches georgie swedco alex alex kurdecha um
SPEAKER_02: Good fight. It will be interesting to watch him. For some reason, I think it's Tsvetkov. The percentage is 55 to 45. It all depends on the form. Tsvetkov. 55-45, Tsvetkov. But everything depends on the form. Okay. Okay, so anything can be possible, he says. Okay, this is interesting. Ermes Gasparini versus Alizhan Muratov.
SPEAKER_03: left hand left hand left hand left hand left hand left hand left hand left hand left hand left hand left hand left hand left hand left hand left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm left arm
SPEAKER_02: And for some reason, it seems to me that it will still be this long-term struggle between Alizhan and Ermes. I think the preference will be for Ermes in any case, but I really want Alizhan to win. Most people think that Alizhan will win on the left. Really? Of course. Maybe I just don't...
SPEAKER_00: Because he's left-handed, and Olezhan won the World Championship twice. And he's very strong now. I don't think he's losing to anyone. I'd give Olezhan a preference. Now it's like that.
SPEAKER_00: First he thought Ermes was the favorite. But I told him that Ermes is not so good with his left hand as his right. And he agreed that
SPEAKER_00: okay let's go to the um last one demon larat versus levan saginashvili arthur
SPEAKER_02: And last time when Devon Larratt fought Gasparini, I thought for some reason that Gasparini would win, but Devon Larratt won. If Levan is in good shape, then it seems to me that Levan will win a confident victory.
SPEAKER_00: He thinks that if Levan gets his best shape, he would win. But he also mentioned that last time he thought that Ermes would win. Oh, sorry. Are you talking about the fight between Ermes and Levan? Yes. No, no, no. Ermes and Devon Larratt. For some reason, I was sure that Ermes would win. Yes.
SPEAKER_02: But he also mentioned that when Ermes pulled,
SPEAKER_00: Devon, he also thought that Ermes would win. So Devon can surprise us. But still, if Levan is 100%, if he's ready, he would bet on him. He would bet on him? He would bet on Levan. So basically he's saying that
SPEAKER_03: On the paper, Levan looks favorite, but you cannot underestimate Devon. Devon anytime can do something. This is exactly my opinion. Levan is favorite, but if Devon does something and wins, I don't see this impossible. You understand? I see this possible. And Ivan, I know that we talked many times, but what was your opinion saying?
SPEAKER_03: just the same just the same everyone who knows arm wrestling is like thinking the same you know that one is favored on the paper but that cannot be underestimated yes he has chances this time yeah yeah yeah i mean the the the matches that he won i mean against denny's against chefy against hermes against uh george swedco i mean if if it didn't mean anything to
SPEAKER_03: people then i don't know what what can he do more you know it doesn't mean he's gonna beat levan but he proved that he shouldn't be underestimated this is exactly what i think did you see his picture that he just said you want oh sorry did you did you see the picture he shared uh no you didn't see the the picture i just showed you
SPEAKER_03: Ah, you mean his hands? Yes, I saw that. It's all right. I mean, like, listen, whenever he is alone by himself, normally he doesn't look huge. But whenever he is with someone together, you realize how big he is, you know. He doesn't, he looks skinny, but he is not skinny, you understand? He is really... He is rather skinny, I would say, but he is very tall. And his levels are very big.
SPEAKER_00: and in that case he is very big yes yeah when you say he's skinny he doesn't have fat but trust me his size is big you know when you look at his trapezius and everything you know yes when i met him when i met him i realized that he's bigger than me but i thought he was not so big but he his hands are rather bigger much bigger
SPEAKER_03: yeah and he's probably taller than you as well right around five times yes yes yes yeah he's a huge man you know like you i look at from the videos i see like okay not big whenever we have photo together i look like health help size of him you know you know he is really really like he is also another uh special extraordinary you know athlete
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, we will see. We will see how it will be. And looks like they are... Did you know that I'm going to Tbilisi this Friday? Tbilisi? Yeah, yeah, I go there. We will do some filming and some, you know, promotion, you know, and yeah. And let's see what Levan has to say. And Artur, would you like to say anything else before we finish? Thank you very much for coming to the podcast and
SPEAKER_03: to our event you are one of the athletes that you know always impressed me you know um and i'm very honored to have you in my event anything you want to say before you finish you to mindagas or to uh fans anything
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: First of all, I want to thank Engin for giving me the opportunity to fight and compete at his tournament. It's really great, and I want to thank him. I want to thank my fans, people who will watch me and cheer for me.
SPEAKER_02: I will try not to disappoint you. I want to say to my opponent Mindaokas. The table will show, let's see. We have a good fight and the most important thing is to have an honest fight.
SPEAKER_00: uh so he uh thanks you for uh the opportunity to pull um at your event uh he uh tells his fans uh that uh and those who support him uh that he would do his best uh to get ready and uh to do his best at this fight and he uh tells uh
SPEAKER_00: Also, good luck and that table will show who is stronger. But he would like this armfight to be fair. He would like them to pull fair. What can happen? Does he have any question about the fairness of the competition? No, I mean no cheating in the match.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe I should ask him. Do you think that Mindaugus can cheat? I think that he can...
SPEAKER_02: He thinks it's about psychological pressure. But how? How does he do the pressure on him? I really try to understand.
SPEAKER_00: What can Mindaugus do psychologically? Like he should just not look at you or something? There's a saying in Russian. We usually say we wish a fair fight. It's just a saying. So that everything would be fair. I don't remember you saying this before your matches.
SPEAKER_03: That's why I was curious, yeah. If I heard it from other Russians as well, I would just think, okay, I heard this every time, but... It's not...
SPEAKER_00: It doesn't mean that it's a place where cheating is possible or that the person, the particular person is a cheater. Not exactly. Usually we say like this, let it be fair competition. Okay, general wishes. General wishes, yes. But maybe in case of mandogas, there are some things. Okay, I don't know.
SPEAKER_03: I cannot know. I only know I cannot do anything be helpful. I can only, I mean, do my best about the referees, you know, and this is what I always tell them, you know, just to be 100% fair and square, you know. Anyway, so thank you very much, Ivan, for translation, my friends. You are very tired of translating, so you should probably never ask me. I'm a bit sleepy today.
SPEAKER_03: so we can still ask you right about the other other russian pullers or sure sure yeah yeah okay thank you arthur thank you very much
SPEAKER_03: Guys, one hour, 20 minutes later, Alex Kurdecha and Georgi will be also my guests. And see you soon. Take care, guys.
