SPEAKER_03: Hello guys.
SPEAKER_02: Hello, Petro. Hello, Adnan. Hello, come to Saudi Arabia. Hello, Benji. How are you guys? Hello, Kiwi.
SPEAKER_02: Hello, Sierra. Hello, Victor. Hello, Jeff. Hello, Sylvester. Just started drinking, eating. It's Ramadan, so I'm fasting.
SPEAKER_02: So today we have three lives. One is Fia, the second one is Artur Makarov, and the third one will be Georgi and Kurdecha. Fia just came.
SPEAKER_02: Hello, can you make vertical? Can I? Can I do this? Yes, yes, very good, very good, yeah. How are you? I'm good, thank you, how are you? Good, good, good. After 13 hours fasting, just started drinking, eating, it's Ramadan, month of Ramadan, yeah. So we are fasting, yeah, so...
SPEAKER_01: Fine. One hour ago it wasn't so fine, but now it's okay. So, how is everything? Yeah, it's good. It's a lot to do with the work and training and everything, but I like it. Good. Ready? I'm ready. Ready? Yeah. Ready to fight or ready to get the belt on? Ready to fight.
SPEAKER_01: Ready to fight and then we will see. You told me that you watched Ekaterina Nikisheva's podcast? Yeah, yesterday. So what did you think about it? Yeah, I think it was good. I haven't met her that much, but she seems very sweet and it was a good talk. Did you find her confidence?
SPEAKER_02: yeah yeah what did you think about that confidence because she she seemed like you know she's coming there to win you know of course you are too but she seemed like 100 she said no i think she wouldn't have taken the match if she didn't think she could she could win so yeah but she says 100 this is what i remember i don't know how you remember but i didn't hear she said 100 maybe i didn't listen
SPEAKER_01: that is how i remember but let's see yeah but i i i'm sure she is confident yeah are you uh right now i'm not my i'm not in my top mode for the moment i i was in a small competition in sweden and i lost and i shouldn't have and someone now was it was it in your category or no it was heavier but okay
SPEAKER_02: anyway i have never lost uh against her before and i felt a little bit down but but i'm sure i will be in a better shape yeah i have no doubt and losing against the heavier people sometimes can happen as long as you don't lose in your category but john hutchinson says
SPEAKER_02: This is probably my favorite match on the card other than Devon versus Levan. Fia for the win. Thanks for the great card again, Engin. Thank you, my friend. Thank you for your support. Yeah. She said that you and her meet each other before. And you have one? Actually, I don't remember that we met. I only have seen her pull against Heidi and...
SPEAKER_01: Gladkaya but I saw from our assault that she we were in the same category, but I don't remember that we met that Yeah, you don't even remember how many world titles you have Yeah, it is yeah anyways, but I think that her prime was like
SPEAKER_02: After 2015, like 2017, 18, 19, I think she started to win Europeans and Worlds, Niki Sheva. And yeah, and now she's, I don't know, she said that she's lifting the same ways that she was lifting when it was in her best years. And let's see how it will be. I'm excited.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, me too. Yeah. I have a question. This is left arm world title match. Yes. And right arm world title match, 70 kilo, for sure, you are the one. The one side of the table, there will be you. Who do you think that should be at the other side of the table in the future? Should that be Gladkaya or should that be the Uzbek girl that won 70 kilo?
SPEAKER_02: or anyone else? What do you think about that? Because Nikisheva said that her right arm is now not feeling good and I don't know if she was. Yeah, I heard. Yeah. Actually, I think the winner in 70 kilo would be most fair at the moment. You mean the Uzbek girl?
SPEAKER_02: yes yeah okay yeah this is what i am thinking as well that the uzbek girl versus you i think that deserves the world title match with right arm yeah that's what i think yeah and let's see let's see how it will be and so what are you planning to do you said that you didn't like your shape and you have a little bit more than a little bit more than five weeks
SPEAKER_01: um do you think that this is not but maybe it's not about you but maybe your opponent the girl got uh stronger maybe in better shape maybe yeah probably every girl is getting better that like because not everyone have been in the sport for 30 years so they they are still
SPEAKER_01: uh gaining strength and technique every year so it's not that strange if they're getting better but my i think i i am a little bit over trained i have uh very stiff muscles in my arms and can't uh use them properly so i went to class you know him yeah yeah yeah yeah because of his birthday
SPEAKER_01: Yes. Yeah. That's why I couldn't join you at your, when Nikki Shiva was on. Yeah. That's a good reason. Yeah. And, and then I got some needling and stuff and he said, uh, this is not good. And he said a lot of times, Oh, what, what is this? So, so I'm, I'm, I'm gonna treat myself a little bit better and, uh, keep on focusing and be better.
SPEAKER_02: I understand, yeah. In the past, you and I, when we did the podcast about the other matches, we didn't have good experience. We have great experience. I kind of feel like you didn't remember many of them. I remember. You remember this time? Like you didn't remember Sherkasov, but so... I'm very bad with names of people.
SPEAKER_02: okay okay just let's go short do you did you do any study about this card you did yes and i also have oh okay and also i have studied the names oh okay wow that is professionalism now i will tell to all the other people you know i will just show them this moment that you show those things you know and then i will just say you need to
SPEAKER_02: follow her example you know this is what i was yeah yeah anyway so yeah um so basically you didn't like your shape but in next five minutes weeks you will be resting more because your arms are stiff because of what overtrain maybe yeah and not uh taking care of uh
SPEAKER_02: sore muscles and just keep on. You wouldn't want to come to Istanbul with a shape that you wouldn't like? No, definitely not. Yeah, yeah. So I think you will be very careful from now on. And is Yanis training you? Yeah, I get the programs from him. He gives you the programs? Yeah. Yeah, so you have one of the best
SPEAKER_02: Best coaches in the world. I know. What do you think about Nick Sheva? Are you in the mode like I know her or did you watch any of her matches? I have watched every match I could find on YouTube. What can you tell us?
SPEAKER_01: I can tell you that she have a technique that will give me problem because she don't care if she loses the hand she's very strong in her
SPEAKER_01: Yes, pronator and side pressure. Yes, yes. Every match I've seen, she's just pressing from losing position, straight over and winning against people I have very hard time. So she may be losing here, but she still protects her back pressure, pronator, and then she has side pressure. And she's taller than you, right? Yeah. She's taller than you.
SPEAKER_02: So it will be a little bit more in her advantage, the leverage. As far as I know, left and right, you are outside Buller. Am I correct? Yes, I am. So I would like to go on the hand, but if she doesn't care, that will be a problem. You mean that you may take the hand, but it may not be enough to win? Yeah, if she just grabs...
SPEAKER_01: the fingers or she's just she's like pulling with her thumb very much like she you mean without the strap without strap i think it will be i don't think she can hold your fingers you will be tied to each other but that's what i'm hoping for but i yeah we'll see okay okay and but i i remember you that even you also
SPEAKER_02: can pull this way as well right yeah i've started with that some strange in some strange way now it is not because you prefer but you you just no need to give up right just because you're like this i mean oh i lost my wrist a little bit so let me lose you know you're not gonna do that right yeah and and in in a woman competition it is more common
SPEAKER_02: That we see these kind of things, because compared to men, woman has more of how to say sensitive like risk. So that's why we see woman a lot, you know, like finger to finger like this with men as well. But in the woman category, we don't see a lot of woman that is.
SPEAKER_02: Having complete wrist control. Your last win against Rosa was very impressive. I think she was the second silver medalist in WAP, right? In 90 kilos. Yeah. 90 kilos. And you were 70 kilos, right? 65. 65, yeah. And then you won that match. It was incredible. It just shows how strong you are pound for pound. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Anyway, so I have a student that she's following in your footsteps. Nisa, I don't know. Yeah, yeah, yeah. She's slowly, slowly getting experience, you know, but she's strong and she's smart. I thought you impressed very much at your Turkish national championships. Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: She won all her categories. Yeah, yeah. Four gold medals. Yeah, yeah. She has done this before as well, but I don't remember. Maybe three golds, one silver. Her left is not as good as her... She's 70 kilos. She's 70 kilos, yeah. I think she could make 65 as well, but normally she's playing... I'm planning to...
SPEAKER_02: Nisa is only 19 years old still. In September, she will be 20. While Karolina, I know at least for last 15 years, you know, I remember. Yeah. Yeah, she has been. And she is second place in the world with right arm. Yeah. And gold medalist with left arm. Yeah. Yeah. Are you planning to go to both Europeans and Worlds? Probably not Europeans this year, but Worlds. Worlds. Okay. I understand. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: anyway so let's see let's see how it will be and let's talk about the matches and then let's see what you will tell us i'm not gonna give you i'm not gonna give you a hard time don't don't panic this is what i'm nervous about yeah because of me right yeah yeah yeah these guys are just playing incredible intimidation games the other day devon said i think it was sunday night at fix he said
SPEAKER_02: We don't see Levan posting like, I mean, wrist videos. And he said he did the bench press with the wrist protector. And he said in the past he was in 260, now he did 250. So Devon said that. And today, like maybe two hours ago, maybe not even two hours ago, Levan posted a video. He's doing 260 kilo bench and without the wrist protection. So he just gave the message.
SPEAKER_02: And then look what Devon just shared. So they are trying to, aha, this is Devon. Devon just gave a super chat first time. Not everyone can be a champion. Oh, I remember. I remember. What was the story about this one? You said something about him that he didn't like it. Something like that? Well, this is...
SPEAKER_01: This is why if Devon wins, I share for him and I hope he wins. But if he do that, I also have to win. Otherwise, he will give me problems. And he will... Oh, okay. This was at the Gennady match? Yes. Okay, okay. It was Gennady match. Was it the time that you pulled her? Rosa? No.
SPEAKER_01: Was it when I met Rebecca or maybe I just... No, no, no. You just came here to watch. You were not pulling. Yeah, it could be. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, okay. What did he say? You said something. He was very sad and upset. And it was in the late evening. And I just wanted to cheer him up. And I said, not everyone can be a champion. And I did.
SPEAKER_02: I didn't mean it as a mean thing, but he was not upset. Yeah, but how else can he understand that he lost the match and you are telling him, Devon, not everyone can be a champion. So it means that don't worry about it, you know, you are not that special. Yeah, but he was the champion next time. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It is because of your criticism, right?
SPEAKER_02: It's because of you. Yeah. Anyways, yeah. So, see, Devon never, never in, like, I did like maybe 200 lives. Devon never, ever wrote, as far as I remember, any comment. He didn't make any comment. And he even did a super chat. So it means that he cares about this match. But I'm not sure if he's supporting you.
SPEAKER_02: No, I don't think so. I think he will win and then he hopes that I will lose so he can give again. Okay. Some shit. Yeah, so it will be a payback time. So you must win. Okay. I must win. Yeah, this is for both of you. Tough match, but looks like his challenge is the biggest in the world. Even in the history.
SPEAKER_01: The match that he's facing now is just like, I mean... I'm very impressed. Impressed at what? That he's so strong now and that he's taking all these matches and that he does great. And even that he can show that he can be better and better.
SPEAKER_02: hmm yeah yeah that's for sure for sure devon is getting better and better my honest opinion i don't think levan will be better than before but it's possible that he will be as good as before uh but my honest opinion devon is much stronger than before will it be enough not yes i don't know what's the weight difference between them now uh on only five kilo oh yeah
SPEAKER_02: Levan lost to down to 127 kilo. I'm joking. Joking, joking. Levan is probably 180 kilo and Devon is probably 120 to 23. So there is at least, at least, I believe, 50 to 60 kilo between them. 55, 60 kilo. My opinion. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, but listen, when you are pulling super heavyweight category, no excuse. When you say that
SPEAKER_02: I am the man in the world. There is nobody on this earth can beat me. You cannot complain. And Devon is not complaining. But a lot of people complain. I don't know why. They say, oh, Devon is too heavy. Devon is too heavy. That's why he's in the super heavyweight category, you know? Yeah. Yeah. But there are some other sports that they don't have, like, unlimited category, like wrestling, Olympic wrestling, I think 130 kilos or something, you know? You cannot be more than that, you know? Then they don't allow you to compete. I don't understand.
SPEAKER_02: Why? But let's see. Anyways, let's go. By the way, I see you doing a lot of, not a lot, but I saw that you're doing, you know, walk on the pull-up bar. I saw. And you were going like tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, so fast, you know? Yeah. And have you ever tried just to stay up there with one arm? Just pull with two hands and let the hand result?
SPEAKER_01: uh i can hold it uh not how long three seconds some seconds how many i don't know how many seconds but i can hold a while but not like not like
SPEAKER_02: not like one minute or so like no no like is it more than 10 seconds you can hold yeah probably a little bit more i will try and then i send you just try and then make a video maybe just pull yourself up wait and then give a message to nikisha okay yeah and then send me i will share because this is very very impressive a woman to uh say that uh with one arm
SPEAKER_02: My goal is to pull myself up, but that probably will not be. That would be incredible. That would be incredible if you do that. I don't remember I have seen any woman doing that. I don't remember. Maybe there is, but I don't remember. Probably some. I mean, I will tell you something. I don't even, I mean, it's just my personal thing. I cannot really say that what I say should be the rule or something, but I don't even accept when people are like throw themselves. My is like,
SPEAKER_02: Yeah. This, you know, even with the two hands, it's just arms. Like when people holding and throwing themselves up like this, you know, it's just, if any of my students would do that, I would just say, stop, you know. But that's the same with weights. I see what you mean. And I think it's the same with weights sometimes in videos. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Holding the bar and just going with the chest. Yeah, yeah. It goes like this.
SPEAKER_01: yeah and that yeah you go forward and then you throw yourself yeah have you ever seen me doing that bicycle no i i don't think i've seen i do like this yes yeah but i mean of course maybe dating is better maybe they're right i don't know when i started to train with my father he always said that never to cheat on the yeah with the weight you do now yeah
SPEAKER_02: I told you against a wall and then I had to do the strict curls and that's less less you cheat more control you have at the table my opinion like the quality is better at the table when you when you cheat more you know and at the table you are also everything is going somewhere else you know anyways so let's go let's go
SPEAKER_02: I will make you regret coming here. Huh? I will make you regret coming here. No. No, I'm joking. Okay. Give me an easy one first. I will start from the list. Okay, you want the first easy one. Okay. I mean, the easy one should be probably Devon versus Lewand, but I'm not going to start from there. Okay. Okay, this one is good.
SPEAKER_01: FIA RISE TECH versus Ekaterina Nikisheva. Oh, that's a great matchup. Okay, a bit objective wise, tell me your opinion. Yeah, it will be interesting. I don't know if FIA can handle Ekaterina's technique, but hopefully she has studied and will train.
SPEAKER_02: a lot against it so close huh very close match i think it's a close match yeah are you do you think the fear is gonna show her um forefathers spirits the viking spirits hopefully that will be yeah listen you uh girls from sweden whenever it is not competition time
SPEAKER_02: Um, you are not like in a super mood, you know, like I'm gonna, I'm gonna, but when the competition is happening, you ladies over there at the table is, you know, warriors, you know? Yeah. And like for many years, uh, woman from Sweden were the only real team competition for Russian Russians, you know? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So who is winning?
SPEAKER_01: I think Fia will win. Yeah, you know that you need to win four times because it's a title match. Yeah, but that's even better. Then she can lose. So you believe in your endurance more? No, not really. But when it's for competition, I got some horns like this. Oh, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: So this is what I meant when I said viking, you know. Yeah, that's the viking horns. Yeah. Let's see. Okay. Sweden Armwrestling Television. Christine Whitman. Yeah. Always fun to spar against fear cause the energy she's bringing is always extra fun. Go Sweden. Yeah. Okay.
SPEAKER_02: I'm not going to start with the Levan and Devon, but let's see. Too easy for me. Okay. Mindaugus Tarasaitis versus Artur Makarov. Yeah. Great match also. Yep. And Mindaugus seems very confident that he will win this. And then he wants to meet you. Oh, you are watching some of the podcast. Yeah, that's good. Oh yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I think you saw the clip that I posted on Facebook or something. Yeah, I saw that. No, but that would be... Can I ask if the opponent of Mindaugus... You don't know him? I know Tarasaitis. Tarasaitis is Mindaugus. No, it's Artur Makarov.
SPEAKER_02: You don't know Artur McCarroll? Yes, I know. I know. I know his face. I know the person, but I don't know his name. But is he inside puller? I thought you already studied. No, I didn't study him like that. Oh, okay. Okay. He can go inside and he can go just back pressure and hit the side way that way. Okay.
SPEAKER_02: You don't remember him? He's just like, his forearms and hands are almost like, you know, his hands. Yes. And I saw the match you did also with him. Yeah, yeah. The match that I got injured, yeah. Yeah. But I think you won the hand. I won first two rounds. And the second round, my bicep was torn. And then I tried one more time, but
SPEAKER_02: third round I couldn't and then I finished and he won that way. Yeah, I saw. While I was winning, yeah. No, but then I think Minde will win this match. Okay. Minde August and him, they pulled like maybe five, six times before. And who won? Artur, yeah. Except one time Artur won. You know, when you were in Antalya 2018 World, right? When Malin won.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, so in that year also Artur did final with Mindaugus. And Artur was first, Mindaugus was second. But Mindaugus won one match, yeah. Okay, which matches did you study? I studied the names actually. Okay, but you didn't really study and look who they are. How long have you been pulling? I've been pulling for over 30 years. 30 years, yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And majority of these guys have pulled with you yet, Europeans as well. Yes, I know. And now I will show you everyone I know. I know Michael Todd and Frank. Okay, let's go there. Yes, that match also will be very interesting. I haven't seen Frank pull before he was at East vs West last time.
SPEAKER_02: He was Matt Mask, he pulled against Matt Mask, yeah. Yeah, and he didn't pull for a long time that I have seen. No, no, before that he pulled Europeans. Ah. But you didn't come to Europeans. I didn't go, no, I didn't. Yeah, he gave a very good match to Reno Masic. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, he did. Mm-hmm. What do you think about that match? Who do you think will win? I'm an organizer.
SPEAKER_02: can't you have an opinion i can but i cannot share ah and then people will say oh look at their his organizer he wants this guy to win and things like that okay let me make a poll who wins let's see if people will be thinking that you will win or nikisha win
SPEAKER_02: Let's see. I started to pull. Okay, so you tell me. You tell me who's winning. That's why you are here. No, Frank will win. Oh, Frank will win? Yeah. Wow. Did you know that they pulled about 16 years ago, maybe 15 and a half years ago in Italy?
SPEAKER_02: And Michael won 3-2. I think he was losing 2-0 and now come back and beat him. Was it a supermatch? Supermatch, yeah. 3-2, yeah. My predictions might not be so good. No, no, no, no. Just because somebody beat somebody 15 years ago doesn't mean he's going to beat them again. But what I'm just saying, they have pulled before. Frank looks very strong now. I think he's the strongest he has been. I agree with that. I agree with that. I think Frank is at his best.
SPEAKER_02: but anyone who underestimates Michael big mistake yes I think you don't want him to get in the Kings move and get stuck there I mean I think like our rule allows this but yeah not this yeah yeah this this here is like this is okay parallel is okay like that yeah this is not this is okay because
SPEAKER_02: This is not like you see the humerus here parallel is okay. But when it is down angle like this, then it is not allowed, you know, uh, on the natural and losing position and winning position. It's okay. You know, some people don't understand the difference, but, um, so you are saying that you are saying that Frank is going to win. Okay. Let's go to another one. You tell me you have the, you have the.
SPEAKER_01: paper, you know what I'm saying. And then we take, we already talked about Mindaugus. How about Kurdecha versus Georgi Tsvetkov? Yeah, Kurdecha, there, you have those there, for those of you that doesn't know their names. Yeah, two monsters, yeah. Yes. Both of them over 160 kilos.
SPEAKER_01: This is hard to predict, don't you think? Is it because you don't know them? If you don't know Alex Kurdecha and Georgi Turetko, I don't think I will ever invite you again. I'm joking. I know. I know. I know them. I know Alex Kurdecha after pulling Tobias Borong, but that was a couple of years ago. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I think they have a super match with right arm as well. Maybe they did. Yeah, they did right arm, yeah. I think Alex won, yeah. But he has been better since then. And bigger. Yeah. Probably. And Georgi is super strong. Which style Georgi does? Which style Georgi does?
SPEAKER_01: he go just straight. No, Georgi is a pure top roller. Okay, but it can be... No, he's not that good about sides. He's pure pronation. Okay, but you can't really imagine these big guys would go on a top roll like that. But they are going, that's what they do. And Kordache also go top roll. Yeah, they both go outside, especially
SPEAKER_02: I was thinking that even with left arm, he would be only top load. But in the last match against Morozov, he did shoulder pressure. He did the hook. He did everything. It was surprising. But right arm, I'm not sure if his right is as strong as his left. I don't think with right arm, he's that good with the shoulder pressure or hook. He is good probably, but I don't think he's as good as his left. Yeah. Okay. Okay.
SPEAKER_02: People say that you are winning so far. How many votes? How many votes? 90 votes. And people say FIA is going to win. 78%. Oh, thank you, guys. Yeah. Anyway, so Arsene Lele is coming. Do you know his opponent, Brandon Ancestor?
SPEAKER_01: Yes. You know? No. No. But you know Arsene? Yes. I will not. Okay. Say once again who he will meet. Okay. Just let me tell you. Yes, I know. Okay. Now I know. You know? It stops in the middle.
SPEAKER_02: yeah yeah yeah but i'm not asking if you know who they are but do you know that how brandon pulls what he does no no okay let me ask you alican murado do you know him uh no alican murado just recently beat prudnik evgeny prudnik and yeah with
SPEAKER_02: But you know Evgeny Prudnik, come on, not that much. Ali Can is the 105 kilo world champion at East vs West. He's going to pull against Ermes Gasparini. Ermes is a super heavyweight. Ali Can is only 105 kilo. But Ali Can is also very, very strong. That would be a great match then. Yes, yes, yes, yes. So they have never pulled? No, they never pulled because I don't think they have ever been in the same category.
SPEAKER_02: When Ermes was competing, Ali Can was a junior. He was like a 70-kilo guy. And then when Ermes finally decided to compete professionally, then Ali Can went up to 80 kilos and then go right now. Last two years, he won the... You know, when you won the WAF World in Antalya last time, 2022?
SPEAKER_02: Ali Can won the super heavyweight category while he was like 94 kilo, 95 kilo. Interesting. Yeah, yeah. His left arm is very, very good. Are they pulling left now? What's that? Are they pulling left arm? Yeah, left arm. Yeah. If right arm, right arm, Ermes would be too much. Okay. Yeah. Ermes would be too much. But left arm. But still, Ali Can.
SPEAKER_02: Right arm is also very good. At the last VARF, he was the one who sent Reno Masic to B-side. He beat him in a fresh match, yeah. Then later, he also had a very tough match with Sandris. And then he went to B-side and lost to Reno. So that's how he got eliminated, yeah. Yep. Anyway, so maybe we go. We go. I thought...
SPEAKER_02: Do you know Irakli Zirakashvili? Yes. Irakli Zirakashvili is pulling against Sasho. Sasho, you know, right? Andreev Sasho. I know, but he was not supposed to pull him first. Yes, but see, you know that one. Yes, you're right. You're right. Yeah. So what happened is that Tata Cings was going to pull Ongar Bey in June 1st, on June 1st in Dubai, and Tata Cings had to join a funeral memorial
SPEAKER_02: Next day. So they couldn't find flights to make him catch the funeral. So what happened that Ongarbev needed a great opponent. And we thought that Petro was the opponent because Irakli's current weight category is 95.
SPEAKER_02: And he wanted to pull Sasho anyways for the world title. Irakli beat Rustam Babayev and Pauline. And now he's going to do the title match against Sasho. Yeah. Yeah. You know this pull. Irakli top rolls. Sasho goes inside. Yeah. Now I know. Yeah. So what do you think about this match? Irakli have looked very strong.
SPEAKER_01: uh this last uh competitions yeah he did yeah and i think he's very confident and also he took the match and with the confidence uh and i think iraqli will win um that's i understand yeah and did you know that they pulled like three years ago they pulled uh
SPEAKER_02: uh and then he lost yeah and then um sasha won 4-1 but since then since then yeah it has been exactly three years and then we will see it was march 2021 first round iraqi won and then next four rounds sasha won yeah yeah yeah okay yeah somebody's asking leo is asking engine when will be
SPEAKER_02: Levan and Devon podcast. In next 10 days, you can expect it. In next 10 days, yeah. You can expect, yeah. Because they are just talking and sending message to each other. Let them, you know, sit down. Let them do that. What's that? Let them do that. Let them play a little bit before. Yeah, yeah, you're right. Okay, so do you know Ibragim Sagov? Most likely no. No.
SPEAKER_02: No, that's what I was guessing. Yeah. Okay. Let's talk about, let's talk about, let's talk about, um, what's that? Those I don't know. Okay. Let's talk about Devon Larratt versus Levan Saginacile. Oh.
SPEAKER_01: finally yeah yeah uh oh my god uh we have seen this match before yeah do you believe do you believe that devon is the same devon or since then he progressed no i think definitely he have progressed before last time and
SPEAKER_01: Levan have been injured and have had focus on other things after that, I think. Also, he have had time to heal and that can be good. I also think Devon have thought about this match since he lost last time and in some seconds,
SPEAKER_01: on that match they had before Devon felt something that he might find a way or something he felt something that okay this is round one round one round one when he stopped you know when Devon was winning that close and his wrist was a little bit moving and yeah right here like for one two seconds it seemed like it stopped yeah yeah and and then he's he he felt like okay i can't take this but
SPEAKER_01: uh it didn't he couldn't make it that time but i think he can win yeah i think he can yeah but how big how big you see the chances i i want levan devon to win
SPEAKER_02: uh but i think it will be very tough and but there is possibilities yes this is exactly what i'm thinking like leon on the paper is the favorite the level one is the strongest super heavyweight i have ever seen i mean the guy is just incredible yeah but i with my own eyes like
SPEAKER_02: I'm witnessing how Devon is progressing since that match. But anyone who says that Devon did not progress and that the progression is some because of more experience with the Ekaterina athletes. Two, his confidence built. And the three, because of the stem cells, you know, the guy is now more, I mean, he can do many of the movements and get stronger there. Um,
SPEAKER_02: you know, compared to the before, you know, like when you are healthy, you can do many things. You have all the knowledge here, but your arm doesn't want to do it because you are hurt. Your arm has to do this, your arm has to do this. So when your arm is healed up and then when you start to do this, this, this, you know, it is really adding a lot, even to your outside game, because you are building something here.
SPEAKER_02: And then even to your outside, to your arms, not to be so much stretched that way. So I'm 100% sure Devon is much better. At least minimum 10% better than last time. Will it be enough? I don't know about that one, yeah. We'll see. Yeah. But you are saying that you want Devon to win? Yes. Do you agree that Levan is the strongest you have ever seen?
SPEAKER_02: Do you think that there has been anyone that was better than him, this guy? There was this very, very big guy in USA, Cleve Dean or something. Oh, Cleve Dean, yeah, yeah. But did you know that, for example, Cleve, John personally told me that he never lost even one round to him.
SPEAKER_02: even one match to him you know yeah i think maybe he was just big and no he was super strong he was super strong but not sure if he was the the best ever in the history he was one of them one of them for sure but then also if if you put that young against levan not me you can but not me you're talking about 95 i know i know i know i know like
SPEAKER_02: I mean, he was very strong with this guy. It's something else, you know? I don't know. Like, if you ask me, pound for pound, John, no doubt, is the best ever. If you just say 2006 John compared to Levan today, I don't see him beating Levan. If you say 2006 John versus Deveno today, if tournament format, then I would just say
SPEAKER_02: Possibly John, if it is super match format, that he needs to beat him three, four times. I don't see anyone who is at the same weight of Devon or lighter beating Devon in a super match format. I don't think so. Yeah. I don't know. Interesting. Yeah, it will be great. Yeah, it will be great. We will have a great time. Yeah. Yeah. It will be incredible. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: And, and so what's happening is that you, um, you will pull here and then you will compete the wars as the world level events. Yeah. Do you think that you may be, you may be ready for the, uh, 70 kilo world title right arm match in July or something, early July, like one and a half month before the WAF maybe.
SPEAKER_02: against the Uzbek world champion. I have a question. Are you the best 70 kilo in the world? Do you believe that anyone, especially with right arm I'm asking, left arm we will find out soon. With right arm, do you believe that you are the best in the world? No. Okay, who is that? There is a lot of girls that could be in 70 kilo that I...
SPEAKER_01: think could be better. You mean that there is a possibility? Yeah. But it may be you as well, right? Yeah, because it's not a big difference between us. So the performance on that day is important. Yes, very much.
SPEAKER_01: Okay. And you see, I can lose to anyone. You can what? I can lose to anyone. If I'm not like smart or in focus or just have a bad day, then I can lose to... Yeah. But I will tell you something. If right now any 70 kilo in the world, we would just set you.
SPEAKER_02: against at that stage you will not be like this you will be like crazy you know just to win that match yeah like you know yeah because i know you what you talk right now what i see on the stage are not the same person you know for sure you know yeah when it is your match you don't see anything else you are there you even challenge and beat this silver medalist of 90 kilo walls
SPEAKER_02: 90-kilo world silver medalist is 20, 25 kilos heavier than you, and you have beaten her. So I don't think if I ask you, Fia, do you think that if you would compete with your weight right now to do 90 kilos, you think you would be finalist against Gabriela? You would say, no, no, they are too heavy for me, too strong for me. But that is not happening, you know, when you're new competing.
SPEAKER_02: No, exactly. If there is a competition, I'm there to win and I'm usually ready to do my best. So you are not really thinking that anybody is better than you. You say it's a possibility, but if I set you against that person, I don't think that you will come there just believing that, oh, I will lose this match. No, if I am set
SPEAKER_02: against someone i i have to believe that i will not lose yeah but you are gonna accept the match if you believe right absolutely yes yeah so this is what i am saying so see you made my point you're gonna accept the match only when you believe right yeah so it means that you believe because i don't think there is any match that you will reject would you reject in a match no no okay yeah okay yeah i remember when i set you against rebecca
SPEAKER_02: And she was 65 kilo world champion and you were 70. Yeah. And then on that day, you both were 70 kilo because it wasn't WAF anymore. Yeah. Yeah. And you showed a very dominant performance on that night. I didn't know who was going to win. I never expected any dominant performance, but you just, like, it was... She's also great, Polo. She's very strong, Polo.
SPEAKER_01: I think she gave you some hard time at the last swap as well. Yeah, she did, definitely. You guys did the final together? Right now? No, we had the semi-final, both in left and right. Oh, okay. I think one match, I think you also had a final with her. Who was the second place with right now? I think it was her. No, second place is Pela. What's her name?
SPEAKER_02: from Georgi, I think. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I remember. Bella Plieva. Yeah, Bella Plieva, yeah. I think she was part of, not I think, she was part of the first East versus West. Ah, yeah. Yeah, she pulled against Etra. Ah. Yeah. Okay. And, yeah, okay. So you are saying that, yeah, she was third, yeah. But I think, I think
SPEAKER_02: I think your match with Rebecca was tougher. I think you had control, slow, slow, slow. I remember correct, right? Yes, exactly. Yes, because that was a very interesting match. I remember, yeah. Yeah. Anyway, so is there any message or anything you want to say to your opponent or to your fans, community? No.
SPEAKER_01: no what i i just want them to watch the show to come there or watch at the pay-per-view at the course board yes yes that is my message yeah another question what do you think about east versus west as a level i love this event
SPEAKER_01: It's incredible and it definitely has made armwrestling big in the world. I meet people anywhere at work or I go to
SPEAKER_01: They know about the social stress? Yeah, they know people at the competition and they talk about next event. Wow, that is a real reward for all of us. Yeah, you know, when I started and like it was not long ago, like 10 years ago or something, people still said, arm wrestling, can you compete in arm wrestling? Is that a sport? And now it's like, oh, you know, Devon and you know Devon and you know this and they...
SPEAKER_02: say people i don't know but yeah yeah yeah yeah i know but we don't get along this is how you answer it yeah yeah anyway so it is this is my my uh also pleasure you know we all together meet you know every every three months we do something great also king of the table as well and then we all together have fun we we enjoy and we make our dreams and we also promote
SPEAKER_02: the support that we love. And I'm happy. I'm happy because this is what we deserve. I mean, we deserve much more than this one. But this is right now as much as we can do it. But we will do much better. But this grows so fast also. I did not think that this would be this big in this... It's not a long time you started this. Yeah, yeah. But it has been two years.
SPEAKER_02: But it, to me, like I'm doing like, like five, six years already because like too much work. And did you know that Gennady Kvigvinia when he beat Devon, a Georgi, a businessman gave him a BMW. What? Yeah. And, and I think as far as I remember, I think in Kazakhstan, they gave it to Ungarbev apartment. Ah, yeah. We win in the world title. Yeah. I mean.
SPEAKER_02: We need to make this bigger and bigger and bigger that all of you would be treated as national heroes, superstars in your country. You all deserve it. There are many other sports people enjoy. I think we reached our goal when some Swedes will get something from our government. Yeah, I hope so. Then we are on the top of the highest. Yeah, listen.
SPEAKER_02: all the arm masters deserve, but athletes from Sweden for sure deserve, for sure. Especially being the male arm masters from Sweden also very strong, but the female arm masters are just going head to head with the Kazakhs, with the Russians, just like in the history, we didn't have that kind of, there has always been individuals
SPEAKER_02: but not as the whole team that from the West was competitive with the other countries. And for sure, female armistice from Sweden, they have done this, yeah. It's incredible, yeah. Anyways, once again, thank you very much, Fia. And I hope you don't get upset that sometimes I a little bit tease you, but you don't know that. It's okay, I can take it. You better take it. If you come here unprepared, every time you come here, you will take it.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, I will prepare more next time. Next time I know you want to talk about techniques. Many things, many things. I will ask you, just better not, you know, Georgi Tsvetkov goes several, last three matches was this, this, this, this, you know. But then I need a week in advance before I know. Do you know what you need?
SPEAKER_02: just put the ear thing, you know, and then put... And let someone talk to me. No, someone, yeah, like Christian Wigmund, you know, just tell him. And then he tells you, whenever I ask questions, he's like, this is the guy, just repeat what I say, you know. Yeah, and then everything will be... Yeah, anyways. Thank you very much once again for being our guest here and also for the competition. You are for sure one of the absolute legends of the female armwrestling.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know, maybe you get upset whenever I say male and female, but yeah, you don't, right? Yeah. So some people, you are? I am. Yeah, you are teasing me now. You're joking now. Anyway, so. Do you have tests for that? If we are female or males when we compete? I mean. No. I think if it was necessary, one would do it, you know.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah. Anyway, so no, what I'm just saying is some people like, why don't you call me arm wrestling legends? Why you call me female arm wrestling legends? You know, maybe you would think that way. Yeah. Anyway, so no, no disrespect is meant. And again, you are one of the legends for sure. And we are honored to have you here. And I wish you do. I wish you good luck. Same as I also wish Ekaterina the good luck and see you in five weeks.
SPEAKER_02: Thank you. Yes, I'm looking forward to it. Yeah, thank you. We have been here for one hour. Guys, at 9.30, Artur Makarov will be my guest and Ivan Matushenko will be translating. If you are interested, I will be here. You all take care. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Bye-bye.
