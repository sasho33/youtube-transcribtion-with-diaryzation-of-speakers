Host: Yeah, he was just waiting. Hello, everyone. Hello, hello, hello. Great to see you all in the chat room. And today we are with Ivan Matyshenko, the legendary hook puller. And so, Ivan, I was asking Ivan, I thought that I started the podcast, but in fact, I didn't. So I was asking him,
Ivan Matyushenko: if he if you follow the georgia trip and what he thinks about it yeah go ahead go ahead nothing changed in my mind i think yes i think that uh devon has chances but uh leon is the favorite that one is the favorite i would still bet on leon but now i think it it may be close uh he has chances but when you say that now it is close close
Host: it was the same close that two weeks ago you were saying or now you think even maybe a little bit even closer no just just the same same okay okay okay so okay you are saying closer than the last time yeah i understand yeah yeah yeah and and did you like did you see his wrist curl and other things
Ivan Matyushenko: Sorry. You didn't see his wrist curl? No. How much is that? I saw his wrist curl long ago when he did 100 kg. Yeah, this time he did 80 kg. One rep 80 kg he did. So this time his strength is lower than it used to be. Maybe in the wrist.
Host: yeah okay what happened is that this i will explain to you so you you since you didn't see everything you can have your own conclusion i went there with the belt here they did maybe 10 sets of the uh brachioradialis training you know with the belt and after that they said they tried i think each of them tried with directly three sets of that levan's lift and then they went to the cable
Host: with the cable they did this and then they went to the chin-up bar and they did four or five sets of the chin-ups but even when you do chin-ups it is hitting your wrist you know like you understand if you try to hold like this it is 180 kilo the guys yeah so what happened is that that day he also as i said oh after the chin-up he also have that the handle with the handle he did the wrist but from the cable
Host: cable receded okay and then exactly two days later we went to a different place uh his friend lasha's place a small uh training area so what he did was he did bicep he went up to 110 kilo dumbbell on the on the squat bench he he did like most likely like this but even if it is dumbbell curve you know 110 kilo put some pressure here
Host: so after he finished all his dumbbell risker and remember two days ago he did the wrist and also did the chin ups so he tried to start the dumbbell risker so he he did 80 kilo he did 80 kilo one rep so
Host: Outside, everything looked like this. And yesterday, Devon was just putting so much pressure, like, psychological pressure. He's like, you are not as you used to be. You will lose badly, you know. I will crush you because I saw how much risk you were doing before, how much now, you know. And Devon said that, how do you know that I show everything? You know, he answered him that way. But my opinion on that day,
Host: it was best that Levan could do it. I asked him, are you going to do 90? He said, no, it's enough because 80 kilos didn't seem so comfortable either, one rep only. But how much do you think that the training from two days ago and that Scott curve would affect? Maybe 10%, 15%. Also, I saw him pull in Iraq. It was after everything.
Host: it was it was after years after everything yeah yeah yes maybe uh 10 15 yes then 80 kilo can be 88 kilo if it is 15 80 kilo can be 92 kilo so yeah yeah and do you remember how many reps he did with 100 kilo last time you saw him some years ago or some a year ago no maybe no i do not remember yes
Ivan Matyushenko: I remember that the range was not perfect. The range was not perfect. And it depends much on the range. If he did the same range now. Okay. Straight and here. Straight and here. How is your wrist curve? Your wrist curve goes like this? Yes. Even more. Like this, yes. Like this. Okay. Okay. I never do this. I always make it straight and in. Straight, like beginning position and in.
Host: Sometimes they put you in this position from the start, the reference, sometimes. So I prefer to do from a bit losing position. But I like to build, you know, something here. If I build it here, here I don't think I will be the same strong. So I try to, I don't know, my opinion, I don't remember myself starting like this, but maybe like this I remember what.
Ivan Matyushenko: Yeah, usually it's okay like this. And perhaps you do not use your wrist so much, yes? Yes, you use it more in a static way, I think.
Host: yeah i do that but i also but remember you said the static way you needed this so that that is what i try to build with the dumbbell right here so it's like a wall you know i i hit but sometimes i i also do this one too but little range little range perhaps yeah it depends you know it depends you know if the opponent is a hook puller if he is coming in you then you
Host: you have to do the full cup, you know, because if you stay like this, and then, I mean, you need to follow the pronator with here, you know. Always, I mean, my belief is that an armwrestler, in an ideal way, of course, the things are not always perfect, but an armwrestler should always follow the pronator. Follow the pronator spinate, follow the pronator side, follow the pronator. Even when some people
Host: Taplos like this, I mean, it is just nonsense to me. You need to control here and Taplos. Never leave here. Always control the opponent's pronators, you know. That's my opinion, you know. That is my way of... You do the same thing. I mean, you are the guy that, you know, is just all about following the pronator, correct? I'm not sure.
Host: You always control here, you know. You follow your opponent's pronator. That's your main goal. When I say follow the pronator, I mean never leave your pronator of your opponent. You always need to follow there. Yeah, you are, I mean, 100%.
Host: pronator domination from your side. Your whole technique is based on controlling opponent's pronator with your wrist and supination. I mean, you make them like this, you know. Yes, now I try to add some pronation myself.
Host: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I see. But even when you add pronation, you still control. Yes, I also use this. Yeah, yeah. You never, you never, I don't know, I don't think you go like this. You still just try to control. I saw you did against Davit Arabuli when he tried to go outside. I think one round you went outside, right? Hmm.
Host: Or side. Maybe side, yeah. Yeah, side. But just you never, even some people, do you know how they go? They overpronate, they go like this while you control here and then go. You never leave here. Yes. Yeah. Did you see the match that I said? Kamil? Kamil and Tobias. You watched Tobias' match with Wagner?
Host: How do you see this match? I think it may be an even match. All about the start?
Ivan Matyushenko: difficult to say uh camille is strong with his left hand even in defensive position but i think um well it's difficult to to predict who will win uh i would um i think uh camille is a little favorite still he's a little favorite yes but
Ivan Matyushenko: Tobias started to use side pressure more. That may be a problem for Kamil, but Kamil is also good. The thing is that Tobias has very strong grip, very strong hand. So the danger for the flop pressers, they don't like
Host: the pronator to be controlled that way. If it is like this, press. Once it turns like this, it is not that easy to press like this. So when I saw, I was expecting Wagner versus Tobias match, I was expecting something like this and this. But the guy just holding, he just went straight sideways, you know. So that, the old Tobias,
Host: would be more comfortable Kamil than new Tobias is to me but just remember that Kamil is much more experienced about what he is doing than what Tobias started to do which is a new thing but it looks like he adapted good against Wagner yeah so you are saying that Kamil is slightly favored I think that Kamil may have
Host: better side pressure. He may have better side pressure. Is calmness side pressure or is more like forward pressure? Forward side pressure both of them. He may have better than Tobias. Do you think that people who push more forward
Host: is more dangerous kamil or someone like tobias that goes straight side because when you go straight side there is still room for this or the other you know or the other guy but whenever you go a little bit with supination then you block in the pronator more um i think i think you went you didn't go side but did you go exactly side or you you added a little bit pressure with the
Ivan Matyushenko: downside of your hand when you pull with Kamil? Yes, I added that so that not to have straps, just to control his, not to go to straps, yes. So I held him lower, yes, and I controlled this. Yes, yes. So, but Tobias, do you think he pulled the same way that you did when he pulled against Wagner, or he was his more side, not
Ivan Matyushenko: this but more yes i think i think he was uh uh over he was higher than me i hired right yeah yeah yeah so he didn't i think uh they will go to straps for sure okay okay they will go to the strips yes and uh there it will matter who will have more center power i think and i'm not sure that tobias has a good center power
Ivan Matyushenko: What did you think about his center power against Wagner? I think that... The different level? Yes, I think Camille is better in this move. In his wrist, yes. Wagner was good, but he was doing that move with his wrist.
Host: He was not a flop wrist. He didn't use a flop wrist, I think, mostly. Who? Oh, Wagner? Yes, he used to go with a wrist. Most times. Yeah, but he still, like, for example, when he pulled Dzeranov, he used his wrist. They were in hook, if you remember. Yes. Is it because Dzeranov also went inside?
Ivan Matyushenko: I mean that Camille's flop press is more dangerous for Tobias than Wagner's press. Because it is not flop press. It goes with wrist. And when Tobias took his wrist, he was not able to use his press. Do you think Tobias took his wrist or Tobias just went sideways like this? He went sideways taking his wrist.
Host: Okay, so he rolled out like this? Yes. To me it was more like straight side. I don't know, maybe because it was too fast and I didn't watch again. I need to see it again. So this is going to be a good match. I think they are almost...
Host: Same weight. I think they both are around 130 kilos or something. And yeah, he will be a good one. You saw that, right? Arsene couldn't make it. I didn't ask him why he cannot. But that's Petro. I wanted to see him. Yeah, yeah. Maybe next time. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I hope so. I hope so. I told him he had to go to another city.
Host: for work for work and there he wouldn't be able to train as he is trained at home and he said that he does
Host: Let's see, I replaced him with Stoyan Golemanov. People don't know about Stoyan Golemanov, but in my book, he is one of the best uppers that I have ever seen. Maybe not super side pressure, but about this ability
Ivan Matyushenko: What do you think about Stoyan Golemanov? I saw him many times at World, Europeans. He's a good top player, yes. Maybe not the strongest one in his class. But he usually was in top three. I don't know if he ever won Worlds, but maybe he even has won World Championships. But I don't remember when.
Host: He was, I remember in 2015, he beat Ermes and then he lost to Dieter Spanagel. And then he pulled back to Ermes and Ermes this time beat him. And then Ermes lost to Spanagel, but Spanagel tested positive. So Ermes won the gold.
Host: Yeah, it was, yeah. It was long ago. Ermes was smooth. Yeah, very young. Yeah, but just think about it. A year after that, he beat Rustam Babayev. Ermes? Yeah, it was 2016. And around that time, also, he had the final with Prudnik. I remember, was it 2014 or 13 or what was it? I don't know.
Host: You know, Ermes was already world champion for the youth category. He's genetically gifted, yeah. One time you told me that you would like to pull against him because of your hook inability, yeah. And I think someone deleted my message under his... Oh, you wrote under his post? You wrote that you want to pull against him? Yes, and someone deleted it.
Host: and said, it's not time for me this time. Okay, if it is his page, then only he can delete. No, it was Engin Terzi's. Oh, is it mine? Oh, I don't know how... No, I would never... Why would I delete such thing, you know? It was okay, it was okay. But maybe... Do you think that you wrote as a reply to someone?
Ivan Matyushenko: I think it was Ermes who wrote to Devon to fight him for the price of $10,000. I don't remember such a comment. Yes, yes.
Ivan Matyushenko: maybe it was three years ago or four years ago no no no no no sorry so he told uh he uh wrote down to pull for 10 or 20 000 dollars
Ivan Matyushenko: And I wrote that it would be easy money for me. Or something like that, yes. Frozen.
Host: How is it now? Is it now you see me? No, not yet. Yes. Yeah. Okay. Okay. That's good. That's good. I don't know what's wrong with the internet, but yeah. Anyway, so people are asking, you know, how is, how is Ivan's preparation? Well, as usual, I'm not satisfied with everything. I have some, I have some elbow problems, but I know that Artyom also has
Ivan Matyushenko: so so it's okay if you're arm wrestling usually you have something yeah but especially inside like this yes there's a problem for me because i know that i need uh maybe five ten percent more to beat artyom so i need i need to train i need to to get better so now i'm trying to heal it and it becomes better i think now
Ivan Matyushenko: Yeah. Where are you right now? I mean, in your form? Difficult to say. Difficult to say. In many exercises, it is my best form, maybe, or close to best in many, but not hook imitation, unfortunately.
Ivan Matyushenko: and in cook imitation i need to to get better but i cannot push limits now now i work with low weights so i plan to work with them for uh two or three more weeks and after that i will try to to add some intensity do you believe that uh ivan
Host: like if if you are new you know then you need to push limits to experience something higher but if you already been there if you have already been there at this level and at the training maybe you don't do the maximum but you just go 90 percent just to protect your elbow and
Host: But anytime you want, you can do it. You have the power. Just because you train with 90%, I don't believe that you cannot do the 100. But you can save that for the competition. You know what I mean? Yes, but the problem is I have to... I need to get my 110%. Oh, okay. So that's the problem.
Ivan Matyushenko: Yes, I can bring my good form to Morozov, but I need to get better. And I'm not sure that I can get better than I used to be if it aches much. But now it seems to be a little better. So I'm a little more optimistic.
Host: But are you in a psychology, like, I need to push 110, I need to push, or you are very careful by knowing that if you hurt yourself, you will not be even 100%, forget about 110%. Like, are you in a panic, or you are in control? No, I'm too experienced for that. Yeah, but this is a different level. Like, on the table, there is war, people are waiting.
Ivan Matyushenko: Yes, but psychologically, as you said, I would like to have my 90% with more ease, to be satisfied that there is about 110%. We'll see. Yeah, I believe it that way. Just because you are not doing something,
Host: doesn't mean that like for example if your max is 50 kilo one rep and normally just say 45 kilo three rep and then 40 kilo just say five reps just example you know if you are able to do 45 kilo just say six reps you know that your one rep max is about 50 kilo now so but just you don't need to see now because you may get hurt because
Host: one training you do that and then next one month you are out of service but in the competition you don't care if you are one month out of
Host: service you understand so you save everything for that moment you just don't push it other other exercises that it's not hurting you can do 110 but the one that is hurting it doesn't have to be pushed 110 you know that a little bit less weight with more reps more reps more reps it means that right now your capacity is somewhere higher than your max but you are just no need to see you are confident enough i know i can do it but i save it for the competition you know
Host: Yes. Yeah. Let's see. Let's see. Yeah. I hope it's going to be a good match. And this is, you said that you are too experienced for that, but we all are human beings. We all are subject to make mistakes. And this may be very important because I don't think that arm wrestling in general have ever been at this level.
Host: When I say this level, I don't mean that John Burzingo 15 years ago cannot be today's 100 kilo or something. But there are more people and we have never seen all these people together in the same league all the time. So right now is my opinion pinnacle, you know, like highest time. And now there is a possibility to become open category world champion.
Host: and so you already have 115 so but okay okay the question is is you already have 115 kg world title are you in a psychology okay i'm more champion in my category this is something extra if i win is great but if i don't if i lose i mean nothing to be ashamed or this kind of psychology or you are like no i need to win this one because this is very important right now i will be the absolute best in the world
Ivan Matyushenko: um difficult to say perhaps both of them on the one hand i have i think i have nothing much to lose on the other hand i'm not sure that uh i i'm looking for the world title in super heavyweights uh now beach and marauder because i think that there is there are also some other guys
Ivan Matyushenko: like Vitaly, Zidane, Levan. There are some guys who may be world champions. The only thing is that I want to pull Morozov and try myself against him. I want to give a good match.
Ivan Matyushenko: I do not want to lose easily. I would be glad if it were an even match. Of course, I would like to win. Even if you lose, you are saying that you would like to lose after a war. You don't want to be dominated. Yes, yes. Yeah, I understand. And I feel that if my elbow is good, I can win this match.
Ivan Matyushenko: But I haven't felt my elbow healthy for a long time, unfortunately, with my left hand. Last time, in 2015, when I pulled Chris Amir, Dennis, on training, it was done. Whenever the idea came that weight categories may change,
Host: And you said that you were super happy with the 115. And is 110 kilo a weight category that would make you weak to make? You are like 114 kilo or something? No, 110 is okay. So why would you not want 110 kilo? Perhaps...
Host: I would like to add some power and some muscles, maybe. Then we have 120 as well. You think you will have 120 also? No, probably 110, 120 and over. So if it is like that, is it okay for you? Of course, I'm going to make the final thing, but is it going to be okay? Because when it is 120, there is...
Host: Another category that four, five guys from the super heavyweight can also make. Yes. 110 is okay for me. 110. You would pull 110 and 120, both categories.
Ivan Matyushenko: uh maybe and over as well yeah yeah yeah yes it's very difficult for me to uh get weight to get good weight unfortunately it goes with fat mainly yeah and i do not feel um much more power yeah but now i'm 100 uh almost 116.
Host: Yes, I added maybe two kilograms. Okay. But with right arm, for you, maybe except one or two puller from top 10 super heavyweight, you are not so possibly competitive there with right arm. In the super heavyweight, maybe two guys, three guys.
Host: uh but left arm you are up there you know like you probably would like to pull i think that's that's because they have weaker left arm my arms are close to each other actually no no that's not my point my point is if there is 120 kilo then right now with right arm you look competitive only for 115 kilo with left arm 115 and supers and if it is 110 and 120
Host: Looks like you have right arm also two category, while left arm is even three category. Yes. Yeah. We will see. We will see. I haven't made a decision yet, but we will see how it will look. Yeah. And I would like to start perhaps 70 kilos as well, because I think 75 kilos is too heavy to start lightweight.
Host: And I start already woman 60 kilo starting from this July event, hopefully. And then everything will be better and better, I hope. And do you want to make more weight classes? I think there will be one more. Whenever I do weight category, then I think there will be one extra.
Host: right now is 75, 85, 95, 105, 115, super six, at that time there will be seven categories. Yeah, yeah. So I think it's normal. It's normal to have seven categories. Much more than this is probably not necessary, but seven is I think okay. It will be incredible, yeah.
Host: a great event is coming after that king of the table is coming after the july event is coming then august florida and then september another king of the table and then probably end of october east versus west and most likely beginning of december is the king of the table that we will finalize this year so three more east west and one of them in florida yeah
Host: If we include Apple, four more. If we don't include, three more, yeah. We will see. We will see how it will be. And what do you think about Revas and Ziranov? It will be a difficult match for Ziranov because he has some problems with wrist and also he had an injury.
Ivan Matyushenko: if I'm not mistaken, he had an injury with his wrist. So that may be a big problem for him. Because of the style of the Ravazza as well, right? Yes, but on the other hand, Ravazza seems to be better against top-rollers. Top-roller against top-rollers. Can Desano top-roll well? I think... No, I think...
Ivan Matyushenko: Hook is possible. Well, we'll see. I'm not sure. It will be very difficult for Ziranov. One advantage he has is endurance, right? Ziranov?
Ivan Matyushenko: I think he has better side pressure. Yes, he is rather fast also. His hooking ability seems to be better. Actually, when I saw him against Arif and against Farid, yes, he managed to hook them. So I think it's possible, but very difficult.
Host: at the east versus west uh our matches are best of five only the title matches are best of seven but at the king of the table every match is best of seven so one needs to win four matches so that may be favoring uh this i don't know i think that his endurance is very very good that's awesome
Host: I'm curious if he is one of those guys that will make 120 kilos as well if somehow the category changes. How much time do you think I will need to learn how to top roll Ziranov? Listen, it is impossible to say that you don't know how to top roll.
Ivan Matyushenko: As you see, now I add some moves. I also add more exercises on top roll. So I'm improving a little. And I think that I will have more chances of beating Ziranov with some kind of side top roll. I'm telling you, you have been pulling probably more than 20 years. You have been world champion many times. Your level is known.
Host: Everybody considers you as a legend. Just because you are a pure hoop puller, it doesn't mean that you cannot top roll. I believe that anyone who has strong hand and wrist can adopt top roll very easily, even as a hoop puller. Because that is all about hand control. Like you already have this. So all you need to do is instead of adding here, you're going to add here. That's all you need to do.
Ivan Matyushenko: That's what I'm doing. I'm doing a lot of pronation nowadays. But my raisin is rather weak. I mean, hammer codes. That's the problem. When you do hook, do you do any like this? Sometimes, yes. In code position.
Host: not on this button but in code yes yeah okay yeah but still you are doing this so probably that has affected your riser because as a top roller i mean if somebody is coming to the hook like really deep hook then we sometimes do this but laletin has always done this but if you realize that it is hard it is easier to top roll laletin than hooking yes
Host: Yeah, it is because he, if you remember, he was 85, 90 kilo guy at the beginning and he was too tall for anyone. It was almost impossible to top roll him. So just to, because his arms were skinny at that time. So he was keeping here far and then he armrests all the time like this. So when you armrest like this, almost 10 years, 15 years, it is not that easy to build here, you know, in a static way. So probably yours is also like,
Host: doing this all the time like maybe it affected you know because i know other people that i know some guy you know i'm not gonna name but he always arm wrestle like this left hand and then he always arm wrestle like this against the hook pullers so even when he does that dumbbell curl his right is not so good but the left is like a rock here you know so it is like
Host: I don't know if I should say muscle memory, but just because you're keeping that all the time, using your riser that way. So what you need to do, you shouldn't be fighting anyone back pressure to back pressure, but rather you should hold and then move to this way. More side. More side with the pronator. If you want to just go back pressure to back pressure, this may fail. And if this fails, trust me, because you're going outside,
Host: this will probably fail as well. Because whenever you tap on it, if somebody, unless you know how to pull like Laletin does, but I don't know how effective you can be with this. You know yourself better. Yes. Yeah, we will see. We will see. But whenever I saw you against Davit Arabula, I was very surprised.
Host: I thought you were going to go catch him and beat him. That's what we saw for like 20 years almost. Yes, because of that Gulliver's elbow, pronation move, side move seems to be more comfortable. Safer, yes.
Host: 20 years, it is joint to joint. It's not that easy. Even if you don't have a direct injury because of overuse all the time, all the time, all the time, you probably got some damage. And the bad part about getting damaged by overuse is
Host: it's hard to heal that because it came by years and years and years and years. If you had one thing and then get injured, so it is kind of, if you are patient, it can come back easier. But 20 years of overuse, yeah, 20 years of overuse, it is not because of one incident, but it is because of 20 years of pushing the same area, you know, it is harder. But maybe something like
Host: um something like stem cell or you know may may help you here um guys they say that england is thirsty you know it's month of ramadan so i fast more than 14 hours and last night i didn't wait till the sunrise i ate like 2 a.m so seven o'clock 7 30
Host: so it is 10 hours 17 and a half hours so when you fast 17 and a half hours no drink no food so you get thirsty a little bit sorry about it yeah anyways yeah yeah it will be interesting to see you top rolling but just that's that is great that you even try to do that you even try to change yourself you know it is it is incredible just like that's that's because of um
Host: six rounds of four rounds because because of umpire's system i think i have to be more versatile how is it going at the training like whenever you do with the do you try with the training partners how does it go do you mean how train top roll when you when you train at the table top roll and do you think it is good idea to do that before
Ivan Matyushenko: morozov match is it is it because you you trust your wrist so much that i'm gonna hook him anyways i don't need to go so much and do you think i'm not sure uh perhaps he has chances i think i have no chances to top for morozov his wrist seems to be very good for me for me maybe not for the lesson but uh
Ivan Matyushenko: I think I will not be able to top roll him. But still I do pronation just for future, so to say. And that's because it is not painful for me now. So now I do a lot of pronation. I have a question. You said that you cannot top roll him.
Host: about toppling someone who is trying to hook you and toppling someone who is trying to topple you do you think it's the same thing it's not uh certainly i will not trouble him if he goes with trouble if he goes to top roll you would like just just say that if he would go like this to avoid you like and then you go like this and then
Host: May we see a surprise suddenly here? Who knows? I'm not sure. Maybe just to go to straps, but I'm not sure that straps... That's not my advantage, yes. Strap usually helps the person who has stronger arm and stronger pressure, yeah. Perhaps that is Morozov in our case.
Host: I mean, I think your wrist isolation may be better and it is better for you to not to have the strap, you know. Once it is a strap, it is harder to, you know. To use my wrist, yes. Yes, yes, yes. Were you surprised when he hooked Kurdecha right away? Without the strap.
Ivan Matyushenko: I was not very much surprised because I didn't know what to expect from Kurdecha, left hand. So it was... Well, his wrist seems to be good. Yes, it looked good against Ermes as well. So I think his wrist is good. And also his leverage is high.
Host: I think you guys are not so far from each other. He's probably maybe three centimeters taller than you. Talking about Morozov, right? Yeah. Yeah. But against... I don't think it was about the wrist against Ermes. Because I remember Ermes took his wrist
Host: And I think from here, he went up, up, up, up, and then top roll. And later round, yes. I mean second round, second round. Second round, but looks like, you know, Ermes got exhausted so quick, you know. He was already hardly breathing after the Dave Sheffield match. Of course, Morozov also had the Revas match. But I don't know. You understand, like, Ermes didn't seem to have enough cardio, breath, you know.
Host: Yeah, we will see, we will see. But his wrist also seemed good against Corey West when he did this. I think it was the best shape of Morozov, because he was getting ready also for Levan at the same time, if you remember. Yes, but after that he had some illness under the stomach, yes. And he seemed to be not in good shape against Twikov. No, no, no. No, he wasn't, yeah. Yeah.
Host: What would you suggest me doing to beat Morozov? Oh, I don't even really accept Devon versus Devon match. I don't even say who's winning, but I say I give edge to there. But I don't say this guy is going to win. I try to, you know, balance. Well, I heard you that you gave him 55%. 55%.
Host: Yeah, but I give to both sides something and I don't say this guy is going to win or something, you know. But I mean, because it's obvious, you know, after the guy just beat him 6-0, now we don't know what's going to happen. But to say this guy has slightly edge, I think it's fair. You understand? If I would just on the paper, if I would just say that it is exactly 50-50 looking match,
Host: then I would be saying something. Maybe I should never say anything, whatever. But now you are not even asking me to give prediction, you're asking me advice. Listen, I will tell you something. You two, listen, if I would be Armisen Morozov, I would know what I need to do if I was big enough, of course.
Host: And if you are pulling against Morozov, I think you know what to do against him better than I do. Because you know your abilities. You know where it works. Whenever I look at Morozov, in my mind, I see a way to beat him with my own capabilities. But I cannot really look at him with your eyes. I have some ideas, but my ideas wouldn't be even close to
Ivan Matyushenko: what you know about yourself beating him you know well the the so the first uh thought is uh to flash pin yes right him uh four times but uh i think it is it may be possible only if i get um maybe 10 strength okay i will tell you i'm not gonna tell you
Host: how to beat because you know better than i do about you to beat him but much my opinion from outside you need to start the match so quick so fast that you should you need to catch him outside of his elbow lock like somewhere here and then don't let him recover from there if he recovers and puts his shoulder and gets luckier i my opinion is horsepower and endurance
Host: maybe more than yours. When I say endurance more than yours, I see that if you would be pulling 115 kilo match, your endurance, no doubt. But whenever you pull super heavyweight category guy, and then if you both locked like this, then you are pulling against someone possibly who has more horsepower, so you may be getting exhausted
Host: quicker than he does. Also, he has very good endurance. So the way that I see that, you have to start so quick and catch him outside of his joint block and outside of his shoulder. And then here, and then exhaust him there. But if the match goes center, I give the edge to Morozov 55-45, even maybe 57-43. Sorry.
Ivan Matyushenko: Yes, I think the same. I think the same, actually. The only thing I do not like is that even in that open arm position, sometimes the person who attacks, he gets exhausted quicker than the person who, yes, and maybe
Ivan Matyushenko: And it will be difficult to, if he catches all the rounds there, it will be difficult to pin him all the rounds also. Yeah, yeah. It depends how quick you finish after you catch him here. Yes, I think that I have to supinate him more than Kurdecha did. Maybe that is one of the moments. Maybe I have... I may have an advantage. I think...
Ivan Matyushenko: If I cannot beat him, perhaps it's better for me to get back to defensive position. But in this case, I also saw him against Kurdecha that he couldn't beat Kurdecha quickly. It was difficult for him to do it also. But Artem has shoulder press, and that's the problem. After our side pressure exhausts,
Host: Uh-huh. Then bicep. Some shoulders will be wrong. Yes, and that's the problem. So you need to stop him with your bicep then, yeah. And I do not have so good bicep, yes. Who beat you with the shoulder pressure? Can I ask you another thing? How come 75, 80, 85 kilos Zolev
Host: always troubled you probably most of the times you won but always trouble you is it because of his wrist flexor what was it what was that so great with him his forearm right forearm even his hook in his pronator was still reacting from here to stop your shoulder pronation i think he has good side pressure shoulder pronation
Host: He was one of the best hookers, I think. Yes, of course. People don't know right now, but for about 15 years, the guy just smoked everybody in his category. Not sometimes against top goals, he had a hard time, but inside, beating him, he may be even the strongest pound-for-pound hooker ever. Yes, I think he was the strongest, yes. Yeah, whenever Rustam was killing everyone,
Host: Usually he was beating, yeah, they were close, but he was beating Rustam. He was better and Rustam was bigger, perhaps. Yeah, Rustam was bigger, but still they were close, but Zole was slightly better. So that's why I think that pound for pound, I don't know, I don't think there is anybody that has been stronger. Of course, lately he has some issues with the elbow, sometimes wrist, you know.
Host: normal you know when you pull like 20 years it's normal that you get all those damage you know yeah let's see let's see how it will be um it is i i love talking arm wrestling with you and with people who are knowledgeable that we we can catch the same frequency even though you have your own view and i have my own view and i wouldn't really argue
Host: with your view and i wouldn't think that you should be arguing with my view because we both know something but from different perspective you know like you are great at what you are doing and i know what i am doing so what do you think i think that you are much more knowledgeable than me i wouldn't say that i wouldn't say that because like we are all ignorant
Host: Look at those Kazakhs their way. Look at Krasimir, Sasho their way. Look at your way. There are like different, different echoes, you know. So I think that I have one of them. But, you know, we can say that, you know, we know more than each other. But I always respected people who more, who built something
Host: on not super gifted genetic like whenever i look at john whenever i look at levan whenever i look at devon i see extraordinary human beings like extra they're built you know genetically like i wish i had such build you know like i wish i was like 195 centimeter and 130
Host: kilo guy then then it would be the things would be different you know but and even even i couldn't beat my own sister when i was 16 17 17 i think i did but 16 i couldn't i couldn't beat my mom i couldn't so i don't think that i was so great because normally someone who is genetically gifted would be destroying at least his sister how were you how were you probably we talked about it but how were you i was really strong i was really strong yes
Host: I was usually stronger than my, how to say, than those around me, yes. I was very, very shocked that when Taras was toppling everyone, crushing everyone, incredible. And then, how old were you, 20? Yes, maybe 20, 21.
Host: 20, yeah. And then whenever I saw you lost, but every round almost you hook him, you know. He had to beat you with the dragon bicep move. You know, I was like, wow, this guy is something, you know. And then you became incredible. I think you beat him 2008, Norway? Yes. Maybe he was not in his best shape then. Maybe. And I was a little stronger then. I became 100 kilograms. It was 100 already.
Ivan Matyushenko: Yes, I was definitely stronger. And he was not so good then, maybe. Yeah, who knows, yeah. And when we pulled, he was very good. He had really big arms then. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Because that was one of his best shapes. Yes, yes, yes. Around that area, 2004, 5, 6, you know, around those areas, it was incredible. Those years that he also pulled with John Brzing,
Host: Usually it was very hard for John to hook him, but he was hitting from here and then John was also pronating here because Taras really needed full cup. Once he was just like this, it was John's game. John had this pressure. Yeah, but while Taras was just getting a little bit, you know, on the more muscle, you know, he didn't have, you know, like joint pressure.
Host: He was kind of more pronating and out. Maybe you don't remember, maybe you remember, but when 2004 Poland, when Klimenko and Taras pulled at the Europeans, first round, Klimenko tried to first match hook him and then Taras beat him. In the second and third match, final, in the rematch, he toppled. Klimenko was...
Host: extraordinary extraordinary yeah i'm so sad that the guy he you know everyone was saying that this guy was going to be next john brzenk everyone like in my opinion for sure the guy when he was 16 years old he won the waffles in seniors probably he was right hand he beat uh farid uh left hand yeah yeah those guys prime times
Host: Yes, yes, they were really strong and he was 17, 18 maybe, I don't remember exactly. In 2002 he was 16, so in 2004 he was 18. And in 2004 he won four goals at the Europeans, he won juniors and seniors and then he went to South Africa, again he won juniors and then he won the seniors.
Ivan Matyushenko: That year at Europeans and Worlds, he won eight gold medals in dominant fashion. What's that? I lost to him easily in 2004 in the final of Russian Nationals. Oh, left arm? Yes, I became second, but he beat me with ease, I think. Do you think his left arm was better? I don't know, actually. I think about the same.
Ivan Matyushenko: But I remember he and Muriev in 2005 Europeans, they had a tough match. I think maybe Muriev won. I think Klymenko had more wins. Had more wins, I think, Klymenko. Klymenko has more wins against Muriev? I think yes. I'm not sure, but I remember that. That he was the winner.
Host: That was 90 kilo category, I remember. Yes. When I went to the... Go ahead, go ahead. Muriev was very good, yes, and he beat me in those years. Left hand. When I remember this, because 2005 Europeans, when I went there, and it was the first time I saw Hacim Razzolev, and then I was talking with Kazimir Iskandarov, you know Iskandarov,
Host: Yeah, Iskandarov said, Engin, sorry, you and others, no chance. Hacim Razzolev is just going to kill all of you. He said he beats Chakilo, he beats Liliev, he beats Muriev. This is what he told me. And he beats Jambul, everyone. Up to 90 kilos, he said he beats everyone. And...
Host: If you remember, I beat his father's student, Anatoly Mayranseev, in 2001. If you watch the match, at the backside, Zolev Hajimura's father was the referee, but he was jumping like a coach right behind Mayranseev.
Host: And then finally, four years later, this time he brought his son. And then I was like, wow, you know. But I beat him. I beat him there. Yeah, it was great. Yeah, great, great, great years, you know. When was the first time you were in the national team? 2007, maybe? 2000 each. 2000 each. No, when was the first time you were in the Russian team?
Ivan Matyushenko: I became second and second in 2006 at Nationals, but I didn't have money to go to Europe and Hungary and Manchester. Yes, I didn't have money. I didn't have only in 2008. And I remember Norway and Canada.
Host: How did you do in those events? I saw you beat Taras, but did you win? No, I won Taras, but I lost to Gennady Kvikvinia. Oh, can you imagine that, you know, like, look at what you are talking about, Gennady Kvikvinia. All those guys, you know, Irish people knew about WAP and Europeans all those years, you know, how tough events they were. We were rather young with Gennady in those years.
Host: i think we were 24 23 uh again it was 23 24 again is maybe one year younger than me maybe okay i remember first time again either 2005 or 2006 europeans something first time i saw remember i'm i have i i competed first time 93 off so i'm one generation yes yeah yeah yeah um yeah it was good and then how did you do in canada
Ivan Matyushenko: In Canada, I lost twice to Anchesco. I became second left and second right. I had some chances with the left hand, I think. But I also had a golfer's elbow and it was too painful. But I stopped him somewhere. But no chances with the right hand, perhaps.
Ivan Matyushenko: I don't remember who was there also. Frank maybe. I'm not sure. I'm sure we pulled Frank in 2014. He was maybe third. Incredible. In Canada I met Michael Todd. Just I saw him and we got acquainted.
Host: I think he was in super heavyweight category, I think. Or maybe 110. I do not remember. Maybe super heavyweight. But he hasn't won at the Wafers. He has second place, I remember. In 2002, I remember, in Illinois, Wafers, he took second to the Georgi guy. 2003, he also took second place with left arm to Ibragim.
Host: But right arm, I think he was fifth place. So Michael many times tried to win Waffles, but he couldn't. But he was finalist, third place, you know, around there, yeah. Waffle is very, very tough, tough competition, very tough competition. Especially, you know, like for me at this age, one-on-one, fresh match, I'm there. Just bring it. But when you pull someone,
Host: 15, 20 seconds, it is hard for me to meet someone fresh. If he had a better draw, lucky draw, and then he is fresh, I'm not. Because in my prime, I was mostly one head above everyone. So it didn't mean, you know, it doesn't matter, you know, if I had a bad draw, good draw, you know, if you dominate everyone, it doesn't affect so much. But if you had a long match, yeah, like for example, in Malaysia, 2015, my final match was so
Host: If I had that match on round one, round two, round three, I would probably place seventh place, sixth place, eighth place, probably. But whenever this is your last match, then there's no other match, then it's okay. I remember in Hungary, I lost 22 kilos, 92 kilos as I am now, 92. In three months, I lost 22 kilos, and then I put in 70 kilos.
Host: I beat first round, the Ukrainian. Second round, I beat Hristo Delijakov. Third round, I beat Daniel Prokopchuk in a row. And then, because Daniel Prokopchuk was a little bit tougher, and then I lost next two matches. And then I took ninth place. I took ninth place, and the first guy that I beat, Ukraine, was sixth. He was three places above me. And Hristo took fifth.
Host: The second guy I beat, and then Daniel Prokopchuk won the gold. Sometimes it happens, yes. Yeah, and then the three guys that I beat was sixth, fifth, and first, you know. And then when Daniel came to the final, people, he had to beat Mindaugus twice, and he did. And people were saying, who beat this guy? Who sent him to the B side? It was me. But, you know.
Host: Yeah, it is kind of easier for me at this age, it is for me easier to focus one guy, study him and do the whole preparation. So I think at this age, I'm more for supermatch than then. Because I can analyze the guy, I can analyze the guy because for the tournament, I mean, Matushenko, it is just like so many different guys, there are shoulder pressure there,
Host: And then when you are injured, it is not that easy to be ready for everything. It is good to just know. If I know I'm going to pull, I know what to do. If I know I'm going to pull Samushia, I know what to do. If I'm going to pull Dobrin, I know what to do. I know what I need, and that's easy. But to be ready for everything, every round, different guys, you may be exhausted. Your endurance is not as good as before. So it's hard. I don't know. Maybe you disagree. What do you think?
Ivan Matyushenko: I just thought about that recently. Still, I think for me it's better maybe a tournament now. Because I have not too good endurance. And yes, that's my problem. You beat one time the guy and then you send him to B-side. You don't see him till the final. Yes, yes. And I seem to be rather effective against different styles also.
Host: But that is all in the past. Until you make a big tournament for champions, maybe. I have a question for you. How many matches you had already? Three? Three. Davit Arabuli, Kamil Jablonski and Rino Macic. And then you said that this is, for you, a new experience.
Host: But how do you feel? Are you getting adapted? Yes, yes. I feel better. Is it going better than what you were expecting already? It's difficult to say because the opponents were perhaps a little weaker than me.
Ivan Matyushenko: So I didn't have much problem with endurance. But all in all, now it's okay. And also I use a little different moves. So I try to be more versatile. I didn't use that earlier in tournaments. Yeah, but just remember, Reno Masic is the current world champion in 110 kilo. And we saw him against Bacho. Bacho is a freak.
Host: nature of Frick, you know, the different guy, you know. And he was able to exhaust him and beat him. I know what... What? He was great. That was perhaps, to my mind, it was the best match of the day. Yeah, for sure. For sure. Yeah, but so what I'm just saying is when you beat Reno, it is a big job, great job. Reno is a very dangerous guy. He doesn't seem, whenever you hold
Host: understand but he's super powerful with the with the the pressure yeah okay anyway so you said you had time till 10 30 this is 10 40
Host: I would talk till the morning probably, but 50 minutes later I will have another podcast with Krasimir. He is also a very knowledgeable guy, same as you. You both are legends. I mean, no doubt. But perhaps we are above national level and you are world level experts. No, no, no. What national level? Just why are you doing this? Do you really believe what you say?
Host: um no maybe not that much difference yes not that much but a big difference between who uh you and me no come on man come on just don't be like that listen you are a legend worldwide legend and you are 10 from 10 for what you are doing and i am perhaps the same way for what i am doing maybe not but
Host: i don't i don't see that way just you have my huge respect the same also crossing me same as devon same as john you know there are some other guys uh yani samorians you know there are there are some guys you know like in my book uh they are legends imagine that you have been here for 20 years uh and you are not so familiar with super matches you just came you won the world title by beating
Host: current WAP champion. And don't tell me that WAP is not as it used to be or something. WAP is not as it used to be because Russians are missing. And you are that Russian. So it could be the WAP final, you know, you and Reno could be probably the WAP final, you know. And now you are going for the Super Heavyweight title. And imagine that someone who is like usually Krasimir from the Ekaterina Pullers,
Host: are you now 38 39 almost 40 years 39 so from the east side you don't have so many guys at 40 and still at the top you don't have it you know usually americans are that way but here eastern pullers they just do their best for like 10 years and then they will be to do guys who are coming from you know you know young agents and so they continue that way but you are you
Host: Krasimir, you know, you guys are... Krasimir is not that old. Krasimir... Maybe he's two years younger. He's 36, I think. 36, I think.
Host: six years because 2006 he was 18 years old he won the waffles i remember that you know i don't i don't really so much pay attention to the junior competition i do but not so much like i wouldn't be remembering someone 20 years ago so many if it is not extraordinary but krasimir was winning he was going on double voice he was screaming so i remember from there he was 18 years old world champion
Host: And now 18 years plus, he's 36. He was 36 years old. He's 36 now. And he continues the same way. Did you see Abdullah Eldarov? Yes. He's training Artem Taino. People don't know who Abdullah Eldarov is. First time I saw him was 1998 Europeans. First time. So probably Abdullah Eldarov now at least 45 years old or even...
Host: Older, but at least 45. He's older, for sure. I think he's older. Older than 45? Yes, I think so. Yeah, but what happened that a few months ago he competed in AMC.
Host: after 10, 12 years. He just went, he beat Sarmat with top roll. Yeah, Sarmat got fouls, but he was losing already. And then second time Sarmat hook him and beat him. But can you imagine that he's 50 years old, coming and then beating Sarmat, you know, after 12 years of break. He's really good. I remember pulling him in 2005 and I lost to him in Russian Nationals, maybe semi-final. It was a long match.
Host: he was very good and after that he and I think it was not his best shape for them but what I'm just saying that people like I'm telling you in the lighter weight categories people from the past like people from today would not say that they are the best ever or something oh I'm not seeing so much hey by the way do you see the chat do you see who is on the chat
Host: If it is real Gennady, Engin is a legendary organizer. Hello Gennady, hello my friend. Gennady is just a different human being, seriously. The guy is so much inside of him. He's breathing fire. I feel like he may just...
Host: he's getting bigger and bigger and bigger, like at the stage, more he pulls, especially once he starts like, you know? Yeah, incredible, incredible, yeah. Somebody is saying that Eldorov is eight-time world champion for left, for right. I don't exactly remember how many times, but I know that he has been many times world champion. We are very, very, very...
Host: All friends with Abdullah. He writes to me, he writes to me from Telegram. He says, Engin, just give me a few months, I'm ready. Of course, of course, I'm always open to the new guys. I almost got Arsene, but something happened, Arsene, I couldn't get it, so what to do? I'm sure that he can be one of the best. Again, I'm sure. Abdullah? Yes, yes.
Host: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, he told me he's 92 kilos, but he can make 85 kilos anytime he wants. And imagine him 85 kilos versus Samushia. I don't think it would be an easy match. I think it would be a war. Do you think Samushia can dominate him? I think that Samushia is not very comfortable for Abdullah.
Ivan Matyushenko: I think that Abdullah may be better against top rowers. But did you see that Taino was doing like this and he was still attacking over Taino's pronators? Did you see those videos, two of them? Yes, yes. But still I think that he is better against top rowers. And Samushia may be too much for him, but for sure it will be, they will pull. It will be a match. It will not be easy.
Host: but you said too much and now you say it's not easy too much is no i mean it will not be true um he may be too much for him i know i mean that um he will lose but it will be a good match anyway so thank you very much ivan thank you as i said i would talk with you forever about arm wrestling you have a lot
Host: you know, and I know some, and then we will talk, but thank you very much again. And then I plan to invite Morozo next week for a podcast, but I don't think I will ask you to come as a translator because it would be good, you know, if you guys do it after the East versus West and now King of the Table also started to do podcasts and then it would be good if you guys would meet there. It would be more ethical.
Host: so if i invite him probably i will invite someone else as a translator but but but tuesday alijan murado and hermes will be my guests can you help alijan i think so yes okay yeah okay so then we we can talk about the time privately and then yeah we meet again thank you very much uh i appreciate you on here and hope to hope to see you again
Host: See you. Yeah, thank you. Guys, thank you very, very much for being my guest here. And very soon, I will be back with Krasimir Kostadinov and other legends. These guys are just incredible guys, these guys.
Host: very knowledgeable guys. They know what they are talking about. I would suggest you guys, if you have intention, some people, some fans, they are more part of it. We entertain and I respect them as well. We need all kinds of fans. But if you are an arm master, you want to learn, just listen to these guys. And then...
Host: You will learn. You will learn something for sure. I thank you guys and see you in 40 minutes. Take care.
