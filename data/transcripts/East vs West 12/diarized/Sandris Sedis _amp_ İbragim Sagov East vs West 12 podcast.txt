Engin Terzi: I started training hockey. I did one training on Sunday, and the last two days I was busy. And today I did also training, but I'm doing not super heavy. Unfortunately, every time I stop for some time, I need to start from the beginning. All is fine, Jeremy Parker. Thank you, my friend. I hope.
Engin Terzi: You are doing well. Dog, dog, brag. Hello, England. Thank you for all you do. Thank you for your support, my friend. Thank you. We all together do. I do my part. Ezra, can you do your part? Athletes do their part. Sponsors do their part. And then we all together. Panzer came. Panzer. What I said. How do you pronounce your last name? I cannot hear you.
Sandris Šedis: I don't hear. Can you hear me now? Yep, I hear you now, yeah. Right. So it's Sandris. Sandris, yeah, Sandris, yeah.
Engin Terzi: with a soft ass. Yep, yep. Hello, big grove goals. Hello, Mustafa Hussain. Brandon versus Paulo, yeah. Yeah, I saw that match, yeah. So how is everything? You look incredible lately. Your arms are just looking, I mean, very big, very, I don't know, you look like the rest. Help you a lot.
Sandris Šedis: Oh, yeah, definitely. I had an opportunity to train more. And actually, a lot of people saying I look bigger, but actually I'm smaller in weight now. Yeah, but the size look big. You know, the arm right now, I see. Coming out, so maybe that's why. A little bit leaner. Getting rid of all the fat. So feeling good. Yeah, that's good. You have very strong opponents.
Engin Terzi: We will join very soon. Definitely. Yep. Very interesting. Yeah. Oh, no, no. Listen, I didn't say the weight classes have changed. I said possibly. Just read what I wrote. I said possibly will change.
Engin Terzi: And it doesn't even if it changes, it doesn't have to be as I wrote, the only thing for 100% change with the weight classes is the woman's 60 kilo addition. The woman's 60 kilo addition is already done. But as I said, like possibly will change means that there is a possible possibility, you know, and it is not changed. Because I have been talking with the athletes. And
Engin Terzi: Majority of them are not happy with the idea of weight category changes. But for sure we need to put some lighter men category as well. Who came? Hello, Ivan. Great to see you. Hello, great to see you. Hello, Sandris. Hi. How are you? Good, good. How are you?
Sandris Šedis: good thank you how's your shoulder it's getting better still a little bit sore but i can i can pull sideways now and it doesn't hurt when i arm slow on table so that's good uh no serious injury uh it was partial tear but right now it's probably all healed up is it is it possible you guys to turn the horizontal sideways the phones
Engin Terzi: so we can feel the screen. It's horizontal. OK. Sagov came as well.
Engin Terzi: Hello, Ibragim. Salaam alaikum. He doesn't hear. By the way, salaam alaikum means peace be upon you. Means like peace, peace be upon you. That's what it means, you know. You hear us, Ibragim? I think he needs to
Engin Terzi: touch the screen. Okay, let's start until they fix the audio problem.
Ivan Matyushenko: And Ivan, don't you think that Sandris look big, big, the arms and everything? Yeah, compared to before. I think like he was. He looks bigger on his pictures on Instagram. Maybe after training. Yeah. Yeah.
Sandris Šedis: yeah anyway he's going now for 105 i think very few people want to go 115 maybe yes yes i think there's not that many natural 115 kilo guys so either everyone needs 120 or 107 so what's your weight uh usually 107 eight
Ibragim Sagov: oh it was 112 because for a while 110 but right now it's 107. yeah how are you
Ivan Matyushenko: Can you speak Russian?
Engin Terzi: Yes, yes. Okay, so those three can speak. I'm the only one that cannot, okay. So it's good that we don't have to translate to Spanish. You can only translate to us. I understand everything. Yeah, okay. It's the same thing anyway. So how is everything, Ibragim? Хорошо? Хорошо, хорошо.
Ibragim Sagov: Ivan didn't translate, but I think he understood what I said. Yeah. How is the training? What is your weight now? At the moment, my weight is 110 kilograms. Everything seems to be fine, everything is according to plan. It's not an option to lose weight yet.
Ivan Matyushenko: Without injuries, without micro injuries, without big injuries. I don't have a ligament. Weight 110 kg. And the training according to the plan. Everything is good. No injuries. No injuries yet, right? So you're training carefully now to... Yes, I have a ligament. I had an injury, Vanya, after...
Engin Terzi: He had an injury, but now it's okay. But he doesn't train too hard. Yeah, I mean, he looks too hard. He's just putting things like this. Today I saw on Instagram. 120 kilos, not too hard. Yeah, I think he told you, okay, you told him, right, Sandris, that he should carry his own weight.
Engin Terzi: Yes, yes. Yeah, what does he think about that? Can you make, Ibragim, your phone horizontal, like sideways? Yeah, yeah. Can you tell him that whenever he is training, two people are lifting the weight from the cable, and then he is training, while Sandris says that he takes his own weight, and what does he think about that, Ibragim?
Ivan Matyushenko: Did you understand, Ibragim? A small provocation. Sandris noticed that two people helped you when you were doing exercises. And Sandris himself is losing weight. And I think he wrote something about it. Yes, I know. I'm interested in your reaction.
Ibragim Sagov: The reaction is absolutely normal. I have such a moment. My block, on which I work, is quite heavy. With one hand, you can't carry it alone. You can see that it's... Why do I need these guys if I can take it so easily? On this block, Sandris...
Ibragim Sagov: I don't know. I don't even know who will pull me up. Even Adam. Adam has a block marker for him. He is much lighter. I worked with him too. He is heavy. Ibragim thinks that his pulley system is hard.
Ivan Matyushenko: is hard, how to say, difficult to move. And he thinks that Sandris wouldn't be able to take the weight as well on his pulley. And on the other hand, he thinks that it's a waste of time to get the weight from the pulley himself.
Sandris Šedis: What do you think, Sandris? Is he finding excuses? No, I think we just train differently, you know. I do my exercises more cleanly, more controlled, with a little bit less weight. And then he does more of a max effort training, you know, in a small movement. So that's just a different style of training. As you can see, both things work very well.
Ivan Matyushenko: Yeah, but who is this will work better on Apple 20? Mine, of course, mine. Yours, of course, yeah, okay. Sandris asks whose style will work better. Sandris said, you understand, right, that the styles are different in your workouts. You take more weight there, but you have shorter amplitude there. Sandris does less weight, but there is more amplitude, yes, clearer, yes.
Ivan Matyushenko: Well, he also says that both approaches work, but his approach should be better on April 20th. Well, it's a matter of time. What are you saying? It's a matter of time, who is better. Ibragim agrees that the table will show which style is better. Okay. When Ibragim came for the first time,
Engin Terzi: He lost against Tata Shinks and he told me directly that he underestimated that old man. And this time, this time he's coming. Is he underestimating Sandris or this time he's bringing his best shape? Engin says that when you lost your first armfight,
Ivan Matyushenko: You said that you underestimated Todor Kachins. Well, Engin asks, in this case, do you have any underestimations from Sandris? Or is there also? Well, how is it? No, no, no, there is no such thing. Well, now, yes, Vanya, now I absolutely know where I'm going, with whom, well, what organization, there. I'm now completely prepared in a different way, so to speak.
Ibragim Sagov: And so that there were no excuses, I wasn't ready, something hurt. Now I will perform differently. And with Todd, yes, it was. I underestimated, I didn't think that, well, it's already a year, I can easily pass it. Such thoughts. But I made a mistake, who doesn't make mistakes.
Ivan Matyushenko: Now Ibragim takes his opponent seriously. There will be no such excuses. He changed his preparation and now he thinks it will be different.
Ivan Matyushenko: Last time he made a mistake, he thought Todd was a bit too old, but now he takes it seriously. Okay, so he sees this as an opportunity to show who he is.
Ivan Matyushenko: How do you think, Ibragim, if there is another opportunity to fight Todd Hutchinson, will it be different?
Ibragim Sagov: Now, at the moment, I don't think he can do anything to me. Even in his worst form, I gave him a decent fight, 3-2. Well, in terms of fouls, it doesn't matter. You know, it doesn't matter if I'm a foul. You lost in every foul, no matter if it's a foul or not. Even in this form, I gave him a decent fight.
Ibragim Sagov: who was not given Angarbayev, Irakli. It was easier for them than it was for me. And now I can even beat him in the dry. I'll see how it goes in the dry in English. Say that in the light.
Ibragim Sagov: Now Ibragim thinks it would be completely different and he thinks he would beat Todd 3 or 4-0 easily.
Ivan Matyushenko: And that's all he said? What? Is that all? No. He also said that he thinks he gave a good fight to Todd, even as hard as other opponents like Angarbaev and...
Ivan Matyushenko: And maybe even harder. And also he had some tough rounds. But also he thinks he was not in his best shape. Now he thinks he would win easily. But also he agrees that maybe he overestimates himself again. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But probably it was a good lesson for him. Yeah, yeah.
Engin Terzi: And Sandris, now you are trying to reach top in another category which is 105 and you walk around what now 108 kilos? Yeah, I walk around 107-108 kilos right now. And how do you feel your power compared to when you are a little bit over 110?
Sandris Šedis: I feel good. I don't have any serious pain or anything. And I was 116 a month ago. And like right now, I feel much, much stronger, I believe, much more endurable as well. So overall, I feel I feel better than than before, definitely. And where do you see yourself, Sandris, compared to the other
Engin Terzi: one of five guys. Are you ready for the top or it will take a little bit more time? How do you see Ibragim Sabah being your first opponent in this category? Is it a tough start? I know Ibragim is very strong, but I think it's a good start for me. I don't see myself
Sandris Šedis: less than like top five top three like if you would say like tomorrow you pull dadikian you know i would pull you know so i believe i can beat any anyone in that class and uh if i'm very well prepared and healthy you know that's what's gonna happen
Ivan Matyushenko: Maybe, Ivan, you could tell Sagov what Sandris said, so he would know what his opponent is saying. We discussed how Sandris sees himself in 105 kilos. Sandris thinks that he is in the top three, in the top five. And he feels able to fight and win anyone, including
Ivan Matyushenko: And Brett Grundy is in the chat. And did you see his match against Paolo Sandris? Yeah, I saw some footage. And yeah, I was impressed.
Sandris Šedis: first round first round pablo beat him but after that uh yeah he he took over and uh very very impressive uh we don't know how how tired pablo was after michael match but uh it's it's still uh still very very very good and uh definitely definitely strong upcoming armistler from north america
Engin Terzi: Yeah. And Ivan, can you ask Ibragim also where he sees himself compared to the guys who are ranked above him at East vs West? How do you think, Ibragim, where you are in the 105 kg rating? Approximately. Well, to say approximately, yes. I think... Here...
Ibragim Sagov: So, let's say, in the second place, for sure. This is my opinion. My most uncomfortable opponent will be Angerbaev, because he is a very good striker. With Dadikyan, I respect him very much. He is good, he is powerful. He won the Toto. But I think it will be easier for me with Dadikyan.
Ibragim Sagov: than with Angarbaev, so to speak. Well, with Krasimir, too, it will be easier. I don't see anyone else who can beat me. But with Angarbaev, I put him in the first place. I don't know, Prudnik, Eugeniy Prudnik, too, in the 105th. I think the fifth one is injured now. Well, Prudnik, too, I think I can pass.
Ivan Matyushenko: Ibragim sees himself at second place. Maybe after Angarbaev. He finds Angarbaev the most difficult opponent for him. And he thinks he may beat all other
Engin Terzi: all other uh well he has uh not possibility but uh he has chances against uh yes and and he he said that his weight is 110. time to time would he want to pull 115 as well or only his only focus is 105.
Ibragim Sagov: Your weight is 110 kg. Did you think about fighting at 115 kg? Or do you have more plans at 105 kg? I want to reach the belt at 105 kg. I can try at 115 kg. And so, among the guys in the 115 kg category, I can also fight. If they offer, I will fight.
Ivan Matyushenko: he feels better at 105 and he would like to win 105 title first okay but it's also possible for him to uh pull with uh some someone from 115 true it's possible but he's focused on 105.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, okay. He wants to pull some 115 guys as well in the future after he wins 105. Yes, yes, yes. And does it include the guy who is translating for him? I don't know. You're my friend. I can't do that with you.
Ivan Matyushenko: It's possible, he says. It's possible. Yeah, yeah. I'm just teasing. He cannot pull hard against me. But anyway, it's possible. Let's put it this way, Vanya. Let's put it this way.
Ibragim Sagov: It seems to me that you are stronger than me. To be honest. Well, until we fought, we didn't stand at the table. I can't say for sure. But I think you are more powerful, stronger. I'll tell you, I don't know why. But it will be interesting to fight at the table, no problem. Well, again, you weigh less. And if you gain weight too, then maybe... You always seemed very strong to me.
Ibragim Sagov: I was your fan when I was younger. You always surprised me, both against top players and against top players. For me, you are strong. Maybe I'm stronger behind the table. I don't know. At the moment, I think you are stronger. Thank you. To be honest, I don't know if I think I'm stronger than you.
Ivan Matyushenko: I think the question here is also who will start first. If you take the phase, it is also fast, so it is possible to hold heavy weights. Even if you weigh 120 kg, it can also be hard for me. Ibragim says that possibly he thinks that now maybe I am stronger, but just now.
Ivan Matyushenko: Okay, he told all those things and it's just like three words to translate? No, he said that when he was younger, he watched my videos. He liked the way I hug people. He thought I'm too strong. And now when he became strong himself, well, so that's about it. By the way, Sandris, do you want me to block Reno?
Engin Terzi: yes yes please he's annoying he's annoying yeah he's just coming here and just disturbing us let me see let me see yeah okay so i blocked him here anyway so that's good that's also another one that yeah okay thunders you believe you're gonna beat ibrahim but i know you wouldn't want but is there anyone on your mind that like
Sandris Šedis: Like you want to, like, I know you need to focus right now on Ibragim, but is there anyone, if you win, that you would like to pull after that? Yeah, many people. Basically, anyone from the 105 kilo class. I would love to pull Ivan as well sometime with the right arm. Maybe 110 kilos, you know. No, we don't have such category. It's been a long time since we pulled, and I don't think we have pulled right arm.
Engin Terzi: You know, for me, but yeah, Todd Hutchings, Sondra Baev, anyone. Okay. You know, Sandris is one of those guys that have pulled many East versus West matches, yet didn't lose any, correct? Sandris, you had four matches? Yes, yes, that's correct. You beat Chen Shou, you beat Matt Mask, and then you beat Paulo, and then what's the fourth one? Lachlan.
Sandris Šedis: Yeah, you beat all those four guys. What do you think about Ibragim compared to those other four? I think Ibragim is definitely a step above the others, definitely. I would probably say that
Sandris Šedis: out of those four, like at that time, Pavlo probably was the strongest one. But yeah, I think Ibragim is more dangerous, faster, maybe more experienced, you know, in pulling in Russia and stuff like that. And more endurance probably compared to Pavlo. Oh, definitely, definitely. And how do you see this one, Ivan?
Ivan Matyushenko: How do you see this match? I'm sure you predicted before, but you said Ibragim. Last time I told that if Sandrić is healthy and if he has form like I saw him against Gitala at Worlds and against Pavlo when he beat them in hook, in that case
Ivan Matyushenko: if he doesn't sleep he has big chances but i'm not sure and that that was my first question i will help because if you have some problems with rotator shoulder rotation it's very difficult to be good in hook so so it depends i'm not sure that but also sundries has top roll so
Engin Terzi: there is another chance okay a question for you which one is better technique for sundries to beat ibrahim top roll or hook i mean for you look for sure but from the sundries perspective
Ivan Matyushenko: But perhaps he doesn't understand us for a long time. Yeah, you can translate, yeah. Let's discuss, Ibragim, how to win better. I have a question. Yes, and you said that if he goes up, he will win. Yes, yes, I understood. Up or in the hook? I don't know. I think that again here you have what's up, what's in the hook. Here the question is who will start.
Ivan Matyushenko: As a hooker, I would say that I personally prefer the hook. Of course, I don't fight. But Sandris fights differently, so I don't know. I know that Sandris has a strong hook, in general, he had a strong hook. And, in principle, a good hook. In my opinion, it's more of a hook. What would you say, Engin?
Ivan Matyushenko: i think i think hook maybe is preferable uh for sundries maybe but uh uh if anyone has a good top roll with good state pressure uh with good center uh and he's fast so both parents are possible how is your shoulder
Sandris Šedis: anyone is worried worried about you uh it does it it's better definitely it doesn't hurt when i when i pull on table in in hook top roll it doesn't hurt uh it's still with with some rotation it's a little bit sore but uh nothing like it was uh four months ago when i when i couldn't really pull in in any way yeah it's it's getting better and i think by april it will be 100
Engin Terzi: Yeah, Reno Masi says the sound has changed that short once in a while. I can smell you through my screen. I mean... I put it on just now. I just put it on, so it's clean. I mean, we know that. We know that. Why this guy is messing? Like, should I put him in timeout or something? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, he's just... I think he's just jealous of you. This is what I realized, you know. Why would he be messing with you, you know, yeah.
Engin Terzi: Yeah. Maybe he wants a match with me. What's that? Maybe he wants a match with me as well. Okay, okay. And yeah, what was I gonna say? Ibragim, what do you think like someone like Tautiev pulling someone like Ongarbeev? How would you see such a match? They both go outside.
Ivan Matyushenko: Tautieva with Angarbaev. What do you think, when will the fight take place? Who will win, right? Well, when, who will win, how can it be? Well, I think, probably, Angarbaev will win.
Ibragim Sagov: Because of his speed. I think he's a little more powerful. And he also had a good circle, as far as I remember. I bet on Angarbaev. I don't know. Georgi is also very good, very strong. But I think Angarbaev will win. Ibragim would bet on Angarbaev. He thinks he's a bit more powerful.
Engin Terzi: Hmm, I understand, yeah. But 105 kilo Taute also look very strong, I saw. I don't know what you think, Ivo. What do I think? Yeah, yeah, Taute, well, like 85 kilo, the guy is two meter. When he is 85 kilo, he is too skinny, same as like Laletin was. 85 kilo he was, I remember, or 90 kilo. Now when he is heavier, like those guys are getting really strong, you know.
Ivan Matyushenko: I think he may be also top 5, top 3 in this weight as well. He may be very uncomfortable. I thought it was very difficult to top-roll him and mostly he lost to top-rollers. Yeah, he lost to top-rollers mostly, yeah. Yes, but there was some Armenian, Arsen.
Engin Terzi: who managed to hook him. But maybe Arsene also has a very great... You're talking about the overalls or you're talking about category? Category. Yeah, but you're talking about 95 kilos when he was 95 kilos. Yes, yes. Now perhaps he's... I'm talking about... I didn't see 95 kilos Tautier so impressive. Still impressive. But whenever I see him in 105 kilos, he even won one match against... One round against Ibragim.
Engin Terzi: So he looked really strong, you know, whenever he gained weight, yeah. For sure he is. He is top level puller. And, you know, he had wins against Trubin. Trubin. Yeah. And some other guys. Yeah. But somehow I saw him in two different events. He was losing to, like, Viorel Dobrin. But, again, he was 85 kilos.
Engin Terzi: But in the same 85 kilos, he has wins against Haji Murad Zola. You know, that's also interesting. That would be good. Like, he versus Sandris, he versus Matt Mask, he versus Ongarve, top row versus top row. Do you think he's better against the hook pullers or better against the top puller now when he gains weight? You ask me or Ibragim? Yeah, I'm asking your opinion. Ibragim. No, you. Me, me.
Engin Terzi: i think he is more uh he's better against um i think he's better against them yes because he has that low hand top roll okay anyway so let's quickly go about the the matches you know what these guys are thinking i'm curious and let's start with the uh
Engin Terzi: nugo uh chicago versus petro margarine you pull petro margarine right sandris in moldova event yeah six six years ago or something like that yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah but at that event i think he was really good you were not the only one that you want to even beat as far as i want to be john revas
Engin Terzi: Very well. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And you saw the Chikadze at the last Europeans, top row in Krasimir. Yeah. In Strap. Yeah. And Krasimir told me that Chikadze is very strong against the hook pullers. And Marharint is going that way, but not really deep hook, but more like with the wrist. And Marharint, like when Marharint hook and beat Revas in 2018, Revas two months earlier
Engin Terzi: He gave a very tough match to Levan Levan Saginashvili in Antalya Wars. And of course, that was against a top roller. But what do you think about this match? Do you see Marharint's or Chikadze's favourites?
Sandris Šedis: i think i think i i see margarita's favorite and as a winner in this match maybe 70 to 30 for margarine because he is prepared you know is is really good really good and i think i think experience also can help him to win and uh uh i don't know chikadze like
Sandris Šedis: I don't think Krasi's hand is that dominant like Marharint's. It's a little bit easier to take. I'm not sure he can do the same with Petro. What do you think about since you're thinking that highly about Marharint's future chances in that category? Probably one of the top guys as well.
Engin Terzi: Top grade easily, I think. If he is in that great shape, he can be a threat for anyone? Yeah, definitely. If he's very well prepared, I think he's very dangerous. Yeah, okay. And can you ask Ibragim, please, Ivan, what does he think about this match? Does he know the guys? We discussed Marharint, Petro, and a lot of Chikadze.
Ivan Matyushenko: You know, probably both. Petro has been fighting for a long time. He has a very strong hand. He twisted both Borzenko and Lutidze. He twists everyone. And Chikadze, it turns out, he won Krasimir Verkhov in the recent world. And I think he became a champion. Well, he's been fighting for quite a while. What do you think, who will win?
Ibragim Sagov: Ibragim thinks Marharint will win this match because of his wrist.
Engin Terzi: yeah very sure many people doesn't know this but his wrist people talks about your wrist even being so strong and it is very strong but yours is also a little bit that the quickness and the sometimes even a little bit forward move this guy just holds and then curves and he's not not speed no forward moving but he's just like
Engin Terzi: But maybe I say pound for pound, maybe he has the strongest wrist. I don't know, because how can you all grab like this and hook him like this, you know, with wrist power? I don't know. Agreed. Yeah. It is good that, you know, one of my intention to organize these events, Ivan, all those great pullers, monsters,
Engin Terzi: From WAF, we know that these guys have been pulling also WAF. But they were not so famous. The world didn't know about them. The world would know about the YouTuber. They may even think that this is the best guy in the world. While these guys are incredible, but like 90% of the community wouldn't know about them because they are not at the main stage.
Engin Terzi: Anyway, so it is good that they will get to know these guys, but we will see who is going to be winner. And this one, I only want the prediction, like the score, you know, I don't want any details. Sandris Šedis versus Ibragim Sagov. Who's winning there, Sandris? Sandris is 3-0. 3-0. Easy or war? Pretty easy. Pretty easy. Okay. Iman?
Ivan Matyushenko: Can you translate that to Ibragim and then ask his production? Angin asks, he's just interested in the score of your fight with Sandris. Sandris said 3-0, easy, in his favor. And you? What do you think? Only the score, only the score. Well, the score, yes. Well, I think the same 3-0 in my favor, probably. Well, in touch, I think. I don't know.
Engin Terzi: he also thinks three zero flash pins but uh the other way around oh okay ibrahim says ibrahim is winning in the sun and uh kalnichenko is in the chat he says peter margaret margaret needs a certain period to adapt to arm fights and
Engin Terzi: And he says also, hello, arm wrestling fanatics. Yeah, Kalinyshenko, we need you also in this arm fight very soon. Okay, let's go. Talgat Aktaev versus Betkili Oniani. Sandris. I think Talgat Aktaev.
Engin Terzi: Because he's bigger now, fast, strong. You think Betkili is not bigger and stronger now? Because he's also around 95 kilos. We saw him 75 and 80. Now he's also 95. What do you think?
Engin Terzi: Yeah, but I haven't seen him in a long time pulling. So I've seen what Talgat has done. And it can be a war, but I favor Talgat in this one. Yeah, that one is also interesting. Talgat is known to be a splash pinner, while Betkili is the one that can pull forever. So you are saying that it can be a war and Talgat still win it.
Engin Terzi: They pulled in 2017 around 30 seconds and Betkili won. Talgat was here and then Betkili just lift him, lift him, lift him, lift him and beat him. But you are saying that even in a war, Aktaev is going to win? I think so. I think so. Yeah, of course, you never know what's going to happen. But yeah, I feel Talgat has gotten better.
Engin Terzi: Okay. By the way, Ibragim, the poll result I put on the YouTube, it says now 58% Sandris, 42% yourself. And then also, what do you think about Talgat Aktaev and Betkili? Do you know these guys? I'm asking about Betkili Anyanya and Talgat Aktaev. Do you know these athletes?
Ibragim Sagov: I know Talgat, but I don't know another one, to be honest. You know Talgat. And they also said that in their voting, who wins, 58% for Sandris. But I think it doesn't matter to you at all. No, I was there as always. I was there at AMC too. I didn't get much votes. But it turned out that I won.
Ivan Matyushenko: Ibragim says it's a usual thing for him that he is an underdog. So it's okay. And unfortunately, he doesn't know Bitkile. Okay. Only Talgat. Okay. And Sandris, the GOAT versus Artur Makarov? The GOAT.
Engin Terzi: The goal is, you know, Mindaugus-Tarasaitis. Of course, of course, the front arm sling. Some crazy people think it's a jumper sling, but what to do? We need to tolerate their ignorance. Mindaugus did amazing against Prokopchuk last fight and very happy for him that he got the title.
Sandris Šedis: And I think Makarov for him is a pretty good matchup because, like,
Sandris Šedis: Usually people take Makarov's hand and he kind of just, you know, pushes sideways. It's very hard to push Mindaugus that way if you don't have a deep supination hook position. So I think Mindaugus can win this. Mindaugus is going to win? I think so. Is it your mind or your heart?
Engin Terzi: It's a bit of both. 50-50. Okay. And Ibragim, Mindaugus Tarasaitis versus Artur Makarov. Artur Makarov, Mindaugus. 50-50, I guess. 50-50. He thinks 50-50 is a bit better than the previous one.
Ivan Matyushenko: Yeah, what does he think about Mindaugus? What do you think about Mindaugus? Yes, I saw that he won against Prokopchuk. Yes, he won against Prokopchuk. Yes, he won against Prokopchuk. Yes, he won against Prokopchuk. Yes, he won against Prokopchuk. Yes, he won against Prokopchuk. Yes, he won against Prokopchuk. Yes, he won against Prokopchuk. Yes, he won against Prokopchuk. Yes, he won against Prokopchuk.
Ibragim Sagov: Both athletes are good. He's not sure about Makarov's endurance.
Ivan Matyushenko: Maybe Mindaugus has bad endurance, he thinks. He cannot bet. It's just 50-50. There are some comments. Do you receive a lot of hate because of your pulling style in Russia? Yes, yes, yes.
Ibragim Sagov: I don't know what to say. Yes, they write a lot of things. The fight is dirty, the tricep doesn't stand properly, the shoulder is already charged. There are judges, all judges. They can't be for me.
Ibragim Sagov: And who can pull me out? It's Tautil who pulls me out. It was Tadzil who pulled me out of there. And those who can't, it's their problem. There are haters, they write, I don't know. I beat AMC four times, Russia twice. I became a champion at the Russian Championship. I don't know.
Ivan Matyushenko: Yes, there are quite many haters. But Ibragim thinks that his style is good and most referees, it could not be...
Ivan Matyushenko: the station when all the referees make mistakes, and those who are really strong, they can win him like Tautiv, like Todd Hutchings, and for all others, his style is bad and dirty. Yeah, it is not dirty, it's normal style, you know, I mean, this is, as long as you bring the hand down, I mean, you may not enjoy, but it's, I mean, normal style, you know, as long as the shoulder doesn't cross the
Ivan Matyushenko: center yeah many people many haters say that uh the shoulder is crossing the table but ibrahim says that uh he won four times amc and two times russian nationals and uh all the referees could not make mistakes all the times yeah yeah yeah i mean yeah yeah i agree i agree yeah um
Ibragim Sagov: I used to fight in the top, in the top, in the side, I also fought in the side movement. I came from Daura, I won in the top, clean, without ties, without fishing, yes, in 2015. He then weighed 120 kg, I weighed 80 kg, well, 78 kg. He won in the top, there is a video. I used to fight in the top, in the basic top, many guys won in the top. In the side, too, in the side, I won, Gusov, too. It's just that I have a trauma when I'm in the top.
Ivan Matyushenko: He said that he used to top row and he went top row to Zaur 7 years ago when he was 120 and he was 80. Also he pulled in hook.
Ivan Matyushenko: side pressure with Gusev and some other pose but he had injuries and that's why he started to use this style shoulder press I think yes right Engin it's shoulder press yeah so what I just tried to say that
Engin Terzi: as long as it is in the rules, you know, I mean, the old styles are acceptable, you don't have to enjoy it. But if it is in the rules, I mean, so it's what to do, you know, I mean, it is most people like, for example, me, as an opponent, it is not
Engin Terzi: Engin has the same opinion that there are different styles and you can treat them differently.
Ivan Matyushenko: Every style has the right to live, if it is within the rules. If the judiciary allows it, then it is possible. And there should be no questions. And the rest is personal, personal attitude. It is clear that some artists do not like, for example, with a bent brush, something there, techniques and so on. This is already something that someone likes.
Sandris Šedis: Let's talk about Irakli Zirakashvili Oleg Petro. A very, very interesting match. I think it has been a long time coming for these two. I believe Oleg should probably soon pull for the title, if not already.
Sandris Šedis: left arm he's super strong right arm maybe is a little bit weaker for Oleg but he's still super strong there and like I think for Irakli he's very very uncomfortable arm slur because he goes he can top roll he can go sideways in a hook he has very big very strong hand and Irakli basically pulls just one style and
Sandris Šedis: He's susceptible to side pressure arm slurs who go sideways and with a lot of hand, a lot of side pressure. I think Oleg Petro has a slight edge in this one, but I wouldn't be surprised if either of the guys win the match.
Ibragim Sagov: It's a very interesting match for Ibragim.
Engin Terzi: But he thinks that Petro is the favorite. He has a little more chances. I have a question for all three quickly, then we can continue. What is the top two, toughest category at the East vs. West? Sorry, what is top two, what? Toughest category, toughest, like so many, so many competitions.
Engin Terzi: I mean, my opinion, all categories are very, very hard to win. But the number of the competitors who are hitting for the top, like in 105 and also super heavyweight category, I think is just the most, I don't know, toughest competition. But what do you think, Ivan?
Ivan Matyushenko: It's difficult to compare 105 and over 115, because in both categories there are more than maybe 10 tropical pools. Yes, this is what I am saying, both are very tough. Yes, and you just maybe have to count how many competitors are there in 105 and over. I think they are rather equal.
Ivan Matyushenko: No, I'm not comparing them. I'm just saying that these two categories are the toughest compared to the others. Yes, that's for sure. That's what I think. They're extremely great. But maybe right, only right. Ah, both right hands, because both left are not so tough. Yeah, like there's Stradikian, Prudnik, Alizhan. There are some good left arm as well, you know. Even Petro. Yeah.
Sandris Šedis: Yes, but also there are maybe 4-5 strong left-hand forwards, both in 105 and 0. And there are more than 10 right-hand. Yeah, yeah. And what do you think, Sandris, about the toughest two categories, do you think? Yeah, I would agree. 105, definitely, and probably super heavyweights. Maybe 95, but 105 and plus 115 is probably better, tougher.
Engin Terzi: You mean over 115? Yes, yes. Yeah, I mean, just look at the category, you know. Like, you have Devon, you have Levan, you have Ermes, you have Jerry, you have Morozo, you have Gennady, you have Denis Siplenko, you have Revas, you have Laletin, you have Dzharanov. I'm sure I'm still missing some, but, I mean, it's like a nightmare. I can comfortably say that there has been
Engin Terzi: no time in the history of armwrestling these two categories 105 and super heavyweight like has been even close to this level about the competition level usually it were 75 80 uh maybe 90 kilograms but yeah yeah everyone was that sundries
Engin Terzi: Everyone is getting bigger. Yeah, it's not only getting bigger, but there are so many guys, you know, just think about 105. I mean, like so many guys, so many guys. Five years ago, all those guys were like 80, 90. So now they got bigger, they all 105. Yeah, I mean, listen, I don't think it explains because five years ago and five years before that time,
Engin Terzi: guys also were growing that that and being 105 as well but what i'm just saying that there has never been this level of competition everyone is growing 10 years ago level almost 100 kilo probably you know so okay anyway so let's let's go to the fia versus uh ekatarina nikishova let's start with ibrahim ibrahim nikishova uh
Ibragim Sagov: To be honest, I don't know much about women's arm wrestling. I don't watch it, to be honest. Before, it was Irina Makeeva. I was interested in watching her victories. I don't know, but I'll probably put Nikisheva on the list. For ours, of course.
Ivan Matyushenko: Ibragim says he doesn't usually follow... Female armresting?
Ivan Matyushenko: Yes, but he used to watch Makeeva some years earlier, but usually he doesn't know much. Still, now he would bet on Nikisheva just because from our team, but he's not familiar with this course. Okay, and Sandris, you for sure know them? Yeah. People with them at the WAF so many years together.
Sandris Šedis: Yeah, I know Fia very well. I've seen Niki Sheva as well. But I think Fia has been on the rise lately. He's gotten much stronger training with Giannis. So I would favor Fia in this one. Okay, I see. And then the cool boy versus Leonidas.
Sandris Šedis: Sandris, I'm sure you have an opinion about this one. We will ask to Ibragim as well, but... Yeah, I think schoolboy. Because, like, Leonidas, he's not really, like, a full-time armistler. Like, on the other hand... Super strong guy. Super strong guy, but maybe his left arm is better. I don't know. But...
Engin Terzi: Yeah, schoolboy, he's not really schoolboy anymore. He's a college boy. College boy or school boss or something. But the question is, you pull against Larry Wills. One of those matches, one match, one round, he kind of gives you some trouble.
Sandris Šedis: no i i let him let him in there you know it wasn't i don't know you let him but it looks like you let him to the pin pad you know maybe maybe maybe not you know but uh yeah i think i think uh school boy is uh more experienced uh he's uh he gets more leverage so i think it will be quite easy match for for school board yeah
Ivan Matyushenko: I'm talking, sorry. With Kulboy, Leonidas, Arkona, Ibragim, do you know such guys? I know Kulboy, I saw him in the video, yes. But I don't know another guy. Leonidas, he fought Valera recently. I don't remember his name. Or no, no, or I... No, no, no, I confused. He fought Larry Wilson, he won Larry Wilson, yes.
Ibragim Sagov: I don't know. I haven't watched the video of the schoolboy. Ibragim doesn't know. He just saw a couple of videos with the schoolboy and that's it. Okay, so let's go to the next one. Arsene, Liliev, Brandon, Arsessor. Ibragim. Arsene vs. Brandon. I think it's Arsene.
Ibragim Sagov: I still know what I think, Vanya. If Arsene comes back in his former form, we probably won't be able to say hello to everyone, including our fans. This is definitely a legend. I have always looked with joy and admiration at his fights. I think if he comes back in this form, it will be an explosion.
Ivan Matyushenko: 105, 115, I don't know. Only you will stop him. I will be glad to fight with him. And I will be glad that he gained this form. I would like to see the old legend in action, so to speak. Ibragim is looking forward to Arsene's competition. Do you think he will win?
Ivan Matyushenko: Yes, he thinks he will definitely win. And also he thinks that if Arsene gets his previous form, he would beat most of the guys in 105kg and 115kg category. And he would like Arsene to get that form again. Yeah, but he said that most of the guys, right?
Engin Terzi: Yes. Okay. So probably the ones that he cannot beat, one of them is Ibragim, right? Maybe, maybe. Okay. Sandesh, what do you think about this one? Brendan Ancestor versus Sarsen? Do you believe that after 11 years, this guy, like, where can he be? Where can his endurance be for a super match?
Sandris Šedis: I agree. I think Arsene should win this match against Brandon. And if he's fast as before, he doesn't really need endurance, I don't think. But yeah, I agree with what they said. If Arsene comes back to previous shape, it's going to be very hard for most guys at 105 kilos.
Engin Terzi: So, yeah, looking forward to that and how that goes. But I favor Arsene. You favor Arsene? Yes. Okay, let's go to Michael Todd versus Frank Lamparelli. Ibragim. Michael Todd versus Frank Lamparelli. I think it's Michael Todd.
Ivan Matyushenko: Ibragim thinks that Michael is the favorite. Also, he remembers Michael saying about spending 100,000 dollars for
Ivan Matyushenko: uh stem cells so he thinks he would win okay
Sandris Šedis: I think Michael should win this match. He has the best endurance. And also against the press, he's not that good on a defense. So I think Michael should be favorite in this one. And I think Michael will take the victory. But I will not be surprised if Lamparelli can take some rounds at the beginning.
Ibragim Sagov: Okay, let's go. Davit Samushia versus Nur Dalet Aydar Khan, Ibragim. Davit and Nur Dalet, yes. Davit Samushia, Nur Dalet Aydar Khan. Here I think that Samushia will end the era.
Ivan Matyushenko: I think Nurdaulet will win and stop the winning strike. He respects Davit, but he thinks Nurdaulet is stronger.
Sandris Šedis: that's that's that's that's interesting this guy won just seven world titles in a row incredible and what do you think sandris i think uh that nordolet can win like first a couple rounds but uh like samushia we have seen before like always always finds a way
Sandris Šedis: to beat his opponents in the end. Sometimes at the beginning he struggles a little bit. I think it might go this time as well. Nordola taking first, maybe second round and then Samushia taking over again. Ibragim, last three matches. One is Ermes vs. Ali Canmurado.
Ibragim Sagov: Yes, Vanya. Left hand. Left hand. Left. Well, I don't know. Ermes on the left, how he fought, I haven't even seen it before, to be honest. And Alizhan on the left, it's like a gun, right? I don't know, maybe Alizhan will kill him. I think he's dry.
Ibragim Sagov: If the right one, then it is undeniably Gasparini won. Well, in my opinion, yes. On the left, I think that Olezhan... Olezhan will win only you, in my opinion. I think you... You are overestimating me today. No, no, no, I'm serious. Well, you have the left one... There has always been better luck on the right.
Ivan Matyushenko: You know, he fights in the side movement as well. There will be a very beautiful fight. I think you will beat him. If... Well, thank you. Well, I don't know. I think so. Thank you. I don't really believe in myself. Well, I think I will fight, but to win, I don't know. Okay, Alizhan. He thinks Alizhan is the favorite. And he didn't see Gasparini's left hand.
Ivan Matyushenko: And he thinks Rezhan is one of the best. And he would like to see my match against him. Yeah, it will happen. It will happen. Yep, maybe end of this year. It's now after Morozov. Yeah, end of this year. Maybe November.
Ivan Matyushenko: Maybe it depends on Morozov and how the fight goes.
Engin Terzi: I mean, you cannot hold the title when there is a challenger, you know. You need to accept. No, but I have to have my hand healthy, yes. I understand, but your match with Morozov is in June, beginning of June. I talk about November, which is five months, you know.
Engin Terzi: Yes, but it depends on how it goes, right? And I have maybe to win, Morozov. It doesn't matter. Yes, it doesn't matter. I mean, I think even if you win, it needs to be 115 kilo title. Yeah, it's more realistic. Then later, maybe you guys can pull again if you both are holding the title, you know. But what do you think, Sandris, about this match?
Sandris Šedis: Yeah, I also agree with the favor. We saw Ermes pull Morozov on left arm. That didn't go so well. But he was after the match, so maybe that was an issue. Morozov also had a match. Same night. But just the thing is, just remember, Morozov went outside, you know, first.
Engin Terzi: and then Morozov rise, rise and beat him. I'm not sure if Ali Can can go outside in a fresh round against. Who knows? He's definitely going inside hook with a drag and I don't know. I think Ali Can can win this one. Ali Can you think win? Yeah.
Engin Terzi: Okay, okay, last two matches. Georgi Tsvetkov, Alex Kurdecha. Ibragim. Georgi Tsvetkov, Alex Kurdecha, yes. To the right? To the right, yes. To the right. Ibragim, Ibragim. You are pulling east versus west. You don't know other matches, which arm? What did you say?
Ivan Matyushenko: I don't understand either. Which arm? We do not understand. No, what I understand is that he is pulling in the same card, same event, but he doesn't know about the other matches, which is his right arm or left arm. Engel is laughing that you are also fighting in this card, but you don't know whether to fight left or right.
Ibragim Sagov: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Ibragim Sagov: I just haven't seen this Alex for a long time. Where did he fight on the right? I don't remember when was the last time he fought on the right. He fought for a long time, with Krasimir, with Angerbaev. I don't know which one he is fighting now. He won Gasparini a couple of years ago, if I'm not mistaken, top to top, by the way. It was a long time ago. I don't know what formula to use.
Ivan Matyushenko: He didn't see Gurdjieff pulling for several years and he doesn't know his form now. He thinks it's 50-50. He cannot predict here. I also think it's a 50-50 match.
Sandris Šedis: Both guys in the past didn't have the best endurance. It's not enough to predict. Tsvetkov is getting better. Alex is getting better. The fight with Morozov was awesome. I don't know. Can't pick a winner. Okay. Then let's go to where the trouble starts. Ibragim. Ibragim.
Ibragim Sagov: Devon Levan Saginashvili vs. Devon Larratt. I think the first two rounds will be easy for Devon.
Ibragim Sagov: In the third round, I think if they catch Larratt from there, I don't even know how it's called. I think, purely by endurance, yes. He can take Larratt in the round. But will Levan win the fight? I don't think so. Levan will win. Probably with a score of 3-1.
Ivan Matyushenko: He thinks that in first rounds, Levan would win with ease. But maybe in later rounds, he will have a chance to stop Levan with a kind of king's move. He said, no, you say, open arm top rope. Levan, I don't know in what form it is. Levan in what form, I don't know either. He even had a trauma.
Ivan Matyushenko: If Levan is in his previous shape, it would be 4-0. But now he thinks that maybe Larratt would take one round.
Engin Terzi: No, not more. So it will be 4-1. Yes, he thinks 4-1. So if this match ends after one of them winning four rounds, if they don't go full rounds, it means that Devon needs to win one round before the last round. So is it possible Devon to win one round when
Engin Terzi: Devon didn't reach to four rounds winning and then even Devon wins one round and Devon still comes back and wins his fourth rounds. Do you understand my point? You mean that is it possible for Devon to win the match if he is stopped in the first rounds? No, no, what I'm just saying that he said 4-1.
Engin Terzi: If it is the match is 4-1, one round, if they don't go full six rounds, it means that it is not 4-0. It is 4-1. So Devon needs to win one of the rounds before Devon wins four times so that it can be 4-1. Do you understand what I'm saying? Yeah. So is it possible match to be 3-1? It means that Devon one time stopped him and beat him.
Ivan Matyushenko: And Levan still come back and win the another round. Do you think it's possible if Devon wins after the third round in the fourth round? After that, will there be a chance, will Levan still have a chance to win the next round? No, if he wins once, as you say, Engin, as I understand it, will take the hand.
Ivan Matyushenko: I think that Ozil won't be able to continue. In this case, if he wins one round, he will win the fight. Yes, I think so. Yes, I agree with you. If Larod wins one round, he will win the match.
Engin Terzi: Okay, so because you understand my my point. Yeah, it is before the 4 0, you know, because if you stop it,
Engin Terzi: But it may go differently if it's on fouls, you know, if he stops butch. Yeah, but he cannot know if the match is going to be with fouls. When he says he's going to win one round, he actually meant the physical winning. How can you guess something when he's going to win one round on fouls or something? It's hard to guess such things. And what do you think, Sandris?
Sandris Šedis: I think that Levan probably is going to win the match, but I think it's going to be much closer than the first one. So I don't think Devon can quite win a round, but I think he's going to be able to stop Levan in the first round, second round, maybe even third round to stop him somewhere. But then Levan just with a second surge, I think he can finish.
Engin Terzi: But I would love nothing more than Devon to win this match. So you are basically saying that even round one, Devon is going to stop him. But after stopped, Devon will win. And if Devon stops someone in round one, and then he's stopping him round two, it must be a little bit tougher match if he already stopped on round one. And then round three, he again stops him.
Engin Terzi: And then Levan still wins in the round four. He stops him. So, Devon stops Levan all four rounds and then Levan continues winning. This is what you are saying. Not like completely stop him, but like maybe one centimeter of the pin pad and then Levan with the second surge can finish. Something like that. I would love Levan to win, but it's going to be very hard. Okay. I understand. I understand. Okay. Aymergit here. Hello, everyone.
Engin Terzi: I'm very interested to fight Sandris vs. Ibragim. Start will be the key. Anyways, guys, I thank you guys very much. Sandris, do you have any message? This guy from Ingushetia, right, Ibragim? Ingushetia, yeah.
Engin Terzi: No, not much. Just keep training, you know, and I'm coming. So if you are beating him 3-0, which is easy, do you still suggest him to train? I mean, does he need to train? I mean, even if he trains, it's 3-0 easy. Maybe he should just relax. Maybe you tell him you suggest him that. What else he has to try, you know?
Ibragim Sagov: Oh, he has to try. Okay, you don't want to take this from him, yeah. Okay.
Ivan Matyushenko: They joke that you need to train well, see you, see you, fight, and then they talk to Engin, why train if 3-0 is still easy. What was about Ingushetia?
Ivan Matyushenko: About Ingushetia, he just said that you are from Ingushetia. He introduced you as an athlete from Ingushetia. Do you have any questions for the opponent? A question? Engin asked Sandris if there is anything to say to the opponent, but apparently he is the same for you. Did Sandris ask something?
Ibragim Sagov: No, nothing. He just wants to train well. Well, I wish him good luck, of course, as an opponent. I will respect him. At the table, after all, I behave differently. I'm a little more aggressive. I don't know. Well, it's not to say that I don't like my opponents. I underestimated someone. Well, I don't respect him. So, I wish him good luck too. To all the opponents.
Ivan Matyushenko: Ibragim just wishes everyone good luck but before that as a joke he said that he would do something bad to someone but it was a joke
Ivan Matyushenko: Just... I cannot translate it. It's difficult to translate. All in all, he wishes good luck. He says that he respects his opponent, but on the table he will be aggressive, but that doesn't mean that he does not respect his opponent. That's just the way he pulls. And he wishes everyone good luck. To his opponent and to everyone else.
Engin Terzi: And did, when he pulled against Tatashins, and then Tatashins, he shaved his head and he shines, did it affect his concentration? Because Sandris has the same condition. Engen is joking, when you fought with that Hutchins, and his bald head was shining, didn't it break your mood? Because Sandris is going to do the same.
Engin Terzi: so he will use sunglasses okay uh ibrahim thank you very much brother and sandras thank you very very much for coming and being my guest and get ready even once again thank you very much my friends
Engin Terzi: Yeah, you're welcome, you're welcome. Thank you, thank you. Vanya, thank you too, bro. Take care. It was an interesting conversation. No, no, this doesn't show, you need to show. He is trying to intimidate you. Devon't be intimidated.
