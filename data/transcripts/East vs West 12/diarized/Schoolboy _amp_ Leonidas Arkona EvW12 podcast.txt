Engin Terzi: I don't even know which match to start the events, you know, because all of them are incredible. I mean, we know the main events, but school boy, I think he doesn't speak English, but his brother will come and his brother will be translating, uh, for, for us. Um,
Host: In four minutes, they will be with us. Yeah, it's very, very interesting match for sure. Hello, hello.
Engin Terzi: How are you Leonidas? Hello Engin, how are you? Good, good, good. Leonidas, is it possible to use the phone sideways? Yeah, so you will have bigger screen. Yeah. So how was Japan? Good? Did you enjoy? Amazing. Japan was for me actually the best
Engin Terzi: the most uh the nicest guys i've ever met in my life it was a great time there really really amazing people yeah tons of good food you know yeah yes yes i really loved it um i have a question for you how to pronounce your name correctly leonidas or leonidas or how is it in in english it's leonidas
Engin Terzi: But in German, Leonidas. You can say it either way. You can say Leonidas, Leonidas, whatever you want. So if I say Leonidas, it's correct. Okay. It's correct. Yes. Okay. Okay. That's good. Yeah. Yeah. I am also waiting for you guys to visit me and do some training. We are willing to. We are planning it.
Engin Terzi: have to do it yeah after after this april event yeah um i think i will have my own gym you know uh and then yeah at that time it would be great yeah i was talking about you that you how many times did you come to east versus west to watch at least three four times right at least
Engin Terzi: I think three times right now. Three times, yeah. Every time I saw you, like you were doing some side table training, and every time I see you improving more and more and more. At the beginning, you look very amateur. At the beginning, you were like a bodybuilder. And later, then you started to give in some travel to the really high level pullers. It was after, but still.
Engin Terzi: And then whenever you pull and beat Larry Wills, then looks like it was the beginning of your arm wrestling career. This is my opinion, you know.
Leonidas Arkona: Engin, I promise you the next time that you will see me at the table, it will be completely different. I promise you 100% because I trained a lot with, I have a coach right now since three months. Who is that? Kevin Wolf, you know him? Yeah, the referee guy, yeah, yeah.
Leonidas Arkona: and we had a lot table time the last three months and we practiced a lot really a lot like three times a week table practice um and this is this is something different right now so you are taking more seriously
Leonidas Arkona: yes yes definitely um it was it was a it was hard for me to learn all of these new movements and that's why it looked so so strange but i think i'm getting closer to feeling confident at the table yes yes yes you see before before you pull larry wills larry wills uh
Engin Terzi: gave a very hard time to Sandris. You know Sandris? Oh yes, of course. And then I heard that he is also giving trouble to Derek Simit. And I saw some practice pulls against John Burzing. So Larry Wield was not the same Larry Wield who used to live in Dubai. So he was in another level and you were able to beat him. I see that your arm
Engin Terzi: you still don't have, maybe because your arms are so big, but still don't have that close angle. But even that little bit open compared to the regular arm masters,
Engin Terzi: there is an incredible resistance there, like incredible, like the arm strength there. And I kind of think that like schoolboy, no disrespect to you, but as of now, better arm master, because he's from the childhood he's pulling. But I kind of think that you are the stronger one. And if he cannot take your wrist, if somehow it goes to the bicep power, and I saw that your endurance was also very good as well in Dubai.
Leonidas Arkona: i think it will be a hard match once you can stop him in your your position do you agree with that or so so what i say 100 and uh i give you my thoughts about that first of all i know schoolboy is very strong schoolboy is one hell of a strong arm wrestler for me right now and that's why i picked him i think this is going to be
Leonidas Arkona: really interesting for me because I want to climb up the ladder. I just, after Larry, in my opinion, Skubo is the next opponent that is a worthy and possible opponent for me. And I think he is the, at this point, he might be a little bit better with all of his techniques, for sure. I agree with it 100%. But
Leonidas Arkona: just like i told you i really trained that we were working hard on on the technique and all of those angles getting those angles tight and i promise you the next time that i will be at the table it's going to be a different version of me because like you said i always do i go a little bit i i give i give a lot this was the
Leonidas Arkona: the part where I felt the best and very confident. But we were working on getting those angles really tight. And my strength, of course, is the endurance and the biceps. This is one thing that I'm ahead of schoolboy. For sure. But of course, he has his strength features. And yeah, this can be interesting. How do you feel your hand and wrist?
Engin Terzi: It's getting better. Definitely it's getting better. So I'm curious, I'm curious where the match will go. But the guy is not the school boy anymore. We still call him school boy. But the guy is now adult and he's huge. You know, he's very tall, very big guy. Starts getting school bus.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, he's becoming incredible. Hello, Alex. Do you hear us? You know Schoolboy's brother, right? Alex, yeah. Of course, Alex. How are you doing, my friend? Probably there is a sound problem maybe. Or maybe he's trying to help his brothers too.
Engin Terzi: Do you hear us, Alex? Anyway, so let's continue talking about it. Yeah, it will be... What's your weight, Leo? Right now, 123, 24, something like that. Yeah, 23, yeah.
Leonidas Arkona: And your shape is better, huh? Compared to the last match, the Larry Wills match. Oh, way better. I made a big mistake the last time. I gained too much weight and this was not good because I had no endurance that time. But right now, I'm feeling good. There's a lot of endurance right now.
Engin Terzi: Your endurance was already better than Larry's that day because every round he got gassed out. But normally Larry is not known by his endurance. But yeah, every round was easier and easier as far as I remember. I was there as well. Yeah. Yeah. You know, I do a lot of cardio right now. It's pretty good. Yeah. And yeah, school boys here as well. Can you guys hear me at all?
Leonidas Arkona: yeah we hear you do you hear us hey alex hello hello hello hello hey guys oh yeah how you been good to see you good to see you guys everything's fine over there yeah how good how good
Engin Terzi: Yeah, they are far away from each other. If you look at the world map that way, but if you look at this way, probably they are nearer to each other. Yeah, we're on the opposite sides of the planet, basically. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Anyway, so how is everything? I should call him schoolboy, right? Yeah, it's okay. Not Alexsandr. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: Okay, you can call him Sasho. Sasho. Yeah. Common common name for Alexsandr, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So how is he doing? Like, how is his shape? Right now?
Engin Terzi: Looks like we won't hear a lot of words from him. Alexsandr, how do you see this match? You have trained with Leo before, but it has been a long time. I'm sure you got also bigger and stronger. But how did you see, how did you find Leo's shape against Larry Wheels?
Alex: Sasho, what do you think will happen in this match? What are your predictions? And how do you feel about his match with Larry Wilson? His match with Larry didn't surprise me at all. My prediction is a dry victory. The match with Larry didn't surprise me at all. And I think I will win for sure. You think he will win for sure?
Leonidas Arkona: Yeah, that's his prediction. He's confident. Anything to say, Leo? He's sure that he's going to beat you. Should he be? Yeah, what I can say is he's strong. Of course he's strong and he seems very confident, but so do I. Yeah, that's good. That's good. 100% sure.
Engin Terzi: I would like to ask Alexsandr another thing. Alexsandr, there is nothing to concern about Leo's abilities because you are so confident. Is it because you know where to go or it doesn't matter where the match goes? Sanya, why are you so confident? Are you confident about how the match will go?
Alexsandr Beziazykov: i don't see any vector any movement he's stronger than me and i have also my experience so even by step to bicep no problem for him no problem
Speaker: Ha ha ha.
Leonidas Arkona: does he know what he's talking about or he's just still so young so funny so funny but i think he got some good strength features i think his press is definitely better and i think he got a really good side pressure but dude what are you talking about i will crush your biceps you know that my biceps is way stronger anything else okay this goes out to you i give it to you
Engin Terzi: Do you think that he is brave enough to start with you inside round one or he's just like trying to intimidate you? Are you asking me or him? Yeah, I'm asking you. Yeah, I'm asking Leo. Do you think that he can, he's like, you said he's confident about everything, like confident enough to go inside round one or you think he's just trying to intimidate? I mean, Engin, you don't know yet if I am going inside in the first round, so...
Engin Terzi: no no maybe he will try to top roll you but like maybe would he intentionally go there that's what i'm saying so um i don't know i don't know yet okay because he said he's very confident can you ask him like is he like that confident to just go boom inside round one
Alexsandr Beziazykov: Well, of course not. Why would I go into such a rough fight? I'll carefully open his finger, his wrist, in the first round. And then we'll see. It feels like the way I feel my hand, the way I'm going to work. But I think the first round will be the top. First round, we'll start just normal. And I'll try to tackle him, open his hands, fingers. And from there, we'll go.
Alex: Maybe in different directions. Okay, so he's not that confident. Okay, I understand. He doesn't want to waste too much energy in the first round. So there is a risk. Sanya, is there a risk? Why don't you want to start in the hook in the first round? No, there are no risks. I just want to start from the top. Because if you fight in the hook first, then you can't get to the top. I want to win in all techniques and start from the top.
Alex: Okay, he's saying if I won't go top roll first round, I maybe get gassed out in a hook and won't be able to top roll him later on. I want to beat him in all movements. Top roll, hook. Okay, so he's saying he may get gassed out. He may not beat him four rounds in a row if he goes inside. He won't be able to top roll him in the later rounds. But he can still beat him in hook, right?
Engin Terzi: Yeah, but he wants to beat him in all movements. All movements, yeah. Like to topple him, to hook him. So what he is saying is that if he goes inside, it will be so tough that he may gas out.
Engin Terzi: not get stalled but won't be able to perform top roll properly in the later rounds so so it means that if you're getting a lot of pronation other like muscles yeah but so he means that he will be tough so that he will be tough enough that he won't be able to top roll the next round because i mean if it was easy then he wouldn't be like i mean you know anyway so i i try to understand that that's what i am asking yeah it looks like i'm giving a hard time but he looks so confident so i wanted to see where the
Leonidas Arkona: limit of his confidence so Leo do you have anything to say what did you understand from the school boys answers oh first of all I have to say that thanks for all of the tips for the upcoming match thanks for all the hints I can work with right now so I'm not going to say anything what I will do
Leonidas Arkona: just let yourself give yourself some good surprise on match day I'm not going to say how I will start but um so if he wants sure we can start in the hook in the first round is if he's confident enough for my biceps that would be no problem for me yeah but I understand go ahead go ahead Alex
Alex: Alex, can you ask him about his endurance?
Engin Terzi: We'll see, but not in this match. In this match, I'm not supposed to get hurt. Okay, okay. I will remind you later. Okay. Alex, can you ask him, like, he is very confident, is that because, like,
Alexsandr Beziazykov: He's very, very good, or he doesn't take Leonidas seriously. Sanya, why are you so confident in yourself? Because you're so good, or because Leonidas is good enough for you? I'm confident because, yes, I'm good. In fact, Leonidas, it's hard to say his shape. I don't fully understand what shape he can be in. But I'm very confident in myself. Like this.
Alex: Okay, I'm not really sure how good he is. He might be really good, but I'm just confident in my abilities right now.
Engin Terzi: So how much did he progress since last time we saw him at the King of the Table against Khalid? Khalid match, I will say my opinion, no disrespect to Khalid, but I think Skoolboy was better. I wouldn't really allow it like this. Khalid would lose on fouls.
Engin Terzi: but it is yeah yeah yeah but how how much you can translate what i said but how much progress since then okay i think maybe about 40 percent oh do you think he's trying to intimidate you
Leonidas Arkona: leo 20 is that possible yeah i think that's not possible i think he's trying to a little bit intimidate me but i guess he is stronger and uh i saw his latest video and i wrote him yesterday i saw his latest video um of his training footage which was really impressive
Leonidas Arkona: but what was this what was it i i saw some big numbers benching and curling and all of that stuff and uh it was good it was it was definitely very strong but um i'm also very confident that's good that's good that's great yeah and another question alex where does he see himself alexander like does he see himself finally
Engin Terzi: somewhere near to top 10 like or is not yet in the super what but first of all what is his weight right now uh 125 kilos 125 so they are you both are in almost same weight huh you said 123 leo yes yeah okay and how tall are you leo 182 183 and he is like what 195 maybe 195 yeah
Engin Terzi: 195. Okay. Yeah. Can you ask him, like, I'm curious, like, will we see him anytime soon competing against the top players as well? Does he have such plan?
Engin Terzi: Sanya, do you have any plans to make it to the top 10 or are you going to avoid it?
Alexsandr Beziazykov: My plan and my belief is within two years to beat all the popular and out of top 10 guys.
Engin Terzi: then try to get to the top 10 guys maybe in two years in two years he will start pulling the top 10 guys or he will beat all the top 10 guys he will switch to the oh okay so two years he will pull and two years later he will he will go that direction
Engin Terzi: yeah yeah okay okay i understand yes yeah really good guys but not out of top 10 probably super high weights yeah okay okay and where does he see himself right now does he see himself like 20 top 20 top 25 like does he see any of those those pullers it doesn't have to be top 10 but competing like can he tell us names that i am at this guy's level i am better than him he's he thinks that he's confident against beating
Alex: Leo, but Leo is probably ready to ruin his dreams, right, Leo? I guess that's true. Yes, that's good. I have a question for Sasho. Sanya, do you have an example of this level? Top 20, top 30, top 50? Or what is the level of a person, a wrestler, today? It's hard to say, but I would probably compare myself to Rin today.
Alex: it's really hard to say right now to gauge but i think i don't follow from uh reno message okay okay
Engin Terzi: Yeah, okay. So we can talk about and you Leonidas, you say that next time we see you, every time we see you from now, we will be seeing more and more dangerous Leonidas. And where is your plan? Like, what is it? Like, do you plan to become just like, maybe not full time armwrestler, but
Leonidas Arkona: so um let me tell you like that as i told you i had a preparation right now for i guess three months and we were working on everything like like everything everything basic to to get this whole thing into my head and to learn all of those new movements for me and i'm still learning so it's a progress right now
Leonidas Arkona: which means at this point right now it's just getting better so um it takes time it takes time and i want to be better i want to get some stronger opponents and that's why it's a progress you know it's a progress i'm getting better so yeah i cannot say that i will be at this point or at that point in one or two years because this is not the way
Leonidas Arkona: I am. I just say, let's see what the time does and I'm getting better. And that's for sure. You just want to progress, progress and progress. Yeah, of course. I want to progress and I want to get better and I want to climb up the ladder and yes, that's my plan. Yeah. So every time you come to Istanbul and you did that after push, the improvement that you saw, it helps your confidence, correct?
Engin Terzi: Of course, yeah. Sure. Yeah, because I saw that. I saw that every time you come to Istanbul, you pull. Especially the last time you came, you were surprisingly strong. Because you were pulling some of the top guys. They were not in your category, but they were not so far either. Yeah.
Leonidas Arkona: And you should not forget one thing, that all of those last times when I pulled other guys, I didn't have this good feeling on the table. It was just pure strength. I just hold them with pure strength. But imagine what's going to happen if I combine this strength with technique. So this is the thing that I'm willing to train for right now. I'm getting better and...
Engin Terzi: get a better technique of course getting stronger and yeah this is my plan right now once you have the hand control then then then with the power i think i think you are very very strong very strong i don't exactly know all your lifts and everything but i see that your bicep everything very strong yeah anyway so we will see one second i give you a sneak peek i give you a sneak peek um you know what i did in the devon pronation lift last time no
Leonidas Arkona: guess what don't tell me 60 kilo or something no more more than that i i will send you the video 67 67 yes did you share anywhere uh i did it on instagram in my story and i tagged devin and devin wrote to me it's even harder than how i do it wow okay so somebody somebody is in trouble alexander did you hear that alexander are you in trouble alexander
Alex: yeah i'm impressed
Leonidas Arkona: But you know, Engin, this doesn't matter too much to me because in the last matches I was focusing too much about numbers and about beating those records. And what I learned in the last preparation is that those numbers don't always make the match. Yeah. You know, and so it's just a number. Yeah, but once you can...
Engin Terzi: create coordination with all those muscle groups then then it makes so much difference yeah tell him did to hear this number did it affect his confidence a little or not at all science
Alexsandr Beziazykov: Okay, not at all, because I think without a strong wrist flexor, you won't be able to actually execute and perform the strong pronation you have.
Engin Terzi: and strong wrist is really important in the hook too so yeah yeah to control the pronator yeah is that uh ivan matushenko told me that you know his wrist exercise you know to test he told me that schoolboy did that heavier than ivan matushenko and lalatin does he remember the numbers but he said that he was schoolboy's wrist was stronger than and even he's known
Engin Terzi: 99 kilos almost what's that 99 kilos almost 98.8 okay he did and how was he once does he remember 93 or 94. okay and does school boy think that it translates to table as it is on the weight
Alex: Sanya, what do you think about this test that we did with Ivan Matyshenko, where you beat the record? Does it translate into the fight for the table? 100%. 100% it translates. 100% it said? Yeah. Okay. Okay. Smart guy, so he knows in which vectors to test pullers, so to get the overall information of every movement.
Alex: i also think it translates for sure especially this static power like when you have to move just initial first millimeter or 20 yeah i mean if you know how to arm wrestle if you know how to arm wrestle reps but just one rep just to move it a similar system is like bulgarian guys train right they try to move one weight like really heavy like small movement like one inch maybe
Engin Terzi: If you know how to arm wrestle, then of course you're going to translate as much as possible. That would be like arm wrestling initially. And then if you improve those numbers, you will get better. I think Leonidas will have...
Alex: very bright feature in armwrestling because i don't think that he still translated all his power yeah for sure yeah yeah but i personal opinion is a problem of guys like leonidas larry schoolboy um okay they're not really like super heavyweights like they're like 120 130 range and how you can compete with someone like levan who is 180 or
Engin Terzi: some other guys like george it's for corpus once i mean in many in many supports the the category is even lower than 150 we have at the east versus west many in many sports and after 95 or 100 kilo they say it's super heavy but it's really like beside that that is why the guy is just super heavyweight champion and then you want to beat him then you beat him you don't beat him maybe you try to lose weight or something you know whatever yeah if they have a little bit they'll be like
Engin Terzi: Yeah, let's talk about the card a little bit. Leo, do you have anything to add to the things that Schoolboy said? What is your summary? You know, he's confident, he thinks he's gonna beat you and
Leonidas Arkona: I'm looking forward, Engin, for a really good match. And I respect him as an armwrestler and as a sportsman. And I'm really looking forward for a great match. And that's what I can say. That's my summary. And how was your first match? How was your first match against Larry? One second, Alex. How were you, like you do as support, which is, how can we call, like powerlifter, can we call you?
Engin Terzi: I don't know. I do a lot of bodybuilding. It's still like not physical combat sport. You don't really get into physical...
Engin Terzi: But you pull leather wheels and how did you feel like when you are competing psychologically compared to the weightlifting or bodybuilding? How did you feel? Was it like you were strong enough to control your emotions or you were just too excited?
Leonidas Arkona: um actually i felt very confident both times the second time of course it was a little bit more um more of a luck game for me because i didn't even prepare for the second match for the right-handed match against larry but why burst match why uh because i felt too confident to be honest so
Leonidas Arkona: I pulled him with the left in Germany and that was really easy for me. So I felt like, okay, it cannot be that hard to pull him with the right. And of course, I think this was a little bit my mistake in this match because then he was stronger than I expected. But I was feeling pretty confident both of the times, to be honest.
Leonidas Arkona: okay so psychologically you are okay right now you're gonna pull school boy and mentally you are ready for that battle oh sure that's what i'm training for i'm i mean like uh i'm not afraid and i'm i'm really willing to uh look forward for this match so there's nothing that scares me i mean if i would have to pull ivan okay this is going to be something different but no no i'm looking forward and yeah
Engin Terzi: Yeah. Okay. Okay. And this will be school boys second match at the East versus West. He pulled Herman Stevens, right? Yeah. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And you were there, right? The first time when they pulled. Me? Yeah. No, no, I didn't. I wasn't there. Okay. Okay. So you don't remember which three times you came. I remember one was the Dennis match, right?
Leonidas Arkona: No, no, no. I came the match with Gennady and Devon. Yeah. Then I was there at the match when, I don't know yet. Baba, your first time was in 2022. I don't think it was last year. First time when you came, I think you came in, were you there when Prudnik match happened?
Engin Terzi: yes yes okay so that was your first time probably yes that was my first time i think yeah these two times i've been at east versus west okay so let's let's start with the predictions and if if you are not familiar with the guys don't worry you can say that you don't have any opinion but um turker mehmedan what do they think about devon versus levan match
Engin Terzi: My friends, soon we will come there. Soon we will come there. It's the end of the podcast, it will be. Okay. Alexsandr, do you know Nugo Chikadze and Petro Marharint? Tanya, do you know Nugo Chikadze, a Georgi who won the World Cup in 100kg in Krasimir, and Petro Marharint from Odessa, from Ukraine?
Engin Terzi: I only know Petro. He only knows Petro? Okay. And you, Leo? Are you familiar with these guys? I'm sorry, Engin. I don't know both of them. I'm sorry for the athletes. My mistake. No, no, no. Everything is okay, my friend. That's why we organized East vs. West, because next time you will be familiar with them. All right. And Brandon Ellsessor vs. Stoyan Golemanov.
Alex: If you guys know, you know, if you don't know, we can pass. You can ask. Yeah, okay, go ahead. I think Stoyan wrist and tableau may be too much for Brandon, but if much goes long, Brandon can outlast him with his...
Alex: side, hook, whatever he has in his arsenal. He's very versatile and he can hold on and he has good endurance. But if Stoyan will be really efficient and fast on the goal, he will probably top of him this time. But I pulled them both. Stoyan wrist is terrible. Okay. Betkili Oniani, Talgat Aktaev. Alexsandr, do you know them? Betkili Oniani, Talgat Aktaev. No?
Engin Terzi: And you have Pulwaf as well, right? Anyways, and you Leonidas? No, probably. I don't know. Okay, this one probably you guys will know. Let's start with Alexsandr. Tobias Sporrong versus Kamil Jablonski. I think Tobias. You think Tobias? Why? I don't know. I don't know. Say it in Russian, I'll translate it for you. Why do you think so?
Alex: Yeah, I just think Tobias because I pulled his Kamil, but it was long ago, of course. I think Tobias. Where did he pull Kamil? Two years ago in Poland.
Alex: Oh, when he went to train there, right? Not to train, he had different reasons, but he stopped by to train with Alex, Kamil and other guys from Poland. And you, Leonidas?
Leonidas Arkona: So I think, of course, Tobias is insanely strong and super fast at the start. I really like him as an arm wrestler. He has a great style and like the speed of him. So I guess, I think he's a little bit favor for me, but we should not underestimate Kamil because if he's able to stop the game after the start,
Leonidas Arkona: he might be dangerous if we think about the match when he pulled uh devin left-handed so very close but i go a little bit with tobias okay okay oh go ahead sorry i thought you finished yeah what you say most of the strongest press and probably one of the strongest tupper in the game
Engin Terzi: And as Devon said, it's a nightmare for a top-roll guy. I am not sure if Tobias is going to go top-roll. Did you see his last match with Wagner? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, he just went sideways, you know, yeah. Yeah, but I personally think Tobias is a favorite. Okay. Sandris versus Ibragim Sagov. Ibragim Sagov. Ibragim? Yeah, for sure. For sure? Okay.
Engin Terzi: Okay. Not everyone thinks that way. Do you know these guys? You know Sandris? I know Sandris. I don't know the other guys. Ibragim Sagov is, I think, four times AMC champion with the shoulder pressure. He had a very good match against Tad Hachings in 1-0-2. The guy with the beard. He had a long match with Tad Hachings, but Tad won. 3-2, but two rounds and Ibragim won was on fouls. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: It's a tough match. I don't even know. I think it's Irakli. They fought, right? They fought a long time ago.
Alexsandr Beziazykov: Yes, but then it was another Irakli. I think Irakli will win. I think he will open the top, maybe Sasho will hold it a little without a brush, but Irakli will win. I think so. Irakli will win, he will probably topple him, and Sasho will try to hold it at the pad, and I think Irakli will beat him.
Alex: I understand. Maybe Pasha will stop him probably, but overall Irakli probably will be the winner. They pulled long time ago and I think Irakli progressed so much from that time. Even back then he was able to take first round. Yeah, yeah, yeah. This is your opinion, right? The last part. The last part, the last part. Yeah, yeah, I understand. And you Leonidas, you know, are you familiar with these guys?
Leonidas Arkona: yes yes I know them I'm not too familiar with um Sasho I saw a couple of matches of him and I all I know is that he's really strong but for sure I know Iraqi and I saw a lot of matches and I think in my opinion in this matchup he might be the favorite I think he is
Engin Terzi: He might be a little bit too strong. His top role might be too strong. That's what I think. I understand. Okay, let's go to the next one. Alexsandr, Fia Raizek versus Ekaterina Nikisheva. Ekaterina Nikisheva, for sure. For sure. Once the athlete is from Russia, for sure he's winning. For country, man. The cool boy is winning.
Engin Terzi: Sagov winning, Ekaterina winning. Do we have another one here? 100%. Okay. Yeah, 100% she's going to win. Yeah. Did you know that this is left arm, Lewa? No difference, huh? Okay. And Leonidas, you are probably not familiar.
Leonidas Arkona: not at all hanging i cannot tell you who's going to make i don't know them probably probably the better looking one just kidding i don't know that i cannot i cannot give a prediction about that okay and then you alex what do you think i think you can turn in but it's really close much fear is probably stronger overall like physically but if you're in a forum
Alex: probably more better like top roll more efficient one so it's really the battle like physique and technique in my opinion okay uh here probably a little bit bigger because i know she's struggling with the weight she's like 64 65 so it's still like disadvantage when you pull in 70 kilo cap okay this one this one i only ask for percentage i don't want detail just percentage
Alex: Cool boy versus Leonidas. Okay, I would say not being mean and disrespectful. So I'll be nice and I'll say 60-40 towards me.
Leonidas Arkona: Oh, 60-40 only. Okay, I was expecting him to say 100 or something. Okay, so okay. And Leo? Actually, I wanted to say the same, but right now I cannot because he already said it. I think, well, I think it's close. It's close.
Engin Terzi: It will not give you any percentage numbers. I just say it's close. It's close. Okay. So you are coming to Istanbul with the faith that you're going to beat this guy? Yeah. I'm willing to, of course. Okay. That's good. That's good. That's good. Because people usually, like whenever I am doing this podcast, when I ask them, they see you underdog. They see him as favorites.
Leonidas Arkona: And so I'm glad that you are not intimidated with that perception and you are coming there to win. It's good. As an organizer, that's great. No, I can tell you what. For me, it's an opportunity to get better. Of course, I'm the underdog, and that's what I like about the match.
Leonidas Arkona: see if i would lose everybody would say okay we saw that coming but what's going to happen if i was too cool if you win so what what's going to happen so you see then then i can i can choose the next opponent a little bit higher and of course then the people will say again he's going to lose but what's going to happen if i win again you know that's my my my um my plan yeah
Leonidas Arkona: Yeah, you have nothing to lose. You have to choose opponents who are really good. I don't want to have opponents where everybody says, yeah, he's going to win this match. He's weak and all of that stuff because I want to get better. I understand. Yeah, I understand. You want to do something which people think that you cannot do it. True. Yeah. Okay, that's good.
Alexsandr Beziazykov: Let's go to another Russian guy. Artur Makarov vs. Mindaugus Tarasaitis. He's going to fit. For sure, Artur. Is that Alexsandr? No. Not this time? No? I know Mindaugus, and I would say 50-50. I know Mindaugus. Or it will be a dry victory from Makarov.
Alex: Either there will be a fight, and I think if they get hooked, Mindaugus will win. Or Makarov will win quickly. There are two scenarios. Either Makarov is pinning three or four times in a row, or if the match is stopped, then Mindaugus will be favorable.
Engin Terzi: I agree. Because Artur is incredibly strong, but he doesn't have good control. He doesn't have good control. Not controlling much of his fingers and wrists, basically, yeah. And Mindo is really perfect for blocking, you know, with the low hand.
Engin Terzi: So he's saying that 50% chance Artur is going to dominate, and a 50% chance Mindaugus is going to stop and win. So we can say. It's in Mindaugus' favor. If Artur will be able to flash pin, then yeah, 4-0. And you, Leo, are you familiar with these guys? No, I don't know them. I don't know both of them.
Engin Terzi: One of them is Minda Tarasaitis. The whole community will be offended that you don't know him because he is the god.
Engin Terzi: I have to say one. I know him, but I haven't seen... He's the GOAT. He's not a regular guy. He's here, and then come John Brzenk. There is a joke in the community that everyone calls him GOAT, and he doesn't get upset about it. He says that, you know, yeah, I'm just a regular GOAT. I get it. Yes, so I know him, but I haven't seen a lot of matches from him.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, he had an incredible match against Daniel Prokopchuk in the last event. Yes, yes, I remember that. I remember that one. It's really a really good match. Yeah, incredible. Yeah, yeah. Both guys are incredible. And that was his day. Okay, Michael Todd versus Frank Lamparelli. We are coming to last four matches. Schoolboy. Michael Todd versus Frank Lamparelli.
Alexsandr Beziazykov: I don't know how Michael Todd has recovered, judging by the video on the Internet, he is in good shape. I think Michael Todd should win, otherwise it will be sad for him.
Alex: okay i'm not really sure how he recovered from his bicep injury but there are some like videos of him training and lifting big weights so he's supposed to be the favorite and if he's losing this much it's not looking good for him that's my prediction and your opinion alex uh i think michael he looks pretty good against pablo and it was like
Alex: two months almost ago, so he's even more recovered, more shaped, more picked. I mean, Frank is also a very good tackle and he'll probably take the risk of Michael. Then Michael will guest him out, trying to find the way. The biggest problem is to finish Michael. That's the biggest problem.
Alex: That's the problem. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And this is probably the last match they have in Italy, like 10, 12 years ago. It was a war. Yeah. Yeah. Long match. Yeah. Both were probably smaller and weaker than they are right now. Right? Yeah. I mean, Michael is better right now. Yeah. And Leonidas, do you know Frank Lamparelli? Yes. Yes. Yes. I think Michael is going to win. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: Do you expect a war or do you expect domination? How heavily do you favor Michael? I think it's going to be close, but I think Michael is going to end up as a winner. Maybe 3-2. Oh, okay. So you expect a close match? Yeah, I think so. Or 3-2, something like that.
Engin Terzi: Did you know that they pulled, like, almost 16 years ago? No, I didn't know that. It was 3-2, Michael won. Really? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, so, okay. Davit Samushia versus Nurdaulet Aidarkhan. Davit Samushia, it turns out. He doesn't lose, does he?
Alex: He doesn't lose, and I don't see any reason to lose to him this time. He's supposed to be Samushia. He's never losing, basically. Supposed to be again. He's supposed to be the winner. What does he think about Samushia? What do you think about Samushia? He's a champion. Champ. Strong.
Alexsandr Beziazykov: Is it amazing that he won seven world title matches in a row? It's amazing that he defended the title seven times in a row. Yes, yes. But I didn't see him in a competitive position. He was top of the top in this category. He had good opponents, but in my opinion, not the best in this category. And this time, I don't think he's the strongest in this category.
Alex: okay i believe he's not really was getting the best best 85 kilo guys all these times so i mean it's amazing he he uh defeats uh defends the title all six seven times in a row but i think he didn't like the really really best guys all the time so
Engin Terzi: I think if Haji Murad will get down to 85, he will take it. What's that? My personal opinion, if Haji Murad will get to 85 kilos, he will take it. But Haji Murad didn't win the AMC, you know, he was just like... Or Engin Terzi. Oh, Engin Terzi. Engin Terzi is an old man, you know.
Engin Terzi: Anyway, so I think the only guy left right now, we have Aydar Khan. And then if Sarmat comes, then Sarmat versus whoever wins will be a good match. But in my opinion, it's really 50-50. I think Aydar Khan can surprise us. He's really young.
Engin Terzi: fast, explosive, he's progressing every time you saw him. He used to be 75 kilo champ, right? He's now 85 and he's still growing. I think he... He used to be 55 kilo champion. Yeah. Aydar Khan won WAF 55, 60, and then 70 he took second to Cherkasov. And then he took 75 kilo world title and 80 kilo world title.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, he won all of them. Looks like he's going to the Levan level. He's going up. Yeah, I think we'll see the version of Nur Dalet this time. Yeah, we'll see. Anyway, so, okay. Leonidas, this is very exciting. Alex Kurdecha versus Georgi Tsvetkov. You were there when Georgi pulled Devon. And by no means it was an easy match.
Leonidas Arkona: very hard to say very hard to say for me i think a little bit favor for me is alex cordeja if i have to say a percentage i might say 60 40 for alex
Leonidas Arkona: But why? What is your reasoning? Not that I'm questioning, but just I try to understand what you think about this. If I think about Alex, I have this match in my mind when he pulled Morozov and he really surprised me with his strength. So I just...
Leonidas Arkona: I just shook the hand from Georgi when we were at the East versus West and felt very, very good. But I think Alex, it's just a feeling. I think Alex might be the favorite a little bit for me in this match. I think he's a little bit, yeah, I think he's a little bit stronger.
Leonidas Arkona: I might be wrong, but yes, it's going to be, it's tough, it's close, but it might be just, I might be wrong, but this is what I think. Yeah. Another question, so quick. Are you going to mess with this guy at the press conference? Who? Schoolboy. Dude, I'm not that douchebag.
Engin Terzi: but but you're gonna you're gonna you're gonna mess with him a little bit right yeah anyway so and and what do you think alexander georgie versus alex your future opponents okay your future opponents yeah hard to say alex on the right for a while
Alexsandr Beziazykov: What was that? It's hard to say Alex didn't compete on the right for a while. Yeah, for a while, yes. But I think that Alex won't have enough hands, in my opinion. If he wins it in the top or in the hook, I'll be very surprised.
Alexsandr Beziazykov: Okay, my opinion is it will be really hard to control the wrist of Georgi. I don't think Alex has enough of wrist to really tackle him or get him in the hook.
Alex: So I think it's going to be hard match for Alex. And what did you think? I didn't see anyone toppling. Georgi, like pure topple with controlling the wrist and his pronator, yeah. Okay. So you are saying that Georgi has the edge while Leo is saying that Kurdecha has the edge.
Engin Terzi: jeremy browning engine you should do a how-to video of what exercises to do for new people who want to get into arm wrestling my friend if i had time i would do this i would do anything that you could imagine about arm wrestling but i even don't have time to train myself but that's his plan also do you agree that devon is people's champion devon is
Engin Terzi: champion of many people and also i think a lot of people also dislike him as well that is why he is super famous because nobody ignores him they either love him or hate him you know this how it looks um jeff thank you again for you all you're welcome and thank you for your support and superboy what schoolboy thinks on dennis rank now in prime shape
Engin Terzi: Okay. We have last two matches to predict. And then after that, I will ask this. Ermes Gasparini versus Ali Canmurado. Leonidas, are you familiar with this guy? Did you see his match with Prudnik?
Leonidas Arkona: yes what do you think about this guy one of my favorite matches uh this time to be honest i'm very excited i'm very excited about it and very very hard to say as well again they pull left right yes hey right wouldn't make so much sense in my opinion so
Leonidas Arkona: ermis is a friend ermis is a good friend of mine so i don't want to say that he's going to lose because i really understood we understood i like you so much but i think um i hope because he's a friend i hope ermis is going to win for sure 50 50.
Engin Terzi: Okay, you are saying that my mind is saying 60-40 Ali Can, and then your heart is saying 60-40, or no, 100% for Ermes, and when you balance it, it's 50-50. Yes.
Leonidas Arkona: Just say it like that. Ermes told me that his left arm is right now not at the right arm level, but very close. Really? Okay. Forget everything I said. Ermes is going to make the match. No, I didn't know that because I pulled him right and left and in the past, of course, his right was dominant, very dominant compared with his left. But, you know,
Leonidas Arkona: that was like one year ago and okay i think um aramis is a little bit favor i think like 60 40. very tough match it's going to be a tough match for him but 60 40 for aramis in my opinion and alexander monster
Alexsandr Beziazykov: on the left hand. I see Ermes' fight, which he could have done, it's up, but Alizhan starts very strongly, and I didn't see him open his wrist to the left, even when he was 80 kg. So I think Alizhan will go into the hook without any problems, and I don't see Ermes doing anything to him in the hooks at all.
Alexsandr Beziazykov: 100% Alizhan's victory, in my opinion. It will be another mismatch.
Alex: okay i personally believe alijan is freaking amazing super strong dude and i don't see anyone top roll him like top rolling him fully open his wrist so he fast he's so uh he's so good at getting too much inside cooking people and i don't see ermas doing anything in the hook to alijan in my opinion it's it's a mismatch
Engin Terzi: Alexsandr, have you ever seen Orijan pulling against someone who is as good top roller as Ermes until now? Maybe not as good as Ermes, but very close to him.
Alexsandr Beziazykov: Tell me, I've seen a lot of matches where he even fought in the absolute with a weight of 80 kg, with heavy weights, and there were a lot of good fighters, I don't remember them all now. Maybe he didn't even fight Dzeran?
Engin Terzi: i don't remember everyone but i saw some videos of him pulling in the overalls at 80 kilo class while being 80 kilo and he was winning basically everyone cooking everyone no one was able yeah he was probably 90 kilo i remember i think it was like lotoshino or something i think yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah but i mean do you think that like desire no technically and speed hand control is famous like
Engin Terzi: hermes because i remember i think i think i must be i must be deserving of it i think or something like even when he was like 85 90 kilo 86 or 95 kilo i don't remember uh with left arm i have i have the mesh you know so now we're talking about 130 kilo hermes
Alex: yeah i'm just discussing with you guys not like not to disagree or something you know yeah a little bit of a different opinion i believe ermus probably has one of the strongest tuples for sure you remember he beat morozov
Alex: while being in the war with Dave Chaffee not long ago. He didn't beat Morozov, but at the beginning, one round... No, he opened his wrist all the time while he was fresh. First round, maybe even second round. First round, yeah. I think Morozov has pretty good wrist control on the left. Yeah. I mean, he was about...
Alexsandr Beziazykov: How many times on the left? Okay, I personally believe Alizhan is even stronger than Morozov.
Alex: in terms of like match rankings, everything. And I personally was disappointed when I didn't see Ermes, like not even winning, but giving much to Morozov. So I think it's just like Morozov, Ermes, Alizhan.
Engin Terzi: Okay, I understand. I mean, the problem is not always about the power, but the problem is to enabling the risk, you understand? If they go power to power, I have no doubt that, I mean, Ali Can is stronger. Okay, let's go. The last one. Probably the biggest match in the history. Leonidas. Levan Levan Saginashvili versus Devon Larratt. You know what I'm going to say, Engin? You know... Just one second.
Leonidas Arkona: Who is talking now? Leonidas' heart or mind? Both. Both and one. So, okay. Let me start like, if Leonidas' mind is talking, I might say this might be a close match this time because...
Leonidas Arkona: my opinion devin master of what he's doing he knows exactly what he's going to do and um of course he learned from the last match and i think that he's not going to do the same i talked to him a little bit to figure out what his plan is and in my opinion my mind says also this is going to be a close match but if devin is going to get his plan through then
Leonidas Arkona: He has the chance to beat him.
Leonidas Arkona: My heart, of course, says 100% Devon. But I think also this is going to be a tough match. And this time, first of all, I hope, because he also is a friend of mine, I hope he is going to win. Because also this would be something very special. Because Levan is the superior in armwrestling. There is no one as strong as Levan. In the lifts and on the table, Levan is the number one.
Leonidas Arkona: But if there comes up someone that's going to prove something different, wow. It just gives me goosebumps. I think Devon. Devon is going to win. Do you think that he improved a lot in the last two years, since the last match? Devon? You mean Devon? Yeah, yeah.
Leonidas Arkona: um i don't think that the steps are so much going up i mean like uh the level that dev devon is training and um at the level that devon is is not so much more space to come up but i think he has
Leonidas Arkona: he made little adjustments in his training which allow him to do new things at the table. And that's why I think he's very clever. He's insanely clever at the table. So he's tricky. It's tricky to pull him. So I think Devon is going to beat him this time. I understand. Yeah, I mean, since the last time,
Engin Terzi: the guys that he has defeated. He just shows that he's at another level is my opinion, you know? Yeah. And you are saying that Devon is gonna win this time. Okay. That's okay. And Alexsandr,
Alexsandr Beziazykov: If Devon tries his best to beat Devon, if there are long exhibitions, if there are disputes with the judges, fouls, breaks, tie, if everything is pulled out as much as possible and he doesn't get injured in the first rounds, as in the last armfight, trying to hold him, to stop him,
Alexsandr Beziazykov: then I think that Larratt has a chance to catch Levan in the third or fourth round and maybe win. But this is the only option that I see. Again, Levan's wrist was injured, we don't know how she will feel. But if we look at the truth, then 70%, of course, maybe even 80% I bet on Levan.
Alex: okay uh i i see this scenario then if devon will use all the opportunities and time given to tire levan out with his
Alex: referee whatever shenegans maybe if in the first two rounds if he will guess him out and not and won't get injured like the last time he did i think he can pull off something in the third round and fourth round and initially like win but uh my like honest prediction would be like 70 80 percent towards uh levan so he thinks that levan is gonna win 80 percent
Engin Terzi: I don't know who will root for Levan. It's Davit vs. Goliath.
Alexsandr Beziazykov: I don't know who's going to root for Levan since it's a kind of Davit and Galeaf match. Usually the crowd roots for Davit. Does he think that someday he will beat Levan?
Engin Terzi: someday for sure for sure maybe it will be 10 or 20 or 30 years oh 30 years he will be like 60 you know listen listen as eng in tennessee if i was i had the genetics of you 195 this
Engin Terzi: I would for sure focus for the future, beating. If health will allow, Scuba will try to reach something. Yeah, I mean, if you are armwrestling, you should be just targeting by beating anyone on this earth. I mean, you are even targeting to beat... At least you have to try, yeah.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, anyways, so we will see. Anyways, you both think that you both want Devon to win. But as far as I understand, Leo says it's a very close match, but he still thinks Devon is going to win. While Schoolboy says that 70 or 80 percent, Devon is going to win. And lastly, your opinion, Alex?
Alex: Like if I would have to bet something on the line,
Alex: uh 60 40 percent towards levan we still gotta take it he's still younger he's bigger he's probably healthier overall like he has like more resources to progress so he might the stronger version of levan on april you know then it was two years ago but bevan for sure progress a lot and it makes things exciting that's for sure yeah okay and last two questions leonidas
Leonidas Arkona: Will we see you with left arm next event or right arm? It depends on the opponents. I mean, I can do both. Pretty equal right now. Right now, right is feeling a little bit better than the left because I focused on the right last time. But first left is my golden arm. Are you originally left-handed?
Engin Terzi: actually not and that's why it's so crazy i'm i'm right-handed but i feel a little bit more um coordinated on the table with the left one that's interesting yeah that's interesting and and school boy you had an injury i think bicep was bicep yeah and and and how how is it now is it coming back
Alex: Yeah, very slow, still painful. It's really hard to do any full range of motion. It still really hurts right here, where it was attached. What's that? I think maybe if everything will be good, next year we'll pull Leonidas left-handed.
Engin Terzi: Oh, okay. Okay. So he's basically saying that he will ask for revenge after he loses Leonidas with right hand. I'm just joking. Anyways, guys, thank you very, very much. It was an honor to host you guys. Thank you. Leonidas, see you in two weeks. And I'm also waiting for you and your team to come for training. I can also share, you know, because we would like you to...
Engin Terzi: become more and more and more successful in arm wrestling because you are already a very famous person who is bringing attention to our sport and thank you for that and Alex and Alexsandr you guys after the event at least coming for a day to my home we train a little bit right together that's good that's good yeah so you all take care of yourself and see you in two weeks
