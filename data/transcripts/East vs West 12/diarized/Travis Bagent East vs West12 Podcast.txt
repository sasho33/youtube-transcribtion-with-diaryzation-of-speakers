Engin Terzi: Hello, guys. How are you all doing? Travis will join us in a little bit more than 10 minutes.
Engin Terzi: Oh, a lot of chat here. Hello, NK . Hello, Stacey.
Engin Terzi: Hello, Engin Turbo. Hello, Adnan. Hello, Ivan Kozich. Hello. Jb19. Big event. Yes, it's coming. Very soon. 17 days. Hello.
Engin Terzi: Mr. Sigurd, maybe I train maybe once every four days, five days. Hello, governor. Hello, Leo. Hello, guys.
Engin Terzi: Let me make sure Travis comes so that it wouldn't be like his supermatch with Travis. I mean, Ermes.
Engin Terzi: How much did I pay to Travis? I pay him nothing. Of course, I pay him for the commentating, but not for podcast. Travis and Oleg's love child, sorry, Tolz and Oleg's love child, thank you for your support. Oh, Travis, when will we see you at the table at East versus West? You asked this question too early, but I will try to remember when he comes.
Engin Terzi: The guy is just really annoying guy. And I'm not talking behind him. I told him the same thing, you know. I asked him, are you available for the podcast? And he's like, when do you need me? And I said, whenever you want. And no more answer. And then two days, three days, probably it has been like 10 days to get an answer from him. Finally, I...
Engin Terzi: I told him that, okay, nevermind. And so finally today he said, podcast today, are you ignoring me again? He says, and like, I didn't even check the message yet. So he's just, he thinks that he's doing some payback in his mind, you know, but that's not the case. Whenever I write him, him to answer,
Engin Terzi: Like sometimes a day. And then once he answers, we cannot finalize it. He says something and he disappears again. So when he comes to Istanbul, I will ask about all this. Of course, we are just joking. Travis is a good friend of mine.
Engin Terzi: Hello, Sabah. Thank you, guys. Thank you. Thank you. Yes, for sure, I'm working hard, but we are doing this all together. So... Yeah. Okay. Let's ask a question so finally we can settle about this. That is the...
Engin Terzi: most important question right now in the world. And guess what I'm going to ask you guys. It will not be so hard to know what I'm going to ask about, right? It's the most serious, most
Engin Terzi: Okay, I'm starting. One, two, three. John Bersink, 70%? Come on, come on. Even John Bersink himself would vote for Ming Dago Tarasaitis. You guys are out of your mind, you know.
Engin Terzi: Of course, Andreev. Of course, it's Mindaugus. The other guys are new guys that are voting for John Brzezinski. 70% Brzezinski, come on.
Engin Terzi: Yes, East vs. West Challenger Series is great. But in August, then you will see something different. You will see a dream team there. Who said Minda vs. God? Are you joking me?
Engin Terzi: I'm very disappointed. 100 people watched and 71 for John Bozing. Dream team, I'm not going to tell you, but just imagine that all the top guys from North America
Engin Terzi: Come on, Travis. You don't want to see me angry.
Engin Terzi: No, no, no. Dream Team for the Team West I talk about. Team West. Devon't make me say the names already.
Engin Terzi: Aleykum salam. Yeah, yeah, you're right. Todd Paul Hutchings, you're right. Probably he's watching. He's just the most annoying guy, you know. He would intentionally do that. He's that type of guy. Yeah, he would just watch and wait till the last minute and then if possible even a few minutes late.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, I know Travis. And I know what he has done to me in 2005 Vegas. He brought their magicians to take my power. That's what he told me at least.
Engin Terzi: One thing about Travis, he is not fake. I mean, he doesn't always tell what he feels, but it's not because he's fake, but he likes to play games, so he came here. Vertical. Like that?
Travis Bagent: No, yeah, okay, yeah. Oh, man, I can't even do it like that. Hold up here. I like your T-shirt. I knew you would, boss. I knew you would, boss. Are you kidding me? And as you can tell, I'm jacked, too. Yeah, wow, what a bicep. As you can clearly see that I'm probably ready. How big is it? I'm probably ready. Is it 15 inches?
Engin Terzi: Let's see how big this shirt is, first of all. Can you see? Small or medium? 5X. This is LeBron's shit. Uh-huh. Wow. What we got? Yeah, I mean, I just wanted to have a chat with you, talk about life, family, business, you know, these kind of things, you know. I like it. I like it. With the last part, right? The business part. Ooh!
Engin Terzi: Yeah. Are you still training? I am. Yeah. Yeah. I feel good. I think, uh, yeah, I think I'm almost ready. Yeah. Is it, is it like those, those, how do you call those, uh, things that happen in the towns? Like fair? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm better. I'm better. I'm in, um, United States national shape.
Engin Terzi: Oh, national level right now? U.S. national. U.S. national level. Okay. Not like county fair anymore. No, no, no. I'll kill them guys. I'll kill them. Congratulations. Congratulations. You are incredible.
Travis Bagent: and that motherfucker no more. I'm done. No more? No more? Oh. No more counting. They won't let me in the county fair right now. I better sit a little bit more carefully in front of you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Put some respect. Put some respect on my name real quick. I'll eat up. I'll eat up the county fair circuit. Yeah, yeah. You have an event in Chicago again? I saw some posters. Yeah, so I'm RMS on Saturday at East First West qualifier.
Travis Bagent: Are you serious? No. Yeah. Yeah. It's a Saturday, April 6th, James Reed, Dave Morocco. We're at the harvest gap. Um, you will try to be qualified for resources. Yeah, I will. Well, I'm a win. Yeah. I'm going to win that. Then I'm going to then, uh, two weeks, what is it? Two weeks later.
Travis Bagent: April 28th, is that the final? 27th, yeah, the Florida, yeah. I'll be in Deltona, so I'm going to win that. I'm going to win that loot real quick. Then I'm arm wrestling. No, then, no, no, no, no, no. Then I'm going to see you on the 20th. And then I go to Deltona. And then the week after that, I'm in Chicago.
Engin Terzi: Yeah. Okay. But I mean, you normally couldn't get direct invitation. So finally you realize this is why you are trying to be qualified for resources. I just think I probably got, I could probably get qualification if I wanted, but I'm going to grab that easy money down in Florida real quick. But what, what, what if someone strong comes and kicks your ass?
Travis Bagent: Listen, I feel, as you can tell by my only part of my two shoulders being in the screen, that I am a little different right now. And I feel very confident against the Chance Shawls and Brad Grundys of the world right now. Brad Grundy would beat the hell out of you right now. Did you not see that? He beat...
Travis Bagent: Okay, come, come, come. You would beat him. You would beat him. Okay, I'm sorry. Hey, I like Brian Grundy. Yeah. He's got a great future. He's got a great future. Great future. Yeah, yeah. Okay, so...
Travis Bagent: The question, how many people in North America right now could beat you, left or right? Let's say three. Three left-handed and probably six left-handed. Cody, Corey, and Devon, right? Okay. And how close are you to them? Yeah, I mean, I could. There's a very...
Travis Bagent: There's a 50-50 chance that I would kill those guys right today. Oh, okay. Just right now with an aggressive attitude and one of them looking at me sideways, I could probably. But the problem is, is the format. Is that beating these guys four or five times ain't that easy.
Travis Bagent: It's not, listen, I don't even know how easy it would be for me to beat those guys at any time in my career if it's four times and the reffing allows there for this to take 20 minutes per set up.
Travis Bagent: You know what I mean? Now, don't get me wrong. There were times early left-handed where my hand was so good that you really couldn't fuck with it. You know how it is. You hear people saying, man, he was climbing, he was climbing. Well, there's a lot of people that have tried to climb in my hand, and I just shut it down completely. Can I ask you something quickly? Devon't forget what you're going to say.
Travis Bagent: Devon't you think that there was a point that your right arm was ahead of your left? Yes, yes, yes. But I don't expect anyone to know that except for me. And maybe you could be, there may be three other people capable of noticing or realizing that.
Travis Bagent: um but yeah that is the truth yeah but it was because it was because right hand arm wrestling is what it is yeah so the the day that you beat dave chaffee was it the same day that you also beat devon left arm in the overalls no devin was in the 220s that day no no no but in overalls we didn't have the overall that day when we did pull the overall that was atlantic city three three tournaments earlier
Travis Bagent: So it could have been eight months earlier. Oh, okay. Or more. It could have been a whole year. Because, you know, the Atlantic City one was like the first one that changed like it was fall, fall. Then it went fall, fall. And instead of going fall again, they switched to spring very quickly. Yeah, yeah. And then it went spring, spring, spring.
Engin Terzi: But that whole... I didn't follow all those. In those years, I was a little bit apart. But was it the same day that you also beat Jerry when you beat Dave Sheffy? Yeah. Yeah. And I also won left-handed that day, but it was Ryan, SB, and those guys, the heavyweight guys. Hmm. Okay. So do you think that that shape of you, that beat Jerry and Dave, may be the best ever shape of Travis or...
Travis Bagent: Yeah, I mean, that was one of the good ones. There was no doubt that was a good one. My left and right arm when I pulled Pushkar and Vovoda, although neither one of them were at the best they were, but I'm just telling you that I could beat those guys after the tournament in ways that I normally was not really my forte.
Travis Bagent: And then I'll tell you this, in 2004 at the GNC Show of Strength, when I beat Dave Randall, right after that, I beat Dave Randall and Matt Gerdner at the practice table. And I'm not joking, and I'm telling you that these guys are starting the way that they want. You still beat them? And Dave Randall is going like,
Travis Bagent: that and i'm sitting here and i'm just like oh and dave said man you are different and for matt girdner that day who was that was the one step before he became matt girdner the baddest matt girdner he ever was for that two-year span and it wasn't even close like any position
Travis Bagent: So, you know, times like that, you know, you can get through a tournament and you've probably been there where I can win a tournament and not even know how strong I am that day. Because, you know, you were lucky enough to go through it. And then the guys that were supposed to be your competition, you ended up, they ended up in some other hurdles or whatever happened. But when you're after the tournament and you're allowing guys to get the grip they want, especially strong guys,
Travis Bagent: Like when you in 2003, if you let Ron Bass get the grip he wanted on a practice table and start, it wasn't easy to beat a guy like him. But there were times like that day where I could beat Ron without like moving my shoulders. So, you know, that's, you know, sometimes it's fun, stuff like that. But yeah, maybe that day in Vegas might have been the strongest ever.
Travis Bagent: And the question is that the hammer, the wild hammer, are you the one that won with left arm the last time? Every time. Yes. Every single time. There was never, ever another left-handed champion. Devon decided to go down in the 220 class. And then when he then came up to the right-handed class,
Travis Bagent: and started pulling the one-on-one once the WL switched, got rid of left-handed tournament arm wrestling, and went to right-handed supermatch format. He brought both his hammers from the 220 and decided that they were the hammers, the legacy hammer, I think he says, that he gave away left-handed, which ain't his. They gave away. Okay, the question is, do you also have the right-hand hammer? How many?
Engin Terzi: Two. And left arm? Five. All five years. So all of them are super heavyweight? Yeah, every one of them. So the hammer... And, and, and...
Travis Bagent: a couple overalls. We didn't do the overalls every time, but you know, I was in charge of those events. So every time we would do something, I'd be like, listen, we gotta find something, you know, like what you're doing constantly trying to make the next event good. So sometimes we would have an overall, sometimes we wouldn't, it all depends on, you know, what we needed to make the tournament as, uh, as, you know, watchable as possible. Okay. So what you are saying is that the, the, the,
Travis Bagent: Legacy hammer that Devon calls is actually 225 hammer, while yours is super heavyweight. Yeah, right. And just because he took that, now he was able right-handed to unify those hammers. So when he gave that to LeVon, that seems pretty legit to me. But any left-handed trophy he gave to Dennis is a complete fraud.
Engin Terzi: I understand, but originally it was a 225 hammer.
Travis Bagent: Yeah, it's the only one he could ever have access to. Yeah, there is no, yeah, there was never a situation. Where are your hammers? Do you have your hammers with you? I don't. I have two of them. I have, they're both at the gym and they're like door stoppers. Whenever I want to bring stuff in, I open the doors, but they're awesome. Like I love them, but one of them is in my father's casket. And then one of them is in, I think, Paul Italia has one in California.
Travis Bagent: and um jesse gilliland has one in um in alabama you sold them no they're just my buddies you know they're good dudes so really because knowing you there was a potential yeah i know but i don't if i thought they were worth anything i would yeah
Travis Bagent: So let's talk about the upcoming card. Did you have any chance to look at the matches? I have looked at a lot of them. And the fact is, I can't, no one can, you know, for me, the Devon-LeVon match is so spectacular that you forget about the other matches. But if you just look at the other matches, they're fucking amazing too. So, yeah, you're going to set some records, I think.
Travis Bagent: I think the most people are going to, you know, I mean, I don't know, since I've been alive, this is exciting that I've ever, you know, experienced. Like, if I wasn't there live, I would buy it.
Travis Bagent: And I'd be waiting for when the motherfucker started. And that in itself is awkward. You know what I mean? Like that means that the juice is on. And you should be, I'm sure you're fucking worried. But you also should be super excited. I mean, yeah, it's an incredible event. You know, we will see. Because I'm organizing, I am not in the position of enjoying so much. But time to time I do. But my mind is always...
Engin Terzi: you know, to solve the problems if there is anything, you understand? So there's a responsibility. John Hutchison, Travis looks huge. What a beast. What's your weight? Oh, I'm probably touching that 290 mark right now. Are you serious? Oh, I'm heavy. Yeah, I'm heavy, yeah. When you get older, you become fatter, right? Yeah, but actually, like, I probably, you know, look the best, too, without my shirt on.
Travis Bagent: right now that I haven't, you know, don't get me wrong. I'm almost 50 years old. So, you know, I looked, you know, like I wasn't like I was never going to be a swim suit model my whole life. But there have been times in my life where I felt better
Travis Bagent: about taking my shirt off at the beach. And now I probably feel as good as I've felt in a few years. So it's all good. When I'm like 260, when I'm like 260 right there, but when you think I'm 260, but I'm really 290, that's when I feel like I'm the strongest. Yeah, yeah, I understand, yeah.
Engin Terzi: I don't know. Your arms look big, but not at your best. I remember during the pandemic, you were going to go Australia for something. Remember? It was canceled or something. Yeah. At that time, I asked you, you show your bicep that look big, you know. Yeah, yeah. There have been times, too. But you know what's really crazy is the bicep training, it kind of gets me in trouble when it comes to my hand, wrist, and back. So I really tried my best.
Travis Bagent: I can't get all up in here where I want to be. And so I feel pretty good about how thick the bottom of my hand and wrist is and how girthy everything is, which makes you think maybe my bicep ain't that big. But I don't know. I would rip you up right now if you tried to even move. You'd be like, damn, Trav. Like, I am still one.
Engin Terzi: all against you so you have a guy that i can pull first match of this event just uh do you really want really one do you really want whoa whoa relax i'm trying to ask you a question man let me get everything out man no i i can't find you like we have some guys like turkish guys if you want just somebody that might be around that can take a beating right there just to start two out of three
Engin Terzi: Boom, boom. I can, I can, I can, I can set you. You could make just a little bit extra money. Yeah. Yeah. What do you get now? 500, another 500, a thousand. Hey, I don't, 500 is too much. 500 is too much. You are a fair guy. You're a fair guy. You know that you deserve 300. Okay. I don't want to do that to you, man. You've been too good to me, boss. You've been too good to me. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Engin Terzi: Anyway, so... What about Farid? I'll bounce Farid like I used to back in the day. Yeah, yeah. Okay, never mind. Anyway, so...
Engin Terzi: So what match are you looking? Of course, the Devon match. You've got to be looking forward to that. No, we're going to start from the beginning. But let's see. If you don't know the guys well enough, then we can go. But we finished already 16 minutes of the five-hour podcast. Let's go from the top. Let's go from the top. That way I don't mind skipping. No, no. Because I don't even want to talk about when there's two foreign guys. Unless one of them speaks broken English. The first one.
Engin Terzi: um alexander versus alexander ladies and gentlemen alexander looking super strong here today in istanbul um no go ahead what we got he is incredible okay do you remember petro marharin of course yes you remember from moldova event
Travis Bagent: Of course. What was your impression? Oh, it was amazing. Yeah. I mean, just, yeah. I mean, as soon as he came off the stage and John was like, dude, this guy is a rock and he is so, yeah. I mean, so professional, so calm, balanced, aggressive. Yeah. He's awesome. Yeah. Did you know that he's coming to this event? Yeah. I saw the flyer. Yeah. I saw that. Is that the first match?
Engin Terzi: Most likely, but I haven't decided. Maybe yes, maybe no. But his opponent is also very strong. At the last European, he top-rolled Krasimir and beat him. And so his opponent, Georgi, is unhookable, while Marharint is un-top-rollable. If you remember, he hooked Ravas in that event. Yeah.
Travis Bagent: Yeah, so I don't know, but probably you don't know his opponent. No, I didn't. And you know what, too? I'm going to get the phonetic spelling and I'm going to have my research dialed in. When I get there, I will have a very professional...
Engin Terzi: enough to uh to get that i have a question for you i have a question for you do you think that one day before like you can't arm muscle anymore you think you will meet devon again yeah probably i think so only because i believe that he leaves that left-handed door open
Engin Terzi: to travel around and do a lot of things. For example, if this August, Florida, East versus West, would you pull him? Just make sure that you answer, that the result of that answer will not be like Ermes.
Travis Bagent: Oh, man, I don't want to hear that. Stop trying to throw some shady peer pressure on me. You do this to all the people? This is the corrupt matchmaking that you do? No, no, except you, except you, everyone. You make people feel guilty? You make people feel guilty? No, because they keep their words.
Travis Bagent: Yeah, you guilt people in the masses and try to ruin their reputation. God damn. All right, so you tell me. Let's talk about it. Me and Devon are the main event in Florida in August. And how much are you paying to be? Is this public information or is it all private?
Travis Bagent: Are you telling me I'm the number two guy and I got to bow down to the king of the world and he gets two up? No, no, no. One second. One second. This is left arm. That one is not the king.
Engin Terzi: That's true. That is true. That is true. That match has some value that is representing that level, this level. Like maybe not the Devon versus Levan level, but that match is incredible.
Travis Bagent: Yeah, yeah. So, yeah, I don't know. I mean, listen, you give me whatever you're giving LeVon when you're done in Istanbul, and I'll pull Godzilla out in August.
Engin Terzi: That's got to be close. I don't know how to say that. Is LeVon a good business guy? I don't even know if LeVon's a good business guy. No, he is not. He just said, you pay me $3,000 and I'm going to pull it in. So that's how I said it. So you want as much as he wants, right? Oh, no, no, I'm out there. God damn, LeVon. No, what I do want to do is become... I would like to apply to be LeVon's agent, though.
Travis Bagent: so levon call me up man let me start negotiating these deals man this guy has this guy has a long what does it work i mean this is good i mean this is good tv right here what is the travis bajan devin match worth to the arm wrestling world and when i say the world i mean east first west because that's really you're the only you're the only product
Travis Bagent: Because I, you know, it's funny you say that because that's, you know, you're the third person that asked me about that. And I thought it was a joke. I don't think that you can pull Devon anywhere else in the world.
Engin Terzi: Yeah. Oh yeah. No, I'm just talking about people asking me just not, not promoters, just people saying you should pull Devon. You should pull Devon. Yeah. And I'm like, no, no, not the promoters, just the people. Yeah. Yeah. Because, because, because Devon said that he would, he would pull, uh, only at the East versus West or King of Table against you. Oh, really? Well, good. Okay.
Travis Bagent: I mean, that's good. That's very nice of him. Who do you want me to make the referee? So maybe... Oh, it doesn't matter. Yeah, it doesn't matter. You haven't gotten a referee yet that's done anything. You've let him cheat all your buddies. So fuck it. I know you're going to let him cheat me. The problem is I'm going to cheat too. So I don't give a fuck who it is. I don't care who it is. I'm going to have my hands straight up in the air. I ain't showing my thumb knuckle either. And I'm false starting too.
Travis Bagent: But we got to make it three out of five. We ain't pulling all that. Do you know what I will do in that match? I will ref that match. Oh, great. My track record with you reffing is real good. Out of nowhere, I don't even hear the go. I just get beat. Listen, Arsene Lille on that day would beat you when you try with two hands. Come on. You set me up, man. You set me up that day. Oh, yeah, yeah.
Travis Bagent: Anyway, so just think about it. We can talk. We can negotiate. Yeah, I think it sounds good to me. I mean, he looks so bad. He looks so bad. Oh, man. I definitely could have beat him in Vegas a couple weeks ago. Or whenever he lost to that guy. Because I can beat that guy. I can beat that guy. That guy that beat Devon.
Engin Terzi: Jablonski, I'm not sure about that one. Whoa. Whoa, whoa. I'm not even going to let my kids watch this show because of some of the things you said so far. Hey, just if you are talking seriously, that can happen, you know, but he has a match right now against Tobias. Oh, yeah, that guy's good, man.
Engin Terzi: Tobias is good. Yeah. Okay. Let's, let's, let's go here because we, we talk more than enough about your brand and assessor. Brandon. Yeah, this is a good one. I think that Brandon's going to become your new Paul in.
Travis Bagent: Oh, because he's now much bigger. Not only that, I mean, he's just one of them guys, just like Paul, just like John Brzenk. He's appropriate. He's fucking working as hard as he fucking can. And regardless whether you believe it or anybody else, he believes.
Travis Bagent: he is going to be the champ and the is working every minute at trying to be the champ now listen he is he is he could be hopefully that he's not reaching the whole time for for old boy because you know he could get just crushed with a bad angle top rolled out leveraged too long you know it could be bad for him but any awkwardness
Travis Bagent: that starts taking place and it becomes a little bit of a heart thing i'm telling you brandon's going to be tough and do you know of course yeah yeah yeah i mean we traveled yeah we traveled together years ago you know when it was only you know what i mean just he was it was he was always at the zloty he was always with involved with with igor yeah he was in the ape man i was over there when him and solaris pulled you know 20 years ago
Travis Bagent: 15 years ago, however long it was. So hopefully he's out of practice. But if he is hitting it, now he's probably bigger, thicker, more intelligent, and he was already good. So hopefully he's not too long for Brandon. But I think that Brandon, man, Brandon needs one win to get another match. Then he needs to do something spectacular in
Travis Bagent: the next match before you know it he's a staple every other thing and a guy that you know you're happy that's climbing because you know you need some american talent hey speaking of american talent you got to get you got to get chad stillers on the phone and get him to bring that hunter notes guy over there right yeah i mean he's killing everybody and listen i think this guy can get at a real low weight i you sure he's killing what's his ranking
Travis Bagent: I don't know, but he just went to the 170. He won the 154 round, Robin, beat every one of them last year. That's the worst, 154, no way. No, no, no. Chad's training partner, Hunter.
Travis Bagent: Hunter, you said, okay, you said Chaz Hill. Well, I'm just saying, Chaz is the guy. You have a relationship with Chaz. You called Chaz. No, no, I talked with Adam Wojcicki already, yeah. Oh, there you go. Yeah, because this guy, man, I think this guy can pull at 154, can pull at 165. He's a bad dude, especially if you don't set him up. He don't have to pull Daniel first match. Relax there. Let this man get a couple match thing in there. Do some...
Engin Terzi: Do some Gustamato Mike Tyson managing here for a change. Yeah, I understand. And do you know, you probably don't know, but Betti Leonidas, Talgat Aktaev, do you know them? No, I don't. Okay, let's go this one, you know, Kamil Jablonski and Tobias?
Travis Bagent: yeah yeah i mean listen i'm i'm i'm amazed that the when i look at i call him tobias but i guess tobias when i look at him as a part to what i get it's as drastic as some of the old john brzenk photos and situations the guys
Travis Bagent: Very, very regular looking guy with a stupid amount of skills. So I'll be, you know, it's one of them things that I know if you beat him, that you're a guy that's got a real chance. And if he beats you, I'm not surprised. How do you feel about the match? I'm an organizer, but I think that the center is very important in that match.
Travis Bagent: That's why I think that Kamil would beat the hell out of you, you know, because for a night and he would press you like this. Yeah, I know. But, man, guys that give the window of the awkward presser and they don't make it very difficult from an angle and leverage standpoint, I just don't understand it.
Travis Bagent: like i don't understand and i guess i have been a victim to the side pressure but man left-handed i've never been had to like right-handed i feel like if you keep pushing i will end up here but left-handed it's it doesn't end up out there it just stays here and then it's like there's
Travis Bagent: I don't know. I just feel like when I was able to shut Jerry down, I have that ability left-handed, that ability to tighten up and keep my elbow in the center of my chest at such a greater degree than I do right-handed. That left-handed, I've just never experienced in my lifetime a presser
Travis Bagent: hooker catching me at the 9, 10 o'clock because I was trying to pin him. But, you know, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe he could do it. So, interesting. Okay, let's go. Seems a little uncoordinated and awkward. And that's, you know, I might eat him up, too, again. I might eat him up. Listen, like, I can't wait you to come back to arm wrestling. I don't know if I should believe that or not, but
Engin Terzi: Do you know why you are so important? Because you are not only arm wrestling, yeah, and you are also polking. Do you know how you are? You are much more successful version of, what's the guy, Shail Sonnen, or Shail, what's the guy's name? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Now you got, you done said his name so fucked up, you got me, God, thinking it's wrong. Shail Sonnen.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, yeah, that guy, yeah. I think that you are that guy of arm wrestling, you know? Yeah. Oh, man, how blessed would you be if I was just raping these people, too? But listen, listen. When you are that strong... No one could stop me. No, when you are that strong, when you are that strong, you are not as intelligent as you are now. Ooh!
Engin Terzi: Did you hear what I said? Man, I would just be a pay-per-view juggernaut. I'd be like... Robert, did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said? Yeah, of course I heard. When you are that big, that strong, you are not as clear as you are now.
Travis Bagent: One or the other. You want the talent or the marketing savvy? Which one do you want? Maybe you can balance right now. You're almost 50 years old. Oh, man. Can you imagine if I got up there with one of them studs and just no chance for him? And then I just started telling the world, forget about it. Shut the show down. Ingen, get somebody else up here immediately. This guy has no chance.
Travis Bagent: Oh, the ratings, the ratings through the roof. All of a sudden, you're calling me every day. You're already calling me every day, and I ain't even put on a show yet. Oh, my God.
Engin Terzi: oh wait i don't call you every day i said would you like to be my guest on podcast and you are like when and i said whenever you are available and then two days two days no answer from you and i said so disrespectful
Travis Bagent: Here's another thing, too. I'm so disrespectful. Every device that I have, every one of my kids, my wife probably checks my Facebook 37 times a day.
Travis Bagent: No, you are answering me. You are answering me. Sometimes, but I think when you see me see it, you think that I was the one that saw it. That could have been any of the five people that have an iPad or the computer. It's all popped up. Just tell them, tell them, tell them to not do it. Right, well, I got to tell them who you are. I got to tell them to listen, man. I'm sorry.
Travis Bagent: Okay. Hey, you know what I need you to do? I need you to book the ticket. Oh, I thought you did. Cause I was going to do some, I wanted to do some fun stuff, but it's really not that easy scheduling wise to get to Amsterdam or whatever. So you know, the deal, you just bought a ticket and then let me know what the difference is. Yeah.
Travis Bagent: Yeah, I buy your ticket and plus $500. Okay. I mean, if you're going to give me a raise, I'm not going to say no. If you're going to give me a raise, I am. Let's go. Okay, Sandris Chedis versus Ibragim Sagov. You know Sandris? Yeah, yeah, no doubt. I know both of these guys. Do you remember Ibragim? Do you remember Ibragim? Of course. Yeah, I think this is a tough one here, man, because, I mean, once again, I mean…
Travis Bagent: just like just like tobias i feel the same way like the skill level of my man i mean and all them dudes man i feel like even coach ray i swear to you i did not think coach ray knew how to arm wrestle two years ago now he looks like the most polished coach
Travis Bagent: human being in arm wrestling so just you know sandras and all them guys man just so so gifted uh when it comes to just technical and then they look soft and cuddly and then strong and ferocious the only thing that could get sandras in trouble is he got a little bit of he likes to show you all five of his repertoire
Travis Bagent: Instead of, you know, maybe single on in on the most effective one. So he just needs to be careful because I think he gets arm to arm. If he's not really set up to stop, he's going to get, you know, drug down a couple of times too. So I don't know. That's going to be, I think this one's going deep in my opinion. Close match. Definitely. Yeah. And I mean, I think that, you know, no, don't get me wrong. The problem with arm wrestling is every time you say something like that, all of a sudden, you know,
Travis Bagent: shit out of him. But I can see even Sandris's, even with a dominant outside move, not sticking to it and being just a little, you know, a little John Brzenkis. All of a sudden you let the guy feel all of it in every way he wants before the fucking thing's out of hand. And then you got a trouble and especially with this cat here, this guy's liable to turn him in right away. And then you got a problem. Okay, guys, who is lagging? Me or...
Engin Terzi: Travis, because I see him frozen. I'm frozen to you? Yeah, I mean, now, no, probably, but can you move? Oh, yeah, now it's okay, yeah. That's crazy. Okay, let me... Matt, it's like Matt Mask versus Travis Baszler. Man, come on, man. I beat Matt Mask with my pinky. Okay.
Travis Bagent: Okay, this one is a very good one. Sasho versus Irakli. Wow, very fun. I mean, listen, I am a Irakli lover, I guess you would say, because even, you know, I even thought that he was going to do better, you know what I mean, in the match he lost. So, you know, I'm looking and I'm seeing, like,
Travis Bagent: I feel like Sasho's just amazing at hooking from a position that makes it look like he's too extended, but he's long enough to be that extended, which is remarkable. But I don't know. For some reason, my infatuation with Irakli's hand and wrist and how beautiful the timing seems that I tend to
Travis Bagent: think that arekley is going to win outside and um you know not easy but efficiently because i feel like that as soon as it's not efficient he's in big trouble because tasha's got a lot of heart too i mean just a ton and i mean he's going to either top roll him or he's going to stop him from being top rolled but he's going to be extended way out there i mean
Travis Bagent: Yeah, I don't know. Yeah, I think Aracly's going to win. I understand, yeah. But I know for you and East vs. West, pay-per-view, the arm wrestling community, there's no doubt that you're looking for that window to close, for that wrist curl to happen, and for it to be, you know, to stick in the center of the table. Because, I mean, Aracly's going to take control when it comes to where the hands are. They're going to 10 o'clock at the very least before
Travis Bagent: he does grab him, if he does maintain control in a tricky position, almost getting top rolled and takes 20 seconds to work that top roll into a straight wrist and then 20 more seconds to turn it inside, that is going to possibly be the match of the night because of the way that that would go down. So I'm sure that East versus West would love
Engin Terzi: for Sasho to win this thing, you know, four to two. What is it? Is that three out of five? I mean, your assumptions are just a little bit weird, you know. Devon't you think that as an arm wrestler who gave his life to this sport and loves, don't you think that I have enough of respect for the both athletes where I am responsible to, I mean, just only organize and provide fair competition? I don't really care. I think that the one...
Travis Bagent: who deserves like more to win is the best thing that can happen. Not only for me, not for that. I'm sorry. I thought that you would now at this point in your life with the business you're running, that you would appreciate
Travis Bagent: No, no, if the match is close, it's okay. But when you say that Sasho to win 4-2, why would I want that? Sasho is my friend. No, no, no. I'm sorry. Yeah, you're right. I'm talking about the viewing pleasure of the pay-per-view provider. I think that becomes a – I don't know. And maybe Sasho is not the underdog, but just in my mind, I believe that Araklé –
Travis Bagent: would be the favorite and the style of arm wrestling, which is probably being presumptuous after watching Irakli dead-wrist John Brzenk and show how much heart he had. But I'm imagining that the match goes with Irakli having some sort of good hand and wrist positioning.
Travis Bagent: And in the past, we've seen Sasho work from what looks to be really close to being top roller. Really close, but just having the length enough to lock this thing in the middle. And before you know it, 35 seconds is over and everybody's cheering. He's easy to cheer for, especially if he's the underdog in my mind.
Travis Bagent: You know, I'm just, you know, I'm just talking about, you know, the match of the night. Dana White loves it when they're both just slugging each other at the end. But like you, too, he doesn't care who wins. I do get that. No, no, it's not about I don't care, but I care the one who deserves to win. Yeah, yeah, but...
Engin Terzi: I'm like, I don't, I know what they are doing because I also have a vision to bring arm wrestling to another level. So that is the reason I saw, but I don't enjoy people who just have a bit shit out of each other. Daniel Dodson, Travis, do you like concrete elbow?
Engin Terzi: What does that mean? Concrete Elbow is a YouTube channel that is all the time. He goes like, welcome to Concrete Elbow. I've never heard an episode of Concrete Elbow. Really, right now it's probably the most popular one right now. Okay, and who runs it? Who's the person? Nobody knows. He's something from Asia.
Engin Terzi: Now, does he aggravate people? Is he mean or is he nice? No, people say that he does a lot of, what do you call that thing? Trolling? Not trolling, but he makes a title, like clickbait or something. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, they say. People say that. The other day, he said, oh, Levan match is canceled.
Engin Terzi: Let me go back on record. I love this fucking concrete elbow guy. When you say this now, trust me, he's going to come and take this part and then he's going to put it. This is what he will say. He will do. Trust me. I can't wait. I'm going to find out. I will send you the link if you're not following him.
Engin Terzi: Now, is it a straight secret that he not want his identity ever to be, to come out? I don't know exactly. I write to him time to time. I mean, in fact, he wrote to me and he got a copyright strike and then he asked me kindly and I will remove, you know, but time to time, very seldom, you know, we write. Now, we don't even know it's a guy. It could be a girl, right?
Engin Terzi: Yeah, maybe, maybe, but if he's that crazy about arm wrestling, and as a girl, then he must be the best female arm wrestling fan. Yeah, I like it. I love it. I love it. This is great. By the way, Devon, 53%, Travis, 47% left arm wrestling. Oh, yeah, I'm sure. Yeah, I don't mind. Listen, I've been away way too long. Hey, speaking of being away too long,
Engin Terzi: What happened with Liliev? What happened to the man? Liliev, he was ready. He was just, everything was ready. And suddenly he got a job from state and he had to go to another city and work there. And wherever he went, he said that he won't be able to train, but he said that hopefully he will be back. I really hope so. Yeah. Oh, okay.
Engin Terzi: all right so it's nothing tragic good i thought no no no nothing family nothing anything yeah yeah let's talk let's talk about the next one um we have leonidas versus schoolboy you know yeah i want the winner of this one no i want the loser of this one this is my one of my listen leonidas left and right
Engin Terzi: Schoolboy had an injury with left, so only right. I mean, you versus Leonidas, I can set. Oh my goodness. He's good? Is he good? He's good. Really? The bodybuilder guy?
Engin Terzi: Yes, but he's... Man, I will kill... Hey, listen, listen. There is no way that that... There is no way that bodybuilding guy would fucking take a match with me. Okay, okay, okay. Listen, I will do something. April 20th, left arm. What did you say? Listen, I will do a reality check. Honesty check. April 20th, he has right arm match. Let's go left arm with him.
Travis Bagent: There's no way you could get this guy to agree to fuck with me left-handed. I'm the greatest left-handed arm wrestler that's ever lived. You are a has-been. Oh, my God. I mean, if you talk that way, Michael Jordan is also great, but I don't think he can do something right now.
Travis Bagent: Am I provoking you? Michael Jordan could beat Leonidas in basketball just like I could beat Leonidas in arm wrestling. Yes, but he cannot beat the guy that they are saying right now, the GOAT. What's his name? You know, the basketball player. LeBron. LeBron, yeah, but he cannot beat him right now. Ah, man. Come on, man. If you could even get Leonidas to even... He wouldn't even think about that, the embarrassment. Listen, listen, listen. The embarrassment that he would have to go through verbally...
Travis Bagent: Man, I'm 290? What if I accidentally popped off? Smacked a couple people up there or something, man. I can't be trusted, Inga. I think he would hurt you. Arm wrestling? Or what are you talking about? Watch this guy. Isn't this guy just arm wrestling? You are like 50% of your best, you know?
Engin Terzi: He was in Dubai, right? Didn't he just win or lose? He beat Larry Wills. Oh, man. Larry Wills is terrible. I would kill Larry Wills. He beat him right arm, left arm. A few months before that, he didn't even feel Larry Wills. What do you mean? With left arm, they pulled one in Germany, left arm. And then a few months later, they pulled in...
Engin Terzi: dubai right arm right arm was kind of this he still won six zero but left arm he didn't even feel him you know so his left arm is too good he can't even be larry he couldn't even be larry how's he gonna beat me he he i say he didn't even feel larry and you are saying he couldn't even be oh i thought you said larry won i didn't know no leon leonie does one right well i'll pull larry then let me pull larry then why
Travis Bagent: I thought you were going to beat this guy. I said I wanted the loser, not the winner. You said that. Did you say schoolboy has an injury left-handed? Yeah. Well, there's my match right there. What are we talking about? Let's go. Come on, Travis. You can do better than that. Dude, you really think I'm going to lose to a bodybuilder like Jay Cutler?
Travis Bagent: I mean, you are not Jay Cutler. This guy would kill Jay Cutler in arm wrestling. Okay, who is winning there? Schoolboy or Leonidas? I'm going with Schoolboy. Just because I hate Leonidas now because you said all that shit. So I'm saying Leonidas is a bum. I'm going straight Schoolboy. Okay.
Engin Terzi: And listen, if Leonidas wants to ask weapons, you let me know, but there's no way you're going to convince that man to take the verbal lashing that will, he will have to accept. One second. One second. If you listen, you wanted to pull Camille. You said you may pull Devon and now Leonidas. Okay. Which one for the Filoni Devon? I will, I will try to. I'll pull Devon on the 20th left-handed.
Engin Terzi: This month? Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, he's focused on Levan. Exactly! Exactly! Let's go! I won't talk with you. Let's go!
Travis Bagent: No, it doesn't matter. I mean, listen, you can't get Leonidas, Larry Wills, Schoolboy. Listen, them guys are in the AA, man. These guys are minor league. I'm a living legend. There's no way you would get those guys to take that match. You mean has been legend? Current, current legend. Okay. Current legend. Do you know a Ekaterina Nikisheva?
Travis Bagent: oh yes are you kidding me my goodness these two girls here man this is the right here i am big fan big fan of both and i think it's going to be real close real close and i hope neither one of them catches me rooting for the other one oh because i like them both okay because you are friends with fear
Travis Bagent: And then what's the other reason for the... Well, you can just see the... I mean, listen, when we have representatives that can help put bigger eyes on the sport,
Travis Bagent: It's the same with Sarah. You just have a certain appreciation for these athletes because they could be easily doing other stuff and they love the shit just as much as we do. And it attracts the masses. So, you know, I just know the way it makes me feel when the fucking chicks are skilled, you have to be skilled. And once you are, it is, it's to me, women's arm wrestling at the amateur level is very dangerous.
Travis Bagent: But as soon as it becomes two fucking athletes, it just adds to the excitement level. So, um, yeah, super excited for them. I'm sure they're happy to be on the card and for them to all for just as much to the card as, because a lot of times the girls, they get the benefit of, you know, being added to a big guy's card. But when you have this type of talent, it's just, it's good for everybody. So.
Travis Bagent: Rooting for both of them. I kind of, you know, I mean, I don't know. I mean, I've spoken to Thea a few times. So I guess that, you know, it's easy for me to say her name. So I'll probably give the illusion that I'm rooting for her in the podcast. But I will be attempting to be funny the entire time. So whatever I say.
Engin Terzi: What about you? Do you think that it's 50-50 or you think one of them clearly? I am an organizer. I have no idea. I don't know much about arm wrestling. I am just a rich guy with so much money and just having a good time, you know, nothing else, you know.
Engin Terzi: Benefiting off the blood, sweat, and tears of your ancestors. Yeah, I have no idea. I don't understand. What is the part that you guys have pronated? What is it? How is it happening? Your arm masters?
Travis Bagent: I don't know the technical side either, man. I'm not too good. Oh, okay, okay. I leave that to the 98% group and Concrete Elbow to do all those analyzes. Okay, Mindaugus versus Artur Makarov. Yeah, I think that Mindaugus is the most vulnerable champ you got. He's also...
Travis Bagent: one of the most enjoyable human beings that you could possibly find. How did you like his performance in the last match? Well, I mean, I thought that it was a beautiful strategy. You know, it was awesome. And, you know,
Travis Bagent: Once again, I mean, that format is a tough gig because it was clear to me, at least in my thought, that Daniel was considerably stronger
Travis Bagent: and also willing to get a worse connection without being a little more maybe demanding on the ref um to not let mandalas just be so far outside of his hand but once again when people do that to you and you've been around for 15 years that person did it there was no tricking so um
Travis Bagent: i uh i feel like mandalgas is at best 50 50 every time he has a title defense i'll be rooting for him but wouldn't be surprised at all yeah not at all i mean what an incredible athlete in general and so aggressive and really uh i don't even know if we know i mean arthur could be a lot stronger than mandalas
Engin Terzi: I mean, Artur, except one time, he beat Mindaugus at the meeting. But even the one time he lost, it was one round. Artur came back in the final and beat him, and then he won. But we will see. So let's go. Davit Samushia versus Nurdaulet Aydar Khan. Do you remember Nurdaulet Aydar Khan? Yeah, of course. Yeah.
Travis Bagent: this is another one too somehow the greatest east first west champion besides now mandalgas is also the most vulnerable champ in my opinion because he is not super dominant but winning most of the time yeah
Travis Bagent: No doubt in every single time that if you, if you just fast forwarded and just at different moments of any of the matches, Paul Lynn, Brandon, I'll sell sore, go all the way back. Every single match. If you just gave a certain eight second clip of it, you might not even think he won that. Like there have been times now, does that make it so great that he is so okay with pulling.
Travis Bagent: the way the other guy wants to in early rounds and not just, you know, I don't know. But I think that that belt will change hands too on the 20th. I hope it doesn't.
Travis Bagent: Because I do think that he's a humble, respectful, great champ. And you never want to root. You know, you don't want anything to be taken from anybody. But as an arm wrestling person, I'm rooting for the underdog. I mean, what's the champ's sixth, seventh title defense?
Travis Bagent: he he won seven times seven times in matches he won yeah right yeah if you're not if you don't live in his house it's time for him to go and i think that he's left the door open just enough that i don't think it's a big it's a crazy thing to say that um that he may not even be the favorite you know in some of the in some people's minds so but do you do you remember the performance of his opponent his opponent was lightweight champion he actually beat mindagas
Engin Terzi: and he couldn't make the weight anymore so we took the title from him and now in 85 kilos he pulled against wallah yeah he was dominant just last yeah he was dominant last the last outing yeah yeah one round he lost and then after that he won three times in a row yeah and the whole group of those guys whenever you see them on the card you might as well just pay attention i mean
Travis Bagent: It's on, I mean, the whole country, if they've got a guy and he's on the car, he's coming there to fucking fight. So yeah, I think that he could 100% that, that there'll be. So listen, that's the first two title matches that we're going to see. Right.
Engin Terzi: We have Fia Rysak versus Nikki Sheva. And Fia is the champ now? Or is she the champ? No, there is no champ. This is the first title match. Okay, so we'll give somebody a title. I will tell you title matches. Sasho versus Irakli won. And then Fia versus Ekaterina, two. Artur versus Minda Aguas, three.
Travis Bagent: And then we have Samushia versus Aydar Khan, four. And we have Devon versus Levan, five. Yeah, I'm saying that, in my opinion, Devon's got the best chance to defend his title out of those four matches that actually have a champ.
Travis Bagent: Think about that. And Devon's probably not the favorite. There's a good chance that every belt, except the girls' belt, because it hasn't been issued yet, it changes hands. Maybe. Who knows?
Travis Bagent: I mean, I'm telling you, man, if Mindaugus... Mindaugus is a bad dude if he wins this thing. A bad dude, man. I mean, go right down the list. I don't know. I mean, Racklay has got to be the favorite. I mean, he's a favorite in my opinion. Every one of those matches...
Travis Bagent: i'm saying that the underdog you start saying the challenger is the favorites the challenger is the favorite in every one and the only reason is my love affair for north america that i'm also saying that devin's gonna win but i'm figuring devin wins as the underdog
Engin Terzi: Not as the favorite, but he is the champ. But I don't think he's the favorite. So at the press conference, when you talk about that, it was only a patriotic speech.
Engin Terzi: Well, it's because that's what I want to happen. It was a fan. You want a different thing than what you feel. But let's not go there for now. Oh, I think it's close. Let's go to Michael Todd versus Frank Lamparelli. You saw Frank Lamparelli versus... Yep, I know Frank. I know all about Frank. And I think it's a great match for both people.
Travis Bagent: um michael todd has the ability to beat greater opponents than frank has the ability to be in my opinion that does not mean that frank cannot be michael todd because of the outside hand leverage beautiful angles that frank is going to display and michael todd's vulnerability
Travis Bagent: if when i say vulnerable not vulnerable to actually lose but to actually let inferior strength guys with good hand and wrist put him in long matches and create situations where he's trying to transition and sometimes he falls apart during the half hour process so this is a good match for frank but i think also america
Travis Bagent: the pay-per-view for the east first west is in a better place when michael todd is winning and getting better and as a michael todd fan i hope he wins and is what looks to be super healed up and possibly better than before which would then give us some hope that michael could get could start knocking off some of these champs because
Travis Bagent: Even in Michael's worst, even in his worst, he gives you the greatest match you could ever ask for. Am I wrong by saying that? Get rid of the crybaby stuff a little bit, but you can't beat a guy who's going to log 48 seconds minimum of fucking grinding time. I mean, this is minimum that you're going
Travis Bagent: an outrageous position and him gutting it out and oftentimes having some dramatic transition win. So I hope that for Michael Todd, I really hope he wins because Michael Todd is a little on the sensitive side.
Travis Bagent: So as his friend, I hope the motherfucker gets back in the win column, gets his confidence back up, trains like a fucking mad person because he gives America what he has the tools to compete.
Travis Bagent: uh with the europeans because of you know his skill set and you know it's not easy there's not a long list of guys that can go in arm wrestle a wide variety of international competition and put on a show and he's definitely one of them so let's go michael todd get back on be dominant don't let this guy stretch you out so it takes you two minutes every round um but if you have to do that we're okay with that too
Travis Bagent: Just win. Just win, baby. Okay, the other one. This is a very important match, as the earlier ones. Alex Kurdecha versus Georgi Tsvetkov. Yeah, I think this is another one that, for whatever reason, as solid and as amazing as Georgi is at compromising the hand and wrist...
Travis Bagent: He also leaves himself susceptible to big ogres, huge men that can pull sometimes with their hand back, sometimes in a pushed, broke arm, erratic position. Arecle has all of the funky movements to survive hand and wrist.
Travis Bagent: manipulation from Georgi. If I'm Georgi or Georgi or whatever we call him, I am working on not having my hand above my head. I can't understand why he doesn't understand that he is compromising his thought pressure by his height.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, by the way, it's Alex Kurdes, not Irakli. I mean Alex, sorry. I know Alex. I know that I watched Alex.
Travis Bagent: just get done with Morozov. And he showed me that, you know, he's pretty remarkable athlete. I mean, he'll pull in some, you know, there's not, you know, in my life, there's not a lot of outs, right? I need some height, some hand and wrist, you know, control to initiate my side pressure. I'm not the guy that gets his hand taken and is able to push
Travis Bagent: Stop thinking that Georgi definitely gonna take his hand. He's gonna take his hand at some point. And where is it? How far outside of the shoulder did you get? And how sunken in are you, Georgi, where you don't have the ability to
Travis Bagent: right and then you know georgie starts getting tired but there's also wear and tear as to how efficiently you take this guy's hand and wrist and how awkward the positions that he has to push through so i think that you know you hit you hit on this match as well i mean this match could easily be the match of the night as well yes yes you have two really good guys
Travis Bagent: that are also you know pretty good showmen so i think that uh you know this this is a good this is a good one yeah and also too have some has some implications right the winner of this can get a a shot at armies or a shot at dennis right i mean i think i think most likely the winner of this may pull uh michael todd in u.s event but it's totally up to michael's
Engin Terzi: performance in the next two matches. Yeah. And what about Jerry? Any more negotiations with Catarat? Jerry is pulling Vitaly Laletin. In Dubai or with you? Here, here in July. Oh, okay. Yeah. And what's the July what? July, what's the date? July 6th.
Engin Terzi: July 6th and August 10th, you know. I mean, I would love to see you in the Florida event. I think we are going to make a dream team. You can imagine which Atlas I will be inviting. And it would be incredible, incredible. It's in Orlando? Yeah, it would be incredible. This will be part of that historical moment that is East versus West is finally in U.S. And there will be home, not away this time.
Travis Bagent: and then yeah and then and then we work out all the kinks in florida and we have the greatest event ever in chicago oh my goodness we need to talk about it would be great let's go i'm gonna be with my guys in naples on wednesday are you coming what is today you coming with him
Travis Bagent: No, he's not coming to Istanbul because he bought into that PFL, the Professional Fight League, and they are hosting the Professional Fight League in Chicago on April 19th and 20th. But I'm going to talk to him about...
Travis Bagent: about the fact that I'm going to be in Istanbul and all the stuff that we can possibly do. And more than anything, start the ball rolling for us to find out what it took to do, what it took to get Orlando, and then how to make it better in Chicago. Because even if we went to Chicago first,
Travis Bagent: you could make orlando better because of chicago so the fact that you'll be in the u.s for the first time will work out a lot of the the kinks too it'll be good i think chicago chicago is going to be a great host for east first west one day trust me no i have no doubt my friend i have no doubt we just need to sit down and talk about it and what do you think about alija murado i mean
Travis Bagent: Hold up, you said Alex John, right? Yeah. Oh, yeah, I think this is it right here. This is the one right here. This is the last obstacle. If this guy is able to distinguish of this fucking super heavyweight freakazoid, then Alex John is him. He is the most dominant professional left-handed arm wrestler ever.
Travis Bagent: that we have. I don't think he's going to be able to do it. I think that he's going to find out that Ermes is a little too heavy, a little too big, a little too skilled. I think that there are heavyweights that aren't as skilled as Ermes that are maybe stronger than Ermes that still maybe did not be able to beat Aljon. So this is going to be, I think that if Aljon is able to control Ermes and beat him,
Travis Bagent: it's going to be super impressive to me super impressive and he's already impressive he's the champ and if you can honestly ever and i've said this plenty times if you're telling me there's a one-on-one format in the world with four or five weight classes and you can go to sleep where the arm wrestling world truly feels that you are the champ you're a pretty lucky guy
Travis Bagent: like i'm not you know even holding world titles will make you a lucky guy but there's always that argument where some guy wasn't there this and that and all that when this thing that you've got formed now there is an opportunity for people to go to sleep
Engin Terzi: and the majority of the world think that he is the best guy, is the champ. And we've never had that. Yes, that's what I try to explain to people. We don't have three worlds. We have one world. And I would like to know who is the best guy in the world in those categories, left, right, woman, man. That was my goal. Listen, we will never go to the next level if we
Travis Bagent: are not united right now. I'm going to tell you the truth. I have never in my life ever went to sleep and thought that one guy was the right-handed champ of the world. Now maybe it's because I'm an asshole, resentful, and I never wanted to give Pushkar, Dennis, John, Devon,
Travis Bagent: Whenever the supposedly people thought that that was the guy, I was always like, I'm telling you right now, when this thing is over on April 20th, I will 100% rest my head in that hotel room and I will feel that that guy is the best right-handed arm wrestler on this fucking earth.
Travis Bagent: Yeah. Right now. And that is pretty fucking cool. That's pretty cool. And I think that all the champs that leave there have a legitimate argument at that. And Alijon has, I do believe that he is the left-handed champ of the 231 class, 209 class, whatever that class is that, but whether he's the superior champ of the world that can do, because listen, man, Ermes is going to be amazing.
Engin Terzi: He's going to be fucking amazing. Listen, right now he told me his left arm, right now he said, normally 80% of his right arm, but he said this time his left is much closer to his right arm than ever been. So he said that right now his left arm is very, very strong. But from other side, Ali Can is also crazy strong. I really don't know what's going to happen. Ermes is probably 25 kilo heavier he will be in the event.
Travis Bagent: But, I mean, that guy, you know that he's the last one. Neither one of them have much to gain or lose if Ermes wins. But Aljon has immortality.
Travis Bagent: almost if he can win and then i don't think ermis really no one really cares that much about him losing left-handed but if alexan wins that is huge for him huge and i don't think and neither alexan doesn't lose any of my respect for losing that because i i know that i know i was around ermis and i was purposely around him and the more i'm around him he is an incredible
Travis Bagent: motherfucking athlete and he's going to be oh he's going to be awesome he's going to be awesome and listen he's you know possibly going to be borderline disrespectful too so if he's able to just because he's almost a little disrespectful yeah just at the table if he's able to take control my friend my friend
Engin Terzi: Uh-huh, okay. Yeah, scary. Oh, you saw that? You saw that? Yeah, I saw that, man. Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, you know, Alizhan doesn't take the things all the time that personal, but when there is a challenge like that, I'm sure that right now he wrote, he noted somewhere, you know? Yeah, Alizhan is so serious anyway. Yeah.
Travis Bagent: Yeah, very serious. This card, the card is crazy. Is that going to be the co-main event, or is that the second? Yeah, it's going to be the co-main event, yeah. You got to be careful, man. You better be careful with that, because he might kill Alexsandr. You might want to make that before the Alex match. Because I feel like Georgi...
Travis Bagent: Georgi is going to get Alex's hand and wrist. That match is going to be fun. There's a chance that Ermes kills Alejon. We'll see. And if he doesn't, I'm telling you, I grabbed a hold of, I grabbed Ermes. If Alejon beats Ermes, I will never, ever even, I'll look straight at the ground if I ever see Alejon. I will tell you something. The hand that you hold with Ermes,
Engin Terzi: was not his competition shape, even with right arm. I know. Left arm, whatever you felt on that day, trust me, feel you, like he is probably 20%. And imagine how, imagine how Ermes has been playing off all the times that people been, you know, because he didn't, you know, that wasn't a flattering match with him and Artem.
Travis Bagent: The fact is he was tired. He was not into it after a pretty quick time. And from then on, he's got to listen to him not being that good left-handed when he knows that match could have been different if he would have never pulled Dave Chasen.
Travis Bagent: Yeah, but you remember, Morozov also pulled. No doubt. No doubt. I'm just saying that when you get someone's hand a little bit, you go crazy if that's your only match of the day. Right? But I could just, like, he was physically...
Travis Bagent: exhausted internally yeah yeah yeah you know what I mean and listen Morozov I don't care I love I I don't love Ermes but I like the a lot he does not have near the heart that Artem Morozov has they're not the same people Makarov will die die
Engin Terzi: right there at that fucking table like ron back yeah but do you remember hermès is hard against levon and again no doubt i've been there i've been there once they once they get out on your hand a little too much and just like richard love peace you remember you remember hermes versus also uh the vicali latin match
Travis Bagent: yes yeah yeah i think i'm not saying he doesn't have heart i'm just telling you that the endurance and the the unwavering commitment that some arm wrestlers have as a part that other people they are not the same people marzov is less skilled with more heart
Travis Bagent: And I'm not sure which one's better to have. You're talking to a man who has no heart. That's all skill. And it's done good in my life. But I always have a ton of respect and admiration for the dudes that won't give up. And they end up, you know, I mean, everybody loves that. You really think that you don't have heart? Well, I know that I'm not the guy. You remember with the Jerry match that you didn't give up. You fought till you...
Travis Bagent: Oh, yeah. Ain't no doubt. But I just I also was present in my own head and I can tell when and I've been locked up with those guys and they do not care. They would die rather than give up. And I have always been like analyzing, damn, how do I get in this position?
Travis Bagent: Why can't I move? But it was never this, I don't care what happens. I'm holding on. And I feel like that. And I don't think it's okay. I don't have any self-reflecting problems when it comes to that style. But I definitely think that Ermes could be dominating. And if Aljan is able to beat him, then Aljan is a special, special person. Okay. Let's come to the main event.
Engin Terzi: What's going to happen? Yeah, the main event is simple, man. Let me tell you. Do you agree with me that I said the other day, I said the career of Devon until the pandemic and then career after pandemic, two different careers that Devon now is all over international poolers.
Engin Terzi: that is pulling against the best Ekaterina pullers one after another, while before the COVID, yes, he had pulled Pushkar once, left arm, Denis left arm, and then right arm Taras like almost 20 years ago, probably 18 years ago. But do you, other than that, it was mostly North American level.
Engin Terzi: But of course, the North American super heavyweights in 2000s were the best ones, you know, like, I mean, maybe not always the best. Yeah, I know what you're saying. Yeah. Yeah. So what I'm just saying is, do you think that the experience and confidence that Devon gained after first level match is incredible?
Travis Bagent: Do you remember which match? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't know if, yeah. And more than anything, LeVon's injury and LeVon's match with Ermes.
Travis Bagent: And his confidence being strict. But I do I do think that LeVon gave everybody a reason to hope. And when I say hope, we're hoping that you lose if you're the undeniable champ of the world. Right. And it's not like that's just the way life is. Right.
Travis Bagent: the the match switch hands especially if it's one of those situations where we have a hero to root for right and the the hero is an american guy with an american market when i say american north american and he's the underdog we got everything we need because not a lot of us wouldn't want to see the match
Travis Bagent: if you don't if we don't have the the hermes match and if we don't have the the wrist injury right because it was too dominant before but you add it all up and somehow now we got hope and that's what we need that's what east first west needs that's what the pay-per-view needs it needs the hope that this thing is not going to turn out exactly the way it did before
Travis Bagent: Now, I am a fucking firm believer and I am betting on it more than anything. When I said those comments at East First West that I believe them, there is one problem with what has taken place. I do feel there's a chance that too many people echoed the same belief that I yelled out and that we could underestimate
Travis Bagent: the power that our words have had over LeVon. And where is LeVon's work ethic? Where's his power? Where's his attitude? Where's his health? Where's his endurance? Where is all this stuff? Did we, by pointing it all out and doubling down on our love for our social media giant and the fact that it's a beautiful story,
Travis Bagent: Because LeVon is so amazing. And he seems to be amazing for a long time because of the format that we employ now, right? Where it's not like he's going to be at 17 tournaments a year and you can catch him slipping. The fucking guy's going to pull one or two times a year and he's awesome. But he did open it up for us. And now I believe a lot of people think Devon's going to win.
Travis Bagent: I hope that that hasn't motivated LaVon past where he was, right? What if he was on cruise control at the top and now the injury, the army smacks and showing a little bit of vulnerability from a cardiovascular standpoint, what if that has made him now refocus and maybe become even better than he was.
Travis Bagent: And if we had just shut the fuck up and let Devon creep in there to a guy that was on cruise control, rather than a guy who is picking up the newspaper every day, he feels like he's the underdog because of all the social media lovers. So you were with LeVon, you were with LeVon, right? Yeah. In his mind, he thinks that he was
Engin Terzi: twice stronger than Devon in the first match. And he says that he's going to destroy him. And he didn't like when people made fun with him about the last two rounds of Ermes' match. And yeah, he didn't like that for sure. And... But he didn't mention my name, did he, about any of that, right? No, he said that he will talk to you privately in Istanbul.
Engin Terzi: No, no, no, no. I'm good. Devon't buy that ticket. I'm good. Anyway, so he, you know, many times I invited him as a special guest. And when Devon was winning, Devon was the one who put the belt on him. So I kind of think that he was feeling like I should be there. You understand? And I think he was just, he's just right now. So...
Engin Terzi: thirsty, you understand? Yeah, that's like that word right there. Yeah, but Travis, you may be thirsty, but as you said, when you have some injuries, some problems, it doesn't matter how thirsty you are, you understand? You may want it, you do everything possible, you take everything seriously, but we don't exactly know where his wrist is. And I don't know what it is, but whenever I watch
Engin Terzi: he versus Devon round two, first match, he basically took everything from the wrist. He didn't pull this way, but he hold him and then went out or side pressure. And then I saw Devon's wrist. So I think Devon's pronator is okay, but I think that he also needs to somehow have a little bit resistance here. He shouldn't be going so easy.
Engin Terzi: i tell you what when you are in strap and you have incredible tornado back pressure i mean your hand will come with you you understand because the other guy cannot put so much pressure here because you put in more pressure from here so what i'm just saying devon people focus only on his back pressure and everything but here needs to hold on if you if you are strong here you will hit him effective if here is going
Engin Terzi: I mean, I don't think you can use so much of your pronator effectively. So I think that it is not only about Levan's wrist versus Devon's back pressure, but it's also Devon's hand and wrist versus Levan's back pressure. Yeah, I don't know. Yeah, I mean, I just know that this is truly, I mean, I ain't never wanted to see something that I wasn't involved in
Travis Bagent: more than I want to see this shit. Ain't no doubt. It's going to be crazy. So I don't know. I mean, I feel like I believe Devon's going to win. I just wonder how messy it'll be. Because if I'm Devon, I know that he's willing to be messy. But it would be better for his legacy if he didn't have to be. So we'll see. We'll see. And I don't know. I mean,
Engin Terzi: I hope LaVon, how do you think LaVon is going to cope with the cardio standpoint? Because he doesn't look like... I think, listen, first match, not the first match, sorry. When he pulled Ermes, he was, I think, 190 kilos. But when I went to Georgi, he was 180 kilos, 10 kilos less. And the other day, we wrote to each other. I asked him some photo.
Engin Terzi: you know, those things, how do you call it, cutouts, you know, the real... Yeah, yeah. I asked him to send me a photo, and I asked him how is everything, and he said that he was 177 kilo, but he is, or 78, I don't remember, but he is planning to be 172 to 175, so basically he's gonna be 35 pounds, around 35 pounds lighter than
Engin Terzi: So I think he's working on his cardio right now. Now, how do you explain Devon just crushing Ermes? Not even being close. But my friends, just come on. How was Levan versus Ermes match? The same second Ermes' wrist went this way, right? Right?
Engin Terzi: I mean, Levan toppled him. Yeah, I guess it was. Yeah, I guess it was. No, no, what I am just saying is, so Levan took his wrist. The same thing, Devon also took his wrist. But the only thing, Levan was like this and still pulling while Devon was close. Right, but I feel like the arm wrestling world doesn't think that Devon could have done that to Ermes the day he lost to Levan, but that he is, in fact, now equal to
Engin Terzi: because of that time that passed. No, I mean, for sure he's better. But the only difference is that Levan also didn't have any hard time to take Ermes' wrist. But the thing is, I think, my opinion, Levan's hand at the beginning position, like this position, is very strong. But his, like, you have, like this,
Engin Terzi: but you also have here. I am not sure if Levan is super good. I feel like I have that same problem. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I like to be about right there. I don't want to be there. Yeah, yeah. But whenever you cannot control here, the pronator, even you take the wrist, if the guy has the resistance, because you couldn't turn him here, but he has here, so he can still resist. But with
Engin Terzi: Devon had, like, a little bit more copy and just watch his match with Ermes, but still Devon couldn't pin Ermes. So what he had to do, he had to do shoulder pressure to finish it. Yeah, but we know that. If Devon stops the match, man, it's over, bro. It's over.
Engin Terzi: it is over what do you say again three seconds stoppage with any sort of yeah michael also said the same thing michael also said the same thing but i think michael said that that stoppage needs to be to his wrist if he has a savage like while he's he has the wrist he says
Engin Terzi: levan then it doesn't matter if devon goes inside the mess up or something he said that it will not matter he says that the stoppage needs to be by levan losing his wrist here because they say that even if the mess is up but levan has the cup even this much of cup not like this but here they say that levan will have power to you know uh finish it that's what they say yeah
Travis Bagent: It's on, dude. It is on. Because it's got to go all the way. Even that third match, it doesn't even matter if LeBron beats him easy the third match. We still are going to wait for the fourth match for something to stop. That's what makes it so fucking interesting. Let's go, bro. Let's go. Yeah, it will be. But do you think that we are finished? Do you think that Devon for sure levels up?
Engin Terzi: since he started stem cell things. Because I was in Dubai, I said this many times, whenever he did that right away, that shoulder pressure, intentionally to Dave, I don't remember Devon doing such thing. Somebody takes his wrist and he fights like this, I saw. But him to go directly like this, he needs to have some strong elbow to do that. And he was able to do that.
Travis Bagent: I believe that, yeah, I believe he has leveled up. And I just think that, yeah, I think, yeah, I think he's going to fucking win. That's what I think is going to happen. And that's terrible, man. He's going to be the man. All right, man, we ready to get off here or what? We've been on this thing forever, man. Okay, you take care of yourself. I see you in Istanbul. Yeah, yeah, you're going to book that ticket.
Travis Bagent: Let me know when you're done. Do you want to talk anything after this one about Chicago or later? I'm going to be with this guy. I'm going to FaceTime you with this guy in Naples. It could still be a good chance that we're good. I'll know 10 days before the match.
Travis Bagent: Exactly. And here's the deal too. We can start, you know what I mean? It doesn't have to be a crazy, you know, we can start at any number. Yeah, we can talk. I can tell you the information and you tell me what it is.
Travis Bagent: There is one guy, 30 seconds, this Petro guy, I put him time out for many times, but like Travis, any good top roll exercise just as we are finishing? Top roll exercise. How about kettlebell curls and then just keep working on trying to turn that kettlebell, right? Sideways. It's hard to do it, but you'll find an angle there. Kettlebell curls.
Engin Terzi: Good luck with that. Take care, Travis. Thank you. Thanks to everyone, guys. Thanks for watching. You all take care. I will be with you guys probably with a few other podcasts. Thank you very much.
