Unknown: sure yeah yeah all right okay okay hey hey guys um whoever joined us uh we have bet kill your nanny
Host/Interviewer: Can you turn? Can you turn the camera to the left? Too big. Too big. Too big. Too big. Too big. Too big. Too big.
Host/Interviewer: his audio he has some audio issues i think um okay okay yeah we cannot hear this yeah he can hear us but we can't hear him yeah as as usual uh professionalism the highest standards look at my lighting setup look at this
Host/Interviewer: See, I will enable some lighting too. See, I also have some light. And it's not all, I can go more, you know. All right, okay. So you leave no competition for us, man. No, no, take it all. Okay, Talgat, Talgat. How do you feel, how do you feel before a big fight with Kili?
Host/Interviewer: It's not all, I can go. The form is great. Good form. How was it? I saw you working there, working well all the time. Any pain, something like that, or everything at the best level? Everything is fine. No injuries. The form is good.
Host/Interviewer: a man of few words i asked him about how is his form how his preparation any injuries or anything he said everything is perfect everything is great um
Talgat Aktaev: Did you meet him? Yes, I met him at the World Championships in... 2015? 2017. In 2017. Yes, yes, yes. Yes. At that time, Talgat had a weight of 74 kg. And he went up to 75 kg.
Host/Interviewer: And how did it go? Did you win the bet? Or not? You will take revenge. Yes.
Host/Interviewer: So I asked, have they met on competition? Target had met with Betkili in 2017 in World Championship. They were in the same class, 75 kilos. And I asked, how did it go? I said, did Betkili win? He said, yes. So he's here for revenge. Dr. Kirk.
Host/Interviewer: Roman, are you working? Yeah, yeah, yeah. So he actually told me that he cannot join back. I mean, maybe invitation you got because you have full of tabs and stuff. No, I'll get I'll send them same one. One more time. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
Host/Interviewer: I also don't want to be a national champion for a very long time tomorrow. Yes. Latvian championship, right? Yes, yes, yes. Good luck to you. Good luck. Do you fight yourself? I'm an organizer and I fight myself. I'll see how it goes. What category? Ninety. Ninety.
Host/Interviewer: Good luck, good luck. In 1985 there will be Vladislavs and Tuoms. We don't want everyone to be in the same category, because it's a qualification for Europe. Vladislav is thinking of going to Europe in 1985, and Tuoms too, so they are in the same category. I'm in 1990, and then Kasparov is in 1980. You already know ours. So...
Host/Interviewer: Okay. I was just telling guys that tomorrow is Latvian Nationals and as a competitor, as also as organizer, so we will not be on for too long, but we will try to get Betkely on the army. I have to say this, Betkely and Talgat are two of my favorite pullers on the left arm. Always enjoy the matches. Two complete opposites. One is fast as lightning and the other one just...
Host/Interviewer: destroys his opponents by like giving them no hope on pinning him that's I think that's the magic of but kill you on those who don't know like uh when he was super active he was probably one of the best uh left hands we have ever seen um
Host/Interviewer: uh so um uh i i was following also the chat obviously we have uh people uh wondering there there was one guy uh rob k i already replied to him but uh for those who share the same uh question rob uh had uh actually asked he had no idea of uh our guests i mean he said he's not familiar with them and i told them that uh basically has already been with us has he had match against alex job right am i right
Host/Interviewer: yeah so i just uh for those who didn't know or uh needed to be reminded yeah basically is not uh participating first time at east versus west so yeah debut unfortunately for georgians uh debut his debut was not successful or they could beat him but we will see uh his next match
Host/Interviewer: all right i'll keep messaging him we'll keep talking hopefully he will come he's just joining now he's joining now all right all right yeah can you hear him he's connecting the audio good moment good to see you good to see you
Host/Interviewer: He's saying that he's also happy finally reaching us and seeing us. Ask how was his form? How was Bruce Prepper? Because I saw he was in Spain. Is he still in Spain or did he...? Petkiel, your form is interesting. How did you form yourself? I know you were in Spain. You were in Spain. I know you were in Spain. What did you do?
Betkili Oniani: Yes, yes, it's not a new thing. In the past, we didn't have it, but now we have it. And what is your form now? I think I'm in a good shape, I'm doing well. The only problem is that I don't have a sparring partner.
Host/Interviewer: so he he said that he's actually currently also in spain right now but he will get back in georgia at 15th and then he will travel to istanbul and he's in good shape he's happy with his shape but the only downside of his current training environment so to say is that he has no sparring partner so that's kind of big deal for armistler but yeah otherwise he feels good
Host/Interviewer: Yeah, because I like the chemical armwrestling training, I think right there, they have absolutely everything. But I hope that Keeley comes in like like did he have enough time, like at least to do some some weight trainings and things like that? Like that's how does he feel physically or not? Like does he have like a measuring stick where he was, where he is or something?
Host/Interviewer: Okay, I will also ask, maybe he has upgraded from his previous shape at East vs. West match. So, Bergil, in terms of form, how do you feel? How do you feel about your form?
Betkili Oniani: . . . . .
Betkili Oniani: What percentage of the population in Zinandeltan is from the French population? I think 10-15% of the population is from the French population.
Host/Interviewer: so um i asked him uh yeah obviously we know the question i asked uh he said he feels uh really confident uh about the weights he's lifting he's uh progressing he had then i asked about percentage because like hanging everybody else love percentage he said roughly 15 he has gained from the previous shape strength wise very good with lifts so it's it's good it's good upgrade yeah
Host/Interviewer: Okay, that gives me some calm because Talgat is very, very hard opponent to deal with because he's so lightning fast, right? He just wants to in less than a second go home. All is done. Does that kind of worries him? Maybe lack of practicing with someone with that specific technique or he doesn't care. He feels so confident in what he's doing.
Host/Interviewer: Right, I will ask you. How do you feel when you hear the name of your country? How do you feel when you hear the name of your country? I am very happy, very happy. I am very happy, very happy. I am very happy, very happy.
Host/Interviewer: Well, I think we're almost there, but we're almost there, but the problem is still there.
Host/Interviewer: He said that I re-asked several times to make sure they got his point. He said actually speed is not crucial in this match. He doesn't feel that speed would be the biggest issue.
Host/Interviewer: He said, yeah, for sure. He knows how strong and how explosive Talgat is. However, when I re-asked multiple times, he said, no, I don't think that this explosiveness necessarily will be the deadliest weapon, so to say, to decide the outcome of the match. He feels that he will eventually stop him, and then we'll start the war, some table IQ and stuff, and then...
Host/Interviewer: yeah it will we will take it from there but speed like it will not be decisive that's what he said okay i'll i'll translate the russian and i'll ask them the same question which i'll ask uh right like uh where do they fear that the part where it's hard to
Host/Interviewer: I asked him how he looks at the explosiveness of Talbot. He said he wants to win so fast and you go home and that's it. He said he doesn't think the speed will be the factor.
Host/Interviewer: He thinks it will be more endurance, fighting, strength. I just have a question about the target. I know you're super fast, but BetKill has such a thing that he can't...
Host/Interviewer: How can I put it? Put it on a pillow. He defends himself very, very well all the time. He worked especially for this. We all know where he is strong. He will turn everyone around and sit there. Or maybe you worked a little bit up. Because many times we saw that you can win him through the top. I think we will win him.
Talgat Aktaev: Yes, I know how he fights. I fought with him before. And I have not only a start in Arsenal, but I also work hard.
Talgat Aktaev: I work to win everything possible. If I win with a start, then with a start, but if we don't hold on, then I have to work too.
Host/Interviewer: He said that if we get into the match and like I know how he arm muscles, I have fought with him, I have seen him. So this will not be only about speed. I feel confident he worked on his endurance, he worked on his strength. So he believes if he gets stopped and gets in those positions, he will still be able to fight in those positions.
Host/Interviewer: I will make sure if Betkili understands what he is saying without translation or if he needs me to translate.
Host/Interviewer: Yes, it is very important. It is very important that we know how to deal with problems, how to deal with the problems of the Commission, and in this regard, if we have any problems, we know how to deal with them, because we have to deal with them in the right way. It is very important that we know how to deal with problems, because we have to deal with them in the right way.
Host/Interviewer: And also there was one question for Talgat. What does he do as a training? What type of exercise is primary for his speed? Why he is such explosive? There was the question from Sergey.
Host/Interviewer: okay we'll get back to it all right yeah yeah
Host/Interviewer: What's the weight of Betkili now? How much he weighs? Somewhere around 99. 99? 98, 99.
Host/Interviewer: face okay i i because i was i thought okay maybe he's like 80 80 something 85 right you clicked refresh on your face and in your mind two times in one second he was like matches at 85 right yeah he said yeah i remember in world championships like him and vlad would fight and after like they they went to podium and there was
Host/Interviewer: he would be like eight kilos bigger and vlad would be like wait i remember yeah uh bet you just said that okay you will not be problem to lose yeah he will cut weight yeah okay okay okay that beard the lawyer yeah
Host/Interviewer: he's asking uh like this three five uh three four kg does it seem too much because of your reaction was so uh you know surprising for to him he was like definitely drop it 99 yeah but it's at 85. no it's it's 95 i believe 95. yeah really hold up it's target
Host/Interviewer: That's why I'm surprised. Middleweight. Light heavyweight is what? 95? No. Middleweight is 95 and waterweight is 85.
Host/Interviewer: Is it right? Then it's middleweight, right? Okay, yeah, yeah. I told that 85. Yeah, we need to ask Talgat as well how much he weighs. Talgat, sorry, I'm sorry. One more time. Tell me. Was there a problem with the connection? Everything is fine, everything is fine. How much does Talgat weigh now? Weight.
Host/Interviewer: 93 kilograms. 93? Okay, okay. So the target is that 93 kilos that I said just...
Host/Interviewer: my general reaction yeah yeah 95. so uh we could re-ask maybe the question what but i think people can understand how i'm confused because the both of them fight at 75 kilos not so long ago then pulled at 80 then pulled at 85. yeah it's crazy crazy i think i'm justified by this reaction
Host/Interviewer: I'll ask the question one more time for Talgat. Talgat, there was a question. Is there something special that you do for Explosiveness? Or have you always been like that? Yes, I've always been like that.
Host/Interviewer: How do you work? What kind of work do you do?
Host/Interviewer: Is there something special that Talgat did for explosiveness? Or it was always like that and it just works? There are many who can work for explosiveness, but not all are like him, right? Question from the fans.
Host/Interviewer: uh yeah their internet connection is slow yeah that's why they they get the answer uh question too late and then it's delayed as well ah okay okay all right let's hope this will work yeah okay 95 kilos 95 okay everything is okay i still remember
Talgat Aktaev: He just said it. Let me just answer it. How do you answer such a question? In general, Tolgatov has a natural talent, as they say. Yes. And he just does it. But his start is from nature.
Host/Interviewer: he said that he works on it it's like like genetic like it's uh one of the things that he got just natural ability to just be that fast yeah yeah
Host/Interviewer: So I guess his fast twitching muscles are just biogenetically, it's just better developed for him. So when he just works on the speed, these fast twitching muscles are getting better and better, more than the other guys. So yeah. We finally answered that question. Yeah, we got this.
Host/Interviewer: Good, good. Up to 95 kilos. How does Talgat think? Will he win the bet? Is he ready for Artyom Tainov? Or does he still need to work on it?
Talgat Aktaev: If he wins, he is ready to fight everyone in the 95 category. Who is he ready to fight?
Host/Interviewer: I asked him if he wins with Kili, is he ready to face Artem Taino as the champion for the belt? And he said he doesn't matter. He even said Oleg Zok's name, but I'm not sure if Oleg will go up. I'm not sure. Yeah, yeah. But it's quite a big, big goal and big jump. But I mean, if he's confident, that's all we need, right?
Host/Interviewer: that's the that's the biggest like uh uh how does i want to ask but keely uh about the match versus oleg jock if um okay i think there's a possibility for for you to beat him right like or or how much time or specific training just for him you need what did he feel in that match
Host/Interviewer: Let's start with you, your first match vs. Westeros. You were able to beat them all. It was a tough match, but you managed to win. You were able to beat them all.
Host/Interviewer: Tell me, how do you feel now that you are in the middle of all this? What is the story behind it? Did you have a chance to go to England? I had a chance. Tell me.
Host/Interviewer: gladly i would gladly pull him as my next opponent because uh i then asked so you feel confident he said yeah for sure uh i have a chance to definitely beat him that's what he said okay okay he has learned from the mistakes from the uh experience so yeah he's confident uh let's let's go some of the matches um
Host/Interviewer: What Talgat thinks, who will win, also Betkili. We forgot, when we were doing the podcast Davit with Samushia, Brandon Ellsessor, Stoyan Golemanov. Stoyan Golemanov replaced Arsen Lijev. Do you know anything about Brandon Ellsessor?
Talgat Aktaev: I've seen El Cesar before. He had a fight with Samushia. In the first round, his fight was good. But after 3-4 rounds, Samushia won it very easily. I don't know. I don't know Kolyamanov very well either.
Host/Interviewer: okay so i asked them do they know brendan el sasser they say yeah they remember the match versus uh samushia they they thought that uh he did very good on the first rounds uh but they don't have much information about uh stojan gulimano or or both guys so they're going 50 50. yeah
Betkili Oniani: That's what I wanted to say. So, you wanted to say something analogous, right? Yes, I wanted to say something analogous, right?
Host/Interviewer: He believes that Stoyan Golemanov will win. He also underlined Stoyan's last visit in Spain. He had competition there and according to Betkely's opinion, Stoyan is performing well, has performed well at the Spanish tournament and then he believes that he's favorite in this match.
Host/Interviewer: okay okay so he has some first-hand knowledge about it um i i don't i think maybe sometimes there's no point going to all the matches let's talk about some of their favorite matches as well as some of the left-hand matches but because these are left-hand guys right uh so uh target tobias kamil jablonski
Host/Interviewer: He knows these guys, right? Yes, he does. 60 to 40. For Tobias. For Tobias. 60 to 40.
Betkili Oniani: He is a master of the press. Is there anything he can say that Kamil should do to win Tobias? If he wants to win Kamil, he should...
Talgat Aktaev: The first one is moving. He needs to take the first one at the start. If he does the first hook like this, maybe he will win.
Host/Interviewer: So they said that they're going 60-40 for Tobias. And then I asked Talgat as a master of press, what does Kamil needs to do to change it? And he said he needs to win the start. If he doesn't win the start, it will be very, very hard for him to beat Tobias. He needs to be first to turn inside. Yeah.
Betkili Oniani: It was a very difficult time for me, and I would like to thank Tobias for giving me this position. It was a very difficult time for Tobias.
Host/Interviewer: He said 60 to 40 for Tobias to win. He said that he believes if Tobias manages to get the match in his favorite positions, then like if he controls the position. So it means like if he manages to get Kamil out of his favorite position and comfortable zone, then Tobias will win. And he gave 60% of the chance of happening that. So 60 to 40, Tobias.
Host/Interviewer: The next big one is Alizhan Muratov vs. Ermes Gasparini. Talgat, do you have any chances against Ermes? I don't have any chances against Ermes. Because Alizhan is going to Rangaila. He said that...
Talgat Aktaev: Um, okay.
Host/Interviewer: But Ermes can almost never be turned into a circle. Do you remember in 2018 against Rustam at Zloty Artur? On both hands, I think. He couldn't turn it. Or was it on the right? On the right.
Host/Interviewer: It's very hard.
Host/Interviewer: They're going with Aljan because Aljan loves top rollers. Like, for Aljan, top rollers are, like, that's what he loves. Then I explained that it's very hard to turn Ermes in a hook. And, of course, his right arm isn't, like, his left arm isn't his right arm. But still, it's still very hard to do. And then I asked, like, percentages, and they said 80% that Aljan will win, 20% that Ermes. Yeah. But Kili...
Betkili Oniani: Ermes or Alizhan? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
Betkili Oniani: But it's clear that you are not involved in the war. You are not involved in the war. Yes, I am. I am very aware of it. I think that the war has nothing to do with what happened in Spain.
Host/Interviewer: so he said this match for him is almost the favorite on the card it's very exciting for him to watch that battle he said
Host/Interviewer: He gave more chances, like he said that Alizhan is favorite, Alizhan will manage to beat Ermes. And then I asked just to make sure we also mentioned with other guests that it's not like weight limit, it's like open weight class. And interesting enough, Bet Gili said actually because of the left arm,
Host/Interviewer: uh it has no um uh it it almost doesn't matter like ermes will not be able to use that weight advantage on the left arm so that's why it's like um
Host/Interviewer: you know vice versa some people some other guests samushia said differently but basically saying that on left arm no if it was right arm that they obviously no no nothing to discuss but on left he will not be able to even use his weight advantage
Host/Interviewer: oh yeah but yeah i mean it's it's really good really good matchup yeah yeah the more more i look at that match more i like that match um we gotta go with um with this one uh mindaugas and artur mccarroll mindaugas and artur mccarroll target uh
Unknown: How do you see it? Where are the strengths of Artur and where are the strengths of Mindaugus? Mindaugus is a great player. Artur is a great player. Artur is a great player. Artur is a great player.
Talgat Aktaev: The soldiers think that Makarov is not seen in the competition lately. But he doesn't know exactly what form he is in. But the last fight in Tarasaitis, he showed himself well. But the soldiers think that Artur Makarov is a little uncomfortable for Tarasaitis. And the soldiers think that Makarov will win.
Host/Interviewer: okay uh so he said that uh he hasn't seen arthur macaro in a long time and like in a big competitions and uh so he doesn't know what kind of shape he's in and the last time they met on table uh arthur macaro had better like he was better than mindaugus so he believes he has the edge and he will win he will he has uh better chances of winning this match than in dog star sites
Host/Interviewer: But imagine if Minda also gets up to the 95 kg just like Talgat and Betkili, you know. It's crazy. And also also Irakli. Irakli is also one of the greats. He used to also pull at 75. But he all the time told me every time I dropped that subject, he kept saying I hated dropping weight that low because naturally he was not that lightweight.
Betkili Oniani: So, what do you think about Betkili, Minda and Artur? This time Betkili is at 50-50. It's a really close battle. Both athletes are in great shape.
Unknown: Yeah, so it would be 50-50. 50-50. Okay. Davit Samushia and Nur Daulat. Aydar Khan. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Talgat Aktaev: Nardolet? We are currently training together with Nardolet. I know his current form. He is now 100% in form. And I am 100% sure that Nardolet will win.
Host/Interviewer: So he said that they're training together right now, and he knows what kind of shape Nurdaulet is in, and he believes Nurdaulet is a 100% form, and he's certain that Nurdaulet is going to win Davit Samushia. What do you think? I think Davit Samushia is going to win Davit Samushia.
Betkili Oniani: I can say that 20% of the competition is mine, and 30% of the company. The main reason is that the title is given to many people. The title is given to many people. The title is given to many people.
Betkili Oniani: I don't know how many times I've said it, and I don't know how many times I've said it.
Host/Interviewer: So Betkili underline the factor of defending the title. It's always hard because of their responsibilities, especially when it's such a long run, long streak of defending the title. It carries the weight for the match. And it may be also in the inside of the armwrestler in mind, it would also carry more responsibility and it would approach the match differently, slightly, but
Host/Interviewer: He also said many have tried to take away the title from Samushia. We all know how it ended. So this one will not be any different. He said 30 to 70%. So like 70% Davit is the favorite.
Host/Interviewer: Oh, but he wanted to also remark how well deserved opponent Nurdaulet is for Somosha. He said that Nurdaulet deserved that match and he got it. So, yeah. Okay, let's go with Betkili. I think we lost a little bit of Kazakh translation. What does he think about, is Irakli ready for Sasho?
Betkili Oniani: Abash, what do you think about the current situation in Iraq? What do you think about it? I think it's a good idea. I think it's a good idea. I think it's a good idea.
Host/Interviewer: He relies on the huge progress of Irakli since their first match. He's saying that that's evident. It's everybody knows how he performed, like what was Irakli's level and what it's now. So based on that, he believes he has progressed more than his opponent. So he would favor Irakli in this match.
Host/Interviewer: okay yeah also I think a lot of people will take uh Paul in match right oh yeah yeah but again this is different styles where where one was going and where one was not going right so yeah we'll we'll get them we'll get them eventually back um
Host/Interviewer: yeah but we also have to keep in mind actually i i always wanted to remark this uh how uh how easy i would say relatively easy in first round iraqi managed to top process i'm not sure what sasho changed because i'm not as knowledgeable knowledge in armwrestling techniques in details i'm not sure what he has changed to stop it was very easy but first round it was easy to operate it was happening like two two seconds
Host/Interviewer: i think on round two he did what we would call mortal sin he got too confident and let sasho to sit in and and then he was stuck and couldn't get out and he said that his arm just blew out
Host/Interviewer: Thank you very much.
Talgat Aktaev: Both of them are stronger. The fight will be very good. It will be spectacular. It's hard to say that someone will win. I think 50-50. Do you think it will look a bit like Irakli vs. Rustam? When it was like this, like this. Do you remember this? Yes, yes, yes. Something like that.
Talgat Aktaev: Like in 2021, Irakli has improved a lot. He is stronger now than before. But Sasho knows that he will also do something different in the match. He can change the course of the fight.
Host/Interviewer: They both have a chance to win 50-50. So pretty much they're saying because of how much versatile both of these guys are. Like I've seen a lot of versatility from Sasho and there was a lot of versatility in things you can do with Irakli. The match can go either way. And I said maybe it will remind us a little bit of Rustam versus Irakli match. And they said yes, definitely. It could be like that back and forth. So they're going 50-50 in this one.
Host/Interviewer: um i i we have to talk about georgie cvetkov alex kurdecha yeah for sure yeah but kelly right now i'm telling you you know georgian
Host/Interviewer: 50-50, you know, both are great champs, like great armwrestlers, elite-elite level, and both are in like very good shape right now, currently. So he gave both equal chances, so it could go either way.
Host/Interviewer: Yeah, I'm so excited for that match because it will be a crazy match. I guarantee to everyone it will be a long, super heavy, absolute war. One of them is going to be like this and this and it's going to be crazy. It's also the heaviest match. I believe it's over 300 kg will be at the table. Well, 11 is over 300 kg.
Host/Interviewer: leon it might be it might be equal with devon and levin depends on how big devon devon comes in right 300 270 130. you might be right actually yeah somewhere we'll see okay okay uh imagine target uh alex kurdeja georgia cvetkova right hand who is favorite and why
Talgat Aktaev: The Kurdish team is stronger, but I think the Kurdish team will win.
Host/Interviewer: said that uh of course they're both strong but he he thinks that uh maybe it's kudecha's time and kudecha will win this one yeah it's it's definitely one of those um at least he has taken uh his wrist once at zloty i think kudecha could be the only guy who took uh
Host/Interviewer: yeah when he was saying he's on top rollable right uh or yes yes i have seen uh sweat goes matches at waft against lebanon but like like pure uh top roll is the risk taking i only recall like uh
Host/Interviewer: For BitKilly, just a question. Before we go to the big main event, right? But which match of the card is for you like you want to see this match? Like, of course, not talking about his own match, but which match is like, I really want to see this. Like, this is very interesting to me.
Host/Interviewer: Guitkhar, what do you think about this event? What do you think about this event? I think everyone will agree that Levan Salara is a great player.
Host/Interviewer: now he said like almost all the matches he he's like really really excited but obviously main event is the number one and i would i will also remind the uh people he also said um irmus and alijan match is also his one favorite so yeah yeah that's uh
Host/Interviewer: What does Betkely think? Does Betkely think that, will Ermes be able to not get turned in? If he loses, will he stay flat or he will just get turned? Supinated, yeah. Yeah. What do you think? Do you think that Ermes will be able to do this pronation? Do you think that he will be able to do this?
Betkili Oniani: I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so.
Host/Interviewer: so he said uh it's extremely tough to uh take the priest of alijan and uh only or in in case uh Ermes manages then yeah otherwise it will be uh um alijan's game so he he said that it's possible to get subordinated for others yeah yeah if Ermes doesn't take that hand he'll just get in yeah yeah I'll I'll ask the same question to target target um uh
Host/Interviewer: Let's not talk about Ermes vs Devon now, but from all these matches, which one is the most interesting for you? You really want to see how it will be. Even a big interest for you personally. How do you feel? I don't know. For me, Devon is the most interesting.
Unknown: Basically, all of them. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Talgat Aktaev: For you, Megzhan? For me too. All the fights are very good. But there are some that you want to see for yourself. For me personally, I want to see Talgat and Nardole fight. First of all.
Talgat Aktaev: And then? And then I wanted to see the fight of Arsen Diliyev, but it was canceled, right? Yes. Sasho and Irakli will be a very interesting fight for me. Tsvetkov and Kurbechev too. Alizhan vs. Ermes too. Devon vs.
Talgat Aktaev: Both of them are very spectacular fights.
Host/Interviewer: Okay. Amazing card, man. Amazing card. He said that, first of all, of course, he wants to see the matches, and he lives for the matches of Nurdaulet and Talgat. That's 100%. And I said, of course, we put them on a pedestal, but what next? And he said, first of all, it's Irakli versus Sasho for him. And then, of course, he said Devon versus Levan and Alex versus Georgi Tsvetkov. And there's, like, I think the whole card is great. And, yeah, he said Arsenyev.
Host/Interviewer: wanted to see him coming back but um not this time we'll see it we'll definitely see the like he has bitten by the bug it's it's right there he's on his way well he's he's played good kids oh
Unknown: At the moment, I think
Talgat Aktaev: The one who will stand against him for Lebanon is Devon Varad. But I think at the moment Devon also has a small percentage to win Lebanon. And at the moment in the whole world, I think that there is someone, I don't think that there is someone to oppose Lebanon.
Talgat Aktaev: Because Lebanon has a very big weight. For him, there is no one who weighs a lot and is as strong as Lebanon. I think at the moment Lebanon is number one in the world.
Host/Interviewer: He said that he believes right now Devon is the only guy that could give a match to Levan, but even he has very low chances. Levan, in his mind, is number one guy on the planet. He has huge weight, he has huge power advantage, and there's no one to really put him... What he kind of meant, you need the same guy to be facing him, to have a chance with him. That's how he feels. Yeah.
Betkili Oniani: Now ask Betkili to explain why Devon Park is going to win. Betkili, tell us, why did you choose Levan? It's a chance. He's a very good athlete. He's a very good player. He's a very good player. He's a very good player. He's a very good player. He's a very good player. He's a very good player. He's a very good player.
Host/Interviewer: First of all, Devon has climbed his way up one more time and also very convincingly he deserves where he is right now. But however, Levan is just too much for him and he favors Levan just because he will overwhelm him.
