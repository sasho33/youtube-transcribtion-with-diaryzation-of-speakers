Pavlo Derbedyenyev (translator): Now everything is fine, everything is going, we are gaining. What do you think about the match with Ivan? How do you feel? Will it work?
Pavlo Derbedyenyev (translator): He's saying that mindset absolutely to win, but he said that Ivan is very, very serious opponent and yeah, he's very interested how it's going to go on the table. Yeah.
Pavlo Derbedyenyev: Yeah, he's very explosive and very fast with the wrist, you know, so quick wrist, yeah. More or less, if you win this match, you know what is next, right? With left arm. He says, if you win this match, you know what's next for your left arm, right?
Pavlo Derbedyenyev: I haven't thought about it yet. Who's next? Who's next? Artyom's saying that he did not think about it yet. And he did not think about the next one yet. Okay. He's so much concentrated on the Ivan match. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yes. Yes. Yeah. Anyway, so let's talk about the East versus West 12.
Pavlo Derbedyenyev: Today I invited Morozov to be a special guest, but he said that at that time he will be somewhere else, but he will be watching with the Kazakhstan team all together. Anyway, so what do you think generally about the East versus West 12 card?
Pavlo Derbedyenyev (translator): Let's talk now about IS vs SWAT 12. He knows that you will watch from the whole team of Kazakhstan. What do you think about this event, about 12 East-West?
Artyom Morozov: I think he's frozen. I think he's frozen.
Artyom Morozov: It's very interesting. I still hope that a miracle will happen. Finally. I think everyone is waiting. And in general, everyone is very interested. Talgat Aktaev will fight, Alizhan Muratov, and we will all watch and cheer. The girls will fight, finally. I will cheer for Ekaterina. It's hard. Yes.
Pavlo Derbedyenyev (translator): okay yeah he's saying that very interesting card and uh he said yeah for sure main event uh everybody is waiting and everybody is uh hoping for miracle to happen finally and uh he said but besides that it's a lot of uh wonderful matches and uh ladies he's very excited for ladies matches uh he will uh he will cheer for ekaterina nikishova
Pavlo Derbedyenyev: And here he said it's its own great event. Yep, yep. Okay, let's start. Artyom, I would like to know your predictions because you have been part of the East versus West right from the beginning. Artyom, do you remember Petro Marharint?
Pavlo Derbedyenyev: I think, Artem, you have... Yeah, something is wrong with your connection. You are frozen. I think we hear you, but your video is frozen. Yeah. Anyway, so his opponent is... Maybe... Maybe? Yeah, his internet connection is slow. Maybe...
Pavlo Derbedyenyev (translator): we don't we don't hear you right now maybe do you have any better place in the home that maybe you have better connection
Pavlo Derbedyenyev (translator): Maybe you... He said lately in the area, very bad connection. Okay. Okay. Second, one second, he said. Yeah. Maybe...
Pavlo Derbedyenyev: okay okay he will be outside yeah outside he said it's better connection yeah but but it is uh sorry about that outside cold or okay okay okay okay okay yeah sorry about it also and our art from you know petro marharin and do you know nikosh uh
Artyom Morozov: Do you know Marharint and Nikos? Yes, I know. 100% I think Petro Marharint will win. 100% sure that Petro Marharint will win.
Pavlo Derbedyenyev: Was Petro Marharint, does he remember when he was competing youth category? And I think Petro Marharint was also competing youth category.
Pavlo Derbedyenyev (translator): I don't know if you remember, but when you were a junior, Marharint was also a junior with you. Was he? No, he wasn't. As soon as I started fighting, he was among the adults.
Pavlo Derbedyenyev (translator): Artyom says he doesn't remember anything like that. He thinks Marharint was an adult open senior. I saw him pulling against Dadikyan and beating Dadikyan right arm. Was it in the senior category? Yes, Dadikyan. Yes, Dadikyan. Yes, Dadikyan.
Pavlo Derbedyenyev: Oh, he was in the senior category. Okay. Okay. And he is saying that Marharint is going to win. Yes. Today I saw matches of Marharint beating Ongarbe, Marharint beating Dadikyan, Marharint beating many top guys. He beat Deserano.
Pavlo Derbedyenyev: I saw a match that he's beating also Di Zerano. I was just, of course, he was probably 100 kilos Di Zerano, but still, you know, beating Di Zerano, Ongarbev, Darikian, Revas, Lutvize, Sandris. And like all those guys, yeah, he beats, it's impressive, you know, incredible. Yeah. Okay. So let's go. But from other side, Chikadze is also very strong. Chikadze also very interesting puller. But the, the,
Pavlo Derbedyenyev: Marharint has a very strong wrist, Morozov. Very strong here, yeah. Very strong and finger strong. Yeah, finger, yeah, yeah, you're right. And Brandon Elsasson or Stoyan Golemanov? Are you familiar? I've seen Stoyan, I've followed him. Well, I mean, when he was still fighting at the World Championships. Unfortunately, I don't know anything about the first match. He doesn't know anything?
Pavlo Derbedyenyev: Yeah, he said that he knows Stoyan, but he doesn't know the assessor. Brendan Assessor is one of those guys that had a world title match against Davit Samushia. Okay, so if he doesn't know both guys, it's very hard. So, Morozov, Betkili Oniani versus Talgat Aktaev. I know Talgat is from Kazakhstan, but Betkili is also very strong. How do you see this match?
Artyom Morozov: Translate something, Artyom? You know, I haven't seen Betkili fight for a long time. Hello? What did you say? Yes, yes. You interrupt a little. Well, I haven't seen Betkili fight for a long time. That's why. And all the same, all this time, Talgat, he trained and performed. Plus, he progresses. And he gained weight, as I see.
Artyom Morozov: Therefore, if BitKill manages to stop a little, then there will be a struggle, but Talgat will win anyway. But there, most likely, it will be very fast. Very fast, very cunning, very beautiful.
Pavlo Derbedyenyev (translator): He's saying that he didn't see BitKilly too much lately. And Talgat is constantly training and participating in the events. And he said that most likely, not most likely, he said Talgat will win. But if BitKilly will stop the match, it's going to be a very interesting match if he will stop the match. But he thinks Talgat will win anyway. But he said that most likely everything is going to be very fast. Okay, okay.
Artyom Morozov: And let's go. These are your category. Tobias Sporrong versus Kamil Jablonski.
Artyom Morozov: That is, if he didn't listen to me, then Kamil here, unfortunately, will win. Well, not unfortunately, but unfortunately he will win. But I still think that Tobias, judging by the last fight, he added well and will not let Kamil get into his strong movement, and still Tobias will win. But it will be very beautiful for a very long time.
Pavlo Derbedyenyev (translator): okay uh yeah he said uh he's yeah commentate a little longer he said that if uh Tobias did not listen to me when they was pulling and did not start training the side then unfortunately he may loss take a loss but he said from what I see lately Tobias is progressing very good and he started training his side
Pavlo Derbedyenyev (translator): Yeah, and he said that most likely he will not let Kamil into his strong move, and he said that probably Tobias will win. And he said that it's going to be a prolongated and very interesting match. Okay, people call you Morozov Skywalker now. Darth Vader, Darth Vader. Yeah, Darth Vader, yeah. Anyways, Artem, what's your weight now?
Pavlo Derbedyenyev: How much do you weigh now? Now I'm 130. I'm just starting to gain weight. As of right now, 130, and he just started to gain. 130, right? Yeah, because I see his face, his arms, everything bigger than before. And what was his weight when he pulled Kurdecha? And when he was fighting Kurdecha, I think you said he was 127.
Pavlo Derbedyenyev: Yes, plus or minus 125 kg. He was constantly jumping. He was gaining and losing weight. On average, he was 125 kg. Yes, 125 kg, now 130 kg. And he started gaining weight. What did Ivan do to you that you are doing this? You go to the Kurdecha match, 125 kg. And you go to the Ivan match, 130 kg. You just started gaining weight.
Pavlo Derbedyenyev (translator): He said, from the fear, I'm gaining that much because Kurdecha surprised me very much and he said that I think that was...
Pavlo Derbedyenyev: he doesn't want to experience another surprise yeah okay and and another thing uh artom like do you think that you're gonna beat all these guys and become also right arm champion
Artyom Morozov: Everyone is striving for it. I'm only a few years old. I remember your words, Pavel. So I still have time. I think everything is still ahead. It may not be soon, but it will be. He said, yes, that's the goal, that's the plan. And he said, listen, I'm still very young.
Pavlo Derbedyenyev (translator): we're having a conversation times two times we have 18 years difference and uh last time was a little bit down after uh his loss when he was sick and I'm like 18 years difference and I'm still here maybe not on your level but still here so you have plenty of time and now he's saying please I have plenty of times and yeah it will be okay that's great that's great and let's go Sandris status versus Ibragim Sagov
Artyom Morozov: I think Ibragim Sagov will win. Devon't offend me, Sandris. He said, sorry, Sandris, don't get mad, but Ibragim Sagov thinks he's gonna win.
Pavlo Derbedyenyev: Ibragim is going to win. I will ask you something, Pablo, quickly. What was the first match you thought? I will ask your quick predictions as well against Chikadze. Marharint, yeah, I'm pretty sure. I don't know what his form is right now, but still, regardless, I think he's going to win. And Brandon versus Stoyan. Do you know who Stoyan Golemanov is? Yes, I know. I think Stoyan is going to win. And who is winning, Stoyan?
Pavlo Derbedyenyev (translator): Yes, I think so. And Betkili versus Talgat Aktaev? I think Talgat because of his activity lately and I agree with Artyom. So you are basically agreeing with Morozov. And Tobias versus Kamil? It's a tough one. It's a very close match but because
Pavlo Derbedyenyev (translator): i saw the progress and i'm i'm watching uh tobias and uh i think i think i will give him a little bit not much maybe like 251 49. yes very close very close let me say that whoever has the center will probably win i would say not even that center but this center
Pavlo Derbedyenyev (translator): Yeah, but to pull a little bit out here, it doesn't really matter, but to take him outside, because he does this. A little bit outside the shoulder, yes. Yeah, you need to take him so he cannot really put the... It's basically who is faster on the start. Faster and strong. Sometimes you are fast, but not strong enough, but we will see. It's very interesting. I'm waiting for this one, yes. Yeah.
Artyom Morozov: Let's go. Artem, Leonidas vs. Skullboy. Damn, I'm looking at Sasho now, at Skullboy. Well, he's some kind of beast. Still, I bet more on him. Leonidas, he's strong, no doubt. But Skullboy doesn't sit still either, he's progressed very well. Still, I think Skullboy will win.
Pavlo Derbedyenyev (translator): Yeah, he's saying that Schoolboy is like an animal right now. He's watching him and he said, yeah, Leonidas is very strong, but Schoolboy is not sitting on his butt. He's moving and progressing. And he said that, yeah, he thinks that Schoolboy is going to win. Yeah. What do you think, Paolo? I think Schoolboy is going to win because of the technical abilities. Do you realize that Morozov is a very calculated, smart guy with his answers? Yeah.
Artyom Morozov: Sasho vs Irakli. Artyom. It's going to be very difficult. I think it's going to be very difficult.
Artyom Morozov: Sasho is a very strong god, a very strong hand. If he has no problems with his right hand, then there will be a long fight and Sasho can still stand. If there are a few problems, if Irakli has progressed even more, if this weight race does not prevent him, for example, then Irakli will win. It's very difficult here. 50 to 50.
Pavlo Derbedyenyev (translator): he's saying it's a very very tough 50 50 and he explained why he's he thinks it's gonna be an endurance match uh he said if social doesn't have any problems with his arm then most likely he will over endure iraqli and he will win but if there is any problems with anything or if iraqli progressed
Pavlo Derbedyenyev: like even more with his move then he may win he say unpredictable 50 50. okay so either iraqi dominates or the match goes to battle and then if it is a battle then sasha is better endurance okay sergio thank you for your super chat it says four more arm wrestling battles thank you my friend thank you for your support and this one i will ask
Pavlo Derbedyenyev: But tell him, before I ask, tell him to answer me with all his heart and 100% honesty. Okay. And I want only the percentage, only percentage, nothing else. Only the percentage.
Pavlo Derbedyenyev: okay uh arthur morozov versus ivan matushenko okay okay that's what i want to hear i don't want that nice oh it's i think close match because it is better when we are just challenging you know yeah anyway so
Pavlo Derbedyenyev: um let's go to the next one fear isek versus ekaterina nikiseva leva leva rukafia i think
Artyom Morozov: She is very strong, despite the fact that she rarely fights now. But I see that she has a very strong anthropometry. And she is, in principle, a very strong person from nature. Not only physically, but also in all aspects. Therefore, I think she will win. And, I hope, I cheer for her. He is saying that he thinks that Ekaterina is going to win, even though she is not very active right now.
Pavlo Derbedyenyev (translator): uh naturally she's very strong and he has she has a very good anthropometry and uh she's strong in all the aspects of the life not only physically and he is cheering for her and he thinks she's gonna win i understand and the god do you think does he think that the god will win this event
Pavlo Derbedyenyev (translator): Who is gold? Gold is who? If he is golden, then I am platinum. What's that? He said, if he is golden, then I am platinum.
Pavlo Derbedyenyev: What do you think about Mindaugus and the winner this time? Makarov or Mindaugus?
Artyom Morozov: I still think it's Makarov. He's very uncomfortable. If Makarov doesn't play like Prokopchuk, then Artur will win. 70-30. 70-30, okay. He said 70-30% that Makarov is going to win. He said if he's not going to start playing like Daniel played, he's going to win 70-30%.
Pavlo Derbedyenyev (translator): he's very uncomfortable he said arthur yes okay and what's your opinion uh i i believe that uh makarov will win but i think it's much much closer than the 72 30. uh yeah i mean douglas is very serious opponent and uh
Pavlo Derbedyenyev (translator): and uh he may stop the match and he if he will stop the match it's getting very very close yeah yeah you're right all right and what did you think about sasha versus iraqi i think iraqi will dominate but uh it's it's a little bit tough to say so so big it's huge difference in anthropometry so i it's so hard to predict because if sasho will stop the match in his position with a side engaged
Pavlo Derbedyenyev: then Artyom is right. It will be endurance management. Sasho's endurance is better. But I don't think it's the case. There is a message for you, Artyom. People say that you fake about your stomach problem just to avoid pulling mindogas. And now you're talking shit about him.
Pavlo Derbedyenyev (translator): Yeah, he said that, yeah, that opened me up, and yeah, that's true, unfortunately. Anyway, so Michael Todd versus Frank Lamparelli.
Artyom Morozov: Frank Lamparelli vs. Michael Todd. Michael Todd will win, I think. I'm watching Michael Todd right now. I'm watching him. I mean, the man has really become more powerful, stronger than he used to be. I think Michael Todd will show everyone, absolutely.
Pavlo Derbedyenyev (translator): said that michael dowd is gonna win and he is watching uh his uh she's watching him and he said he's he became a powerful strong again and he said he will show to everybody how it's done he said that he's gonna win okay david samusha versus nurdal aydar khan another kazakh guy so much
Artyom Morozov: Damn, it's going to be very interesting here. I'm very excited and curious at the same time. I think that all the same, now Nur Nurdaulet, compared to his previous fight, he has now healed his injuries. And I think that Nur Nurdaulet will still win. It will not be a dry victory, but Nur Nurdaulet will still
Artyom Morozov: It's the title match, right? I think it's 4-2. 4-2, Nurdaulet wins.
Pavlo Derbedyenyev (translator): He's saying that Nur Dalet already took care of his injuries by this time and he doesn't have any injuries and he said that it's a tough match and he believes that Nur Dalet will win but not with a zero count. He believes that it's maybe like 4-2 win for Nur Dalet. And Chokri, thank you very much my friends for your thoughts and
Pavlo Derbedyenyev: This is Georgi Tsvetkov vs. Alex Kurdecha. Give me both, please. He said, give me both of them. Yeah, you want the revenge match with Georgi? Yes, yes. A little later.
Artyom Morozov: My coach told me that you can't leave it like that. His trainer told him that he cannot leave it alone. He has to, you know, give it back. Okay, okay. It's going to happen. It's not right. I don't know what Alex's right hand is. I don't know. But if he, damn, can surprise with his right hand in the same way, fight with the joint in the same way,
Pavlo Derbedyenyev (translator): he said that if alex will bring us the same surprise if as he brought with the left hand and he can uh start arm wrestling in his joint then he said it's very very close match but he may give a little bit of the edge to the alex
Artyom Morozov: Okay, now the last two matches. Olezhan Muratov vs. Ermes Gasparini. What do you think about this match? I'm sorry, but Ermes couldn't beat me on the left hand. What can he do with Olezhan Muratov? Olezhan Muratov will just beat him and that's it.
Pavlo Derbedyenyev (translator): She said that, I'm very sorry, but Ermes couldn't win my left. And he said that Alizhan will just run over him. There is no options. Okay, he doesn't think Ermes is strong? He said in general he's not strong enough for Alizhan.
Pavlo Derbedyenyev: Oh, okay, okay. He said that I personally think that for me he was not strong and for Alizhan it's going to be the same thing. Yeah, people think that he was very tired because of the HFC match. This is probably why he lost. What does he think about that?
Pavlo Derbedyenyev (translator): He said, what about me? I did not pull before or what? We just drank a beer before that? How do you think?
Pavlo Derbedyenyev: Yeah, he also has the Revoz match. I remember what a tough match it was. But the interesting thing is that now Ermes wrote to me and he wants to say a few things. Should I invite him, Artem? Ermes wrote to me, he wants to say a few things. What does he want to say? Is it okay? Yeah. Okay. Okay, okay.
Pavlo Derbedyenyev: yeah i just hand him the link let's see what he will say yeah quality my friend my friend
Pavlo Derbedyenyev (translator): yeah but listen when he comes don't do any back step you said he's not strong oh i'm kidding i'm just using my translation power
Pavlo Derbedyenyev: Oh, somebody just joined. Somebody just came. Hello, Ermes. It's not good to be alive, my friend. Your piccolo bratello, Ermes. Ciao, Pablo. How are you? This guy is talking behind you. He said that you are weak. And he says that, like... Weak? I saw, I saw. Yeah, you saw, right? Yeah, yeah. Okay.
Ermes Gasparini: Anything you want to say to him? He beat your left arm, do you have any excuse? He reminds me when I broke his wrist in the first round or not. We will see after Lesjean. I want to have the revenge if I win. After I will win with Lesjean.
Ermes Gasparini: And if he thinks he's super strong, he wants to beat everyone, I want to see if he has enough
Pavlo Derbedyenyev: to challenge me with the right hand i will i will crush him he said he said if he has enough balls to pull him like if he's that strong super strong yeah just translate it yeah with the right hand yeah
Pavlo Derbedyenyev (translator): He said that he has three big balls like Genghis Khan, and it's enough to win. Okay, that's it. Again, organize some events whenever you want. We'll see who has more balls.
Pavlo Derbedyenyev: i have four boys listen uh artom like you beat him left hand but are you sure you are ready even for the right time someone like hermes or is he too much for you well yes we all know that you won with your left hand he says seriously you think you are ready for him with your right hand
Artyom Morozov: My right is stronger than my left, so I'm ready. He's saying that my right is my left. I'm ready. When and where? Perfect. Angus, it's only up to you now. Okay, okay. So sometime after the match, you want to pull him? No problem.
Pavlo Derbedyenyev: okay okay i just don't want any of you to write me again on the live i said this but don't say that please oh that would be incredible match it would be an incredible match
Pavlo Derbedyenyev: We are very young and it's beautiful to see some... Two warriors. Two warriors. Warriors, yeah. Gladiator versus Tinkestan. Terminator. Terminator, yeah, yeah. Yeah, Gladiator and Terminator, yeah. Yeah. It was incredible, yeah. Yeah, so Artyom, so Alizhan is beating him? Artyom says, well, Alizhan will beat the left one.
Artyom Morozov: Why? Why he said like this? He said 100% I think. Why? Why? He said he will give to Alizhan the third extra ball.
Artyom Morozov: Alizhan doesn't need it. Does Alizhan need it? No. He need it, he need it. You sure? He need more Alizhan? I know Alizhan needs it. He doesn't need 1,000 more. Go everywhere. Yeah. No, bro, Alizhan is 100% a favorite. Why are you like this? He needs more, he needs more. What are you doing? Alizhan will win.
Pavlo Derbedyenyev (translator): yeah he's saying bro alizhan gonna win he he's yeah he's gonna win how is he gonna win is he gonna hook him or top roll him or side pressure how he said that he gonna cup and then it doesn't matter
Pavlo Derbedyenyev: Oh, he's going to cut Ermes' pronator like this? That's what he said. Wow. Ermes, is it possible to lose 105 kilos? Impossible? No. Ermes, the other day, two days ago, you told me that right now your left arm is very close to your right arm. In some of the moments you said you were doing 40 kilos, now you're doing 52 kilos, which is 30% more.
Ermes Gasparini: okay it's improved for sure for sure i don't have pain my elbow and i train it good really and for like a riser i want now i will put the video and or today or tomorrow i did like 40 kilo with a difficult
Ermes Gasparini: Now I did 52. Yeah. Well, just imagine. It's only because if I don't have pain and I can train good, I can improve more. I don't know.
Ermes Gasparini: If these exercises are adapted on the table. But for sure, if I compare when I pulled with Morozo in the past, for sure he's in the best shape. If you had this shape right now in a fresh match against Morozo with left arm at that time, you would beat him? I think I would open his wrist.
Ermes Gasparini: You would take his wrist and you would beat him, right? Maybe, yes. It's not very close to my right. If before it was 20 or maybe a percent or more difference to England. Now, maximum 15. But everybody knows my right is incredible. And 15 percent less is super strong, you know.
Pavlo Derbedyenyev (translator): yeah paulo hermes says that the shape that he has now would beat the hell out of arthur you want to learn some russian i heard what he said
Pavlo Derbedyenyev (translator): He said that he started to train well, healed his injuries, and the left one became much better than when he fought with you. He said that there was a difference of 20% or more. Now the difference between the right and the left is decreasing. The maximum is 15%. The left one is getting much better.
Pavlo Derbedyenyev (translator): Sorry, sorry. Maybe yesterday I did a personal record rise. No, sorry. World record with rise. And I will put the video. With right arm. Right arm.
Pavlo Derbedyenyev: right oh but listen listen listen you want him to pull you with right arm and now you say this kind of things you want him to cancel the match who
Pavlo Derbedyenyev: I mean, you say that you broke the world record with the riser, and two minutes ago you asked him to pull your right arm, and now you say this. What will you do if he cancels the match now? No, no. He said he has a lot of balls. Maybe he will come without one ball, but he will come. He has three balls, he will come with two balls. What did you lift on the riser? Almost 60 kilos.
Ermes Gasparini: 60 kilo almost i'm counting i'm sorry but 132 pounds one point here and then on the knuckle
Ermes Gasparini: No, no, no, no, no. On the end. Give me three months. On this move. Everything's good on the bench without lifting. Very good. I will send you my friend the video. Send it to me. Send it to me. I'll send you. I know you are very strong.
Pavlo Derbedyenyev (translator): You are incredible, really. I show many, many videos. Tema, he says that he has raised the world record. Now, well, on the riser, on the lift, you understand, on the rib, he has lifted almost 60 kilograms there. He says, well, I'll post a video soon. He says, I'm getting stronger and stronger. Engin says, listen, you don't scare him, he will now give up the match with his right hand. You scare him with world records. No, well, I'll just continue to do my exercise. When I win it with my right hand,
Pavlo Derbedyenyev (translator): Everyone will start lifting Morozov, as they will do now. Everyone will lift Morozov. So get ready. He's saying, get ready. I'm doing my exercises. And when I'm going to win the right hand match, everybody will do my Morozov's exercises. But with him, I need only to do like this. One, two, finish.
Pavlo Derbedyenyev (translator): He said, Artyom, you need to do two movements. Like this and like this. And that's it. Rise, back pressure, finish the match. He decided that by the fight on the left hand, which I also injured at that moment. Ermes, did you decide because of the left hand match? Because left hand was injured too. So be careful. What?
Pavlo Derbedyenyev (translator): He said, did you decide that those two moves are enough because of the left-handed match? No, no, no. Right is enough. Only this. We know. Everybody knows. Only this.
Pavlo Derbedyenyev: if serious i want to see this match maybe not right now maybe end of the summer i i i know both of you guys yeah yeah i'm no i'm very serious it is right here and if any of these guys back up back step call me i will i will i will just put this video yeah yeah put everywhere
Pavlo Derbedyenyev: good everywhere everywhere i will put it everywhere my friend i don't want any back step okay let's see i mean tv on the show chat tv everywhere bbc everywhere the challenge is done publicly cannot have excuse privately so no no finished and my god our tom just wait a little bit and then we're finishing in the last match our tom
Artyom Morozov: Levan Saginashvili vs. Devon Larratt. Who is winning here? I hope that the miracle will happen and Devon Larratt will be able to win.
Artyom Morozov: I hope I'm cheering for him because he really deserved it. That is, he fought practically without leaving the table for these two years. Therefore, I will cheer for him and hope that he will win. Let Levan not offend me, but this is the desire of many fans of armwrestling, not only mine.
Pavlo Derbedyenyev (translator): He said nothing personal to Levan and please Levan don't get it personal but it's a dream of many armwrestlers or armwrestling fans and he is cheering for Devon Lareth to do the miracle and win this match and he really thinks that Devon deserves this. He was climbing all the way up.
Pavlo Derbedyenyev: and he's training hard and he's putting putting a lot into it and he he believes and he's cheering for them and he believes that the miracle is possible so so what he is saying that okay from one side he is saying that he deserves it but from other side he says it is a miracle so when you say it's a miracle it sounds like you know almost impossible to do it does he think that way
Artyom Morozov: Do you think it's a miracle if Larratt wins, that it's almost impossible, or do you think it's possible and he wins? It's possible, I said miracle, because it will really look like a miracle if such a small person from Lebanon wins it. I think it's possible, I know it's possible. I follow Devon, watch videos with him, I think he's capable of winning Lebanon.
Pavlo Derbedyenyev (translator): Yes, he said that he's using this word miracle only because of the size difference and that human relatively small compared to Levan.
Pavlo Derbedyenyev (translator): really can and he believes that he can and he believes that it's possible uh will win and that's why he's using this miracle so like miracle is the general perception yes yeah and but how does he see the chances like on percentage just to understand um
Pavlo Derbedyenyev: 53 by 37. 63 by 37. Who? Lara. Oh, Lara, 63. 63. 63, yeah. Why three? He's trying to make it one towards two.
Pavlo Derbedyenyev (translator): I specifically asked Ermes to ask this question. Why three? He said, I made it on purpose to make sure that Ermes will ask why three. Okay. One last question. Artem, generally, are you a tougher guy than Ermes? He says, in general, are you a tougher guy than Ermes or not?
Artyom Morozov: You know, I didn't go to the sauna with him. I don't know. We're both young, about the same age. How can you judge? I think I'm more promising. He said, listen, we did not go to sauna together. He's joking.
Pavlo Derbedyenyev (translator): And he said, I don't know the answer to this question. We're both approximately the same age. We're both young. And then he smiled a little bit and he said, my perspectives are better than probably the nervousness. He's what? He's what?
Pavlo Derbedyenyev: my future and my abilities of progress is probably better than that okay better than okay when he said the sauna who is tougher who can handle more heat you know that's what he means right yes yeah okay so he has he has but my friend leban in one year or two years he will lose with someone
Ermes Gasparini: But Artom says that he's going to lose on April 20th. Yeah, yeah. Or this year or next year, he will lose for sure with someone. Okay, but how do you see? Can you remind us how do you see the Devon versus Devon match? For me, Devon really, he has a good chance to win.
Ermes Gasparini: It depends on everything if you can take some risk of Levan or not. That's it, the straps. Can I ask you something? You pulled both of these guys. Who is this hand you felt stronger? Levan, for sure. Levan? Yeah.
Ermes Gasparini: Devon, yes, he has a very strong hand. You feel like rock, you know. But Lewandowski is very big. It's difficult to hold. This is a very difficult thing. Do you think that Devon's
Pavlo Derbedyenyev: riser or wrist is strong because whenever he came to you a little bit you remember you said come to hook and then he came a little bit and then at that time you you took his wrist but then he pronated out again so do you think that his riser and pronator is helping his wrist a lot his strongest part is pronation
Ermes Gasparini: And also maybe riser as well? Yeah riser but I think me and him more or less we are same the riser but with the straps he have who have more pronation he can you know with the strap open your wrist.
Ermes Gasparini: But with Levan, you feel like to catch something too big and you can't have a good grip. With Levan, if I will very much, I will train my pronation hand like crazy, like when I have autovisuality, and if I can improve the pronation, I can
Ermes Gasparini: have a good grip with him and you know same power maybe here and they feel better but with levan it's very difficult to to grip this is the most difficult part yeah yeah so for levan you need a lot of arm power arm arm like crazy yeah yeah yeah to stop him him somewhere and yeah if you can stop him
Ermes Gasparini: After this, it's not technical like Devon. Devon can move everywhere with the elbow. Lewand is only here. You saw he tried to press him, but he wasn't enough to beat me. I think he couldn't control your pronation. He was all pronated. Yeah, he's too big and doesn't have enough mobility to do more.
Pavlo Derbedyenyev: This time he will be 15 kilos lighter. Do you think it will help his endurance and ability? How much? Like 180? 75. More or less the same, I think. Maybe more endurance, but not too much. I understand, yeah. Okay, before we finish your question, Artem, what is your chance against Ermes in percentage with right arm?
Artyom Morozov: Artem, what percentage, what are your chances against Ermes with the right hand? If I take it today, then I think 60 to 40. You will win. Yes, well, let's not be so categorical. Okay, 50 to 50 for today, given that I haven't prepared yet. But if I prepare, keep me 7.
Pavlo Derbedyenyev (translator): Okay, he's saying that as of right now, it's probably 50-50, but when I'm going to get ready, hold me all together. What do you mean, the last part? Okay, right now, if you pull him right now, he says 50-50.
Pavlo Derbedyenyev (translator): But if he gets ready, and then how much? He said that seven people will have to hold me to prevent that I'm gonna destroy him. Oh, okay. Ah, we need the security. You mean we need the security?
Ermes Gasparini: Yeah, he said it because he's going to destroy you. We have mafia, my friend. It's better than security. I'm joking, I'm joking. What is your chance against him? I think 75, 70, 75%. 70, 75%. So 50%, he says, and when the competition time, people need to hold him because he will just destroy you, you know. Yeah.
Pavlo Derbedyenyev: Listen, you're laughing so much, you seem a little bit scared. No, no. Artyom, this guy told Alizhan that Alizhan is scared of him. Do you agree with that? Artyom, RMS told Alizhan that Alizhan is afraid of him. Is that true? Blin, Alizhan? Blin, knowing Alizhan, I don't think he's afraid of anyone.
Ermes Gasparini: He said, I know Alizhan, he doesn't scare of anybody. I say like this because he don't smile. I don't see him smile. He's too serious. Every time serious, you know. No very good friendly, you don't know. Do you think the people who are smiling, who are laughing are less scared? More relaxed, yes.
Pavlo Derbedyenyev: More relaxed? Relaxed people? It's loud every time. Super relaxed. But people say that's why you lost against Devon. No. Okay. Okay. So I will just write this down and then last question, finish and promise. Ermes, who is winning? Who is winning? What's the percentage? Devon or Devon? Devon or Devon?
Pavlo Derbedyenyev: Levan or Deva? I put 65 of 62 to Levan. 65. Last time I put... Y2. To make sure that I do less Y2. What? Whenever he said 63%, you said Y3. So you said now 62, I said Y2.
Pavlo Derbedyenyev: Ah, 67. Oh, it says 67.33, yeah. 67.5. It's an arm wrestling auction, Artyom says. What's that? Artyom says this is an arm wrestling auction. Auction, yeah, auction, yeah. Oh, you were saying something, Ermes, about that match, and then I stopped you, sorry.
Ermes Gasparini: What were you saying? No problem. Last time I put like 90% to Lewandowski. You remember? Oh, okay. So now Lewandowski has more chance. Oh, yes. A lot. Oh, okay. You remember when we spoke one year, two years ago? Yeah.
Ermes Gasparini: And every time I say Levan we win with 100% like this. Now I think he's a favorite, but not too much. Okay. Yeah, we finished. Exactly one hour and two minutes.
Pavlo Derbedyenyev: And thank you very much, Paolo. And thank you very much. Bye, Paolo. Morozo, the Terminator. Thank you, son. Thank you. And you take care of yourself, Ermes. Thank you for joining. I will remind you guys the match. Yeah, yeah. Put it everywhere. I will put the video everywhere. Yeah, yeah. Everywhere. Take care, guys. Thank you.
