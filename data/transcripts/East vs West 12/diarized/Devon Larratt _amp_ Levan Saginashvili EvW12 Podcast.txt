Engin Terzi: I'm okay. It is almost 1 a.m. here in Georgi times 2 a.m. But that was the time that Devon is available because his daughter had a competition and he is just, this is the time that he could make it. We could do it another time, but just because we announced and later he realized that
Engin Terzi: It's the other day competition, so we just didn't want to confuse the fans, so we said Friday. So we continued Friday, but everything is fine. 1148 there. 0049 here.
Engin Terzi: Oh no, my training thing is in gym. But I'm planning to bring my stuff to home from gym because I don't have time to go to gym. So at least I can do something here. So I wouldn't waste time to go and come back, you know. Even though it's only like 300 or maybe maximum 400 meters from here. Heather Anderson, good evening from Sweden. Hello to Sweden.

Tornike (Translator): Hello Engin, good to see you. Great to see you. I heard that you are coming to Istanbul. That is true, can't wait. Is this the first time that you are? I have been to Istanbul before, but this would be the first time on this large-scale armwrestling event. Okay, okay, okay.
Engin Terzi: so it would be great to meet you in person yes looking forward yeah I I was in Georgi you know yes I saw I saw every video yeah yeah yeah yeah doing doing the best to uh
Engin Terzi: promote the event is it's a big event it's really big event and i i'm really confused as a levan supporter you probably are not confused you are confident with levan this is my guess is that well of course of course i've been following levan for many years even when he uh was competing in in waff and he was still growing uh i've been a fan of sports for
Tornike (Translator): like eight, nine years. But did you know him? Did you know him then? Like personally as a friend? No, personally, I met him in 2019, I think. So right before the pandemic. And no, at that time, I was just a fan watching the sport. Yeah, so seeing how he has grown and how professional he is, I'm sure that he will be in his best shape.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, I'm telling you that self-confidence is very important. To be smart, you know, you can reach somewhere, but to remain there is just requires some confidence and the confidence should be based on intelligence. Like everyone can be, even some ignorant people can be confident, but it is a different thing, you know, but Levan is, yeah. Exactly.
Tornike (Translator): confident and smart guy very smart guy yes yes he doesn't talk too much but he's very calculated yes to get to the top only being strong is not enough only being confident is not enough you have to be professional confident strong and you have you have to have everything perfect so yeah yeah yeah every athlete that we see at your event they're all they're on such a high level
Engin Terzi: that sometimes people forget how long they have been in the sport, how much they have gone through, and how big of a professionals they are. Yeah, they are extraordinary human beings. Yeah, definitely. And in the combat, physical combat sports, like, trust me, intelligence is very, very important because the other person is also, how to say, like,
Engin Terzi: the weaknesses of the opponent where you are good at it your training everything needs to make uh sense you know yeah definitely true yeah so you are in estonia uh at the moment i'm in london and uh i'll be flying from here uh to istanbul oh okay yeah you are there for another month almost
Engin Terzi: yes yes so probably on thursday i'll be there so i want to attend the press conference also yeah that's good that's good yeah i'm just reading the people says 56 55 now uh devil is gonna win and 45 percent levan after after such a dominant performance
Engin Terzi: how why do you think this is this because devon has more fans or do you think also it is because devon progressed a lot and at that time levan had some wrist injury and then do you think that all this just make them believe that uh devon is gonna win this time yeah i think it's a combination that uh first of all of course devon has a huge fan base uh and i fully understand he's a
Tornike (Translator): great athlete, great promoter. And even if we remember the first match back then, the polls were also in favor of Devon, which I can understand. It's partially because they want their athlete to win, and another is being reasonable and calculate who is going to win. So they want Devon to win. They want a good match, and I'm sure it will be one of the best matches that we have ever seen.
Tornike (Translator): um plus i i feel that as event gets closer uh this second time it's there's uh uh more intrigue who's going to be stronger devon had a great winning streak he's in great shape that that's great to see that even at his this age he can progress and uh have so many great performances back to back
Tornike (Translator): And of course, on the Levent's side, it's great to see him back after the injury. And yeah, I think it's a combination of these factors that the polls are in Tevin's favour. Now, I'm not surprised by this. This was the case. But you just said that you believe that it will be a great match. Yes. Yes. So should I think that you believe that it is going to be a tough one compared to the first one?
Engin Terzi: Because the dominance, you know, usually, like, I don't remember Devon versus Levan first match as a great match. I mean, it was a big match, but it was one-sided dominance. But whenever you say that it's going to be, you believe, a great match, do you believe that even you just said that Levan is going to win, do you expect it to be tougher than last time?
Tornike (Translator): I expect it to be slightly tougher. In the first match when Devon got injured, the injury was quite serious and there wouldn't be any possibility for Devon to continue with his maximum ability. And now I think that first of all, Devon has the experience of the first match. He'll be much smarter in the starting position.
Tornike (Translator): uh hopefully won't expose his bicep as much uh before the start of the match because he will expect levan to surge with huge power uh as before so i i'm hoping that there will not be an injury this time uh this way this will be a tougher and more interesting match but in my mind i see that uh
Tornike (Translator): It might not be one second match, but it should be over quite quickly. So you expect dominance again? I expect dominance. I think there will be a sticking point, maybe a couple of inches above the pad. There should be a sticking point. But I think Levan is versatile and he can finish the job. Maybe two or three surges at maximum.
Engin Terzi: But I think he can do that. There's a super chat. Top list for smart engine. Recently, we speak so much about risk. How about arm strength between these two? Do we forget that the one is actually too strong? My friend, this is what I am saying that like arm strength, but they both go outside. They both pronate, even though if Levan
Engin Terzi: goes to the pimp and he goes without like like by pronating so where is he attacking you know arm strength yes arm strength but just there there is a hand that needs to control that if that wrist handles then there is a chance but if the wrist fails so that that's why we talk about the wrist
Engin Terzi: Yeah, so I understand your point. You are saying that Levan is going to win. It's not going to be sold out, but it is going to be a little harder than last time. This is what you're saying. I expect it that way, yes. But we shouldn't forget that Levan is not one surge guy. He has fought many lengthy rounds. He can do several heavy hits.
Engin Terzi: mm-hmm and then go into the lengthy matches also sorry one said dylan uh you are now uh disrespecting you know levan even if anybody is disrespecting like you're disrespecting levan if it even if it is to the devil uh my friend uh i will block it right now i will only remove uh this message and then if you do again i promise i will block you um
Engin Terzi: So just respect these guys. These guys don't deserve as an athlete. Their personality, this and that, it's just like, it is totally up to the people. Some likes that guy, some likes this guy. But they are right now my host, and I wouldn't want you to disrespect these guys, you understand? Yeah. Not at my home, you know. Anyway, so...
Engin Terzi: Yeah, I went there. It was great. Great experience and not so much difference culturally, you know. Yes. Yeah. I mean, the friendship, warm, everything, you know, just like, yeah. And, you know, that we people sometimes ask me, why you went to Georgi? Why you don't go to Canada? To go to Georgi, I don't need visa.
Engin Terzi: I don't need invitation. I don't need even passport. I took my Turkish ID and came. The same, those guys come to Istanbul with just their Georgi ID, you know, like looks like I'm traveling from one city to another city, you know. Yes. So to go to Canada, you need the invitation, you need to apply sometimes three, four months of process, you know. Yeah. Anyway, so somebody's coming. Let's see who came.
Engin Terzi: okay the champion here east versus west super heavyweight world champion oh we got a couple people in the chat what's going on guys the light is coming behind you hard to see your face yeah okay okay i'm gonna i'll move yeah it's totally up this way it's good yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah now it's better yeah now it's better yeah oh good day today good day your your daughter won
Devon Larratt: She won everything, yeah. Yeah, she's a junior and she won right and left in the juniors and she entered the seniors and she won right and left in the seniors. So, totally, totally kicked ass. Totally kicked ass. Larratt's family has been headache for the rest of the world. Larratt seems to be...
Engin Terzi: Yes, yes. Good, good. Looking good. Get used to that. Get used to that, Levan. I didn't expect that one. No. Choke on rocks. Beautiful Jersey chemistry in the back. This is the back I showed you. And then I need to concentrate my... Yes, yeah. I don't know if you can see, but... Yeah. Anyway, so... Okay. How are you, Levan?
Engin Terzi: Very good. Long time no see you. Yes. How are you? Good, good, good. How is everything? Good. How are you, Devon? Massive, massive, massive. Is this light better? Is this okay? Is it shiny? It's shiny, huh?
Devon Larratt: little bit light is coming but it's okay you know better than the other one yeah yeah you see how big i've gotten lavon big big big like little dense bigger than dennis bigger bigger than dennis yeah oh big
Devon Larratt: Big. Yeah. Yeah. It's okay though. It's okay. It's okay. I won't get too much bigger. Maybe only 25 more pounds. 25 more pounds. Yes. It goes. Oh, it was those jobs.
Devon Larratt: I don't know what to do. Too big. Too big. One sec. Okay. What does he say? Yeah, he's saying that... Yeah. How is your wrist? It's good. Oh.
Devon Larratt: How is your wrist, LeVon? Very nice. Very nice? Very strong. Like strong like a ballerina? No, no. No? Strong like Secretary? Like Rocky Balboa. Rocky Balboa? Small Rocky Balboa. Rocky Balboa not big.
Devon Larratt: Actually, Rocky Balboa, very cool guy. Well, me now, LaVon, remember last time you saw me? Two times as big. Now, now, I've been lying about my weight. I'm sorry.
Tornike (Translator): I've not been telling the truth. Now, 315 pounds. That's bad news for you because lighter weight, you have more chance. Now you're definitely lost. No, no. See this? You have this?
Tornike (Translator): Not just any eggs. Pickled eggs. That's it. I surrender. Pickled eggs go right there.
Devon Larratt: right to the bicep i'm sorry i had to do it lavon i had to i did not have choice you're too strong i had to do it maybe maybe for the rematch you tried pickled eggs
Tornike (Translator): He's saying... He's saying, take care of your health, be cautious, stay healthy before the 20th of April. I'm so healthy. I'm so healthy now that I go when a baby is sick and dying or when old people or when somebody has an injury, I give them some of my blood and they're healthy again.
Tornike (Translator): Just like that. He doesn't believe it. It's true. Is it possible for you to turn your phone sideways, if possible? Now I'll begin.
Devon Larratt: Yes, yes, yes, yes. Because you don't you don't fit in the camera. Yeah, go ahead though. Everybody keeps messaging me. Telling me that when I beat you, it won't count because you're injured. And that you're about. And that you're about 10 or 20% off of your best form. It's making me a little bit sad.
Tornike (Translator): I would say that if you win, it doesn't matter. If you lose 10-20%, that's fine. It doesn't matter. If you win, that's a victory. So, it counts. No, that's my problem. If I win, that's my problem. If I win, that's my problem.
Tornike (Translator): Yeah, that's something I should worry about because I should be in my best shape. If I can't perform, that's up to me. That's my responsibility. Okay. Okay. Hmm. Another question. Did you get your name stamped on the hammer yet? .
Tornike (Translator): I'm exercising so much that I can't find time to get it done. But I will find time and I will write my name on it, but it still will remain with me. I would ask you guys to...
Engin Terzi: Focus on the East versus West belt that the competition that you guys are organizing. I'm organizing and I want to read some of the Super Chats. In the name of Devon, support from Bengal, India. Oh. And... Yeah. I'm ready. Not bad, not bad, LeVar, not bad.
Levan Saginashvili: Levan, there is a question for you, GB19. Levan, how close to your peak will you be on Apple 20s? What do you think about Apple 20s and Apple 20s? I think it's a good question. I think it's a good question. I think it's a good question. I think it's a good question. I think it's a good question. I think it's a good question. I think it's a good question.
Levan Saginashvili: The last exercises were so heavy and I had some other stuff to do, but the remaining time
Devon Larratt: I will be relaxed, working even heavier, and it will be the best shape ever. They gave you a thumbs down. You see that? Facebook knows when you're lying. They know. See? You cannot trick. You cannot trick the computer. I saw that. There is another one. DNO Align is asking you. Do I get to answer that question too?
Levan Saginashvili: One second. Love you, Levan. How does it feel to be coming up on your first professional loss? Yeah.
Tornike (Translator): I don't know that feeling. That feeling is so far in my life in the future that I don't care about it. Not very far away now. Not very far away, Levan.
Engin Terzi: Why do I get to answer the same question as Levan? How come I don't get to answer these questions? Because they are the Super Chess are not asking you. They want to match with Levan. They want to match with Levan, I think. These are your fans. Asking Barak Zayi, Levan, what do you think you have to do in the first round to crush any hope Devon might have of winning? Well, it's good stuff, dude.
Tornike (Translator): I will just take my position. Of course, he will be struggling before the referee says go, trying everything. But as soon as the referee gives command, his hand will very quickly go to the pad.
Tornike (Translator): Is it faster than last time? Maybe even faster, yes. Yeah, but the first time it was still fast, so we have to account for that.
Engin Terzi: How come I don't get to answer the questions, Engin? Is this the LeBron talk show? They're not asking you. What can I do? Who's in charge here? Do I have to give a super chat and ask myself questions? Yeah, yeah. They're asking you. Okay. I'm creating imaginary question. During the interview that LeBron had with Engin, LeBron said that on the round six,
Devon Larratt: is going to hold you like this, look at your face, and you're going to give up. You're going to pin yourself. And what do you think about this? That was great. I love that part. That part made me super, super happy. I think that when you look at like what's possible and what's not, wow. If you did that, LeVon, I would be really impressed. Very, very impressed. You know,
Devon Larratt: LeVon, you know, I'm impressed. But I would be very impressed if you were able to do that. I really have. I really have good shape. LeVon, I'm so much stronger this time. I'm so much stronger. Like imagine like my best shape was like the ground. And now my shape is climbed to the top of the mountain.
Devon Larratt: And on that mountain, there's a tree on top of the mountain, and I climb on top of that. And then way off in the distance, I see a star. And it's like five galaxies past the star is way, way far away. Not I'm not, I'm not even the same species anymore, LeVon. I'm not even a human being anymore.
Devon Larratt: I'm like a space alien. I'm not, I'm like not even one person. I'm probably a thousand people living in one body. And I've been like altered. I've become like a Frankenstein monster. Frankenstein. No, no, I can't so much. Frankenstein. You can't so much.
Levan Saginashvili: Do you want me to find you a weaker opponent? Yes, find me normal. This is Frankenstein. You can pull, next East versus West, you can pull Arsene at 115.
Devon Larratt: Seriously, no joking around. No joke. No joke around. Very seriously. I think since last time I pulled you, it's probably maybe 12 or 13%. 12 or 13%, maybe 14%. Maybe. And since I pulled Dennis, since Dennis,
Levan Saginashvili: I'm very happy that you're stronger.
Devon Larratt: The first time around, you were quite weak and you being stronger now, this makes me happy. This makes me excited and motivated. So I'm just happier now. That makes me happy that you're happy. When you're happy, I'm happy too. In fact, I'm so happy. I'm going to eat this block of cheese also. The more happy I get, the more I eat.
Levan Saginashvili: Maybe when I come, I had 325 pounds. Well, maybe you have these, you have these live on. You like that? Oh, this is you want me to cancel the match? Terrible.
Devon Larratt: Oh, wow. Hey, same brand Activia. Hey, listen, you know how some people, when they go to school and they're wearing the same clothes and the people are like, did you talk about this? Lavon, did we talk about this? We didn't talk about this. Both eating pickles, both eating yogurt, but I have cheese.
Engin Terzi: And I have pickled eggs. Devon, there is a question for you about that. It is . Devon, oranges and pickled eggs. Is this psychological warfare on the stream? You know, this is just me doing what I have to do, okay? I do a couple things. I train, I eat, and I sleep.
Tornike (Translator): And I think, I dream, I dream about everything. I've dreamt about it a lot, Devon. Have you thought about it? It's good that you're dreaming. That's probably all you got left. What do your dreams tell you?
Levan Saginashvili: It's just a matter of time before all the matches are over. But you can do it twice, four times, but you can do it three times. And as you know, every match is worth two years. One year is a long time. One year is a long time, but it's a long time.
Tornike (Translator): Well, yeah, speaking seriously now, before every large match, I have seen a dream. This could be two months prior or maybe a month prior. And I don't want to scare you, but just a couple of weeks ago, I had a dream. I crushed you against 6-0, so sorry about that. Really? I don't believe you. I think you're making it up.
Devon Larratt: I will win so much that you will be happy at the end. I will make you happy. It does make me happy when you beat me. I'm not going to lie. I've always been looking for somebody who's very strong, who can beat me. And you did a good job last time. But because I'm so happy...
Devon Larratt: I need to tell you the truth. It's very important that I tell you the truth. Last time we faced each other, I kind of knew that you might be too much. I'm going to beat you this time, LeVon. I need to tell you that.
Devon Larratt: And the only reason that I'm able to beat you now is because you beat me last time. It's because of the way you beat me that I have become today so great.
Levan Saginashvili: And for some reason, it was clear to me that this was one of the reasons why I chose you. No, it was clear to me that I had a lot of motivation. That's why I chose you. Now I have a new motivation. And then there are developments.
Tornike (Translator): I know that I motivated you last time and this time around there will be some more motivation for you. You can again go for some good streak of victories and if you need top up for your motivation or the strength, you're always welcome.
Levan Saginashvili: Is there anything in life, Devon, that makes you sad?
Levan Saginashvili: It makes me sad when I see a person defeated after our match. I'm a kind person at heart, but
Tornike (Translator): I don't want to see a defeated person who's broken down after the match. So I would say that makes me sad. Is that why you've come into this match so weak? To give me the opportunity to defeat you? Is this why?
Levan Saginashvili: No, I don't know. I can say that I don't believe it because I don't believe it. The reality is that it can happen. You can have a very big psychological trauma. You can't just go to bed and wake up. You can also say that, in our opinion,
Tornike (Translator): I would advise you not to hope too much on my weakness because when the reality hits you, it will be such a shock that you might not be prepared for that. So just my advice is that don't believe that I'm weak. And yeah, that's the only hope you got. I have another question for you, Devon. I have another question.
Devon Larratt: He's been watching your videos lately and just needs to know why is the Christmas tree still up? Oh, it's always Christmas here. Yeah. Every day I get presents. I'm so lucky. I don't know what I did.
Devon Larratt: to be so lucky, but every day there's presence underneath the tree and I just don't want to take it down. I don't want the presence to stop coming. Yeah, OK. But I thought it was some kind of ritual. No, it's just I just keep getting presents, so I just don't want the presence to stop. But. You know,
Devon Larratt: I get so happy when I know I'm strong. Like, when I look at my hands, sometimes I look at my hands and I just think, wow, that's amazing. You know? Do you look at your hands? Do you? Be careful with that thought. Not to get diverted somewhere. I mean, I just think,
Devon Larratt: wow is there anybody who can match this now don't forget the 500 club we don't need to talk about that this there's kids that watch this channel okay and i think it was 800 so yeah we don't need to bring that up ever ever again look
Devon Larratt: Are you on a diet right now, Levan? No. No? But you don't eat very much. No, no. Not very much. No. I find that...
Engin Terzi: I'm eating probably more than you. I think maybe more. Devon, there is a super chat for you. Artur is asking, Devon, we know Devon is a strong guy, but what is your strategy and major improvement to win this time? Which fan here from Brazil? I think it's my hand.
Devon Larratt: And that's what you needed, right? The riser especially? I think it's my hand. My hand might be a problem. It might be a problem. I don't know, Levan. Seriously, you know I'm very impressed by you. I just see. I watch very closely. I watch everything very, very close.
Levan Saginashvili: No, it's not like that. It's just that I'm very happy to be able to do something. I'm very happy to be able to do something. I'm very happy to be able to do something. I'm very happy to be able to do something. I'm very happy to be able to do something.
Levan Saginashvili: I respect the path you have taken after our first match. All the victories and the overall path you have taken.
Tornike (Translator): that's respectful and that actually motivates me a lot to train and to bring my best shape. And overall it was a great performance and I'm happy that you have done this. Thank you, Devon. Thank you for raising the bar.
Levan Saginashvili: Yeah, but unfortunately, the streak will be over soon. Do you really think so? Yeah. Really? You said during the interview, you said that
Engin Terzi: You take Devon so seriously and that is why you are training so hard for him. Correct? Yes. Yes. Yeah. So it means that you are taking him seriously. You see him as a threat. You don't, I saw how serious you are training four hours, five hours. It means that he is a worthy opponent.
Devon Larratt: Yeah. And there is a question for you. IG is asking, Devon, what is the meaning of true masculinity? And what does it take to be a man? Well, I guess first you have to ask, is there a difference between being a man and a woman? Is the question, what does it mean to be a human? I think is the first question. And then I suppose to be a man, I think that
Devon Larratt: everything that you need to know can be uh everything you need to know can be learned by watching nature so when you look at animals it's often easier to know what a person is by watching animals
Devon Larratt: And what is the role of the male? It's the fight. The role the role of the male is to protect the role of the male is to be the first one to respond in times of danger. And, you know, when you look at male qualities, it's the ability to fight is one of the highest highest orders. One of the highest orders that is different from being a woman.
Devon Larratt: there are similar qualities between men and women but i believe that fighting lies predominantly with the male gender predominantly in terms of you know outward threats because we know inside the house the fight is often won by the woman but when it comes to going out and fighting yeah that is what makes in various simple terms a man i suppose
Engin Terzi: There is Fight Me Prudnik in that shop is looking nice, my friends. His name is Fight Me Prudnik. Okay. And thank you, my friend. Thank you. Yeah, it's versus 12. There is also a red one on this. GB19, is Devon concerned about no auto strap this time? Like, are you concerned that he may not let you go strap? The truth is the rules suit me better.
Devon Larratt: That's actually the truth. Can you explain? Can I explain? Yeah, like how? Wow. You don't want to? I prefer you use your imagination, but I'll tell you it's to my advantage. And all you need to do is study arm wrestling. You just need to study arm wrestling and look at a few things. Why don't you just watch? Just go back in history a little bit. It's to my advantage.
Devon Larratt: The no strap rule. The rules of East versus West actually suit me more in terms of victory. I don't want to talk about what's better for the sport, but in terms of me winning, East versus West rules are to my advantage. Okay, there is another question. Devon, will you... I cannot read your name, my friend. It is different alphabet. Devon, will you retire after this win? No. You will not retire? No.
Engin Terzi: What a crazy idea is that? Retire and do what? D-N-O-L-I-N. Thank you, my friend. Again, love you, Levan, but try as you might. You will lose all the same. There was win is inevitable. Like Thanos. Thanos. Thanos or Thanos? Whatever, yeah. He says, and then I will read one more and then we can continue. Isn't it crazy, Levan, how everybody thinks I'm going to win?
Tornike (Translator): isn't it crazy this is 55 on the pole why is that you you're like a magician you should you should to form some cult and people will follow you i haven't done that already
Levan Saginashvili: I don't think so. Levan, does this magician have any effect on you? No, in fact, all magicians are different, but I don't think anyone is different from me. I think everyone is different.
Tornike (Translator): His magic probably affects his other opponents, but for myself, I enjoyed so much his talks, his ranting, and that actually, I enjoyed that a lot.
Tornike (Translator): especially when I'm his opponent, I'm just having fun. So it doesn't affect me and it doesn't affect me badly. I still have questions. I still have questions. Can we talk about Ermes? Was Ermes difficult for you? No. No?
Levan Saginashvili: It wasn't difficult to beat Ermes. Other things were difficult. What was difficult?
Tornike (Translator): My health at that time wasn't at best, but I fixed that, so that's not a factor anymore. When was it in the fight when things went wrong? At the moment of the fight, it was at the moment of the fight.
Levan Saginashvili: Even before I went to the table, I wasn't feeling my best.
Tornike (Translator): the heart rate. I wasn't at my best health at that moment. And even considering I managed to win with that condition, that seems so much stronger. Your friend, your friend with the water bottle, is he going to be there this time?
Levan Saginashvili: Is he going to be there? His name is Giga. I know him. Is he coming? No, I think so. Not invited anymore? He actually won a competition in Italy throwing a disc or something like that.
Tornike (Translator): Give him my best regards next time you talk to him. He's asking, how did your daughter do as I know she was competing? Incredible. Incredible. Perfect. Perfect.
Engin Terzi: Perfect. There is another question. Fight me, Prudnik. Devon, when you see Devon at the East Coast Express, please go to him with a straight face and tell him that he has baby hands. You must do this for us. It only works if you do it with a straight face. I think Devon's hands have gotten smaller. That's what it looks like to me. That's why I was asking about the hands earlier. I'm sorry.
Levan Saginashvili: That's why I was asking. Smaller hands. Drinking. Now you're definitely wrong. Actually, I have a present for you. A present? Yes. I love presents. Oh, look. What's that? This is his hand. Is that the miniature version?
Engin Terzi: Let me see if I have mine around here somewhere. I think I have mine around here somewhere. And now bring this with me in Istanbul. Levan, that wrist is a little bit cracked. Show me again. Show me that again. The hole in the wrist.
Tornike (Translator): Can you see this bone of mine? Even with the crack, even if I crack the wrist back, it's still straight. It's like dislocated. It looks like you need to see a doctor. It doesn't look healthy. It looks like it's in the wrong place. Thank you.
Tornike (Translator): Actually, the doctor told me that I have broken it some long time ago. Maybe Devon did it, I don't know. I have another question. Go ahead. Do you remember in Florida,
Devon Larratt: When we ate the ice cream, do you remember the night before when we were sitting at the table and I grabbed your left hand? Did you think I could beat you?
Tornike (Translator): Maybe you can beat me, but you just can't believe it. I definitely believe it now. I definitely, definitely believe it. I don't believe that you believe.
Devon Larratt: Devon, I like you very much, and I tell you the truth. I'm telling you the 100% truth. The score will either be 4-1 or 4-0 for me, and you will not return for rounds five and six.
Devon Larratt: when I beat you six zero I can even ask Travis on the stage and beat him too just for fun of it Travis Travis Travis why would you ask Travis on the stage well he's he's your fan he supports you a lot oh that's right he said he was gonna be he said I was gonna beat you right yeah well
Devon Larratt: maybe maybe travis will train up and join the fight maybe but levon i really i really want you to take some time i need you to realize it will be 4-1 for me or i don't know or four zero
Devon Larratt: Maybe four zero. Things will not work the way you want them to. You will not feel comfortable. You will be struggling in the setup. You will not feel the way you did last time. You will have a sense of unease. You will be panicking. Your heart will be racing. You will be breathing.
Levan Saginashvili: And then you will lose control. Sort of like after a long practice with a rack lead, nothing left. Nothing left. Early. Very early. Unlike you, when you practice with,
Levan Saginashvili: with some small children. I, on the other hand, I'm practicing with the world's champions. There's not even a comparison. You know, I don't think that... Where do you find your sparring opponents?
Devon Larratt: We're having random people on the street though. Brandon, drug using, homeless, helpless souls, just like myself. We all get together and we become something much greater. And you see, I don't need to train with the world champion. I just need to train with a great human being.
Devon Larratt: And arm wrestling practice is not about who's so strong. I do that in the gym. I need to train with smart, good people, good energy, good energy. Practice is about good energy exchange. I train with world champion. It can be a terrible practice. I train with a good person, good practice. Ottawa High Hookers, greatest team, greatest team on the planet. Greatest team on the planet, Ottawa High Hookers. This is very good.
Tornike (Translator): That's very good. I'm happy for you, but that way you will just remain good yourself. Just good. Perhaps that is all I will ever be. But to get stronger, you have to train with the strong ones. Devon, you taught me a lesson.
Devon Larratt: When I teach you a lesson, I will welcome you with open arms to the greatest club in the world. Have you forgotten the name of your teacher? Sometimes it's the student who once again becomes a teacher. Sometimes that happens. And Devon, I've been watching. You went on vacation. I didn't stop.
Devon Larratt: You, you went and did a movie, you got married or something. I don't know if you've, if you've got babies coming now. Yeah. You kind of took it easy. Me went hard since I saw you last. I never stopped. Not for a day. You, you went on vacation. You went, you did dancing with the stars. You did, you did, uh, all sorts of talk shows me.
Devon Larratt: In the trenches. In the trenches. Can you imagine how strong I am? I can do all of those things, but still beat you. You're not as strong as you were, Devon, and everybody knows it. Everybody knows it. That's the truth. And you know it too. Devon, I have a question for you.
Devon Larratt: Do your preparation depend on Levan being weaker than last time? Or you are prepared to beat best of Levan? I believe that what I'm bringing to the table now against Levan that I faced the last time will be a very interesting match. So he needs to be that. He needs to be that. Do you believe that he is there now? No.
Engin Terzi: And do you believe that he can be there till April 20th? No. So that's why you think you're going to win 4-0? Yes. And is it going to be a boring match? No. No, it'll be extremely difficult. But listen, if you are beating him four times, you believe that every round you will be beating him difficult way? Or every round is going to get easier? Before he quits, he will submit.
Devon Larratt: So he will stop me. It's like a giant bull. It's like riding a bull. The bull is stronger than you, but eventually the bull gets tired and he doesn't throw you off. The first time is 12 seconds. The next time is 10 seconds. The next time is eight seconds. The next time is three seconds. The next time he doesn't even get out the door. And another question, are you guys going to go full speed rounds no matter what or not? You don't need to ask me that question.
Levan Saginashvili: If you are winning, just say 4-0, will you continue 5-6? Or if you are losing? Well, if he breaks his arm again, what's the point? But sure. I hope you do. I hope you do.
Tornike (Translator): I will win so much that all the people who are questioning my strength or anybody who thinks that I'm weaker now, all of their jaws will drop and we'll just watch with an open mouth.
Devon Larratt: How can you say these things? How can you say them when the facts are right in front of us? How can you say these things when the facts are right there? We see the weights. We see the weights. They are not the same. You know they're not the same. You know at this point in your preparation you are not where you were. And you see me...
Tornike (Translator): The problem is that you believe what you see. Is there something that's being hidden? Are you hiding something from us? You must be mistaken.
Levan Saginashvili: You will be very disappointed. Really? Because if this is true, you are a very good actor. You are a very, very good actor.
Devon Larratt: you will shrink so much that you just get lost in the green hoodie the green hoodie gives me great strength it's uh it's one of my secrets to power levon you know that's sort of like your oxygen tank
Engin Terzi: I have a question for Levan. Levan just said that it doesn't show everything. If you are going to say this, what was the point of not showing everything? Because if you want people to think
Engin Terzi: But by saying this, now people, okay, he's going against what he intended to do, because he wanted to show it that way, and now he's saying that he's not like that. So what should we understand? Because if he's showing himself weak, and now he's saying that he did that intentionally, then what was the point of doing the other training?
Tornike (Translator): There are as many cracks in your story, Devon, as there are in your wrist.
Tornike (Translator): I want him and his fans to have hope. Yeah, but you just killed the hopes now. This is just an intrigue. This is just an intrigue. They can keep hoping. But how? He just said that he was just faking. He did all this to make them have hope. When you say this now, they don't have hope anymore.
Levan Saginashvili: Well, Devon is not believing it. So the plan seems to be working. Oh, okay. So you are saying that Devon still believes it. So it means that his fans will believe no matter what.
Engin Terzi: He just lost a tiny bit of confidence just now. Oh. So who is winning? Who is winning with these perception games? Okay. In the poll right now, almost 3,000. Six more people. Okay. 2,997 people voted. Almost 3,000. And then 45% says Levan is winning. 55% says Devon is winning. And I end this one and I ask, who is winning there?
Devon Larratt: perception game anything you want to add answer to the one while i do that devon you know there are many different types of warfare there is warfare that takes place in the shadows but the bravest and most open war is the one where you wave a flag and you stand your ground and that's what i have done
Devon Larratt: I have been open about everything. I have waved a flag. I have shown. I have opened the kimono. And apparently my warfare is so powerful that Devon has chosen to use the shadow route, fighting me with tricks. I'm trying to use magic himself, lying and deceiving. It's not like you, Devon, to stoop to this level. I know that you are a greater champion than this.
Devon Larratt: You can speak the truth, not just to me, but to your family and your team and the greater community. Just tell people the truth, LeVon. Show us how strong you are. Show us the 100-kilogram wrist curl. Show us the 100-kilogram wrist curl. Let's see the wrist curl. Let's see the bicep curl. Let's see the 135-kilo bicep curl, just like the old times.
Devon Larratt: show us show everybody who cares about you don't live in the shadows don't live in the shadows come I'm not using alternate tactics I'm not trying to sneak up on you I'm showing you everything look look no matter how much you try your wrist will never be this big
Devon Larratt: It's not always just about how big you are, Devon, you flubbery belly man. I'm way bigger than you. I'm way bigger than you and you know it. Interesting, interesting. Whenever he said that,
Engin Terzi: Levan said that Devon knows that he cannot beat me. He's coming to lose, he said. And now you are saying that he knows that you are bigger than him. You mean that you're going to beat him also. So who really believes what? I don't understand that part. Who really believes? Levan, does Devon really believe that he's going to beat you? No. No. He knows he is.
Levan Saginashvili: They would answer him. He lost right at the moment when he found out he will be having a match with me. Right at the moment he lost. You think so? Are you sure?
Levan Saginashvili: All this preparation time, he's trying to convince himself to believe that he has a chance. But deep in his heart, he knows that he can't.
Levan Saginashvili: What happened with that guy from, what is it, Romania? Who's that guy, Sabin Badalescu? What happened in that match? Oh, 2017. I remember the match in 2017. Oh, he was really good. He was really good. Now he's so good that I can't believe it. Now he's really good.
Tornike (Translator): This is just a pity now. Going back to my 2017 match, that's the last throw. There seems that you have nothing left to say. So my last loss is so far away, back in 2017, that you had to brought that up. Do you even remember what you were doing in 2017? What happened with Ermes Gasparini when he made you quit?
Devon Larratt: And maybe you forget defeating yourself in the weight room not so long ago where you broke yourself. It's a curse of many great champion, Devon. You're not the first champion to beat himself.
Tornike (Translator): You just lost your train of thought. You just need to take a pill now. That'll be Monday. Monday I take another pill.
Levan Saginashvili: Are your hands shaking already or not yet? You do know I'm going to beat you, right? You do know, right? I try to believe, but I just can't. I want to apologize. I'm sorry.
Devon Larratt: I'm sorry. I'm sorry to your training partners. I'm sorry to your family. I'm sorry to your fans. I'm sorry to the people of Georgi. I'm sorry to the people who bet on you. I'm sorry. I did not want to hurt any of you. Just LaVon was in the way. I'm sorry.
Engin Terzi: There is a super chat. Davit Thomas. When Devon stops Devon and takes his wrist, it will be the beginning of the end for Devon. And then you wake up. Do you actually know that this match is going to happen, Devon? Do you actually realize you're actually going to pull me? No, I can't.
Engin Terzi: maybe then okay there is a there is a good question for devon wake up his name devon i'm rooting for you but what makes you think you will crack levan's wrist if you couldn't crack george's wrist look at the only reason george's wrist didn't crack is because he gave up george's wrist would have cracked he just stopped arm wrestling
Devon Larratt: would have cracked like anybody else but he just gave up i had to give him a pile driver you remember that i'll drive a pile driver oh can you imagine levon do you know my new move no have you seen the pile driver when the guy gives up he goes like
Engin Terzi: Okay, I can beat you that way if you like it. Okay, Jay Rock, Devon, all you have to do is go into this match the same way you do against Denis. Obviously, not the same person, but that mindset is the key.
Tornike (Translator): Do you believe in special days, Devon? Special days? Yeah, there are many special days in life. Do you think that 420 is a special day?
Tornike (Translator): Not really. It's not so special to me anymore. I have done this once and I will do it twice. So you do not see the significance of the date?
Tornike (Translator): So much of having a great day is understanding the energy of the day and harnessing it. 420 belongs to the Ottawa high hookers, just so you know. It belongs to us. It's our day. The whole Ottawa club
Devon Larratt: can get together and you still can't pull me. Oh, Levan, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Levan. I'm sorry to your mother. I'm sorry to your father. I'm sorry to Irakli. I'm sorry to that little dude who's always rubbing you on the back and stuff. I'm sorry to him. I'm sorry to Tbilisi. I'm sorry to your new wife. I'm sorry.
Devon Larratt: I'm sorry. I feel bad already. I'm sorry, Devon. She can't beat you. Look. That's him. Yeah. Yeah. Devon, why do you have such a little dog? What do you do with such a little dog? Okay, question. Louis, question for Devon.
Devon Larratt: what are the fundamentals of achieving personal success as well as success as a father and a husband what are uh what are the oh geez that's a tough question what are the fundamentals of success to have good success as a as a father and a husband is that what you asked yeah oh that's a difficult question um i think that uh the
Devon Larratt: the best answer I can give and I think I'm probably probably a better arm wrestler than I am those things. But I would say that to the best I would say that you need to have many characteristics that you focus on the the primarily primary ones are are unconditional loves. I think that this is probably one of the most important things
Devon Larratt: Unconditional love of those around you, charity, forgiveness, um, understanding that we're all one thing is very important. Understanding that those who come after us are the priority always. I think that these are the important things to be apparent. I think that this is very important to understand that you become secondary.
Devon Larratt: um and it's about a transfer of energy a transfer of energy i think that this is the key to being a good parent is finding a way during your life to transfer all your energy before you die to the next generation to give everything you don't want to have every anything left over when you die you want to have it all given away this is important
Engin Terzi: There is another one. Message for Devon. We need a story time drawing of the story of Devon climbing the mountain and stopping while he sleeps overnight during the journey to do pronation exercises. That's a good idea. That is a great idea. Yeah. Anyway, so Levan, during the interview, you said that
Engin Terzi: uh in during the first match you were two times stronger than uh devon in first match um you were serious or you were joking uh that's how it felt maybe even more okay and during the
Engin Terzi: In Gennady's interview, Gennady said that what he felt from Devon, he said that you would be favourites. Devon 60%, Devon 40%. But he also said that if Devon gets 10% stronger than the time that he pulled Gennady, he would think that Devon would be favourites. What do you think about this? Gennady said that Shenkhar is the favourite, Devon is 3%, Devon is 2%.
Tornike (Translator): He can take all 50%. He still doesn't have a chance. 10 isn't enough. That's what he meant. You know, armies gave me 1% chance. 1%. 1%.
Levan Saginashvili: 40 is much bigger than one. You're just wrong with the numbers. After the pills, you're just wrong with the numbers. I think the pills are making me smarter. I'm going to beat you. I'm sorry.
Devon Larratt: I like you. I'm sorry. I didn't want to beat you this badly. I didn't want to hurt you, Devon. I didn't want to hurt you. I didn't want, but I have to. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't want to break you. I didn't want to see you hurt.
Devon Larratt: You see that movie? I didn't want to see you get discouraged. I don't want to see you quit the sport. I'm sorry, Wilson. You're younger than me. You still have many great years ahead of you. You have many great years. Devon't take this loss as the reason to retire. You're still a great champion. It doesn't affect me. That doesn't affect me. You can keep going. What doesn't affect you? What is it that doesn't affect you?
Engin Terzi: You're wasting your time. I have nothing but time, Devon. My schedule is clear. I've cleared my schedule for you. It's just you, buddy. It's just you and me. Devon, there is a question. The armless increase. The guy is asking what you would think about his opinion that
Engin Terzi: Once Devon beats you, he becomes the greatest all the time, all the time. And no one else has a claim for a long time. So he, the guy said, Devon is going to beat you and he will become the God and nobody will be close to him for a long time. What do you think about this? We can build the church.
Tornike (Translator): put an icon of devon there and just beat our heads in georgia can we can we build it in georgia can we build it together devon is great but arm wrestling has the goat it's john
Engin Terzi: I agree. There is one question. They're asking, a Turkish guy just asked, what does Levan and Devon thinks about Istanbul and the people from Turkey?
Levan Saginashvili: Thank you very much. I would like to thank all the speakers, the audience, the audience, the audience, the audience, and the audience.
Levan Saginashvili: All the Turkish people I know, they are so great, reliable, true to their words.
Tornike (Translator): I love Turkey, I love Istanbul, the environment, the food, everything. So he's very fond of it. Also, I enjoy football a lot and Turkey has many great football players.
Engin Terzi: who I have watched many, many times. Yeah. And Superboy is asking, Levan, you are strong champion. Devon probably can't even beat Prime Denis. Beating you is just a dream. Beating you is just a dream.
Levan Saginashvili: If you are not in that person's prime, that person is the problem. If you are not in that person's prime, I mean, if you want to get rid of it, you are the one who will have to go to the doctor and get it done, right? If you are not in that person's prime, that person is not your problem. Right? If you are not in that person's prime, you can go and get it done.
Tornike (Translator): All that theoretical discussions about who's in prime or who's not, it doesn't matter. When the person agrees to the match, it's his responsibility to bring his prime game to the table. If he can't do it, he's the one responsible, not his opponent. It's not his opponent. Levan, there is a super set. Davit turns after Devon beats you.
Tornike (Translator): Will you want a rematch? Once I beat him, I want one more match, yes. That wasn't the question, Levan. Pay attention. Pay attention. Every two years, we can have a match. Pay attention to the questions, Levan. And I will make him stronger this week.
Devon Larratt: Devon, I suggest that after I beat you, before we have a rematch, you go and buy a bigger dog. Okay? Your dog is too small. I have a bigger dog than you. We have a rematch. Buy a bigger dog. Yeah. With such a small dog that you have, it's impossible for you to beat Devon. Impossible. I thought I was going to say you should be here at the photo.
Tornike (Translator): He's small, but he bites so much. Like little bites, little tiny little bites. Yeah. One of the best editors, Konstantin Konstantinos, also had such a tiny, tiny white dog. Yeah. It was so funny to see him. Elnuf Said, does Levan think he would beat Devon even if he loses his wrist? Does Devon think Levan can beat him without his wrist?
Tornike (Translator): I can beat him even without my arm, just with my mind. Just stand there and I can beat him.
Devon Larratt: this is incredible have you ever watched the ryan bowen delusional series i just see your head i can't even see your arms yeah yes levon i'm bigger than you i eat you i'm bigger i eat you no levon i'm bigger than you i'm bigger
Engin Terzi: I need to tell something. He was eating King Kali. And every time he was eating, he was saying Devon. Devon, he was eating. And then two minutes later, he started. It's like the story of Moby Dick. It's like the story of Moby Dick. Let's start a fire inside you. Catch you on fire from the inside.
Engin Terzi: yeah okay mr brian brian junkie doesn't levan know about the devon curse whoever beats devon will get injured and then gets beaten by devon later
Devon Larratt: Is it really a curse? Things seem to repeat themselves over and over and over. This is just, uh, some things are inevitable. It's just the way it's supposed to be.
Devon Larratt: I'm sorry, Levan. I'm sorry. I want to apologize to all the people of Georgi. Everyone from the East, I'm sorry for destroying your champion. Levan, is there any possibility for you to control
Engin Terzi: or I should say not allow Devon to go to Strap. Who are the referees? You will not know. East versus West. I can show you the messages. Because I need to pay them. I need to know who they are. I can even show you the messages. Do you know what time the referees know the matches?
Engin Terzi: which who is reffing which match or something all the referees in attendance yeah right before like east versus west 11 i message 14 minutes before and east versus west uh 10 i send message let me check because the conversation going two minutes after the event started
Devon Larratt: eight like 20 or two so nobody knows including referees nobody except me and god nobody knows so i suppose that i'll probably figure it out soon how i have a direct line actually right now i have a direct form of communication with who the one you spoke of earlier
Devon Larratt: You mean God? Whatever you want to call it. Do you think that those pills that he's taking is causing these kind of things with this guy? I'm telling you, I've seen it. I've seen it very clearly. I've seen it. It's inevitable. When I see it that clearly, it happens. It happens.
Devon Larratt: The arm wrestling creed, Devon, if you beat the best arm wrestler ever, twice, and strongest ever, how are you not the greatest? You will be the only person to ever do it. I will consider myself the number one ranked arm wrestler during this time period. If I beat Devon, I will consider myself the number one ranked arm wrestler of today. I don't even...
Engin Terzi: consider anything else at all i think that uh you agree right that levan is the strongest arm master ever i mean in my opinion yes i think he has been yeah yeah i i don't think that there has oh you mean that this will finish soon i think that he was okay devil we consider him the strongest ever
Devon Larratt: once if you beat him if so that will be forever the same way they say oh but devin couldn't beat prime dennis so the same questions will be asked oh but devin couldn't beat prime levon it'll be the same rhetoric he says that he is in his prime he said he is at his best oh he didn't say that he doesn't he that comes out of his mouth he said that he said that no no he's not saying that no if you actually listen to him he's not saying that
Tornike (Translator): And everybody's not saying that. Levan, are you bringing to Devon Mash your best shape or no? Look, he already answered. It's very obvious. This is an obvious answer. The shape I'm at currently today, I have not been in this shape before.
Devon Larratt: Okay, so he's at his best. So don't say that. He did not say that. He just said he's never been in this state before. That's like, I can say that every single day of my life. This is history. No, no, no. I'm in best shape. Levan, you say that, but you know it's not true. It is true. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just not true. Why are you disagreeing with that? Can you not be in his best shape?
Devon Larratt: You think the same thing as me and so does everybody else. Of course he's going to say that. Of course he's going to say that because he's a strong and he's a proud man. Devon is a proud, strong man. Why is he saying this? Why is he saying this? You're trying to intimidate you? No, because he's a good person. He doesn't want to diminish my loss. He's a good person. He doesn't want to diminish my victory.
Devon Larratt: He doesn't like when I beat him. So this guy is a very good guy. He knows he's going to lose against you. So he's staying distant so nobody would take credits away from you. And that's what makes LeVon a good person. Oh, LeVon. You know it. I know it. Everybody knows it. LeVon is not his best. It's okay.
Devon Larratt: i i think right now right now you are you are doing mind tricks but no it's not angry you know it you made a video about it if if your only hope is not is that i'm not in my prime then it's it's bad news for you not in your prime just look down at your hands they're small look down at your arm it's weak look feel your wrist
Devon Larratt: It was bigger before. It was bigger. This is stronger. No, no, no. Yes. You know it. Yes, Devon. No, Levan. Show me the weight. Show me the weight. Not as much weight. Levan, is Devon trying to damage your confidence by doing this?
Levan Saginashvili: He's only trying to make himself believe this. He's not affecting me in any way.
Devon Larratt: we saw the way you winced we saw the way you winced on the last on the 80 kilogram curl we saw you winced we saw you you struggled on the wrist curl can i ask you something devin sorry just just let's let's talk about something listen being objective just tell me what you think if you disagree disagree i'm not trying to do anything this guy
Engin Terzi: Only two days before that, he did the handle wrist really heavy. He did a lot of reps and sets. One second. And then he pulled up 180 kilo, you know, that puts also pressure on wrist. And then two days later, he did the 110 kilo. And now you know that dumbbell also puts pressure here. So do you think that there is a possibility that it affected his wrist performance because of last two days, two days ago, what he did? And then those...
Devon Larratt: dumbbell bicep course you know that when you hold 110 kilo it also puts some pressure here and what do you think do you think that that is the reason maybe maybe we are thinking wrong with calculation of course all his training impacts the state he's in however he trains hard for every match and the way he appears during this hard training should be consistent
Devon Larratt: He is weaker and it's a fact. It is a fact that he's weaker. He knows it. You know it. I know it. Everybody knows it. Of course, if he were to take three or four days off during his training cycle, he'll be stronger. Nobody's going to do that. I train every day, multiple times a day, and I keep getting stronger. Do you know what he said? He said that while Devon is lifting, once I think, I'm already doing five-hour training.
Devon Larratt: you think that's all i do levon oh so now you are hiding something i'm not hiding anything i just don't want to pour hours and hours of footage i don't want to bore people i don't like to bore people with with my long workouts everybody knows levon i'm working okay don't think that this is all i do obviously you're the strongest devil you are the strongest
Devon Larratt: are still stronger than me but you're just not strong enough to beat me we all know that also we know actually that most super heavyweights are stronger than me ermy's is stronger than me dennis is stronger than me georgie's stronger than me morzoff is stronger than me kardashia is stronger than me le latin is stronger than me they're all stronger i beat them and i'll beat you too i don't think so i don't agree with that
Devon Larratt: Oh, yeah. Dennis was curling like 70 kilos for reps. For doing it for reps. Many times. Yeah. And you call that a curl? You call that a lift? Yeah, it's good. It's pretty good. Pretty good lift. I don't. I'm not impressed. It lifts more than me. Listen, the thing is, I just need you to know that I consistently beat people who lift more weight than me.
Devon Larratt: That's what you need to know. And all I need to tell you is the weight that you lift as an individual corresponds to how good you are on the table. So if you are a certain level and you lift more weights, you're probably stronger. But don't think just because one person lifts more weight than the other, they're going to beat the other person. You are weaker. You are weaker than ever.
Devon Larratt: it's good that you are talking about the weight because once i beat you i don't want no complaining about the weight difference and uh oh no listen super heavyweight is open one champion open you need to get bigger levon i've told you that over and over you need to get bigger
Engin Terzi: Levan, there is a question for you. Mr. Brain Junkie, I can hear Levan's wife behind him telling him what to say, and he is still losing the mind games with Levan. How does he expect to win the actual match? That was terrible. Oh, my. Whoever you are, thank you. That was really below the belt. Wow. No, no, no.
Tornike (Translator): I would like to ask you a question, but you were in the frame of Levan's birthday party, and I think it was your birthday, what do you think? And I don't know if it was Devon's birthday, but you were in the frame of Devon's birthday party, with the camera and everything. I wasn't in my birthday party.
Tornike (Translator): She is not taking part in this discussion. She knows that I will win. Neither she needs to scream during the competition. Is Jody around? Is Jody around?
Devon Larratt: Jody, yeah, she's making me food right now. Yeah, did she hear what he said? Jody hears everything. Jody has telepathy. She can hear everything. Maposian is asking you, will you give Levan your green hoodie if you lose? I worry that it might kill him to put it on. Why? It's very dirty. Because you didn't wash it for a long time?
Tornike (Translator): It's very, very dirty and I worry he might get very sick. I will put it into a water and then sell on the auction. It's also too big for him. It will not fit him properly.
Devon Larratt: I just want to sell it. I can maybe get you like a smaller version, one that would make you comfortable. Actually, I will not wash it and I will sell it right away to the fans. They will be happy. I'm going to see if I can find something. I'm going to go look for something. Just wait. We can't end this call yet.
Levan Saginashvili: I think it helps me to make an auction. That would be a great idea. Look. See my roof? It's the sky. This way. I have something.
Engin Terzi: The videos you did about talking about me in the toilet, was it something, the problems you had? Was it because of the fear? Sorry, say that again? He said that you made a video about him in the toilet. It probably means that, you know, like, did you have any kind of, like, it caused you, like, diarrhea or something? A video in the toilet? I don't know, that's what he said, yeah.
Engin Terzi: I don't remember making a video in the toilet. There is a question for you, Levan. Elifna said, can Levan still curl 100 kilo? Not for free. Not for free? Oh, before he was also doing this for money? Yes.
Levan Saginashvili: Okay. Okay, Stranger Frank, ask Devon and Levan who is going to win in June, Denis or Ermes? I think Ermes will win.
Levan Saginashvili: I will make some videos and share them with you. At this moment, I would like to say a few words. I want to say a few words.
Levan Saginashvili: With today's information, I think the favorite is Ermes. But let's see. I'm sure that they will put out videos closer to the match. Let's see how they will progress. It's a pity that when Demons and Cernakov were fighting, they had to fight with each other.
Levan Saginashvili: I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would
Tornike (Translator): One week prior Dennis and Devon's match, Dennis put out a video in which... With Tokarev? With Tokarev, yes. Yes, with Tokarev, where I saw the details, where I understood that Devon would win. And my prediction and this overall analysis was on point and exact.
Engin Terzi: yeah yeah yeah we also the same thing i think it was a mistake to post post a video wake up is asking engine if you weigh 300 pounds do you think you will be able to beat devon and or levan i would beat the shit out both of them you know okay you know we need to ask okay what are you going to show us you said that it cannot finish you were going to yeah didn't you see yeah
Devon Larratt: That's better for you, that one. Okay. Yeah. That one's better. I like English. Yeah, I know. I got it special for you. Devon. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. I'm sorry, Irakli.
Devon Larratt: When I see Irakli, I tell him, I'm sorry, Irakli. I'm sorry you didn't train him better. I didn't want to hurt Irakli's feelings. I like Irakli, but I'm sorry. I'm very sad that you are getting old. Do you see me? I'm actually younger. I'm younger now. But the thing is...
Devon Larratt: Isn't it amazing? Isn't it amazing that a guy who's actually 265 pounds and almost 49 is maybe, and we're going to find out very soon, and I know that you're not sure, is maybe the best in the world. Isn't that crazy? It's crazy, right? Yeah. It's crazy. Levan, do you think that Devon looks healthier than last time you met him?
Levan Saginashvili: Well, I can't say now when I see him live, I will tell you that. But during the first match, he didn't look healthy. He was shaking.
Tornike (Translator): sweaty, nervous, shivering. Is it because he was scared? He thinks that he was scared? Well, he shouldn't have been scared, but as a sportsman, he was scared.
Engin Terzi: Is that baklava, Devon? What's that? You're eating too much. Your stomach will explode. That's why he's drinking the Activia for eating. And last, okay, the arm wrestling grade. Devon, do you agree that if Devon stops you early in the match, that you are in trouble? Or you think that even if he stops you, you can still press him?
Tornike (Translator): I'm ready for everything. And also I'm very upset that Liliev is not
Tornike (Translator): in the match anymore. Could we learn some more details? I was very upset by that news.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, I can tell you privately the reason. This is more like business reasons, but there is no problem, not with the family, not with the health or anything. Levan, what does this man need to do to beat you? Like just say that if his brachioradialis was stronger, if his wrist was stronger, if his riser...
Engin Terzi: 15% was stronger. What does this man, you think that like he needs to beat you compared to last time? Even if he was born again three times, he still wouldn't be able to beat me. I'll be born eight times by the time I see you. Actually nine.
Levan Saginashvili: Well, nine births. Let's see about that. Nine times I'll be born again before I see you.
Engin Terzi: And Devon, you're talking about his match with Ermes, and you said what happened with the Ermes and this. Yeah, what happened? I remember after the Ermes match, you said that you disagree with people that all he needed was like four wins, and you thought that he was like a dominant victory. So are you using this now as a strategy just to mess with his mind? I have my own theories on what happened in the match.
Devon Larratt: And LaVon neither confirmed them nor denied them. We didn't actually get there. If I wanted to find out more, I suppose I'd ask him about round three. Very curious about round three. I guess I have two questions about round three. Specifically, what the fuck happened in round three? And was the right call made? Did the referees make an error? Those two questions.
Tornike (Translator): I can't recall what happened. Well, do you want me to tell you what I think? He's probably saying the match was stopped. You are saying it should be run and foul, Devon?
Engin Terzi: That's what I think. That's what you're saying, right? Yeah, so what he's saying is that when your elbow was out, he says that the match shouldn't be stopped and it should continue. It should be running foul. And he means that Ermes would win that round. This is what he's trying to say. Devon, I want to say that when you talk about Ida's foul, running foul is a good thing. The match wouldn't have happened. But it happened.
Levan Saginashvili: You are just trying to grab straws. Go and watch it again. Go and watch it again. They screwed up the call. It should have been a running foul. Everybody knows that too.
Devon Larratt: there's no way there's no way there was any advantage gained there's nothing not an advantage you were on your way to a loss and they gifted you a foul i don't know how they did that uh you have to speak for yourself well the the match with them myself i'm connected to everybody and we all think this
Tornike (Translator): It just sounds pity. First, you try to go to 2017. Then the referee call is just a... This is the last match you had. The last match you had, you could have lost. If round three had been called properly, you wouldn't have won a round past round three. The armies would have gassed you out. You wouldn't have been able to get it in the match. And that would have been the end. You're just falling too low.
Devon Larratt: No, this is the truth. Go watch it again. Go watch the match. Tell me that that's not a running foul. Please, somebody who's watching, make a video compilation and dissect that foul and tell me that that's not supposed to be a running foul. That's a running foul because there's no advantage. LeBron is not gaining an advantage. That's why they said that they're... LeBron, LeBron, LeBron.
Levan Saginashvili: Levan, one second. When I was in Georgi, did you tell me that it's supposed to be WAF rules and then they apply different rules during the match, or I misunderstand? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
Tornike (Translator): There's no point about talking about refereeing because referees were actually were not in my favor and all the decisions that were made were against me. And overall the rules themselves got changed back and forth and it wasn't clear.
Devon Larratt: Why did your wrist bend back when you went to press Ermes outside of the strap? Are you a fan of Ermes? I'm a fan of all the great arm wrestlers. Are you trying to defend him? I'm curious what happened. I saw the match. I'm curious why his wrist bent back.
Levan Saginashvili: You are very, it's, it's very pity of, I'm, I'm pitying you of, uh, I just, why, why, why pity?
Devon Larratt: You're just nitpicking a video. No, I'm not nitpicking it. I'm just looking at the video. What I saw in round three was you blew your wrist out. That's what I saw. And then I saw you get saved by the referee with a running foul. That's what I saw.
Tornike (Translator): Then we had another match and I won that round right away. And listen, and listen. I mean, if we want to draw comparisons, I played with Ermes. It's just the truth. It's the truth. Easy. No problem. Okay.
Levan Saginashvili: So what? Easy day, right? Easy day, right? You're just trying to compare the others. You have to care about yourself. No problem, Devon. Devon't worry about it. It should be easy.
Devon Larratt: Your wrist should be fine. It should hold up. Devon't confuse me with Ermes or Dennis or anybody. Your wrist should be just fine. I know Ermes cracked it back. It shouldn't happen with me. It shouldn't happen with me. Just because it happened with Ermes, it doesn't mean it'll happen with me. Ermes and I are different. We're different. Ermes and me are very different pullers.
Devon Larratt: armies armies will be many people that i won't beat don't get worried about that i just feel sorry for you i feel sorry for iraqli and i feel sorry for georgia and i feel sorry for your new wife and your little dog you have to buy cheaper dog food now not the good dog food now your dog will stay small forever
Devon Larratt: Never grow bigger. Because he won't be able to feed them. Because he will not have money to feed his dog. Oh, because he will lose and then he will not make enough money? I'm sorry. I didn't want this for your dog. I didn't want this for all of the people. I didn't want this. I want us all to do well. I'd probably be happy with that.
Engin Terzi: You need to take your pill. It's time. Monday. Mondays and Thursdays. Levan, can you please say, Kukul was asking, can you please say concrete elbow? No. Concrete elbow. Can you say concrete elbow? I don't say stupid things.
Engin Terzi: Concrete Elbow is one of the YouTube channel names. I love Concrete Elbow. I love Concrete Elbow. Yeah, it was not disrespect. It was super chat. They just wanted to say their name, not to disrespect or something. And you, Tornike, what do you think about... I know you are here as a translator, but what do you think about what Devon is trying to do?
Tornike (Translator): Well, I'm sure it will be a great match. Can't wait. I will be there. I will be watching all of it live. And, yeah, just can't wait to see Devon's defeat. Dornicky, how do you say sorry in Georgi? Well, there are several ways. The simpler one, probably bodish.
Tornike (Translator): During each match, I can teach you a couple of words and you will slowly learn.
Engin Terzi: Please. And another thing, Levan, you said that you're going to on the round sticks, you're going to hold him and talk with him. What are you going to tell him? I'm sorry, Devon. I'm sorry. Odyssey. Odyssey. Okay.
Engin Terzi: Okay, guys, I think it looks like, you know, you all said what you wanted to say. It has been two hours almost. And do you guys want to say any last words to each other or to the fans or to whoever? I know Devon sent a lot of messages to Irakli, your dog and your new wife and your mother, your father and all Georgi that he said he's sorry. Anything you want to add, Devon?
Devon Larratt: Oh, does she? Oh, does she, LeVon? Oh, does she? I'm way bigger than you, LeVon. I'm way bigger. It's going to be 4-1. Just remember I told you that. 4-1, maybe. Probably maybe 4-1, 4-0. I'm sorry. Oh, does she? I love you, Deva. What's that? I love you. I love Deva.
Levan Saginashvili: Is there any other message you want to say to anyone?
Tornike (Translator): I just want to tell fans to watch the event live how I crushed this old pity man on the 20th of April watch the the pay-per-view and it will be a great show yeah and any any message to Canada as he sent to Georgi
Tornike (Translator): Canada is great. I love Canada. Maybe I can visit some time in the future, eat the food, have fun. Play some hockey maybe.
Devon Larratt: Good times. Good times. There's lots of good times here. When it's time to get strong, Devon, we'll have you out here. I'll give you all this food that I have. I'll get you next level. Next level. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Devon, Devon, one last question. Why on the arm best, Devon only needs to win one round?
Devon Larratt: so you need to win only one round and then what he needs to win all six well because no no no be quiet he just got to win the first four yeah he's gonna win the first four okay and you i just need to win one just one well
Tornike (Translator): Now, let me tell you something. He just learned about that. He didn't know. Oh, he didn't know? He didn't know. No, I think. That's it.
Devon Larratt: Yeah, it was that same way last time. It's like that with everybody. Is that your idea? You wrote that? No, it's not. No, I don't have final authority on any of the matches that I'm in. Any match that I'm in, I do not have authority over. That's a conflict of interest. Has such thing happened in a sport history? Shutout steak?
Devon Larratt: Yeah, most of the matches are shutout stake. Actually, I'd say probably about 50% of the matches are shutout stake. Take a look at Armbet. Yeah, about half of them are shutout stake. About half of them are win-loss. Okay, okay, Devon. I need to, I need to a little bit.
Engin Terzi: pick on you what does it mean when somebody needs to win one round and one the other one needs to win the whole match what does it exactly mean does it mean that the one that needs to win only no that's not how it goes at all that's not how it actually works okay so i'll explain the shutout stake for you okay so if if someone is placed into a shutout stake position for example
Devon Larratt: Devon is in the shutout stake position. And that means for him to win the, the stake, he needs to win the first four matches. If I even win one, you already just won like this. You remember? I don't even need to win. I don't even need to win the match.
Engin Terzi: So, Baba, listen, why he needs to win four times, you need to win one time? It just means that they think that you're just asking, is it successful if you win only one while he needs to win four? So it means that he is heavily favored? Yes, that's right. Why is that? Because he's 420 pounds and 35 years old, and I'm 260. Baba, you said because you sound like you agree with this statement.
Devon Larratt: There is no question that the states are in the proper way. I'll tell you, look, I'm quite often the underdog. When one person's in the underdog position, don't think for a second. If you know, if you know who's going to win and lose, if people know who's going to win and lose,
Devon Larratt: all these people would be rich. Because he's the favorite. Because he is widely perceived as the greatest arm wrestler that's ever lived. He's widely perceived as the largest and strongest force that there is in the sport. This is the truth. I've said it myself. Yeah, I don't know if he was a shadowed stake or not. I don't remember. I don't remember. I'm not involved in the staking of my matches.
Devon Larratt: I do not stake my matches. But I'll tell you, the fans heavily believed that Ermes was going to beat me. If you looked at most of the polls, most of the experts, look, there's a few ways you can look at Ermes. And you can look at like the broad polls on like YouTube or Instagram. This is a fan poll. This is a fan poll. Yeah, it's not extremely accurate.
Devon Larratt: They're typically not as accurate. I don't want to say they're wrong. They're just typically not as accurate. What's more accurate is expert opinion and money. Money. People who are willing to put money on it is a way more powerful opinion than someone's able to click a button. This is more important.
Devon Larratt: yeah expert and typically typically i've been in the in the position to lose quite often look it go on over go on over and put your money down i think i'm sold out i think i'm sold out at the moment i think there's lots of space on levon and the truth is if he doesn't beat me four zero he's gonna lose there is no three one there's no three there's no four one or four two option for levon it's four nothing or bust
Tornike (Translator): So it means if I bet a lot of money on Devon and finish the match 5-1, this means I get rich? 4-1. It has to be 4-1. Once the first 4 is done, it's done.
Devon Larratt: You need to win the first four. What happens in round five and six doesn't matter. Like you and Ermes was a shutout stake.
Devon Larratt: Ermes and Lavon was a shutout stake. And and Lavon one, he because he won the first four, when when he's asking something, he says that just say that you win one round, and then he won four rounds. So he beat you for one, but he bet on you. So he can become rich. Do it. Go get rich. Go get rich.
Levan Saginashvili: See how it works out for you. Yeah. After I learned this and this was the news to me, uh, I will just sleep so tight. There's nothing to say anymore. Perfect. Perfect. I'm coming to beat you. Okay. I want you to know that.
Devon Larratt: I'm incredibly strong. I've never felt better in my life. I've never been this strong. I've never been this good. I've beaten our last opponent, your last opponent. I beat easier than you did. The guy who made you quit. The guy who you got lucky on round three with because of a bad call.
Devon Larratt: I destroyed. Devon't forget that. Yes, LeVon. Say it again. Say it again. Say it one more time.
Engin Terzi: Tornike, this guy, last time he was very angry when they would call him something. And there we saw that he made it very personal, he was angry. Now he doesn't look that angry anymore. How is this going to affect him?
Tornike (Translator): Well, he might not be angry, but he's motivated. We can see that he works a lot and he's putting all his effort. I don't see it. I don't see any good lifts in the gym. Those are all hidden. Okay. Okay. Let's slowly finish. Britain, Watkins, no matter the outcome, can we get them to trade together in the
Engin Terzi: It's 4 a.m. in Tbilisi. Yeah, let's go. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, they will probably train in the future after this match. And Chris Pontello, just wait one minute. So not to disrespect these people. People who bet for Ermes got paid out. What does it mean?
Devon Larratt: That means that no, they didn't. No, they did not. They did. I also was a better and I didn't get anything yet. No, you didn't get, hold on, hold on, hold on. Are you telling me that army's got paid out? No, that's not true. As far as I know it is. Yes. No, no, no, no, no. Okay. I need to make some calls because I'm quite sure.
Devon Larratt: it was a shutout stake where you needed to win the first four and levon won the first four levon should have got paid levon staker should have got paid for that yeah i thought so too and i should have been one of them but it didn't work out okay okay hold on i need to look into this now because from what i understand levon's side won there because it was four nothing
Engin Terzi: Yeah, I think there is an idiot asking something. Ermes did not even scream versus Devon. That match was cheated as every Devon match. I want to see what can Devon cheat versus Vitaly who will crush Devon. What do you mean? Oh, this is another high IQ guy. Find that guy and somebody send him a bunch of presents. He needs to be in charge of everything.
Engin Terzi: no no no because because when he said like cheated do you mean he didn't even scream he just laid or sold the match or something this is the guy who thinks that i bought the match or something oh this is what he that means what he says yeah it's one of these retards okay this guy is if there's a retard we need to yeah how many viewers do we have
Engin Terzi: We had up to 2,400, now 2,200. Yeah, yeah. And then we can just finish and find this guy. Yeah, yeah. That's good, yeah. Anyways, guys, thank you very much. Levan.
Engin Terzi: Thank you very much Devon, thank you very much Tornike. Thank you. Great time, great time, and then let's see, I don't know what people understood from this, but we will see very soon, less than 30 days. Devon, I still love you. You're a good person, even though you're gonna lose, Devon. Even though you're gonna lose, you're still a good person. God bless you.
Devon Larratt: Delicate person. Thank you, guys. All the best, guys. We'll see you soon. Take care.
