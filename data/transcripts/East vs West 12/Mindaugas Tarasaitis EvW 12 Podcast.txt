SPEAKER_03: Hello, guys. Soon, Mindagos is going to join.
SPEAKER_03: Hello Adnan. Hello my friends. Good evening. Good evening. Good afternoon.
SPEAKER_02: Hello, Victor. Hello, my friend. Why are you asking me King of the Table videos? What do I have to do with the King of the Table videos? Yeah, the goat is late, yeah. I don't know why he is doing this, but he is late.
SPEAKER_02: I'm just joking, you know. Normally we should start, we should have started seven, no, seven minutes later we're supposed to start. You should ask to maybe king of the table, owners, the bosses, CEOs, instead of east versus west. Here we go.
SPEAKER_02: Hello, hello, hello, Mindaugas, or I should say GOAT. Yeah, it's good that you corrected yourself, Engin. Yes. How do you think when people are calling you GOAT and these kind of things, do you get bothered or do you just laugh about it or you think, wow, it's well-deserved? Yeah, I think it's very well-deserved and it's perfectly correct. This is how it should be.
SPEAKER_01: that's what i always expected like i couldn't really understand why did they not call me that before yeah and and then people very appropriate people don't know they they just think john is the goat you know so what they they will get used to exactly and anyway just double check uh can you hear me well by the way um yeah okay so then maybe maybe you're hearing me no i can't hear you echo with echo no everything is okay yeah that's good that's good
SPEAKER_02: so how have you been you look a little bit like weight gain yeah you don't look skinny in here or yeah i mean not fat but like looks like you gain a little bit weight yeah uh it's just one kilo maybe two yeah that's good i'm doing well i'm doing well yeah
SPEAKER_01: Can I ask you something? How do you measure your shape with the weights? Like I saw you with two and a half kilos, now are you up to three? Yeah, so people do ask me about it because I am not really lifting heavy ever. I just do some rubber bands. You don't do that? You don't do lifting heavy?
SPEAKER_01: If I lift things dynamically, meaning that, you know, some kind of muscle contraction, I would always be super light, like maybe 20%, okay, 30% maybe. And then I go heavy on rubber bands. Oh, with the rubber band you are doing? And then I'm super static, no movement with rubber bands at all, just kind of. Just static, oh, okay. Going backwards. So it is a little bit difficult to maybe measure the shape.
SPEAKER_01: yeah rubber bands really hard yeah but just through experience somehow i kind of feel the level a little bit from rubber bands yeah feeling the connection and i guess the competition is the final check like uh yeah okay but during the training only maybe the table time
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, the table time. The table time is also not telling me too much because I'm on the table. I'm just very static. Also not trying to kill anyone too much. So I think if I start to fail during the competitions and if I don't like my results, then I will change something, you know, then I know that something is going wrong. But for so far, I can see good results steadily climbing up. So yeah, that's interesting. That's interesting that you don't know your shape.
SPEAKER_01: by measuring anything except how you feel. So maybe the most interesting thing is that I don't feel the need to know. Many other people kind of feel like they need to know how much progress do they make
SPEAKER_01: I almost don't need that kind of fight. I know that I'm getting better anyways, so... Okay, there is Viktor Mindaugas, the second GOAT behind Birzing. Do you want me to block this guy for this disrespect? He put you second place. I should block him? That's wrong, Viktor. That's really... That's wrong. We should give him another chance. Everyone can have their own opinion, you know, it's not a dictatorship. No, no. So, I mean, people make mistakes, so it's fine. We...
SPEAKER_02: mean it is like you know it is like saying like summers are cold winters are hot you know it's like that that crazy maybe just a mistake the guy was confused okay okay we have to forgive it okay i forgive you yeah see anyway so yeah there's something new about you that i i thought you would be doing like i have seen you doing like with something like
SPEAKER_01: like this long time ago and it was just a small experiment like oh okay okay spend much time doing that one and and do you do some type of coordination with rubber bands with different direction at the same time or you just go like one direction at a time um good question i kind of feel like um
SPEAKER_01: not even doing too much side pressure for example i'm just kind of i think that if i do triceps and then i add do biceps so just both natural directions then somehow my side pressure would also get stronger just because like um you know the stability would be better so i'm yeah i'm not too focused on all the different directions just on the main kind of natural muscle movements
SPEAKER_02: No, I meant with the rubber bands. Like you can put something in your hand, pull like a rope. At the same time, you can take something to here. And at the same time, row and pronation. No, just one direction. And that is all brachioradialis base? A little bit of pronation, a little bit of post. Mostly still just kind of very simple grip. How can I show you?
SPEAKER_01: Let's see if I take this bottle. Imagine this is a rubber band. I'm gripping it. I just kind of take it like this and almost start with the biceps kind of. And then at the end, go a little bit like that.
SPEAKER_02: yeah okay there is some guy that you know made a video like who needs pronator you know on on youtube he looks like you are you related to that guy because now i hear that you are no i remember that video yeah i remember that um i just wanted to highlight how back pressure is so much more important um pronation is just you know kind of secondary
SPEAKER_02: secondary okay okay whenever whenever somebody is just hitting you that way like here you know is it back pressure is holding on or or the direction is coming to this way it's a lot of back pressure because if i if i let's say aim like time it correctly and pull back
SPEAKER_02: the guy who is going sideways, he will somehow be opened, right? He will not be able to get... Just say that he held on. Like the position on number three with Daniel, his wrist didn't directly go. He was holding on. And then you went this and this. So this hit here, is it back pressure or pronation? So I think for sure not so much pronation. Yep.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, what is holding your hand this way to not to turn this way? It's the low hand movement, which I know that maybe you don't do it as much. But for me, whenever my hand is low enough and I pull through back pressure, it's really hard for him to bring it in because he almost, in order to supinate it, he must find my back pressure. Is that maybe why...
SPEAKER_02: Bojidar hooks you, but he's having a very hard time to hook me? Maybe. But I would like to try that match again with him because everyone is getting stronger. Okay, yeah, yeah. Okay. Anyway, so... So, we have a match. Big match, right? Yep, very big match. Very big match and I think
SPEAKER_02: I'm just thinking, thinking, thinking, thinking, thinking. After you beat Daniel, and now this is the biggest match of your life. I think Daniel was bigger. I think for me, Daniel was bigger than this. But you had defeated him before. A few times. In a few different events. He beat you more, but...
SPEAKER_02: you also have beaten you know how it feels to beat him you know and you beat him in a super match in istanbul like when i said super match he was like best of three like you you you beat him two zero or two one two zero it was right two zero yeah two zero you beat him yeah arthur is bigger because you have never won an event when arthur was present true true yeah yeah so yeah it's of course like almost as big but uh
SPEAKER_01: Daniel was just technically such an annoying style for me. And in my mind, I was like somehow, you know, not happy that I couldn't figure it out. And so finally solving that puzzle. This is what I'm saying. You had done it before. Sometimes getting lucky a little bit still did not feel, I feel like this time it felt the most convincing in my head. After that time, I feel like I can repeat it again.
SPEAKER_01: Before, I was not sure if I could defeat him. Now, I think I'm much more confident. Meanwhile, with Makaro, yeah, he's super strong, maybe more explosive, more muscular. But stylistically, I feel like that puzzle is quite easy to solve. It's just a little bit about power, which I also maybe increased during the past couple of years. Yeah, but listen, the puzzle that you had to solve was...
SPEAKER_02: after the goal with you know i don't remember like daniel dominating you understand so the match was stopping and the puzzle was starting but with arthur the puzzle still there is a puzzle that you need to solve mostly right with the starts like once you get your position looks like you know you will have and where do you think that like he can beat you and you cannot like i mean like do you see him with back pressure
SPEAKER_02: followed by a side pressure hit, or you see him more dangerous with hook. Because usually, not usually, he beat you always by hooking you. He went and hook you and beat you. But after he got top rolled, you know, by some people, even once by you, he started to go with the back pressure, with the side pressure. So I remember you told me that even when I beat him once, when you top roll,
SPEAKER_02: because he was in hook so you took his wrist and then when you were pinning him he rolled his hand and you told me that you felt something very powerful even that time he was coming out from losing wrists from hook and losing wrist out you still felt i saw your wrist was like this at the end your wrist was flattened you know and this time um do you see him because since then he's pulling that way mostly do you see him uh
SPEAKER_01: that dangerous more dangerous that way or hooking is more dangerous or we will see what do you think so somehow like yes he is he is going backwards a little bit more but i think he's still also hooking people so it's not like i feel like he will at first try to hook me i don't think he will immediately go for a top roll um so yeah he might still have a good back pressure but somehow i feel like still the most dangerous thing is the hook
SPEAKER_01: If I can get around the hook, I think I will take care of the top role as well. So first I will... So you are ready for both cases? No, for sure, for sure. I can see that top role being a problem also. But I can also see so many small things which he's still not doing correctly.
SPEAKER_02: I feel like Artur is like a beast, like a big powerhouse, but technically I feel like he's still making quite a few mistakes. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. He's not like a super master with the technique, but he's probably the strongest raw power in that category. Yeah, for sure. Yeah. Even more than Alan. Alan needs to just control him, exhaust him and then beat him. But at the start, he's like very powerful, you know, like a,
SPEAKER_02: like a wild horse that you need to just first calm down stop and then somehow stop it somehow control it yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah anyway so some way in some way like that style is also dangerous because you never know maybe i just cannot stop it properly somehow maybe he's too explosive so not only explosive he may be too strong you know because i mean he's physically he's very very dangerous guy you know just like super strong super strong um
SPEAKER_02: We will see. Let's see. Let's see. I mean, four rounds, let's see whose endurance is better. Because I remember in the final, I think he beat you once in Antalya and then you beat him in final and then they did the second final and then he beat you that time. Yeah. And interestingly, I think when you won, the buckle was on your hands.
SPEAKER_02: And when he won, the buckle was on his hand. Yeah, yeah. But yeah, so when I look back at the match, I can see that I was not the same as I am now. I was also making mistakes. Do you think that he is the same as that time? Probably no. What do you think? I mean, I think that you both are leveled up, but I don't know who progressed more. I have no idea. I don't know when he came here for Adam Orzinski match.
SPEAKER_02: He was at his smallest I have ever seen. You know, it was just like he was like a 70 kilo version of that. He said that he had some stomach problems and he said that like, can we cancel? I cannot eat like for 20 days or something, he said. And like he is like, if I pull, if I lose, would you give me a chance at 75 as well?
SPEAKER_02: I said, yeah, of course, because that's not your category. Your category is 75. How I can judge you with 85 kilo? I offer you 85, you pull 85, and I'm going to say anything negative to you just when you are pulling. I'm sure Adam Worzenski was 90 kilo the time that they were pulling, and the guy was still 74 kilo. So there was probably 35 pounds, 16 kilo difference between them. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: And Arthur, on camera, Arthur still looked huge. Like when I was re-watching the match, he still looked pretty big. I saw him, he was just small, trust me. And he still won one round, he still gave Adam some tough time, you know. Even though he was like 16 kilos probably, 11 on the scale, and 16 probably the time of the pull-in, he was lighter, you know, yeah. But...
SPEAKER_02: Let's see how it will be. Let's see. I can't wait. For me, it's all about the start. All about the start. If he gets in his place, especially in hook, he's going to destroy you. But if he somehow, how to say, just stops his wrist, you hang him here, it will not be probably as hard as the Daniel match.
SPEAKER_01: right it would yeah because we are so different he would not pay it yeah he doesn't have that shoulder pressure i mean as much as we do we know but who knows you know i don't know things change you know right yeah things change but yeah you see like uh i don't want to be overconfident of course i will i'm always trying to be super realistic and reasonable but here like i have to say that i'm quite already quite confident because um we have seven rounds
SPEAKER_01: I can hardly see Arthur blasting me four times in a row. I can really hardly see it. I only need to break his wrist once. Yeah, but it was the case in Antalya. In Antalya, you did once and then he just came back and beat you.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but super long time ago. I'm not, you know, I'm now... Okay, okay, yeah, you're right. Five and a half years old. Yeah, five and a half years. But to me, it's like yesterday. I don't know why. Like, it's like two, three years ago. Yeah, exactly. So you see, for us, it's extremely difficult. Like, yeah, for me, it's all the same. When I remember all the pullers, I mostly remember them from, let's say, 2015 to 2018 or 19. So that's the time when I...
SPEAKER_01: I really paid attention to all the guys. So now it feels a bit weird. And maybe it's even when you look at me, you almost don't see the same guy, right? So it's hard. You know, I'm still quite skinny. You know, you don't see any power. No, no, you are bigger. You are bigger. You were just so tiny when you were 70 kilos. Now you are more like developed, you know, those shoulders and everything. I see like for someone like you,
SPEAKER_02: It is very dangerous, even a little bit size increase, because it is already very dangerous technically, you know, whenever you know that the guy is going to do the same thing with more horsepower now. So then it is, you know, like, I would, I don't know. I don't know. That's more dangerous, technical and stronger at the same time, you know, it's dangerous. But you realize that Arthur, like, he lost to Alan every time.
SPEAKER_02: One time he beat him at WAF with two fouls. But together, I mean, those matches at WAF final was more than two minutes. Longer ones, right? Yeah, two minutes. Yeah, those three starts was two minutes. And at the Russian Nationals the same year, it was again long, very long. Even now, like their fresh match is usually near half a minute. So it's not like Makarov is...
SPEAKER_01: immediately getting tired no no no like fresh or fresh like it's still very close yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah let's see let's see also by the way it's really exciting because yeah i never never before i was able to test myself against uh this kind of power you know even before when i did it i was not at the same level so now it's exciting like can i do it or
SPEAKER_02: Should I still improve something? But I think I can do it. But let's see. Yeah, I mean, I think also it has been a long time, but Daniel and Arthur also pulled. I remember. Even if they pulled once, I remember in the final. But right arm I'm talking about. But Daniel has been in the category of Makaro many times. Yeah. Yeah. I mean...
SPEAKER_02: In my opinion, I would favor Makaro because I don't see Daniel is...
SPEAKER_02: putting him out of position. I believe technically Arthur would be able to do whatever he wants. I'm talking about apply his power. You understand? Exactly. If he wants to go like this, I don't think it would be so easy, Daniel, to hook him. If he wants to go hook, I don't think Daniel could topple. Do you see Daniel toppling Arthur? No, no, no. I can also see. So Arthur would be able to apply his power. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: that that that is what what i believe you know and but somehow i still have i still have that impression that um me and daniel we progressed a bit more than um let's say oleg and makaro somehow i just have an impression you say it that way but even like like when when daniel and uh chakras will pull yeah it it was not the uh it was like
SPEAKER_02: the same year that he beat you at Europeans, right? Yeah. He beat you, Daniel beat you in Europeans, and then I think, like, it was comfortable, like, except the first start. You know, the first start, he tried to top roll you, you pin him, but then you get a foul, but then, in his moment, he beat you easy. And then he went to the WAF, and then, in WAF, Cerkasov hold him, Cerkasov hold him, and drag him, and beat him, you know.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know if it is true. I think you are bad for Cerkasov because you don't allow him to use his power. You versus Cerkasov here, and you versus Cerkasov at Moldova, almost the same. I think in Moldova, you won even easier than in Istanbul. Maybe. You don't remember? It was like round one. You hold him. Yeah, yeah. So I think everybody is...
SPEAKER_02: Okay, maybe you're right. Maybe it's not a good... Yeah, because I don't remember Cerkasov. Cerkasov and Daniel always have war with left arm. Always. And I think the last final in 2021, was it 10 minutes or 12 minutes? I don't remember. I was like, I feel like, what's happening? Like, am I dreaming? After a certain point, you cannot focus anymore. You understand? The guys just stay like this.
SPEAKER_02: You remember that match, right? Yeah. And always, they always had this battle. Always Cerkasov technically in a better position. But, you know, Daniel just fights, fights, fights, fights and he wins. So I don't think that anything has changed because that day, to this day, like remember 2018 final with Left Arm? They also had a war in Antalya. I think you were, which place you were there? 3rd, 4th?
SPEAKER_02: Maybe even lower, I don't remember. You don't remember, okay. Anyway, so what I just tried to say that I don't think anything is so much changing yet. Anyway, so how long is left? 45 days? Is it 45 days? Maybe 44 days. Okay, I wasn't counting. I thought that maybe it's even less. Okay, 45 is good. Six weeks and two days. What's today? Thursday or today? Thursday? Thursday, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: yeah okay yeah two days six weeks in two days it's 44 days yeah wow yes yes yeah yeah so it's a bit of rubber more rubber bands now and then just rest and you need to lose how many you said three kilos yeah two free kilo not three kilos yeah let's see wow i just can't wait what about macaro how many does he
SPEAKER_02: I have no idea. Today I asked him. Today he was not available. Tomorrow he was not available because of some family things, some visits that he already planned. So I'm like, let's go one at a time. Maybe I would do some of the other matches the same way. Do you know anything about his weight? I don't know. I can ask him, but it will take a long time. I don't know.
SPEAKER_02: yeah so it's sometimes hard to imagine him how does he fit into the class you know it's yeah yeah yeah especially those farms what is your weight let's see what he will say yeah anyway so you want to say anything about after match before we go to the the predictions yeah
SPEAKER_01: um yeah i guess not much just happy about the match uh for me since i you know i always feel like um people are easily under underestimating me just because i'm a little bit skinny i don't look so muscular you know so fighting someone who looks extremely big it's a good opportunity for me to once again prove that my power you know and normally i'm um
SPEAKER_01: not working on the muscle size i'm working on power so i know some other people are also kind of training muscles or kind of trying to look good and i don't really care about too much about that i just want to be powerful so it is a good opportunity did you know that we will have again like 10 cups for the composition i know you're lying you know you're joking joking not lying anyways um you said that you said that uh
SPEAKER_01: like daniel was commanded in your head you couldn't really uh figure that you know what to do um am i one of those people for you in some way yes you are yeah i think you are because uh yeah in a way similar kind of explosiveness to makaro but the direction is a bit more annoying so um oh yeah if i had to fight you i would somehow i knew i would really need to think about it
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, because you would be worried mostly about my wrist, because your technique is going there, like going there. You have two wins against me, both were with the flop wrist, you know, and do you think that, like, would it confuse you? Just tell me honestly, would you do some flop wrist?
SPEAKER_01: Training? No, I would not try to aim for that kind of thing. I would try to just maintain my rest. That would be the goal. Maintain, yeah. But yeah, if I can maintain for just a little bit, I know that you have no endurance at all. So maybe it will be easy to finish and maybe I can even finish like that.
SPEAKER_02: Listen, you said that I don't have endurance. This is, do you remember my match with VRL Dobrin? Do you think VRL Dobrin is someone that is like with good endurance or bad endurance? Do you remember round two? He's pretty good. He's pretty good. Yeah. Yeah. Round two, we had like maybe 20 seconds match, but round three, round four, round five was even easier. Yeah. But I'm just saying that you are talking about when I was 65 kilos, only four weeks before we pulled at WAF.
SPEAKER_02: I mean, only forearm left for me.
SPEAKER_02: I still won the WAP, but trust me, I couldn't really recover. I still top roll you and just like, I don't want to say the rest of the story, but because it doesn't... Yeah, I can imagine you probably had some joint problems and stuff like that. No, no, joint problem is not, but I had a roommate. I didn't know that he had those kind of like in the middle of the night, screaming, you know, and then you jump and then two nights in a row I couldn't sleep. It's okay. That's not the thing. You want fair and square.
SPEAKER_02: And then I took my revenge by beating you 5-0, 5-0. And I can't wait to prove. By the way, I had the air transplant. Doctor told me to not to train for some time. And before that I had a concussion. I hit my head while I was doing some type of, I don't know how you call it, isometric or something, you know. But now, Sunday I did one training. Yesterday I did one training. Slowly, slowly, from now on, no more stop.
SPEAKER_02: No more stop. I will do diet. I do have a feeling that we might meet again at the table. Yeah. I just don't know if it can be possible for 75. I would love to. But if you really want to get your ass kicked at the 85, I mean, I can give you that opportunity. But don't be like, oh, you're heavier. I'm 78. You're 85. Yeah. You can be 95. It's okay. Oh, you don't believe that. You don't believe even 85. Do you believe in 85 as well?
SPEAKER_02: I think you would get tired after round one and that's it. What tired? I would just hold you from your wrist and then let you go. And then boom, boom, boom. We have to find out then. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, so, okay. So let's start about the predictions. If Arthur didn't send the message, Arthur says he is 77 kilo. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. He is 77 kilo. And let me see.
SPEAKER_02: if he's going to answer, but never mind. Maybe he's family visit, he said. So let's talk about the predictions. But I would like to remind you who I am once again. Okay, good, good. Yeah. Okay. Mr. Tarasaitis. Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Nugo Shikadze versus Petro Marharin. Petro Marharin was on the same day when you had a supermatch with Daniel, as far as I remember, right? He did those incredible things with Rewaz. He surprised everyone. Yeah, he beat everyone. John, Sandris, he beat everyone. I mean, he even hooked Rewaz without a strap, you know.
SPEAKER_02: And the same Revas had like a war only two months before that at the Waf Antalya, he and Levan had a war, you know? So Petro Marharin, what do you think about Petro Marharin's wrist? I wrote maybe the pound for pound strongest wrist. Do you think it's possible?
SPEAKER_02: It's for sure very special. I'm just wondering if he can still, if he did maintain that same shape over these years. Do you know how old he is? He's young, but he's not inactive all those years. He competed when you pull WAF Worlds 2022 in Antalya, only like 15 months ago. There, Krasimir Kostadinov won
SPEAKER_02: 100 kilo category. And Marharin was the one who sent Krasimir to the B-side in a fresh match in that event. Okay, okay. So he's not forever away or something, but maybe a year or something break and then he started training. Last three, four months, he still have some. So it's not like years of absence, you know. Okay, so I think the Georgian guy might be in trouble because...
SPEAKER_01: But have you seen his match with Krasimir in the last Europeans? Yeah. It's all right, yeah. So, quite impressive, but yeah. I have a feeling that Margarine will probably bring it all in. And the Georgian guy, wasn't he mostly kind of trying to top-roll, right? Yeah, in this trap, he top-rolled Krasimir, you know. And Krasimir said that he is very, very strong against...
SPEAKER_02: pullers you know and and this guy which is interesting because the georgian guy had the his arm is not that long right he's a bit more like a stocky shorter guy yeah yeah look at his this is 90 kilos i saw that one also too i think today you spoke you spoke right right yeah 90 kilo i mean it it was like first like this but later he went down like this
SPEAKER_02: like 90 kilo are you joking me it's like yeah i mean yeah so that is why probably he's very strong against hoopers because they are coming to his arm but the thing is petromartan is not going like this but more like you know uh so so you are saying petro is the favorite well let me just think for a second it's of course very hard to tell if i had to guess i think petro
SPEAKER_02: They'll probably prepare well. I think I would go with Petro Margarine. You know, these guys, they really want to pull at this stage. And when you are invited once, it is like kind of extra pressure. Like, you are champion. I mean, you have been winning except the Eiderham match. I mean, you can't afford a loss. You understand? But when they are like first time invited,
SPEAKER_02: So it is kind of extra pressure that they would like to be invited soon again, you understand? Yeah. So they might surprise us by the preparation being a bit better than normally, maybe. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's see how it will be, but I think it's a very good match. Also, Krasimir wrote, Krasimir said that it's a very interesting match. He wrote, Sandris versus Ibrahim Sago.
SPEAKER_01: yeah looks well sundries is good in all the directions but uh ibrahim i think stylistically is very dangerous for sundries he might just jump on top and maybe sundries is not good enough so it's yeah hard to tell hard to tell i think i would go with ibrahim but i would hope that sundries can resist let's go like it
SPEAKER_02: baltic brotherhood yeah of course i support science yeah but yeah i can see how stylistically super difficult yeah sundries i see lately his arms everything bigger yesterday he was my guest he was big you know he was bigger than usual he also losing weight yeah it's interesting but his arms i don't know he put tank top his arm everything just
SPEAKER_01: I mean, yeah, he looks big. Normally he doesn't look that big, but now he's just, you know, the fat is coming off and he's revealing. Maybe, maybe. Yeah, that's interesting. And okay, this is, yeah, say, sorry, sorry. I was just about to say that weight loss might also make him a little bit weaker somehow. I don't know. I don't know. He didn't look weak. He looked big, you know. I don't think he's weak, but he may be faster.
SPEAKER_02: he's already fast he was already fast but let's see okay this one you are kind of familiar you know active versus oniani yep um so my guess is that oniani is powerful enough and strong enough to correctly catch that hit and this is the left arm by the way right 95 kilo so they put in 75 kilo six and a half years ago
SPEAKER_01: now they are in 95 kilo they both are different human beings you know yeah they both have a big frame to kind of so it's not a big surprise that they can go up like that uh but yeah i still think oniani will probably catch talgat and talgat will um not be strong enough to in the static way and this is a super match you know it's not a um tournament so it's much easier maybe to
SPEAKER_02: top of that match over a couple of rounds so i feel like on ian is a bit more of a static endurance i think he can catch like it yeah roman roman he lost his channel and now he's chatting as east versus west arm wrestling and he thinks that this is not professional to use my other channel for chat no no go ahead roman go ahead no problem my friend
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I mean, last time when I saw them pull, 2017, he was, I think, hungry. They were in 75 kilos. Paul got boom, you know, and then Onyani stopped him here and then slowly lift him, lift him, lift him, lift him, lift him and beat him. But now, 95 kilos, six and a half years, Onyani has not been that active. While Aktaev just non-stop competing. Yeah, we will see. It's an incredible match.
SPEAKER_02: I'm just curious if Talgat can still win if Badkili stops him. That's my question. Because usually Badkili, I mean, when he stops someone,
SPEAKER_02: is winning, except I saw him, of course, in his position. He was stopped like this by Oleg, he couldn't beat him. But whenever he stopped Rez, but Rez is another freak, you know, about the endurance. Yeah. So do you remember they had like two minutes or something on the match? Yeah, impressive. Yeah. But I remember Akteyev also got into winning position against Daniel Prokopchuk.
SPEAKER_01: at the 2017 Zloty and then he won the match, you know. Let's see how it will be. True, it seems like Aktaev is getting also a little bit better in the static way, like he's not only speed anymore, he has a bit of static power as well. Okay. This one is really interesting.
SPEAKER_02: But I think the guy on the right is favorite. Just joking. Windago Tarasaitis, Artur Makaro. We did analyze him, but just with objective eyes. How the match is going? Worst case scenario is 4-2 in my way. Maybe it's going to be 4-0. But worst case, I'm winning 4-2. 4-2. Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Jaleb Williams, is it true East vs. West is coming to America? Yes, my friend. Florida, August, hopefully. And there was another Super Chat that I forgot. Let's see. Superboy, will you call out Engin at East vs. West 12 when you win? No, he's too scared to do that. I'll just say, like, in the interview afterwards, I'll say...
SPEAKER_01: Congratulations, Engin. I did it for you. You don't have to be afraid anymore of Makaru. I did it for you. That's what I will say. Give me a favour. Ask Arthur. Maybe you can make a superchat when he comes here.
SPEAKER_02: or i can give you his contact ask him like did you beat engine second time when you guys had a match just ask him what he will say of course he will say yes easily no that's not what he said he said and you beat me that's what he said he was just being nice it is not because he knows that i beat him but i got injured you know you know that too you know that too no no no i think it was easy listen alan zole beat him two matches at the 2021
SPEAKER_02: worse it took more than two minutes my two wins against him was nine seconds together nine seconds and i my bicep was torn and still fought him in the third rounds do you know how i injured my bicep did i tell you how i did no do you know how what i did was just um
SPEAKER_02: round two i saw him getting so like kind of like more closer and tighter so i thought he was gonna go inside so what i did i i was training you know yusuf yusuf when he holds like this at that time he couldn't beat me but i couldn't beat him either like we were like this of course then i was getting exhausted but whenever i put my right feet to do the corner and then whenever i do that he was coming like this so whenever arthur did that
SPEAKER_02: came close, I put my foot to that corner. So whenever I pull him so strong, his hand came like nothing, you know. But I can show you the photo. In this step, you cannot do this to him. Whenever I pull him, his hand even slides in his head. Yeah, I saw that one. Yeah, I pulled him so terribly, you know. So he came so easy. But whenever you even don't have any resistance with the fingers, just forget about the wrist. Everything was gone.
SPEAKER_02: And then whenever you more pull him, in fact, you are pulling his legs from the table. You understand? Because there is nothing more to it. So more I pull, more it was like this. Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick. You know, from here, something slided down. A lot of stress on the biceps, right? Yeah, yeah. Because it was unnecessary. It was unnecessary. I didn't have to do that. But whenever I took his wrist, he was already like this. So I was able to come close and pin him.
SPEAKER_01: But when you're like being up on the table, it's sometimes also you a little bit somehow difficult to maybe come back, you know, because you want to kind of just finish.
SPEAKER_02: No, I finished him already that round. Whenever I had the injury that round, I bring and then I beat him. But I went to Said and I said to Niyazi, I said, listen, the bicep went. He's like, don't worry, one more round is easy. I said, I heard it, you know, I went down. Yeah, he's like, go, go, go. And I was like, okay. And then I went there. It was already gone, you know, because now we started like this.
SPEAKER_02: he wasn't like this anymore you understand like this yeah so whatever you know yeah you can believe whatever you want but he knows the truth you know anyways i know you're teasing me but yeah uh it's okay i will come back and beat you um okay nikishawa versus fear so do we know if uh
SPEAKER_02: Nikki Sheva is still in a good shape. Is she training? She has been training because I offered her a match before. She was not in shape and she didn't accept. And then she said she would be ready for April. And then I asked her again and she said, okay, yeah. Isn't she a bit bigger than Fia? No. No. If she's not bigger, then I would take Fia because...
SPEAKER_01: Tia was much more active now, right? She was always competing. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I think just because of that. Mm-hmm. Okay. Irakli Zdrakashvili Oleg Petrenko. Mm-hmm. Yeah, two tough Jack guys. I can say something interesting about Irakli, which I noticed. Yeah, okay. For quite a few years, I was somehow...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I didn't like how Irakli just blew up and became very, you know, much bigger. And I think he lost some endurance and, you know, so I thought that it was a bad kind of move from him. But now last time, last event, I really noticed how he's really warming up super well. But do you realize that he went down to 95 kilos? Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: so maybe this weight is much better for him because he was really I could clearly see that his endurance is much much better now so and the never arm wrestler has good endurance he immediately gets respect from me because he shows that it's not only about just the muscle size it's also about um yeah but he is normally like 100 kilo he walks around 100 kilo
SPEAKER_02: is right now like in between 105 and 95 if 95 is losing if 105 maybe he's gaining a couple of kilo one 102 103 and then he's putting 105 so this match is gonna be at 105. so yeah what i was trying to say is with iraq lately i like his um his style and everything so i think he's pretty good his last two matches sorry cutting you last two matches was against hook pullers rustam and pauline but
SPEAKER_02: Petrenko is a little bit more with the back pressure. And Irakli's losses, Dadikyan and Ongarbe was top rollers. And even John top rolled Irakli, and Irakli was able to win this way. But so Irakli is deadly against the hook pullers. Top rollers, he is still great, but sometimes he struggles. So I just want to do,
SPEAKER_01: Like a big, big perspective for you before you, yeah. And yeah, of course, I know that Oleg is also doing very well lately. He just defeated Marci, right? Yeah. And then he beat Chen Zhou. Right, before. Yeah. So, both, they both seem to be in a pretty good condition now. Seems like this is probably the best shape of their life.
SPEAKER_01: I would still guess that maybe Oleg can take Irakli's wrist somehow, just by going backwards. As you said, maybe Irakli is sometimes a bit better against the poke, not so good against the top roll. Maybe same like me, I guess, a little bit. Even if I am a good top roller, you can sometimes open my wrist. So yeah, I'm going to Oleg, just guessing that Oleg will maybe open Irakli's wrist.
SPEAKER_01: yeah okay okay now we have we have the next one we have schoolboy versus leonidas yeah well but i'm sure both got stronger since the last time we saw them um if schoolboy is smart enough i think he could for sure win
SPEAKER_01: I just want Coolboy to be sometimes a little bit defensive. Don't try to finish it immediately. Because, you know, Leonidas is very good at this open move where he just kind of goes, keeps dragging people. And if you try to finish the match while he's doing that, he will for sure open you up, right? So I would suggest Coolboy to just kind of follow it a little bit. Maybe be brave enough, sit a bit close to the pin pad.
SPEAKER_02: And I think after a couple of seconds, Leonidas should be tired and then Skubo can... I don't think Leonidas gets tired so quickly. I think he has incredible endurance. I have seen his side table matches after his vs. West events. And at the last, not the last, but King of the Table 9, you saw his match with Larry Wills. Yep.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, he exhausted Larry Wills. I'm not saying Larry has the best endurance, but still, even in the practices over here, he's sometimes pulled with some of the real top guys here. Of course, it's practice only, but he is really strong. Let's see how it will be. And Arsene Lille versus Brandon Assasore. Yeah, so this is an interesting one, right? How come did you choose Brandon for Arsene?
SPEAKER_02: I mean, I don't know. The guy has been away 11 years. This is not like three years, two years. You sit down 11 years, do nothing, become a fat 120-kilo guy. You understand? And then you come into East versus West 10, watching Dennis versus Devon, and falling into the trap of Engin. And then you get inspired again. And then...
SPEAKER_02: decided to train and he did only like little bit cardio or something till the new year. And by the January, he started training. January, February, March, April 20. Little bit more than three months training after 11 years. Like, did you expect me to put him against Dariken or something? So is there any weight limit? Ah, yeah. I think one, not I think 105. 105. Okay. Yeah. I understand what you're saying.
SPEAKER_02: I talked with Brandon. Brandon said he will be one of our Brandon. Even when he was against David Samusha, he was huge. Right now, his biceps are 50 centimeters. I think he's good. You know, he's very good. He beat Craig Tuller in the US. I guess, yeah, it's fair enough, right, Brandon? Yeah. Yeah. But then it's very hard to make, very hard to guess, very hard to make a prediction.
SPEAKER_01: I would guess that maybe still Arsene takes it because stylistically, I think he's okay. He'll probably open. Do you think three months training after 11 years, he can be still good? Three months. Imagine like 11 years, you know, like just, just say that he gets stopped, you know, what kind of endurance can he have? True. True. So, yeah, but again, maybe I'm thinking that in those three months, depending on where, um,
SPEAKER_01: diet he chooses to follow i think like there is a chance that he um can bring his explosive power back up quite quickly of course not to the levels which he was at but um i think he can explode through brandon's wrist and at least secure the wrist position and then maybe he can finish afterwards brandon can pull this way as well you know i i remember how he stopped craig tuller and then at the end he beat him no it's for sure it's for sure not a super easy one it's uh
SPEAKER_01: it's a tough match but um yeah yeah it's not super easy forget about it i'm not even sure it's easy yeah yeah it would be beautiful if uh brandon somehow traps arson in some lane and then he stops the match and then he can exhaust arson that would be useful i would enjoy that okay okay let's go to the next one
SPEAKER_01: From now on, all the matches are even hotter and hotter. Michael Todd versus Frank Lamparelli. Yep, yep. Frank did very well against Matt Mask, so that was beautiful to see. But then Michael Todd is also looking very good. His victory against Pablo was nice. It seemed like he was almost not even...
SPEAKER_01: pushing too hard to get that win. So I don't know. Michael looks very good now. I have a feeling that he might stop Lamparelli in some way as well. And then maybe Lamparelli cannot really pin Michael. Yeah, I mean, I can see Lamparelli having the hand control. He is great at this.
SPEAKER_02: And last time it doesn't matter, right? It doesn't matter against Michael so much. I mean, it matters only if you also have the finishing power. So we will see that if Frank has the finishing power or not. By the way, I put the guy to time limits, not because he says Devon is the god, but it's because he repeated the same thing six times. Guys, one time is enough. Please, no spamming, you know.
SPEAKER_02: um yeah i mean michael did you see his match with uh paulo yeah and it looked like he was comfortable he was strong but a little bit risk problem yeah yeah so that that is what frank wants but let's see where the match go i don't see easy match for neither side michael also has that press uh so if
SPEAKER_01: power goes down a little bit after a couple of rounds maybe michael can just start jumping into the press immediately which normally is very hard to catch for the top roller guy you know so i can i can see michael having an advantage actually yeah yeah and and when when when uh matt math did the flop risk pressure to frank
SPEAKER_02: it was not so comfortable for Frank. I mean, Frank won at the end, but I think he lost one round on the fouls. Let's see. Let's see. Let's go to the next one. David Samusha versus Aydar Khan. Yep. You pulled 77 kilos Aydar Khan. Now it's 85 kilos Aydar Khan against 85 kilos Samusha. I'm thinking that maybe...
SPEAKER_01: I don't think that Aydar Khan can just keep gaining power equally as he's gaining weight. You know, of course, it's understandable. He was at some point maybe 60, 65 kilo. So, of course, up to 75, it's fine. But 85, maybe it's a little bit too much for him, I'm thinking. Yeah, but he won just 81. Right. And then he beat Wallah at 85 kilo.
SPEAKER_02: Vala is very, very strong guy, trust me. Vala is incredibly strong guy. I still cannot imagine how Aydar can beat him that comfortably except round one. True, true. He was like this and it seemed like something happened after round one. He found a good lane. Yeah, round one, he tried to top roll him. It is very, very hard to top roll Vala. Very hard. Like many of the Georgians also said to me that I don't want to mention the names.
SPEAKER_02: they are not able to top roll Vala. And whenever he tried to top roll, if you realize he couldn't, he was losing and he just jumped into the hook and then he was already under and then Vala beat him. But after that, he put to this side like this. He hit not really hook, but he did like side pressure, like inner side pressure, I should say, with the supination and hit sideways and he was very,
SPEAKER_01: quick yeah it looked like he just went through it somehow found a good line yeah yeah and so that that's the thing we do either he can pull in different directions yeah yeah what were you saying so i still think that this is a match where two pillars are very different one of them is very good at endurance game another one is a bit better at explosive game
SPEAKER_01: seems like they are kind of equally matched we just we will just have to see who is able to apply the technique you know which way like is either I'm gonna explode and put um Samusha in a bad position or will someone should just kind of bring it in and make it stick 50 50 pretty much hard to tell almost cannot choose the winner actually almost cannot choose them
SPEAKER_01: So you are saying that this is probably one of the toughest challenges for Samusha so far? Yeah, because you see, whenever you meet... Samusha maybe is the best at the endurance game. If he meets someone who is as explosive as Aydar Khan, maybe Aydar Khan will be able to simply ignore Samusha's endurance. Maybe it will not matter. What do you say if Aydar Khan topples him, like Daniel did it?
SPEAKER_01: Do you think that there is a possibility for Samusha still like that or Aydar Khan would be different now? I think Aydar Khan would finish it because... Could he finish four times? Maybe. He's not necessarily getting tired as quickly as you are. So maybe. Okay. And also you see Samusha finished Daniel because Daniel is allowing...
SPEAKER_02: giving time to Samusha, you know, to kind of switch and maybe press. I don't think Aydar Khan will give that much time to Samusha. The one round when Samusha tried to hook him, Prokopchuk has also risked and he was able to, but I realized that the other round he didn't go that way. He went more like with pronation Samusha. So he was to the far hand or the
SPEAKER_02: Prokopchuk, you understand? Not to here. Whenever you come here, you give your pronator, and the guy has this, everything is different. But whenever you do back pressure and go, if you realize that one of the rounds, Samusha lost the wrist at the end, you know. Just watch again, you will see that Samusha took his wrist. Because... Because... Like...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it's much more difficult for Daniel to have all the power when he's a little bit like... The top roll of Prokofiev is not more like the hand, but more like from here. So when the guy is coming to his arm, he's very comfortable here. But whenever the guy is not really coming to his arm, and then whenever Prokofiev does this, and then his hand is a little bit unprotected. That is why I think he's very good.
SPEAKER_02: as a top roller against the hook pullers, but not against the top rollers. Do you remember when he tried to top roll you? Like many times here when he pulled in 85 kilo, he went outside with Corey Miller, with dog Eric, you know, but he did not try with you. Yeah, I didn't even try. No, he didn't even try with you. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, so
SPEAKER_02: Let's go. By the way, I'm 2-0 against Aydar Khan. Just be careful when you do comparing, you know. Very nice, very nice, thank you. Okay, yeah. Let's not think about the past so much, we know what it will... I will just remember all these things when I'm training and coming back. Georgi Svetko versus Alex Kurdecha.
SPEAKER_01: Right, and this is on right hand. Right hand, yeah. Good match. Seems to be a close one. Kurdecha is still improving. But then Georgi on the right hand has a very nice top roll. I think stylistically Georgi has a bit of an advantage. I'm just not sure if Kurdecha is too strong or not. Kurdecha might be too strong.
SPEAKER_02: But I'm still, let's say, going for Georgi. I think he will open the hand and slowly finish the match. So, Kurdeshe Zvini? Georgi. Georgi Zvini. Did you know that these two pulled before? Probably, but I don't remember the result. Yeah, Zlotitur. 2017, the event that I flashed you.
SPEAKER_02: Okay. Great, great reminder. Thank you. I mean, if you are putting those words to me, like his endurance is not like yours or something, then of course I'm going to also do this kind of thing. So just be ready. I have so many weapons here, so be careful. Okay. Hermes Gasparini, Alijan Murado. Yeah. So this is again, a tough one really depends on whoever
SPEAKER_01: is able to get into the better position um so can Hermes really yeah again I guess Hermes could I can see ever stop rolling Alijan but I can also see Alijan being a little bit too brutal and just kind of damaging Hermes over a couple of rounds of blood um let me go with Alijan
SPEAKER_01: maybe he will also get his traps maybe he'll just sink it that quick good hook or if not he will at least do some damage and then be more successful the next round yeah i mean alijan has won two super heavyweight world titles at love but he also won some matches at the east versus west but i don't think that alijan has
SPEAKER_02: ever met someone as Hermes, who is a top row specialist. Like I think he's just, if you talk about like top row specialists, guys, especially against the hoopers, you are there. Irakli is there. Hermes is there. That's why I choose three of you, like a feature, you know, right now you all are right here, you know, and
SPEAKER_02: So it is not that easy to hook Hermes, especially this guy is now getting ready for a Danish match. Maybe I want to change my mind, actually. Because when I think about it, maybe Alisson never really met someone at that crazy high level. He had Cody Merritt, and Cody flattened his wrist like this. He catch him like this and he hit him.
SPEAKER_02: Cody is super powerful, but technically, I don't think that he's as good as Hermes. And also, I don't think Corey is at the same power level as Hermes. I think Hermes is maybe in a very good stage now. Yeah. Maybe Hermes' power will just be too much. Yeah. Hermes says he's going to be 130 kilos, and he says that there is no 105-kilo guy in the world that can beat him.
SPEAKER_02: It doesn't matter if it is left or something. And yeah, he's trying to be smart, trying to top roll. Hard to really overpower someone who has so much power plus that style. Will it be exciting for you to watch them coming to the table now? Just imagine you are right there.
SPEAKER_02: And then they come, Alijan here, Hermes here. To me, it's very, very, very exciting. Not always the best matches are in the same category. Some guys are too much for their category. Like Alijan, yeah. And I almost look at Alijan as he is like almost a pretty big guy by now. He's not that much smaller anyways. Yeah. And he still continues competing well. Yeah. So you are saying that barely, barely...
SPEAKER_02: Hermes? Favourite? I think maybe a bigger favourite, actually, than I think about now. If you talk a little bit more, you're going to say 100%. You see I'm switching. So maybe I'm making a wider perspective for you, more I talk. Yeah, exactly. I just remember how Hermes is a very strong guy. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You can do PayPal to me, all this advice and thing, you know, $100. All this knowledge.
SPEAKER_02: Okay. And then, and then the big match. Devon Larratt. Devon Larratt. What? So we did talk about all the others already, right? Yes, yes, yes, yes. That was quick. Last three was before this, Ermes, Ali Can, David Samusha, Aydar Khan, and Georges Svetkov, Kurdesha. Now we have the, probably the biggest match of the history. And do you think, do you think
SPEAKER_02: since their match together with the stem cell like i was there in dubai when devon pulled dave chaffee and he intentionally went deadless pressure shoulder right with the starts i mean i know he has tons of damage they've been pulling like almost 30 years because i know myself if i would do such thing like this i would be screaming like i cannot even imagine myself doing something like that
SPEAKER_02: So what I just say, he was able to do that, and he did that intentionally. Right now, he is able to pull all kinds of directions. Whenever...Mindagas, you are a smart guy. That's why I easily can discuss with you about arm wrestling. You are knowledgeable, smart, you know. Whenever, just say that some parts, some muscle groups are injured, you cannot use it.
SPEAKER_02: Trust me, it costs you a lot. Once you have these muscle groups supporting the other muscle, even the main muscle groups, trust me, it is like suddenly 10%, 20% addition. It's not something hormonal because something is just coming back. Like you had five fingers, you lost two of them, and this two comes back. It is almost the same thing. I don't know what you're talking about. Yeah. So that one is like that.
SPEAKER_02: him pulling against uh georgie swedco ermes dennis triplenko some other matches you know he pulled dave chaffee um do you think that this is the same guy that we saw two years ago against levan or you think that right now he is in different shape just your opinion
SPEAKER_01: No, Devon, I see him improving for sure. Like mostly just because he's finally a bit healthier and I hope he just stays healthy because, you know, normally if you trained in some way, which little by little made you injured and then let's say, okay, you've got the stem cells, you healed up. If you still keep in my mind, if you still keep training in similar ways, you know, maybe you are still doing something a little bit wrong. So you might get injured again in the future.
SPEAKER_02: So I just hope that Devon just stays on the good path. Maybe he can... Do you think that he got injured only because he trained wrong? Or is it because of 30 years of damage, you know? I mean, just imagine John Bersink. Has Paul Cleveland, Richard Lapkus, Gary Goodrich, Alan Carrer, Andrei Pushkar.
SPEAKER_01: Ferit Osman, Denis Triplenkov, like all those guys, you know, don't you think that handling all that pressure, like it just makes your joints, you know, like, I mean, overuse, you understand? Overuse. Yeah. So I know, I know your opinion about this, but I think I have a different one where I feel like any kind of overuse is also kind of like you can almost choose how much overuse you want to go through. So, um,
SPEAKER_02: how are you going to choose you need to handle that pressure yeah yeah but so you can handle it in different ways um this is already hard to handle you need to push your limits there is not like you have 10 options let me handle this way or this way or something i mean you barely win the match it is just a giant 250 kilo guy that is all over on your arm so what i'm just saying that you there is an age factor just john is 60 years if you think that john is six years and he is injured because he did wrong things
SPEAKER_01: I mean, it is wrong, healthy way, but to win, he had to push his limits, you know? Yeah, so I understand completely. I'm just trying to highlight the fact that I think many people still could maybe be a little bit better during the training, do some more correct things to maintain the healthy muscle, healthy joints, healthy everything.
SPEAKER_01: I think people sometimes are making mistakes and because of that, many injuries are caused. Even some freak injuries are maybe caused by just you not being completely balanced. Just my opinion. I feel like people can really... No, I understand. Like, Gianni Samorini is probably one of the best guys. Like, physiotherapy and this and this. If I could afford an advisor, he would be my advisor about...
SPEAKER_02: how to take care of my health you know what to do exercise even he has tons of injuries yeah so but even so even he i think he's making some mistakes but it's not about mistake this is just nature this is what we are doing our support even it doesn't mean that we always get injured at training at the table we got injured because of this is like uh like i am created to use this arm that way when the pressure
SPEAKER_02: coming this way, you understand? Like, I don't think that this is, like, created for arm wrestling, you know? I mean, that pressure, and then to not to lose, you put to your joints, everything, you know, in dangerous position. Just remember how John beat Taras from here. He was hanging on his arm, you know, and then he brought him
SPEAKER_02: this way it is not because he choose to be in that position but that is very bad for your health you know for your joints you know and you do everything possible you cannot say let me choose the the most healthy way so i wouldn't uh let me put it in a different way for example
SPEAKER_02: uh some of the georgian guys like um the the one who is pulling petromargarine now and also maybe gennady just recently you know these guys keep lifting crazy weights right in yeah i understand that that is but you are thinking that you are generalizing everything like controllable that is controllable you don't need to push that much exactly during the arm wrestling match to win when you force your limits you may have to pull in unhealthy positions you understand
SPEAKER_02: understand like whenever you say like he shouldn't do just say 80 kilo he wouldn't get hurt here at the table sometimes you really do even 90 kilo i mean because you don't want to lose you know but you could also just lose yeah i understand but just yeah i mean if that is the way to survive then i mean nobody would force themselves you know for example you know i would not
SPEAKER_01: pull continue pulling in the position which is super terrible and i know that i might get injured you know i would not risk it i will kind of take it yeah that i understand but whenever you generalize like everything happens in the training you know at the table also happen and i'm 100 sure that you experience some injuries as well you know so true so but you see now through all of that experience i'm kind of changing my mindset trying to there will be more experiences
SPEAKER_02: Let's get a little bit older. How old are you now? 32, 31? I'm 42. 32. Yeah. 32. Yeah, okay. Just come to 45 if you are still pulling. Let's have another conversation with you. Yeah, I think I'm on the right track to maintain my strength and everything. I hope so. I hope so. Yeah. And just, okay, let's go about the match. Like, who's winning there? What's happening? How do you see? They had put the strap...
SPEAKER_01: ready go what's happening is there any chance for devon i think i will just repeat exactly the same words as i said before the last match we had i i was saying that nobody else except levan has that kind of hand and devon is very focused on attacking the hand
SPEAKER_01: And suddenly, since Levan's hand is strong enough, Levan can almost ignore all of Devon's abilities in my mind. So I feel like that's a big problem for Devon. And I think that Levan will just once again control the hand. He will not lose it and then finish the match. So what if somehow Devon applies a little bit more and then Levan just...
SPEAKER_01: So, yeah, if we get just a little bit of that, it's bad news for Levan. It is bad news for Levan. Do you see the match stopping and Levan still winning? No. But it depends on where, how close to the pad? Yeah, so if Devon is able to, let's say, do a little bit like this much, I think then it's Devon.
SPEAKER_01: But just say that if it is that close to there and then it may still be. Does it matter where the match is? Here is the starting position. Here is the finishing position. I expect Levan to somehow control it in the center. Start going sideways and maybe this is the dangerous zone, right? At the end, close to the pad. The halfway. Yeah. But I still think that Levan has...
SPEAKER_02: Well, Levan injured his wrist also, right? Yeah, and the thing is that Devon's pronation lift, he said he told me, some people said it was 150, but he told me before Levan match, he said that it was 135 pounds he was able to do. He recently did 160. If he does like two more pounds or something, it is 20% more than last time. 20% more.
SPEAKER_02: And that pressure is going to be applied to Levan's wrist. And the thing is that you don't want your wrist to be moving that way when you are pulling Devon. If Levan's wrist handles, yeah, he's going to win. I remember for Devon, like he is doing maybe this kind of clean move-ish. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: also really needs to maintain his rising ability right yeah and i feel like levan can also maybe take a little bit of that and suddenly it's very difficult for devon to execute his move yeah i think his hand his fingers everything so strong with uh levan yeah i think i think to take levan's risk you need to
SPEAKER_02: control his rise a little bit before you pull this if your hand is getting melted in his hand you can't just run away too much you need to really control here and then hit here if you just pull yourself like this and then in his hand your hand will be melted like this yeah that's why i think it's the problem for that one yeah so i think he needs to be more connected to the center than just going away like this but they both know what to do but this we are just
SPEAKER_02: sharing our opinion. So, and I also mentioned this before, that at that time, every match started in strap. This time the match will start without the strap. It can mean two things. One, Levan may be without the strap or it may mean that there will be instead of four, there will be
SPEAKER_02: manages to go to step. So more starts also in the favour of Devon if the power is close. So we need a good referee to make sure that Devon doesn't cheat too much. I don't know. I talk with referees all the time the same thing. I say, like, listen, you can ask any referee, I can show you from my WhatsApp group. Not because I don't trust anyone or something, but it is ethically
SPEAKER_02: No referee knows which match they are going to ref until 8 o'clock, 8 p.m. When the competition starts, boom, I send them the message. And then they, at that time, when the competition starts, they learn which match they are going to. It is from the right beginning till today. 8 o'clock, at the last moment, everyone knows which match they are going to. I feel like it's more ethical. It's not because of the trust or something. I just do it.
SPEAKER_02: with everyone, you understand? Even if my brother was there for refing, I would do the same thing as an ethical boy. I told them that every athlete, like we don't care who they are. Every athlete sweats the same sweat. It doesn't matter from Kazakhstan or Russia or America. So you need to be 100% fair and square and don't get any, how do you go, intimidation, you call?
SPEAKER_02: right yeah so i i just like every i can even share uh our whatsapp chats you know after the event my like the speech you know we do um so for me the only thing i want is just a fair competition but sometimes some people cannot handle that pressure i'm not saying this person or that person but sometimes it is not but i believe i would handle
SPEAKER_02: think so too i think i would handle it as well but yeah yeah i would handle and i i all only thing i expect is just 100 fair and square uh competition and i have no doubt about the intention of the referees exactly yeah it's some doubts about the ability to
SPEAKER_02: be strong enough overall kind of the psychology of the referees you know to handle the pressure because it is really big match you know just I mean it is I trust myself but even when I go there this side you have Levan you say this side you have Devon that is not that easy to ref that match you know in many different reasons you know so much power there so much I don't know you understand my point it's just like yeah so you you think you think Devon cheats
SPEAKER_01: I think sometimes, no, he's not cheating, you know, he's just doing his job. But we need sometimes a better referee to enforce the rules a bit more correctly. That's it. So I hope the referee will be strong enough to enforce it correctly. Yeah, I believe, I mean, I have seen like one time against Prudnik, I think he was under and the foul called
SPEAKER_02: about 10 seconds late, you understand? And I was the one told referee that, you know, the shoulder is below, you know, I told this to Devon as well, you know. And there has been mistakes, but people also claim I didn't see the elbow. Referee said that he saw it, but from the camera angle, you cannot see. The first round of Devon versus Gennady, when Risto called the foul for Devon,
SPEAKER_02: People also think that at that time it was unfair to Devin. But from camera angle, you cannot see. Because at that point, he was filming from the front side of Devin. So I'm just saying that the mistakes can happen sometimes in somebody's favour, sometimes other guy's favour. But I honestly believe that Devin was better than the athletes that he won against.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, you're right. In most cases, yes. Yeah, I don't see him, like, Hermes match, yeah, maybe Hermes couldn't start as he wishes or something, but I don't think it was the reason. If it wasn't the reason, Hermes wouldn't tell me, Engin, you know, like, how to this, how to this, you know, what to do more.
SPEAKER_02: As soon as he went there, Hermes is a smart guy. Hermes felt it like it was... Yeah, there was something else, you know, not only because of something, you know, but there was some problem, you know, with the technical issues. If Hermes didn't experience, if Hermes would dominate Devon on that day, I mean, with the side pressure or something, you know, or if Hermes didn't have that match on that day, trust me, he would lose to Laletin. Trust me.
SPEAKER_02: Right after that match, he only focused on his riser, his wrist, everything. Because in the past, Ermes' hand and wrist was ahead of here. Later, he gained weight, he more cared about the arm, horsepower, and everything. He kind of here, kind of went back, behind this power. So he really trained so hard for hand, wrist, and riser before the match, and he was still barely, he barely stopped him and then brought him, you know, so...
SPEAKER_02: What I'm just saying that Devon has so many haters, but we need to also give him the credit that, you know, like he was really, his hand, wrist, everything was better, you know, my opinion. Hermes told me that after the match, they again pull and Devon was better again. I don't know, next day they pull it, but even that night, I pull with Devon.
SPEAKER_02: with Devon. And then, and we were lucky almost in the morning. And then next day, Hermes pulled Devon, I think, to pull. They pulled again, and Devon was still better. Hermes had his wrist like this, Devon was winning. And if Hermes started like this, he was winning quickly. But with the flat wrist, Devon was still... So even if they wanted to start by themselves,
SPEAKER_01: it was still the the same case you know but if there was some small referee mistakes yeah i mean we can talk about that too but i don't think it was the reason that you know so sometimes it's just a little bit um i don't like to see the matches where one guy gets tired too much in the setup while trying to get uh some yeah you know so that's a little bit sometimes looks
SPEAKER_01: It looks like Devon is sometimes successful at exhausting them just in the setup. You mean before they go? Yeah, before they go. So I think I would like to see Devon's opponents to be able to not have to fight so much before they go. That seems like they have to fight a lot sometimes. I understand. Anyway, so what are the winning chances? Very high for one. Percentage?
SPEAKER_02: 80% for Levan. 80% Levan. Did you know that Denis thought that Devon can beat, as far as I heard? And I heard that Laletin also said that he would bet on Devon. I wonder what they see, that Devon has more chance. And I wonder what you see, that Levan has more chance.
SPEAKER_01: maybe they just see that Devon is really really good at the moment meanwhile even if Devon is that much better now I still see Levon's hand being too dominant and then Devon's game just collapses that's what I think okay okay thank you very much by the way I actually wish Devon would win I'm I'm rooting for Devon but uh just trying to be realistic I think the one's hand is too too good okay
SPEAKER_02: Let's see how it will be. I just can't wait. They both are taking this match very seriously. I think this is the most important moment of Devon's career from his side. And for Levan, I think after his injury he couldn't pull more than one year. He's thirsty and also he received some hate after the Hermes match about those two.
SPEAKER_02: rounds that you know he could he couldn't continue and i think he has something to prove you know he wants to win and then just prove that he's the king you know this is what he wants to do well so pretty much both guys are very motivated right yes very motivated yeah incredible yeah and do you think do you think that
SPEAKER_02: devon uh like seeing this match as his most important match of his career well if he wins then it's a huge huge match for him yeah if if he loses then not so important i guess it is what it is but uh but he manages to win i think it's important because you want to
SPEAKER_02: You want to do something, you want to achieve something, and once you cannot do that, it is a big loss from your side. But if he wins, do you think that beating Levan will be the most important thing that Devon did in his career? To me, yes. Yeah, if he beats Levan, then it's a huge, huge match for Devon. Crazy achievement, just amazing.
SPEAKER_02: but you see for example the same like i did the prokopju i feel like i'm i have good achievement but if i lose to prokopchuk um then it's like ah just another match you know but i don't think i don't think that prokopchuk represents what levan represents this is like levan is someone that has not lost in a super match in his career and prokopchuk
SPEAKER_02: Prokopchuk won how many world titles? I think Prokopchuk won only this year in Kazakhstan, I think he won his first world title. Before, he never won with right hand. Never. And you might be right. Yeah. The year before, Aydar Khan beat him in Antalya. And the year before, Cerkasov beat him in final. So, I don't think with right hand Prokopchuk represents what Levan represents. I don't think there are
SPEAKER_02: many people that represents what Levan represents. Maybe Ali Can with left arm in 105 or something, but still, I think Levan did more than Ali Can did in professional arm wrestling. The guy beating, he started with Dimitri Turbin, and then top eight, and then Dave Chaffee, and then, I mean, the guy is undefeated. I mean, and- Yeah, you're right, you're right.
SPEAKER_01: But I was just kind of, you know, before going into the match with Prokopchuk, I was kind of seeing him as someone who made very big progress just lately. Like, because his latest matches or tournaments, he was just so dominant that everyone was almost just not even resisting. Yeah. But to me, Levan is the strongest super heavyweight, the strongest armwrestler who has ever lived. I don't think that Denis Tiplenko in his prime. Devon is my good friend.
SPEAKER_02: But I remember him with Pushkar, with Dave Chaffee. I mean, to me, Levan represents something that there has never been any human being. So Devon can beat him when suddenly it's a huge, huge, suddenly all the credit goes to Devon, basically. Yeah, yeah. This is what I try to say. Prokopchuk just won his first world title. But just remember there was no Alain Zolev there, no Makarov there.
SPEAKER_02: know i'm not saying he cannot beat them or something but the lebanon is not like that lebanon is just looking around like we cannot even find an opponent for the guy yeah whenever i i found him morozo people are oh why morozo whenever i put devon oh why david who am i gonna put from one side you are saying why this guy is just pulling twice a year and then from other side when we put the best ones and you are saying
SPEAKER_02: okay, this guy is not enough. What do you want, man? What do you want? Do you want him to pull or not pull? I mean, if there is not many people, it can be a serious opponent for him. So it just only means one thing that this guy is something else because I don't remember super heavyweight category being that strong in the history. I am witness of the last 30-something years. I never seen something like that today that is happening. All these guys are pulling against each other. At that time, there was...
SPEAKER_02: Dennis and the push car and then maybe one, two more. Way different level, yeah, completely different. Yeah, incredible. And now this guy, just the best we can put against him right now, Devin. The guy cleaned everything, cleaned everything, you know, except the Gennady match. But Gennady got injured, you know, that is what can we do? Devin was ready to pull Gennady again in August if Gennady didn't get injured. Not that Devin escaped. We cannot say Devin, oh, go with Gennady first. Why? The guy is injured. He was ready to pull him.
SPEAKER_02: Gennady couldn't, so why would Devin wait until Gennady gets in his best shape again? Why would he just sit down and just wait? Yeah, big match, huge match. Yeah, huge, huge. We will see. I mean, this is so big, this is De'Arpun's second time, but just Devin really did clean his way to the level. Yeah, he was...
SPEAKER_02: He was great. He met everyone. He beat Prudnik, and then Sandris, and then pulled Gena Dimash, and then Dave Chaffee, and then Hermes, and then Denis, and then Georgi Swetko. I mean, what else? People were saying, this guy is afraid of the Europeans. I'm not sure he's afraid of who now. Right now, whenever I ask some guys, I say, do you want to move Devon? They're like, no, not now. Give me a little bit of time, you know.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, trust me. That's how it is, you know. And the only guy that is just any time just ready is just Gennady. He is something else, you know. Gennady is really like, I mean, I cannot believe that he exhausted Devon, you know. But I know why he exhausted him. I have my own theory. When Devon went that way and he hit him so hard, so Devon couldn't keep his elbow. So he had to go inside. And whenever he went inside, his inside endurance,
SPEAKER_02: is not as good as his outside runners. He pulled 1,000 times in training that way and 10 times that way. So how can you expect? But now he is also going that way. And for the rematch, cannot rematch, Devon was going training this. He was going to go deep inside and we would watch incredible match. Yeah. So yeah, I think people in the comments are saying that whoever wins this match between Levon and Devon,
SPEAKER_02: Maybe they should face me next to... You? Yeah. It's unfair to them. Unfair to them. Listen, whenever we say that Levan is the strongest ever or something, listen, we are, of course, excluding Mindaugas. Some exceptions, yeah. Yeah, Mindaugas is just something different. There is no Levan, no John Brzee. Nobody has ever been at his level. And so if there is a misunderstanding, I apologize to you.
SPEAKER_02: No, no, I'm sure people in the comments, they understand when... Yeah, they understand. Okay. If you see any disrespect in this subject, I can block them. I'm very well known about blocking people. Very well known. I thank you very, very much, my friend, Mindagos. You are really an exception, you know, in the arm-wrestling world. You are one of the best top-rollers I have ever seen. And...
SPEAKER_02: uh even though my own experience is not that way but from outside looking yeah that's how this is facing you take care of yourself and we will see each other you will see each other 85 you know i cannot go but i keep training it's coming i will i will destroy you oh yeah i will destroy you you will see just don't get scared remember these words when i beat macaro what's that
SPEAKER_02: And remember these words after me beating Makaro, you know, don't start to run away after I beat him. Oh, after you beat him? No, it will even mean more to me to beat you. Okay, very good. It doesn't mean I'm done with Makaro either, you know, but we will see. You take care of yourself and get ready to see you in six weeks. Thank you, thank you, thank you, Indagos.
