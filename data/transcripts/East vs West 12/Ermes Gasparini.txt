SPEAKER_04: Hello guys. How are you all doing?
SPEAKER_04: Penguin Turbo, Alex, Stevie Guy, Daily, Daily, Alex. Alex, are you the Alexander that Travis has been talking about? Oh, yeah, yeah, sorry, sorry, Penguin Turbo, sorry, yeah. Hello, hello.
SPEAKER_04: Donne. Michael Merck. No, no, I just put their picture. I was going to put my picture with Hermes, but I decided to put their picture. Yep, Alexander. Steve Guy. Are you guys going to decide matchup for Hermes? No, we are going to just talk about Hermes' name.
SPEAKER_03: gaming X engine. Do you think Alexander can hold all the bells in all category? Most likely, most likely you still ask to trust family guy. God bless you and your family and the same entire arm wrestling community. I mean, so let me share the link on, um,
SPEAKER_04: Copy the link and share so more people can watch us. Okay, just about 30 seconds and I'm done. Todd and Oleg's love child, Engin and Ermes, big brother, little brother. You are right, you are right. Ettore.
SPEAKER_04: Good evening, Engin. Good evening, my friend. Hello, Mr. How are you? Thank you, my friend. I hope you are fine as well. Alexander came in. Sorry, I apologize. Hello to India. Yep, legendary t-shirts. This was East versus West 2. Okay, someone good just came.
SPEAKER_03: Hello, my friend. How are you? Good, good, good. Where is Alexander? I don't understand. You understand? You don't understand, really? You don't understand? No, really. I thought he made a mistake, a true mistake.
SPEAKER_03: With Vladimir. Yeah, but not only Vladimir. If you just go and check the Avtandil match. Maybe he speaks too fast. No, he also called Avtandil Tutberidze Alexander. So every foreign guy is Alexander. But really, I love the guy. The guy is just so funny. Yeah, he's a very funny guy, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: So how is everything? Everything's good, training normal. Now the pain, I don't have pain, maybe a little bit in the shoulder, but like nothing. Yeah, I'm happy because after Vitaly, I thought it was maybe a big problem, but because I felt a very big pain. But now,
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, training normal, everything normal, good shape. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, you train both arms or only one arm? Both, both. When I train specific exercises, I make more focus on my right every time. Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.
SPEAKER_02: When I have the rest for the gym for the right hand, I train the left. I don't wait to train nothing. OK. We'll see. That's good. I'm just sharing the link and I'll be back with you. OK, I just shared.
SPEAKER_02: So, your pain is less, you train both times. Yesterday I saw you were also training. Yeah, I saw this. Yeah, that's why I asked, you know. So, how did you like the event? Did you enjoy? Very, really, I think it was one of the most beautiful events. I agree, I agree. Because there was a lot of matches very close. And which matches surprised you? Dadikian. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: And Morozo with Kurdeca. Okay. And Alijan, super mega strong. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I didn't expect that. I mean, I was thinking that, you know, they both could win, but I didn't expect that kind of domination. Yeah, yeah. He closed, he waited, and bam. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: He had some little bit problem here, but once he came, it was even better for Frutnik to lock himself at the center, but then he just opened. At the last round, he just hold him, wait, wait, wait, wait, told him, I was like, wow. Just this guy really needs a super heavyweight match. Super heavyweight match he needs. If he's like this, he can go up the super heavyweight. Do you think that his chances are more
SPEAKER_03: against hook pullers or against top rollers like is it more possible to beat him inside or outside outside outside yeah yeah but but but someone like only we tell you right now yourself maybe yeah uh i can't do something good i i asked to him you know all the guys in the super heavyweights
SPEAKER_03: I mean, when it was your name, he was like, no, I need someone stronger. Really. No, no, really. Hey, okay. Fred, we can do. No, no, no. I don't want to do this to you. Can you beat him? Really, I want to prove my left. Because last time with Morozov,
SPEAKER_02: In the first round I pulled good, but I was completely exhausted after the match with Cefi. But I think if I was 100% only left, it was better for sure.
SPEAKER_03: your chances is higher against hook pullers or top rollers with left arm? Because I think it is more dangerous for you, someone like Laletin, than someone who is trying to hook you. When were you in a fresh match that hooked? I think the left for sure, for me, more easier with the hooker. Or hook puller. If I compare my arms,
SPEAKER_02: I think there are difference, minimum 20%, really. Left, right. I don't have the same connection, you understand? Here it's completely automatic. Here, yes, but I think if I put
SPEAKER_03: My focus on the training for some match, I can't look at the result, I think. I don't want this, this, this. Can you beat Alisson or not? Yeah, if you want. Yeah? If you want. But listen, listen, don't blame me later. I can ask him.
SPEAKER_02: Blame? What is it? Blame, like, you know, oh, Engin, why did you set me up with that guy? Ask him if he wants it. Maybe in April, if he wants it. Not Travis? Travis, my friend, you should, you should. I blocked it with my hand and in his elbow, he was like this and he pushed it. I...
SPEAKER_03: I heard only crack, crack, crack on his elbow. Yeah, yeah. Oh, there was some sound on his elbow. Yeah, you don't hear. I didn't hear. So I saw you talking about it at the dinner table. Yeah, yeah. Okay, I saw you. He took everything like this and you hold him and you did like this. But his elbow sounded like this. Yeah, something. You know, when the machine is too old, they need to put oil there.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, OK. OK, it was too dry. Yeah. OK, OK, I understand. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I think really very interesting for me, Vitaly Jean. I think he's the favourite. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. For the community, but...
SPEAKER_02: Listen, listen, listen. Did you just say he's the favorite? No, for the community, not for me. And for you? Not too much, but a little bit. 55-45? Yeah, like this. I have my position. Listen, do you know where the problem is? That it is very, very hard to hook you, you know, because you're like...
SPEAKER_03: Even round one, you know, with Morozov, you gave up from the hand. But later you get tired. When your hand gets tired, everything happens. But when your hand doesn't get tired, you use your pronator. Yeah, yeah. Because I know, I also pull outside. You are tired here. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. See, people are saying that Ali Can will swap you, Ernest.
SPEAKER_03: okay i like this this you like this yeah one second let's ask people because you think he cannot hook you you are saying he cannot hook you no no no no way no way okay one second let me ask people let's see what people will say you show this my friend
SPEAKER_03: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But be careful. Like, soon it will just go somewhere else. Oh, yeah. That one is big, too. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I train together every time, but... Okay. I am starting. Yep. I ask people. Let's see what they will say. Okay. So let's talk about some other things, you know. Yeah. Okay. You were saying something? Sorry.
SPEAKER_03: I put me two Armes. You put what? I can't vote. Oh, you voted? Yeah, Armes made it. Oh, listen, it's interesting. People think that you are going to win. You are 56%. Aligen is 44%. Oh. People think that Aligen cannot hook.
SPEAKER_03: Wow, that's an interesting match, wow. Listen... I saw the match, really, when I saw him with the American guy. Cody, yeah, because he was a little bit like this, right? For a moment, like... But I think Cody, he doesn't have... The pronation, only the... Yeah, he pulls it like... I mean, he has pronation, but I think your pronation is probably stronger. That is very interesting.
SPEAKER_03: Ali Can just destroyed Frutnik and on the poll you are 63% Ali Can is 64, 36 now. Because they love me. They know how strong you are? They love me. Oh, it's only because they love, they don't really believe? I don't know. Listen, when you say like that, it means that they don't believe it, but they vote for you only because they love you.
SPEAKER_03: which one is it they believe or not they know they know oh they know the truth okay okay okay that's interesting like how strong start you know while we were gonna talk about other things yeah that's interesting if you if you win this poll if you win this poll because i thought that happened that i'm gonna set that much if you win this poll like this right now
SPEAKER_03: I will say this much because that's surprising because people think that only Morozov, Laletin and Matushenko have a chance. Now, when I see that you are like right now 60 to 63%, that it means that there is another person that can be dangerous for him. That's interesting. Wow. Anyway, so... Okay, so... I put the ranking.
SPEAKER_02: Did you see the ranking? You are four, and Alijan is fifth. No, Alijan is four, me five. Is it? Let me check. Yeah, left. The left, yeah. First, Morozov. Yeah, second is Laletin. Burdeca, Alijan and me.
SPEAKER_02: Oh yeah, Alijan is fourth, you are fifth. And do you agree with this ranking? Every ranking I agree, really. So Alijan is stronger than you, you agree? There are correct things about this. So Alijan is where he deserves and you are at where you deserve. Yeah, because he pulled more than me on the left. I pulled only one time with Morozov.
SPEAKER_02: What do you think that you are? You are one arm second, the other one is fifth. Like you are very well balanced, you know, in the world ranking, you know? Yeah, we will see with the left. I think I can do. I have had every time pain here and there, but I don't know why. And maybe now it's better.
SPEAKER_02: Not too much inside, I feel pain here every time. Not too much. But I think if I prepare good without to push when I have some pain in the gym like this, without any pain.
SPEAKER_03: yeah that's that's interesting and he is not i mean he is just probably about the grip and everything he will be very comfortable i i never shake his hand no no no but i'm just saying that he is not like two meter five something he is not like top roller like so you will have your grip i need only to have a lot of power here to open because he will go here for sure and if
SPEAKER_03: This is already done. If you one more time just do that, I will have to ban you, my friend. Because people don't have to read your spam. You're disturbing other people more than you do me. Yeah, that's interesting. What did you think about the Mindagas vs. Daniel match?
SPEAKER_02: Very, very super fight. In the beginning, I thought completely dominant. Mismatch. I thought to say, round two like this. I was like, wow. The third match he won. Yeah. At the beginning, they were like this, this, this, this, and then slowly he lost his wrist. Yeah. He had very super good endurance, really.
SPEAKER_02: Very super. Very, very super fight. There is a super chat for you. GB19 is asking, Hermes, could you have beat Morozov if fresh match? Left? Yeah. I don't know. It would be a tougher match for sure. More tough than before. Yeah. Because when I was here, when I opened a little bit, if I was completely fresh, maybe I can continue
SPEAKER_03: But I don't know, really, because Moro's endurance is unbelievable, really. Crazy game. Guys, there are not enough matches to make the rankings, you know, like you all the time complain about rankings. Please, guys, please. I, by myself, organized 149 matches and I'm trying to build the rankings. There are some guys over there, they pull one match and they lost, but they are still ranked there. Cody Merritt had a...
SPEAKER_03: world title match with Morozov and Alijan beat Cody Maris. So don't act like, you know, he never pulled anyone in something. Just please, you know, just give him a break. So you are 60% after 173 votes. That's interesting. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And what do you think about Mairo, Vladimir Mairo? I was very impressed with Mairo. I should say, I should say Alexander, sorry.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, every match really crazy, really super close, incredible, really. Did you like the guy, the way he pulled? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I was very impressed. I was very impressed. With more training, he's a very big danger for that category. Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: yeah and and and and reno reno was also good like matushenko is super experienced if matushenko would make little make mistakes a little bit mistake he won marino yeah yeah but i know matushenko have more power here yeah
SPEAKER_02: But Ervino, really, for his age, is already incredible. Yeah, 19 years old. Did you see his hands? His hands are small. Did you feel his hands? Oh, like, I feel very good when you shake his hands. His fingers are very thin, his hands are very small. Normally, I'm lightweight, but it's the same as the hand size of mine, you know.
SPEAKER_02: I saw him the first time here two years ago. Supermatch in Italy. He won with Lamparelli, with Battaglia. They are very big guys. With Kamil from Poland. Very easy. Left, right, everything. Yeah, he's stronger. Family guy is asking a question.
SPEAKER_03: Do you see your biggest threat on right and left arms? How soon do you think before you beat them? Who is your biggest opponent with right and left? When do you think you will beat them all?
SPEAKER_02: most important most dangerous most dangerous biggest for right for the right right and left they are asking yeah right for suge i left i don't know i don't know really because maybe laliting so in your mind stylistically he looks to more dangerous side because of his build
SPEAKER_02: Lewand is super big, it's super difficult to take some advantage. Devon too, but put Lewand more, really. Because I think Devon, if I can grow up my level here, have more endurance for the set-up, I'm sure I have more power if I control the set-up with him.
SPEAKER_02: But Lewandowski has all these things. And on the left, maybe I can do something good with Morozov, with Kurdeca. But Laletin, in my mind, is the most dangerous. For sure.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know. Maybe Levan too, because we don't know Levan. I mean, Levan, I tried to encourage him about left arm, but he's like, I always have pain. He said it's what he says, you know. I showed him, he put his video two, three hours ago.
SPEAKER_03: He should pull, he should pull. I'm telling you, even 90% of Levan with left arm, I mean, would be up there, you know, somewhere, you know, most likely first. I mean, I shouldn't say this, but yeah. Yeah, yeah. They're asking, you know, where do you think that Daniel... They're asking us why Daniel got so quickly tired. And my opinion is,
SPEAKER_03: Not that he got so tired that first two rounds he hooked him. But they're asking why he was here like this first two rounds, in the third round he lost his wrist. But this is armwrestling, something like that. It's not because the first two rounds is different. Maybe the tap was not the same. It was like this.
SPEAKER_03: Minda was loaded from here, kept here far, so he couldn't. So he caught him, he was like this, and then they waited, waited, waited, waited, waited, and then once Minda was hit, he just came, you know. But you know when your hand is not 100%, it's like 50%, it's already down. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Sometimes when my hand is too pumped, really, I had the same problem with clarity. I can't close my hand with my finger on my thumbs here. I can't close
SPEAKER_03: And I put my finger like this. Especially if the guy really has a strong pressure here. Yeah. Because you don't want to start like this because during the match it will slide down anyways. So you are like, instead of sliding down and I'm losing my grip, I better start like this. I don't understand this, really. And I need to close like this because if I put my finger here when it's too pumped,
SPEAKER_02: I don't have grip with these two fingers, only these three.
SPEAKER_03: very important to have a good endurance in the hand super important oh yeah i mean that's the only thing that you pump listen like in your arm resting i never been like you know my hand is just so strong and my arm finished i mean here is the one that gets pumped and then once you cannot close your hand if your hand is pumped you cannot do pull up if your hand pump you cannot hold the dumbbell it will it will yeah go down so this endurance over here is the most important if he is not strong here
SPEAKER_02: You cannot even do pronation because your hand will be like this. You put only with the bicep, but you have 50% power without hand. Yeah, you're right. They're asking you, where would you rank Alexandri in the superweight category? Everybody knows he's the best of the best.
SPEAKER_02: I think it's more... What do you think about Lewand vs. Alexander? Close match? I think it's Alexander 55. For Alexander, right? Yeah. But be careful. Lewand may be getting upset with you. I show Lewand how he doesn't feel pain in his wrist in the video. Today, did you see his arm size?
SPEAKER_03: 58 and a half. Yeah, big, yeah. 54, 54. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But do you really believe that Devon would come, set a match? I'm not saying he will win. But do you believe that Devon would set a match if he believes that he's not going to win?
SPEAKER_02: Would you pull Levan again if you think you cannot beat him? Would you lose him twice if you are not ready? My friend, if you already won with everybody, the only option is Levan.
SPEAKER_03: No, no, no, but he could just very well pull Gennady, he could just tell Lewand to pull someone else. Do you think that Devon would come? Listen, I will tell you something, Devon wins or loses, it doesn't matter. I think now for Devon, this period of his life... Yeah, the best time, right? Yeah, the best time, very big level, best level.
SPEAKER_02: And maybe next year he doesn't have the same level. It's better to try now than to try one year later and maybe you have some problem. Can I ask another question? Do you think that Devon knows armwrestling very well?
SPEAKER_03: Do you think he learned something from their first match? Power is different, but did he learn? Do you think he knows what he needs to do? Win or lose depends on the power, but he knows what to do, right? For sure. There are a lot of people who like him. A lot of people don't like him because
SPEAKER_02: for the cheating, the set-up, like this, but for sure he's a legend and for sure he's super smart. Super smart in the training, in the set-up, in the... There is one smartass who's saying that Devon didn't learn anything. Do you agree with that, smartass?
SPEAKER_03: No. My friend, when you lose... How can he be so ignorant and confident at the same time with just what to do, you know? We are not saying he's going to win, but to say that he didn't learn anything, you really need to be... Me, when I found this Devon, I learned a lot. Of course you learn. Of course you learn. And you learn as much as you know about arm wrestling. Not everyone learns, you know. Like, the people who knows learn. John learns. Devon learns. You learn.
SPEAKER_03: I learned when you pull, you have an idea. After the event, I pulled a little bit with David Samusha. 3 a.m. in the morning, 3 a.m. Everyone left. Only five people in the auditorium. Of course, he had a super match. He was tired. I am like 65-70% and no good sleep for one week. I held his hand. It doesn't matter how strong we were. But he learned something and I learned something. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: If you pull with someone, if you feel some points, some weakness, you know maybe now it's better to train this or this. If I repeat, if I have the match with Lewandowski, I know what is better to do, for sure. For sure, this. My friend, you respect Devon or you don't respect him, it's a different subject.
SPEAKER_03: Respect is a different subject. Knowing arm wrestling, you need to accept. You may hate the guy, my friend Rob, but you accept the guy knows arm wrestling. Come on. Listen, you give to that at least, you know. Whatever. Yeah. Anyway, so. Finished. Sorry. Something hot for my throat, you know. Yeah. Yeah. Do you expect Devon to come here at his best shape?
SPEAKER_03: For sure. Now I saw he's sick. No, he's okay now. He was like one week, two days ago. But he is already 265 or something. He was a little bit lower for some time. What did you say? 120? Yeah, a little bit 120. I'm expecting him to end up at like 280 or something. And I think
SPEAKER_03: he will be in the best shape of his life, no doubt about it. I don't think he's... I know why they put Lewandowski as more favourite. Because Lewandowski is a lot hungry. Hungry and angry. Why do you think he's more hungry than Devon? Do you think Devon needs to prove something or Lewandowski needs to prove something? Lewandowski, after my match with him,
SPEAKER_02: to prove he's number one and no one can beat him. What prove? He already proved by beating him. Yeah, but I know and I saw and I heard many times from him. He take my match with him like losers, you know. Because a lot of people
SPEAKER_02: very disrespectful people put comment for oxygen like this you know and they think after one year out not back and to to win six zero without problem too yeah yeah but um i think devon has the goal that i cannot say here i cannot say but he has a very big goal
SPEAKER_03: I think, this is my guess, that he has a very big goal. You know, maybe, I mean, bigger than Lewand's. We will see, we will see. Maybe he has confidence for sure, Lewand. Because he already won with him.
SPEAKER_02: But he needs to stay alert a lot because if the match will be like the first and Devon can stop him more up than here, maybe there are big problems for Lewandowski. Maybe he's too tired, I don't know.
SPEAKER_02: maybe yeah yeah yeah yeah we will see only this i think can be good for for for them but uh another things i don't know i don't think level have big problem the only thing i know that they both have very strong dreams to fulfill
SPEAKER_03: I just don't know whose dreams are like more, I don't know, stronger. Because listen, you know it, like human body can produce more power when he wants more. And when you want more, you pay more price, you train harder, you do everything.
SPEAKER_03: like as you should but whenever you are like oh okay i'm good you know this and that and then yeah then then then then there is a i am sure that even like your professional career i can say that two years only a little bit more than two years i can say that it really started you know after kurdecha match and and i am 100 sure that that that two and a half years i think you'll learn
SPEAKER_03: a lot a lot of experience but do you know how it sounds to me it's not if you say two and a half years but it it sounds like i mean seems like or feels like five years five years six years like same for me me too if i think yes really it's no it's same it was just paper they started everything with the gennady yeah yeah the beginning of uh 2020
SPEAKER_03: No, no, end of 2021. Sorry, end of 2021. End of 2021, yeah. You pull first Kurdesha, then Gennady, then you pull Arif Ertem. But my first pay-per-view event was February 2022. Now, beginning of the 2024, so two years that I organized 10 events. First one was in the June 2021. It seems to me like five years. And if I think...
SPEAKER_02: How fast I climbed the ranking is incredible, really. If I thought two years ago to think where I am now, I don't know if I believe it or not.
SPEAKER_02: But that is because you wanted so much. Yeah, yeah. You put armwrestling to do almost like first place in your life, you know. Yeah, yeah, man. Really, I heard when Gennady, he said he now he feel to be armwrestler proud, proud? More proud after his first, this is what he said, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I feel the same, really. People ask me, in the past, not too much. But now, really, I feel very proud. You really feel like a star now, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah, really. You guys are superstars. I mean, in my book, you guys are superstars, for sure. No doubt.
SPEAKER_02: By the way, do you remember this one? Legendary. This is the event that you started first. All the t-shirts I have here. You have it? Yeah, that's good. Really, it's my life because I think only this and training now with this. Really.
SPEAKER_02: This is your dream, right? From childhood dream? Dream, dream, yeah. I know that, I know that. To live like this, I thought, no, impossible. Impossible. Maybe it's my dream, but I don't know if it will be like this. And now it's like this, and sometimes I think...
SPEAKER_03: very emotional i feel emotional to think about this really and and and this this month uh what's today 31st or february 1st february 1st today yeah yeah and and this month uh
SPEAKER_03: King of the Table. There are some matches that I would like to ask you. Okay. This is the next event, yeah. To me, I mean, I always disagree with people, you know, about, like, they are like, oh, this card, that card, you know. Like, even this event at East vs. West XI, my friend. Yeah. Like, to me, it was one of the, like, most exciting East vs. West. One of them, it was. And...
SPEAKER_03: I think that whenever I think the last two years of all these pay-per-views, I mean, if I remember a few matches that are the most exciting matches, I think one of them was Dave Chaffee versus Vitaly Laletin. Blood on the table, oxygen everywhere. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: After the match, Larratton a little bit complained about the referees and he said that he has some elbow issues, but we know that Dave Sheffield always have this neck issue as well. So I think that this time Larratton is going there to prove that he's actually better than Dave, while Dave is also going there to prove that he beat him and he will beat him again. How do you see this match?
SPEAKER_02: Dave Chaffee, now I don't know the shape of him because he was a little bit up and down, more down in this period. But really I felt Lalletti when he fought with me, crazy. Really I won only because I have
SPEAKER_02: a lot of power, my back pressure, pronation, and I calculated everything to be very good to take his wrist and with good technique. But for the power, really, we were close, 50-50. I think if he goes like when he fought with me,
SPEAKER_02: 65 70 percent win because i never trained like my last match three months like crazy you're talking about the latin match yeah and still it was a super super hard match super i think that the hardest match in my career i think this and the levan
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. He's for sure. You see, maybe Dave Chaffee has some surprises. Maybe now he's stronger. Just remember, he took some rest. For some time, he took rest. So we don't know how he's going to come back. His left arm match cannot be considered. His left arm is just like... Yeah, yeah, yeah. For sure, I think the first, maybe second match, close.
SPEAKER_02: After this, it will be the endurance. We will see if Lalletti will learn about shoulder press, to win with the shoulder press. But really, it's very interesting. Can I ask you something? They hold round one, scrap. Even that is a really big problem, to go to scrap with Vitaly.
SPEAKER_02: You know it, right? You know it. He was holding your fingers like... Yeah, yeah. You feel now my finger will be broken for sure. You feel your finger broken. He's strong, right? Very strong grip, right? Really. Unbelievable. You feel like something impossible to... Yeah, yeah. He's very, very strong, yeah. But for him, it's good technique.
SPEAKER_02: But another thing is if he continues to catch the figure, maybe his endurance will go down faster. Only this.
SPEAKER_03: One second. So do you think that it will be possible or not, Dave, to go to, but Dave is also like, if Dave goes to strap like this, it will be problematic.
SPEAKER_02: this is this and that is more probably possible yeah i thought to to do this with laletti to go on the the sleep for the strap yeah but i failed in the setup not good not good and uh
SPEAKER_03: But they even think he can go in the strap with the shoulder press. Just say that they went to the strap, ready, go. Who is passing the centre? Lalletti. You think? Because they're super-matched. Every round in the strap, he came here. Even with you, Dave, to the centre, you stopped him here. I don't know. Maybe Lalletti.
SPEAKER_02: A little bit, but they can hold very well. Maybe I made a mistake, but I think like this. What do you think about Reno vs. Baccio? That is also two 19-year-old guys, two future stars. Baccio didn't compete many times.
SPEAKER_03: Last year. Bacho won the WAF youth category. I think he was third place or something with the left in the seniors and right seniors. I think he didn't pull in 100 kilos. Yeah, last year he didn't. But he's going to pull now against Reno.
SPEAKER_02: I mean, I kind of believe that Bacho is the one with the stronger forearm, while Reno is the one with the stronger pressure. But how do you see this match? 50-50. But I think if Reno can start immediately, it's very super dangerous.
SPEAKER_02: And put a little favourite, Reno. But really, I don't know. Really, it's very close. And I don't show many, many times, but it's difficult to tell. Yeah. Okay, the poll finished. 447 votes. You have 60%. Alican has 40%.
SPEAKER_03: That is... Very hard people, huh? Okay, David Fletra. Wish you all health and strength. I make the... Okay, sorry. Make the world a better place. Showcasing good character in armwrestling. He's wishing you all the health and strength and then make the world a better place.
SPEAKER_03: place showcasing good character in arm wrestling. So, thank you, David. Yeah. Yeah, it is very interesting, yeah, as you said. So, you are saying people are smart, huh? But that is, I will tell you what, that is surprising result for me. I didn't expect this one. Really? I didn't expect. Because people, like, I read all the comments on social media, only Matushenko, Morozov,
SPEAKER_03: And Latin has a chance. Very little people mention your name. Very little. So whenever we talk... Maybe I don't pull it many times and maybe... I understand, but why now? Why now? Still you didn't pull? Whenever I was chatting on the social media now, did you pull in the last three days and we didn't see or something? I didn't see. When you put my name, it's very powerful, my friend. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Do you know what, okay, 1.4, this is how you want me to call your name, right? Engin, do you know what weight Reno and Basho will be? Is there a weight gap? I heard it is, I think, under 115 kg category. I don't think Reno is 105 kg. Anyways, about...
SPEAKER_03: okay i will and give me need you to post reno versus ivan say that after the podcast i will i will set one more uh match yeah sorry okay that that that was interesting that people 60 percent thinks that you are gonna win um i think i have set the match but listen
SPEAKER_03: If you change your mind, if you don't want to lose a light heavyweight guy, no, he's 105 kilo. When you put, I mean, he will continue pulling 105 kilos. So I don't know what we'll be anyway. So.
SPEAKER_03: We will see. Something is wrong with your connection, my friend. You are getting a little bit frozen. I don't know. To me, I don't know. Guys, who is this connection? Is Hermes frozen? Yeah, people are saying that you are frozen. I have more world titles than you have. I cannot be frozen. Now?
SPEAKER_03: You know how better? Better, okay. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Losing, he was 110 or 105. Five, 105 it was, yeah. Impossible to lose with one of... Who? A guy... Oh, you are not going to lose against him? Impossible. Impossible. So, are you planning to hold...
SPEAKER_03: yeah yeah and then say guy please go play with the guys in your weight category thank you it's too much for you thank you for my training pronation okay i i will show this alijan i will make sure that alijan will see this i will do some repetition rest win rest one minutes another repetition
SPEAKER_02: Okay, okay, okay. It's impossible to lose with one guy. 105-kilo guy, right? No way, no way, yeah? No, no. I thought it was 115 like this. No, no, no, no, no. And I thought it was impossible, but 105, impossible. Impossible. Yeah. Yeah, I understand, yeah. Okay, so...
SPEAKER_02: I will count 135, you see who will win. Who? What? I will count 135. Who, you? Yeah. You will be 135? I don't know. 130 minimum. Only for Aljan? With 105, my friend. It's like a dinosaur eat a dog. Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Engin said in matches, live is the best thing ever. My friend, if it wasn't midnight at Kazakhstan, I would even make a video chat with Ali Can, but I don't want to bother him. He's a married man. If he was single, I would for sure call him and wake him up.
SPEAKER_03: anyway so yeah i i like i like uh this like i i like sitting in the pot you know people want to see my pronation my bro just just go back a little bit this is because of the light hard to see no no no just make sure the light comes there now make your arm a little bit back like this here's good position okay now we will see the light look
SPEAKER_03: Go back a little bit. Oh, yeah. Yeah. So this is left arm, right? Left, right is more. Right is bigger, right? Yeah. Yeah. Elias is not very good. Okay, we'll see, we'll see. Yeah. Okay, one second. Ali Jan Sende takes message. He said... He said that he needs a microscope to see the pronator. See on April 20th.
SPEAKER_02: It's not important to see. It's important to see if he's powerful. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I talked with Jerry. Jerry told me that he's ready.
SPEAKER_03: There is one, okay, I better not say, because there is a match that I will set for April. But I'm not going to, no, not Jerry, not Jerry. I cannot announce the matches right now. I will wait till the... When he will pull? He will pull Jerry or not? Jerry will probably pull in July. July is another East versus West? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: I thought it was in August. Just wait, we will announce everything. Once everything is finalised, we will announce. But there is a match in April, most likely Jerry is going to be the winner of those in July.
SPEAKER_03: But don't be guessing. I'm not going to say which match. Even if you say correctly, I will act like, oh, it's not true. So don't be spending your energy. Okay, let's go. Matt Mask versus Derek Smith, King of the Table. I think Matt Mask is a lot better this year.
SPEAKER_02: Because he said he had a problem with his elbow. He told me like this. Now he told me he's completely healthy. For the power here, Derek is stronger, I think.
SPEAKER_02: But the thing will be who is the strongest? Up and when they pull. If Matt Mask takes a little bit the risk of Derek, he will win 100 per cent. I think same deal, 50-50 really. 50-50. If Derek is too strong, he will win very easy.
SPEAKER_02: If there are two options, or there is too strong, or little favourite Matt takes his risk, they can win. But Matt is completely dominant for this match. There is very big, very powerful. Anyways, yeah. Okay, okay. And Lachlan versus David Arabuli.
SPEAKER_02: guys please don't spend the same comments you know please i think i don't see i forgot the name george and guy david araboli
SPEAKER_03: David Poole many times retried. He beat Chen Zhou at East vs West and left-handed he lost to Matushenko, but Matushenko beats everyone quickly. He beat Kamil quickly, he beat Matarabu quickly. I think Chen Zhou, Lachlan, Schubert,
SPEAKER_02: this period he's trained a lot a lot really i think he's in super shape i think his little favorite luck line for this fight yeah yeah okay anyway so did you see rob carsten dyke robbie robbie carsten dyke
SPEAKER_03: He beat Frode in the Vegas event. You know Frode Haglund from Norway?
SPEAKER_03: Ah, okay. You know, the guy that always smiley face, you know, very strong. Yeah, he's a very strong guy, very strong guy, yeah. Yeah? Yeah. And Robbie Carstendijk beat him in Vegas at Armours. He pulled with the King of the Table with... Ray, he's gonna pull with Ray, yeah. And the guy has incredible, incredible...
SPEAKER_03: power press to do. And the guy is like a power lifting guy, you know? Yeah, he trained me in Istanbul, the gym. He lifted like Ray. Ray, oh, okay, okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's strong, right, Ray?
SPEAKER_02: Unbelievable. You would never think that he's that strong, right? No, I saw him one time in Dubai when he trained with Larry Weiss and already he's so very powerful. Yeah, but you know he's like a smiley, nice guy. You wouldn't think that monster is powerful. I put Ray. Only because he's my friend. Only because of your friend. Normally you think he's going to lose. Okay.
SPEAKER_02: No, no. It's very dangerous, Ray, when he has the strap and he can hook, when he goes in the hook. It's very dangerous. Oh, hi. Voice of Armrest, he wrote, my friend, he said, my friend. Italo Disco. He likes Italian music. Yeah. Did you think that...
SPEAKER_03: Ray told me that you told him that he was going to crash me at Dubai. Is it true? Huh? Is it true? What? Ray told me that before I pulled with Ray in Dubai, you said that he will crash me. Is it true? Maybe. No, no, honestly, who did you think that was going to win? I or Ray? No, really, I thought you won this fight.
SPEAKER_02: because your hand, I fed many times here, super solid, and I thought you can open. But one day he stopped you with the strap, the end,
SPEAKER_02: It was a dangerous moment. So you are saying that he's young. Do you know who Robbie is? I have a lot of opponents, strong opponents. He's super. Do you know who Robbie is, Carson Dike? Yeah, I showed him some of the videos. No, no, but do you know who he is? Do you know the Whitesell? The owner of Whitesell? This is his son.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, no deal. Super, super nice guy. Very friendly guy. He was there when Dennis and Devon pulled as well. Very humble guy.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, Peter says, Engin, remember the name? Ankur, you will say my name when I be the champion of the East versus West, trust me. I respect you, my friend, for your dreams and everything, but we will see, yeah? Anyway, so...
SPEAKER_03: My friends, so let's close slowly. How long time it has been? Almost one hour. Wow. It feels like 20 minutes. Same as the East versus West. Two years, but it feels like five years. Yeah. Yeah. And do you want to add anything more? Anything you want to say? Oh, now I think also to the match with the Danish. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: We forgot the match. Whisperer versus Arden. Devon's son is going to pull Whisperer. Whisperer, I don't know. I showed him in the social media, but... I mean, for sure he is much more experienced than Arden, but Arden is the bigger guy. One is around 75 kilos, I think, and Arden is probably 90 kilos. But one is experienced while the other one is very young.
SPEAKER_02: But if you learn a lot with Debon, the set-up, you can do good things. I saw some tournaments, he continued to train, to pull a lot. If he continues like this, he will have a good career, for sure.
SPEAKER_02: bbc today with the time i understand um by the way you said that you you agree with the rankings right yeah yeah uh sometimes it's difficult to put like a danish yeah danish today yeah it was opinion yeah so yeah i don't understand the people every time now danish he lost one time with with the
SPEAKER_02: with Devon. But listen, it was not easy match. Devon had the control. Denis didn't have chance to win, but Devon to finish him was not easy. Yeah. And now the people think then, no, Denis is not like in the past. No, no, no. He is not good. But I think for sure when he will come with me, he will
SPEAKER_02: he will become stronger. He will become stronger, stronger. Yeah, every event he will be stronger, stronger, stronger, stronger, for sure. Yeah, and really, really, I feel favorite, really, but...
SPEAKER_03: I will tell you something. If somehow you go and your wrist goes like this, you may be in trouble. Really. His pronator is really strong. Trust me. Devon didn't start the match totally outside. He started with like here, like here, and then he was like this. But he had this press inside just to control his back pressure. If Devon would pull him open on top row like this, then that match would be very risky for Devon. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Really, it will be a very big fight, for sure, because we can be a lot stronger. Anyone who thinks that Devin doesn't have a chance against you?
SPEAKER_03: I mean, I'm not saying he will win. I'm not saying you will win either. But I don't think, yeah. But not like 80%, 20%. No, no, no, no, no. I tell you what, 55-45. 55-45 with what I know. If he comes in a different shape, then we will... Listen, I will tell you something. Every time we have matches with you watching, Paul, go check this. Most of those polls, I cannot say most, but half of those polls are wrong.
SPEAKER_03: People said Ongar Boev is going to beat Tata Sings. People said Todd is going to beat Dadikyan. Dadikyan won. People said John is going to beat Sasha and Krasimir, and they won. People said Daniel is going to beat Mindaugas. Mindaugas won. I tell you, like many of those polls didn't go as people thought. So what I just tried to say that we all learn something new every event. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: And one thing I'm sure, if I have control here, I never lose with someone when I have the control. Because I have a lot of power, back pressure, I can use the press. It's very difficult to win with me when I have the control. But I think it's a problem for me in the set-up, in the beginning.
SPEAKER_02: With this hand, really, he's crazy. His hand is really crazy. More with 11, then... 69%... No, sorry, 63% Tata Sings, 26% David Tadikian, 11% 50-50. It's a lot. Yeah, people thought that Tata was going to win. So, I mean, you never know, you know. Continue to win.
SPEAKER_02: The people think this is unbeatable like this. And when someone loses one match, they think, eh, not good. It's like, you know, the short-term media is... Yeah, so we all learn, we all learn. I'm sure you also made a mistake with the prediction. I also made a mistake with prediction. To assume that this match is going to be like only... With the dodging, I made that he can't.
SPEAKER_02: Look at John, 80%, Krasimir, 20%. Maybe John is only because he's a goat and the people. But this is another word, Tata Shinsen, 69-31. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, so I just tried to say that. Yeah, I put it that he can favour it. You know, you remember I said he has more back pressure, more power in the hand.
SPEAKER_03: I was really surprised when he won. Ali Can? Look at Brudnick. Brudnick is 73, Ali Can 18, and 50-50 is 9%. But the match was just so dominant by... Yeah, really. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: anyway yeah anyways my friend thank you very much for being my guest i wish you the best again you know if you are like if you think that again you know like i was on the youtube you know live and i didn't want to look like you know i'm
SPEAKER_03: scared of Ali Can. So I said, set me a match. But listen, hey, listen, between us, you know, please don't set this match. You know, if you feel that way, just write me from WhatsApp. And then I will just say that Ali Can didn't want it. No, no. No, no. People very hard, they put good vote. On the poll? Yeah. 60%, 40%.
SPEAKER_03: 30 he will come 105 10 impossible to lose do you think that if he comes 115 he is going to beat you no so in no way he is getting inside you you will be boom can i ask you something round or five this is not title matches you need to win three rounds
SPEAKER_02: easy my friend easy easy my friend easy right yeah so you will you will basically tell him yes you are very strong what is better for you don't accept this match now you are super champion
SPEAKER_03: You are very super. People love you because your left hand is super strong. You're talking about Ali Can, Ali Can, you're talking about, yeah. If you are with me, I will block the climb. Oh, okay, people will say that, okay, Ali Can. So you're going to basically tell him, Ali Can, we love you, you are very strong, but stay in your 105kg category, maybe 115kg, but this is just too much for you. No more.
SPEAKER_03: Very dangerous to pray with, my friend. Yeah. When Hermes and Engin finish, join VOA Live with Reno Massage. Okay, okay, guys, we are finishing. Sorry, I didn't know you had a live, Ramos. Just join.
SPEAKER_03: Watch the warm wrestling with Reno Masic. I will be watching as well. I will be watching as well. Thank you, Ermes. Thank you very much. Thank you. But just remember, if Alican beats you, people are going to come back and find these videos. Oh, my God. So better win, better win. Take care. Listen, you're going to pull this way or you're going to pull this way?
SPEAKER_03: Maybe more here. More there, OK. After, when I have time. Ah, OK. First the pronator and then the cupping and then finisher. And three matches, 3-0, you say? Some repetition with the rest. Good training and... And go home. Some cash. Some cash. And then go. We will see, we will see.
