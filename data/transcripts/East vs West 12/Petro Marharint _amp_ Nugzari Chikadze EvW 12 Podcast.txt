SPEAKER_02: uh thank you guys for for tuning in so we me being technical director i started live stream on west pharmacy channel uh never keep too many um tabs open it will mess everything up so the first part that we talked about we're gonna come back and put it on this one uh channel as well uh right now i want to ask
SPEAKER_04: Nugo is super confident. Is he always like this?
SPEAKER_01: yeah he's extremely confident yeah and uh guys like uh we had some like tough uh uh like times when we were uh um interviewing these guys like past 10 minutes or so it was on east versus west uh and it was not on east version it was on uh coach ray was always pharmacy channel which we will transfer it on this channel as well so we will skip that part here we will not repeat ourselves we will just move on with questions but
SPEAKER_01: Just to summarize, we asked both athletes how much confident they are against each other coming in this event, this match. And I would say, Ray, disagree with me if you wish, but I would say Nugo felt more like confident, self-confident, you know, just coming in this match. He was like, I'm going to, we are friends, we respect each other, but at table, I'm going to destroy you. That was kind of tough, right?
SPEAKER_02: I think everyone has that confidence, but most people just keep it to themselves. I'm very surprised that I finally see someone who just lets it out. Let him know this. I think it's good. I think it's confidence. That's awesome. I see a bright future. I'll ask Petro the same thing. Petro,
SPEAKER_02: Many people are very confident in themselves. All athletes are always confident in themselves, but almost everyone keeps it to themselves. We don't hear and don't see many times someone who says, I'm the king of the table, I'll win. Do you keep everything to yourself or do you also feel that you can be confident in yourself?
SPEAKER_03: He said that, um,
SPEAKER_02: he's also always confident in himself but uh you never know what's going to happen on table so it's better to keep some things uh inside of you right uh but yeah I think every every every athlete most of the time are very calm even if they say they're not confident they're confident in themselves right uh yeah I would briefly translate for Nugo uh and also there is one question about Nugo's age so I would also get the answer on that one too
SPEAKER_01: Well, this is the introduction of Vissahubretikha Utsepi, as you know what Vissahubretikha is. It is a very good book, which I like very much. And Petro Markharin says that you are a very talented person, as you say.
SPEAKER_01: It's not that the government is very strict, or that Zafratos is not going to make a decision. I'm not going to make a decision. I'm not going to make a decision. I'm not going to make a decision. I'm not going to make a decision. I'm not going to make a decision. I'm not going to make a decision. I'm not going to make a decision.
SPEAKER_01: Nugo will turn 26 in July this year.
SPEAKER_01: so that's the answer guys if you want to ask questions
SPEAKER_02: And he's asking the age of his opponent, Petro. What's his age? How old are you, Petro? I'm 35. 35? Yeah. How old are you? Chikadze is 26. Chikadze will turn 26. Actually, he's 25. Roman, Roman.
SPEAKER_02: this is more like a joke you noticed he said that uh petro maybe it's uh considering your age maybe it's about time to retire on 20. um
SPEAKER_02: He said, you better tell this to John Brzenk. Have they met each other on the table?
SPEAKER_04: Can you tell us, Richard, if you can, if you can't, if you can't, if you can't, if you can't, if you can't, if you can't, if you can't, if you can't, if you can't, if you can't, if you can't, if you can't, if you can't, if you can't, if you can't, if you can't, if you can't, if you can't, if you can't, if you can't, if you can't,
SPEAKER_01: So unfortunately, they have no record of pulling each other. Nugo said that when Nugo finally was able to participate at Europeans that year, Petro did not compete. So Petro has been competing. But like in 2023, when Nugo finally entered the stage, then Petro was not there. So he avoided. So we can make this match.
SPEAKER_02: yeah perhaps maybe um uh i'll ask petro what is his favorite arm wrestling specific exercise um um
SPEAKER_01: He said, training fingers, grip and pronation. I would like to ask you, Petros, what is your most important method of pronation and how do you do it?
SPEAKER_01: Nugo is on fire today. He's saying that there will be no need for you to pronate and exercise pronation, but just stick with your wrist flex. Nugo said that you won't need your pronation. Work on your wrist. We'll see.
SPEAKER_02: We will see. I feel like Nuga is slowly, slowly poking the bear. The bear will wake up. We'll see. We'll see. It's exciting. It's exciting, you know. Yeah. Let's talk about the card. Let's talk about it. Let's go. We will talk about the matches and your opinion on who will win and who is the favorite, right? On Istvars Vest 12.
SPEAKER_03: Brandon Elsasor vs Stoyan Golimanov. Do you know Brandon? Yes. I don't even know, I can't even guess in this armfight who will win. I follow them, but I don't see them much.
SPEAKER_02: Those athletes that I see the most, I can say more about them. That's right. If there's not enough information, we can't talk, right? Yes. So he said, I know these athletes, but I haven't seen a lot of them. So for me, it's hard to pick a winner or give my thoughts on this match. So ask Nugo, Stojan or Brandon.
SPEAKER_01: Nugo, let's move on to the second question. What do you think about the relationship between El Cesar and Stoyan? Do you know a portal that you don't know about?
SPEAKER_04: I don't think so.
SPEAKER_01: Nugo told me that he's not aware of the athletes. So I told him that, okay, right away, you can just tell me that you're not aware of so that we will win in time and spare some time to move on to the next match. Okay. Let's start with Nugo. Okay.
SPEAKER_04: From my point of view, I would say that Betkili is a great sport because the players don't get tired of playing with Betkili. The players play with Betkili and when they play with Betkili, they don't get tired of playing with Betkili.
SPEAKER_01: so um lugo said that uh throughout the um these uh uh experience of uh uh monitoring both athletes he knows both uh very well he says that like uh actives simply cannot
SPEAKER_01: uh success in armwrestling match against uh oniani active's most like vicious power in this case is like the best uh chances like his uh explosiveness at the start on go however even even with that akhtar will actually uh most likely hurt himself against betkili because he said that uh after his uh um bad matchup and onion will take the win
SPEAKER_03: Petro, what do you think, Betkel, Ioni, Ani or Talgat Aktaev? Do you know these athletes? Talgat Aktaev? I think Talgat. Talgat? Yes, I think I would bet on him. You can't be sure. It's very hard to say. Petro says it's hard, but he's putting his money on Talgat.
SPEAKER_02: It's hard to say. It depends a lot on the start, I think.
SPEAKER_02: I would put Sandrys. He will be faster. He said it most likely will come down from the start, who will be faster, but he would pick Sandrys as a winner.
SPEAKER_04: I think that in the past, there was a lot of talk about the possibility of a war, but in the past, there was a lot of talk about the possibility of a war.
SPEAKER_01: He said that despite the fact that against several even lighter weight opponents than Sagop himself has been during the match and he has lost his wrist a bit
SPEAKER_01: Despite that fact, Sago maintained to come victorious and the key was to engage his shoulder. That's what he said. So like as long as Sago, basically it's almost roughly the same what Petro just said. So during the start, as long as Sago gets engaged and Nugo believes that he will, will come victorious. So he slightly favors Sago as well in this match. Okay.
SPEAKER_04: So for the next one, Tobias Shporong Kamil Jablonski. Let's start with Nugo. Nugo, Tobias and Kamil, what do you think is the most important thing in your life? I think it's the most important thing. Because I think that I am a rapist and I have a lot of experience.
SPEAKER_01: What do you think, Camille or Tobias on the left hand? Tobias Sporong?
SPEAKER_03: I think Tobias. Tobias is very strong on the left hand. I follow his Instagram, I saw how he fought. I remember this match with Zhenya Prudnik, but he was stronger on the head than Zhenya. Zhenya is very strong on the left, well, now. Therefore, Tobias probably needs to fight, I don't even know, with Gasparini. Well, let's see, let's see.
SPEAKER_02: He said that he believes it's Tobias Sporong, 100%. He's following him on Instagram. He's seen his previous matches, his match versus Prudnik. He believes and he knows Prudnik is extremely strong with his left. He believes that Tobias and he said Tobias needs to fight with Morozov or the guys that are at the very top. Schoolboy Leonidas Arcona.
SPEAKER_03: Petro, do you know anything about Leonidas? Not much. I follow Skolboy, he trains well, he gets a guy, I think he will win.
SPEAKER_02: He said he doesn't know much about Leonidas. He follows Skullboy. He sees Skullboy's training. He's training very good, very hard and getting better and better. And he believes he's also technically much better. And he believes he will win. What do you think about Leonidas Arcona and Aleksandr Baziazikov in Skullboy? Do you think it's a good match or not?
SPEAKER_04: I don't know. I don't know much about sports. I know a lot about schoolboys and I know a lot about them, but I don't know anything about other sports.
SPEAKER_01: so uh like petro he also is only aware of school boy a tiny bit but he is not aware of leonidas so yeah he cannot give the prediction but at least it's good that people like petro people like nugo people like uh
SPEAKER_01: who don't know and are not aware of Leonidas' armwrestling career, armwrestling skills. It's great to see him debut at East vs West and who knows, maybe he is a hidden talent. Yeah, we have seen just very little of Leonidas and mostly he's been competing in the German scene.
SPEAKER_02: for some years but uh one big match versus was uh with both arms was versus Larry wheels yeah uh and as as I think Larry is becoming good but he's not not a high level arm wrestler right um yet yet and school boy on the other hand it has been proven himself time and time after again it's very good arm wrestler and very strong and young technical and very very driven um
SPEAKER_03: This is a very interesting question. Tsvetkov has a very strong top, but he can't always use it. Kurdecha is also under the top.
SPEAKER_03: Well, it seems to me that they will fight more in the tie, and Kurdesha will probably win.
SPEAKER_02: He said that Svetko's top roll is very good. His, his hand is like ability to go over the top is very good, but he sometimes cannot use it or doesn't use it or get stuck. He believes the match will definitely be in the straps and he believes that Alex will win. It's a tough match for both of them. And Lugoš Jaraš Píklov, Alex is the next to Ceoze.
SPEAKER_04: I am a two-year-old sportsman, and I am a two-year-old athlete. I believe that strength is not the only thing that is important to me. I believe that I will be able to overcome many difficulties.
SPEAKER_01: So both athletes are very strong, crazy wrestlers. So he said that Tvetko would emerge victorious because of his
SPEAKER_01: better shoulder engagement skills than Alex does. So like Sagov, he also says that with the shoulder engagement, possibly Cvetko will come victorious against Alex.
SPEAKER_01: okay with shoulder engagement yeah it's very cool okay I want to see that yeah you know what I mean you know yeah we will see I mean you uh who was I think it was you actually who kind of uh
SPEAKER_01: you know uh slid it in to say that he will kind of get lost and then you know just press well was it you like who said that uh no maybe uh it was uh someone else also heard i i want to see that because i haven't seen it like somebody was like teasing that's right that you would just go flop on angie's podcast it was maybe he didn't yeah sounds like him um
SPEAKER_03: Petro, girls up to 70 kg with the left hand. Yes, I saw. I don't even know. I haven't seen them fight for a long time, especially Nikisheva. But I think Nikisheva will win. She has been fighting for a long time.
SPEAKER_02: And I think the experience will win. He said that he hasn't seen them going at each other for quite some time, but he believes that Nikesheva will win. She has the experience and been armwrestling for quite some time. So, Nugo, what do you think about Ekaterina and Fiat's fight? And if you could say something to the camera, what would you say?
SPEAKER_01: There was the comment, you know. Yeah. Okay. What do you think? I mean, I asked him in Georgian. I'm waiting for his response.
SPEAKER_04: From the beginning to the present, there is a lot of work to be done. I know that Goguari is a very strong man. I know that he works hard in his work and I think that he will be able to do it.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, since 2017, he is aware of Niki Sheva's armwrestling career. He has been following and... Sorry, like most armwrestlers. Yeah, exactly. But I mean, Ilugo is only 25, you know. And he said that he thinks Ekaterina is a bit of a favorite and she will be. Yeah. Okay.
SPEAKER_03: My name is Tarasaitis Artur Makarov. Petro. I think Tarasaitis, because in the last fight he fought Prokopchuk, he did well, he was good. Daniel was much stronger, I saw it in physics, but there he showed professionalism. I think Makarov is not stronger than Daniel.
SPEAKER_02: He said Mindaugas, most likely, the match that he showed last time was absolutely amazing. He showed great technique, great endurance. It was a tough match. Physically, they were both pretty close. And Petro doesn't believe that Artur's hand will be much stronger than Daniel's. Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_04: So, Nugo, what do you think about Makarovi's and Mindagus' relationship? Well, it's a very, very good question. It's a very important question for a sportsman. As I said, he was the first sportsman, he was the first to come to Makarovi.
SPEAKER_04: It was in mid-August, wasn't it? Yes, it was in mid-August. I think it will be released in this year. Titanic was released in the year of Prokocs.
SPEAKER_01: uh good old rival rivals uh by their um matches that they these two athletes has been uh pulling each other he said that there's one victory i think the last victor that's what he said uh from indaga's side against uh
SPEAKER_01: uh macaro and he says that uh he thinks he can repeat that he can uh beat macaro in this case and also he remarked how well mindaugus performed against daniel so he thinks uh minda will take this i think if you want to show anyone what is arm wrestling you show that match right yeah man that's the right because at start they'll be like what is this what is this you're showing me and then boom right
SPEAKER_01: from such a confident from daniel then it switched to the completely opposite side i i love you saw how much i love that match yeah i was there and you were saying you were like i even recorded you there it was amazing match um sasha andrea iraq let's start with nugo look at his smirk right there what what's this question
SPEAKER_04: He has the message for Sasho, just bring that belt, leave, and then leave.
SPEAKER_04: The first year was the first year of Zirakashvili Zona that I attended. It was the first Zona, it was the second Zona, it was the third Zona, it was the fourth Zona, it was the fifth Zona, it was the fifth Zona, it was the sixth Zona, it was the seventh Zona, it was the eighth Zona, it was the seventh Zona, it was the eighth Zona, it was the eighth Zona, it was the seventh Zona, it was the eighth Zona, it was the eighth Zona, it was the eighth Zona, it was the eighth Zona, it was the eighth Zona, it was the eighth Zona, it was the eighth Zona, it was the eighth Zona, it was the eighth Zona, it was the eighth Zona, it was the eighth Zona, it was the eighth Zona, it was the eighth Zona, it was the eighth Zona, it was the eighth Zona, it was the eighth Zona, it
SPEAKER_01: so he explained why he thinks iraqi will take this uh win against sasho he said back in uh 2021 when they had first time their match uh that was actually roughly his first ever super match style match and he was very inexperienced on that regards he said that also he was younger he was less experienced and his arm wrestling condition was not at this much level that he is right now
SPEAKER_01: so Nugo thinks that those crucial points like not necessarily mistakes but those crucial reasons and things that led Irakli to lose that match first time will have no place in this time because
SPEAKER_01: He is more experienced. He knows how to approach super match style and he's way stronger right now than back in that time. So he's quite confident that the Iraqis will take win. And yeah, just Sasho must bring the belt and leave and then leave. Okay. Petro, what do you think? Sasho versus Irakli? I think it's a good match.
SPEAKER_03: I think that Irakli won't let Sash turn on his strong side. He will use his lower fingers and twist him. We will see. It will be very interesting. Two different techniques. Very interesting. I think Irakli will open him, Sash.
SPEAKER_02: Pedro said that he believes Irakli will engage his low hand top roll by not allowing Sasho to get to any of his positions and staying away. But he said, like, this is a great match. I can't wait to see because two different techniques going ahead. It's in two of the best athletes on this class. So, yeah, but he's going with Irakli. He's going with Irakli. We are down to last four matches.
SPEAKER_03: Petro, Frank Lamparelli or Michael Todd? I don't know anything about Frank Lamparelli. Michael Todd, of course. I think Michael Todd. I see that he's getting better. His form is good now. I would bet on Todd.
SPEAKER_02: He said he doesn't know much about Frank Lamparelli, but he knows Michael Todd very well, as all of us. And he's looking at Michael's training. He believes Michael is in a very good, good shape and most likely he's going to win. What do you think about Todi and Lamparelli? Lamparelli is a very good athlete. But I think that Todi and Lamparelli are not as good as Magida.
SPEAKER_04: you can see that it's not easy to do something like that.
SPEAKER_01: uh frank is a very very good arm wrestler a decent decent one uh however uh this match versus uh mmt um will be tough for frank that's what google believes because uh as nugo said michael can like and really literally wrestles at the table once you stop then he is just trying finding the ways how to actually
SPEAKER_01: beat you so it will be the factor to guess lamparelli out and that would be the main reason why he would lose against michael okay um i just asked him tell us why samushia would be yeah
SPEAKER_04: I would like to say that Samush is a legendary sportsman. He is a great sportsman. I would also like to say that Aydar Khan was born in a different form from the previous one.
SPEAKER_04: He said that
SPEAKER_01: Samusha is a legendary athlete for him, especially personally for Hugo. He's like a real legend. And because of his well estimations on how good potentially
SPEAKER_01: Nudalet would perform against Samushia. Based on that, Nugo believes that Samushia will prepare well and he would not underestimate his opponent. Basically, that was his point. Even though Nudalet really, really well performed against Vala, we all saw his last match. That's what Nugo said. Despite that fact, Samushia will be really well preparing for this opponent.
SPEAKER_01: still take the win and he carry on this legendary uh you know status that he is keep claiming in this uh understand korea petro what do you think david samushia or nur dauleta you know these athletes yes i know well i think samusha will win here it's hard to analyze here but still i think samusha
SPEAKER_02: He said it's hard to analyze this match, but he believes Samusha will win. Then I asked him, do you think it will be mostly because of endurance? And he said, most likely because of endurance.
SPEAKER_01: Sorry, Nubo just asked, also was willing to know what Petro's opinion is on this match and I will translate it.
SPEAKER_01: keep teasing him he said the first time uh i heard uh correct uh predictions on the uh georgian matches that's what he's saying it's like poking him a little bit first time he agrees on his prediction yeah well he also said iraqli will win yeah but i mean he just wanted to tease him you know yeah okay okay yeah okay okay um we have alejan muratov
SPEAKER_03: against Hermes Gasparini. Petro. Very interesting. I'm looking forward to it, if I'm honest, to see it. Well, I would, of course, think that it's still Shalyzhan. Shalyzhan, after all, since he took Prudnik, he can, of course, win Gasparini. But, again, if you judge... Hermes will be 20 kg heavier.
SPEAKER_03: I just saw how Olezhan won against Zhenya Prudnik. It's just a machine. If, of course, Ernest doesn't beat him up, if he doesn't reveal Olezhan at least a little, then I think Olezhan will pull Ernest in the hooks.
SPEAKER_02: He said that most likely Aljan. I asked him if the weight difference will matter because Hermes will be 20 kilos bigger. He said, I saw how he beat Prudnik. And I know Prudnik is very strong. So I have seen him beat the heavyweights before. Of course, there's a chance that Hermes might take his wrist, but that might not be enough. Yeah. So he's going with Aljan. Hugo, should I ask Gautry?
SPEAKER_01: between Alijan and Hermes. It is clear that Hermes is not in the top 15, but it is a super heavyweight, it is a super heavyweight. Hermes is 20 kilos heavier than Alijan. What do you think? It is clear that there is no doubt that Hermes will win and defeat Alijan.
SPEAKER_04: Nice. So, this time Nugo is
SPEAKER_01: going towards to the very unpopular opinion, so to say. And he would say that Ermes will surprise everybody else, actually, basically. The majority who thinks that Alijan would beat him and win, he believes that's not going to be a correct prediction. He thinks Ermes will take this and many people will become stunned and surprised. Okay, okay.
SPEAKER_01: In the main event, we'll start with Nugo. Does Devon have any chance beating Levon? Okay, I'll go with Nugo, yeah. Nugo, you've played with Devon and Levon. How do you feel about it? What do you think about Devon's performance? Well, it's my first time playing with Devon.
SPEAKER_01: So I will speak in first person on his behalf. He said, judging by my very polite experience that I have grasped throughout several years in a short past time, I would give a very humble advice to Devon.
SPEAKER_01: you are Devon you are really good uh arm wrestler right so just make sure that don't break your arm please because you are in such an age that it will not get fixed anymore so please just don't injure yourself so that's the advice to them uh uh
SPEAKER_03: Well, I see that Devon is very close to Levon. Levon will be a competitor, it will not be the same as last time. But again, after the armfight with Gasparini, Levon was not in very good shape. And I think that now he will be in much better shape than he was before.
SPEAKER_02: So he said that he believes Devon that we're seeing right now is very close to Levan and can give a good competition to Levan.
SPEAKER_02: But Levan, most likely after the match versus Hermes Gasparini, understood that he also made mistakes. So he will prepare much better for that than he did for the match versus Hermes. So he believes the chances of them, because of that, are going way down. Even though it will be a different and tougher match, but still he believes Levan will show up probably better than before.
SPEAKER_01: Did we miss any questions or something? I'll keep following the chat. We asked several already. I wanted to actually personally ask him, ask both of them their weights, like yesterday we did on Samushian.
SPEAKER_01: He's currently he's like 180 108 and 8.5. But he will have no problem of dropping weight because it's 105. So yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Petro Ramde is not from Estonia. Petro, how much do you weigh now? Nugo, we asked him, is 108 kg. He will drop the last three. How do you weigh? I am now 107 kg. 107 kg, and I will add a little more to drive less.
SPEAKER_02: he said uh already 107 and he's going to get it a little lower so he doesn't have to cut that anything or something
SPEAKER_01: yeah you will get sweaty enough at the uh april 20th so make sure that don't catch cold beforehand he said uh
SPEAKER_02: He said that if you don't do too much cardio, you will be very... How to say it? You will be whistling under the table. You don't need to do it there, you will do it under the table. Behind the table. I don't do too much cardio. Who am I going to do cardio with? Ugo?
SPEAKER_02: Yes, yes. He will cut Nugel. He will cut Nugel. I'll ask, maybe something they want to say to each other. Petro, maybe you want to say something? We will finish for our opponent. What can I say? I like his self-confidence. He is so persistent.
SPEAKER_02: he said he likes nugo's confidence he's very um precise in what he's saying he says what he thinks and but of course the table will tell
SPEAKER_01: Nugo, let's move on to the final. I would like to ask you something analogous to what you said, and I would like to ask you how you feel about the show and how you feel about the elements of the show. And I would like to ask you about your thoughts.
SPEAKER_04: Well, it's a very good morning. As a sportsman and my competitor, I am very happy to be here. I am very happy to be here. I am very happy to be here. I am very happy to be here.
SPEAKER_04: But I think it's a very good idea. I think it's a very good idea. I think it's a very good idea. I think it's a very good idea. I think it's a very good idea.
SPEAKER_01: So he's thankful for the honest and good wishes once again. Yeah, it's been a good chat. He said that he knows why Petro was kind of off during his career, like lately, why he took some time, you know, why he was not that much active. He knows the precise reason.
SPEAKER_01: uh he knows that uh he will uh be a better and well prepared against him on april 20th he said um he would uh he also wished success as well yeah and lastly he said
SPEAKER_01: uh don't forget i'm the king of the table at the arm wrestling right and uh i will uh make sure i'm telling you here right here right now for everybody else to know uh i will make sure that you will uh tell everybody else that your toughest match in your career was april 20th 2024.
SPEAKER_02: Nugel said that he knows that you will be in your best form on April 20th. He said good luck to you. But he also said that he is the king of the table. And he wants you to tell everyone that the most difficult match in your life was April 20th, 2024.
SPEAKER_03: Well, I also wish Nuga good luck. Well, I don't think I'll say that, because I'm only going to win. Of course, I'm not as confident as Nuga, but I'm going for the win.
SPEAKER_01: He said, thank you. I wish him good luck too. I don't think it's going to be the toughest one. I'm going there to win. Of course, I'm not as confident in myself as Nugo, but I'm going for victory. Yeah, I'll translate him. Nugo, I'd like to ask you something. I'd like to ask you something analogous, but I don't think you have a chance to win. Because you're so good, you're so good.
SPEAKER_04: It's not that I'm not as good as you are, it's just that I don't know what to do. If you don't know what to do, I don't know what to do, I don't know what to do, I don't know what to do, I don't know what to do.
SPEAKER_01: okay then he has this uh new proposal like he adapts what he just uh here what petro just told him so okay if you don't if you are sure or if you know that you will not be saying that april 20th will be your toughest match
SPEAKER_01: then okay i will make sure i will promise you that uh i will do everything uh uh very like uh blitz in a second without any pain i will just finish it as quick as possible so it will not be that tough you know just be boom no god
SPEAKER_03: that it will be the most difficult match of my life. I just don't even guess what it will be yet, because there is very little information about Nugov, and we'll see, we'll see.
SPEAKER_02: He said that right now, it's not that I'm thinking that it's not going to be the toughest match of my life right now. I can't even think about it. And there's, because I don't know, there's not enough information about Nugo around. So we will see on April 20th.
SPEAKER_01: I don't want to say that I don't have a second choice. I have a choice for everyone, as you said. And I hope that in April everything will be solved. Yes, I agree. There will be a lot of changes. I hope that everything will be fine. There will be changes in everything.
SPEAKER_01: okay then he's saying thank you thank you guys for inviting me thank you very much thank you everybody else in chats and who are watching us and yeah can't wait see you soon and basically he says that until uh April until Istanbul okay uh guys we're gonna end this one uh tomorrow evening we have so join us there I'm gonna post it and you will see um yeah
SPEAKER_02: Thank you, Roman. Thank you, Nugo. Thank you, Margaret. See you in two weeks in Turkey. Thank you.
