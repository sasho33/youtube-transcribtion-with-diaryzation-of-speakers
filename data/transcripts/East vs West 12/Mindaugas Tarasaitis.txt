SPEAKER_01: Yeah, he's coming. Victor, would you consider doing a GoFundMe page in which the money donated goes to the prize money? Yeah, it's possible.
SPEAKER_01: Gaming, X, Engin, do you think Ivan would be able to handle exposing Ali Can even after putting him in the centre of the defence position? I don't know. I think Arsene is around 112kg. Ivan says that he needs a little bit more time for Ali Can. Ali Can is really a very dangerous guy. The guy is just like, you know, you sometimes say something, you know, like a real deal, you know.
SPEAKER_01: that that is the definition of the real deal you know you just go to google and write real deal what does real deal mean and then click enter and it says alijan murado you know so that that is how real deal he is you know yeah yes 1.4 alijan is very special that that person is to me he looks like like those uh science fiction
SPEAKER_01: looks, everything. Thank you, Liam. Thank you. Igor, what's next for Kurdesha? We are planning something. We are. Abbas Rana from India. No, I don't know, my friend. Yeah, Alijan is... Predictions, I just shared yesterday, but I will share again, you know. But just, I was talking about Alijan, just, I mean, the way the guy is just...
SPEAKER_01: I mean, this guy, I mean, I know I shared the photo, but still, you know, I would love to once again share.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, for sure the guy is not normal. Okay, Mindagos came. The master. Master of the universe. Hello, Mindagos. Oh, hello. Good to see you. Good to see you as well. The master. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just give me a moment. I'm still setting up a little bit. Okay, and then we can start chatting. Exactly.
SPEAKER_01: and then you can tell us about what you will do next what will be your next victim who will be well it partly depends on you i guess but yeah i was just before you came i was talking about alijan i was just saying that the guy really looks like like a science fiction you know like those those yeah like the guy just really
SPEAKER_01: I mean, those trapezes, those shoulders and forearm and everything, you know, the guy, I mean, like real deal, Terminator. What do you think about him? I mean, that was just scary, huh? Scary strong. Yeah, let me think. I still remember him from the old days. You don't remember? I remember him from the old days, you know. Oh, you remember. He did progress somehow, you know, little by little. Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_01: And then just recently, yeah, he's just exploding. Very good progress lately. Yeah, yeah. But he was also very dominant, you know, even when he was pulling Waff at 80 kilos. Right, yeah, always. Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: when we thought that you know like someone like bad killy would be like really like untouchable and he just he was just holding him and you know like the same like how it went with uh prudnik and last two years him winning the super heavyweights uh at wap it was incredible very exceptional hooking ability um really really quick to jump inside
SPEAKER_01: you don't always see people like many times during the match you think that the match stop and he can boom like a new start from ready go he comes in a boom again you know like he can he can hit you seven eight times not like in a row like he would allow the guy to lock himself and then he would still hit you so hard you know just i mean very very um plenty of explosiveness yeah like
SPEAKER_01: even if a match stops you can still kind of reset give you a little bit of space and then load himself again just boom yeah yeah yeah yeah especially when when when uh when someone like prudnik stop him it is like very very hard to break their luck you know just because the guy is here you know you know i thought the problem would be
SPEAKER_01: prudnik to you know stop him especially somewhere at the center once he is at the center i thought that it would be very long match yeah i was just thinking if prudnik stops him right here somewhere maybe he would just hit his and open it again but what he did he just he came here and they come back and then when he hit again you even open him even easier you know yeah so he almost made prudnik uh
SPEAKER_01: relax by going back so much so he can gain some space and uh make a new hit yeah see whenever you are in the winning position that that you are just pressing down generate when you are here you can use you know your everything your belly everything in a side you know you can hit but from here to here it's less effective and here is the where somebody's bicep is at
SPEAKER_01: strongest point you know that that's why sometimes like most of the times the match stops somewhere here the guy is just having a hard time but to have here to here is easy or from here to down is kind of hard but of course that you know why am i telling you know just of course the master of armor thing listen what's the same same with todd hutchings and the dickian right yeah yeah i think todd was talking about like if these guys you know if they come back
SPEAKER_01: really have to quickly block them and um don't let them create a space you know otherwise they will load it up and yeah um you did incredible job like the match to me like whenever i saw the first round i was like oh no you know just like daniel is different level
SPEAKER_01: This is a mismatch, and I thought the match that was going to be the longest of the night will be the shortest of the night, you know. So, like, first two rounds went like that, and then the third round, like, you made a set, and from here, you put the little finger, good pressure, and then it seemed like, you know, that still had some wrist, but it suddenly... boom, you know, and then we saw your mastery, you know, like...
SPEAKER_00: you know you and that's the hardest part by the way normally for a top roller it's really really difficult to do that normally that's where people get tired quickly and Daniel can just finish him after a bit of time but also even the first two rounds um
SPEAKER_00: You know, maybe I made it look like Daniel was very dominant, but it's also, it's just because I, I made, maybe, maybe I made a mistake. You know, I attacked in the wrong way. Daniel quickly got on top of me. Uh, so it would be stupid for me to fight in a position which is uncomfortable. And I felt like it's okay. No, it's not. That was not it. That's not where I wanted to end up. I just kind of gave it away, gave it away.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but do you think, I mean, you were very patient. You were very patient. You didn't make any mistake. You just waited and you went like millimeter by millimeter, millimeter by millimeter. Yeah, but that's how you, you know, you must fight like this against Daniel because if I'm any more offensive than I was, suddenly that's a mistake and then I get tired and I lose the match and
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, the only way. Sometimes people, I'm talking about some of the people, they don't know how to sing as we do. And they're making that it's all about the pressure you need to do it. But whenever you do pressure, if something is stopping you, that is like those key points, those key locks. But once you break those key locks, and then if it didn't unlock those locks,
SPEAKER_01: you are applying like just a 50 kilo pressure and it's not opening. Once you unlock those critical points, even with 20 kilo pressure, the arm will open. So it is all about the unlock. And what you did, you first stop his hand, wrist, you know, so that he wouldn't, because once he's killing you, you know, he would kill all of us, you know, and not all of us, maybe not someone like David or Bojidar, they would have a good war. But also just a small comment.
SPEAKER_00: um you know i feel like i could also resist much longer even around one round two you know i can hold it even in that yeah yeah it would be that position it would be stupid yeah so maybe that's why it feels like maybe he beat me very easily around one round two but it if i was resisting maybe it would not be that easy but i just don't want to lose the round yeah but but if you would resist as much as you can
SPEAKER_01: most likely you couldn't be able to do what you did in round three and yeah no work no yeah yeah you would you would be exhausted you know so you kept yourself you know and it's not about winning the round it's about winning the match so yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and then and then once you were
SPEAKER_01: sliding your elbow like millimeter by millimeter just just like one second like just because i am doing this you are not getting into any kind of complex right so i'm just like not showing off
SPEAKER_01: just joking but listen i'm not scared of the size no worries okay daniel is here is incredible so what you are trying to do is just make sure that his hand is right here so then the pressure on your arm is getting lesser so you just did i saw that a little bit up
SPEAKER_01: little bit here a little bit up a little bit here and then you force your elbow just to make sure that your natural you know position is outside of his you know the the the shoulder pressure you know and it was incredible to watch that you were just like giving a live arm wrestling lesson you know it was just beautiful yeah to watch but the funny thing is that it's still a little bit hard to see what i was doing exactly because i am
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, you know, in armwrestling, it's not really that easy to understand what is going on by just seeing the match. I feel like it was really important for me to almost just kind of create this forward pressure a little bit. Yeah, yeah. But I realized one thing. You did not... Remember in Moldova, when you pulled him, you hit him like 30 times, but all were without control. The one that I just explained, unlocking those locks,
SPEAKER_01: You know, you were like, boom, boom, boom, boom. But the locks were there, you know, you were hitting the wall, you know. But once you take everything, everything, everything, then you see that the resistance is not as much as like when the things are holding each other. And you know, back then, I actually had no choice. Even while I was hitting, I knew that it was stupid. I knew that it wouldn't work at all.
SPEAKER_00: But I just really had no time to stop because if I stopped, I felt like my elbow was not ready for that kind of pressure back then. And I would immediately just have to lose if I stopped. So that was just the only thing I could do back then. And I pretty much knew it wouldn't work. But you are learning. You are learning. You are learning. This time, like, I mean, no disrespect to Daniel. We are talking about how we did great.
SPEAKER_01: the reason that we are right now praising you like how great you are it is because of the greatness of the dania exactly like if you would do this to someone like not that level they would like to do to beat someone like dania is also like shows you know like i mean i mean it is just all about the greatness of him you know like like daniel was the favorites in this match against you yeah
SPEAKER_00: yeah he was so just i i hope that daniel understand it like when we are talking how great you did it only means that how great daniel is you know yeah so i will now be happily watching daniel destroy everyone else because i know that he will um it's really like he he's in a great shape um yeah so we will see him dominate again i'm sure yeah yeah i mean this is just like i'm telling you like
SPEAKER_01: Like you all are extraordinary human beings. Like you are like, I mean, just like super, super guys. And like, there is no way two guys to meet each other and both win. You know, it's like one will lose, but it doesn't mean that the other guy is not that great. I mean, to me, just two super guys.
SPEAKER_01: lightweights you know just met each other and then one won and then um so this this must be i think a pretty good lesson for daniel because i feel like he could um do some things a lot better how i i i'm not sure if i should talk about it because but when you did this the third round you know do you think there was a way it looks like you know he was stuck you know there but there's always something which you can do okay
SPEAKER_00: okay okay we better not say it you don't want this to be used against you you may feel so relaxed now but later you may regret yeah i have a feeling that he didn't fully understand what he can do so maybe i will just leave it like that and see if he will make adjustments by himself or numb yeah
SPEAKER_00: is there anyone that like you want to avenge you know from the past that you know like dominated you badly that's a good question right because i feel like um you know i'm looking at these bigger names which i was um competing with let's say five six six years ago and i feel like i made i made quite a big progress since when so now it is quite interesting yeah so arthur what is your what is your score with
SPEAKER_00: Arthur, 4-1, 5-1? I only got him once. But even that, I cannot really consider that a win because it was just one round. And then in the finals, he came back again. So I cannot really consider that a win because at the end, yeah, he got me. So, okay, what is the score? I only got him one round. No, no, he's winning. He's winning against you.
SPEAKER_01: He's always winning. Always? What is that always? Four, five times total, the match? Two times in Antalya? Maybe three times. Okay. I think he also beat you somewhere else as well, like Europeans 2017. Maybe three times, yeah. Only three times? So you met him only in two different events? How can you not remember? I'm 49 years old. Yeah, you see, I just don't care about these things, like whatever happens. Okay, you don't care about your losses, okay.
SPEAKER_00: Just different kind of... About my events, I don't really care. Yeah, yeah. And Yanis, and you? You have the winning record? Very interesting, yeah. You have winning record or he has winning record? You don't remember. He has a winning record and he won against me the last time, let's say, over, you know. I saw like 2016 or 15 or something in an event, you beat him twice in Lithuania or somewhere.
SPEAKER_01: But then we had another competition again in Riga a bit later afterwards, and he beat me. Oh, okay. Okay. I didn't see that one. Yeah. So that match needs to happen as well. Yeah. So, yeah. Yes. Macaro, those two guys. Yeah. Yeah. There is one more guy they beat you 12 times. Maybe someday they will get one too. All right. And hopefully we also get him. But maybe also Emil and Mershadian, right?
SPEAKER_00: he oh yeah i think he beat you at the hungry waff i think he was second to to macaro there i'm sure he else i'm not sure about the right hand but i know that he beat me on the left for the world title on the left i think he got first i got second i think it was 2016 i think
SPEAKER_00: i don't know you know better 16 16 17 you did final with daniel he came from losing losing side and beat you twice here with left hand yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah also by the way also you know i would like to prove myself on the left as well how is how is the left left feeling right now it is actually pretty good i'm my
SPEAKER_00: You know, my team here in Copenhagen, they are not necessarily that confident. But me, myself, I'm pretty confident. I feel like I could maybe even beat Daniel. So, 13... Okay, one second. So, they are not confident about your left hand? Yeah, but, you know, I'm talking about, okay, maybe I can now go for left hand against Daniel. And they are saying, just, oh, wait, wait, wait a second. Don't rush it so much.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know why are we not confident about me, but... You beat all of them, left arm? There's one guy who I cannot beat, but he's a big guy. He's like 130 kilos. 130 kilos, okay. And the right arm, can you beat him? I can, yeah. Oh, wow. That's good, that's good. That's interesting, yeah. Yeah, yesterday I wrote to Arthur. I said, Arthur. Okay. Okay.
SPEAKER_01: I said, I said, and I put question mark. And he said, if you say, if you say Daniel, Daniel, this is what he said. Okay, good. Good. Yeah. And he said that, he said that, uh,
SPEAKER_01: can you not find someone stronger and i said and listen he never said that of course he and it's not true and also uh he's not that type of guy you know like he would never he never they would never do trash talk the guy is just like he's not like me like he wouldn't be
SPEAKER_01: yeah yeah i mean if you and i we would pull again if i lose weight i can imagine that the back and forth you know even last time we didn't have this east versus west or something uh we were really
SPEAKER_01: we had fun yeah we had yeah we had fun yeah yeah you were gonna hold me and then go like this and quit and you're like please don't foul you know intentionally you know it was fun yeah it was fun yeah but again be careful because what you experienced last time is very very different from today so maybe you should just retire
SPEAKER_01: Listen, the only thing is that, like, not really making me getting, like, provoked is because, like, I'm 92 kilos. So 17 kilos, I'm, like, 85. Yeah, it looks realistic. 17 kilos, I can still do it, but I really can't focus while I'm doing this East versus West. Trust me. It's not joking, but it really takes so much energy from me mentally as well. Like, I have those whiteboards hang, three of them on the wall, all those names for...
SPEAKER_01: this event and the next event you know expenses and you know like if you would say like a criminal investigator on the wall right like everything connected and yeah yeah yeah yeah it's it's fun yeah anyway so um so you you will be ready like anytime soon and what do you think your chances against um arthur good
SPEAKER_00: So I'm confident, very confident, but also I recognize the danger in his explosiveness. Yeah. But then I also think about his hand and his finger strength. The fingers are a bit short, sometimes quite easy to have a good setup with him. So even if he is very explosive, I feel like I can probably still catch him. And then after catching him, it should be.
SPEAKER_00: be pretty good yeah yeah yeah similar thing which i did against daniel i guess after stopping yeah what do you think about daniel versus uh arthur yeah so if it's hook against hook it's it's a bit harder to predict what's gonna happen um before we always saw our tour
SPEAKER_00: beating Daniel but then Daniel progressed so so much during the past couple years I would expect Daniel to give him a good match so I don't know it's interesting I would actually like to see Daniel against Arthur Makaro a lot that would be a fun match you expect a tough match I do I do you do yeah how do you think the match would go where the athletes would go
SPEAKER_01: i think it's a good issue must be hook right unless daniel somehow tries to be uh a top roller again as he did against samushin but arthur can also go outside he is he's uh oh he has a good good his left left his brachioradialis his pronator just really very strong very strong yeah
SPEAKER_01: And people also talk about, now you beat Shevkasov. And you beat Daniel. And people talk about Alain Zolev. How do you see your chances against him? Before, I was thinking that he would be kind of too much. But whenever I remember his match against Emil,
SPEAKER_01: And Emil took his wrist easily. But Emil had a problem to finish him. But Emil armless is like kind of like open arms. He's like this. He's not like so much like this, but he's like this. He's doing with forearm, you know, mostly. And then Alam was able to drag him with the bicep power like this. But when you take somebody's wrist, you have the joint lock. You know, you are not only muscle, but you're going to sideway.
SPEAKER_01: And I kind of think that there is a possibility to top roll him. And there is a possibility that once you top roll him, you beat him. But it doesn't mean that he cannot beat you or you have more chance or something. But I don't think that it would be an easy match.
SPEAKER_00: yeah so emil i feel like yeah he was in a pretty good position but he made statically emil is i feel like pretty far away from my static ability like i mean he's a bit more explosive doesn't like to sit in the static position positions as much and he also made a pretty big mistake where he did not follow alan as alan was trying to starting to drag you see how uh you know daniel he was also starting to drag during some moments
SPEAKER_00: And I was not necessarily too offensive during those dragging positions. I was just kind of following, staying in front, just waiting it out a little bit. I knew that I was not in danger of getting pinned. Yeah, I feel like I would do the same against... So you see, this is good, this is great. Of course, Emil's shoulder is a little bit...
SPEAKER_00: outside he should bring it bring it back because uh yeah for endurance do you think do you think that if you catch if you catch uh alan in such position you can finish him well after seeing what i did to daniel i feel like you should be able to recognize that i would also finish alan like if i get his wrist um he will not outlast me so um
SPEAKER_00: And by the way, Daniel and his ability to still pull, develop his wrist. And, you know, in this lock position, like Daniel, I feel like it's so, so, so much better than Alan. I can see Alan still, just stylistically, he's not used to those kind of battles. Yeah, this is in strap. Yeah. Yeah, but the difference is that I would say
SPEAKER_01: I agree from one side with you. I would say that Daniel is good by more like pressing type of deadlifts. While I think that Alan's arm may be stronger to this way, like pronation and then keeping like this angle. While Daniel is more about the joint pressure with the shoulder.
SPEAKER_01: and i think that this would be a different challenge for you not the same exact challenge one is really pressing to your uh elbow the one is just really at the end he beat him like like like dragging like this you understand he opened him i'm not saying like this thing normally doesn't work like it doesn't work like but that's how he beat him how he beat him yeah i know but so emil it was supposed to follow him and he didn't emil no because because his arm is just open open top roll he cannot really
SPEAKER_00: joint you know yeah he should still keep it close and a bit more close and he should stand up yeah look at him here a man should stand up he cannot um he should not stay low look at look look at how he's beating him from here see he came closer a little bit but now look at you see so during the drag emil yeah really follow it and uh yeah block it at the very end not necessarily try to push through yeah by the way you know you know what um
SPEAKER_00: daniel uh and um alan they both look very very similar to me you're saying that daniel is going a bit forward but actually you know if i was trying to hit sideways or try to pin then daniel is also really doing the same thing as alan a little bit kind of like
SPEAKER_01: no no yeah but but he he is not dragging you to open to bicep way like this he is more like pressing like this he tried that that that thing at the end you know it didn't work because you are already experienced about it especially when you pull against the restore yeah yeah but you see he tried it so if emil did it the same did like went to fight daniel and daniel does that thing maybe daniel will also open emil because emil will not follow it well enough
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, that's a very strong thing to do. I mean, we saw that. We saw Daniel versus Emil matches. You remember in Moldova, long, long matches? Yeah. Really, like, probably more than a minute, you know. Total is probably a few minutes long. You know, they had many starts and protests and restarts. I don't know if you remember or not. No, I remember everything. And Emil was very good back then. But I feel like now Daniel leveled up a bit more. Yeah. So you are saying that you, Daniel...
SPEAKER_00: You know, you guys have a good chance against Alan and Artur. I think so, yeah. But, of course, I can see the danger for Artur. He's very explosive, still might be difficult for me to catch. And for Alan, his hand and finger strength might also be maybe better than Daniel's. So maybe it's even more difficult to open him. Those are my thoughts, but...
SPEAKER_01: If I do open Alan's wrist, I'm pretty sure I will finish it. And if I catch, if I stop Makaro, I'm also pretty sure that I'll finish it. But it depends on the position that you stop. Do you remember when you beat him once, he went deep, deep inside and then from here you kind of rise and then you hit him here and
SPEAKER_01: Then he suddenly pulled his elbow back, but he was losing position. But you were here and he's straight in your wrist, like with that rowing. And then you said that also to me that I felt something very strong when he did that. You remember that? Yeah, I remember that. And remember that this guy since then doing this a lot, doing this outside pulling a lot. So do you think there is a chance that he may
SPEAKER_01: flatten your wrist and beat with the side pressure or even take your wrist because i will tell you something to me you are great against top roller you are great against hook pullers but in my opinion you are better against the hook puller like there are a few losers you have like once you have some problem it is from here you remember that the lithuanian guy that you you pull
SPEAKER_01: also yeah yeah yeah a few times i have seen you you losing your wrist but not really in a fresh match you know not so much the only guy that you know you for sure 100 have a wrist problem is the guy that is just talking with you other than that i don't know also uh yeah justin bishop for example i was struggling and uh yeah but it was not your category exactly but you see uh i can tell you one thing um since yeah after nordolet as i say a master arm wrestling
SPEAKER_00: i added something some special exercises to my program which really makes me very very connected so somehow the wrist now is perfectly connected to the arm i i feel like i have much more control um much quicker to um to start pulling so i am a bit more confident now also above my wrist i don't know what's what's happening with our
SPEAKER_01: people who are viewing it it goes down like 300 goes 150 now 348 i don't know i don't know it shouldn't be moving that quick you know but i don't know now a little bit yeah 348 it went down to 275. i don't know i don't understand how it's happening anyway so what you're saying sorry about it
SPEAKER_00: yeah so i was saying that yeah my wrist is now better and you see one more interesting thing i noticed um i am pulling for quite many years right on the internationally yeah so people can see my results and um i feel like i was maybe standing at some place for quite a while or maybe i just made very slow progress
SPEAKER_00: and uh it's difficult for people to understand that maybe now i i made even more progress recently let's say during the past two years or past year um so you have to evaluate also that thing that i'm not the same as oh i was always no i'm 100 sure you are also a young guy you know and you are
SPEAKER_01: more experience more like like everything is just getting better you know for sure but like how can you calculate that your wrist got much better after nur dalet like what kind of experience you had it you know against your hand i don't think that you had it like you pull with
SPEAKER_01: Hristo, I mean, not super, super top roller, but yeah, of course. Even on the practice table, I can still see it. Oh, you can see, okay. Yeah, okay, that's something you know, but we don't know yet. Yeah, you can't measure it. Daniel also, people were saying before the event, people saying, oh, Daniel has great top rollers, he made top rollers, and I was saying,
SPEAKER_01: no i mean it's not really done right no he wouldn't try yeah yeah yeah yeah it would be it would be easier for you because all you are worried is about daniel's elbow joint lock you know that the strong thing you know and the more he goes back more he's getting away from that and he is more vulnerable to this way closer he is coming more there is a problem is coming that he's putting the shoulder behind yeah yeah every second that he's uh
SPEAKER_01: trying to top roll just gives me more time to get into my position so yeah if he tried to top roll it would just be very good for me yeah yeah yeah yeah I agree I agree yeah I don't know I don't know um so yeah that that that is yeah interesting and do you do you plan like or I shouldn't say do you plan because
SPEAKER_01: kind of high plan the event but do you also like wish uh like 85 kilo matches or you are focused or maybe you want to just concrete you know your your title and then and then if you don't have you know like really really tough opponent in 75 at some point then you may try 85 kilo matches as well
SPEAKER_00: Yes, it's quite interesting. Whenever you are doing well, and let's say I'm winning against Daniel and some other good guys, even Jair Castro's victory was huge. Of course, I'm getting more confidence and suddenly I would maybe like to try even Samusha because you see Daniel had a good fight with him. If I can beat Daniel, you know, it's not that far away.
SPEAKER_00: um so yeah sure i would maybe still prefer to just defend the title a couple of times still be those two russians alan zeloy and do you have do you have a plan to permanently have it and put somewhere the belt of course after we like like do you care about it to have it permanently ah maybe i don't know i don't really need the belt as a thing but uh the title is important to me yeah the title
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but the title is the belt, you know, that's what it represents, yeah. So I really want to defend it, maybe get even more confidence and then I can try a bigger grind. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I have around 20 East vs West titles. I mean, the belt inside, but it's not mine anyways.
SPEAKER_01: They are ready for the future events. Yeah. Yeah, so that's good. That's good. So probably April 20th and you versus Arthur is possible. Let me talk with him. What's his plans as well? But looks like he's ready. What's that? Yeah, let's just finalize it and I'm ready. I will start preparing. Yeah, what do you think about the what do you think about the
SPEAKER_00: um the some of the matches at the east versus west yeah king of the table do you think that dave chappie this time can he still beat uh vitale like last time he did seems um that it might be difficult just because his recent results were not that great um i would almost guess that vitale just gets serious now and comes gets back um
SPEAKER_00: But yes, still, maybe it's a good match to see. I'm sure Vitaly wants it back, so sure, let's run it again. But I would guess that Vitaly gets it this time. And would you like to have, like you said, an 85 kilo match? Do you mean to be a double champion in East vs West 75 and 85? Yeah, good question.
SPEAKER_00: You know, that thing is maybe still too difficult. I still need to add a couple more years of training. And then maybe one day. But maybe at the moment, I'm not thinking about that. At the moment, maybe I would like to start by simply winning left and right arms in 75. Okay, okay. So you are looking for a left arm title before you are looking for a heavier category.
SPEAKER_00: do you think it would be fair to put your title match in 85 kilo uh without having any other matches in that category are you had how many matches you had there yeah i had justin bishop i had the crystal yeah yeah yeah yeah oh yeah um you had that um ranking of the 85 kilo class posted somewhere right and i remember i was the very last one number 10 um
SPEAKER_01: So maybe it's time to update it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. As I said, you know, like sometimes when we cannot really find a worthy title, like now since you are the champion, not everyone can come and pull against you at 75. It needs to be someone worth, you know, like to pull, you know. They can be Yanis, they can be Alan Zolev, it can be Artur Makaro or someone just new, Emil Amashadyan can be with right arm, yeah. And yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but you still have some matches. You have like one and a half years. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Anyways, so... And another match, Reno versus Bacho at the King of the Table. Yeah, I feel like that should be the main event. That one is probably the most interesting. This one? Yeah. Sorry? This match is the most interesting for you?
SPEAKER_00: me yes that's the one um and yeah i don't know what's gonna happen still both guys are a bit unpredictable you know very young and they are making big progress so it's just hard to see what's gonna happen but we just need we just need to find out who is a better who's a better guy out of these two yeah and you do you don't have any prediction huh um
SPEAKER_00: I have my own prediction. I don't know if I should say or not. It's not my event, but still, you know. No, it's hard. I don't know. I can see both guys winning in different ways. So, let's just see who made more progress during the past...
SPEAKER_01: And by the way, Rino did well against Ivan Matushenko. I feel like he lost, but he did pretty well. From what I saw, he... Somebody just asked Victor, what about Mindaugas versus Engin at 85 kilos? Let me answer this first. There are better ways to suicide in this life than Mindaugas pulling me when I'm 10 kilos heavier.
SPEAKER_00: So let's say maybe you should come back, fight Samusha, beat Samusha, and then I... No, no, no, don't go down. If you beat Samusha, I will come up to beat you. Oh, so Samusha will be my qualification match to get a match for you. Exactly. At 85 kilos, okay. Perfect. If you beat Samusha, then we know what you are worth. I'm worth to pull against you. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: okay okay i mean since you are my guest so i won't be messing with you so much this this is enough you know and yeah but that's good confidence that you are not ready for 85 kilo reacts you need a few years but if i beat samusha i will be qualified to pull against you okay yeah very logical right
SPEAKER_01: Okay, yeah. But you know that I cannot beat Samusha, so this match will never happen then. You said Vela. I didn't say anything. No, no. I said I should pull him. And you said that if you beat him, you get to pull against me. This is what you said. Did I say I'm going to beat him?
SPEAKER_00: so you i think you got me like yes i was just hiding behind samusha you were hiding behind samusha do you need that i guess so yeah oh i thought on the stage when i said i'm gonna come down to 75 you said that you don't need to lose weight i will pull you at wherever you are you remember that but i know i remember that i would actually still pull you at even at 92 or 95 whatever
SPEAKER_01: Do you know why I put the training video that after I beat Vior Aldobri and then you had the 78 kilo event and then we pulled? So I just wanted to remind you when there is the weight difference, you know, that things doesn't really look so close. You know, that's what I wanted to remind you.
SPEAKER_01: It's good that I reminded. Your victory against Vero was pretty beautiful. So, yeah, I'll give you that. Yeah, he has good back pressure. But top-rolling him is not... Listen, for me, to top-roll him is not a super good idea. I can take his wrist. But, I mean, I think the control in his pronation and hitting sideways was easier because you pull from here. When you over-pronate, you are missing the guy's pronation because you are over-pronated.
SPEAKER_01: yeah and then it will be hard to finish him you know so it's almost like you are yeah by toppling too much you are almost just wasting time and allowing him to sit in that yeah his arm needs to be open like this but you are just pulling this way and then you are not putting pressure here actually you are even getting away from there while you need to press that arm here you know i think that this this copying is the like most most most important 50 of arm wrestling
SPEAKER_01: the capping strength yeah yeah once you control the guy's pronator really not like a little bit because you do a little bit you press it you may not still go but if you like you know like this and then like then then all you need is just a little bit pronator a little bit just to block him the rest will be like this yeah wow but it is it is beautiful i would like to pull against you like i mean just just because i enjoy you know like arm wrestling with against another
SPEAKER_00: like i shouldn't say another masters not because you are not mastered but if i say another then i will call myself master i sound humble you know so and you are and you're not like me you cannot uh you cannot be so how to say arrogant like me right yeah but anyways i don't even know where are you at now like what is your level now do you feel like you are still in a great shape
SPEAKER_01: No, no, no. I'm like maybe 65, 70. Like I was very good, like good shape. Now, I don't know how good I was, but whenever I fell down, like I was just like hanging myself like this, one arm, and then boom, the belt was, and I hit so terrible. I watched your video. It's terrible. Yeah, yeah. The video is like an example. It didn't happen that time, you know, but it happened at home. I had a pull-up bar, and I put the belt there, and then I was hanging.
SPEAKER_01: Boom, you know, it was terrible. Anyway, so like 28 days, I didn't train except I did one table time one week later just to see myself. But I was able to take the risk. But whenever I was present, like here, everywhere, like was not connected. And then there was East versus West 10. And then I had stem cell therapy. So doctor told me to not to train for
SPEAKER_01: five weeks and i went to dubai for arif ertem and nisa as a coach you know and then when i come back i start training one month i train now after like two months no training and one month and now again 10 days i didn't train because of these first was 11. today i did a bicep curl i did some supination i did some supinated side pressure and some fingers some static riser
SPEAKER_01: you know and i don't know where i am but i can say that 65 maybe 70 percent but i don't know the most important thing is to lose the weight i am every day i'm saying like when i go back and i get up and i said today i will be very i will be eating very clean and then they till the evening everything goes well in the evening like okay i i tell to my son just go to the store and buy this and this that that that and then again same day next day again the same regrets
SPEAKER_01: and then i'm guessing that you are eating just too many carbs and uh yes and that's why the inflammation yeah that that's the inflammation that's the biggest pain but i will tell you something i cannot say that like i'm like totally healed up or something but i think the one injection i i had 17 of them one was into my joint capsule
SPEAKER_01: And before, I was like, whenever I press, I was feeling like it's going to be broken. The muscles were everywhere strong, but the joint capsule was just so weak. But now I kind of feel stronger. And if I have that therapy a few more times, and if I can really press without any pain, I mean, you all under 85, you know, whoever breathing is in trouble, I will tell you something. Because you know me. You know me. You know my key points are good. I just need more.
SPEAKER_01: or this you know yeah yeah but again i would like to thank you at zloty also just mostly because of your joint problems i get yeah yeah yeah it was even washer because four weeks before that i was 65 kilo at the waft yeah so i got even more dry more dry you know and it's not really good but i would like to pull against you just to put that strap and then let's see
SPEAKER_01: like i don't think you can take my wrist or something but if you can somehow remain your risk position maintain flat yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that's all i need yes all you need yeah but i am afraid that you know my pronator once i invoke you know it will go but we will see listen even if your risk goes if your pronator remains it's still a good chance really
SPEAKER_00: And as I told you, now I'm a bit more, even a bit more explosive. I could prepare in a pretty good way against you, where I would maybe, I would not necessarily need to just catch you low and be very defensive. I can also just explode a bit more. Yeah, but you know, even like, yeah, I understand, yeah. But the thing is, usually, even I see some of those matches in a slow motion, you start first, but when you pull, your wrist goes, you understand?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah. Yeah, many years ago. Yeah, yeah, yeah. How many years ago? Many years ago. How many years ago? Yeah, yeah, you're right. You're right. It was, yeah. When was it even? Like 2019 February? Probably, yeah. Yeah, five years. Wow. After a long time, yeah. Imagine that you are now stronger. It's not the same. It's not the same. Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Just all I want is you to just provoke me, you know, before the event. Just talk tons of shit. Make it personal. And then, yeah. No, I can always do that. I'm very talented, by the way. Yeah, but you said the last time I heard, you said you are not going to do that. But if you pull, I will make sure that I will throw the first stone. So you will have to reply. And then I will be like, you know, Engie.
SPEAKER_01: He said this. Now you need to destroy him. Make it as personal as possible. But be careful because I can push it even harder. You don't know my limit here yet. Last time I was holding myself back. Yeah, you better hold yourself. You better hold yourself. Yeah, you better. Anyway, so... Oh, he says, Andrei is really closely...
SPEAKER_01: following armwrestling, you said, didn't he have some special technique prepared for you? Arm bender or something. Yeah, he said that he had it. Yeah, he said that he had it. We will keep it for a match. I will... No, you said this before our supermatch, you said. Yeah, I did say that. Yeah, yeah. I still have that plan in mind, so... You still have the plan failed, you know, come on, find something new. No, no, no, no.
SPEAKER_01: no last time yeah let's forget the last time like i will also tell you something my friend whenever you judge me don't judge like what you see you are seeing someone who is hurt there there there and he is just trying to use whatever is not hurt just imagine that maybe if some of the parts become healthy somehow and then you understand like before when we pull
SPEAKER_01: zloty even in the super match i was still all pronated but just go and watch when we train you know when you train the the video that i posted if you realize i'm also pressing with the downside of my hand it is because the disciplination part was healthy do you understand or not no i get it i get it yeah it was just like more likely i was over pronating and then then whenever uh whenever
SPEAKER_01: So you see Engin, part of what... See, look at, I'm not over-pronouncing, just look at here. Now you start, see I'm hitting your arm. Before I was only hitting your hand, you realize?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but, you know, this is also, you know, a side table. It's not... Yeah, but it is not about that. Even if it's a side table, I was doing like this because I had... You were able to just control... Yeah, now I am able to keep this, not like this, but I'm building here. At that time, it was healthy. Now I'm still training, training. So once I block here, and then my pronator will be even more effective. And then you will be like, you know, wow, after five years, nothing changed, you know.
SPEAKER_00: But look, I'm available until I am 65. It's okay. Okay, great. But you see, I feel like one of the qualities which makes for a good athlete is also an ability to stay healthy, avoid injuries, make sure that your joints are healthy and so on. And you did a pretty good time, pretty well, because you are even still now in a great shape. How old are you? 49, right?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I have been pulling for 33 years, yeah. And just a few years ago, you were still fighting Makaro. Now you were going for David Samusha. I will tell you something. If bicep didn't tear, I was really beating Arthur. It was round second, you know. And you can say that he was strong, that's why. He didn't know. Do you know what happened? I put my feet, foot, you know, to the right corner and then...
SPEAKER_01: I pulled him so hard, and then his wrist got open, but I still pulled him. And after he lost everything, the more I pulled him, I pulled actually his left.
SPEAKER_01: And Rocky Radialis. And then whenever I pulled unnecessarily more, he was like, he was like, like this, he went. I still beat him because I took everything. I get close. So don't you think the biceps went after you trying to go sideways a bit? No, no, no, no, no. I felt it. Whenever I pull like this, I felt like something from here down here slided, you know.
SPEAKER_01: It's lighted, you know, you cannot maybe see here because of the light, but maybe here. Did you get it fixed? No, no, no. Doctor told me 20% is holding on it. Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah. But trust me, they would finish 5-0. Even Arthur came to me. He told me that I was better, you know. And then whenever I beat him, the first two rounds was nine seconds.
SPEAKER_01: and same year his matches with alan zoleva all together the active matches was more than two minutes you know yeah i mean i think that i can still be effective but i really don't know if if my body will allow me you know i don't know if if if i can like that's up to you to solve right that's the that's the problem you have and you kind of have to go around it and manage to fix it
SPEAKER_01: Yeah. You know where the problem is? The problem is I'm more focused on the organizing East versus West. And I really need to put... That's why I was successful. I was putting arm wrestling myself to be success to the first place. Now,
SPEAKER_01: like now like it's more important that one so if i do it i need to pull in dubai i don't think i should pull here because here yeah like three hours sleep four hours sleep i need to do the production and the venue and this yeah yeah yeah i don't know yeah yeah yeah i mean i'm happy for you you really like you were like when you say like for long time people made fun with you
SPEAKER_01: Not that because you are someone to be made fun, but whenever you said that you mastered arm wrestling, and then it was like, okay, this guy is just too highly thinking of himself. But whenever I saw you against someone like Daniel, as you said, he is considered pound for pound the strongest arm wrestler on this earth.
SPEAKER_01: together with Alan and a few guys. And whenever you beat him, and the way that you arm wrestle, it was not arm wrestling. You really did the art there. You play chess.
SPEAKER_01: everything in mix you know like something by sounding millimeter by millimeter your arm muscle incredible and people think that maybe daniel is only strong daniel is one of the smartest arm wrestling arm wrestler as well yeah exactly exactly yeah and you see also sometimes you know it's a bit unusual for uh an arm wrestler to be able to continue a fight uh after losing his wrist
SPEAKER_00: but uh daniel is just so special you know people maybe they don't realize how difficult it is to finish that match having in mind how daniel has a great endurance so you cannot yeah super strong so you cannot finish him quickly and he's flopping you know and then
SPEAKER_01: You can struggle for a minute maybe and then he'll just pin you. So it's super difficult to go around it. You had to do a perfect execution, you know, perfect. And you did it. And I don't think there is anyone knows Daniel as good as you do. I think you know everything from A to Z about Daniel. And also he knows you, but this event you show something different that probably he'll learn as well.
SPEAKER_00: So now I'm really waiting to see what's going to happen next time I meet him, because it's probably going to be tough. I'm sure it's going to be tough. What if he comes back and says, let's do a rematch? Yeah, I would take it. I would take it. Not before you pull someone else? Even before I pull someone else, I can take it, sure. Because he deserves it, right? He deserves it. Daniel deserves all the respect in the world. Yeah, if he wants to...
SPEAKER_00: can go again no problem but but also i'm still quite confident about that because um you know he said that maybe he needs to change his wrist or endurance none of these things will really help him to fix the problem i feel like he must find a different solution can i ask you something do you think that one of the reason that like you beat him is because compared to the past
SPEAKER_01: his wrist is much stronger and his latest events is able to have the wrist control and beat people, wrist control and beat people. And he didn't really have to do this a lot as before. In the past, this was often happening and he was very well trained, but last,
SPEAKER_01: two years i can say or more he he usually have his cup and then he's beating like he's not put in this position so often you know and and and now maybe he is not that used to anymore pulling that style a little bit like yeah he still he still said that he was training for a full month uh just to play in that position but uh
SPEAKER_00: also you see like back in uh 2018 in moldova yeah just we we knew each other's level a bit more so um daniel didn't even attempt to um maintain his wrist right he didn't even try to cut me he was immediately just kind of jumping uh to the floor yeah yeah yeah and to me i don't like that like i really prefer if he is actually trying to contain like i i really want him to
SPEAKER_01: hope that he will maintain his rest. That's the best. Yeah. There is one idiot. He won Lou. I think he doesn't wash his mouth. He was going to see the fucking match, but now he's going to be hide user on this channel. Boom. Anyway. So, uh, yeah. Anyways, uh, uh, thank you very much, my friend. And we will keep in touch. There is a possibility, uh,
SPEAKER_01: that apple 20 you know you you will have to defend your title yeah we will keep in touch yeah i will write you yeah and thank you for being my guest and i have seriously like we joke each other you know but um seriously i have big respect for you um you're doing a very good job east versus west like beautiful
