SPEAKER_01: Two Sasho cards. You mean from the East versus West 10? Because it was Sasho pull right and left arm, Rafa. Yeah. Yeah. My recovery is fine. You know, the only problem is that this liquid from here went to the forehead first and then went down to the under eyes. But they are getting okay, you know. I think it will be fine.
SPEAKER_01: Hello, Mohamed Alain. Hello, clerks. Yes, one was signed. One was not because we cannot make the same guy sign two cards while everyone else is signing one. So hello, Steezy. Hello, my friends. Thank you. Thank you. I just had air transplant and
SPEAKER_01: I thought that I couldn't do it live or anything, you know, for a month. But after one month, not one month, six days, six days. I want to say one week, but it's six days. I'm feeling okay. Aleykum salam. Hello, Victor. Hello, Michael. Yeah, Michael Todd will be joining, yeah. Hello, Ray Erdil. Hello, Lagia. Yeah, he was good, yeah. Feneri.
SPEAKER_01: Great to see you, my friend, and you are looking younger than ever since I was doing this job. I had a hair transplantation, so you see it's still not recovered yet, but ... Hello, David. Hello, Drew.
SPEAKER_01: Hello, Michael. This way. Let me try to move it. Yeah. There you go. How are you? Hey, buddy. I'm well, I'm well. Good to see you. Good to see you. Yeah, yeah. But looks still like a little bit like the liquid just went down, down, down until here and looks like, you know, under eyes are still, yeah. We should do one for you as well. Yeah. We all came to 50, but so, normally. So, I watched your match today.
SPEAKER_01: Like at the same time that you streamed on the channel. Yeah, I mean, I was like, first of all, like what I saw, like Paolo was huge. I never seen him that big. Huge, huge. I was like, my God, he's so big. And so after I saw him, I was like, okay, what's going to happen now?
SPEAKER_01: And for a moment, like you both didn't have the full wrist control and he went to the shoulder pressure. And I was like, is his bicep gonna hold it? Is his bicep gonna hold it? And you held it, you know, yeah. And you were so stubborn about this shoulder pressure as well. And then, yeah. But all I can say,
SPEAKER_01: I don't think you are 100% ready, but two months before your match with Frank Lamparelli, if this was the shape against Lamparelli, I would just say a good match, close match. But let's see how you're going to put, but we don't know how much Lamparelli is going to... But Lamparelli may not have the horsepower that Pablo has, but he is...
SPEAKER_00: much more technical, the hand control and everything. So I think we're going to watch a good match. Yeah. I'm excited about it. And the funny thing is, so I was supposed to pull Lars next weekend, right? And because Lars got pushed to June, I suggested to you, Frank Lamparelli. So I'm going against two completely different opponents. So I just pulled a very, very strong person. Now I'm about to pull a very technically good top roller.
SPEAKER_00: Six weeks later, I'm going to pull a very good bit wrist presser. Completely different style. I want to face everything. I want to be comfortable facing everything. The biggest takeaway I have from my match with Pablo is I need to focus on my cup because my pronation is strong. Everything else is strong. My arm is strong. If I can just keep my wrist like this, I mean, it doesn't have to be here. If I can just keep it and go on there, then I have so much more control. I spoke to you just a little bit ago about that.
SPEAKER_00: So that's going to be my focus on everything else. I will keep training, keep getting stronger. One thing that was exciting when I talked to Pablo is he said he was strongest three months after his stem cells on my last stem cell was six weeks ago. And I've only in the last three weeks started going above my maintenance workouts. So these next, I have nine weeks. So these next eight weeks will be my, my prepping peaking time. So I actually start to get pushing myself harder. So I'm excited, you know?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I mean, since you're coming back, every week will be improvement, I have no doubt. But after they clean everything on the elbow and everything, people...
SPEAKER_01: some people they don't know your uh path you know right like you could hold someone here like one something on the pad even before you started that open arm yeah i mean you you can always also they some people were thinking that that arm would open because they were thinking it's all about the elbow right while it i mean you always
SPEAKER_01: I say weird because you don't see it. Because it's unusual. It's very unusual. You know what I'm saying? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't know. I don't know. It was hopeful, hopeful. Like, if it was like you just said, 235, 240 shape of Paolo, I don't know. But now you said 270, or I heard wrong? Okay, so he weighed 271. I woke up that morning weighing 118 kg, so I was 261.
SPEAKER_00: but when I didn't dress up to 67, the crazy thing. So he outweighed me by four pounds. Well, actually armrests, we went and had sushi and I weighed 275.4 and he weighed 275.8. He went 125.3 kgs. Uh, so he's the biggest and the strongest and probably the healthiest shape. He said, I've never been this big. He said, I've never been this big. So he was definitely a, it was great. I had such a great weekend because to me it was a learning experience. It helped me know.
SPEAKER_00: where I'm at, which showed me what I need to work on. Because if I wouldn't have had this match, I probably wouldn't have started focusing on my cup so much. Because I did not know that there was still a hole, right? But the cup, it's not a weakness necessarily, but if you compare it to everything else, it's the weakest part of the chain. Yes, yes, yes. If you had this, it would be dominant win. Now, you balance the match and won with your, like,
SPEAKER_01: well-rounded endurance and everything you know you wanted but if you also had this right away or just a little bit even then it would be just you would just wait you know this is how i go but i'm telling you to do this through that shape of paulo was impressive yeah impressive well thank you yeah i mean it was fun it was fun good times but i'm excited man i'm excited about this journey so um i feel like i got a second chance you know
SPEAKER_00: I had the perfect opportunity to say, okay, well, I've got surgery. I'm out. I'm going to just do something else. But that time away made me hungrier, and I want it more now than I did before. But I will tell you something, you believe or not, the time away, your bicep was injured, but anywhere else was...
SPEAKER_01: like getting healed up because you were pushing and pushing and pushing years and years and years. Now you rested a little bit and then everything rested. Your body rested. You mentally get, you know, like all that rest that you needed. Yeah. Michael Workspace, high-hanging and Michael from Texas. Good job, Michael versus Paulo. He says, yeah. Yeah. Thank you, Michael. I appreciate the support, man. Like I said, good times.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah. So you have Frank Lamparelli, as you said, one of the purest top roller versus one of the purest shoulder pressure guy. And it will be, it's a challenge to get ready for like all the way this way and all the way this way, all the way in and all the way out. Right, right. So did you see like the final match in the strap, how close I can get my press? Yeah, yeah, yeah. So much closer. It used to be like I had to press like this and now I can,
SPEAKER_00: I can, so I'm excited about that. I'm excited about the, uh, the Lars match. I really am. I'm obviously, I'm excited about Frank as well, but I'm excited about possibly having that access to just go in there. You know what I mean? And then give Lars his own medicine. A little bit, a little bit. Yeah. Yeah. I have a question for you when you go inside, like, like with the shoulder pressure and then once the guy stops you, you quickly.
SPEAKER_01: Like switch to outside. Of course, that's a good thing because you can also get out. And because you do that, you have some cup in. And then when you get out, you know, you are like having the screen in your cup as well. But the reason that you are doing this, you don't feel safe where you go if the opponent stops you or you're not yet confident. It is instinctive. If I go one way and it gets stopped, I immediately go somewhere else. Like, I don't even think to just hold it.
SPEAKER_00: just okay what would happen if you would hold it i have no idea okay i have no idea because it's as soon as it stops my mind doesn't even do anything my body just reacts so i don't even know i'm doing i just do it that's exactly what i see i have seen you doing this with many people like i even remember you did this a few times with kakashi's
SPEAKER_01: Same exact thing. You hit the press, you miss it, you come back. You hit the press, you don't finish with it. You immediately come back for it. But it makes the opponent like, holy shit, where's he going? I'm trying to defend this and now he's going there, you know? Yeah, because your pronation and outside hit is so strong. Even from deep in there, you can still go outside. I can still switch it, yeah. But in the past, you also were able to pull inside.
SPEAKER_00: Do you think that there is a possibility that to come, do you plan to train that as well, or you just want to go with your latest abilities that, you know, before the surgery? So I have been pulling more hook matches with Corey lately. Um, yeah, so it, I like it. I like the way it feels. Um, so the more supination that I can get, the more I can get this to fully supinate.
SPEAKER_00: and get that cup the deep, like if I could get more flexibility in my wrist to get the cup deeper, I could see me getting some inside banging matches with some folks if I wanted to, you know? Yeah. You know what, Michael, I have advice for you. I think you should celebrate the victory with cake and then share with your wife.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it sounds like a good idea. Thanks for the super chat, Rebecca. Yeah. So for you, it's probably no problem at all to go down to 253. It's just like one day effort probably, right? Yeah. So I woke up at 261, but the very day before I was 258, so 117. I was literally...
SPEAKER_01: four and a half pounds away yes four and a half pounds away what is it what is the goal uh michael like your first goal is probably to do something in 115 and then after that you want to do something in supers or you want to just switch you know time to time well i'm gonna i'm gonna go since you asked i'm gonna go ahead and lay out my perfect case scenario okay so be successful against against frank
SPEAKER_00: Six weeks later, be successful against Lars. That would be number nine and number six. If Devin doesn't come back to 115, like if he doesn't come back by July or August to defend at 115, somehow convince you to have an interim world title match between me and Prudnik or me and Matashenko. But if that doesn't happen, I would still pull either one of those guys for a ranking match or jump up into supers and pull Speck off.
SPEAKER_01: Okay. I like those. I like those options. I like those options. I mean, I still have two people in a way to get there. Yeah. I mean, once you beat, like, at 115, if Prudnik is ready, if Matushenko or Dadikyan, you know, like, any of these guys, like, beating each other, they deserve, I believe, the title shot for Devon. 115. But the thing is, do you really want to
SPEAKER_00: push it in this year or you want to just. Okay. So the other option would be, uh, Frank Lars. Reno or Sandra's maybe. Then Prudnik then just clear out the whole class, you know, just clear out the whole class. Now the only other option, if Devin, if Devin was to beat, if Devin beats Lavon,
SPEAKER_00: he's the champion in both categories yeah i would rather earn a spot at 115 jump up to supers and try to find a way to earn a spot in supers and i'd rather face him for the super heavyweight versus the heavyweight if he's the champion but if lavon's a champion i would try to secure that heavyweight title first if it was an option and then try to get heavier maybe next year and go for supers but i like the idea of pulling speck off
SPEAKER_00: The way he pulls, the way I pull, if I can get 10% stronger and get my cup, I think that guy's in trouble. I think I got a shot. You know, seriously. Yeah. Yeah. Because, because he doesn't have any shoulder pressure. Exactly. Yeah. But do you, do you see him like top rolling and totally that like, not like this, but I don't, I don't think, I don't think he can in the strap. Honestly, I have no offense. I mean, I think as long as I'm doing what I'm doing, both of our wrists will be cracked.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. He may have a little bit more advantage, but I have all that side pressure commitment and transitional ability to oppress as the match extends, as it extends and goes longer and longer and longer. I mean, I'm not ready for somebody like that now, but I think I can be, you know, I think I can be, I'm going to be honest, dude. I want to find out what happens to armies and Dennis. I would love to sometime the next 12 months, have a chance to pull Dennis again. Cause we have history. I pinned him three times. He's pinned me five times. He won once on foul. So.
SPEAKER_01: I've won three times, he's won six times. I would love to pull Dennis again. Yeah, that part that people don't understand it. Seriously, that part, not because you are here. I also say this when you are not here. I repeat this before, but whenever I talk about you with your opponents, whatever I see, feel,
SPEAKER_01: and then whatever like those some trolls talk you know that is is totally totally different you understand no no i want to tell this this is not because i'm like taking your side or something it is just like people they don't want to pull you many of them unless they are like really really really like levon like devon type of guys you know like many of the people they they don't want to pull against you like i don't want to even say name but one of those names you mentioned yeah
SPEAKER_01: I mean, I asked to one of those really top guys, you know, under 15. He's like, maybe someone else. And then when I was like one of them, you know who they are. And they were like, oh, I'm not ready, you know. So whatever they see,
SPEAKER_01: is like something very dangerous, whatever those guys on the social media, they are like, you know, he is, has been, you know, he's like nothing. And I was like, are we talking about the same guy? You know? Right. Yeah. But it's okay. Important is to gain the respect of the openness, you know? Yeah. Yes. To have the respect of my peers means more to have the respects of the people who are just following the sport. But on that same note, in my opinion,
SPEAKER_00: This, this, this second chance is going to give me an opportunity to once again, prove that I deserve to be amongst the very top guys in the world. And I think if I don't do something stupid, I have a very good chance of achieving what I want. So I'm excited, man. I mean, it's, it may not be the, it may not go like this or maybe some, some heels I have to climb to get there, but I think we, I think I've chosen a very good path, you know?
SPEAKER_01: And I know I'll be faced with adversity, but I'm willing to do the work. So fingers crossed. I'm excited about what's coming, you know? Yeah, yeah. I mean, you have all the knowledge, you have all the experience. How long have you been playing? Almost 35 years. Yeah, this is my 34th year. Yeah, 34th year. Yeah. So, I mean, you have, like, what did you not see? I mean, you, rest in peace, in prime of Pushkar, I mean, you're beating him.
SPEAKER_01: Until he figured out this one, he had to foul, restart. I was right there. I was right there. You have three wins against Denis, you're talking about. You have defeated Devin. You have defeated many of those guys. I'm just saying that people should be more respectful. Anyway, as I said, you have enough of experience, knowledge, and now you feel healthier. I don't know. I see you more positive. I think today,
SPEAKER_00: uh or the match happened yesterday what you saw i think helped your confidence it did it really did i appreciate all the kind words and i don't want because you asked me what my goals are i gave you my goals i don't want to disrespect frank or lars i'm not looking past anybody i had a very good conversation with aramis and he said listen everybody you arm wrestle in your mind you need to prepare as if you're pulling levon that's how important every match is
SPEAKER_00: So every single person that I'm going after, I'm going to treat it the same exact way. So the only thing I can see right now is in, you know, 62 days, I'm across the table from Frank Lamparelli and I need to win. I don't want to win. And I plan on winning. You know what I'm saying? That's how it works, you know. I kind of think that, of course, injury was terrible. Everything terrible. But from one side, it took the pressure away from you. You understand? A little bit. Because at that time, you were like,
SPEAKER_01: I had to push it, push it, push it, push it. Now you know that you cannot, you need to start from somewhere. It's somehow.
SPEAKER_01: like put the pressure away from you that you, if you pull, like maybe, maybe two years ago or one year ago, if I told you to pull Lamperelli, maybe you would just say and find me something, you know, someone like super heavyweight, stronger than that, you know? But right now, like, I think that it is going to be, not the injury, but it is going to be better that you need to go step by step. It will be, I think, it will have,
SPEAKER_01: better results but let's see let's see frank absolutely someone someone that like uh like people whenever i said uh matt mask against frank people people were like oh you found someone weak for matt so finally 100 frank was gonna be a bad match for him i was like i know frank frank's bad dude you know yeah
SPEAKER_00: It's because Matt is so hand-dominant. Sorry to interrupt you. Matt's so hand-dominant, and Fred top-rows everybody. You know what I mean? So, I was like... Did you see his match even with Georgi Svetkov? I was about to say the same thing. 2022, right? Yeah, yeah. I was right there. I watched it. He still gave him some trouble. That is a dangerous individual right there. People who just saw the East vs. West match with Matt Mask, they're going off that. I'm going off...
SPEAKER_00: The match was spec off and the fact that I pulled this dude back in 2008, you know, and he damn it broke my heart. We've had, we've had our history, you know, we're three, I beat him three times. He's beaten me too. And they were ugly. So he wants revenge and I don't want to let him get it. Yeah. I think, I think he and Reno had like very, very, very, very tough matches, uh, Europeans. I don't know if you saw or not, but. I have not, but I'm going to look that up. I want to try to find it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: We did deadlifts and he stopped him here. It was very long. They had starts, fouls, protests, restarts, and things like that. At the end, Reno won, but it was war. It was war. Listen, Frank has been a great puller for a very long time. Go back and watch him top-rolling the younger Hermes. He was cracking Hermes' wrists. He was a bad dude, man. Bad dude. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: one of those top role specialists. Yeah, without a doubt. And he makes himself so tall. He posts so hard and he's just set so straight up. And his wrist is just like, you know, he hits it good. He hits it good. I'm hoping that my hand and wrist with the cup improvement and my back pressure will slow him down. I think we can slip strap and I could control him with back pressure. I mean,
SPEAKER_00: I mean, whether or not I could take his hand or what, you know, as long as I can keep mine somewhat flat and just control the back pressure, he will have to come to me and eventually his wrist will fold, in my opinion. Yeah. I mean, it's interesting. I mean, what if I tried to shoulder press him or something? That would be crazy. Like, who knows? Yeah, risky as well, risky as well, you know. A little bit, a little bit risky, yeah. I don't see that match going easy for...
SPEAKER_01: either side. Somehow, I don't see you dominating him either. For sure, he's not going to dominate you either, but it will be a tough match because his hand control is very, very good. It is hard to hunt him. I'm sure Pablo is stronger than Frank, but Frank has much more control, hand control, my opinion. No, he has phenomenal hand control, for sure. That's a match I would like. It would be interesting to see Pablo and Frank.
SPEAKER_00: because Pablo is very powerful right now. So all these wins and stuff and all these matches he's done, he was doing it with just power. He had one lane to arm wrestle in, but he didn't really know what to do if the match stopped. So he went out to Bob Brown and Bob Brown showed him about watching your opponent's elbow placement, moving your elbow around the pad. And he's a much more proficient arm wrestler. And that was great for me to get to experience that because his power level is very high.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, you need to go in like 10 minutes or something, but I want to ask you, how many matches did you comment together with Travis? How many matches did we commentate? Yeah, together, yeah. Oh God, probably five or six out of the event, probably. Did you meet any of those Alexander matches? Yeah, I was in the background while he was commenting about Alexander.
SPEAKER_00: So I was like, dude, it's not Alexander. Well, listen, I loved it. I loved it. You know, Hermes was there. You were there. Neil was there. Travis was there. It was probably fun, huh? It was a lot of fun. So on that note, so let's just say there's an East versus West card that happens and you can't get me a match because you have to give everyone a match. If you ever need me to commentate, I'm more than happy. I had a great time.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it will be great. You are one of those guys that know what you are talking about. We will have you again together with Lamparelli before the East World Cup. What was your impression about those guys? Were you impressed by Ali Can, for example?
SPEAKER_00: Oh my God. Somebody could be that strong. Cause if you look at him, he does not look imposing. I was amazed that he did that to prove it. Cause prudence a bad, bad dude. Um, but yeah. Uh, which you was just talking about what not Vladimir, that kid does not look like he's an arm wrestler. I mean, holy crap. That dude's a stud, you know? Yeah. Yeah. I was very impressed. Definitely a fan of, uh, both those guys for sure. And 40 years, he did an arm wrestle.
SPEAKER_01: And then he came with two, three months training that will not even viral. Yeah. It was, yeah. That's interesting. Very impressive. Yeah. And the guy, the young guy, uh, uh, to, that is the, they gave some trouble to with pronation. Yeah. Oh my God. Yeah. Very impressed that. And see, Travis didn't know the information, but you had told me, or you said it in the press conference or something that, uh,
SPEAKER_00: Oleg had lost the World Championship to a hooker, the guy from Kazakhstan, and that kid beat the guy from Kazakhstan. So it's because he could take the hookers with Oleg, but then he ran into two top rollers. So I knew it was going to be an interesting match. But how well that kid's pronation held up, how strong he was, even in a defensive position, was very impressive. Yeah, he needed more here, but even without the hand, the pronation was still holding here. Very impressive. And what do you think about David?
SPEAKER_00: I would love arm wrestling, but I think you do. Just think about you versus David. I would love that match. I'm not making 105 probably, but I would love to pull him. No, no, no. I have 115 kilos, you and him. Of course, of course. He's awesome. I have a lot of respect for him. You know, he's so aggressive, and to be able to pull Todd once the match stops and to still have that kind of power was amazing. But yeah, I would love that match. I think that's, I mean, it would be a challenge for me to, and that's the biggest thing for me. Frank, it's the next matchup.
SPEAKER_00: It's a difficult task because he is such a good top roller, right? Lars is a difficult match if I had the King's move. Like if he was to force me here, we've seen me and Jerry pull for seven minutes, right? So we know that's a difficult match. Donnie King would be somebody that I would know I'd have to peak for. Like I would have to be super strong because he's so explosive. He's got that second and third hit that he can keep hitting with. And the aggression he brings to the table, I would try to match that same aggression. So that would be fun.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, you know, that's a very interesting match because his hand and wrist is iron. Solid. But the problem with people who has iron hand and wrist is that once they cannot use it, then they are not super dangerous anymore because all their life they depend on this. The thing that you depend on most, the moment you lose it. Yeah, once you're like this,
SPEAKER_01: So you don't really know a lot, you know, because you never need it. You were just dominating and impressing anyone who is going outside, I talk about. Right, right, right. And your outside is incredible while his wrist is incredible. Like, Paul was telling Todd Hutchings to go to a strap, and he said he can't. He couldn't get there. No, he couldn't get there. And if you remember, like, one or two rounds, he also beat...
SPEAKER_01: Irakli we talked about earlier. So strong. After having the war with Prudnik that he lost left-handed. I was like, there's no way he's going to have anything for Irakli. He just ran over him. I was like, that's ridiculous. That was crazy. Superboy, Hermes versus Dennis. Michael prediction. Big fan of Michael. So listen, massive, massive respect for Dennis.
SPEAKER_00: He's just a big fan. Would love to go over there to Russia and train with him and stuff. But I'm also an equally big fan of Aramie's, right? In my opinion, Aramie's, his ability to explode outside into a top row and when necessary, transition into impress could potentially give Dennis problems because he does know how to pull a Kings move. And Dennis is doing a lot more open top rowing now, right? But the other thing is, because talking to Pablo, he thinks that Dennis's hand will be too strong
SPEAKER_01: for Hermes to get out of because of that low grip. I will tell you something. I really think that like, except here, I don't think that Hermes has anything less than Devon about the rest. And since Devon, Dennis is holding so low, it is kind of like disadvantage for Dennis because like he's not going far. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And what do you think about Devon and Levon? So Pablo and I talked about that as well.
SPEAKER_00: Uh, the only way it's a match, the only ways of a match is if Devin closes the gap in strength. The only way that I feel Lavon can win is to do it just like you did last time. Just be too strong. If Devin stops the match, even if it's round four, when I'm, when I say stop it, I'm not talking about stop it for a couple of seconds. I'm talking about stop it with this. If Lavon's wrist does that.
SPEAKER_00: It's not just because of Devin's endurance. Because Devin will have to max out every time. See, Devin's endurance isn't about he has such great endurance, in my opinion. It's because he rarely has to be at 100% of his maximum because he has such good levers and he can rest on his leverage while somebody else is at 100%. He's at 80% or 90%, right? So it appears that he has much greater endurance. But if you push him to 100% of his maximum, like he had to go against Gennady after those rounds got pretty tight, he's human. Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_00: So I don't think it's the endurance. If the match stops, I think it's psychological because even though Devon's so strong and so confident, part of him doesn't think he's strong enough to do it. So the moment that stops, I think there's a switch and he goes from, well,
SPEAKER_00: apparently I can do it and that confidence goes through the roof and that's where the talking starts like if he stops that match it will be a horrible day of all kinds of talking you know what I'm saying like he was gonna get the Hulk can you imagine what the crowd would do if he does it if he stops him yeah that place will go crazy you said there's gonna be like a thousand people that's gonna go crazy yeah so yeah I don't know I'm still saying Lavon's a 60 favorite
SPEAKER_01: But Devon, you know, Michael, Devon, like you, like me, like John, knows what he's doing. He knows it. It doesn't mean he's going to win. Just because you know something, you know about arm wrestling, it doesn't mean you're going to win. But what I'm just saying, if this guy is going there a second time,
SPEAKER_00: know he believes in himself he's gonna win he's not gonna win he's not going there for losing anyways you know for sure no no 100 like he's doing this because he he wants it right but there's i'm telling you there's still that little bit of self-doubt that he won't know until he grabs a hold of him until he grabs a hold of him he gets that first ready go he won't know where he stands and if he stops the match i'm telling you that switch his confidence can go through the roof and it's gonna be a it's gonna be a
SPEAKER_00: But at least he has some experience from the previous match. He knows what to expect, is what I try to say. There's a good chance he goes full-blown King's move every single round and complete disregard for the safety of his arm just to try to stop him. I mean, he might do it. Just hell with it. Boom. And just take that shot and just see if he can crack the wrist. And if he ever cracks it, it'd be crazy.
SPEAKER_01: yeah i i don't know i don't know what we he will be doing you know i think that that is one of the biggest nightmares in our nothing to be stopped by him you know just yeah yeah yeah right because he he he doesn't have any mercy he would just talk all kind of he will just yeah yeah yeah yeah hey man you got to respect what he's doing the fact that he's came back this far and we were talking about that i mean people can say whatever they want about the stem cells
SPEAKER_00: there's something to be said because it's working. I mean, the guy's not as big as he was when he faced me. He's 20 pounds lighter and he's stronger than he's ever been. Right. So it's about being healthy, my friends. Yeah. Something's working. Yeah. Yeah. I saw him against Dave Chaffee and everything, you know, when he did the shoulder pressure. Yeah. And then people, people need to understand something that like,
SPEAKER_01: It is, of course, Levan is favored. Levan is the strongest. But it is not only about the bicep size. It's not about how many kilos you're lifting. It helps. But just you need the coordination, the synergy that you can make at the table, you know, with the coordination. That is, like, I remember whenever I was saying that, like, guys, don't be sure that, you know, Hermes is going to beat Devon. There is a possibility that Devon may win because of his height and this and that.
SPEAKER_01: And people were like, oh, you're trying to sell pay-per-view, you talk this way. No, it's not. You know, there is, there is, there is, there was a possibility. We saw it. It doesn't mean that Hermes cannot just train and then come back and beat Devon. But at that time, there was a possibility. And then, yeah. And then I kind of think that you will be going on that way as well. You know, I will tell you something. The stem cell helps everyone, but it will help and make more difference with the people at our age. Because we are the most damaged one.
SPEAKER_01: But we have so much experience, but we are limited. Once we are unlimited, at least about the moment, the things are changing because there are a lot of things that we have forgotten and they are coming back. Exactly. I mean, seriously, that's the thing. That's why I feel so thankful and blessed right now because I was patient. I did what my surgeon told me to do. I was patient. I've been blessed to have VitaCell support.
SPEAKER_00: Everything, I think everything's going to work out real well. And I'm just, you know, I'm having fun again. And that's the biggest thing. Um, if this wasn't fun, I wouldn't be doing it. Yeah. I'm having fun again. You know, I'm glad you got me to come to East versus West in January, because it was good to get out of my head and leave and come be with my friends and stuff. It helped you, right? It helped you mentally. Yeah. A little bit. Like I want to be a part of it. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, when I got home, I got hit with like this big wave of depression. Cause I was back into reality, you know?
SPEAKER_00: but it helped a lot so it like yesterday helped me so much because having pablo here having that weekend of fellowship and and training and competition between because we we worked out a whole bunch after we all wrestled so uh but yeah it's just good man it's it's it's a good place to be the community has always it's always felt like a brotherhood to me my arm wrestling family is you know what i'm planning listen uh michael like i
SPEAKER_01: can claim only to be one of the biggest armwrestling fans, myself, fan. You know it, yeah. Oh, yeah. I tried to bring Arsen Liliyev back to the armwrestling, and then he was almost coming, and then the thing started in Ukraine, you understand, the war, fight. So he couldn't come, and then I brought him here intentionally to do East vs. West 10.
SPEAKER_01: I was like being very sneaky, you know. I didn't do anything, but I knew that he was going to come and he would be infected again, you understand? Now he's training like crazy. He's sending me and he's like telling me the numbers. The numbers are 70, 80, 90% in different moments. And today I asked him, yeah, and then I kind of convinced him, but I also asked John, let's see what he will say. But I plan to set in November, John Burzing versus Arsene Lille.
SPEAKER_00: A rematch? Wow. Yeah. Yeah, it would be good. Yeah, that's good stuff. So, John's so funny because we talk, you know, and he's like, yeah, I think I'm going to retire. He can never retire because when you get back in the environment, you just want to do it again, you know? Yeah, I mean, the only thing he needs to do is he must not make any plans. He needs to sit down. You feel good, just train, train. Engin, set me a match.
SPEAKER_01: You understand? Not like, you know, there is something that is said and you need to make yourself ready for this. No. John needs to feel relaxed, get ready, and then ask for a match. Nothing else, you know. So, once again, okay, Surem Hakobjanyan. Thank you. 2018, Dennis versus Devin on right arm today. Who wins? They're asking your opinion.
SPEAKER_00: So I know recently I haven't watched the video, but I heard the Devon said there's no version of Dennis that would ever beat him. His current shape now. Um, that's really easy to say because we don't know, you know, but in my opinion, it's a 50 50 match. I think the Devon that we see today is a very, very strong arm wrestler, you know? And the Dennis that we saw in his peak form was a stronger human being, but not a better arm wrestler. So.
SPEAKER_01: It would be very interesting to see that if there's a way to make that happen, you know. Yeah, I agree. Anyways, Michael, it has been almost 40 minutes. You said that you are going to be for 30 minutes. I don't want to hold you. It's okay. Yeah, thank you, buddy. Yeah, and once again, congratulations. Thank you. I don't know if we should accept this as an official match or not. You know it better. But whatever we saw there, it just showed us that you are there. You know, you are there. And it will be, I mean, like,
SPEAKER_00: There is nothing to worry about it. This is what I understand. Especially whenever I saw the shoulder pressure and your bicep held it. Did you feel any pressure, any danger? Like I said, we lifted very heavy afterwards and I feel fine. So I'll do some light blood flow stuff today and then I'll be good to go. Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, thank you very much, Daniel. Thank you, Daniel Dawson. And he says, the police blocked Peter Ankor. Does he spam the same message? The guy is asking your advice about the Kings move. Just give him like one minute because he asked the same question.
SPEAKER_00: Got you. Got you. Yeah. So Kings move. The basic thing to Kings move is heightened pronation. You have to have heightened pronation and that if you can have heightened pronation, you can engage, you know, at the back of the pad, where the pad, you have to control the center table left or right. It doesn't left or right. Doesn't matter this way. It's a tug of war. If you can get back to the back of the pad, elbow planted riser pronation. It's a great defense. Okay. Okay.
SPEAKER_01: You take care of yourself. Is Paolo still there? Paolo is still there? No, he's back home already. He's back home already. Okay. Tell Rebecca we say hello. Apparently, I got to go get some cake. I got to get some cake. Yeah, get the cake and then lose the weight back. Exactly. See you in March. Frank will be my guest. All right. Take care. God bless. Take care. Bye-bye.
SPEAKER_01: how is it possible the 1148 he goes like 600 he goes again up to 1480 guys um i have this under my arm it is just this something liquid you know it just came first it came to my forehead and then here and then to to my eyes you know after the uh this uh hair transplant you know yeah let's chat a little bit more alaikum salam uh
SPEAKER_01: Okay. Not handsome, but, you know, just, I don't know. It is, I think they did a great job, you know, the line and everything, you know. It was, it was fine, you know. It was long, but Alhamdulillah, Seneca. Thank you, Carlo. How are you?
SPEAKER_01: I don't have to explain myself. You are boss. I'm not boss, my friend. I don't feel like it. Just because I'm the one who is hosting all this, it doesn't make me boss. We are just friends in our Mustang. Alaykum Salam. You want to see more videos from my prime? I don't know. There are some I can share. Thank you, Mohamed Aaron. Exciting start to see Michael Todd back and on the road to be built. Yeah, yeah. These are our
SPEAKER_01: Guys, you know, it is, I will tell you something. This is the sport that we love, right? It's arm wrestling we love. And these are our superstars, you know. It is very, very hard to raise a superstar. It is so easy to throw mud and bring them down. I mean, I'm kind of a fan of each of them. You know, they are like our heroes in arm wrestling. And just, I mean, like I see sometimes like Levan,
SPEAKER_01: just like had some problem with the breeding, you know, they make fun with him. They make fun with Devon. They made fun with Hermes. I mean, I don't think that these guys deserve to be made fun. You know, these are all very extraordinary human beings. You know, this is my honest opinion. Of course, you all decide for yourself. Will there be
SPEAKER_01: I don't think so, my friend. I don't think so. I can't even get ready for 85. What do you think about Jerry versus Görgüt? Is there no match? Make it happen?
SPEAKER_01: I will tell you honestly, it is not that easy to, I don't know, set a match for Jerry. I mean, it is not easy to even reach him. So the last thing we talk, and I think he's going to have a match on July, but Jerry has been also ill. He got cold again.
SPEAKER_01: So he couldn't really train. So what we agreed the last time was like July, July a match for him. But I'm not going to tell who. Um...
SPEAKER_01: Jerry is not a joke. Jerry is a very strong guy. Jerry is a very, very, very strong guy. Very good shoulder pressure. Trust me, these are all part of the game, you know. We need all these kind of different characters.
SPEAKER_01: and different style pullers. This is like a puzzle or chess game. Levan will be my guest. I think I will go to Georgia and just
SPEAKER_01: for interviewing and filming. Yeah. Yeah. Arsene, Arsene is getting ready. He said that, he said that in full motion, one arm bicep curl, full motion, he did like when he was in prime, like he was in 45 kilo, 10 reps. And now he's doing 40 kilo
SPEAKER_01: nine, 10 reps. So he's like around 90. Yeah, he's 90%. And he said pronation is about, I don't know, today I talked with him, maybe he said like 70, 75% pronation and wrist, like something is like, like between 70 to 90%, depending on the
SPEAKER_01: depending on the moment. And yeah, Gennady is, yeah, Gennady is a crazy guy. Gennady just, I'm telling you, arm wrestling without Gennady is like something really important, missing, you know. Gennady is one of those type that like he can talk and also walk, you know. Not many people
SPEAKER_01: Not many people can do that. Yeah. And it's just very unique character. Greg's gym. I will invite you to my gym. Greg's gym. Yeah. Greg, I'm coming. Most likely in March. I'm coming to Georgia. Yeah. I will come to your gym. This is Greg's gym. I know you. This is you are Greg, right? Kennedy's friend. I saw you from
SPEAKER_01: I don't think John is retiring. I hope not. I mean, we need him. Whenever I look at John, I see arm wrestling. Just like seriously, I look at him and like arm wrestling. I don't see someone but just arm wrestling itself. That's the fact. I also gave my life to arm wrestling, but...
SPEAKER_01: He was different, you know, this guy. Just look at him. Seriously, what do you see? I don't see anything. Teşekkür ederim, Ozan kardeşim. Sağ olasın.
SPEAKER_01: Will Engin ever come back to Norway? Anything is possible, but as you said, very busy, very busy. Yes, he's the GOAT, yeah. Who do you rank as the better top roller? Yannis Ammaros and Minda Agostin, different type of top rollers, but they both are just up there. Yeah. Yep.
SPEAKER_01: Come to India for workouts. Who knows? Ronaldo or Messi? I'm sorry, we don't know. Okay, man. I like, I mean, both are incredible pullers, but I like Ronaldo's personality even more. Will you have match with Samusha? I hope, someday. I hope. Now, I had this hair transplant and I will start
SPEAKER_01: training in march and then let's see where it will take me no no john wasn't like john was uh undefeated for 25 years like there's nothing super much in the past there was like very little super much that doesn't really make sense so much but about to say that 25 years you know and there was tournaments but like i can say that
SPEAKER_01: With a few exceptions in his weight category, I don't remember him losing. I remember him losing to Rambet in one of the Vegas tournaments. But in his own weight, I don't really remember him. Until Arsene Didier match, I don't really remember. Usually, we didn't even care when John is competing in his weight class. When I was in America, I...
SPEAKER_01: like competed many tournaments i also competed many categories seven categories eight categories five categories whatever is the level of the event you know when there is john there of course you don't just go compete his category but it depends on the level of the event but john always almost always if he is allowed he always competed just say 90 kilo 110 kilo and they're open you know john john always competed those categories sometimes we saw him having a good match
SPEAKER_01: in his category. But usually his category was not that hard for him. For many years, it was kind of boring, John winning in his category. But whenever he's also pulling multiple categories, then yeah. John is not coming to East vs. West 12. He needs to rest, but hopefully this summer. Do I think
SPEAKER_01: Hermes could crack George's wrist. We don't know. We will see. They both are confident about their own wins, but it is the beauty of Hermes. Yeah, John versus Petrenko was incredible, yeah. Oh, okay. I didn't know that. I can probably help Deniz for the
SPEAKER_01: hair transplantation, I can... No, no, I didn't offer him a match. It is Artem Taranenko asked me to have a match with Talgat. But I think I'm going to give Artem a match for sure in July event. We will see, Joe. Hopefully, I will compete again. I cannot quit this too early.
SPEAKER_01: can I beat Minda? If I'm in shape, of course I would beat him. But right now, I'm not even training, you know. Right now, I don't think I can beat him. Even if I could beat him, like, I don't think I will have endurance. Long time. Jared, there are so many great guys. Like, so many great guys. Like, I tell you, like, I'm, like,
SPEAKER_01: My blood pressure is going up whenever I try to set all these matches because I have to say no to so many athletes from Kazakhstan, Georgia, Russia, and there and there, like many, many, many. So it is almost impossible, you know, to have like 12 matches and just like have everyone.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, many of the East vs. West is going to be the same. I will explain to you why it is the same. It is because we have a ballroom. It's much bigger. We were going to do a stage right from the zero. But there are chairs. And I'm just thinking five hours on chairs, it will be very, very hard. While in auditorium, it's like a movie theater, like very relaxed seats, you understand?
SPEAKER_01: So that is why I just think that it's going to be better there. Roman, we shall set King Khali, but not too much. I want Somesha to stay undefeated, undeniable champion of 85 kilos. His flow press was insane. We have some nice Turkish food too, my friends. I...
SPEAKER_01: I, I don't know, as you know, maybe I know, I mean, I have won a few world titles as well, you know? Yeah. Hello, Salvatore. Hello to Azerbaijan AP edit.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, auditorium. Le Robe, the arm-wrestling artist. I like the auditorium. I watched East vs. West six years. I was the one drawing it from... Oh, yeah, you are that one, huh? Drawing, yeah. I remember you, yeah. Engin Hez, Alijan, ask you match at East vs. West with right arm. I offer him a right arm match. He wanted to have the left arm match.
SPEAKER_01: Um, okay. Anyway, so can anyone, can anyone beat Alijan inside left arm? Morozov maybe? I don't think I'm competing anytime soon. I'm not even training Daniel. I had this, this hair transplant thing, you know?
SPEAKER_01: Um, yeah, it would be nice, Zach. Um, anyway, so yeah, just send me a link, uh, either from Instagram or Facebook. Yeah. Um, told Paul Hutchings is not going to pull it.
SPEAKER_01: East versus West 12, but he will have a match very soon. Very soon. Can't you hire more people? You really overwork yourself. My friend, I mean, there are a lot of people also help me during the competition time, even now. And like Roman is helping with our reels and Sol is helping with our graphics.
SPEAKER_01: Anna is helping, you know, and like, there are, there are people that are helping me. Uh, but there are some things that I need to do it, you know? Um, yeah, Ongarbev is real. Ongarbev will have a, you will hear it. You will hear it. Welcome back Peter. But you know, I asked you a question, huh? Yeah. Hello, Joseph.
SPEAKER_01: Did you plan on continuing to have an exciting match? Yeah, we will have Fia Rysak versus Ekaterina Nikisheva match. It's a really important match. I don't know if you know or not, Ekaterina Nikisheva from Russia. Very, very, very, very strong lady. And Fia is also a legend. Yep, Sandrin is going to pull at 105 kilos. His match is set, but I didn't announce it for the East versus West 12th.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know what, I don't know Roy Levy. I don't know. There's nothing I think. I have my own plans. I have my own. I mean, like there are a lot of people asking like what I think about this is coming. Everyone can come, you know. I mean, everyone is free world, you know. But if you ask about the level, I mean, everything is obvious, you know. Why is there no Turk in the chat? You're the one who asked. I'm sure there are others as well.
SPEAKER_01: How, if Ali Can, because Ali Can exists, he's crazy. Yeah, Egle Barbora, yeah, he needs to help in that match as well, yeah. Thank you, Silva. I can never see the Peter guy, he's weird, not even, I don't know. Every time you ask a question to some athletes, I always record it and save it and show to my dad, only my supporter and my brother also.
SPEAKER_01: That's good. That's good. I respect you, Peter. I respect you. What weight will Michael Todd come back? 115 kilos. Hermes will 6-0 Alijan on right arm. It's not right arm match, so they will have left arm match. Yeah. I think Aldon is favorite Jennifer or Whisperer. He's heavier. He's bigger guy.
SPEAKER_01: Ah, Ali John's lift, it was 60 kilo. Today, today, Hermes showed me the video. He said, like, he showed me the video, and he's like, this is not how it is, you know. And he said, like, he can do 80 kilo that way. So, yeah. Thank you, G-R-I-M-S. Hope everything is well. Best regards. Hello to Norway. Hello to Norway, my friend. Hello.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know Dadikian's next opponent yet. Thank you, Peter. I hope we meet someday. Thank you, my friend. Tips for the new starters. Just arm wrestle as much as you can. Yeah, it's normal. He's like 18, 19 years old. Yeah, gay minx. Hermes is training his left. He's not going there to lose.
SPEAKER_01: Hermes is not going there to lose. I'm not saying he's not going to lose or he's going to win or whatever, but he's not going there. He's going there very serious. And just remember, he's getting there while he's being prepared for Denis Splenko. So Hermes will be in very, very, very good shape. Yeah, there is always something to learn, Peter. Yeah, we have...
SPEAKER_01: Oh, Thomas. Yeah, Thomas Mungy. I'm thinking about it. I didn't say anything, but I'm thinking he will be invited for sure. The Hitman. Engin is the most dedicated armwrestler of all time, according to John Brzee. Yeah, I watched it. That was the second part of what he said, yes. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Why can we not broadcast on TV, on your phones, TV, non-stop loading screen? I don't know. I thought about doing pronation with that one way, but wrapping it like doing active pronation, not just lifting and holding it.
SPEAKER_01: Now the way Adam and the Whisperer are hyping their match, it has been hilarious. Yeah, that's fun, yeah. Yeah, I think they are helping the popularity of armwrestling. I'm more of like pure armwrestling, you know, guy, pure armwrestling guy. Andrei Yakhveladze, who do you give a
SPEAKER_01: I had a dream. That's interesting that I had a dream. I was at the King of Cebu. I'm not going, but in my dream, I was there. And I saw that match, only that match I saw. And then, yeah, it's good that you reminded me. And you're welcome, three PAs. Thank you for your support. And...
SPEAKER_01: First two rounds, I saw it was not that easy. First two rounds, I saw Pacho was winning. But just dream. Halter Can Bey. Ben Rizelim, kardeşim. Yeah, he's also good. If you didn't see him being toppled by someone, just he's good at forcing in hook as well. His reach is not as long as Ivan's.
SPEAKER_01: They said, you know, next Brzezink, it is just a very big claim, you know. Like, who is ending up in the Dave Sheffield-Italy match? I mean, from outside, Italy looks favoured, but I thought that Italy was favoured last time as well. But somehow, Sheffield won. Ending of the...
SPEAKER_01: I mean, I was just thinking that Reno was favored against Bacho. Until I saw that Bacho was like 107 kilos. So...
SPEAKER_01: But when you say, Andre, I hope Engin's dream come true. It sounds like, you know, I want this. It is just a really like a dream that I had it with. So I don't have any, I don't like, I'm not supporting anyone. I'm organizer. So Sultan Otay. Assalamu alaikum, Uncle Engin. How are you? Wa alaikum salam, Sultan. Alhamdulillah, how are you? I'm from Istanbul, Turkey.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, David or Prudnik right arm. I mean, if it is, if Prudnik is healthy, I mean, kind of Prudnik beat Tata Sings kind of easier than Dadikian did. 115 kg, you mean, huh? I think he was his second, I think, Ivan Matushenko.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, that is our guess. If hutching is stronger than dead time or not, it's just like, we don't know. Maybe yes, maybe no, I don't know.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know who Levan is going to pull. He needs to focus on his match right now. Yes, yes, he is going to defend, yeah. What do I think about the Toz match? Like, what do you mean?
SPEAKER_01: Like towards which match? Are you talking about the match that just happened against Paulo? I'm going to bring Levan and Devon to the podcast for sure. I mean, I have done a lot of things to help my elbows.
SPEAKER_01: I tried all kinds of things. I don't know exactly. I mean, it's still injured, so I really don't know what would help. Thank you, Brian. Thank you. Thank you, my friend. I don't have any, I mean, all the only regret that when I had the elbow injury and surgery,
SPEAKER_01: I mean, after the surgery, I didn't take enough time. It didn't go well. It became chronic. And then for many years I could just rest, but I just push it, push it, push it, push it, push it. Yeah. And we invited him, but he never was available. Even, even like not long ago, a few weeks ago, one of our common friends reached him. He said that he wasn't available.
SPEAKER_01: I mentioned Turkish comments as well, you know. Just don't be troublemaker if you want to be part of this. Oh, you mean the operation, this one? Yeah, I mean, it was, yeah, it was nice. It was like, not easy, but...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, Devon has chance. I mean, I'm not denying that Levon is favorite on the paper, but that is all about just one good stop, you know, one good stop. Things like whenever I was saying the same thing against, like, about the Hermes versus Devon match, and I was saying Devon has chance against Hermes. You were like, oh, did you see his bicep size? Did you see how much he lift? Yeah, I mean, Hermes is incredible. But I said there is a chance.
SPEAKER_01: And then it happened exactly as I talked. So this time, Levan has better, stronger wrist than Hermes. But there is always possibility that, you know, he may go and then stop somewhere. But who is favorite? Levan is favorite. I can say 60% probably favorites. But we don't know what kind of shape he's going to bring. We don't know how good his wrist recovers. Levan, so many things, you know.
SPEAKER_01: You're welcome, Ilya. You're welcome. Yeah, Ivan Kozlich. One pin, all he needs. But just when that is going to happen. See, when Hermes found it, it was already too late. It was already 4-0. Guys, if I'm ignoring some of your questions, and if you're asking, it means that you're looking for trouble. No need, you know. Just if you're asking,
SPEAKER_01: I'm ignoring, just no need to repeat it, you know, because it is becoming like, you know, annoying, you know, no need, you know. Ah, there is another one. Just even want to go there. .
SPEAKER_01: I'm the one who brings it the most, but the first one to bring it is Haydar.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, I'm not saying about every question, but just sometimes, you know, there are some questions just, just to like cause trouble, you know, I can see that and they know themselves as well. So no need, you know, just like have a friendly chat, you know, I'm happy to spend time with you.
SPEAKER_01: Are you joining Neil Fix? Oh, Neil has a fix? Did he announce? Okay. Engi, when Levan recently did heavy bicep workout, his right wrist was cracking back. I don't know. I didn't really know, but he is very, very strong.
SPEAKER_01: Engin, do you think there is a future of East versus West every month? For me, that would be paradise. My friend, it would be great as well, but do you think that there is enough interest for that? My forearm is getting smaller because no training. But still, not too small. Not too small. How can we join East versus West team or help
SPEAKER_01: with the production and ideas. I don't know how. Thank you for your work. You're welcome, my friend. Thank you for your support. And how long? It has been more than one hour. I mean, this is small compared to I know what it can be.
SPEAKER_01: Engin, why didn't you put Alain Zolaev instead of Arthur Makarov, my friend? Almost one year, probably 300 times I repeated that Alain Zolaev is studying in a military school in Russia and he cannot travel outside of Russia for now. Ekginlik will be at Green Park Hotel, Pendik, Green Park Hotel. Good luck, my brother. Good luck.
SPEAKER_01: What do you think about you versus Clement next match? I don't think I'm getting ready. Engin is starting to get those pulling traps, though. I mean, I always hit the trapezes, but I don't know. I'm not that... I don't know. But you will see me in good shape. That's the plan. After this...
SPEAKER_01: The hair transplanting, everything goes. Beginning of March, I start training. And diet, cardio, lifting. And let's see. Sandris is going to put right arm. I don't think it's a good idea to put two Georgians, Irakli and Bacho, unless it's a title match. Um...
SPEAKER_01: Stem cell. Stem cell, you need to contact white cell. White cell, or you reach me privately and I will give you the connection. I mean, like you, Cera, you believe or not, but I was really beating Arthur. People think that Arthur injured me, but it was not really like that.
SPEAKER_01: I really was beating him. He knows also. He also told me, Engin, you beat me. You were the winner. I know that you were going to win. And of course, it's no excuse. But the thing is, when you are losing, then it is kind of shameless. Kind of shameless. I would feel to ask another match. Because technically, he won, even though I was injured.
SPEAKER_01: Do I have any... Anyways guys, if you don't have any interesting thing, let me go.
SPEAKER_01: And so it is 12.30 here. No, I don't think I can go down to 75, Marius. I hope I can go down to 85. I don't think that Prudnik was like same as Devon. He was just like a little bit like this. I mean, yeah, he lifted, but I'm not sure if he lifted.
SPEAKER_01: Andrea saying, Engin, Arsene is looking pretty good. Have you still not found an opponent? I mean, there is someone in my mind, but he has a super match. If he loses, then I don't know. Slide. Yeah, we may see Devon going 105. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Devon is crazy. Probably he cannot make 95, but 105, if he wants, he can do it. I think he would do such thing only if he beats Levan, and then he may try to have professional world titles in three different categories. How about Paolo Pularsen if he beats Grandi?
SPEAKER_01: Robert, Engin, I think you can make 88 kg and water cut 85. Yeah, possible. You're right. Yeah. Good night. Good night. Good night, brother. Who can do 75? I don't think I can. I mean, listen, I can. I can even make 70 kilos, but I don't feel like I need to push myself. Marius, I don't know what Devon is planning.
SPEAKER_01: Devon, Devon, he may be planning many things. Yeah, yeah. Opana match. Gennady versus Devon match needs to happen regardless the result of Levan versus Devon match. Yeah, Şanlar Mustafa, kardeşim. Did I say something stupid? I don't know what you said. I don't even remember. I'm kind of tired. Um...
SPEAKER_01: feels like he should give Levan a rematch if he wins. But still can't blame him. No. If Levan somehow beats Levan, there needs to be a third match for sure. Right now, in my opinion, this is the biggest match in the history. But if they are 1-1, then that match will be the third match will be the biggest one.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, it's not that important, Roy Lewary. I mean, it's not important second or third, you know. When Arthur pulled last time the Walls in 75 kilos, Alan was first and Arthur was second.
SPEAKER_01: Anyways, guys, I think probably Neil Pickup is starting his thing. I don't want to comment publicly about Sherkasov, but there are reasons. Anyways, so you all take care, guys, and see you guys next time.
SPEAKER_01: Good night. Good night, guys. Take care. No, I'm not joining Neil's stream, but he has a regular program at this hour, so I don't think it is the right thing to do live while he's live. You all take care.
