SPEAKER_03: I'm training very good now. You do? Yes, yesterday with Svetko Fevin. You sent me the video with Golemano. Golemano looked great, but probably Georgi Svetko was a little bit tired. Yes, of course. If he sees fresh...
SPEAKER_03: Or without strap, even if he's tired, he opened the wrist of Golemanov easy. Yeah, but he's incredible. He's very strong. Just wait one second, I'm coming. Okay, okay.
SPEAKER_03: yeah maybe you you reach to sascha so that he wouldn't i will check it i will check just a second
SPEAKER_03: This is a very big match, very big historical match. Oh yeah, it will be great. I think Irakli is in very good shape now. Three years ago when they pulled, you were there, right? In Istanbul you were. I was there, yeah. First round Irakli won, but later...
SPEAKER_03: sasha sasha is interesting guy it starts with the hook once he exhausts the opponent then he he goes out to top row yeah you you see the match with um yeah you are again i don't know why i don't know he was okay it was okay now no i don't know why it's now now i turn my phone like how you want it you know it's but it's
SPEAKER_03: Maybe, maybe you touch somewhere, you know, probably probably because I tried to Yeah, I was okay. You just touch somewhere. It was okay. And then yeah, you're here again. But I don't hear you now. Oh, it's okay. Yeah, yeah. Now it's okay. Yes.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, there are a lot of friends. Mark, Adnan, Meladze, Joel, this name I can't reach. Paul Strang, hello, my friend. Paul, Paul, Hutchings, Devon, hey, there, okay, okay, it's not that. Steezy, hello, Steezy.

SPEAKER_03: Bojidar will come with me also and Nedelin Hristov. And Veniamin Dimitrov, if you know him, brother of Dimitrina Dimitrova. He's good. Yeah, he's also have some titles in the World Championships. But like a junior still. He's got 75 kilos, he's not bad. I cannot.
SPEAKER_03: I cannot believe how strong Dimitrina is. She doesn't look super big, you know, she looks thin. Not so much muscles, yeah, but very strong. Also very smart. I think it's because also her teacher is very good. Her coach is Krasimir, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. She trained with Krasimir. You know, he's
SPEAKER_03: It's difficult if you're training with somebody who is so strong. The difference between Dimitri and Krasimir is too much. Sometimes when I train, I train with somebody who is closer to me, maybe stronger but closer, and it's good. But if I train with somebody who is strong, it's very difficult to make good training. Only if your opponent is intelligent enough to know what to do exactly.
SPEAKER_03: guys there are six minutes uh for sasho and iraqi to come uh haristo came early i saw that he was already with zoom so i just started the live so maybe some of you would be interested to watch yeah so oh yeah wow your buster was already big but your forearm looks incredible
SPEAKER_03: i i training every day every day very good training even i'm feel i'm closer to make some injury you know so much training and i am already 76 kilo you know only one kilo you need to yeah yeah i'm ready i eat normally not so probably without water cut i will be 75.
SPEAKER_03: maybe you would you would miss one meal or something in the evening and the next morning you don't have the breakfast yeah that's good do you do you plan to do you plan to compete the finals in istanbul um maybe i don't know i i'm i'm not sure first of all i must to see what i can do in kalinaka because when you go there do you plan like to be qualified for istanbul
SPEAKER_03: Or is it only just to have fun and compete? I want to try, because I still have some opponents who I want to beat. I wonder who will be coming. I have the full list of the Florida finals, but I don't have the full list of the Europeans.
SPEAKER_03: I think some team will come from South Africa. And then now we had the, in the Philippines, there was qualification. And then I think in Europe we have now Luxembourg, Italy, Switzerland, and Latvia, Czech Republic, Hungary. And I don't know if I'm missing if Germany will be, there will be one in Germany in May. Right. I have very soon. I have much in Germany.
SPEAKER_03: If you heard about it. No, with who? You don't know? With Coach Ray on the right hand. Are you serious? Yeah. When is it? May 25th? Like a category? In 27th. 27th of April. Oh, April 27th. I wonder which event is it. That is Armhovec.
SPEAKER_03: Because there will be one German Open. There will be East versus West qualification. No, this is... This is 2015. Yeah, it's not out yet, but... That will be in Frankfurt in 27. And I... I think 2015. Oh, yours is 27, though? Apple, where?
SPEAKER_03: In Frankfurt. The problem is Ray will be a little bit heavier because if he competes in the European Championship, probably he will be 86 or 87 kilos. I will be 75 for sure.
SPEAKER_03: Because if I qualify for the national championship, I will go into the European in 75 kilos. You can't be in the European, right? Yeah, I won't. I think Yusuf is in your category this year. 75? He will be 75? Yeah, Yusuf and Daniel Prokopchuk, I think. Yeah, great, great.
SPEAKER_03: It's interesting, Mindaugas will go 70 again or will go 75? Mindaugas may not be competing, I'm not sure. Sasha came, I think, let me see. Yeah, I think Sasha is trying to connect, yeah. Our nationals is in...
SPEAKER_03: 13 and 14 of april yeah april is will be strong uh strong month you know yeah yeah yeah yeah usually that's how it happens you know those nationals usually march in april and then europeans usually in may all the march i make a good after pulling because i referring for serbian national croatian national and tomorrow i go to romanian nationals
SPEAKER_03: Hello, Sasho. Hello, I don't know. Sasho left, I think. Hello, Irakli. Hello, my friend. Hello. Hello, Irakli. Good. That's good. How is everything, Irakli? What's your weight? 99, 98. Irakli, you don't have David Arobli with you, right?
SPEAKER_03: No? Roman? David, David. Oh, one second.
SPEAKER_03: One second. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, why is Sasha not here? Do you know? I will check it, I will check. He is here, say he is here. Okay, so problem with camera or? No, no, wait a second. Turn the camera down. I hope I haven't used it before.
SPEAKER_03: Is it okay with the phone? Rotating?
SPEAKER_03: We can start, yeah. Hi Engin, hi Irakli. Hello, hello Sasho. There is a small misunderstanding. I thought that David would be with Irakli but Irakli expected me to bring Roman and now we don't have neither of them but I will wait. Is there anyone
SPEAKER_03: in the chat. Who knows Georgian, yeah? Probably you know already. You know the words or not? One second. I will fix the problem, hopefully. I have three alternatives. I hope one of them works. You can use Levano also.
SPEAKER_03: Because English is already good, you know. Yes, yes, yes. Before two years it was different, but now it's... Vako, do you have short time to help Irakli with translation, podcast? Tornike, but...
SPEAKER_03: Oh, it's now happening. I thought he was going to bring David Arabuli and he thought that I was going to bring Roman and then neither of them here. Okay. Okay, let's start together with you guys.
SPEAKER_03: Irakli, the translator is coming. For now, wait. We will start with Sasho. So, how are you, Sasho? Good? Yes, I think I feel good. You feel good? Are you in better shape than when you competed against John Bersink? I don't know. I don't know. Almost probably the same? I had some time for preparation.
SPEAKER_03: He said he didn't have enough time for preparation, but he feels good. He thinks he will be good. Oh, I thought he was already getting ready for the European championships. He's ready all the time. So he's ready all the time. Okay.
SPEAKER_03: He said, now it's time for our nationals, but he didn't prepare so much for the nationals. For the European Championship, we still have a time. Yeah, but between the East versus West and Europeans, only like 20 days. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. But whenever I talked with you, I wanted to set this match for the July. You said Sasha wants April 11th. Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: He said he started preparing for the European slowly because he didn't have time.
SPEAKER_03: uh after when he realized he was competing he already started training and for to the 20th of april he will have one full month with training and that is enough for him he say he say if he knows
SPEAKER_03: earlier he will preparing earlier he will be stronger it's very strange because it's when i told him to make much later he say why it's uh we have time uh why it's not now it's too late but when you have much earlier he'd say oh why so so earlier i want later i don't know he he has this is a complicate because his job
SPEAKER_03: So, does it mean that he will not be ready? Oh, no, for sure that doesn't mean that. You will be ready, right, Sasha? I think I will be ready. Hopefully, okay. For sure, we will see. And...
SPEAKER_03: he say for sure he will will not be 95 kilo uh for this time but he is 90 now 90 so he will be probably 93. no he will be probably he will be 91 or something you know he cannot gain so much weights for these days but i i think the weight is not so important if it's not um how i say
SPEAKER_03: it's not enough to be fat you know it's you must to be so in this kill and you cannot gain muscle so so fast and how does he see this match how do you see the difficulty level
SPEAKER_02: He said for sure, Irakli is in a different level now. He is stronger.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, he's stronger because of his matches, what he has been after that. But then Sasho also is different level. And even if he has some break to relax and not preparing good, he's still better level of two years ago. Yeah, 2021.
SPEAKER_03: He was 86-87 kg when he was competing with Irakli in the first match. I think he was lighter than he is now. Irakli was lighter. I think he was 90 kg when they were competing. Yeah, Irakli was 90 kg. Is it possible, Sasho, for you to turn your phone sideways?
SPEAKER_03: Like this? Yeah. Yeah, thank you. And so you are saying that you believe both of you are in better shape right now? For sure, and Irakli must take revenge.
SPEAKER_03: And Sasho must keep his title. Yep. Yep. And this, this will be his third title match, right? He's not sure, but. Pauline, Pauline, John Burzink and Irakli. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, exactly. Tornike is coming, Tornike. Okay. Yeah, for translation. This is what Vako told me. Yeah. And so let's continue talking. And Sasho, how do you see this category?
SPEAKER_03: If Tata Sings comes down to 95 kilo, will it be hard for all of you? I think that you both have lost against Tata. You lost against him in Moldova.
SPEAKER_03: And you lost against him in a super match at the East versus West. So I am, uh, this first time I'm, uh, saying this year announcing in August, uh, East versus West in Orlando, uh, there will be a match between Tata Shinks and Rustam Babaev in 95 kilo. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Sasho, you are asking how do you think this category will be, 95, if Todd Hutchins drops to 95, because he has also beaten you in Moldova and Heraklina against West. And what he actually announced is that now in Orlando, when it will be against West, Hutchins will play against Rustam Babaev. For the first time he announces this thing.
SPEAKER_02: And how do you think it will be if Hutchins goes down to 95 kg? It depends. In my opinion, we are on a different level. Back then in Moldova it was very bad. I had absolutely no preparation. I trained for about a week. And yet...
SPEAKER_02: I made good matches, but then it's clear to me that I didn't make good matches because I had a super long meeting with Krasimirov. You played with Krasimirov before that, right? Yes, and two minutes after that there was a match with Hutchings and nothing happened. Sasho said, first of all, in Moldova when they were competing,
SPEAKER_03: He wasn't prepared. He trained only one week. Also, he didn't count this match with Hutchins in Moldova because the match was after his Krasi match. They made a very long match in hook with Krasi and they were very close. Two minutes after that, he played with Hutchins. That's the reason he didn't count this. For sure, he said...
SPEAKER_03: It depends what shape is Hutchings and what shape is Sashu will be good match for sure. Yeah, but is he waiting for that match? Yeah, yeah, he won't. He won't this match. He won't. And do you know that this is in August? Rustam Babayev, Todd Hutchings will be in August. And then Todd Hutchings will also pull in July. But Todd Hutchings will pull in August in 95kg. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: In July, he will be pulling in 105, but it is not 105, he is only 100 kg. So all he needs to lose is 5 kg, not 10 kg. But in July, do you know who his opponent is? No. Krasimir Kostadino. In August, in Orlando, until 1995, he will play with Babaev Hachins.
SPEAKER_03: And then he will play up to 105 kg, but he will weigh up to 100 kg, not more. He only lost 5 kg. He will play up to 100 kg with Krasi in August. Did you know that? No. It's interesting, Sasho doesn't know this.
SPEAKER_03: It's very interesting. Sasho doesn't know this, but he's from the same city and sometimes training with Krassi. Do you know why? Do you know why? Because we finalized today. Aha. Oh, good. Yeah, I finalized this match today. Both of them happened today. Oh, nice. We have great news. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It will be incredible. Yeah. Let's see.
SPEAKER_03: I can't believe why these people, not David Arabuli, not Roman, not Tornike, but Tornike, let me call Tornike, how far he is.
SPEAKER_03: We can start speaking some English and Russian, but the problem is... Does Irakli speak Russian any? Irakli speaks very small and Russian and English. Maybe his English and Russian is the same. But Irakli can flex bicep, that's enough also. Until he comes,
SPEAKER_03: Melazze, check your WhatsApp. Melazze, check your WhatsApp until he comes. Let's see who came. Oh, Tornike. I'm in a bus. We'll try to make it bus. OK, Melazze, you join now until Tornike comes. When Tornike comes.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I sent the malazze, malazze. We will see. At least he knows some better. Irakli, forget about English. You're going to beat this guy? You will beat Sasho? Yes? Yes, yes. Yeah. Yeah, it's just I like to stir the pot. I need to provoke the guy, provocation. As the organizer, it's my job.
SPEAKER_03: Yes, but none of us is Devon to provoke us. He says that not only Sashu and Irakli, they are not Devon. We are from the other side of the world. What does it mean? It's easy to provoke Devon to make something. Sashu and Irakli, they were not that type.
SPEAKER_03: Listen, it is not easy to provoke Devon. Devon is the one that he provokes people. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I think it is even easier to provoke the Eastern guys because their culture is not used to this part. And when somebody is like doing this kind of thing, they get angry. You understand? They don't like to trash talk so much. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, I hope Melazi is coming, I send you. He says he is nervous. No, don't be nervous, Melazi, just come. Hurry, hurry before Irakli gets angry with us. So I have a question for you, Sasho. You, I see, you pull with Rob Visions, you pull with John inside, you pull with Irakli inside.
SPEAKER_03: and then in the last rounds you start top rolling at the end. Is it something that you choose after your opponent is exhausted or you try sometimes fresh as well? Yes, I understood it. I had a very big injury before this match on my neck, which is related to my injury.
SPEAKER_02: Hello. Hello. Hello, guys. Oh, hello, Engin. How are you? Hello, hello. Hello, Sasho. Hello. Go ahead, Sasho. Continue. Sasho,
SPEAKER_03: Before this match he had some injury here in the chest and he didn't have good side pressure but he felt good with the grip and stabbing with the hand and that's the reason he's
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but at the beginning of the rounds he continues like he wins this way, this way and then at the end. Which match are you talking about?
SPEAKER_03: Sasha, speak about the match with RBG. Oh, yeah. You speak about this match?
SPEAKER_03: No, generally, he did the same thing with John Mesh, he did the same thing with Irakli Mesh in Istanbul, last round he top rolled. John, last round, he went outside. Ravijan, he went outside, the last rounds, he went outside, you know. He says that with all your last matches, you start from the inside and you take your last matches from above.
SPEAKER_02: Why are you doing this? Because you feel that your opponents are tired of you or for some other reason? Quite often, in my effort to gather my hands, I only give myself the rotation, which is a very big mistake and gradually with the matches I do it.
SPEAKER_03: he say very often because of because he wants to be very closer to his his arm closer to his body and he lose his rotation and but when the match should continue he feel better and he takes his rotation better and he's staying stable and better on the table too much
SPEAKER_03: he wants he wants to play something like in the middle we know with control top row but because forward he going inside and he turned his rotation and that's the reason in the beginning he's going inside yeah iraqli now we have a translator and we can start um
SPEAKER_03: Three years ago, you lost against Tasha. You won the first round and then you lost next four rounds. Since then, you have been competing a lot and you are doing great. Now, three years later, now this is a world title match. I don't think any title right now on this earth is heavier than the East versus West world title. I personally believe only East versus West and WAF. WAF is the amateur one. How ready are you?
SPEAKER_03: Yes, this is exactly what I wanted to say, Sasha, when I came here. I wanted to say that my heart is with you, and I want to tell you that I love you. But when you say that I love you, it means that I love you too, and it means that I love you too. So, I wanted to say that I have been working with you for three years.
SPEAKER_03: It means that, as you said,
SPEAKER_03: Wafi and his team are at a very high level in this regard. I think you will be one of the best players in this match. How do you feel about this match? Yes, I'm very happy to be here.
SPEAKER_04: It actually say,
SPEAKER_03: Imagine, when I was three years old, after this he trained a lot and he made very big progress.
SPEAKER_03: And now I have a big chance to become world champion in East-West. And now I'm preparing a lot to become champion. What do you say? And how does he see his chances?
SPEAKER_03: Irakli says, in my mind I have the biggest chance, but now I say 50-50. Okay, in his mind he has very big chance, but he says 50-50? Yes. Yeah, but after he said what is in his mind, you know, why would we take what he says seriously? Yes, but he says 50-50, I say this. Okay, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: And Stasio, how do you see your chances against Irakli? I think it's a big chance. It's harder to stay at the top, because everyone is training and fighting how to become a champion.
SPEAKER_03: He said if he accepts this match, that means he believes he has a bigger chance to win. He said the most difficult is to keep the title because everybody pretends to take his title, but he believes he will win.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, does it mean that if someday if he believes that somebody has more chance, he's not going to accept the match in 95kg? He will just sit at home with the title and hold it? I don't understand. Do you ask if this means that if there is someone who you believe will beat you and take the title, you won't accept the match? I don't believe that anyone can.
SPEAKER_03: He didn't believe somebody can take his title. If somebody takes his title, that will be because he is not prepared for something, he is not ready. So he believes that he is invincible, nobody can beat him? Yes, yes. Oh, that's good, that's good mindset. Can you translate it to Iraqi? That he thinks that he is invincible, nobody can beat him?
SPEAKER_03: As I said before, it depends on how you want to perform and how you want to give your chances. If I am in this position, I will have a lot of chances.
SPEAKER_03: When I heard the title of the song, I thought it was going to be a champion. And now I know that this song is going to be a champion. That's why I'm so happy to be here.
SPEAKER_03: I don't know if it was your fault or if you were like, what did I do wrong? What did I do wrong? I don't know.
SPEAKER_03: Was it that long, Meladze? Was it really that long? I feel like we talked like 20 seconds. You translated like three minutes. Engin, you know I'm wearing arrows because all of this, you are legends. Yeah, it's okay. It's okay. Someday you will be legend as well. Don't worry about it. We are just like you, no difference. Okay, what's Iraqi's answer?
SPEAKER_03: The question is Sasho thinks he is invincible. What does he think about it? Sasho, you said you are invincible. What do you think about it? I am not sure if I am invincible. I am not sure if I am invincible. I am not sure if I am invincible. I am not sure if I am invincible. I am not sure if I am invincible. I am not sure if I am invincible.
SPEAKER_03: Irakli say in 20 April Sasho Mines is charging because Irakli beats him and he become champion. What he say? Okay, he says that in on April 20th Sasho will change his mind because he will beat him? Yes, yes. Okay, so yeah, but Sasho says that if he loses it is only because he is not well prepared.
SPEAKER_03: Sash, if I were you, I wouldn't be in this position. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
SPEAKER_03: And I will do my best in 2018. You heard that special? He said that he's just is the strongest in 95. He's a favorite. But we'll see he's strongest. What's that?
SPEAKER_03: He'd say, yeah, Irakli is strong, but we will see he's strongest or not. We will see in the match, in the table. Table show us.
SPEAKER_03: who is the strongest in the table. Irakli, do you have any negative memory playing in your head that makes you doubt yourself because of what happened three years ago? No, I don't have any negative memories in my head because of what happened three years ago. No, I don't have any negative memories in my head because of what happened three years ago. No, I don't have any negative memories in my head because of what happened three years ago.
SPEAKER_03: When I see this video, when I lose with Sasho, I have a very big motivation to take revenge. Revenge, okay. Yes, yes. I have a great motivation now. Yeah. So, Irakli is burning with fire. Fire, yes. Revenge, revenge match. Okay. Yes, yes. Sasho, are you in trouble?
SPEAKER_03: I don't think he's in trouble, just he must keep paying attention about the title. He must save his title, that's all. Okay, okay. And Sasha, another question. Irakli is normally 100 kilos.
SPEAKER_03: and he is coming down to 95 kilo but sometimes he pulls 105 so his weight is in between 105 and 95 while your weight is 90 kilo and you pull 95 kilo do you sometimes is it possible at all to go two titles 85 and 95 or impossible? Do you understand Sasha? He says that Irakli plays
SPEAKER_03: 105kg and 95kg and it varies. It weighs about 100kg and goes up to 105kg or goes down to 95kg. And you are 90kg. No, no, this is a question for you. You are 90kg and for example you are playing at 95kg. Is it possible for you to go down to 85kg and play title match at 85kg?
SPEAKER_02: As a whole, I think I'll go up to 95, just slowly, and I need months. In time, would it be interesting for you to play at 85? Yes, but not at 95, I said.
SPEAKER_02: He said he's not interested in going 85 because he's
SPEAKER_03: 89 90 kilo and when he start training good and good shape he going 91 92 kilo and still like his belly that what he say he's say his belly is not like a some bodybuilder but he still like his belly yeah yeah so he is only focused on 95 kilo but not 105 kilo right under five kilo is too too too heavy and a story pet machine
SPEAKER_03: He said if he is 95 kg for him, it will be good to play 105 kg. If he gains 5 kg for him, it will be good to go and
SPEAKER_03: It depends if he gained this kilo like a fat, he will be not strong, but if he is 95 kilo muscle, he will accept some matches in 105 kilo.
SPEAKER_03: I understand, I understand. So two categories, 95 when he is 90, even 90 kg, but if he is 95 kg, he can also pull 105 kg. Yes, yes, yes. Does it depend on opponent or he would pull against anyone if he is 95 kg?
SPEAKER_02: Of course, he will do it with somebody who is stronger.
SPEAKER_03: And if it's some title match, of course, he will try it. He won't. But he cannot say now because he wants to win against Irakli. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: He say you promised him to competing with Hutchins and he can't competing with him if Hutchins is 105 kilo and Sasho is 95. For him it's not problem, of course. Yeah, but in August Hutchins will pull 95 kilo against Rustam.
SPEAKER_03: And so he's already coming to that category. Because if Hutchings pulls Tasho, he would come for the title. If it's 105-0, right now the title owner is Dadikian. So I don't think that Hutchings would want to pull that match in 105. If Hutchings comes to Tasho or Irakli, he needs to be in 95. Irakli, you also have some revenge problem with Todd Hutchings as well?
SPEAKER_03: What kind of problems do you have? What do you want to say? I want to say that I want to revenge everyone who I ever lose. I'm preparing to revenge everyone.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, that's good. That's good. That's great, yeah. Let's see. He's trying hard. He's trying hard, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yes, Irakli. Irakli, how do you see this match? You are... Like, we don't see you losing against hook pullers since you lost against Sasho. Since Sasho match, I don't remember you lost against a hook puller.
SPEAKER_03: Am I right? First of all, I would like to say that you don't want to kill him, but you want to kill him. How do you feel right now? How do you feel right now? How do you feel right now? How do you feel right now? How do you feel right now? How do you feel right now?
SPEAKER_03: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
SPEAKER_03: When I was preparing last time with Sasho, my level is different. And my level now is very different. I'm very stronger now. I'm preparing very good. And with the hook pullers, anyone can... How to say?
SPEAKER_03: move in inside yeah yeah yes inside and uh this time i see very easy i can win very easy um what's he saying he says that right now this time he's gonna win very easily but whenever i ask him the match he says 50 50 correct yes yes his mind like
SPEAKER_03: And Sasho, this guy Irakli, remember his match against Krasimir and his match against Pauline, his match against Rustam Bavev. All these are very good hook-in abilities, you guys. And Irakli's performance, does it, like,
SPEAKER_03: make you concerned you know that this guy is now different level against the hook pullers because whenever he loses usually he loses against apples he lost against dadika he lost against ongar babe but against the hook pullers he was very very uh effective
SPEAKER_03: So he says, because Herakles against all those he has played and won... Yes, yes, but everyone has a different game, even though from the inside. Yes, everyone who plays from the inside, he easily manages to beat them, and loses only those who play from above. Yes, I think that the games from the inside of everyone are different.
SPEAKER_02: So you were playing from the inside, you were kicking him out. Yes, but judging by the control Brezenk gave him, the match was pretty easy for me. I don't know what form he was in, but... But you would have knocked him down in Brezenk. Yes, but the match with the match is completely different.
SPEAKER_03: So I should say it's a hook, the game hook, it's different of the different opponents. Everybody going inside for a different way. You cannot say it doesn't matter he's good with the players, every hook is different. And he thinking when he watched his match with Brzenk, Brzenk had good control.
SPEAKER_03: and Sasho thinking about his match with Brzenk and he say Sasho control the match with Brzenk better better better compared to to Irakli Irakli goes outside Sasho went inside so it's normal because Irakli attack John's hand Sasho attack John's inside also Irakli pull against 105 kilo John
SPEAKER_03: Sasho pulled against 95kg John. That was the big difference because the last 5kg that John lost totally took his power. Yeah, but we cannot take it away. Sasho won fair and square. Sasho won deservingly, but it's hard to compare. Sasho went inside and outside. Irakli went outside, he lost his wrist.
SPEAKER_03: And he went with Dedres, yeah. But I understand. But what I'm just saying that those guys, Rustam, Paul, Grasimir, also very good in hook. Do you think, Sasho, you think that whenever I see you, like your wrist is more powerful to not to lose here. Here is strong, but to not to lose here even more strong.
SPEAKER_03: you agree with that like you are not like this but you are like this and you know like whenever his wrist is straight it is i i don't remember his wrist being bent like this yes yeah it's
SPEAKER_03: Sasha, there is a saying that your whip is not so strong during the attack, but rather during the defense, when you spin it, when you kick it from the inside, and no one remembers you taking the whip in such a way. That is, you stand in one position, but you don't bend the whip, but you sit on the side and resist. Which is so, in principle.
SPEAKER_02: I personally give it to the fact that your fingers are a little longer here, your hands are a little bigger, let's say, than on your head. My head is bigger than my fingers. This is true, yes, but they are still different games. And I think Sam is much better.
SPEAKER_02: The rotation, where do you get it? Do you get it when you turn? Where did we talk about it earlier? You try to turn, you give the rotation and that's it.
SPEAKER_03: He said now he feels his cupping is better because he does the cupping better with rotation, with his pronation staying strong. Because usually he makes cupping but he loses his rotation. And now rotation is good and he has good cupping. It's not that I lose it, it's that I give it back, which is almost always my fault.
SPEAKER_03: almost every time it's uh he gives his rotation alone you know i thought that he was giving that intentionally just to make sure that he was here you know because when you keep the formation when you keep the pronation you cannot put pressure here like once you supinate then you have to give up your i mean if you are in fully supination because that most his power is coming from here if you hold
SPEAKER_03: and he hits like this so once he doesn't penetrate anymore and keeps his pronated now his wrist will have more pressure so it means he must be trusting his wrist right now more than before that what that what he say he says now his wrist is stronger without give his uh rotation you know he's strong here okay i i thought that he was just doing that intentionally just to you know put pressure on the opponents
SPEAKER_03: pronator with this right you know he do it potentially but uh he realized he lose he lose pronation and he's he he realized that his mistake because he lose a lot of uh of this side you know yeah that is what made him dangerous as well all those times you know because he was not only putting his wrist but he was also putting so much pressure on the pronator like to control openness pronator only with the wrist is yeah good but whenever you also put the
SPEAKER_03: The side pressure with the supination grip is very effective, yeah. We will see. We will see. Very, very interesting, you know. And Irakli, what do you think about Sasho's wrist? Not super in this curling, but very strong for not losing the wrist. Like for me, I'm an outside puller. Pulling someone like Sasho, try to top roll him is...
SPEAKER_03: almost impossible, you know. So what do you think, Irakli, about this risk? Will you try to top roll him or will you try to go sideways? Or you want to keep it as a secret?
SPEAKER_03: I want to ask you, what do you think about the fact that you are competing with other hookers in Iraq, like Ahtimir and Rustam? How do you feel? I think that everyone is very good at hook. I think that there is a problem in the team, that the composition and rotation are not good.
SPEAKER_03: I think that this problem has been solved, and now my experience is worse than the previous one. Now I can say this, what do you think of Sasha's experience? What do you think of her? For me, for example, my experience is very different.
SPEAKER_03: Nesegio, for me, for example, when I don't want to say that I'm going to die, I'm going to die. What do you think about that?
SPEAKER_03: I think that in this era, in this category, in this new category, there is no doubt that Sasho is a great player. But there is no doubt that he is one of the best players in the world.
SPEAKER_04: I think it's a very, very strong match, and I think it's interesting for everyone to see how it works. I think it's interesting for everyone to see how it works. I think it's interesting for everyone to see how it works.
SPEAKER_03: uh it actually say sasha have a very uh very powerful wrist in 95 category and 105 category uh i i believe uh anyone uh
SPEAKER_03: have a like Sasho wrist power, you understand Engin? And he say, every match I was tested myself to, can I break wrist hook pullers, what he say. I tested myself to top row hook pullers, what he say, yes. And...
SPEAKER_03: He thinks he can control this match. Yes, I understand. Before the conversation, he does some weights just to pump his arms or all the time his arm is so big?
SPEAKER_03: No, Irakli doesn't train there. Irakli looks like he is intimidated. Are you intimidated by Irakli's biceps, Sasho? Sasho, are you worried about Irakli's biceps? No, I'm just saying that I'm surprised. I didn't say it out of worry, just to break the conversation a bit.
SPEAKER_03: No, he he he say he doesn't care of these hours, but just he sees his vans is just pump it, you know, and he just wants to. To put some funny things in the conversation. I know, I know, I know. I'm also all the time teasing him. Just just a joke, you know, because they both are relaxed. I try to make them a little bit nervous, but so far I'm unsuccessful. So what can I do? Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Another thing before we start the predictions quickly. Did Irakli deserve this title match, Sasho? Because whenever I offer you this first match, you said you beat him three years ago. But now after that, he beat Rustam, he beat Pauline in 95 kilos. Did he finally deserve this title match?
SPEAKER_03: Do you think that Irakli deserves this title match? Because a few times you didn't want to play this match, because you said that you already lost it, you wanted to play with Kacens and so on. But do you think that now he deserves this title match? Yes, these answers were for my plans with other matches and to upgrade the category.
SPEAKER_02: He said for sure he deserved. He didn't accept this before that because he wants to prepare for Hutchins or for somebody else.
SPEAKER_03: But actually, the great matches, what he made with Krasi and with all of the, with Pauline, you know, he deserved this. He deserved, yeah. Yeah. That's good. That's good, yeah. Because he makes amazing matches, of course. Yes, yes. It will be incredible. I just, people, maybe they don't understand, but historically, this is a very high-level match. Very high-level match. And we will see. Let's start talking.
SPEAKER_03: quickly quickly i don't want to take your time so much but uh about can i translate hanging yeah
SPEAKER_03: I would like to ask you, Sashon, why did you choose to do this? I would like to ask you, Sashon, why did you choose to do this?
SPEAKER_03: Okay, let's start. Petro Marharin versus Nugo Shikadze.
SPEAKER_03: What do you think about this match? We know Petro Marharin has incredible wrist and Nugo here is incredibly strong. How does it hit this match? You know Sasho didn't know a lot of the competitors. I think he knows Nugo that he pulled 100kg at the Europeans against Grassi. Because he pulled with Grassi.
SPEAKER_03: What do you think about the match between Nuno and Petrov?
SPEAKER_03: If you explain it to me, what happened to Krasimir then? Krasimir fell from this Norgazi, the one who was kicking them because he had no muscles, but he kicked them all in the categories, remember? And now Norgazi will play against this Margarine, that you play with him, Petro. Ukrainian. Petro Margarine, he played with Rewaz, he played with John Burzink. No, no, no. Sasho Pugl with Petro.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, yeah, okay. Oh, yeah, okay. Oh, yeah, okay.
SPEAKER_02: in the real game. I mean, he will beat the other guy, where he will crash, but I don't think it would be that easy, in principle. But who do you think will beat the two of them? I guess that the game is on a completely different level from Petro's this year. Maybe 60% for him,
SPEAKER_03: He thinks Petru will win because he has a stronger wrist and his wrist is stronger than Krasi. That's the reason Nurgazi has a small arm.
SPEAKER_03: Nugo is a really small arm here and this is important. So he says that he's gonna hook him and beat him. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, Irakli, Nugo versus Marharit. It's interesting. I don't know how he's in form. Petro, if you were in 2014, you would be very interested in his form. But I think Nugo is very strong. It's interesting.
SPEAKER_03: It's a very interesting match, but I don't know where Petro is. Last time he competed very well, he beat very good guys, but I think Luxury will be the favorite in this match. Brandon Alcestor vs. Stoyan Golemanov.
SPEAKER_02: Stoyan knows about this match very late, but he looks in very good shape.
SPEAKER_03: And even for that short time for preparation, he thinks he can win and he wants Stoyan to win because he is from Bulgaria. Yeah, but that's another thing. Stoyan normally, as a Bulgarian national champion, he was getting ready to pull against Krasimir. So I think he was in good shape already. Sarsu doesn't know that, but I know because I trained with Stoyan.
SPEAKER_03: He's in top shape now. I never see Stojan in so good shape. Stojan Golemanov vs. Brandon Alcestor. Do you remember Brandon Alcestor? He had a match with David Samusha. Yes. Golemanov will win? Yes.
SPEAKER_03: It's okay, it's okay. Okay. What does it say? He said Goleman won the win. Okay, okay. 95 kilo category.
SPEAKER_03: He played 95 kg with his left hand. Do you know who they are? Didn't he play one of the players on the table? If you explain it to me, it's a bit better. Petki is one of those players who I think you played as a youngster. He played a little bit weak, but he played very well from the inside and from the top.
SPEAKER_03: And then Talgat, the fast one, where Jasson quickly learned to lay down, again with thin arms. Who did Sasho have final with left arm in Malaysia? Yes, yes, yes, yes. It's been a long time since then. In Malaysia? In Malaysia, who did you play with on the left hand in the final? Well, more with him. Who?
SPEAKER_03: probably with duniani but he is not sure yeah i think in same category david samusha and betty they both were there i think yeah i i remember i remember before many years in junior classes sasha meet betkili who won
SPEAKER_03: And Sasho won, but the match was long, you know, and Sasho was the junior who beat the senior classes also. And we were so impressed that some juniors started to hook him, you know, and stop him. Because they really have tiny arms and stopped Sasho in hook, you know, and that was incredible. From that moment, you understand that in the future, this world is going to be superstars. So what do you think? Who's going to win Sasho?
SPEAKER_03: He said 50-50, but it depends who is preparing better, you know, because they are very close and it depends who... I don't know how bad Kili preparing, I think he's living in Spain.
SPEAKER_03: He said this is a very interesting match and I think
SPEAKER_03: Betkili win the win, but not how to say, easy. Yeah, so he thinks that Iraqli, Talgat start, Betkili stop. Yes, yes. Okay, I know what he's thinking. Yeah, yeah. So it's a better translation. Yeah, but you see, Talgat have a different technique also. He have some king's move. No, he does with right arm.
SPEAKER_03: that would right but i think he can do in the left also he's with that left arm against bad killi i don't think it would work but killi is interesting puller but maybe flash pin you know maybe he can flash him you know yeah we will see we will see it's a great match
SPEAKER_03: And he say, if Betkili, biggest role is endurance in this match. Biggest role is endurance, yes. If he stops, then his endurance will be better. Yes, whoever has better endurance. And Tobias versus Kamil. Kamil Jablonski, Tobias Porong. Sasho. It's a left arm or right? Left arm, left arm. I never come. Misička, Milsička. Yes.
SPEAKER_03: I saw him lift a lot of weights, that's why. He also lifts a lot of weights, Tobias. No, but still, I think he was... Yes, he won. Sasho says he thinks Kamil will win because he watched him on YouTube, on Facebook, how he makes very heavy weights, you know?
SPEAKER_03: and he's stronger and also also because i told him but um uh tobias also make very heavy weights and uh he say yeah but uh um camille uh wins against uh devon okay um exactly do you lift heavier than sasha which exercise
SPEAKER_03: I don't know because Sasho thinks that whoever lives heavier wins. If you see how I push the biggest weight, you can see who is the favorite in this match.
SPEAKER_02: Sasha, do you lift heavier than Irakli today? I don't think that lifting that heavy has anything to do with the Canadian fight. A little while ago he said something else about the Canadian fight. No, it wasn't that important.
SPEAKER_03: He said he doesn't think weightlifting is the same as armwrestling.
SPEAKER_03: but you say different before that for Camille and he say I know I just say like this it wasn't so important okay okay now now it makes sense because if if it is only weight lifting then then yeah it would be we would all go and lift weight and whoever lives gold medal you know just give you anything I'm really curious sorry I'm really curious how much street crew can make uh Sasho that's the thing because I I see I see
SPEAKER_02: Sasho, how much can you do a strict rule? To not touch your back, your head and your ass in the wall? I've never really tried. You've never tried? No. He said he never tried. 3-4 years ago, with... I even have videos somewhere, but I have to look for them. With 3 or 4 years, he tried. With 110, I did about 12.
SPEAKER_03: Strictly? No, not strictly. He said, but not strictly, with 110 kg, 12 reps, but not strictly. I haven't done this exercise for a long time. Yes, but he didn't make with two hands biceps bar a long time ago.
SPEAKER_03: Yes, okay. A few years ago he tried. He did 110 kilos, you said? 110, but not strict rule. Okay, okay, but not strict, but still he did 12 times. 12 reps, yeah. Yeah, but for many years he doesn't do that anymore. Yeah. Okay. There is a ZG Gamer. What do you say?
SPEAKER_03: I think he stopped these exercises for weightlifters and he is still stronger of armwrestling. Yeah, Zidji Gamer, Superchat. Hasho really thinks that he can win this match?
SPEAKER_03: There's a question. He says, Georgia is the power. Good luck to Irakli and his translator. So he's asking, Sasho really thinks that he wins this match, he can win this match. The question. Sasho, there is a question for the Super Chat. They're asking if you really believe that you can win this match. I need to ask you because it's Super Chat. Yes, sorry.
SPEAKER_03: He said if that guy who asking is really involved in armwrestling and he knows armwrestling community, he will know Sasho will not go to competing if he's not sure to win. Okay, okay.
SPEAKER_03: Kamil vs Tobias. You were in Dubai when he played against Wagner, Tobias. Yes, I played against Tobias when he played against Wagner. Yes, I played against Tobias when he played against Wagner.
SPEAKER_03: I think Tobias will win this match with a flash pin because Tobias is a very strong guy. I understand. He thinks that the match will be the same as the Wagner match. Yes.
SPEAKER_03: Do you know these two? Sandres is sitting with this Latvian with 110 kg, who is the world champion, against Ibrahim Sagov, the one who played with Hutchins, where he hit him well on the inside and pulled out his elbow, the high one from the AMC. I think four times AMC champion, I think. Well, here 61-40 for Latvian.
SPEAKER_03: Sixty percent for the studies. He said he watched this guy on the World and European Championship and he knows he keeps his power all the time, all of the year.
SPEAKER_03: but for the uh sagov he didn't have enough information for him i understand uh iraqi sundries versus ibrahim he thinks ibrahim sago is favorite in this match okay yes and this one i only asked for percentage
SPEAKER_03: Irakli vs. Sasho. I'm asking only for percentages here, Sashe. Irakli vs. Sasho. Only percentages. We'll see. I don't think it's necessary to discuss when it includes me. Only percentages. Yes, I keep it as a joker.
SPEAKER_03: He didn't think he must say now and he will keep this in his mind like a joker and he will not tell you. Oh, he will not tell me that. Okay. Yeah. And Irakli already says 50-50, so no need to ask him. Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but if he changes his mind, he can still tell us. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Only 50-50 and we will see in the match. Okay, Leonidas Arkona versus Kulboy. I think 50-50. He thinks 50-50. He cannot say. Okay, Irakli? Leonidas and Kulboy.
SPEAKER_03: 50-50. 50-50. There is another super chat. ZG Gamer. But Sasho, you will get impressed not only the look of his arms, you will be also impressed by his power. The same guy is telling to Sasho, super chat. He said Sasho will not be impressed only by the arms of the Iraqi, but he said he will be impressed by his power as well.
SPEAKER_03: The one who asked Sasha if he really thought he would beat Irakli now says that you will be impressed not only by the hands of Irakli, but also by his strength. Well, even if I don't have any friends, I read.
SPEAKER_03: he asked maybe he this is his friend he's some friend of iraqi iraqi there is a there is a guy that is super chatting all the time and then he's messing with sasho is that is that iraqi's friends um
SPEAKER_03: I don't know who is this guy. I don't know. What's he say? I don't know who is this guy. I don't know.
SPEAKER_03: He thinks Mindaugas will win. If Mindaugas takes Makarov's wrist, he will win for sure. But the question is, will he take his wrist?
SPEAKER_03: If Makarov will move in the hook,
SPEAKER_03: um um is makaro with the wheel but if uh mida got top of him he will win no no that everyone knows in the world everyone knows that but the question is which one is going to happen what does he like to think 50 50. okay 50 50. okay because we know if
SPEAKER_03: Arthur Hooks is going to kill him. Okay, Ziggy Gamer again. I am just a fan of arm wrestling and Irakli. The guy said that he's just a fan of arm wrestling and Irakli. He's not Irakli's friend.
SPEAKER_03: yeah okay sasha last five matches uh i think four five six matches is that left or right arm left
SPEAKER_03: he didn't know the he said 50 50 but he didn't know uh what uh is the shape of what wins have uh nikisha because he didn't compete a long time yeah yeah but but but he said
SPEAKER_03: For Fia, he didn't know her. Sasha doesn't know Fia? Yeah, yeah. Okay. Yeah, Fia probably has as many world titles as Sasha has. Yeah, Fia is. Yeah. Okay, Michael Todd. Okay, sorry. Fia versus... Ekaterina Goniapovic. I think Ekaterina is a favorite in this match. Interesting.
SPEAKER_03: Irakli, let's start with you. Michael Todd vs Brent Lamparelli. Brent Lamparelli. Mike Todd? Mike Todd, for sure. For sure? Is it going to be an easy match or a hard match? I don't think it's going to be an easy match. I don't think it's going to be an easy match. Mike Todd has every match harder and harder.
SPEAKER_03: Before I ask to Sasho, the same guy, one more Superchat. Sasho, this guy, he says Sasho didn't got any fan or even a friend to Superchat for him. What? Do you have a fan or even a friend in this chat?
SPEAKER_03: He didn't know if he had friends or in the the the list or or fans but he didn't
SPEAKER_03: He didn't expect to have fans or friends for the podcast. He didn't need it. The people who he needed, they will come probably with him on the tournament to watch him alive and to help him to win.
SPEAKER_03: Okay. Okay. Okay. And Michael Todd versus Frank Lamparelli, Sasho? Sasho, what do you think about these two? Michael Todd has a great game, but I guess Lamparelli. He says Michael has an ugly game, but he thinks Lamparelli will win. Lamparelli will win, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Sasho has a very calm personality. You know better than I do, but he looks very calm, very cool. Even though he's very, very strong, but he's just very relaxed. Almost like he doesn't have any nerves. Yeah, he's right. You are right.
SPEAKER_03: I'm right? Okay, because you know better, but this is how I see it. Because whatever is happening, you're just smiling, very relaxed. It's great, a different personality. He says that you're a very calm person and you don't care about anything. What's wrong with you? I think when you show it...
SPEAKER_03: Sasha thinks it's not necessary to show your emotion all the time. Very quick question before we go to other matches. Did Sasha wrestle before armwrestling?
SPEAKER_03: He was a wrestler, right? Yes, he was a wrestler. I will tell you something. For some years, I was a trainer and people who did wrestling and got injured from knee or something, when they come to arm wrestling, usually they start from here, directly. They are much stronger than the other kids around.
SPEAKER_03: so that is probably why i think arsene lilia was also raster as far as i heard no no what's that oh no no arsene say uh i playing football when i was junior yes yeah i like football i think he told me that he did some wrestling or something do you realize that arsene's neck
SPEAKER_03: his neck is like that big you know like really yes yeah yeah he's like yeah but you remember uh when he's starting in arm wrestling he was wasn't so big you know was tiny guy when he stopped uh Svetan
SPEAKER_03: No, no, no, no. Listen, he was 75 kilos, but still he wasn't. His forearms, his upper body, his neck, still for 75 kilos. He was 2005. And next year, he also with Lubomir and other guys in Hungary, Europeans. No, his upper body, his legs, everything just not big. But the upper body was really big. There is a super chat. Choke on wax.
SPEAKER_03: I hope Irakli wins, so Levan will have at least one thing to look forward to. He says, I hope Irakli wins, so Levan will have at least one thing to look forward to. I don't know what exactly he meant, but... Okay. David Samusha. David Samusha versus Aydar Khan. Nurdalet Aydar Khan. Sasho.
SPEAKER_03: Nurdaren Aydarhan is the guy that won what was in five different categories. He won 55, 60, 65, 75, 80. In 70 kilos, he took second place. So he won medal in six different categories, five of them gold, one of them silver. And now he's going to pull against David Camusia, who defended his title.
SPEAKER_03: seven times i mean he won and then defended six more times so he won seven title matches how does special see this match and i need one one second i need some charger and i will be okay i'm here but yes yeah yeah yeah go ahead go ahead yes sasho
SPEAKER_03: He played in 6 different categories, he played up to 55kg, 60kg, 65kg, 70kg and he won gold everywhere, only at 70kg he took 2nd place. And he will play against David Samusha, who has probably defended his title match against Wes 85kg for 7 times. Yes, I can't say for sure, but I think it's 50-50.
SPEAKER_03: yeah he say his answer is not so uh nicely you know the people uh how i say he's maybe border us with his answer but uh uh he think 50 50 because they are very very close yeah
SPEAKER_03: Melazze, thank you very much to you. Tornike came. Thank you very, very much. I appreciate. And you saved the podcast, my friend. Thank you. Thank you, guys. Thank you. Goodbye. So he thinks it's a 50-50 match. Does he think that it's a match like similar to Talgat versus Betkili? The one with the enderhooks, the other one is with this.
SPEAKER_03: And also Georgia against Kazakhstan. Very similar match. Both of them are known for their endurance.
SPEAKER_03: Aydar Khan, they are lightning fast. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And there is ZG Gamer again. This guy is addicted to Sasho. He's still talking with Sasho. He said, well, Sasho, if you don't understand, I mean fans, not a family that is going to come on competition and you don't have to say to fans to be your fan. I'm Georgian and I want you to lose.
SPEAKER_03: And he says, ha, ha, ha. So he says that he is a Georgian and he wants you to lose. So... He's saying he don't care. He's very calm, you know. It is impossible not to like him. You know, he's very cool, very calm. Yeah, same with me, you know. I write a message and then three years later he replies me.
SPEAKER_03: Samusha versus Aydar Khan.
SPEAKER_00: Of course, Samusha will win. He's the favorite. But still, Aydar Khan is very impressive. All of his matches are very impressive and it will be an interesting match.
SPEAKER_00: And will Irakli keep his promise to me? Which promise? That if I ever pull with David Samusha, he's not going to train with me. He will keep his promise. Yeah, OK.
SPEAKER_03: Georgi Tvetkov vs Alex Kurdecha. It shouldn't be that easy. It shouldn't be that quick answer. We want some detailed answer. I don't know how strong Georgi is.
SPEAKER_02: He said because he catch with Georgi and know how strong is Georgi.
SPEAKER_03: because of that he thinking he will win and he believe he will win but uh he cannot say about kordechia because uh he never catch with kordechia he knows about kordechia only when he watch his matches with somebody yeah yeah and iraqi
SPEAKER_03: these are two uh the top top rollers the best ones uh but i still think that it's sixty percent uh sixty to forty for georgie okay sasho this guy will never leave you alone you know he says you will not be so calm when you're gonna lose really the guy the guy really is just writing all the time to you
SPEAKER_03: He said, we will see. Tony, can you translate to Iraqi? There is one Georgian guy that all the time is standing in super chats just to mess with Sasho all the time.
SPEAKER_03: I'm glad that there are people like Engin who pay attention to him. Irakli has not sent anyone deliberately. He promises. Okay, the guy now wrote, Irakli made me write all these superchats. What does he think? Irakli, ladies and gentlemen, thanks to you.
SPEAKER_03: I swear it's not me, I haven't even thought about it. He didn't write such thing, I'm just, you know, creating such thing, you know, he didn't say that, I'm just messing with him. What did Sasho say between them? He said that guy must be glad because have people like you, Engin, who
SPEAKER_03: was ready to answer him and to text him and to pay attention for this for this no this is Sasha may not know this is super chat they pay money so we need to we need to read this question yeah oh just Sasha put let you know a little bit like a

SPEAKER_02: He thinking Alijan will win. I asked Sasha why he thinking
SPEAKER_03: Alizhan will win and he say because Sasho compete few times with Prudnik on European and World Championships and he knows how strong is Prudnik and he see what kind of control of the game Alizhan has with Prudnik and beat him pretty easy.
SPEAKER_03: he asked me they competing left arm yeah yeah yeah right right arm i wouldn't say that much right down that mess would be too much yeah no he asked about the prudnik prudnik and uh alijan was a right left arm yeah it was left arm yeah yeah yeah yeah and this guy again super chat uh ziggy gamer sasho you have such a bad joke better stop man
SPEAKER_03: he didn't think he he's joking yeah i'm curious he he did like probably 30 30 euros of superchats i'm curious if he's gonna come to istanbul and watch and then he tells the special hello
SPEAKER_03: I am that guy, you know. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Let's let that guy reading more, because when he meet him alive, just he must remember who is this guy. Okay, okay. Irakli, who is winning, Ermes or Alijan? It's interesting, because Alijan had a very good performance.
SPEAKER_00: Well, it's a very interesting match. I should say that we have not seen Alijan with very strong top rollers before. But I still think that he's favorite with this match. Okay.
SPEAKER_03: And the last match, I'll tell you. Devon Larratt vs. Levan Saginashvili. Don't tell us only name, just tell us some detail. This is the last match we talk about. In principle, I thought that Levan would win. But he didn't play his worst, because of the injury he had.
SPEAKER_02: Devon is on a different level now than he was before, but I still think that without the injury, if he hadn't been injured, maybe it would have been a similar match. Who wouldn't have been injured? Levan? Yes. First of all, he thinks Levan is stronger.
SPEAKER_03: but because of some injury he had some injury before that and maybe that can can felt him also Devon now it's a better and better shape but even if he is not even if Levan is not injuring the match will be very close and
SPEAKER_03: If Larratt stops the game, I'll take it. He's thinking if Larratt stops the game, he will win. He will win. And what is the possibility for Larratt to stop that match? What is the probability for Larratt to stop that match? To give him Levan's ticket. Yes, but what is your probability? How much probability do you have that this will happen? It depends on how much the ticket is restored.
SPEAKER_02: I can't say for sure. The two are very strong players on different levels. At the moment they are on a different level. I can estimate that he stopped his match with Cvetkov, but I can't imagine how strong he is at the moment. But considering the previous match, he couldn't stop it even below.
SPEAKER_03: He say, you know, when he's speaking, he go here and here. He say it's, okay, Varad is stronger, but if he, when he see the match with Varad. He say Laraz stronger than before, right? Yeah, yeah. Laraz stronger than Levan or before? Yeah, he's stronger than before.
SPEAKER_03: But because he watched his match with Svetkov and he said that he is very strong and the only chance for him to win against Levan is if he opens his wrist. But also he said he didn't know what exactly is the shape of Levan now and still thinking maybe it's 50-50. 50-50, okay.
SPEAKER_03: That's 50-50 is saying. If I would say 50-50, people will say that I'm trying to sell pay-per-view.
SPEAKER_03: Because I said 53% for Levan, 47% for Devon. And people say that, oh, how can you say they should be like 100% Levan? Because I said that, people say, oh, you're trying to sell pay-per-view. But that's interesting because I think Kamil and Tobias, they were my guests. And they also thought that Devon was going to...
SPEAKER_03: So he says 50-50. Irakli is the brother of Levan and training partner.
SPEAKER_04: And what is his opinion?
SPEAKER_00: I'm also a very good friend with Devin, so I will not leave him without any chances. So I would say 99% to Levan and 1% to Devin. Irakli, is that really how you believe? Like 99%? Like it's almost like he's just going to... You have no doubt at all? I made you my target because you must leave it for you.
SPEAKER_03: Maybe I could have given more if Levan's wrist was in pain and still injured, but it's not. Oh, okay. And people talk about why Levan...
SPEAKER_00: Do you think that Levan is injured? Is he injured because of the injury?
SPEAKER_03: Well, we have to look at the bench press, at curls, at one arm curls and the wrist curl also. The numbers are very impressive again, 260 on the bench.
SPEAKER_00: 110 with a one arm curl. And in the sparrings, I see that he's not holding back. He is giving all in. And in the sparring fights, he's very brave as he used to be. So I don't see... But the question was not about his...
SPEAKER_03: a bench press or bicep curl, but mostly about the wrist curl. Because there is the injury happen and there is the little bit weight reduced. So I'm just saying that is it because he doesn't want to push it or is it because he trained 110 kilo bicep curl right before that and two days ago he did wrist curl, maybe he was tired already. But what is Irakli's like objective opinion, if you can give us?
SPEAKER_00: Yes, that's exactly what I wanted to ask you. I know that you don't like the French press, but what do you think about the fact that people don't like it? And what do you think about it? Do you think it's a good thing or not? No, it's not.
SPEAKER_04: At first, I thought that I would be able to do it in 5-6 months. I thought that I would be able to do it in 5-6 months. I thought that I would be able to do it in 5-6 months.
SPEAKER_04: In other words, there is no such thing as Deon's plans, that he will do something, because he knows what will happen, what will happen, how it will happen between Levan and Deon. Deon is probably 10% or 50% or 50%, but the fact is that the machine gun was shot in Levan's face. In other words, Deon's plans are to take something from Levan and put it in a store, right?
SPEAKER_00: Of course, Levan is being partly careful not to injure himself since the stakes are so high. But we have to understand that 80 kg done in the manner how Levan does it, it's a very top result anyways. If it was hurting on 80, he wouldn't even be able to do even 40.
SPEAKER_00: So, his wrist is recovered. He is feeling confident. This argument is, of course, coming from Devon fans and I can understand them because they are looking for a reason to have the belief in Devon and I understand that. But we have to look objectively. We can assume that from their first match, maybe Devon is 10, maximum 15% stronger.
SPEAKER_03: But that difference will not mean anything with Levan and his wrist is fully healed and he's feeling confident. Okay, we are finishing this guy against Sasho for you. He says yes, I can do that. I will be Sasho's nightmare. He means that he will come to you in the competition and he will say I am
SPEAKER_03: ZG Gamer, you know, and he will, he says he will be your nightmare. He will come to you. And he also said, I will say to Levan and he will eat you, Sasha. He said, this one who read ZG, I don't know how it was, will come to Istanbul, yes, he said he will come and it will be your nightmare. And he had to tell Levan to eat you.
SPEAKER_03: It's garbage so much. Now he's scared. He says, now I'm scared. Yeah. And Ziggy Gamer, I'm finishing. Don't write anymore, please. Oh, Sasho's fan. Finally, where were you? Okay. Okay, there is one more Superboy. It says, this Ziggy Gamer is definitely friends with Irakli. Sasho rocks.
SPEAKER_03: so okay and now yeah go ahead go ahead sorry i say now sasha have a fan already yeah yeah and this last one choke on walks how can you find a guy big enough to train with 11 spar with 11. okay thank you very much guys and then before right before finish just very quickly how do you see this match
SPEAKER_03: i think that much yeah because you are a world champion armistice you are very knowledgeable and oh okay okay okay you're a referee yeah i forgot i'm sorry i'm sorry can i ask one fast question just to iraqli i am so curious when iraqli make a sparring with 11 and if when 11 is
SPEAKER_03: Let me start with Irakli. When you have no sparring with Lewandowski,
SPEAKER_00: If there is a problem, he will come to me and I will solve it. For example, if I solve it with Giorgi Tsuetko, he will come to me and I will solve it.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, it depends very much. We always have good sparring sessions.
SPEAKER_00: It's never the case that I have no chance at all. We still get a good fight. We still get a good training. Of course, when Levan is tired, I can play a bit more and sometimes I might even beat him. But all the time we have good sparring sessions and it's been quite productive. Super, thank you.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, ZG Gamer. Engin, sorry, last one. I can join Zoom and say it is me. No, no, we believe you, my friend. It's you. Yeah, yeah.
