SPEAKER_01: Hello, everyone. Now, I think this will be fun to have
SPEAKER_02: this great and friendly athletes. They will join us in a few minutes.
SPEAKER_01: Alex already came. Hello, hello. Hello, how are you, my friend? I'm good, how are you? Good, good, good.
SPEAKER_01: I can't wait. Today is the third podcast, but this one will be the most fun. For sure. No disrespect to other two, but I can imagine already. You both speak English and you both have very friendly, funny, outspoken... Where is Giorgi? Giorgi is ready?
SPEAKER_01: I don't know. He should be. Okay. I mean, I just spoke with him. He said he just can't wait to destroy you. That's what he told me. Okay. I'm ready to listen it by my ears.
SPEAKER_01: You see my backstage? Yeah, yeah, it looks beautiful, yeah. But you are too big, you are blocking your own self, you know. Oh yeah, a little bit, I will be going later. It's our mistake, we should put it a little bit high. I don't get involved with this, this is how the soul does. So how is everything?
SPEAKER_00: great just come back from Italy it was really nice well you know I'm really feel that arm wrestling is growing because I remember super much before was twice not so big like it was yesterday it was really huge a lot of people a lot of new people and everyone is so addicted everyone wants to make a photo to
SPEAKER_01: To shake your hand, to spend some time, pool and everything. This is what you guys deserve. That is my main goal. That's my main goal. In my prime, we didn't have such things. Hopefully, in your prime, you guys' prime, you guys will be superstars. Hopefully, that is all my goal, nothing else.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I want because just like come on man, you know how hard is arm wrestling, how hard it's like for you to become the best in the world and like what does all the other popular sports have over us?
SPEAKER_01: get you know excited you know that stage you guys are up there just this is this is what excites me I know the sports probably better than anyone else and I know how hard it is and like people look at Messi Ronaldo you know they are yeah I respect them but we are talking about a sport that existed since the
SPEAKER_01: creation of the human beings, you know, like from the beginning, there was arm wrestling, trust me. There is even proof on those those pyramids, you know, the arm wrestling hands, you know, yeah, yeah. And and this is not a not a invented ball game or something. This is really, really, really good one. Yeah, I believe this from the beginning, people have hand and they was
SPEAKER_01: Or trying to armrest him from the beginning of the time. For sure. And I guarantee you, if we still exist, 3,000 years later, we will still be armresting. I don't know if there will be football, volleyball, or basketball, but armresting will still exist. I guarantee you that one. This is a natural thing. Hello. Nice to see you. Georgi.
SPEAKER_01: he he he has been guys can you make the uh phones sideways just so we can put more room we can get more um georgie he he has been talking behind you did you hear what he said about you um when behind me yeah he's saying all kind of things you know this is good
SPEAKER_01: It's good. So positive. Georgian don't believe but still reactally positive. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, we have to be positive about everything. Sure. Is it possible you to make the phone sideways? So because you look so small on the screen. You look even like half size on me. Oh, wait a second how to do whenever I make a poll people will not vote for you if they see you that small. Now it's okay.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I think, yeah. Let me see here. So how have you been, Georgi? Good. I was too little for massage, you know, for therapy because I have a little pain in the wrist sometimes, but I feel good. Yeah. Are you going to destroy this guy?
SPEAKER_04: i'm thinking to beat him but to destroy him it will be difficult difficult okay we will see yeah he goes everywhere talks about how he destroyed you in 2017 zloty yeah he beat me but uh before that i have five minute match with siwaz with mitris oh this is why i beat you
SPEAKER_04: No, I don't say that. This is maybe one of the reasons. I can't say. But CYF was the WAF champion. I talked to him. He was like that in over five minutes, right in this position. It was a crazy match. And after that, they called me against Alex and I couldn't even make a grip. You know how it is in this competition. Yeah, it's true. It's true.
SPEAKER_01: So this time things will be different? Let me provoke him a little bit, Alex. Let's hope. Let's hope it will be more interesting. Okay, not let's hope, let you hope. I don't have anything, you know. Yeah, I mean that it will be better if we make a real match, you know, to kill each other.
SPEAKER_01: Alex was in Italy and people tells me that he is in good shape. Yeah, he's big, strong. He's training a lot and I know that he will be very well prepared. I know that. And Alex, you were trying to convince him so hard.
SPEAKER_00: in istanbul remember you were telling me you are so weak you will come and beat me and this and that at least honestly because i like georgie i want this match because he's so nice and uh he's one of the best guys in our wrestling so if you need to pull with somebody why do not pull with a very nice person and beautiful arm wrestler so i think the match will be awesome very positive with the smile on the face but on the table for sure will be war
SPEAKER_00: And who's going to win, Alex? I think it will be a repeat of the previous match. Okay. I will do everything for this. I know that Georgie will be in the best shape of his life. I know it will be not easy, but that's like a challenge for me. That's why it's more interesting. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Don't you guys think from one side you guys are similar with right arm? I don't know. Alex, whenever I saw your left arm, you surprised me big time. I knew you could top roll, but you did the side weight, you did the hook, you did the shoulder pressure. With right arm, at this level of arm wrestling, because that was the world title match.
SPEAKER_01: With right arm, I don't remember you are performing the same way before, like in this level. I see you more like a top rolling guy with right arm.
SPEAKER_01: With Georgi, I also see the same thing, you know, just like a pure pronation and top roll. So I kind of think that you guys are like very similar, like mostly pronation, base, outside pull, not so much, you know, side hits. And do you think that like the strength of the hand and wrist will play the key factor role here?
SPEAKER_00: ask at me or georgie ah both i mean i think first you first see you for sure for sure you're right absolutely like uh very respectfully for georgie you so you saw his match for example without by the way of these other guys he convincedly to probe the guys convinced that you're with devon you know he couldn't pin him but yeah yeah
SPEAKER_00: so I think I believe you're right your experience says truth it will be very uh like key factor and key questions about the wrist control and the setup will be very important we need good referee yeah yeah yeah because you know a little advantage for the other I know you like Bill Collins yeah
SPEAKER_01: yes you like yeah yeah yeah very much my favorite yeah okay anyway so i mean everything you know you know
SPEAKER_01: will be fair and square, and the rest is up to you guys. I don't want anyone to lose and say that I lost because of this, because of that, you know. Unless Alex takes some sweats and puts on his... I don't know. I'm in my mother's restaurant, I will come with this in Turkey, oil, and put on my hands.
SPEAKER_01: Georgi, Georgi said that Devon was taking some sweats and putting on his hand, you know. No, I mean, over here. This was one of the reasons. It was really unexpected. Okay, spoke once at a time. What do you say, Alex? It was really unexpected move from Devon when he like sweat from the...
SPEAKER_01: and takes Georgi's fingers by the sweat. Remember? I was there. I kind of don't remember. I didn't watch the video later, but I was there. Okay, what do you say, Georgi? It was not only this, that he was taking sweat.
SPEAKER_01: between the rounds he was cleaning his uh face with the hand you know all the time and i wanted to put some choke he didn't allow me you can see this yeah i mean i i cannot say anywhere else you can't put sweat on your hand or something you know you can only put chalk on your hands you don't have to put chalk this is yeah but yeah i don't know anyway so um jorge how do you see your chances
SPEAKER_04: Do you see yourself as famous in this match? Maybe yes, because Alex was out of the game for a long time. And maybe a little advantage for me. A little bit. So you have advantage because he was out of the game. If he was in his best shape, you couldn't beat him? No, I mean that this will be one of the advantages for me. And I believe also that he will be very well prepared.
SPEAKER_04: uh the other advantage for him is that he is taller than you know bigger maybe this one this is what i was gonna ask yeah yeah maybe a little longer hand but you know this is very important for i think for your height you have also very tall forearm right me yeah yeah yeah it's uh
SPEAKER_04: Long, only one centimeter less than Devon, I think. Okay. But he's probably eight centimeters longer than me. And you, Alex, how do you see your chance against this guy? You know, now I'm really happy that you saved me because my hand is longer than Devon's hand.
SPEAKER_00: And I don't know how is your arm compared to Devon. So now I know what the difference. But seriously, like, Georgie, awesome guy, very positive and very strong. Like, also, he's very durable. Like, analyzing his matches, he's not just, you know, very fastly pumped up and go out.
SPEAKER_00: the match with Devon for me was really awesome like from the beginning until the end Georgie was on the game he was very endurable he was doing actually what he needs to do of course like sometimes it works sometimes you open and don't give you to work like in your best moments but for me it was like very good work from Georgie by his endurance and he feel on the table where to move where to hold for example and stay in the position
SPEAKER_01: when to attack so uh georgie is a smart guy he pulls by top row top row is for smart guys and uh very it will be for sure interesting match i agree yeah that that that will be very interesting match and i just can't wait i i see arm wrestling is like two type of endurance one endurance endurance within the match the second endurance is the pulling
SPEAKER_01: many matches no matter how hard it was you can still just pull another round you know some people in one round they can pull long long long but in a fresh start they are not there anymore but like within the rounds uh devon had better endurance than uh georgie but georgie still had the same endurance round two round three round four like with the start and everything
SPEAKER_00: had it but within the match um that wouldn't look like you know he had better enders that's why he won you know i think also he was like taking a little bit better setup i think it was he was really taking care about better setup than georgie maybe georgie was have not the best opportunity by the setup on the start i don't know this is true the setup for devon was much better and uh
SPEAKER_04: He had better endurance because he was tapping me with open hand. I couldn't... He was tapping me with this... You know, his hands are... He cannot open his hand and he was tapping me like that. That's why I guess out. So, he had better endurance. If he was up on the table, no chance. No, he wasn't under the table.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, he was like, I don't remember him being like this. No, the second match, he was like this. He was like that. I will show you a picture later. You will see. Okay. The second round. So, his shoulder was below? Not below, but he was something like that. Something like that. I mean, that's below, you know. The rule says that, like, Omero can be like this, but not down in angle. Like, this is okay.
SPEAKER_04: this is not this is okay this is not like that his hand is like that like that i will show you a picture you'll see his hands like that he's topping me with the with the bone not with the muscles but it's okay anyway so yeah and
SPEAKER_01: this this match is important alex right now you are not ranked in top 10 because you haven't pulled such a long time last time i think the pool was against dave chaffee yeah and i think that uh it was after the war started and yeah and then i like they won fair and square he was better man and i think he could even won he could have even won six zero but
SPEAKER_01: Right now, when I saw you in Istanbul, I saw you really big, really in good shape compared to that time. Right now, I have a question for you guys. I mean, Devon is number one right now.
SPEAKER_01: because Lewand was away. Just say, just say, I mean, Lewand looks favorite. We will talk about this, but just say that if, if somehow they won wins, Lewand should still be ranked number two, right? Even though, even though he,
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, he is not right now ranked because of inactivity, because of the injury. But it still should be. So in this case, Devon, Levan, Hermes and Jerry and Gennady. And you are what now? You are right now fifth, right? Yes, yes. Fifth, yeah. And if Levan comes, you are fifth.
SPEAKER_01: gonna be six you know there you know so and so alex it means that if you beat georgie you will be ranking number six and then it's gonna push georgie to number uh seven so but like for example georgie where do you really see yourself like you are you are numbers
SPEAKER_01: Fifth or sixth, whatever, if we include Levan. Even if Levan is number one, then Devon will be number three, and they will push you guys one. But where do you see yourself? Like, do you see yourself beating Hermes? Do you see yourself beating Gennady? You lost to Jerry, but I mean, there is always some rematch.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I think that my chances against Hermes are very big because you saw that Devon destroyed him. He took his wrist and in Devon's opinion, my wrist is much stronger than Hermes.
SPEAKER_01: And I also think that he has a very big chance against Gennady. I don't say that I can beat him, but I think that I have a chance. Do you think that these two athletes, both Hermes and Gennady, have a chance to flop this press?
SPEAKER_04: i don't think so because i think that they are not so strong like uh like jerry and another thing now i'm much stronger than before you know i'm much stronger way stronger and so you know i i injured my chest and how is it now you healed up uh with i feel i don't feel it at all it's very good you don't have any problem okay here and then you know i know alex where do you see yourself
SPEAKER_00: You know, honestly, the best thing is to pool with guys. I believe that I, in my current shape, can pool with every one of these guys. But to be objective, yeah, the table shows the truth. So I can expect some results from my pool with the guys, like make some predictions in my mind. But the best option is always to check. Actual match.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, for example, for actual form, for actual shape, I'm absolutely ready to pull with Devon, with Gennady, with the rest of the guys who are upper than me. Of course, they deserve the place, but for sure, I train hard not just for nothing. I was trained hard exactly for this. Yeah, I mean, basically, sooner or later, you have a goal to become number one.
SPEAKER_01: exactly yeah yeah that's how it should be yeah that's how it should be yeah yeah and and everyone i mean in top 10 has such a potential yeah anyway so yeah that will be interesting yeah i kind of see that you both will be like both of you are like top row specialists like you want to take the hand control and then pin not really like
SPEAKER_01: tight pressure was just take the hand and the pin. And I can't wait to see, you know, which one of you will have better hand and wrist because Alex,
SPEAKER_01: Maybe you don't like so much role pressure with right arm that is applied to you. But to take your hand is like even when you lost against Dave Chaffee, you I remember attack, but he had the the side pressure, you know, but not everyone can be that effective.
SPEAKER_01: control yeah so I think it is the same same with uh uh Georgie um so I so basically whoever takes the risk is gonna win this match not really yes really wow wow it looks like he has some other plans you know like I need to be honest yeah to say
SPEAKER_00: yeah remember sometimes we have some predictions have some plans and table shows some really unexpected maybe for example uh i will take the wrist of georgie and georgie just flat press me like better than or jelly in a better style i don't know like i need to be ready for this yeah you know what i mean then oh i i i will be concentrated only on the hands
SPEAKER_01: and georgie just pushed me there i don't i don't believe i don't believe that you're gonna take georgie's hand and georgie is gonna flop press you if you take georgie's hand you're gonna win that much i was just thinking that maybe if georgie takes your hand you had the plan to be pressing like this because i i don't really see georgie is that this person maybe some some other guys but at this top 10 world level you know i don't think georgie can that that just press anyone
SPEAKER_01: But maybe Georgi will prepare some surprise. We cannot be so sure. Maybe Georgi makes some surprise. Georgi's game plan doesn't include such thing. Georgi's game plan
SPEAKER_01: just all based on taking everything you know and maybe georgie can do that uh shoulder pressure but not that this maybe georgie can take somebody's maybe he can work on this but i don't think that georgie is planning his wrist to be taken and then i don't think he even trains for that do you train that never in my life never you are right thank you
SPEAKER_01: So whenever you said, Alex, maybe not. Like I said, whoever takes the risk is going to win. I thought you had a plan. If Georgi takes your risk, then you're going to do this to him. I don't know about that one. But I'm sure about Georgi. Georgi is a perfectionist. Georgi is just all about, crazy about taking everything here, you know. So it will be all about only top row, Georgi, right? Like Henrik says. How about you?
SPEAKER_00: i don't know for me table will say like uh so if it if it takes your wrist then you will still write you know it's obviously yes for sure i will try everything and if george is take my wrist so if the plan goes in that direction i will for sure try something else
SPEAKER_01: But do you know what the difference is? Like some people say that even Jerry had so hard time against Gyorgy, you know, with this one. But just remember, Jerry goes there. When Jerry goes there, Gyorgy has everything because there is no pressure on his wrist and he has the full wrist. But you, you may start with outside.
SPEAKER_00: and then flatten, you know, just flatten Georgi's wrist, and then to the far side of his hand, not to his arm, understand? Because he won't be able to... Sounds good, yeah? Jordi, what do you think about plan of Engin? Sounds good. I was not planning like this, but now maybe it's a good option. Just watch. Everything by Engin. Engin gives me this plan, and I just will take it, keep it, and, you know, maybe...
SPEAKER_01: No, I'm just, just, just as an arm master, see, remember Frank Lamparelli match? Frank didn't have the wrist. Yeah, I remember. He, he, he kept, I know Georgi was ill there, but he still was, you know, so, um, it is totally different to apply the, the, the pressure without wrist to the arm this way or to the far side of the guy. Like when Pushkaran, uh, rest in peace, Pushkaran,
SPEAKER_01: Michael Todd first time pull, Michael had the wrist and Pushkar was just doing while Michael had the wrist and it was so ineffective. And when they pulled the last time the supermatch in Zloty Tur and Pushkar was able to go far side of the
SPEAKER_01: Michael's hand and then he applied the pressure to the far side of the hand this way not like in here so that Michael would have so that's very hard to do that but if you go far side and then put the pressure it is a little bit easier yeah thank you can I say tell you something before the match with Frank on the world I had very difficult match you know the Ukrainian guy better he
SPEAKER_04: yeah yeah yeah yeah the guy could be we killed each other it was very difficult much before that oh you had that long match before he's also very strong oh okay i don't remember yes we this was my second match and we you can you can see we killed each other on right hand and after that i played with frank oh yeah yeah my first match was with my yeah i mean almost everyone
SPEAKER_00: yeah i said i remember yeah beat almost everyone you guys have the long match and like you kill each other and after that you don't go higher than you was able to do i mean this was the most difficult match for me on this championship this event okay
SPEAKER_04: This was the second match. The first match was like that. Very difficult. He was very well prepared. But you still won the goal, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: And in 2021, which place did you take there? I was first place left hand, sixth place I think right hand. Who did you lose there? I lost from Arif and with two fouls from Mikhail Nenko.
SPEAKER_01: I have a question, Alex. I saw Petrenko winning the super heavyweight in Ukraine the other day. Was it left arm or right arm? You didn't follow, right? Honestly, not Mikhailenko, I don't remember. Wait a second. In heavyweight, it was for sure on the right guys from heavyweight category.
SPEAKER_00: About Oleg, maybe left. Yes, maybe. Because for right, according to what I see, I see only the pictures. And it was a guy from the heavyweights on the right hand. Yeah. Is that the guy that Georgi is talking about? Mikhailenko? Wait a second. I'm not sure. There is two strong guys. And I don't remember the surname of this guy who won now, actually. But Mikhailenko, for sure.
SPEAKER_01: or very strong and maybe it was him but i'm not sure there is two strong guys in a super heavyweight category i understand yeah anyways let's see let's see how it will be let's let's talk a little bit about the predictions and i think everything i heard on my mind was still better to um open
SPEAKER_01: Okay, first match, Petro Marharit versus Shikadze, Nugo Shikadze.
SPEAKER_01: Because last year in the Europeans, he beat Krasimir. You know that, right? Yes, for sure. I know that. Yes, I know that. Because he is his teammate. And when Krasimir saw this match, he said, very interesting match. Like, it is not that easy to topple Krasimir's wrist in his weight category. In his weight category.
SPEAKER_01: and also but this guy top of him but other side the petro margarine is we all remember how strong hand and wrist he has how he hook even uh revas and what what do you think about this match alex maybe you start if petron will be in his prime because
SPEAKER_00: he was a little bit off yeah we don't know did he really will be in the best shape but if he will be in the best shape he will be for sure very dangerous I pull with him I remember the size of his wrist and it's absolutely like the wrist of super heavyweights category guy yeah very very huge wrist and very powerful wrist and actually even guys who beat him like
SPEAKER_00: they actually know how to pull with him so it's about mostly to his bicep they beat him i think yeah yeah and he probably improved also these weaknesses because in the past he has it but now maybe he will prove but the thing that's by long period he was a little bit off out of the competition yeah and if return in a good shape he for sure dangerous about chikadze
SPEAKER_00: He was in the Sicily when I was in the same place. He was very amazing. He was very good. He was brave to pull with everyone. Was he in Italy in Supermatch? No, no, no. In the Sicily. In Sicily before. Did he pull any side matches? Side training? Yeah, I remember they pulled and he was impressive. For his face, he was very impressive. Who did he pull with?
SPEAKER_00: He beat all the guys, like even much more bigger guys, which level, I would say, like international level, yeah? Like, not maybe the WAF champion, yeah, but international level. Yeah. And guys also showed me the video, and it was the video when he beat Irakli. Of course, it was some past video, but... Clearly, yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And beat Krasimir and beat a couple of very strong guys. So he is very good, especially against the hook pullers, I think. Because I think his arm is very strong here, you know. I saw his curls like 90 kilos or something. He was really lowering the weight, you know, in the squat table. I was like, what the hell, you know. Like, I can't do that with two hands, you know.
SPEAKER_00: He's for sure very amazing guy. He's very special, very special. But still you are thinking that if Margarine is in the shape, he would beat him? Honestly, if Margarine will be in the top shape, yes. Because Margarine in top shape, he able to beat super heavyweights and very strong super heavyweights. And about...
SPEAKER_01: Chikadze, he's very strong, but I didn't saw that he beat, for example, somebody like Rivas, you know. That's why. Yeah, but just here, you're right, yeah. And you, how do you see Georgi this much? I think when you pulled Travis' left arm, it was the day that Marharit was just destroying everyone, yeah? Yeah, yeah, yes, in 2018.
SPEAKER_04: yeah december december yeah yeah yeah i think that nuzari will win for me because i follow him and i see his trainings he is very very crazy i'm say crazy in the good way he trains a lot he's a warrior and uh alex said that he has never seen he beat somebody heavyweight but i have seen him beat you know the new georgian guy george rostomashvili
SPEAKER_04: yeah so i saw muxari beat him on competition right now so this is maybe a little bit things are you serious yes i saw muxari beat giorgio rostomashvili on right arm i can find you the video later in in internet wow it it's not uh uh you know big competition it's but it's on competition and he beats him
SPEAKER_01: He top-rolled him and he beat him. I couldn't believe that. Okay, then what should we think right now? I think this match became even more interesting right now. One guy is crazy about top-roll power and the other guy is anti-top-roll. Nobody can top-roll him. So this is an incredible match. And Petro was out for a long time and this is also very important. Not super out, not such a long time because he was 20.
SPEAKER_01: In 2022 he was in Antalya and then in the last four months or something he's training. So maybe one year he was out, maybe maximum. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So where do you see the match going? Alex thinks that, you know, Marharin has a better chance. I think that Nugul will win, Chikadze will win for me. Okay, that's interesting. Wow. The Chikadze, the guys. He's a very passionate guy, believe me.
SPEAKER_01: then he's very very special guy yeah yeah yeah and he's very like super friendly guy all-time smiles and dogs you know just at the table is crazy but you know outside the table is very very friendly guy yeah yeah okay let's go listen more we talk about the matches with the people knowledgeable like you guys
SPEAKER_00: Okay, let's go, Alex. We have Ibrahim Sago vs. Sandry Sedes. You know, Sandry shows very special level by last time and I think he will be taking very seriously this match because Sago is very serious opponent and I think like Sandry understand the level of the Sago so he probably will be in his best shape. Not like
SPEAKER_00: just good but the best good as he can and i think uh sanders will be doing a very good game plan for this match and we're trying to go out and open the wrist and probably match will go to the strap and if he will be able to be faster and take the wrist i think he will be one if sago will be very fastly go to the triceps
SPEAKER_01: I think it will be trouble for some. Do you think that there is a possibility that, you know, even like sometimes against those pressure guys taking the risk, sometimes it's just like, because you are caught on your brachioradialis, like when you are like this, the bicep is more effective also, but once you are overpronating and the bicep is like, you cannot even really tighten your bicep this way so much, but it is mostly on your
SPEAKER_00: Braki Radialis, which is not as strong as Bicep. So you are saying that once he top rolls Ibrahim, he will secure the win? I think that he will be very managed to take also not the wrist, but also take the hand of his part of the table and he will be ready even to the defense in that position and he will be trying to offense like attack position very fastly. And I think
SPEAKER_04: experience also in the matches in the side of Sandrić? I think that Sandrić will take this win because he is a more smart competitor and he is well-rounded everywhere. He can play hook, top row and
SPEAKER_04: But just because he can play everywhere, does it mean that he is better at everywhere? If the match goes inside, does it for sure give him the match winning? I think that if the match goes inside and Sandrić can't finish, I think that he can use top rope and that is his weapon in this match. Because he can play everywhere and he is very smart also.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, so you both are thinking that Sandris has the edge to win this match. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Alex, Aktaev, Talgat Aktaev versus Betkili Oniyani. Crazy match. Crazy match. I was almost going to ask you, are you familiar with Betkili? But since you said this, you are. Yes, I know both of the guys. Crazy match. And I think for both of them, they put a special aim. You know, like
SPEAKER_00: They want to beat and prove something to all the world. I know that Kazakhs, they always take this seriously. And Oniani is a special guy who shows the level so much time. And honestly, in this match, I have no idea who will be the stronger. Like for sure it will be the war, but who will be the stronger? I just can say like 50-50. I have no idea who will be more effective. Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_04: Okay, you? I think that Uniani will have a bigger advantage because he has more big endurance than Talgat. I played against Uniani in Spain and he was very strong. I saw that. You top rolled him and he was still defending. No, this was the first match. I beat him very easy.
SPEAKER_04: but after that i played with 50 people and we make one more again and it was i was tired and it was very very difficult to beat him he's okay there was between those two matches there were other people i played with 50 people he can confirm that also no i know i know just people people never tell us the full story you know
SPEAKER_01: he can't confirm this because i will no no listen no need to ask if you are if if you are saying this then like i mean of course we believe you know i mean that he has very big tendrils he's very i think that he will win for me the bigger chance so my my opinion actor wins quick or actor really catches betty very near to the pad not like 90 degree
SPEAKER_01: arm but like more like 120 or something and then then then locks there and tires and beat him you know but if anywhere bad killy like really push his elbow lock it's very hard to finish him there very hard you know but who knows we will see they both are really big guys you know they they used to be 70 75
SPEAKER_01: For me, it was easier to beat him that way instead of taking the risk and beating him. Listen, neither of them are top rollers, you know. I mean, I tell you, I don't think Akteo can go outside. He can go outside. He may go outside, but I don't think he is that professional about top rollers to take someone back in his risk, you know. Yeah. Okay, let's go to the next one. Minda Agostarasaitis, Artur Makaro.
SPEAKER_00: I think before the last match of Taras Taitis, I probably put Makarov like a favorite. Even maybe not small but advantage favorite. But now after the match when Taras Taitis beat Prokopchuk in that way, I will put Taras Taitis in a favorite.
SPEAKER_04: Okay, but big favorite or slightly? Like 55, 55, not so big, but you know. And you, Georgi? For me, it's the same because from the last time when I saw the win of Mindaugas against Prokopchuk, I think that he will beat him, maybe 60% for Mindaugas. 60? Yeah, yeah, in my opinion.
SPEAKER_00: okay and let's go to the next one pr isek ekaterina nikiseva alex i need to be honest i'm not so sure about the difference of level of the girls here i like i cannot compare okay you georgie i think that uh fear maybe will take the win
SPEAKER_00: my opinion because i haven't seen nikisha competing for a long time for me i i don't know okay alex this is incredible match sasho versus iraqi 95 kilo world title match i know that uh iraqi will be so many motivated because sasha beats already him like and i know he wants to yeah and i know that
SPEAKER_00: will be trained like it will be revenge day yeah so it will be special but when i saw the last matches of the sasho he contains constantly in a good shape and he can he know how to uh avoid uh of the pressure of the top rowers yeah and did he did directly will be have this so big difference in top row so attack him from the better position i'm really not sure i think
SPEAKER_01: slight favorite is sasha i i think trying to topple kasho i think there are much better ways to suicide yeah trying to take his wrist is just i mean you take his wrist he's gonna hit you sideways you will be opening from your bicep the only way to beat him my opinion you can do the back pressure at the beginning and then you curl him
SPEAKER_01: and then go over his pronator. When Sasho is coming to you, if you try to go here, he will eventually control your pronator, either with wrist or pressure. So what you need to do, you need to hang him here and then curl his pronator and then attack to this way. If I would pull him, I would pull that way. How do you see that, Georgi?
SPEAKER_01: I mean, for your top role, it may not be a problem with him because you are super heavyweight. You top role everyone except Alex.
SPEAKER_04: yeah for me this match will be very interesting because i think that now iraqi is in very good shape maybe better than the first time they met but i think that uh sasha will take this win he is very strong against top rovers and um the style for iraqi will be very very difficult do you do you do you think do you think iraqi tries to top roll him
SPEAKER_01: Maybe yes. I'm not sure. What if he goes over pronated by not over pronated but just hanging here and then going over the way that he pulled against Rustam? I don't know.
SPEAKER_04: For me, Sancho is a favourite here. And something else, in two, three days I'm going to train with Sancho for this match. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We'll train together. Yeah, because you both have match right now. Yeah, we'll go to train together. So I will make him a good favour for Iraqi, you know. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But with his short arms, how is he going to give the train to Alex?
SPEAKER_04: Two hands top row. Yes, and there are two, three guys who are 190 centimeters tall, very good top rowers in this city, so I can train with them also. They are not top level, but...
SPEAKER_01: Does Golemanov still train? He is the best shape of his life now. Listen, I want that guy. What is his weight? Could we consider him in 105 or 95? 100 kilograms. We trained together yesterday. He is crazy strong. Can he make 95 kilos? Of course. Okay, that's good. Listen, Golemanov is one of those guys with incredible...
SPEAKER_01: like artistic ability you know he's doing art you know with the uh he's my teacher i have never seen him so strong like now yes he's standing for something for a classic sorry for crossing yeah yeah i i saw i saw them they match very close in 100 kilo uh with across the nationals
SPEAKER_01: we have in in uh one month national championship they will be right yeah yeah yeah anyway so i i i want i want to go to mono in east versus west for sure but i want to be incredible um there are some people that like you like how rustam in hooking like golemano is with the top role ability and i kind of believe that
SPEAKER_01: like top roll a great top roll is more of an art than hooking you know hooking is also art but the top roll that using the pronation hand control is engine he's my teacher what look what he created you see yeah yeah he he yeah i mean him to train someone who who became to level destroying alex kurdecha's wrist is incredible of course yeah
SPEAKER_01: listen guys expect i will be firing this side and firing that side both sides i will be going okay so let's go before you guys okay schoolboy versus leonidas alex i think you would have a good opinion about this um what do you think you know we'll be very shortly i put uh schoolboy because
SPEAKER_00: Firstly, even when he came last time to my place, he already started seriously. And now I see that he's growing in all his results. And Leonidas is also an awesome guy. Very awesome guy. They have a right-handed match, yes? Yes. Leonidas is very good and he improved. But still Skubo, in my opinion, improved a little bit more higher. And he also has a little bit more experience. So I think it will be good.
SPEAKER_00: But Leonidas' performance against Larry Woods was good, you know? Yeah, it was great. It was great for sure. He's actually improved, like, especially on left. For me, in my opinion, his left even greater than his right. But in left and right, he improved very, very fastly. And his level already serious. It's not like a level of the guy who was just training in the gym and make the YouTube video. He's really now arm wrestlers.
SPEAKER_04: He's become more and more to the higher level. But still, I will put Skubo like a favorite. And you, Georgi? I think he was in the same event with you, right? You were there, right? I think you were in Devon, right? Yes, it was December. I think that Skubo is with better advantage because of his experience and
SPEAKER_04: You know, he knows how to play better than Leonidas. For sure. And this will be the reason that he will beat him. For me, Skuboy will take the win. Maybe 60-40%. I just don't know who is really stronger. If somehow it goes there, if somehow it goes to the bicep to bicep, what will happen? I don't know, but I think that Skuboy will top him. Top him, okay.
SPEAKER_00: And Arsene Villiers versus Brendan Assessor. Shortly, I saw that Arsene now like come back to his shape and it seems like his muscles memory worked perfectly. Of course, it's not the same Arsene like in the past, but... But he's coming back quick, right? Like the size and everything. Yeah, for me, like when I watched how he trained, like it looks like his muscle memory really looks so perfectly
SPEAKER_00: working and he come back to his shape and you know also the table practice like uh it seems that he still have this this feeling of the table you know what i mean that he feels how to move on the table he don't lost it and uh but even if he will be not in his best shape i uh it seems for me that it will be enough to win this match and you you georgie i think that arsene will destroy him he's
SPEAKER_04: very strong and very very clever very fast very dangerous guy he's okay one of my favorite army source okay if if arson wins this one
SPEAKER_01: which I really don't know because I don't think that you can be away 11 years and you can have a great endurance if somehow it becomes necessary. If somehow it becomes necessary, then it is just like we can see a big, huge upset there. If somehow it gets stopped and then the match goes to the endurance, 11 years, no pulling, and then three months of training,
SPEAKER_01: Not sure if you can have that, if your arm is pumped, everything, whatever. So if somehow Arsene wins, what is his chance to become the best 105 in the world? Not now, but just say in one and a half years, two years. Big chances for me. How do you see him against someone like Prudnik, someone like Dadikyan and other guys? Very big chances for me. He is amazing poor.
SPEAKER_04: does it does it does this uh success have anything to do with the personality the character of the person and how determined the person is how like no I just know how powerful he is I I know because I we were together playing so many years and I know what he was doing and if he is in his very best shape of him he will be very very strong
SPEAKER_00: And what do you think? Do you think he can become best, Alex? If he starts to plan to come back, I'm for sure he's very serious to come back. I don't believe that he can come back just to, you know... No, no, no. He's very serious. He's very serious. Come back for, you know, to his best shape. And when he will be in the best shape, if we compare his matches in the past, he was beat guys like, you know, like Ziplankov.
SPEAKER_00: know even if he was exhausted the match was yeah but he was still pulled with the guys from super heavyweights without any problem you know yeah and uh for me actually it will be the answer does arm wrestling go higher than previous years if he will be not able to beat daddy khan prudnik of somebody of these guys it means that arm wrestling really goes
SPEAKER_00: you know, very high. If he will be able to beat everyone, it means that the kings of the old school are better than the new kings. Okay. Michael Todd versus Frank Lamparelli. Very interesting match, honestly. Very interesting. Special match. I see that Frank now in a good shape.
SPEAKER_00: His preparation going according to the plan. And Michael also very good. His last match with Pablo shows that he's healed his injuries and he's in a good shape now. Maybe not his best shape, but he's already ready to go to the stage. And for me, they're almost equal. It looks like they're almost equal. I know that Frank for sure will be trying to go to the triceps. He will be not just trying to take the wrists.
SPEAKER_00: He will be pushing also side and also going to the triceps. But does he will be able to do this? It's about Michael. Because for me, if Michael will be in his best shape, he will be stronger. But the question, does he will be in his best or like in his good shape but not best shape? That's the question for me. There's a problem with Michael to finishing him.
SPEAKER_04: That part is very, very hard. How do you see, Georgi, this match? I think it will be a very interesting match. Maybe 50-50 match. I agree with Alex. I think that Frank will take control of the hand, but it will be very difficult to finish the match. I don't know how it will go. Maybe 50-50. I have another question for you guys.
SPEAKER_04: um do you guys see michael as a threat for yourselves as well for me yes because big big michael top well prepared is dangerous and to finish yeah for me i can say that he's uh it will be not only if if michael
SPEAKER_01: arrives summer without any loss he also has matched with lars from norway uh winner of you guys would you consider pulling him or not i want to pull him it's dream match for me he is a legend and i want to pull everybody so the same thing would be the same for me he is interesting because i never saw somebody
SPEAKER_00: like beat him in the style of not pure press. You know, of course, the press is like most effective style. But for me, it's interesting because he's not he's not so usual. He's not usual guy. He's very strong. He's very durable. And he's King move like he's the founder of King. Yeah, he's like a guy who create this. And by the long period, it was very big, you know,
SPEAKER_01: hardness to top rowers or even for other guys who are not top rowers to beat Michael. That's why I think the Michael is a special one. Okay, let's go to the last matches. This one I only ask for the name of the winner. Svetko versus Kurdeca. Okay.
SPEAKER_00: I think 55% for me against 45%. For him, right? Is it because you are being nice to him or this is exactly what you believe? I think that this is my real prediction, what I really think. And Alex? Honestly, like to be very honest. Okay, very honest. It will be not easy match for sure for Georgi and for myself because...
SPEAKER_00: It will be like you said about the wrist. And for sure in the first round, both of us will be trying to take the wrist of everyone. And I watched the matches of Georgie with Devon, with Zaur, with other guys. And it seems like he is, like I said, endurable and his wrist is very strong. And for sure I will try to take that wrist. It's a very big interest for me.
SPEAKER_00: But if I need to be objective and sideways say about the chances, I put 50-50. 50-50. So I kind of expect really tough match. I don't think it's going to be an easy match.
SPEAKER_01: because I really I mean like I don't think that one will have the risk control like this like if like this is possible this is not possible I think the risk of both of you I think you both will be in like a brachioradialis back pressure and then and then I think you guys will have a war
SPEAKER_01: And who has the better wrist? I don't know. And then I think they will be the winner. Also, endurance can be an important factor because we saw Gyorgy having the endurance of many matches, especially we saw against Devon. If you have the same type of endurance, then I think we will be watching one of the most unforgettable matches ever.
SPEAKER_01: I don't expect this to be easy. I don't think that neither of you can control each other's pronation and neither of you have that incredible pressure without the wrist, you know, that way that you can just open each other's arms. So I think that both of you are incredible about the hand-wrist pronation. But when it comes to the pressure, I don't think that you guys can dominate each other.
SPEAKER_01: And so that is why I think there will be a battle, like, at the center. But who knows? Who knows? I was thinking that if you would just take crack a little bit, or Gheorghe's wrist, you would finish it. But when Gheorghe said that he had a five-minute match, not five minutes, but five minutes ago, I think, before that match, he had another top match with Slav. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, so it little bit changes. That is why.
SPEAKER_01: like tournaments matches like should not affect the results of the super match ranking or the super matches like super match ranking is should not be affected by tournaments
SPEAKER_01: yeah because this is totally different you may lose the guy three times and then you can come back and beat him four times if it was tournament you know you would lose one time you go to the b side pull 10 guys there and then come back and then pull the guy who only had five matches while we had 10 matches because he beat you at the round one you know yeah yeah anyway so david samusha versus aydar khan last three matches
SPEAKER_00: I will pick Samusha just because I want him to put Guinness records in the defending of the belts. Yeah, he won seven times. So it will be eight. Yeah. Okay, and you? Were you guys a little bit impressed when Aydarhan beat Vala? Yeah, I was impressed. Yeah, I was thinking that Vala will be the winner.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, Vala actually beat Sarmat at the AMC. And Vala said that they didn't even put that match on internet, that match, you know. So, and beating, Aydar Khan beating, flashing Vala like that four times, you know. Three times, I think he won 3-1, yeah. It was very impressive, you know. What do you think, Georgi? I think it will be interesting match. But Samushio will stop him and...
SPEAKER_04: he will beat him. Not easy, but he will beat him. Samusha will beat him? Yes. With endurance? Yes, with endurance. He will stop him because the other one has stronger hit, but he will stop him and slowly he will beat him, in my opinion. We will see. Were you guys impressed by Alexander?
SPEAKER_01: Vladimir Miro, but Alexander according to Travis. Alexander is the best, yeah. Alexander, yeah. Listen, there was only one close to that one is you, Alex. Your name is only Alex, right? Not Alexander, Alex. Yeah, that's why I think he don't call me Alexander because it's easier to spell Alex, not Alexander.
SPEAKER_00: uh-huh yeah i think you are the only one that makes sense a little bit okay last two matches and very very interesting ones hermes casparini versus alicia murado i will tell hermes if you watched this video prove to these guys that i support you not because you are my friend but you're really strong just prove everyone who now says that you have no chance
SPEAKER_00: You know that you have the chances. You know, both of us already know it after what we do in Italy. You know and believe in yourself. How was it?
SPEAKER_01: How was it when you tried to hook him? I will not say nothing. No, no, no. You don't need to tell me how the training went, but you can tell me how difficult to hook Hermes. Is it like difficulty level? How is it like 105 kilo Alijan hooking him? I would say in this way that he improved very highly. He improved very, very highly. And remember then,
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, Muratov is great. Absolutely great. I understand why everyone put him like a favorite. But it also will be a difference in the highest position of the setup. And if Hermes will do everything correctly, if he will be a little bit faster on the start, and he will be smart on the setup, I really believe he can do it. And you, Georgi?
SPEAKER_01: I think Ermes will beat him. Not easy, but he will beat him. He will top roll him, in my opinion. He is a bigger guy. Ali Can beat the super heavyweights even. But I don't think Ali Can has ever met such a top roll specialist like Ermes.
SPEAKER_04: Like, to beat someone like Ali Can, I don't think it is possible to do with the power unless you are just an animal. 2022 on the Worlds in Turkey, I had a very difficult match with one Lithuanian guy. We killed each other. After Ali Can played against him, he couldn't beat him. They gave him two fouls.
SPEAKER_04: Oh, Alijan. It was Gabchenko or somebody else? It was Gabchenko? Gabchenko beat Alijan, but I mean that Alijan couldn't beat this guy. They go and hook, and the referee stopped foul. Again he hook, Alijan couldn't move him for a centimeter, and they gave him two fouls from the other guy. Yeah, but sometimes Alijan waits, waits, waits, waits, waits, and then he surges, you know.
SPEAKER_01: Also, remember, Ali Can, there was around 94-95 kilos. Right now, the guy is over 105 kilos. So, he's a different guy. But, yeah, I understand what you're saying. So, who's winning? You say that Hermes is going to top? I think Hermes will beat him, in my opinion. Very clever and very prepared. Okay, let's go to the main one.
SPEAKER_01: Is Levan Saginashvili the strongest armwrestler we have ever seen in the history of armwrestling? In my opinion, yes. I don't think, I cannot imagine anyone, best of Levan, like that person is beating Levan. I cannot, I have been around for more than 30 years. I don't think anyone could beat him.
SPEAKER_01: I agree he's strongest for sure yeah but like yes he's strongest but what else you think that like who could beat him do you think someone could beat him I think in one year maybe yes no no no no I'm talking about from here to the past we don't know we don't talk about future future is just
SPEAKER_01: We just only think. No, about that, I don't see anyone. Like his current shape, I mean, or last one year, two years, three years, you know. And what do you think, Georgi? I think you are right. He's the strongest armistice for all time. Maybe only Mindaugas could be the coach. Or Alexander. Alexander, yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Anyway, so this guy, okay, I don't know if we talked with you, Georgi, about this one, but I'm going to ask Alex. Alex, do you think that Devon progressed or not after especially these stem cell things, or you think that there is nothing special with him? He for sure progressed, especially in very needed area where he wants to progress. He progressed in his wrist.
SPEAKER_00: He progressed into an opener. He progressed in this mood to go out of the table on that direction where he's open and not so effective by the side pressure and the making an attack into the fingers. He's actually very understand our wrestling and how to pull with the guys who, for example, stronger in the side, stronger in the back, in the side pressure, in the control. And he knows where to go to avoid
SPEAKER_00: all these traps and he put his own trap on the table and that's the key because now i believe he's stronger for sure he's for sure stronger than his previous version and i believe he also will be more tricky now he will be not tricky because he already pulled once so now he know what to expect and i believe he prepared something more than previous match
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I also believe that, yeah, I think he has more of this. Like, just remember his Dennis match. I was thinking they both will go outside or something. He actually holding low and went sideways and then this, but he never left here. And how do you see this, Gergely? Do you think that he's getting better compared to his first match?
SPEAKER_04: I think that Devon is much stronger than the first match. It's different Devon and he already knows how the match will go because he played against Levan and he will be more and more dangerous than the first match. He will exactly know what to train and what to do. He is very dangerous.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, but who is the favorite on the paper? For me, favorite is Levan. But I mean, this match will be so more interested than previous. And now I don't put Levan like a high favorite. I put him like a slight favorite now. In this situation, what I see in the training process of Levan, of his pure power, for sure he's a favorite. But because of improving results of
SPEAKER_00: Devon because of his experience of previous match and I believe he will prepare something else and I believe he will be the strongest version especially in the can opener move in his wrist I think it will be awesome match just awesome match and great match and okay I'm still putting 11 like a slight favorite but I believe that match can be interesting
SPEAKER_00: Alex, when you say awesome match, when I hear awesome match, I'm thinking about a tough match. Is it possible it to be a tough match and Levan winning? Yeah, I honestly think that Levan also now understand there is possibilities that Devon will stop him there and probably he also prepares something. I don't saw like this clues that he will be
SPEAKER_00: press in the triceps by flop press or just going more by side but not concentrated just on the wrist because he understands that Devon will be hunting on his wrist Devon will be hunting on his fingers Devon will be trying to find the weaknesses in his wrist and I believe that also Levan now little bit played I don't believe that Levan shows he's really
SPEAKER_00: I don't believe that Hikaru 130 kilos and this is his maximum because I know what is my result. I know Georgi probably agree with me. It's not the result of Levan. I think he just not show his best movements and also maybe playing a little bit. Do you think that Levan, if he's worried about his wrist, he should be trying to make it stronger or he should just already give up
SPEAKER_01: then maybe i should train this no he for sure will be trying to make it stronger he already did it and i think he will be very careful about the setup to not spend the power in not necessary movement what is the percentage you see that like levan is losing his list fifty forty five fifty five twenty five yeah forty five okay so forty five percent do you see
SPEAKER_00: leon losing the match without losing his wrist i see that he will be able still able to pull even if it will be not like open because i think it will be not like highly open but still it will be a little bit open he'll be still able and i believe that he trained these moments he will be still able to push by shoulder by anything because i believe that he understand that it can't happen and if
SPEAKER_00: For example, if in the most matches they won't stop somebody there, it's the end of the story. And I believe Levan wants to avoid the ending of the story. And that's why he prepared something else. Okay, what I'm just saying is that if Levan's wrist stays like this, is there still a possibility for him to lose the match? Nope, I don't believe it. So this is the possibility? And if this...
SPEAKER_00: the previous version like this it will be interesting very interesting match and i believe that it can happen but if like you showed absolutely opened yeah so i don't think he will open like this unless he puts pressure himself otherwise the world case he will be like this here yeah i also think like this and and in georgie i think that
SPEAKER_04: Levan has a bigger chance, but if Devon stops him somewhere, the endurance of Devon is much higher level and he will beat him. But for me, Levan will beat him. I don't think that Devon can stop him. But do you think that there is no chance at all?
SPEAKER_01: there is chance how much like 30 percent 40 percent like I just tried maybe 40 chance they want to stop him somewhere and and then if he stops him he's winning if if they will stop he is the winner for me 60 percent Levan is gonna dominate this match and there is 40 percent of chance that
SPEAKER_04: Devon is going to stop him and beat him. And you are saying this by being someone who actually pulled both guys in competition, but Levon with the warp shape, you know? Yeah, yeah, yeah. This is my opinion because I think that the heat of Levon is the strongest, but this is different to Devon, you know, and there is possibility to top him somewhere, to catch him. And if the match goes in this direction, it will be a very big problem for Levon.
SPEAKER_01: When Devon went outside, I don't know which round was it, fourth round? And then when Gennady was able to press him like this, but I don't think Levan has the same ability of Gennady here. But I will tell you something, I kind of don't believe that Levan is making any plan, even though
SPEAKER_01: is still considering if it happens i would do this but i think his game plan is mostly risk control and pin him you know i don't think he's making his efforts to be prepared for love priests but yeah but who knows you know life like you should be ready for everything you know yeah for sure or i believe for sure that he will be starting like you say but i believe that probably
SPEAKER_01: will not like give up if uh wrist will be open and he will stay stately trying to do something and i believe that maybe on the training he trying to do this yeah but listen if your wrist is already injured i'm not sure if you want to risk your like this way pressure you know i think that like more of control is better for his previous injury you know i think that like having flop and pressing like this if i had the wrist injury i am not sure if i would really
SPEAKER_01: Who knows? Anyways, guys, we are here for one hour and 13 minutes and let's finish it. I thank you guys very, very much. Do you guys want to say anything to each other before the before real meeting and or anything to the fans or anything, you know, just before we finish?
