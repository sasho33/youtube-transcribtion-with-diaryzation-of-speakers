Thanks, everyone, for joining us. How many episodes have you guys done?
SPEAKER_02: three four we did like three or four and then it was like uh i think we're doing pretty good but we're all too up in our own lives so this is like we're gonna call this the phoenix episode the back from the action from the action i like it hey so guys how are you guys all doing summer is good good how about you
SPEAKER_02: i'm doing good who you are i'm wrestling next we gotta talk about that we gotta get into that i don't want to talk too much to you guys because we'll burn up all the good dialects on the yeah i'm pulling live right now yeah yeah we're live we're live oh okay so what's up man who ray how you doing i'm doing great that was that was great setting this up you know ray's intro was how many of these have you guys done oh yeah
SPEAKER_02: That's what I'm saying. I thought this guy was over here giving me the quiz so he could have some info. You know what I'm saying? No. Jesus, Ray. Way to sabotage the guy. What I do notice, though, is today wasn't shoulder day for Paul. I like that. You got a full shirt on. You're not half naked and your traps aren't up. Monday, International Chest Day, man. I got to wear a tight, snug-fitting chest-type shirt. I like it. Hey, some things never change. I feel like I'm back at my high school reunion.
SPEAKER_02: like five ten years later and some they just don't change i like it doug and paul are still the same it's still doug the thug and paul still got that all-american swagger i like it look at that doug so ray of course ryan you're right ray's pulling right now still flexing
SPEAKER_02: Hey, Rob, Rob, remember what he did to us in that picture? Yeah, he did us filthy. Oh, it was terrible. I'm still out angling people to this day. He did us so dirty. Listen, Doug, only one guy in that picture knew what was going on in that picture, and he was the winner. It's like starting a race when you're the guy who says go. He fucking won. I specifically said. And then said go.
SPEAKER_03: I specifically said no flexing, and then I was like. He took a full step forward, oiled his arm up, and flexed the shit out of it. He's about 30 pounds lighter than us, and we look tiny, shameful. Yeah, he looked like he was the 225 guy. We looked like we were 176ers. That's some bullshit. Man, I still out-angle people to this day. That's what I do. Well, that's the game, bro.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, back to what you had asked Ray. He's got Ryan that just that match just got made recently. Short notice. I like that match. I like that match because I want to see where he's at because. He seems real nice and respectful, but he was hitting me up in my my comment section a lot wanting to pull and I know he's done it with some other people. He's a hungry guy trying to get out there so.
SPEAKER_02: It'd be interesting to see him pull somebody that's had some world experience that's been around a little bit. So, Coach Ray, you get to be what we call the gatekeeper, I guess. Yeah. Well, what are you going to come in weighing? Because I know it's a 95 kg match. I mean, 95 is heavy for you. You're not going to be 95 coming in. Heavy? I thought he was always a 220 guy. Ray.
SPEAKER_03: Ray's always a 220 guy, wasn't he? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, Ray's like a 105 kg normally. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: no don't listen to him i'm 85 i'm 85 i'm pulling 80s but i'll be like 89 let's see just i'm not even i'm not i'm not thinking about gaining weight it will not help me the strength and health is the most important right how much notice did you have when you found out about that match four weeks last week
SPEAKER_01: nice yeah i love it i was i was still training it was like nothing different i just look up how he's pulling i'll try to you know kind of see where his style is versus mine and what can i use against it and nothing i think you're gonna like his style yeah he's gonna go where you wanna be he's gonna go around i think yeah i think i think you guys are gonna match up real nice with each other and it's gonna be uh you're gonna be happy with how it feels
SPEAKER_02: What's the prediction? Let's just cut it right now, Aymeric. Let's get to the prediction. Do we have a prediction on that match? I'm going 3-1, 3-0, 3-1, 3-0, Ray. I like that. That's exactly where I was going. I was thinking maybe in the early rounds, Ryan might have enough torque and a little bit of an angle to feel out. He might get that one. I think Ray's going to be sticky enough and enduring enough
SPEAKER_02: more so probably stronger and more polished than a hook uh so i'm going three one three zero as well is is this the picture yeah yeah look at that and doug's sitting at single digit body fast i'm over here like a tub just like oh i'll tell my black shirt because everyone knows fat people wear blacks and slimming dad's over here doing doing a full skull crusher with his hand
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I'm cutting weight here too, you know, like that's supposed to be the lean version of me there. I look fat. Doug looks like jacked in ways. Doug looks like he's ready to be like the next C-bomb. And we're over here like we're the fucking goons just ready to get him some drinks and towels at the pool. I mean, that flex itself is impressive.
SPEAKER_02: He has every muscle group, every single muscle in his arm flexed, from his forearm to his shoulder. But that's why he took the right side and angled that way. He did. He stuck me in the back, all narrow-shouldered and shit. He got right underneath that fluorescent light bulb, too. Right. Doug, I thought we were friends. Doug said it for months. He waited for this for months. He knew exactly what he was doing. It was planned. It was planned.
SPEAKER_02: sorry it's douglas you got it looks good douglas yeah douglas senior yeah so what's the drama going on drama in the arm wrestling world let's get into it i don't want to get into some lame about predictions i'll predict coach reg because he's here hosting us and i actually like that match i'm interested in that match yeah some of the other ones i didn't give my prediction
SPEAKER_03: I've never pulled with Ryan. But I was in Florida. I was in Florida for the finals with him. I got to watch him pull. And I got to after pull with, you know, a couple people that he went against. And if that is any, like, inkling of, like, where his level is, I think his level in hook is pretty good. Rob, have you ever trained with that Vladimir guy that used to train up there with Bresnan and them? Yeah. The Eastern European. I've only pulled him in a tournament. I never trained with him.
SPEAKER_03: They had a war. They had, like, a war, and Ryan beat him. And I after pulled with him, and he was sticky. He was really sticky. He was tough. So I put him slightly over that level. I mean, I think, if anything, the biggest factor could be the weight because Ryan, I think, cut a lot of weight to get to 209. He's a bigger dude. But I know he carries a lot of it lower body. Yeah, he's got big legs, it looks like. Yeah, I think it could be a close match. But I think if Ryan wins, he has to win 3-0.
SPEAKER_02: because i think that sneaky oppa talk roll though remember that that oppa that top roll that he pulled out with bowen now yeah i know ryan bowen wants that to be buried but i'm the boogeyman man i'm a gravedigger i'll come back and bring that up i do remember when coach ray top roll ryan bowen that
SPEAKER_02: Man, if I ever got... There's a few times in my life I got a bone that was like comparable with titanium or granite or shit like that. And that match, when you top rolled him, it wasn't beating him. When you top rolled him, when he said his wrist was fucking unbreakable or some weird shit, that gave me a bone that was legendary. Legendary bone. Let's go. I verify he sent me a picture. We talked about it right when it happened.
SPEAKER_02: yeah bro someone asked but when i pulled my pants down it looked like the guy from twilight in the sunlight it was like glistening it was it was crazy it was next level someone asked you a question uh rob he said what do you think about bowen's new physique since his name came up man what i could say about ryan bowen
SPEAKER_02: is that motherfucker, if there is a Pied Piper of arm wrestling that can get most of the people to follow him when he trumps his flute, it's Ryan fucking Bowen. Because it don't matter what that motherfucker does. It don't matter how hard he loses, how hard he falls flat on his ship. He'll fall flat on some ship and then just go to a new direction and act like, you know,
SPEAKER_02: he had an epiphany one night over a dream or a bowl of cheerios or some start oracle something's crazy and then all of a sudden the guy changes direction and everyone believes it now i'm not saying i'm not gonna be foolish enough to say ryan bowen's not strong and not a good arm wrestler and not even a smart guy the problem is he overshoots so much and i think again he's overshooting and it's unjust like this guy's finding himself in matches
SPEAKER_02: In any other combat sport, when you're on a losing trajectory the way he is, you just fucking, like, got to grind again and go back into tournament mode. This guy keeps finding himself in matches. His current physique, I don't know, man. Like, he's still, like, without being cruel but being direct. It's a regular guy that works out a little bit. Like, I go to Planet Fitness to see 20 guys in my local Planet Fitness look just like him.
SPEAKER_02: It's not overly muscular. It's not overly lean. If you're not walking the line, like really big guys that look good with their clothes on might have a high body fat count, but they're yoked. And then there's those skinny guys that look like shit with their clothes on, but they're shredded. Maybe you find a hybrid in between, but he's none of that shit. He's just like the dad who's got a little bit of leanness and a little bit of muscularity. He looks like a guy who works out a little bit.
SPEAKER_03: You guys can say that's hate and shit, but that's just my eyeballs from being around gyms and shit my whole life. No, yeah, I get it. Lost a lot of weight real quick. I don't know what the deal is with that, but... I mean, honestly, the way I describe the physique is like skinny fat. He still looks a little... He still looks like that soft look, but... We got a super chat from Ryan, your opponent. Ray, I'll read it since you're his opponent. I beat Jordan Sill, Dallas Langston...
SPEAKER_01: And Brent Rager, June 1st, hooked all of them, if that tells you anything. He's good, man. He's good. I mean… That's very impressive. Yeah. I'm expecting him to be really, really strong. Yeah, I think people just don't know him, and that's kind of… Everyone always goes for people they know, right? But I'm taking him very seriously. I think he's… Like, there's a reason he won the qualifier, right? I'm assuming he's meaning that round robin, the 220 round robin.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, yeah. No, Robbins are sneaky. We all know that. I'm not going to discount a whim, but. Yeah, I think that's a pretty good representation of his level. Like, he's a tough guy to keep out of a hook. And when he gets there, he's really good there, too. You know, he's good at forcing that lane, I think. And, you know, like common barometers, he's going to be strong in there.
SPEAKER_02: I think it's going to come down to some slight nuances, you know, and I think that weight might play a big factor, the difference in weight. Well, I watched the replay. I didn't even know he beat those guys. I'm going to stick with my original guess because I remember watching that round, Robin, and I do believe that there was some match factors. I'm not saying...
SPEAKER_03: He didn't earn those wins, but when you start taking the edge off people and you get into round three, four, five, eight, it comes down to who had easier rounds. Yeah, I mean, and I do remember, I don't know if he pulled Brent before or not, but Brent had some wars. And I don't remember. I watched the replay of the round, Rob, and I skipped over all of Ryan's because I didn't know who he was and didn't care. So I know you're watching, Ryan. I just wanted you to know that. I skipped all your matches.
SPEAKER_03: I didn't even know that just now. It's news to me. I didn't know until just now. Brian. Shark ran through that class, didn't he? Yeah, yeah. Shark won. Arsene was second. I think who was – Craig was third? Who was third? Craig Dooley? Yeah. I'm not sure Craig was.
SPEAKER_03: No, I don't think Craig was third. I think Craig ended up in, like, fourth or something like that. No, he was fourth. Ryan was fourth. Ryan was number four. Wow. Well, the Craig I felt last Saturday, Jesus. I don't know how anybody's beating that guy around 200 right now. That's a match that I think is – I love Tom. Tom's a great guy, and I think –
SPEAKER_03: I think maybe it's closer at 85 if Craig has to cut more or something. I don't, maybe, I don't know, but I know Tom Holland and Craig are pulling on the 14th. I just think it's, I just think it's a mismatch. Unless, unless Tom comes in with like a different approach to set up. Craig is a tricky one. Rob, you know, I know Rob. But did you see what that kid, did you see what that kid did with, uh,
SPEAKER_01: That guy in Artem Lars. Merlo? I thought Tom was in Artem Lars. No, no, no. Artem Gods. He beat Oleg. Oleg Dudourian. Yeah, and he's legit. But the problem is it's different styles, right? Craig kind of hits high and over and real fast.
SPEAKER_01: and tom kind of catches like this right and i think if he would catch like this much better because then he can stop him but if you go low you kind of help craig just to go and craig is so fast ridiculously fast yeah sorry tom sounds too though thomas fast i just feel like that's what i felt uh saturday i'm just not sure like i know you beat you beat tom right right
SPEAKER_01: yeah yeah in a war in a war but again i have the style for that right right uh there's matches that are you know better and not better for you everyone knows them so you know like uh we hate top rollers me and paul lynn so that's normal be a top roller i got i got identity issues
SPEAKER_03: but you know that uh ryan is pulling um shark andrei shakovich yeah i don't understand that and he he keeps on talking about he's like 93 94 kg or something it's 105 i think they set it up at 105. it has to go down it has to go down i just saw something where he read off his doctor's report from his shoulder injury and it's like bad and i'm like what are you even pulling for
SPEAKER_02: What the fuck, man? We're over here with a torn labrum or whatever the fuck he's got, and he's taking a high-level match. I don't know what the fuck to believe over here. Like, there's one minute saying, like, I got a torn rotator cuff. The next minute you're saying I'm pulling one of the best 220 guys in North Aymeric. Like, what kind of bullshit are we serving over here? What are we doing? Well, I just want you to know I have a fanny pack now. I just wanted to say that. So...
SPEAKER_03: I will be rocking this at West versus West. That's what happens when you spend enough time with Artem, right? Yeah, yeah. Artem got that for you. Except it's not a knockoff Louis Vuitton. Hey, but you know the bullshit is? It's probably turbo useful. You probably love it. Oh, I'm going to have a place for my chapstick now and my makeup case and my mirror, you know?
SPEAKER_02: yeah i could tell a white called whenever i talked to one oh my god chapsticks they would have launched you right off a roof in my crew homie holy hey hey hey i'm also gonna have some brass knuckles in there dude so right it's no so people don't steal your chapstick i get it they don't steal my chat any dry lip coming to you and getting beat down
SPEAKER_01: don't touch anybody looking like they got dried inchworms on their face is getting punched i want to hear more about both uh doug and and hunters beef what's going on there holy smokes i like that one i like that one too i heard yeah i heard he called you the past
SPEAKER_02: I already called you ancient history. He's treating you like something he read in a book once, like King Tut, King Doug, all wrapped up in his sarcophagus over here, old and shit, like we're bringing you back from the dead with a fucking spell and doing arm wrestlers, motherfucker. Dude, I swear, he keeps on saying the last match I won was in 1987. I'm like, so... You actually won when Lincoln Shaw won. Stay in the actual year. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: It's like a switch. I don't know, man. He talks a lot of shit. It's good. I'm glad he's confident. I mean, I don't want him to come in at his best. I mean, he's been doing good. And, I mean, maybe he is the next up and coming, but not this year. It ain't going to be this year.
SPEAKER_01: I like how you turned away a match from pulling the goat just to pull him. I like that even better because you were supposed to pull, but you were like, no, no, no. The greatness can wait. Hey, that's the power of sales, bro. Online sales. You too, but I won't get one free. Engin told me that that match will always be there. So I was like, you know what? Fuck it. Let's do it.
SPEAKER_02: Well, it makes sense in my mind, right? If there are two guys that are, let's say, stars at that weight class, why not find out the best representative from North Aymeric and then send them out there? So if you are in fact the best representative or if there's somebody better, let's cut that before we put them on the world stage. You got to at least know who's your best guy. For me, it's mind-boggling, but I understand how big United States is, right? That Paul Talbott and Vrej has never pulled.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah. Right. And since 2019 or 18. Right. So check this out. So check this out. I've been pulling for 15 years. All right. I've never pulled Corey Miller. I've never pulled Luke Kent. I've never pulled Sam Harris. Like during that run, that whole run where we were all winning shit, I never ran into him.
SPEAKER_03: it's it's wild like the way it winds up we don't have that organization you guys have like nationals has been dead since when i got started that was the first time i met doug seven years ago was the last nationals and it wasn't even big so like during that entire timeline that reg has been here that paul and brej have been on the opposite side of the country thousands of miles away there hasn't been any amount of money or enough hype to bring everybody together since february
SPEAKER_03: And I like that. I really like that. That's what keeps a little bit of like, so, you know, Devon always talks about how Georgia is only 3 million people, but they're so close together. And even when they're far apart, they're so close together, they can all train together. Being here in the United States, me and Rob and Paul got to fly to each other if we want to even have a practice. Yeah. Boston has the same population as Georgia. Right.
SPEAKER_03: And we tried to do it in the level of coordination that it takes to get like a high level practice or even a one-on-one with a high level dude, depending on where you're located is really, really hard. Not to mention having six to eight of those guys every week. I think that really associates the organization of those countries and the proximity of so important. And then you take a look at Kazakhstan, the organization that they have in their training team is unreal. Yeah. Yeah. Facilities are really,
SPEAKER_02: i mean there are guys that were at the top of the food chain that i didn't pull for a 10-year run and they were at the top where they came from and i was at the top where i came from and we just never bumped into each other we would travel but we would always miss each other at different events and that's just the way it happens you know the easiest solution for this guys in your opinion big money debut i will say this when wal was around it brought a lot of people together that
SPEAKER_03: didn't really ever match up, but then Corey never pulled it. So he never pulled Justin and, you know, Justin and Corey have never pulled either. So it's like, you know, I can pop in on that. I think if, if, if for a cultivation standpoint, if we started using the nationals,
SPEAKER_02: as a free way to cultivate the next step onto the professional stage professional stage being king of the table or uh east versus west or whatever that you have to win nationals to represent your country top two top three instead of going to worlds you have an option if you place in your nationals you can now either go to wolf worlds if you want to ifa
SPEAKER_02: or onto the stage, that will bring bigger numbers. With bigger numbers and heavier hitters, almost make an West versus West king of the table qualifier a national. Then you start getting better people at nationals. My first nationals had John Brzenk, Ron Bath, Travis, Tim Bresnan,
SPEAKER_02: uh matt girdner um chad silvers craig everybody who was anybody in each class was in that class and now you go to a nationals and it's like anyone who thinks they can make a bucket around robin or a super match you don't even get top five in each class there unless it's in their town
SPEAKER_03: So, yeah, I love that idea, if we can get the traction behind it, because there's been so much question about, like, you know, why did this last, our finals, our qualifier finals didn't do well. And I think there's a number of reasons why that could have been. Because guys still can't get on the matches, right?
SPEAKER_03: I'm interested to hear what you guys think as to why. We hosted that thing down in sunny Florida. We had payouts. Through two years, we gave away $26,000, and we still had some classes that had five guys in them. Yeah, nobody showed up.
SPEAKER_02: Social media will kill that. All they got to hear is people start doing the math. They go, okay, I can win that class. Then they hear somebody else is coming. They go, okay, I might take second. Then they hear someone else is coming. They go, I might take third. And the next thing you know, if they start seeing themselves based on their expenses versus what they might win, they bow out. And then the other 99% of the field probably does the same. And the two big swinging dicks who think they can win it fight each other.
SPEAKER_02: or the guy who's local who doesn't have any money to spend takes a swing at it we gotta find a way to structure it where it's not that it's an option it's your only pathway like if you want to get here
SPEAKER_02: this is the way you have to do it you have to win your states you have to win your regionals you have to win your nationals and that's it like if you don't win it you you go next year because a lot of these people ducking out trying to find sideline ways get a little loud on social media go other alternate routes hitting people up in the dms that noise it should be like a a legitimate like we do with wrestling in the olympics boom
SPEAKER_02: I do agree with what Engin just said in the comments. Devon't know about nationals, but WAF world's level is way above IFA. I mean, it definitely is. The amount of countries. Yeah, I agree with that. I agree. I know. I know. I was just saying as a way to at least bring in people to you have to do A to get to B. You have to do B to get to C. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: When you go to high school wrestling, you can't just go for a national championship. You have to win your high school, then you have to win your states, then you have to win your regions, then you have to win your fucking, then you go to nationals. But it's a process. You can't just go from one to the other without going through a process. And there's pride with each step you take. Now it's just kind of like people show up at nationals that never even won a fucking tournament because they want to be in the environment and go, oh, I took fifth at nationals.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, because like six guys showed up. With six people in the class. Yeah. Rob and Doug, explain to me what shifted. Because if I'm not mistaken, from what I talked to most of you guys that have been around for a long time and the other guys that have been around for a long time, it used to be that way. That Nationals were something that everybody showed up to. Nationals was huge. Honestly, in my opinion. Why is it different now?
SPEAKER_03: When UAL and WAL started, when UAL came around and then WAL came around, that's really what did it because that's where the money was. That's where the stardom was. That's where, and it just kind of weeded out those nationals that handed out a trophy and people didn't care about them anymore. It was more prestigious to win one of those tournaments, a wall tournament. I agree.
SPEAKER_02: 100%. So Nationals, you would see Ron Bath, John Brzenk, all the guys we would put on Mount Rushmore at a Nationals, staying all weekend, mind you, having a fucking blast, great times. And guys stopped going because they started seeing it as an avenue to...
SPEAKER_02: Could I actually make money on this? And if someone's going to pay me, well, I'm not going to go out there and risk my arm and risk my limbs. And then everyone else who felt like they could be at that caliber or out that caliber followed suit. So a lot of your A-listers immediately, once one or two dropped off, all dropped off and went in the chase. Then the guys who were close started kind of doing the same, thinking, well, if I train real hard and avoid the tournaments and save myself for the matches and call it out enough,
SPEAKER_02: Then maybe I can. So then what are you left with? Like a lower B list, C list type of group? Because those guys who thought they were on the cusp were like, if I have one good day, now I'm there. You know, like I use Justin Bishop a lot as an example. He went from obscurity to worldwide fame with like one pin. He went from being a country boy that had a fucking checkered hat on a checkered fedora roll tide.
SPEAKER_03: That stupid video. And all of a sudden I was like, okay, he's turbo legit because he beat a current world champion. I hate that video. I hate that video because I'm in that video and you hear me and I didn't know who Giannis was and I called him Janice and I'm like yelling and I'm my fat, my face is all fat and I'm like, Justin just beat Janice. Little did I know. I've only been in the sport for like two years. I had no idea who he really was.
SPEAKER_02: And God, I hate that video. But when people do some shit like that, that's what they save up for. And then when they can do it, it's human nature, right? You're going to always go for more, more, more, more. And I think we are in a cush society now. What we used to be very happy with, we're now very unsatisfied with.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, well, Ray, what kind of springboarded this conversation was Ray was like how to fix the people that have never pulled each other and stuff. I do feel like that Challenger series is an avenue that is like, you know, the Justin and Corey have never pulled. Could they pull there? Could, you know, not y'all two pulling, but Rob and Paul have never pulled. Could they pull there? You know what I mean? I'm just saying guys that have never pulled,
SPEAKER_02: Could it be lined up? You know what it is, guys? You're thinking like these are hot matches that people are just as curious about as you are. So now that we're seeing people get paid, we're like, let's get paid. We're back in the day just having the title of saying I'm the 2010 national champion was the big swinging dick of the country. And now it's like, I don't care what title I have. Justin give me some money. You got guys now.
SPEAKER_02: And I won't go on the witch hunt. I won't go down the rabbit hole because, believe me, at some point in time on this podcast, I'm going to go deep down a lot of rabbit holes. But this won't be one of them. But there's plenty of guys that go and will show up and show their ass and put their pride on the line and wash it like they have no self-respect. And they'll show up half-assed just for a paycheck. Ray, do your tournaments in Latvia pay out? Huh? I'm just kind of tying it together. Your tournaments in Latvia don't pay out?
SPEAKER_02: It's just trophies. Yeah, but that's a big thing probably. To be the big swinging dick in Latvia is probably a big deal. It is a big deal, yeah. You guys are a sport that's respected. You treat yourself with respect like athletes. And to be the number one guy, not just by talking shit, proving it, that's an accolade. And that's how it used to be here. Yeah, but it's hard, and I think it's very hard in this day and age.
SPEAKER_03: well it's hard it probably also it probably has to do with the lack of promoters throwing money at tournaments too because like in order to in order to be able to have either a super match card or a substantial payout it takes either one big investor who's looking long term and willing to lose money now or a whole bunch of little sponsors where you're going to go but i got you you guys ever play poker anyone here a poker player
SPEAKER_02: You know it. We already talked about this. Okay, so I usually go to satellite events. You can find them online, and you can find them in live. You have satellite events. Basically, whoever wins that event goes to the next level up of all the other winners of a satellite event.
SPEAKER_02: free you get nothing for it you might get a t-shirt or some but then you go and they want to find the best guy it's a free way to find the best guy to get to like the world series of poker it's a satellite event so where everybody knows that the elite of the elite of the elite where they lay whether it's bluff uh king of the table or uh
SPEAKER_02: know east first west you throw a bunch of satellite events but that is the banner the banner is you're winning your way into this we don't need you to sing we don't need to dance we don't even have a monkey on a crank box like this we don't need none of that just come here arm wrestle your balls off and if you keep winning we promise you you'll show up on one of them stages and if you make it
SPEAKER_02: without discrimination, where a motherfucker like John Brzenk, dare I say the name, John Brzenk doesn't get the free pass. If he goes on a losing cycle, he gets scuttled off into the fucking tournament section. Like he's going to be a fight club now to get back into the West versus West. He's going to make two decisions to retire or grind.
SPEAKER_02: And then that brings a lot of interest to those tournaments because now all of a sudden you have guys on losing cycles like Michael Todd and John Brzenk and Travis Bajan in the tournament series. And what's that do for eyeballs to the tournament series? Artem they going to charge? Artem they going to come back? Artem they going to have some vigor? Think about it. You can't discriminate and go, John will always have a place at West vs. West. Nah, man. Kick his ass right into the gutter. You were good. Now you're on a losing cycle just like all the other scrubs. We love you for what you did, but here's who you are now. We're sorry.
SPEAKER_02: Boom! That's what happens to your local tournaments with John Brzenk and all the local tournaments. Boom! That's what happens when everyone gets a trophy. You fuck your own tournament in the ass. We got to send him back down to the minor leagues. I vote... Every single person that's been on a double loss...
SPEAKER_02: I'll go in the minor leagues. Every person's on a double loss. Fuck it. Go to the minor leagues and scrap your way through like the gulag, like that shit in Spartacus. Fucking fight your way through, motherfucker. You know what I'm saying? The idea is good. The idea is good. Slight subject change. I know Rob actually has a match coming up soon. Did y'all know that? No. Who is it? Yeah, Rob's pulling out in September. Yeah. September?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, early September. That motherfucker, Alan Ford. If it goes the way it should go, it should be uneventful. But I fear that life's circumstances will always play a role for me. You got history with Alan, don't you? Huh? You got history with Alan, right? Yeah. Yeah, we got history. And I just don't want it to be a John Brzenk, Todd Hutchings story.
SPEAKER_02: So John Brzenk was always, like, had that edge over Todd where he would just, like, bust that ass, except for that first encounter when he was surprised. But he was always, like, a good notch over Todd. And then the last encounter, like, through the years and the weathering and the beatdowns and everything, Todd got the last. That's what went down in his history. Yeah. Oh, there was a period of time where Allen. I think I'm strong, but I think I have some vulnerability with some injuries that are looming.
SPEAKER_02: There was a period of time where Allen was considered the best 200-205, one of the best, if not the best 200-205 for a while. Allen was in the conversation. At one point in time, he was good because he flashed Todd Hutchings. He got some good wins, but I feel like it all hit in a perfect matrix. I feel like I pulled him when he was really training hard and doing really well.
SPEAKER_02: and i was kind of in a midst of an injury and i got the hustle straps of canada and man if we all know anything about canada them some cheating up there man them are some cheating in canada like every single person from canada doesn't want to arm wrestle straight up i have not met one guy that wants to just grab an arm wrestle not one maybe denny dubreuil but that guy don't even arm wrestle no more because he got tired of arm wrestling because he lives in canada
SPEAKER_02: Come on. Devon is the fairest guy we know. Who? Devon. He's always getting a fair grip. No, no, no. Him aside. I mean, excluding him and Crazy George and BLM and anyone else. I mean, yeah, we're doing all right. We're doing all right. So...
SPEAKER_03: I wanted to talk a little bit about before, you know, I know we've been doing a lot of match talking, and I want to talk about some other stuff, but your match, Paul, with Rustam. I was watching y'all's live, and I'll tell you, Rustam was sitting like this, and I couldn't even see his body because his biceps were covering his body. He was big. He looks bigger.
SPEAKER_03: Yep. Yeah, he's definitely he's definitely stronger. I mean, I don't think that I think that goes without saying, especially how he performed against Iraq. And I still think that match could have gone the other way. He won. He won the coin toss and took the bad side. And he won. He won both rounds on the good side. Pretty convincing. So it might have been. I didn't see that match. So he did get the wins on Iraq. But.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, every time the strap decided to match the buckle because everybody on the strap side won. And the weird thing is like Paul just said, Rustam won the coin flip and chose the buckle. Yeah. But the strap side won every match. I couldn't understand it when it was happening. He could be the champ right now. Yeah. So, and it's fair to say, how long ago was that match? Like a year or six months? Probably a year now. A little bit less than a year maybe. So he's going to be stronger. He's going to be bigger.
SPEAKER_03: Mm hmm. You deal with the professional? Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. I made I made mistakes the first time I pulled him learn from those mistakes. The hope is that I improved as much as he did, hopefully more. And hopefully, you know, if he he's definitely bigger. So I'm wondering how the travel
SPEAKER_03: and the weight cut could be a factor. This is the first time I could- Artem you going to him or is he coming to you? He's coming to Orlando. So I'm going to hop between- That's August? Yeah. I'm going to make the cut easy, easy, my terms. I can start it at home. That should be an advantage that I haven't experienced yet. So I don't know. We'll see. I won't make the same mistakes.
SPEAKER_03: uh game plan will be different it'll be much more subtle adjustments rather than drastic ones and i just i'm just gonna snatch it right up yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna there's there's there's a couple things in the setup that i think i have to get but the match is going in the hook every time so what i would say is and you probably that's probably your line of thinking back in the day
SPEAKER_02: A guy like Prudnik used to give him a little bit of trouble when he used to high bone line them up like this. High bone line them. Scoop it up and in. I'd say watch those matches. And if you can fucking give him that high bone line, and when that motherfucker does that little bounce and the panic sets in, you're going to eat him.
SPEAKER_02: Give them the high bone line because then from there you can chop down on it, drag on it, do whatever. But, I mean, I'm sure I'm probably already giving you what you've already been thinking. Yeah, that's definitely something I've been watching. And, like I said, those adjustments, like you said, they're subtle adjustments. I think the people who have fallen victim to Rustam,
SPEAKER_02: have been the people that have been so terrified of his hook that they've tried to avoid it and fallen into a place where they're now out here. Whereas if you, similar to Sasho, if you embrace the motherfucker and then you can get him in a spot, it's a different animal when, hooking's different when
SPEAKER_02: You're both hooking as opposed to that guy's hooking and you're caught in it out here. You know what I mean? It's a very different animal. And I know you experienced that. I've experienced it. And if you've been in the game long enough with high enough people, we've all experienced it.
SPEAKER_02: And it's a learning curve. So, yeah, give him that high bull line. I'm not going to ask you to tell you your secrets, but at this point in time, I think you're all are in it and there ain't no changing now anyways. Nobody's going to go back and get stronger or more technical in these three weeks. Yeah, it's all done. It's all done right now. You can tell him what you're going to do and he can either stop it or not. Yeah. Yeah. I honestly, I think that assessment is similar to what you should do, right?
SPEAKER_02: but you know i i like that angle what rob was just talking about you too you too you guys all three you guys should approach it the same way you will all you're dealing with highly efficient hook pullers you will end up in trouble even if you've got a great top roll because if they're quicker and crisper off the start and then you end up over here so why not just be the stronger ass dude that just jams it up you know like
SPEAKER_02: That's where the psychology comes in. I've been there. I've been the guy who's been stronger. And in my mind, I say, well, I have a top roll back away. And you get in trouble for no fucking reason. And then you start running, and then the match doesn't even look close when it could have been. 100%. You look like it's not even in the same realm when actually you could be the stronger guy, but you're fucking yourself over. Yep.
SPEAKER_02: you try and top roll you you can be a good top roller you try and top roll an elite hooker you are going to leave the match and elite hookers on the setup it's kind of like there is a lot of value in what travis says about the false grip where when your palms forward and you kind of got that false like gymnast grip where you can just wrist curl and curl around anybody especially if you got some like fast twitch timing
SPEAKER_02: where you don't even need a world-level wrist just to set up an application will risk girl almost anybody even if they're an elite even if it's battalion and with an elite level like hammer curl pronation arm length everything there are guys that if they're set up right can just come in and chop down on him with just set up an application someone like talget will get in on everybody
SPEAKER_02: But it's not because his wrist is otherworldly. It's set up an application. If these guys are experienced with that, all three of you can fall victim to it. So why not embrace the motherfucker and just see at least one round, like, dog it from the middle? Yeah, I agree. I know that's what you're thinking.
SPEAKER_02: I know you're not thinking it yet. Ray might be thinking it. Ray wants to catch someone on his bicep and go, Opa! And pop a fucking Greek rapper or some shit. Sometimes play for Darkseid. I don't know. You're going to go that way? You're going out there? Yeah, sometimes. When I feel it. Only with Ryan Bowen.
SPEAKER_03: Only with people with turbo weak wrists. Why do you think I stayed away from the inside of Ray? I know how much of a grinder that dude is. So that's what I feel like if Ryan gets that first round. I feel like Ray's going to make him work, and then it's going to work and work. We'll see how good that dude is. We all know that Ray's that guy that goes down 2-0 and comes back 3-2. We know that.
SPEAKER_01: It's very comfortable 2-0. I don't plan it. It's just I don't know what's wrong with me. You know how I think? I'll go. I'll try. We'll see what happens. I was like, okay. And the second one, I was like, let's try a little harder. And then I'm like, now I really have to try. What's your pre-match warm-up plan? Like, do you do anything? Do you think it would benefit you? Oh, no, I need to warm up. Yeah, would it benefit you to warm up, like, more so you're already mid-match form before you start? Yes.
SPEAKER_02: Yes, if I can get like really good pulling before. I don't know if I agree with that because I'm very similar to you, Ray. I think a lot of it's here. It's almost like when you take a loss, you're like, all right, I tried that. Like you almost need something to go with the connection from here to here because like you're almost like half in it because you're a little bit unsure. And then once you almost get that like little fuck it mentality, like we're all in now, like let's just turn our cards over, we're all in, then you perform better.
SPEAKER_02: so i don't know if warming up is the thing i think if there was a mental warm-up if we could put you on some like anthony robbins brain waves or some shit like that but like there's nothing that i don't think it's a physical warm-up i think it's actually an emotional and mental warm-up i still think i don't know like a proper warm-up for me like i've tried everything i've tried not doing anything i've tried some light bands i've tried pulling get some inspirational music
SPEAKER_01: and find your reason why listen but i approach it like like you know you if you're gonna go for like say 400 pound bench right you don't start with 400 pound bench so this is why i need a warm-up my body thinks that way like i need like i'll pull someone like for a warm-up like it doesn't matter and they feel like like they do everything to me and i really can't turn myself on give a break two minutes come back they can't move me next one next one and feels like you know
SPEAKER_03: Maybe it's mentally because of this. No, there's a physiological aspect to that. The muscle fiber recruitment, like preloading, there's real stuff behind that. But then there's even more real stuff behind what Rob's saying. You know, the most intangible aspect of winning and losing is your mind state before. And I think the people that really, really mastered that, I think Devon is one of the guys who has really mastered his process of warming up mentally.
SPEAKER_03: I think we're all a work in progress. But I can tell you personally, when I'm really already in my zone coming into a match, I have my same process that I do. Sometimes you feel better. And usually when you feel better and you're in that zone, you perform better. And it sucks to have to find a zone mid-match. But it can be done. Do you guys remember going out into, like,
SPEAKER_02: i don't know how long you've been married paul but like back in the day we'll say and you hit in the clubs and you wanted to go out and get you know some ass or talk to some girls or something if you just went to the gym and got a fresh haircut and a fresh shave and everything was feeling when you felt good about yourself and you felt everything was good you had a fresh outfit you know the gtl thing that was on jersey shore gym tan laundry
SPEAKER_02: That is real. When everything was in check and everything felt good, your game was higher. If you felt lower about yourself, you'd almost be like the guy with his hands in his pockets, kind of like, I don't know, I'm a scrub. But like when you, same motherfucker, same brain, same fucking body, same face. But there was something about the way you felt about yourself that projected yourself differently. And the results were drastically different. It's like when you know you feel flat.
SPEAKER_03: You know, like I want to – in those same situations, I want to go out with a little bit of pump, you know. Hopefully my tan's on point, you know, because I'm going to give off a little bit of that different energy. And it applies to sports too. I remember in college, my college coaches, he would shit on me all the time because we'd have a game on Saturday and I'd be up 10 in the morning and I'd be in my bottoms going and working out. And I'm just going light because I just want to feel tight and connect. I want to have blood in my muscles.
SPEAKER_03: And then I want to have everything, everything where I want it to be. And with the combination of feeling good, the endorphin release and knowing my stuff is all tucked in and clean, I'm going to play better always.
SPEAKER_01: Listen, it was something, it's a great metaphor because like with left arm, I don't need to warm up. And it's because I have some problems with my right arm. So I'm not 100% sure all the time. I think I need to warm up to feel my arm, right? With left, I don't need to warm up at all. I can just start pulling, doesn't matter who. Like with right, I need to warm up. But you know what I mean? And it's spot on. When you feel great, you do great, right? Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: look good feel good that's it man you just gotta the metal side is something nobody talks about and believe me i'm one of the biggest cases people will talk about that when i'm mentally there or i'm mentally not and i'll tell you what it's a very real thing and uh it's something that everyone should look into the warm-up
SPEAKER_02: For, I think, Ray, when he takes those early losses, maybe it's physical, but I think a bigger part is probably emotional and mental. And some guys, it might be physical, but for me, I feel the emotional and mental side. Like, I need to feel like I'm in the moment. And sometimes taking a beating and being almost like realizing the thing you're afraid of
SPEAKER_02: and then living through it you're like that wasn't so bad i got pinned i was terrified of it now let's get to arm wrestling it's almost like that it's like it's like this guy beat me i was terrified of it and everyone's gonna heckle me and then you get through that loss and you look around you're like all right now it's game on like i just took that like now now we can get into a match here and i'm sure i'm sure each and every one of you remembers the first time you got punched in the face kid
SPEAKER_03: and usually a lot of times like if you wind up getting in more fights later on it's that moment where you get punched in the face and you realize oh that's not so bad i'm not made of glass that's when you become a dangerous person when you're not scared to lose or you're not scared to get hit or get hurt
SPEAKER_03: And like, that's why I love West versus West. I love all this stuff because and, you know, it gives me gives me a hard time for running around being in everybody's corner and everything. But I'm doing that for several reasons. And one of them is incredibly selfish because I'm feeding off all your energy. I'm absorbing that.
SPEAKER_03: throughout and whether it's good or bad, it doesn't matter. Like if somebody goes up there and the outcome's not good, well, good. I get to apply a little bit more pressure to myself on pulling later, you know, or if somebody goes out and crushes it, that energy is like intoxicated. So like for me, that trade off, like, yeah, I'm spending energy going around and doing this, but I'm taking it back to I'm getting more back than I'm giving all. And a lot of times I attribute that energy to my own personal success.
SPEAKER_02: like there's value in this stuff it's way more than and on the flip side it's commendable to be in the corner of the winner or the loser especially the loser because they're not a loser there's just an outcome these are the elite of the elite around the world the strength level and physicality for any of these people that are online watching would be incomprehensible they wouldn't even understand like what people like that guy can do easy
SPEAKER_02: is way stronger than these people talking shit strongest buddy can do on their best day it's like they treat them like it's gladiator camp and east versus west and and all these tournaments online are unfortunately a gladiator camp where these guys get shucked to the side so being in the guy that's lose his quarter
SPEAKER_02: is good because it's support because sometimes those matches are real close and it's still a who's world level and he's been in the grind and he trained his balls off and to be stepped over like you're some piece of dog because you didn't win a match
SPEAKER_02: that's terrible it's terrible that that makes it unsavory especially in the online community that i think that's why a lot of guys shy away from tournaments as well is because there's filming there and they're like what's my risk versus reward my stats can go down by losing a local tournament but i get no money for it i get no reward people are afraid of the implications and so
SPEAKER_02: In a nutshell, being in the guy's corner, win or lose, I think it's necessary because we're so quick to parade the winner and forget the loser. But how many losers have we seen go from zero to hero in just like two events? We saw Dave Chaffee go from almost obscurity retiring to beating Vitaly Lillet and a few other guys and making a run at the top spot again.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, Oleg Petrenko lost to John and then came back and started dominating everybody. Again, it was his comeback match with John. Same story, right? There's truth in improvement through osmosis, too. The idea of being around people.
SPEAKER_03: who are maybe at another level or provide a certain, look, there's a lower concentration in you and a higher concentration in them, you are gonna absorb it and it'll level out, you know? And the same goes for the negatives, but that's what, I mean, the more you can get around these competitions, I mean, they've made me a better person, a better competitor. Dave they made me stronger per se? Maybe not, but they've made me better for sure because I get to go there firsthand, share that energy. And you know what it's- Well, that's why winning countries produce winners.
SPEAKER_02: osmosis they're all they're all they all they became winners not through just their physicality their training their principles but also like it's things like daily habits ideology it's you don't get to that level by just going to a gym you have to have it carries through you with life it's the way you carry yourself it's what you do in your day-to-day it's even the way you think of yourself
SPEAKER_02: Those guys probably walk around themselves. Do you think that the guys in Bulgaria, like Vaman and Jordan Konev and Sasha walk around thinking that they're just good arm wrestlers? They probably think they're big swinging dicks in everything in life. They probably have this fucking swagger all day every day, and they all hang out with each other, and they support each other's ideas, and they probably eat a certain way and train a certain way and hold each other accountable.
SPEAKER_03: there's a little expression if you want to fly like an eagle you can't you can't if you're a sore like an eagle you can't fly with turkeys you got to be with other eagles right so when you're with a bunch of eagles it will change how you fly we've all been we got a training partner or a lifting partner who's just flat out stronger than you and the longer you train with them the faster you get stronger because you're just so sick and tired of switching the weights you're in the chase you're trying to catch them
SPEAKER_03: And they don't have to say anything to you. They don't have to call you all types of names and berate you. You're just going to get stronger because the pressure's on you. You're keeping up with them. Yep. What do you think brought Ray's level up so much, man? I went to Holland in 2016, and I didn't even know who he was. Now look at him. He's a superstar.
SPEAKER_02: Like, he trains with Stedif and Giannis. Do his first two matches and then start pulling, you know. It's that simple. Is he the real, is he the face of, who's the real face of their team? Is it Coach Ray?
SPEAKER_02: I would say Ray. I mean, honestly, Ray's probably the most recognizable. I mean, but that's because he's. So in order, what's it go? Ray. Me and Giannis. Me and Giannis. Ray, Giannis. But you're over Giannis because he's our social savvy. He's our social out there. So it's you, Giannis. And then who are we putting on the third? Sadist. Sandrus or Vlad? Sandrus. Yeah. Who? Sandrus. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: and then and toms is just like dorms is now skyrocketing yeah yeah skyrocketing but man he needs to learn how to speak yeah can we just give a a a moment of silence for what toms did to artem
SPEAKER_02: Because, honest to God, like, listen, Artem was talking a lot of shit left-handed, like he was going to be the goat of goats. And what Tom's did to Artem, when we were talking about a shiny red rocket fucking Edward from the fucking vampire movie Boner, oh, my God. When Tom's held him at the side of the table and just treated him the way he treated him, oh, it's called welcome to reality, my friend. Welcome. I can't say anything. Whatever you want to be.
SPEAKER_03: I can't say anything because the way he made me feel left-handed, Artem made me feel left-handed at practice Saturday. I can't. I'm not allowed to say shit. I don't care about that. When you're going to flap your gums like that and you're going to get dusted the way you get dusted. I think Artem can give some pretty good guys some pretty good matches and win some of them. That one was a
SPEAKER_02: Well, you know what it is. I don't hate a guy for losing. I hate a guy for acting like poor man's Travis Bajan and then not delivering. Now, if you're going to adopt a persona and talk that shit and then not deliver, then we have a little bit of a problem. Let's talk about him and Mindaugas. Because he said like, okay, Mindaugas and him both said some crazy things.
SPEAKER_03: How do you guys see that? I think Mendoza fucking kills him. Not even, what, right-handed? Right. Mendoza kills him. It's not even close. It's an 85 kg match. Going off of like, because Neil Pickup just commented in there a little while ago saying Rob is right. The level is like Jurassic Park. It's high. You know, like talking over there. It's just these matches, everything Engin's putting up is just
SPEAKER_03: Like these guys are elite, elite, elite. So going and losing a match ain't even no shaming at getting up there. But as far as the Mendoza and Artem match goes, I had Mendoza. So I've pulled a little bit with Mendoza. We talk a lot. I know where he's at. But the Artem I pulled with last year before I went and pulled Ray. So been a year and a half longer.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, about probably a year and a half. Different than the one I felt Saturday. Yeah, I don't buy it. Fuck that. I think you were tired. I think Mendoza crushes him. I think we are seeing a peaked out Artem. He's already capped. He's already at his ceiling, bro. It's over. I think the match is closer than I thought previously.
SPEAKER_02: I think it's closer than I thought previously. If I have to bet on the match, I can't not bet against Mendoza. Do I think that sneaky-ass low-hand shitty top roll in the fucking straps is going to work against Mendoza with that level of hand and wrist strength? Nope. Not even close. I don't think he's going low, but we'll see. 3-0 match. 3-0.
SPEAKER_03: And that motherfucker I'll put on arm bets. I'll bet on that one. So if it doesn't go 3-0, you'd be super surprised if it goes 3-1? Yeah, I would be.
SPEAKER_02: I think he's going to try to hit and get his shit collapsed. He might get to the pad and try to drive with that sneaky side pressure, but someone like Mendoza is too polished, been around with too many strong guys, too long. This ain't JV. This is fucking Division I, homie. This ain't that bullshit you used to pull it in the places you pull it.
SPEAKER_01: He's pulling the sales card. He's pulled the sales card to get matches that he adopted from Travis, but he's writing checks his body can't cash. Well, look, Ray's pulled them both. He would know more so than any of us. What is your opinion, Ray? I think Minda is very hard to deal with. And you don't see much guys like you need super high top role to beat him like Justin has.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know. Like in Artem's risk has always been an issue. His right arm is doing better than the left. In my opinion, left is just, you know,
SPEAKER_01: But I can't bet against Minda. I can't bet against Minda. I think he's so difficult, especially in a long match. Great endurance, and he has a lot of power for that, you know, sleeper build. He's incredibly strong. It's very hard. There's not a lot of guys that actually beat him, right? And the guys that beat him are very exceptional. Artem will have the time difference for him, and he will have the weight for him. So...
SPEAKER_03: And Mindy just did have a kid, so he's definitely going through it right now, the lack of sleep and stuff. He just had a baby. Oh, then he's fine.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, he just had a baby early July. I don't go as far as to say Mindy can be woken up in the middle of the night. Artem can prep, hydrate, and everything, come to his house like a faux Santa Claus on Christmas motherfucking Eve, and wake Mindy up and have an arm wrestling table down there under the Christmas tree, and Mindy will still wax some 3-0. So you think that's what's going to happen with Leonidas and John then?
SPEAKER_03: Oh, man, what a bitch match. I had to bring it up. Artem we going to get into that match? I know how you feel, so I wanted to bring it up. We've talked, but we haven't talked. How do you feel, Rob? What do you feel about that? Tell me. I'm interested. You want to know how I feel about that match? Yeah. This is some Devon King bullshit.
SPEAKER_02: So back when Leonidas beat Schoolboy, I believe Coach Ray interviewed him and said, what's next? And he suggested me. So I reached out to all the powers that be. And I got, basically in a nutshell, he wants to pull someone as a ranked 115-kilogram guy. I said, well, touche. I'm not one of those guys. He's trying to make a charge in his own little path. Que sera, sera.
SPEAKER_02: But I have my suspicions. Next thing you know, it talks about John Brzenk, who him and I are about the same weight. And it was confirmed. So John Brzenk is nearing on 60 years old. Not a ranked 115-kilogram guy. And he's on like a six loss losing trend. And even one of those losses was to a 95-kilogram guy. So far off of a ranked 115-kilogram guy.
SPEAKER_02: So I texted Eng and I was like, this can't be real. You told me this match couldn't happen because he's looking for a ranked 115 guy. He goes, well, when you're John, anything can happen. I was like, well, let's put the name to the side.
SPEAKER_02: Let's just look at it for what it is. And I laid out those examples. And I said, John is not the same guy as the guy who made that name. That's like Logan Paul fighting Mike Tyson now at 60, 50 some odd years old. It's not the same guy who won those titles. He's on a losing trend. He's trying to suck clout. He's got a guy out there. They're doing risk versus clout chasing versus all this shit.
SPEAKER_02: If you want me to say what I think, I think Leonidas is the name of a badass motherfucker from the 300 Spartans. And he is a poor representative of it because he is cherry picking and ducking all at the same time. He's picking on an old man in a losing cycle in a lower weight class. And you know what? I love me some John Brzee. But if you're picking on a guy who's already got six losses in a row or something like that, and all the guys in lower weight class is the one you're chasing,
SPEAKER_02: You're a bitch. Well, now we know. And I want to hear your fucking manager saying all your reasons. If you've got a manager making decisions for you as a man, it's because it's calculated. It's because they're making, it's like what Floyd Mayweather did with Manny Pacquiao. They sidestep you for a fucking reason. So who wins, Rob?
SPEAKER_02: man i still think john can win that but i don't know what john's up to these days john's probably like me john's probably on his boat or atv or doing some and coming out and just because john's john he might actually pull that off but then there's leonidas he might actually be stronger than we think i don't know i won't be surprised either way based on john's recent outings or john's who we know he can be so it all depends on those things right
SPEAKER_02: but it's a move don't sideline me and put me on the sideline for a reason and then break all those reasons so you can go after the guy who just got his arp card and lost every match for the past two years you bro well if he beats john we'll just throw you we'll we'll make that match happen with you and him we got nobody can make a match happen some matches i asked for forever
SPEAKER_02: you know what yeah i'm the highest risk with the least reward you know what i'm saying i'm like getting a bj in north korea or something it might be the cheapest the best bj you ever had but your ass might get strung up from a telephone pole or something it's like yeah but it's only like one dollar for holla but you're like that's kind of risky territory for me bro you know what i'm saying like like i could just go to you know
SPEAKER_02: thailand not too far away but it's like no you gotta go to north korea man it's the best but they don't like americans there but so it's like the risk versus reward i got that elite level risk but i don't have the john brzenk name i don't have the devon larrett name not quite but so it's like they're like i don't want to with this guy because right now i'm more dangerous than john brzenk let's just call it like that like i'll beat john brzenk john i'm telling you that right now i'll beat you i like it
SPEAKER_02: But John's got the name because they're remembering the 1986 guy who won the truck and the fucking all the other tournaments. But he ain't the same guy anymore. And other people have leveled up. Fucking Leonidas knows this. That's why he's got a little nerd ass accountant sitting there with his abacus going risk reward views, pay-per-views.
SPEAKER_02: bingo we calculated we put it in the calculator and we're smashing right now what do i ring up i bring up the liberals who want to talk about trump and how this because parisies and and steroids i'm nobody's best friend i'm over here who the am i i'm nobody's best buddy that's why you see me at my big dickie bar yeah okay fire that we got plenty to talk about a little more way
SPEAKER_02: i'm crying dude oh my god hey man so actually that's how i feel about it i'm gonna say like this personal message you can clip it snip it leonidas do your name some like like stand by it it's the name of a spartan king stop being such a goddamn pussy well take the fucking match
SPEAKER_03: There we go. That's the match to be made. I like it. This is recorded, so we can clip it out. Clip that shit out. Fuck that guy, man. He knows. He knows I'm an aggressive, weird motherfucker, too. We know there's been a little bit of something since way back with the whole Devon, when he was with Devon, and y'all got into the whole live thing on there. Yeah, we know. We know.
SPEAKER_03: Fuck that guy. It's got to happen eventually. That sounds more like a King of the Table match. Yeah, let's kick it. Let's do it. December, King of the Table. You know what the thing is? He's probably going to beat John. It could happen. I mean, if
SPEAKER_03: His arm is so strong. Leonidas' arm is very strong. But John is tricky. He's got the hand. Could he put him in a position where I've seen a lot of them strong guys get hurt at that point where they refuse to be pinned and –
SPEAKER_02: Listen, I'm not a liberal. I don't give a fuck about other people. I want to see that bicep explode. I want to see it pop right off and run into his shoulder. It might. I don't give a fuck. He's so strong. Hey, if people can watch someone get knocked out, that's a concussion, technically, right? That's a concussion. So someone can die. They can go home and die. So when people watch UFC, they're like, oh, yeah, we love to see knockouts. But then when I say I want to see someone get their arm fucked up, they're like, oh, you're a sick fuck.
SPEAKER_02: You kidding me? You kidding me? Like, no one ever died from an arm break, but people have died from getting knocked out. True story. So, yeah, fuck. Yeah, what about you freaks out there? The problem is, is y'all don't recognize how freaks you are. But I see you. Again, that's why I'm here alone talking to you guys through a phone with my margarita machine. Justin waiting for someone to come up and ask me for a margarita.
SPEAKER_02: I wish I was there, dude. Ray would have one. I see Ray get crunk on that live stream a few times. I don't think I've ever had margarita. Well, whatever the fuck you drink, wherever you come from, I can put it right in this bitch and make it perfect, Ray, because I am what you call a good host. And I don't know if you eat goat or fucking oxen or whatever the fuck you guys eat over there. It sounds like a place that eats weird meat, but I will cook it for you.
SPEAKER_03: Perfect, perfect. That was nice. Great drinks, fruity drinks. I mean, that's it. That is absolutely. A sex on the beach, fruit punch with some sort of like,
SPEAKER_02: I like pina coladas, you know, and get caught in the rain. That's a sexy song, but it's, you know, if you want to get from point A to point B, you could take a jet plane or you could drive a fucking bike with a bent wheel or something. Your dream to me is like a bike with a bent wheel. I like the jet plane. We're all going to the same destination. I just like to get there more efficiently.
SPEAKER_03: I want to ask Ray something. So clearly you've been practicing with Giannis. Where do you feel like he's at compared to, because I know for the last couple of years, he's basically been kind of competing just to stay in it for fun, traveling around, not worried about cutting weight, just pulling the pool. And is, I mean, how serious is he taking this? Like, how does he feel on the table?
SPEAKER_01: i think uh as serious as he can take it we pulled on saturday and it was like he did like probably the hardest training he has done in months on on thursday like all pretty much went to the ways that he haven't pulled uh and after that training on saturday we pulled two arms was dead two days like two arms couldn't pull anyone like nothing i called like nothing there was nothing
SPEAKER_01: Giannis was giving trouble to everyone to Vlad and then at the end it was me and him just arm wrestling a little bit uh Giannis will has some issues with his shoulder it's like it's not a secret so he has had them so his side pressure has suffered but I the thing is like he can he can pull right and then he will feel the consequences next day so he'll be ready for Justin and I think he's
SPEAKER_01: I cannot say he's in the best shape. It's impossible. He was way better way back when. But he's still really strong. Pronation hand is incredible. The hand is just insane. That's the last thing to go for sure.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, and his pronation is stronger than back pressure. So if you beat him, you have to open him here because you cannot rotate him anywhere. What a great storyline. I think that that's about a 10-year span almost with storylines of their little rivalry. Yeah. So it's a great storyline regardless of the outcome. It's like the gap in...
SPEAKER_02: They're meeting again, both with some age and life and experience under their belt. Really cool. Really cool to have them bang again because they were consistently the finalists at WAL and they had that match at UAL. And so you're talking roughly 10 years later, eight years later, meeting again. It's really cool.
SPEAKER_01: I think it cannot be an easy match for both of them. Because Justin is so hard to deal with. Giannis is so strong, tricky. And if something doesn't work, he can... In that match, he intentionally went in a hook. I haven't seen it since. He...
SPEAKER_01: he initiated hook on the last pull because he like Justin's back pressure was just too much. And Giannis couldn't deal with it. So I'm excited for it. And Giannis will come in good shape. And I think Justin, like Justin wants this win. Like he wants it like water, like, you know, he's big, right. He's big right now for his weight too. He's holding his weight down and he's, and he's growing. So he looks good. He looks good. He's filled out his practice with him. Middle age, middle age weight.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I practiced with him Saturday and he felt like a bull as usual. So he it's going to be really interesting. Justin's in good shape. I mean, I don't think he's got too many. These are all happening. These are all happening at the next card, correct? Yes. Yeah. 14 in August 10th. And that's the one. So Ray's pulling Belanger on that card, right? So it's you, Ray, Paul, Giannis. Holy shit. What are the other matches on the card?
SPEAKER_03: Artem Minda. Yeah, Artem Minda, Talbott and Brej. John and Leonidas. Talbott and Brej left? Yes. Wow. Yeah. That's the one I'm excited for because Paul's going to do it. Artem there any heavy matches? I think Corey was pulling one, wasn't he? Corey and Travis. Corey, Travis left. Corey, Travis left. Lefty? Yes. Probably valid. All right.
SPEAKER_02: Jerry and Alex Kurdecha. I like that one. Righty, of course. Todd and Prudnik. Todd and Prudnik. Nice. Redemption match. I think Prudnik will win that. Dave and Frank. Dave and Frank Lampirelli. Dave Chaffee, Frank Lampirelli. You know what? Rob's pretty good. Rob's pretty good at these.
SPEAKER_03: And we're not, I don't know when we're going to get a chance to get his picks. I want to get, I do want to get your picks, even if we don't run through the dissect the matches. Yeah, I'll just give the picks. We can all give our picks. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: We should all put enough money in the till for a case of beer, and then whoever wins gets the money Venmo'd so we can have a weekend barbecue. Let's say $20 a head. Winner take the pot. I'm in. Fine. All right.
SPEAKER_02: I don't want to give predictions because I have to talk with all these guys. So I want to stay away from predictions for now. Devon't be a political bitch, Ray. It's just a fucking prediction, bro. Can't I be just average bitch? Come on. All right. I'm going with it. I'm going to write this shit down with some aluminum foil. First match. I'll tell you my prediction. We're going to go with glasses, okay?
SPEAKER_02: Okay, so John Brzenk and Leonidas. I'm actually going with Leonidas, actually. Evgeny though he's a dirty, cheating, ducking, no-match-having bitch. All right. I got John. I got John. You got John? Yes. Do you know something I don't know? Is John particularly trained and thick? I pulled with Leonidas. I pulled with Leonidas. I got John. So he's not as strong as he looks?
SPEAKER_02: If it was left arm, I'd have Leonidas. Not right. You know what? You know what, Paul? The power of sales is real. And because it's John, and because I don't want to see Leonidas win and go back into bodybuilding, I'm going to switch my thing. Thank you, John. Thank you, Paul, for selling me one. And if you call now, you can get a free chamois. Next. I'm going with John for all the people counting. Hold on. I didn't even pick. I'm writing all these down, too, and I'm in the bet. You need my picks.
SPEAKER_01: John. All right. Listen, you guys can't all pick the same people. We can, but we're not going to do it. I promise you there'll be different ones. Jerry and Alex. Jerry and Alex. I'm going Jerry. Jerry. Okay. Todd Hutchings. I'm going with Jerry as well. Okay. Todd Hutchings and Prudnik? Yeah. I'm going Prudnik. I'm going Todd.
SPEAKER_02: i got todd too okay okay dave chafee frank lamparelli dave i got dave too and i'll even throw for a double down dave equals easy you think it's gonna be horrible no i think it's gonna be a hard match
SPEAKER_02: Do you think, though? I do. Well, maybe I'm just calculating, Dave, on where I remember Dave. Maybe things have changed. I think Dave, where he was, would just steamroll him. Frank's a tough cookie, man. His hand is loud. I know he is. He just can't match the side pressure, I don't think. No, Dave's got a strong shoulder and sideways. Moving on. Travis and Corey. Lefty. Travis. I'm going to look.
SPEAKER_03: for arm wrestling forearm wrestling we need travis to win travis would be a great you know come back need him to win to climb and go with that being said i'm gonna go corey yeah hey too hey there's something about being a salesman and then you keep selling dog cars that break down and blow smoke and blow up in everyone's face you can't have travis's car sales anymore
SPEAKER_02: The guy is good at getting himself into matches, but at some point in time, you got to deliver a vehicle that drives off the fucking parking lot and gets more than five miles to the gallon. You can't keep telling people what you're going to do and point to the fence and strike it out. When you're selling yourself, you have to, at some point in time, deliver. Now, Travis does a good job of selling himself, but we have not seen him deliver in quite a while. So, with that young man, let's go with
SPEAKER_03: I'm going with Travis anyways because I know what could be. Well, I know. So right now, Rob has two different picks, and we got the same, Paul. We're going to have to bear off the trail. You don't have to bear off. I already know a couple we don't see eye to eye on. All right, go ahead. Paul and Rustam Babaiev. Do I get to be out of this one? I got to pick myself. Otherwise, I shouldn't even show up.
SPEAKER_02: Yes. I agree. Now, Paul's performance is strong. Rustam is a big question mark. He's a big question mark. Is he going to come back different than he was, better than he was, worse than he was? I don't know. Looking at the past, I think maybe the injuries and stuff might be a haunt. I'm going to actually go with Paul.
SPEAKER_03: Thank you. This is dude. Do I try to go for pick it up one right here? Yeah, you should that you'd be smart. Did I go? I'm gonna put an R down and and try and pick and try and pick one up on you guys just for the bet. But if you're gonna do that, yeah, I was gonna say if I pick one up with you, I want to pick Hunter.
SPEAKER_03: Exactly. If I have to pick one up, I'm going to try and pick one up now because he has to pick himself. But if I'm saying, I already said on Inga's channel, if I got to pick this match, I'm going 55-45. Bro, it's only 20 bucks. Devon't lose a friendship over 20 bucks. People are going to be losing sleep at night over this pick. They'll do it. All right. Keep going. You better put that roosting down. Justin Bishop, Gianni Samuelsson.
SPEAKER_02: justin i got justin too yeah man uh oof man i don't have any more i'm not gonna have any more friends uh uh no i'm going i'm going uh justin and that wasn't as confident as i made it sound for me that's a coin toss so i think i just picked the guy that's i mean i have all the respect for yannis that wasn't as close as it sounded but
SPEAKER_02: I don't fucking know where either one of these guys are at, so I'm just shooting a shot, right? Let's go, let's go. Matt Mask, Lars Rorbecken. Mask and Lars. Mask and Lars. You know what? Surprisingly, maybe I'm fucking shooting myself in the foot here. I'm going to go Lars. Well...
SPEAKER_02: Years ago, they had a match at Artem Lars, and he won 5-1, I believe, Lars did. So I don't know. You know, they're completely different guys, both of them, because it's been a long time. But Lars did win that match. Yeah. Lars was massively bigger. Because I think if you pull a guy that hand control doesn't matter as much and it becomes more of a torquey arm wrestling match, I think Matt's a little more – not that he can't do it, but he's not as comfortable as some of the other guys at that level that are doing it, like we'll say Lars –
SPEAKER_02: I'm going to go with Matt. People look at what happened with Michael Todd and Lars, but they fail to recognize that Michael Todd is incredibly athletic, and his shoulder roll is second only to Jerry Catarat's. Yeah. That shoulder roll is fucking nasty. I got a hard time picking Matt's matches sometimes because I think sometimes he shows up in different shapes, maybe not 100% in different things.
SPEAKER_03: I just have a feeling that his back might, he might be putting his own back against the wall and have to win. And I think that speed and initiation, I'm going to go with Matt, but this is a tight one for me. Okay. So who are you going? I'm going Matt. I'm going Matt because I think he's putting his own back. I like it. See, we're already starting to fork in the road. I like it. Yeah, but me and Paul pretty much have all the same picks. Devon't worry about it. Wait until we get to you. Okay. Craig, Tom, Craig Tullier, Tom Holland. All right.
SPEAKER_03: right greg yeah sweet okay doug hunter uh i got doug i'm going doug i'm gonna go with hunter doug you can win this whole thing right now if you throw the match don't be a dick
SPEAKER_03: That $20 beating you two in this case of beer. We're just trying to get some free beers, bro. Yeah, look, $20 can buy you a pretty good case of beer, Doug. That could get you some Bud Light lime or something. Beating you two at something is more important than winning this match. Oh, shit. Devon't take a dive, Doug. Devon't be Pete Rose. We all got the same matches so far, Paul. We got to change them.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, Artem and Mendoza. Mendoza. Mendoza and Artem, who do you guys got? Mindy. I can never bet against Mindy. I just can't. I mean, I won't be. I want Artem. This is one of my deviation matches. This is one of my deviation matches. I knew I was going to be different. You're going Artem. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I want Artem to win, and I think it's closer to 50-50 than I thought before. I really do. Can I ask both you guys, if Artem was residing in Russia right now and called both you guys fucking communist pricks, would you still vote for him? No, I'm just trying to be different than you guys. Artem you voting on friendship or reality?
SPEAKER_03: No, I think this is a good one to deviate on because I think he has, Artem has a little level of trickiness that could pose Mindy some problems with the weight difference. But remember now, if you were betting on this, you're betting that Artem beats Mindy.
SPEAKER_02: i i am if i was betting my entire life savings it might not be that the same thing but i'm taking artem because i think that there's a chance and this is an opportunity for me to get one up on you guys okay i appreciate i appreciate the uh the chutes and ladders of the explanation of what's going on here hey when i go to the horse when i go to the horse track i am not betting on you you don't want the horse everyone's better you don't want the favorite you want the 30 to 100 dog so you can get that cheddar yes
SPEAKER_03: Dude, I went to the track like a couple of days ago and we were just watching and I was like, man, I should just put some dumb bets in here. You know what I mean? And we're standing at the track right at the finish line and the odds are shifting. You know how it shifts as the money comes in? And I was looking at like, I think it was maybe like out of the lineup, it was the horse that was like second to last. And the odds kept getting crazier, crazier, like 50 to one, 55 to one. And I was like, I want to go put a bet in real quick. And didn't this damn horse win?
SPEAKER_02: It had like $180 in on it, and a favorite had like 50 grand. Now Paul's got a new pontoon boat, and we're all wondering why. Fucking A, bro. Guys at the horse track gambling on the long shot. So you're going Artem. I like it. What's the next one, Ray? I want to hear this one. Paul Talbott. 3-0 Talbott. 3-0 Talbott.
SPEAKER_03: Three on top. Reg. I'm going to go. This will give me a way to get away from Paul, and I'm going to go Reg. Devon't asterisk it. Devon't be that guy. Devon't be like Leonidas. Devon't sell yourself. It's just a prediction. This match? No, I really don't know who to pick in this match. I really don't. I don't either, but in my mind, based on what I've seen, I'm thinking Reg.
SPEAKER_03: The decider for me is the amount of people I've seen Reg hold people up on his bicep and monsters and still win. I believe you, Paul. I believe you. I believe you. You just wait and see. I want Paul to win. I picked Paul on the podcast. 3-0. 3-0? 3-0 dominant.
SPEAKER_03: You'll see. That would be so massive. I talk to Paul too much. And Paul doesn't post anything. Paul's the most secretive guy on planet Earth. He's a weirdo. But he's a good buddy. And I know what nobody else knows. Hey, I will say this. He wins that match. That should springboard him into a number one contender or even a title shot. Yes. Like, immediately. I mean, the dude is a monster. Vrezh is a monster soldier.
SPEAKER_02: Nobody's discounting he's a monster. Nobody's saying that. But with due respect to his competitor, he is a world champion and the current monster. He is the current monster. I said Brej is the monster. That's who I was replying to. All right. So you're going Paul, Paul. I'm going Brej. Brej. Okay. Jonathan Breda. I'm Marek Pradines. Breda. I'm going A. Marek.
SPEAKER_02: I know Rob would go with the Frenchman. I know it. Well, hey, motherfucker, it ain't as simple as that. It's just looking at how quickly that dude dismantles people. You know what I mean? Sometimes you can have all that power, but if you can't access it before you're already KO, Aymeric's one of the best to do it, especially on that left arm.
SPEAKER_02: I'm a big fan of the guy. I watched a lot of him. And huge respect. I've seen Prada. I know he's got a lot of power. But I don't think he's got the savvy and that athleticism as an arm wrestler like A. Merrick does. I think before he can engage, it's already over. Mask my words. Okay. We have female match. Elizabeth Mocek versus Aleksandra Ozerova. I'll take Elizabeth Mocek.
SPEAKER_03: yeah me too is that the one that was that knuckles up yeah rob it's it's elizabeth elizabeth is doing like the 125 dumbbell flat she's saying again 125
SPEAKER_02: flat bench 125 dumbbells you don't say that in front of me son i'm dead i don't i'm still a plan of fitness i like the 75s baby like this so we're not going to talk about that we're going to call that we're going to call that a typo you meant to say 55s so she is the girl that was at um knuckles up and she's pulling who's the one she pulled merlene merlene
SPEAKER_03: No, who's the other girl? I know who she is. Alex Topol's wife. I'm going with her.
SPEAKER_02: i'm going i'm going to top rule because i saw her training in russia with all that badass russian and doleweb's little partners yeah that was just this week that wrist looks solid she looks solid and she's a serial killer who can also grind merlene came off of a little bit of retirement this girls i'm gonna go with alex squared or what's it when it's times three or some
SPEAKER_02: Because they're all Alex. Alex and Aleksandra. I dig it. You can't fuck up Noah's name. But I like... She's very, very good. Very good. So I'm going with her. I don't care about her bed press. Devon't flex on me. Devon't give me your 125 dumbbells. That makes me very insecure. Mask sure you have Paul down. Why do you think I did that?
SPEAKER_03: Hey, dude, make sure you have... Hey, I'm taking this shit... I'm taking this serious. Bro, look at me. I'm saving this. Mask sure you have Paul down and out-roasting because I did... Devon't worry, Doug. If you win, you'll get your 20 Venmo and maybe a little extra for Starbucks or whatever you get down with. At least somebody's going to be paying me what they owe me. Hey, the last bet I did like this... Speaking of Artem and Travis, I would like to announce that we put $100 into a till
SPEAKER_02: and i won that by a landslide and when i asked them all about hey i take venmo and i take the i take payment travis basically said i was a liar and art of never responded bro where are you remember that maybe one crazy someone jumped two sack where he's like where's my two dollars
SPEAKER_03: The only way you're getting $100 from Travis is if you see him in person and take it out of his wallet. There's no chance he's using any type of banking to send you money ever. And you know what? Artem thought he could just bang out on me like that too. But in real life, you can't just bang out on a bet like that. There are consequences, people. At least one more match. Two more matches. One more. Okay, two more. Michael and Camille. Right on. Michael Todd. Michael.
SPEAKER_02: I got Mike. Yeah, me too. Okay. Ray and Ryan. Who? Ray and Ryan. Oh, Ray. Ray who? Ray who? Ray. Who, who? Hey, where the fuck is Bowen pulling? Oh, that's at Knuckles Up. I was like, I heard Bowen was pulling Shark. What the fuck? Artem you picking Douglas? I'm going with Lipensk.
SPEAKER_03: Ray, I love you, and I support you, and I'm rooting for you. But for the sake of this thing right here, I'm taking Ryan. It's fine. You went the other way? I'll never forget this. No worries. I know. Listen, I will give you all the good energy that I possibly can on Saturday in hot Florida. Ray, just remember, when he's clapping you on the shoulders and cheering you up, you're only worth $20. He traded you in for a 20 spot.
SPEAKER_02: yeah well paul shrugged in 250s and his girlfriend's face pressing 250s you guys dog you wrote this down i wrote it down and i'm just realizing that paul didn't pick one person from the east
SPEAKER_02: Rob is going to wrap a brisket with that tinfoil. We know. Yes, that is probably true. You know why Paul's the most loved Captain Aymeric? Because he would never do his dudes dirty, even if he knows they're fucked. He's totally promising all these guys. Paul made it sound like he was putting thought into these.
SPEAKER_02: And he just picked the West guy out of everyone. He tried to make it look like, yeah. Listen, this is why when we did the show, it worked. I'm the asshole. You're kind of the asshole. And that's Captain Aymeric that makes everyone feel good. We know what time it is.
SPEAKER_03: We put a lot of thought in those match. I have logic to support everyone. I'm switching just because of Aymeric. You don't need that shade. Look at this. I want to make a switch. I want to make a switch just because Justin's comment in the chat because Paul's a real one. I want to switch my Justin match to Giannis. Artem we actually are you going to make Rob scribble that out with a sharpie? Yes, I'm changing.
SPEAKER_02: I'm staying with Justin because I believe that time is a thief. Switch me to Giannis. Hey, man, I've lost worse shit than this $20 bet, and I'm not about to go changing my bets for a 12-pack because guess what? I can go right down the street there and get me one, but I'm going to win this one. I'm going to win right away with Prudnik. You guys all bet.
SPEAKER_03: It's going to be a full case of something pretty decent. But you guys all fucked up with Prudnik and Todd right out the gates. I had one. Rob, I'm not kidding. Switch me to Giannis. All right, you're with Giannis. You guys are all in deep water now. We have to do a follow-up podcast, and whoever wins has to drink at least half of that case on the podcast. You got two hours.
