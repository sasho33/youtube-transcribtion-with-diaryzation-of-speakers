SPEAKER_00: but with uh Aymeric accent it is this yeah yeah okay yeah his name is you know English Aymeric yeah but you know it's uh for Aymeric the original of the name it's uh it's part of this Aymeric
SPEAKER_02: Vespucci I would say it's the same um how to say base of uh of the name from Aymeric all right we are we are here and we should be live um here on West versus West YouTube channel uh Jonathan Breda Aymeric proteins um coach Ray and these two guys will have
SPEAKER_02: most likely an epic war with left art if uh if hopefully for me because that's what i want to see i don't want to see and nothing else um i want to hear starting from you guys like how much do you know about each other and i want to start with jonathan
SPEAKER_01: everything that i've seen as of recent is mainly the topi match and uh 2023 europeans uh that's that's a lot of the recent stuff he doesn't i haven't seen much other than that if he has other stuff he's not posting it i do pretty thorough research whenever i'm uh analyzing my opponent uh
SPEAKER_01: But from what I gathered from a lot of his old stuff, his new stuff, he's definitely different compared to what he used to be. I don't know if that's due to injuries and whatnot, which, you know, that happens. But yeah, that's I looked like a low hand top roller. You know, I like those. And yeah, interesting. Interesting. It'll be interesting to see if, you know, if he can even break my wrist back. That's for sure.
SPEAKER_00: So Aymeric, maybe you respond to some of the things because you, you took some time off, right? You were not active and it was because of injuries and you changed. Yes. It's also because injuries also because of my, uh, my job. I also, uh, you know, I manage a French arm wrestling Federation. I, it took me a lot of time to, uh, uh, to develop arm wrestling in France. Now we have, uh, government support when.
SPEAKER_00: We are a real sport in France. For example, I have an invitation from the French Olympic Committee during the Olympic Games to have some stands and we can promote armwrestling during these Olympic Games.
SPEAKER_00: So it took me a lot of time to build this in France. And now it's we have almost 1000, you know, athletes in France practice daily, 50 clubs in every region. So I put a lot of energy for this. And now it's it's amazing in some good way in France.
SPEAKER_01: I've noticed that a lot through a lot of your promotional stuff. You can tell that your promotional aspect is just through the roof with what you're doing over there. It's very impressive, just the amount of fans you have. I'm getting messages from people like, who are these people? You've got a big following over there, that's for sure. Yeah, thank you.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. And that why I, um, I took a break also, uh, you know, uh, injuries a bit lack of training. So I stopped arm wrestling and I restart to come to compete few, few years ago, two years ago, exactly. And, uh, yeah, I come back with left. My right is not on, uh, on international international level now, but left it's, uh, it's pretty okay. I'm not, um, how to say, uh,
SPEAKER_00: uh to say well well-rounded as before yeah uh mostly outside uh before I can pull in almost every position uh I'm not bad inside but I don't think I'm confident like before from the core I'm ready for you but uh yeah
SPEAKER_00: we'll see i will uh avoid this because i i saw some uh some video ex uh especially the your your fight against pablo and i know pavlov is already a strong guy and you for me you are stronger inside than him and so it's uh it was very impressive fights yeah that match uh that match put me out for like six months that was like 17 total starts
SPEAKER_02: on that match and we couldn't that was that was brutal yeah i i i remember i'm eric and i remember like he had some brutal wars with that left arm like and of course it took damage because if i if i think i'm american i instantly think hook like i can think of nothing but
SPEAKER_02: I remember we had a lot of times we met and every time he's like, his elbow is like, and he wants to arm wrestle, he wants to do it. And you had those when you took time off, then you came back and many times and it's always been a problem. But now, like you said, a different style, you're not maybe as well-rounded, but maybe a different type of arm wrestler.
SPEAKER_01: can you still pull inside or it just like it causes you pain and you try to avoid it? No, no, I can't. I can't pull inside. Oh, he can still from what I can see just from watching 2023 Europeans, there's a few guys you threw in the hook very confidently, I think. And I know what you're talking about. I've always I started out the first three years of my career just, you know, wedging, putting every ounce of pressure I could on my elbow. And that's that's how I started out arm wrestling. And
SPEAKER_01: It's getting the confidence to want to go through that pressure again. I know what you're talking about. Yeah, I can tell that. I mean, I can see where the lack of confidence is, especially against Topi. Because, I mean, with Topi, I mean, that's all you had to do was go in there if you really wanted it to be easy, in my opinion. I mean, because he's all outside, all outside. Yeah, I don't think he can pull inside.
SPEAKER_00: yeah he typically doesn't have yeah yeah and um yeah now my biggest weapon is my hands uh power yeah i'm more confident on my hands than uh than my hands yeah
SPEAKER_01: yeah that's the that's the blessing about injury the silver lining and injuries right i mean when something becomes weaker it forces you to train other parts or that's you know when my elbows started giving me problems i really started focusing on top rolling and that's that's what got me pretty much to the next level i'd say just you know taking time off from pulling inside and just focusing on the outside for a couple of years that's
SPEAKER_01: That's what made me more well-rounded that way.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, and I think also before I train more consistently, more often. So I think for the hook, you have to do this. If you train often, long times, your body is ready for the hook. Now my type of training is a bit different. I train because of my work, everything, it's life. I...
SPEAKER_00: I managed to maximise my performance with my styles, with my hour of training, and that's why my style changed a bit. But as you say, during European, I can adapt from my opponent and I can go inside, but it's not my first choice. Right. How long have you been armwrestling?
SPEAKER_02: start 2011 2011. yeah Jonathan you with long hair uh 2017 2017 so coming up to 13 years and coming up to seven years right yep yep yep that's
SPEAKER_02: That's a good. So do you think this experience, especially like Aymeric used to pull super matches like arm wars, you can go and look some up there and write crazy matches. Um, what favors you in this match, John? I would say, uh,
SPEAKER_01: the the consistency uh I mean I'm not you know saying that Aymeric's not consistent but I mean you know as you know I was in the I was at the second West versus West and got my first taste of you know uh going crossing the water to pull zurab and you know got my ass handed to me uh basically trying to do too much of what I don't do
SPEAKER_01: Right. I thought, you know, I created a plan to beat him and it was nothing, you know, what I normally do. And that was, you know, I should have just stuck to my guns and what I'm what my ace is and just did it. But, you know, after getting that knowledge and getting that experience, you know, I kind of had an idea where it was and I knew that, you know, it was going to take me a couple of years to get to where I needed to be. And between that and just being consistent with, you
SPEAKER_01: consistently training with guys like, you know, Herman Stevens and just, um, you know, basically stopped going from trying to do things on my own and just, you know, uh, take advice and, you know, do things the way I should be doing it. That's, that's what, uh, I think I have the advantage. I've been very consistent. I train, I don't over-train like I used to. I, uh, I'm very, uh, precise as far as, um, uh,
SPEAKER_01: I do a lot of strength training, doing a lot of strength training the past couple of years. I do powerlifting, you know, whenever I'm not doing, if I don't have anything arm wrestling, I'm doing powerlifting. I'll do some powerlifting meets every once in a while. Keep that central nervous system, you know, I guess conditioned. I found that's been a huge improvement for me in arm wrestling because, you know, I think you have a powerlifting background, right, Coach Ray?
SPEAKER_01: What I've noticed with it is, like, you know, if I'm not doing any arm wrestling training whatsoever and I'm doing powerlifting training, if I get on a table, it feels like I never left because it's, you know, my central nervous system is just primed and ready to go, just like I would be for arm wrestling. That's what I've noticed. And, yeah, I think my numbers are just, you know,
SPEAKER_01: right where they need to be. I feel like my technique and my table IQ has went up tremendously in the last couple years. Justin being able to adjust and, you know, go by feel and, you know, not let people take advantage of me in the setup. I think that's where, you know, basically my strength and my consistency, I think, is what's going to be the key to my victory in this.
SPEAKER_00: i mean you used to power lift also i mean right yeah i was a national champion 2009. oh nice yeah junior national right something crazy one on deadlift or
SPEAKER_00: yeah yeah yeah uh one 180 but uh not on record on video i i did the two 200s with hands but without strapping the only and yeah they lift yeah was that double overhand or was that yeah with one arms without strap but with uh say grip like this yeah one yeah one hand yeah two hundred what is it what is that in pounds
SPEAKER_00: 440 pounds okay yes I remember like when I when I met you like Raimonds Santonovic was couldn't shut about it all he's like that's Aymeric all the time yeah yeah but I don't think it's uh useful for arm wrestling and uh now for example now I am not able to do this and I think my hand is way stronger so it's completely different things
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it was good for deadlifting, right? So what's your advantage in this match, Emetic? I think speed. You know, my start is a big advantage, I think. But as Jonathan said, he improved a lot. His table AQ and his way to pull. I saw his fights.
SPEAKER_00: recently and some years ago, and he changed a lot. And now he's more smarter. He can adjust. If he lost the first round, he adjusts. So it's not a good point for me. It's more smarter. Yeah, I think it's the setup and my speed on the starts.
SPEAKER_00: is my biggest advantage and if it's able to stop me it would be completely completely different fights after so it will be my turn to to adjust my my style after this so you have uh like the bullet and the catcher right it's uh that's how it should be but we'll see i'm sure he is ready for this so
SPEAKER_02: Robbie's match versus Aymeric, what did it show you, gave you, Jonathan?
SPEAKER_01: Honestly, it really, it didn't give me a whole lot as a, you know, after talking with Robbie, you know, and this isn't to make, I'm not making excuses. This is just genuinely from what he told me and what I've seen him do. I mean, we've seen this guy be, you know, go toe to toe with Cody Merritt when he's 270 something pounds.
SPEAKER_01: uh what i saw from robbie was him basically pulling one out of like what i said earlier you know how i adjusted and went with a game plan that i don't normally use i i think that he went that approach thinking that he was going to have the upper hand just because he has a big strong hand but
SPEAKER_01: What I gathered was Robbie just clearly wasn't doing what he normally does. He's more of a back pressure puller. You could tell he's putting a lot of high side pressure in the setup, which doesn't make sense for what he's trying to accomplish.
SPEAKER_01: Really, I mean, I didn't really take a whole lot from that match, is what I'm saying. I've never seen Robbie, you know, we know, I think, I don't know about you, Ray, but I mean, everything I've ever seen of Robbie has been, you know, when he's super heavyweight Robbie, 270-pound Robbie, I've never seen a 230-pound Robbie Topey, ever. So, for me to take anything from that was really, I mean...
SPEAKER_01: not, not a whole lot, but what I did take from it, like, kind of like what Aymeric said, I mean, there was at one point he did, you know, uh, kind of tie up Aymeric a little bit at the back of the pad where I don't know if Aymeric, it seemed like Aymeric just kind of got a little, uh, um, he got a little confident when he broke his hand back and, you know, tried to play a little bit and it looked like it didn't really work out, but
SPEAKER_01: you know, if Robbie Topia is stopping him in the middle of the table or, you know, even from a pin pad and he's at the back of the pad, that's not going to work with me. That's where I see is like, so I think if I can maintain prom nation, even if he does break my hand back, it's not going to be, that's what I have that lane and that's what I took from that match pretty much. That's all I could take from that. Would you be very impressed if I married this guy?
SPEAKER_02: like fast, like you can't even engage him. Would you be impressed by that? You would be like, oh, then I miss, I miss shot this. I thought,
SPEAKER_01: no no i would not be uh mainly because of the fact i i am a slow activator i mean you know i i am training for that like specifically right now i'm definitely tapering down i'm focusing a lot more on bands and starts and you know just making sure my timing's down um you know studying you know i don't i saw just recently who the refs were uh
SPEAKER_01: and the announcers or i don't know who the main ref is going to be or if we get this aside or not but uh basically studying cadences and working on my you know my timing right now um but no that wouldn't surprise me if he does he does catch me sleeping i mean i typically you know i i get the timing down pretty quick uh eventually you know i don't know if you saw my recent match with uh alexander uh koleshov
SPEAKER_02: You know, he, it, it took me a minute, but you know, eventually, you know, I, I got the timing down and, uh, that, that ended rather quickly. Right. So, so speaking about the rules, um, so there is, there's no ready, there's just go right. It's it's for referee shouldn't treat. Devon't move as ready. Devon't move, go. It's like, don't move, go right. It could come straight away. I could say, don't move, don't move, don't go. Right.
SPEAKER_00: only thing right in in your opinions is it better or worse let's start with dynamic do you it's i think it's better but anyway i i never listen uh referee so for me so uh yeah i don't know uh how to say uh uh
SPEAKER_00: My stuff not depend on this, but you know, sensation and, uh, uh, Alison, nothing about referring it's, uh, but I think it's more easier for referee to do this and it's more simple to do like this. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah. Let's go. I'm sorry. I'm just excited. Yeah, my bad. But, you know, that brings me to a point where one thing that bugs me more than anything is when people bitch about the refs and bitch about like, oh, there's there's no ready go. There's no you know, it's like.
SPEAKER_01: I don't understand what the thought process, like when you're studying your opponent or when you're getting ready for an event, like, I mean, I'm not just studying my opponent. Like I'm studying the refs. Like if I know who the refs are, I mean like that should be shit that you should be researching before the match. Like there's, there's no excuse for, you know I mean, especially since what this is, this is going to be the 14th West versus West now. I mean, I know this has changed as of recent, but it's like,
SPEAKER_01: I mean, come on, guys. Like, you know, research. You can't just research your opponent. The referee plays such a vital role in determining a match sometimes. I mean, if you're not studying these referees as well, I mean, yeah, you're asking to get your ass pinned, I mean, in my opinion. So it's...
SPEAKER_01: yeah i mean to me it doesn't matter if it's you know don't move go or if it's ready go or if it's you know i mean i'm going to be studying it i'm going to know i'm going to find out and i'm going to be prepared for it yeah i think uh rules everyone should know the rules before coming to event right event is not the place rules you should come into the rules um
SPEAKER_02: I think, like, if referees and athletes would get it, that don't move is not the same as ready, because don't move, go. It's not doing, don't move. It's like, don't move, right? No, don't move means, like, guys, stay the same. This is good. We're going to give you a go. That's what it should be meaning, right? Then I think it's so much better, because everyone starts on ready, right? Yeah. Everyone starts anyway on ready. Like, ready. You're like...
SPEAKER_00: And the rep says it fast, you win and there is no problem. Yeah, but when you go too fast, the referee cannot see if you anticipate or something like this, only if you touch. So when the hands go out,
SPEAKER_00: you are on the path already. So even if you anticipate the goal or everything, it's just for the referees, it's about hands, not about the visions. It's too quick for this. A lot of guys will like, they watch mouth of referees and when they just like, as soon the sound is leaving there, right? Prove it, that wasn't on time. I like how Travis Bajan said, it will feel like I was too early, but I was right on time.
SPEAKER_01: Well, it's also one of those things too, where, you know, I kind of laugh at the fact that, you know, when people blame, you know, I've heard, I've heard a few people blame the refs in this occasion. And it's like,
SPEAKER_01: Thank God. Like, it's like pulling teeth to get a foul. So, like, just false start. Get your timing down. I mean, you know, if you got a false start, false start a couple times until you figure out the good timing. They're going to give you a warning. You got, what, three fouls, right? I mean, goodness. Running, you know, they're not going to want the match to win on fouls. So, I mean, if you got a false start a couple times, false start a couple times. I mean...
SPEAKER_00: And about the referee, maybe something will change a bit now because some referee are from USA. It's different because I watch a lot of fights in USA, the way
SPEAKER_00: of the referee do the job. It's a bit different than the WAF referee in earlier appearance. And I think it's a bit disadvantage for me. Because you like those hands. You like those hands. Yeah, the WAF is more, you know. And USA, it's different. It's going to be good for this event. Every referee has, I think, we have Bart Wood coming in.
SPEAKER_02: and uh christo and who was else um who was else there i forgot there's the whole line i want the jack off as a referee you want at least one year i i know i cannot show you but uh yeah uh so how about we flip a coin bill collins or uh yeah what's his name can we at least agree on bill collins bill collins is fair yeah good
SPEAKER_01: yeah I I don't know oh uh engine manager you know referee I don't know I mean as far as I'm concerned if we agree to it yeah I mean we're technically like just in W I mean you can kind of you can ask for a different ref cancer you can agree upon a ref right yeah maybe I mean
SPEAKER_02: i think it should be a problem and i think it's going to be okay but yeah like uh understanding when the goal is coming right everyone kind of says it differently so you know it maybe takes so much oh everyone will figure it out so you boys are pulling at 105 kilos of my i'm right right light heavyweight yep uh so let's i'm looking at rankings right now okay so rankings number one is alex and murato
SPEAKER_00: I want to hear your thoughts about Aligen. Could Aligen possibly be number one left-handed? For me, at 105, he's untouchable in this division. I saw what he did against Evgeny. I trained with Evgeny before the fights.
SPEAKER_00: You know, Evgeny is really good inside. And when we watch carefully, he gets the right start, he gets the position, he gets everything. And when Prudnik is in this position, it's like a world for me. And I was totally impressed about Alijan. And I think maybe it can be the number one overall left hand.
SPEAKER_01: That's, that's what I was thinking as well. I mean, his, his move is just so nasty and he's just got so much horsepower. I mean, yeah, I, I find it. Yeah. I mean, even like creating goals for myself. Right. And it's like, if you were to tell me I was going to pull him in less than a year, I'm like, Oh, I don't know about that.
SPEAKER_01: i mean don't get me wrong i'd give it hell but i mean that's that's how much respect i have for him he's he's definitely you know i think he's you know top three is super heavyweight it's easy um in my opinion so uh like i think oleg zhok before accident was probably the greatest i've ever seen bound for bound
SPEAKER_02: And I think maybe, but in different style for me, impression impressed me more than Oleg. Exactly. Because, because, uh, didn't have massive hand, right. He's just, he's just different, different, different type of animal. Right now, my opinion, like if I like pound for pound means for me, it means like I can be easily everyone at my weight.
SPEAKER_02: like that's what means pound for pound like best right so if all are at the same weight like and he has no no competition 105 maybe 115. I I think he's bound for bound and like you guys said maybe top three and we're definitely going to find out but it's extremely I'm sorry go ahead no go go go I was saying uh so is is Matthew shanko still have they pulled yet
SPEAKER_01: No, he, Matushenko is at 115. I think that. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: think we're forgetting about him as well i mean you talk about like probably one of my you know getting into this sport i mean i probably might watch more ivan matushenko videos than any arm wrestler on the planet i mean his ability to hook people is just so impressive i mean from a no load start and just be able to stay in position and still have horsepower i mean and then you i mean he he beat olig saw very easily uh
SPEAKER_01: I mean, to turn him into a hook, it's just, you know, that's crazy. Yeah, I'd like to see a healthy Ivan left-handed versus Alizon. Yeah. But I don't know where his left, I don't know where Matyushenko's left is these days. He gave a match to Artem Morozov. Like, it was close. It was really close. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I think the left arm, those matches, Artem Vitaly, Matyushenko, Alizhan, Alizhan maybe with some other... Yes. Yes.
SPEAKER_00: Interesting fight, but what I saw Alijan against Prudnik, I'm not sure Ivan have the tools for beat Alijan. I think you have maybe like Vitaly. Yeah, Vitaly Laletin puts more trouble to Alijan because even Alijan, when you took the pronation, he can connect very low.
SPEAKER_00: And the power, his arm power is crazy, crazy. I want to see the fight against Ivan. For sure, it will be very interesting because Ivan is, as Jonathan said, the ability to hook of Ivan. Also, I saw, I don't know, hours of video of Ivan Matushenko. It's a great inspiration. Great sportman, athlete, legend. But I put my money on him.
SPEAKER_02: on a lesion on this face so uh there's a super chat before we go back uh so left arm like you guys are ranked uh Aymeric number seven Jonathan you're you're number eight on 105 kilo lifetime rankings uh number six is Zura number five is Oleg Jacques and number four is Oleg Petrenko so what what's for both of you is the next step if if you win this match let's start with gentlemen
SPEAKER_01: Well, that's definitely a loaded question. Honestly, you know, I'm definitely thinking one step at a time right now because, I mean, at the end of the day, you know, I've gotten my feet wet pulling, you know, some high-level guys recently in the last two years. And, you know, I won my first international fight against, you know, I'd say Aleksandra is a good opponent.
SPEAKER_01: but, you know, I think Aymeric's going to be, you know, a big, it's still like testing grounds for me to see, you know, am I truly ready on, on this level? Um, I, I think, uh,
SPEAKER_01: For me to say that I'm ready for anything past Zurab, I think I'm ready to beat Zurab right now. I want that match back so bad. But as far as beating, you know, I feel like I'd have to beat Aymeric fairly easy in order to say I'm ready for guys like Petrenko and Oleg Sok. So that's my opinion.
SPEAKER_02: So first you need to get it even with Zurab so you feel like you reached the next level, next step, right? And then you'll see, then you'll see probably.
SPEAKER_01: Well, no, not necessarily. I, like I said, if I, I mean, I feel like if, you know, uh, not, you know, I'm not minimizing Aymeric here, but I, I think if I can, you know, if I can beat Aymeric, his wheelhouse very handedly, I'd say that, you know, I, I, I can see myself pulling with the likes of all eggs off and, you know, those guys, but you know, if it's, but that, that's just where I think it is. Where's your aspiration to Aymeric in this weight class?
SPEAKER_00: Oh, you know, I know the level. I train with Evgeny. I know the guys up to me. It's complicated. If I want to... For example, Evgeny for me is not unbeatable. He's different of the style. If I stay outside, I have a chance against him. But inside, I'm very far. So...
SPEAKER_00: I know in some aspects of armwrestling, I'm not at this level. And for this to be well-rounded for this type of athletes,
SPEAKER_00: uh what to say i need to put more time on my training and it's for now it's a bit complicated for me so i my my goal is to stay in this top 10 i i'm not able to to beat the top three top four guys
SPEAKER_00: I can maybe put him a bit in trouble with a good start if I go in my style, but I'm not seeing myself to win this type of fight for now because I don't put enough energy and time on training. After maybe if I want to say improve my raw power, why not? But for my plan is to stay here on the middles.
SPEAKER_02: It's a crazy tough class, to be honest, guys.
SPEAKER_02: when you when you feel like okay i could maybe reach that step like then that's the then you're both gonna do it definitely uh there's a question how do you feel about the buckle side so um everyone hates when they get the buckle uh i think in my personal opinion it doesn't matter if we're going in a hook right but it matters when you're trying to talk but it kind of matters anyway but uh jonathan what do you feel about yeah
SPEAKER_01: I mean, it doesn't I don't think it really matters. I don't really think it matters outside of a rough script. I think it does. And it matters more in a rough script than it does outside of a rough script.
SPEAKER_01: uh if you have the buckle but i mean other than that i i mean if you're outside the if you're outside of a rough script i mean it takes nothing to adjust uh in that strap to get back to where you need to go i mean as far as referees grip you know if you have a referee just you know cranks down and you know doesn't uh bring the height back to normal i don't i don't really see where you know if you're letting the buckle determine the match you need to get stronger
SPEAKER_00: yeah for me it's the same don't really matters yeah for me more matters is uh the referee the way they they put the strap and your own attitude or you or you set up your opponents it's more important than the side of the buckles
SPEAKER_00: for i think about uh i think this it's more or you are focus all your opponents play with this uh so it can be advantage disadvantage yeah i think it's like how do you guys practice do you practice uh more on the buckle on the hand are you trying to keep it even or
SPEAKER_00: Both, both. I don't really care, you know, during training, you know, I move around the table. I don't really say, okay, I need the buckle now. No, I'm not really focused on this. We had like, I think the biggest examples was when Rustam was pulling Gherakli, right? Who had the buckle, the guy lost. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Justin was pulling Mendoza, who had the buckle, lost. Like, it was just back and forth, one, two, three, four, right? Going back and around. Well, people forget about this. Sorry to cut you off, but think about this, too. And I see this a lot. If you look at, I can think of a few matches, and I can't really pinpoint them, West versus West, but is it really the buckle?
SPEAKER_01: Or is it really who side is what side they're on? Because what I find what a lot of refs do, especially shorter refs, I feel like attention to the center of the table is not really paid attention to more than how straight their hands are. So like there's there's several matches where, you know, if if.
SPEAKER_01: like let's say Justin's on the right side, they're pulling right-handed and a smaller rep, you know, he, he's going to bring the hands closer to him, right. Where he can make sure everything's in his everything's right. But in turn, I feel like needless to say, I feel like the center of the table gets forgotten, forgotten about more than the strap playing a role in the match. That's my opinion though.
SPEAKER_01: Cause I mean, I've seen several matches. Like, I mean, I've seen like Luke Pulcher, for example, if you watch any of those monster factory videos, prime example, him versus Robbie Topi, same thing. And it was clear cut and obvious. Like every time Robbie lost the match,
SPEAKER_01: He was on the side of the table where he was closer to the referee setting up right here. Yeah. He's setting up basically if you're set up out, it's the difference between, you know, getting set up outside your shoulder and parallel with your shoulder. I think that's the difference in my opinion, but I mean, some people can argue the strap, but I think it's more center of the table. That's determining that than anything. People forget to look at that.
SPEAKER_00: And when you lose, people say it's a buckle. Yeah, exactly.
SPEAKER_01: Damn strap. I'll tell you one thing. If there's a strap that I hate more than anything in this game is those damn lion straps from California with the big, thick plastic buckles. I hate them more than anything in this world. My favorite. They're my favorite. I hate them so much. Those big, bulky-ass plastic, like, oh, I just want to burn every single one I see. I hate them so much.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I think it's really also depend of, uh, the referee. If your stop strap is, uh, the referee is very good to put the strap. It's okay. But when he missed something or you miss something, when you are, you're set up after you, you can be in trouble with, uh, with strap or uncomfortable to, to apply your, your style. Yeah. Yeah. Uh,
SPEAKER_02: We're going to go. There's Justin Bishop in a chat. And we're going to go into some matches that we're going to have on this event. West versus West 14, always 10. We have 16 arm wrestling super matches. I don't know if maybe it's the biggest card. Maybe I think we have done 16 before, but it's West versus West too. When I was on that card, it was 16. Yeah. Yeah. Usually it's 15. We're trying to keep it.
SPEAKER_02: short but this time 16 just an added value so Justin Bishop wrote Breda looks like he's ready to give someone a ticket hello officer brother yeah we also have a lot of Super Mario comments but I'm not going to read those Mario
SPEAKER_02: yeah so uh Justin is gonna pull Giannis I think you both guys know about both of these and uh I want to hear your thoughts uh like you don't have to give a prediction but how do you see this match goes and who it favors maybe a little bit more Aymeric yeah yeah yeah and it's of course Janice uh that that history together I think yeah Janice won every time uh the
SPEAKER_00: against uh yeah but of course janice i'm well-rounded and i think it's a it's better arm wrestler and it's just just better smarter better maybe justin maybe i'm not sure it's maybe uh more powerful maybe but i think it's it's not enough i uh
SPEAKER_01: I actually like where Justin's head's at right now. You can tell that he's taking this match very seriously. You can tell, you know, I think the first time they pulled was, I think he was talking about the other day, he was two years in the sport. I remember that. I've seen that match so many times in UAL days. With such little experience, being able to get a win on Giannis was very impressive, which, you know, doesn't speak for where he's at now.
SPEAKER_01: you know, going off just the Mondogas match. Um, I mean, if there's been anyone that has shown that they deserve to be in the top, uh, top tier that weight class, it's Justin, I think just based on that Mondogas match alone. Um, I think that, and, and I talked to, uh, Justin from time to time and I've talked to him, you know, uh, specifically before the Mondogas match and, uh,
SPEAKER_01: You know, the biggest thing for him is just how determined is he to win and how consistent is his training. And I've... One second. I've never seen Justin so determined as of late. I think that the outcome will be very surprising for a lot of people. Yeah. The question is...
SPEAKER_00: Only question for me is about the shape of Janis. I don't know if he'll close off his best level. If he is, I think it will win without so much trouble. I think this match means a lot for both of them, right? Janis doesn't want to lose to Justin and Justin needs to get that win back that he lost in UL 2013. So...
SPEAKER_02: But I think it's an epic match. I want to hear your thoughts on some other matches. So we have Travis Bajan and Corey West. It's a left-handed match. Travis, he pulled Derek in Challenger Series, and then he lost to Kalinchenko. Do you guys think Travis is ready to face Corey West? Because Corey West is still very, very scary.
SPEAKER_01: Jonathan? Corey West is going to blow through. It's not even – I've never felt a man so strong. I've pulled Corey a lot, and, you know, I just can't even feel the guy. I've pulled Travis before. And, yeah, granted, you know, supposedly Travis is training now. But it's one of those things. Corey, he has such a big, thick hand. It's so awkward to grab a hold of.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, yeah, he might break his hand back a little bit, but, I mean, I've seen people break his wrist back and him just drive sideways through people. I don't think that, you know, Travis needs another year of training under his belt at least to be back to top form, I think. And, yeah, I think Corey's just going to be too much.
SPEAKER_00: For me, it's the same opinion than Jonathan's. I think it's too soon for Travis. What we saw against Kalinchenko, we saw Travis is not ready yet for this level. I think he needs more time to come back.
SPEAKER_02: little bit too soon someone that uh right yeah i guess and corey is uh yeah but uh very happy to to see travis again yeah yeah it's always a spectacle right and uh even kalinchenko was uh because travis was there was much better right it was someone else and just kalinchenko just blows through them it would be like nothing there but yeah uh left arm we have this is for me like uh because
SPEAKER_02: I think fresh is in USA for at least four or five years and he's pulling Paul Talbott right both of them have been ranked in different rankings number one and finally they're going to meet I think it's at 85 kilos if I'm correct uh so I think a lot of information have you pulled both of them Jonathan
SPEAKER_01: I never had the chance to touch either one of them. I almost pulled. I almost pulled for us at the Olympia in Florida, but I never met him in the bracket. I ended up losing twice to Marcio. Before I could even get to him and then Paul tablet and I actually were supposed to have a super match a couple years ago and that fell through due to him get having an injury against Artem.
SPEAKER_01: So, no, I've never got to grab a hold of either one of them. But just, yeah, what I've seen from Brez and Paul, I think Brez is a different human being, man. He's so impressive, even without his hands. It's, you know, I...
SPEAKER_01: I don't think – Paul's not going to have enough side pressure to finish him, even if he does break his hand back with his high side top roll. I mean, you definitely don't want to hook Perez. I think that, yeah, that's – I'm thinking – I'm leaning more 60-40 Perez on that one, in my opinion. How about you?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I know both. I just pulled one time Paul Talbott. He was in Europe for World Championship and I pulled him side table. I remember this. It was an after party on bar tables. I pulled him. I feel him strong, but I don't think he's the best shape when he was in Europe.
SPEAKER_00: of course i same opinion than jonathan i think uh he's not strong enough for version to finish him right when fresh stops because that's like everyone can if almost everyone gets in there right you think like yeah yeah because i think he he like to be here so it's a strong point here
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I think Brez is just, I mean, honestly, I mean, I don't know how serious he plans on taking this, but I've seen him grab so many people like practically right here and just, and just sit there, you know, just like he's thinking about what he's going to eat for dinner that night. I don't, I don't, I think I see him trying to do the SIM similar, do something similar to just take away the pronator. And yeah,
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I mean, eventually Paul's going to run out of pad. And, you know, I want to see Paul win. I do. But, you know, I just – Perez is just such an impressive specimen. I don't know. I don't think that's – I don't think that's going to happen. Gotcha. Gotcha, guys. I hope he proves me wrong, though.
SPEAKER_02: I think it's interesting, Macho. I talked with Paul yesterday. We did a podcast, and he said 3-0 Talbott. He said, I know something you guys don't know, and he feels that confident about Talbott. But it's still like has anyone beaten Rish in USA? Cody, Merritt. Yeah. That's it. I watched him dad move Marcio.
SPEAKER_02: like crazy yeah yeah i'm happy that match is happening we'll finally see because paul is very impressive he can pull all different styles and when he shows up in good shape and i think this is the most motivation he will ever get right for the match um we have um jerry catherett and alex kudetch
SPEAKER_02: jerry had been off close to a year right close to a year and uh alex uh with right who did who did he he pulled georgie right yeah beat him handedly too if i remember right yeah gerry's he wasn't in like he's put like he almost yeah wasn't he yeah what are you limping yeah he had like crazy infection in his foot like four weeks broke it or something and
SPEAKER_02: and then i think there was almost like he's gonna you know lose the foot but eventually everything's fine now and they saved him but that was crazy so i i don't think much from that match because yeah yeah clearly his immune system took a toll from that and i'm sure he was yeah yeah that's that's tough yeah but
SPEAKER_02: Kudeja is good, smart, and how do you guys see this? Because Kudeja has been in the past struggling with much smaller guys pulling, you know, with no wrist. Well, I think, you know, with Jerry...
SPEAKER_01: know he says it's been a year but i mean let's talk about his debut at east versus west before that i mean i think he had like a three-year break before that it's like you know there was all this hype like everybody and their mother was trying to get a match with jerry catterett for like three years and he just kept saying oh this money this the you know show up that i mean i i'm not you know allegedly
SPEAKER_01: Allegedly, I'm not speaking for Jerry by any means. But like, I just remember there was so many people shortly after COVID was like trying to get a match with Jerry. Right. And then finally, West versus West starts blowing up. And then it's like, OK, Jerry gets a chance to prove that, you know, he keeps saying he's number one guy in the world and finally gets a shot. Right.
SPEAKER_01: Noffz a three-year break, he proves it. I mean, he was number one. He went through three or four different super heavyweights that have been training consistently while he took a three-year hiatus, it seemed like. So the fact that Jerry hasn't pulled in a year doesn't really tell me anything based off the past. I think that, yeah, technique-wise, yeah, he has the tools to beat –
SPEAKER_00: to beat uh what's his name kodecha and uh yeah I I do see that being in Jerry's favor I do yeah yeah interesting fights but we saw um on the past uh kodesha uh have a problem against uh flow Press
SPEAKER_00: But I think now he's a different animal. Kodesha improves a lot. Strength, also diveball IQ, better, well-rounded. We saw his fights against Artem Morozov. It was a very impressive fight. I think he has a chance to beat Jerry.
SPEAKER_00: Jay, I saw an interview about Jay, he said with Floor Press he would win easy because Koldyshev had some trouble against Krasimir, Ongar by F. Actually, it's not the same for me. It's not the same Alex. Yeah, it's five years ago. He changed completely his style, his power, everything. He's improved a lot. So, me, I bet on Alex.
SPEAKER_02: the win okay uh we're gonna speak here for maybe five more minutes guys so i know you yeah america needs to sleep and uh jonathan needs to keep going with his day so camille and michael todd crazy fights i want to see this yeah yeah hours fights hours fights
SPEAKER_01: I honestly don't know, to be honest. I mean, everyone wants to say Michael Todd, clear cut over here, of course, you know, probably some bias, but just because, I mean, he's pulled these types of people all the time, right?
SPEAKER_01: But, I mean, my question would be, since he's had his elbow and everything cleaned out and, you know, he's got all this mobility back. He says he's got all this mobility back. I think that potentially hurts him in this match, if that's true. Because, I mean, you know, part of that, you know, that bone lock or whatever, he, you know, he was very successful with that at first because, you know, he can only go out to here. And then once he plants, I mean, it's just tiring the –
SPEAKER_01: your opponent out right i mean if he's if he's you know got more to give now i i find it he's definitely on the losing end of this potentially but we'll see i i can't really i'm leaning more 60 40 uh camille on that but i i do uh like i said want michael to win obviously team usa so
SPEAKER_01: for me 50 50. it's uh I think it's a stamina fight yeah that and that Camille guy's weights are just impressive I mean it's just the weight that he's moving is ridiculous I I yeah so yeah it should be a good one come on yeah it's definitely one of those like uh
SPEAKER_02: like for me what I would love to see eventually a Jerry versus Camille yeah that he's somewhere though at that level right then what would happen there we don't know maybe you know we maybe we go to a different Dimension find a wormhole I don't know we'll see right something magical right it's something like I'll be like right we see double flop or
SPEAKER_01: How does that even happen? We're just going to pin each other at the center.
SPEAKER_02: So the main event is John versus Leonidas. I talked with RVJ yesterday. He's very upset about it. He doesn't like that Leonidas is pulling John. Devon picked Leonidas as heavy, heavy favorite. I really don't know where John is. With John, it's very hard to tell what kind of shape he shows up. So does Leonidas have what it takes to beat John at this time?
SPEAKER_00: Poussin, John Age, so I don't know his shape now, but I think he has a chance to win this fight because Leonidas improves a lot. We saw the fight against Schoolboy. He's different. He's armwrestler now, really. And his power is really, really crazy. But I think for...
SPEAKER_00: I don't think it's good enough to finish John. If John have enough stamina, he can stop him somewhere and walk on the hands. And Leonidas will do some mistake, I think. And I don't think he can control the pronate of John. I see. But I cannot bet against John. So, John.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I see Leonidas making, he might be strong enough, but I don't think, I think he's going to make too many mistakes on the table and John's just going to really be relying on that and execute when needed. I mean, Lord knows he's going to have hand control. I find it very hard to believe that Leonidas will have hand control and, you know, keep his, be in his winning vector,
SPEAKER_01: um the in every match i i think he's gonna make mistakes and get too eager to just like every fairly new arm wrestler right they so so excited to get too excited about going to that pin pad too quick when you got to be you got to be smart you can't you know you got to be precise and uh i don't think he's there yet i think john will out arm wrestle him
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it's hard to bet against John, and I'm always rooting for him because you always want to see John winning, right? Before we finish, I have to ask Jonathan, what can you tell me about Ryan Belanger?
SPEAKER_01: I don't know a whole lot about the guy, honestly. I've seen him in person. I know he has a very good hook from what I've seen. I think that him and Adam Morzynski have had some good matches.
SPEAKER_01: I think that him and Robbie Russell have had some really good matches. I don't know if he has more wins on them than they do against each other. But from what I understand, Ryan Belanger is, you know, what I've seen of him, he seems like he's definitely an inside type of guy, just likes to stay inside and banging that hook. I could be wrong on that. I don't, but I don't really know a whole lot about him other than he,
SPEAKER_01: he's definitely a force to be reckoned with in that weight class for sure he's he's you know he's getting there i'd say in a couple years he'll definitely come to his own as you know one of the top us guys
SPEAKER_02: Okay, maybe I have a chance to take on him before he gets there, right? So maybe I still have a little bit of chance. We'll see. We'll see, guys. Yeah, thank you guys for joining me. Thank you guys for watching. I'll see you both in less than three weeks, right? And we'll have an amazing event, amazing match. You want to say something to finish this up?
SPEAKER_00: no i think it will be very uh interesting fights and uh maybe not quick enough and i think if it's not quick it will be a really a war and good fight i think it's fights and it would be more complicated for me the style of jonathan it's more complicated for me so it's a change it's not it will be not easy fights at all and good luck stay stay strong and see you see you soon
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, looking forward to the challenge, looking forward to see where I'm at and, you know, see where we compare at the table and just see what kind of options we have. I'm very confident. I, you know, you're obviously a worthy opponent and, yeah, looking forward to
SPEAKER_00: holding hands at uh August 10th so best of luck to you and I hope you uh got your training in thank you I will train with Evgeny Sunday my last training so if I pin pronik inside you you can be worried
SPEAKER_02: Well, I just hope that gives you more motivation to go into the hook. Yeah, maybe. In a slow hook. Yeah. Yeah, guys, don't miss this. West versus West, 14 already, August 10, live on Pay-Per-View on Corey Sports. We're going to be there in Orlando, Florida. Devon't miss it. Thank you, Jonathan. I'm Erlich. I'll see you guys there. Stay strong. Love ArmorsLink.
