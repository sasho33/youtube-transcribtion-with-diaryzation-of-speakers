SPEAKER_00: Hello, hello, Paolo. Yeah, well, hello. I mean, how are you? Good, good. Start training? Oh, I'm training full-blown. I'm pushing. Yeah? Where are you right now? My right is the peak and my left is around 85, 90. Already? Yep. Wow.
SPEAKER_00: it's been two and a half months now so two and a half months since you start training since surgery all since surgeries and you're already 85 is incredible yeah not it's moving not bad there is a few moves where i'm still like at 85 percent everything else is not bad at all happy with what they did and how they did the surgery so
SPEAKER_03: hopefully i'll be fully recovered soon i wish i wish i had the surgery after that bicep care when i put arthur i was like oh enough being in you are already you know all you know just okay you wouldn't pull anymore and then i just but later i sorry i'm just sharing the link for the
SPEAKER_00: Sure, absolutely. That's what I did. I was not sure if I should do it or just leave it alone and, you know, stop pulling left at all in training. But then... How bad was the tear?
SPEAKER_00: it was not there it was uh loose pieces and a big spurs on my elbow on the outside and inside there was two spurs on the bones and they was cutting on my tendons and there was uh eight loose pieces in my joint so they cut the bones they removed the pieces and uh you know and uh that's where i'm at so i understand
SPEAKER_03: Did you watch West-West 13? Yeah. How did you find Sasho versus Samusha match? Yeah, it's... I did not think so, to be honest. I was surprised. Until I saw both athletes, I was thinking Sasho is the favorite. Once I saw both athletes, and I'm like, Samusha was normally
SPEAKER_03: like a guy with the forearm, you know. This time, shoulder, chest, back, and I was like, I mean, just this guy didn't come as usual, you know, he came different, and yeah.
SPEAKER_03: yeah yeah you are able to see me right yeah yeah yeah yeah it's a little bit hard to say because you saw it in him in person and you have that feeling you know yeah I think Paul is coming yeah I mean to top roll him even not solution you saw it you know just I mean
SPEAKER_03: once once i realized that you know i realized that this is very very hard to beat the guy you either go inside and his endurance is incredible or you top roll him then you miss his pronator it is not easy either hey paul how are you my friend i'm good i'm good can you hear me yeah yeah yeah yeah what's up pablo what's up dude good to see you man i'm good to see you too
SPEAKER_03: So we were talking about Samusha. And I mean, just it's becoming more and more. I mean, the two guys that I'm thinking about is Aydarhan. The last match was very close. And then I'm thinking about the Miro. Yeah, Miro. Yeah, and Morzynski. I think the speed difference in the Adam match
SPEAKER_02: uh was the big play adam not being able to deal with his initiation i think that i think if if adam would have been able to stop that match it would look closer i think i could be wrong but i think the power is probably closer there but adam has a hard time with initiation i i think it was the reason was also power that that the the match didn't go
SPEAKER_03: Straight side pressure, yeah, straight side pressure. Yeah, I mean, his wrist and everything, he just controlled, you know, Adam's pronator. If I were Adam, I would pull a little bit different. He either tried fully inside, fully outside. I would just go back pressure and then hook into my angle instead of going there or going out because you go out, you open your own angle, you know, and then you go in and then he just wrist curls you.
SPEAKER_03: and yeah but it's easiest to talk uh myro look very strong so probably myro versus idarhan and the winner takes samusha sounds better because we cannot expect samusha to beat both guys again you know yeah yeah yeah yeah we're then you're going back into immediate like almost immediate rematches of matches he won but who else do you give him that's the problem
SPEAKER_03: Exactly. Nine times you think, each time you think, finally, maybe, it's happening. No, nine times. Yeah. Yeah, but from other side, Samusha to have rematch with both of them doesn't sound bad either because the guy doesn't have so many options left. He basically beat everyone, you know.
SPEAKER_03: yeah i mean push him out of the class push him out that's the other option when you go 95 then iraqi iraqi is very hard you know yeah yeah that 95 is not his his size that that's what i believe you know and yeah i don't know as you said yeah
SPEAKER_02: is too much for his category but i mean you can you could do catch weight matches that aren't for a title you could do 95 catch weights with guys that can come down to 90 or 91 because i think samusha probably walks around that he would still be competitive i think at 90 he'd probably still be the favorite i think i think that if he wants to pull 95 category he needs to pull 95 but he doesn't have to be for title yeah for example you versus him it would be also a good rematch
SPEAKER_03: Yep. And it would be even more beneficial for him at 90 because I weighed more than when I pulled him. Or at 95. No, I mean, the category would still be 95, you know. I mean, if he wants to pull higher category, he needs to, yeah, pull 95 kilo category, yeah. A lot of people say this guy would be some shit, that guy would be some shit. Those guys never beat Sasho.
SPEAKER_03: and never would beat sasho so just i know style mix matches was yeah i think that he beat the best possible guy you know in that category for sure without a doubt um i don't know where rushtam is let me check if he has any problems no
SPEAKER_00: He didn't write. Let me ask him. He just came here. Yes. Hi, Rustam. We can't hear you. Your sound is off. We can't hear you. Your mute is on.
SPEAKER_01: Hello, hello. Okay, thank you. How are you? Good, good, good. How are you? Okay, okay. Okay, okay.
SPEAKER_03: So, Rustam, Rustam, you are a legend, but you came to West versus West twice. One time, you know, the match didn't finish, but technically you lost. And then Irakli match was the world title match. You pulled very good 3-2. When we now look at Irakli's shape, and then whenever I see, I remember your
SPEAKER_01: result against him just shows that you also were very, very good. So how are we going to see you this time? This time you're going to win? Is this question for me? Yeah, maybe Paolo, you. I have good form, better, better than last time.
SPEAKER_01: I slowly restored my chest. I can see everything only with explosions, with fresh strength, with all these explosions. I can withstand such slow loads. I can withstand everything, thank God.
SPEAKER_00: Well, I don't worry as much as I used to, but anyway, now will be the main test. Well, I think that if I pass, then I will go even faster. Yeah, Rustam saying that chest is recovered, healed up. On any slow movements, everything is great. And he said that this is going to be a major test right now. If it's going to hold down, he will...
SPEAKER_00: you know fly up and he's gonna recover not recover but gain the better form even faster and how does he see his chances how do you see your chances against paul
SPEAKER_00: Rustam is saying that there is a chance, and he says, I don't want to say before this, but he is very confident in himself. And Paul? How do you feel? I feel good. I feel good. My weight's right on point. Training's been good.
SPEAKER_02: Got no excuses. I'm just happy to have an opportunity to run this match back, because I don't think either of us liked the way it turned out. So I think it's an important match, probably for both of us. And I'm just blessed and happy to be able to run it back, especially this soon, you know. When was it exactly, the match? January 2023?
SPEAKER_03: Twenty-two. Twenty... Twenty-three. Twenty-three. Twenty-three. Yeah, so exactly one and a half year ago. One and a half year ago, yeah. Yeah. So, Rustam, you said that you feel confident and everything. So, right now, how close is your phone compared to the, your like prime time?
SPEAKER_01: How close did you get to your best form? I think the form will be better. I don't know, you know, it's hard to say. We still need to get there, fully recover, do everything correctly, comprehensively. If nothing gets in the way, God forbid, I think I can get to the ideal form that can be. Well, not counting that moment.
SPEAKER_00: But for today, I think it's going to be good. I'm saying that if nothing will stand between him as of right now and the day of the match, he will probably be in his best shape. Of his life? Yes. Wow. He said, yeah, I still, you know, thinking about this, but it feels good right now and it's most likely going to be a best shape.
SPEAKER_03: And Paul, you, every event, I mean, even if you lose, you didn't lose a lot, but we see you coming back stronger. After you lost against Irakli, of course, different opponents, but you look very, very strong against Lachlan. And now you are facing Rustam again.
SPEAKER_03: do you find Rustam technically a hard opponent for you or you find him someone that you can apply you know like you try to go outside twice against him and Rustam is known as having like very strong hand and wrist and then third time you went inside so we know that he got injured but
SPEAKER_03: Do you think you will have any problems to apply your game plan? Like, is it gonna be a challenge to apply your game plan or is it gonna be a challenge about the strength? Rustam, do you understand? Approximately, yes, I understand.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I asked this to Paul, yeah? If you need a translation, just tell me, okay? Bruce Thomas understands almost everything, so I'm not sure if he needs a translator. I told him that if he needs a translation, he will let me know.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I think, I mean, I think Rustam is the pinnacle of the game for inside arm wrestling, for sure. So strength is definitely the big question mark. Like, but there's so many, there's so many minute details to being where you want to be. And I made...
SPEAKER_02: I listen to possibly some bad advice in preparing the first time. I feel better about my preparation for this go at it. It doesn't mean that technically there's still not problems. I think Rustam has possibly the best hand in the sport from the perspective of containing people.
SPEAKER_02: And a lot of people, I think, see inside arm wrestling as just sheer horsepower and brute strength. And there's so much more to that. And Rustam's hand strength and his technical prowess poses a lot of problems.
SPEAKER_02: It's not as simple as just going inside or who's stronger when you get there. So I'm for sure doing my best to progress as far as my strength level and the application of it. But I'm definitely still concerned about setup issues and how to apply pressures. So I think it's a combination of both.
SPEAKER_00: You got the question, right? How he feels, what the difficulties will be, and so on. He says, listen, the fight with Rustam is a little more difficult than just trying to get into some position, or turn inside somewhere, or through the top.
SPEAKER_00: And Rustam is known for his strength and his brush. He says that everything will be a little different there, but my preparation was much more clear and concentrated than the last time, because we already fought, he understands what is happening.
SPEAKER_00: So, yes, of course, I try to catch up with my forces, because it is very difficult to fight Rustam without forces. But at the same time, I try to address all my problems that may arise in the capture itself. Rustam, a lot of people are asking, you know, we're talking about Samusha,
SPEAKER_03: And some people are curious about if you would ever make 85 kilo. But as of now, you are about 97, 98 kilos. So 85 looks very hard for you. Am I right? No, no, it's not possible. Not possible. Yeah, this one I know, but just a lot of people talk about it. So I just wanted them to hear directly from you. Another question, Ruslan.
SPEAKER_03: We will again go back to your match with Paul, but do you think that you will ever be competitive with left arm again as in the past, or you mostly focus on your right arm? Or you think that for 95 kilo with left arm, you would also think that you may win the title? I have a good left-right. I think I must pulling left.
SPEAKER_01: And I prepared both arms. Did you watch the last West vs West 13? Yes, I watched it. I liked it very much and it was very interesting. Very exciting. Although there were many 0-0 fights, but they were unexpected.
SPEAKER_00: Very unexpected. He said that, yeah, I watched it. Absolutely. I liked it very much. And it was very interesting. And he said that, yeah, lots of matches was with a zero on one end, but he said sometimes it was like unexpected and it's like very interesting. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, sometimes you need to set the match, you know, then, then you find out, you know, who's the champion, but again, is the champion.
SPEAKER_03: And you need a challenger. So you bring Petrenko. If Petrenko won't dominantly, what can you do? You know, it's just, he was the biggest challenger. So what did you think about Taino versus, uh, bad Philly match? Very interesting match. Very interesting. Surprise for you? Surprise. Surprise. Yeah. Uh, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: I didn't expect such a result. Another question. How is your left arm record against Tainov? I mean, left arm in the past. Has Tainov ever beat you with left arm? Repeat, please. I didn't hear you. With Tainov's left arm. What score did he win with Tainov's left arm?
SPEAKER_01: We've never even met each other. They never pulled left? Oh, but they had been in the same category many times with right arm, left arm. They didn't meet each other? We're in the same category. He often met with Ruslan, my brother. But he wasn't in my category.
SPEAKER_03: No, they didn't meet? No, Ruslan, his brother, not him. He didn't believe him with right arm? No, no, no, not right, not left. Oh, that's interesting. I thought that you have met him in the Europeans or something. I think he and Hajim Razzolev met in the same category. Yes, yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I confused with that one, yeah, Hajim, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Do you think that you would be ready to pull someone like Oniani? Left hand? Will the left hand be ready to pull someone like Oniani to fight him? Maybe, maybe. It will have to be discussed on the spot. I think when we meet it will have to be discussed.
SPEAKER_03: I'm thinking about how to do it better. I think everything is possible, but we need to discuss everything in detail. Rustam is saying that yes, it's very possible. He will think about it and you can discuss it when you're going to meet at the... After this event, yeah, later, later. Right now, let's focus. You know, I talk with Paul all the time, you know. Rustam, we barely find
SPEAKER_03: So while I found them, you know, I, I would like to, I, I wanted to ask some, some questions, you know, yeah. So Paul, how do you see this, this category? Like normally super heavyweight and 105 was very competitive, but with the
SPEAKER_03: Now, of course, some left, some right. But, you know, Oneani is there. Taino is there. Irakli went down. Sasho, Rustam, you. So now 95 kilos is also shaping to be very competitive. Do you agree with that? Absolutely. And there's other guys that can make the weight. You know, Hutchings only walks around at 100. Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Hutchings is good.
SPEAKER_02: And Hutchings talks about 105 being so tough and so deep, and it is. But a lot of those guys, outside of the guys that are really cutting to get there, they could be at 95 too. So I think there's a very similar landscape in 95 as there is 105. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I agree. And Rustam, generally, how do you see the league? Is it like right now the toughest league?
SPEAKER_01: How do you think, in the 95th category, is it the hardest title to win or not? I think that 105th and 95th are two categories that are equal, where there can be an interesting fight all the time.
SPEAKER_01: And what we saw at the last championship, at this West-West 13th, how he lost relatively easily to Ainov, who no one expected to lose. At least so easily. And in 105th, no one expected that Dedikyan would lose. And it's interesting, two categories are very interesting. I watch them with pleasure.
SPEAKER_00: Rustam's saying here that two classes, 105 and 95, both are the same, deep and tough, and he said, I have this huge interest watching both of them, and it was a very unexpected Tainov match and Dadikian match, nobody expected that it's going to be so easy or, you know, very unexpected, and he said that those two classes are equally hard, and yes, that's... Yes, yes, yes, yes.
SPEAKER_01: um what do you think about petromarharin do you think petromarharin will also go up and then be competitive for the title um
SPEAKER_00: Well, you can translate it, so it's not difficult for you. No, it's okay, I'll translate what I want. If it's difficult for me, I'll simplify it. Yeah, he's saying, absolutely, he's a very, very strong dude, and he's genetically very gifted, and he will show how it's done very soon, you will see. He believes that, yes, he will. Yeah, yeah, it's a very, very hard category with, like, Dadikian, Petrenko, Tatachins, Ungarbaev,
SPEAKER_03: Now you have also Paul is pulling there. John Bersink is there. And we have Petro Marharit is there. Evgeny Prudnik is there. Justin like that category is very, very, very, very hard category. All this conversation bringing me to thinking I will right after podcast, I will go and eat a second lunch to make sure I stay heavy. Rustam, time to time.
SPEAKER_01: Would you prefer to pull that category as well or not at all? 105? Yeah. I think my genetic potential is still better at 95. I can't even gain weight further. I have 97-98 maximum.
SPEAKER_01: Well, if you eat too much, you will gain weight. But it's not my weight, and I already feel that I'm at such a limit, because sometimes I just have to do a lot more than those guys who do it in my category in training, to get even with them. I think it's not worth it, at least not yet.
SPEAKER_00: Rustam is thinking that he's genetically not made for 105 class. He's saying that it's very, very hard for him to gain that weight. And he's now almost his maximum. And he said, okay, I can push it to 100 kg, but it's because of the fat, not because of the weight. He really thinks that as of right now, he should stay at this weight class
SPEAKER_00: and maybe in the future but not not as of right now he said because it's here it's deep and hard enough but paul for you is not you you are open to pull both categories right yeah i'm i'm hoping to pull it i don't
SPEAKER_02: like if i'm being real honest with myself uh it's a similar thing to rusum i don't know genetically my height and like my structure is probably not as competitive in 105 at the higher levels than it is at 95 but i do think the playing field's equally interesting and i think that there's a lot of interesting matchups between those weight categories and you are open to
SPEAKER_02: I mean, just yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's hard for me to get to 105. Like, like Rustam said, it requires a little bit of body composition change and adding a little body fat, which isn't too bad, but I would never be in a situation where I could get above 105 and cut down to 105. I would always be coming in there trying to be that big, but that can work too. That can work too.
SPEAKER_03: Rustam, in the shape that you are now, if you would just go back in time and pull Irakli, you think you would win now? I think I have a chance. So your shape right now is better than last time you came to Istanbul? Yes, my shape is better.
SPEAKER_03: And you have goals to pull Irakli again in the future? Yes. Yes, okay. So you are not done yet? You haven't finished yet, right? No, I haven't finished yet. The main thing is that my body doesn't let me down. My head is still working.
SPEAKER_03: He said, in my head, everything is good. It's just very important that my body will react properly to everything. So basically he's saying that we are just starting. That's good. You know, Paolo, these guys are very like extraordinary athletes. I always say like, like, like Paul, you know, just like, I remember Paul first time in Istanbul and now
SPEAKER_03: like how much he progress, like you can, you can see that is like experience is not what you have been through alone. You know, experience is what you learn while you have been through all those things, you know, and you, you can say that if he's progressing this much, it means that he's also a special athlete. And, and then Rustam Rustam doesn't even need any, anything to,
SPEAKER_03: like talk about him to explain who he is. You know, he's in my book, like probably one of the top five best arm masters. And then whenever I see these athletes, I just get so excited because they both are physically strong, mentally strong, and just like, it's incredible. Like, I really hope that fans are enjoying
SPEAKER_00: these meetings like as much as uh I do what do you think absolutely absolutely is for sure uh one of the best arm wrestlers ever walked this planet uh about Paul it's like you know you can catch uh this small shark and put it in a small jar and it will take a size yeah if you put that shark in a big proper tank
SPEAKER_03: put in by you in that ocean it's gonna grow to megalodon right yeah so what you are saying that he has potential to grow uh depending on where he is at you know and and yeah since he has been part of the east versus west and he he has been growing according to yeah yeah i agree
SPEAKER_02: i'm incredibly thankful for that and i'm excited to see some of the other u.s pullers get that opportunity too you know it's wonderful to have have this event in florida i can't wait for that aspect i'm so anxious about it um because i think that there there's a lot of guys over here too that when when when that when once they have that experience and that pressure they're going to elevate to it and i'm thankful to have had it
SPEAKER_03: and be able to continue in it because it's made me better, not just as an athlete, but as a person too. So I'm greatly, greatly appreciative. Yeah. I mean, everyone, I know how they prepare. I know how Paul, I know he's a patriotic guy in his homeland. I know he will do his best to win. And I know Rustam had
SPEAKER_03: just one injury and then second match, I don't think he was 100%, but still gave the toughest match lately to Irakli. And he's also coming to change some things. I will really feel bad for the one who loses because I wish they could both win, but we know that it's not possible, but it doesn't matter who wins. They don't lose anything, at least in my eyes, you know?
SPEAKER_02: that's why we do it that's why we do it it's the experience regardless like again i'm just thankful to be able to compete against a legend like russell not once but twice so i'm accepting of the outcome one way or the regardless but i'm just thankful to get that experience because i know at the end of the day either way it's gonna make me better yeah yeah for sure for sure you are that type of person yeah
SPEAKER_01: Rustam, I'm just making sure that Rustam is... Yeah, yeah, I understand. Rustam, Irakli's next match is Georgy Tautiev. How do you see that match?
SPEAKER_00: He said that, yes, it will be very uncomfortable for Irakli because of the height. But he said that in the straps Irakli will be more powerful. Because his arm is so strong right here.
SPEAKER_03: We will see. We will see. Tautiev is also taking it very seriously and we will see. So maybe let's talk just maybe one more thing to Rustam. Rustam, what did you think about Sasha versus Samusha match? Like, technically. It was a very interesting match. Very interesting and
SPEAKER_01: There was only endurance. It was also an unexpected match for me. I was sure that Sasha would win. It was so unexpected that I was surprised.
SPEAKER_00: Rustam is very surprised, very unexpected. He was relatively sure that Sasha was going to win and he believes that the endurance played the most important role in this match. And what does he think about Kamyshev?
SPEAKER_03: after all this like winning nine title matches in a row amazing man yeah i agree even even you take his hand he has the pronator and still incredible amazing one word amazing yeah you're right yeah
SPEAKER_03: Anyway, so let's talk about the Florida events. Let's start with you, Paul. How do you see John Birzing versus Leonidas match? Man, as far as the whole card goes, there's a lot of awesome matches. That's the one that I'm getting most questions on online.
SPEAKER_02: You know, most people reaching out and asking, what do I think about that match? I've learned a long time ago to never second guess John.
SPEAKER_02: The times when I think John might be an underdog or I think somebody might have a chance at him are usually, you know, I've learned from those mistakes. But that shit, I think it's a really, really interesting match because I have a huge respect for Leonidas, not just because he's a strong guy coming from, you know, bodybuilding and everything, but like I've gotten to pull with him a little bit and he knows what he's doing. He's not just a strong guy coming into arm wrestling.
SPEAKER_02: he's a guy who's learned to arm wrestle and he's learned the details um and i thought he was super impressive against uh schoolboy i did not have him pick the win there and the way he did it was very very impressive so i think i think we're going to see a really interesting match like i don't i don't think it's going to be super one-sided
SPEAKER_03: um but i i just have a feeling john is going to find a way to out arm wrestle him i'm not sure leonidas can control john's pronation i think that'll be the difference uh rushton i'm not asking who is the strongest arm master ever but i'm asking you the best arm master ever do you think john is the best arm master ever uh yes yes john oh no doubt right no no
SPEAKER_01: Now it's John. Maybe later. Maybe later. Maybe later. Maybe later. Maybe later. Maybe later. Maybe later. Maybe later. Maybe later. Maybe later.
SPEAKER_01: I think it's very worthy, well, it should be appreciated, not that someone won once or twice. That is, you can win once or twice, but to keep such a path and to be a champion all the time, especially in such categories, and to win the strongest, it costs a lot.
SPEAKER_00: yeah he he said absolutely john because nobody did this for uh as good and for as long time as he did and we have to appreciate that because he said yeah you can prepare for one or two wins uh you know and be the strongest for one or two times but we really have to recognize and appreciate that prolongated time and he's been winning his categories and the best and the strongest in the world
SPEAKER_03: for so long and yeah he's he said John is for sure maybe in the future somebody will be you know will outdo it but as of right now he said John for sure yeah yeah now people see 60 years old John and they question oh he wasn't that good in the past maybe arm wrestling was easy they have no idea
SPEAKER_03: When John was going on the stage, we all looked like we saw Ellie in there. The guy was incredible. Can you imagine a 95-kilo guy is just giving hell to the super heavyweights? A lot of people really don't know what they are talking about. I sometimes want to get involved in right there. I want to say, I mean, come on, man, what do you know?
SPEAKER_03: You were there, you know, just like you have no idea at all. Anyway, so everyone has the right to have an opinion, but I think I stick with my own opinion. I know enough. Anyway, so what do you think about John versus Leonidas Rustam? I don't know. Leonidas is good. I've seen a couple of his fights.
SPEAKER_01: If John, I think, prepares at least his average form, then John will beat him, he will beat him. But this is for me a completely new, well, a completely new, still green Leonidas, specifically Leonidas, I'm talking about him now, a new player in our game, so to speak. And it's hard, it's hard to assess now that he,
SPEAKER_01: can show and how stable he can do it. Well, I think John has an advantage in experience anyway. And he can beat him technically.
SPEAKER_00: some things that uh he doesn't know that he does that well uh he said i saw a few matches yes but uh he doesn't know him that well and he really believes that uh john if john will be able to prepare his middle form not not the best shape or something just a normal form
SPEAKER_00: he will just out arm wrestle because uh then this is new player in our game and he said yes but you know there is a level there is a levels and john uh most likely will apply his knowledge and just out arm wrestle him i understand yeah and and jerry versus kurdecha paul yeah i i think that's i think it's super interesting i you know you gotta wonder
SPEAKER_02: But you got to assume that Jerry competing stateside is going to bring his best form. And when you look at it, like fundamentally, Kardeccia has so many, he has so many tools that can make him such a great arm wrestler at that weight. But some of those tools could potentially play against him.
SPEAKER_02: that lever length and the height and his style could kind of fall into Jerry's game. I think I think this match is going to be super interesting and I think it's going to make for like a great finale to the event. I'm not sure who's going to win, but I think it's going to be one of those really entertaining long matches. I don't see it ending quickly at all. So if the match is longer,
SPEAKER_02: Who do you think is better under us? I think it favors Jerry as the match goes on, just based off of his career and how he's been able to have success in those long wars. We've seen him in so many like that to go back and forth. But I don't count Alex out one bit because I think he has a huge heart.
SPEAKER_02: We saw him against Morozov, and that was a war, you know, and he didn't back down one bit. So I would probably give the edge to Jerry if it goes into super deep water, but I can't count Alex out at all. And you, Rustam, what do you think about this match? If Kurdecha gets well prepared, at least he'll take the first two or three fights,
SPEAKER_01: And it will depend on the duration of each fight. Because Jerry, I know, can stay in his position for a long time. And Kurdecha can get a little stuck. I think 50 to 50. But that's my prediction.
SPEAKER_00: Rustam thinks that if Kurdecha will bring a good form, he will most likely get a first view, but it really depends on if GA will put him in a deep water, then GA will be favorized by this, because Kurdecha most likely will get pumped.
SPEAKER_00: uh sooner than jerry who is who can stand in his position for prolongated times but he said i i i would not give a big preference to either of those and it's going to be probably a 50 50 match very interesting yeah also very calculated yeah and rushtam who has the biggest chance to beat levan today
SPEAKER_03: No, maybe if he take mass, 10 kilo minimum. Yeah, last time when I saw him in Istanbul, his shoulders were big, his belly was small.
SPEAKER_03: know chest he looked very athletic very athletic not really fat and he was really big and you saw match with morozov right yeah how much kilo he was he was 140 i think i think he was under if i'm not mistaken maybe i'm mistaken but around there you know but he he was less fat less fat more muscle yeah yeah you're right you're right his thighs could really cause
SPEAKER_03: uh problems to uh lebanon yeah you're right anyways um so let's go to the next one michael versus camilla blonsky michael not monster michael and blonsky i think camille i think camille
SPEAKER_01: Kamil's technique won't work. The downside is that he doesn't change his technique. He only fights with one technique. If he doesn't get into his technique, there will be problems. I think he should get in, so we'll give Kamil the advantage.
SPEAKER_00: There's something that Camille, he said that the only issue that Camille is pulling only one-sided. And he said if he will not be able to get into it, then he have a problem. But he believes that he will get into his technique. Yeah, he giving him an edge. Yeah. Sion says AMC Ferit can beat Levan. I believe Levan is much stronger than...
SPEAKER_03: What was the guy's name? The blonde guy. I don't know my slab, you know, that match was very close match, but anyways, um, how do you see? Oh, I think, um, I think it's a good match and I don't,
SPEAKER_02: The flopper is press. If Michael was in his old form where he was completely open top rolling, King's move committed, I think I would possibly see this match differently. But after seeing him compete at King of the Table with his shoulder roll,
SPEAKER_02: And his ability, you know, he's gained mobility back towards his shoulder. He's able to stay tighter to his shoulder with his hand. And I think that could be the difference maker in this match. If Michael decides to cut across Camille and meet him there, I think we could see a similar scenario as we saw with Reno Masich when Reno pulled Camille.
SPEAKER_02: So if Michael can commit that way and we never see the match go to King's move, I think the match could favor Michael. But we'll know if he tries it right when he tries. And a lot of it's going to come down to timing.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Whoever is faster. And because we have seen Kamil also flash pin in Reno once he moves faster. Yeah. Yeah. I know Michael. Michael, after this surgery and everything, I think it's changed him, how he's approaching arm wrestling, how he's training for it. He's a different person. We've yet to see where he's gotten his level completely to. But I think he has more options. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: and some of the two american guys matches i will ask to paula and paul instead of rustam uh just let's start with paulo travis belgium versus corey west left arm you i know you are one of the right person to ask this question i am waiting for this match very much yes uh it's uh
SPEAKER_00: very hard to answer but i think corey may prevent uh travis from what he's usually doing because of his uh hand controllability and it's very possible that he will stop that thing but if uh they will not spend time with michael doing exactly that he's it's over chair is gonna win
SPEAKER_03: Okay. So you are basically always analyzing Travis all about the start. Only. Because Travis physically, Travis is not the strongest guy on the planet. And Corey is stronger than Travis physically. But it depends, you know, what is power? What is strength? You're talking about bicep, you're talking about back pressure, you're talking about riser, talking about finger, what do you, or coordination.
SPEAKER_03: What is the strength? And then which part really matters when you talk about when two guys are applying back pressure, which power is the most important there? That's exactly what it is. If Cody will play properly,
SPEAKER_00: and smart which is unlikely because he's not arm wrestling as much as you know Travis did so experience uh then Corey have a edge but I don't believe that he will outsmart Travis so are you really giving Travis small but edge because he is very very smart I understand and Paul
SPEAKER_02: Well, first off, Pablo really summed it up really well. And to piggyback off of what he said, I don't think that Travis possesses maybe one singular measurable element of strength advantage. Evgeny if you tested every finger down to a gripper, I think Corey would probably perform better than Travis in every measurable lift known to man.
SPEAKER_02: But the style in which Travis trains with the focus, like his back pressure, the way he trains it with bands, the towel, that's not going to create measurable strength. It's going to create functional strength. And then the way he applies it to set up. I really think this match is going to come down to not just the setup, but the leader. Obviously, Travis's left is way better than his right and his confidence level goes up with his left.
SPEAKER_02: We didn't see that same level of confidence against Kalina as we did against Derek Smith. And obviously they're different opponents, but I think a lot of that has to do with Travis's left arm and where he believes he can be with his left. And if he comes in there with that good energy and he controls the setup, meaning the referees and the energy between the two pullers, that's where his advantage is going to come from. And if he wins a round, it's going to be hard for Corey to win another one.
SPEAKER_02: but we could see corey absolutely shut it all down and end the train yep just boom has that ability to his hand is so wide his fingers are so thick and they're not just thick they're strong and he has that ability to just go boom and bring the match to him if that happens it's all over um this match uh i don't want prediction but only the percentage
SPEAKER_01: Rustam Babaiev vs Paul Levy. I don't like to give such percentages in advance. I already had problems with my chest, so it's better to see everything after the competition. I don't want to, I don't want to yet.
SPEAKER_00: rostam says uh i'm sorry guys but i already have problems with all these percentages last time it's supposed to costed me my chest so if you don't mind you will see okay at the tournament okay another question his only worry is his chest if his chest handles he believes his arm will handle as well
SPEAKER_01: You are worried about the chest. Do you think that if the chest will hold everything normally, the hand will withstand everything? The hand became stronger than it was before. I felt the opponent, I understand what I'm dealing with. First of all. Secondly, I haven't thought about it yet.
SPEAKER_01: He has already become smaller, yes, he was generally big, yes, now he is already a little on the side. I can strain, I can work with the guys at full strength, that's all. But this is not a competitive regime. That is, I have to go through a competitive regime in the hook, then I will understand what's next. At the moment, I'm doing everything to avoid a negative outcome, but we all walk under God, so ...
SPEAKER_01: I can only talk and prepare for something. We'll see how it goes there. God willing. So that everything is smooth.
SPEAKER_00: Rustam is saying that his arm gets even stronger. And yes, he has a little niche there about his chest. And he said, don't get me wrong, at the training process, I'm lifting at 100%. I'm working with my training partners on the table at 100%. But he said it's still different than actual match or competition. I need to pass that to get rid of that little niche.
SPEAKER_00: check mark in my head and then we will know i understand my opponent now i know exactly what i'm dealing with so he said right now we can talk as much as we want and i will be getting ready and we will see very soon and paul you any comment or you will also say that table will show yeah there's there's a 100 chance that i show up in the best form that i can bring and make no excuses
SPEAKER_00: Okay. Okay. Yeah. And let's go, let's go through another one. Matt mask versus large. Whoever is ready to answer.
SPEAKER_02: Whoever wants to answer. Man, that's a tough one. Lars being able to flop wrist makes it so interesting. I feel like Matt's on a good roll right now, though. I feel like if I'm judging the intangible stuff,
SPEAKER_02: I feel like Matt coming from Canada to Florida is going to be much easier for him. And I have a feeling that every match that Matt has at West versus West or King of the Table is that much more important to him. So I kind of lean towards Matt because I just think his energy is in the right place and the intangible stuff. And I think that'll have a bigger impact in style in this match. So I'll go with Matt.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know. After I saw Lars pulling Michael, and I know how Michael good was at the moment, I don't know. I would say yes, energy-wise, Matt should have taken that match, but I would not give anybody edge because Lars is endurance. Oh, my God. If he will stop him, I mean, what are you going to do? I think the way that...
SPEAKER_03: Matt Poole should be the way that he plays against Wagner. If he somehow gets caught here, it will be very hard for him. But if he just takes the center, then he may avoid the shoulder pressure. And what do we know? He can hook on the left. What do we know? Yeah, but there's left. Rustam, are you familiar with Tom Holland? Who was that again?
SPEAKER_01: Tom Holland. Tom Holland. Do you know Tom Holland? Yes, I know Tom. He's been living here for 4.5 hours. He wanted to come to us for a long time, to train with us. But it didn't work out for him. He broke down 4 times and didn't make it.
SPEAKER_00: He knows him, he lives not too far and he was trying to join the training session, but not yet. He was trying to do that like multiple times, four times, but he did not join them yet, but he's nearby. He knows. In general, he is one of the best hand-wrestlers in England. He understands very well technically, he feels his hand very well.
SPEAKER_00: He is saying that technically, technical abilities, he is top armwrestler in England. There are a few issues which Rustam would like to, you know, fix in him, but one of the top armwrestlers in England, definitely. And does he remember Craig Tullier?
SPEAKER_03: Do you remember Craig Tullier? I don't remember who Craig Tullier is. He's a skinny, skinny man, 50 years old. Is he from England? I don't understand. Would he be surprised if I tell him that Rustam has even pulled Craig Tullier in the past? But it was 23 years ago. 23 years ago, you say.
SPEAKER_03: Maybe. If I saw him, I would understand. But I don't remember his name. Wasn't that way down in weight, like 154 or something like that? Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was left arm, left arm. Yeah. Yeah, 2000 in Italy. We were all in the same category. I was there too, you know. And Rustam won with a hook, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: okay so i'm not gonna ask that much because he doesn't remember craig but how about what do you guys think craig versus i'm gonna win what do you think paul
SPEAKER_02: I have a lot of respect for Tom Holland, and I'm glad that he's getting over here to West versus West. He's such an X factor with his ability. If he stops the match, I would be amazed. If he does, then we're going to see something great. But Craig is the guy, man. Craig is the guy. Craig right now reminds me your one category below version. You just bought a very strong wrist in that.
SPEAKER_03: Like the hits with the goal. I don't know if you would agree, Paul, but they both start very, very aggressive, very dangerous and sideways. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah. Craig and people, people tend to forget, um, that Craig Craig's only been over here one time and he, he lost, he lost the Samusha who now we're talking about like the greatest ever in the category potentially. So it's Craig, Craig's the guy he's, he's, he's the best we have over here. Craig, Craig, I have invited many, many times. He wasn't available sometimes because of the work sometimes because of some other things, but I never forget about Craig, you know, and.
SPEAKER_03: Or either he had some other matches or something like this. Yeah. And yeah, let's talk. Let's talk about more matches. Giannis Amolins, Justin Bishop. What do you think, Pablo?
SPEAKER_00: janice will win uh just justin is very powerful he's very fast and he he's very good arm wrestler but uh there is a levels and uh yeah janice janice's level up from uh justin i'm not saying that he's stronger but he's definitely a better arm wrestler and he i will give him an edge a big one like 60 40. i think i think justin has a really good chance
SPEAKER_02: i think justin has a decent um history with yannis i think they know each other pretty well and i i rank in the united states as far as technical arm wrestlers go i rate justin really high so a lot of it comes down to which form both athletes are going to bring i know yannis has been active but um
SPEAKER_02: not necessarily on on the same stage um justin's got a couple matches at east versus west uh to go off of so i'm i think it's going to come down to who brings the best form and i know justin's preparing so i i'm i'm pretty confident that uh that justin has a solid chance to win it okay ruslan todd hutchings versus evgeny prudnik
SPEAKER_01: Todd Hutchings is gaining momentum at this age. I see it strongly. And, in general, if Zhenya is not prepared, he will come, as he probably came last time, or not prepared, I thought so. Well, at least it seemed to me so, purely subjective my opinion. Then maybe Todd Hutchings will win.
SPEAKER_01: But in general, I think it depends a lot on how Prudnik prepares. But Toto has a lot of chances.
SPEAKER_00: i'm saying that uh yeah the hutchinson his age is amazing and he is still on high gears going forward uh he said that uh last time prudnik in his opinion was a little bit under underprepared and he said listen if he if eugene prudnik will show up at the same way then that have a very very good chances but it's very very it depends on how good uh
SPEAKER_02: will be yes yeah and what do you think Paul I think Todd um it's hard to go off of um the last two matches um in that in that um prudnik's pulling possibly one of the best top rollers at that weight and Todd was pulling
SPEAKER_02: one of the best hookers so they were both like it's tough to take that and say okay well Iraq Lee Iraq Lee handled prudnik so prudent so prudnik is going to have a hard time against Todd I think it's gonna be a completely different match that said I don't think that there's a whole lot of time between events for those guys to gain or lose or you know there's just not a whole lot of time um do you think that different styles
SPEAKER_02: may make difference because they didn't really allow, you know, Prudnik to use his drill. Yeah, that's kind of my point. If Prudnik is able to control Todd's hand a little bit more and take away Todd's pronator, then I think Prudnik wins the match. But we haven't seen any top rollers recently have a lot of success against Todd.
SPEAKER_02: um i think i i think todd based off of both of their last two forms just general forms i think todd's the favorite but i think we could also see a scenario where prudnik tries one lane and then finds another one that works i understand and power oh sorry sorry paul i thought you finished sorry no no no i i have i have todd as a slight favorite i think i think i think he's getting better which is so weird at that age
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, piggyback both Rustam and Paul and yeah, absolutely. It's a very interesting match again to see. We saw domination from Prudnik over Tad and I think that things may change because as Rustam said that Prudnik's preparation changes a little bit lately.
SPEAKER_00: and now i can see that uh so it's more of the endurance matches which will not be a good idea against that hutchins because his endurance is amazing uh and uh power wise that is still progressing i have no way i mean i do have an idea how he doing that but um
SPEAKER_03: and now I would give him a very good chance probably five percent edge on that Hutchings okay so this one uh let's go um Jonathan Breda versus Aymeric predines that's so hard for me to predict left on today today Jonathan brother
SPEAKER_02: He wrote me, Engin, I'm very strong right now. I don't know where he just wrote me this. Yeah. I mean, when you look at left arm in the United States, Brita's up there for sure. And after seeing Aymeric handle Robbie Topey, I do think Brita would do well against Robbie. So to me, this was a toss up. I'm really not sure.
SPEAKER_00: i'm really not sure but um if brita is in his best form he has he 100 has a good chance it's a little bit depends on the styles but brida is a bad bad guy left-handed sometimes uh i pulled him uh about two years ago we pulled 17 ready goals
SPEAKER_00: At the Silver Bullet, I pulled the win at the very last match. It was best of six. We pulled the seven. So you guys were basically head-to-head, huh? Head-to-head at 230 pounds. He is a bad, bad guy, yes. Okay. Rustam, Dave Chaffee, Frank Lampirelli. I think Dave Chaffee.
SPEAKER_03: Dave Chaffee have a big arm, long arm, and uncomfortable for Lampirelli. Yeah, you know what I'm thinking, you know, both guys can win. But even if Lampirelli has the top row and wrist, lately Dave also has that risk pressure that he show against
SPEAKER_03: Lallatin also showed against Ermes Gasparini. Ermes couldn't pin him if he didn't have the shoulder pressure because he was still not able to pin him in a classic way. But he just pulled him this way, bring his shoulder and then press that way. So I think it will be a very tough match, you know, even if Frank top rolls him. But we don't know which shape
SPEAKER_03: Dave is in here. Maybe he's close to past, maybe not. I mean, if he's close to the past, it will be hard day for Frank, but we will see. What do you guys think? Yeah, I agree with you definitely. If Dave is closer to his previous shapes, then yeah, unfortunately it's going to be a bad day for Lampirelli. But lately Lampirelli is on his...
SPEAKER_00: up trajectory and unfortunately dave was sitting somewhere on a plateau not being so it's it's very interesting match yeah uh the size wise as rostam says yeah dave is uh probably bigger frame and wider a little bit but uh it was very good at the monster match it's the very good very good armrest yeah and paul
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, Frank Lampirelli is a guy I didn't know much about until seeing him compete at West versus West. And then seeing him against Matt Mask and Michael in the war against Michael, huge, huge respect. And I think that this match right now, based off of where both guys are at trajectories, I think it makes a lot of sense. Obviously, it's hard to know where Dave Tom's at, but I do think the match could come down to it.
SPEAKER_02: just sheer side pressure and dave has always had that i think i think he's the favorite uh coming into the match but i wouldn't be surprised if it's an absolute war yeah and elizabeth versus alexandra ozereva i i think i think elizabeth um learned a lot the first time she came to over um and i've spoken to her afterwards several times
SPEAKER_02: And I think a lot of times, like the first time you come over there is like overwhelming. And sometimes that can play on the outcome or the way you respond to it. And I think she's taken that experience and she's come back and she's worked harder. I have a feeling that she's going to win pretty comfortably. And a lot of that's based off of me kind of following her training videos.
SPEAKER_02: She's moving weights in the gym that are that of a strong man. She's benching more than me. Yeah, I'm telling you. It's weirdo stuff. Like the 120-pound dumbbells. So I think she comes in as a favorite. But this is a very interesting match, too, because I'm not sure what those two ladies' record are against each other in the past. But I'm pretty sure they have pulled and gone back and forth.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, last three matches. Artem Taranenko, Mindaugas Tarasaitis. Rustam, are you familiar with Artem Taranenko and Mindaugas? I think Mindaugas. But Mindaugas 77 kilo, Artem is 85 kilo. Still Mindaugas? Yes, yes. Mindaugas have more experience.
SPEAKER_00: and Paolo I love Artem and he's uh unorthodox style but I still mean Douglas uh is a favorite I pulled both that let's uh and uh power wise they are very very close but Mendoza will find will find a way to prevent Artyom from doing his position
SPEAKER_00: um but it's very interesting match if if it will go into this trap and artyom archie was very fast yes very fast if he will gain what he's looking for it's it's going to be a huge war for sure i mean paul well when you were talking a little bit earlier to rustem about like um
SPEAKER_02: uh, John in his early career and, uh, all the things he was able to do at lighter weights and his versatility and everything. I got caught up in that conversation. I thought we were talking about. Um, he's clearly the greatest arm wrestler ever to live. Um, and he comes in as a strong favorite.
SPEAKER_02: But that said, I do think the weight gap could play something into this. And I always support Artem, man. That's my guy. I'm rooting for him hard. And when we're there, I'll do my best to put as much positive energy in his corner. And I wouldn't be surprised if he pulls something crazy out. But listen, when you get your second ever West versus West match or your first right arm West versus West match, and they put you up against the greatest arm wrestler ever to live,
SPEAKER_03: it's a huge opportunity so yeah paul you're doing all this with such a straight face people will really screen record and they will share it anyway so anyways um yeah paul talbot rest there they can um rustam you know you know you know rest but do you know paul culbert
SPEAKER_00: no no all right okay that's what i was thinking and let's start with you paulo rash is freak paul is more of the freak i have no idea i believe that paul will be able to slice through rash but uh
SPEAKER_00: It's very hard to say. If Reg will stick somewhere, anywhere, but the head, whatever, it doesn't matter, then Reg will pull it out. But it's an unpredictable match. The thing I know, Paul's ability with his left arm is amazing. And most likely, and I believe so, he will pin it. But it's very possible that Reg will stop it.
SPEAKER_02: If Rash stopped, that's it. It goes Rash side. Do you agree with that, Paul? Nope. It depends on the position? No, I know too much. I know too much right now. I talk to Paul too much. If you're listening, go to State Kings right now and buy a block for Paul.
SPEAKER_02: I talked to this guy too much. I pulled with him too much over time. And I've seen the different versions at lighter weights and where he's at now and where his gym numbers are at now and what he's doing with Dave Chaffee at practice, left arm. And I know it's only his left arm, but we're talking about a 190-pound person. He's a special dude.
SPEAKER_02: um he's a guy that that we need you know representing us in the west because his professionality his approach and his tenacity um i i do think it's an amazing match and i know paul has an absolute ton of respect for reg and this is a match he was trying to get in stateside for quite some time but i just have a lot of confidence that paul talbot is going to be the weirdest version of him we've ever seen and and and paul is you think uh
SPEAKER_03: amongst the americans the best 187 left arm in the us right now yep without a doubt he might he might he can he can transcend up those weight classes okay okay let's go to the really really really spicy match i'm sorry i'm sorry one one one one thing okay the only one match i lost at the monster factory
SPEAKER_00: I think that's the only one I lost there. What was it? Paul Talbott. Left hand, Paul Talbott. I lost one of the matches. One round? One round. I won 3-1, but I lost a round. And you were much bigger than him, right? You were much bigger than him? Oh, yeah. I was 40 pounds on him. And right now he is in even better shape, Paul? Yes.
SPEAKER_02: yeah yeah okay if that's if that's the case then you know yeah he's weird man weird right what do you think what do you guys think about dog early versus hunter knows so um this is a really interesting and important match in my opinion for the united states um and you and i have talked before about like
SPEAKER_02: you know, the people that you're looking at and, you know, the guys you have eyes on. And Hunter Knopf obviously is one of those guys. And this is a unique opportunity here where we're having our first ever West versus West in the United States. And we get to see that guy that everybody is touting as the guy. And then we get to see that guy against another, like, already established puller.
SPEAKER_02: at uh at a really high level who has the experience um i i give an edge an experience to doug and basically because i don't know a whole lot about hunter other than what i'm seeing on the internet however i think it's it's a unique opportunity to see what that next next generation of guys is bringing and i think it's gonna it's it's developing a whole lot of hype around here
SPEAKER_02: um but i just you know i i like look it's u.s versus u.s match so whoever wins is good for the united states but um we get to see experience versus that new gen and paulo uh don't know will not predict because uh yeah i saw only few matches on the internet that's all i know about the guys so not not not okay yeah
SPEAKER_03: So let's finish. Rustam, my friend, my legendary friend, thank you very much for coming to our podcast again. And I wish you good luck in Orlando. And Paul, my friend, thank you again. And I also wish you good luck, healthy preparation.
