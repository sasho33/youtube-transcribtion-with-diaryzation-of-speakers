SPEAKER_04: Oh, okay, okay. I forgot to turn the sound on. Now must be okay. Yeah, yeah, I just turned on, yeah. Must be okay now. Hello?
SPEAKER_04: gianluca i started training yesterday what did i do wrist and front wrist which you guys call riser and today i did all kind of shoulder stuff you know and i did some finger extension you know i have i have a old
SPEAKER_04: Protein powder box. So I put weights in it. So I put my hand into it and then just hold it like this and lift it, you know? So it is really helping outside of forearm. Health is better. Health is better. After I came back from West-West, I had really high fever and all night sweating, you know? Everything was getting wet, you know?
SPEAKER_04: I was changing my t-shirt all the time. And now it's okay. Now it's okay. Yeah. Thank you, my friend. Thank you. Most likely I won't be able to go to Florida. Thank you, Paner. Thank you. Thank you, Benji. Okay.
SPEAKER_04: Douglas came. Hello, Douglas. How are you, my friend? Good. How are you doing? About Stefano Cristo, I did two things I shared with my friends yesterday on my Facebook. There's not much to say. It's a sad day. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: When, but again, you know, just because you missed what I shared, you don't need to come here and question, you know, just. And again, even after his big health problems look better than 90% of population, not really. So how is everything? What's the weight? Uh, weights on point. I'm like, I'll have like a six to eight pound water cut.
SPEAKER_03: So you are right there. Yeah, I'm right there. I just got to maintain from here. That was the plan. The preparation for this was just to mainly just stay healthy and not get injured training, you know, overtraining. Yeah. You're looking like you're feeling better. Yeah, yeah, I saw that. Yeah, this guy...
SPEAKER_04: This is about 10 days ago. He was in Istanbul. It was sad. You never know. We all make plans for the future. But he was trying to save someone on the river. Yeah, I saw that. It was a young boy or something that was having trouble. Does anybody know if he saved him? Or how did that happen?
SPEAKER_03: I hope he did. That's so sad. We get that a lot down here in Destin. They have the riptides and stuff. People don't know how to get out of them over here in the ocean. There's at least a handful of tourists that drown every year, it seems like. Someone gets stuck and then someone goes out there for them and then
SPEAKER_03: yeah it's just that's no never any good uh i see the comment that they both didn't make it that sucks i mean it sucks for anybody to lose anyone but
SPEAKER_04: My friend, you think it is easy to come to Orlando just like you come into Istanbul, but there is a long visa procedure and last one month I was trying to survive, you know. Yeah, so just don't tell me what to do and this and this. If haters wants to see me, you know, I'm sure they can find me. I would love to see them as well, you know.
SPEAKER_04: Anyway, so, yeah, I mean, the guys are just writing just nonsense things. It's ridiculous. I've been getting a lot of that lately. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey, Carl Superman Stanley, good to see you. Anyway, so...
SPEAKER_04: let's let's answer and travis will join us oh cool i did uh i did message hunter he uh he said he said got it i'll i'll be there so i guess he should be coming in any minute yeah yeah a lot of people that have been you know saying like engine like
SPEAKER_04: uh we wish that you know they were pulling against the guys from east instead of pulling against each other yeah and but that is something that naturally happened you know and yeah so you guys somehow get into that how do you guys call beef you know yeah yeah and then yeah and then just sometimes you need to give
SPEAKER_04: uh people what they want instead of what i want to give them so i mean looks like as of now that is the match that people in north america wants to see the most so whenever i i talk about this on the facebook
SPEAKER_04: and majority of the people uh on facebook i have just like friends from north america so in on facebook people get crazy but whenever i post it on instagram which is more like international so less people are aware so the interest on instagram is this much interest on the facebook this much you know so
SPEAKER_04: But that is something that North Aymeric really want to see. And then so we just give them what they want to see. And especially a lot of people will come there in person and watch it.
SPEAKER_04: yeah yeah so if it i wouldn't set this match in istanbul but in in us it makes good sense you know that's west versus west they say and i mean even from the first east versus west to the last one we always had east versus east matches in istanbul so why not west versus west in u.s you know so
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, you know, that's every Istanbul event has West versus West. And this situation, this situation kind of happened organically where, you know, my name would get thrown in to conversations, not by me. Somebody would, you know, Hunter would do something really good, win a tournament. Somebody would comment and say, oh, Doug's the best under 180. And then Hunter would reply. Then I felt like I needed to reply. So it wasn't really –
SPEAKER_04: uh it's just kind of it just kind of happened you know i haven't been pulling in the states in a while and um hunter just told you to cut your hunter just said that he cannot answer that that's why i wanted you to tell him to take tell him to copy him here do you want i'm i'm just trying okay i i just i just no no i i just asked if he made out this i will send through email probably we will make some
SPEAKER_03: uh when i get it through messenger i have to copy and paste it into my web browser and then open it up through there and then it'll go straight to the link yeah some people having this this kind of uh problems while some don't have any so let's see for some reason when i click on the link it won't directly open my app so i have to put it in my web browser and then it offers me to go to my app
SPEAKER_03: anyways what did you did you watch um the last event from start to finish i i i got myself a bunch of healthy snacks so i could keep my weight down but um i laid them all out on the table and i was by myself all day so i was able to just turn it on put it on the big screen and watch it it was there was some amazing matches
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, yeah, yeah. But it is just like interesting, you know. Like, you know, when I was a kid, like, there was Mike Tyson in the 80s, the best boxer. And then because of the time difference, we had to wait like 4 a.m., 5 a.m. sometimes in the morning to watch. We wait, the eyes are closing, but we are stubborn. We just wait, wait, and then the match starts.
SPEAKER_04: Round one, boom, the guy goes down and we go back, you know? Yeah. I just, yeah, I just, so that, that is just like, for example, Daddycam versus Petrenko. I mean, who is the champion? Daddycam is the champion before the match. So you need to bring him the best challenger. And after a few matches, we saw that it's Petrenko. So you bring the match.
SPEAKER_04: I mean, you can't really control if Petrenko is the dominant. Yeah, I didn't expect that one. That was a really big surprise to me. I was kind of a toss-up, but I was leaning towards Dadakan, but I was really surprised. Somebody came. Oh, Travis is here. Hey, Travis. Gentlemen, how are we?
SPEAKER_00: Good, good. We are waiting for Hunter. Tell Hunter that I always copy it from my messenger and I text it to myself. And then once it's in my text, I can click right on it, brings me right in. If not, got to do all that manual bullshit that gets you all jacked up.
SPEAKER_03: yeah it does the same to me if i click on it in my messenger it won't bring me straight to the app but if i text it to myself or post it in my browser it'll give me the option to go to my app maybe maybe you somehow can you tell him without using like are you on the phone right now using the phone or computer i'm using the phone yeah i'm on my phone yeah trust me he don't want me helping him that'd be two dumb ass rednecks messing around with with some sort of technology but
SPEAKER_04: mean i don't know if he can just all you got to do is hold it down and copy it and then text it to himself yeah um there is one guy saying that tell travis not to comment events again he says you are too biased
SPEAKER_04: You know, I will tell you something. It is impossible to make people happy. Devon does too quiet. Travis does too something. Rymus does too, like, don't let Rymus. Neil does something. Like, this is, like, impossible. Impossible. Justin, like, you sometimes give the people the whole world, still you can't make them happy. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: I want to watch, I can't, I need to watch and listen to Devon. I haven't heard his voice yet. Yeah. Uh, let me invalid meeting invalid meeting ID. Hey, bring your phone over here. Hey, you have Hunter's number, Doug. I don't.
SPEAKER_04: Do you have it, Ingen? No, I reach him by messenger. Mask him for his phone number. I'll call him from my wife's phone right now. Okay. Justin let me. Okay. I will tell him what's your phone number. If anyone has Hunter's number, put it in the comments so everybody has it. No, no. Hold on.
SPEAKER_04: Travis, 864-992. All right, hold up here, hold up here, hold up here, hold up here. One second, one second. I'm writing to Travis. Devon't give the number. Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey, look, man, I'm trying to get this dude spammed and up all night. Okay, one second. Copy, and then here is... I just sent you by messenger.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I got you. All right, well, now watch me. Oh, okay, I see. Get back.
SPEAKER_04: Travis, you are a great arm wrestler. Yeah, I was. I was. No, no, no. You are just coming back. Let me finish. You're a great arm wrestler. You have been one of the best in the past. But I have no doubt, one, two, three matches, you will be right there. Justin talk with him, and then I will continue. Hey, dude, it's Travis. How are you?
SPEAKER_00: Can you go to your messenger and you see that invitation, right? Listen, if you just hold your hand on it and then copy it and then go to your text and text that to yourself, and then once it's in your phone, it'll pick up Safari right away when you click on it, you can go right in.
SPEAKER_00: yeah just hold it and then once it pops up to copy it or share it just copy it then go to your text and open up your yeah open up your text hit the compose button so you can send it to somebody and then up there in the top um go ahead and put your own number type your phone number in there
SPEAKER_00: And then, and then paste it in the course, in the, in the, in the body. And then once it comes through, it'll pop right up on your phone, then go in there and see if you can hit it. That's how I do it. Cause I could, I can't do it for my message. All right. Good luck. All right. So what I was going to tell you that, um, you,
SPEAKER_04: I mean, yes, you were one of the best for sure. But like, like when I say that I'm a fan of an arm master, you know, it's just like jumpers and not you. But about the way that you analyze West versus West matches, because you have been a commentator
SPEAKER_04: I mean, I could listen to you hours, you know. You're talking about this. Man, don't make me blush, man. Devon't make me blush. No, no, no. That is the truth. That is the truth. The way that you analyzed it, the way that you, I don't know. I love it. I love it. I'm not only talking about the commentary. I'm talking about when you make program with Artem Taranenko and you talk about it, you analyze everything, you know. It's just, I mean, incredible. Incredible, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Well, Ingen, so listen, Ingen, when you hit big time, which is about to come, you take me with you. I'm like Joe Rogan to the UFC. Of course, man. Of course, there is no one better. There is no one better. Got you. Got it. All right. Let's make sure when you hit. When you hit, I'm going in, baby. Of course, man. Did Hunter make it yet? There is no party without Travis Bajan. No Hunter yet?
SPEAKER_04: uh not yet so somebody is asking somebody is asking how much bigger is douglas versus hunter 15 to 20 pounds right now no i i know for sure that i don't think douglas is any heavier than no we weigh the same right now i i replied to yes yeah we wait we wait we weigh pretty much exactly the same right now
SPEAKER_00: But that question is not... Really, what that guy's asking is, it's implied that Hunter can get to the 154s and that...
SPEAKER_00: Doug can only get to 165 in, and I'm just talking about if there is a life or death situation and you have to get to that weight, I think that it is true that Hunter traditionally is a five kilogram, smaller framed man. He's definitely the smaller, he's definitely the smaller frame guy, but like I've,
SPEAKER_03: way i carry my weight i'm going to be a lot bigger than him but he's he's uh he told me he's between 180 183 right now for him to make 154s ever again would be tough i don't think he's no doubt no doubt yeah i just think that like some guys are so little their only dream is getting bigger
SPEAKER_00: Right. And every day of their fucking life, they're dedicated to it. Right. And, you know, whether it's the supplements, the medication, the eating, the becoming a man and getting older and not fighting it, because truthfully, you fight it if you want to be great at a weight class.
SPEAKER_00: Right? Like, you're 20 years old. I mean, I was there. Craig Touje and Ray Henderson and walking around pulling the 132s and the 143s. That's where they handled their sales. That is Hunter Nolts, in my opinion, in 2000, he would have been most likely trying to make 143s.
SPEAKER_00: at that tournament in Virginia Beach when the best of the best of the best are there because that's what you do. Justin like a good wrestling team. You got two dudes, both of you weigh 150. You're both bad motherfuckers. One of you can get to 143 because he has the fucking heart and discipline and the other one's like, come on, bro. You do it. I don't want to do it. And if we build our best team ever and where I think Hunter will make a name for himself
SPEAKER_00: is at the 154 and 165 class. He's gonna tell you 165, and listen, Doug, don't get it twisted, bro. Like, do not get it twisted. You and a couple guys that you grab a hold of think you can beat this guy. Because in our hearts and dreams,
SPEAKER_00: He runs you over so that he can actually be the West versus West champion. We will find out. Ingen will find out. What caliber of a match does Hunter get against the first European will be a direct result as to what he sees on August 10th. He's not getting a match. All right.
SPEAKER_00: Listen, just know that you are fucking up this promotion as well, Doug. I feel like I'm capable of getting that title too now. I know. I'm not saying that you don't. I'm just telling you what we don't know about Hunter. The mystery of him is what is the tsunami. That's the tsunami, right? And I also, Engin, just so you know,
SPEAKER_00: From the world, this might not be that big of a match in Europe and maybe in the world, but listen, when it comes from the Confederacy of the United States, right? When you're talking about anything or no, the Union, who's the West? Whoever the South was, wherever that Confederate flag is jumping around, all of those states,
SPEAKER_00: They have a big problem with any 175-pound man saying they're the guy. And it's always been like that, from Chad Silvers to Craig Tuye to Justin Bishop to Doug Erlich to now Hunter. They got a problem with each other first.
SPEAKER_00: And sometimes they become teammates and they become cool, but not all the time. There is animosity in that region as to who the middleweight champ is. And this has been going on for 30 years since I've been around Armis. Do you feel that, Doug? Do you understand what I'm saying?
SPEAKER_03: Do you recognize that to this part of the country, this match is a big deal? Yeah, I agree. And, you know, to touch on your point prior to that is him winning, you know, the mystique of him winning the match. And let's say he runs me over and, you know, that's going to springboard him right into a massive match with a European. And that would be a good storyline.
SPEAKER_03: maybe next year but uh as far as yeah i mean i look i'm almost 40 years old and this this guy keeps on getting online calling me grandpa and i'm gonna put you in retirement i'm like god damn i'm grandpa now like that hurt a little bit i wish i was your age i know what you mean yeah
SPEAKER_04: so one week from checking into an old folks home what do you think he feels he'd love to be 40. i mean yeah i i just sent him like three emails and then from messenger and everything you know but let's see i i don't know why you are able to answer
SPEAKER_00: and you this dude can't even get on this zoom call and you expect him to be i have struggled on that on the back end of a trying to get into one of these meetings before man so that's why that's the only reason i even know to do what i just told you to do is because for some reason if your computer or phone is not hooked up to the proper internet service oh oh oh oh i just saw something
SPEAKER_04: Connecting to audio. Did you just say Douglas that he cannot even enter Zoom and how can he beat you? Yeah, if he can't even get on a Zoom call, how is he going to beat me? What do you say about this, Hunter? I don't know. It looks like the retirement home is taking care of him in his golf suit. You look pretty cute. What the fuck is that? You're going to feel it.
SPEAKER_03: You're going to feel it real soon. You're going to feel it real soon. Man, come on, man. You look like you just climbed out of a mine shaft. Where the fuck you at? Hey, some of us got to do sand work out here. I don't get to sit in the office and sell insurance all day. Keeps me fresh. Keeps me young.
SPEAKER_00: So Hunter, right before you got on the call, we were kind of discussing that there's a deep-rooted bit of, say, competitive fire, maybe animosity, not a lot of love that comes from the whole, just the southern part of our country and its history.
SPEAKER_00: with the middleweight guy whether it's been the the problem between you know dave patton craig touye chad silvers there's always been a little bit of animosity there when i'm watching you and doug and this thing happen i i can see to where there's more there's it's not just you two but there's other people involved that really don't want
SPEAKER_00: you to be on the rise and getting the sort of, I guess, notoriety that you are getting. And just so you know, the banner that's going around is that you're going to run through this guy and that you are our next hope. And maybe, besides Todd Hutchings, our only hope for someone to put one of these West First West belts around you.
SPEAKER_01: Do you feel the animosity in the South between you and Doug? And am I correct about all that? I mean, yeah, I'd say I agree. But, I mean, it's not necessarily a bad thing. I wouldn't say it's such a negative thing. I mean, I love it. You know what I'm saying? That's what keeps me going. That's what gets me up in the morning. That's what puts a fire to my ass. And I love it. You know, the more they talk, the more they hate, whatever. Justin know the belt will be in the South.
SPEAKER_01: Once I get through Doug, whoever else they want to put in front of me, that's fine. All I need is a two-week notice. That's it. Man, I'm glad these things are live, man. It's going to be really, really disappointing when you run into this wall. You've been going around to these little tournaments at these local fairs and stuff. That ain't like pulling me home. I hope you make it through the whole event without getting hurt. Every time I turn around, you're getting hurt. Let's see you make it through the whole event first.
SPEAKER_03: I've been injured twice. I've been injured twice. That's it. So you better be careful not making the third. I'm so glad you're meeting me in the middle talking shit. Because when you hit this wall, I promise you, I've already got things planned out that I'm going to say to you during the match, after the match.
SPEAKER_03: I'm going to rip my shirt off on stage right in front of everybody just so you can see what's really under this fucking shirt. I'm going to humiliate you, Hunter. Mask my words. Hunter, you have not pulled anyone like me. You keep saying, oh, your buddies, your little nut riders that you got on your team. Oh, he pulls better and stronger guys than you at practice and all this stuff.
SPEAKER_03: You go pull Chad, go beat all them. And then you went and lost two rounds in that round robin. So are them two dudes better than your whole team? You know what I'm saying? Justin know, 3-0, baby. $100, next world champion.
SPEAKER_04: That's good confidence. That's good. I love to see every, every, every top Aymeric guy to say this way, you know, no matter what the result will be, but that needs to be the mindset. You know, I don't like when a lot of people are just like, oh, it's just too tough for us. So let's just.
SPEAKER_04: playing, you know, our own, you know, just like that. I mean, of course, not everyone can step up to that stage, right, Travis? But just some people need to represent the country, right, Travis? No doubt. And I'm telling you, man, listen. Listen, Doug is in a tough position here. Doug's in a tough position because I'm telling you, if you don't live at Doug's house or you don't train with Doug,
SPEAKER_00: then you are hoping that this is our guy, that we have a guy that can battle in his weight class on the stage in Istanbul. So I just think it's awesome. I think it's awesome. And I love the contrast of the attitudes because Doug is so serious.
SPEAKER_00: And I think it's going to be hard to keep the comedy out of and the look, you know, out of Hunter's face. And, you know, I'm interested because, listen, I know or at least my opinion of Doug is that he can be prickly at times. And if you have too much fun, he might not think it's fun. And I can see Hunter, he ain't going to notice whether you're
SPEAKER_00: laughing or crying. He's just gonna go right through the routine. He's gonna be very aggressive. And if he does be successful, it is going to springboard your promotion from North Aymeric. And so it's it's gonna be it's gonna be quite the spoiler if if Doug's able to put the brakes on and actually, you know, beat this guy.
SPEAKER_03: Travis did say anybody who's brave enough to rock the beard without the mustache is different. Hey, look, I'll make a bet with this dude. I'll shave my beard off. You shave yours off, whoever loses. Because I want to see that weak-ass chin you got under that. Because that's the reason why you rocked that beard. I can tell you got a soft-ass jaw. I can tell you got a soft jaw. Hey, we can test it out. I'll show you how soft it is. I'm new at this sport.
SPEAKER_01: Hey, I'm doing this. You don't want that. You don't want that. Man, you this big, dude. Conor McGregor. This dude think he's Conor McGregor over here. Hey, you like a generic version of Kobe Cubs. You talk all that shit and came back half of it up. Hey, I promise you, your tune's going to change when you feel this.
SPEAKER_03: There's levels to this game, Hunter. You pulled nothing. Hunter, you ain't pulled nothing but chunks, bro. Name one dude. The dude's giving you wars I'm playing with at practice. The dude's giving you wars I'm playing with. Like, it's clear.
SPEAKER_04: The guys that I'm toying with are giving you wars, bro. You are too small. And I'm going to show you. I'm going to put my hand over your head. I'm going to pat you on your head the way Todd Hutchings does. You're about to bust a damn head gasket over there. What's the weight class? Do these guys got to weigh in again? Yes, yes, yes. 170. Which is what in pounds, guys? What does that mean? 170 is the pounds, you know. It cannot be kilograms, right? They are not leveled on.
SPEAKER_00: 77 kg, 170 pounds. Oh, I thought he said 117 kilos. I was like, what? All right, so it's 170 pounds. So are you losing weight, Doug, or where are you at? I'm six pounds away. So you're going to be coming into this thing losing weight and a hunter, no problem making that? Yeah, I'm like 215 right now. I got that no problem. Travis, Travis. Travis said he's 215 on the weekend.
SPEAKER_04: Travis and him don't weigh 215. Travis, if the Eastern European pullers, if they had only 10% of the ability of this threshold that these two are doing, I mean, our masking would be right here. I hope, this is what I hope. I hope, like Devon, because Devon even commented right in the boardroom. He said, listen, gentlemen, I urge you
SPEAKER_00: to get engaged with your opponent. And what I do is I'll make that call before the promotion starts and say, hey, listen, is there anything off limits, right? If I say anything about your daughter, about your country, about your grandmother, what's off limits?
SPEAKER_04: I'm not sure that these two guys have done that. I'm pretty sure they haven't. This is just naturally happened, you know, naturally. And I want you to know. After Hunter won against the guy from Sweden and then Douglas just got all jealous. Justin joking. Hey, the dude I beat, beat him easier than Hunter did. I ain't worried about it.
SPEAKER_04: All I know is that I don't think they had that calling, and I want you to know that this is a serious, serious matter. Yeah, and that is what North Aymeric wanted to see, you know, and that's why I said it. That's what I was trying to explain. When I talked about announcing this match on Instagram, the interest is not so big. Well, when I did on Facebook, because I have a lot of North Aymeric friends on Facebook, then the interest is
SPEAKER_04: off the roof you know just like a lot of them are thinking that this is the best match on the card you know so you need you have to give this match to the the american fans yeah and and another question for you hunter this match is at 170 and but are you still able to make 154 or is it like too late for that oh he's gone
SPEAKER_04: This the dude you putting me up against thinking? This dude can't even stay on a Zoom call. Yeah, maybe that's about internet. He's scared. I knew it was tough. When I saw that beat up Chevy going through the back road, I knew we was going to have a very limited time. It's the beard with the mustache. I have to say, Hunter, this guy, now you left, he continued.
SPEAKER_04: talking shit behind you. He said you are scared and that's why you left. He said what, Alex? He said that you were scared and that's why you left the Zoom chat. Yeah, that's it. That's it. I was terrified. I had to hang up real quick and get my thoughts together. So the question is, can you still make 154 or is it too late for the future? I mean, I could, possibly. Possibly, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Because I'm just thinking that, like, I mean, it's totally up to you, of course, that, you know, I think that. Basically, what Engin's saying is when you lose to me, he's going to want you to go down and wait to compete down there. That's not what I'm saying, Hunter. Oh, hold on. You can be sure about it. Yeah, yeah, that's not what I'm saying, but, yeah. It is, but, I mean, it's all good. We're good. No, no, I'm just saying that, I'm just saying that,
SPEAKER_04: Is this still option? We have Atlas, for example, Daniel Prokopchuk, Mindaugas, they can pull both 170 and 187. There are people that can pull two categories. I was just thinking that can you also do... I could make 54 with the right diet and with the right preparation, but it's not really...
SPEAKER_04: inside what is the class you have you have a 170 class engine and then no 165 class no no no there was 165 but just i wanted to start 154. so i made it 154 170 187 and then yeah so maybe in the future we will put some but you know when you do more classes that you need to invite a lot of people you know so it is just
SPEAKER_04: We go step by step. So we just started 132 woman category as well. So we go slowly. So what I just think, honestly, you are great. You're going to see me. You're going to be like, how in the fuck did this dude make that weight? I'm telling you, I'm an imposing figure at that weight. I'm big, dude. I'm big. You can fucking see it here.
SPEAKER_03: You ain't got no clue when I put my frame on you, dude. I'll just go straight in with you, because you ain't got but one move, Hunter. You ain't got but one move. I'll beat you at your move. You got one move, buddy, and I'm going to beat you at that move, and then I'm going to expose you in the next two rounds. Three seconds of arm wrestling. Remember he said that. Remember he said that, y'all. It might be 2.8. I might set a record with your ass, 2.8.
SPEAKER_01: Wait until you hear what I say during the match when you say all this. I don't give a shit about none of that, because then we face-to-face, and your shit's going to bounce off the pad like Patrick did. Who are you going to have in your corner? Artem you going to have anybody in your corner, Hunter? Oh, yeah. Who are you rolling with, Doug? Hey, Travis, Travis, Travis, Chet Silver is one of our special guests. Woo!
SPEAKER_00: Man, there's gonna be all kinds of, man, there's gonna be some animosity in that room. Who you got, Justin will be over there giving the tips in your corner? Well, cuz Justin and Paul have a match, Herman's gonna be in my corner. Herman. Who is that, Herman Stevens? Yeah. Herman might be making some memes and stuff. Herman Stevens.
SPEAKER_04: Derek Simit, Herman Stevens, and Joshua Justin Grant, also our special guests. I started West versus West with these guys. And so I also invited them. Okay, there are a few superchats. Shane, the Owens are missing. You got to give Hunter a break on the internet. They just got the internet in his town last year.
SPEAKER_04: And enlarged pronator. This is the shit talk the sport needs. Firm handshake to all of you. Engin, how are you feeling? Thank you, my friend. Thank you. I feel better. And Ryan Bull Ballinger. Doug, how well did that wall hold up when Hurricane Katrina came through?
SPEAKER_03: I mean, I don't live in Louisiana, so, I mean, but I don't know what the hell he's talking about. He's talking about the wall that you talk about when you pull against Hunter, I think. I mean, look, I've felt the pinnacle of the sport, okay? Daniel Prokopchik's arguably the best in the world at that class, okay? Yeah, they've got guys, Mindaugas beat him.
SPEAKER_03: in a war, then he goes and beats Zelayev, and then, you know, Makarov loses to Zelayev, and then, like, everybody's beating everybody. I've felt Daniel Prokopchik. I know where I'm at with him. Me and him have had a lot of discussions about that match. I know what the highest level of this weight class feels like. He doesn't.
SPEAKER_03: He's beating people at your local fair, winning fucking stuffed animals and shit. Like, I don't know what he honestly thinks he's done. You should tell your wife to break out the red panties. I gave you this match. You got this match because of me.
SPEAKER_01: Man, you were supposed to pull me in doggers, and they swapped me with me in doggers. Get the fuck out of here. You ain't no McGregor. You ain't no McGregor. What are you talking about? I set that up. The whole thing was set up. You don't watch no cover covers with your shit towel.
SPEAKER_00: wait until you feel uh let's talk about let's talk about why you why why does this match mean anything to you doug what if you don't think he's that good are you irritated by the media or you're saying that sometimes his name comes out of your name comes out of his mouth what what or is it just because the money is it the getting back on the card why why hunter
SPEAKER_03: Well, it started with not me. My name was getting thrown in. Like, he'd go win a tournament. He'd go do something good and run through some people. He'd post just a picture of himself with a trophy, you know, celebrating or whatever. Nothing wrong. And then somebody else would throw my name in there and be like, oh, no, Doug's the best under 180. You should pull him or, you know, that'd be a good – you know, just throwing my name in every conversation he seemed to post on Facebook. So –
SPEAKER_03: After that, like he'd make a comment and then finally I just one day gave in and made a comment back and then it just snowballed from there. So. Look, I I've got a so it is personal. It's personal. Yeah, I mean, I don't have like. I mean, do you think that you get? Do you think that you get looked at differently for beating him?
SPEAKER_03: I honestly, I don't even care. Like, I don't even care about that. Like I don't, I more so want to shut up his little nut swingers, man. Them dudes, like they have no clue what that level is like, man. I've been on that stage. I know where, I know what it is. That is different. It ain't like pulling some Swedish dude that is better left-handed that got 17th place at WAL. Like this is, this is,
SPEAKER_03: The big leagues, buddy, I promise you, this is something you ain't felt. Oh, you ain't, your buddy's online saying, oh, you know, you ain't gonna, he ain't gonna feel nothing from you that he ain't felt at practice and blah, blah, blah. He's got the, everybody practices with dudes stronger than them. Everybody gets beat and wins at practice. I got him win on Ron Bassett practice. Am I gonna go beat him in a super match right now? No. Like, what does that mean? Like, once you get under the lights, I promise you, it's not gonna feel like you think it's gonna feel.
SPEAKER_03: Styles make matches, man. You like to hit into that same spot every single time. One trick pony. One trick pony. Your style is exactly opposite of what you need to do to beat me. You're too slow, too stiff, too old. You're too brittle, too fragile. Okay. Yeah. And I'm going to show you what Young Buck's about. This ain't all talk. It ain't talking shit. You back it up.
SPEAKER_03: I'll say this. You're making all the rounds. You're going to all the tournaments. You're pulling a lot. You have stated on podcasts that you dedicated your life to this, that you're working your ass off. You better hope this old man don't get off the couch and come beat you. I promise you that because it's going to be really devastating if I beat you.
SPEAKER_00: To you, it will be devastating. It won't be because it won't happen. There's nothing you can do to stop me and what's going to happen. There's absolutely nothing you can do. It's inevitable. I mean, nothing can stop it. Do you have your passport, Hunter? Yeah, I'm ready. What's the deal? Ingan's on the phone right now. Let's just go in the future now. It's August 11th or August 12th.
SPEAKER_00: And you done ran through Doug. You done ran through Doug, boy. Doug is hot. Doug is hot. Look, you know Doug will turn on his boys. Retire. If he beats me, I am done. I'm gone. Look, if you run through Doug a couple times on the hook, I'm going to be careful what I even say because I know Doug don't play that shit, man. He ain't not going to be happy, but let's just say
SPEAKER_00: run through this thing and it's just as advertised like you you nasty nasty boom boom and you got a couple slick comments for the crowd engen is like it's right there again like this is our guy like this is the guy that we are then going to get behind not only from you know a competitive standpoint but financially
SPEAKER_04: this interest of this guy becoming a potential champ. Engen, how many matches does Hunter have to pull before he gets his shot at the title? No, no, I will just say clearly, if Hunter wins this match, for sure his next match is ready. But even if somehow he loses this one, I don't know who's going to win. So if I am saying some wrong word, it's because of
SPEAKER_04: my bad English, but he still has a direct right for 154, even if he loses this match. Do you understand? Of course.
SPEAKER_04: hunter it is if he wins this match it's up to him he wants 150 for 170 but even if he loses this one i'm answering the question for me 170. who's the guy if he runs through doug we need to we need to
SPEAKER_04: We need to think about it because there are like right now I need to go step by step. I can't. Throw him straight to the wolves like you did me. Put him against Daniel Prokopchik. Listen, Daniel Prokopchik was not pulling his category when he pulled against you. I know, but throw him right to it. It was 187, so it wasn't like 170 pound match. So basically he was pulling one category above his own category.
SPEAKER_04: So if I'm going to put someone in his category, I don't think that... By the way, why are you telling me to put someone in this category?
SPEAKER_04: Do you think that he's going to win against you? No, no, no. I'm saying if he beats me, he deserves it. If he beats me, he deserves a shot at somebody like that. No, no. This suggestion to come from you, you to give even such a possibility was very surprising. I was to say this is okay. If I say it's okay, but it should never come from you.
SPEAKER_03: Look, I said this in the beginning. Maybe next year. It ain't happening this year. He's going to get there eventually. He's young. He'll get there. He'll get over this loss. It's going to be a little devastating to him. It's going to hurt his feelings, especially after everything I post after this match. It took you 38 years to get here. It took me five. Get the fuck out of here. I've been here, bro. I've been here. What are you talking about? You think I just got here?
SPEAKER_03: No, West versus West just started. I've been here. I've been traveling the world. I've been all over the world. Your last win is like 87. Chill out, bro. You're about to have a stroke over there. Yeah. How old are you, Hunter? How old are you? 27. 17? You act like he's 17. And ready. Man. And ready for anything. I got to tell you, Hunter, when I was 27, I had a good year, boy. This might be your year. I'm telling you.
SPEAKER_04: It's that tour year, baby. When you were 27, you beat Alex Boivoda in Canada. Oh, I was a bad dude. That's exactly when I was. Yeah, I remember. Yeah. Ingen told me, hey, he's already the winner. I'm like, no. No, no, that's not what I said. That's not what I said. Justin watch the video again. I said, he's already a favorite.
SPEAKER_04: You have nothing to lose. He has a lot to lose. So that is exactly what I said. I didn't say he's already lost. He's trying to talk me out of that shit. That's why I got the fuck away from there immediately. Yeah. Hunter, at the table, you seem very aggressive.
SPEAKER_04: And right now, you look very calm. Your face is very light color, while Douglas is getting so red, so angry right now. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Or it's maybe sunburn, sunburn. I don't know. Yeah, man, I live in Florida. OK, OK, OK. Yeah, so he's very calm right now. And this is not how we are going to see you at the table, right, Hunter?
SPEAKER_01: At the table? No, you're going to stand like this. That's when the real talking gets done. That's when the real action's done. Then I can see the little lips quivering after I slamming this shit bouncing off the pad the first round. And what do you think about him tearing his shirt and then showing you what is inside, you know? Like, what's he trying to do? He can't rip his shirt off right now or less when I get done with him.
SPEAKER_00: Devon't make me. I like this shirt. I like this shirt. Devon't rip the Tiger Woods shirt, man. It looks too nice. I like this one. What's the game plan, Doug? Is there some strategy, set grip, strap, inside, outside, false start, no false start? Where are you at? Is there a place that you can't beat him? And is there a place that he can't beat you?
SPEAKER_03: Well, for one, Angin, can I get two shirts, two jerseys? Because I plan on ripping that one off. No, just one, yeah. Well, then I might not rip it then. Hunter, Hunter, does he think this is a bodybuilding competition or something? Why is he doing this? He thinks that he will be intimidated? I can't. I don't know what he's got going on. The Lucky Adventure level's going to rose up a little bit. Hey, look. Hey, look, man. I still got other stuff outside of arm wrestling I got to look good for. Like, I can't. You know what I mean? This is.
SPEAKER_03: This is, don't mistake the good looks for the power. I promise you the power is still there. But Travis, to answer your question, yeah, I don't, for one, I don't think he could beat me anywhere.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, that's just the honest truth. I don't think he could be me. No, right in the hook. You're telling me that we're watching this guy blow through every human being in a hook. We're getting rumors. I mean, Adam Orzinski's telling me he can't keep his hand from bouncing off the pad. Chad tells me the motherfucker's generational. The only...
SPEAKER_00: Other guy that only time you would say, well, Ted, you don't know what the fuck you're talking about. But the last time he told me that he told me Todd Hutchings was becoming something different. Why in the world would any, this match, this match is going to be hard. It's hard to even book this match. If you're telling me that you can beat this guy in a hook. I'll start in a hook with him. I don't care. He ain't, he look it.
SPEAKER_00: They said the same thing about Adam. And look, this stage is hard, bro. Like he went over there. He's taken two pretty rough L's. I'm just telling you, man, I know Adam lost 3-0, but man. I mean, that guy that he pulled is amazing. But I'm just telling you, man, Adam was.
SPEAKER_03: close close for someone like adam was way closer if i let's say i was i had a six percent chance he had a thirty six percent chance adam adam's a beast adam's a beast i love adam adam's a great dude he's strong as he's he's he's still got a lot he's still got a lot going on but my point is with the whole uh you know if he's that dude and he's generational
SPEAKER_03: then why did he lose to Eli Sadov right hand, his weak arm? Why did he lose to Alexander from that Canadian dude in a hook? Why is he losing to these guys if he's generational? You know what I'm saying? Chad can tell you everything he wants to tell you because that's his boy and he's in his camp and he's his little buddy. But the fact is he's taken L's to some guys recently that I have no issues with.
SPEAKER_03: So you're telling me that you don't have this great, great game plan on staying out in his hand and top rolling and running away from him. That ain't a game plan. I've got a plan A, which is what I feel most comfortable with, like my best move, because I'm going to try that out. I'm going to go there first. I mean, that's what most people do is test out their
SPEAKER_03: their best spot, which he's going to test out his best spot first round, and then the same thing the second round, and the same thing the third round, because he only has one move. So I'm the only one that can make adjustments. He can't. That's all I know. It'll be over before you know it, old man. It's okay. How y'all feel when he calls me old man? Because y'all older than me.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. Uh, yeah, I I've already accepted to know you, you're right at 40. You don't accept it yet. Look, it's hard to accept. It's hard to accept. Yeah. Okay. There is another super shed. Shane, the. All those are missing dog. Douglas gonna stay out during the match. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: I am. That was a good one. Good one, Shane. Yeah, that is very interesting. Usually I have two Eastern Europeans right in front of me and one translator. And then I do my best to provoke them and talk something.
SPEAKER_04: And now probably this is the podcast that I talk to least in my all entire podcast history, you know? So that, that is how it is done, you know, and this is all natural. These guys just incredible. I, I wish that I, I wish that this part of the world, they don't have to do exactly like this big, because I mean, different culture and everything, by the way, um, what do you guys think, but just think well.
SPEAKER_04: when devon is 105 level he's losing some power right he is not the guy that pulling levan right no for sure and another question um you remember like like tatashins versus devon mash on wl it was like i was very close and devon had to you know just do that thing you know and which is
SPEAKER_04: provided at the West versus West. And now when you see Dadikian versus Tata Sinks, and then when you see in the last event Petrenko versus Dadikian, what if Devon goes to 2-31 and pulls Petrenko? Does Petrenko have a chance? I don't know.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, great, great thought. Travis, you go ahead. What a thoughtful answer, Hunter. Fucking genius. No, I'll say it. I mean, since Hunter gave us that deep, profound thought, I think Devon wins the match. Devon't interrupt me now. You already had your two seconds to speak.
SPEAKER_03: uh i think devin wins the match because i think he stops the match and uh petrenko's hand seems unreal right now like he's made some adjustments i guess since that john match i don't know john was pretty john was his first match after some three four years old yeah and then he came like with two three months training and then every event is getting better and and what do you think travis
SPEAKER_00: i i said it the last time i thought we talked is i think that devin's only chance of ever putting one of those belts around his waist again will be he has to go all the way that he did before but not over 253 but he has to be fully running
SPEAKER_00: All the stem cells, all the creatine, he just can't take it to that one extra place where he gets to 280. That 253 mark, if he weighs 231, dude, there's four guys that are ready for his ass. And every time that he weighs the same as Todd Hutchings, it's going to happen to where there's going to be three or four starts in that first five that Todd is in charge of.
SPEAKER_00: And listen, I still think Todd can beat Petrenko, which I know is probably crazy, but I think that Datacon got the tail end of Todd Hutchings' creatine regimen, and Petrenko just got, he just caught Datacon on that same kind of outward thing.
SPEAKER_00: You know, and listen, I am speaking from experience. It is my opinion that guys are not strong 12 months out of the year. And some of the most dangerous guys that you can ever run across is a guy that you book two weeks after he just won the biggest match of his life. Petrenko was amazing in Dubai. This match was immediately after. He was ready, ready.
SPEAKER_00: Todd Hutchings, to me, is back on his ready, ready now. And I don't know for you, Engen, if the belt changing hands frequently is a good thing, but I feel like that 231 class could be a revolving door of, depending on what time of year, when you catch the run, how you navigate taking your time off. That belt in particular,
SPEAKER_04: could be changing hands frequently. I really don't care if it's a good thing, bad thing. Whoever deserves, let him have the belt. But it didn't seem to me that way. The way that Petrenko beat both Ongarbev and Dadikian,
SPEAKER_04: were very dominant. I just remember the way that they were close matches. The top wasn't in danger of losing against Ongarbeev, but to win those matches, those rounds, it was very, very hard. And the way that Petrenko beat Ongarbeev was nothing close to
SPEAKER_04: that match and then the way that it can be practicing in the way that I think of it, that again, to me, it looks like I kind of disagree with you, I kind of think that.
SPEAKER_00: Petrenko is in a different level compared to the other guys. I want to see Todd Hutchings handle Prudnik very easily, which I'm hoping he does, with the shape that I saw Prudnik in. Not that he's in bad shape, but just him expressing to me that he just came off the tour and he's got to get stronger. If Todd Hutchings can run through him, it'd be great to see Petrenko and Hutchings in Lars Vegas.
SPEAKER_04: Give Tata a chance to grab that belt without flying 20 hours. I would love to see it. Petrenko doesn't even have to cut weight to make that class, does he? Who is it, Petrenko? Yeah, he walked in at that weight. No, not at all. Not at all. He just pushes himself maximum 106. And I don't think that Tata is going down to 209 for that belt.
SPEAKER_04: Right now, we have Irakli versus Tautiev. Do you know Tautiev? Tautiev is about, he's almost the same height as Kurdecha, maybe one inch shorter. What country? Russia. And he just won the last AMC event and he's a very tall top roller. So he and Irakli,
SPEAKER_04: On November 2nd, at the West vs. West 15, they are pulling for the world title. And then Tata Sings most likely is going to be pulling the winner of those two. The November event will be incredible as well. I already started working, already seven, eight matches I said it. We will see. We will see. Okay, let's go quickly before I take so much time of this gentleman. What do you guys think about Travis vs. Corey West?
SPEAKER_01: And the winner of this match in Vegas in go to table will be pulling for the best left arm of North Aymeric against Cody Merritt. I think. Left handed. I think Travis walks through Corey. I think he does this. I just think it's too too aggressive and it's it left handed is a lot different than right hand. It seems a lot more comfortable.
SPEAKER_01: So I'm going to go with Travis for the left-handed. Now, him and Cody, that's going to be an interesting match because I feel like that's what it's going to come down to. There's nothing against Corey. I like Corey, but left-handed, I just don't see him stopping Travis. He's going to try to go to strap. I feel like strap favors Travis, his style. And now the Cody and Travis match, that's going to be a little more interesting. I'm ready to see that one. I think that'll be a better match than him and Corey.
SPEAKER_03: And Douglas, I completely disagree with everything this numbskull just said. So first of all, Travis, Travis is going to Travis to win that match with not like not with, I don't, I think with Corey, it's going to be, um,
SPEAKER_03: Corey's strong as shit. And I think he's going to crack his hand, at least keep him flat. It's going to take a lot to finish him. So depending on how strong Travis is right now in finishing the match, because Corey can pull without his wrist. And that joker has a big bench, you know, that he's hard to finish. The other match, I think, is the easier match because he's going to top roll with Travis. And
SPEAKER_03: That's where I think he's going to – there's no way. There's no way. Corey, it's different because Corey will pull without his wrist. But like I said, you try and top roll with Travis, it's going to be a long day for you because he's got more in the setup. Let's go Leonidas versus John Brzee. I think –
SPEAKER_03: John is going to win that match. I think he's going to win. Honestly, I think he's going to win it 3-0. But Leonidas, like, I know he's got a strong hand. His arm is so strong. He's powerful. Like, he might get hurt in this match if John gets him in the right position. If John's shoulder is good. And, you know, that's what I worry about with the way he pulls because Leonidas still pulls a little blocky. You know, it's still a little new. And his arm's so strong.
SPEAKER_03: It's going to be hard to pin him, but John can take his hand. So, I mean, you know, I could, I mean, I hope you don't get injured in this match. I think John is that good. So, with his hand, and I think that's going to be difficult for Leonidas to deal with, because this is not pulling, it's not like pulling a schoolboy. It's a completely different world. Hunter? Yeah, I believe John takes his hand. I think it's going to be a longer match. It's going to be, Leonidas is probably going to be a little sticky.
SPEAKER_01: I do agree with Doug saying that he still pulls like kind of stiff, still that new, that newer type style, just pure strength bodybuilding. But I think John takes a hand and it'll be, I say 3-1 John. Justin, it just, I don't know, if it goes into a hook, Linn Knight may have a chance. I just see John taking his hand and Linn Knight sitting there with his wrist broke back.
SPEAKER_04: Okay, I have a question for you guys. I'm not going to ask Travis so much because Travis and Corey will have their own podcast. And I want to ask you guys, in this podcast, whenever I ask your prediction, do you guys think that you will be saying that a non-North Aymeric will beat a North Aymeric or like
SPEAKER_04: Like, will there be, like, will you guys be able to say that a European will beat a North Aymeric? 100%. 100%? Okay. I can't do that. I'm Aymeric. I cannot do that. I'll give my honest opinion. I'll give my honest opinion about who I think is going to win. Did you guys see the video of Justin? Justin about Devon? Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, let's go. Justin's got that. He's got some Doug in him. He don't play that disrespect shit, man. And sometimes they can get disrespected and you didn't even know you disrespected them. Yeah. So let's go. Let's go. Michael Todd versus Camila Jablonski. Match of the night. Match of the night. Let's go, Michael Todd.
SPEAKER_04: and you know what will happen you remember like last some weeks you know i'm saying that that that desperation will never be allowed and a lot of people say that then why you allow michael michael is pulling like this this is okay then this matters born in a neutral the beginning position match or the losing position then that's a foul so michael the way that michael is pulling
SPEAKER_04: being careful about this this parallel position in winning position it can go down it's no problem and just don't let me explain why because just please learn so i'm not talking about i'm not talking about you guys you know because just a lot of things you know so this is okay this is not okay this is okay so if michael pulls this way don't come and
SPEAKER_04: Engin, did you not say this and this and that? Justin please, you know, guys, please learn, you know, the difference because it's tiring, you know, after many years. So how do you guys see this match? Douglas, Michael versus Kamil. I think Kamil is very, he's quick.
SPEAKER_03: People underestimate how quick Mike is. So his little shoulder roll press that he's got is fast. If he can get in there, I think – I mean, you saw what he did with Lars. And Camille's like a few levels up from that, clearly. But I'm going to say 55-45 Mike.
SPEAKER_03: I think he's going to stop the match. If you've never arm wrestled Michael Todd, you're in for a surprise. For one, he's going to do everything he can to win it. For two, he's tricky as fuck to grip up with and the things he's willing to do to win a match. Hunter? I'm going 3-2 Michael. I think the first...
SPEAKER_01: I think he stops him, you know, in his mood. I think they grinded out the first two, three matches. I think Michael's endurance may be better. I don't really know too much about De Blasio. I've seen him pull a few times. But I'm going 3-2 Michael. Okay. And let's go to Dave Chaffee versus Frank Lamparenghi.
SPEAKER_03: If Dave's back where he was, if his neck's not hurting, if he's got any, if those issues are gone, I mean, Dave is like up there, up there. Like, if Dave is 100% and back to what he was, it's a mismatch, complete mismatch. So given that, if Dave's 80%, it's a tough one. And I still think Dave wins because Frank's strength is his hand. And Dave,
SPEAKER_03: as Travis knows, has a fucking strong hand. If he's there, if he's back where he was, I don't think it's much of a match. Dave has had some trouble lately with guys I felt like he was going to run through. This one's tough. I'm going to say 55-45 Dave. That's not just going for the home team. That's my honest opinion. Hunter? If Dave's healthy, he's 100%.
SPEAKER_01: Man, it's 3-0, very easy. Yeah, even if he's not completely 100%, I still don't see Dave losing this match. I just think Dave... You keep saying everything I say. Justin... You speak what's spoken to you, boy. This fucking dude here. You speak what's spoken to you. Justin keep telling... Justin keep repeating everything I say. Speak what's spoken to you, boy. What's wrong with you, man? Come up with your own thoughts, dude. Hunter, Hunter, you need to punish this guy.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, I am. Hey, he'll come back this time. He'll be crying. He got hurt. This was wrong. This happened. Blah, blah, blah. His name's same old bullshit. Mute this motherfucker. Hunter, what do you think he will be telling you after he tears his t-shirt? He won't be tearing his t-shirt. He'll be going back to his corner holding his arm. He won't have a chance to rip up his t-shirt.
SPEAKER_03: Look at them chicken wings. Okay, let's go. Let's go to the next one. Justin Bishop, Giannis Amolins. I see a lot of people online and I know Giannis has got this massive reputation. Justin's been in and out the last few years as well as I have. But Justin, I know what Justin feels like right now. We're training again this Saturday, but he is, people forget, you know,
SPEAKER_03: He's stronger right now than when he pulled Mendoza. Definitely stronger right now. He trained for about eight weeks for Mendoza. He's been training for a while now for this. He's definitely stronger. I don't care about the weight. He's stronger right now at this weight than he was then. And he went 3-2 with Mendoza in almost every match was decided on the straps besides the last one when Justin was burnt out. And that was a lot to do with stamina. His stamina is way up right now. He's training every week.
SPEAKER_03: I think if Justin gets what he wants, which I believe he will, this could be real quick. This could be quick. Now, Giannis, he'll find a way to stop the match. He's a great technician, but the styles where Giannis likes to hit into this kind of a low hand, straight back, hit into position. Justin's
SPEAKER_03: Posting style is tough for that. That's tough for that move. And I think just honestly believe Justin wins 3-0. Yeah, people say that Douglas got to stop acting tough in the gold T-shirts. Yeah, it is just tough. I promise you. Come see me. Come say hi. I'm just a tough guy. I'm just fake.
SPEAKER_04: on camera and on the guys today it's not working you know he says you're very emotional yeah i am i'm not a tough guy at all wow we know that you gotta tell us yeah you got you yep you're right i i will tell you something douglas you and i we know each other long time so it is easier for me to tease you than teasing hunter hunter hunter is the new guy
SPEAKER_03: understand so don't don't take it you know wrong i i look i i get the i get the game i get the the gab the uh it's all fun banter but um the everything that i'm saying is a fact and it's true so it when i'm messing with him it's for real yeah and hunter
SPEAKER_04: Hunter, I thought that you would be way more aggressive. You are just so cool, so calm, you know, just laughing, chilling, you know. It's interesting, you know. And, okay, let me ask this one to Travis as well. Justin versus Giannis, Travis. Man, this is interesting, man, because I feel sorry for Justin because when I think about Justin's career and the way he handles himself,
SPEAKER_00: i it's like i'm looking in a mirror sometimes when it comes to i think that there's a guy there and justin that is 100 super dedicated if if he is then he can get really good really good however he seems to be distracted at times whether it's his
SPEAKER_00: life, his work, his family, his dedication to just, you know, absolutely loving arm wrestling so much that you just do it all the time. I think he does it when it's time to get busy. So it's going to be interesting. He looks very dedicated.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, so, you know, I just know that it's easy to tell people you're dedicated. It's another thing to be there, 100%. So I am hoping for, as a member of the U.S. team, that he's special. Because if he is special, he can win the match. On the flip side, the dude he's pulling is, man, he's an extraordinary athlete.
SPEAKER_00: When it comes to his intelligence, his fucking knowledge. Yeah. I mean, listen, this is my opinion. When I'm watching the press conference before the main press conference, because there's two of them, there's the first eight matches and the second eight matches. The first eight matches, Coach Ray, Giannis, and Malin are running the press conference. Listen, every time Giannis speaks,
SPEAKER_00: it easy to follow easy to follow and then he once again says it in a different language which makes me think he's a stud i don't even know what he's saying but i'm imagine it's the same thing he just said in english or vice versa so i know that he's gonna be awesome he's gonna be ready he's gonna be great i feel that a dedicated justin is bigger than him
SPEAKER_00: and then can beat him. So I hope that happens because, you know, Justin's a lot like, he's a lot like me in that regard to where, you know, he's got to, you know, he's got to talk to himself twice to get up and get moving. Yeah, guys, it has been one hour and 14 minutes, so I will go fast. So I will ask some matches to some of you and some, I don't want to keep you haunted. Artem Taranenko versus Minda Agost Tarasaitis.
SPEAKER_01: It's 187. It is not Mendoza's category. He is around 170. And Taranenko will probably 187 at the weight. Right arm. Right arm, yes. Right arm. Yeah, Mendoza sweeps him. I hate to say it, but it's the truth. That's the whole thing. I don't know. Arnold looks like he lost a lot of weight all of a sudden. Doesn't look like the same Arnold. And...
SPEAKER_04: I'd like to pull for the home team, but truth be told, I think the Douglas takes it pretty easy. Oh, you think the Douglas is going to win? Yeah, I think he takes the 3-0. Okay. And since this is your category, I mean, around your category, I will also ask the Douglas. What do you think about this match? I feel like...
SPEAKER_03: Artem is going to – he'll make it interesting outside the straps, but it's going to go to the straps. And Mendoza's hand and wrist are crazy. So I would have to give the edge. I think Artem can make it a match. But if he wins, I wouldn't be shocked. But if I'm betting, man, I'd have to put my money on Mendoza because –
SPEAKER_04: He's just that good. You know, he's not losing anybody. I will tell you something. I don't know why. As of now, I think Artem's right arm is better than his left arm. This is what I have been seeing. Before, like a year ago, I would say his left arm was better. But whenever I see his recent tournaments, I kind of think that his right arm... What do you think, Travis?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I think that, I mean, listen, this is just a credit to Mendoza, the fact that he's moving up in that category. But, hey, I think Artem's really right there. And, I mean, listen, Artem was just like, he was just like Adam. Like, dude, he pulled pretty damn good against Tom.
SPEAKER_04: and i know that you can't really see it with the naked eye maybe if you're but i think artem has an opportunity to be too big for for mendagas and that's what i'm hoping this is what i am saying if they were the same weight then i would say mindagas but with the weight difference i think it is a 50 50 i think it's going to be close i think it's going to be close i do yeah yeah and then so let's let's go to the jonathan breda americ predines i will ask this to douglas
SPEAKER_03: Ermic, he's such a good arm wrestler. He's smart. He's done it at every level. We saw what he did to Topey. And I know Topey is not Breda. If Breda and Topey go up against each other, I believe Breda does the same thing to Topey as what he did. But from what my understanding is, Breda is unbelievably strong right now. This is what he told me.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, somebody that trains with him actually told me this. And this person wouldn't lie to me and tell me I'm generational if I'm not. You know what I mean? So he is strong as an ox, man. I think if Airman could get through his hand, it's a match. But if it's arm-on-arm, Breda's going right through him. Okay, let me ask you, Travis.
SPEAKER_00: Let's go, baby. USA. USA. I love it. I love it. I think it's going to be awesome. And listen, Jerry is, you know, the last time you were around, Jerry, let's just be completely honest. Jerry didn't want to come to Istanbul. He knew three weeks before the match that he did not put the work in, that his mindset was not there.
SPEAKER_00: Right? And he tried to get out of that match with Armisen. I'll take that to my grave, whether it's true or not. He took the proper amount of time off. He's going to be awesome when he gets there in Orlando. So who's winning? Gary Catarat. 3-1.
SPEAKER_00: Jerry, Jerry, Jerry. Okay, let's ask you, let's ask you. Hey, hey, hey, listen, Ingen, you know what's going to happen, man, from this card? This is my opinion. The Aymeric are going to dominate, and then everybody's going to make it be like, man, I don't know if I want to come over there, but if you bring them over here, we'll whip that ass. You know what I'm saying? Listen, listen, many times North Aymeric came to Istanbul.
SPEAKER_04: So it is time them to go to North Aymeric and then there will be king of the table. So that, that is how it should be. The only problem is that not every Eastern guy can get visa to North Aymeric. Yeah. So that, that, that we will, we will need to fix it somehow. Okay. I will ask you Hunter, Matt Mask versus Lars. Do you know Lars from Norway with the flop wrist? Yeah. Yeah. Um, I like Matt. I like,
SPEAKER_01: I just think he's going to get turned in. I just don't know if Matt's all going to hold up. Now, if Matt keeps it outside, I think his chances are good. But considering what, you know, I know how strong Brad is. I've seen him and Brad grunting. And it is right-handed, right? Yeah, but Brad is top roller. This one is flop presser. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Like I said, I think he's got a good chance, but I just, I think it's 3-2 the other way. Oh, okay. And let's ask to Craig Tullier, Tom Holland. Douglas, last one match or last two matches? I love Tom. I think he stops any match he is held to deal with, and he can
SPEAKER_03: His arm's long enough to get out there and get it, and he likes the hook. And I think if he can get a – I think Craig wins the first two fast. And then if he can get a stop, maybe it's a match. But I think – I personally believe this one's a mismatch. I think Craig wins. Oh, you mean Craig is going to win? Yeah, I think Craig wins this one pretty easy. Craig's the best under 200 we got here. Ooh, that's a little bold. That's bold. I believe it. That's bold.
SPEAKER_04: Who? Okay, let's go to Travis. Travis, Paul Talbott. The team people got a problem with that. Vrezh Serdekian. Paul Talbott and Vrezh. Man, dude. This one right here, man. Hey, listen. I pulled Vrezh at practice. I can't believe he could ever lose. But listen, when you pull him, I remember those COVID times and you were just
SPEAKER_04: like you lost to elsa story in a super match and around those times you know yeah so but what i'm just trying to say res is incredibly strong the question is if paul gets the control and res is like this still no chance it doesn't matter what the position is or it depends on what the position is no here here listen the the the
SPEAKER_00: The position matters for you inviting Paul to Istanbul. He ain't winning. How he's able, the jams, the leverage advantage, the positions that he's able to get on fresh is what you're going to judge him from. Because he ain't winning. Because I done seen Marcio hanging from his hand. He ain't winning.
SPEAKER_04: Okay. Okay, let's go. Elizabeth versus... And I love Paul Talbott. I love Paul Talbott. I know, I know. No fucking chance. No chance. Elizabeth versus Aleksandra Ozerova. Who are you asking? Travis. Whoever wants to answer, and there will be one more match, and then we're finishing. Go ahead, Doug. Take it over. I mean, I don't have much
SPEAKER_03: information on making fun of hunter add some sort of insight to this make it there's there's a handful of female arm wrestlers i follow as of right now and um i got a lot of information on um a lot of the other ones i don't have as much detail on but if i had to pick one in this i'd pick elizabeth yeah i i i am going to just go with uh
SPEAKER_04: I'm going to go with the girl that I see every day working out like a crazy person. So I will go with Elizabeth as well. Okay. This one, the last one I will ask all of you. Pauline versus Rustam Babaiev. Well, look, look at the name. The name just weighs very heavy. The Rustam Babaiev name, but we have seen Pauline. Pauline is
SPEAKER_04: an example for all Aymeric bowlers. This guy's discipline, this guy's, how to say, the way that he takes the things seriously. He is a professional, not athlete, but person. And you can see how much he progressed from the first time. Yes, he lost Sasha, but the match was very, very close. And he lost Irakli, but the same Irakli
SPEAKER_04: beat Sasho, beat Rustam Bauer, just recently beat Evgeny Prudnik without any competition the last match. So Paul losing against Irakli, I mean, doesn't take much away. And I'm sure he got better what we saw against Lachlan match. So how do you guys see this match? Man, Paul's the hardest worker I know. He's the reason I got back into this.
SPEAKER_03: He not only can motivate other people, he motivates himself. Those losses that he had, we've had so many conversations about him. It motivates him to avenge the losses. And the way his match went with Rusev, he doesn't even in his mind count it as like a win because he wants to prove he can do it three times. I think he learned from his lesson the last time. A lot of advice given to him about trying to get into his hand more.
SPEAKER_03: Instead of just putting his frame on him. And then when he did, we saw what happened. Now, Sasho Poole's a little different. I think, and he's awkward and short and the angle's weird. I think the frames of Rustam and Paul match up so well that this is going to meet in the center and it might steal the show. I'm telling you, this is going to be an absolute banger. Right dead center and
SPEAKER_03: Paul wants it, but you've got to give... Paul's not a top-roller. You're not going to compare it to Rackley, right? I know he 3-2 with Rackley. You know he chose... You know Rustam chose the... Who is 3-2 with Rackley? Rustam. Rustam, yes, yes. Yeah, and... If Paul tries to top-roll Rustam, it's the biggest mistake of his life, as he did last time. So he needs to go where he went, round three.
SPEAKER_03: Lars time, yeah. Yeah. Well, you know, Rustam chose the buckle side against the Rackley. He won the coin flip and chose the buckle, and the buckle decided everything. He didn't even care, you know. He didn't care, and he made a mistake because every round the buckle was on somebody, the guy lost, you know. So who do you think is winning? I'm going to go with Paul Linn, 3-2, and an absolute banger. And Hunter? Listen, Paul Linn is that dude. He is the real deal. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I'm a fan of Paul. I like Paul. But like you say, you still got to give, you know, Rustam, he is, he's that dude too. But I think Paul Linn now is 3-1 Paul Linn. Okay. And Travis? It's only 50-50 if Paul Linn's the greatest he's ever been when he gets there. And then he's got to hope that the travel,
SPEAKER_00: takes him to 51-49. But this will be his greatest accomplishment if he is able to
SPEAKER_00: with the lane that he has no choice but to employ because Ruscon's going to pick the lane. He does it with everybody. And Paul's got to stand up to him. Paul's got to be fucking awesome. Fucking awesome. And it couldn't be a better person if he is able to do this. And yeah, I'm rooting for him. 51-49, Paul Linn.
SPEAKER_04: Let's go, my man. But listen. Did you guys know that I just set a match like an hour ago? Did you guys know that I just set another match about an hour ago for this event? I think I know who. Ryan Ballinger versus Rymons Leopiens. Clean, sweet, Rymons lightens. How much you want to bet on that, Doug? Is it right or left? Who is it? Ray against who? Right or left? Ryan Ballinger. How much you want to bet, Doug?
SPEAKER_03: I'm going to bet on our match, our purse. I want to bet our match purse. I want to bet our whole winning, our whole show money on our match. That's what I want to bet. I don't bet on nobody else. I'm going to bet my money versus your money. And then you pay me his money after I smoke this fool. No, no. You guys get your own money. And then whatever you do is your business. I'm not going to get you all that. Yeah. You want that money? You want that bet? 95 kilo, 95 kilo Travis. Yeah, I want your money, old man. I want your lunch money.
SPEAKER_04: You know both guys, right? No problem. Hold on. Bollinger and Belanger? How do you say it, Hunter? Belanger? Yeah, Belanger. I don't know Mr. Belanger. Is he with Chatham? You know him. He won the finals at the West vs. West finals in Florida. 95 kilos. What are they pulling at? 95? 95?
SPEAKER_00: 95, 209, yeah. And they both accepted. That's big for Ray. That's big for Ray. And you are saying that Ray is going to win? I think Ray is going to win. About a chance. Well, I mean, yeah. I think he stops the match. Well, it always looks good for Doug when Ray wins. I just want to keep winning. Keep winning, big dog. Keep winning.
SPEAKER_04: okay so looks like that's all thank you guys thank you you guys did great job wow that that that is a great example of uh pretty much podcast yeah thank you this is some this is some real there's some underlying problems with these two cats man don't think that way just the beginning okay which one did i miss me and hunter hunter is a hundred percent gonna win
SPEAKER_01: I'm a nobody. I'm old. Let's go. It is what it is. You're too old to smile and brittle. Hey, listen. Nobody's rooting for you, Doug. Did you call me small? Did you call me small? This redneck leprechaun over here talking about I'm small? You're too stiff, too old, too small. Okay. Okay.
SPEAKER_04: Hey, Doug, no one's rooting for you. No one thinks you're going to win except for your kids and Justin Bishop. That's all I need. That's all I need. Hunter, Hunter, what do you think about this last time four weeks and he finally admits that he has no chance and 100% you're going to win? What do you think about this, Hunter? He has to face the fact of reality. That's all it is. I'm glad he's coming to it.
SPEAKER_03: Hunter, do you want me to cancel this match and find you an opponent who trusts himself? I mean, if he don't show up, I look for him to show up. I feel like he's going to get hurt or something's going to happen or his time of the month or somebody from Geritol or something. Look, look. Hey, seriously, though, this is serious. And I mean this. The only way you win this match, Hunter, is if I don't show up. I promise you. You better hope I get a flat tire on the way down there.
SPEAKER_03: How long is the trip for you? How long is the trip for you, Doug? It's like a six-hour drive. I'm sure that the worst case, we can bring you with another car or whatever. Yeah, because we want to make sure Hunter goes back down to his weight class that he should be in. Doug, Doug, I'll come pick you up, whoop your ass, and take you back home. Does that sound good?
SPEAKER_00: Hey, you're going to give me a ride, save me some gas money, and I'll put it all in my pocket. Devon't worry, I'm going to have your lunch money. We already bet that on boss. I'm going to have your lunch money. I didn't want to bring that up, but we might need to talk about what y'all doing, if this is a real bet or not, because one thing about me is I'll make a little shitty bet, but if I don't take on it, that shit don't count. Guys, just make sure that in the competition venue, no betting.
SPEAKER_04: Whatever you do outside, something private, it is your thing. But in the venue or something, there is no batting. Justin do it. Keep everything private. So I just want to organize in a way that, yeah. And what time does the competition begin? 1 p.m. Because whenever we start there, we make sure that North Aymeric can watch. So whenever it starts here, still the same time here, 8 p.m.,
SPEAKER_00: So the Europeans can also, yeah. My son plays at 12. So we'll all be watching the game before it starts. He plays at 12, hour before. Okay, what time it finish? He'll only play like the first half, a quarter. It won't be a big deal. Yeah, we'll be ready. Yeah, it'll be perfect. Okay, okay. Yeah, just also remember the press conference will be early as well.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, no worries. All right, guys. Okay, guys. Thank you. Thank you, Hunter. Thank you, Douglas. Thank you, Travis. Travis, you are incredible, my friend. You are incredible. And I wish you guys the best. See you, gentlemen. Thanks, fellas. Good luck. Appreciate it.
