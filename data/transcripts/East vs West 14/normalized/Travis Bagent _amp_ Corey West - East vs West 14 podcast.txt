SPEAKER_01: Hello, guys. How are you all doing?
SPEAKER_00: It's very hot over here. I don't know how it is, where you all are at. Did you guys see what Prudnik shares? You know, the guy is getting out of control. Somebody came, but yeah. Hello, Corey. What's up, buddy?
SPEAKER_00: How is everything? Good? Good. Busy. Busy, I can see. Busy. You are in the car, yeah? Yeah, I don't have a... Loud noises. We work on cars all day long. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, let me see. Okay. Okay.
SPEAKER_00: okay i think soon travis will join you look like you're feeling better yeah yeah yeah i feel better i i mean better but still i
SPEAKER_00: started training the power is not good but slowly we'll go up i'm tired of started training and then something is happening and then starting from the beginning again and then and then i'm like okay i will never make a comeback you know yeah yeah i think travis very soon will join
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. People says I look good like this. Hmm. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Same as like 25 years ago when I used to live in the U S I had my Cadorette and trans and funny, I guess, same time, you know, you know, and then how I shirt and the sunglasses, you know, what, what did you do here? What was your career?
SPEAKER_00: I was just mainly for arm wrestling. I was there. I was competing all over the US. You know, just compete, of course, working somewhere as well. But and yeah, I was at the beginning, I was doing roofing. Anyway, so Travis just came. Hello, Travis. What's up, fellas? You see, you see Travis? What are you? Motherfucker, you look good. Everything good?
SPEAKER_04: You know, ran into some pot of money or something. What in the world? Yeah, that's how I buy this shirt and the sunglasses. I became so rich. And then finally... You know, it's changed and everything, man. What the hell is going on here? This man... Hey, this is what it looks like when you got money, Corey. This is what the money looks like. I wouldn't know. I'm just sitting in a Camry having to work this 9 to 5, you know? I understand completely.
SPEAKER_04: So what's happening, you know? What's happening? Corey, are you going to kick his ass? Oh, man. Jesus Christ. How lucky is Corey to get this match? It's a champ. Corey, this is all I got for you right here, Corey.
SPEAKER_04: if that don't scare you if that don't scare you then just know that i got uh i got ukraine the other day i got baptized in you in the ukraine so i'm i'm different now boy different but you look you look thicker for sure your trapezius shoulders everything you look you look i mean i am 100 sure you are heavier than the time that you came istanbul
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, a little bit. I'm trying to get to like that 285 pound mark and I'm creeping up there. 276 this morning. So I'm getting there. But, you know, will it help you to, you know, against Corey?
SPEAKER_04: I mean, I don't, I mean, listen, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not worrying about Corey. I got to, I got other things to worry about. And that's being 47 years old and trying my best to be as strong as I can. And I got a kink in my neck right now. You guys can't tell, but that's just from training earlier today. So I'm going to,
SPEAKER_04: I know that if I can get where I need to get, I'll run through Corey and the rest of the dudes that speak well. Well, if English is your first language, I got a pretty good fucking shot left-handed when I get strong, and so I'm getting close. I'm getting close. I mean, plus, this doesn't mean anything to Corey anyway. This only means something to Michael and Rebecca Todd.
SPEAKER_04: I bet you that they, boy, I mean, I bet you they've probably been more concerned about your life ever since you signed up for that match than ever before. Oh, man, you just, you know, it's one of those deals. You don't pass up those opportunities to pull those guys that are on their way out, you know? You got to get them while they're still in. I got you, I got you. Well, I just hope that you're not, don't be all sensitive and shit when we start promoting it, all right?
SPEAKER_04: Devon't be all sensitive because I'm going to talk shit to you, your family, and most importantly, Michael Todd and Rebecca Todd. Keep the family out. Nah, nah. It's US on US. Fuck that. Fuck that. Okay.
SPEAKER_04: I know, listen, I know Corey is half African-Aymeric. If you don't think I'm going to exploit that when I start talking shit, then you don't know what Aymeric is about, Ingen. OK, but what is it to explore such thing, you know, like what's it to explore? I'm just trying to say again, what did he say? I mean, he said that you're...
SPEAKER_00: You said that you're going to talk about this like something important or something. What is special with it? Nobody knows. Nobody knew that he was half African-Aymeric, but I'm exposing it right now. That's what I'm talking about. I'm going to talk about his family, talk about all of them. Corey, you really like- Corey, Corey, now tell the truth, Corey. I don't hold sides, but I wish you the best, Corey.
SPEAKER_04: Crush him, Corey. Crush him. Yeah. How was the training yesterday with Michael? Good? Yeah. It's a lot different. We were kind of talking about that. You know, I used to go over there two or three days a week and we'd do these little 15, 20 minute workouts as hard and fast as we could. And now it's, you know, we still do some of that, but we're there, you know, an hour and a half, two hours. Usually it's a whole different, different program.
SPEAKER_00: So what does Michael think about your chances against Travis? I mean, kind of the same as anybody else. He doesn't see a path unless it was straight to the pad.
SPEAKER_04: I like that pass. That's a good pass. That's a good pass. We all know Travis doesn't want it to come down to horsepower for sure. Well, I mean, listen, you're going to, I mean, I imagine that if you get in this most perfect lane. But, I mean, I don't know. I think that I'll be able to give the illusion that we're pretty close power-wise as soon as I just click that hand back just a little bit. And I just, listen, don't hurt yourself either.
SPEAKER_04: Is your shit good? We'll find out together. No, it's good. I haven't had any pain in a while. I haven't had any pain in a while. I got the stem cells. I've been doing the 157 for a few months. You know, more than anything, like you said, I don't hear a lot of people talk about it, but the stronger I get, my neck impingement does get real crazy. Like, bro, when I get strong, my neck doesn't want to turn very far at all. It's wild.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I'm going to see the chiropractor at 6 o'clock. I'm going to work out this shit tonight. Yeah, this is not cool. Well, I just hope that I don't want you being all mad, man. Devon't get mad like Derek did, man. Man, I can't believe you almost let Derek beat you. That's how I know it's going to be bad. Almost let him beat me? Oh, my God. At what point did I almost lose? I'm trying to figure that out.
SPEAKER_04: Travis is so scared. He's got to start early every time. It's crazy. He's scared of Derek. I was on time. I was on time right there. You better get ready, man. I got a feeling that you have a false sense of what it's going to be like. It's going to be. Cody, should I tell him what we talk? Yeah, for sure. Go ahead. Yeah. After your message.
SPEAKER_04: Kalinichenko, Corey called me and he said, Engin, can you find me someone like more serious, you know? Yeah, well. Yeah, serious opener. He better be careful. Hey, be careful saying something about that man, okay? He has his glasses. See, he has his glasses. Right now he's 20% stronger. I'm just telling you, I've got you craned over there, boy. Hey, listen, let me tell you something. I think it's time for Sergey to get a match.
SPEAKER_00: so it don't look so bad. Who's his next opponent? Devon. There we go. There you go. Once he knocks Devon off, once he knocks Devon off,
SPEAKER_04: Once he locks Navon off, you'll know I'm like third best guy in the whole fucking world. But right now, right now you got to get that man a match, man. Hey, listen, he'll, Corey don't want to see him. That's for God damn sure. I promise you. Man, did you see what he did to the guy who did something to you?
SPEAKER_04: Get the fuck out of here. That shit ain't close. That guy will fuck you up, man. I'm not. Listen, as your friend, as your friend, don't fuck with him. You understand? That guy, that guy is different. Travis. Go ahead. Go ahead. Sorry. You tell me this, Travis. You were there. And this is not an excuse. This is, I was a very naive, naive individual to think that I could pull two people at that level on the same day. Very naive.
SPEAKER_04: That was a mistake. I got you, I got you, I got you, I got you. Yeah, I'm just telling you that I've been around you and I've been around that man and there ain't no, there ain't nothing close about you and him. Did you not see that mask ending like what, twice?
SPEAKER_04: Matt Mask got him in Canada, and after he beat Matt three or four times. But listen, that guy now is a way different guy than that guy. And I'm telling you, I done seen some video of this guy, man. This guy's not normal. This guy's the 250 champ. He's the 250 champ, and he might be top four. Top four unlimited right now, right, Andy? I could be wrong. Artem you telling me that he can meet Ivan Moshenko in Devon?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, but listen, the guy that pulled you is 286.
SPEAKER_04: The category you talk about is 253, so he won't be the same guy. Yeah, listen, because if the guy shows up at 286, he'll run them guys over at 250. Won't be close. So that's why he has a chance. Now, listen, I could be completely wrong. I'm just telling you that I'm not as weak as that video showed. So the only way for me to justify that, and we'll see, listen,
SPEAKER_04: After I get done with your ass on August 10th, on August 11th, I want you to call Corey and ask him if he wants a match with Sergey. And I'll bet you he says, no, sir. Thank you. I'm good. But I promise you, my right hand is far better than my left right hand.
SPEAKER_00: Well, I hope so. I mean, did you see? I couldn't even slip. I couldn't even slip out. Listen, after what just Travis told you, and you to say that your right arm is better than left, it sounded like on 11. Yeah, ass whipping coming. I mean, that really sounded that way, you know? Yeah. He ain't got no confidence when I'm in this motherfucking building.
SPEAKER_04: That's a fact. That's gone. Ain't no more confidence. Why did you feel like you needed to remind us that your right is better than your left? Is Travis going to beat you? It's because of this. Because of these glasses right here, motherfucker. That's why. But he's comparing a Sergei that beat. I mean, Travis is not. Travis, do you think your right is any good right now compared to your left? Yes. Yes. Yes, I do. Yeah, I do.
SPEAKER_04: Now, I will tell you that it's not the same, but I'm telling you by right arm, I mean, I got news for you. If you think that you can pull me on August 10th and I can't slip out, then I'll give you the money Indian gives me. I'm just telling you that that has never happened to me before in the history of my life. I won't be able to do that.
SPEAKER_04: Go ahead. I won't be able to keep you from slipping left-handed because I don't have the same hand left-handed. But I promise you, I can make it where you can't slip right-handed. All right. Well, we're going to find out because right after we get done, we're going right to that side table. And listen, when I get done pulling you right-handed, then you tell me if you want to match with Sergey. And listen, you very well may. And listen, it might be good for me.
SPEAKER_00: to just focus on my left hand, but I still got a mission. And that wasn't a good debut, but it's coming. Corey, you are confusing me. Artem you going to beat this guy left-handed or no? Yes. No. Oh, okay. Okay. No. Okay, so talk about your right hand. Talk about your left hand. The match is left-handed. The governor of Arkansas knows that I'm going to win left-handed, okay? That's a fact. He's talking about Sergei.
SPEAKER_00: right-handed. That's what brought up the right-handed. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Yeah. But I will tell you something, Travis. Like, I really do not believe that after six years of no competing since Moldova, I don't think that you are anywhere near to your best. You were. Like, maximum 80%. I will tell you something. From 80% to 100%,
SPEAKER_00: just a huge difference. You're talking about like 20% is the 25% of the 80%. You understand that 25% is like, incredible. So I really believe that you like your first international match. And I think that yes, that he is incredibly strong. But
SPEAKER_00: Like, in your best, that match wouldn't look like that, you know? Like, you understand? And I think you're going to get better and better. I'm not saying that Serhii cannot be best of you, but that is not you.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I agree. Yeah, and I'm interested too. I'm just telling you that I can't wait to see Sergey pull again against someone that's supposed to be good because I'm telling you. You think Sergey should be in the top 10? Yeah, no doubt. Artem you kidding me? Yes.
SPEAKER_04: yes immediately immediately like like him and like georgie he said something about georgie's name where's where's where's fed cough at in the in the in the i think he's like fixed or something like that and then how about how about the guy that's so impressive that you said
SPEAKER_04: that was only pulling for a few months, and then he beat Sergey 3-2. Yeah, that guy right now, I don't know. You saw his match with Revas, right? Yeah, yeah. Listen, this is my hypothesis. How do you say his name? Georgie Seranov? Desernov. Desernov.
SPEAKER_04: Deserano, yeah, Deserano, yeah. Deserano. I'm saying that the degree in which he got better since him and Sergey pulled, Sergey has gotten better, too, at the same amount. That's what I'm saying. And I could be wrong, but I'm just telling you, I can't wait to see him pull again. And I hope the opponent's ready. We have so many, so many, so many...
SPEAKER_00: match possibilities is incredible especially super heavyweight category has never been this difficult you know like so many so many so many guys and like they all are close to each other next a few events we will see we will have a lot of answers yeah yeah yeah but just just let's see let's see where you are where corey is and then
SPEAKER_04: I'm going to win. I'm going to beat Corey. Then I'm going to beat Cody. And then I'm going to have a real nice little product to bring over there. And I should be bigger and stronger come January, February. And then I feel like I'm going to pull whoever the number one guy is before the end of the year. My friend, unless you don't lose five times in a row.
SPEAKER_04: No, you can't lose. Can't lose left-handed. If I lose left-handed, it's not good. Yeah, yeah, the climb. Can't be no more awesome. Artem you going to beat Corey as easy as you beat Derek? No, he'll be a little more stubborn with his hand back. I just hope Corey don't hurt himself. Because I know he's, you know, he ain't, he ain't, he ain't, he don't exercise severe intelligence in the middle of being out leveraged. He just goes crazy.
SPEAKER_04: and uh you know once i get that hand back you can fight as much as you want but it's all over all you're doing is allowing me to talk more to michael todd you better michael todd's gonna be just as mad as you well you might not be mad cory you might already expect this uh cody i have a question for you i have a question for you like
SPEAKER_00: just say objectively you know if you can but what has changed with michael todd after his surgery did that did anything change or you've changed how much and where what um i don't i mean there's definitely been some change i think uh you know i think adversity does a lot to everybody he definitely trains different like i was saying earlier we do these
SPEAKER_04: train for a couple hours a day when i go there now compared to what we used to do um his rank his range is quite a bit better um yeah you know and i you know i think he's coming to realize now you know really michael's biggest and travis has talked about it several times uh for some reason who's this worst enemy who's this worst enemy
SPEAKER_04: know the answer himself yeah he the way he hits himself past his hand whenever he tries to not be a king's mover was just a problem like that was just putting himself in positions that were you know he couldn't come back from he decided he wasn't he was going to try to be an offensive arm wrestler instead of a defensive arm wrestler and it was not the move i mean by any means
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I got a hypothesis, too. Like, I just think that I don't think Michael Todd needed to change anything physically. He just needs to not be so hard on himself. And when things are going good for Michael Todd,
SPEAKER_04: He can't make them act like they're better than what they are. Because then when you come crashing down either the reality or the failure, you didn't fall from the fifth story like you should have. You're dumb ass put yourself in some unrealistic skyscraper. And now you feel like everyone cares that you're falling. No one cares, bro. All you have to do, Michael, is stay positive through the adversity. Because the matches that he's losing
SPEAKER_04: man you can't you can't he's putting up the best fight ever it's like i've never seen someone be so unrealistic about the good things meaning act like they're better than what they are and then so unbelievably upset about just small bits of failure because to me if you arm wrestle these guys at east first west and it's a 14-minute match by the time it's over
SPEAKER_04: and there's just blood and sweat and tears everywhere like dude you're right there like michael todd is right there with a little bit of positive thinking the dude the dude could easily be i think the 253 or 250 pound champ too yeah and that's right it ain't easy to get a title cody i have a i have a question for you you were gonna pull against tobias
SPEAKER_04: from Sweden, and now the match changed to Travis. Is it easier or harder match for you? I mean, I think the best version of Travis that ever existed, probably harder. I think we're all under the same impression that Travis is not the best version he's ever been. And I think Tobias is very high level. After I offered you this match, you were like, okay, easy money.
SPEAKER_04: I will say this, I will say this. The only thing that was unfortunate about this versus Tobias is there was something, it was gonna feel a little different to pull somebody from overseas here, I think. I was really excited about that feeling. You know what I mean? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But other than that, I'm just still happy to be a part of it. And obviously, like I said earlier,
SPEAKER_04: get a chance to pull john or you get a chance to pull travis or devin like you just don't just don't pass on those because they're you know when will when will it ever happen again i mean it might not ever happen for a lot of people you know it just is what it is i have i have a question for both of you like you guys have been traveling to this side of the world all the time and now they are coming to us like like generally do you
SPEAKER_00: guys think that the athletes who will be pulling in this event like they are taking it like athlete versus athlete or they are taking as the like mostly like west versus is you know now like is it like more like a team spirit generally of course your match is like west versus west match but other than your match do you guys think that there is something to prove as
SPEAKER_04: North Aymeric or everyone is just thinking of their own mesh and then not as a team spirit. Go ahead, Corey. I got a good answer for that. So you don't want to answer after me. So go ahead. Uh, yeah, I think it, I think it carries a lot of weight. Um, you know, I don't know if y'all seen, I'm sure y'all both did, but you know, they had a huge practice out there, uh, for some of the ladder weight guys. Um,
SPEAKER_04: You know, I think everybody's ready to prove something. I think we went over there and not done good several times. And, you know, everybody's anxious to see how they do with 15, 16 hours of travel and, you know, try to sleep whenever they're supposed to be awake and try to be awake when they're supposed to be asleep. And, you know, just feel good to see how they handle that. And you, Travis?
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I think if you ask any one of these guys if they could make sure that they won, but the rest of the team loses, they would be okay with that as long as it ensured their personal win. That's how selfish arm wrestling is. However, I think that we all as Aymeric are hoping that there is a jet lag
SPEAKER_04: situation there, right? Like, when you tell a guy that loses every other match because the buckle's not on his side, he tends to believe the buckle is the problem.
SPEAKER_04: If now we can get those guys over here and we can dominate, well, then we have a little bit more of a open dialogue about the fact that the jet lag and the travel is a pain in the ass. I feel like when I'm traveling, whenever there's any sort of an irritation, if I'm not careful, I can let it kind of balloon into being negative or uncomfortable and let it kind of build on it.
SPEAKER_04: but you know i don't know you know i've also had success overseas so you know it's like that buckle too i beat so many people not knowing that there was a good or bad side of the strap i tend to think there isn't that that's a myth so but i do hope that the americans um i think will be cheering for our fellow americans not only because it's the right thing to do but also to create that myth that
SPEAKER_00: it is a it is there is an advantage to be in the home team sure i will tell you something i will now tell you what i feel whenever you guys come here i don't think that there has been like especially after some events like last five six seven i didn't feel anything about east versus west
SPEAKER_00: Like, it was like, as you see, many of those title matches are between West versus West. And the competition and the, how to say, hands between them is even like, how to say, more than West and West. You understand?
SPEAKER_00: like whenever that he can is pulling petrenko you understand they don't go like so lovely to each other hey we both are from the east and you know hey teammate how are you or something it's just like as as intense as possible that bet kill is pulling artentino that that is there is no difference if
SPEAKER_00: Petrenko is pulling Tatasins or Petrenko is pulling Dadikyan. It's just like everyone is running after their own dreams and they don't really care who the other guy is from, you know. Maybe even at some point they will pull a title match against their own countryman. Maybe the intensity will be a little bit less, but still, trust me, everyone
SPEAKER_00: cares about their own dreams you know um so did you ever feel like like you were like uh how do you call that home and how away you how do you call that when you when you call like this well for me home and away would just be the travel how comfortable am i i understand but whenever you come here nobody makes you feel that way right you feel just like
SPEAKER_04: you are yeah yeah yeah yeah you're correct yeah and i think the biggest reason that i feel that way is because of how personally selfish i am like i really honestly care more about my match than anybody else's match and it's you know so yeah i i i agree with you i think that the uh now
SPEAKER_04: I will tell you this, like, it's not cool to be Aymeric and the Aymeric losing every match and then having people talk about the West being weaker than the West. I would prefer if that was equal. Right. But you're talking about one country and then you call, when you talk about West, you're talking about 20 countries, you know? So trust me, just whenever you go country by country,
SPEAKER_00: U.S. is not doing that bad. You understand? I agree. I agree. Yeah. Justin imagine that 10 U.S. guys are coming. Justin imagine 10 Lithuanians would come. They would have the same experience.
SPEAKER_00: like 10 Kazakhs, you know, would come, they may experience the same, like last matches, Aydar Khan lost, and then Ongarbev lost, Ongarbev lost his last two matches in a row, you know. So what I'm just saying, the level is so high that like, yeah, I mean,
SPEAKER_04: people may be losing, it doesn't matter where they are from. And I could be wrong about this. I could be wrong too, but I feel like because of the promotion being in the same place that you're even, I'm more friendly than ever before with the guys from other countries.
SPEAKER_00: yeah yeah because because like it's like hey i'll see you i'll see you next month and it's you know like the correspondence the friendship the asking questions i mean it's you know like when i see samushia i can see on his face that he's glad to see me and i'm glad to see him but exactly that that is what i wanted us to have you know i wanted us to be super good friends and then fight to the death
SPEAKER_00: at the table and after the that again just sit down and left side pulling you know joke and then hey see you next time you know that that that is that was my intention right right from the beginning yeah well don't expect me and the todds and corey to be hanging out okay because i'm telling you michael and rebecca gonna take this too far
SPEAKER_04: In the middle of this. They are not going to take too far. You are the one who's going to take far. No, no. They will never, ever make anything personal. Well, I'm just telling you, when I see Michael over there rubbing his hand and shit, I ain't going to be able to keep my mouth shut. Listen, I won't be there, as you know. I don't want to see Rebecca's not allowed on the stage, too. Mask sure you put that on there, too. Rebecca's not allowed on the stage.
SPEAKER_04: It's going to be a real win-win for me. I'm going to win the match and then he's going to have to take me to a Bears game because of it. It's all going to work out real good. Hey, we're going to watch the game at 12 o'clock. We play that day. So that'll be on. Hey, Ingen, you're going to put us up early, right? So we can go on and I can announce or no? We will see. Justin give me a little bit more time. You know, the event starts at 1 p.m. Also, the...
SPEAKER_00: um press conference 1 p.m yeah so it's the same time exactly when it is 8 p.m here always the 1 p.m there so it will not change anything for any anywhere you know the same exact time you know yeah i like so i'll talk tell us more you know just i want to just a little bit enjoy you know how are you going to meet this guy just seriously
SPEAKER_04: Artem you asking me or him? No, to him. He's the one who's going to win. Oh, I was getting ready to say, come on. Man, this ain't easy for Corey to try to. He knows that he's in trouble. He knows he's in trouble. He felt it. He felt it in Waxahachie three or four years ago. I was weak as fuck. Had his hand all twisted up. I think I felt something pop. I think something popped in your shoulder that day, if I ain't mistaken. No joke. I'm pretty positive that's where the bicep tear came from.
SPEAKER_04: originally i promise you pull it with my hand this guy's got personal issues man i'm out i don't want that this guy's got a personal problem man and now you're afraid of this oh man i really do gotta get this kink i gotta get this kink out of my neck man damn okay your physiotherapist will help you cody what's your weight
SPEAKER_04: uh 404 this morning 404. yeah you look like is that light or what your face i've weighed up as much as like 450 at king of the table before yeah pretty i don't do any big max single stuff anymore just you know like the best i've done so far and this is like a 405 for 12. um kind of keeping everything is working sets not trying to get all dumb and injured like i have every time before
SPEAKER_00: Okay. Okay. 52, 160, 374, 170, 398, 180. So you are around like 183 kilos. Something like that. Probably. Yeah. Yeah. But, but you have been for 40?
SPEAKER_00: I've been 200 kilos. I was 200 kilos in Dubai. Which is 440, right? 440 pounds. That's where the scale stopped at. Oh, okay. But I have seen your photos. You sent me some of your photos. You lost some unnecessary weight while your muscle, your size is there, you know? Yeah. No, I'm still just as big. Justin less fat.
SPEAKER_00: But his skin looks different. He's on that shit. He's on that growth hormone or the stem cells and creatine. I don't give a fuck what he said. But Travis, Travis. Look at his skin. Look at his skin. His skin looks lighter than yours. Look at yourself. You look like you're sunburned. I'm on all that shit. That's what I'm saying. This motherfucker looks just like you look like you're on something. You done got a job or something.
SPEAKER_00: He's just strong. You look like you're in Hawaii right now, Ingen. Listen, I'm what? You look like you're in Hawaii right now. Yeah, I am. I'm not showing you all those dancing people around, but just, yeah. Yeah, let's talk about some of the matches. Yeah. And let's start. Who's winning, Hunter or Douglas?
SPEAKER_00: You always go first, Corey. You always go first. I got you. I got you. Unless you don't know who the two people are, I'll go first. Listen, listen. One second. One second. Corey, at the table, you will not be that nice to him, right? Like this now. I'm just going to push it down the first. Come on, man. Okay, okay. Because right now, whatever daddy says, that's what happens. Corey, uh-uh, Corey. You should just say, like,
SPEAKER_04: Okay, so who's winning, Hunter or Douglas? Man, Hunter looks tough to beat right now. It's going to take a really good version of Doug. I think Hunter's the favorite. Okay. I mean, listen, I've talked about this before. As an Aymeric citizen, we need Hunter to run Doug over. And then Hunter needs to give right in front of your eyes a chance
SPEAKER_04: enough he needs to show enough be entertaining enough be aggressive enough that you give him a match that puts him on the world stage and continues to where he can somehow fight for that 170 bill that's what i think that we want now i know doug is a ignorant
SPEAKER_04: mean fucking dude. So if he has an opportunity to shut this guy's dreams down, then there ain't a guy more suited that is mean enough and aggressive enough and just hateful enough to ruin this kid's dreams. So I think it's good. That's going to get personal with the ring guys too. That's going to be...
SPEAKER_00: that's a good one that's a good one that that's the only west versus west other than your match yeah yeah so how you got to get us done then right we got to be first and then then it can start after that so let's go with this one by the percentage travis belgium versus corey west
SPEAKER_04: I say 75-25, the beast is, the left arm, I'm gonna be the best in the U.S. by the beginning of this year, and most likely the West-First-West champ by the end of next year. Hey, Travis, there is a guy, he says, Travis loves to hear himself talking, and his name is Cody Merritt right now in the chat. Cody, not just me, Cody, so does Ingen. Ingen likes to hear me talk too.
SPEAKER_00: It depends on what you are talking about. West versus West analyzing, yes. I love it. Yeah, exactly. And Corey, what's the percentage of your winning chance? 95.5. This ignorant motherfucker, boy. Hold up here. Let me make this. Say it again. It's a good thing you're good at it. It's a good thing you're good at commentary.
SPEAKER_04: Anyway, so, okay, let's go. Artem Taranenko versus Mindaugas Tarasaitis. The word I got from the practice was that Artem was the strongest guy there. Craig and Artem. So I think Artem's going to win.
SPEAKER_04: You say that he was the strongest, even stronger than Craig? Well, he said Craig was the strongest, and that he was right there with Craig. And then Justin and the rest of them guys stepped behind. Let's go, Artem. Let's go, Artem. I'm telling you, I said it already. If it was in the same weight category,
SPEAKER_00: No doubt, Mindaugas. But when Artem is a weight category above, anything can happen. And I will not be surprised if Artem beats Mindaugas. Me neither. Corey? Yeah, I mean, obviously, I'd be pulling for Artem, too. I don't know how that's going to play out. What do you think about Mindaugas? Do you know him?
SPEAKER_00: Is it right-handed or left? Yeah, right. Right-handed. But you know Mindaugas, right? You know Mindaugas? I feel like I know the name a lot, but I can't put a face for it. The guy that beat Daniel Prokopchuk for the world title match at the top level. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah, Mindaugas, that'd be tough. Like you said, it'll have to come down to weight. It definitely has to come down to being bigger.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, but he's a good arm wrestler, right? Yeah, super, super good. Yeah, and I've been on these podcasts with him twice, man. The dude's smart. Man, he's smart. Smart, man. Definitely beating him in the first round doesn't mean shit. Okay, let's go to Justin Bishop versus Giannis Amolins. I mean, I'd be pulling for Justin, but Giannis is a tall order.
SPEAKER_04: I haven't seen Justin do anything crazy in a while, so it's hard to say. Giannis is always, always on the level. I think, yeah, I think this is a good matchup for Justin. He knows his opponent. He knows how good he needs to be. And I think once again, I think he's going to be bigger than Giannis too. So let's go. The Bama Bull. Mask it happen. Okay.
SPEAKER_04: okay let's go elizabeth versus uh alexandra this was gonna be a good match a year ago a year ago good match now dude let me tell you something man nobody working as hard two people i think work hard uh camille and elizabeth and paul or or ah
SPEAKER_04: Listen, Paul M might work hard too, but he don't film it. Not like Elizabeth and your boy Camille. Them motherfuckers don't do a rep unless that camera is on. So I'm telling you, man, I think Elizabeth, don't be surprised if she becomes stronger than everyone that she messes with. I don't know when it'll happen, but you can't keep on. I mean, she's putting it in every day.
SPEAKER_04: She was at that Texas event last weekend. She did look big. She looked big. Okay. What's your opinion, Corey? You know the other lady, right? That is schoolboy's brother's wife. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. And it's right-handed as well? Right arm, yeah. Yeah. I think Elizabeth would be tough to beat right-handed. That schoolboy's brother's wife, she's better left-handed, isn't she?
SPEAKER_04: I don't know if she came to here, she trained her right arm better. Yeah. I remember when she was pretty, uh, she was pretty popular three or four years ago. It seemed like she was doing a lot of things and then I just hadn't seen her do anything in a while. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: She's definitely going to be undersized. Elizabeth is going to look really big. Guys, let's go. What is wrong with this Prudnik guy? Did you guys see the thing he shared? No. No, but he's the man. He shared. I won't tell you what he shared. The guy is out of his mind. I don't know. I don't know what it is. He says, he says, soon there will be new...
SPEAKER_00: showdown to the east versus west tozilla i will tear your ball head and i will play football with it rip his head off and play soccer with it if he needed that translated there
SPEAKER_04: Hey, I think Prudnik's in trouble. I don't think Prudnik has enough time to get where he needs to be to beat Todd. I think Todd, hey, Todd is the dude, man. Todd's going to be your 209-pound champion very soon, and I am not surprised that he can't be the 231 champ, too. Justin got to find the right guy.
SPEAKER_04: You think he can beat Petrenko? I do think he can. Not that he can't lose to him, too. But I'm just telling you that the Todd Hutchings that pulled, you know, in that heavy stretch, boom, boom, boom. By the way. And him and Dotacon were close, I think. That wasn't that far off. Oh, I saw, like, panic in Dotacon's side pressure to try to pin him. There was a little panic in there.
SPEAKER_04: Trust me, I saw it just rewinded in slow motion. Yeah, see, go ahead, Scotty. Do y'all think that was a very, I mean, what kind of version of, I mean, you just said his name, shoot. Prudnik. Yeah, do you think that was a very good version of him?
SPEAKER_04: I didn't. At first, I was just thinking Araklay is amazing, but he did tell me that he had been on tour for the last few months, singing and dancing and working. So I can, I'm imagining, there's only, it's one or the other. Either Araklay has leveled up, which that's a pretty easy argument. I mean, he looks amazing. Or Araklay,
SPEAKER_04: Prudnik is not his all-time best, which that could happen. And I'm hoping it's the latter so that Todd does get through this. This will be a good revenge match for Todd. I don't think he has to maybe mix it up with Prudnik for a while after this, maybe never. So this is all setting up to be good for Todd. On the flip side, sometimes when you beat people,
SPEAKER_04: you become, you know, you just get a little mind control over them. So hopefully Prudnik doesn't just have way too much angles, leverage, and just a great path on how to beat Todd. Because I think Todd's going to be, I think Todd's going to be impressive. And listen, Todd's got a terrible, even worse travel. Todd, Todd, Todd was on my plane ride. That means Todd drove six hours to the airport just to take the fucking plane
SPEAKER_04: 10-hour trip. So Todd Hutchings is going to be real happy with being in Florida. Real happy and hydrated and ready to roll. Todd Hutchings is the best asset that we have in arm wrestling in the United States. And it's really not close now. Not close. The only close is John Brzenk because of his name and that status. But don't get it twisted. Todd Hutchings is the fucking dude.
SPEAKER_04: let's go jonathan breda versus america predines yeah only thing that makes me really like prita is because he's been cross-fitting i know and so i know that there's a new level of training that he understands that probably he's been a lazy piece of his whole life and now
SPEAKER_04: He's been exposed to this, and he's looked like he's excelling at CrossFit and getting crazy strong. So I would not be surprised if this is the best Prita ever. I'm not familiar with his opponent enough to know if it's a good matchup or not. But Jonathan Prita, because of CrossFit, is going to be different. Okay.
SPEAKER_04: i talked to him the other day he's actually not doing crossfit anymore he's doing uh power lifting now yeah well i'm just saying i mean when you sacrifice that you realize that you would the training you bend on is weak compared to when you're not in control of that workout and you get there and you find out it's a 45 minute just
SPEAKER_04: dick-dragging, horrible situation, and you just do it. Your brain becomes different, and then when you get back to doing something you love, you know, the intensity and the amount of work gets increased. Corey, Corey, how do you see this match?
SPEAKER_04: Kind of like Travis said, I don't know the opponent good enough. I know Brita's got a really good left, especially in his weight division. He did say he was the strongest he's ever been. He said his cardio was the best it's ever been. So, you know, I'd expect him to do good things. Yeah. And Rymond versus Ryan, I don't know how you pronounce the name, Ballinger? Ballinger or Ballinger? Ryan Bull...
SPEAKER_00: How did Ryan get this matching? He won the qualification. He won the qualification. Oh, okay. So when you talked to Adam, did you talk to Adam or Chad or anybody to find out where you thought the club was? No, no, no. I didn't even know that he was from Carolina because he won the finals in Florida. And then, so we had to give him a match. And then I thought that it would be good if he versus Raimonds.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah. Well, I'm just telling you, those guys are working hard in South Carolina, so this guy's getting looked apart. There ain't no doubt about it when he gets there. Yeah, so he was at that 12-man round robin that Touye and Sharkovich and all them were at in Arkona that I was out at. The dude just kept winning. I don't know where he ended up in that bracket, but he definitely won a lot more matches than he lost and just kept looking impressive. I mean...
SPEAKER_00: I think, I mean, it's going to be a good one. But these guys from Chad Silver's place, do you remember? What was the guy's name? Corey Freed? Say his name? Freed Corey? Freed Corey? What was the? Yeah, the black guy, right? Yeah, that guy. And what was the other guy's name? Matt Harris? Matt Harris.
SPEAKER_00: Yes, chest silvers, you know, you remember about 25 years ago, they had all those red shorts as far as I remember.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, they also had a very strong team. And then you had the team Louisiana with Linn Lucas and Craig Tullier, Robert Dredden, you know, all those guys. I love those. I love those. And listen, when I talk about that tension in the South, that's where it started. And it hasn't changed, right? Like, it's just added. You added Doug Erlich to the mix in Florida. You added and then we added, you know,
SPEAKER_04: Todd Hutchings ended up making Chad's group so powerful. It was just crazy. And now with Hunter, I mean, listen, and Chad told me Hunter's the best out of all of them. Generational. So I'm looking forward to and listen, I like Doug and I understand that Doug's rough around the edges, but I still like, I know that Doug would love to ruin it, but
SPEAKER_04: Hunter might be a valuable commodity when it comes to West versus West promotions. Listen, man, just imagine Hunter grabbing a hold of one of those Daniel or one of them and just crushing them sideways. I mean, if he did that, I mean, come on, man. They'd be dancing in the streets down here in the U.S., man.
SPEAKER_04: That would be huge. Expecting a guy under 170? Come on. I don't even know if we've ever had a guy, except for Cobra, right? There was many of them. There was Jerry James, there was Cobra, Dave Paxton. But I'm talking about life.
SPEAKER_04: I mean, Jerry and Dave love them to death. The era didn't allow us to fully see them against international competition. Cobra was nasty, man. Cobra. Cobra was the nastiest of nasty when I started in 2000, 98, 99. So, so good. No, no. Still lucky. Evgeny early years, maybe 99 was incredible when he went to Russia. Incredible. Yeah. I have a question.
SPEAKER_00: Like, do you see someone like Mindaugas or Daniel beating Cobra? West of Cobra? I mean, Daniel would have a better chance than Mindaugas, I would imagine. Yeah, because I mean, I mean, now the same problem in the whole, but Daniel, maybe we
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, yeah, yeah. And listen, and we also too need to, we need to be careful, right? Because the older we get, the more we fail to acknowledge that the new guys are way stronger. So, you know, Daniel, I mean, come on, man. And listen, imagine how dangerous Daniel is in the tournament. Like, I think Daniel's a really nice guy in the supermatch.
SPEAKER_00: Did you know that until last year, Daniel with right arm never won right arm world title? Yeah, well, I mean, that doesn't surprise me because when that, I mean, there's nine guys that are just absolute killers. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, killers. Anyway, so let's go to the next one. Tom Holland versus Craig Tudor. And whenever I take Tom Holland, everyone goes, oh, you bring in Spider-Man?
SPEAKER_00: I know who Tom Holland is. I like him. I like the length. I like everything about it. I just, you know, I'm going to take Artem's word for it that Craig is ready. So I like Craig. Craig over Holland. Craig is like pure legend. You know, can you imagine this guy has been playing for 30 years and he is at his 50 and still is incredible.
SPEAKER_04: and and never and it's kind of pulling out of his weight class like if craig i believe that craig could be really nasty at 170 but for some reason this guy just refuses to be caught yeah he used to be 143 for many years
SPEAKER_04: Yeah. When I was there, that was it. 143, him, and even, I mean, I was there when RJ joined, when RJ got better than them at that light class, and it was awesome, like, watching those guys. Yeah. I had a final match with him in Virginia.
SPEAKER_00: 143s, yeah. Which also, too, listen, that was awesome for RJ. RJ working himself through there, getting second to you, just like with Jason Reamer. No, no, no. This is 2003. I'm talking about with Craig. In 2000, Virginia, I and Craig did the final. I and RJ did final in 2003, Ottawa, when you beat Alex Voivoda. Yeah, yeah. How do you see this match, Corey? Craig versus, do you know Tom Holland's?
SPEAKER_04: I do, yeah, I've been around some. And they're pulling it the same weight. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, Craig's going to be tough to beat. Craig just so strong, so fast. If he can keep his elbow down, I don't even think it's close. Hmm, okay. Okay, let's go to Matt Mask versus Lars.
SPEAKER_04: I like Matt Mask. I like Matt. I like Matt. I like Matt. So I know Matt's going to get some hand position. He's going to have to worry about that broke arm, hold on, side pressure, press. But Lars is sloppy with it. So I think Matt can get out, stay out. I think Matt's going to put on the show. I think he's eager to prove that he's got more horsepower than he showed against Brad. And that just wasn't a good day for him. And
SPEAKER_04: You know, I think he will be different. I think he'll be a little chubbier. You know what I mean? He looked real light in the ass down there at the Challenger Series. So I'm going to go Matt Mask. And you, Corey? I think it could go either way. I think if Lars can get to a press position, he'll press Matt based on Matt not having a bunch of bicep. But I think if Matt's real explosive and knocks Lars out past his shoulder on go and
SPEAKER_04: you know, puts him in a bad position, then it'll be Matt. Speaking of what you just said there, Travis, I mean, what is the story on Grundy? He is, I mean, he beat Matt, he beat Pablo, but you still just don't see him compete at a lot of
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, he's this new age guy, man. He's getting good and he's waiting on the opportunity. So the truth is he's going to take matches, but he's looking for them to come from Ingen and the king of the table. And listen, I don't know how good he is either. He's pretty good. He will have match after the seven for sure. I mean, he will have all four at least, and then it is up to him to accept or not. Yeah, I don't know his level.
SPEAKER_00: No, no, his level is very, very good. I think he's dangerous for anyone because he's pulling with very little mistakes. You understand? So he's strong, he's smart, and then his hand control, everything is so good. You really need to be much stronger than him and overpower him, you know, to beat him. If you start just playing with him, the games, most likely you will lose that technical game, you know.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, you need to be very, very strong to beat him. That is my opinion about him. Okay, let's go to Frank Lampirelli, Dave Chaffee. Go ahead, Corey. Man, I desperately hope we get to see a good Dave Chaffee. You know, it just feels like it's been a minute. I mean, probably since he beat Vitale, it just doesn't seem like...
SPEAKER_04: It just doesn't seem like he's been able to find himself. Dude, him beating Vitaly, him beating Vitaly right now, hearing that, is amazing. Because of the Vitaly that I saw three weeks ago, a month ago, whatever the fuck it was, that guy is awesome. So, you know, that's amazing that Dave...
SPEAKER_00: that Dave was able to do that. But I hope I'm with you. Ain't no more, you know, Dave done took too many ass whoopings. Everybody's rooting for him. Everybody. Okay. Travis, do you know, like, you are, like, you know this guy's name, Shaw Sonnen? Yeah, Michael. I know Michael. Yeah, you are...
SPEAKER_00: you remind me him i got it i'm a little cooler than him but i appreciate that you are you are you are more successful you have better career i think he has some title matches but i'm not sure i don't think he has ever been the really best but you have been but you have better career enormously
SPEAKER_00: But the way that he is, how do you call that? Like he likes to do analyzes and everything. I think you are the arm wrestling version of, or he's the arm wrestling version of, sorry. Justin remember when you hit it big, just remember when you hit it big, I'll be the ESPN guy. Everyone needs you. Nobody gives you favor, my friend. You deserve it. Corey might not like this shit.
SPEAKER_00: Listen, I'm talking about, as a commentator, okay, Corey has no competition. He never mentioned it in white meat for commentating, not Travis or something. What Corey will do, just go there and kick your ass at the table. That's all. Right, Corey? Look at my eyes. Do I look like I take a lot of ass whoopings? No. That's the answer. Some conversations. Do you think there's any chance he'll come out to
SPEAKER_00: So the Orlando event? Who? Joe. Oh, I wish he would, but I don't know. I don't know. He was very interested until Devon versus Devon match, but after that, we didn't hear anything. Yeah. But just, Corey, don't you think that it is very interesting that Travis feels like he needs to hide the sunglasses of Serhii? No. To intimidate you? That's a good question.
SPEAKER_04: Whatever Sergei, whatever my daddy Sergei does, I do. Okay, let's go. Let's go, let's go, let's go. Rustam, Baba, and Pauline. Go ahead, Corey. Let us hear it. Let's hear it. I think Paul's better than he was last time. I think he knows the lane he has to take now. I think it's his to win.
SPEAKER_04: I think Paul has to be bigger, stronger, faster, more awesome than he's ever been, and he can still lose. This shit is a tough battle. I mean, I'm sure even up 2-0, Rustam probably thinks he's better than Paul. I mean, and it's probably hard to argue that. And you listen, maybe Paul figured something out that match three, and he was going to win, maybe. But I'm sure Rustam, instead of having a torn bicep or whatever,
SPEAKER_04: He would have much rather go to round four and five to see if Paul would get the same connection. So listen, everybody is rooting for Paul Linn if you know him. You understand that the kind of person he is, you want him to be successful. He has an extremely uphill battle in order to win this. So 51-49, that's only because we're in the United States and Paul Linn is an outstanding human being.
SPEAKER_04: What's the weight gap? 209. 209. 95 kilos, yeah. Which Paul, I mean, what was Paul at the king of the table? He wasn't 209. No, no, he was 231 category. Yeah, I got you. So that may play a little bit, but Paul's such an athlete, I don't... He'll make 209 first time he steps on, and he'll be 217 when they bang.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Somebody is asking why I will not be in Florida. My friend, the visa procedure is a long thing. And then last one month I had been in the hospital surgery, you know, emergency room ambulance. But so I really couldn't have chance to run after this kind of things. But my own son will be there since he is also a European Union citizen.
SPEAKER_00: And he will be, yeah, there, Emir. Anyway, so let's go to the next one. Paul Talbott versus Raj Serdekian. I think Travis doesn't believe he's countryman because I heard from him a few times, Bakori.
SPEAKER_04: You agree? You think Varej is very strong? Varej is very strong. I've pulled Varej. I've never pulled Paul. I've seen him do some impressive things. It would be super hard to bet against Varej in his weight category left hand. In this, I mean, against anybody in the country. Yeah. Yeah, well, listen, Paul Talbott, my man, if you pull this shit off, if Paul Talbott pulls this off,
SPEAKER_04: then hats off to that man. That will be extremely, ridiculously impressive if he is able to beat that. Is it true that if Paul Talbott wins this, with your paycheck from this event, you're going to make a statue of him? Yeah. I mean, listen, we all should. We all should. I mean, listen.
SPEAKER_04: We all should. This is awesome. I mean, I will be rooting really hard for Paul, but I do not see any, I don't see, I don't see any way, including busting that dude's hand back. I don't think that a guy that weighs as much as him that resides and speaks English can pin this cap. I just don't believe it. I think you have to have, you have to have that,
SPEAKER_04: that, uh, bet Kelly type of ignorant and listen, they, we saw that match. I mean, and that, and listen, only Janis is a, is a killer and breast is as good as him. I think if the weight is down, you know, so yeah. Good luck. Only problem was that bad kid. It was bad kid. He is about 63 and he was making one 55. I think that the category that bad Kelly now.
SPEAKER_04: 209, you know, is more of his category. I think he can even make 231 with that height, you know. But were you surprised when Beth Kiele beat Artem Taino? Were you surprised? Not surprised, but just like, I mean, I was more impressed with Artem trying to put up a fight there in round three and four. Because it looked, you know, your boy...
SPEAKER_04: Your boy, listen, that Kelly is a killer. Like he's not, he's like, uh, he's like Dada Khan. Like he's not there to play fun games. Like this man, if something happens to you, it's something happens to you. They don't care. They're running through. What do you, what do you, what do you think? What do you think about Oleg, Oleg Zok versus that Kelly?
SPEAKER_00: world title match. Yeah, I mean, we saw that, right? We saw that match a year and a half ago. Oleg beat, beat, beat, beat Betkili. Long match, you know, but I don't know what will happen next time. Oleg is already 187 world champion right now and Betkili is 209. I'm just thinking maybe
SPEAKER_00: there would be a good one. I think Beth Kiley versus Alijan Muradov. No, no. Alijan is just too much. You know, Alijan and Beth Kiley pull. We need Alijan and Matyshenko. That's the one. Yeah, you're right. All right. It's coming. Yes, sir. Okay, let's go. Let's go, Corey. Kamil Jablonski versus Michael Todd. First of all, will you be objective when you are answering?
SPEAKER_00: A hundred percent, I'm sure. But I mean, I think, I think Camille showed that he was susceptible to being beat to the punch right-handed. You know, he, what was the guy that just beat, was it Matyshenko? Yeah, but the way where he went, just Matyshenko's wrist is incredible. It turns you this way. So you can't really, you need to be like this. You need to have your pronator to do the shoulder pressure.
SPEAKER_00: Whenever the match started, somebody isolates your pronator and you turn that way, like it's very hard to do that. And Matushenko, maybe you saw his match with Artem Morozov as well. So you can understand how seriously good Matushenko is. I guess my thought process on it is that kind of like the Lars match, if he can turn in and push him outside of his shoulder before Camille turns in and pushes him outside of his shoulder,
SPEAKER_00: It's going to be tough for Camille. It's going to be shoulder press versus shoulder press match, you think? Camille claims that he's not going to shoulder press him, but I guess we'll see. I don't know. The last thing you would want to do is try to top roll Michael Todd, especially if you haven't really top rolled anyone else at that level. But who knows? Maybe we don't know something. Maybe Kamen is going to teach us something that we never knew.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I definitely think it's harder. I mean, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe Camille's faster than I realized, but I think it's going to be hard to out-ready go Michael into a shoulder press. Okay, and what do you think?
SPEAKER_04: Listen, this is another good one, man. I think that there's no way that either one of these guys has enough skill level to control the other person. They're both going to get to do a bunch of wild stuff, and Camille scares me because he just keeps getting bigger when I'm looking at these videos. He looks awesome, but whenever I know it's going to be a war, I'm going with Michael Todd every time. Okay, okay.
SPEAKER_00: You mean, you mean,
SPEAKER_04: michael is like this and then coming is like this and then the match stopped and then you are saying that yeah and then i think the next match it could be michael todd gets in there first so i don't think either one of them is capable of stopping the other one from doing some different stuff um and just come the only reason camille has a chance he just looks huge he looks big um i think around 10 kilo heavier than
SPEAKER_00: the time that he pulled Matushenko. And you know, with Raikkonen, he beat also, I think, Dave Chappie, I think. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, no, listen, it's on. This is going to be good. I just like Michael after the thing goes more than 10 minutes. And I'm talking about 10 minutes of pulling through the whole eight starts, nine starts. I mean, it's going to be a lot of elbows, a lot of shoulders almost touching hands, a lot of complaining. Because one thing about Camille, too, man, he's relentless. Like, you know, when you talk about –
SPEAKER_04: Some people will press you. Other guys will give you everything to make sure there's no other way to pull except to press. I saw Camille against Tobias. What do we call it?
SPEAKER_04: uh yeah i think tobias yeah but yeah tobias and i mean speaking people says tabia yeah there were situations where i mean the start he's already and he's been in his own wrist back and setting the palms if he's gonna if he does that against michael michael will have no choice there was a mistake there was a mistake i also corrected athletes cannot start the risk this
SPEAKER_04: or this way it needs to be but here's what i know i know that if i have the ability to do this then i can just straighten it up knowing that it's cleared it's clear to to go in that direction i just think that he's gonna press michael's gonna be up up you know almost in the king's move but not really because mike's done learned to set that back shoulder up and
SPEAKER_04: That's not the best place for Michael to be. And it's going to take Michael a while to end up working his stuff around to press. And, you know, that's just one of the versions, right? That's just the version that he doesn't absolutely control Michael so far up top in the straps that Michael is the one that has to drop and fall.
SPEAKER_04: That match is going to go a lot. They're going to do a lot of pulling in a lot of different ways. And I think Michael Todd's going to come off, and it's going to be the match of the day. And Corey, your final thought is Michael is going to win 100%? Yeah, I mean, I don't see, like, I just don't see a lane. I've seen...
SPEAKER_04: Obviously, I think that Camille's left hand is a little bit better than his right hand. You don't really see him pressing those crazy numbers with the right hand. And I've seen him get tied up at the bottom with some guys that weren't, you know, super great at tying people up at the bottom. So, you know, the fact that, you know, like Myrthala, you know, was able to hold him on his bicep at the bottom. I mean, that's a bad sign.
SPEAKER_00: Hmm, I understand. Yeah. So let's go Leonidas versus John Brzee.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, my brain tells me that John's probably in a lot of trouble because of just how big and absolutely, you know, and the guy's unorthodox too. And when you do it a little bit weird, it almost is scarier because you're expecting someone to be in that right lane, the lane you would be in for them to respond the way that you would respond if you felt leverage problems. Leonidas seems to me like he's,
SPEAKER_04: He's just too dumb and inexperienced to know he's not doing it the most efficient way. And unbelievably, it makes it even more dangerous. And I just think he's going to be so big and so strong. So my brain tells me Leonidas is going to win pretty easy. But my heart, my heart will be pulling for the GOAT.
SPEAKER_04: And I will do anything short of shooting Lenitis with a .22 to do anything in my power to help the great John Brzenk. But this is going to be a tough one, mostly because of how big and strong and motivated this strong guy, this powerlifting bodybuilder is. And Corey? Yeah, I mean, I agree with a lot of that. I think it's a big order.
SPEAKER_04: I don't know, and maybe Travis knows better than me, I don't know how super great Leonidas' hand is. I'm hopeful that, you know, maybe John can get his hand compromised in some kind of way where it negates most of the power. I think John's got a fair chance. I definitely don't. I wouldn't bet on it either way, probably, though. Okay. Jerry Cadorette versus Alex Kurdecha.
SPEAKER_04: Corey almost beat Alex, so fuck, Jerry's going to kill him. Because we know Corey can't slow the cataract down. Ouch. I think it's going to be an interesting match. I think it could end up looking a lot like the Georgie match where Alex has dropped pretty low with his hand rotated
SPEAKER_04: has Jerry completely busted back and maybe just can't get past that wedge that Jerry creates with his shoulder. So, Travis, you are saying, honestly, Jerry is going to beat Alex? Yeah, yeah, I think Jerry is going to be. Yeah, listen, you got to be careful when Jerry takes a lot of time off. When he comes back, man, he's ready to roll.
SPEAKER_04: And he had a bad showing the last time against Gasparini. And this will be different. And listen, Jerry will benefit from just running down to Orlando. Because Jerry's a big old, he does not do well in those 10, 11-hour flights. Another thing, like for some people, they like to be at home, hundreds of people sporting.
SPEAKER_00: And some people find this like too much pressure. How do you think that generally Team West will be affected by being at home, hundreds of people supporting them? Do you think it will be in their favor?
SPEAKER_04: How would you feel, Travis? I know how. The problem with me is I'm going to be rooted against really hard at this event. But normally, I do believe that the Aymeric, you know, you just got to dig. The competition is so tough that you need to dig. And the easiest way to dig is when you feel that other people believe in you. So, yeah, I think it'll help. Okay. Okay.
SPEAKER_04: so yeah that's all so we can finish thank you very much for your time story and thank you uh travis you tell rebecca and michael to watch their mouth in that corner with you because any disrespect i hear from rebecca i'm acting like it's your girl you you don't you remember that i don't even want to see michael and rebecca up in that corner i don't even want to see him
SPEAKER_04: Oh, man. Mask sure you get another corner. Listen, you bring them out to your corner, and then I'm going to take it as a sign of disrespect. Justin remember that. Okay, now we understand he's joking. Okay, that's good. You handle it however you choose. And Ingen, if he's got them out there, Ingen, it is what it is. I can't guarantee I ain't going to say no. Listen, what they will do is just sport Korea. It's not even your business.
SPEAKER_00: I don't want to see it. I don't want to see it. I don't want to see it over. Corey, just, I mean, tell Rebecca and Michael to be at your corner and support you as much as possible. You know, this guy, don't worry. We can just ban him, you know, from the event. No problem. All right, Corey. Well, listen, my man.
SPEAKER_04: I'll see you at your funeral on August 10th. Watch yourself when you get around because we ain't never been in competition together. So don't be all friendly and shit when you see me. You just bring your announcing clothes. You'll need them pretty quick. Devon't worry. All right, Engin. You need anything else, boss? Take care, guys. Take care. You need anything else, boss?
SPEAKER_00: There is no boss, brother. You're the boss. You know you're the boss. No, I'm not. Nobody's boss. Take care, guys.
