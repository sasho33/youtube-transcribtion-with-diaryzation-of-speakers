SPEAKER_00: and two hours later from now Levan will be my guest but for now we will talk with our new champion new champion Oleg Petrenko hello hello everyone Levan podcast will be
SPEAKER_00: Like 23. Okay, guys. I don't know what is wrong, but I hardly see. Hello, Adnan. Hello, Atlantis. Hello, Rob. Hello, Aqib, clerks, Sean.
SPEAKER_00: Hello, Hamad. Aleykum salam. Hello, Paul Strang. Yes. Oleg is very strong. You're right. Ian Kloak. Hello, my friend. Thank you. Michael Workspace. Hello, hello to Texas. Drunk Eddie. Hello, my friends. Darren Lehman. We talked about Venice versus Washington.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah. But you know, it's good that we do remember these champions and then bring them to your attention. I don't know who came. Okay, Paolo is here. Yeah, I'm here. Ivan Kozich, hello. Hello, Levani. How are you? How are you? What are you doing? You're breaking all the records all the time.
SPEAKER_02: that coronation lift, rising lift, what's happening? Yeah, now I'm back training and I guess I got excited about that, you know, I still can. And I like lifting, I like arm wrestling lifting.
SPEAKER_00: And I decided, you know, to give new motivation to top guys. Yeah, you do. I'm like, wow. And whenever you do, I realize that your angle, like many of them, when they do, they are like this. Lately, I see you keeping that. For me, I'm telling you, whatever you do, you need to keep that angle at 90 degree or a little bit, but not more than that.
SPEAKER_00: like i you need to be an angle that whatever you do you need to have that angle to apply pressure but you do this and your arm is like this i mean you are vulnerable to this way you cannot apply pressure to that way you know it is my way unless you're training for desperate move yeah
SPEAKER_00: and so yeah the way that you are doing is good but i don't train that way i don't train that way for me you know no disrespect if i would find it the best way that i would do it but i don't judge anyone i don't say it's bad or something i'm not i'm not training this way too this is the only way uh the devon set up the plank of the strings uh where we can measure it on with this uh
SPEAKER_00: exercise he's doing i don't train this way i trained with similar exercises but different different yes yeah whatever i do i i usually do this way make a field here you'll be told that it will it will really because whenever you don't do this this yes a little bit pronation but mostly
SPEAKER_00: yeah yeah yeah so but but i also do brachioradialis training but if i am doing pronation i make sure that there is some heel that also i coordinate with this holding something and at the same time doing together because arm wrestling is not this you need to control here and at the same time you need to yeah so
SPEAKER_02: I do my pronation on the block where my cable is pulling away from me. Yeah, yeah, it's painting, it's painting.
SPEAKER_00: Like I see in pronation, the way that you are saying it this way, see that is like a training against someone who is going like a pressure over at same time. The one that I show, I do that one too, what you show. But the one that I show when somebody is just doing wrist, just wrist, because the pressure is to here, not there. But some people just hold and then they...
SPEAKER_00: Press like, you know, they have all social and then they. Put pressure pressure. Yeah, together. So the 1 that you are showing yes, that that is.
SPEAKER_00: together pronation and then pressure. The one that I show you, if somebody's doing this to you, only the wrist. So that is why it's coming to that way. So I have like six, seven different pronation trainings. That is all like a pronation against a top roller, pronation against someone who do wrist pronation, who is going the sideways as usual. Pronation is somebody just coming forward with tricep pressing because the pronation training
SPEAKER_02: that the feeling or the pronation is totally different in different cases or pulling styles, you know. Always. Yeah. Yeah. You're right, Engin. Absolutely. Yeah. So yeah, that's, you know, but that, that exercise, Devon tried to unify something where we can
SPEAKER_02: where we can measure our strengths in something. Yeah, you're right. That's why I'm doing that and posting on my social media to see if anybody else can beat or match or whatever. I will tell you something. Whenever I put that heel and then hold it, you will not believe, but if I just do only the brachioradialis, just I put the hanging the weight here,
SPEAKER_00: when i do together with the uh pronator the the hill one i do heavier than this yes me too yeah it looks like not possible but i think whenever we do the brachioradialis we are only using brachioradialis maybe a little bit bicep
SPEAKER_00: But whenever you do the pronation, you still have the brachioradialis, but some other, you know, the pronator teres is attached. One is to do here to radius. The other one is going to the ulna. And then the other end is going to the humerus. So this muscle is actually, yes, yes, look at the end of the pronator teres. The one is going here.
SPEAKER_00: On the ulna, the other one is going over and then it's attached to the humerus, while the other edge is going to the radius. So we have three bones. And then it is attached to all three bones. The pronated terrace is very, very important. That's why it's easier, because it's doing partial...
SPEAKER_00: partial job for your brachioradialis. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Taking a little bit more from brachioradialis when you're doing over this. Basically, you are using pronator brachii, but you need a very strong pronator teres to do this. Well, because you may try to lift if it is turning, then it's failed, you know, no matter how much your hammer can do if your forearm is
SPEAKER_00: So if your pronated is strong, it's possible to do it more than your hammer. That's what I'm doing. Yeah, that's what I'm doing. I'm probably 15 pounds more when I'm doing this over the thumb. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, everything will be good. So when are you going to Holland?
SPEAKER_02: I'm going to Holland on August 1st until August 10th and I fly back on August 10th and I checked the timing. I thought maybe I will come back to Orlando. It's a little too late. I cannot make it. You go to Holland just to stay in Holland or you also go to Ukraine? No, I go to Holland only. Okay. You look huge, man. You look huge. I don't understand how you had surgery when your left arm looks huge.
SPEAKER_02: your shoulder, your everything. It's actually a little bit smaller than before surgery, but I did not lose much size. I thought I'm going to lose much, much more, but I've been basically working out since like second day after surgery. I've been doing some, you know, very easy blood flow exercises like second day after surgery. So that's why... How is Tal doing?
SPEAKER_02: so so it's okay he's uh still calling me every couple weeks to make sure i'm on the right path and i'm training properly and yeah we've been friends for a little while he's not arm wrestle uh himself yeah he was telling me some of his stories from the soviet times you know
SPEAKER_02: yeah yeah me too me too you know he he have a lot of stories and he been around arm wrestling for a very long time so he's he's helping me with some advices sometimes when i'm doing stupid things he's like you know don't yeah he's helping me a little bit and and and the other ladies oh i think petrenko came hello hello oleg
SPEAKER_02: Hello, sorry for being late. Hello, all good. He's saying, sorry, sorry, I'm a little late. No, no, it's okay, it's okay. He's only late five minutes, it's okay. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
SPEAKER_00: So, Oleg, how is everything? I see you sharing a lot of photos with some officials from Ukraine. So, it looks like you became, like, very, I don't know, they are proud of you in your country. I see that lately you post a lot of photos on social media.
SPEAKER_01: with various official representatives. He says that they are proud of you now in Ukraine, something has changed a little, right? Yes, yes, it's true, the local authorities have made a lot of progress. Not only that, friends are calling, awarding with honorary diplomas, greeting, taking pictures with the belt.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, he's saying, yeah, absolutely, everybody recognized me, the local government, and not only, everybody is trying to make a picture with me with a belt, and they recognized me very well.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I'm happy for him. He worked a lot, he worked hard, and he didn't give up. And he finally reached his target right now. I mean, personally, I have never seen armwrestling at this level of difficulty. The other day, Neil was describing it as Jurassic Park.
SPEAKER_02: oleg petrenko became number one so that that at least to me means a lot you know what he did uh
SPEAKER_02: It's a film about the Jewish period. It's a film where everyone becomes so powerful and says that it's a very serious achievement, that you reached such a level at such a difficult time and you deserve such a deep praise. I worked a lot, I came a long way, and I think that now I'm at a new level and the category that I'm fighting for is 105.
SPEAKER_02: Can you turn the volume up a little bit? Do you also have a hard time, Paolo, to hear? Yes, yes. Yep.
SPEAKER_02: i heard him what he said he said that uh yeah i've been working uh very hard and you know hard work will always pays off yeah yeah
SPEAKER_00: and he also said that 105 category is probably the most concurrent and most difficult category as of right now so he thinks he belongs yes yes yes that's true i mean to win the category is very hard probably to become the champion i think super heavyweight is also probably is the hardest to beat levan but in in this category the the competition
SPEAKER_00: is so deep and then very, I don't know, the athletes are very close to each other, the level, and so many favourites, you know, to win this category, in my opinion. This last event, I saw Petrenko a bit aggressive also at the table. Was it like, you know, like, no more nice guy, this is my dream, I'm gonna...
SPEAKER_00: win it or it was a little bit because of how that it came before behave to or like zog or what was the motivation i saw him he was when i said aggressive i'm not staying aggressive in a way that which is not like fair but he was just like more like fighting spirit you know what was the motivation behind this
SPEAKER_02: Yes, I agree that the 105th category is the deepest and the most difficult category. Of course, the super heavy category is also very difficult, because there are the Lebanese who have to win.
SPEAKER_02: It's impossible right now, according to the practice. But yes, 105 is definitely the deepest. And everyone is so motivated and training very seriously. And he says, this time I saw that Oleg was more aggressive.
SPEAKER_02: He improved not in the sense that he showed aggression, but he was more aggressive. He was very focused and I saw that he was very motivated. What pushed you and what motivated you so much? This fight was very important for me, because it was a fight for the world championship title, which I wanted for a long time.
SPEAKER_01: And everyone saw that I was not always able to win when I had such a fall.
SPEAKER_01: Emotionally, it was hard to cope. I was a little worried. In the fight, it was also added that Dadikyan is a disciple of Cyplenkov, I am a disciple of Pushkar, and I wanted to bring Andriy to his school. There was a lot of responsibility. Aggression, well, David did not behave very well with Oleg Zhokh.
SPEAKER_02: he said yeah it was very very important match for me because it was world title and uh you know he was
SPEAKER_02: training hard before that but it was not always that he can pull the win and it was the way uh so and when he received this opportunity it was a biggest motivation he said also it was a motivation because uh daddy can is uh uh uh
SPEAKER_02: been learning from Denis Tsiplenkov and Oleg has been taught by Andriy Pushkar. And that was his big motivation to, you know... So he felt himself that he's representing Andriy Pushkar while Dadikyan was representing Denis. So the same old competition continues. Yes, yes. And plus he said also that when it was a match between Dadikyan and
SPEAKER_02: Oleg was a little bit jumpy and a little aggressive, yes. So Oleg said it was a motivation to win too, to put him a little bit, to cool him down a little bit. Okay. So does he think that there is anyone on this Earth
SPEAKER_02: That is 105 kilos that can beat him. Oleg, do you think there is someone on this planet in the 105th category who can beat you today? I think there are people who can fight me on a level.
SPEAKER_01: Will I win? Well, I have to fight for it. I hope that I will hold this title for as long as possible and work for it. I can't say that no one in me will be able to win. Because, I repeat once again, it's a very competitive category, and everyone is very strong, motivated, and everyone wants to win this title. So I think there will be great fights.
SPEAKER_01: So it's not easy. But I'm ready for this challenge. I think I'll be able to keep this title in the next fights for sure. Artem there any names? Is there anything on your mind? Yes, from the contenders, I think it's Petro Margarin. Devon Larratt, as far as I know, wants to fight in 105.
SPEAKER_02: Okay. Oleg is saying that he believes that there is plenty of people on a similar level. He said that they can win. He said, I don't know if they can win. We need to check that on the table. He said that very deep class. Everybody is very motivated to get that title.
SPEAKER_02: And he said that probably on the same level, maybe Todd Hutchings, maybe Petro Margarine, and maybe Devon Larratt, if he's serious about pulling 105 kg class. And that's the closest name he can think about right now. Oh, so Devon is the closest name to him? Devon, Todd Hutchings, and Petro Margarine, he said. Oh, okay, okay.
SPEAKER_00: Does he have a goal to have the, like, I, at the end, you know, whenever he wins three times, you know, he gets the belt for three times, but at his backside of his mind, there is such goal to have the belt permanently?
SPEAKER_02: I'm sorry, that's my mistake. Yes, he mentioned that he thinks that he will hold the belt for the nearest future, for sure. And he will try to hold it for as long as possible. And now I will ask him your question. Oleg, he asks if you plan to win at least three times in a row to leave this belt with you. Yes, of course. Of course, I work on it.
SPEAKER_02: It's not what I'm aiming for, it's my main goal right now. To keep this title and defend it at least three times. That's what's left of me. Yeah, as Oleg said, that's, yes, this is the main goal. Exactly what I'm working on right now. To win at least three times and to have that title and the belt at my possession forever. Okay, like, how does he see his chance? The reason I ask him if anybody can beat him
SPEAKER_00: think anybody can beat you i mean you shouldn't be thinking that way but in fact i meant devon i meant devon devon devon is serious about pulling a lighter category the other day when i talked with him he is 108 kilos right now 108 kilos and
SPEAKER_00: I'm just thinking, I just want to ask Petrenko, in his mind, how does he see this match? Does he think that, he said that right now, he sure will hold the title in near future. And what does he think if just say that Devon says that, okay, let's pull Oleg?
SPEAKER_02: He asks, he says, well, I want to hear Oleg's opinion. He says, where is he? Larratt, yes, very serious in terms of fighting in 105. He is now holding a weight of about 108 kilograms. And I'm sure it will be. And he says, how do you see it? Will you win in 105-kilogram Larratt? And how can this fight take place?
SPEAKER_01: Yes, I also follow Devon. I see that he weighs about 110 kilos. Yes, I am ready to fight Devon. I understand how serious he is, technical, strong athlete. I am ready to win him. I am confident that I can win him. And the fight as ours will take place, I think that maybe it will take place quite quickly.
SPEAKER_02: Oleg says he's watching and following Devon pretty closely and he knows that he's sitting at around 110 kg and he thinks that yes
SPEAKER_02: he knows that he's ready to pull and win with Devon at 105 and he said yeah that uh that that match will be relatively fast and he said I hope everybody understand uh why I think that that match have to be fast finished I don't wanna
SPEAKER_01: be that match prolongated but he is knows what he's dealing with and he recognizes and he respects Devon as a very serious strong and technical athlete.
SPEAKER_01: That's why I want to do it for Andriy. To take revenge on Larratt. It's a basic fight for me. It's not just a fight for titles. It will be more than just a fight.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, Oleg is saying that it's going to be much, much more than just a title match for him because Devon won with Andrei Pushkar and Andrei did not have a chance to pull the match revenge. So Oleg is going to do it for him. So Oleg is going to do the job for Andrei? Yes, yes.
SPEAKER_00: And what did Oleg think when Devon got the control and he just waited and looked at Andrei's face? It really disturbed him, the way that Devon, after he secured the win, the way that he usually holds people in a little bit of place. Did it hurt Oleg?
SPEAKER_02: He said Devon got it, but we will change it.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, but he thinks that he believes that, okay, he believes that he will win fast or he believes that he has to win fast? Do you think that you will win fast or do you think that you need to win fast? I think that I need to win fast and I will do everything to do so. I can fight in different ways, I am quite versatile.
SPEAKER_02: Now I have no injuries, I'm in good shape, the best shape, and I think I'll get even better. I hope this will be enough. Oleg says that he thinks that he needs to win fast, but he also said that he's in the best shape of his life, there is no injuries, and he's getting better and better, and he said that I think it's going to be enough.
SPEAKER_00: So does he think that if Devon challenges him in November, will he be even better shaped than the last two matches, previous matches? Or he will be able to stay? Do you think that if the fight takes place in November, you will be even better shaped than you were with Dadikyan? Or will it be the same?
SPEAKER_01: Oleg is saying that he is resting
SPEAKER_02: Oleg is saying that he is progressing and he is resting right now after the supermatch. There is no pain and he is fully recovered and he can start preparation for the next one even today.
SPEAKER_02: As soon as he hear from you and he said every king of the table or West versus West, he was bringing better and better form. And he doesn't see why the next one will be the same. He will be better. He said that he's progressing and he feels that there is a room for improvement still.
SPEAKER_00: I understand. So he took the revenge from Dennis through the Rican match. And now he's going for Devon. So he's just taking care of the old books, you know, old pages. Yeah. Okay. Let's see what Devon is thinking if he wants to go 115 or he wants to go 105.
SPEAKER_00: I think we can, but does he want Devon to be his next opponent or someone else, Oleg?
SPEAKER_02: Oleg is reading a history book and closing it page by page with Denis. Pushkaryom and I are going to have a fight with Larratt. He asks you if you think Larratt should be your next opponent or someone else. Artem you ready for Larratt now?
SPEAKER_01: I'm sorry, he says that Larratt is still thinking. He hasn't said yet if he will fight at 115 or 105. If Larratt is ready to fight at 105, I'm ready to fight him. I feel that I can. I am confident that I will be able to fight him, at least.
SPEAKER_01: So I would like this match. I think if Devon is 105, then Devon deserves this fight for the title. He is number one. Of all those who fight in 105, Devon does not need previous fights to fight for the title. Because it's enough. Because it's enough. Yes, yes.
SPEAKER_02: uh oleg thinking that uh uh yes devon is uh number one in that in that class if you want to pull 105 and he definitely deserved the match uh the most out of everybody on the list because of his uh previous achievements and for who he is and oleg says yes i want this match
SPEAKER_02: And would you prefer to just kick the 105 and pull Devon in 115 for another title, or he would prefer just to be 105? Oleg, do you want to keep this belt in 105 for now and fight with Larratt in 115, or do you still wait and want to fight with him in 105? No, I can keep this title in 105 and fight with him in 115.
SPEAKER_02: Oleg's saying that, yes, I'm very ambitious. I will keep that 105 title and I will take another one in 115, no problem. He will choose to pull for 115? He said, yeah, no problem. I will pull him in 115 and I will take another title. How about they meet at 110 for both titles?
SPEAKER_02: And what if Engin told you to meet at 110 and put two titles on the table? Two belts. Interesting. Interesting. I need to think. But this proposition is very interesting. I think I'm more yes or no. But I need to think. Oleg says that
SPEAKER_00: very very interesting he said uh most likely yes but this is not a hard answer let me think about it for a little bit yeah yeah because if he's 105 he wants to make sure that because oleg walks around 105 kilo if somebody wants that title he wants him to be 105. he can he can risk something to pull against someone heavy for second title but he wouldn't want to risk what he has already this is i think what he thinks
SPEAKER_02: But his engine, I saw in his eyes, he is not afraid. If the decision would be only... There are some people behind him, he has to consult probably. That's why he said, most likely, yes. But yeah, he is not afraid of that. I saw that. He won it. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: sometimes sometimes you know when when some people are very nice you may be doubting their courage but they are just nice because they they want to be nice not not because they are here you know in in last event like oleg showed you know like whenever he wants it can be really
SPEAKER_02: I mean, I'm not saying physically tough, he's already tough, but usually he's a little bit shy, you know, but this last event just showed that he can be really tough. And let's see how it will be.
SPEAKER_02: Oleg is saying that maybe it's not visible from the side very well, but he said that he is very, very responsible to any super matches always. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: He can be very, I don't know, maybe I'm saying wrong, but aggressive to protect his dreams on his way. He's not going to be shy, he's not going to be too nice and lose the title. He knows that that is the moment and I saw him in the last event.
SPEAKER_00: whenever he was doing like this. So that again, I was like, wow, these things I never saw with Petrenko, that he was just, he was a little bit like bullying back, you know, just the way that he was, yeah. Anyway, so that is good. So what does he think about some of the upcoming matches?
SPEAKER_02: Can we have some predictions from him and also from you, Paolo? Let's start from some of the matches.
SPEAKER_01: Corey West and Travis Bergens. Do you know both? Of course, I know both. I think it's Corey West. Maybe Travis will take the form, but I think Corey West will win. He's too big for him.
SPEAKER_02: Oleg says that Corey West, in his opinion, will win. He said it's possible that Travis will gain the form, but Corey is, he said, too big for him. Okay. Dave Chaffee and Frank Lampirelli, before that, did you want to say your opinion, Paolo? Maybe you already said, but...
SPEAKER_02: yeah i'm i'm very much waiting for this one uh i want to see it because uh corey yes he's very big very strong uh but he's too straight forward on the table and he doesn't have too many options uh which is not uh which is not easy to beat but still for travis i believe there is uh there is a there is a slight age for travis i would say 52 to 48 but travis
SPEAKER_01: he will over arm wrestle him on over started on the table yeah and Frank versus Dave Chaffee Dave Chaffee and Frank lamparelli I want and hope that Chaffee will win that he will gain his good form the best he had
SPEAKER_01: Because I like his fight. I know this athlete for a long time. If he will be in the same form as he was last year, I think Lampirelli will win. Very good Lampirelli.
SPEAKER_02: Oleg is saying that he wants Dave Chaffee to win. He's cheering for him because he knows the athlete and he likes his arm wrestling style. And he hopes that he will bring a better form than the last time. But if he will bring the similar or the same form as the last time, then Lampirelli may pull the win because he's a very good top roller. And what do you think?
SPEAKER_02: i think that dave chafee will be able to control the top role and uh uh chafee will i will give him a slight edge uh plus chafee has a very good flop press which may play the difference too so i believe that chafee will win this i understand yeah and attachments versus prudnik your category
SPEAKER_02: He's cheering for Prudnik for sure, and he wishes that Prudnik will bring the previous form. But looking at the reality and situation, he thinks that Tadkaczyns will win this time.
SPEAKER_00: hmm okay i understand and john bersink versus uh leonidas by the way by the way what's your opinion about this mr tatachins and prudnik yeah that has you too you think tatachins will win i'm pretty sure yes do you think that do you think that prudnik may go there with a different shape
SPEAKER_02: then I don't think so I'm following uh prudnik and uh I don't see any big changes in his preparation so I think he will be at this approximately the same shape as the last time and he he need to change something and uh you know gain the 2019 uh top eight form then then for sure prudnik yes but at the moment I believe that that Hutchings okay
SPEAKER_02: And John Brzenk, Leonidas? Leonidas and John Brzenk. John. John, I think, no problem. He said John, and John, I think, without any problems. Without any problems, okay. That's interesting, yeah. I would say the same. I would say the same. Leonidas is very good and very strong, but not at the John's level.
SPEAKER_00: hmm don't you think with that the constant back pressure before the goal he may take john's hand as he did to school boy oh not enough no i believe it's not enough not enough no no john okay and but which way john inside side top roll uh his style posting top roll and you know or high hook let's say
SPEAKER_01: yeah okay okay yeah he he he will post it he will cap it and he will win okay and pauline versus rushtan um
SPEAKER_02: Pauline is in better shape than he was back then. I think it's an unforgivable match and I can't even say who will win. Oleg is saying that this is a very unpredictable match and he believes it's 50-50. Because last time Rustam had an injury and he was dominant before the injury.
SPEAKER_02: But still Paul Linn is progressing all this time and he's most likely bringing much better shape than that time. And he said unpredictable when I see it very interesting 50 50. Okay.
SPEAKER_02: And I will agree with that statement. You agree? 50-50? Yes, because I saw how Pauline stopped Rustam last time, why the injury happened. Because Pauline stopped him in the middle of the table, basically. And that's why the injury happened. And that was a red flag for me. So I want to see it very much. Do you think that it was Rustam's first match and Rustam also...
SPEAKER_02: improving since that time uh for rustam it's hard to improve be after all those years you know no no but he was he was inactive you know for many years yes i i know i know uh maybe but improvements improvements for rustam cannot be significant because of the you know age and how beat up his body from all these years of armor wrestling he may improve a little bit but not too much
SPEAKER_00: No, what I'm just saying that he improving while he's training is I understand. But whenever you don't train for four years, and then you come in like three months training, then...
SPEAKER_02: Yes, that is very true and very possible. And I want to see Rustam. I love Rustam. And I want to see him come back strong as ever. And it's a very interesting match. That's why I said it's a very interesting match. If Rustam didn't improve since last time he pulled against Paul, then I would say Rustam is underdog this time. If he improved,
SPEAKER_00: then the things may be different, because I think that Paul is improving. Yes. Yeah, exactly. I agree with that. Yeah. Anyway, so some other matches we have Matt Mask versus Lars Oleg. Matt Mask. I think Matt Mask. Matt Mask has a very strong upper hand, and I think he'll win because of that.
SPEAKER_00: He's pretty sure that Matt Mask will win with Lars. Lars' style may be difficult for him if Lars applies. I think years ago they pulled, I think Lars won. But of course, you know, we all change. We all learn, you know. What do you think, Paolo? I don't know. I want to see this match. I would say it's 50-50. Very close match. Because with Lars...
SPEAKER_02: abilities of pulling and changing the styles on the table and applying side pressure more than anything uh he may he may if he will you know he will not lose completely the wrist at the very first hit then lars will win so i want to see the matches to me it's very close i think lars losing the wrist i don't think he cares so much as long as he passes the center yeah yeah
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, he can press very well too, so I don't know. I don't know. I want to see it. After I saw him pulling Monster, I want to see this match. It was a very close match with Monster, and Monster is a monster. Yeah, and Oleg, Michael Todd versus Kamil Jablonski. I think Michael Todd will win, but it will also be a tough match, because Kamil scored.
SPEAKER_01: Michael Todd will win.
SPEAKER_02: He said, overall, I think that Michael Todd will win, but it's going to be a very, very difficult match. There will be not easy. Camille is gaining very, very good form right now, and he believes that it's going to be enough to stop Michael. But he said it's difficult, but he thinks that Michael Todd will win. Okay. Okay. And I think the same way, approximately. So you are saying that Michael is going to beat Camille? Yes.
SPEAKER_00: Does it have anything to do with your friendship with Michael? No. That you want him to win? No, it's not that. How do you see Michael winning? How do you see? Which way?
SPEAKER_02: uh first of all michael can surprise camille i believe michael is even faster than camille and he can off the goal uh maybe not first match but he yes yes michael is very fast when he wanted to when he have his confidence on the proper level
SPEAKER_02: can do it almost to anybody in this world so i believe one of the scenario is that a second scenario is he can sit in his uh i'm not saying king's move he doesn't have king's move anymore i believe he have that open top roll very uncomfortable with his pronator engaged uh he can sit there for a pretty long time and if he and he can at the same time he can manage you know the center of the table do you think that he can be in a losing position like this and then
SPEAKER_02: kamil is all over him and he can still he he he may not pull it out but he can still be there and you know pulling the center towards him so camille may not reach with his shoulder without crossing the center of the table
SPEAKER_02: it's gonna be a little bit too far you know you know what i'm talking about yeah yeah yeah i'm just trying to understand your reasons yeah that may drain out camille's endurance and then michael still can you know do his fast things after camille is a little tired and cannot start properly and stuff like that so it's gonna be it's gonna be it's gonna be a mess on the table for sure but it's yeah i believe michael can pull that win yes
SPEAKER_02: So I want to ask to Oleg, Jerry versus Alex Kurdecha. He's saying that Alex Kurdecha gonna win and 3-0 or 4-0, whatever it is. And he said that I believe that he
SPEAKER_00: do you agree with this yes so alex will beat him with his classic move or he will have to adjustments
SPEAKER_02: i think he will adjust because he saw already oh i'm sorry that's not christian for me no no i'm asking you i am asking you paulo okay okay yeah i i think alex will make uh an adjustment because uh if he will make that mistake and will go his classic way then jerry may stop him but uh he saw many times and there is plenty of videos and there is airmas match with uh with jerry which is showing the way
SPEAKER_00: where you have to go to beat jerry you know about 15 centimeters shorter than alex you know hermes kind of was low yes that arm height you know to go that low he will be like almost parallel to the
SPEAKER_00: table surface you know because if he goes low you know that's really parallel but he has to be because his arm is very tall so do you think that whenever he goes like this there is a possibility jerry to also do something different than this one as as you remember one round kennedy tried to go inside with him and then yes jerry didn't do this he just
SPEAKER_02: press him to the table and i and i believe that's the way for alex and it doesn't matter how low his uh hand will be to the table uh yeah he's so much stronger and so much bigger and uh yeah he
SPEAKER_02: And he proved it with Morozov. I understand it's a different arm, but he proved it. His left arm for sure better than his right arm. I understand that. But he showed us that he can be and his preparation went well. Because back in four or five years ago, it was...
SPEAKER_02: only one move for him. That's it. He didn't do anything else. I remember him pulling a lot. It was Rustam Babaiev. And I saw that, you know, it was a Goliath and David pulling. Listen, it was complicated. He did not do the adjustment. But lately, he did his homework. Definitely. He, he very well knows what he's doing on a table. So I believe that table IQ is high now and he will do proper things.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, for me, with left arm, I have hook even won the world titles. With right arm, I can't, you know, like I can, but it depends on the level of the
SPEAKER_02: uh opponents you know i mean right so sometimes yeah it's different it's different for sure but it's it's it's yeah it's it's his time alex is in his uh he's matured by now he's not you know too young anymore he's matured he's big strong and his table q iq is on the level and i believe that's that's that's his time
SPEAKER_00: okay so you both are thinking that alex is gonna win and most likely will dominate three zero yes because if it is not a domination if it is a i'm not talking about only the score if i'm not talking about his score if the match is not domination this is a war then then then jerry absolutely absolutely yeah anyway so
SPEAKER_00: Let's go some other matches quickly. Giannis versus Justin Bishop. I will ask most of this to you, but not so deep deep analysis so we can also talk about some future things. What do you think about Justin versus Giannis?
SPEAKER_02: Do you want me to ask Oleg? No, I'm only asking you because most of the Eastern guys are not super familiar when it goes to the lighter categories and the Aymeric, yeah. But you can ask him. I answered this question. I'm cheering for Justin and I like the guy and he's an amazing arm wrestler. But I believe that Janis' level of understanding and table IQ will provide him with the tools to win. And I believe Janis will win.
SPEAKER_02: time and mindagas versus artem taranenko very complicated but and i'm cheering for artyom he's a friend of mine but i believe in douglas uh will win this time okay and and hunter versus douglas i don't know you cannot predict this one not not enough knowledge of both of the guys okay hunter is amazing that i know but i don't want to predict this one
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, and Ryan vs. Raimonds? Ryan Ballinger vs. Raimonds Liepins? I think Raimonds should win this one, but I don't know. I don't know. It's the power and stylistically Raimonds should win this match. I think Ryan is too big for him, but we will see.
SPEAKER_02: it's it's it's maybe disadvantage for him but we'll see exactly we'll see advantage yes in this situation yes because if raymond's and i believe he will be able to set his deep hook you know then shorter forearm may be his advantage and he may you know may do it i i i think raymond's may win and i like the design i like his style elizabeth versus alexandra
SPEAKER_02: elizabeth will win this time alexandra is more technical for sure and more experience and i like both ladies uh but i believe a little bit is just too powerful too powerful for this time elizabeth is too strong huh too strong too strong she's benching more than me no not more but seriously she's benching she's she's benching like us 55 kilos dumbbells
SPEAKER_02: Okay, I'm Erlich versus Jonathan Breda. Jonathan is extremely good right now. Extremely good. On his own land, I will give him an edge. I will give him an edge. 55%. Okay, let's go. Reg versus Paul Talbott.
SPEAKER_02: This is a very complicated match. I told already. What do you think about Paul Calvert? He is amazing. He's incredible. That's the only one match I lost at Monster Factory left-handed. Only one round. And he was like 35 pounds lighter than me. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: he's he's incredible but uh yeah i i think paul talbot will still flash pin rash every time but it's i want to see the match it's very unpredictable so there is possibly that paul talbot can win with flash pins yes okay you are the probably the only one that is this level hopeful about paul most of the people saying that rage is the favorites here
SPEAKER_00: I would not put him as a favorite. He is in certain positions. There is nobody who can, you know, finish him. But he needs to get in that certain position first. So we'll see. Craig Tullier versus Tom Holland. Craig Tullier. Craig Tullier. Okay. So these are your predictions. And let's go. Let's go. Talk about a little bit future. Irakli.
SPEAKER_00: Do you know Gyorgy Tautiev? Oleg. Gyorgy Tautiev is who? But I'm just asking, does he know him? I think they were in the same category in 2018, Antalya. Right? You know Tautiev, right?
SPEAKER_02: Has he ever pulled him? Yes, yes. He said same category, Turkey, and he said probably Bulgaria one more time. But they were in the same category. Has he ever actually pulled him?
SPEAKER_02: Did you fight with him? Did you fight with him? I fought with him on the left. I lost to him on the left then. Tautiev won? Tautiev won, yes. So this time Tautiev is pulling Irakli Zrakashvili, 95kg world title. What do you think? Tautiev, Zrakashvili, 95kg, what do you think?
SPEAKER_01: It's a very strong match. I don't know in which form, but Irakli is in a very strong form. We all see it. For the 95th category, I think he's almost like Levan in weight. Almost like the 95th. Possibly, yes. I think Irakli will win. His current form, he's very strong.
SPEAKER_02: Oleg's saying that, yeah, we all see how good form of Irakli is. And he said that Irakli for 95 kg is almost the same as Levan for super heavies. And I said, yeah, almost like you for 105. He smiled and he said, yeah, well, let's say that. And he said that he believes that Irakli will win. But he also said that this is a very strong match.
SPEAKER_00: What does he think about? He says that Levan comparing with 95 kilo Irakli about dominance in the category. But what does he think about Rustam versus Irakli match that every time when the buckle was on Irakli, Rustam was winning and Rustam was asked to choose the buckle side. He didn't care. And he just started with the buckle on. And then every time he had the buckle, he lost. Every time Irakli
SPEAKER_00: at the Baku-Rustam. So that's the thing that there is a huge difference between Rustam and what that's the thing about if Tatashins pulls 95 kilos against Irakli.
SPEAKER_02: What do you think about Rustam's fight with Iratliev? Every time he got a punch from Rementsev, it went in one direction. The punch changed and went in the other direction. I also asked him what do you think about their fight with Tad Khachynz in 1995. Do you think he's as undefeated as Levan? I think he's stronger than them now. Babaiev can win against him.
SPEAKER_01: Only Rustam needs to gain his form. I think he wasn't at the peak last time. He might be better. But at the moment I see that Irakli is number 1, 95. To the right.
SPEAKER_02: Well, like saying that right now, as of right now, Irakli is getting so good form that he is number one. And Rustam, yes, he can be, but he is not at his peak form. He needs to gain the previous form. Irakli is in such a good shape that he is number one right now in 95. Yeah, and Toghachins? Toghachins 95?
SPEAKER_01: I don't think so. I think it will add to the competition. But still, I support the fact that Irakli will win against Khachyns. I would be interested in Khachyns against Babaiev.
SPEAKER_02: Okay. Yeah, he's saying that at the moment, Todd Hutchings probably will create a huge, you know, huge waves in there. But he said at the current form, he believes that Zyrokashvili and Iratli will win. So he says that as of now, nobody can beat Iratli at 95 kilos. Yeah. He also said that Babaiev and Hutchings will be very, very interesting match.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, we will see all these matches. We will see all these matches. Maybe we can see some very surprising match next event for Tata Xing. It's very surprising. If I ask you guys to choose 20 guys, you guys will not guess right, Paul. Trust me. You can even try if you want. But you will not know his opponent, you know.
SPEAKER_00: I will not. I know you're very creative sometimes. I will not. I will wait until you announce it. Yeah, soon. And so let's go to some other one. Oleg Dzok, 85 kilos. What if he pulls Bekir Oniyani at 95 kilos again? We know that two years ago.
SPEAKER_00: Oleg Zokh beat Betkili Oniyan. And do you think that today Oleg can still beat Betkili? I think Zokh and Betkili. Betkili 95, Oleg 85.
SPEAKER_01: As far as I know, Dzhok has already won. Yes, he's in better shape now. We saw that he destroyed Tainov. I didn't expect that from him. Dzhok will win again, because we are sparring with him. Now we will sparring often. I think we will prepare as well as he and I. I think I will be a good sparring partner for Dzhok.
SPEAKER_02: He's saying that we already saw once when Oleg won, but he believes that Oniani gained much, much better form. He's also saying that they are training and pulling relatively often with Zhoch, and he's saying that Zhoch will pull another win.
SPEAKER_02: because i know what the level and we are helping each other uh you know yes yes so he believes that yes all equivalent uh and does he think that anyone anyone 85 could okay and also i'm asking you paulo same uh
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, Oleg is saying that he thought, and I said, yeah, I thought so too, that Sasha was going to win.
SPEAKER_02: in 85 but you know it's went another way so and he said anybody who could already tried and nobody can so he believes that there is nobody yet uh from me i would say engen you have to step in the game this is better this is last year last year i i believe the same thing whenever i say you know these people are top rolling him
SPEAKER_00: and still cannot finish. And I'm like, oh, no, you know, and then. And you step in, you can. You need to do the shoulder pressure to finish him. Otherwise, you know, you take his wrist. He still beats people, you know, just like, I mean, incredible. You know what, Pablo, you need to control his
SPEAKER_00: pronated. You just take his hand, you overpronate. When you overpronate, actually you are not putting pressure from here to his arm anymore because you go and then he's helping him. He just gives here because you are overpronated. Whether he's doing this, you need to really focus more on
SPEAKER_00: turn here, and then you need to turn with your fist over his pronate. If it over pronate, then you are in trouble. And that's exactly what I'm saying, Kengen. You have to try because your style. Listen, knowing all these things,
SPEAKER_00: and having enough health and power totally different thing you know it just I wish I would just go into some young guy's head and then physically I'm I'm right now weak and I don't know anyway so just okay or like this one I know this is a little bit tickling you this subject which is
SPEAKER_00: Alican Morado versus Ivan Matyshenko. I know that you want Alican again, you know, because the match wasn't that close. And when you pull Alican, you were not as strong as you were today. And I know you are stronger, but I know Alican is also stronger. So these two people, Alican and Ivan Matyshenko, they will be pulling for 115 kilo world title. What do you think about this match? And what do you think about your future match?
SPEAKER_02: Again with Alizhan. Again with Alizhan, okay. Oleg says, I know that you like this theme a little bit. And yes, he says, now there will be a match between Alizhan and Matyushenko. And I know that you want to try Alizhan, because then you were a little bit not in the form that you are now. He says, don't forget that Alizhan is also practicing. He doesn't sit still. He says, but what do you think?
SPEAKER_01: How will this match be and how will your next match with Alizhan be? I think the fight will be equal. I can't even say who will win 50-50. Matyushenko is strong, Alizhan is strong. He was strong, he has now progressed even more. I don't know what form he will bring now. Maybe even better form. As for me,
SPEAKER_01: I'm ready to fight him. I think I showed everyone back then that I'm ready to fight him. We fought well. I think I made technical mistakes. I tried to fight him from above. I lost a lot of strength. I stopped near Ryan's pillow, pulled him out of there. And I lost a lot of strength in the second round. And if everyone remembers, Ryan burned me in the first round because I started pulling him to the pillow. I felt that he couldn't knock me out of the center.
SPEAKER_02: I want to ask Engin. After that, I'll talk to Larratt. Will you give me Alizhan? Okay. Yeah, he said that future match Alizhan and Matyushenko is unpredictable because he said Matyushenko is incredible and Alizhan is getting better every day. So he said 50-50. I don't know. We need to see the match. He commented on his and Alizhan match. He said, listen, I did my mistakes in the first match.
SPEAKER_02: know first uh first round i was winning then he fell out then i was trying to top roll and he'd been stopping me you know and i've been stopping him next to the pet i spent too much energy so i did my mistakes i want it back and he said ask engine straightforward when i will take care of devon larrett will he give me alijan again
SPEAKER_00: After? Yes. I mean we have to give him you know because we have to give him because he is I know how he progressed his right arm from that time to this time and then I'm sure his left arm also progressed and I know Alican also progressed but that match was very close and I think that
SPEAKER_00: Next time, we'll be close again. I don't know which way we go, but for sure he deserves it. For sure. For sure he deserves it. But Ali Can also, beating heavier guys, he also deserves to have a title shot for 115 kilos against Matyushenko. What's your opinion about this? Maybe you translate first to him?
SPEAKER_02: He says, yes, yes, we are forced, we will definitely give you this opportunity, because, yes, of course, you are progressing with the left, probably the same as with the right, if not better. He says, he is progressing, he also deserves a match in the 115 category, because he beat a couple of tough guys there too. So it's a process, but he says, we must, we must prove it.
SPEAKER_02: both athletes are super fast so the speed of matyushenko probably will not play the crucial role in this match uh so it will became to power and power wise they're they're both very powerful
SPEAKER_02: it's it's gonna be a hook and i believe it's gonna be stopped somewhere in the middle of the table if it will happen that matushenko amazingness hooking ability will press uh alijan a little bit of the position maybe matushenko will win but also alijan is extremely powerful so i i would not predict it i believe matushenko is still very slight favorite in my opinion
SPEAKER_00: okay i i think alijan has more of the the side power power while as you said matushenko really isolates that the pronation with his copying so he really like to to hit the side way you need to have a little bit pronator you know to hit but when you are just totally turned like your palm facing up you
SPEAKER_00: He may go this way, but I don't know. But as you said, people say that Ali Can will dominate Ivan. It is just like Ivan is not Cody Merritt. Cody is going high when Ivan just pulls him in and turns here, everything is over.
SPEAKER_00: Ivan is not Hermes Gasparini who is going outside. This guy is totally inside. Same as Petrenko can also do inside match. But he also beat Prudnik. But I think 115 kilo Ivan Matushenko is stronger than 105 Prudnik. Especially the Prudnik today.
SPEAKER_00: okay yeah we'll see we'll see i can't wait for this one too absolutely incredible match yeah yeah i agree i agree yeah there will be this year end of this year there will be a match for levan
SPEAKER_00: We will soon find out, you know, the match will be decided and looks like most likely King of the Table will be in Vegas in December. Anyways, guys, after this one, I will have another podcast with Levan Saganashvili exactly 51 minutes later. And one thing I like to ask Oleg, you know, when you are competing in training, it's so hard, but does he enjoy it?
SPEAKER_02: These events that just organize one after another, and there are goals that, you know, those categories, the rankings, you know, does he enjoy to be part of this? He says, I understand that when you train and prepare, it's a little hard, but do you get pleasure? Do you like to be part of this system, this event and all that? Do you like this organization?
SPEAKER_01: Yes, of course. I also enjoy training. When I prepare for a fight, I don't just train, but when I'm preparing, I enjoy it. I enjoy how I progress, how I win. I like the organization. It's a sports family, armwrestling, our meetings. It's a part of my life, and I'll fight until I can.
SPEAKER_02: said yeah absolutely it's part of my life and he's saying i'm not only concentrated on my training when i'm even getting ready for a serious event i'm still watching you know and following and i love my arm wrestling family and i'm part of it and i'm enjoying this absolutely
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I also, I also like it. I also like to, I have boards that all the names are written there. I do the mashups, Paolo. I love it because I was in hospital for like one month in all those health problems. The other day, finally, I went front of that with my marker, you know, and I'm like, oh yeah, now let's start, you know, I love doing those matchmaking and yeah.
SPEAKER_00: you're very good at it again you're very good at it you create i mean i love it yeah i love doing it yeah if you think i'm good at it you know yeah i do my best but for sure for sure i love it and for sure i try to involve as many athletes as possible you know even even i know i'm gonna lose some money i'm like i need to organize this one too because this guy training
SPEAKER_00: an offer from me, you know, so it just I don't want to disappoint, but you cannot really
SPEAKER_02: do for everyone if I do for everyone every event I need to organize 30 matches so I'm just yeah I cannot I cannot but but I do my best trust me there is ranking there is somebody who deserve it a little more than another doesn't mean you know that other one is bad no he's good too but this one is you know number one that one is number two so this one's getting the match and that one getting the match next time yeah also we have the qualification guys you know colorful
SPEAKER_00: qualified you need to invite them as well absolutely because if I don't do the qualification then people are like how are we gonna come to that stage you know but but I realized that like over there in U.S Atlas Cup Atlas are more likely waiting for over that they're trying to be qualified you know so we decided that that that uh Challenger event to be
SPEAKER_00: understand that one so we can choose and i will i will continue with the international uh qualifications because for this event people even came from australia new zealand you know yeah they will go even bigger because they they they don't wait they just come and try to be qualified you know anyways oleg my friend i wish you i wish you the best with your preparation just make sure that

You never disappoint. You know, you always just come in. I never in fact see you as a translator, but I see you as someone who is also guest because
SPEAKER_02: very well and you yourself also a top puller and you are a smart guy so i'm i thank you for being part of it thank you again thank you for inviting me oleg he says he wants you to be well prepared to be healthy that's the most important thing and he says well we'll see you in November he says and very soon we will make a decision and we will know who will be your next opponent
SPEAKER_02: He said, thank you, thank you very much. He said, yeah, well, I really want Larratt. And if he cannot pull 105, I would step up to 115. And he believes that he can pull him in 115. So he wants his next match to be Devon. Doesn't matter, 105 or 115.
