SPEAKER_01: okay hello hello hello everyone so thank you guys thank you hello vm hello kartik ah there is no guest only you guys and i hello parker hello godzilla
SPEAKER_01: I talked with Brian Shaw, like, maybe two, three weeks ago. Trip or... Aleykum salam, kardeşim. Alhamdulillah, sen nasılsın? Yep, yep. Todd and Oleg's love child. Yeah, you're right. Chip Ferguson. Yes, yes, I feel better. Thank you. Ah, no, shoulders are not big. I'm the smallest. I measure... I remember my forearm.
SPEAKER_01: being almost 41 centimeter right now like i'm talking about cold right now 37 maximum everything is smaller shoulder small arm small everything is small yeah but it will be okay hello jakes hello my friends hello benji hello severe hello hello hello to norway
SPEAKER_01: Aha, Hermes Gasparini. The shoulders are big. Is this the real Hermes Gasparini? Let me check. Go to channel. Yeah, it is the real Hermes Gasparini. Hermes, Hermes. Shoulders are not big. They are small. They are small. I have never been this small. But thank you. I hope you are doing well. I hope you are training. We need you. We miss you.
SPEAKER_01: This is not good. It's not good. Lars time you pulled a right-arm match, if I'm not mistaken, was December 2023. So we are going, like, almost one year. Only left-arm match you pulled against Ali Can. Other than that, I don't remember you pulling a match. Am I wrong? Yeah, we miss you. Not only me, the community miss you. Yeah, hair gains for sure. Hair gains for sure, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: No, I cannot go to US. Guys, I need to get, I needed to get visa, but during the time that I needed to start the visa procedure, I was hospitalized. I had the appendicitis surgery and some other unlucky health issues. Yeah, arm fight. Hello, hello, guys. Yeah. Okay, I was going to ask you,
SPEAKER_01: I don't know why in Oman there is no armwrestling match. But guys, do you guys think that Bart Wood should be the referee? I mean, I'm making everything harder for Devon. He will be 231 and chance will be around 290. And then Devon needs to weigh in. He wanted to weigh in on Wednesday, but he agreed to weigh in.
SPEAKER_01: Thursday evening. And so, let's see. I mean, to be honest, you know, I think they won his favorite. Do I think they will be walking in the park? They will not be. But will he win? He has more chance. But we will see. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think Bart should draft that match, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: yeah that one in the corner of the jody and bart yeah bart is gonna give 20 more horsepower to chance show yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i think okay people are asking me where like
SPEAKER_01: on the night at what order you know the matches will be where Devon versus Chance it will not be main event and we like want Devon to help with either commentating or maybe interview or something but
SPEAKER_01: Like, just because of this, we cannot really make Devon having the first match. So I think most likely, like, the halfway or something, you know, at the middle, so that he can either commentate or just interview those superstars, you know, like himself.
SPEAKER_01: Engin, you are a nightmare for Devon, Brooke says, and I support that. That would be the biggest comedy show ever. Listen, you say Hristo doesn't like Devon? I don't believe so, but for sure, Bart hates Devon, but...
SPEAKER_01: No, no, you are wrong. There are not one or two comments. You don't see them because they are all deleted, and some of them very disrespectful. They are black. That's why you don't see them. Anyway, so let's focus. You're doing great, Shepard. You need to improve your vision and productions. How about Sendai? Yes, you need to. Christo is always fair. Yeah, I agree.
SPEAKER_01: Hello, Mathias. I cannot force. Lars time I didn't. Yeah, I kind of forced it. But last time when I forced him, it was after his victory became the World Heavyweight Champion. So kind of like a one time thing. I don't think I can do the same thing again, especially if I'm not going to Orlando.
SPEAKER_01: Call Hermes, please. I don't know if Hermes wants to be part of the show. I can just stop this one and start again, you know. This one, I cannot invite him. This is not a Zoom one. So... Hello, concrete time. Thank you, my friend. Am I planning to watch it live? Come on, come on. What do you think? Um...
SPEAKER_01: My max back pressure. My friend, I don't believe in those kind of things. I don't believe that just because you do like 40 and the other guy does 42, okay, now 42 is going to win. Trust me, you know, if you really want to know about arm wrestling, arm wrestling is not something like that. Of course, if you are good, yeah, it's good, but it is not there. It's more about the hand, wrist, you know, all together, you know, coordination of the muscle groups, you know.
SPEAKER_01: We miss you when you're on the table. Thank you, Godzilla. I plan to do that. I start training after the surgery, but that's where I had the surgery, that area started to hurt. I even had some hard time to walk, and I said, no, I'm not going to train in August because I don't want to be hospitalized and get cut again, you know? I don't want to do that. That was enough of a pain, you know, that last three weeks.
SPEAKER_01: My weight is about 91, 91, but I'm fat. You know, the arms, shoulders, they're not big, but the belly area, I need to burn fat. For sure, I will be warning the referees about this. Like, this is okay. If this is, they are doing this okay, but when it goes like this, it's a direct foul.
SPEAKER_01: And all the tickets are sold, all the, I mean, except some premium ones. We sold the planned tickets, all of them. And then a lot of people said that we want to, like, we wanted to enter, you know.
SPEAKER_01: And so we just made a different design in the venue. And now we put 50 more. And then the same day, I think in 24 hours, that was sold out as well. But yeah, there are some premium tickets. Thank you, guys. Thank you.
SPEAKER_01: Thank you, Godzilla. Unix, do you have any plans for Nogoshikaze? Yes. Very soon. Very soon. Yeah, Yoshinobi is coming, Victor. He will be incredible, yeah? We don't know about Dennis. Dennis first needs to be ready.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I took the stitches off from myself from here, the surgery area, but the stitches, the metal ones from the head that when I fell down and hit my head, those metal ones, I'm crazy enough to try to take them, but I couldn't and I realized that I would really hurt myself. So I'm a little bit psychopath, but not that much. So I went to hospital and they took it.
SPEAKER_01: Greetings from Missouri. What do you think about Alex Voivodov from right now? I have no idea, my friends. I used to live in Dixon, Missouri, and it was very near to Fort Leonard Wood. Thank you, Arda.
SPEAKER_01: Who is next for LeMans? Soon, we will decide, Kevin, soon. But this event will be incredible, incredible. Like John Brzenk versus Leonidas. Denis Siplenkov said that if Leonidas beats John,
SPEAKER_01: he would like to pull against him. Alex Kurdecha versus Jerry match, incredible match. We will see. We will see how it will on the paper. Everyone says that Alex is favorite, but some people says that stylistically Jerry is dangerous for Alex and the being at home, you know, it's an advantage, some people says.
SPEAKER_01: Ah, you can watch on pay-per-view, Henry. Can I be your coach? Very hard. Yeah, I used to live in Missouri. Also in...
SPEAKER_01: Chicago, also in Long Island. Very short time in Kingston, New Jersey. I think Arsene is going to come back, but I don't exactly know when he will be ready. I cannot speak Spanish. I can say hola, comestas, a few things.
SPEAKER_01: Uh, this is your kindness, Matisse. Lunar, Morozov versus Kamil. Anything is possible, but... Yeah, it is not, Henry. In person is good, you know. Better. Irakli versus Ermes Kasparov is a mismatch.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but even if it was best of seven uniques, it would still be a sweep, you know, on that day. Irakli's next opponent, Chief Ferguson, it is Georgi Tautiev. We will see. We will see if Leonidas is going to win or John win. We will see very soon.
SPEAKER_01: Dennis' next match, there is nothing planned. Will you do another event in the States? We plan every year, at least one of them, but it depends on the conditions. Travis Bergens would like to do it, Travis Bergens. We are talking, maybe we do it in Chicago, maybe.
SPEAKER_01: Hello to Hawaii. Can you speak Italian? Only I can say Bella and Bellissimo, I think. Yeah, it was ... I first time went there in 1996.
SPEAKER_01: genetically more gifted. But I don't know. Can you speak Italian? No. Okay. Where did it go? The chat. You are welcome Juman Games.
SPEAKER_01: We will see. We don't know, my friend. How can I know? They need to train. I don't know what their form will be. I mean, the time needs to come, you know. We don't know. Petromarkin has been winning in the last West vs West event. Who do you think he should face next? We will see that after. I think Lars Vegas is possibly king of the table. We'll organize there.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I'm also curious about Ivan Matushenko versus Devon. Paul Strang, thank you for making all of these great events happen. My friend, just, I mean, trust me, like, the way that I'm trying is just, like, so hard, and...
SPEAKER_01: only because of you guys, that you guys really appreciate and really enjoy. That is the motivation, because I have health problems. I'm 50 years old. I mean, I'm really tired, you know, but, like, that's the way to continue. There is ... Furious is asking, yeah, Devon will be 231 Thursday.
SPEAKER_01: and Chance will probably be 290. And that match is happening only because Devon wants to prove that he can be one of five-kilo category and still can destroy Chance, because when they trained, they were about this weight, you know? And Chance doesn't say that he can beat Devon in his best shape. Chance says that he can beat the light version of Devon, so...
SPEAKER_01: Um, no, I don't have news for Arif or Ferit. I think Arif is injured. Will Leonidas win? Who says this? For B. I guess we will see. Engin, you look very young. I didn't know you were 50. Um, it depends, you know, it depends. After the hair transplant, it start to look good and
SPEAKER_01: Oh, you're right, Denis. Denis Tahirovich, he says, Engin, be careful who you invite in this podcast. We might get another match. Yeah, you're right. But, you know, many, many times, you know, during the podcast, even by phone or just talking, this is not, I don't think this is the first time that I'm said in a match during a live podcast. Can you do a video on exactly how you do top row?
SPEAKER_01: Who says this is fishing, Patrick? Fishing, Patrick, it is, my top roll is not exactly, like, I don't do exactly, like, a moment. It is totally, this is not the moment you do yourself. It's the moment that you apply to your opponent's hand.
SPEAKER_01: So where I am moving is up to where my opponent is moving, because I am doing this application to his hand. So it can be different. If he's pulling, it can be different. If he's coming to me, different. If he's going sideways, it can be different. I mean, this is basically the same thing, but what was the same thing is to activate in all the necessary muscle groups at the same time.
SPEAKER_01: The movement and the activation order, priority may be different from opponent to opponent. So you need some experience. Yeah, Vitaly is getting stronger and stronger. No, I will not go to Orlando.
SPEAKER_01: Vitaly Devon, I don't know. I would say probably Vitaly would be a little bit favorite, but I talk with Devon as well. I don't know. Devon believes that he can beat anyone on this earth except Levan with a very light question mark about Gennady because of his respect to Gennady because he lost against Gennady.
SPEAKER_01: but he thinks that he could beat him. Yeah, interesting. Some people say you don't look 50, and then only two years ago, people were saying I look 70. No, Georgie's leg is fine. Georgie is healed up. He's getting ready. He has a match very soon.
SPEAKER_01: Gary has a match, yeah. No, John Brzenk vs. James English, left arm. I don't know about that, but still, John would be favorite. My weight is 91 kilo, Andrej Volkov. Phil Woody, see you in November 2nd. Yeah, it would be great to see you again, Phil.
SPEAKER_01: Who is the champion on 115? I say still Devon, because I wanted to do a title match for that category. And, you know, Dadikyan versus the winner of the Dadikyan versus Petrenko could go for a title match.
SPEAKER_01: against Michael, but Petrenko doesn't have the Aymeric visa, Dadikan had the visa, but Dadikan got injured, you know, and of course, Dadikan lost the match, so it wouldn't be a title match, so since there is nothing, is Reno Masic gonna compete in 100, oh, sorry, West versus West 15? Yes, I said a match, but I will not announce. Thank you for the explanation, Engin.
SPEAKER_01: Fishing Patriot. Thank you, my friend. Thank you. My health. My health is good. You know, whenever the competition is happening, I have stress. But other than that, right now it's okay. Yeah, I also love the energy Gennady brings to the table. The guy is incredible. The guy is...
SPEAKER_01: not replaceable gennady quick vina is not replaceable if gennady is missing something big missing you know yes yes yes bacho needs a match as well thank you juman games
SPEAKER_01: does blood flow exercises makes me stronger it can make you stronger because of making you healthy because being strong requires to be healthy you may have hormonal power but like if you are injured you are not strong because you can't really apply so just remember being healthy is probably the most important thing
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I need to talk with Gennady very soon. Gennady is ready. Gennady has some shoulder issues. Let's see. Like, very soon, we need to finalize all these things, you know. But the thing is that many athletes, either they bicep tone or health problems, this and that, looks like until the end of this year, all these athletes will come back, and then I think there will be some huge events, you know.
SPEAKER_01: Will Devon compete super heavyweight again? I believe so. I believe yes. I believe yes. Devon, Devon, whatever Devon is doing, trust me, Devon is very smart guy. He knows himself. He pushed himself for like a good one and a half years as a super heavyweight. And he pulled almost everyone, one after another, one after another. So...
SPEAKER_01: He needed to really... Because he was pushing himself to be a heavyweight. He was just like really eating, eating, eating, eating. Like he was pushing himself. So whenever he just stopped doing anything, training, you understand? And then not really push. You know, every time you...
SPEAKER_01: you have a podcast with Devon if he's in the super heavyweight he's just eating all the time eating all the time eating all the time you know so he's I think my my guess Devon is around like 240 maximum 250 245 pound guy you know so whenever he stopped forcing himself to be a super heavyweight and then a little bit rest from the weight lifting so I think
SPEAKER_01: That is naturally he went down to 240. Today he sent me a photo on the scale. He was 239.6, he was. Yeah, there is no 16 matches in German games. There is 17. We just said one more match.
SPEAKER_01: No, Levan will not bet this versus 15. No, Devon cannot make 95 kilo level. Hello, hello to India. I think Ruslan is right now 100%. I think he is 100%.
SPEAKER_01: But I think Paul is also very strong. I really don't know who's going to win that match. I really don't know. David Samusha's next opponent will, if they accept, probably the winner of the Vladimir Mayer and Aydar Khan for a rematch.
SPEAKER_01: I think Zaur is going to compete with MC, I think. Gennady versus Zerano. I think for a first match, Gennady, I think it's hard match, Sam. Because the guy had a bicep tear and Zerano is going there, you know. I think Gennady shouldn't be pulling someone from top 10 first match.
SPEAKER_01: West versus West card is not 100% ready for the November. Oh, you're talking about this event? This is because it's very, very hard, many of the Eastern country players to get visa. That is why... That's why I think that Istanbul is the best place, you know, because right now many players cannot really travel.
SPEAKER_01: Daniel says, I'm excited to support the West in Orlando, but I also enjoy supporting you in England so we can have more great events. Thank you, my friend. Thank you. I really hope that, you know, fans understand this and then fans support us, you know, really. Because I always say this, these events are happening by the...
SPEAKER_01: support of the fans. I consider myself as a bridge between fans and the athletes and the good events. Yeah, Devon versus Gennady will happen. As long as these guys are active, competing, not injured, nothing bad happen in the health, soon already it's gonna happen.
SPEAKER_01: No junior class. In a super, super, I don't know, this elite level, the professional level, I don't think there should be a junior category. I think the juniors, they should be competing. Wow, like 15 years old, 18 years old, 23. They need to really get ready. Tom one.
SPEAKER_01: Engin, tell us about the match between Artem Morozov and Vitaly Laletin. Was Artem not in his best shape? I think Artem was good, but I think Vitaly is different level. And I think Artem pulled in a wrong way, you know. Vitaly is very explosive. Artem is not explosive. You have seen Artem like always catching and beating people. Very seldom he just dominates people, but he needs to be much stronger. Usually he's the catcher. And if you are...
SPEAKER_01: trying to go outside with Vitaly and Vitaly is so good you cannot start like without pressure you need to do all the back pressure because when referee says go Vitaly in a quarter of a second reaches his hundred percent while Morozov can reach maximum 80 percent of his power you know if with a loose grip
SPEAKER_01: But if you start already loading, loading, and then you are already at 100 when there is a possibility that you will stop him, you know. I don't understand how he started like that without loading. If Hermes would start like that against Vitaly, Vitaly would kill Hermes. But Hermes started with all back pressure. Hermes did the same thing against Levan as well.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, 17 matches is the record, yeah. The most matches, yeah. Devon is a professional. He's going to make the match. He's going to make the weight. Yeah, yes. Alex, Vitaly, yes, he's good. He deserves a match with Levan, but we will see, you know. Soon, king of the table.
SPEAKER_01: will decide. Marcus, how is Travis feeling? I don't know. I think he feels good, but after his last match, I think he doesn't like to talk a lot. I think Hermes will be back end of this year, maybe December, maybe January, maybe February, but around that time, he will be back. No, Devon says that he's going to beat any one of five guys. He means right arm.
SPEAKER_01: the health is good my friend thank you for asking my reverse either hand if they accept I want the next event but we will see you feel like Polly will take a shot at title someday yes it is possible not not very soon he just
SPEAKER_01: Kalinichenko would be a good opponent for Kennedy. I'm not sure about that, Andrea.
SPEAKER_01: We will see. Victor, if Michael beats Kamil, will he pull Gennady? That would be a good one. Because Michael just had a bicep surgery and then Gennady had a bicep surgery. And I cannot say that Michael has been pulling a long time. He just pulled a few matches and they were in 115. He's just coming back to super heavyweight. So if he beats Kamil, I think Gennady versus Michael would be good, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah. Alican Murado is... Hello, Armwarrior. Hello, my friend. The after-pull of Esports vs. Esports is gonna be insane. I don't know. There will be a lot of people, but... Vitaly vs. Levan, who wins? After the match is set, we all will find out, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: godzilla we love you and we will support you even in my dying time thank you my friends i wish you a happy healthy and long life also your english improved so much good stuff thank you unix you're doing great job i buy every paper kevin says thank you my friend thank you do you think devon is still strong devon is always strong but i don't think devon
SPEAKER_01: power that he had against Levan. I see a lot of people, oh, are we talking about the Devon that just stopped Levan at the middle? No, that Devon and this Devon are not the same Devon. I'm not saying that, like, Devon cannot be chance, but trust me, it's not the same Devon. Yeah. Thank you. I hope you are doing well for everything. Can't wait for the event. Man, imagine after, well, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: What do you think about Denis versus Kalina? I don't know. I think Denis still needs a bit lighter match until he's ready. Mika, I think that you need to train, like,
SPEAKER_01: as much as you can perform at your best next time. If you train today, you're a riser, and then tomorrow you're training and you can't even do the same way that you did yesterday, then I wouldn't suggest. I would suggest everyone to train their muscle groups again once they are ready to push to max again.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know if Lucia will participate in this first race. She didn't compete in the finals. No, no, I don't think Vitaly can get an Aymeric visa, especially in the current political situation in the world.
SPEAKER_01: time he just started training and Oleg is not the same Oleg I really don't know I may consider uh Dennis versus Leonidas only if Leonidas wins against John yeah Ali Can versus Ivan will be very good match very good match
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I decided, Andre, who Yoshinobu Kanai will pull, but I'm not going to announce it. Yeah, I think, yeah, I think that Dennis should take as much as time that he needs, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I think left arm match of Vitaly. Next match will be Morozov as soon as Morozov is ready. I'm not going to give any match to either of them. Like they will pull against each other. They need to pull. Vitaly long time deserve that shot, yeah. Hermes' next match at the end of this year or beginning of next year, hopefully.
SPEAKER_01: How much does paper cost and where can I buy it? Paper with gem costs $19.99. You can buy from Corey Sports website. Let's see if I can share here. I think I can.
SPEAKER_01: No question, Engin. I just saw I love West versus West and I'm super excited about the event this weekend. Thank you, Brad. Thank you, my friend. Ayane Takenaka after the WAP. After the WAP. Brian, Engin pulls comment sections, whole body with the table in right arm 2024. I really don't know where this started from. This thing, you know. I know that it is.
SPEAKER_01: chance didn't get a chance to pull a prepared devon with a planned match chance get the chance to pull devon in a last moment edition like you guys are sounding like i have taught very good and i made an event and then i said okay
SPEAKER_01: Devon versus Chance. It is not like that. You guys just sometimes extreme, you know. Devon is coming there to help the event and Chance is the host in Florida. So while they are coming there, we said, okay, let's let you guys pull, you know, just why you guys need to make it a big deal. You already have 16 great matches. I don't even know what you're going to lose. You know, like, like I wrote it already.
SPEAKER_01: Like, you guys, some of you sound like, oh, there was Vitaly versus Devon match, and then Vitaly couldn't make it, and I made the replacement with Chance or something. Come on, just get over it, you know? Why you need to hate this match, you know? Like, just enjoy sometimes, you know?
SPEAKER_01: just enjoy the one more match this is not like that you know three months ago i said okay this is the match for the east versus west 14 make it main event you know what do you guys think great match and it's not like that we just had a podcast they still report he said that i can beat you when you are light as i beat you at the practice at the challenger series and devon said no i would smoke you that's only practice and then while they did this i just set the match here so you guys would just enjoy that you are not losing anything
SPEAKER_01: whatever i offer you 16 matches still there you know i mean no need to make such a drama i don't know if valera is coming back thank you george thank you
SPEAKER_01: Thank you, Samuel Safarian. Thank you. I don't know if Oleg can beat Cerkasov right now, but I'm not able to. I'm not allowed to invite Cerkasov because he's banned for, I think, three years or four years or... Great respect to sports legend. Thank you, Georgi.
SPEAKER_01: No, no, Arsene will be back, hopefully. Arsene Lillet will be back, but he had to go to different city to do work, and he couldn't train. Oh, okay, Andrei Volkov. Thank you for explanation. Thank you, nearby.
SPEAKER_01: Engin, the gold matchmaker. I do my best. Sometimes it is not good, but I do my best, yeah. Hello, Justin. Hello. Artem you ready, Justin? Artem you ready? You have a very serious opponent, but you are also a very serious opponent. Does Chance become number two in the world if he wins? No. This match has nothing to do with the ranking, nothing at all, you know. This match is just different.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, Brad Butler. You get it, yes. The Devon match with Chainsaw, to me, is like something that we will gauge, we will understand where Devon is when he is 105. I will tell you what, if Devon is 105 and if he just stonewalls Chainsaw, you understand? Then...
SPEAKER_01: If Devon doesn't matter, even if it is round one, if Devon has, you know, like there's something with Chance, then I think that he may be in trouble against Petrenko. This is my opinion. Take care of yourself, Justin. Thank you. Thank you. And I won't be there, but I'm sure that you guys will rock.
SPEAKER_01: Hudson. Dave Chaffee is pulling against Frank Lampirelli. Do I think Brian Shaw will be months in superweight category? There is a possibility, but you need to pay the price. Thank you, Eunice.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, you are saying, hello, Angel. Ali Can hasn't lost any match if he beats Ivan. Why wouldn't he give him to face Vitaly for number one contenders? Well, no, first, let Laetitian and Morozov pull, and then later, Ali Can can pull either the winner or the losing guy, just to see.
SPEAKER_01: JB says, if you go to McDonald's and they give you all the food you order, but plus extra order of fries for free, do you complain? This is not the fries. They give you some, like, another nice hamburger. But you are right. I know what you mean. How many times have I become world champion? At WAF, senior category, 11 times. But I have some professional world titles as well.
SPEAKER_01: Who is pulling the Japanese guy at West versus West 15? We didn't announce it. Yeah, everything is okay, Justin. And let's rock. Let's entertain the arm wrestling community this weekend. Hello, Jiggy, all day. Your name is, huh?
SPEAKER_01: Do you really think that the Turkey, Turkey and new guy 70 kilo champion, that's not the new guy 70 kilo, the guy is pulling in, he won the qualification in 75, he will be pulling in 77 new category. Will we see Jerry at any West versus West in the future? You're going to see him this Saturday against Alex Kurdecha. I'm sure you are ready, Justin. I'm sure you are ready.
SPEAKER_01: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. RD Ford. Yeah. Thank you for your support. No, no, no, no. There is nobody at the 105 category who can beat Devon easily, except maybe Ali Can with left arm. Right arm, I don't think that Devon is underdog against anyone. I think Devon is favorite against anyone at 105 and 115.
SPEAKER_01: Ermes was removed from the left arm rankings because he told me that he will never pull left arm again. Weight is on point and feeling strong. Justin say go, Justin Bishop says. Wow. It will be incredible. Wow. I wish I was there in that atmosphere. I have competed in U.S. So many events, so many events. I have competed tournaments in U.S.
SPEAKER_01: more than all other competitions outside of U.S. And it was fun because the audience, like spectators in U.S. events, they know how to entertain themselves and make the event entertaining, you know. They are loud, you know. They are just like, they are not shy, you know. And so I would be good.
SPEAKER_01: People just talk bullshit, my friend. Share, you know, just people are just, they don't know what they are talking about.
SPEAKER_01: Georgi, today the engine does a great job. We love and appreciate your work, hard work. Greetings from the Georgian Wrestling Federation. Georgians love Engin Terzi. I love my Georgian friends, too. I have been friends with my Georgian fellow arm wrestlers for 30 years, since 1994, Sweden, where I won my first world title.
SPEAKER_01: Engin, how are you, my friend? Lone Ranger. I'm fine, my friend. How are you? No, Jim, not $90.99. It's like $19.99. $19.19.99.
SPEAKER_01: I don't think that there will be a Paralympics in 2025. There is, I think, in the Asian Youth Paralympics or something.
SPEAKER_01: Trust me, guys, those 17 matches, I'm saying objectively, maybe for some countries it may be, like, not affordable, but for the countries that, you know, mostly at the west side, it's just $19.99, I don't think it is too much. Justin look at the cards, look at the cards, who are there in the cards. But, of course, you guys decide, you know.
SPEAKER_01: Why I will not be there? It is because I need visa and the visa procedure for US is long. And then during the time that I had to start the procedure, I was hospitalized as people knows that I had the appendicit surgery and some other unlucky health problems. Yeah, Justin, I will miss you guys too.
SPEAKER_01: okay guys so olaf torpe thank you did you really say that because yeah you misunderstood and many people already said to told you it's 1999. 1999 yeah okay and
SPEAKER_01: Okay, let's see if there is some interesting question. Yeah, 70 is the most matches, yeah. We had 16, I think, twice before. I think the West versus West 2 also had 16. Like, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I think one time we were in the European Championships in Bulgaria. I took first, I think it was third or fourth. And then I think one time in Kazakhstan World Championships.
SPEAKER_01: It's a long story, but basically he won there once. I beat him also once. So we both beat each other there once. But I had a very bad draw, you know. Somehow all the Russians and other people, top guys, were just... one after another. I don't know what kind of... I won the European same year in Antalya. Um...
SPEAKER_01: Morozov versus this, I don't know, maybe a good match, but I don't want to put two countrymen unless it is a title match or a match to qualify them for the title. I don't know how it would happen, Alex and Hermes. But I know one thing, that they both think that they can win. Alex thinks that he can beat Hermes, and Hermes thinks that he can beat Alex.
SPEAKER_01: A high-engine duty, Iraq can be the next world champion. Iraq is already world champion in 95 kilo. What do you think is the strongest armors in school right now? I don't know. Georgia, Kazakhstan, some other.
SPEAKER_01: okay guys my god a very good form right now what do you think would be a good machine right now iraq versus oleg petrenko iraq versus oleg petrenko i cannot say this when oleg is the world champion and iraq lost three matches in that category against dadikyan ongarbev and dadikyan ongarbev and tatachinks
SPEAKER_01: he needs to pull other guys i'm not saying he cannot beat petrenko or he can beat petrenko but thank you daniel thank you daniel andreas thank you my friends um i think i'm planning to put
SPEAKER_01: Devon versus Shane's match, like, not the last match, not the first match, it's somewhere at the middle, you know? Maybe, maybe before Michael Jordan coming much, maybe?
SPEAKER_01: There is no clickbait matches. If you look at the West versus West, and you are looking, if you are thinking there is WWE matches, then probably you don't know about arm wrestling. There is nothing more real than West versus West. You just see 200 matches at this level that there is nothing even close.
SPEAKER_01: And then just because of a last-minute match, now you are trying to label West versus West. You to mention even WWE is a disrespect. And you say, oh, no disrespect. I mean, come on, man. Come on. Is it fair to, like, should I tell you the matches that I have been set in?
SPEAKER_01: And just because you forget all of this, and then you just show me one match, and you are saying, oh, I don't want RMSW. You guys are extreme. You're extreme at this level. You are extreme. Justin come on, man. You guys are looking just like this, and then you see 200 positive things, and you think that there is one thing negative, and you highlight that one. Highlight, highlight, highlight. Like all those 200 you see like this, and then the one that you see problem, you just make it bigger, bigger. You're blowing like...
SPEAKER_00: Come on, man. Come on. Anyways, guys.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, exactly, Unix, exactly. If I walk on the sea, they will just say he cannot swim, you know. That is exactly what they will say, but it's okay, you know. Rustam versus Pauline is a very close match.
SPEAKER_01: I will tell you something that if you are pulling against Pauline,
SPEAKER_01: You should be scared about what is here more than what's here for Pauline. This is very scary. But the willpower of Pauline is more scary, you know. I'm not saying he's going to win. I'm not going to say he's going to lose. But Pauline is a very serious opponent. Why do I talk about Pauline but not Rustam? Rustam already proven. I don't think there is anything to say about Rustam. I don't think...
SPEAKER_01: If Ruslan is at his best, he's incredible. But what I'm just saying that Pauline is someone that you cannot take lightly. You know, Pauline is dangerous, dangerous guy. And even the worst part as an opponent is that the guy just smiles and he's so relaxed and everything. Well, like, that is very... Because, like, you can't really...
SPEAKER_01: You can't really make yourself like this against a guy like that. And then when you come to the table, then you suddenly see someone who is not that nice anymore. And I'm not saying he's not a fair player or something, but the guy is just coming there as a mission. I don't know.
SPEAKER_01: Hello, Ryan Ballinger. I tell to, I tell to Rymus, you will beat him, and he doesn't believe. He says, how do you want me to beat him? Do you want me to top roll him? Do you want me to do this? He doesn't know what's gonna happen to him. What makes Samusha so dominating?
SPEAKER_01: There is no one thing. He is, how to say, he is mentally very strong, he is spiritually very strong, his genetic is very good, and he knows how to arm wrestle, many things. Thank you, Efren. Thank you for bringing the arm wrestling community together during COVID-19. Thank you, my friend. Thank you.
SPEAKER_01: maksum who is next opponent for sago i know already but i'm not gonna say it yeah pauline is a class act you know the guy is just yeah super professional and his personality is just like makes him like well respected you know
SPEAKER_01: Ryan Ballinger, I will remind him everything he has said right when we get to the table. Yes, Ryan, do that. You know, Raimonds is a representative of West versus West, so that is why I can talk because we are good friends, you know, but, like,
SPEAKER_01: You are favorites. I'm sure you are about 220. You're going to make 209. Competition time again will be 220. I saw your videos and you are strong. You are strong. If it was the same weight, I would give the edge to Raimonds. But this time, I will be surprised. Maybe not surprised, but I think that 55-45 for you.
SPEAKER_01: You're talking about world's strongest man? You mean Brian Shaw? Do you think Alican Murado will ever compete at super heavyweight? He already competed, Erlich. He pulled against Cody. He pulled against Hermes. These are super heavyweight category. Aleyküm selam, the enlightened one.
SPEAKER_01: Morozov will have a match, Tony, but we don't know exactly when. This year is one of the best for arm wrestling, isn't it, Engin? Yes, it is. Yeah, West versus West 15 will be awesome. My friend, like, whenever I do the event, trust me, I first make the best event possible, and then I calculate the expenses. And...
SPEAKER_01: did you do but that that is so just you can be sure that i always do my best to provide you guys the best event possible um harsh i think that prudnik will be in a better shape over there and you know i have an idea about the merch more merchandise t-shirts with one puller and more example t-shirt designer with his picture

If you want to secure an invitation to West versus West, qualification event is there. You are not going to get invited, like, from the live podcast comment section, you know.
SPEAKER_01: Enlightened One, please pay a visit to Pakistan. We got some young and heavy arm masters too. I'm sure, I'm sure, Enlightened One. Hello to Pakistani brothers.

SPEAKER_01: I'm a bridge between the fans and the great events and the athletes. So as long as you guys want me to remain as this bridge, I will do my best. Unless I have very, very, very serious health problems that I can't really do this anymore, then I have to apologize. Or if I cannot financially continue, then I will have to. But as long as you guys support, I feel this as a duty to myself.
SPEAKER_01: really enjoy I really enjoy going to front of those boards and with markers to write the names and the do the matchups and yeah because I I see I see I I share the the how to say the passion of the
SPEAKER_01: fans and i also have competed near 30 years as an athlete and i know what the athletes feel i also feel myself responsible to them that you know i know that they are all waiting for a match and so i i do my best so if you guys think i'm the right person continue supporting me if you think i'm wrong person it's totally up to you you all take care of yourself
