SPEAKER_00: Oh, can you guys hear me? Yep. Yeah. Great event coming. Oh, can you guys hear me now? Yeah, yeah, we can hear you. We can hear you. Okay, okay. Maybe I...
SPEAKER_01: Maybe I change where I'm sitting, but I think I'm okay, yeah? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Ray, how you doing? Artem you all ready to compete? Yeah, yeah, very excited. Super, super awesome. Ryan Belanger is going to kill him. Yeah, probably. I mean... Most likely. This is the most likely option. Most likely option. I think so. And, Engen, you're...
SPEAKER_04: you're not you're not able to make it they don't let you into the united states i didn't even apply oh because i was i was i had surgery i was hospitalized during the time that i i i was i should be running after visa yeah yeah you know the states still haven't forgotten about the time you lived there and dominated arm wrestling scene so they're not going to let you in you know yeah i'm pretty sure i'm going to give you a visit yeah
SPEAKER_01: yeah i'm super excited we we got our tickets i'm we are coming with jody with auden with abry um no milo milo can't make it but um we're also bringing i now have big announcement i now have a camera guy oh yeah is it camera or is it you he's just calling your camera
SPEAKER_01: super professional super like so you might know him so he lives it's a bit of a long story but um his name's sunny he's arm wrestling from scotland he lives next door to us with milo he lives with milo anyways super talented kid and just the opportunity came up and uh yeah he's gonna he's gonna help us out and i'm still gonna do my normal stuff but for bigger things like um
SPEAKER_01: you know, like this, he's going to come and help me. Nice. Nice. Yeah. You guys are going to have to excuse me. I'm going to probably eat this. Devon't get weird. Somehow we all are hungry. We've got to stay hydrated in this 105 category. Devon, if you have a camera guy now,
SPEAKER_04: since you can't be a homeless man anymore, so you need to also shave. Yeah, you can't be like homeless looking and have a camera guy because you either need to be so messy and then do your camera things, natural everything, or yeah, that really looks good. Yeah, I changed my mind about the crusty, the clown thing. I'm going to be a hybrid. I'm going to be the first
SPEAKER_04: Homeless man with the camera crew. Oh, first homeless man with the camera crew. Yeah, that makes sense. First homeless guy ever. Groundbreaking. Groundbreaking. Oh, Chance Shaw. Chance Shaw is here. Hey, buddy. How's it going, guys? So, Chance, you're running this thing, right? Artem you the man in the absence here? I'm assisting. I'm doing whatever Ingen asks of me.
SPEAKER_04: no he is he's the he's the host right now he's the he's the guy he's the man so what's going on what what do i have to do down there am i going to be like you're going to do the same thing you do in istanbul because your friend i have been your friend for 22 years can't make the event so one last time you're going to replace him
SPEAKER_04: And my honor. Yeah, also my honor. Yeah, thank you. And Chen Zhou is the guy, you know, and Raimonds is, you know, it's our face, especially on social media. He has a match. I really hope that his defeat will not affect the job. What do you think about Ryan Ballinger versus Raimonds?
SPEAKER_02: I think Ryan is super strong. He's got a lot of big wins. He trains with a great team. He trains with Adam Orzenski and Hunter Knopf and all those guys. But going into it, he has to be the underdog. Coach Ray just has so much more experience on wrestling and on the big stage. So I would favor Ray, but I wouldn't count Ryan out of it. Okay. Go ahead, Dylan. Ray. Ray.
SPEAKER_01: Odin got the same haircut as you now. Oh. He looks just like you. I saw him getting that haircut, yeah. Same haircut as you. Yeah, he's just much taller and bigger. Yeah, a little bit. Yeah, he's getting bigger. Same baby face. Yeah, looks about the same age.
SPEAKER_04: um so are all the athletes going to be there come Wednesday night or what's what's the schedule look like I think I think some Wednesday I don't know if anyone is coming Tuesday but mostly Thursday I think yeah I need to look at the the list yeah Devon listen uh will you help me you will not have to do all but the interviews like we did last time maybe the main event and things like that
SPEAKER_02: I'm going to put in and get all the guys together. We're going to do about 8, 10 minutes with everyone. So it's 16 pairs. It's going to take a lot of time. And we have just one day to do it, you know. So we'll see. Thursday and Friday? Or we can start Wednesday night? When I arrive, 11.30. Listen, Ray, don't worry. I have a camera guy. Okay. Professional.
SPEAKER_01: we can be we can even be working two different streams we should coordinate make sure we click off everybody but yeah yeah yeah let's okay let's figure it out let's let's yeah yeah yeah perfect perfect yeah yeah you're the you're the man you're the man so yeah you also are the man right you also are the man it's fine it's fine see how massive i'm getting again you you look you look tiny
SPEAKER_01: Look how huge I am. That 105 kilo class is fucking dead meat. Dead meat. But I need a little bit of time still. A little bit of time. I think this is the first time in my life... Listen, eating cucumbers will not make you strong. I'm pretty sure of that. No. These are things that I have yet to teach you, Ray. Okay?
SPEAKER_01: when everybody you watch i'm telling you people drink water okay people drink water they're down here you eat they're down here right yeah i eat cucumbers all day long far superior far superior people talk about gatorade sports aid whatever mineral complex you want to talk about
SPEAKER_04: Come on, man. You don't do it. You bring back this. What are you talking about? This is straight. This is straight. Yeah, yeah. You can just say that your forearm got so much stored. You guys train hard? Everybody train hard? Not me because I started training and then my surgery area started to hurt seriously. I couldn't even walk and then I said, better wait another month. I heard that I need to...
SPEAKER_04: train with four kilos I started already a little bit heavy a little lighter yeah but but I just can't wait to come back here I need to fix this neck neck as well and I I'm just gonna I I can't wait anymore yeah I'm 50. and and what was your weight chance uh you look that you gain you look like you gained the weight back you know
SPEAKER_02: i have not weighed myself since i stepped on the scale in istanbul so i have no clue i mean and then i've been eating food non-stop and you're right you you you're gonna pull 95 kilo category match i heard that your opponent is going down from 100
SPEAKER_02: And you will be 100 on the competition day. And you will be 90 kilos. And he will smoke you. Maximum. Maximum. Fully bloated. Full of gluten maybe. But I'm 87 in the morning. 86. Depends on what I eat. If not, I eat just two ice creams just for this live stream. So we'll see. Okay. Jared is asking. Big fan, guys. Devon. Devon. When is Devon versus Vitaly? He's asking you. Love.
SPEAKER_01: It would have been about a month and a bit ago, but Devon Idris had to stop it. I was gonna, I was on the verge of cracking that guy's wrist back. You had it. You give me, you had to give me five more seconds and Vitaly was done. You're talking about the, the, the, on the match at the five more seconds, five more seconds. And it was over. It was over. Everybody, everybody would have been gone from, oh, Devon's a week old man too.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, Devon is still super, super strong. Five seconds. That's the difference. That's the difference. Imagine you were five seconds late. Oh, must hurt. Oh, no, I'm fine with it because I know. I know. I know exactly what I felt and so does Vitaly. He knows. He knows what's up. Yeah. I don't even know if I want that match anymore. It's just, it's probably pretty easy. Like...
SPEAKER_01: chance what is this guy talking about he can't i think he's crazy about bdvd we got it i think that's crazy you see what i'm working with let me see what i'm working with you see that it's a pure quality you know at 2 30 i think i think ray might be beating you don't be don't be ridiculous
SPEAKER_02: don't be ridiculous guys listen listen this would be like you talking about Vitaly would be same as I would be talking about thing and I would say listen if we would pull few more I felt like I was cracking him I felt like I could be yeah yeah like seven more rounds I I felt like I felt I felt it yeah that's an interesting comparison that's an interesting comparison but but the same time but at the same time you see you Ray
SPEAKER_01: You see, I understand the comparison between England and Vitaly. I get that. But Ray, I am so much meaner than you. I'm so much meaner. You know, like you are a nice guy trying to crack. No, no, no, no, no, no. I think you gave him all the tactics and all the things to make the things, you know, cows, you know, and he ate that mess, you know.
SPEAKER_04: He did everything. And people were like, oh, Engin starts early. I made a slow motion just to make sure that he started before the goal. You, you, okay. He was like this mean with your suggestions, probably because you want me to lose. He became like this mean. I really like you, Ray. You're one of my favorite people. I know, I know, I know. But I'm going to tell you, I'm going to tell you, Engin, it's kind of like I was coaching a golden
SPEAKER_01: retriever you know those you know those golden retriever dogs yeah beautiful dog that's the type of dog i am person golden retriever golden retriever okay like beautiful dog great dog okay but you tell a golden you tell a golden retriever to go and kill something it's gonna it's gonna go but not really
SPEAKER_04: well listen listen listen the golden whatever has killed so many others but but you send him to the wolf that that is the problem you're looking at a belgian malwa here belgian malwa okay
SPEAKER_02: You ever been in a room at the Belgian Malwa? Did you take this dog out a few months ago? Yeah, yeah, yeah, I did actually. I'm one of the few people that's felt Devon at 2.30, actually. Not too impressive. Listen, the real question is how many seconds did you need for chance to see what's up?
SPEAKER_01: yeah I I think it was like 12 pins in a row just yeah you felt my you felt my charity that's what you felt you felt my charity you felt you felt my slow burning candles okay your face was like that oh stop it stop it listen listen are we suggesting something here that chance do you really think you could have beat me
SPEAKER_02: I think I stand no chance against the Devon that pulled LaVon, right? I'm not delusional. Of course. But the 230, Devon? But the 230, Devon? It's the same guy. That's an easy day. That's like a reverse. It's the same guy. Let's reverse. It's the same guy. Come on, come on. It's the same guy. I downloaded the video. I downloaded the video. Did you guys see the video?
SPEAKER_01: which one what video okay but somebody somebody just made it um this video one second um I felt like I was being such a friendly guy that weekend I think I laid my arms down about everybody I was being friendly as well that's the thing I'll let you work a little bit oh my God I'm like a legend like Devon this is embarrassing
SPEAKER_04: just saying i think you need to put on some weight okay okay i downloaded the video you want you're ready to watch the beginning the beginning is from the podcast that we did before the challenger series and then how are you going to do that oh
SPEAKER_01: oh god listen i don't have to eat ever again in my life and my willpower alone will enchant shots
SPEAKER_04: That's abuse right there. That is abuse. That is. Enemy of the sport, Chanchal. Man. That's good. That's good. Come on. If I would listen, the Devon that we know would kill Chanchal. 2.30, I think 2.30, Devon and Petrenko, I think Petrenko is going to kill you.
SPEAKER_04: And that is why you, I mean, talking about that thing a lot, you know, lately. Chance, can I tell you something, Chance? Yeah. You pull Petrenko. Yep. And you pull Devon when he's 2-2. Of course, it's just training. But, like, how would you compare them? I would pick from what I felt. And I think Petrenko's gotten better. I don't know how much Devon settled into his weight, but I'd pick Petrenko maybe like 85-15.
SPEAKER_01: Hold on, hold on. Did you pull Petrenko? Did you pull him? Yeah, yeah. Oh, that's right. I remember. He dusted you, right? Hey, actually, I got a round on him. You did get a round, didn't you? He did better than the last champion against him. The last two champions against him. Well, listen, maybe I need to tell you guys what's up, okay? I am probably the strongest human being you've ever met. Okay, I'm just going to tell you now.
SPEAKER_01: Before we even start the conversation, there was a time when I stopped eating completely. Okay. Stopped eating. Okay. The first time in my life I have ever developed a smoker's cough. Okay. And, and listen, I'm having so much fun, but even in this state, like yesterday I pulled like for like,
SPEAKER_01: three hours the day before that I pulled for like five hours even in this broken down beat up state if you were to put Petranco on the stage with me in one week I would beat him no way zero percent no one week I would defeat Petranco listen listen yeah listen yeah listen
SPEAKER_04: uh you were you were you were you said that at 2 36 you said even your real power would be chance and that was only two three days before you train with chance and chance without the wrong break breaks that no resting he was just pinning you he was not listen this is how that went this is exactly how that went let me let me clear the air okay
SPEAKER_01: I go, I humbly come into West versus West as an assistant, as an aid. And I come and I see Chance. And I know that he's competing against Ibrahim Sagov. And I'm like, this guy is strong. Ibrahim Sagov is strong. And I, the last thing I would want to do is put a single tweak onto Chance's arm.
SPEAKER_01: how nice of you nevin the charitable really nice i am so charitable i'm so charitable i am i am a saint of goodness okay and i and i give to chance i give to chance what he needs to best set him up to do his 100 in that match for one second i couldn't take chance shah
SPEAKER_04: grab him by the elbow and never do you know what 235 40 pounds no chance do you know what what what deja vu is deja vu what what i'm sorry no oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you know what happened the next day after devon pulled levan in istanbul he told me the same exact story he's such a good guy and he wanted levan to feel good yeah
SPEAKER_01: that makes sense steven is really just a nice guy he's known for being the nicest guy him and travis super nice guys yeah yeah okay you know i will tell you something there's two big things i'm being compared to travis bajan in terms of my niceness and they got ray engen and chance on here and somehow these guys are talking like i can't even say the words i can't even say they are they are somehow insinuating
SPEAKER_04: That from all my glory, now the discussion that we're having is that I might not even be good enough to beat Chance Shaw. Is this even possible? You beat Chance Shaw, normally, if you weigh in 231, you're not beating this guy. If Chance is not dieting, he is really like 135, something like right now it looks like. And you are...
SPEAKER_04: That's not allowed. Anyways, so you're 231. Chance is beating you. You're 253. You're beating Chance. 231, I think there are like, I mean, I saw with my own eyes that you didn't give him a favor or something. He was actually pinning. You want to watch again? He doesn't have a chance. I agree. Devon doesn't have a chance. I agree. Clearly what I was saying.
SPEAKER_01: I kind of think that Jody is trying to pull us to the trap or something. I'm trying to pull you into a trap. That's me doing that. I see how this is going. This is so quickly deteriorating. Why does it always deteriorate? I come on here and we're talking about the event. We're planning our podcast and I feel like I'm being attacked. I feel like I'm being attacked. I feel like
SPEAKER_01: nice I just like I almost I don't want to say this too loud but just for a secret for you guys I I almost beat Devon just not too long ago I mean really like that wasn't 231. I know but whatever whatever you could take that guy and he could weigh 180 pounds
SPEAKER_04: And I'm still going to mess people up. Crazy. I don't know. That's not what we saw. I just saw. I just watched it. But maybe, maybe I'm mistaken about that subject. And maybe, I don't know. I have no idea. But my life is very simple. Listen, how long are you going to not arm wrestle? That's the real question, right? Longer you not arm wrestle. Hey, Ray. Artem wrestle this morning.
SPEAKER_01: yeah you know what i mean i know yesterday for about three hours of course so it would be here right now so it means that oh god listen okay okay okay hold on hold on before you've seen this before
SPEAKER_01: not looking at the comments right now i'm not on youtube i'm going to go over and then i'm going to load up my little computer here so i can look at the comments but what i want to do is i want to start a poll right now and start a poll right now okay and look it and i'm going to tell you that
SPEAKER_01: 95 of the people out there if polled will tell you that I will completely murder chance shot that's what they will tell you right at 105 kilos listen listen listen you have one one one million subscribers of course this is what we'll have I don't know we're gonna do it on your channel right on this live feed right now set up a poll yeah but people who are watching right now your fans they are watching because of you
SPEAKER_01: No, no, no, no. Engin Terzi's channel is the most unbiased group of arm wrestling fans that you've ever seen, okay? Okay. Listen, all I want to see is Chance Shaw pull Devon's whole body with the table in 2024. But I will tell you something, Devon. Seriously. I want to set you versus Pat Sankovic. I don't want...
SPEAKER_04: Like, you are very important. You understand? You are very important. Bring him to Orlando. You losing to Levan is something. You understand? That acceptable 180-kilo guy. But how are we going to accept? I mean, make people, like, accept that you losing to Petrenko at 105. And then, so, I don't want to set this match. Maybe you go for 115. Because at 105, as I said in the video, even chance would beat you. So, seriously. Let me tell you.
SPEAKER_01: Nobody is beating me at 105, Engen. You're going to have to create somebody in a lab, okay, from birth, okay, starting now, with no legs and only one arm, okay? Then maybe, maybe, okay? You're going to have to have Oleg Zok. He's going to make a baby with Barbora, and they're going to put him on a special diet, and maybe, maybe. Listen, listen. What was the, like, Tata things?
SPEAKER_01: Without you doing this, Todd Hutchings was beating you if you were not allowed. Todd Hutchings is not even, you can't say Todd Hutchings' name and mine next to each other. You can't even say the names in the same sentence. Todd Hutchings, as smart as he is, he doesn't know how to arm wrestle. He doesn't. He doesn't know how to arm wrestle. He doesn't even know that the buckle's an advantage or a disadvantage.
SPEAKER_04: But first of all, round one, he beat you. Listen, are you questioning the referees? Artem you questioning the integrity of the World Armwrestling League? Isn't Bart reffing at the West versus West? Listen, it was the side referee side, not the head referee side. Come on. It was the side referee side, not the Bart side.
SPEAKER_04: This is amazing. Oh, so you're blaming a woman? I'm not blaming. There can be mistakes. There was a maybe mistake. You versus Gennady match as well. What you say as well. So a mistake can happen. But listen, as far as I'm concerned, every single match that I'm ever in, the referees make a mistake. Listen, he pinned you. And then they kept the match going like 30, 40 seconds, the guys like this. And then they exhausted. He could beat you three times in a row the same way.
SPEAKER_04: But Tatachin's loss to Dadikyan and Petrenko beat Dadikyan convincingly. And then when you make 231, Chance kind of, you know, this. So, but I'm just saying that I think that, forget about Petrenko, I think Chance would beat you. I said this before the challenge, Rebekah, and you said that even your, what was it, power of your willpower would beat him. That's all I need. That's all I need. That's all I need is just my willpower.
SPEAKER_04: How about this? I'm looking right now, so I have my computer up. See? I can see the comments. Why don't you put up a poll? So start poll. Start poll. I don't want to make you look bad, you know, because the people who really know the truth are the silent one. Can't see. Listen, how can you win a poll against Devon
SPEAKER_01: when he has 1 million subscribers you know these are educated people you have on your these are the arm wrestling experts you got i'm seeing 552 people this is not a million people this is 552 of the most hardcore arm wrestling fans we got yeah this guy had them if i am annoying watch another channel or you just enjoy what you are watching before i block you
SPEAKER_04: Block that guy, Engin. Block him. I will just give you one more. There are some superchats that we missed. I don't want them to be upset. Skyler Brooks says... Wait, wait. Can't wait for this event, guys. This is going to be so awesome. Super interested to see what an event in the States looks like. Hopefully a big turnout. My friend, I used to live in the US six years. The excitement even at a state tournament is
SPEAKER_04: like very very high level this one will be incredible incredible like like you will never forget like the best event have you guys like Rymus have you ever seen an event that is more
SPEAKER_04: I don't know, exciting than the atmosphere in the Levan versus Devon match. Do you remember the match? I haven't seen a North Aymeric event like this. I said, like, the only thing that this card is missing is Devon Laird pulling on the card. But everything else, but he's going to be there anyway. Bring Petrenko. Bring Petrenko. Petrenko, first of all, needs time to get Vista. Forget about Petrenko. Chance would beat you. Anyways.
SPEAKER_04: Todd and Oleg love child. Engin, you will be missed in Orlando. We love you. Thank you. Thank you, my brother. And I think one more. One more, one more, one more, one more. And yeah, David Holmes. Hold on. One second, last one. Devon will dominate in the 105 category easily, David says. Okay, okay. So what's your weight? Okay, go ahead.
SPEAKER_01: yeah my weight right now probably 240 240 this morning yeah but i i'm just curious really because i could just i like to put myself in people's positions i like to i like to see what it's like to feel like a different person i mean chance do you see what engen's trying to do here
SPEAKER_02: Chance, Chance agrees with me many times on the phone. He was telling me how many times he smashed you to the bed. Yeah, I mean, like I said, I don't think that I can beat the super heavy weight version of you, the peaked version of you. But the 235 version of you, I was not very impressed with. This is my honest opinion. I'm 240 right now. Like today. Today. I'm 240.
SPEAKER_01: i'm telling you if you would make 231 if you would make 231 he would beat you hey i'm 260 bro though are you not beating me anyway anyhow no way nowhere i'm telling you chance i'm coming i'm coming it's your event like do you want me to mess your event up yeah why don't why don't you just fast get to 105 and then weigh in at 105 and i'll smash you
SPEAKER_04: Oh, my God. Listen, I didn't say 240 Devon. I said 231 Devon. He can make 31. Come on. We all know that. Yeah, but whenever he makes it, his problem is that he thinks that 270, 75 Devon and 231 Devon will be the same. So what I'm just saying is, yes, he's too strong, but the 15% or something,
SPEAKER_04: And especially now, he can't because he will be ready for Petrenko match, but right now is the last moment thing, you know? Listen, I'm ready today for Petrenko. Today. Do you want me to ask Petrenko? I don't really know if he has the visa or not. I will beat anybody in the 105 kilo class you want me to beat. Anybody. Anybody. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: It really doesn't matter. I feel like it's really like they're all fucked. I know who they all are. You telling me, you telling me I can't crack it. You told me I can't crack chance. So you're telling me is that I don't know. You want me to you want me to play the video again?
SPEAKER_01: Look, if you can't see charity, if you can't see charity when it's right in front of you. That part is bullshit. Come on, just say that I didn't eat for some days. You know what? You can go on any arm wrestling channel. You can go on any arm wrestling channel that's out there where I'm practice pulling and you will witness my charity. It's everywhere.
SPEAKER_01: You can see me pulling all over the world. And if somebody wants to pin me, normally they'll pin me. Normally they'll pin me. You want to hang out with me? You want to live with me? You want to stay with me? You won't be able to. You won't be able to. But if you want to pin me, normally in practice, I'll let you have the pin. I'll let you have it. But when they say, ready, go at competition, there's not so many. There's not so many things where I haven't been abused by the referees or the system where I lose.
SPEAKER_01: There's not many. Listen, you were really, really pushing yourself one more time, one more time until you exhausted him. Still, he wasn't exhausted, you know. I'm trying to gauge the level. I'm trying to gauge that level. I'm trying to bring the guy. The level's too high for you to gauge, Devon. I'm bringing that guy to maximal capacity. Note, when you watch closely that video, the wrist is bending back and I'm easing off. I'm easing off.
SPEAKER_01: You see my body. It's not moving. Dave you ever seen a guy in a match where one guy's body's moving and the other isn't? It's because he's holding. It's because he's holding. I think your body was moving. It was going like this. Somebody is being serious as of now.
SPEAKER_04: How about just that the damn matchup already, Chance Shaw versus Devon 105. The only problem is that Chance is not even training after his last match and Devon already started training. I don't know, but still, I believe that at 231, not 240, 231 you make, even next week, I think that he would beat you. But this is just my opinion, you know.
SPEAKER_01: Put up a poll, Langen. Put up a poll. I can't put up a poll. It's not my channel. Put up a poll. You watch. You watch the people of arm wrestling. It'll be 98%. People will be like, the only people who will pick Chance Shaw is the people in some way have either robbed or done wrong to, you know? Like, no one else is going to vote against me. Nobody. And Chance Shaw, buddy, buddy, you need to, you should go after Ray, not me.
SPEAKER_04: Ray will give you a better map. You need to understand, Devon. Devon, you need to understand. Seriously, you are our superstar, and you are our face. You understand? You are our face to do outside of our nothing world. If you lose, you understand? Some lighter guys. When you lose Levan, we can explain to people that, okay, Levan was so heavy and this and that. But if you lose at 105, someone like Petrenko,
SPEAKER_04: and something like maybe you go to the super heavyweight and then we can really justify you understand your like if you lose against someone like we tell or something but if but seriously i'm saying as a friend you know like maybe i shouldn't say it on the live podcast but just we i'm trying to protect your image you understand so what i'm just saying seriously just don't be even think about pulling chance when you are this light you understand petrenko we will see
SPEAKER_01: You're so funny, Engen. You're so funny because I know you don't believe a word you're saying. You don't believe a word that is coming out of your mouth right now.
SPEAKER_04: listen don't don't don't stop this okay don't don't be stopping this and and because just less because this happened two three days before you train with chance one more time for other people who didn't see this happened two three days i saw this on the internet and download it it's very funny only two three days before the challenger series this this conversation happened in a podcast
SPEAKER_01: This is what you need to see right here. This is what you need to see right here. You see that? You see what I'm working with right here? You think you can beat that? Oh, stop it, Chance.
SPEAKER_01: chance listen man you you should really you nodding all the time do you see this video or no listen man listen to me i'll take i'll take years off your life you get on that table with me i will take years off of your life can you die from excitement listen do not from happiness someone talk you into something completely insane i don't think it's that insane
SPEAKER_01: You know what I love to do? I love to make things interesting. I love to make them interesting. Be careful, Chance. Be careful. You should turn back before it's too late. Ships are already falling on the table as we speak. Artem you bluffing? Artem you bluffing or are you serious? No, I'm serious. If Devon made 231, I can beat him.
SPEAKER_01: As of today, as of next week. If I just show up as I am, I'm 240. Well, I don't know. I haven't pulled the 240 version of you. But the 235 version of you, I pulled. You pulled a 236 version.
SPEAKER_01: So I got four more pounds. All I know is if you make 231, I'm beating you. If I don't have a weight cap. There's no just showing up and beating you. I have to dehydrate myself and stop eating and all that. That's what we're talking about for you to pull Petrenko. You remember?
SPEAKER_01: yeah because he's making the weight class too because everybody's doing it like it's a title shot it's like i'm just saying i'm just saying if i come down to florida with my family where i'm like not trained up and i'm like supposed to like stop eating and go on a diet and then i might be able to pull you as you gain weight i mean i'll pull you i would pull you regardless i'm just saying when i pulled petrenko he was 105.
SPEAKER_01: So if I pull you and you're 105. No, it wasn't. Oh, wait. Hold on. Hold on. Petrenko didn't have to weigh in. Petrenko was 105. But there was no weight limit. No, there was no weight limit. No, no. I know his weight.
SPEAKER_04: So Petrenko weighed 105 when I pulled him. So to keep the comparison even, you should also weigh 105. Basically, if Devon makes 105, he cannot beat you. If he's heavier, yeah, yes, yes. Okay, we don't need to talk about it more. So, okay, there is a super... Wait a second. Wait a second. If Devon doesn't win by at least 90% in 10 minutes,
SPEAKER_04: He agrees to pull chains in Orlando next week. Wow. I don't know what I actually weigh right now. I just have been eating and drinking. Umar Khan. No one can beat Devon except Levan, he says. Jared. Devon versus Chance. Devon at 105. Chance at 115. West versus West. 14. 14. Too many matches, my friend. Too many matches. And again, we don't want to
SPEAKER_04: don't want to damage damage devils charisma say something raymond my just okay check this out guys come on let's let's go you want to see you want to see how big i am and chance it's it's it's a lot of hometown people be happy if you yeah just roll up to it see me see me see me here yeah yes okay
SPEAKER_01: all right okay i got some stuff in my pocket uh i've i've drank and eat all morning we don't see nothing i can't see that 240 47. oh come on devin yeah but he has he has it fully closed
SPEAKER_04: And then he has been eating. So he's maximum two 40 in the morning. Yeah. Two 40 morning weight. Yeah. That's just a quick fast away. Devon. You're good at fast. I told you, I told you I was two 40 in the morning. Yeah. So you have, you have at least because of your size with pens, everything you have three pounds on you. And then since this morning eating, drinking four pounds.
SPEAKER_02: normally like only like a pound or cucumber these are heavy military grade pants so up up the weight just slightly okay so maybe five pounds you're saying Devon is 231 will be easy for you chance do you really want to pull him next week I mean I kind of do because last time he said he can beat me with willpower alone and I just smashed him so this time if I do it again in a real match it's like
SPEAKER_02: icing on the cake you know and i really think if he is 231 then i beat him i'm not i'm not saying if he's 250 of course not but 231 yeah absolutely how how was it was it too easy when you were because it looked so easy how was it can you tell us what did you feel i would say maybe a four out of ten difficulty depend evan maybe five out of ten okay so he's yeah you know
SPEAKER_01: You get on that table with me, I will break you into pieces. I'll break you into a million pieces. I will make you feel so helpless. I will make you feel so useless on that arm wrestling table. This will not be a match. It will be a televised practice session, okay?
SPEAKER_01: I won't even stop training. I'll train right up until I get on the airplane. I'll train while I'm there. I'll walk up, whatever, and I will completely murder you. Completely. Let's do it then. Well, I'm going to be there. I have a question. I have a question. I'm going to be there. You have the video. Who had the buckle in the video? Listen, it really doesn't matter. I did. I'm going to tell you. You did. Wait, wait, wait. Hold on.
SPEAKER_02: let's go i'm not sure let me double check you need to beat people like you know i don't even know if you're the best guy in florida chance you see devin putting the buckle on my hand i don't even know if you're the best guy in florida dude i don't have to be there's probably like five guys in florida that can change chance you were beating with the buckle on your hand
SPEAKER_01: yeah yeah with the buckle and with devin setting the strap like this you know with his elbow up and then getting his position serious fish to fry okay serious fish to fry i am way up there chance way up there way up there i agree when you're 270. i'll be 270. listen you saw my weight i'm 240. i don't know i'm saying when you're 270 you're way up here you want me to have a diet
SPEAKER_02: I'm just telling you, if it was an equal comparison, I pulled Petrenko at one Oh five and he was very strong. I pulled you at what? One Oh seven or something. And I was not impressed. So if you have to make one Oh five, I don't think it's, I just don't think it's a match. Do I want to die at this week? Artem you, are you telling me that like Petrenko?
SPEAKER_01: And Devon, maybe I shouldn't have said? I think it's probably a mismatch. Mismatch? Yeah, I think so. Oh, fuck. I hate fighting unless I have to. I was talking about going to sushi with Ian Valliere tomorrow. That's right. God damn it. How is that the only way that you would hold it?
SPEAKER_01: The thing is, so we've already reconciled the fact that me just showing up and beating you is completely ridiculous, right? Because we all know that me at 240 is no match. It's no comparison that I completely murder you, right? We all know that on here. I don't know. No, no, 240, 240, you may have some chances. Like a really good, like, like, like, like, like, so let's not talk about my chance. Like, let's talk about chances, chance. Does he have any chance if I just roll up?
SPEAKER_01: My chances lower the heavier you get. If I'm as I am, I just show up, you have zero hope, right? No, I don't have zero hope. I have some. I'm saying at 231. His claim is you cannot beat him at 231.
SPEAKER_02: And the only reason that 231 or 105 kilos is relevant is because that's the class that you're supposedly going to dominate so easily and beat Petrenko. But if you can't even beat me when I pulled Petrenko, I don't know. I'm just saying. Probably not going to be able to dominate 105. This is very interesting. This is very interesting. You think so? Yeah. 105. Listen, when do I get to weigh in?
SPEAKER_03: Let me weigh in. I have a job to do. Let's not get away from my primary. Artem you asking for a 72-hour weigh-in? Yes. You're asking for a lot on the other end. Truthfully, this is the first time our family, our daughter gets to come with us. We had plans for going out for dinner and doing lots of things outside of arm wrestling work that needs to be done.
SPEAKER_01: And like, you're kind of interfering with our family time and you're not letting them weigh in when we get, what about this? What about this? You can watch you guys eat though. What about this? What about this? I show up, I show up, I get off the plane on Wednesday night. I weigh in, I weigh in, I weigh in two 31.
SPEAKER_01: no thursday evening thursday evening with the same everyone with same everyone why would you have extra 24 hours because i'm working i'm working i'm not going there as an athlete i'm going there to work and promote and do this and do that i mean it's okay it's okay it's okay they will be understood everything it's okay whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa see this is there's all sorts of things going on here okay
SPEAKER_01: If I know, look, I have a title shot coming up. We all know that. This is the real deal for me. 105 Petrenko. I have my sights set on this guy. I am lining him up and we know it's coming. We know this match is coming and I'm going to beat him.
SPEAKER_01: I am. I'm going to beat him. I'm going to make an example out of him. There's one more European on my list. Okay? One more. Then it should be easy. It should be easy. There shouldn't even be a conversation. It should be easy. Let me tell you something, Chance. The more you open your mouth and the more you talk, the more pain is coming your way. Okay? And I know that you know that. And I can't believe that you've let Engen talk you into this madness. I can't believe it. I cannot believe it. Buddy. Buddy.
SPEAKER_01: You're many years away from me. Many years. I am going to bleed you out and I'm not even going to pin you. I'm going to make you quit three times in front of your family. They're going to look at you. They're going to be like, boy, boy, let me get you into business. You need to go back to school. Boy, boy, maybe you should start taking care of the home. Maybe you should
SPEAKER_01: take up Uber driving. This arm wrestling thing is just not going to work out. You realize that this would give me the same opportunity to do that same thing to you, though. You're bringing your whole family from Canada into my hometown, and I get the same opportunity to look at them and just smash them. Keep talking. Keep talking. Thursday night, I'll burn you down. I'll burn you down right in front of your family. I'll be happy to do it.
SPEAKER_04: Okay. It'll make me happy. When Devon said that I am like years ahead of you, he's talking about he's older than you? Artem you even legal to drink in the States, Chance? I'm not that young. I'm 26. Oh, 26. So like half my age. Yeah. Chance, can I tell you something? Listen, about Devon not being as strong, you know, like not even close to his superhero weight, I can prove it right now.
SPEAKER_04: Whenever I asked to him and Petrenko to the match, and I asked Devon, I said, do you want 115 or 105? He said, can we decide that later?
SPEAKER_04: So he is not for sure confident. Why don't you talk about the whole discussion, Engen? Why don't you talk about the whole discussion? No, no, no. Let's say the truth. You were not sure about 105. Yeah, you say the truth. You say the truth. Devon't twist my words. Devon't twist my words, Engen. It is exactly what it is. You would just say, yes, 105. You were like, tell me to decide later. Why is that? That's not at all what I said. Can I ask something? Please, can I ask? You're leaving? Chance. No, no, no. Chance.
SPEAKER_02: Would Devon beat Ibrahim Saga with 115 kilos? At 115? Yeah, I think if Devon is 115, I would favor Devon for sure. But at 105, Ibrahim would beat Devon as well for sure.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, so I'm 105 and Bragum's 115? Yeah, yeah. So that's what this has come to now. No, no, no. He just asked a question. I'm just answering it. So this is how it went. So I went after the Openweight world title.
SPEAKER_01: And I'm like, okay, I'm going to chill out. I'm going to go down to the weight categories. And now everybody's like, yeah, you be in a weight category, Devon, and I'll be in the open. I'll be in the open and you'll be in a weight category. This is even worse. So this is what I'm saying, Devon. I think at 115, you're very competitive. You're probably the man at 115. But as you drop weight, like at a certain limit, your body just can't keep its strength. You see, that's where you actually have a backwards chance.
SPEAKER_01: As I drop, my dominance gets even bigger. I don't know. I'll be more dominant in the 105. And I'm going to tell you something. It's only a matter of time before I go 95. And at 95, I will be even better. I'll be an even better 95 kilo champion. I'm telling you. I think there's probably about six guys. When I'm 60, when I'm 60 or 62 or three,
SPEAKER_01: i'll beat david samusha i'll be the one and he'll have like a 58 win streak and i'll beat him on the 59th yeah david samusha 85 kilo listen listen i know i know this part is a joke but it's not no no it's easy it's not a joke that's crazy it's not crazy you cannot make 85 but do you think yes i can
SPEAKER_04: What do you mean I can't make 85? Why can't I make 85? Probably you were 187 when you were 5 years old. Justin tell me. I can make 85, I can make 95, I could even probably make 75 if I wanted. Okay, but listen, I want to ask something serious. Can you really make 209, 95 kilos? Who, me? Yeah, seriously, 209 you think you can make? I'm asking seriously. And you think that you will make 209 and then
SPEAKER_01: You can be Tata things. You can be directly. These guys are way beneath me. Way beneath me. Way beneath me. It's not. The thing is, it's not, guys. I was, look, I don't need to say I was this weight at this time and this weight at this time. But the truth is, I am supposed to be kind of a skinnier guy. I'm supposed to be.
SPEAKER_01: So when I allow my body to settle, okay, right now I've settled around 240. This is great. As I age, I will continue to get lighter and tighter, more like, you know, just steel, steel, okay? I'm going to be lighter than Engin. Engin is going to be heavier than me because Engin, as he ages, is getting fatter, okay? I'm getting lighter, okay? Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: he's gonna be like devin you need to weigh in at 85 kilo and i'll be 100 kilo and i'll be like whatever whatever it's okay same thing we got going on right now chance you can eat all the porridge you want you can you can eat your ice cream bars okay okay i'll take care of myself
SPEAKER_02: How we can find a compromise? Because, like, okay, chance, we don't even know how much chance weighs. But if Devon comes on that Wednesday and is 231, we weigh in and we get it done because we don't know how much chance weighs. Chance is probably near 300 pounds. I think less. Yeah, probably around there. 290 pounds.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, well, no, what I'm just saying that Chance dieting, Devon, like 105, Devon would beat him. But Chance just eats, drinks, however he wants, and then Devon is going 231, the one that we saw on the video.
SPEAKER_04: It may not be as terrible looking as that one. Well, Ingen, I got to point something out. When I pulled Devon at the Challenger Series, you know, in practice, I was cutting. I was eating very little. Remember, I had to make one. Oh, you were making 115 for a practice game? Yeah, I was eating. I hadn't eaten in five days. Yeah, whatever. Listen, listen, listen. You said eating in five days. You started eating and you said your willpower.
SPEAKER_04: alone you said that you would never eat again don't think for a second don't think for one second that if we hadn't pulled that day that i would have beat wouldn't have beat him i would have beat him that day he said that he was a charity he was a charity oh my god he's making different reasons i'm still looking for the poll here i'm still looking there's no poll there's no poll it says it says 87 chance wins
SPEAKER_04: I don't see a poll. I don't see a poll anywhere. 13%. One guy said 85. 85 probably means 85. I don't see a poll. I don't see a poll. Where's the poll? Where's the poll? That one. Okay. That one is 15%. Chance is 85. That's what they say. There's no poll there. And there's no poll. I'm looking right at the screen. I'm looking right at the screen. Come on, man. Get the glasses. You don't see...
SPEAKER_04: I'm looking right at the screen. There's no poll. I mean, don't you see Google at the top? Justin roll the chat a little bit up. There's no freaking poll, Engin. No, roll the chat a little bit up. Roll, roll. Did you see? No. No, seriously. Roll a little bit more. Okay, rolling. I'm rolling. I'm rolling. I'm rolling up. I'm rolling up. Engin, there's no freaking poll here. Okay, okay. Sorry.
SPEAKER_04: Okay. It's going to be a good event. And I'm telling you, if you want to fucking... Listen, listen. You already made the excuses you wanted to weigh in on. Wednesday and this and that. I understand you don't have any wheel. So it's okay. Devon't worry about it. So we just wait for the... Because, seriously, you are not ready. Maybe to Petrenko match, if you train...
SPEAKER_01: You will be ready, but listen, just imagine if chance beats you, then how can I set the Petrenko match? Yeah, the match will not happen then, for sure. Wednesday night. Wednesday night. Look, I'm not doing the standard athlete, like, get ready. I'm going to be working the whole time. I'm going to be doing interviews. I'm going to be commentating. Right, but you're not dieting, are you, coach? You're just showing up. Imagine doing it.
SPEAKER_04: that's a good imagine doing like a big water cut while you do all that stuff not too much fun right no no i'm calling it right i'm calling it right now if you want him to cut he weighs in wednesday night or it's not happening don't worry don't don't worry um henry says henry nehring you know the guy that we pay money to do extreme things you know just joking like uh vip
SPEAKER_04: How about they each put five grand to make it fun? I tell you what, I will put up five grand if Henry gives me five grand to put up. Oh, one second, one second, one second. It means that you're not confident. That's the guy with... It means I don't have money. Oh, come on. Yeah. Since you're going to win chance, come on.
SPEAKER_01: I've almost done my cucumber. When I finish my cucumber, I better have an answer. Answer to what? I don't know. I feel like all this talk is... I don't even know where we went. I feel like we were supposed to use this time more constructively. And all I'm seeing is now I'm supposed to fight you. That's what I'm getting from all this. Okay, seriously. We were going to do a program to promote the West versus West
SPEAKER_04: 14. And again, we ended up somewhere. Every time Devon comes to program, we talk about something else. Enlarge pronator. Chance. Devon't fall victim to practice pull confidence. Remember what happened to Evgeny and Georgi. West to you all. Listen, they pull against the big Devon. We're talking about small Devon. So, yeah. Look at how thin he looks. Penguins?
SPEAKER_01: Okay, Henry says that I wouldn't put a penny on chance. Right? That's fair. That's a smart guy. That's Henry. Smart guy. He knows what's up. I know. I know, Henry. Smart guy. He knows what's up. He is smart. I think I saw on a podcast that he was really excited for LeVon to beat you. He was. He's a LeVon fan. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: and that's the thing come on we all are we all are come on we all are okay did you guys know that you guys know about the uh the Devon cutout oh yeah yeah you know that somebody I don't know who it was but somebody broke Devon's head off yeah I do know I think he was your wife
SPEAKER_01: I heard that. He did so? Yeah. You know that we have his head at the clubhouse? Artem you serious? Wow. Yeah, look on my Instagram story. We dress him up sometimes. We put a different hat on him. We put different glasses on him. Sometimes we give him a necklace. He's having a good time there. He's our permanent guest. He's our permanent guest. He also loves charity. And you know that
SPEAKER_01: what we do with the ottawa high hookers is we bring back um we bring back like mementos from our victory like if we win a medal guys put it on their their rack guys win a trophy i have different stuff hanging up it's almost like a scalp you know what i mean i would love your glasses or maybe your hawaiian or your hawaiian shirt
SPEAKER_02: so i'll put i would put up my hawaiian shirt against your like green hoodie you know levon asked for the same thing and you know i didn't give levon the actual green hoodie yeah i know are you drawing a comparison between me and levon right now somehow
SPEAKER_01: Well, I'm just saying LeVon wanted it too. And you want that same thing. Dude, you know that you can't wear that, right? You can't wear my green hoodie. You'll die. You'll die. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't, I don't want whatever diseases are on that hoodie. Not anybody can put that on. Like it's really, it's really been around that thing. That thing is definitely, I don't think you want to wear it.
SPEAKER_01: Umar Khan says that Aden will be changed. Devon, do you agree? Yep. Come on, Devon. Come on. Listen, come on. Jeff, you better be careful. You better be careful messing with Aden. Listen, maybe in like five years or like three years. Not five years. Not five years. You watch.
SPEAKER_01: you watch so you mean right now you think no no okay i'm going to take care of my boy a little bit okay but i'm telling you if you want to be on the list you can probably be on the list and it's not going to be long his projection is for sure like this i'm good yeah no no hate on auden at all but today come on today listen i don't need to test him that way i don't we don't need that chance even if his father can beat you or no
SPEAKER_01: No. Okay, then. Hey, Auden. He's maybe sleeping. Yeah, he's probably sleeping. He's got a match already booked. He's got a booked match, so. Korean hook. No, it's fine. Yeah, and I think Auden's going to win that match. I don't know anything about it, so. I think he'll beat him. The guy is strong, but.
SPEAKER_04: not where he needs to be like i don't think he can you know when i was 55 kilo we have oil wrestling here and those guys are incredibly strong and i i was i was training in a gym in the morning and the guy was doing that but he is very like legendary dude best ever
SPEAKER_04: And the guy was doing some bicep curves with the squat machine, like 70 kilo and total was 90 kilo. And I was at same year, I won the world championship and I was doing with the full, you know, of course it's a cable system. It's probably the help of the weight. I don't know what exactly. And then he finally saw me and he wanted to arm wrestle me for one big box of baklava. And then I beat him easily. I was 55 kilos. So those guys are really big, strong, but not.
SPEAKER_04: where they need to be strong in arm wrestling. Yeah. Anyway, so guys, I think it will be a great event. It will be a great event. And I think, yeah, we, we understood that like Devon realizes, I think the next thing he will do as soon as we finish this program, he's gonna write me on WhatsApp and again, set me match with Petrenko at 115. And so at least we understood something. I understood this because he doesn't wanna make one fifth, uh, 105.
SPEAKER_01: in Orlando, so that's all. Again, I think I've pretty clearly stated that I can make 105 in Orlando. I can do it. I'm telling you, I'm telling you that I'll be anybody, anybody in the 105 kilo division. I also have told you that I am so happy
SPEAKER_01: to go and support West versus West and do my part to promote arm wrestling and the beauty that West versus West 14 has to offer. I will do my best to capture and promote it. I'll be very busy. I want to do my very best job. I want to do my very best job. I understand, but you don't need to use this as a cover to... If you want me to prove, and I just can't believe it, really.
SPEAKER_01: I can't believe that this is even crossing the thoughts of all you guys. Chance, especially you, man. I cannot believe that you are even thinking that I will not do terrible. If you think Ibrahim Sagov beat you badly, I will beat you much worse. You're attacking his hand. Ibrahim was going with shoulder pressure.
SPEAKER_01: I will beat you much worse, much, much worse. I'll beat you in a way that leaves you deeply affected.
SPEAKER_02: the thing is devin is first of all i don't believe you're capable of it uh not at 231 but second of all a loss in a loss in arm wrestling is like not that big you can't get in my head like oh okay like my arm does this you got coach ray's haircut i do look at our matching we're matching yeah yours is cooler adan yours is cooler
SPEAKER_01: Do you believe what's going on here? Chance, I don't know what you're thinking, man. I don't know what you're thinking. Alden, I think actually in the practice footage of me beating Devon, I think you were in the back like that. Chance, at that point, I was kicking his ass too. I don't think so. Oh, it was bad. Chance, I hadn't eaten in five days, Chance. I thought it was Kennedy. It was both.
SPEAKER_04: It's both. Listen, listen, Chance, when you lost against Ibrahim, you lost down to 115. Right now you are 130. Imagine what you would do to 105 Devon. Anyway, so Will O'Neill. So is Chance going to pull Devon or just talk? This is what I want everybody to do who's watching this chat right now. Everybody. Everybody.
SPEAKER_01: go over to chance shah's latest video whatever it is he posted go chance shop you still got your youtube channel right buddy yeah go over to shancha's channel go to his last youtube video and beg him if you're a fan of chance shah beg him not to get on the table with me beg him tell him
SPEAKER_01: As a fan of Chance Shaw, tell him not to do it. Tell him to reconsider. See? See? This is the way that he's trying to escape from the match by coming. Not to pull. Yes, yes, yes. It's okay. It's okay, Chance. Forget about it. I have been watching Chance since he was 12 years old, okay? I've been watching him coming up. He's doing great. The last thing you need to do is once a sealed puppy is like, now he's maybe not a puppy anymore. Maybe he's like,
SPEAKER_01: A young, tender seal. Lars thing you want to do is put him in the water with a freaking great white shark, okay? I, as one of the members of this beautiful ocean that we all swim in, I care for this young seal, okay? But if you're going to make me eat him, I'm going to eat him. Okay. Do you want me to eat your chance now? Hey, guys, I really have to jump away? Wait, wait.
SPEAKER_01: all this young guy in front of a person like me oh god listen i don't have to eat ever again in my life and my willpower alone will enchant sha that's the truth that's the truth it's too funny charity charity ever again in my life and my willpower alone will enchant sha
SPEAKER_02: Anyways, so, Raimonds, so this is what it is. Engin, you text me. If you set up this match, just text me so I know if, you know, guys come to some kind of agreement and Devon shows up at 105 kilos. Why not? Why not? It's going to be an epic event, guys. It's going to be a crazy weekend. Look at Chance's face. Look at Chance's face. Chance, next time I see you, you have a decision to make.
SPEAKER_01: Okay. I'm either going to show up as your ally. Okay. And we're buddies and everything's cool. Or I'm coming to destroy you. Okay. You should, you should take some time. Devon't again, that is not a scary thought. Like don't decide right now. Okay. Devon't let hanging pressure you up. Take some time. Talk to your dad. He's a smart guy. Talk to your dad. I know I've met your mom. Talk to your mom. Say mom, dad.
SPEAKER_01: Should I get in the ring with this tiger? Should I do it? Should I really do it? Listen to them. And then right back at me, I'm training. I'll get off the phone here. I'm going to go train. I'll go train. I'll train Monday. I'll train Tuesday. You let me know. You let me know. But listen, if you want me to actually weigh in, if you actually want me to weigh in, I'm going to need to know by, well, I'll want to know by Monday night.
SPEAKER_01: Cause that'll probably mean Monday, Tuesday, probably Tuesday. I probably have to drink a lot of water. So Tuesday I'll drink a lot of water and then Wednesday I won't drink any water. I won't eat anything. I'll get on a plane. I'll show up and I'll weigh in two 31 and then I'll fricking murder you. But let me know, let me know. And I'll put on, I'll put on a demonstration of what it means to be strong, of what it means to have charity.
SPEAKER_01: And what it means to have submission. You'll probably teach me the lesson about submission and I'll teach you about strength and charity. Okay. But all three will be available for your viewing pleasure. You know, a televised practice poll, so to speak. I'm down. I'm ready. So you don't got to wait on me to do anything. Talk to your mom. Talk to your mom. Talk to your mom. Talk to your dad. Okay.
SPEAKER_04: We don't know. You're not even old enough to make these decisions. You don't understand what you're getting in with. That part, you say, talk about your mom, talk about your dad while John is making decisions for you or something. Let's not go there. Right, Chance? It is kind of true. Talk to whoever you want. Whoever is your counsel. Seek counsel, young man.
SPEAKER_04: Take your counsel. Okay, guys, I got to leave. Stay strong. Okay. Take care. And then I'm just reading two more things and then going. Umar Han says, let's talk about the matches now, guys. And Julio Martinez says, Devon, don't you think regardless of who can really beat Levan in full?
SPEAKER_04: He should come against top five guys for the sake of arm wrestling and good entertainment. Pulling once a year is crazy. He's not pulling once a year. He pulled once a year last year because he hurt his wrist. But this year he pulled in April and he will pull again in December. So it will be twice a year. But yeah, what do you think about what he says? I think it's a good idea changing the topic. Engin, you are a good man. You are a good man. That is not a good man. It's a super chat.
SPEAKER_04: I think that's a smart move for the promotion. England is trying to save chance. What do you mean England is trying to save chance? You think that I'm not setting the match because I'm trying to save chance? This is not because of that. We have already 16 matches and I think that you guys wouldn't
SPEAKER_04: want this and you you guys are looks like Devon fans and you wouldn't want Devon's charisma to you know you know Devon is already making so many excuses I'm gonna work and help Indian and also he's saying like what's oh only Wednesday if I make the way in like he wants extra one day compared to the other athletes okay what's up see that one yeah you you look very slim seriously
SPEAKER_04: I think this shape. Yeah. It looks like only pronator left. Nothing else, you know? Yeah. I'm almost done my cucumber. Yeah. Yeah. You're going to need a lot more cucumbers to beat me. Devon. Not going to eat anything for like a couple of days. Wow. Okay. Okay. What, what does this mean? The guy says that engine knows that Devon would sell many papers, so he will
SPEAKER_04: For sure saving chance. What do you mean? Like if he would sell paper with him, why would I save chance by not setting this match up? I don't know. Maybe he's joking, right? Yeah. Anyways, so anyways, Devon, I think, yeah, that's enough that we talk and we realize. So you versus Petrenko 115, correct? 105. 105.
SPEAKER_01: 105 because he's got the title 105 right he doesn't have the title 115. but drenko has the world title at 105. yes yes yeah so i'm going to take the title from him so why did you say that let's decide that later or something when i ask you and then go back and review your messages i mean whatever
SPEAKER_04: Engin, okay. Engin just set it up. Another match is awesome, especially with Devon. I don't know. If Devon accepts to weigh in on Thursday with the other guys, I may set it. But I don't know if he's serious or not. He's probably front of the cameras. You know, he's just saying this way. I know Chance is confident.
SPEAKER_04: And we saw what happened on the Challenger series. It's okay. It's okay. And Chance, you are serious, right? You're not really joking or something. I am serious. No jokes. Chance. Chance. Okay. Let me tell you how the match will go. Let's hear it from Devon's perspective. Let's hear it. We will come to the table. You will not be comfortable.
SPEAKER_01: You will refuse to take a grip. We will settle upon a referee's grip. We will slip to go to the straps. We will get in the straps. You will continue to not be comfortable. Eventually they will say go. Your wrist will be bent back. You will struggle. I will wait. You will continue to struggle. You will realize that this is pointless.
SPEAKER_01: you will submit round two pretty much a repetition however it will look so much worse because I will not even move so much I will retain more pieces and by the round three it will just be a complete comedy show a complete and I may even let you beat me are you just like are you trying to cast this into the universe three in round three what I will do is I will stop the match
SPEAKER_01: Shaw extreme dominance. Extreme dominance. And I will prolong the event. I will let you beat me round three. But I will be giving you so much charity. I will give you so much that it even is a win. And then in round five, I will stop you cold. I will look at you. I'll tell everyone. What do you mean round five? It will be two-two? Round four. Round four. Oh, okay. Round four. I will stop you.
SPEAKER_01: And everyone will see how strong I am and how you have nothing. I feel like this is the exact speech that you give to a picture of LeBron. And then I'll let you pin me again. And it'll be 2-2. And then in the fifth round, you will bow to me. You'll bow to me.
SPEAKER_01: Devon, can I ask you something? This is crazy. This is 100%, 100% from start to finish how the match will go. I've said it now, and if you want to agree to my terms, if you want to agree to me showing up, weighing in, doing my job, okay, that's what you'll see. And this will be my lesson to you. Devon, if you wanted, you could beat him 3-0? Yes. Okay, how about this? If he wins one round, will you
SPEAKER_04: give up pulling Petrenko at 105 and 115? No, I don't think you heard me, Engin. No, I heard everything, but that's not what I am asking. He can't beat me, Engin. He can't beat me anyway. I think that he can, but if he wins, even one round, so you accept to pull Petrenko at 115 instead of 105? Engin. He cannot say yes.
SPEAKER_02: Imagine if chance beat you one round, what would Petrenko do to you? To be fair, I got one round on Petrenko as well, so then it'd be even. Was it on fouls? It was on fouls, yeah. Okay. It's still something, though. Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: With Devon, I won't beat him one time. I'll beat him three times and none of them on fouls. Justin three pens. One, two, three. I'm doing what Devon's doing. I just cast it into the universe. I hope it becomes true. What Devon is saying to me is what he reads. He holds a picture of LeVon's head and he says, I will beat you in round one. I'll do this. It's like he's trying to hype himself up. It's just hilarious to me. Yeah, so let's pull.
SPEAKER_01: who said this let's pull i did i'm waiting on devin okay let's do that hang in talk to my agent i'm in uh but like here's the thing here's the thing out of niceness out of the out of the charity which is inside of me i'll let you take a day chance really talk to your mom talk to your dad i will beat you don't need it
SPEAKER_01: i'm telling you i'm telling you chance i'm telling you now the way i said it is exactly how it'll go are you wait are you saying there's a chance that i might lose an arm wrestling match no no it's not it's not that you'll lose another oh my goodness it's not that
SPEAKER_01: might lose i might wait you might just be able to hold me but i don't i'm actually scared now devon i don't know i like to compete with people who don't think they can beat me i don't like to i don't like to compete with people who don't actually believe they can beat me and i don't think for a second that you actually believe you can beat me that's the thing a lot of these guys they think they can beat me i think petrenko thinks he can beat me i think a lot of guys think they can beat me chance i don't think you think you can beat me
SPEAKER_01: I don't think that I can beat a 260, 270 pound version of you. I agree. I don't think, I don't think, I don't think you can beat any version of me. I know I can be the 231 pounds. No, you don't. No, you don't. No, you do not. You're saying these words, you're saying these words, but you don't mean them. You're saying them that you do not mean a single word that you're saying.
SPEAKER_01: I mean at all I know I can beat the 231 chance and I know I cannot universe that's greater than talking okay you need to reconcile with yourself and understand that there's a truth that comes out of you okay that I can see very clearly and it's that I know that you know you can't beat me I know that I know that you know you can't beat me so you know that
SPEAKER_02: you know that i think that i can't beat you but i know that i know i can beat you so what does it what does it matter what you think that i know none of this matters all that matters is i'm telling you that i will beat you if you accept the match i like the way that the chip continue to fall onto the table i like that i like the way they continue to fall because
SPEAKER_01: Right now, I'm probably going to hand things over to Lyle, my agent. He can take care of things. But between you and me, I would love to just, if you really believe it. See, when somebody believes they have a good hand, they'll continue to play. They'll continue to let things stack up. And I am willing to take your house, to take your car, to take everything from you. I'm willing to take it all. That's how much I believe. I know. There's no question. There's no question that I'll beat you.
SPEAKER_02: any way in any format there's no question chance are you getting intimidated more you listen to him no not even a little bit i don't i don't listen what i don't understand is people getting intimidated about an arm wrestling match right where we're not we're not fighting right it's not it's not nothing crazy i can't be intimidated about a possibility of losing an arm wrestling match but even if i could i'm not going to lose this match so what's the relevance
SPEAKER_04: There is one guy says it's boring. My friend, if it is boring, please just go watch something and maybe satisfy yourself. Rick Harrow, no, my friend, those guys cannot get visa. And Mr. Seegart, if chance loses, will he shave his eyebrows off?
SPEAKER_02: no my wife would kill me if if i ever agreed to do anything that would gamble shaving my eyebrows off absolutely not especially because sunday the day after this event uh i leave for my honeymoon so i can't be walking around with no eyebrows even the possibility of it why would you walk around with that eyebrows i wouldn't but i that's that's just something that i can't even gamble yeah yeah yeah okay
SPEAKER_04: Yeah. Anyway, so let's, let's finish here and then you guys think about it and then if Devon accepts to weigh in on Thursday and then, and then if you guys are really serious, yeah, let's pull. That's what we're saying now. We're saying Thursday? Saying Thursday. Yeah. Thursday, Thursday morning when I wake up. No, everyone the same Thursday evening and then Saturday you pull.
SPEAKER_04: Anyway, so you can just think about it, and then we will decide. Anyway, so you realize that, right? If it is Thursday evening, then he thinks he cannot beat you. So anyways, Engin, that is your answer there. Chance don't believe he can beat Devon. Is that true, Chance? No, that's not true.
SPEAKER_04: I know I can beat a 231 pound version of that. Devon, listen. I'm trying to tease you all the time. I always tease you. Lars 20 years, I have been teasing you. But this guy really believes he can beat you. He doesn't, Dangan. He does not. No, privately when we talked, he was saying that... He doesn't say that. No. No, he doesn't. He doesn't say it. Dangan, come on.
SPEAKER_01: Come on. Yeah. Let's be real for just a second here. Zero chance. That's what your new nickname is going to be. Zero. Now it will be zero chance after this match. Zero chance. I think, Devon, if I'm not mistaken, that's the same nickname that Zurab gave me. So I kind of like that nickname. Also, Uber chance. Uber chance.
SPEAKER_01: it sounds kind of funny like uber means like ubermensch or like you know high up uber german uber uber chance but actually it means you're working for uber you see you already you already gave me a nickname like five years ago you can't just go and change it like it's what was it already locked in what was it hub boat over chance is better
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, Devon gave me that nickname. Chance is much, much better. It's too late. It's too late. You should have picked that five years ago. Chance. Chance. No, no, no, no. Which chance is showing up? Is it going to be regular chance? Is it going to be Chance? It would be funny. It's a good nickname. Chance. Okay. Okay. So let's finish here. And then thank you, guys. And then let's focus on West vs. West 14. But seriously, you guys are just – we start a program to promote West vs. West 14.
SPEAKER_04: don't know how it came to this point again and devin thank you very much my friend i i will i'll just think about it if you accept the weigh-in at the same time with the other athletes let's set it chance i hope i hope you are not joking and then i'm serious yeah okay so let's if you guys are serious and then yeah we can think about it and then and then but see people says it's like jack paul is challenging canelo how do you say
SPEAKER_04: no i don't follow boxing yeah that's that's like the best boxer in the world canelo okay okay so it's a bad example anyways you know it's it's pretty on point actually anyways thank you very much hans thank you very much devon and thank you very much to almost 800 people that has been watching us you you guys are great devon thank you very much for helping again for these what is disaster
SPEAKER_01: last time i come on here you fight with me this time i come on here chances i don't even know what you call this anymore what what am i signing up for next time mangan what do you mean signing up every time you ask me to do one of these podcasts it becomes so hostile you know yeah
SPEAKER_04: I think that we are just so piramidizing guys that we can't control what to talk and it just goes, like we can't really make a plan. It just goes wherever it goes. That's what I understand. I think that we make this subject, pre-planned subject, it doesn't work. We just talk whatever we want to talk and that's all. That's what I believe. In a couple of days, Chance, talk to your mom and dad.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I'll see you, Devon. Yeah. I kind of believe that Chance will say, just please don't tell anyone, but I really don't want to pull him, but just say that you're going to make a private call. You think I'm going to say that? Yeah. No.
SPEAKER_02: no no i'm in i'm i'm in because you look a little bit scared when devon comes and talks like paul to your dad and mom you know like uh it's silly to me it's silly okay just like such a silly thing to do and say okay you're drawing a comparison between arm wrestling and getting in a cage with a tiger is just like it's silly just talk to your mom and dad just talk to your mom just be sure be sure i i don't want to do anything without parental consent on this one
SPEAKER_01: They'll be there. So they, you know, they can consent right there. No problem. As long as Jody gives you permission, you know, got to ask the boss. Jody is just, she doesn't, she knows I'll kill you. That's why she's like, she just wants to go to restaurants and have a good time. She does. She just wants, she just wants me to be there with her. She's like, this is a family vacation. She doesn't want me to be arm wrestling and dieting.
SPEAKER_02: know that's that's where jody says that whatever whatever the boss uh lets you do you know you gotta get approval first and then once your boss approves it then you can let me know but chance don't be saying these kind of things we know that you also have a boss at home yeah yeah i do but she she's not on the camera that's the difference uh okay okay well then chance i suggest you rest up i'll keep training but i suggest you rest up
SPEAKER_01: As soon as I'm done, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going to train today. I'll train tomorrow. Well, depends on this fricking weight cut stuff that I got to do. If I have to be cutting weight, this is kind of a pain in the butt, but you know,
SPEAKER_04: Well, we have to talk about when that weigh-in is going to be. I'm telling you, it's Thursday evening. Sorry. Anyways, guys, thank you very, very much, Chance. And thank you very much, Devon. Thank you again. Take care. Love you guys. And love everyone who has been watching us. And thanks. Take care. I'm sorry, Daddy Chance. I'm sorry, Mama Chance.
