SPEAKER_03: August will join us in a little bit you have the link you don't need link again just resend it to Travis oh yeah it says we scheduled on West versus West huh yeah but not and it's and it is and it's live and it's live on West versus West it's pretty cool you know so so super cool my friend super cool my friend um thank you all for joining us I'm here with one and only Artem Taranenko
SPEAKER_02: you doing i'm doing good are you messed up my name it's uh it's alexander tarlanenko
SPEAKER_02: Yes, I'll say that exactly. You go by a lot of names. Little Artem. That's you. You have this impression under me that I'm... I don't even want to go into the depth of it because you're not on my personal channel. But you have this impression of me that I'm not who I am or I'm not who I'm trying to be. Or I'm trying to be somebody that I'm not.
SPEAKER_03: That's the best way to put it. That was the biggest lie you have ever said. You are exactly who I think you are. Back to back. People are pissed. People are pissed.
SPEAKER_02: Can I talk about Engin's, not Engin's, the last West vs. West post? This is my flyer moving to August. People are, I guess some people are upset that most people are like, yo, Artem's going to get killed. I went to your Instagram, I saw the post, and then I read the comments. I read the comments on the official post, right? So, I don't know. Why are people so pissed?
SPEAKER_02: explain well people i understand why people are pissed right because it seems like a lot of europeans are pissed because like you'll see the comments and stuff so it's like i'm like i mean whatever just because i guess well it's like a normal reason like if you didn't get a match or you thought you're gonna get a match or for whatever some whatever reason somebody else gets a match trust me mentally i have been there
SPEAKER_02: 13 times right 14 east versus west i've participated in one i probably anticipated to participate in another 13. so i understand uh i think like i'm actually one extra but anyway you get that you get the point so i understand you from that perspective i am surprised my right arm
SPEAKER_02: well i don't know if in my right arm or my whole body by now is so like diminished by the internet like yo why why are you pulling me dogs and i get it and i get it i mean august it's not like my dog is a slouch where it's like you know like yeah i mean august can pull like anybody but they're like there's a lot of people thinking it's a mismatch and i'm like i'm like dude i don't even think
SPEAKER_02: mean like not like not saying that like i'm any good but like there's i feel like there's with the weight difference and all that stuff like i don't think it's ever been a mismatch i think it's i mean well maybe at some point right but like i feel like i feel like it's been pretty good match for a long time if you just put it together like i don't know january february march whatever and i feel like by now neither one of us almost cares i feel like we both are ready to bang
SPEAKER_03: Well, I think it's you know how it is. People saw you in one match and they think that's all you are, right? If you lose, you lose forever. If you win, you're undefeated and probably 11 is on the menu. So Internet is a weird, weird place. And again, like I think
SPEAKER_02: they they still don't get what tom says right they still right that's another thing right i'm trying to tell them i was like i was some under other impression that he um uh i feel like he was already was big in but keely but somebody told me no it's like i think yana said no it's probably can be a good match eventually but uh other than that uh i mean where i was going with that is that
SPEAKER_02: look at tom's it's crazy and man i lost my third assignment after you start talking about thompson but yeah there's some realization about that about tom's for sure yeah it's just listen like uh i think you and mind it's a good match i have mind as a favorite because he's so hard he's yeah
SPEAKER_03: Because to beat him, you need really, really strong hand. To beat him, you need really, really strong hand. If your hand holds up, we're in for a good, good match. And I think you could do really, really well because of your style, how you can pull and hit, right? And you kind of go under. But I have pulled Min. I have seen him so much that for me, he's really amazing in what he does.
SPEAKER_03: And what he does is very tricky thing. It's very...
SPEAKER_02: yeah i've pulled with him a bunch so i understand uh to me it's like the problem with him you you do feel a pronation all the way around you know i mean it's like like because like i was fairly like successful pulling him like a couple times but it's like it doesn't matter always where you pick to finish it there's always going to be pronation and the pressure there like you want to try to go there here here like it's you you feel it like there's a lot of constant
SPEAKER_02: back pressure and you know the pronation move um
SPEAKER_02: so i think one thing to consider though i don't know people realize like you will show like all this stuff like my right my right hand and left hand are so much different you know i mean like my left hand gets i mean to get lost in that thing like my right doesn't you know i mean my my like i can probably i can choose to try but like it's i have a lot more containment which is better for this match you know i mean like it's kind of i mean it will be better to have it for that in toms but uh
SPEAKER_02: uh considering mingy's style if his style and his power is the same left and right-handed i'd rather pull him right-handed but just to protect my as far as the protection myself right i really think like i really think the hand is almost not important like i understand what you're saying like it's it is like you need to have it but i also feel like you can get a lot of what you can get away with a lot is just sheer top roll
SPEAKER_02: like it's like todd hushing does it a lot there's a lot of like you try to do whatever you try to top roll todd you end up getting top rolled you know what i mean and it's not really necessarily his hand so uh i feel like if you can just negotiate good enough top roll i mean it's the other person have to care or worry about the hand as a top roller you really don't have a good hand in my opinion unless you are a really good
SPEAKER_02: like outside of the stop stopper yeah yeah unless you like the containment otherwise people like like like like todd says and i mean we're in the wrong channel but you know they uh they're the surrounding people right there's really not not many top rollers do have that great hand controller maybe even wrap around hookers do right because they kind of they kind of want to wrap it in right they're really confident in their hand top rollers don't like unless they really like strap efficient and they really want to put it all in there
SPEAKER_02: So with that being said, you can't just bet on taking their hand also. So that's why it is important to protect against being 100% with the style. I think the problem is the level of experience, too. He's not just a top-roller dude. You know what I mean? He's like...
SPEAKER_02: a world-class puller that actually have went to worlds not just like the american world-class puller that like just competed against a world-class guy like and maybe beat him yeah i'm world champion yeah well unlike in the newspaper and you and you doubt in your townhouse or some but like no um as far like so with him so well me so media is actually like actually like legit professionals i think that's gonna be oh it's straight now too
SPEAKER_03: No, I had crazy trouble. So we'll have an issue with that. Anyways, what's up, guys? What do you mean? Artem is trying to explain to me how this is not a mismatch. Well, I know it's not a mismatch. It might be difficult. What did you say? It must be difficult, I believe. I'm out.
SPEAKER_02: This is how it starts. This is how it starts. So how are you doing? Come on, Artem. Get back here. Artem. I'm going to kill you now. Did you guys see Engins?
SPEAKER_01: post on facebook this morning which i think he deleted pretty quickly i didn't i didn't see it he was uh making a post about how he thinks artem artem is gonna win okay uh so i guess he was trying to um well i if i saw that post if i and i was artem i wouldn't really like it because
SPEAKER_02: It kind of shows that Engin needs to bring you up a little bit just to make it seem like it's a match. Well, I mean, well, I guess it's also, I mean, we're talking about Engin though, you know what I mean? So I feel like maybe, I'm going to bet you, he probably got like a hundred messages from random Europeans people. You know, how is this guy arm wrestling me in August? Because I bet you there's like a lot of weird people like,
SPEAKER_02: were looking forward to match with you and maybe been asking for it for whatever right and they're gonna get it so that's why as soon as they saw the flyer it was like yo even your friends in u.s i saw the comments on your own fucking post uh those are not my friends do not my friends do not comment anything you think they comment uh john terrien is betting 500 on you losing
SPEAKER_01: you never be my friend i hate john tyrian what's up fellas hey beast hey listen you're trying to paint the story in a way where it seems like artem has a chance he doesn't help us he's too big for you i think he he'll do good that's a good angle i like that that's a good angle yeah artem is huge yeah so much bigger
SPEAKER_00: Not so much, but just... And it matters. Yeah, it matters. It matters. Beast, you must be a fan of Mendoza. Come on. I do like him. I like him. I like him. I like him. I like him. I do like him. Got skills. The man's got skills. He's got balance, coordination. I can also... Intelligence.
SPEAKER_00: i can flip anytime i want be careful saying that anytime i want to say the same thing i used to say the same thing i feel like those are shots taken or something i don't know hey i definitely felt them i felt them it was all purpose or not i felt it you know but yeah both travis and artem are in a weird spot right now
SPEAKER_00: Kind of losing a little bit too much. I don't know. I mean, I only lost one. God damn. That's a little bit too much. That's a little bit too much. Come on, man. Hey, my match and your match with Arthur look the same in the box scores. If you don't watch the match, you can't tell that you pulled a lot better than me. So...
SPEAKER_00: Ease up, kid. Ease up. Well, listen, I talked to the boys in South Carolina because I had to do some research on this cat. And listen, man, this guy's way bigger than Coach Ray. Oh.
SPEAKER_03: all right uh what uh is it posted the right yeah yeah yeah they said the guy's the real deal and he texted me he said what's your weight i said 86 87 kilos he's like would you want to pull at 95. you said hey i i can't choose the engine whatever you say boss
SPEAKER_00: saying i say i say exactly what travis is saying so yes yes boss yes boss whatever you need thank you beggars can be choosy hey did you guys catch um did you catch the banner between hunter and doug hey i turned it on yesterday after you told me to i as the beginning and hunter was hot
SPEAKER_00: Was it good? No, it wasn't good, but I'm just telling you, like, there are some emotions in Doug's heart about his dislike with Hunter's rise to fame. Like, it's really irritating as shit to him. And I tell you, man, Doug's prickly. Like, he's an interesting cat, man. This thing could get... I could see somebody smacking the shit out of somebody with these two.
SPEAKER_00: It's going to be awesome. And I know it doesn't seem like that big a deal across the world. But in that section where they live, there's that little South bunch of fucking redneck grown ass chew tobacco spitting fucking dudes. And every one of the motherfuckers weighs 180 pounds.
SPEAKER_00: every one of them and they take a lot of pride in who the fuck is that middleweight champ and it's always been like that craig touye chad silvers justin bishop that whole little thing and they they don't like each other even though they're the same same people like like each other eventually it takes years
SPEAKER_00: well they gotta they gotta introduce mandogas and coach ray and from a different country then they team up but there is there's animosity there amongst themselves even when they're all together and some outsider tries to rank them in front of each other they don't play that like
SPEAKER_00: You can't tell Justin Bishop he's not the guy. You cannot tell anybody in Louisiana that Craig's not the guy. You cannot tell anybody in South Carolina that they don't run shit. And these motherfuckers are all right here. It takes an hour, two hours between each other. That's it. Car ride. So it's going to be awesome. That match, though not looked at across seas, is important. It's real big in that South. It's big.
SPEAKER_01: Well, both Doug and Justin are very good friends of mine. Both of them told me that Artem is going to visit or have a practice very soon with those guys, right? Yeah, Artem usually whacks them guys when he goes to practice, man. So they both told me that... He tells me he couldn't even feel those fucking guys, man, every time.
SPEAKER_00: They have assured me that they will inform me about all the little details, any weaknesses in Artem's game. I probably got those to tell you my weaknesses. They want to do videos about Devon's love for the Europeans. These fucking traitors are going to get this information? No way. These are Donald Trump voting motherfuckers. They would never...
SPEAKER_00: their fellow american artem's a fellow american no you better not listen to anything they say mcdougall artem is a russian spy i'm telling you it's it's a great i'm closer to i'm closer to donald trump than an artem i went usa across the board with all my predictions just because i'm like
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I'm not showing up down there with these dudes like, yo, why you dick? Why you do that? But I could not go with Talbott. I mean, that's the only match where I think that the Aymeric are in true trouble.
SPEAKER_00: All the other matches, I like them. I think we got a good chance of, and you know what would be sweet is if we sweep you fucking guys. And then it's like this unwritten rule where it's like, what side of the buckle is it on? Where's the match? Is the match in North Aymeric or is it across the pond, you know, where I don't feel comfortable per se as an Aymeric?
SPEAKER_00: I don't want to destroy the dreams, but it's very unlikely, Travis. Very unlikely. Justin know that you are one of the heroes over there that we don't mind going against, okay? Justin keep that in mind, too. You and Coach Ray, all right? We are constantly asking for you guys. You guys are like the Swedish guys. Like, come on over here and get some.
SPEAKER_00: The Swedish girls. I'm not saying, no, the Swedish guys. Chance took advantage of all the Swedish dudes. They all came over, they all left. And they had 37-hour plane rides, and they had to leave like an hour after they lost. And I was like, damn, Chance is a good boy. He really didn't show up with that ticket.
SPEAKER_00: So yeah, I'm hoping that does happen because that'll be good. It'll explain a little bit, give a little justification as the Aymeric, you know, the win-loss record not being that good over there and overseas. So hopefully that happens. Well, I think
SPEAKER_00: You know, the time change will definitely impact all of us from this side, a hundred percent. And I think it always impacts the other side, right? If you are, but if you are. It's got a four hour camel ride just to get to the fucking airport. I mean, this guy's going to put it in trying to get to this, trying to get to the US. Tell us the trip. What time does it start? And what time will you land in Orlando? The trip? Yes.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it's a bit annoying. Quite a few layovers. The first time you got to leave your village of 37 people. The village of 37 people. How long does that take for you to reach? Let's say 45 minutes to reach the airport. Okay, that's not bad. That's not bad. And then I have two stops with two hours each. And where are they at?
SPEAKER_00: know i think one of them is in iceland okay that's not bad so you're on the way so that's good news and then somewhere in u.s maybe boston like boston okay and then straight to orlando okay well that was you kept it real positive at the end and said straight to orlando yeah i hope you don't have to stop anywhere else but okay that's not that annoying coach ray is yours better worse
SPEAKER_03: worse worse 20 hours uh i think first layover hamburg so we're going backwards and then i have to be i think boston also and then big one there and then we arrive i i leave like 7 00 a.m in the morning and i land like 11 at night and it's minus eight hours so yeah you know
SPEAKER_03: guys what day will you guys get there wednesday thursday wednesday wednesday wednesday thursday early morning no respect no respect you guys need loud jacks to stay in boston could have been five friday early morning windows friday morning that was no delays
SPEAKER_00: I'm convinced that if I could just get a first class ticket, I could benefit from flying over there, getting off the plane and arm wrestling. Because the more I hang around in the hotel and get, you know, semi acclimated, the more
SPEAKER_03: weird i think i think the best is like in first three days if you can get whatever you need to be done done because those two days in between that's when your body is messed up it it really doesn't understand what the is going on right so yeah travis about your match but then we're going to talk about these two jam but your match you have a big match is it for pretty much number one in
SPEAKER_00: North Aymeric? I think it's for number two in the United States. North Aymeric is a weird situation. I don't even like saying that. To me, my first goal is to somehow be the best left-handed guy in the United States of Aymeric. And there's a route to do that. I don't know if I'm ready for that route, but man, how lucky am I that I can arm wrestle
SPEAKER_00: Corey in a couple weeks and then if I win, I can get Cody in Lars Vegas at the king of the table. That is sweet that someone like if you really want to talk about like legacy and career and experience, that's all you can hope for is that if there comes a time where you want to try to beat the champ, first of all, can you get a match with the champ?
SPEAKER_00: Usually it's just not that easy. So one reason that I am like not, I'm lucky that I had that in my past where this is available. The problem is, is Corey is up.
SPEAKER_00: Like, and then what I mean by that is if you're not a lot stronger than him, which we have seen guys be better than him, right? Arif right-handed took care of him and we saw, you know, Morozov looks crazy awesome against him. So when I see those matches, I'm like, okay, bro, the dude I used to be is probably running this guy over, right? And then I'm thinking about the guy I really am. And then the last proof,
SPEAKER_00: that I had of it right-handed, which hopefully is not the same as, you know, I think there's a difference between me left and right-handed, just physically from my peck not being like, I'm just not as tight, I hope, right-handed. So I'm blessed for the opportunity, but also too, my reputation might've got me in some matches I probably didn't deserve to be in.
SPEAKER_00: And I hope Corey's not one of them, because he does possess the awkward losing position, broke arm, hand back. He'll stay stubborn, where a guy like Derrick Smith,
SPEAKER_00: talented tall all that skill level but if you take him out of his out of his spot he he'll fold you know me soft like me so that does bother me is that i actually could get some hand position on corey and not be able to finish him that would suck um but on the flip side there's a good chance i just run him over left-handed and i really am the best guy in the united states which would be sweet be a sweet way to bring in the new year and then
SPEAKER_00: With that title, you know, you could help promote. You know, it's easier to promote the West vs. West events if you've got a little clout with you. So as of right now, my left hand still has not been obviously exposed. So that's helpful. If I can win, it will just make it more helpful for the promotion in the future. Because I'm probably going to get four or five of these matches I don't deserve anyway. But, man, I don't want to go on those six match losers
SPEAKER_01: I want to ask expert's advice. How do you rank Travis's chances versus Corey West? Well, for many, many years, I felt like Travis just talks a lot and cannot really arm wrestle. You thought that? I did think that, yes. Fuck this.
SPEAKER_01: uh i thought he was his left is overrated like crazy and um let's find out i'm excited to find out i'm excited to find out stream with you guys sorry say it again i can hear you where i'm here oh yes no go ahead i'm good i'm kidding go ahead but so so i wish he could at least slip this time
SPEAKER_01: i don't i'm in trouble right so um looks like a good match looks like a good match let's see corey is strong yeah he is
SPEAKER_03: Travis, do you think you can, like, it's not a lot of time between these matches, right? And you kind of rested the whole week. Do you think you can get a little bit better than you were with left? Yeah, I mean, yeah, I think that, yeah, I mean, I'm not sure I need to be either. I mean, I don't, I mean, my left arm feels, I mean, it hasn't been opened up in a long time. So it feels like,
SPEAKER_00: it can stay sticky right there at my chin. So, I mean, I may be right on par. It's just the obvious, right? Like what just took place right-handed, it's called, you know, it's definitely allows, you know, you to be for some doubt to creep in. So...
SPEAKER_00: I'm just hitting it every other day as hard as I can. Left-handed today, right-handed tomorrow, left, right, left, right. The machine is right here in the background being used like crazy. So we'll see. I still have these huge admirations of doing something crazy. So we'll see if it happens or not.
SPEAKER_03: it might it just might be a little too early right but we'll definitely see what you got and it's tough like corey's i think he's very uncomfortable because he's such a huge guy like now he lost some weight it might be more human like hand but he had those he lost weight who said he lost weight he made some posts that he lost like yeah but you know he's chubby guy man that's lose six pounds and all of a sudden he's like proud of himself come on
SPEAKER_01: All you did was hiccup, motherfucker. That wasn't a real diet plan. Fuck out of here. Minda, Artem, do you have a weight cap on this? Yes, it is. 85? 85 kilo for Artem, 77 kilo for me. I put this weight cap on myself just to keep it fair.
SPEAKER_03: okay that's that like can you make it can you cut down to 70 or sorry gain up to 77. uh i'm struggling currently 76 76 yeah dude speak dude put the weight cap on himself just to make it for you i had to i had to well he needs to use it as travis said the last time he used it as an excuse so be good whatever whatever he needs to tell himself it's a no-win situation here he's in a beautiful position man
SPEAKER_00: Justin know that if we invited you over here to pull on our territory, we thought we could beat you. So even if you beat us, just know what the perception was before you got here.
SPEAKER_01: it's weird it's somehow difficult for me to to talk trash to artem it's almost easier to talk trash um on travis yeah i know that i noticed that i don't feel like artem right off the end of your tongue easiest but just his his face seems so soft and i almost don't want to
SPEAKER_00: uh oh well he is very confident when you're not around mandagas just so you know okay that's good to know that's something very confident listen he was also very confident and uh and also too i've heard your buddies doug and justin they're not always that nice about when they hear your name they're not are you sure that you might be friends with them are they friends with you
SPEAKER_00: I think not. You did beat Justin. You better be careful. Yeah. Justin will go Donald Trump quick on a motherfucker, man. Devon't get it twisted. I will just duck. I will turn my head. This is too much already, guys. Hey, what about Giannis? Is Giannis ready? Yeah, yeah. He's...
SPEAKER_03: Putting it in other gear, just training harder, harder, harder. But like Justin is difficult. I think he's like mean to prove that he's very difficult armor. So to face and we have seen him multiple times. So I'm very interested in that match. And, you know, they have history. So it's even better. Right. Yeah. And Justin always thought that he could beat him and he should have beaten him. Right. So now is his chance to to try and do it. We'll see. We'll see.
SPEAKER_00: Plus Giannis, first time Giannis pulling on West versus West. I know. First match. It's interesting because I'll tell you, when I was watching, I was so impressed with Giannis at the press conference, just the way that he understands arm wrestling and everything. And I was wondering, like, man. And again, like the fourth time I've asked him, like, yo, when are you pulling? And finally he's like.
SPEAKER_00: I'll be in Orlando. So I think that's good for everybody. I think he's a good guy. And I also think that he's beatable, too, for Justin. So that's good for us, too. It's good for us.
SPEAKER_03: I think I, I, my personal feeling is Giannis is the biggest lightweight superstar that have us like Aymeric like Giannis. Cause he might have been there pulled so many different tournaments so many times. So there's a huge following for him, even though you kind of want to see the other guy win. So I think the crowd is going to be very interesting there. No doubt. Yeah. He's the dude. Good dude. Good fucking dude. I agree. Yeah. But yeah, difficult match for you. And it's because, um,
SPEAKER_01: From what I know, it seems like Janis really should increase his power by a lot during the last couple of months. If he didn't, he might really struggle with Justin. I'm going to find out because I published with Janis just a little bit, so I'm going to publish Justin this side of this. We're going to see where everybody's at. I'll do some spying work.
SPEAKER_01: Dave you and Giannis pulled at the worlds and stuff a bunch or in different class? Lars time I pulled him, it was a secret practice in Copenhagen just before my match with Makaro. And it was interesting.
SPEAKER_00: me killed his ass all right that's good that's up you would talk about yannis like that man when he's not even that's terrible man tell him this is live man this is live i know that he will always be super professional on last couple months he will just boom
SPEAKER_00: Well, once he gets them steroids in him, you know, once y'all boys get them steroids in y'all, that's why. It's not our style. It's just you guys. We'll be testing you motherfuckers right after Sheridan when y'all get off that plane, too. Only if you get tested as well. Only if you get tested as well. This ain't that bullshit wild, wild west y'all got going on over there in Latvia.
SPEAKER_00: Okay. I mean, we can tell. Everybody knows Coach Ray's on them stem cells. Everybody. Why do you have to throw me under the bus like that? They said you're giving them the Bor-Bor. They said you're giving them the Bor-Bor. That's why no one can beat her all of a sudden. How awesome was she? How awesome was she? She was awesome. She's way better than... That was way...
SPEAKER_02: way good yeah another level yo and you know what someone told me that she was gonna lose and they were confident oh yeah yeah i had a word i was talking to you coach ray and devon and whatever i was like the only one betting on barbara like all right cool i thought it would be more difficult i really thought that it would be more more difficult but she just
SPEAKER_03: It's insane. I think she's going to be very, very lonely at the top. Same like Levan, right? So let's see. Yeah, but that's not the same. Like Levan's match with Devon and match with Hermes is a lot different than
SPEAKER_02: bar did to her man like good night yeah but it also took a couple years to get there for levan also you know i mean he had yeah he'd like team presidents and everybody in a couple vitalis and all of that to even get there so like maybe in another four or five years listen listen we got all all this disrespect i mean august is lithuanian and egla was lithuanian
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I was like, I brought it up. Why the fuck do you think I brought it up? All of that coming from that man. Let me ask one question to Artem. Let's stay on the match. Can you explain the Artem? Why is John Tyrion who pulled me and got completely destroyed and then pulled you and won against you? Why is he betting five hundred crown on me?
SPEAKER_02: Does it mean anything? He's a crazy man after beating me one time out of 20. Hmm.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, man, that's terrible. So you don't think it matters? Terrible news. That's terrible news, Artem. Is this true? It is true. I'm not sure, but, I mean, that's John's business. I didn't even know he had $500 like that. Keep in mind, I know John's situation. I know he ain't got $500 like that anyway, so I don't even know how much, how confident he is in the whole situation if this shit goes south.
SPEAKER_00: so you're saying if sergey next weekend loses to somebody it's not a good look for me to say that i could beat that guy no you cannot that's what i mean that's what that's what's going on here right is that what's happening here you couldn't you beat john therian the canadian come on it was uh yeah close was it close
SPEAKER_02: Not close at all. No close. Oh, man. Artem, you are fucked, yo. No, I mean, in all of my outings with John, none of them really were close anyway, except for the last one. That one sucked for me, like, after the first one. So if that's the only one I want to be judged on, go crazy. Okay, good. You heard him. You heard him. Devon't think about that. Think about me just losing to Ali. Like, I have plenty of losses you can think about. So go crazy.
SPEAKER_02: okay okay okay so you're saying that you're saying that uh john terrien doesn't know what he's talking about i see i've said i don't care what john's talking about it it's like you can it's y'all's bed over there it's your you confident that john possessed 500 which i have never seen the man how about you guys make a side effect or something i don't know if you if if both of you are confident how about you make a side bet on this one if you want
SPEAKER_03: i'm betting already this it was everybody like i already got it i mean we can go we can we can trade the prize money no you give him louis vuitton bag one of your bags you want a nice bag you better check the authenticity of that bag
SPEAKER_02: It's from Turkey. 100% legit. The guy told me. Listen, the yellow one who probably pays Lithuanian salary for like two months, the black one up top probably good for me for a year. If he sells it, his family and the kids will be good for a year and a half in Lithuania. I wouldn't need it. I'm just a straight guy and I have no need.
SPEAKER_00: i'm just saying in case i take an extra vacation not to work for a couple months you know what i mean you do got a little uh homophobic vibe going on with them purses and i will tell you that oh it's all good he does have something he does i don't blame him in his village he can't walk around with no purse in his village or he gonna they gonna get his ass out of that you stay manly here in europe
SPEAKER_02: Yeah. Well, no, no, no. The way you said it, it sounded like you're staying in the closet, Mindy, bitch. I'm sorry to hear that. It's all good. Whenever you're in Orlando, you can go crazy. Devon't get off that purse, Artem, until you win. Then you can break that bitch out. But no, no.
SPEAKER_00: listen i i like how you went up after his purses but you say nothing about his nails when he comes you know oh yeah that's the new quarterback at chicago i can't be caught on film talking about people painting their nails it's a freak country over here man okay
SPEAKER_03: I got news for you. When y'all get to Orlando, Artem ain't going to be the weirdest thing you see. Get ready. Get ready. Listen, guys. Benji Maxx sent a super chat. Lars show, Artem missed my super chat, but I'll say it again. Travis is a GOAT commentator. Left hand. See you all at the West vs. West 14. It's going to be effing amazing. Thank you, Benji.
SPEAKER_00: i listened to the todd hutchings and i i thought uh i thought that you and devin did okay on that one so i don't know i did hear some people complaining about the volume maybe early but besides that i don't know it seemed pretty look pretty good i thought devin did a good job yeah yeah i don't know i mean he ain't no travis vision there ain't no doubt about that but who is that is absolutely true who's your favorite commentator enormously
SPEAKER_01: um okay that's enough close to the top one yeah so it could also be neil pickup but um i like travis see well we understand your position you cannot say travis because otherwise you'll be kicked off arm wars and that's like your only outing well i like this east versus west is my
SPEAKER_02: Well, after you lose to me, I don't know if anything's going to call you back, man. You better be careful. Imagine you lose to him. What would it do to you? Well... Hold on. There's a good chance that it happens. It's a good question. What's the preceding comments? Is there an excuse that you were too small or you're going to have to be like, man, Artem's too strong? Actually, I didn't think about that at all. That's a good question.
SPEAKER_02: It's going to be a shock. You better start preparing for that. You better start preparing to cancel the match with Matt Mask. That's a whole different arm. I don't have to worry about that.
SPEAKER_02: okay is it okay it's left right yeah you probably should cancel that match all right i mean what the who the i just watched i guess your manager i just watched matt mask and brad brandon you must have grabbed larry wills's manager and had him take over your career my goodness hey guess what it comes to larry mills paycheck so i'm taking all the matches all right so we good it ain't worth it bro it ain't worth it but no but yeah maybe you you might have a chance if if brad
SPEAKER_02: but brad lost on the brad brad got one in the straps but looked like it's not even there for the rest of them exactly how brad looks against me so i love it i like how he said i don't think that's a real good frame of mind in that series when he pulled brad so i'd give him a
SPEAKER_00: But not that Brad's not amazing. I just don't think that was the best. No, I'm not talking about that. We're talking about them putting left-handed before. He definitely, he was dealing with some things. No, we're talking about the left arm match a couple of months before the arm wars. Yeah, no doubt. I'm just saying, I think that if, but the match with Brad right-handed, probably gives a lot of people some hope that you might be in this match. I just wouldn't do much. I wouldn't put too much on that if I were you. I think Matt's, uh,
SPEAKER_00: i think that's going to be hard to handle one for your little ass you just you just let them better than everything just like me dog is betting and you're losing to john thierry nagas is in trouble too i think that your broke arm position game is strong and it's kind of you know it's it's gonna knock him off balance i think he's too light in the ass i think you're gonna win i'm very good at um following those uh weird surges
SPEAKER_01: and not getting opened up myself. So I'll just defend for a bit. Artem will gas out and that's job done.
SPEAKER_00: Hey, that scenario has crept in my mind a few times. It's hard. I don't see you. I see you, if you are lucky enough to take control, I think you would put on the brakes a little bit and kind of give the illusion that you're some amazing transitioner, top-rolling deep, and then slowly work it. I could see that.
SPEAKER_00: But I also could see that Artem might be early just as strong as you at the top and heavier and then needing that Hail Mary at the end. I know he's got it.
SPEAKER_02: Did any of you guys meet Corey Miller? Hopefully he doesn't use the Hail Mary too early because that would not be a good thing. We really need a couple victories there. Justin considering how many that there is an issue with Corey Miller and Justin in general. So I feel like from the power standpoint, I have a lot better chance. Well, what do you think?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I do think. I do think he is. But you know what the funny thing is, is weight's the funny thing because Artem, too, has got heavier and way stronger than those guys at times in my brain. But when he got, you know, he got to watch what he eats, too, at 187, right? So...
SPEAKER_01: You know, it's going to be interesting. And Mindaugas' patience, even down 2-0, is scary as well. So we'll see how it all pans out. Yo, Mr. Terzi. We're joined by Engin Terzi. We're joined by Engin Terzi. This guy, Raimonds, he doesn't read anything I say, so I decided to enter. Good. Good.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, the reason I deleted that post, I mean, that was what Devon wrote there, just because I said, Artem is going to beat you. And he said, we have Team West t-shirt for you.
SPEAKER_01: and then so i just deleted the whole post yeah so i just deleted the whole post you know so it went outside i i don't understand what does it have to do with team west russian guy from there with winning guys so but how can you expect i like that post a lot and you know i liked it a lot it kind of tell told me what i needed to know i think he might crush you
SPEAKER_01: I think you realize that I'm way too much for Artem. And you just had to push, put him up a little bit just so it sounds like... No, I just wanted to inform people what's coming. His style, like there are some points. Like lately, I see his right arm. I don't know. You remember the last tournament you competed? Of course you do. Artem, you look more dominant with right arm than your left.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, for sure, for sure. Yeah, I was like, for a second, I even thought that, you know, maybe we should just switch the match the right time. But, you know, we can't do that. But the right time. And I'm just thinking that there has been a special, I think, round three that you get into the position with Tom's.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, in such position, you would beat Mindaugas. Mindaugas is great. Mindaugas is 77 kilo version of 85 kilotons, but not 85 kilotons, 77 kilotons. So that's why I think- I told him the same thing and he got all this, get disrespectful. So let's hear it now, Mindaugas. Say something to the boss now. Say something to the boss.
SPEAKER_01: Listen, he told you a lot of things, and then you got all defensive, Travis. You surprised me. You should have put him in his place, you know? My ego is a little bruised right now, thanks to that ad. Forget about it. I'm watching how I navigate, man. Listen, listen. Yeah, poor Travis. Go ahead. Go ahead. Yeah, poor Travis can hardly come back now after the loss.
SPEAKER_01: He will come back. Let's get back to what Inge just said. You say something to him. I want to hear it too. Let's do the boss, motherfucker. Let's go. Listen, listen. I don't understand. What did he tell you? First of all, there is no boss here. We are all friends. But what did you tell to Travis? No, no, nothing. Travis just wanted me to comment on the thing that you just said about Tomsen.
SPEAKER_01: Listen, I will tell you something. I would bet my whole life on Tom against you. Left arm. No, right, left, doesn't matter. Okay, let's go. Justin look at your match with Justin. Your whole life? Listen, Justin is my friend, but just look at his match with Justin and look at your match with Justin.
SPEAKER_01: yeah but again that match with justin i keep repeating that i didn't feel that great i can be so obviously you didn't feel great because justin made you feel that way you know like no no no it's just it was just me like my problem here we have football teams you know they play with another team
SPEAKER_01: They are great. And then when they play with Real Madrid, they say, oh, I wish I was in the same form that when I play in the Turkish league. But it is not because they feel bad, but the other team is good. Well, there is some truth in that. I mean, I can see what you mean. The dog doesn't like the comparison arm wrestling matches unless it's John Therrien and Artem and him. He don't like to run that scenario.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, let's not look too deep into that scenario. Did Engin froze? I think Engin froze. Maybe he'll be back. He'll be back. Come on. I mean the fight back. No, no, no. I like it. It was a good teamwork. I love it. I love it. Engin, you froze if you can see us or hear us. By the way, just in general, I still think that Artem is a terrible armor slayer.
SPEAKER_02: Well, hold on. We cannot judge you no more because you still think Travis is a terrible arm wrestler. That shows a lot. No, he said Travis is overrated. Mendoza is a really good arm wrestler, so that's why. I mean, I understand what he's saying, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, but there's levels to understanding of, like, what type of arguments. Like, here's the excellent, like... If you looked at my DNA, you would already expect greatness. If we took this man's DNA and then found out that he accomplished what he accomplished with that DNA, I mean, come on. This motherfucker's a genius. A genius. A genius.
SPEAKER_01: You know, I'm always judging achievements by also a little bit by looking at how much effort the guy put into those achievements. And to me, it seems like Artem is trying super hard and it's still not really working out, you know. All those needles, all those pills, you know. Artem we really helping Artem?
SPEAKER_01: Artem's from Russia, man. You can't fault him. That's his culture. His culture. We've tried to get him out of that. I'm just chilling, just chilling, just enjoying life. Minda, what can you say then about Travis? He has a machine training right in his kitchen, right there, behind him. Yeah, but he said it himself. Sometimes he just wants to show people that he's working out, but he's actually not really spending that much time on the machine.
SPEAKER_02: Travis, I'm trying to save you here. Hey, Ray, don't ever invite me to this podcast ever again, all right? I'm trying to have a good day here, okay? Yeah. I'm going to go find this piece of shit. Both you and Travis, we're going to be like, hmm. I'm like, yo, we can't let him land in Orlando, man. That's crazy. Because I cannot wait to meet you in Orlando. It's going to be so much fun.
SPEAKER_00: I have no doubts. Well, listen, guys, I'm not going to spend all my time with fucking three slap dicks all day, okay? I got shit to do around here, okay? It's Thursday. I appreciate you guys, but I tell you, man, I'm a little offended by Mendoza. Justin a little. Understandably.
SPEAKER_03: okay but i gotta i gotta um i gotta prove myself to you hang in me mean that mean that offended travis so by he's leaving okay i'm not gonna be if he's disrespecting the ball i ain't gonna be on that because because mean defended him yeah i'm gonna stick again hanging is stuck again wow that must be the first time ever
SPEAKER_01: I knew not to get on the public. I don't like... You are attacking... You are attacking the hand of, like, people, you know. It's a nightmare, you know. I didn't do it good, man. Thank you, man. We keep losing you all the time. I don't know why. Now, again...
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I don't know. Yeah, bad connection, Engin. Yeah. So Travis left. So Artem, now you're alone. Now you're alone. I'm Latvian, Lithuanian, and Engin that's froze. Man, I have no support right here.
SPEAKER_02: You have to stand up for yourself for once. It's all right. Neither one of you is over six foot tall, so I'm all right.
SPEAKER_03: I just want to know what will happen with Minda if he loses to Artem. I think if Artem loses, it doesn't make... It's a normal Saturday as far as Minda is concerned. I've been there before. Yeah, but if Minda loses to Artem, I think it's...
SPEAKER_02: well i'll be honest uh i feel like i don't like me me and you uh have enough conscious to make fun of it i think we'll hear i mean the august is typical lithuanian guy we'll hear a bunch of excuses how he you know sleep good or the arm was whatever i don't think we'll hear any respectful after post i think it will be like ah i was i the travel me up no no the thing is that i i know
SPEAKER_01: If there is a risk to lose or if there is not. And in this case, there is no risk to lose at all. I'm 100% winning the match. Especially after what I felt just recently in my practices. I feel amazing, crazy shape, probably the best shape in my life. So you're in trouble, Artem. Well, I mean, I hope so because I've never seen anything that impressive from you. So we'll see.
SPEAKER_03: you keep going in and out can you hear us hang in if you can hear us maybe i don't know try off the wi-fi or on the wi-fi but you keep going in and out all the time okay let me give a little bit of credit to artem as well oh we're all right we're all right we're all right we're all right his match with thoms was probably
SPEAKER_01: his maybe best performance with which I have seen like technically he was so sharp I'm a little bit worried like if he is able to be as sharp as he was with Tom's um I can see the danger in those technical abilities so um I pay attention to that thing and I will make sure that I can handle that yeah but I'm thinking Tom's is so much stronger than you he's not
SPEAKER_02: And I will say, and I will say, and then like, and you're kind of, uh, assuming the shape and what it's like, we kind of all knew the left-handed would be trouble, but like right-handed I'll probably say I'll, I'll, I'll probably the favorite against Tom's right-handed like left-handed. It is a trouble by right-handed. It's there's a big difference. I'm beating Tom's both hands.
SPEAKER_03: I can, this is like craziness going out of both of you. Artem saying that he would be the favorite against the reigning European champion at 85 kilos. And Mendes saying I would beat him both hands. Both arms. Both champion at 70 kilos.
SPEAKER_02: is different and like me and him me and him gripped up right-handed and it was different before you know what i mean so uh i think i think yeah his left is not as uh insane yeah we are not delusional at all you know what we are
SPEAKER_02: i think mindy is a little bit delusional i don't think he's like he's i think he's a little behind like he's with john therian over there right he forget he forget that he struggled with justin a little bit corey beats him a little bit like so you know there's there's some holes so it's all good this is amazing conversation anyway guys i think it's i love it hanging can you you look better now we can see you
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah. Do you guys hear me?
SPEAKER_01: yeah yeah listen just so you know artem just said that uh he would be two arms right hand no not beat but he would be favorite in that match and mindy said he would be two arms both arms and i said delusional series incoming whoa whoa one second one second one second i mean that was said that he would be thompson with like right and left or when he said like both hands he means like his both hands against them we will never know what i meant exactly
SPEAKER_01: Okay, okay, okay. Yeah, because he's attacking the hand and Tom's hand. I mean, come on, man. The guy's hand is not normal hand. The guy has like, I don't know, hand of steel. You know better than I do, right? Yeah, he probably has the best hand for his weight that we know in Latvia. But not only his weight. I think better hand is only Sandro's.
SPEAKER_01: yeah just imagine i mean that was trying to top roll him but i remember i think stylistically it's a bad matchup stylistically right if if mean they had different powers i still remember very well that i was pulling tom's six or seven years ago that was better you were pretty young six seven years ago too
SPEAKER_01: Did you know that 10 years ago in actual competition, I beat Sasha? Wow. Yeah, I mean, yeah. You must be stronger than him now also. I mean, yeah, he was probably stronger then. But, you know, of course, I was better. So it means that I would still beat him, you know. Come on, man. Six, seven years ago, you're telling us that you beat Tom. And come on, man.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, even from last year to this year, the guy is a different level, you know? I mean, whenever I saw him against Oleg Zok, I was like, what is happening? Is this real? And then whenever I saw Oleg Zok's left arm, I said, wow, you get him back to your old shape. You know, the arm size, everything was incredible. And the guy literally beat Oleg Zok and still gave him some hard time, you know, in the last match, as far as I remember, you know?
SPEAKER_01: Really impressive, yeah, really impressive. And you said that you would be right and left, right? Both arms, both arms. I love this. This is amazing. Anyway, so Engin, do you really think that Artem has a chance? Against you? Listen, he has a really weird, weird, weird style. You know, the way that sometimes Christopoulos
SPEAKER_01: And this one will be probably, I don't know. I don't know. It may be bad for you. I feel like I'm one of the better people to deal with that style because I'm willing to be so defensive. Yeah, but this guy is taller, bigger than Risto. Risto is, you know, 75-kilo guy in real, you know.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah. So my frame is still bigger than Artem's. Artem is just shorter and narrower. Like, I don't know. What's your idea? I have bigger joints. I have bigger joints. Good for you. Let me know if tennis helped in arm wrestling. By, by the end of this year,
SPEAKER_01: possibly the lightweight right-arm ball title will belong to someone that is not even in conversation right now. What do you mean? You will see what I mean. Justin wait for November. This is what I am guessing. It's not me, for sure. But someone who is not even in conversation,
SPEAKER_01: We'll probably hang in one question. Dave I seen him? I have seen him, right? You, you, you just see, you just have seen. Yeah, I know. Then I know. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. You can privately tell to me. No, no, no. Let's let's see. Let's see how they suffer a little bit. Let him suffer a little bit because sooner or later he will suffer at the table as well. You know? Nice.
SPEAKER_01: And then he will be like, can I go back to 70 kilos, please? Can I go down to 70 kilos, please? Yeah, I can always do that if needed. If the money is right. It's not because of the money. Listen, listen. No one's paying you. Come on. No one's paying you.
SPEAKER_01: 70 kilos is still my class, basically. But I'm just... Listen, he already looks intimidated talking about possibility of going down 70. You have to go somewhere to get a chance. 85 kilos, maybe. Samusha is there. I know that you have phobia of Samusha. Wait, wait, wait. You feel like
SPEAKER_01: I feel like if I get into these positions, like if I can take Samusha's wrist like Sasha did or Nurdolet or whatever, I can finish him as I did with Daniel. Because all the other guys are making mistakes. They don't pull correctly. Then they get tired. Maybe Samusha is stronger.
SPEAKER_01: Come on. Could be. No, but still, people are not pulling him correctly. As soon as he gets into that position, they are not efficient at all. They are wasting their energy. Yeah, for me, you need to control Samson's pronator right away. I wouldn't even worry about top-rolling him. I would just keep my pronator. I know I'm not strong enough, but you need to... Overpronation is just suicide, you know?
SPEAKER_01: you need to control his pronator and with this bottom two finger in the bottom wrist standard, you need a little bit back pressure. Artem you guys hearing me? Yes. Yeah. You guys don't hear, right? No, we can hear you. We can hear you. We can hear you. Can you hear us?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah, you just need to attack over his pronator and make his palm face up. You overpronate, you're missing his pronator. There is no way, you know. Unless you have incredible shoulder pressure that you top roll him, you take him to your winning side and then bring like Krasovski's can do. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know. You either need to control his pronator and go sideways and beat him, or you really need to have a very good shoulder pressure. If Aydar Khan, if he had a shoulder pressure, I mean, he could have beat him, yeah. I think right now what makes sense is Aydar Khan versus Vladimir Mairo, and then the winner takes...
SPEAKER_01: the title shot against Samusha. So you're trying to say that Vladimir Major takes the title shot against Samusha, right? Well, I think it's also a match. Murdoch was close. You think Vladimir can beat Aydarhan? That's my guess. That's my guess. I mean, incredible things are happening. Incredible things are happening.
SPEAKER_01: like, I don't know, especially 105 category, who is going to, do you guys think that if Devon is 105, he can beat Petrenko? I would say that it's difficult. I think because Petrenko can fight without his hand, he has a lot of pressures going sideways and a lot of back pressure, right?
SPEAKER_03: So at that weight, it would be difficult for them, and especially Devon that we saw now. If we get Devon in shape, and I think everything's possible with that man, Devon is still... When he's one on five, will he be strong enough? Also, who says that Petrenko is losing his wrist? I mean, look at Dadekem match, look at Ongarbe match. No, no, no, I mean...
SPEAKER_03: I mean, if he loses, he's very comfortable without, even if he loses, and I think he can stay flat. He doesn't really sometimes cop. He kind of stays flat, and that's very dangerous, right? That's very dangerous, especially with someone with the style of Devon. The thing is that Devon will, of course, lose a bit more power than he expects if he tries to go down in weight. So you all have money.
SPEAKER_03: where there's always that quick spot you know um if devon is losing too much muscle suddenly it's maybe not that effective yeah but i never bet against devon in lower weight classes yeah i still would bet devon i think devon because it's so hard to be like how many times he has lost to a smaller guy or in a smaller weight classes especially recently right i don't know i remember he versus tatashins
SPEAKER_01: And then I remember Tatachins versus Dadikyan. And now I remember Dadikyan versus Petrenko. I mean, I don't know. Especially with the rules that Devon Sheldon used to be above the table. I don't know. I don't know. But it's an incredible category whenever you look at it. And now Irakli. Irakli is pulling Tautiev. What do you think Minda was?
SPEAKER_01: Oh yeah, that's a match. I like Tautiev so much. Gheorghi is crazy good. Yeah. I mean, Gheorghi lost VRL Dobrin, but it was 85kg category. Gheorghi's performance is increasing. I don't see VRL Dobrin beating Tautiev in 95kg.
SPEAKER_01: But when it is 85 kilos, the guy is two meters tall. I think he's too skinny for that category. And when it is 95 kilos, then we're talking about something different. And what do you guys think, Raimonds and Artem, about Tavutier versus Irakli, which is the next world title match in 95? Artem has to go, so Artem can... I think Irakli is a little too big right now.
SPEAKER_02: i feel like like you'll see you'll see cool stuff from georgie because he like was he's capable but like as you said like losing to dobre like i feel like he loses here and there inconsistently in my opinion to where like he i mean he it's a good match but i think iraqli will be the favorite in my opinion because i think he's a little bit bigger right now and he i mean he got way better i think too yeah i think iraq
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, because of the style matches. Koenig pulls a little bit low hand most of the times, right? Because he's so tall, depending on what kind of opponent. And if Irakli can stay high, that's the antidote, low hand, you know.
SPEAKER_03: high posting top role and he's he's getting better like i really believe iraqli is getting better and better he used to just curl now he pronates he takes the he's doing everything a little bit better um but and it's top row versus top row and is really great at dealing versus someone who want to gets inside and if that is not right before artem goes i want to ask two other things
SPEAKER_01: One is Devon versus Vitaly. When Devon said that recently his wrist wasn't really ready. And then do you think that Vitaly is... The Vitaly that I saw in Istanbul, I don't know what you saw Artem, but I saw it like a little bit more muscular than what we have seen in the past, you know. His shoulders, you know. Vitaly looked crazy, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, just imagine him just like being five more percent better. And with Levan's current injury and not super shaped wrist, do you think that the things may be different if they pull, just say that end of this year?
SPEAKER_02: right because vitalik being a little bit taller than everybody else a lot taller right like it's wonder yeah if if the match stops vitalik probably has more power than anybody just to finish it a lot easier and make it look like less of a match probably so so yeah
SPEAKER_02: yeah i think if he does and it's it's it probably gonna look a lot worse right like even even if they're like five percent apart right maybe like if if human arms were really close if they're gonna be just like as close i think the match not gonna look as close because how much more pressure vitality can apply with that height i think he'll be able if he does get in that position he'll finish it a lot faster in my opinion
SPEAKER_01: so and the the last match i want to ask you jerry versus alex kurdecha oh man
SPEAKER_02: I don't know. It's hard to bet against Jerry. I think Kurdecha is the guy. Kurdecha definitely has all the tools, right? Because you have to be smart with Jerry. You can't just go on top of him or do anything like that. So you have to be a little bit more careful. And Kurdecha does have the size and the tools. So he'll probably be a favorite from a technical point, and he has the power. But you can't count Jerry out.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, yeah. So I don't know about the score, but I think Alex is the favorite. So you're going to say Alex is going to win? If I were to bet my money, I'll bet a little bit amount of money on Alex, yeah. Justin a little bit, not a lot. Like me and Douglas has a massive salary.
SPEAKER_01: so you you have to leave now you are in yeah it's five o'clock i have to have to practice because you know mid-august kind of seems like he's a little strong so i need to get a little stronger i will also ask novice the same questions levan versus lalatin and alex versus jerry well what can we say like clearly lalatin is our next hope i guess
SPEAKER_01: seems like he's he he showed very good result good shape against um morozo so seems like there could be a chance for him to get a good shot at levan and then with jerry and alex i just i really have no idea if jerry is even training i have not seen him anywhere so you didn't see the photo that i shared today
SPEAKER_01: okay that one i saw but um otherwise he's at his biggest and strongest okay if that would be the case then um it's a good match and i would almost like to see jerry being successful in that beautiful flop okay
SPEAKER_03: Rymons, you want to add anything? No, no, no, no, no. I don't want to talk about matches that are in the future. We have this event. I want to focus all my energy on it. I want to ask Artem. Ryan versus Rymons. Yeah, you know Ryan, right? You know Ryan. Belanger. Yeah, yeah, yes, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: yeah so i think it's a good match i think i don't i think uh ray has more experience however is ryan's size and all and kind of being a lot more active right like i feel like ryan was a little bit like a couple years ago but now you can see he stepped it up he like showing up everywhere pretty much i mean taking those challenges you know everywhere uh winning whatever he can put his hands on
SPEAKER_02: i feel like it's it's a good matchup 100 as far as i'm concerned raymond is the favorite and i can't be wrong but i'm pretty sure he is the favorite but uh i think ryan will be in it it's not a mismatch whatsoever but if i were to bet my money i'm betting i'm betting uh coach ray's money i i i think ray is underdog here yeah i i
SPEAKER_02: like 95 you know that is 60 86 87 maximum he will be 90 and i don't think he can beat the guy ryan is um not the most normal build for sure he does have long arms and all that so he's a he's a billiken arm wrestler for sure so it's not the easiest match
SPEAKER_02: But we'll see. I'm not quite sure. I'm not quite sure with the Power Alliance, to be honest. That's all it is. But I will not be surprised if Ryan is in it. I don't know. We'll see. We'll see. We'll see. I mean, I may be wrong and I don't mind being wrong over here. I said one match so that, you know, that will be already plus one for the Team West.
SPEAKER_01: right yeah right i mean i'm all about see i'm i i'm the first one to to watch coach for you to lose no you have to ask me twice i'm all about team ryan yeah just by the way guys uh did uh artem did you get any stronger after losing to raimon's i remember he lost to our raimon's at some point right i lost a lot i lost a lot of people
SPEAKER_01: i did it did i win right hand tournament and end up in a place higher left hey when you pull the guy from canada john you said that like you he beat you last time but you also beat him
SPEAKER_02: i beat him well we pulled like i don't know like five times in our lifetime and i won all of them except for the last match so you're saying it might be just john getting better
SPEAKER_02: I never I never thought that John is weak because I really liked seeing him Like I watched him pull like 80 kilos and go up and I like I really liked that thing I didn't know there's many people can beat him really Watching him coming up. I thought Man, I really was kicking pumped too much in the second of their rounds I really feel like I mean he was he pulled me really better because we talked like time before we are mess with him and
SPEAKER_02: I was in so much control. I was like, dude, you have to, like, I was talking to him mid-match. I was like, dude, you have to topple me because this hook shit ain't working. So he then toppled me in the B side. And like, so I was talking to tell him what to do. And he did do that during the super match. So his strategy was definitely better and he was stronger. I didn't like my whole pump feeling, but yeah, overall, I mean, I never thought, I never thought he was, he was a big dude anyway. So. Artem, Artem, he just got stronger.
SPEAKER_01: but even stronger than the time that he lost against Mindaugas. So there is nothing to worry about. The time that Mindaugas beat him... Well, no, no, I don't care about that. That's Mindaugas living that. When Mindaugas beat him, you were also beating the guy.
SPEAKER_02: So now he, he leveled up. So he would probably be in diverse as well. You know, I lost to Ryan Bowen. There's nothing else can scare me in my life. I don't care what my dog thinks. And I'll send him my losses. I lost a way more funnier people than that. Like you're picking up. I think John Therian is a, is a weak point. I'll give you some better ones. And yeah, that's exactly the reason why it's difficult for me to pick on you too much because you are clearly just,
SPEAKER_01: committed to the grind and it's so yeah yeah that's how you should do it so i mean the only difficult part of your life that's going to be is realize that you're going to lose to the guy that loves to ryan bowen and that's that's a lot to swallow that thing another thing you're ready so god bless you well i wouldn't lose to ryan bowen but uh and i'm not planning to lose against you so let's see
SPEAKER_01: i know you're not playing on it but you know it's a good thing to think about that entertain some thoughts you're good for your health good for the mental health look i'm just always willing to accept all kinds of challenges even though i sometimes think that it's going to be too easy it's still fun to just go through a match and enjoy armors i'm all about your positive attitude
SPEAKER_01: Mindaugas, is your mind still a little bit at what I said that, you know, end of this year that we will have a different lightweight world champion? Yeah, I wonder what are you talking about? Do you think that such thing is possible or is it not possible that someone just shows up and beats everyone?
SPEAKER_01: I love all of you. Engin, I love you. I really have to go back. Bye, Artem. Minde, do you think like someone that probably you have never seen before or never heard before, do you think him to just step up and then win the world title? Okay. I think I know who you're talking about. I think I know. It's the Turkish guy who is tall and has a huge right arm.
SPEAKER_01: now you are on it yep yep he looked scary during that qualification oh you watched it you watched i watched that so that's possible that's possible and this guy only beginning you know at the nationals use of one by fouls i don't know if the fouls really existed or something but
SPEAKER_01: Ready go, ready go. It was like this and it was probably five months ago and the guy is still very new.
SPEAKER_01: in you it's still he might need more time i don't think he will do it that quickly it's still difficult for him to go through daniel to go through some different tough stylistic matchups yeah i just can't wait you to try to top roll him you know i will i might be in the biggest trouble i i feel like daniel might trick him in his own way um i don't know he he will top roll
SPEAKER_01: will topple i i i if he wins the wolf and he's doing now 75 kilowatt i didn't say the category and it but he's not gonna he's not gonna pollute like he he pulled the youth he just like okay so he goes seniors now right directly yeah if he wins his next match is directly for the world title
SPEAKER_01: okay okay yeah because i i don't want you guys to feel bad when you pull him so i want you to pull him while he's the champ so that you will like okay i lost a not a new guy you know use category guy you know i'm just wondering if he can really stay in that class for much longer just because he's uh you know he's young he's so tall i'm sure he will quickly
SPEAKER_01: That's all your hope, I understand. If he wants to get the dollar, he should do it now, because it will most likely be too big. Raimonds, do you realize how he just expressed his way out, you know? He's like, oh, the guy is so tall, he can't stay there, so the title will be ours. It sounds so desperate, sorry, but you know.
SPEAKER_01: I also felt the same thing when Sasho said that, oh, I'm not going to stay in this category. I will just beat Samusha and go up. That would be very bad for 85-kilo category if Sasho would beat Samusha and then just leave the category. And then whoever wins that category, they will say, you know, okay.
SPEAKER_01: like we are not really champion because the guy came, beat all of us and left, you understand? So Samusha kind of saved the honor of the category. Like the last time I talked with you, you were like, oh, I don't want anything of Samusha. Now you sound like you can beat him. What's going on? Yeah, just because I feel like I have a good way to deal with that style.
SPEAKER_01: plus maybe i can take his hand do you believe that do you believe that like this way uh yeah if i reach that position i'm very confident i hope you could like defend this way against both idarhan and sasha um it's a very tricky style if you don't if you are not fighting correctly against it um
SPEAKER_01: maybe daniel can do it because it's really it matters so much on the correct um way of pulling if you don't do it correctly it's so it's difficult to finish whereas you just cannot finish if you did you listen what what uh prokopchuk said if he would pull against you again he would top roll you did he say that yeah yeah yeah okay cool whenever we had a podcast with
SPEAKER_01: Bojidar, if I'm not mistaken, I think he said it there. He said that, yeah, next time, like the way that he top-rolled Alain Zoller, he would top-roll you. Fantastic. That's great. I just see that as him giving me more time to do my thing, and it's just easier for me. If he doesn't go aside immediately, it's just more time for me to execute my move. Not that dangerous, not that dangerous.
SPEAKER_01: I'm told my couple will be more efficient. He cannot auto-pull me. He cannot? No. I remember one time he tried at the Lithuanian Europeans. You flashed him and somehow he got a foul and then second start he went inside, you know. I remember, yeah. He must go inside and he must do it super quickly. If he gives me time, it's difficult for him.
SPEAKER_01: if i cannot make 77 kilo but if i somehow can make 85 kilo you still want to pull me uh yes of course but will you be you know like oh but you know no i will not complain you you can even be uh 95 if you want to no complaint egg it egg it
SPEAKER_01: listen you're talking with the goat see he has no he's it's it we live in a different world than him you know that so man just like like i'm too strong i'm too strong i mean like whenever whenever whenever i i feel i i just try to imagine me pulling you like the only thing i see ready go i stay like this and then you try to topple me and your wrist goes like this like like i don't know whenever i think about your wrist
SPEAKER_01: Like, I'm like... It's a very different time knowing him. Like a waiter. Now you're doing the same thing as I was doing with Tom when I pulled him six years ago. So we cannot look into the past. Come on, man. You were Zloty champion. You were Zloty champion. It's not the same thing. This is the future. So many guys, like you just beat Artur Makarov.
SPEAKER_01: even once now you couldn't even beat him once you know so i mean so i i don't see much progress you know like just beating after in 2018 and then 2024 just zero four and you were just talking all kind of don't worry yeah after after losing to artem yeah i will i will beat him for you and then just don't worry that the engine that you talk just
SPEAKER_01: made Arthur's wrist like this, and then because of the bicep there, I lost. And then you couldn't even pin him once. I need to get that rematch. I need to get that rematch. Rematch? You need to beat someone before that. Before that. Okay, so... Maybe... Listen, if this guy, Ömer Faruk, wins the WAF, he's pulling Arthur Makarov. After that, you can have Daniel, you can have
SPEAKER_01: whatever whoever you want you know yeah don't worry about it and then yeah we will see i think i think this guy if he makes 85 kilo i think he will be you know big threats for even for some trust me but also it's not that easy let let me see some matches with him and some top pullers sometimes uh it's still not that easy even when we have such a huge arm
SPEAKER_01: But do you know what the thing is? The guy is very new and he's progressing very fast, quick, very fast. He's the guy is just progressing. Like, I mean, he's not the same guy that he was two months ago. He's not the same guy that he was five months ago. So he just, we will see. But what I hear, you know, what I hear he's living very near me, you know, 45 minutes.
SPEAKER_01: But because I haven't been training, we didn't have any practice or something. But there are guys that he trained with, you know, just like heavy guys. And the guy is just becoming more and more problematic for everyone, you know. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, so that's all I wanted to say. You guys be careful. I know that you will have a bad night now after you're hearing this. But just, hey, 70 kilos is always there, you know, as you mentioned, you know.
SPEAKER_01: No, no, no need for that. I just need my match, my rematch with Makaro and I'm good. Yeah, okay, okay, we will see, we will see, time will show. You guys will have all the matches that you want, you know, because you guys are serious. I love to tease you. In this community, if there is one guy to tease, you know, it's just like you, you understand? Whenever you are involved, like, I like to tease, but...
SPEAKER_01: trust me i have huge respect for you even though i tease you you're armless and able to use everything and you are you use your superstar in any match that you wish you will always have it you know you know that yeah yeah anyways it's cool yeah yeah we're gonna we're gonna finish up we're gonna finish up guys don't forget it's uh artem taranenko minda augusta recites east versus west
