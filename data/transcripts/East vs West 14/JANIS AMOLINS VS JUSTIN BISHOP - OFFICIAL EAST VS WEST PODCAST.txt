SPEAKER_02: Yeah, okay, okay, and we are live now. Friday afternoon in Riga, it's like 8 p.m. or 8.30, yeah? Yeah. Summer's here, so it's fine. We get a little bit of summer here, so it's nice. That tan right there, boys.
SPEAKER_01: Yannis, how is your time going? Excellent. Yannis, as always. By the hand of my wife. I'm as done as I can be, probably like best I have ever been.
SPEAKER_02: so everyone we're we're here for east was best official podcast um if you was there watching alex kudecha jerry we thank you we continue with janice and justin um so let's start uh how you guys doing let's start with justin i know more about the honest than justin let's start with you how you doing i'm pretty good brother uh
SPEAKER_00: Can't complain about today. It's only like mid 80s. Usually it's like close to 100. So, you know, my shirt's not soaking wet yet. So I can't complain yet. Are you working outside all day? Yes, sir. We'd be on the deck today. So it's helping me keep my weight down so I don't have to worry with water cuts and stuff. So it will be more or less same weather in Orlando. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, probably a little more sunny. Probably not quite as humid. Probably humidity is probably the same, but you get the ocean breeze there. You don't get that here. Is Orlando so close to water? I think it's a little bit inside, huh? Yeah, but you can drive like an hour and a half either way in Florida and be at a beach. For me, the coast in Alabama is like four hours.
SPEAKER_02: Okay. I'm looking at the map. You're closer to Birmingham? About an hour and a half east of Birmingham. Okay. If you look at the state of Alabama and you want to point at where the heart would be, that's where I'm at. Okay. Gotcha. Between Birmingham and Montgomery.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, slightly north of Montgomery, in between Auburn and Birmingham. Yeah. I think the whole state of Alabama is as big as Latvia for sure, right? Yeah, I think we got, and we're actually one of the smaller states. I think we're like 5 million people. Okay. I think Rhode Island has almost that. You know how much you are in Latvia? You know population in Latvia?
SPEAKER_01: No. We're like 1.9 or under million. Yeah. All Latvia. You can walk like anywhere and be noticed, right? Yeah. Easy. Everybody knows the Jedi, right? Yeah. You can speak Latvian on street in USA and then it's like, no, it is still possible that there is some chance that someone will understand you, but it's very little.
SPEAKER_02: Not so much, but still a strong nation. Okay, you guys have a big match. I want to hear Justin's thoughts about the first time you met. We have talked in length with Yanis about the match.
SPEAKER_02: the UAL event that was put on because World Bar Championship was canceled, things like that. Giannis said that he expected you to be like a beginner from Alabama. Everyone said you're strong. He was like, you know, because Giannis was the reigning world champ at that time, so he didn't expect anything.
SPEAKER_01: There were so many great guys at that time and I didn't expect Justin to be a top contender for a win. At that time, 2013.
SPEAKER_00: Let me see. You still there? Yeah, yeah. Okay. At the time, I'd only been arm wrestling. So my first tournament ever was 2011 in March. I think that tournament was 2013 in like August or something like that. So just over two years. So really, I didn't even know who Giannis was. I knew who Carlos was only because he had pulled Alan Fisher off.
SPEAKER_00: And I knew almost none of the Europeans, but I knew what I was doing at that time in that class. And in my region, it wasn't even close at the time. And I got a sponsor to buy me a ticket, because I was pretty broke back then, which I'm not too much better off now. But first time on a plane, too.
SPEAKER_00: Well, since I was like 13, so first time as an adult on a plane. And I remember I got there, probably one of the better shapes I've ever been in, really, as far as total body, because I was running and stuff like that, which I hate doing. But I was, let's see, I'm trying to remember. I walk into weigh-ins, and it was the first time I met Devin, Todd Hutchins, like a lot of these guys I've been watching.
SPEAKER_00: And I remember Bob Brown come up to me. It was only, I think, the second time I talked to him. And I'm talking to him. And Giannis walks by. And I remember Bob Brown looking at me and smiling. And he's like, first tomorrow. I just kind of looked at him and smiled. I was like, that little guy, he ain't beating me. What are you talking about? That's what I was thinking. And then my mind quickly went back because I had pulled Baskin.
SPEAKER_00: six or eight months before that, who whooped me, who's even smaller. And I just remember like, I don't know, man, you know, because I'm looking at all these other guys, you know, physically, they look, you know, stronger. And anyway, I think that's why I was so pumped when I beat Giannis, because I didn't even know he was the number one guy at the time. I just remember all the people that I knew from America was basically just writing me off.
SPEAKER_00: That was one reason I was so pumped when I actually won. But I don't know. I was trying not to be disappointed because the prize money went from 20 grand to 500, which was the only reason I came, to be honest. I'm glad it worked out. It ended up working out in my favor because
SPEAKER_00: I was one of 12 people who got signed on with UAL on a contract, you know, and only been arm wrestling two years at the time. So I was, you know, over the moon about that. But that, you know, back then Luke was the guy and Allen was the guy and I don't even think they placed top three. So, you know, I still got that recognition from my own country that I was, you know, looking to achieve.
SPEAKER_02: yeah it was it was definitely like big moment in arm wrestling right and uh the video has gone viral for for years right already and i think uh like you said it it worked out in your favor eventually right um so now you guys will have a rematch uh before we go to your match
SPEAKER_01: If you back to 2013, the thing was like, I was, I won 2011, 2012, 2013 WAF Worlds. At that time, I was like, I think three years in a row,
SPEAKER_01: not losing almost a single fight in a pub and I went to USA and then Justin showed up and like I said, I felt like, okay, I remember talking with Devon, talking with Bob Brown. I said, okay, this guy is good, but I still thought that, okay, it's like some beginner from Alabama and we'll be fine. I will find a way and I was surprised.
SPEAKER_01: that my main move was not working well against Justin and I was surprised. Of course, there are times when you are not at your best and maybe it has happened
SPEAKER_01: two or three times when I travel to USA that I don't feel too good and that's a big worry always when you go somewhere abroad and somewhere like USA and I said to Ray today we talked with him that I can't change shape you are showing up but I have to think about
SPEAKER_01: factors which can give me some trouble and one of the things of course it's acclimatization, temperature, humidity, diet, how I will cut weight if I'm in trouble and all those things and it can happen but the thing is I went back two weeks later it was WAF Worlds in Poland I think right after that event and I went back to Poland two or three weeks later and I won easily with Wadi McPhero
SPEAKER_01: Bartusevich, David, who else was a head tag from Russia, they're like strong guys in a class and they won easily that class. So definitely that time you were in elite shape. Yeah, I think two things. The inexperience really played a factor, you know, obviously only two years and a couple of months.
SPEAKER_00: And blind refs, really. Blind refs really killed me that day. Yeah, because I don't know what Harold Ryden was looking at, but I seen your hand hit the pad. Yeah, but it's all good. Referee is always right, you know? Listen, you know, one of the very rare times
SPEAKER_02: yannis was intentionally going in a hook you made him do that because he said like on a first he still tried his best moment he's like still didn't work and then he ended in the hook but the last pull right the second third third pull he initiated a hook which we don't see that often at all
SPEAKER_00: I was done, but he burned me out in that second match. I knew it when I walked off the stage. And, you know, we pulled a couple times since then in WAL, and he actually top rolled the crap out of me. So, you know, he made good adjustments over time. And I haven't beat him again right-handed. I beat him left-handed. But I think actually that same day he beat me left-handed at the UAL event.
SPEAKER_01: and then i think that was the last time you beat me left-handed yeah yeah yeah yeah i was not feeling too good that day and i i pulled left arm as well i think i won against you in the first round with left then i pulled maybe someone and uh i gave up against and uh i think i didn't went out in the semi-finals against lukia king that i even didn't went out i just said okay i don't want to pull left
SPEAKER_00: yeah you should be his left pretty easy no but i didn't felt like uh ready to to do some i don't know challenge or or or yeah didn't felt in my best yeah i did that pretty recently when i pulled that round robin as a 12-man round robin and i only had really one good you know uh match where i got opened up with eli and i got caught slipping
SPEAKER_00: You know, I got caught sleeping and anyway, I was like, I'm good. You know, I can pull the tournament. And I didn't really think that it would be five hours later when I got the pool and my arm was much more sore than I thought. So I ended up, I won the first match, but I could tell the whole side of my arm was just throbbing. And I ended up pulling Hunter.
SPEAKER_00: And, yeah, when that match was over, I was like, I just laid it down like it's, you know, I just pulled it to, you know, for the tournament. You know, it's what they want to see. Let's go. I'm here, you know. But it didn't work. Your last pull on East versus West was versus Tuomas, right? Mm-hmm. Okay. Before that, Mindaugas.
SPEAKER_02: So yesterday I had a very interesting conversation with Artem and Mindaugas, right? So they are pulling. I want to hear your thoughts about that match because, you know, you clearly know them very well. I mean, I think there's some lanes for Artem. There's definitely some lanes. I don't think Tom's hook is nearly as good as his top roll because my hook's not great and I felt great with him in a hook.
SPEAKER_00: Which I will say, technically, technical-wise, I've gotten much better in the hook. I just really didn't know what I was doing for many years in a hook. But I think Artem beats him in a hook. If he can get him there, you know, that's the problem. I don't think Artem's going to top roll him. He may, you know, he may surprise me. I'm thinking Mindy. I'm sorry. He's pulling Mindy. I was thinking he was pulling Tom's.
SPEAKER_00: But I think it's about the same scenario, to be honest. But how many people have you seen hook Mindy? I can't recall many. And even when they hook him, it's more they're flat. They're not here. They're still flat. But Artem, I'll say Artem's got a couple of different really good moves and really good setups. And they look the same. So you never know which direction he's going.
SPEAKER_00: So he's good at disguising them. I think if Mindy takes him too lightly, he could be in for a long day. I think it would surprise some people that Americans can actually technically arm wrestle, some of us. We're not all just real ripped up beef, pretty guys. American. He's an American citizen.
SPEAKER_02: Okay. Okay. He pays taxes. You allowed to say you were an American. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. It was crazy conversation they had yesterday. And I asked about the weight limit and, uh, uh, Artem said it's 85 for him. And I asked, uh, and Minda said it's 77 for me. He said, I put a limit on myself just to make it fair. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know. I mean, you know, I will say I've seen Artem pull really, really good. And then I've seen him, you know, show up and not really be there. But either way, he's usually technically well, you know, he's sound technically, especially in a strap, which, you know, all those are Mindy's strengths as well. So it'd be interesting to see.
SPEAKER_00: And I'm glad that he got a warm-up, I say a warm-up, at the East versus West with Tom so he can see how, you know, get a feel for how they ref and so forth. Because it is different, you know. And if you haven't been refed by European refs that much, it can throw you off a good bit. And same for, you know, Europeans coming here. I'm interested. Oh, yeah, it's very different. Because we got kind of, you know,
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, we know. Justin talked about how his hook has gotten better. What do you think? Is he preparing to hook you? We'll see. Tomorrow we will have a good practice. Ray will be there and Tuomas will be in that practice. I'm on Centernović, so I can test my hook against Tuomas tomorrow. We'll see. Maybe I'm ready to...
SPEAKER_00: We got a little practice scheduled for tomorrow. We got Artem coming up. Doug's coming up. Daniel Worley. I think he's going to make the drive. I'm not real sure. So we'll have a good practice. I mean, I'd be lying if I told you I thought I was going to come in there and hook you because I'm not. I'm probably going to top roll your eyeballs out.
SPEAKER_01: Probably what's going to happen. I know armwrestling and I've seen quite enough of you so probably there will not be big wonders for you what I'm doing and same for me what you are doing. It's a question about who will be stronger that day.
SPEAKER_01: We'll see. It could be over quite fast. It could be longer. I see some advantages in both of those ideas for me. If it's getting longer, it's maybe not that bad for me. I'm usually quite good with endurance. If I'm winning quick, then in the third round, I could ask you to get inside. So maybe. We'll see. We'll see.
SPEAKER_01: I see some scenario also, like there could be difference, but I see also some scenarios that in a third round, I take your wrist and also like ask you to, do you want to go inside? It's not very possible. That's the nicest way I've ever got trolled, man. Yeah. That's the nicest, like it's hard to be mean to you. Usually, you know, I don't mind talking trash, but for two reasons, it's hard for me to do it to you.
SPEAKER_00: the most the one reason is because i know what you can do because i've experienced it you know and uh i respect what you have done and uh secondly because of that i mean how do i how do i insult that you know or have a comeback you know give me somebody who's gonna talk some some heavier track man i'm gonna tell you my prediction i think it'll look like the first time we pulled that's what i think
SPEAKER_00: So you are taking first round and then I coming back in the who can beat you next now all three all three will look well to be I've already pointed this out. I pinned you Even but here's the thing even if you give me that pin I got two wins you got like seven or eight So, you know, you still left even if I win this three to three zero You're still up a couple pulls. So I
SPEAKER_00: But I will say this is a match I've wanted for a long, long time. The last time I was talking with Engin, I threw out three or four names that I would like to pull, and you were one of them. I wanted to pull, I'll tell you exactly what I asked for. I asked for Mindy, and what's his name, Arthur? Is that his name? Ricardo. Ricardo.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, him, you, or Histro. I think I said that right. Yeah, Bulgarian. Yeah, and honestly, I just wanted to pull him because I thought it was an easy match. But, you know, I actually pulled him after I pulled Mendy on the side table, so I knew it was a good match for me.
SPEAKER_00: But I don't ever want like, you know, just a walk in the park. I want to pull somebody, you know, I don't want to do all this training just to pull, you know, somebody I think I can beat, you know, or I know I can beat. But, you know, it doesn't matter who it is, who they give me. I'm going to feel confident in what, you know, what I can do. So.
SPEAKER_00: But when he told me you, I was like, I'm game. So let's, you know, set it up. Let's go. Because I think it's been it's been almost eight years since we pulled. Yeah, we did 2013, 2000. What about 14? Not sure. No, it was 15, 16, 15. Yeah, we did the WAL qualification and also 15, maybe finals or could be finals.
SPEAKER_00: 2015 finals, and then we pulled in 2016, I think in the regional thing. And I think that was the last time. Yeah, probably. Quite that old yet, but it's getting there. See, I think the difference in my mind in this match, the biggest difference,
SPEAKER_00: is my experience from then to now. I had one move then and I have several now. Even though you may not get to see them because my other moves work, they're there. I think even with the Tom's match, you may have seen a little glimpse of what I can do in other areas. And I really feel like if you weren't there, I'd have beat him. I don't think he'd have changed his technique as easily as he did.
SPEAKER_00: because as soon as he's seen i can hang with him in a hook he starts sliding back you know i'm like i don't know if i can top roll that i mean if i can hook that and you know i worked the piss out of my hook for that match but you know one thing i didn't do a lot of was setting a hook you know from the go i knew my arm was strong but
SPEAKER_00: i i thought about it all the way home i'm like trying to remember how much time i put into uh you know practicing getting there and it wasn't it wasn't a lot so so there is a chance that you will have to show me all your three styles in istanbul
SPEAKER_00: every time somebody asked me about this match i tell him i said i'm gonna have to beat him at least two different ways if i'm a win at least two i said yeah you know he's like myself and even more so because you know you probably got like 70 years experience or something but
SPEAKER_00: it's reading what somebody's doing, you know, which angle should I go? Which direction should I go? You know, and a lot of times with you, your setup looks the same, whether you're going back or whether you're going side or, you know, I've, I've watched probably every video you got online, sir. Very nice. I'm a, I'm a,
SPEAKER_01: I said before to you that I love that you are well motivated and preparing seriously for this fight. I always, always also excited that someone is taking this seriously and I love challenges, so it's good. It's good. I can't say that I don't have motivation. Engin has asked me for a fight in the East-West a few times and I want qualification and somehow it happens that I...
SPEAKER_01: had to or did decline a few matches, so I was just waiting maybe for the right opponent in the right time and I believe it will be fun. It will be fun and I'm really looking forward. You're making me blush, man. Who did you turn down? Oh, he turned out everyone.
SPEAKER_00: To be fair, I've turned down in the last, prior to about two years ago, I'd never turned down a match that was going to pay me. And not even a lot, just pay my way. I've never turned down. It didn't matter who it was, really. It could be some nobody. I always felt like if you're the guy and they're willing to pay you, go. But the last two years, I've turned down probably seven or eight matches stateside.
SPEAKER_00: because, uh, to focus on, you know, more international stuff. And, you know, I don't say a lot when they start talking about all these guys over here, this is the best 76 guy, even though I'm sitting here thinking, no, he's not, you know, whatever. Uh, you know, I'm letting them, that's why I'm not on the rankings. I told them, take me off the rankings, you know, cause my goal is not stateside anymore. I've reached that goal two different times. And, um,
SPEAKER_00: You know, I'm focused on guys like Giannis, guys like Mindy, guys like Arthur. You know, I'm seeking to be the best in the world right now, you know. And I will tell you this, this is the longest, this is the most consistently I've trained in probably three or four years. Usually I would train two, three months and then, you know, it'd be deer season. So I take three months off because we eat lots of deer. And so I go hunting a lot.
SPEAKER_00: And I don't know if you guys hunt or have ever hunted, but it takes hours. You know, it's easy to overtrain if you're not used to that, your central nervous system. You know that. Yeah. Well, I've taken the last week or so and really examined my body and I could tell, you know, I was overdoing it in certain areas.
SPEAKER_00: And I can tell I'm not getting enough rest. So, yeah, when I tried something new for that round robin I pulled. So usually I won't arm wrestle for two to three weeks and I'll work out to like three, four days out. For that one, I took a solid three and a half weeks off the table and I took seven full days out of the gym.
SPEAKER_00: And I felt great. And I've arm wrestled a lot this year, like practice. I practice long, long practices, smart practices. And I can really tell my endurance is a lot better. My gym lifts are not quite as good. I think it's a result of being on the table more. But I would rather be on the table more than in the gym. It seems to be helping my arm wrestling a lot more than the gym does.
SPEAKER_01: But yeah, I'm well with you right there on overtraining. I think I've done that a lot in the past. Yeah, it's true actually that we are not getting younger and probably we need more rest before competition, more rest for our central nervous system. And like at 20, you can do training to almost...
SPEAKER_01: last week you can still before pull a heavy practice and you can lift just few days before and know also I need more rest and more time for recovery before big competition. And you are talking about all this experience and everything. It's true, but it's also true that that is some advantage for you that I'm probably not getting younger and you could still be in your best age. I'm 43 this year.
SPEAKER_00: It's not like too much, but still it's not making it easier. You said 43? Yeah, I'm born in 81. I thought you were older than that. Hell, you're not even that much older than me. Not that bad. How old are you, Justin? I'll be 35 next month.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, yeah, well, do it. You know, looking back on 2013, so you were in your prime. I was still a puppy. See, now the roles are reversed. I wouldn't say you're a puppy by any means, but, you know, you get a little lag in your walk, you know what I mean, kind of thing. Now, I can definitely tell since I've hit my 30s that I don't heal like I used to. You know, I'll say I can retain strength more. Seems like, you know, I got that old man strength, as they call it.
SPEAKER_00: Uh, but I definitely do not heal like I used to, and I'm not nearly as good to care. Good to care. Yeah. Pain tolerance is better though. I'll give you that. Cause you're just used to it. Yeah. I honestly hurts for first, uh, first, first 10 years. Then you just get used to it. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: That's who it is. You arm wrestled two-year experience, Justin. Now you're going to arm wrestle 13, 13 and a half year experience, Justin. Still, it's just probably less than half. I did first world, first European, end of 90s, so I'm like 25 years on international stage, more than 25 years. You said 90, like 1990? 1999.
SPEAKER_01: In 1998, I won in the end of the 90s. 2000, I pulled WAP Volts. 1999, WAP Europeans. 1998, I won in Latvia. I qualified for Europeans, but I didn't win. Good times. I don't know. I think just because we're talking about the differences then and now, I'll say one of the other differences for me is...
SPEAKER_00: been pulling a lot stronger guys like the last five years like heavier i won't necessarily say stronger i think a lot of them probably were stronger not nearly as smart and as quick as yourself but you know walking around 200 pounds uh kind of guys and so you know they're um like like i don't think this the hand size and things like that are gonna give me any trouble and uh i think
SPEAKER_00: don't know i think me walking around and pulling middle weight for a couple years too because i was walking around about 185 190 then where i walk around now about 178 that you know my uh i believe my tendons got stronger during that time you know and coming back down i can tell you know
SPEAKER_00: I don't know, grabbing smaller guys or guys my size is new to me again, you know, because I'm used to grabbing, you know, guys like Storm Celino and RVJ and people, you know. So I'm going to be kind of heartbroken to get beat by a guy that's shorter than me.
SPEAKER_01: You got to say something, man. Making this awkward. I believe it's all true, but I also saw what Tuomas did to you and I saw what Mindy did. You did not that bad against Mindy. You had a chance, but still with Tuomas, I'm practicing with him. I know what I can do against Tuomas, so that gives me some good confidence. You know Tom's weaknesses and stuff.
SPEAKER_00: Last time I seen you with Mendy, it didn't look too good. With Mendy? Yeah. It was kind of, you know, he looked like he had the better hand. When who pulled with Mendy? With you. When you pulled Mendy. In a competition.
SPEAKER_01: trying to think because I honestly I've watched so much footage the last couple days because it's been raining here so I didn't really have the truth with Mindy we haven't pulled in the competition since 2017 and we pulled and we just have pulled in the competition maybe three times
SPEAKER_01: I won our first time, I don't know, a long time ago, 2014 or what. Then in 2015, he won me once in one competition. That's the only time when he has won. And then in 2017, I won against him again. And we haven't pulled since then. We have pulled some practices, but last time I pulled, I won against Mendy.
SPEAKER_01: i i don't know uh i don't have this video to prove i think it was in rig open it was mindy and vlad vlad krasovsky blood destroyer yeah in a class and me and i think i pulled in a row at first i won against vlad then i won against mindy then vlad won against mindy and i won against vlad in the final i uh i remember what it was i was watching um
SPEAKER_00: It was a practice video with you and him in 2019. Oh, we have done a lot of practices. Yeah, yeah. I don't take a lot off of practice. Don't get me wrong. There is some...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, and I have to be true, Mendy is super strong and that's what you did against Mendy. He's very impressive and you know that, right? Just a short time after that, he won against Daniel Prokopchuk and he was for some period East-West World Champion and you were 2-2 against World Champion and you were ahead of him, 1-0, 2-1. It is impressive and stylistically...
SPEAKER_00: He played his cards right. You know, he kept working that up, you know, and that's something I'm going to bring up, too, is let me get y'all's thoughts on it. So if we're in a ref's grip and they're putting on the strap, right, they tighten it down and we're in a referee's grip and you start doing all of this, you know.
SPEAKER_00: All of this motion. Like, is that not a foul? I mean, aren't we in a referee's grip? Depends on refs, right? It always depends on the refs. Christo was a ref, yeah? Both times for me.
SPEAKER_01: I'm going to request he's not this time, but... Yeah, I will ask Hristo to do our fight. I think he will be in Orlando as well. He will be the only European referee in Orlando. So, clearly, he's going to go back. Yeah. Because some of the guys will be like, you know, Jan, it's Paul. Yeah. It's easy. It's good that referee knows the fighters and Hristo knows us. So, yeah, it sounds fair. It sounds fair.
SPEAKER_02: i don't know that guy i mean what do you mean you know how it is i believe because we're doing like this is professional or or this is entertainment matches more than anything else right this is not super strict if it would be waft or something you would be in like yeah out or
SPEAKER_00: But they don't even give you fouls if you false start. You're right in referee's group. They give you warnings. Yeah, I mean, I get it. But at least something. You know, honestly, and this is not excuses. I'm really just telling you what I think was the turning point in the match. Because it was a chess match. If I got the right setup, I beat him easy. If he got the right setup, he could hold me long enough to gas me out. So it was really whoever got what.
SPEAKER_00: But the thing is, and I kept going from low hand to high hand, same thing he was doing. But I could tell, you know, I could tell my arms blowing up. And I really just wanted to yank the strap off and walk off and, you know, give me a second. But I guarantee if I did that, I'd get fouled.
SPEAKER_00: But to be fair, for that particular match, I trained about 10 weeks. I climbed out of a deer stand and went to training. And I felt good. I'm not going to say I didn't. I think Egan keeps saying that we did it at like 80-something kilos. The weigh-in was 180 pounds. And I'm walking around under that right now and probably stronger. Probably, yes. Only 10.
SPEAKER_00: I really, yeah, it's not gonna be a big water cut for me, baby. I'm gonna walk in there, maybe shave off like a kilo or two in water and no problem. Cuz I've been getting ready before he even told us about your match. I seen what I could do with Mindy. And I'm like, I can win this belt. If I take this seriously, I can go get a belt for my country.
SPEAKER_00: And, you know, because Mindy's arguably the best top roller in that class right now. You know, if you look at the top rollers in the class, which there are not many, most of them hook or go real fast sideways. If I can do compete with him like that on eight or nine weeks of training, you give me six months of training, I think I can do even better. You know, it'll be.
SPEAKER_00: We're going to find out, but that was my thought process. Is it possible that after our fight you will say that Yannis is the best top roller in our class? Hey, baby, if you beat me worse than he did, I will gladly say it. But I think you're going to be saying I'm the best top roller in this class. You are very close. You did one first round and third round. If I get what I want, I'm a dangerous man.
SPEAKER_00: you know you know that if you get you want you can know super heavyweight guys you know how it goes all i need is this much exactly exactly and uh yeah that's what i try to get to the american arm wrestlers around here because a lot of them are really really strong they don't put enough time into analyzing setups and you know and strap work and things of that nature they focus on continuing to get stronger
SPEAKER_00: And I'm like, that's all fine and dandy when you're strong here. But when you end up here and you're no longer strong, I said, you gotta win the match before the go. That's the most crucial match to win. And there's a few of them picking up on it around my area. I mean, it's, I don't know.
SPEAKER_00: I really wanted to start back putting my YouTube videos out, kind of like you guys do, teaching arm wrestling. I don't care nothing about all the drama that goes on. I don't even follow half of these pages. It really gets on my nerves. But I would love, when I first started, Devin was putting out videos. And even though a lot of them I wasn't really grasping what he was saying, over time, arm wrestling, it would pop in my head like,
SPEAKER_00: That's what he was talking about on the bad side of the strap, doing this and whatever. And I think we can get more younger guys focusing on that. I think as a country, we could be way more competitive.
SPEAKER_01: About that point, armwrestling USA, and I have to say that that's actually what lightweights right now in East-West is missing, is to get more attention, is some really strong guys from North America, from USA, and you...
SPEAKER_01: Hunter, maybe Doug, Jeff Hale. It would be great to get more of this action from the USA. And I think probably even if really some contender for top place would show up, that would be great for a lightweight armwrestling, for more attention. Because right now, I kind of think that the strongest guys are in Europe.
SPEAKER_00: There's no doubt. Anybody who says otherwise is just retarded. Because, listen, if you're not outside of you, I mean, most of these guys are coming from these small European countries, you know, like Bulgaria and Georgia, places like that. You know, they're not huge countries, but they have the way they train and how seriously they take it.
SPEAKER_00: know and i think some guys over here take it serious they just like i said in the wrong areas you know they're constantly trying to get bigger uh you know we all want to be stronger but that's only one aspect of the fight you know being faster working speed drills working strap work you know working setups like sometimes we'll go to practice
SPEAKER_00: And we work nothing but set up for the first 30, 40 minutes, just setting up. And do ready goes, but just to position, you don't even go this way. And then we may do at the end of practice, we'll do timed matches where if I can pin this guy easy, well, I just hold him in a defensive position for 30, 45 seconds and then go. And I find doing that too, you don't get hurt as much, you're much more healthy.
SPEAKER_00: Because you control everything. Yeah. And not to say we don't do ready goals, but normally when we do, it's at the very end of practice. When everybody's tired and, you know, loosened up, you know, it's a little more, it's a little easier, it seems like. Yeah, yeah, of course. Practice is not for winning, it's for practicing. It's for getting better enormously and then you train to improve. That's absolutely true.
SPEAKER_01: Absolutely true. Justin, do you think right now you are number one around that weight in like, if you talk about, I don't know, 170, 176 pounds in the USA? No question. What about Hunter? Easy day for you, Doug?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, Doug, he normally beats me if he gets his hook in and I beat him if I get my top roll in. We actually haven't competed in a tournament in years. I would put right now from what I'm seeing and what I have felt is I pulled a bunch of the guys that I went to when I went to the round robin in February. I pulled a bunch of those guys after.
SPEAKER_00: And I realized they were tired. I actually didn't want to pull some of them because they just pulled 11 matches. But I pulled the guy that got hurt, I think. Very close, very close. You doing homework? Yeah, sorry, sorry. Just I couldn't understand where something opened up.
SPEAKER_00: But yeah, I pulled a couple of those guys. And like I said, at that time, I was about two months back in the training. I was about five, five, six pounds lighter than I am right now. I didn't have a problem with any of them, like to the point where I'd let them go in a strap, you know, and they'd have me here and I'd still just, you know. So, I mean, if you ask me where I think I'm at, I think my mind easily.
SPEAKER_00: number one in america at under 176 pounds right now and that's not a knock on hunter or any of the other guys who are you know uh competing there i just know what i can do i've proven what i can do um you know i've had a couple of guys reach out to me and want me to arm wrestle some of these guys and uh you know honestly i'm at that point like i was saying earlier if it's not
SPEAKER_00: decent amount that I'm gonna make because I'm gonna miss work I'm gonna have to take flights and all this other stuff if it's not worth it to me I don't because used to I would do it to prove to myself I could do it you know that's that's always my purpose it's never to prove anybody else wrong really I want to prove to myself that I'm right and thinking I can do this
SPEAKER_00: But I don't see it. I think, I mean, while I think Hunter is probably the best active guy on this side of the pond, as far as going around pulling American tournaments, I just personally, I don't think he's got enough tools in the tool bag to beat me. I think it would go something like mine in your first encounter. He may surprise me out the gate. He may not. But at the end of the day,
SPEAKER_00: I got the right tools in my bag to crack it open and win it. I've seen what some of these other guys as well, like Dalton Duncan, he trains with me almost every week and he's easily number two or three right now.
SPEAKER_00: And I know what I can do with him. You know what I'm saying? So he's probably got the best top role on this side of the country other than myself right now at that weight. You could argue Luke or somebody like that who really never leaves California, which that's, again, why I took myself off the list because I don't really go anywhere. I don't want to hold anybody back. But I don't think.
SPEAKER_00: I'd be willing to put up several grand on whoever wants it. You know what I mean? And I've always been that way. If I feel that way, I'll say it. And it's no disrespect to Hunter or anybody in that camp or anybody else listening that pulls this class. You know, if you take it as disrespect, good. Go get your money and come holler at me. It's good to hear. It's good to hear that I'm pulling strongest North American right now around that weight. So.
SPEAKER_01: so i can say i'm like uh after after orlando after augustine i can say that there is no one in usa who can beat me under that way that's not bad that's not bad guys uh one of the guys you just arm wrestled um austin austin yeah
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, you know, he was, you know, and him and Hunter like to, you know, they like they kind of like me back in my little bit younger days. They like to talk that trash because they've been going to these local tournaments and, you know, killing people. And and I get it. You built that confidence off wins. I get it, baby. But guess who they called to stop these hype trains? They call me. And guess how many of them's been stopped? Every one of them.
SPEAKER_00: You know what I'm saying? I can name guys throughout the last seven, eight years. They call me, oh, this is the next best guy. I go up there and they don't even move me off center. So, you know. Austin is a strong kid. He's a strong guy. And he still has to learn a lot, a lot in this game. That's the thing. Physically, he's strong, but still learning. Yeah, and that's my thing. You know, like you beat him with your bad arm, bro. You know, can you imagine what I'd do to him with my good arm?
SPEAKER_00: Come on. I mean, like you said, he's strong. He's a big kid. He's probably close to being a little bit too big for the class, but I've been there. You just need to quit lifting heavy, control your diet, maybe start doing a little cardio if you want to stay in this class. Because he's where I was five years ago or so.
SPEAKER_00: He's a little bit too big for the 65 to 76 class, but he's too small for the 98, 205 class. And for me, when I was in that situation,
SPEAKER_00: I was beating a lot of the top 76 guys and the guys that I hadn't pulled yet never wanted to pull. And then WAL wanted me to pull middleweight. So I just go up and pull middleweight. And it was a lot easier for me, a lot more fun. I don't have to worry about my diet, you know, weight or any of that. I just walk in and, you know, but I will say, you know, it eventually got to where I'd walk around that heavy and my feet would hurt, you know, my back would be hurting.
SPEAKER_00: walk up a flight of stairs and be huffing and puffing you know so i was like you know i definitely like this weight better uh you know i'm actually flexible i can tie my shoes and stuff so yeah helps helps uh i want to ask because i'm pulling also late addition to the card i'm pulling uh ryan ray ray we're talking about our fight what hey listen
SPEAKER_02: i have this big big man of justin he's in the chat doug ellridge is in the chat ryan bellinger is also in the chat so uh justin uh what can you tell me about this guy right ryan we will do our homework and we will prepare and watch watch what you are doing so yeah but still all right number one
SPEAKER_00: i'm i'm on the west team bro i can't give you any information nothing number two i don't really have any you know i i'll be honest be honest the last two or three years guys have come through that i really don't know you know it's so hard to keep up especially uh you know since my son's got older so i got three kids all over you know four or five oh i got
SPEAKER_00: Actually, I'm about to have two teenagers, so I don't have time to keep up with all of it. That's why, honestly, I unfollowed a lot of arm wrestling. It just seems like it's a bunch of middle school women on there just back and forth.
SPEAKER_00: oh my god like that one play was arm wrestling uncensored or something like that i'm just like oh my boy one time i'm just like scroll back go to something else you know it's mostly people that haven't that are not really into community they're just looking from the outside and they think this is how it is when it's never like this right and it's it's a few of the guys that are doing kind of good
SPEAKER_00: And they've only been here, you know, maybe two to five years. And they're all of a sudden experts because they're top 10 in America. And, you know, all this other stuff. Because, you know, when I was there, right, I would go to tournaments. And I would find the best guy there. And I would go over and ask him questions. I didn't go over there and tell him stuff. And that's what it seems like is happening now. You know, like I'll make a comment.
SPEAKER_00: And somebody will just basically tell me, I don't know what the hell I'm talking about. And I'm like, who is this guy? And I'm not even trying to be like, oh, I know all. But I'm like, who are you and what kind of how did you gain this knowledge that you just said? It sounds like garbage. So the difference is right now the Internet is so full of different stuff and videos about training and everyone is talking. So
SPEAKER_01: that's the difference when you started there were some information but still it was like uh little and the internet was when i started there was no internet at all it was just some some gossips about what others are doing and and someone some heard something some rumors but not really like uh
SPEAKER_01: uh some much information so uh it's big difference right now you go somewhere and people people who you have never met they know almost everything about what you have done on table sometimes they remember more than you do right that's crazy you're just getting old man that's all yeah that's why we live in a different age now it's different age
SPEAKER_00: There's too many feelings, too, man. That's the thing to deal with. I used to talk trash to Luke because he would just come out. He'd take a year break and come off and pull something in California. I'm the best 76er. I'm like, where you been at, bro?
SPEAKER_00: know and he'd talk some trash to me and i'd tell him he was an emotional wreck and he'd need to go you know get his uh period medication and he just go to crying about how i'm talking about his mental health and i'm like what i thought we were talking trash what happened you know but i just i tend to be quiet now because these a lot of these young cats don't they don't know how to take me so you know i try to be
SPEAKER_00: I'm not that sensitive, so all good. No, I know, I know. You just get horrible, horrible trash-talking speeches. Passive-aggressive. Yeah, thank you. Thank you. I don't know how to respond to it. I want to talk trash, and then I'm like, I don't want to be disrespectful because he was nice to me. You're one of my favorite arm wrestlers, if not, you know.
SPEAKER_00: I pulled you more than any other European. So we, we got, we got, I got some personal history there and it makes it, you know, makes it that much more for me. Uh, it's going to be a really good feeling slapping your hand to the pad three times. I'm going to remember that for a long time. I want you to know that. Good.
SPEAKER_01: I like your motivation and that's actually, that helps me as well. That helps me as well to get a little bit more excited and more motivated, definitely. I didn't talk for more than like 10 seconds when Engin asked me about your fight, so that's good. I feel the same. Stop it.
SPEAKER_00: hey did devin back you up on this match no and you know what let me say this before it gets too far out there i did not make the video because he didn't pick me because he hasn't picked me like the last six times the video because he didn't pick not a single american that was facing a european not one like how are you going our team and i get i'm giving my honest opinion but check this out man in your position
SPEAKER_00: You could motivate so many of these guys just by picking them. And not to say that's gonna help them win or whatever I'm saying, but it definitely ain't helping them when you're picking all the other guys. Come on, bro. I'm gonna be honest, you asked me about Mindy and Artem's match. I'm honest, I didn't pick Mindy though. I mean, but
SPEAKER_00: anyway i thought i thought it was about dude i didn't even think about it to be honest i watched the thing when i was working out as soon as i got done working out i made that video when i got home so i probably should have thought about it a little bit but some of my best stuff uh
SPEAKER_02: What does it mean for USA to have this big event coming back in a long time, right? It's been a long, long time. It's been a long time since we had an event this size and this many Europeans coming over. Probably since UAL 8, maybe. We lost Justin? We lost picture, Justin. I can hear you, I think.
SPEAKER_02: No sound as well, Dan. No. Okay, he's back, he's back. Yeah, we see you, we see you. Yeah, I'm going to put it like this, so it's better. Can't hear you now, Justin? We can't hear you? No. No sound, Dan.
SPEAKER_02: feel like justin is slowly turning to michael todd okay he'll be back he'll be back he'll be back yeah but we should also i think uh what is like 59 minutes we are online like we should slowly end it up as well yeah yeah let's let's get him back and we might
SPEAKER_01: i want to go for some evening evening swim it's still like it's nine nine seven here nine nine p.m and it would be nice to go for some swim okay let's wait for justin you guys are uh nice and not nice at the same time you can't you can't be uh in some way
SPEAKER_01: And I know him for years and we have a good relationship. Of course, we will not be like friends when we will pull each other, but we will be friends after a fight. And that's no question. Yeah, it's always like this. So before we wait, Yanis, tell us, what do you think about Michael Todd, Kamil Jablonski? I haven't really think about that yet, but it's right arm.
SPEAKER_01: Right arm. Right arm. And we know that Kamil's biggest weapon is left arm. I have seen him pulling a little bit with right, but I have no idea how strong his right is comparing with left. If his right is somewhere near his left, I would say Kamil is a favorite, but I'm not sure about that. Yeah, I hear me now.
SPEAKER_02: yeah yeah yeah we just we were passing time just to get you back we gonna we can end this because i know you have to get back to work and everything i'm the el jefe bro i don't have to worry about that
SPEAKER_02: uh yeah and finish what you were saying about uh events coming to usa what does it mean because i see so much noise in in like online talking about this and i think uh england said we have already sold more tickets than on any other event before which is amazing and i think challenger series did a great job on you know so it's going to be very similar to that so
SPEAKER_00: I think right now in America, obviously, there's no bigger league. Probably worldwide, there's no bigger league. And we have been in a drought since the WAL crashed or whatever. So what, like a four or five-year drought?
SPEAKER_00: on this side of the pond for a super big event with a major league. And, you know, personally, I feel blessed to be a part of it as many times as I have. And I would say it's probably the biggest one since, as far as Europeans coming, since maybe UAL 8, which was in 2014. I mean, we had some Europeans over –
SPEAKER_00: for WAL, but it'd be like a handful of them. You know, uh, I think UAL eight had like 20, you know, if you include, uh, people from Brazil and, uh, you know, some of the Canadians that never come across the border. Um, I know my class that year had like 38 people in it and, uh, only like half of them were American. So, and, uh, I had a really good day that day, but, uh,
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, for me, and it being in Florida, people love the vacation in Florida. It's about a seven hour drive for me, which is not, it's about the furthest I'm gonna drive. But it's not far. Actually, I'm gonna go with a buddy of mine who is gonna pull the tournament and his family and I'm gonna bring my family. And we're gonna make a little vacation out of it.
SPEAKER_00: know because i'm cheap you know we got to do arm wrestling and vacation so uh but i think it means a lot as far as american arm wrestling goes you know i mean like you said these challenger series a lot of guys are showing up um i know it's got a lot of guys uh motivated who feel like they did enough to earn a spot so you know they're doing a little bit more uh because they believe they can be that guy you know for example like hunter
SPEAKER_00: You know, he's been going around and doing really well. And, you know, he believes he's that guy. And so now he's getting an opportunity to further showcase that. How did it go? You know, I don't know. But either way, he's getting the opportunity.
SPEAKER_01: And I'm glad to see that, man. I'm glad to see younger cats coming up, you know, and it ain't all those old dudes. Generally, like if we're talking east-west is doing like right now, great, fantastic job for armwrestling and then sport is growing. And it's good that right now we will have next stage in USA and I hope it will help
SPEAKER_01: not only for armistice in the USA, but also for all worldwide that just get more attention and get more some impulse for further growth. So it's great. It's great. I think it's really good that we have somebody who's as passionate as you. Absolutely. No, because I mean, you've been involved in a lot of the other organizations that's been stateside.
SPEAKER_00: And while they've been really good, you know, tournaments and really good competitions and things like that, you didn't have somebody who had the knowledge and the passion for the sport leading it, you know. And I think that made, you know, look at the matches. The matches are that much better based on that alone. And, you know, and I do like the fact that he's having the other guys who were –
SPEAKER_01: you know very popular and other things like uh leonardis and uh school boy and uh and they are strong in arm wrestling that's the thing it's not yeah look at leonard is his his tank it's crazy strong and uh it's very possible that uh he will be favorite against john in this fight very yeah
SPEAKER_00: But where I was getting at was you bringing in all of that audience who was following them from another sport and now they're exposed to arm wrestling. And that's something, well, I didn't like some of the stuff that WAL did in certain areas.
SPEAKER_00: That is needed, the sellability, to be able to sell to people. I love the fact that they went straight to refs grip, I didn't like how they done it. But it eliminates 30, 40 seconds of just something me and you would be dissecting, he's trying to do this and this. People who know nothing about arm wrestling, it's boring.
SPEAKER_00: You know, they don't want to watch a guy set up for 30, 40 seconds, slip, walk around, come back, set up again for 30, 40 seconds, you know. So it speeds it on up a little bit. But, you know, I like the way Egan's doing stuff. I think he's doing a fantastic job. And anybody who is freaking in the hospital, bro, you know, and still doing the stuff he's doing, y'all better leave me alone if I go to the hospital.
SPEAKER_01: I'll be calling my phone and, you know, want me to jump on a podcast. My man's doing it willingly, you know, so. You have, you have to be a little bit crazy to do great stuff. That's how it is. Like a normal stuff for normal people. And if you need something, you need to be a little bit like different. That's how it is. We could end up this with a good words about east, west and England, because they have to go as well. Yeah. Guys,
SPEAKER_02: whole world is excited for this match i'm very excited i can't wait to see you both getting on table on orlando uh august 10 east versus west 14 don't miss it we all gonna be there we're gonna have fun it's gonna be amazing event thank you justin yannis guys stay strong oh man
