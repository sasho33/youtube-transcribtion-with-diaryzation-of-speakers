Host/Engin Terzi: hello hello hello everyone okay let me share this link first and then one second uno secundo
Unknown: One-off safety.
Unknown: Okay, guys, I'm sharing the link on social media and I'll be with you guys.
Unknown: okay guys very soon dennis will be joining
Host/Engin Terzi: guys please don't be writing the same things all the time that i will have to put you okay as you wanted put user time out what is that 30 minutes boom okay wow i'm putting time out and then well hopefully chat is gone that's good yeah let me tell you this gets to me
Host/Engin Terzi: Okay, hello, hello, hello. How are you? Good, good. And you? I'm okay. So, how is everything? Good? Let me see the big bicep.
Host/Engin Terzi: Which one? I mean, you know the big one. Yeah, that's good. That's really good. Some difference, but not super difference. It doesn't look like you just had a surgery or something. Yeah. Coming back. That's great. I mean, like arm wrestling for 99.9% is not...
Host/Engin Terzi: a job. It's not a profession. Yeah, we do it because we love I started early 90s. There was no money, nothing at all, you know. And, like, if you lose your job, you find another. But if you lose something you love, you understand, then just it hurts. So that is, I feel very bad when when somebody gets injured.
Translator: because i know that the guy is doing it because he loves it you know yeah i started in 1997 that's you know on very amateur level but uh yeah i've been through the arm wrestling call my life basically you know since i was like what 17 and now i'm 44 it's uh
Host/Engin Terzi: 27 years and yeah it's a lifestyle definitely yeah yeah yeah if you understand arm wrestling and if you like strength sports and if you like to like competition like it is combat you know it is not like just weight lifting and it is impossible to
Host/Engin Terzi: quit arm wrestling you know just you I mean you you will be part of it in in some way you know yeah always yeah that's for sure yeah and in probably five minutes um Dennis will join sure yeah and let's see how his life is going and when he can be ready but I'm telling you I mean
Host/Engin Terzi: It is no good to be selfish if the guy can't compete at the really, really, really like top 10 level. I mean, no need to be selfish and push him, you know, to say that, I mean, come back, you know, just, I think that everyone should do what they need to do, you know, that is because nothing more important than health. That is for sure. It's a little bit questionable because look at John.
Translator: at some moment he was the best in the world overall there was you know he was the best right number one overall and then uh he continued competing in his weight categories and you know he's he's uh still very top athlete but uh he's far away from being top 10 in the world right now but he's still doing this enjoying when you say he's far away you mean that from the
Host/Engin Terzi: Open category. He was best overall at some point. Yes. I think he has been best in overall probably in more years than anyone else.
Host/Engin Terzi: maybe not not all the time but some three four years here some two three years here you know all together yeah absolutely so you know and he stepped he stepped back a little bit and he is still enjoying the sport and uh you know in uh his way and he's doing it still yeah but i will tell you something john is different like i don't think that i would enjoy everyone
Host/Engin Terzi: I would enjoy watching anyone else outside of top 10 level, as I enjoy watching John. I'm not talking about overall top 10, even in their weight category, because, I mean, what made John is not that he was only strong, he was only best or something. The way that he arm muscles, even, you saw the video, right, that I just shared with Irakli and him. I mean, just I...
Host/Engin Terzi: watch it maybe 50 times in the last few days, but 20 times in a row. I just check what he's doing, how he loses his wrist, but he still puts pressure here. He still has the pronator. I mean, you just watch and learn. Look at the match. When was it? Lars year probably, right?
Host/Engin Terzi: Yeah, you're talking about a 59-year-old man, and he's making me watch 20 times in a row, and his opponent is like this level athlete, you know, and he's in his best times. So, yeah, so that is why I say maybe there are a few guys that I would still like to enjoy, but not many people, just because somebody is
Host/Engin Terzi: strong it doesn't mean that i enjoy watching that guy you understand yeah some people are like machine you understand and then when they can't win anymore you still see that not super high level technique and also not that level of success so it does not do so much attraction you understand but with john john it doesn't matter you know john is each other's doesn't yeah
Host/Engin Terzi: But you understand my point, right? Yeah, absolutely. No, absolutely. Yeah, he is what he is. Yeah. See, like, there is something with mankind. Mankind cannot imagine something that he has not seen. They say, oh, there is the horse with the wings or something. They never seen, but
Host/Engin Terzi: but they have seen wind and they have seen horse. So it just makes them together, you understand? So about arm wrestling, like I can't imagine anything better because I haven't seen it, you understand? I need to see it and then I say, okay, this is better. That hand control, that smoothness,
Host/Engin Terzi: the table IQ all together, you know, I haven't seen it. I mean, I hope someday I will see, but... I don't know. I don't know. It's complicated to be on that level, you know, or better. How much better can you be than John? I don't see anyone close. I mean, you just try, you know, like for last 30 something years, I always try to say that, okay, maybe this is the guy close, you understand? And this is the guy that's close.
Host/Engin Terzi: it is just like we are forcing ourselves to make it like maybe this guy is our hope or something, you know, but even, even there are so many great guys that, that the performance, the smoothness of the performance, the smoothness of the transition and everything together is just nothing like that. I think Dennis came. Yeah. Dennis is coming. Yeah.
Translator: Some people are suggesting Denis versus... Hello, Denis! We don't hear you yet. There's no sound yet. We don't hear you. There's no sound. Oh, yes, it's connecting. It's connecting.
Translator: Yes, it's connected. Say something. Oh, hello. Yes, yes, now we hear you. Do you hear me? Yes, I hear you. Good. Yeah, good, good, good. Justin turn the... on. Hello. Hello, hello, hello. How are you? In short, there is a whole gang here. Yeah, Denis is there. Put you there. Denis, try to turn the phone sideways so that we can see you in a wide format.
Denis Cyplenkov: Oh, beauty. Super. The sound is gone again. The sound is gone, Denis. Damn. And I can hear you, Alena. Yes, yes, yes, it's back. Yes. In short, we filmed the training, filmed the video, in short, our armature is flourishing. Pop-arm.
Translator: And everything else. And this. And seven hours with you, the phone almost sat down, I had to turn on the car to charge it. I see, okay. Yeah, Denis is saying that they've been filming a lot because they have that company Armatura now, and they're popularizing arm wrestling. And they've been filming, so the phone was dead, and they have to sit in the car now to charge it. Yeah, okay, okay. That's good, that's good.
Denis Cyplenkov: How are you, Denis? Good? How are you, Denis? In principle, everything is fine. We rest in the summer. Massages, droplets, vitamins, the sun, sleep. Well, in short, I decided all summer. Well, I do physical education and, in short,
Translator: While he's frozen. While he's frozen. While he's frozen. While he's frozen. While he's frozen.
Translator: The sound is interrupted, but I heard almost everything. Somewhere a little bit in connection with the questions. Damn, there is no other connection, yes. I see. Well, it's okay, we'll figure it out. Let me quickly move on.
Translator: he's saying that everything is very good uh summer sun uh massages ivs a lot of rest uh he's saying that uh he's have some minimal physical activities just for health purposes and uh he he feel very very good without any you know excessive physical uh yeah
Host/Engin Terzi: So he doesn't really push his limits, and when he doesn't push the limits, he feels better. That's what I'm saying, yeah. Maybe that's the best thing for him, you know. Engin says, well, yes, when you don't strain too much, you immediately start to feel good. Maybe he says, that's good, don't strain.
Translator: ah the connection is not good is there anywhere that they can like maybe
Translator: move with the car closer to somewhere or is this mobile or denis maybe you have an opportunity to move a couple of meters because it freezes there is almost no connection there is an opportunity you just don't understand where is better and where is worse maybe there is some kind of wi-fi in the gym there is a wi-fi
Denis Cyplenkov: Now what? Now it seems to be. Let's stand here. Let's. And then we'll see. Come on. What's there? In short, I say, in general, in general, lightness, mood, nothing hurts, everything is great. So overall, Denis said, I'm very light, nothing is, there is no pain, and everything is super good.
Host/Engin Terzi: Yeah, so it looks like he doesn't plan to have like really top 10 level elite matches, but would he consider like maybe a little bit like less pressure matches, like just say against someone like Leonidas or I don't know, like some other guys?
Translator: Denis says, as I understand it, now you don't want to go to such super matches in the first ten, maybe you want and think of some lighter, but interesting matches with such, I don't know, for example, with this Leonidas from Germany. He says, I don't know, we'll come up with someone. Maybe you'll be interested in something like that too?
Denis Cyplenkov: No, well, I think in this case, of course, again, yes, training, going out on some scales, of course, damn, you will have to look at the situation. Of course, I'm interested, they told me here that, in principle, in principle, all the organizers or ... Do you hear me, Alya? Yes, yes, I can hear everything well. Now he's gone. Now he's gone, Denis.
Translator: um okay what was he saying he was saying that yeah well for the very serious weights i cannot do right now but uh i'm interested if the organizers uh will be you know will be working on some interesting matches i would love to you know to consider
Host/Engin Terzi: He's talking about interesting matches, those really top 10 level matches? No, he's talking about not top 10 matches. He said, listen, if organizers will be interested in some cool matches, I would be interested too. Oh, okay, like celebrity type of matches. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think that would be a good way to keep him, you know, part of it, yeah. Absolutely, absolutely. That is good, you know. Anything else he said?
Translator: no then then he got frozen i think maybe it would be interesting to see him and brian show let's say nah brian needs a little bit more time i believe but after just say this like maybe a year later a year later it would be good i think yeah okay
Denis Cyplenkov: Yes, I heard, Denis, that you said that yes, if the organizers are interested, then you are not against it, I heard that. Yes, I just reviewed, I understand that trying to go there, you know, when they offered me for the first time, they immediately offered me the favorites of the category. Well, of course, the organizers offered, well, then what, let's choose him like this, at such a level. And now they told me, well, damn, stop and get in there.
Denis Cyplenkov: To get to the top as quickly as possible. To get to the top as quickly as possible. To get to the top as quickly as possible. To get to the top as quickly as possible. To get to the top as quickly as possible. To get to the top as quickly as possible.
Denis Cyplenkov: gradually, but at the same time, somehow, some kind of arfaits are more to do, I don't know, according to the situation, yes, that is, you understand that this one is strong, it's too early for him, with this you can more or less fit, right? Something like that. Yes. Yes, my friends tell me, that is, they already weigh 10 people for 150 kilograms, they have such a weight, it's already kind of hard in this regard.
Denis Cyplenkov: Dennis is saying that you know what to get
Translator: top peak form quickly and let's say to try to pull the van uh he will just damage himself so yeah he's saying i would rather go there slowly
Translator: And most likely that I will not damage myself, but I may gain a big form a little later. In the meantime, I would like to organizers to consider for me, not let's say top 10 matches, but let's say next 10, who is, you know, there is very good athletes there, very strong. And, you know, why not? Absolutely. If somebody wants to, an organizer wants to. Yeah.
Translator: Yeah, what does he think about someone like Dave Chaffee? It would be classic. Because Dave is not in his best form either, you know. Engin says, listen, what do you think, for example, about Dave Chaffee? There would be a classic match, Dave is also unfortunately not in his best form, but you already have an interesting story. What do you think? I'm just saying... Well, of course, like...
Denis Cyplenkov: I understand that he is not in the top 5, and maybe not in the top 10. Why not? Of course, such options are considered. I understand what conditions he is in. But it's hard for me.
Denis Cyplenkov: You know, it should somehow gradually, or somehow with positive dynamics, you progress and you understand that you are really progressing. And then it turns out that you go out on some serious scales and you begin to break, you understand? And you understand that, probably, these forces will be enough for this, but this will definitely not be enough, you understand? And here, somehow, this is how it is now, on scales, this is the topic.
Denis Cyplenkov: That's why you consider it this way. Of course, those who can be weaker, but at the same time, why? The fight should still be interesting. His fans will still be cheering for him, for me, my fans. It doesn't matter who you fight with. It's clear that everyone wants you to fight with this or that. But damn, I'm not in those conditions. Go lose. I understand that there are not enough working weights for him today.
Translator: then he's saying that yes absolutely why not and he is also saying that uh listen I understand my conditions and Dave is probably not top five maybe top ten maybe not even top ten today and he said this would be very interesting match and he said absolutely yes because I understand my conditions right now I see my working weights and if somebody is pushing me to the top five or two you know to no no
Host/Engin Terzi: He's saying, I just cannot do it right now. No, no, nobody is asking. Listen, can you...
Translator: Is there anything more to translate? Yes, and he said, listen, if I will go step by step, in the meantime, I will have some cool matches with guys who is a little bit weaker, or let's say similar to my condition, it would be a very interesting match anyway, and I have my fans, he has his fans, you know, it's gonna be... Yeah, yeah, yeah. I need to do a couple steps. Yeah, yeah, just tell Dennis that regardless, if he competes or...
Translator: He doesn't compete. We love him, both as an athlete and as a person. Can you tell him? And I will ask him something else. Thank you, thank you.
Translator: And I want to ask him, what does he think about John Brzenk vs Leonidas match? He saw Leonidas' match with Skolboy. What do you think about the match between John Brzenk and Leonidas? Dave you seen the match between Leonidas and Skolboy? Yes, I watched it. I understand what you mean. It will be interesting. Definitely.
Denis Cyplenkov: In any case, Leonidas wants to win. He is younger, stronger. In this case, I understand that John has had losses lately. He may not be an experienced striker, but he is very strong.
Denis Cyplenkov: Will John's experience help? I don't know. Leonidas is very strong. I don't know if John is playing with power. I don't know. Because he's good.
Translator: he said that yes he watched the match and he said that it's going to be very interesting one and he said that leonidas is very hot right now and he is on his upscale he is uh very strong and he said that you know it's very interesting i don't know if it's gonna be enough uh
Translator: of experience using experience and technique for john to uh controversy that uh yeah and he said yeah this is very very strong opponent so he said that i i don't know yeah and can you ask him go ahead yeah i'm cheering for john very much i i know i know but
Translator: If Leonidas beat John, does it qualify Leonidas to pull Denis? Denis says, if Leonidas wins and beats John, does it make him qualified to fight, for example, with you? Yes, why not? Denis says, yes, why not? Okay, so...
Translator: He's an interesting opponent. If he wins against John, it would be great. Denis is saying that if he wins against John, it would be a very interesting opponent.
Host/Engin Terzi: Yeah so and also Dennis doesn't have to really push himself so much he can with a like general general shape you know he can compete so it would be because otherwise for really top 10 matches Dennis really really need to push his limits you know but this match he still needs to be strong but really doesn't have to prepare like he prepared for their own national
Translator: He says that if something like this happened, we'll see in the future, you probably wouldn't have had to torture yourself so much and with such powerful training that you are in your usual conditions already, probably, well, almost ready for such a level of an opponent. Yes, I just don't talk about it. It turns out that I often try to jump higher than my head, because I'm not 30 years old now, maybe
Denis Cyplenkov: I look at those times when it was easier, when nothing hurt. And now it's really hard, and you understand that either it should go slowly but confidently, but the fact that you are in a hurry, of course, it is not good, because I understand that I am really in a hurry. I, for example, want to rest an extra day, but because I have to fight, I need today and now.
Denis Cyplenkov: You don't recover, you come, you get sick, you get up. It's all about putting it on each other, and it turns out what it turns out to be, unfortunately. And that's why, yes, the guys came to my opinion, but if I'm interested in fighting with someone, and let it not be top 10,
Denis Cyplenkov: at least somewhere nearby. Why not? And from this moment on, carefully, quietly, somehow to get to this, or not to get to this, there already, as they say, the form will show. Well, at least, at least it will be comfortable, or something, to do it. And comfortable, and you know, and with pleasure.
Translator: Dennis is saying that yes and that's exactly what i'm talking about that uh uh i need to slow down and uh all those you know trying to prepare to the skyrocketing levels uh did not do good for me i'm not sorry anymore he said i need
Translator: more time to recover between trainings and so on so on so he wants to try to gain form uh slowly now not like he used to do and uh he said we will see maybe later uh by my shape by my form I will be able to gain
Translator: to all the way to the top. But as of right now, he wants to slow down a little bit. And he said, yeah, well, I don't want any top 10. I want somewhere else, but not here. That's what he says. Yeah, so we need to go step by step. Yeah. Can you ask Denis, when is he going to visit me? Denis asks, when are you going to visit me?
Denis Cyplenkov: I don't know when the next competition will be in Turkey. We need to see if we can come there as a guest. I think it's November 2nd, if I'm not mistaken. I think it would be logical. There are a lot of events here, I see them, they call me everywhere. It's good, of course, but I understand that it's not enough.
Denis Cyplenkov: Anyway, I'm going to do everything right now. They also invited me to the clinic for hair transplantation. I'm planning to do it too. I think this year I'm not going to prepare for anything. Maybe I'll just start next year. This year I will definitely do some things that were offered for health. Well, in general, that's how it is.
Denis Cyplenkov: okay dennis is saying yeah next one uh in turkey
Translator: He would love to visit. I said that it's in November, most likely, if I remember correctly. He said, yeah, that works. As a guest, I can be there. He said, this year, I'm kind of busy there on local events. And he wants to do some hair implants and his personal stuff. And he said, this year, I would love to stay calm and not to prepare to anything. But next year, yes, I can start preparation for some events and some stuff.
Host/Engin Terzi: yeah see hair transplant you see good i need something yeah tell him that we should do his hair in in istanbul or free
Translator: he's saying i remember that they even doing this in a hotel where we used to live yeah yeah but but i i i can ask the people who did my hair they can do for free and they they would do a good job
Denis Cyplenkov: There is a clinic, they have already taken me, I will go in August, they will do something to me, remove the excess. And in August and in September I will tune in to this operation. Where they will do it, too, everything is fine, the students have studied, the clinic is good, they have already agreed, as it were, well, like this. So I'll come, if anything, hairy already.
Translator: and it's saying that yeah i have already uh lined up the guys for september they're in russia oh there it is okay did you learn from turk they they already good they they can do it he said probably uh next time you will see me i will be hairy and then and then he will be making his hair like this the back and like he said like a london
Host/Engin Terzi: I will ask him some things. First of all, what did he think of Petrenko's performance both against Ongarbev and Darikyan?
Translator: I have a couple of questions for you now, if you don't mind. What do you think about how Petrenko performed with Anderbaev and Dodikyan? Very cool. Unexpectedly. Very powerful. I didn't expect Dodikyan to perform like that.
Denis Cyplenkov: I don't know, maybe there was some kind of problem, I didn't talk to him after that. But, in short, Steprenko, of course, showed good fights with Kadyrgaly and with David, yes. I thought there would be at least something, some kind of fight, but it turned out to be one fight, in fact.
Translator: dennis is saying that yeah i did not expect and yeah very very powerful and he said especially with the decan i did not expect that the decan will not be able even uh you know start and stuff like that he said very powerful very dominant uh very unexpected and uh very strong he said you know uh
Translator: he repeated he did not think that the decant will not be able to make anything at the start you know but he did not talk to uh david uh after the match for some i'm not sure for some reason but yeah maybe there was some issues but he said i don't think so it's just dominant from petrenko very good and the question when devon is competing super away he is around 120 120 to 23 maximum
Host/Engin Terzi: If Devon goes down to 105 kilos and then pulls Petrenko, what would Denis expect?
Translator: Denis, the question is, when Larratt is fighting in super-heavy categories, he can weigh 122-123 kg. What do you think, if he loses weight and they face Petrenko in the 105th category, will Larratt lose a lot of strength? What are Petrenko's chances? What do you think? To be honest, I think in Larratt's case,
Denis Cyplenkov: It will be a good fight. I'm sure Lars will be in the land on 15 kg. I think it won't work. Maybe he will lose a little, but for Oleg it will be enough to fight with him.
Translator: Yeah, Denis is saying that, you know what, I don't think that Larratt will lose a lot. He thinks maybe a little bit, but it will not be a lot on his performance and especially on his endurance. And he said that probably it's going to be enough for Petrenko. And he said, yeah, it's going to be a very, very good match. And it's going to be a big fight. Because he is very near two meters, Devon.
Host/Engin Terzi: And then even when he is 100, 122 kilos, he's ripped, you know, his arms, everything. You see how his pronator is popping out, you know. And this guy just losing 17 kilos. And like, I mean, if you have fat percentage high, then you can say that. But whenever, I mean, you are already ripped, you know. Like he could compete in bodybuilding competition almost.
Host/Engin Terzi: know i'm talking about the not that he's good enough but the fat percentage is very low and and then 17 kilo i don't know i don't know how but he would so i i think it would be the other day when i was watching him he was talking about this match petrenko and did you i don't know if you uh
Host/Engin Terzi: Yeah, yeah, you were there, you were translating for Petrenko about what he said about Pushkar match, Pushkar and Devon match. And so maybe you can you tell to Dennis that, like, that has a different meaning for Petrenko because of the match that Devon beat Pushkar. And now he's thinking kind of like revenge, you know.
Translator: but he says yes he says i also think so that he says lorat and so two meters well the same says that and you that and so dry he says there is such a mass he has it is not visible
Translator: Yes, yes, I understand. I even think that he will feel much better at 110 kilograms than at 122. Yes, because at 122 he pushes himself there to win, and here he is at 120.
Translator: I don't know if Denis heard the interview with Petrenko, but he said that the match with Larratt would mean a little more for him.
Translator: well, not quite revenge, as it were, revenge, as it were, because they fought with Andrey like that, that he took Andrey away like that, well, he kept him a little bit there to show his domination, he says, well, for me it kind of means a little bit more than just some kind of super match there, so I will prepare extra specially to win. You heard, right? Yes, the story is good, in principle, there is
Denis Cyplenkov: It's a good story. It's not just a fight, it's a bit of a revenge for Andriuk. It has a place to be, it's great. But it will be difficult. After all, the endurance of Lars will not go anywhere. And he will throw up, and maybe he will be more endurance. Here, of course, I think Oleg will not gain such endurance.
Denis Cyplenkov: Only power and strength in one touch will help him to win. If he suddenly hits something twice, it will be very difficult for him. In terms of endurance, Oleg does not train it unambiguously. It is either given or not given, but it is difficult to train.
Translator: Dennis is saying that first of all, yes, absolutely. Lareth right now is around 110 kilos and he probably feel even better than at 120 something because he's pushing himself to gain to 120 something. And now he's basically at his natural weight and he probably will feel better than he usually the super heavyweights.
Translator: When you say better, you mean healthier probably, but not stronger, for sure. Justin overall feeling, yes, healthier. He also said that yes, he knows about the history with Petrenko and Devon and Pushkar.
Translator: and he said listen it's a nice history and it's yeah it's going to be very much much revenge but he said it's not going to be easy for petrenko definitely uh if he will be able to overpower devon and just flash me they will stop somewhere is that devon's endurance at that weight will be even better than usually and that's not gonna be easy for sure
Translator: Also, he said that Petrenko cannot train the endurance to that level because usually you either have it or you not have it. You can train it a little bit, he said, but it's not that something you can train to a certain level. Yeah, I don't think that Petrenko is planning to have better endurance than Devon. I think, yeah. But also, if you remember the round, like, just think about Darikyan.
Host/Engin Terzi: What do you think about Todd Hutchings' endurance? Good, right? Yes. And then Todd catch him and brought him here. And then Dadikian was into the match from losing position. He was able to win. And when you look at the Dadikian versus Petrenko round three or round four, probably, they stuck at the middle. And then he was still able to win even after the match ended.
Host/Engin Terzi: was stopped so I mean Petrenko will not have the endurance of Devon but if he has some advantages position then maybe he can he can still continue here and there is a super chat Christopher Robin question for Dennis what are your thoughts on strong men like Brian Shaw joining arm wrestling
Translator: I will quickly translate it for you. He says that Petrenko doesn't have endurance like Larratt. But when we watched the match with Ndikyan, if the match stopped at the end of the last match, they stuck in the middle of the table. But because Petrenko was in such a comfortable position for him,
Translator: but he still managed, even after they stopped, to drag Dadikyan. But Dadikyan is not weak. When we watched that match against Hutchings, and Hutchings has very good endurance. Dadikyan was already in a losing position, and Hutchings held him, and still David was able to cut him out of there and pull him out. That is, there are levels, that is, the match will probably be interesting. If even they with Larratt slow down for a second somewhere,
Denis Cyplenkov: If it will be a convenient position for Oleg, then it is possible that he will be able to cut him down due to the power. I don't know. I just didn't see David's impulse explosion. What he did with Petrenko. Did he block it or not? Yes, yes. Yes, I can hear you. Oh, he's gone.
Translator: We lost him for a second. He probably pressed something. He will rejoin. He said that, you know, yes, everything is right. But he said when David was pulling Petrenko for some reason, I did not see that explosiveness, what usually they would have at the start.
Host/Engin Terzi: Sometimes you don't have that explosiveness when the beginning tightness of the opponent is better than yours, because you are already tight, you can't really start, because the guy has better static than you. Can you ask him about that? Yes, we can hear you, Denis. So, I translated what you said about the explosion. I don't understand, yes, he had the right terrarium, I didn't see the explosion, you know, when he...
Denis Cyplenkov: He's still trying to do it at least. And here you can see that he's holding on, trying, but there was no movement. And he understood that he couldn't do anything and gave up his hand. I hope for the next round. Well, I didn't see it, so I can't judge.
Denis Cyplenkov: I know that he had a little bit of a right hand. Maybe he started something there and something burned out in him. And he tried to hold on, do something, but he couldn't. I... Well, if Oleg blocked, well... Damn, well... Evgeny with Hutchings, who held on, he still tried to do these manipulations. Evgeny when his corner opened. And here he didn't have it at all, you know?
Translator: There was a question from the audience. What do you think about Strongman Brian Shaw, who is now trying to join us in armwrestling?
Denis Cyplenkov: No, it's interesting. We already have a lot of strongmen here. It's interesting for everyone to fight. We make fights between them. I will tell you that those whose eyes are on fire, they progress purely in the technical moment. And Brian Shaw is very heavy, very tall, very strong.
Denis Cyplenkov: And probably there is some kind of logical chain that if he is interested and he continues all this moment, then it will turn out to be a good car.
Denis Cyplenkov: The main thing is that his desire doesn't go away, doesn't go away when everything starts to hurt. So, well, God forbid, it's interesting. In any case, this is already something big and powerful. If we can, as they say, make a diamond out of it, which will really destroy everyone. Well, cool, I'm just for it.
Translator: Denis is saying, okay, first of all, finish the conversation about that he can. He said, listen, I've been watching his previous matches and even in losing position with Hutchings, he was trying to explosively, you know, do something. With Petrenko, he said, I did not see that. I don't know if there is a problem with something old or Petrenko really blocked it.
Translator: He blocked it with the back pressure. He couldn't have the wrist, you know, because Petrenko's back pressure. Yeah. So then he says, he said, if Petrenko blocked it, then it's, I don't know, he's too much. If there is a problem from David's side, we will find out later when I'll talk to him. That's the end of conversation. Yeah, but I want to say only to you, you know, he did the same thing, even Walsh was thinking on Garber, you know.
Host/Engin Terzi: So you cannot just say that it was something for one day. Only five weeks ago, he did even something even worse, you know, in the Petrenko, Ungar-Wehrmacht. I agree with that.
Translator: And then regarding Brian Shaw, he said, listen, we are now inviting the strongmen and bodybuilders in Russia in doing some arm fights and we will start training them. And it's super interesting and it's working. He said, Brian Shaw is big, tall, very strong, and it's very cool that he's entering arm wrestling. The biggest concern...
Translator: is not to scare him on very beginning when you know when he will face all the painful things of arm wrestling and he said listen if we can make a diamond out of out of him you know now he's not
Host/Engin Terzi: he said it's gonna be a killing machine and yeah just not to scare him off but he said no no we will not we will not just just the same like right now dennis is not his time you know to pick you know the top guys right now same for we will just go as much as they should go so there is another one phil woody thank you my friend um dennis any chance you will give guest commentary a go one more time any chance
Host/Engin Terzi: any chance you will give guest commentary a go? Does he mean that Will Dennis do any commentating or I don't know what, my English is not, maybe you can look at, can you look at the chat or no?
Translator: No, I don't, but okay, I'll ask it. But they may not be the question here. I don't know, maybe this is what I understood. Maybe I'm wrong, because English is not my... That's probably what it is, that's probably what it is. Okay. No, that's probably what it is, that's probably what it is.
Translator: We will do it carefully, so everything will be fine. That's right. The main thing is not to give the opportunity to run away, so you need to play along. The first year, the first year, one hundred percent. Well, a question came from the hall, he says, and you, Denis, when you come as a guest to these events, will you ever comment a little? Is there such an opportunity?
Denis Cyplenkov: I'm commenting on the armature right now. I'm consulting the guys and they're forcing me to comment on what's interesting. Of course, there are no problems.
Translator: yeah there is an answer that uh listen I'm already uh consulting and commenting this armatura armatura you can translate as rebar but it's more with arms armatura whatever it doesn't matter it's just name of the uh already commenting and uh
Host/Engin Terzi: uh consulting the whole events and it's very interesting and yes absolutely in the future if if you guys want to hear it i can yeah it's very yeah yeah but the only problem is that like i think he can he can do only for maybe kinopois because that he will be speaking in russian so that yeah
Host/Engin Terzi: Majority of the people. No, during the streaming, live streaming, people will not understand. Majority. And anyway, so I want to ask him, what does he think about Jerry Cadorette versus Alex Kurdecha? What do you think, Denis, about Kurdecha and Jerry Cadorette? Match. Kurdecha, I really liked the last fight. The last one, how he's in the mood.
Denis Cyplenkov: And I think he will take the fight. I think he will break his movement. I have such a thought, yes. Well, to be honest, I don't think so. Yes, Kondraty won't do anything here. Yes. I'm sure.
Translator: Denis has said that he's pretty sure that Alex Kurdecha, after what he saw in the last matches, his, you know, mindset and everything else, he said that he will break him. He will break Jerry Ketherett. He will not be able to do anything with his move. So yeah, he said, I'm pretty sure of it. So he said that Alex will win for sure? Yes. Okay. And...
Host/Engin Terzi: Somehow Levan thinks the opposite way. Somehow Levan thinks that this style will be bad for Alex's style. And what does he think about this? Not that I want him to say something about what Levan says, but does he think that the style may be difficult?
Translator: Levan commented differently. Levan believes that such a flop press will be very inconvenient for Alex, because Alex usually spins over the top. Devon't you think Alex will have problems with that? No, I think Alex is already an experienced athlete. I think he will pick up the key. You can already see how you can fight with the cadarete.
Denis Cyplenkov: The fight is always the same. And there, well, a little bit Alex, let's say, I think he will find the keys. That is, he is preparing for it.
Translator: Denis is saying that Alex by now is an experienced athlete and he said Jerry is pulling always the same way. And he said it's relatively easy to find the key and he believes that Alex will find the key because he's getting ready especially for him. And what does he think about Laletin? Does he think that Laletin now has a chance to beat Levan?
Denis Cyplenkov: What do you think about Laletin? Do you think Laletin has a chance to beat Levan now? Well, I would go back to Gasparini, to be honest. I would fight him first, and then it would be more or less clear.
Denis Cyplenkov: I understand that Vitaly is very good. I hope that he gained a little weight, at least for sure. But still, the question of Gasparini remains unfinished. In fact, first there would be a fight with them, and then the winner would be in Lebanon.
Denis Cyplenkov: It's easier to understand. I just can't say it right away, because Vitalik and Artem fought back quickly, right? That's right, quickly. But if Artem caught him, roughly speaking, right? What would happen? Here's the question. Well, we won't succeed with Levan. In any case, something will change in the endurance stage, and here, I don't know. Well, I say,
Translator: Gasparini vs. Revenge. First of all, it has to be him. Denis is saying that it's a little bit complicated question and he believes that that would be fair and make sense if first will be match Revenge with Gasparini and then the winner of this match would go against Levan.
Translator: He said, yeah, Vitaly is gaining in mass and he's getting stronger. And he said, yeah, this was a fast match with Morozov, but it's not the case with Levan. He said, what would happen if Morozov would stop him? We don't know. There is endurance became an issue and stuff like that. So he said, I really believe that match events with Gasparini should happen first, and then winner of that match would go after...
Translator: But why not Hermes directly pulling Levan? Why Hermes needs to beat Lalletin again to face Levan? He asks, he says, why do you think that Hermes shouldn't go right now to fight Levan? Why do you think that, for example, one more match, revenge, needs Hermes and Lalletin? No.
Denis Cyplenkov: The question was about Vitaly. That's why I'm talking about Vitaly. If the question is about Gasparini's rematch with Levan, then in the first place, Gasparini deserves it, because he won with Vitaly.
Denis Cyplenkov: But it was a year ago, and I would give Vitaly a chance to fight Gasparini for the opportunity to fight Levano. If Vitaly is not in both, then of course Gasparini should fight Levano. You remembered a year ago, and I immediately remembered that I was there then.
Translator: It was great. I was there, I drank beer, my moustache was bleeding, my mouth was watering.
Translator: Engin, Denis is answering this way. He said the question was if Vitaly should and can pull Levan and win this time. He said if you're asking if Gasparini goes against Levan first, he said yes, he deserved it already. But for Vitaly to get to Levan... Okay, for Lalletti needs to be Hermes to get shot for the... Okay, I understand.
Translator: And he said, yeah, Levan won with Gasparini, but it was a year ago. Some things may change. How about Hermes? Does Hermes need to beat Devon to get a shot for Levan?
Denis Cyplenkov: Well, the question is, if you look at it this way, then of course. But since Lars is going down to 105, he is already fighting Oleg Petrenko. I think it is necessary to give the opportunity either to Gasparini or to Vitaly Kolaritin. Definitely. And there, look, and Kurdecha, in principle, too. I think Tuscany will fight.
Denis Cyplenkov: I think he can be included in the list in order to see how it would be like to see him with Levan. In short, as of today, I see that if we don't take Lars, he has already fought, let it be a rematch in a year, there is an opportunity to give Gasparini, Vitalik or Kurdecha. If Kurdecha wins, then it will be a rift.
Translator: uh uh Dennis is saying again yes but Devon is going back to 105 I believe he he told us that he's out of super heavyweight so he said there is three people three people lined up he said uh most likely Alex when he went with uh Jerry lalitin and Hermes Hermes probably number one in the line and then
Host/Engin Terzi: Vitaly and these three people who can... Okay, can you ask him? I don't know if Jerry is going to win or Alex is going to win. I don't know. But since he said that he believes Alex is going to win, what does he think about Alex versus Vitaly match? And who does he think that would be favorites?
Translator: He says, I don't know who will win, Jerry or Alex, but if Alex wins, what do you think about the match between Kurdecha and Loletin? Excellent. But for leaving for Lebanon then. He said, yes, very good, but for opportunity to pull Lebanon.
Denis Cyplenkov: No, no, I understand, but who would win? No, no, I understand, but who would win? No, no, I understand, but who would win? No, no, I understand, but who would win? No, no, I understand, but who would win?
Translator: Denis Seng asked me the same question after Jerry and Kordachev will pull, because he said if Alex will do whatever I think he will do and will just go through Ketheret with ease, then it's going to be a very, very good match. But as of right now, Vitaly's favorite. Okay. Okay. I understand. Let's go to the next event quickly.
Host/Engin Terzi: We don't want to keep him so long, but Michael Todd versus Kamil Jablonski. Monster Michael and Kamil Jablonski. Orlando, Florida versus West Virginia. I think it's Jablonski, because if you remember how Michael Todd fights, if he will give the phase there,
Denis Cyplenkov: then Jablonski will push through with his weight. He hits very well with his triceps. If you give him the opportunity to push through, and Michael is fighting like that, then Jablonski will win for him, of course.
Translator: Dennis saying because of the stylistically, because of the Michael always giving his arm and Jablonski is very good triceps pulling, he will most likely gain his position and then he will be able to finish it in depth. He said, I think that Michael will always give up the center and Jablonski will
Translator: take an advantage and will get into his position but but what does he think about uh michael's shoulder pressure uh
Translator: Dennis is saying that they will most likely try and they will go against each other at the same, approximately the same move. But he said because of Jablonski is heavier than Michael, he have an advantage in his opinion. I think there is only right now, Michael is, I think coming near to 130. I think there's only five kilo in between right now, I think.
Denis Cyplenkov: Engin says that he thinks that they will be about 5 kilos apart. Well, look, Michael Todd liked to hold, and when the opponent got tired, he switched to the triceps and won. I didn't see him in the beginning of the fight
Denis Cyplenkov: He went to the triceps. And Jablonski will do it right away. With his weight. I don't think he can hold his weight. Because all the guys who went to the triceps during the fight with Michael Todd won. And here he will attack right away, take the middle. Michael Todd, I don't think he will stand up to this attack in his format.
Translator: So Denis believes that Michael never go into his shoulder press or triceps press at the very beginning of the supermatch. He's usually trying to tire his opponent in the first couple of matches and then he's doing that.
Translator: But he said he will not be able to tire Jablonski in his position because if Jablonski will gain into that, you know, flop triceps press, he said that he will finish Michael. And he said, if you look at the history, anybody who was pulling Michael in a deep flop press, they was pressing him down. Okay. But, you know, Paolo, sometimes Michael directly starts the match, you know, with that as well.
Host/Engin Terzi: Yeah, my opinion is different. I believe Michael is going to win. I know. Winning or losing is different. But there are times that Michael, right with the start, he also did that move, you know. Anyway, so, yeah. Denis, Frank Lampirelli, Dave Chaffee. Dave Chaffee, Frank Lampirelli, you understand, right? To be honest, I don't really know Lampirelli.
Denis Cyplenkov: Well, I hope that Chaffee will win. Because he has been losing a lot lately. I understand who you are talking about, but I just don't remember who he won from, what conditions he had, and I didn't watch him much. Still, I hope that Chaffee will start a winning streak. That is, victories will begin from this moment.
Translator: Denis said that he doesn't know Lampirelli very well. He knows him, but he doesn't follow him much. And he said that he hopes that Dave Chaffee finally will step on that winning pass and will start winning his cheering for him. But he said, I don't really follow Lampirelli, so I cannot, you know, speak up. Yeah, I'm not going to ask him all the matches, but the one last one I want to ask him. What does he think about Pauline versus Rustam Babaiev?
Denis Cyplenkov: Rustam Babaiev and Paul Linn will fight. What do you think? They have a rematch. A rematch. Babaiev, I think, lost. Babaiev lost, then he would have torn his chest. Yes, yes, yes. Well, I remember, yes, I remember. That's why I, of course, well, Babaiev was a favorite there. I lost because of that torn chest. I mean, I really hope that this situation will not repeat. And, of course, Rustam will win.
Translator: Denis is saying that he remembers the match and I remember the injury and he said that I hope that the injury will not happen again and he believes that Rustam will be favourite and he's going to win. And one last thing, what does he think about Dzerhanov and did he watch his last match against Rivas? Did you watch Rivas and Dzerhanov's last match?
Translator: But Dzeranov won. Yes. Look, look, look. Yes, he saw that. Yeah, and what does he think about his shape? Is he a threat for the top five guys? What do you think about how Dzeranov scored? And do you think he has an opportunity to get into the top five? Top five? And where is he now?
Host/Engin Terzi: What spot is the runoff right now? What's the what? What spot is the runoff right now? Ranking? Yes. I think 9th or something like that. 9th or 10th or probably. Do you think it's 9th or 10th? Well, it's going to be difficult for the 5th. I don't think it's going to be the 5th.
Denis Cyplenkov: Well, the fifth, maybe. Because Levan, Vitalik, Gasparini, Kurdecha, Morozov. Well, damn, that's probably the first five. And in the next five, yes, in the beginning, maybe.
Translator: Then he's saying that first five, top five is complicated because it's Levan, Kurdecha, Alitin, Gasparini, Morozov. That's five. But he said that very beginning of the next five, like six or seven, it's very possible, yes. So he thinks that the way that he made this, I don't know, still doesn't make him a threat to top five, huh?
Denis Cyplenkov: Do you think that the way he won this match doesn't push him that far into the top five? Well, you have to fight them. The guys there are stronger than Rivas. I mean, they also beat him. So it's a question. But I think that the guys I put on Levan are the top five.
Denis Cyplenkov: Yeah, he's saying that, well,
Translator: those top five guys was winning with Revas too and they are stronger so yeah we need to set up some super matches but he said top five is tough uh but uh he said three four places up very possible yes yeah yeah but because I don't know in fact beat Revas easier than even Laletin beat him you know but you know in a different way anyway so we will see all these matches
Host/Engin Terzi: and i want to thank to dennis for being part of it and we can keep in touch hopefully maybe november he would come as a special guest can you ask him if there is anything that anything that he he would like to say before we uh and one last thing people are asking about his current weight right now
Translator: He says, well, thank you for being a guest. And he says, I hope we'll see you in November, you'll come as a guest. And he says, oh, yes, people are still asking how much you weigh now, what weight you have now. 123-125. I, you know, I slept, how can I say, well, when you train, you train, and you get a little fat.
Denis Cyplenkov: In such a tone. Now I'm tougher, but the weight remained the same, 123-125 kg.
Translator: Yeah, it's approximately the same weight, about 123, 125. He said my weight doesn't really change because when I'm training, my shape is changing a little bit, you know, but the overall weight doesn't really change. So 123, 125, the lowest, and when he trains, really maybe 130 maximum. I think this is what I see, yeah. Yeah.
Host/Engin Terzi: And would you like to tell him that, you know, maybe we hope to see him in November, we can keep in touch, and then if there is anything he would like to say before we finish?
Denis Cyplenkov: I think I still have an opportunity to fight. Maybe not in the top, but armwrestling lives in me. If there is an opportunity to compete with someone,
Denis Cyplenkov: less strong yet, then I will be glad, right? And of course, I will strive for how health will show you. This is first of all, so that you don't get upset there, don't put me there somewhere higher, so that I still give myself the opportunity to prepare regularly. And where I will go, as they say, as God wills.
Denis Cyplenkov: Unfortunately, the conditions are no longer the same, but there is a desire. And that's how it will go, that's how it will be. Therefore, I will try, yes, I will try, as they say,
Denis Cyplenkov: I want to fight. I think there will always be a worthy opponent. And it will always be interesting for everyone. So wait for me. I don't know with whom, but I hope the organizers will come up with something.
Translator: Thank you, Denis. Denis is saying, don't get bored. I am still armwrestling and armwrestling is part of me and living in me. So he said, yes, I cannot pull top 10 right now, but if you can put me against some interesting and strong opponents, not top 10, a little bit less. Talking about November?
Translator: no no no not november november okay okay yeah and uh he said yeah please uh organize it will be a super interesting matches i guarantee and wait for future let me let me progress yes yes yes we'll see we'll see the god knows how high i can go and uh but i will try to do you know different preparation to get as high as possible
Host/Engin Terzi: Yeah, but something came to my mind I need to ask. Ibrahim Sagov, David Dadikian, Ivan Matushenko. Who does he think that, like, how would he rank them compared to each other?
Translator: 115 kilos, 115 kilos. In 115 kilos, if you take 1st, 2nd, 3rd, you can count. Who is in 1st, 2nd, 3rd place? On the left hand.
Denis Cyplenkov: Left? Engin, left or right? Right. Oh, right? Yeah. Does Matyushenko fight on the right? He does. No, he fought on the left. Yeah, but he fights on the right too. Did he fight on the right at least once? Yeah, he fought Kamil Jablonski on the right.
Denis Cyplenkov: Half question.
Denis Cyplenkov: Tough question. Yeah, you caught him. No guards. He said that Matyushenko... I don't even know how to compare them. If they at least fought against each other once. Well, yes. On the right. And so, damn, it's hard to say. Well, David, for example, is explosive. Probably, after all, it will be difficult to keep his start.
Translator: He's saying that if I was that good, I would be a rocket scientist. No, he's trying to think loud about, you know, how good startup that you can, but then he said, well, I don't know. No, no. I mean, I don't know what he said. It's tough. So they are all very close to each other?
Translator: I think all three are pretty close, depending on the situation. Another question. Among these three, who would have the better chance against Devon at 115 kg? That's where I was going to come from. Of these three in the 115 kg category, who has the best chance against Larratt?
Host/Engin Terzi: Denis, Denis, one is this, one is this, and one is this. Matushenko, Sago, and Dadykin. Which one style, technique? Stylistically. Do you think, who is the best, the most difficult for Aglarat?
Denis Cyplenkov: To the right. To the right. Well, I think if you take David with his start, if, well, I don't know what happened with Oleg Petrenko, but he didn't even try to, as they say, explode. Damn, well, who has a good start, he has more opportunities.
Denis Cyplenkov: Trying to fight with him in endurance, as Vanya and Sagov do, damn, I wouldn't do it. But I think it's still possible to break through at the start. If someone starts and explodes, there is an option. Because Vanya likes to hang around, to stand. Sagov also likes to stand, to stop, to get in there. Therefore, here I don't think they will stop at the back.
Translator: Denis believes that the best chances are the fastest start. He believes that Matyushenko and Sagov are saying yes, but they are usually trying to, you know,
Translator: sit in the middle somewhere and just a little weight gain position and then go and uh that you can is the most explosive and fastest start to flush pin Devon because he said none of those three can over endure uh Devon but uh flash pin probably the best flash pin is that he can okay
