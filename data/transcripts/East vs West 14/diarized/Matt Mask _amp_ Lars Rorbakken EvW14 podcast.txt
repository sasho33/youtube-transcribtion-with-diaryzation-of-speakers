Engin Terzi: Richard. Hello, Todd and Alex Lovechild. Hello, Richard. Hello, Devon . Hello, Ryan. I cannot read your name. It is, I think, Russian language. Hello, Sean. Hello.
Engin Terzi: I'm not coming to Orlando, my friend. The time that I had to go and get visa was the time that I was having surgery. I was hospitalized and that one month, you know. So unfortunately, I won't be there, but you guys will have a great time, no doubt. Hello to Nepal, Nabi. My health is better. Robert Crane, thank you.
Engin Terzi: My plan, I didn't lose weight. I mean, before compared to the surgery time, I think I lost around three, four kilos, but I need to lose this belly. I think I lost most size from the muscles. There is still an open tournament today. Yes, yes, yes. There's a tournament.
Engin Terzi: you guys okay how it will start 11 a.m there will be press conference in the same venue where you guys are gonna compete so you guys go there watch the press conference and have fun and after the press conference just fight till the death at the tournament and then next day you guys will have you guys will have great time
Engin Terzi: Hello, Drew24. You also welcome back. Hello, hello, hello, my friend. Aleyk√ºm Selam, Prime. Hello, feel good. Who win if Hermes versus Devon rematch? I don't know about this. Chugging Tengu.
Engin Terzi: Good day to you, Phil and Ian. Hello, hello. Yep, six days, only six days, and it will be incredible. I'm just thinking that what I feel that North Aymeric, very quietly, but they are very determined to be successful finally at home, front of their countrymen. Hello, Lars, how are you? Hello, I'm fine, thanks, and you?
Engin Terzi: Good, good, good. Everything is good. Nice. You ready to rock? Yes, yes. That's good. That's good. You know, when I said this match, I forget about the match that you guys said years ago. And so now it has a different meaning. Is it possible to use the phone sideways or? Like this? Yeah.
Engin Terzi: yeah daniel andrea high engine can't wait for orlando it is almost time yes this is almost time and this is unlike the previous east versus west it is just like 90 percent really east versus west and this is the first time it's happening in
Engin Terzi: west so this this is like really different meaning this this is something like north americans to how to say finally okay you eastern guys come to this side and let's see how it is happening this time this this is how i see it uh yeah you cannot see both of us at the same time because we are only two uh and this is zoom so
Engin Terzi: Matt Mask will come and then you will see all three of us. So how is everything? You said you had like one and a half kilo and then I think you will not be so problem, but it may be problem for someone like you that is very low fat percentage. Yeah, it's getting hard now in the end, but I can do a water cut when I fly over, so it shouldn't be a problem. But I want to do as much as possible before because
Lars Rorbakken: I have bad experience with what I got. When I start to eat again, I just cramps. And so I, I want to do it a little bit slower. So, but it's under control. That's good. That's good. That's good. And how is the form? I think it's good. I'm feeling, uh, I'm feeling good. It's two weeks now since I had my last really hard workout. So now I just do, I still arm wrestle, but, uh, low intensity, of course. So it feels good.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, let Matt come and then let's start. It's exciting, Lars. It's very exciting event. Okay, Matt came. Matt just came. Hello. Hello, Matt. How are you? Can you hear me?
Engin Terzi: Yes, we hear you. Perfect. We got her done the first time this goal, eh? Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then while you were gone, you know, Lars was saying how he's going to smoke you and destroy you and like... Of course, he didn't say this. I'm just making up. He should be confident. He should be confident. Yeah. So how is everything, Matt? Good. Good. Busy, but really good. Yeah. And...
Engin Terzi: how do you see like that do you have any any kind of how to say something memory i when i said this match i forget about that you guys pull in the past and like like do you feel like it is affecting you in a negative way the illusion against him years ago or it is in fact the opposite way
Matt Mask: No, I find I tend to usually shit the bed the first time I go to pull somebody. It's usually, usually I learn, I regroup, I kind of dissect everything that kind of happened. And usually, usually I come in better the second go. So, but it's...
Matt Mask: you know lars lars is also a different human being than he was 10 years ago or whatever it was that we pulled right so he's not uh physically i believe he's in better shape uh he's obviously got more experience now how active he's been over the last 10 years
Matt Mask: obviously not as active as me but you know he's still still ours we're walking right so and he's and he's got a few more options now than what he did back then right back then there was kind of one only one option he was doing now he's starting to pull into different areas right so it's uh yeah different different human being so it's you know you can only I don't I don't think Lars has been active so much in the last 10 years but later Lars how long did you
Engin Terzi: stop pulling lars uh i stopped pulling for about six years and then i started again uh when you called me last last fall so it's been yeah you know when i call you he was like when devon was here with me and he was getting ready for hermes match and he he said that okay what about lars and then yeah that is how it started yeah yeah that's good yeah it was last august probably
Engin Terzi: around maybe August 18, or something, you know? Yeah, I just was watching my log. So it's close to one year since I started again. Yeah. Take about six years break, at least a little bit more than six years. And I want to ask Matt, Matt, like, to know that when you when you were offered to pull against Lars, like,
Engin Terzi: What came to your mind was like, I need to get physically stronger or like I need to pull right direction.
Matt Mask: uh first thing i thought was redemption honestly was now's now's my time to get one back that i lost right so it's uh yeah i kind of looked at some footage and seen where he's going so it's you know there's there's there's more than one angle that he's going now so i need to need to be versatile enough so in my stuff i'm able to kind of cock block both of them regardless what you actually decides to go in right so
Matt Mask: But do you really believe, do you believe that he can beat you with another direction? Uh, I don't know. It's hard to say. It's hard to say. So, you know, I've, I've come to really feel I'm a firm believer. Every time I go into a match confident, I always make myself look like a fucking ass. So I'm really trying to get away from the confident part of it. So no, I think, uh, yeah, there's a possibility he can beat me on any fucking angle in the table. So I got to make sure, um,
Engin Terzi: I'm a hundred percent ready for no matter what direction he goes to go. So. Okay. And, and last, what, what, like you, you to pull against mask again, after so many years, when was it exactly the year you guys pulled? I think it was 2012, maybe 2013, 12, around there.
Engin Terzi: And Lars, you two know that you defeated Matt before. Does it make you feel like, okay, I have done this before. I know the way to do it. That kind of confidence or how do you feel? How would it be different if you were pulling him first time or when you pull him first time, were you more or less confident?
Lars Rorbakken: Hard to say, but I didn't know that much about him first time he was he was not so so famous that he is now. So I feel everything is new because he have a level up and he's yeah, he's so much more experienced and I've got I'm shrink smaller, maybe weaker in some area, but I think I'm more complete.
Lars Rorbakken: and more experience, even if I had a break. I've been on the table a lot this last year. So for me, it feels like, of course, it's a rematch and I really want to win this time as well. But everything is new and with a high level puller like Matt and he's so explosive. So I really don't know what to expect. I only expect it to be a very hard match. That's for sure.
Engin Terzi: And you both had lost your last matches. You lost against Michael, you lost against Brad. That kind of experience right before this match, does it damage the confidence or it is like, okay, I need to do something now successful and then make that... It can go both ways.
Lars Rorbakken: Of course, everybody at this level really hates losing. So for sure, I don't think Matt plans to lose either. So both of us really want to win. But sometimes if you win too much, you can get a little bit sloppy. And when you lose, you may get a little extra. You're doing training with your food, your preparation, and everything can be a little bit better, at least for me, when I'm coming off a loss. So, yeah, but...
Engin Terzi: Of course, it can affect you as well when you get real bad beatings, so it's hard to say. And Matt, when you have a loss like that, you think that you had a bad day or you go home and do some calculation and say that there are some things that I need to change it so that it would not happen again? How is your mindset, you know?
Matt Mask: Yeah, I would say, I would say Lars is probably kind of fairly the same, same with me. And like, he's got that, got that fighting spirit. He's a warrior. He doesn't want to give up no matter what the situation is. So it's, it's not always, oh, I just had a bad day. Sometimes, sometimes that is how it is, but regardless, whatever happens, you have to go back and look at it as what did I do wrong? What could I improve? Where was I weak in this match? Where did I fuck up in the setup?
Matt Mask: was there leading up to it something I did wrong so there's yeah like the amount of thoughts that go through your head after a loss are I say I know for myself is constantly how can I improve for the next time where did I go wrong and what do I need to adjust in order so this shit don't happen again right so because nothing nothing's worse than fucking losing so
Engin Terzi: you know you i find you way way more than you do from a loss but but losing still sucks right it hurts the ego so yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you you that that is why i think that matt we need to learn when we are winning so so that that we like we won't be satisfied with the victory and then we would still you know like not so much prideful okay i won't i'm good you know
Engin Terzi: But, you know, just even when you win, you go home on the way, you say, okay, I won, but did I win as I would like, you know, where it could be dangerous. And then, because if we don't find our weaknesses, uh, when everything is going well, there's somebody will.
Matt Mask: Find it, you understand? Next time, you need to progress. Especially if you're on the win. When you're winning all the time, everybody's watching you, right? Everybody's looking at every single move. Everybody's trying to figure out what kind of angle would possibly work better. Every time you go to pull somebody, even if they're the same type of puller as the last puller, you know he's coming at you at a different angle or a different way. Everybody's trying to dissect that weakness on you.
Engin Terzi: And Matt, what do you think about Lars' statement that the Europeans will come and destroy all of you Aymeric?
Matt Mask: Yeah, I think they're fucking blowing smoke up their own ass. So, you know, it's yeah. And it's a long way home when you're disappointed in that type of fashion. So, yeah, I know. You know, Matt, you know, you know that Lars never said that. But when everything is going so respectful. So I just. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah, I know. Lars is probably thinking like when did I say that? There's shit to stir, Berengen. Hey.
Engin Terzi: That is fun when it's happening. But this is a serious question, Matt. Like there has been 13 West versus West and 11 King of the Table. So 24 events and all happened at this side of the world. You guys had to travel here all the time. So now they have to travel there.
Engin Terzi: and we know that travel also affects and like there are some everything jet lag you know a few things and right now there will be near a thousand people there and they will be supporting the team west like crazy like do you feel or do you think that
Engin Terzi: this event is not only men versus men but it is just like really like pure west versus east this time you know that this is our i think i think 100 100 that definitely plays a factor into it everybody everybody from the west we've we've been getting our ass kicked every time we go over
Matt Mask: uh besides besides king of the table i think we we might have might have done okay on some of those ones but majority of these versus west events we've we've definitely come on the lighter side right so i'm cutting you sorry but like it is not really east versus west but two country
Engin Terzi: versus the rest of the world you know so i mean it is just like imagine that just kazakhs every event is rest of the guys from russia and then georgia and bulgaria and america just even kazakhs or even georgians if they bring like 10 guys they won't be like having more wins
Engin Terzi: then when they bring four best guys, it is easier too. But when you bring 10 guys, so what I just say, of course, they are the right now best. The Georgians are the best. But it is very, very hard, Aymeric and Canada to come bring all those guys and be more successful. But you still had Tatasins winning the title. You had Pauline winning the title. You had Devon Larratt winning two categories. So it was- Jerry won one.
Engin Terzi: jerry yeah jerry won jerry won two times you know so one country one country winning like devon won the title permanently so he he had the three title wins in the super heavyweight and then he won prudently in the heavyweight four top one against uh um five and then paul six and then jerry won so you guys won like eight title
Engin Terzi: matches you know it is for one country two country it is i think uh not bad you know so no no it's not bad we we got a lot more numbers here too well kind of sort of in certain areas right so but yeah some somebody says that i love when england defends the west my friend i'm not defending anything i'm saying the fact is you know yeah yeah just imagine that just one country only like bulgaria rest of the world you know or kazakhstan or russia
Engin Terzi: I mean, it is not possible to be, like, win majority of the matches if you are talking about being against the rest of the world. But I see this. I see this spirit that, you know, West right now is, you know, like, with a team spirit, you know.
Matt Mask: Well, a hundred percent home crowd makes a huge advantage too, right? So just the energy, everything you're going to pull in from everybody in the place is going to, going to definitely give you that extra five to 10%, right? So. Yeah. Yeah. And then I think that Bob Brown will be cornering.
Engin Terzi: some of the athletes like Tata Shins, Greg Tullier, and probably a few more. And then Devon will be there. You know, I think that you guys will psychologically have a big advantage, big advantage, near a thousand people. Justin not to travel, like, you know, only a four-hour flight or whatever. Everything makes a difference, right? Yeah. You have only two hours time difference compared to here. When you come here, nine hours difference. And when you go to Dubai, 10 hours difference.
Lars Rorbakken: So Lars, does it concern you about this kind of things? Do you think this is a disadvantage or it will not affect anything? I don't think it matters that much for me because it's quite a long travel from Norway to Dubai, where I've been the last three times anyway. So of course, the time zone is bigger this time, but I feel like I'm traveling to a new territory.
Lars Rorbakken: Anyway, because Norway is so far up and away from the rest of the world. So, yeah, I don't think that should matter that much for me. How about near a thousand people just getting crazy there, you know? Yeah, actually, I like that. I'm used to that from strongman competition. So that's a good point.
Engin Terzi: Evgeny if they don't caring for me, it's a good thing anyway. This never happened before. When you say West, when people come to Istanbul, nobody is home. It's not Georgia. There is not like 500 Georgian people there. Not 500 Bulgarians. We say West Istanbul, but except in some Turkish outlets, nobody really have the home advantage to travel. But this time,
Lars Rorbakken: First time, there will be hundreds of people. Hundreds of people. You never know. Maybe us coming over from Europe will feel like Rocky in Rocky IV when he comes to Russia. Everybody, boo, boo. I think it will be fun. I think it will be fun. Yeah, yeah, it will be. Because I tell you what, the atmosphere in United States, especially,
Engin Terzi: is nothing like anywhere in the world that that that that uh how to say maybe yeah the energy that they they really want to enjoy like like some others over here sometimes because of the cultural things they are not like losing themselves right they don't have that used to that freedom of speech where you can just kind of say freedom of speech but they they don't they i don't know they are more
Engin Terzi: We are more quiet. More reserved, right? Yeah, we are more quiet, more respectful, I can say. I'm not saying the other side is disrespectful. Oh, no, we're totally disrespectful. No, I don't say that. No, they don't. You don't have to say, I'll say it for you, Engen. No, no, you are an exception. But listen, do you realize that, Lars, it has been almost 20 minutes and
Engin Terzi: Matt didn't say any F word. That is the world record. Yeah, it must be. It must be. Yeah. I've become more reserved myself. Yeah, because I think you are right now more saving your energy for the, you know, when you hear the go. Yeah. So I just want to hear my name. That's all. Justin say my name. Yeah. Yeah. And Matt, another thing, like,
Engin Terzi: when you competing at wal i think your win lose record was better than the like east west and king of table here you also have wins but what i just try to say that regardless do you enjoy
Matt Mask: this as much as you enjoy the other one? The reason I ask is because I think this is a tougher stage. I think I enjoy it more. I get to see different parts of the world. I'm getting the opportunity to pull people. I never would have got the opportunity to pull. It's different when you're always pulling people from North Aymeric and then they just pull the odd one.
Matt Mask: out from europe but this is this is opens up a whole different wide range of of cultures and and athletes and you know like some of these countries uh the amount of energy and effort and everything that they put into the sport itself and how much their country's behind them and the support it's yeah it's a whole new ball game and it's yeah it's it's definitely i'm having some ups and downs in it but it's starting uh i feel it's slowly slowly starting to come together i never said it was
Matt Mask: right and i i love i love that you keep fighting you know i love that when people give up i i i won't ever stop you'll have to you'll have to break my arm off and throw it in the garbage before i'm gonna stop so it's uh yeah i i feel i haven't projected and shown what my true capabilities are i don't it's it's kind of weird like it's i'm not
Matt Mask: I haven't been as aggressive on the goals as I have been in the past with WLs and everything else. I'm kind of feeling everybody out. So it's, you know, once, once I get that feel now it's, you know what I mean? Then I can really start to come to play. Right. So it's,
Matt Mask: Evgeny pulling the guys in North Aymeric, the first time I pulled Marcio, the first time I pulled Chris Challenger, the first time I pulled any of these guys, I always got my ass handed to me, right? But it was when I went back home and kind of regrouped and I came back into it, it was now it's not so new anymore. I'm not kind of trying to feel it out. It's kind of, you know, it's regular. It's more home for me, right? Yeah. And what I like about what's happening right now is that
Engin Terzi: you win or lose, you know that that is the highest level. Like, there is nothing stronger or tougher than this stage. So you know that, like, you lose or win, there is nothing shame there. It is the, like, when two gladiators go to the arena, I mean, one needs to win, one is going to lose, but you know that it is, like, there is nothing better than that. There is nothing. Everything is right there. Everything is right there, and
Matt Mask: There is no shame of losing or nothing at all. Evgeny, even being able just to take part in it is huge, huge fucking blessing. Right. So it's the losses, the losses do kind of suck. The wins feel great, but you know, once, once the guy does start getting a feel for it and starts to pull in a few more W's, like it's just going to feel that much better. Right. So it's, you know, you don't really appreciate the win.
Matt Mask: you don't really appreciate a win as much over there if you're always doing it if you know once you get a few losses then it really really starts to starts to take effect right so yeah and the next event in orlando will be an event that make will make you feel better yeah 100 100 i really i really think that it is last it's gonna be an event and matt will be feeling better after the event i don't i don't hope so
Lars Rorbakken: No, I wish him the best, but... You don't wish him the best, come on. Yeah, I wish him the best, but I wish it to be... I hope he brings his all-time best energy, because that's the thing I love with him. I love his matches. He's so, you know, crazy. And I like that, and I hope I can match him.
Engin Terzi: I remember your match with Valera. Like, you look very cool and everything right now. I remember the match. They finished like 4-3, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah, 4-3. Yeah, so that's seven rounds.
Engin Terzi: I remember you, like, how aggressive, how, like, you look calm, but you have the same exact, you know, the fight in you. I remember that mistakenly you went to the side that the strap was going to come to Valera, but then when it was corrected, because every round that you had the buckle on your hand, you lost. And then, unless they accept the seven rounds, and then the seven rounds you won't, even the buckle was on your hands,
Lars Rorbakken: And it was just like very intense match. Very well. Yeah. I was pushed to the limit and I needed to dig, dig deep and get out something extra. So then it's, then it's really fun when you need to go deep down and, uh, bring your all time, uh, all time best out. So, um, yeah.
Engin Terzi: yeah there is a super chat real two eyes school boy introduced me to this sport seeing matt and devon matches from wl made me a fan we want that matt back love you matt he says yeah anyway so we will see it will be it will be great i i know the the number of the spectators they will be crazy crazy
Engin Terzi: And I think I wrote, you know, it will be the most exciting event. And people were like, oh, no, but they don't understand it. I mean, maybe there has been matches that like on the rankings, the higher level, but just the atmosphere of the venue is very, very important. Like as of now, till today, the most exciting arm wrestling event in the history I saw was when Devon and Dennis pulled.
Engin Terzi: And then when Devon and Devon pulled, it was incredible. It was incredible. You were there, Matt? I was. I was. Devon versus Devon. Saplinkov. Saplinkov and. Saplinkov match was. Yeah, okay. And then the Devon versus Devon match was just like crazy. Like you just didn't get how you call Aymeric Coast soccer match. When Real Madrid made a goal, like you get crazy there.
Engin Terzi: And now I think this one, I think this one will be the most exciting arm wrestling event history. I have no doubts because I know Aymeric, I used to live in US. I know how they get excited and they like to enjoy the event. And now a thousand people will be there, will be crazy, crazy atmosphere. And I kind of feel so bad that I cannot make it, this event.
Engin Terzi: What's that? You're not going to be there or what? No, no. Like with the time that I had to apply for visa and do all that long procedure. Yeah. I was in hospital having surgery and then I was hospitalized again. And then during the West West 13, again, I had another accident. They hit my head. So that one month was like a nightmare for me. So I can't. Yeah. I didn't know that. I thought you were going to be there. That's too bad. No, it's okay. We will see each other again, but.
Engin Terzi: I'm sure that regardless, it will be an incredible event. And I will be just all the time on the phone, like FaceTime, you know, with you guys. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, so can we talk a bit about the predictions, you guys? Yeah. OK, let's start with the before that. David, David Tom, he says, Hey, Matt, this one is all yours. Smash him. Thanks for making it happen.
Matt Mask: You hear that Lars? Hey. I hear it. Not good. Not good. It's not good. Yeah. So it's going to happen. It was commercial. Well, I don't want to talk. Um, yeah, we'll see what happens on August 10th. So all I can guarantee is one thing that we're going to blow the fucking roof off that fucking place. So if you haven't gotten fucking tickets already,
Engin Terzi: you ain't going to want to fucking miss this because pay-per-view is going to be nuts. But being there is going to be an absolutely fucking insane. So yeah, it was sold out like eight days before the event. And then we had to put extra tickets. We, we, we sacrifice from some parts, you know, and then anyway, so let, let, let's start, let's start with, um, Rymond's Lepins versus Ryan Ballinger. Do you know, do you know,
Matt Mask: Ryan, well, math? Not a whole lot. I'm just trying to look at the picture here. Strong, strong, real strong hand. Real strong wrist. Could be interesting. Could be really, really interesting. I think he's going to put Raimonds Coltrane in some deep waters right off the beginning.
Matt Mask: just because I think he's got some crazy raw power for the size of this man. Um, but, but I think coach Ray might come out on top on this just because his versatility and the way he's able to work those angles, right. His, his table IQ has really, really skyrocketed over the last couple of years, I believe so.
Engin Terzi: I think it's going to be 3-2 for Coach Ray, unfortunately. 3-2 for Coach Ray, okay. So Coach Ray will also have the, using the endurance advantage as well? Okay, Lars, what do you think about this match? I think Coach Ray, but I don't know that much about the other one, so it's hard to say, but Coach Ray has a lot of experience now, and he
Engin Terzi: travel around and arm wrestling all day long. So I think it will pull it off. OK, Doug. Doug Erlich said wild horse for the win. OK, there is there is a support from Team West. Yeah, anyway, so let's go to do OK while Doug is just super chatted. Douglas versus Hunter. Artem you guys familiar with Hunter?
Engin Terzi: a little bit but but not much but okay last last this is you are from europe and when these new guys are coming it is normal that you may not know the same thing happens to the some of the americans that they may not know uh the eastern guys so uh you don't need to predict you know if you don't know yeah it's okay yeah and and matt you probably know more
Matt Mask: Yeah, I know. I know them both. Hunter, I just got to recently see him pull. Very, very impressive. Doug, I've known for many, many years. Looking forward to hanging out with him and everybody else in Florida.
Matt Mask: I'm honestly on the fence on this one just because what I see Hunter do in his last super match. I know Doug hasn't been super, super active. Hunter's hungry as fuck. I really don't know what's going to happen with this. I know the amount of power that Doug can bring to the table when he gets connected.
Matt Mask: But Hunter's explosiveness, I think, may cause an issue for Doug. If Doug can stall him out, I think we're going to end up with a war, and I could see Doug possibly taking over. But the way Hunter explodes, just his finesse, probably one of the most crisp hooks I've ever seen somebody perform, especially at that level, just the way he does.
Matt Mask: drives in everything's all one smooth fluid motion and it's quick very very very quick so if if he can't do it now i bet you it won't be long and he's going to be able to that's for sure so yeah he's definitely i say north america probably one of the biggest up-and-comers so yeah yeah and the good good thing is that he also says the same thing he he what did he wrote to me let me check here hunter says
Matt Mask: He said, I am coming to save the North Aymeric. He's talking about generally going to win the title. And the potential, like he's got a hook where he can bang with, I believe, a lot of them North Aymeric or Europeans, right? So just with how quick and how smooth and crisp and everything he is into it, it's, yeah, it's definitely...
Engin Terzi: He's definitely one you want to be keeping your eye on. So what I like is that they want to, when I see that they're having such goal, that, that, that part is for me, like, I mean, incredible, like, because I don't want them people to think that, oh, the Eastern Europeans are too strong. So like, you understand to, to accept that, like, yeah, that, that, that sucks. You know, that, that is why I wrote once, maybe if you remember,
Engin Terzi: If you are from the same country of John Burzin, Graham Bass, you know, Cobra, Dave Patton, you know, Gary Goodrich, and Devon, and many other guys, you can't say that, you know, it's too hard for me. That is a responsibility if you have the potential. If you don't have potential, I understand, but if you have the potential, you need to
Engin Terzi: run after it okay chris says chris cray craft engine high engine is sitting first come first sir yes my friend hopefully next time we will do with the seat numbers doc eric says that large for the win that that didn't you just said that wild horse for the win come on i think he's messing with you
Engin Terzi: He's probably saying that because I set him up in the air. Let's go to the other match. This is another West vs. West match. Corey West vs. Travis Benjamin. Left arm. Lars. Hard to say. Really hard to say. I hope... Corey West looks so strong now lately with what I'm seeing.
Lars Rorbakken: If Travis is like he was before, something close to that, he's very hard to stop and left. I've seen him, like you have, of course, do incredible things with his left. But I really don't know. I think it's 50-50. Because Travis is still unknown, right? Yeah, I don't know his level now. And Matt?
Matt Mask: I'm kind of same thing up in there. It all depends on what kind of Travis Bajan shows up. So if he's actually working on his power and everything else, I believe he could take it. I think Corey West is a stronger person if he can stop Travis's hit and
Matt Mask: not let Travis get everything he wants in the setup because Travis is a master of that, then I think it's Corey West. But if Travis is actually working on more strength and he's taking it more serious, I think Travis has a chance.
Matt Mask: But it's just hard to say. It's hard to say. Yeah, but Travis talks a lot, right? So he says he's taking it serious. I'd have to physically see him and shake his hand.
Matt Mask: to order bail to tell if he's actually taking it serious or not. Right. Trust me. I, I, I, I see he's taking seriously, but the, his law, I think he needed a little bit more time. And is no joke. You know, he's just getting better and better. This is a left arm match, isn't it? Right. He lost. Right. So right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And the child's child has always been like his left has always been way better than his right.
Matt Mask: He's way more crisp in his hit, his setup, his bang on. So he's more, I think he's better in his left than he is his right. I think if Corey can contain his hit, Travis hits, then it's over. Oh yeah, for sure. Because I don't think Travis has had enough time to build his power up to where it used to be years ago. Some people I saw that, you know,
Engin Terzi: they were talking about Corey's copy. The copy of Corey is about his right arm. His left arm is more, you know, pronating and hitting outside, you know, so just to inform some people. Elizabeth versus Aleksandra. Artem you guys familiar? A little bit. Aleksandra is schoolboy's brother's wife. And Elizabeth
Engin Terzi: She won the qualifications last two times. And she deserved a match at the West versus West. And she's very, very strong. That's what I see. I think technically Aleksandra is ahead. But power-wise, it looks like Elizabeth is ahead. I agree. Elizabeth looks like the stronger one. Maybe not the most technical. But she looks impressively strong now. And how do you guys see this match?
Engin Terzi: i don't know much about alexander so i alexandria so i have to pass on this one okay i think elizabeth you think elizabeth yeah but do you know the team east is gonna shoot you because of you know saying that team west will win i'm joking anyway so let's go let's go to
Engin Terzi: Paul Talbott versus Raj, Matt. Yeah, that one. You know what I heard, Matt? What's that? Pauline told me that he has never, ever, ever seen Paul Talbott this strong. He said to me that, again, Paul was always great at the table, but in the gym, he wasn't that strong. He said right now he is incredibly strong, both at the table and in the gym.
Engin Terzi: And he said that he kind of believes that Paul, not kind of, he says that he would even bet money on it.
Matt Mask: Yeah. Yeah. It's I haven't seen Paul active in a while. I know when he was active WL, his left arm was absolutely unstoppable. Nobody was able to come close to him, especially when he got into the straps and he got that connection in there. So it's it's I think if the old Paul Talbott shows up, especially if he's stronger than what it was, there's many people on the planet that can can compete with him left arm. Justin
Matt Mask: just the connection and everything he has with it is absolutely insane so so i'm yeah i'm going to say i'm going to say paul on this one especially what do you think about what do you think about russian paul in said um i only seen him compete once i believe it was at east versus west right no rich rich they never competed right he's the armenian guy that lives in u.s with the incredible left arm yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i know who you're talking about
Matt Mask: I still think Paul. I think Paul can do it. Because he's going to be shooting inside. Paul's going to be coming out tall. Paul has a way longer arm. I think Paul's going to be able to get the connection that he needs to crack his wrist. And from there, I think it's going to be close. But I think Paul's going to take it 3-1. That's my guess. Lars, are you familiar with both at this? Yeah, a little bit. But I know...
Lars Rorbakken: I know Paul best. So for actually Matt stole my words. What I'm seeing about Paul before, I totally agree with Matt. So I don't know that much about what you call it. He was the other guy. I'm really, really strong inside. I think I know who it is, but I may mix him with some other. But I think Paul will
Lars Rorbakken: I have too much leverage. That's what I think. Okay. And Justin Bishop versus Giannis Amolins. Oh, that's a hard one. Yeah. That's the thing with these matches. It's so hard to predict. It's so hard to predict. But I think Giannis will find a way. After all, he's the Jedi. So he should.
Matt Mask: And Matt? I don't really know where Justin is right now. I know Justin, when he's on, he is absolutely on.
Matt Mask: They have had matches in the past and it kind of went both ways. I think Justin came on top on it. That was in the UAL days. Uh, Janis has been a lot more active with a lot less injuries over the last six, seven years. Like Janis, I don't think has ever really stopped. I don't think Janis has ever had any major injuries in his elbows or his shoulders or anything, just his conditioning.
Matt Mask: forearm wrestling is absolutely insane uh i know justin has had some issues over the last four or five years with his shoulder his elbows so it's it's really hard to say what justin bishop's going to show up i think if justin shows up 100 we're going to be in for a treat and it's going to be a war um if justin isn't 100 then he's
Matt Mask: Aiken and tweaking anywhere. No, no, Justin says he is in great shape. He says, yeah, we all say that, right? We all say that. I don't know. He has been taking it seriously. Evgeny with the short notice he pulled against Mindaugas, if you remember, there was 3-2 and the guy who had... Oh, 100%. And then Mindaugas went on to go undefeated for how long? Until he just recently lost, right? So it's...
Matt Mask: It's so hard to fucking say in this one. Justin because I know how smart Giannis is on the table, how conditioned he is, how he hasn't really stopped training consistently for the last...
Matt Mask: five ten years you know what i mean he's been always active doing something right so whether he's training other people or he's training himself bishop has been up and down right so yeah i'm i honestly i know i'm going to be sitting front row with my popcorn in hand for this one that's all i'm i can't make a prediction because i'm bad okay yeah and let's go to artem taranenko versus that's right arm
Engin Terzi: right arm yeah see artem's coming in a lot bigger right yeah he is he will probably the on the competition hour he will probably be more than 20 pounds heavier more than 10 kilo heavier than yeah i would say um and yeah i make dog this is technical as
Matt Mask: so cocky as hell but super super technical right yeah so uh i i think i think artem is going to take this one just because artem is the bigger man i think artem's going to be able to power through him where as ming dao is pulling guys his own size they aren't able to power through i think artem's going to be able to power through certain positions and get him into angles that he wants to get him so that's what i think
Lars Rorbakken: And Lars? I think 3-1 for an Artem. Hard to say, but I may think Miragos have too many options and he may find a way too, but I think it will be, this one as well, will be a very close match, I think. Yeah. So as far as it's going, by going with the predictions of Matt Mask, West is going to dominate West so far.
Engin Terzi: i haven't said that i don't know listen your predictions does it not you yeah kind of put the air on some of them so yeah but it's like like four wins for west and two is like 50 50 or something like that yeah yeah yeah but then we start getting into interesting ones right and all of them are interesting all of them yeah these ones start to get a little more a little okay okay okay how about how about how about the the
Matt Mask: the wild horse versus the Norwegian? I can't predict nothing. So I'm not predicting nothing. I'm just going to show you what's going to happen. Okay. And Lars? I have to do the same. What's the word you say? Word is cheap. So we have to do... Actions speak louder than words. Yeah, yeah.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, anyways. Okay, then let's continue. Craig Tullier versus Tom Holland. I say Craig Tullier. I think Craig Tullier 3-1. Lars, are you familiar with both of those? Yeah, I was thinking last time I saw Greg Tullier,
Lars Rorbakken: least live was i think it was in arnold classic some years ago and then he impressed me a lot he's very good hit and hard to stop it's like uh reminds me a little bit of pauline yeah yeah yeah the style and uh yeah i i think greg julia okay
Lars Rorbakken: And Frank Lampirelli versus Dave Sheffield. That one is really exciting, yes, exciting. Hard to say this one as well. Actually, you have said so many good close matches where I was reading the cards from days ago and I was
Lars Rorbakken: I can't predict any of this. It's so close, everyone. So I'm not sure. I'm not sure. Frank impressed me a lot lately. But if Dave is injury-free and strong as he was maybe one year or two years ago, it can be a hard day for Frank. But yeah, for me, it's one of the most exciting matches. Okay. And Matt?
Matt Mask: uh it all depends on how dave is actually feeling i know his neck there was some issues with it uh he wasn't quite being able to connect like he he has been able to but so you are saying that are you saying that if he is not feeling so good brain will beat him i think if he's not feeling if he's not feeling 90 or better
Engin Terzi: I think Frank could beat him, yeah. Justin because... Do you remember that when Frank toppled you, you were still able to fight this way? Devon't you think that Dave can fight in such way? Justin remember his matches with
Matt Mask: I think he's way better at a press than I am. I think Dave's ability to be able to contain a person too from coming outside of them is better than what mine is as well.
Matt Mask: I think when Dave is on, his hand is absolutely fucking steel. So I, yeah, like I'm saying if Dave isn't 85% or better, then Frank has a chance. But I think Dave is going to come into this. I need to be able to have a conversation with him just to see how he's feeling. But I think Dave's going to 3-0 Frank.
Matt Mask: And just Dave is a bigger human being in general, right? And he's a lot more, he's more physically, more in physical better form, I believe, than Frank, too. Frank is strong, super thick hand, but he carries around a little extra weight that he probably doesn't need to. Dave is a lot more chiseled, right? So Dave doesn't have any extra weight that he's carrying around. So basically, basically, Frank...
Matt Mask: has possibility to top roll Dave, but it will not mean that the match is over. No, 100%. His elbow is not bothering him, and he takes Dave's hand. I think Dave's side pressure and ability to flop is tenfold compared to mine. So, like, he's a lot more connected in his elbow, and he has a lot more power than I do.
Matt Mask: So I still think even if Frank must take Dave's hand, I think Dave still has a good chance. Yeah, so I'm thinking that. Yeah. And Aymeric Bredin versus Jonathan Breda. Matt. You know Aymeric from France? Yeah, I've seen him pull. I think it was your last West versus West you did. He pulled, didn't he? Or it was when he pulled. Didn't he pull...
Matt Mask: ah help me out here again come on didn't he just pull uh what's his name from the state oh my god i can't believe i can't remember his name right now robby rob toppy he just pulled he beat him yeah i think that one very close was that right down was it right down left hand left hand
Matt Mask: Left arm. Left arm, yeah. And he went through Rob pretty convincingly. So, and I don't know if Brita would be able to do that to Rob. So, I'm going to say Brita is probably a good chance he may lose this one. I'm going to say 3-1 for Pradeen's.
Lars Rorbakken: And Lars, you know, both guys? Yeah. I think I agree with Matt from the matches and the thing I'm seeing from them. I think I have to agree with Matt. Okay. And last five matches. Kamil Jablonski, Michael Todd, right arm.
Lars Rorbakken: Let's start with Lars. Yeah, this is one of the ones I'm really excited to as well. Can Mike do what he did to me? Because Camille is bigger than me and stronger than me. I think he weighs the same as I was back when I was at my biggest, but I think he's even stronger than I was. So if Mike can, what you call, deny his line,
Lars Rorbakken: And Mike for sure, but if he can't. Then it will be. A tough match. I think it's very hard to stop Camille in the defense, but on the other side you have seen Mike hold on to like Jerry for minutes and minutes after minutes, so this this is have potential to be one of the real screamers, I think. But it's hard to predict.
Matt Mask: I like Camille, but I'm cheering for Mike on this one since he beat the crap out of me. So I hope they win this one. And Matt? Yeah, I'm kind of on the fence on this one too. It's hard to say. I don't think Todd is where he was when he beat Jerry that one time. And I think Camille has a little bit of a different angle than Jerry does, the way he chops in on the arm.
Matt Mask: I think it takes someone that's got the capability of really being able to suck somebody into a hook and expose their bicep in order to be able to beat Camille.
Matt Mask: Someone like Matushenko. Exactly. Exactly like that. Bail to just come in and just turn them upside down where their biceps exposed is not able to get that connection. And I don't think Todd has that. I think Todd has the ability to go frame to frame, but I think Camille has more power in order to be able to push him against his frame and expose him. Todd's definitely going to have that stop as King moves where he comes down.
Matt Mask: but I think being opened up, Camille is going to be able to push through it. I think Camille is probably, there's a good chance Camille is going to take this one, especially when Todd is supposed to be leaner and lighter, as opposed to if we had a 280-pound Michael Todd come in, then I think it'd be more of a match, but I don't think we're going to see that. No, no, I think he will be around 290. Yeah, I think he's gaining fast a lot.
Engin Terzi: Really? Yeah. It could be interesting. Also, Kamil is around 305 or something. I don't think it will be much different when they meet in weight. I think it will be close. Maybe 5 kg behind or something. It's going to be interesting then.
Engin Terzi: Michael needs to pass the center. Yeah. In a defensive position. I don't know if he has the speed to do it, though. I don't know. Mask Lars. That's the thing. I think he has. Yeah. If not, I'm getting... The middle is very fast, too, right? Very explosive, so... Yeah, yes.
Matt Mask: Yeah. Let's see. You guys, if you guys pull that 253 pounds, a 253-pound Michael Todd is quicker than a 285, 290-pound Michael Todd as well. For sure. For sure. But 290 will be probably stronger than 250. Yeah. So... Let's see. Let's see. We will all have the answers, you know, just as a prediction. We all can be wrong. We'll all know the answers. One week from now, I'll tell you exactly what fucking is going to happen. So...
Engin Terzi: Mask me all these questions again in one week and I'll get them 100% correct. Oh, yeah. Listen, this is what I was saying. Go outside, ask someone on the street that they don't know about arm wrestling. They have 50% chance to predict correctly. Yeah. Anyway, so let's go. Let's go, let's go. Rustam Babaiev versus Pauline. I'm going Pauline.
Engin Terzi: Did Rustam lose last time because he got injured or he got injured because of Paul's hard inside hit? That's the question. Yeah, that's the question.
Matt Mask: I think Paul is stronger and he's smarter and he's better and he continues to get stronger and better as he progresses. And I think Babaiev has kind of hit a peak and I think he's still top, top, top three in the world for his weight class. But I don't think he's gone any better than he has been.
Engin Terzi: And I think Paul Linn is just continuing to progress. His dedication, everything that he has is continuing to progress. I say 3-1 Paul Linn. Yeah, I understand. Paul Linn, I mean, amazing guy. He represents, like he's mentally also very strong. And his view of the things, you know,
Engin Terzi: Like so positive, so brave, smart, no giving up, you know, just like, like everything he has is like everything. And he is not only thinking of himself. He is a leader, you know, he, he really cares about every guy that is representing his country in West. You know, he, he's just ready to take responsibility, you know, and like, I, I really, like, I think he is the role model.
Engin Terzi: all the guys that, you know, just, you know, growing, you know, with the international dreams, goals, you know, those guys need to really follow his... I don't think we're done seeing what Paul Linn is capable of for a long time. So I think he's going to continue to progress. Yeah. The one advantage for sure Rustam has...
Engin Terzi: incredible experience, you know, just something that Paul is heavily underdog about experience part and say, not about power, not about and the interesting thing is that both of these guys are incredibly offensive guys. They are not defensive guys, incredible offensive. So when you hear the ready go, you will see like
Engin Terzi: really big clash, you know, just like we did at the start. And now I believe that whoever puts the other one to the losing position, I think is going to win. I don't think that they will be able to bring the other one from losing position. Maybe it can happen, but it's both. I would just say that if their defense is 80, their offense is 100. How do you see this, Lars? Polin has impressed me a lot lately.
Lars Rorbakken: especially last King of the Table when he, what he did to Lachlan was so, so powerful. But I did, I don't know Rustam that well, but personally, but I've done a lot of... You don't know Rustam so well? Not personally, but I know his pulling very well. So I've been a lot of Worlds and Europeans. I've seen him a lot of pulling. I was,
Lars Rorbakken: Uh, bad, bad expression for me. I know him very well. He's pulling. Yeah. Yeah. He dominated the whole world. That's what I remember in the back of my head, all the Europeans I was through and all the walls. And he was so, so strong and so impressive. So that sticks to my brain at Rustam in shape. It's a very, very scary dude. Very scary dude. Yeah. Um,
Lars Rorbakken: If he can get anything close to his shape back then when he was at his peak, it will be hard. A hard match for Paul Wijn, for sure. And the question, like you said, what happened last time? Did he get injured because Paul was too strong or was it just bad luck? We don't know. Yeah, we don't know. The first two rounds, he tried to top-roll him. It was a very bad choice.
Engin Terzi: And then Rustam's hand is incredibly strong. And then he just beat him. And then because he wanted to probably get away from his hook, because Rustam is known mainly as a good hook puller. As I told you, from all the Europeans and wars, I hardly can remember anyone taking Rustam's hand. I'm sure it happened sometimes, but I can't remember seeing it. Yeah, maybe, maybe very seldom, you know, with, with, I think with, I top roll him.
Engin Terzi: But long ago at the waffles and then I saw I can prove again him, I think that I think 2013 Europeans, he was like, but he was just for school and then they got tired and then they started. I don't remember exactly what but fresh for fresh. It is very, very, very hard. Evgeny John had a very hard time to, you know, trying to. What I meant, but I'm trying to say what I say, I don't know what's done that what I don't know.
Engin Terzi: How is he living? How is training? Is he all into it? Does he work much? No, no, no. I think he's very focused because he came to West vs. West twice. He lost twice. One was very close to Irakli and someone giving Irakli that close fight at that category you see how Irakli right now was very impressive, Rustam. And then the other one was he got injured. We don't know what will happen. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: But we can't take anything away from Paul. Technically, he will. But I just say that Rustam probably cannot really afford to lose three times, come in three times and lose a legend like this. But to me, with me, his credit is so big. Evgeny if he loses five times, he has two credits, you understand? But I don't think that... For me as well. Yeah. For me, like one of the...
Engin Terzi: for sure top 10 greatest armwrestler of all time, or I should say successful armwrestler of all time, you know. Anyways, we will see. We will see how it will happen. And you are saying that it would be very hard for Paul if, in my opinion, if Rustam is as strong as Paul, then it is hard for Paul because Rustam is the one with more experience and knowledge. But if Paul is physically stronger, then your experience may not really matter so much. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: Okay, another one, another revenge. Evgeny Prudnik versus Tata Sings. And, okay, I didn't like the face of Matt. I think...
Matt Mask: I think Prudnik has the recipe for Todd. He's exploited it very well last time, but Todd is very good at adapting. I think when Todd loses a certain way and he gets out angled, Todd goes to the drawing board and just dissects the fuck out of everything. He dissects his workouts, he dissects his angles, he dissects his hits.
Matt Mask: i think this is one that's probably eaten them for a bit especially with how convincingly prudnik was able to beat todd so i i'm interested i'm really excited to see this i wanted to i want to see what todd's going to be able to bring pull out of his little tickle trunk there this time so
Matt Mask: I don't know, but I think Prudnik could possibly do it again, but I think Todd is going to switch shit right the fuck up, and I believe it could be a possibility we could see Todd come out on top on this one. But, I don't know. We saw last time, yeah, last time Prudnik
Lars Rorbakken: clearly find a line to beat Todd, but I think as much as Matt was pointing out that I think Todd is really aware of that line and maybe do some
Matt Mask: Contra-attacks or something. Top roll now and everything else. I think you might see Todd come in with a top roll right off to begin in just to protect that angle. Then from there, once he gets that angle blocked, then he can engage his side pressure, right? Because you're seeing Todd top rolling a lot more than he has in a long, long time. So he never really... And maybe Todd is even stronger now than last time they met, maybe.
Engin Terzi: so yeah last last time wasn't wasn't close last time was was not close but there are some matches that they are not closed and once it is closed the things change dramatically yeah but but that's the thing that's it that's that's the fun part with arm wrestling it can looks like it's not close at all but we all know it can be just small adjustments and percentage to turn it around
Engin Terzi: different hits and angles and all of a sudden somebody's back in the game. Right. So. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. I only can tell you one thing without going into details. Prudnik in Orlando will be stronger than Prudnik. They pull against directly. Yeah. Well, anyways, he's going to have to be. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, so let's go.
Matt Mask: John Brzenk versus Leonidas. I love Leonidas. I think he's awesome. Such a great dude. I actually got a chance to get to know him personally. I believe he's a way better left arm arm wrestler than he is a right arm arm wrestler. I think John is going to show him what John does. So I think it's a mismatch and a confidence booster for John.
Engin Terzi: uh just one information that i have been in touch with his team and everything right now his right is stronger than his left just just yeah yeah and so you are saying that it's a mismatch and john is gonna dominate him i think so yeah i think so my honest opinion and lars yeah i'm not sure if john gonna dominating but i think he's still
Lars Rorbakken: Not experienced enough to face John. I think he will find some lane to defeat him. But it depends a little bit on John's feeling now. He has a lot of shoulder issues. And I think he has maybe some problem with going sideways. But his hand should be able to get a good position and maybe do it from there. I don't think he can tire Leonidas out. So we have to be
Engin Terzi: efficient and do it. Yeah, I agree. Evgeny such a young guy like schoolboy get exhausted against Leonidas. Yeah. And there is a super chat DB talks. Matt, I know you could have won all matches that you lost recently if you were in the shape that pin Hermes in the rematch. Will that form return? He's working on it.
Matt Mask: He's working on it. So a lot has happened the last couple of years, but it's, I think it's all slowly starting to come together. So, and the recovery and everything from stem cells and everything else I think has really, really helped progress it. So. And let's go. Jerry Cadillac versus Alex Kurdecha. Who wants to start first? Go ahead. Uh,
Lars Rorbakken: For me, that's wide open as well, but maybe I have a slight edge on Jerry. He looks, he's so... Can you explain to us why? Yeah, I think it's hard to pin Jerry. I think the size advantage could actually have, maybe will actually work against him with that long, big arm and with Jerry's diving in. I think he may end up in a bad position.
Lars Rorbakken: But the question is if you can pull right through him anyway, if Krodace is that strong. I think it would be, no matter what happened, I think it would be a long match. I'm pretty sure it would be a long match. Okay. I...
Matt Mask: I think if you would have asked me this question about a year ago, I would have said Jerry Hansdown. Justin with the way Kurdecha used to set up in his top role, he would expose himself. He would kind of sit down into himself where his arm and everything would be more exposed to a flawless press.
Matt Mask: the alex predetta that i've seen show up lately has completely changed the way i looked at alex and i think alex's level is getting extreme you're seeing alex jumping into presses he's staying more connected he's coming out he's coming in um
Matt Mask: I think Alex is a lot smarter arm wrestler than he used to be. He's not just relying on his power. I feel that he's watched a lot of videos where Jerry has been in deep waters and what needed to be done in order to be able to pin him, but some of the other opponents weren't able to.
Matt Mask: And I think Credet now has the capabilities of being able to transition from top rolls to presses. I think he has enough power where if he grabs Jerry low enough, he's going to prevent Jerry from coming in across the table. He could suck him over, separate him enough from his shoulder. I think Jerry is going to surprise him once or twice or get in a position that he didn't expect and maybe get him a little more opened up.
Matt Mask: but I think Kurdecha is gonna adjust, and I see Kurdecha taking this 132. I think it's gonna be a war, but Kurdecha, I think Kurdecha is really starting to do this right now. And I think Jerry has been like this for about the last seven years. The question, like Jerry is known as someone who has incredible endurance.
Engin Terzi: And Alex is not that level of endurance. Of course, he has good endurance. I'm starting to fucking change my thought on that. The way him and Morozov went at it. Because Morozov... Listen, just one thing. Alex, he always told me personally that his left arm level is somewhere else.
Engin Terzi: Yeah. He like, whenever he pulled Corey West, right arm that you remember, they had some trouble. And then when they pulled after pull with left arm was just like, like nothing, you know? Yeah. So I'm not saying that like his right arm doesn't have the,
Engin Terzi: endurance but left arm is different and like we have never seen him doing those kind of things with right arm but left arm that was a left arm match he had with uh morozov wasn't it yeah it was a left arm match yeah yeah yeah so what i just tried to say that like i don't see jerry like flash pinning alex
Matt Mask: Um, and for some reason I thought his and Alex and, uh, Morris off match was a right on match for some reason. That's how it was. Yeah. Well, what I'm just saying is my prediction. Um, I think, I, I think he is still getting better, but I, yeah, I'm going to see Jerry three, two. So I think Alex is going to be relying a lot more on a top role and I don't know his ability to build, to drive into a press after he's top rolled somebody.
Matt Mask: with his right arm for some reason was thinking that his left was his right so i think i think jerry has enough enough side pressure to hold him up in that position so i i think i think alex has the potential to but yeah i'm gonna have to go with jerry on this one i was thinking left arm for some reason yeah it's like for me jerry can win most likely sorry alex if alex wins he will be like most likely three zero
Engin Terzi: domination. But if Jerry is winning one and especially two rounds, I think that this may exhaust Alex. I think Alex needs to be honest.
Engin Terzi: Alex is so strong and then beats him. But if he's that strong and beats him, it will be 3-0 anyways, you understand? But if Jerry is able to win one round or two rounds, then... Evgeny just hold him up. Once he starts to hold him up a bit, if he gets in a position where he's top-rolling and he's really cranking on it,
Matt Mask: and and jerry's able to hold him up i think that'll be the tsn turning point unless kradecha is able to hammer him over to the side and transition to a quick press while jerry's shoulder i think he i think he can do it then but yeah it's i haven't seen him be able to do that with his right here so yeah i agree with right time we didn't see but
Matt Mask: You never know what he prepares. We don't know what he prepares. Yeah. So, and I don't think he's just coming into it with his original game plan. I think he's coming into it with a plan of attack to be able to attack Jerry in a position where he's looking, you know what I mean? He's working his angles. These last couple of months, he's definitely been working his angles. If he's just concentrating on the top role, he's going about it all wrong. I think it's going to be all about angles with Jerry.
Engin Terzi: Did you guys hear the news about Yoshinobi Kanai coming back? I just saw a picture you both sent. Is he for sure coming back? Yeah. Evgeny his mask is dead, but I'm not going to announce it. Matt, you know Yoshinobi, right? I think so, yeah. You know the Japanese guy? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, he's coming back.
Engin Terzi: And what do you guys also think? Justin shortly, we talked like Devon making 105. Matt, I know he's like your brother, but objectively, do you see him dominating or some having some hard time there, even he wins? Or like, did you watch his last matches, Petrenko's against Ongarbev and David Darrikan? Yeah. Yeah, I think, I think
Matt Mask: 105 kg Devon is completely different than 120 kg Devon. There are two completely different human beings. But mind you, Devon weighing in at 105 doesn't mean he's going to be pulling out 105.
Matt Mask: Devon weighing in at 105, we're probably pulling at 115, right? Justin like Devon weighing in at 115, he's pulling at 120, 122. So it's- He can really gain 10 kilo? He can really gain 22 pounds? I think he can gain about 15 pounds, 12 to 15 pounds of water. Yeah. 12 pounds, 11 pounds is five kilo. But even when you take the water,
Matt Mask: you you do the water cut like do you feel 100 uh no not really myself i usually don't have to like i if i do a water cut it's usually about a four or five pound water cut i usually get myself within reason of that weight class and it's just a quick four or five pounds and then i'm right back into it so but
Matt Mask: I can't do the whole water cut, don't eat for two days shit, right? So I start to get really cranky after about eight hours of not eating. So I just eat leaner, get myself closer to that weight, and then just cut out five pounds or so. Yeah. So what do you think about this, Lars? So basically, what is that mask? What is it, like Petrenko and Devon push? Devon dominates him?
Engin Terzi: What's that, sorry? So what is the answer? Justin say Petrenko and Devon Poole. Devon dominates him? I don't know if he's going to dominate him at that weight. I don't think he'd dominate him. And Petrenko has any chance to win? I think he does. Yeah, he's pretty fucking impressive. I didn't expect him to do what he did to Dadakan, that's for sure. Did you expect what he did to Ongarbev?
Matt Mask: I didn't expect to see what he did tongue to buy of either. So his, his level of trajectory right now, I think is absolutely insane. So he, he, he said that he's going to do redemption or under a pushcard for his magic. Yeah. Yeah. And last, what do you think about this subject? Um,
Lars Rorbakken: I think, of course, it has to affect Devon because he doesn't have that much fat. So when he's pretty lean and he has to go down that much, it will affect him. But I know, like Matt's pointing out, that he has good experience from... Watercut? Yeah, watercut. I know he can do a big watercut and go back again and feels well. I think it's both knowledge and both individual difference because
Lars Rorbakken: Some people can do it and some can't. I can't do a big water cut. When I eat again, I cramp up and nothing works. But I know he can do it and I think that will help him a lot. I for sure think he can do it, yeah. He won't lose that much in his hand, I think. I think that's the last thing to go. Maybe in his
Matt Mask: side pressure but um he will lose a little bit but i think for sure he can do it okay anyways guys thank you very much do you have any last words to each other to the fans or anything no good luck and we'll see all your august 10th except for you we'll see you on video august 10th yeah i hope um
Lars Rorbakken: i i honestly think this will be the best east versus west so far with this card and in u.s and uh crowd as you're pointing out so i hope a lot of people will support this support their event and buy the pay-per-view and tune in and we will do our best to make it uh i have no doubt i i i see 32 warriors 32 warriors that is just gonna make their just
Engin Terzi: How did you say, Matt? Blow the roof? Blow the fucking roof off the place. Okay. Anyways, thank you very much, Matt. Thank you very much, Lars. And I wish you guys good luck. Yeah, you bet. We'll chat soon. Take care, guys.
