Host: Okay, Dave Chaffee. Okay. Hey, Dave. But if you can maybe turn the phone like this, so it fills out more of the screen.
Host: Yes, much better, much, much better. Okay, I can't hear you. Your mic is turned off. Hey, Dave. Okay, why am I here? How about that? Can you hear me now? Yes, yes, now I can. All right, cool. Okay, we are live. We're just waiting for Frank. He will join us. Good to see you, Dave.
Dave Chaffee: You too. How are you doing? I'm really sorry. I messed up the times. This time difference is very... I apologize, buddy. It's okay. No big deal. I took a little nap, so I'm ready to go. Oh, that's even better. That's even better. So how are you doing? I'm good. I'm good. I can't complain. I'm ready. I've been training hard. So I can't wait. We've got less than 10 days until this match.
Dave Chaffee: So I'm prepared. I'm excited. You know, it's been a while. So it's going to be a fun match, I think. So I'm looking forward to it. How's your neck? How's all the things that are keeping you a little bit away? Yeah, my neck's the same. I just deal with the issues, basically. I don't know if that's ever going to get better without the surgery. But I feel great. Otherwise, my hand feels good. Elbow, I've been able to train my side pressure really well. Like I said, my hand's feeling good.
Dave Chaffee: Everything else is great. I've had a good training session. I got I have no excuses. So you know if I if I lose this match then Frank's the better man. So it's going to be a good one. I can't wait.
Host: that's as usual I think you're always ready and uh I wanted I wanted to ask you like um you had those net like neck issues for quite some time uh does it radiate like with the nerves on your arm like you know like sometimes you will like for me I have not from neck but some other places like nerve problems and sometimes like I have power and then it's gone and then it comes back and it's all the time like this and I can't figure it out or for you it's different yeah it
Dave Chaffee: Well, the pain situation, like I can sit here, I'm fine. But if I move my neck, just I got to go like that. It shoots a pain all the way down, right down the back of my shoulder blade and stuff like that. I got two fingers that have been numb for a couple of years. It is what it is. So it's, you know, it's what I've dealt with, with, you know, arm wrestling over the years has probably done this to me. But, you know, I can't complain. I've done what I've done.
Host: Yeah, well, we're always ready to suffer, right? It's like you want this, like it comes with a price, right? Yeah, those nerve issues, they're the worst because like you said, like you have those fingers numb. And for me, it just comes and goes, just comes and goes sometimes. Like I have good side pressure on my arm and then it's gone. And so I kind of can figure out what I have to do so I can have it on competition.
Dave Chaffee: but it's still slippery right so yeah I'm with me with me it's probably been going on for about I want to say five six years now um and when it first happened I could do therapy and the pain would go away after a couple months of doing therapy I would start to feel better like I had gotten a couple shots in my neck and that would help but it's been probably over two years now where the pain just is not gone away no matter what I do basically so
Dave Chaffee: Like I said, I think eventually it just, you know, surgery is going to be the, you know, what's going to have to happen, but I'm not ready for that yet. So that'll be down the road sometime.
Host: uh where do you feel it uh kind of calls you a little bit back can you cannot engage fully or it's the wrist that goes or is it or it's more mental because sometimes like I can pull right the pain is there but when I'm pulling I don't care much about it like it's more about what I train because it's always there right and it's it's the training problem it is the issues of it hurting while I'm training so there's certain things I can't do
Dave Chaffee: i want to do you know i've done my whole career so i've had to like you know change some things around basically when i'm on the table in a match you got so much adrenaline going you don't really feel anything you know you know how it is but it's you know upcoming you know the months of training and training where i like to do certain things where you just got to ease up and i can't go quite as heavy as i wanted to go and and you know stuff like that basically
Host: yeah I understand like I think it's uh I talk with a lot of guys and not everyone has those problems they have different problems but uh you know the nerves and then it's a lot of a lot of things just go away in the match right problem is we make it worse crazy Lars you have yeah where you should be you should probably take you know some time off between matches instead you're like oh you know just
Dave Chaffee: Somebody offers you a match. I'm not going to turn it down. So you're, you're just doing match after match after match. Whereas, you know, some rest will probably do you some good, but this time around, I think I pulled in February. So I took a little, you know, I took a little bit of time off and it's, you know, probably a month or two just to rest. And it's actually done me some good. I've been training really, really hard, you know, since then. So I think it's going to make a little bit of a difference, hopefully. So, Hmm.
Host: i don't want to talk about the frank before he gets here i saw he just read my message so he should join us uh uh last time you pulled the king of table versus vitaly laletin what can you talk about that match like well like um what happened how did you feel and i mean it was just his hand is so strong you can't really get away from him basically if i could have got to the straps
Dave Chaffee: might have been a little bit of a different story but he's he's so so strong he's getting better um I couldn't get where I wanted to be basically um he's like I said his hand's impressive his grip is ridiculous like I mean you know he's got one of the strongest grips in the world basically so if you're trying to get away from that good luck you know it's it's really it's really difficult but yeah I was all in long right so he's holding exactly under him
Dave Chaffee: And I think it just broke world record. Like, and I think it was his world record, like that grip. Yeah. Yeah. Whereas, whereas my grip is not, it's not very good at all. I don't do any grip work or anything like that. So I kind of knew going in and, you know, do it be kind of hard to get where I want it to be. And he had a great game plan going in. I give him all the credit in the world. Um, and he's, he's moving up, man, just watching him, what he's done, you know, the last match, how he pulled was incredible. So it's, he's, he's, he's fun to watch. So, yeah, he's,
Host: He's one of my favorite pullers now, really. He's a class act on the table, off the table. So, yeah, I love Vitaly. So how do you see him as a possibility to pull with Levan? Evgeny though, like, he lost to... He lost to Hermes, right? And Hermes might be in front of him. But how do you see that match? Is he... The Hermes match was a little bit ago. And I see...
Dave Chaffee: Vitaly making gains. And you look at him, he's looking like he's getting a little bigger. Every time he pulls, he looks like he's getting a little bigger, a little thicker. He looks different. I think he's not that he wasn't taking it serious before, but I think he's very serious, you know, about his arm wrestling career right now. And I think, of course, he's got a shot. I mean, obviously, he'd be the underdog. You know, anybody going up against LeVon is going to be the underdog, 100%.
Host: But it can be done. That's why we pool, that's why we get on the table, because anything can happen. Well, we have Frank and Martino joining us. Hey, guys. Ciao. Hi. Frank, are you in training? Yes, yes, yes. Yeah, it's training. Sorry, there is a bit of...
Host: Because they're like, okay, guys, I hope you will hear us. I'll ask Dave before we go to Frank, but Dave, you saw his last match versus Michael Todd, right? What are your thoughts about that? And where do you think Frank is the most dangerous? Frank's hand is ridiculous. I watched that match, you know, a couple of times, obviously, you know, I like to study matches and the guys I'm going to pull, but I watched it before I even knew I was going to pull Frank. And it was incredible. If it wasn't for...
Dave Chaffee: Michael, that absurd Kingsman, Frank would have beat him. He should have, could have, would have, but he got just that much. That move is so hard to beat sometimes. And I give Frank all the credit in the world. He's an awesome competitor, and that match could have easily went his way, just inches. It's a game of inches, and it was a fun match to watch.
Dave Chaffee: so you think uh the hand and the top role will be his game plan for you right it's we haven't seen him done doing anything else he does what he does best and that's top role right I think so I mean I don't blame him his hand is ridiculous I watched him against Michael and then Matt mask I've seen you know a couple years ago against Georgie I watched he took his hand and he's probably was giving up probably 100 pounds to him I want to say and it's
Dave Chaffee: Yeah, it's going to be a challenge trying to get through that hand. I'd have to figure something out. You know, we'll see. But yeah, it's definitely I'm going to assume that's his game plan. And I mean, if he's smart, that's what he said he was a fan. Frank, did we guess correctly? Or are we going to see a big surprise from you? You're going to try something else. Artem you going to stick to your guns and trying to top roll Dave Chaffee? No, no, no, no surprise. I have my shot, my top roll, so it's not...
Frank Lamparell: No, no. I'm not a multi-shooter. I'm very happy to shoot with Dave because he's a legend. He doesn't remember, but I've already shot with Dave in Lars Vegas on the left. He had won the World Cup on the right and then on the left we shot him in the 110kg category, if I'm not mistaken.
Martino (Translator): so thank you saying that he doesn't have a different option he is known for his top role and that's what he will do and that Dave might not remember but they already pulled once in Lars Vegas and on the left I remember left-handed I remember he crushed me I don't I don't forget them 2010 I remember
Dave Chaffee: he said that he wasn't so sure that he won but now he seemed to confirm it so you you both were way way younger oh yeah that was a few about 2010 was probably 14 14 years ago i remember i was left-handed left-handed at uh at worlds yeah i wasn't born then
Dave Chaffee: I wasn't born at that time. He said that you were like invincible on the right arm and he remembers that you won the world or something like that and the match was on left hand. Yes, exactly. He crushed me. I remember he crushed me left hand and I was like, okay, I know this guy now. I remember. I certainly don't forget matches like that. Of course, he top rolled me with my hand like I kind of expected.
Host: so so what is the you know this is not this is heavyweights right how much you weigh now Dave that way like I always do 275 270 275 pounds 277 fluctuates okay and uh Frank what's your weight for this one 115.
Frank Lamparell: Okay, so you're going to be about 20 pounds heavier. He's saying that he tried to gain a bit of weight, but he works on a ship and it's all metal and the temperature is 62 Celsius.
Martino (Translator): so it's something like 110 fahrenheit i guess something like that and he said that he's cooking and he really can't hold weight he can't eat he can't do anything that that's good news for me he doesn't need any more help and he then he then he needs i'm very happy for that no more no no advantages yeah i think the match will be crazy um
Host: Frank, how was your preparation for this? How much time did you... How long did you know you're going to pull Dave Chaffee? How much work have you put in for this match and what it means to you? Specifically, no.
Frank Lamparell: I continued to train the same way I did with Michael. I continued to train the same way I did with Michael Todd and I hope it works. As a strength and as a strength, I hope it remains the same. Because when I trained with Michael Todd, I had an excellent strength, at least as far as I know, even if it wasn't enough.
Martino (Translator): He said that he's not doing anything specific for Alex. He just keeps training like he did for Michael Todd. And he said that that workout gave him pretty good endurance and he was pretty satisfied of his endurance. In the end, it wasn't really enough, but for his standards, he said that it was pretty good. He felt really good. His strength also feels pretty good and he just keeps working the way that he started.
Host: I think you're in endurance versus Michael. If you can hang that long, it's pretty damn good. Right. But I think I think you need power like for Dave. Like, how do you see match versus Dave? You see it as easy. One of you wins easy or it's hard or.
Frank Lamparell: He said it was going to be an easy win. No, I think it's going to be a great battle. It's going to be a great battle, and I hope so, because it would be nice if it was a good match. I've seen Dave's matches and I know he's got a lot of stamina,
Martino (Translator): so he's saying that he really hopes for a war and he's pretty sure that it will be a war because dave is not someone that will lose like nothing and he saw dave's matches and dave's as amazing like stopping power in
Martino (Translator): defensive position also arm break position so he's pretty sure that it's going to be a war and it it won't be so easy to just like do the final the final part and that Dave has a really good press now so yeah he can switch plants and endurance he will need that
Dave Chaffee: Dave, do you see that Frank gets this from you, or you feel so confident you're just going to go, it's all going to be A-side, no B-side action? I wish I was 100% confident it was going to be a quick match, but I think it's going to be a war also, and I've definitely been training some things where I'm working like this, because I have a feeling he might take my hand. So I've been working in different positions, trying to do some side without my hand, in preparation for the chance that he
Dave Chaffee: you know, he very well might take my hand and I may end up in that position. So that's pretty much what I've been doing. I agree with him. I think it's going to be a war. I think this will be a really fun match. It's going to be a good one.
Host: I think with Frank now we're expecting it to be very like his top role ability is like highest level possible in my opinion. Right. And there's like, but your power level is legendary. So I think it will all will come down who will do their move a little bit better. Right. Did you work more endurance or power for this one, David? I work, I work both. I always work on my power, but I, you know, I try to do,
Dave Chaffee: do some more endurance stuff because I know, like I said, it's probably going to end up stopped. He's a good chance he's going to take my hand. I'm going to end up in certain positions, you know, working out, you know, defensively. Like I said, I'm hoping to be awesome if the matches are quick because, you know, that's, you know, that's good for me, but because I'm sure his endurance is probably just a little bit better than mine after, especially after watching him against Michael. So,
Host: Yeah, like I said, I train both. I train power, I train endurance. Nine days from now, we're going to find out. It's going to be fun. Frank right now is on that role that he has to... He's pulling all the North Aymeric, right? It was Matt Mask, it's Michael Todd, now it's you. Eventually, it's Devil Larratt or Odell Larratt, right? So, how do you feel about getting these matches? Because this is some of the dream matches that everyone would want to pull. It's really tough.
Frank Lamparell: Well, I think these are possibilities that those who play with an iron arm hope to have once in their life. I am super happy to have had these three possibilities against the champions and that they still have three very different shots. Dave, in my opinion, is currently one of the strongest in the world as a top-roll and therefore it is also a way to put myself
Frank Lamparell: I'm very happy. I don't know how it will go, but I'm very happy.
Martino (Translator): first of all i want to ask there is a bit of noise here can you can you hear us it's not a problem so frank say that first of all is very happy because it is a great opportunity and also pulling all this legend is amazing you you really can't complain after pulling matt mask michael todd david
Martino (Translator): He said that David Chaffee for him will be a huge test because Dave is a powerhouse and he still is one of the top athletes in the world. So for him, it is also a way to go to his level. So he will know as well where his place in the world is. So he's really grateful for this opportunity and he can't really complain because it is a legend. So it's really, really happy about it. Now, just everyone is left.
Host: Dave, you've been having your ups and downs, ups and downs. Do you feel like this is a little bit of coming back match to figure out how do you feel and then maybe go next level? Everyone knows Frank is good, but right now, one of you is fighting for some ranking spots, in my opinion, like who goes a little higher. So how important is this? I think it's important for both of us. Like you said, I've had my ups and downs recently, the last couple of years.
Dave Chaffee: Um, and knocked out of the, you know, the top rankings, you know, first time in quite a while. So it's very, it's very, very important to me to, uh, you know, to try to go out and show, I still have it basically. And I want to thank Frank for accepting his match, you know, he's given up, you know, 20, 25 pounds. So I know that's a challenge given up weight like that. And, you know, like I said, I'd like to thank him and I think it's going to be a really, really good match. Um, and it.
Dave Chaffee: It's like I said, it's important for him too. Like if he gets the win on me, then that's going to shoot him up right there. So it's going to be, we're both taking this match very seriously. I know that.
Host: is uh Frank maybe he has a response to this like uh is it same for him because uh it will like even though Frank is kind of aiming for 115 but being successful on super heavyweights right it kind of puts you in better position 115 especially if you weigh 116. then see
Frank Lamparell: 15 kg is enough, but for example with Michael, he did the challenge with me for 115 kg, but the day after he weighed himself he was already at 122-123 kg, so little changes. Let's say that I have the idea that when one accepts
Frank Lamparell: and then you put yourself in the game, you can't say, but the other one weighed more. When one accepts, he accepts. It depends on another category, but if you win even at 115, it gives you more prestige.
Frank Lamparell: Well, I always think he's one of the best. Evgeny if he's not in the rankings, he's always one of the best in the Super Heavyweight division. So for me, even if I had to put him in trouble and win just one fight, it would be very important. So he's saying that Dave of course weights more than him, but at the same time, when he had this match with Michael Todd,
Martino (Translator): uh the match was at 115 and it was 115. but Michael told the day of the match was 122 123 so for him is not really a problem to pull with someone heavier than him and also he said that once you accept the match there is no excuses like oh you waste more than me you accept you accepted the match so now it's it's done you you can't complain and of course David is from another category
Martino (Translator): But he said that both for the 115 category, but also for himself, he still thinks that Dave is one of the top athletes, maybe one of the strongest with raw power. So if already he's able to put a stop on Dave, win a round, he will feel like a win for himself because he's proving to himself as well that he deserves the spot. So, of course, he's not in the 115 category,
Martino (Translator): category so it's not directly correlated to his rank in that category but he feels that he has a lot to gain if he wins uh Frank when was the last time you traveled so far as USA to pull 2010 Lars Vegas
Martino (Translator): I did Canada 2008, 2010 Lars Vegas and 2012 Brazil. Canada 2008, Lars Vegas I guess Dave 2010 and Brazil 2012.
Host: okay gotcha gotcha uh Dave it's um you've been pulling for years in North Aymeric everywhere like you you were now every every North Aymeric is traveling because there's finally this opportunity to do these matches right and bring in West and West together but you've been one of the guys that's been traveling forever and
Dave Chaffee: how does it feel that finally on a home soil there's going to be such a big event because there hasn't been in a very very long time right something as big as this it's it's nice it's pretty awesome um it's been quite a while you know for for me and most anybody to get a big match against you know european over on you know north american soil because we've done all the
Dave Chaffee: West versus West, you know, they're all been in Istanbul and the, um, king of the tables and Dubai, you know, those have been the main, the main things the last, you know, two, three years, basically. So to get, to get a, uh, event over here in North Aymeric, uh, it's, it's pretty awesome. I made sure, you know, as soon as I found out, I, I asked Anken if I could, you know, be a part of this, this one, cuz it'd be nice to pull on home soil. Uh, cuz it's been quite a while to, you know, to have the chance to do that. And he was like, yeah, absolutely. A hundred percent.
Dave Chaffee: So I was pretty excited. Then he got me, you know, Frank as an opponent, which I was really excited after watching his last couple of matches. So, yeah, we're going to put on a show here on the home turf. And it means more, you know, because I'm here at home. And, of course, I don't want to lose here, you know, in North Aymeric. You know, of course, every match means, you know, a lot to me. But, you know, to win the first one over here would be pretty cool.
Host: now that's uh like I even feel like how North Aymeric are excited for this event right here I'm here in Europe and I can still feel it from the comments from everything and like people are talking about this event which is which is awesome and I think uh like you said if you have an opportunity to pull there and all of us do it's I think it's uh it's going to be historic event and most likely there's going to be more to come from this one
Host: And I'm really, really excited for your both of your match, because I think you have that power. But Frank's top role is so unpredictable and he's so it kind of opens a lot of possibilities, a lot of doors for this match. But we will see.
Host: not gonna hold a lot of your time here i know you guys are busy but uh we're gonna spend at least 15 more minutes maybe a little more let's talk about some of the other matches because i know you have some insight pulling at least one of the pairs and it's camille versus michael todd and i think frank has pulled both of them and i think you have pulled both of them right
Host: Yeah, I pulled them both, yeah. I go numerous times. This is at super heavyweights, right? And Michael is coming back to this weight category. Kamil with leftists has been super successful. With right, not so much, but still. How do you see that match? And do you see it as easy match? Do you see it something similar as Michael versus Jerry? So you could go...
Dave Chaffee: I'm not sure. Could go either way. It could go the Michael versus Jerry style where Michael gets into his Kings move and Camille gets in that press and he just sits there and sits there and sits there and waits on him. Or I could also see Michael pressing right over, right over Camille, making it quick. So I don't know. It's going to be interesting to see. It's one of them with one of the matches we're going to have to just have to wait and see. My prediction is, is Michael's going to win. I love Camille. He's funny.
Dave Chaffee: great guy. I got to hang out with him a little bit when he came over here last August. He's a real funny dude. But I think Michael, with his experience, has the advantage in this one. Frank, your thoughts? Again, you have pulled both, right? What are your thoughts? I think that Camille has more strength. But Michael Todd...
Frank Lamparell: at that speed and that way of making you tired, maybe you could give him the first shot, but then, in my opinion, Michael Todd could be better. I'm a friend of both, I shot with both and let's say I shot with Michael Todd 15 years ago and this year.
Frank Lamparell: On the other hand, with Kamil, I pulled two years ago, but I had just returned from two years of stop, so I wasn't as strong as I am now. However, he has a very particular press. And in my opinion,
Frank Lamparell: There is a system to block him. And if Michael understood it, I think Michael could win. But it's all to be seen. It will be beautiful to see, for sure. Did you see him try to press him before Michael? Yes, for sure. If we go to watch the match with Matyushenko, it was very fast. If Michael manages to be so fast to close it right away, he could win it right away. So he made three comparisons. And the first one is that, of course, he could win it.
Martino (Translator): of course he pulled with both of them but with Michael he pulled like right now with Camille he pulled two years ago and it was like one of his first competition after a long break so it is that he was stronger when he faced Michael so
Martino (Translator): i think that he thinks that michael is in good shape camille might be stronger but at the same time michael is fast and has a lot of endurance so he might lose the first round but then camille might get tired and at the same time michael showed great uh counter press against lars and even showed us that matushenko that you can really uh
Martino (Translator): prevent Camille from entering the press, but being faster. So if Michael applies what he applied against Lars versus Camille, Camille might not even be able to enter the press. And he said that Michael is really, really fast for his initial hit. Sorry, Ray, you are... Both of you are kind of... He said that Michael got really quicker during last year's.
Host: yeah it's like this is one of those 50 50 that uh i really don't know right it's so it's so hard to understand where the match is going like it has the writings like it's a press versus open top roll but mike right now has so much up like mike could press him like we saw him press lars it was very unexpected like i expected it to be big war and it wasn't um i want to get again your thoughts about alex will pull jerry
Dave Chaffee: Alex Kurdecha, Jerry, David, let's go. I pulled both of those guys. I haven't pulled Jerry in, I think I want to say, six, seven, eight years. I pulled Alex a couple of years ago. I think if Alex can get where he needs to be, he'll win this match. If he's watched video on Hermes and different people on how to beat that move, he's strong enough to get there.
Dave Chaffee: he can get over over over the top impress him possibly or something else maybe a different grip um i think alex alex will be the favorite in this one i think alex will take it um jerry strong though if jerry can get where he needs to be and alex can't pin him he will he will definitely wear alex out and jerry can definitely win this match too but i'm i'm going with alex in this one
Frank Lamparell: What does Frank think? I think you have pulled Kordec, right? You have pulled Kordec before, or no? Frank. Did you pull with Alex? With Kordec? No, never. It was Manuel Battaglia. Manuel Battaglia. No, I've never pulled with Alex. Tifo for him. In my opinion, he's much stronger than a couple of years ago, Alex. I think he could... He's struggling, but he could beat Alex.
Martino (Translator): He said that he choose for Alex. In his opinion, Alex really did improve those last years. And he think that in a gruesome war, but Alex in the end can pull it off. David, where's your Italian? Can you speak any Italian? Dave.
Frank Lamparell: You see, Frank, you always say ciao. You say that it will be a problem because he's alone there, so he will not have anyone cheering for him. You will have Ray. I'm almost Italian, come on, my friend.
Host: plus i thought like i asked you did you and you said battaglia full condition i thought that if one italian pulls someone then everyone has pulled them wasn't that how it works out
Host: Yeah, man. We have John Brzenk. This is the main event versus Leonidas Arkona. You saw Leonidas versus Schoolboy. It was very impressive, very unexpected win. With John, it's again, you never know what kind of John will show up. It could be Destroyer of the World John. How do you feel about that match? Is Leonidas, like many people think, favorite in this one? Well, like I said, I think you called it there, which John's going to show up, the world beater John.
Dave Chaffee: Or, you know, that John is not in the greatest of shape. But it's John either way. So you've got to go with John. I think Leonidas is an up-and-comer. I think he's going to be really – I mean, he is good. I think he's going to be really, really good. He sticks with it. But right now, the experience, I'm going with John after. Yeah. Frank? Here you go, John, 100%. He's saying 100%, John.
Martino (Translator): It's getting worried because you finally showed your forearm and it's looking too big. Devon't get me fooled because look at this, look at this. His forearm is not more. I was trying to hide it the best I could. Yeah, like a bodybuilder is wearing a hoodie.
Dave Chaffee: Yeah, exactly. You did it on purpose. We also have one very big, I think two big rematches. Let's talk about those. Todd versus Prudnik. That's the match I'm really looking forward to seeing the most right there. Todd and Prudnik. I know Todd wants to beat him really bad after the last time they pulled. Todd is...
Dave Chaffee: coming in really strong. Burdick didn't look, you know, himself, I don't think, the last time. So I think Todd is going to come in prepared 100%, and I'm going to go with Todd in this one. I think he's going to win the rematch. Frank? In my opinion, in the last months, in the last period,
Martino (Translator): He said that in his opinion, Prudnik doesn't look 100%, doesn't look himself. He doesn't know if it is for health problems or maybe injuries. But in his opinion, Todd Hutchings will win. And I want to point out that both of them,
Martino (Translator): David predicted Alex to win and now he's predicting Aymeric to win. So there is no bias between them. No, I can see it.
Host: And the other big rematch, we have Rustam pulling with Paul Linn. So if you don't remember, I'm going to remind everyone, first time they pulled was for the title. Rustam was up 2-0, and then he tore his pec muscle in round number three. First two rounds, I think Paul tried to initiate more of a back pressure, more top roll. And then round three, when it was the last round, he just went inside and...
Host: uh you know broke um then just just to you know kind of make a context rustam pulled when he returned pulled iraqli and it ended up three two right and we have seen the wave that iraqli has been on so do you think rustam can be on is still as dangerous as he ever was dave if he if he comes back to where he was i remember you know five six seven eight years ago when he was you know
Dave Chaffee: whatever, 60 pounds, 70 pounds lighter than some of the heavyweights in North Aymeric. And, and he would probably have beaten most of the North Aymeric back then. So if he can get to where he was, you know, at that time or anywhere near, he is very dangerous. I mean, he's one of the best, honestly, one of the best ever to do it. I mean, he's a machine, like all the accolades you have over the years, the world titles, um,
Dave Chaffee: So, yeah, if that guy shows up, Paul's in trouble. But I know Paul. Paul's going to be ready. And I have to go with Paul. Dave to. Lars time, Paul versus Lachlan, were you kind of shocked or did you expect exactly that to happen? I wasn't too shocked. I know Paul doesn't surprise me. I know how strong he is, how fast and good he is.
Dave Chaffee: So most of the stuff he does, he, you know, you would, if he didn't know him, he would surprise you, but I know how good he is and he doesn't surprise me anymore. Okay. So no more surprises, Paul, you you're done all your surprises. Yeah. You're like underdog story is over, right? Uh, Frank. Bye. Um, you can also, um, uh,
Frank Lamparell: If he gets back in shape, or if he gets picked up by Strap or Petorale, he has no problem winning. I like both of them, especially Ollin. I met him at West-West and he's a charismatic character. It's nice to see how he pulls. It's going to be a nice match. I'm a Bavarian fan.
Martino (Translator): He said that he's a long time knower of how strong, how good Rustam Babaiev is. And like Devon said, if Rustam shows up with his chest healed up or in a good shape, he thinks that Rustam will win. At the same time, Pauline is a very strong athlete. He likes the way that Paul pulls. He said that Paul has a lot of charisma, is a very nice guy. But of course, he's rooting for old legend Rustam Babaiev. And he thinks that if Rustam shows up in good shape, he will win.
Host: Before we finish, this will be the last question I'm going to ask you. It's Travis versus Corey West. Dave, you must know those guys. Dave you heard about Travis Bajan before?
Host: never heard of him could you could you explain to me who he is uh he's like a commentator right now uh i thought i'd see him announcing somewhere it doesn't ring a bell so yes yes yes yes i've pulled travis numerous times over the years right-handed left-handed we've had some rivalries some great matches hey listen i watched game of thrones religiously and that first season when you guys did like left and right right left and right left and right at the end
Dave Chaffee: that was the crazy this i was watching i was like when does this get in and it was still taking half of the episode yeah that was a good time but uh i i don't know if travis is where where he used to be where he can be um you know i seen him against uh with derek smith that was left-handed match he beat him pretty easy i kind of i kind of figured derek's better right and then i kind of i kind of thought travis
Dave Chaffee: you know, bit off a little more than he can chew right away in his last match against Sergey. Sergey's really, really good right-handed. So we're going to see, kind of see where Travis is right now because Corey, I know Corey West, but I think, I think Corey's left might've been hurt a little bit too. He tore his pec a while back. Maybe it was right. I can't remember, but he injured something. But if Corey, if Corey's healthy, I know he wants this, this match really bad. I think, I think Corey's going to win. But if Travis can, can, you know,
Dave Chaffee: come in anywhere near like he used to be. He's very tricky. He can get grips and knows what to do in the straps. He could just, it could be a very, very interesting match. That's another, it's another match we're really looking forward to actually. This one and Todd Hutchings and Pruitt are the two I'm looking forward to the most. Yeah. Frank? Hello there.
Frank Lamparell: Travis is less unstable than a few years ago, so you can still make a match now. Once, in my opinion, it was impossible to pull with him because I remember in Manchester when he did the challenge with Semenenko, it was almost a fight. In my opinion, Travis wins.
Frank Lamparell: I see him, it seems to me that he has returned, especially with the left, that he has the grit to win.
Martino (Translator): he said that now that Travis finally seems at least a little bit calmer you can actually have a match with him and not a fight because he was in Manchester and he remembers Travis and Semarenko and he said that that wasn't a match it was almost abroad and now Travis seems at least like to understand the concept of a match and the rules and he thinks that
Martino (Translator): Travis might win this because he seems very motivated and he might not already 100% back, but he thinks that Travis really wants to come back and he thinks that he will beat Corey.
Martino (Translator): He said that he really wants to see Matt Mask and Travis fight together because they are both super crazy and he would love to see what comes out of that match. He said that it would be like with popcorns. He really wants to see that match.
Host: I like your best comment was like, at least now he understands the concept of the rules.
Host: He said that it was really something back in the days. I think it is. If Travis wins this one, it's all going to come back because then he will have the confidence to back everything up he's saying. He was saying crazy things because he could back it up. I'm really interested in this one. Guys, I'm not going to take any more of your time. Maybe some last messages between each other. Dave, you want to say something to Frank? Yeah, I just want to
Dave Chaffee: Thank Frank for nothing nice. I'm a nice guy. I'm not going to say anything to me about Frank's a really nice guy too. I can tell. So there's no, there's no bad blood here. I'm looking forward to a great match. I'm really, really excited about this. I want to thank him for accepting this match. I know going in, he's given up a little weight and may the best man win. And I'll see you in Florida.
Frank Lamparell: I have to thank him because he is a legend in this sport. I am emerging from old age and I am very happy to do this challenge with him. As he says, he wins the best and above all I like it because he has always had a way of pulling
Frank Lamparell: First of all he said that Dave must be a thief because he robbed him of those words that he wanted to say the exact same thing.
Martino (Translator): And secondly, that he's really happy for this match as well. And he should be the one thanking Dave because Dave is the legend. He said now he's getting more exposure, but he's old and it would have been better to gain this exposure when he was younger. And he said that he always liked Dave because Dave is someone that always pulled in a fair way without tricks, without trying to gain advantage. He was just like
Martino (Translator): pull force and let the best man win so he always like these things in the game and he's really happy to face someone and have a fair match and the best man will win you guys are in competition who's the nicest guy in armor sling for sure yeah it's the nicest guy battle you have to have in the same card them and matt musk and trev is pulling so the average will be yeah we need a balance
