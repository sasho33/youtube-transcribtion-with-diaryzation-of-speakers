Leonidas Arkona: Hello, hello, hello. Hello, Engen. Can you hear me? Yeah, yeah. How is everything? Good, good. Leonidas, how are you? How are you, sir? Hey, how are you, John? Doing good. Hi, guys. My pleasure to meet you both. Is it better like this or like this? Which way? Which way are we going, Engen? Artem we going this way?
Engin Terzi: I mean, this side way. Yeah. One second. Let me check the stream on YouTube because here I don't understand. So how is everything going? You guys doing well? Everything's well. I've got, uh,
John Brzenk: grandkids down here for the last four or five days um you know swim in and enjoying the arizona heat so i've been um trying to keep up with them but yes other than just being super hot out here it's everything's good how's the weather over there
John Brzenk: It's been hot. This last few days have been, well, I don't know what the conversion is to Celsius, but it's about 115 degrees Fahrenheit. Yeah, so very hot, like a blow dryer hitting you in the face. Yeah, we got shade, we got a swimming pool, so it's doable. Not too bad. The rest of the year, we've got great weather here, so I...
Leonidas Arkona: know i accept the the hellish weather in june july and august for the the rest of the year now you're in germany um oh it's it's pretty hard right now um not much not much sleep because uh there is nothing that cools me down right now and i was looking for for something like how to say is it a um klima klima trying something you know what i'm i mean no um
John Brzenk: I mean, it's very hard right now. And probably humid, so you sweat a lot. Humidity's high? Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's the tough part. I mean, I don't mind the heat so much if it's dry, but if it starts getting, you know, like the West Coast here in the States, it gets humid, and then it's just unbearable. You've got to find air conditioning. Yeah, yeah.
Leonidas Arkona: But you know what? I can't say nothing against it because I like hot weather. It's for me much more enjoyable than when it's cold.
John Brzenk: um no bad words against the sun yeah yeah i don't know i'm with you i don't i much much rather fight the hot than fight the cold i do enjoy i do enjoy the recreational snowmobiling so i can't say i completely hate snow and cold i i do enjoy it a little bit but not not to not to have to travel in it and work in it every day that's that sucks yeah i saw that ever met each other
Leonidas Arkona: No, no, no. This first time. No, it's not the first time, John. You forgot it. Really? Okay. I think we met at West versus West. I don't know which was it. Like two years ago, you walked towards me and I said hi and you said hi to me. Okay. I didn't know who you were then, I guess. So we never were introduced, formally introduced. Yeah. I didn't even shake your hand because it was so fast. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: I was very sad about it because everybody's telling me, John got a huge hand. And so I didn't get the chance yet. Oh, shoot. Oh, OK. Well, sorry about that. I, you know, I just probably assume that you were just a big bodybuilder that walked past. Yeah. Which you are. Leonidas is the guy that many times came to West vs. West, probably a few times when you were competing. How many times did you see him, Leonidas, when you came to West vs. West to watch?
Leonidas Arkona: i think two times three times no no two times two times or something two times two times oh okay okay okay do you remember which matches were i think maybe petrenko match east west five yes it was that one and uh which was the other one i don't really remember it um no i think it was the the only time that i saw you john when you had the match versus versus petrenko
Leonidas Arkona: I like Petrenko. Okay. I saw some footage of you. I guess you were in the States here briefly. You were pulling with the California guys. Would you have some other business out in California? I was. I'm back here in Germany right now. Yeah, actually, I was there just to enjoy the weather, to enjoy California a little bit and to work there. I was staying for one month. It was a great time. Okay.
John Brzenk: But you know that right now I'm back and actually the weather condition is tougher here in Germany than in California. Yeah, especially if you're close to the coast. The water makes it quite pleasant. Actually, LA right now is killing us as far as the weather goes. I mean, it's in the 70s and 80s and quite pleasant actually.
Leonidas Arkona: yeah listen I I cannot let you guys to have this friendly conversation we're going to talk about weather and I mean it's very tough it's very hard because you got two of the nicest guys before before our little chat coming on the podcast I'm thinking to myself I don't even know what to say I mean I
Engin Terzi: I don't know if I can play the bad guy and say, oh, I'm just going to rip your arm off. You better beware. You don't need to play the bad guy, but you are most respected guy in the community and you are the coach. So you are respected as a person. You are respected as an athlete. It is very, very hard to have aggressive feelings about you if somebody is pulling against you. But this guy, so I need to stir the pot, right? Okay, let me start.
Engin Terzi: Start staring. This guy wanted to pull someone for the rankings. So whenever I offer him Rob Vision, he said, Engin, I want to pull someone in my category, so I don't want any kind of matches that doesn't really affect the rankings. Unless I offer you. So the guy really wants to beat you. So sorry. You be careful. Devon't be deceived by his
John Brzenk: you know you know this yeah no no i i i've i've taken notice and i've seen how he's pulled the last three or four times and um now i uh i appreciate that he is uh he is a formidable opponent and it will be very uh quite a challenge for me to say the least um yeah no impressive uh victories over both larry and um schoolboy that's uh
Engin Terzi: those I mean I don't know if I could beat right now he's uh he's uh he's definitely top tier yeah so it'll be it'll be exciting I'm looking forward to it so sorry Leonidas I I had to take action he was getting too friendly too sweet so as an organizer uh yeah
Engin Terzi: Schoolboy for sure has more experience than Leonidas. He has been pulling from his childhood, but Leonidas is very, very strong. So I think that, yeah, if you would pull schoolboy, you would pull someone more experienced. But I mean, right now you will be pulling someone maybe less, has less experience than schoolboy, but for sure stronger. Right.
John Brzenk: Right, right, right. I think, yeah, so schoolboy for me would be whether or not I can control the hand. I don't think he possesses quite the side pressure that Leonidas does. So I think for me, knowing my strengths and weaknesses right now, I think Leonidas is going to be probably a bigger challenge for me just as far as the side pressure. I'm going to take every advantage I can get. I think I'm going to be dominant in so many respects, but it might not be enough to finish it.
John Brzenk: it'll be fun. I, you know, you know, everybody knows my endurance as, uh, I'm approaching 60 is, is gone down the toilet. So, um, I have to have a, uh, quite a different mindset of not, not going into the match, trying to hang on and outlast my opponent, which I've, I've basically done the last four or five matches, um, just because I can't be super aggressive. So, but yeah, so my mindset has got to completely change for this match and, and, uh,
John Brzenk: go in and try to be aggressive and you know if it gets stuck anywhere i'm gonna be i'm gonna be asking for oxygen i don't think it is more of his side pressure but to me it was more of his back pressure
John Brzenk: Yeah, yeah, yeah. But that back pressure puts a heavy load on the side pressure. It's really difficult to go sideways when you're being pulled out like that. And I've got some experience pulling Brandon Allen and some really strong guys that have really good biceps. I know what that feels like. So I kind of think I know the direction I need to do. So we'll see if I can pull it off or not.
Engin Terzi: And Leonidas, how is your shape compared to the schoolboy match? I will tell you something. You surprised all of us. I had to remain natural, but I thought I was going to beat you. And then you really surprised me. I know that. I know that everybody was kind of surprised. And what I want to say about the match against schoolboy back then is one thing that I...
Leonidas Arkona: Look, I was kind of sad after the school image. First of all, he was freaking strong. He was just as strong as I expected, expected him to be. But it was kind of sad when the match was over because
Leonidas Arkona: was just a war the moment when i was warmed up and he was totally finished and i i had such a long preparation for the match against scuba i was really working hard for this match and that was it was already over and he said the press conference and all the time before he wants to pull me seven rounds and afterwards i was thinking yeah why not we can we can do 10 rounds if he wants right so
Leonidas Arkona: um i think schoolboy was a big challenge for me he really was so the like you saw the the result was uh three two and john of course is a number way up higher than schoolboy and that's why
Leonidas Arkona: why i wanted to test my my strength and my all of my this this tiny experience that i got right now against john because this is going to be of course it's going to be tough very tough challenge and i really it's it's hard for me it's very hard for me to to uh
Leonidas Arkona: see the match against you john because i really don't know everybody's talking about his his uh his um his wrist and his his big hand and the hand control and i think this is going to be the biggest weapon against me but i think i got i got something in the tank yeah yeah i was working hard with that with a training partner and uh
John Brzenk: Yeah. I don't want to lay out, you know, show you my hand, but my strengths right now are kind of your strengths, but I, and I definitely don't want to go there. I don't want to go post for post high, high knuckles, you know, hammer curl the hammer curl, because I think I would possibly lose that battle on the, on the flip side of that. If I try to commit to try to control you down a little bit,
John Brzenk: I haven't really been pulling very well that way. I know in my head that's the direction I need to control your hand to drive it down so it's not straight up and down.
John Brzenk: But I'm a little worried and scared because that hasn't been my strengths for a few years now. But I think I'm going to actually, I'll even tell you exactly what I'm going to do. I'm going to try that probably the first match. And if that's not successful, then we're going to go post for post. I have a bad feeling I'm going to lose the endurance game in that respect.
Engin Terzi: i'll give it as much hell as i can and try to get as much advantages as i can on you so leverage advantage so but anyway and what do you think please i mean i was just thinking uh i if i i wouldn't go neither way that john described i i wouldn't go back pressure to back pressure i i believe you are stronger and i wouldn't go
Engin Terzi: dominated inside either because your arm is also very strong if I were John I wouldn't load and I would make sure that it is reference grip or something so that you cannot fully apply apply the back pressure so I would just a little bit cup and then pronation just to outside you keep your wrist you know flat and then and then press you that way the way that John pull against Alex boy what
John Brzenk: I think is the way to, yeah, your thumb. Yeah, I don't think that's going to work just because I think he possesses a lot more straight up and down Travis style back pressure with knuckles high. So I'm going to have to commit with a little bit of cup or a lot of cup to be quite honest. It depends on how the match starts. If he's fully loading, then that's very hard. But if it's a referee's grip, he's not really fully loading,
John Brzenk: then you have time before he reaches his peak back pressure, you will have that application. I've been preparing mentally to hopefully not fall into the uncertainty of just slipping and going right to the straps. I'm going to try to control the match without the straps for at least one round. We'll see how that goes. I haven't committed to doing that in quite a while.
Leonidas Arkona: see how that works out i really i knew that this is going to be uh the plan the the plan game for for john because i was thinking about it i was i was talking with my coach about it so uh i think i'm kind of prepared for that because i was working a lot of wrist strength a lot of finger strength so
John Brzenk: This is going to be interesting. Very interesting. And most people that don't know, I mean, don't have the experience of arm wrestling, someone that has your build, most people would say to me, you're crazy. Devon't hook that guy. Devon't hook that guy. But from my personal experience, arm wrestling, strong men like in Australia and even Brandon Allen, many, many strong men, they seem to be tougher for me
John Brzenk: when I allow them to keep their hand this way. I don't know if their bicep is stronger when their hand is like this. When I can turn it under, even though I'm not great in a hook, you would think that would be a silly way to go for strong guys in the hook, but the stability isn't, in my experience with past guys, isn't there as far as the sideways motion if I can run it in wrist to wrist.
John Brzenk: We'll see. I mean, the nice thing is that we get three rounds to make mistakes, right? John, when you say that copying, but you are still planning to roll? To roll? No, I think any pressure on the hand-to-hand is going to be a dangerous situation that he'll be strong enough to possibly stonewall me or we slip. So I think I'm going to have to be really committed to try to really almost hook and then, you know,
John Brzenk: do a lot of a lot of cupping more than his bicep is very strong so yeah yeah yeah controlling the back pressure this would be a better idea but I don't know well yeah not not even top rolling it but just even having the ability to go do a Todd Hutchings just have that side pressure to to you know bring him across the table but
John Brzenk: um like i said that's it's been my weak area i've been uh you know five months now not arm wrestling so the shoulder i did all the rehab things for the shoulder but uh as soon as i started arm wrestling again it's it's it's questionable again so um i'm uh to be honest i think i'm done arm wrestling uh now until our match i'm gonna just do hand and wrist and try to you know be
John Brzenk: be healthier going into it than uh than just in good arm wrestling shape the question the question do you think that your shape is better same or more certain than when you pull alexey voyota um i think it's the same i don't think i'm i mean i'm another six months a year older but um yeah it's hard to say i mean for me it's just
John Brzenk: mentally preparing and and not hurting if i have a little aches and pains i don't think the strength thing matters as much as going in well rested and and healed and then and then mentally preparing myself not to not to slow down because i feel this like achiness or the pain like so um it's it's gonna be more about my mental preparation and confidence going in if i feel like i'm healed and like
John Brzenk: All right, then I can be, I think, a lot more effective. So being in great shape and being a little sore, I think, is worse than being out of shape and being healthy for me at this point in my life. Yeah, let's see. Leonidas?
Leonidas Arkona: i mean i was i was i was thinking about something uh that you said earlier john because um you are thinking about and you you were also thinking about how john is going to start the match and i was thinking about it also because when when you one want to go i mean you are very strong in this position and very interesting fact is that i'm very strong in the
Leonidas Arkona: exact opposite position when he got me there so this is actually this is actually the the part where i don't want him to to get me i don't want to be there this time because this is some some some part i was working out
Leonidas Arkona: with um a few guys a lot of times in the in the prep right now but you know what i'm done training too so i'm doing a pause until until match day because right now everything is sore a lot of pain and uh the work is done yet yeah yeah yeah i feel like i mean i'm gonna still do the hand and wrist i do my little rolling you know rolling thunder things and uh
John Brzenk: Um, I, you know, I'll keep the blood going. Yeah, I need, I need to actually start going for morning walks to get my cardio up to be quite honest. I mean, that's, that's, that's the thing that kind of is, is hurt me more than anything as I've gotten older. I don't know if it's just because I've gotten weaker and I can't, uh,
John Brzenk: allow myself to rest on my my frame like i used to and now i'm i'm actually quivering and and straining the whole time to maintain a decent position so uh but uh yeah it probably wouldn't hurt if i get on a bicycle here for the next couple weeks not that not that that would help it's i think it's too close but i'm such a lazy lazy old guy i i just don't like doing the cardio i don't know how you are about it but um yeah so yeah though i'm gonna need go ahead
Engin Terzi: Leonidas, you said that you are also done with training. Was it your twin brother that in Istanbul was training until the day of competition? Or was it you? Who do you mean? Once again, sorry, Engin. You said that you also are done with training. I'm just saying, was it your twin brother in Istanbul that trained until the day before the competition?
Leonidas Arkona: Actually, I don't know who started saying this because I was in the gym in Istanbul and I did some movements, but I wasn't working out at all because, I mean, it's so funny for me.
Leonidas Arkona: Actually, I just like the atmosphere of being in the gym and moving some weights. It's not like I was working out the day before the match against Schoolboy. I was kind of like being there and trying to get my head off the match and just moving some very light weights. And that was actually it. And you know what? I will do the same when I have the Supermatch against John because I need to get my head free then.
Leonidas Arkona: so you are saying that you are basically stop training for arm wrestling specifically yes yeah yeah yeah i'm working on it every day but no no heavy arm wrestling sessions um
John Brzenk: I'm done with that. That's quite the difference. Moving weight, if I was a weightlifter, is not nearly as strenuous and taxing on the tendons and the overall health of being effective arm wrestler days or weeks before arm wrestling. It's known that when people ask me, how long do you rest? I've always gone at least two weeks of heavy arm wrestling sessions before going into a big match. If I don't, my arm wrestling definitely
John Brzenk: definitely suffers a little bit so um but yeah um even a month i think it's i mean it's it's better to lean on the side of being healthy than it is getting that little bit of extra being in shape especially if you're lifting and getting the keeping the blood flow going
John Brzenk: It's more about structure and frame than it is actually muscle ability. So people would argue with me like, okay, well, if I stop training the lifting weights three or four days, I feel like I'm going downhill. But yeah, well, that's because you're using muscles to move a weight. It's not the strain and the frame that you need to have for an arm wrestling match. Yeah. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: There is nobody that can lecture all community other than John.
Engin Terzi: whatever john says he knows what he's talking about well it's just right for me i mean i'm not saying it's right for everybody about the table time and recovery and everything nobody is more knowledgeable than you are for sure unknown person nickname for leonidas hercules do you all agree the guy is a super chef he i i missed what he said
Engin Terzi: The guy thinks that, you know, we should have a nickname for Leonidas. Oh, Leonidas. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Well, doesn't Neil Pickup officially give everybody their nickname? Yeah. 90% of the community, they get their nickname from. Yeah, the only nickname that doesn't really like your name, John Brzee, is too strong to
Engin Terzi: to make the perfect storm to stay with it, you understand? Right, right. Yeah, even for Devon, no limits. Yeah, it really stays. But with you, John Brzenk, the nickname doesn't kind of get stuck, you know, with it, yeah. Right. Yeah. Logan Misiak, he says, one second, he says, question for John. What is the most difficult thing about Leonidas?
John Brzenk: his bicep strength or his side pressure and how are you going to counter his move like i said before i think his bicep strength um and more more specifically hammer strength taxing my attacking my hand is probably the most dangerous thing for me i'm hoping that his um
John Brzenk: Evgeny though his bicep pressure will be there, I'm not going to attack his bicep if it goes wrist to wrist. It will be the side pressure that I will attack. So hopefully his side pressure isn't as good as his. You can't combine bicep with side pressure. They're different. So I think the avenue for me is probably going to be, yes, I'm going to be on the bicep, but hopefully the side pressure isn't as good.
John Brzenk: All right, Jonathan, I got a question for you as well. What do you do if plan A is not going to work out? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, like I said, if plan A doesn't work, if the shoulder's not strong enough to take you out of position sideways or it starts popping and cracking, then I'm going to have to drop back and we're going to just battle it out back pressure to back pressure. And I mean,
John Brzenk: I think I'm going to, I probably, I'm going to lose that battle, but I hope that my, my frame is such that, um, I can get a better advantage in the hand, even in the straps. And, you know, hopefully I'm going at 20% while you're going at 80% to kind of equal out the endurance game. So, um, but yeah, that'll be my fallback. I'll end up pulling you kind of like I pulled Alex and just do the same thing you're doing. Justin hammer curl, keep, keep high on the hand and, uh,
John Brzenk: And try to outlast and hopefully we won't go into a king's move because I think angle stop having us if we end up dropping into. A king's move right again. No, no, no case moves. Desperation movies called. Right, if it is the about the shoulder I'm in table, it is open on top row.
John Brzenk: If it goes like this, it's a desperation move. You won't see that from me. I've actually tried it in the past and I'm not successful. I don't practice it at all. It's hard to be successful at something you don't practice. You might see that from me. You start shouting it. Mask sure your humerus is parallel. If it is down angle, it's foul.
Engin Terzi: this is okay this is well yeah anyway so let's talk a bit about the other matches as well uh jerry cadoret versus alex kurdecha people think that kurdecha is heavily favorite and usually john you think that when somebody is uh competing pronated face and then it is hard to beat jerry with that outside move how do you see this match
John Brzenk: I would agree with most people and saying that Kurdecha is probably stronger, but he has to arm wrestle smart. He can't just fall into what he believes is his strong move because he could possibly get himself in trouble. It's going to be a learning experience for Alex. Jerry is just unique in that respect that if you don't know how to pull him or pull him in the...
John Brzenk: with a brave move um wrist to wrist and kind of get knock him off center and he's able to jam in there and get behind his you know arm with all that that little tricep uh bench press type move he has it can be a long day I don't care how strong you are and uh you know I I feel that maybe
John Brzenk: Alex might fall into that trap. If he's aggressive and gets him off center and pulls him, you know, sideways a bit and doesn't allow him to get there, then Alex is going to crush him. But you've got to go in being brave and not be so scared of that massive frame that Jerry has and not let him get behind his arm. Dave you seen those matches that both Krasimir and Ongarba have beat?
Engin Terzi: Alex Prudnik with the deadlifts. But of course it was like five years ago, but those guys are nowhere close to Jerry's pressure. No, if Jerry gets to that position, there are very few people that I think, or if any, that can pull him out of that. I mean, I,
John Brzenk: we kind of all kid and laugh about, you know, Jerry against Levan, but I almost actually think he might be the one guy that could mess with Levan's, you know, style a little bit. I mean, he has such an advantage with his hand and, you know, where Jerry, if he just gets jammed in there, it might be enough to make a good match. John, Levan himself said that if he is not quick enough and if he is caught here,
Leonidas Arkona: He said that he would be in trouble. Big in trouble. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And you, Leonidas, have you seen it, Jerry or Kurdecha? Well, I haven't seen much of Jerry lately, but I have seen a lot from Alex Kurdecha on the last time. So what I would say is I think he's a bit favorite for me. I think, yeah, I think Alex might win this one.
Engin Terzi: he looks really strong he looks he looks so strong right now but yeah and like we said we haven't seen too much footage of jerry but we know we know he's capable yeah and let's go to the next one this one i only want the percentage i don't want any details uh john brzenk versus leonidas arcana
John Brzenk: I'm going in with a mindset of this is going to be 50-50. And I have to go in being very aggressive and not do what I've done in the past. And if I end up being the least bit tentative, I'm in trouble. But I'm going to go 50-50.
Leonidas Arkona: You know, it's really crazy that I'm here in the podcast with you guys having a super match against John Brzenk and he's the nicest guy ever saying 50-50 against me. I mean, I feel very honored. But yeah, what else should I say than 50-50? I'll be quite honest. I am going to be celebrated. You'll be seeing me hooting and hollering if I can pull off this victory again. So it's very going to be...
Engin Terzi: An exciting match for me. What are you thinking? What do I think about this match? Yes, sir. I mean, I know what you are capable of. I know your physical shape. And I saw it. And about John, this is just like I know from myself as well. You are as good as your health.
Engin Terzi: So I really do not know where exactly he is at. So I prefer to believe in what he says more than what I think, because he knows himself. You know, if he has less pain, if he's able to, like, he's like, compared to Alex, he's a year older.
Engin Terzi: doesn't really matter you know it i mean it matters but more most more matters uh what matters more is that he is helped if he has less pain he can perform better than last year if he has more pain i mean so this totally so if he says 50 50
John Brzenk: It is 50-50. And there's a lot of things that are seemingly out of my control. Like, I'll take for example, three weeks ago, practice, I was feeling great. All the guys which I practice with regularly, I was feeling dominant. I'm like, ah, you're going to kill him, you're going to kill him. I'm like, yeah, no, I feel really good. And the following week, which I normally do, four weeks rest, I come into practice and get my ass kicked by everybody. Okay, you know what it means? What the hell am I doing? You know what it means?
John Brzenk: do you know what it means it means that your body doesn't recover in one recover quick enough yeah yeah yeah but it's my normal but it's my normal it's my normal rest period which i should be consistent week to week to week but i'm just saying some some weekends i come in and you know and i just feel like and i just can't get it together and i'm like well i don't i don't i'm sorry guys i mean i have to be apologetic i'm like i'm sorry i'm a piece of today it's just wrong
Engin Terzi: That one week rest was okay 15 years ago, not anymore. Maybe it is good for one week, but the next week you are still carrying something from behind. Maybe second week is okay, but third week it says... I'm still trying to figure it out. It's always something new as you progress in the sport to get a little bit more advanced and a little bit older. It's a guessing game. I can say something that I don't believe
Engin Terzi: leonidas he says 50 50 because any other answer wouldn't look good you said 50 50 when john says 50 50 you cannot say 51 but you cannot say he's underdog either so but he cannot say in my belief in his head he's like 80 20 or something he believes yeah i'm i i should go in more more confident but um
John Brzenk: Like I said, I'll be giddy, happy, and celebrating if I can pull this off. I feel like lately I've just been kind of the underdog on every match you make me, set me up with, Egan. I mean, I think you are right. I think you are right. He's trying to play the nice card, the nice guy game. And when it comes to the table, I think I might see a different John Brzee. You're going to see it. 100%. Yeah, I know.
Engin Terzi: You were going to see it aggressive. I'm going to try to be aggressive. As aggressive as I can be. I just need that. Yeah. No, no, no. You misunderstood me. John is 50-50 is his honest opinion. You think you are 80-20 against John. You are the one who's playing nice. That's what I mean.
Leonidas Arkona: yeah that's what i mean oh and john to be 100 i'm being 100 honest to you when i um when i was thinking about the match against john first time i was honestly uh talking with many people about it and they were like oh man john is too strong yet john is too strong for you he got too much hand control and that's what i was also thinking it was actually the same thing when i um when i had this the the match against schoolboy
Leonidas Arkona: most of the people were saying no it's too early he's too strong and so i was working on weak parts i was working on my weakness and now i think it's 50 50 and this is my 100 honest opinion about the match so i don't think it's 80 20. definitely not so when i had to pull schoolboy one day before then i was thinking it's 80 20. but against john i think it's going to be very different and this is really this is my honest opinion
John Brzenk: my assessment really is based on um how well you effectively you know pulled with Larry and really that's kind of the only common factor that I have to go by is is how Larry felt to me a year year and a half or so ago um after he had pulled probably half a dozen people I stepped up to the table to pull Larry after in my mind he had to be more off
Engin Terzi: and he still gave me a hell of a match so i i uh i i feel like i'm walking into that type of uh that type of a situation so it's it's not going to be an easy task by any means yeah when people tell you about john the hand control and this and that that john and this john are not the same john the journal 2006 i mean don't get me wrong uh leonidas you wouldn't get this match
John Brzenk: and to be honest my hand I don't know it's hard to say but anyway moving on moving on to the next match Jacob is asking Leonidas who would you want to compete after John
Leonidas Arkona: um there is uh it's hard to say yet because like i said again i'm climbing up the ladder a little bit more from day to day i'm getting better and uh i think i just arrived in the sport of arm wrestling so at this point right now it's hard for me to say who i would like to pull and who's a realistic and good opponent for me
Leonidas Arkona: because I can tell you right after the match against John where I'm standing but um there is a name there there is one name that is on my bucket list uh it's very at the very top I really would like I really would like to pull the Iraqi left-handed left-handed ah okay
John Brzenk: Yeah, very, very stylistically. I think he's going exactly the direction you need that you're strong. I saw the match when Schoolboy and Iraki were having kind of a training, pulling left and right.
Leonidas Arkona: This is interesting for me, but just like I said, it might be a mismatch, it might not. From my point now, it's hard to say. Justin like I said, I'm getting better day by day. I'm trying to arrive in the sport. Give me some time and then we can talk about it after the match against John. Can I say my opinion? My opinion is how hard it would be for you to make 115 and how much
Engin Terzi: could you recover from Friday morning to the Saturday evening? What I'm just saying is like whatever shape you are in, just think that if you would just, I'm guessing that you would know how to do the water cuts. I don't know, but I think you would know it. So if you would do that, just say that you are Friday morning, 1.15, and how much could you recover to your power that right now you are not doing any diet,
Leonidas Arkona: Like how much can you be back? If you are 100 now, how much would you be? This is also a very interesting question and I can't tell you 100%, but I think if I will focus 100% on nutrition, on recovery and everything and not working out one day before, then I think I could come back like with at least 90% of strength. Do you know why I'm asking this one?
Engin Terzi: uh you were talking about being ranked and right now it is more realistic to be ranked in 115 than than the super heavyweight the super heavyweight looks just i mean like nightmare right now maybe maybe in long term but i don't see you in any short term there so someone with 115 category that there would be a good match for you but of course yeah
John Brzenk: That's a segue to the next match that I would like to ask you about, Engen, is Prudnik and Todd Hutchings. Okay. Do you think Todd Hutchings is up strong enough now to take on Prudnik? Okay, okay, okay. When you say like strong enough, do we talk about Todd Hutchings being stronger than last time or do we talk about Prudnik not being as strong as last time?
John Brzenk: A little bit of both, right? I'm asking you. A little bit of both. A little bit of both. This is going to be a good match. This goal run is going to be a good match. If Todd's able to stop it, he'll beat him. But he's still vulnerable to that hard hitting. Not a full hand top roll, but just outside.
John Brzenk: side pressure hit that that account and both that account and prudnik possessed but but uh yeah i think uh that this is gonna be this is gonna be much better matches this go around for those two guys if you want to be touching you need to control this pronator you don't control this pronator you lose that much doesn't matter and it has to be yeah and it has to be in an aggressive style where it's on your side of the table you can't allow him to you know to take him to take him i can i can tell you only one thing that prudnik
Engin Terzi: In Orlando, he'll be stronger than Prudnik Pupul against Irakli. If you realize that Prudnik didn't pull since the Devon match. It is more than one and a half years. So he's coming back. I think he will be stronger next month. And we will see. We will see. Yesterday, they were my guests. We talked about it. I don't know.
John Brzenk: Go ahead, sorry. Well, it just makes me think about how just crazy the 105 class has become. I mean, there's a dozen guys now that could be the title holders, right? I mean, who is the champ? Is it Oleg right now? Is it Franco? The guy that you beat. Yeah, I mean, I'd probably rather pull him than five or six of the other guys that are in that class, to be quite honest. I can tell he's definitely...
Engin Terzi: You beat him fair and square, but... He's thicker. I wouldn't bet on you today. Not the same guy. Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I understand that. I can see his forearms swole up a little bit bigger than it was the last time I... Yeah, it was his first comeback match. And then whenever I saw him, how he beat Kedirgali Ongarbe, I said maybe something is wrong with Ongarbe. And then whenever I see him with Dadikyan, and the guy is incredible. He versus Devon.
John Brzenk: at 105 would be very, very interesting, you know? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Devon seems to have lost a step or two with the weight loss. So, yeah, he's definitely still hard to handle with crazy endurance. But I think that he's going to have a lot of good matches at 105 if he has to make that big of a cut.
Leonidas Arkona: Yeah, I think he's coming back in November with a 115 match. And we will see. How do you see that match? Well, I think Todd surprised me every time when I see a super match with him and he wins it. He always surprised me. So I got it. Is there a weight limit? This is 105? 105, yeah. So my bets at this match, I would say it's Todd Hutchings who will win.
John Brzenk: John, Irakli beating Prudnik. Justin say that if somehow Prudnik beats Tad, will it automatically mean that Irakli would beat Tad? No, no. I mean, yeah. I mean, Irakli's got to have the side pressure. You know, the straight back is just not good enough. It needs to be accompanied with a lot of side pressure.
John Brzenk: Um, yeah, it's different type of top roll. Yeah. I think erectly controls too much, too much up and down back pressure. Um, so yeah, no, it's not a given by any means, but directly is looking stronger too. So, I mean, it's, uh, you know, yeah, I think, I think that's actually a really good match. Um, Hutchings and directly again, I think directly, uh, has proven himself to get, to get that rematch. If they pull again, it will be 95 kilo world title match. Oh, okay.
John Brzenk: Yeah, no perfect way to Yeah, both can make that both can make that way pretty easy. Yeah, yeah. Logan Missy is asking, john, are you still doing stem cells? I haven't done stem cells since Vegas, almost probably a year ago. Yeah, okay. I've had three treatments. I've had three treatments. So the last one was systemic. So it was the IV. Look at the forearm. Did you see that?
Leonidas Arkona: John, show me your hand, please. One time I got to do a screenshot. I'm going to start cramping up if I flex too hard. It's still too early for me. Please show me your thumb again. Your thumb is the interesting part. Oh, shit. I got a thumb too, so. All right. Leonidas, you realize how that thumb is when you compare with another one together with him.
Leonidas Arkona: Whenever he's on his end, he doesn't look so not normal. But whenever there is someone else with him, then you realize, especially when you hold on, then you feel even more, you know? Yeah. Devon told me when I visited Devon in his hometown, he told me that you, John, got the biggest thumb he ever felt. Come on, bigger than LeVon's? No way. I mean, I don't know if he pulled LeVon that time.
John Brzenk: uh right right yeah i know uh go ahead go ahead who's the thing that you don't bet against the god well you know like i said again i'm i'm doing my best to hang on and doing everything in my my knowledge and power to to be relevant still so i'm just still happy to be uh
John Brzenk: be invited to to do that some of these great matches i feel blessed that i'm still still ticking along but yeah no there's going to be a point where it's going to be an easy bet to bet against me john did you know that daddy can get perched during the petrenko match and he canceled his match with michael now michael is pulling against uh camille abnonski with dry charm okay i did not know that and i don't know who the who who is the guy that he's pulling against
John Brzenk: Michael's pulling in. The Polish guy. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, gotcha. All right, yeah, that'll be a good match. Right-handed, right? They're not pulling left. Right-handed, yeah. Oh, yeah, okay, yeah. Yeah, no, Michael will have his hands full. But he's looking like he's in pretty good shape. Yeah. You watching against Lars? Yeah, so it made me think of when we're going through this match is...
John Brzenk: now i'm losing my train of thought uh chafee against um uh frank lamparelli do you think i think that's going to be a really good match yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i mean it depends you know which shape dave chaffee is yeah yeah i don't yeah i don't know if he's got his neck issues all figured out and he's back to his normal form he's got tremendous tremendous side pressure that yeah might be enough to to but frank's gotten
John Brzenk: Great hand size and great back pressure top roll that if it stops, I think he can wear down Dave. So it'll be an exciting match. Dave, now, if the match is in center, Dave can do this as well. They'll still press. Yeah. It won't be so easy with someone the size of Frank. He has done it to Vitaly Laletin, so I don't know.
Leonidas Arkona: and how do you how do you see these matches michael versus camille and dave versus frank um the match with uh with camille and michael is very interesting for me i didn't know that until yet so i was i was uh i would say it's it's head to head it's it's kind of hard to to to think about it but
Leonidas Arkona: um i think i think that camille maybe carmel got this i don't know if he if john is strong enough to hold i mean of course john is extremely strong the king's move but also camille with his with his press
Leonidas Arkona: I think it's a little too mighty to hold it for John. So if you want me to bet, then I might say Kamil might win this one. How about if Michael also do this? Did you see the last match, Michael and Lars? Yes, yes, I did. I did. If he is quick enough, then it might be a good chance for him. But I think Kamil also is very quick. When I remember the match against Tobias,
Engin Terzi: He really surprised me, so yeah, I still think Kamil got this. There was left arm, his right arm, Kamil's right arm is a bit behind on his left, but still very effective, he beat Dave Chappie. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I still would say, I still would say
Leonidas Arkona: Camille is a little bit ahead of, but I'm not sure because I think also John, not John, I think Michael got a great endurance, so I would say 55-45. For Camille? For Camille, yeah. Okay, how about Dave Chaffee versus Frank Lampirelli? I don't know too much about Frank, so I would go with Dave. Very simple, sorry. Mm-hmm.
John Brzenk: and frank frank frank was really effective you remember his match with michael todd he was able to take michael out of position so he also beat matt mask yeah it won't be it won't be as easy to do that with the dave chafee but uh and also he has to worry about the side pressure coming across but uh yeah it'll be good yeah there was a match with frank uh that was popping up on youtube today uh it was um i don't know if it was a final match you guys might know it against who was it
Leonidas Arkona: i don't know what what match was it but i saw it today on youtube popping up so uh and he lost it he lost it i don't know i think coming coming posted about how fingers are important or something yes yes yes it was yes you're all right it was carmel um i might say dave win he
Engin Terzi: You know, you know why I think that, you know, it's very hard for Frank. You know, Frank may win as well, but even Matt Mask with dead wrist, he caused some problems to Frank. I don't know if you remember. Dave Chappie, even if he gets top row, I remember his pressure against, even against Hermes. If Hermes didn't put his shoulder behind,
Engin Terzi: he probably couldn't finish a day after he put his shoulder even the last match against one last round in this trap he beats uh well anyways it's going to be great match yeah yeah yeah it is it is what frank choose frank choose i i also offer him another match but he said that he wants to pull against yeah yeah
Engin Terzi: the Rustam Babaiev and Pauline, the revenge match. Lars time, Rustam was winning 2-1 and then he hurt his chest. Like, Pauline, anyone who takes Pauline lightly is out of his mind. After I saw him against Lachlan, Paul is a very dangerous guy. Yeah, Irakli beat him, Irakli beat him, yes, but Irakli beat also Prudnik, maybe even easier, you know, so...
John Brzenk: Yeah, Paul Linn's a new up-and-coming monster. Devon't know where his ceiling is, and Dabayev is the legend. I mean, if he comes in his normal legendary fashion that we've seen, you know, the last 10, 15 years, then, I mean, Rustam's, you know, the man, still in my mind. I mean, Todd Hutchings still needs a rematch against him to see what happens.
John Brzenk: so it um he's he's i mean the as good as they come if he comes in anywhere near his best form uh so uh i'm assuming that he's going to be a lot more well prepared uh knowing what he's going up against yeah he's going to be prepared for paul then so i think he might have might have underestimated paul the last time but it won't happen again so i'm assuming he's going to be
Engin Terzi: close to his best shape. So it should be a killer match because Paul has gotten, like you said, a lot better. So. John, just remember last time when Rustam won first two rounds, Paul actually tried to top roll him. You know, trying to top roll Rustam's hand is very hard. And then it was round three when actually Paul went this way. Decided to go inside. And then Rustam got injured. So we don't know where that match would go, you know, but it looked very effective.
Engin Terzi: So this time I don't think that Paul is going to go first around this way. He will just directly go there. And then Rustam is not a defensive guy. Rustam is known with his aggressive offense. And Paul is also known with the same way. So the start will be very important. Whoever puts the other one into the losing position probably will have more chance.
John Brzenk: right no i mean we've we've seen in the past what rustem can do to the you know the side pressure king todd hutchins i mean he just he comes crashing down so hard directly on the bicep just that that it takes away you know a lot of the the normal power that armrest was possessed so um yeah paul is going to definitely have to be the position and speed explosion is all paul is
Engin Terzi: better than Todd. I'm not saying that Paul is stronger than Todd, but with the goal, that explosiveness, Todd is a little bit slower. Todd never even gets engaged every time Rustam beat him. Todd was just moving and then Rustam was already finishing him. Every one of the matches we've talked about could be the headliner match. That's a great match. Yeah, I love it. Your match with Leonardo will be the
Engin Terzi: the main event oh no i gotta wait through all that stuff get all excited for all those matches the event the event started 1 p.m okay 1 p.m so i'm because 1 p.m over there is evening here so evening there is like good morning here so no i 1 p.m is not that that bad you know
John Brzenk: I will appreciate that. I'll have so much adrenaline going after watching all those matches. I think it'll be good for me. You want to start early? No, no, no. You say, Engin, I am the fifth match. You are the fifth match. Seventh match, seventh match. Listen, I don't care who your opponent is. You are the one who decides. I appreciate that, Engin. I appreciate it. Anywhere you put me, I'm good and happy.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, but just now you said that your adrenaline will be wasted, you know. That should be a good thing, unless it just exhausts me. I mean, at the end of the day, I'm going, oh my goodness, how did I survive that? Okay, let's sing, you know. And how do you see this match, Pauline and Rustam down ice?
Leonidas Arkona: Wow. Actually, I wouldn't bet against Paul anymore because he surprises me all the time when he has a super match. So I think and I also think that Paul really wants this win. So I would go with all this time. I think it's going to be a very tough match. But I think...
Leonidas Arkona: For me, Paul's a favorite, and I think he's working really hard for it. I don't know about, I don't know, I think Ruslan also is a hard worker, but I think Paul, he really wants that win. So, yeah, I think Paul has a good chance to win. I understand, yep. Okay, let's go a little bit faster so that we can finish all of them so nobody gets offended. Travis versus Porivas, left arm.
John Brzenk: i think i'll make it very short i think uh what's that i i think travis hopefully because i think he's a really cool guy and i really like his commentary during the matches so hopefully travis yeah this this this is going to be a tough tough challenge for travis i mean travis has been known to be quite honestly possibly the best left arm wrestler on the planet for many years but
John Brzenk: Corey is like, I mean, if I had to pick one guy to go against Travis, it would probably be Corey just because of his training with Michael Todd. And he knows that that posting back pressure move. And he's so big and he's got such a strong, dominant hand.
John Brzenk: It's going to be a tough hill for Travis to climb. If the match stops, I'm going to say Corey. But if Travis can be smooth and explosive from the go and get it to the pad, then of course Travis is going to be able to do it. But boy, it's going to be a tough match. It's a really tough match. I think Corey has the hand strength to maybe shut that down.
John Brzenk: We'll have to see where Travis is at. I mean, he didn't look that great with his right arm, so hopefully his left arm is in a little bit better shape than the right is. Yeah, Matt Mask versus Lars. I go with Matt Mask. Is it right or left-handed? Right arm.
John Brzenk: Yeah, I think Matt probably has a little too much outside for Lars to deal with. And I don't think Lars can even commit to a shoulder roll. And I think Matt's strong enough to hold that off. So yeah, I'll give a little bit of the edge to Matt, but also another close match.
Leonidas Arkona: up but hey lars if you see that don't take it personal because i think that we we both will see at the match before in the gym because he's also a guy who who likes to work out before having a super match oh lars yeah no yeah he'll probably he'll probably climb a few mountains too while he's at it you are in the same team with with with uh lars uh justin bishop janice amolins
Engin Terzi: you see did you see justin's video if he didn't just go to facebook and watch he is firing to devon because devon thinks that yannis is gonna win he says like you'll be part of the team east from now on you know we don't want in the team west yeah it can't turn into a technical match because yannis is the best that
John Brzenk: little technical adjustments. So Justin has to be explosive and has to finish the match and be smart about it. He has to have control and finish quickly. If it stops at any point, I think Giannis is just too technical and will figure a way through it. As much as I hate to bet against the West here, but Giannis would be tough enough to crack for anybody.
Engin Terzi: So now Justin is going to make another video and then tell you to go to Team West as well. Artem you familiar with these guys? Yes, of course. I would say, not much to say for me, I say 60-40 for Giannis. 60-40, okay. And now we have Craig Tullier versus Tom Holland, Spider-Man.
John Brzenk: I don't know much about those guys. Now you're getting into the lighter weight classes that I don't have. You don't know Craig Tullier? Craig who? Craig Tullier.
John Brzenk: yeah to the to the oh okay you said yeah you threw me so i know craig for sure very explosive powerful almost almost the level of paul well i won't give him that much credit he's not quite as strong as pauline but very similar builds and styles yeah maybe one category is smaller but yeah one little smoke yeah yeah
John Brzenk: um tom holland i don't know that much about i he's kind of he kind of has a defensive hook about him and he can go long distance right so yeah um yeah so craig if it matched if the match is quick craig's craig's the winner if it stops then we got a match and
Engin Terzi: Do you know these guys? Well, I got to pass this one. I don't know. That's too much, so I got to pass this one. Doug Erlich versus Hunter. Hunter knows. Do you know these guys?
John Brzenk: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I saw him, I think, when I was out in Travis' tournament. Yeah, so we're here again. All I know is what I've seen. So I really don't have it. I shouldn't comment. I mean, as an Aymeric, if you don't know, Leonidas probably doesn't know either. Not really. Okay, let's go. Artem Taranenko, Mindaugas Tarasaitis. Left-handed or right-handed? Right-handed.
John Brzenk: But Mindaugas is 77 kilo. This is at 187. So Minda is 170 pounds, but it's 187. Right. Here again, we got someone that's got tremendous endurance. And if he can stop the match, then Mindaugas is going to come out on top. Artem has to be explosive and get it done quickly, or he's going to be in trouble.
Engin Terzi: Okay. Paul Talbott, Raz Serdekian. You know Paul Talbott? This has to be left, right? Yeah, left hand. You know the Armenian guy, right? Raz. Yeah, yeah. Paul Talbott, he used to be a beast left-handed, so I'm not going to bet against Paul if it's left-handed. It is left-handed, yeah. And this match is Leonidas. Artem you familiar?
Engin Terzi: Not really. I'm sorry. Okay. No, no, it's okay because that is how we will get used to, you know, you will be in the same event. This can be a long day in Florida. You got a lot of matches, dude. 15 matches. It's 15 matches. 15 matches. Oh, okay. Yeah, well, it's going to be, it'll be, it'll be capable. Yeah, you're going to start early in the afternoon. It'll be, it'll be good. Lars two match, Elizabeth Mocek versus Aleksandra Ozerova. That's two boys, brothers.
John Brzenk: wife and you know the elizabeth the 154. okay yeah i i'm sorry but i don't yeah i don't i you can't you couldn't hardly pronounce her names i i don't know who they are jonathan breda hey mary freelance french guy versus uh texas guy right from texas from right yeah yeah yeah bretta um well i gotta go with
John Brzenk: Right. I mean, I yeah, I don't know. Devon't know. Quite honest. So it wouldn't be it wouldn't be an educated guess. Okay. Okay. Very quick. I will ask you if you think that we finish it. What did you guys think about the last seven? What did you guys think about Sasha? War. Yeah. No, unexpected. I thought Sasha would be stronger, but they have a big
Engin Terzi: Got a lot of heart. It's got a lot of endurance. Hell no. Hell no. Hell no. I've already been schooled by Sasho. I don't need that match. Sasho had the wrist to control.
John Brzenk: how much risk will be dropping and then you have this one yeah yeah yeah it's still it's still a tall pass for me to make that transition and that you know i don't i don't know i don't think i have possessed the side pressure even at that weight if i can come in at 230 maybe i could i could deal with it make that happen make him make him make 90 kilos and i could be 105. did you have a chance to watch the last event
Leonidas Arkona: yeah sure it was a great match so that's all i can say but i enjoyed every match to be honest yeah yeah were you guys surprised that laletin just dominated uh morozov uh i was uh i wasn't surprised but i was uh hoping that morozov and i was thinking that morozov would uh would have a little bit more of the tank so yeah laletin is a beast yeah oh he's looking he's looking
Engin Terzi: beastly bigger is is a a future match set up with him and lavon is that something that's in the works or yeah yeah yeah yeah no i think he's definitely deserving yeah he's looking strong right now is really really representing his frame you know you know he he was shoulders everything he was he was much bigger pompey compared to before and let's see let's see how it will be
Engin Terzi: and super heavyweight 105 is john like have you ever seen i haven't seen arm wrestling at this level before i'm not saying that this is like very very hard very very difficult to win that belt you know like right very hard that the level is short
Engin Terzi: It's so hard. Hard to win it and even harder to hang on to it. Like I said, the 105 category is mind-boggling to me right now. It's like, okay, who's... What do you have now? Petrenko, Zadigian, Patachins, Ongarbaev. You have now Petro Marharins. And then we have you. And then there's so many other guys. So many other guys. I'm quickly being dropped out of the top 10, to be quite honest.
Engin Terzi: ah there's that many guys there's that many guys i mean it's it's crazy yeah yeah we will see and you i forgot to count rutnik and iraqi yeah yeah yeah anyway so guys do you have any last words for the fans to each other you know i'm just saying uh john you first i'm just excited i'm excited to participate um i i'm looking forward to all the other matches on the card um
John Brzenk: You know, I'm going in with high expectations. Like I said, I'm going to be extremely excited and thrilled if I can, you know, represent and do well. But yeah, no, I'm coming in as best prepared as I know how to prepare at this point in my life. I'm doing everything I can do to come in full power. So I appreciate the match and I'm excited.
Leonidas Arkona: Yeah, so I will... I think I will...
Leonidas Arkona: fly over four days before the match just to to get over my jet lag and I'm also very excited for the match and you know guys what's uh what's funny about this match obviously John is people's favorite I cannot even be mad about it because always when when you get a super match Sean I'm always rooting for you but this time it's a little different so I think the tables have turned and I have to vote for your opponent this time
John Brzenk: And yeah, I'm very excited for it. It's going to be great day, great matches. Can I negotiate it maybe like a five minute rest period between matches and games? Can you do that for me? I don't know. This minute and a half thing is baloney, right? You understand that there's no way that anybody can recover. Devon't worry, John. Our referee is blocked. Problematic, you know.
John Brzenk: I need to be more calculative on how to stretch that out. I need to spill my water or spill some food on the table or something that has to bring a cleanup crew in or something. Something creative like that work. John, can I ask you something? Sorry, Leonidas, don't forget, please. When you have done everything,
Engin Terzi: You have experienced everything. You know, when I say everything, like for sure more than anyone else. So are there some times that you feel more motivated than the other times? Like whenever you pull Alex Volyvodov or now when you have the West versus West in your homeland, when you know that there will be at least six, 700, maybe more people rooting for you like crazy, it's homeland. Like, do you think the motivation will be a little bit different?
John Brzenk: I hope I'm not affected by that so much. I feel like it's hard to even put your finger on what works better. I mean, I've actually tried to hype myself up and get more excited. And sometimes I feel like that hurts me. I can remember back in
John Brzenk: times pass where, you know, someone would be basically waking me up before my match and I would actually perform better, you know, so if I stay calm and relax, so it's hard to figure out with arm wrestling, you know, what is the most effective way to approach a match. I mean, I know for me, there's a pivot point where I can be so dominant and then all of a sudden,
John Brzenk: like the whole, my whole gas tank ran out and, and a minute and a half, two minutes isn't enough time to regroup. So, um, I know, I know there's that a very dangerous point where, um, and there's been times in the past where I've done it to myself, right. I, I feel like, okay, I want to feel that, you know, and, and, and test the waters a little bit. And then I go, oh shit, I just drowned myself. I just, you know, drowned myself. So, um, yeah, no, it's just being, uh,
John Brzenk: Justin being aware of all that stuff and just being careful for me. I mean, I need to be just more, not get so caught up in the adrenaline in the moment and be calm and think things through and know that there's danger if I don't do everything exactly right.
Leonidas Arkona: But one last thing that I got to say, I'm sorry, one last thing is, John, I think pulling in your hometown with so many fans and having your back, it's a great feeling. I remember having a super match with Larry here in Germany at the Sundays. We had around about 5,000 people cheering up for me. I mean, sorry for that, Larry, but oh, it's a great feeling. It gives you at least 5% extra strength. But John, I got to tell you one thing. I will not go easy on you because of that.
Engin Terzi: I don't expect you to, for sure. Hopefully, I can stay focused and feed off of that. Maybe we can... I'll leave it at that. I love this competition, which is full with respect, but still you can feel that both sides are very determined to win. I love it. Anyways, guys, John, thank you very much, my friend. Always an honor. Pleasure.
John Brzenk: Leonidas, thank you very much, my friend. Leonidas. Yeah, go ahead. Okay, so I was just going to recommend him. Probably when you go to Orlando, you probably should go through SeaWorld and then Disneyland and then Epic Center maybe the day before. So you can see all the sites. Walk around. I'm not sure. Before the match. I actually thought about it. Maybe go to Disney World. No, that's probably not a good idea.
Engin Terzi: I'm not sure about it. No, no, no. Concerned. We'll see you. Take care. Take care of yourself. And I hope to see you guys in four weeks, less than four weeks. You're looking good. You're looking good. And you're all healthy back to full health. I still have those night fevers. I don't know. And then the sweats all night. But I think somebody today told me that this is because of being too long on antibiotics.
John Brzenk: then they said that maybe i'm cleaning now or something i don't know right right yeah so the prognosis you should be 100 by time august rolls around most likely i won't be there you won't be there most likely yeah oh well hell won't be the same without you come on it will be even better you know no how is that possible who's going to coordinate all this stuff who do you got
John Brzenk: Yeah. All right. All right. Yeah. Take care. Take care. Health is more important. So take care. All right. My pleasure. We'll see you in four weeks. Four weeks. Four weeks. Four weeks.
