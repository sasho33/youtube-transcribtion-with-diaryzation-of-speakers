Engin Terzi: OK, I think Ermes came. Ermes, I made a mistake. I made a mistake. Why? I should do YouTube Live. I did Zoom Live. When it is Zoom Live, it will show one of us at a time, not both of us. If it was YouTube Live, then we would be seen together.
Engin Terzi: There is only one way for us to be looking together if I send the link to one more person. I don't think it's a mistake. This is a mistake. Because I sometimes do... I never heard something like that. What do you mean? Mistake YouTube Zoom.
Engin Terzi: No, no. When I do Zoom chats, usually I do with three, four people. But whenever it is one person, and then it is showing, when I talk, it shows me on YouTube. Whenever you talk, I think it shows you. You understand? It doesn't show both of us. Yeah. But when it is YouTube invitation, it shows together both of us. So maybe I invite someone else as well. Let me see. Maybe...
Engin Terzi: I might just say, who? Rymond. Rymond, Rymond. Yeah. Big friend. Rymond. Yeah, yeah. Okay, what's the top role is for average IQ people? Yeah.
Ermes Gasparini: let's see who would yeah let me see so how is everything in the mess everything good here in italy very too hot really i was wearing every day like crazy you train crazy my weight is a little down uh-huh
Ermes Gasparini: People think I go to 115 kilos, but every day write to me, yeah, you want to go 115, but it's not true. I think you can do both of them. That's what I think. I think you can do both. Because you're eating like crazy, crazy, crazy, so you're like 125 kilos. No, crazy, no.
Ermes Gasparini: I think when I was 130, yes, I ate like crazy. But for 125, normally. 125 normal? What's your weight now? 122, 3? Yeah, in the morning 20, in the afternoon 22, more or less. So when you wake up, you are under 20 kilos? No.
Engin Terzi: and do you think that in 120 kilo you can you can beat like when you lose five kilo you can beat those people super heavyweight no no no no under three by the way your wrist looks can you do like this again your wrist is so thick so big yeah it's training like a lot in this period yeah okay
Engin Terzi: Yeah. And he looks very, very sick, yeah. Okay, there is . How are you? Always great to see quality smile on you. Artem you planning to win the $20,000 from Devon by beating Deserano? Of course. But I think he already changed it. Devon changes his mind every day, we've got to say. Uh-huh.
Engin Terzi: Okay, I will add here Roman Gamtenazze and we will be three people so people can see all of us at the same time. Okay. Yeah. So when do you think that you will be ready? The earliest end of this year, right? The earliest. I think yes. Yeah, because now
Ermes Gasparini: I'm lucky I can train 80% of the movement exercise. I can't push too much inside pressure. When I train with some people and I'm resting, when I push like this, I feel still pain. Can you show me where exactly, which part of the shoulder?
Engin Terzi: Yeah. Oh, yeah. When you do like these or like these, you have pain. Yeah, yeah. You know, Hermes, you need to do a lot of holding from this guy and then. Yeah, yeah, I do. I did every time. Yeah. Every time. This one and this one. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You need to really, really train there. And when you make it stronger, then you will be getting hurt less. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: Hello, guys. Can you hear me? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. How are you? Yeah. Now I think all is okay. Hey, Hermes, my friend. Hey, Roma. Made in Italy. Quality. I did it for this stream especially. My friend, Bambino, how are you? Good, good.
Engin Terzi: Thank you. It's always great to hear. I'm also doing good working behind the scenes, you know, and right now, huge project for our last events, final 20 fires. There was this like huge video with 4K quality. I'm working on that one and it will be finished very, very soon in this upcoming days. And people, everybody can watch.
Engin Terzi: yeah okay quality of it because when we were live streaming it it was not a good quality and now it will be way better it's coming up soon good yeah i remember when you did my video with lego it was one of the best
Engin Terzi: yes i almost cried really it was super super super yeah i remember you messaged me instantly thank you thank you very much because i i did it i did it for like from the heart you know i was like feeling that wow this was awesome match and yeah maybe we will see the rematch did you know that he paid me 20 000 for the copyrights to involve me in the the the
Engin Terzi: uh clip don't tell me don't don't tell me he didn't pay you anything i didn't pay anything no i really liked it he didn't pay you anything for that clip elmas ah he yeah because because he used your your video next time next time next time okay okay that's good
Ermes Gasparini: Did you see this today? Yeah, really. I was so excited. I think we are very lucky to see him. Still, right? Yeah. Yeah, I agree. And I think John really feels something special. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: When he took Irakli's wrist, everybody was like screaming in the building. I was like, I was recording behind the scenes live streams, but like there was shivers down in my spine, you know, and it was crazy. Crazy experience. Yeah. Yesterday, yesterday, no, two days ago, Levan was my guest. Did you, did you see the interview? No. No.
Engin Terzi: I asked him, you know, what are the top five guys that has chance to beat him? He didn't count your name. Okay. Yeah. Good. I said, why? Better. He underestimated me again. Better for me. No, no. He counted your name as well. Yeah. Yeah.
Ermes Gasparini: But next time you pull against him, you will beat him? I need to beat him. Yeah, for sure. You need to do something better than last time, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I already know what I need to do, what I need to train a lot. And I think I will do better, for sure. And if the match will go the same,
Ermes Gasparini: Same position, same... For sure I will beat him. Because I made a lot of mistakes. If Jerry was in my situation, for sure it was better.
Ermes Gasparini: But the people don't understand one thing, I think, my opinion. Because I think when I stopped him, I stopped him from my power on back pressure, not like a dead, not like a flop press, immediately. First time, back pressure, and the second movement, flop press.
Engin Terzi: I will ask you something. It's not possible you to not to have the light behind you, right? Is it possible? Because like, Oh, yeah, that's good. Yeah. It's better at least. Yeah. And then turn the lights on. Yeah. And then
Engin Terzi: Okay. People are asking why Roman is here. Hermes can speak English. How to explain? I'm here to translate. It's my translator. Yeah, yeah. Because Hermes is trying to learn Georgian. Justin to provoke Levan.
Engin Terzi: And so Roman is 24 hours giving him Georgian lessons. And Roman is planning to go to Italy to make Kinkali for Hermes. Yeah, Kinkali. Very good. You ate Kinkali? I ate, yeah. Good? Yeah, good. Yeah, good. There is some liquid in it. It's not like food, Italian food.
Ermes Gasparini: No, it's Georgian food. King Kali is better than it. But you don't compare Georgian food with Italian food. No, no, Georgian is better. Like Champions League, like amateurs, same level. But it's the same, same like in arm wrestling. The same exact in arm wrestling. Where the Georgia is, is the same in King Kali.
Engin Terzi: Yeah. Wait, wait, my friend. Wait more time. We need more time. I like pizza better. But pizza should be with the pineapple, right? Pineapple and ketchup together. Okay. Wow. Yogi put ketchup on pizza.
Engin Terzi: Oh, I think that they should never, ever, ever let him. Okay, someone else came. Who is that? It's Kamil Jablonski. Before Roman, I sent the link to Kamil as well, just to make us three people. Hello, Kamil. I am working now, but I just sit down to have a rest. And I see something and I say, oh, nice. Hello. Hello, my friend. Kamil, how do you say hello? How are you in Polish?
Engin Terzi: Cześć, jak się masz? Jak się masz? Jak się masz? Jak się masz? Jak się masz? Jak się masz? A who is on Hermes and who is on the chat? I'm Roman, we have met each other several times. Roman is the translator of Hermes for Georgian. Really? Oh, for Georgian, okay. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: Anyway, so Hermes was saying that before you joined, that he would easily beat you with left arm. And then, so then I had to send you the link. Okay, Hermes, we can try. No, no, no, stop. Stop. I'm retired. With left, don't, will not pull again. Maybe... Okay. Maybe five years. I need five years. Wow.
Ermes Gasparini: But what's happened? Why you don't want to pull left? No, no. Too pain. I can't. I did the RMA one month ago to see what the fuck I have inside here. Because every time pain, I don't know why. And they don't show nothing.
Engin Terzi: Kamil, can you beat him right arm as well, Ermes? Possible. I am not afraid of him nothing. Yeah, because he's top roller, so you will probably press his right here. Yes, yes. Kamil, Kamil, who beat Dave Sheffy easier, you or Ermes? Me.
Engin Terzi: Okay. But I can tell you something. When I was beating Dave Chaffee, I was 90% of my maximum power. And now I am 110% of my maximum power. So then Ernest has no chance at all. One year I improve a lot because pain go away. And I keep training every muscles of my forearm. And it's really...
Engin Terzi: solid is really strong now so i hoping i hoping i will get into top 10 and slowly i will start beating this big boys so time will will show but you know i'm surprised how hermes could be healthy with his right arm you know because he have super hard matches on the right arm
Ermes Gasparini: Yeah, that's why he has some shoulder problem. Ah, he has some problem on the shoulder. Shoulder problem, yeah. I think from the Levan match, Hermes. Yeah, after this, I pulled it with Gerrardy, but I don't push it too much with him and I don't feel pain. After Vitaly, I failed. Because he continued to do like this and...
Ermes Gasparini: It was very hard. Yes, now I need to recover when I feel 100% good. I don't want to lose a match for the pain, you know. So, Hermes, you mean if I will do floor press on you, you will have more pain, yes? Yeah. No, if you see impossible, do floor press with me. Ah, okay. Sorry, I forgot. Sorry.
Engin Terzi: Kamil, only yesterday I asked him, would you pull Kamil's right arm? He said, anyone. I can pull, but except Kamil. He said, no Kamil. Oh, you see? You lie, Hermes. Devon't lie. See? He's a smart guy. He's a smart guy, right? He knows who to avoid, you know? Yeah. Because he eats pizza all the time. He's a smart guy, yeah.
Engin Terzi: yeah i am not i am not that danger yet but in 10 days no maybe 12 13 days we will find out if i am danger because i don't know myself as well how good i could be now i think i am very good but we will see we will see then august yes yes who do you think is gonna be camille or uh michael
Ermes Gasparini: It's very difficult because if you see the match with Lars, Michael did a very good job. And Lars is probably stronger than Kamil. Yes, of course. Maybe if he has some lucky day, he can win. Kamil, right? If he's lucky, he can win. Yes, I agree.
Ermes Gasparini: No, I think Camille is faster than Lars to go on the flop. And who is faster, Michael or Camille? It's very difficult to say. Too difficult. But if I need to put some money... Maybe Michael for the experience, maybe.
Engin Terzi: It's like 51 to 49. I have a question for you. If Michael Beath comes in, is it with open arm top roll or is it with the press or just fast sideway? Press or sideway. This one, he will be exhausted, right? Yeah, he will lose.
Ermes Gasparini: or maybe it will be like the match when he fought with jerry no you remember a very long match yeah yeah or maybe something like that you said your match with jerry long match no no no uh jerry and michael todd you remember very long match yeah maybe but very beautiful fight really very interesting
Engin Terzi: I don't know now the shape of Kamil, if his right arm is stronger than his left. I think his left arm is stronger. A little bit, not a lot now. Not a lot? Okay. Not a lot. Do you have anything better with your right arm than left arm? Everything.
Engin Terzi: your right hand apart from the press power oh your hand wrist everything is better yeah even bicep yes biceps as well is better but okay i thought you were stronger on left arm no no except press
Engin Terzi: And the press is his strongest move, his real style. That's why it's very important. The side pressure, I am not sure, but press will do more on the left. But last time I found out that my right supination with the side pressure is very solid. And I think it could be similar now to the left. So I think my right will be a danger for sure because I have more options.
Engin Terzi: I have stronger hook, stronger topple, strong rising and my left is only strong press but the press is killing everyone, I see. So, yeah. I can't wait to release the power on my right arm and see the real power, you know, to see. Hermes, who are the people that...
Engin Terzi: you would like to pull right now? Like, is there anyone on your mind that you already pulled Laletin? I don't think there is a reason to pull again, you know? I think you guys need to pull with other people. I mean, you can pull again. Yeah, yeah. Maybe with Laletin it's more interesting next year, maybe end of year like this. Yeah, yeah. After this, it depends who wins, you know.
Ermes Gasparini: Is there any possibility Levan to be your first match? No, I want a second or third match. Maybe next spring or something? Yeah, I need the first things to fill my shot because I don't want to lose amount of time.
Ermes Gasparini: But is there any possibility that you don't pull anyone until next spring or you will pull someone at the beginning of next year or end of this year? Depends. Or I will do good preparation for 11 matches directly. But I don't know if it's good to do like this because if you stop too much, the competition is not good for myself.
Ermes Gasparini: I understand. To feel the sensation like this. I'd like to see you, Hermes, with Alex Kurdecha. Or Alex, now we'll see with Jerry or Zerano or maybe another time with Gennady. Maybe Laletin? Laletin? Laletin.
Engin Terzi: i think i think laletin maybe is number one in the queue to levan and you are number one and i don't know if kurdeha it is but one of this you three guys maybe even zeranov is coming as well you need to prove something with you each other who is the number one to pull levan i have a question
Engin Terzi: what do you think i'm not asking who's gonna win or something but like you're analyzing about jerry versus alex kurdecha match like how do you see like you you know are missing very well you are still young what are you now 32 31 31 yeah but you you are i can say the one oh two
Engin Terzi: most knowledgeable guy you know you understand you have very good understanding of arm wrestling especially table performance so how did you see Jerry and Alex match like technically you know how do you see analyzing I think the most difficult part is the leverage of the arm because
Ermes Gasparini: if you put i think jerry with matushenko i put all my money on matushenko for sure because but like laliting kurdeca with long leverage he they they don't have a good connection with the
Engin Terzi: inside the power so you are saying that you're because when you hold arm muscle jerry you kind of a little bit hold low these two fingers i hold his wrist yeah so what i just say that so you are saying that you know kurdesha has very tall forearm and him to hold that low will make his arm like very yeah he needs to do like this and for jerry it's more simple to do this
Ermes Gasparini: Or maybe to hook him. So you are saying that the leverage, the arm height... The size of Alex is too big to do movements like a heavyweight champion. So you are saying that Jerry will be able to flop? I think he can.
Ermes Gasparini: So Jerry is going to flop and then if Kurdecha is strong enough, he will beat him. If not, if the match gets longer... I think really 50-50. Maybe for the first second round for the power, I think Alex can win with the top roll, maybe press because he can do. But if he doesn't have enough endurance,
Engin Terzi: And the second or third match, it will be very hard for him to be very close in this fight. So you are saying that if this was a title match and they need to win four times, then it would be more Jerry's advantage? If there were more rounds, it would be Jerry's advantage? If there were more rounds, yes. More advantage for Jerry. So you are saying that Alex has the advantage in early rounds, but later rounds, maybe
Ermes Gasparini: Yeah, because I don't think he can do the same technique when he fought with Jari. For the size and the leverage, I think. I understand. Do you think that the guys from Europe to go to the US is also a disadvantage? A little bit, yes.
Ermes Gasparini: If you are stronger, you will win. Is it because of travel or jet lag? Maybe a little bit jet lag. But if you go one day, three, four days before, you have enough time to recover these things. But for this, I think it's 1%, 2%. It's not very important.
Engin Terzi: I understand, yeah. But if I remember, you already was in Aymeric, Hermes. You was pulling Michael Todd, I think. No, Michael Todd was in Italy. He pulled Matt Mask. Matt Mask you pulled there, okay. Hermes, what was your weight when you pulled Matt? You were how many kilos? 108, 10.
Engin Terzi: yeah and and when you pulled alex uh back in uh pal you were like it was uh 100 16 15 17. so 115 okay yeah yeah yeah anyway so let's talk about some other matches good do you think ermis john
Ermes Gasparini: will be able to beat Leonidas or Leonidas is too strong? Leonidas for me is a very good friend but a little bit still I hope John wins. But I'm sure Leonidas is training like crazy in this period really. Now he
Ermes Gasparini: If you compare before, now he's focused like an arm wrestler. He does a lot of exercises. For my heart, I hope John. If I need to put money, I put Leonidas.
Ermes Gasparini: Ah, okay, so Leonidas physically will be stronger. Yeah, because when I fought with him, he had this part of the bicep, super strong, and he can do some king moves. His endurance is super strong. His good boy is very strong. His good boy is super strong. And he won with his good boy.
Engin Terzi: Okay, now my turn. Kamil, have you seen this match? Now Kamil's turn. Now my turn. I have some news about Leonidas. He was pulling my friend last weekend. And I know everything now. And now I put all my money on John Brzęk. Oh, okay. Some conspiracy going on. Okay, but maybe your friend and John
Engin Terzi: pulling on different directions. Yeah, but I think Leonidas is too tired. But he will rest. He will some, maybe. But I still think John is a couple of levels above my friend. And I think Leonidas will lose. You ask me and I'm telling you what I think. I understand.
Engin Terzi: We will see, we will see. And Ermes, will Michael beat Kamil 3-0 or 3-1? 3-0, easy. 3-0, okay.
Engin Terzi: That's what who think, you Engin or Hermes? No, I'm just filling the pot. I'm just trying to assist Hermes so that he can say something to his youth. We all know that we are just joking.
Engin Terzi: yeah but you know i am a little bit different i don't listen anyone i going and i will kill it that's my plan and no one will change nothing in me i'm just going and i will do my best yeah yeah but it doesn't mean that we cannot joke you know we know that yeah of course yeah yeah
Engin Terzi: yeah today i saw the video that i also posted the one that you prepared that you are you are saying that you are honestly did you see the video he says that he is afraid that he will he will hurt michael you know michael invited him to his youtube program and then he calmly tells him to write on his face and rebecca's face on michael's channel he says honestly i'm afraid that i will hurt you
Engin Terzi: Like, yeah, the guy, the guy is just straightforward that whatever he thinks he says, you know, like the other way. Yeah. Yeah. Not joking around.
Engin Terzi: You know, Michael is coming back after injury and I don't believe one year after injury or surgery, you are ready for 100%. I don't believe that. And that's why I am worried that maybe his arm can't handle my power.
Engin Terzi: Time will show. He's genuinely worried. He's a good friend of Michael. I really hope not. I really hope not that he will get injured or something. But time will show. You be careful because all these things, you know, people right now, they are saving.
Engin Terzi: and then if you lose they are just gonna say this is what tamil said and this is what happened you know after i won devon larat i get so much hate about shoulders so now nothing more will put me down okay i am ready for any uh any uh you know comments yeah anyway so let's go let's go next one hermes your friend
Ermes Gasparini: Lampirelli versus Dave Chaffee. It's very hard. How much weight Chaffee? 120? He is always 125, 275. I mean, always 275, which is 125 kilos. Because Lampirelli is 115.
Ermes Gasparini: Yeah, I know. I don't think these 10 kilos change too much. Stylistically, Lampirelli is more advantage because Lampirelli is a lot stronger in the wrist pronation than in the hand.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, but can he finish? Because I remember that... This is the problem because Cefi can do this. Evgeny when you put against Cefi, you stop him here, you brought here. And whenever he put his shoulder, your arm was going like this. But then you finish with the shoulder pressure. I remember I was completely down with my body.
Ermes Gasparini: and they push it like crazy and I can't finish him. Evgeny if Lampirelli has his wrist, if Sheffield has shoulder pressure, it will be a very tough match. I don't know if Sheffield is the same shape when he fought with me because in the last
Engin Terzi: He goes a little bit down, up and down. Yeah, but even last February, last round, when they did the scrap, last round he beat David Sheffield. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, I mean, his flop press is serious. Yeah, yeah. Really, I hope... Really, I hope...
Ermes Gasparini: A lot Lampirelli win, but it will be very hard. I think Lampirelli knows what he needs to do. Maybe he will climb on the hand of Jeffy and maybe without pressure he can still win.
Engin Terzi: Same when they fought with Michael Todd. And what do you think Kamil? I think this is a great fight. Both of these guys have big hands and Frank has super good control on the hand.
Engin Terzi: But it's very difficult to finish Dave Chaffee. He has so much power in losing position. Evgeny I remember when I was pressing him, I have very difficult to press him the last few centimeters. So I think Frank needed something like a press to finish Dave Chaffee. I don't know if he will be able to finish him with the top roll.
Engin Terzi: think about Michael Todd and Frank, he was doing very well. So I think this fight could be 50-50. Only one thing I'm not sure because looks like Dave is coming back with the shape. I think he's getting stronger and stronger and could be maybe 5%. How do you understand that he's getting back to his shape?
Engin Terzi: Because when he was pulling with me, I asked him, how is your shape? And he said like 85, 90% of his best shape. And now when he was pulling Vitaly, he pinned him one time with press. It means that he must be at least 92% or a little bit more. And now he could be like 97, maybe he's back more. No, no, just because time is passing, it doesn't mean that you need to get better. You need to be healthy to do this.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, but that's what I'm thinking. He was doing some stencils or something. I think he could be healthier now. That's why I think he could be stronger. I am not really sure. I would say 50-50. Great match. The part is that when Lampirelli top-rolled Mad Mask,
Engin Terzi: If you remember, even Matt Mask with this short repress, he gave some hard time to Lampareble. So that is why, you know, even if Frank couples him, it may be hard. So Frank needs to go this way quick if he stays here. And then if
Engin Terzi: Dejpo's shoulder, it will be very, very hard for him. So he needs to go to the winning side very quickly. Immediately. Yeah, immediately. So otherwise, it will not be so. I am sure Frank has now a lot of experience from these two types of guys like Michael Todd and Matt Mask. So I think he will do well. He will do good. I think endurance also will help Frank.
Engin Terzi: If it comes to endurance, Frank has more chance. Ermes, yesterday or two days ago, Lewon said that if Devon and Laletin push, he thinks that Devon would win. No. You don't agree? No.
Ermes Gasparini: because after this the people think Devon he won with me and me I won with Laletin but arm wrestling is not like this style make difference a lot and I think Laletin is the most dangerous opponent for Devon for the leverage because Devon he
Ermes Gasparini: West part is rising and the wrist pronation. And he can do good, he's doing good with us, but with like Urdeka, Laletin, with long leverage, he can't do the same. Yeah, but just remember, when you pull Laletin,
Ermes Gasparini: Laletin doesn't start like this, right? He goes like this. But only first round. The second round, he started more higher when I fouled. He started higher? Yeah. Me, I was like this. But Laletin, he started not like this, but more like this. Hmm.
Ermes Gasparini: It's not to say that Laetitia will win easily. It will be a very close fight, but I think Laetitia can win. Do you think that when you say close match, if the match is close like this, do you think that it is possible to beat Devon in a close match? Closer is very difficult to win with Devon.
Ermes Gasparini: But he doesn't have very good endurance. Devon doesn't have good endurance? No. How did you understand that? Because he lost with Gennady and for the problem of endurance. And with Lewand, he lost because in the first match he pushed too much.
Engin Terzi: yeah and after after levan pressured him i think i think like as neil pickup says that whenever you are under your limits of your elastic emissions and then you you kind of get like not injured but just like you can't pull anymore not sure if it was about the endurance but gennady match yes about the endurance but when you talk about endurance like gennady is not a regular guy
Engin Terzi: I also remember another thing. Let me finish. When Devon and Gennady pulled, Devon was just now with the stem cells. He was just recently starting hook. His endurance was here.
Engin Terzi: But the match went inside. You understand? Because whenever he did this, Gennady was pushing. So he went to inside game. And I don't think at that time, especially, his inside endurance was as good as his outside endurance. Do you understand my point? Yeah, I understand. I understand about you. If Devon pulls Laletin, I think it will be outside versus outside endurance. You know, normally...
Engin Terzi: george swedcov is also has very good energy if the mass stop he can pull long time but with with uh devon every round he had the good position but he got exhausted you know so when devon is pulling outside his endurance is better than his inside endurance that he used against gennady so maybe maybe his endurance
Ermes Gasparini: is better than what you think? You said his endurance is not good, but... Yeah, but I don't say his endurance is not good. It's not the endurance... I think he doesn't have super endurance. You think Laletin's endurance is better than Devon's? No, no, no, no. Okay, if the match is close?
Engin Terzi: Because Leipzig have a lot of power in the side pressure top row. No, no, I understand. When you say power, you power and you finish. But if the match is close, I'm saying that. If he did his power, but the match stopped. So I just think that if the match stops, it's not so easy for Leipzig to win unless he just also goes like this. But I don't know how good he can do that. I don't know. I understand your...
Engin Terzi: I just think that if the match is close, it's hard. But Laletin may dominate. I don't know. Yeah, yeah. For sure. This question is perfect to me. Okay, go ahead. I pull both guys' left arm and I know exactly who has more endurance. Come on, man. They will knock him. Six years or five years or four years, whatever.
Engin Terzi: didn't pull left arm i mean and then he didn't even train and then and then you're saying that his left arm is even better the better than his right arm no no no but but this but this what i will tell you i think you will not expect uh devon have more endurance than vital yeah but
Engin Terzi: I have so much pulling before the go with Devon on the table. So much. And I have better endurance than Devon. But with Vitaly, he goes out faster than Devon. After he won, enough to win. After. Good point.
Engin Terzi: But there was not so much pulling like with Devon. With Devon, we have like 10 runs. 10 runs? But how long was those runs? No, it was just before ready-go. No, no, but how long did it take? Like before ready-go and start again, right? 30 minutes. 30 minutes all supermatch. No, what I'm just saying, the active match, active pulling. Couple of minutes.
Engin Terzi: active match he stopped you you had a long match with him no but before go we was pushing each other every time boom boom boom boom boom and so you know he was quite he had good endurance but no what happened you pushing is okay but once you get when the mask does and you your arm opens like this i don't know it was quick it was quick yeah
Engin Terzi: yeah so how did you understand that his power was still there good endurance if you are just pressing him in one second it's because you were no I can I can feel uh the power was still same whatever he have in the first round he had been fourth round but I think if if they will have similar power I think Devon will hold more and he will win
Engin Terzi: No, yeah, yeah, this is what I exactly say, you know, if they have close power, only if Vitaly totally takes his wrist like this, and then it is different. I think Lahti can turn his... Yeah, if he takes totally his hand, then it is different, but if they both have like flat wrist, straight wrist, and then I think that
Engin Terzi: yeah i think devon wins but yeah but but you know ms would know better because ms pulled both guys on the right arm yeah on the right hand we pulled both yeah since we're talking about the uh right hand match and then hermes pulled both one second
Engin Terzi: I think this match needs to happen. This match needs to be what? Happen. Yeah, it needs to happen. But right now... It's a very beautiful fight, really, to see. Yeah. And I think Devon wants this fight. But not now. He wants to meet him probably after he's done with this
Engin Terzi: 105, 115. Yeah. And that's interesting. Like Devon pulled super heavy weight when he was 120 kilo. So I don't think the weight is very important. Super important. So what I just said that he can pull super heavy weights sometimes, heavy weights sometimes, light heavy weights sometimes, you know, and, and, and Hermes, do you think that
Engin Terzi: If Devon really goes down to 105 kilos, do you think... Now, what is it? He's 110 kilos right now. But I don't think he's in super strong shape right now, 110 kilos. If he goes 105 kilos, do you think that, like, how do you think it will happen? Because whenever I look at Petrenko, Petrenko looks very strong. Yeah.
Ermes Gasparini: I think with Petrenko, if he will compete, it will be very hard. I don't think he lost a lot of power. But when you are on the limit of your weight and you cut five kilos more, it's a lot. Right now, he's cutting from 120 to 105.
Engin Terzi: 15 kilo and this guy is already, I mean, his body fat percentage probably same as 15 years old young guy, you know, he's just so ripped, you know, and you look at his arms and everything, look at his pronator, his stomach muscles, you know, he doesn't have so much fat. So when he loses 15 kilo, of course, just say five kilo by water, but 10 kilo really good he's losing. Do you think that he will be losing some power?
Ermes Gasparini: He will probably lose. A little bit, yes, for sure. He will lose a lot of power. I think a lot of power. What I mean is to go maybe 120 to 110. Maybe he can still pull good. But maybe 5 kilos more if you are still in your limits.
Engin Terzi: If you are already in your limit, five kilos less, maybe... Justin think about yourself, Hermes. If you make 105, right now you are 120 kilos. 105, do you think that 100% you would beat Petrenko if you lose 15 kilos? You wouldn't trust yourself 100%, right? It would be very hard.
Engin Terzi: It would be hard, right? Because of the muscle. Trust me, all these guys in their categories, they are very strong. You think this guy is 85 kilo. Yes, he's 85 kilo. But you make 85 kilo, then you will realize how strong that guy is. You make 95 kilo, you will see how strong Irakli is.
Engin Terzi: You make 105, you will see how strong Oleg Petrenko is. So it is not that you don't... I also lose weight, but I never stay in the same power. I'm 85 kilos. And then when I make 65 kilos, I think the 65 kilo shape of mine needs to hold me with two hands when I'm 85 kilos. That's just how I feel. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think if we go 105,
Ermes Gasparini: Maybe with a good diet, cut water, etc. It will be very super hard to win. All the best. No, I don't. Kamil needs to go. Kamil needs to go. Thank you, Kamil. Thank you. Kamil, you look really big. You look really big. Your face, everything. No, I am good. Yes, yes, yes.
Engin Terzi: i have only 134 kilos not a lot oh yeah strong oh yeah look at the four but listen listen you're showing us your left arm right before the right arm matches no good i think raymond's came see hey guys oh hello thank you substitution substitution take care guys bye bye thank you for chatting latvian version of community
Engin Terzi: And Raimonds, Hermes saying that you guys did the bench press competition and he beat you and you had to buy him a lunch. Is that true? Not strong with bench press. He's not, right? Maybe I can fool with him. With one arm I will do his best. My man, you will have to buy me food for rest of your life.
Engin Terzi: You cannot bench as much as Raimonds, right? No. More? More? Come on. How much? I think we did, what, 180 kilos? What did you do, Raimonds? 207. 207? Yeah. West. My best. I never show. I need to prove. Next time we do bench press competition. Let's do it.
Engin Terzi: My friend, easy, easy, easy. Winner gets West versus West belt. Winner gets the shot at Levan. Yeah. Pauline is in the chat, by the way. Pauline is just... Oh, Pauline. He's watching us right now. Pauline is a great guy. Raimonds, we were talking about if Devon and...
Engin Terzi: Vitaly pulls and if it's a close match I say that Devon wins if it's a close match and then Hermes says that Vitaly wins if it's a close match yeah yeah I don't I don't see I don't see someone beating Devon without good side pressure without ability he has very good side pressure
Raimonds Liepiņš: not not he far away but you need to be close i think devon devon can do what ermus did i believe devon can do what ermus did he you don't think about skinny devon think about devon when he gets in shape that devon yeah skinny devon yeah of course everybody i could be there roman could beat that right i could beat him if he even if he has two arms i have a question for you i have a question for you ermus do you think that lalatin
Engin Terzi: has very strong side pressure or it is because how strong his hand and how strong his back pressure at the start makes his opponent a little bit weak. And then because of all these advantages at the start, he has advantage to hit sideways effectively.
Engin Terzi: Do you understand my point? Like if I hold you and if I do back pressure, if my hand is stronger and your wrist is already like not strong, then you cannot hit because your wrist will not handle. I remember when I had the control here.
Ermes Gasparini: And he still pushed without a wrist, like this, like crazy. My average was like this every time. Baba, very, very, very close? Or just because you needed back pressure, you were open? He was open. Oh, I was close. And then he pushed five, six times like this. So it means that his side pressure is very strong. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, yeah. And...
Ermes Gasparini: Because if he was strong only in the back pressure, he can't do the same when he fought with Morozov. With Morozov, the first match he did like this. The first match he tried to hook and he hang him and then beat him. You need side pressure too to win. Because maybe only back
Ermes Gasparini: Maybe you can open the wrist of your opponent. Yeah, but if somebody is coming to you and he cannot have the wrist control, he gives up on his pronator and he loses his angle because you took him. Or the second match when he pushed Marzoc sideways. I think Marzoc did a lot of mistakes.
Ermes Gasparini: Yeah, you also need to start with the back pressure, like strong pressure. You can't start before lality. You need to hold immediately maximum power
Engin Terzi: and to stop Laleh. You need to apply pressure before goal. Take something away from his back. That's how you stop Levan. That's how you stop Laleh. But if you try to start together with Laleh, he's going to kill you. But listen, the same thing. You remember one round you just wanted to go to flop with Levan?
Engin Terzi: right away without the back pressure he just killed you you have to do back pressure to slow him down you know the same that i i talked to morozov i said like like how is it that you you you don't you start like together with uh vitale at the same time how can you do that you need to do
Engin Terzi: back pressure, even you lose your wrist. You need to reach your maximum because Morozov is a slow guy. Justin look at his match. Most of the time, he catches people and then he did the same with Dave Chaffee. He did the same with Revalz. Many matches, you know, he did that way. So if you are this slow and then if Laletin is this fast, you cannot just try to start competition with him. You need to give... Because once you reach to your...
Engin Terzi: 70% Larritin will already hit you with 100% with that explosive machine. And I think it's impossible to go on the hook with the Larritin.
Ermes Gasparini: this is a really crazy thing did you try ermis did you try to hook him or you just know because of my boy it's impossible to hook him impossible impossible yeah you feel you i fed like a impossible impossible it's impossible the only way
Engin Terzi: When Levan and Vitaly hooked, it was because I think Vitaly also tried to hook. Levan could not force him in the hook back then. He didn't really try to. If you're talking about their top eight match, it was more like he wanted to go sideways. But since Vitaly is doing like this, he kind of lost this bottom side of his wrist. And then Vitaly hit him this way. And then...
Engin Terzi: level rise up and then beat him and then following rounds he did the same exacting every round yeah exactly
Raimonds Liepiņš: Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's impossible to hook him. Interesting thing is with Levan, almost every single match except the match versus Ermes, he gets stronger by the rounds. He sometimes starts and then he kind of goes stronger. Like with Devon, right? Round two, three, every round he was stronger. With Vitaly, every next round he was stronger. With Ermes, the only thing where it was different.
Raimonds Liepiņš: Can you say again, Raimonds, who was the stronger every round? Like, Levan, he gets stronger every round. Like, he had a slow start with, like, difference between round one and two, round two versus Devon, it's crazy, right? With Vitaly, round one versus round two, and that at the end, he just, like, I don't know. Yeah, only against Hermes, he got slowed down, yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. That's it, then.
Engin Terzi: That's a good point, right? Yeah, yeah. That's the only match that he got. In the past, if you go past, then I see Gennady matches the Gennady house. Gennady, today, what did Gennady tell you about his shape? He's very good, right?
Engin Terzi: Yes. Yes. I just, uh, I talked with him and, uh, he updated me about his shape and he's, he's ready guys. He's, he's ready, but just a little bit. He had that. Yeah. He, he needs to make sure that the shoulder pain goes away and that's why he's on his way to the city where he gets this treatment. And within one week he will know for sure. But outside of that, he told me I'm progressing and he's, he's other things too. The other thing too. Why are you hiding this?
Engin Terzi: other parts uh which one you mean the shoulder no no the thing that he said how he's gonna destroy hermes i didn't want to say because hermes is in the chair when he leaves yeah but come on man we need to we need to be we need to be yeah we need to be saying everything he said
Engin Terzi: Yeah, I told Gennady, like, hey, Engin has some possible opponents, like Hermes, and he said, Hermes, no problem. No problem, Bambino is mine. Hermes, I have a question for you. Listen, you beat Gennady, no, no, but you have all the credit. But what happened the last two rounds?
Engin Terzi: What if Gennady pulls you in the same way next time? The only problem with Gennady is endurance. Listen, not only the endurance. First four rounds, the way he pulled. And the last two rounds, the way he pulled was different. Come on. Yeah, yeah. For the endurance. No. First four rounds, he just pulled his elbow. And you just hit him. And then fifth round, he started hitting you like that. And then your brachialis hurt. And then he beat you.
Engin Terzi: So what if he does, listen, when Devon tried to do that to Gennady, Gennady did the same thing. And so Devon had to pull inside. So what if Gennady does it right away from the round one? Will he not get hurt again? I had pain a lot, I remember, before the match.
Ermes Gasparini: And after the third, fourth round, I remember when I tried to push, I felt pain. If you see the video, you see the moment when I felt a lot of pain. And I remember this.
Engin Terzi: I couldn't go in the last matches, I couldn't go on the side pressure. Because he did something different. So what I'm just trying to tell you, listen, I'm trying to be a little bit provocative, you know, this is what I do, but from other sides. No problem. Yeah. Artem you 100% confident that if he does that thing, it will not be effective against you? No way? Nothing. No way.
Engin Terzi: So, on that note, would you toproll him or would you do the same that you tried against Jerry? I think with him I can do the same last time.
Ermes Gasparini: Because Jerry is different, it's not the same. So you say Jerry's flop is better than Gennady's? No, Gennady is hitting sideways like this. Yeah, like this, like this. But if his opponent has a lot of super strong back pressure, he couldn't. He can't.
Raimonds Liepiņš: Because you feel like you want to do this. I will, I will in my match, I'll top roll one round for you, for you one round.
Engin Terzi: And you will tell on the camera. I will tell on the camera. I'm almost smart like you, Hermes. No, say that. Say that. Uproar is for smart. And Hermes will do this t-shirt. Hermes, show us the t-shirt. Uproar is for smart. Yeah. Yeah. Raimonds, I think
Raimonds Liepiņš: If you don't get upset with me, I think you're underdog. I think you're trying to make Ryan look better than he is. No, no. I think the guy is real deal. I saw him. And he's bigger guy. If he was both 85... Everyone's bigger than me. What? Everyone's bigger than me. Everyone, okay. Roman is three times bigger than me. When we do interviews, he's sitting three meters behind me just so we're even on the camera.
Engin Terzi: That's right. That's correct. Do you really believe you're going to win, Raimonds? I'm going to. I'm going to make a statement. Yeah? Yeah. I don't know. I saw the guy. The guy's wrist is just so strong. I hope. And also, I saw him. He's using his wrist very fast. And then I saw that he has good endurance as well.
Raimonds Liepiņš: We'll see. Like, how do you want me to win? Do you want me to win 3-0, 3-2, lost first two, then I'll come back? Yeah, yeah, do like this. Only Toros lost the first two and the...
Engin Terzi: Come back. Come back. Easy. That would be great. No, no, no, no. Justin win 3-0. Because now if he loses two rounds, he says, I told you already that, you know, I'm going to lose two rounds. I might lose the first one, you know, just for fun. But I feel excellent. Probably the best I have felt in years. I heard that. I heard this kind of stories before. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: I can't wait. He doesn't believe you, Ray. No, no, no. I have similar stories before people as well. So there's memories. I'm not pulling an onion, so I'm happy. I will come back. I'm going to train. I was almost giving up.
Engin Terzi: after the last health problems, because I'm like tired of myself, you know, just saying I start training and then, oh, I got injured. It's better not to say anything. And don't speak too much. Some people ask me, you know, some people ask, how is everything? I will say I'm not training or what? What should I do? No, you say I'm working. I'm training when I want, when I'm free like this.
Engin Terzi: Okay, so what I will do, I will just say, ask my manager, Hermes. Yeah. Engin versus August 2025. I don't know, but maybe, maybe, I don't know, if we didn't misunderstand each other, maybe next month, Dennis may come here. Dennis? Yeah, I think. Like a visit, you mean? Yeah, we have a common friend.
Engin Terzi: and then maybe if i didn't the danish is is healthy now no no he's not ready this year he cannot pull next year probably he can pull but just just maybe for the visit or something you know he he means like with and now uh he's uh going all around the world he's vlogging and then he has a channel so most it would be great content if he visits yeah yeah yeah yeah elmas do you know what i'm thinking imagine this elmas just listen carefully
Engin Terzi: eight best guys you understand and you all are here and you stay in a big house understand and you all will be competing against each other maybe every two weeks and you in the same home you're playing games you talk you chat you watch tv and there are cameras
Engin Terzi: of course like like there are programs here yeah yeah yeah yeah like like should i say reality shows or something like this yeah yeah something yeah and then you all are training and then like eating you know sometimes argue with each other but imagine that 24 hours live on youtube
Raimonds Liepiņš: sometimes you argue if Devon is there they will argue he'll be like which one is my victim today
Engin Terzi: Yeah, but it'll be fun. Yeah, do you imagine in the same house? Yeah, yeah, it would be super funny. Oh, if you put Gennady. Oh, yeah. Gennady and Devon. Raimonds, do you think that Gennady would calm Devon down? That would be funny. I don't know what would happen. It would be some of the best conversations we have ever seen, I think. Would you like to be in the same house with them, Raimonds?
Engin Terzi: I have a life, but okay. I know you have a life, everyone has a life, but this is just... It's dangerous. Yeah, it is dangerous because these guys, all of them are
Raimonds Liepiņš: in their way dangerous guys you know so just leave them in the same house sometimes they are not in good mood you know and then imagine nobody could stop them oh well you know like ufc puts like fighters in a house like train killers right so and it works out most of the time so we should do fine i think we should do fine
Engin Terzi: We are a good guy. But don't you think that it would be fun? There is a good prize money award. All together, full prize money is just say $250,000. And then everyone pulls everyone. Justin say
Engin Terzi: maybe once a week or every 10 days or something, they train and then rest one week or something. I don't know. Maybe they cannot even rest. Imagine that way. Yeah, I think it would be. So whoever, within a specific time period, whoever has most wins would get the prize, right? Yeah, just like a round robin. As much as possible. But if you lose, if you lose, Hermes eats your food.
Engin Terzi: If you lose what? Yeah. If you lose, Hermes will eat your food, so you will be hungry and you will lose more. There is one guy who is asking if there will be cameras in the bathroom. Of course, but that's what we're posting on a different platform. You have to follow us everywhere. We will make members only.
Engin Terzi: No, no, no. Justin imagine that. Only for us? Me and Ray, we will figure something out. Imagine the camera in the kitchen, camera in the living room, TV, camera in the gym, you know. And who makes the food?
Engin Terzi: I mean, listen, every week there will be four supermatches. Wait, wait, four supermatches? The losers will make food for the winners. No, everyone is going to make their own food, probably.
Ermes Gasparini: Everyone has to make for everyone. Like once a week, someone cooks for everyone. That would be good. Loser, I guess. No, no. Maybe put some... Oh. No, no, no. Justin come on. Why are you even imagining such things? Okay. Yeah, because they want to win and they put some bad... So I should cook. You would trust me. But I'm not that good cook. So you just eat every day.
Engin Terzi: omelette toast that's all or already pizza ready pizza ready but ready ready they are all from the frozen yeah from yeah yeah eat okay yeah cereal and you know i cook my own food and you make a bowl of cereal what's what is thunders job
Raimonds Liepiņš: Oh, he's a sports manager. He works like a board manager. Okay. Because somebody like chief said, yeah. It's all this cook's food. It's also cook's food. Oh, okay. Okay. No good food. No good. He tried to do carbonara, but really he needs to learn.
Engin Terzi: You know, imitation is the highest form of flattery. Like he don't know. He don't know how it's, you know. Okay. The plan was so good until Hermes said that somebody would put something in others food. You know, that moment I'm like, I didn't like the idea.
Engin Terzi: Why do you even think this kind of things? It never came to my mind. Hang in, hang in. Hermes is thinking maybe poison or some diarrhea medicine or something. I know. Devon would put something else in your food. So maybe we should have professional cook. Most neutral cook ever. Yeah. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, it wouldn't be good. It wouldn't be good. Yeah, I don't think anybody would do such thing, but Hermes just really poisoned the idea right now. If you put something right now in the idea... Hermes, you just lost $250,000. No, no, that is a total amount of money, not only for the fifth place guy. Devon't tell him. Devon't tell him.
Engin Terzi: Justin say that you're gonna give them every month some money and then at the end you know or just you pay them every two weeks when they win when they lose you understand certain amount of money just say that just say that maybe five thousand winning and three thousand or losing
Engin Terzi: every match what would be what would be now 20 32 000 times seven matches yeah around 250 000 with the expenses together yeah
Raimonds Liepiņš: Yeah. But it's a really good idea. I like that. Something like that we need to do, and then eventually we have a possibility to do it, right? If someone is watching this and you have $250,000 to spare, we'll take it and make something great from it. Trust us. Yeah. But just imagine, even if you win all those seven matches, it is only €35,000 you're going to make in like two and a half months. It's not that huge amount.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, well. We can also do GoFundMe. 500,000. If anyone's watching, you have just laying somewhere around 500,000 euros. Justin think this way. Okay, maybe I miscalculated. Justin say at the end, we calculate the points. The winner takes 60,000. And then second place is 50. What's now? 110. Third place is 40, 150. And then 180,000.
Engin Terzi: And then 200. 200, yeah. After what? After what? 200. 60, 50, 40, 30. Okay, top five. And then 10,000. And the rest of the four guys are 10,000 each. So 240,000. What, Raimonds? It's not good like this. 200. What? Winner takes all.
Engin Terzi: No, too difficult. No, no, no. We need to give everybody some type of money. Okay, let's do that then. We don't stay that long. We do every two weeks. We do first round and then semi-final and then the final. You understand? Not everyone pulls everyone. But then who's going to pull who? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, something like that. I like the idea, the beginning one, so that most guy with the most wins will take one. Yeah, but listen, how are they going to pull seven weeks, you know, seven weeks for seven weeks every week? When are they going to trade?
Engin Terzi: understand so you can do every two weeks just start and then pull and two weeks later again and two weeks later and then it's finished so basically just say in five six weeks everything finished for five six weeks that money is very good money but for like two to three months is not no i think it's if if like if someone could make this thing happen the project what do you mean someone if this happens i'm gonna do it
Engin Terzi: What do you mean someone? No, no, no. If anybody cares. Some investor is coming in and putting it. If somebody sponsors. It could be a Netflix show. It could literally be a Netflix. You put eight of the best armistice on the planet in the same house. Let's say. Okay, just one second. One second. Levan, just say Gennady, Dzeranov, Morozov, and Lattes. Jerry, just say like Swetko.
Engin Terzi: and just just and then someone Devon Devon Devon yeah and then we can we can bring Hermes is it like a if something happens yeah yeah yeah ah yes like if flight get cancelled then Hermes comes yeah like if somebody gets injured or something you you just say
Raimonds Liepiņš: listen something like this if someone could make it happen sell it to netflix it's it's not worth like it's worth millions and people would really watch it and also it will popularize arms yeah actually if it hits netflix be crazy it would be great athletes you pay athletes every week like some kind of salary and then you know you figure out either there's a big price pool at the end
Raimonds Liepiņš: but you get money either way so commitment of staying there for let's say eight weeks is worth your time because you get and if it's something big you don't know how you are gonna do you're gonna do that youtube members only okay it's not gonna work yeah yeah it will work just just made it
Raimonds Liepiņš: twenty twenty twenty dollars you understand of course youtube is gonna take a lot no no different platform different platform then different platform i think something like this would work if someone has a good idea and go to streaming platform and sell it to streaming
Raimonds Liepiņš: They do crazy things. Why wouldn't they do this? And Armisen, it would be great for Armisen. And I would watch it, right? I would sit there. I can wait for next season of Drive or what's it called? F1. F1 on Netflix series. Drive to survive. It's the best. So why not? I would watch Armisen all day. Why Armisen all day? What's wrong with you?
Raimonds Liepiņš: everything is fine that's fine all day or there's a live stream all day and you can tune in and watch it all day live and then and then every match we put it for the members that who
Engin Terzi: Ah, you mean arm wrestling itself? Yeah, yeah, yeah. There's a lot of ideas we can do this. Listen, that's my idea, okay? I would shoot anyone who tries to, you know, you know what I'm talking about. I'm out. Would you be interested in such thing if it is going to end in like five weeks or something?
Raimonds Liepiņš: Yeah, if it's not too much longer, yes. Yeah, like five weeks. It would be interesting, right? Something cool. Yeah. Commitment, but it would be great for everyone, for people involved, for armwrestling. Yeah. Super experience. Right. I don't know how to do the security. Justin curious. I'm afraid of that. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: Listen, it is not like these guys are not easy people. You see each other, hi, how are you, every two months. It's good, but whenever you start living together, who left this glass here? Okay, who used the restroom? Justin go clean there. What kind of animal are you?
Raimonds Liepiņš: for housekeeping we will have some right yeah but you need to just eat also some things that they need to do right because those are the fun things like someone like uh competitions between them that doesn't involve armor sling uh things like this oh my god I want them to just play chess backgammon playstation relax
Engin Terzi: maybe anything you know just i want them to relax you know just oh you again you know just go outside and forth you know yeah yeah yeah it would be it would be it would be fun you know yeah and then we would need some translator and then i i think yeah
Engin Terzi: I mean, probably if Gennady goes there, obviously, he will start non-stop trash talking on Devon. So I got to be there too. You're sleeping in the same room as Gennady. And if you're in the middle of the night, you have to walk with him everywhere. This is the problem.
Engin Terzi: What's that? You don't need to sleep with each other. We will give you separate rooms for everyone. One room for two athletes and it's a bunk bed. It's not a prison cell.
Engin Terzi: I will tell you something a lot of people would follow a lot of people would would get addicted because they do stupid stupid things you know just like with the people we don't even know who they are you know people just really follows them you know and these are just great athletes their trainings and everything you know yeah it would be it would be I think great so well how is it gonna be there will be
Engin Terzi: the the viewers will choose which camera they will be following or like or because there will be many cameras and the athletes will not be all together in the same room all the time you know we have to figure it out how how to yeah yeah yeah but there's a live stream you can tune in and just just see what's going on like just see what's going on right
Engin Terzi: yeah yeah yeah yeah that are streamers they make so much money just from streaming something like that like i mean like i mean it would be good for the promotion of the sport and the athletes i think yeah oh yeah yeah yeah like either they're gonna like athlete or not gonna like it yeah yeah yeah as long as it covers the expenses you don't need to make big money you know as long as the it is good uh achievement you know it would be
Engin Terzi: uh something good for our sport anyway so let's finish and but yeah but it would be it would be good you know if hermes accepts to be uh substitute you know just yeah if somebody gets injured and i'm okay plan b yeah anyways anyways guys hermes
Engin Terzi: My friend, I really hope you fix your shoulder injury and then you'll be back with us. Everyone misses you. I have a lot of messages for this.
Ermes Gasparini: another four, five, four months, three, four months, and it will be okay for sure. Yeah. Did you finally talk with doctor? He said, okay. Yeah. I need to rest, to be calm, not to push too much. It's difficult for my mind, but sometimes you need some rest. Sometimes it's better to do this.
Engin Terzi: because if you hurt too much after this maybe you need to stay to rest maybe two three years to do surgeries better not see people already like the idea about this this thing but yeah it's an incredible idea incredible idea wow yeah yeah but it will take a lot of to you know manage everything
Engin Terzi: yeah yeah yeah the concept itself is amazing yeah concept would work i think it would work and it will like if our mistake is right now here it will be somewhere there yeah yeah yeah there's problems to encounter but we have done crazy things already so of course of course as long as we are united you know we can do anything we want you know we just we just need to everything as long as fair and square to everyone we who are part
Engin Terzi: And then if this happens, I think I would do it together with the king of the table. And then we would just make sure that, you know, it is something great for the athletes. And in five weeks, everyone can also make some good money. I'm talking about athletes. And then, as you said, you know, we would be bringing arm wrestling to the next level because people will be following. But as you said, you know, there needs to be translators for many athletes so that people who watch them
Engin Terzi: They need to understand if they all speak Georgian
Engin Terzi: if it's live stream if somehow it turns out to be like post edited and then launched then we can always add subtitles there without translators but also like if it's live it needs translators to see guys trying to communicate with each other like right when they don't speak the same language it's also it's like somehow we manage if you know if you know a little bit little bit
Engin Terzi: language english then it is it looks very nice you know you're trying to explain something but if you're trying to explain in russian and georgian you understand and the person i i don't know like you just talk to me
Engin Terzi: georgian 10 minutes 15 minutes and then i will have probably blood pressure up you know while trying to understand and i will not understand anything you know and then yeah yeah it's the same you know if i start speaking turkish with you then you say okay maybe enough huh you know as you see it's not working you know yeah yeah anyways guys thank you very much
Raimonds Liepiņš: and for joining you all it was good seeing you all yeah same thing you're looking so much better so much better roman yeah yeah true it's true when you're gonna get back on table my friend come on this is too long it's too long already too long too long too long yeah wait wait and this will come back strong i hope so i really hope so and
Engin Terzi: And then just listen, don't, don't be upset with me when, when Ryan beats you 3-0, just don't say like Engin, you are organizer. How did you do those kinds of predictions? You know, you shouldn't be doing, you know, but just, just like once in a while I do, but what can I do? It's too obvious. I know. I know. Did you do any other predictions for any other match? No. Right. Before I did it. Yeah. I think I did it. Like I did, um,
Engin Terzi: Devon versus Levan, I said 55-45. But what can I do? It is 55-45. I mean, for this card. For this card. You said no prediction. Justin one. I think I said Artem Taranenko has a chance to beat Mindaugas. Of course. And Devon versus Levan, you said for sure Alexander would win. I remember that. Oh, Alexander would win. Yeah, I remember. Alexander was amazing. Yes. Listen, joking aside...
Engin Terzi: alexander which is you know who i'm talking about yeah yeah who am i talking about vladimir majorov vladimir myerov versus uh nur dalet aydarhan and the winner gets the rematch against samusha is a good idea you think
Engin Terzi: because because making someone should beat all the guys you know it doesn't like the guys needs to rest but listen it is not that I don't give him a rest he says that engine I'm ready give me a mask you know I I never I to me he should rest the guy but in the last event he said then you know I want to talk with you he said I want to rest and I said okay the event is November and now he says
Engin Terzi: Oh, if it is November, let me think. Maybe I would be ready again. Justin so it is. Yeah, but we let him in. We let him in my row. Look where it's wrong. Smart, strong, strong. There is a guy. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: Super awesome. And every time we did, me, Samush and Ray, when we did after match interviews and before match interviews, he always says that Vladimir and Udalet and several names he mentioned, they are not too far from him. They are close. And he mentioned that rematch would make sense. But somehow the same guy ends up winning. People suggest me.
Engin Terzi: This guy, that guy, none of those guys could beat Samush. Maybe I know one guy who could finish the winning streak of Samush. No, you are wrong about it. You are wrong about it. No, I think I'm correct, but that guy is taking time, taking his time. No, that guy is just old and has been, you understand? Anyway, so.
Engin Terzi: No need. Hermes will look very serious, my friend. No, I don't understand. Yeah, he thinks that I may have a chance, and I'm telling him that no. Yeah, angry is the guy, man. Angry is the guy. No, you train now when you are free. He's training Roma. Hermes, tell me honestly. My shape when I beat Viorel Dobry. Do you think that shape would have a chance against some ship?
Ermes Gasparini: You remember, you can't miss it. But it's very difficult, very close, very difficult. Because I saw Sapusha now is every time bigger, bigger, bigger. And without the wrist, he can hold every time. I don't know how.
Raimonds Liepiņš: What he did to Sasha was the biggest win of his career, in my opinion. For arm wrestlers, there's no discussion now. That's the number one guy at 85. Before then, he was winning and winning. And we're thinking, maybe this guy could still be... I think he's one of the greats. What he has done is insane. And it feels like he's progressed every single time. It's insane. He's learning a lot.
Engin Terzi: didn't i i think that i think that over pronating against him is a mistake yeah when you when you when you over pronate you are missing his pronator and then when you do over pronation he still has his pronator and he's pressing you you really somehow you need to turn him this way yeah and you need to have some shoulder pressure to you take him here and then you need to go and press him and if he cannot if you do that
Engin Terzi: Like if somehow, you know, Krasovskis would take him here and then come back here, Krasovski's shoulder pressure could finish. But can Krasovski go to that point? Looks very hard. Whenever I see even this qualification where Krasovski took third place,
Engin Terzi: and when i saw that wala just smoked everyone and when i know that samusha beat wala and now samusha is even much better shape than at that time and now then i'm just thinking do you realize that how much how much yes progress and endurance and power every match every match how are you going to reach to that level uh
Engin Terzi: roman is talking about me but do you know how long it will take to come to that pressure power it would take even if i start today having super matches it would probably take me one year to have the same endurance condition yeah yeah yeah it's not that easy you just stop you know when i pull rhinos i didn't train so long and then
Engin Terzi: with fast hits I beat, but then whenever I was stuck, you know, the chest went, it is not that easy to build that pressure. And every match Samusha has, just think about his matches with Vladimir Mairo, just think with Vala, think with Tullier, and then lately Aydar Khan, and then after Aydar Khan now, Sasho, just can you imagine that the power he has to handle all this
Engin Terzi: pressure you know he's even you take his hand to finish him very hard very hard yeah very hard too much okay guys i have to jump out i have to eat it's the same here thank you thank you bye guys thank you
