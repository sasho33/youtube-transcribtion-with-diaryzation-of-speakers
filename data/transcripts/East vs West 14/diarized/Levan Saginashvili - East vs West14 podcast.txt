Engin Terzi: Hello, guys. Hello, Levani. Hello, Todd and all its love childs.
Engin Terzi: Hello guys. Justin had a podcast with Oleg Petrenko and now with Levan. He will join soon.
Engin Terzi: Hello, hello, hello, everyone. Okay, Levan just came.
Engin Terzi: I think I added, but did I not? Yeah, that way, yeah. No, no, the vertical way. This? Yeah.
Engin Terzi: How are you? I am very good. How are you, Levan? Good, good. Thank you. How is training? How is Nick? Everything is good. Everything is good. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: I started training a little bit, but when I train, I feel pain here where I had the surgery. I think a few more days I will not train. I think I started to train kind of too heavy. I think I should train only with four or five kilos. How are you? You start training? Yes, I started. Oh, yeah. You look big. You look big, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So you are together with Irakli?
Engin Terzi: Yes, I'm now at Irakli's house. Yeah. When Skoolboy's brother put the video with Tautiev and Skoolboy and Irakli wrote to me, should I be afraid of this guy? But somebody said that when Skoolboy and Irakli train,
Engin Terzi: Somebody told me that one day before, Schoolboy trained with everybody and Schoolboy was tired when he trained with Irakli. Maybe, maybe, yeah. What do you think about this match? Do you think Irakli will win for sure? With Tauter? Yeah. Yeah, I think yes. Irakli is very strong.
Levan Saginashvili: Yes, now he's... I don't know. In 95, I think no one can beat him. In 105 kilos, maybe somebody can do a good match with him. But in 95, no chance, nobody.
Levan Saginashvili: Do you think that maybe Tautiev is very tall, maybe problem stylistically or not? Yes, he has very good hand, but power, Irakli has now very big power. I think if Irakli give him wrist, he can beat him.
Engin Terzi: Yes, yes, yeah. Oh, okay. So you are saying that even if he cannot top roll him, he would win like this? Yes, but we have like two months, yes? Two months. No, three months. Yeah, two months and maybe five days or something. Oh, one month, yeah, exactly, yeah. Both our guys, very young guys, they can in two months,
Levan Saginashvili: take very good shapes. I think it is, who better training these two months, he has biggest chance. Yeah. Okay. Very, very big interest for this match. I have very big interest. I understand. Yeah. But you are saying that in 105,
Levan Saginashvili: um iraqi can still become number one possible yeah yes he can um i i want to see his match with petrenko and uh edwin with devon it is it is very great iranian devon
Engin Terzi: But I think that even I know Iraq is very strong,
Engin Terzi: I don't think I will set Irakli for a world title match in 105 because he lost Tatachins, he lost Ongarbev, he lost Dadikian. I know maybe he's strong now, but he needs to get some revenge. He needs two wins. Yes, yes. Maybe not directly Petrenko, but he needs to beat one or two guys more in this category. He already beat Evgeny Prudnik.
Levan Saginashvili: I think he needs to match with Todd Hutchings. But Todd Hutchings, if I organize, he will be 95 kilos. Yeah. 95 kilos. 105 kilos is very interesting. Now, if Devon comes to this category, yeah, it is very interesting. Before you...
Engin Terzi: uh i had a podcast with petrenko and i talked with petrenko petrenko was a little bit aggressive when he pulled with daddy can normally petrenko is very calm but this time he was doing this did you realize that yeah yeah i like his uh um i would say his uh new new uh
Levan Saginashvili: new behavior new new petrenko yeah yeah normally he's very polite very calm this time he was just like fighting back you know i'm not talking about arm wrestling but we we talked i talked with petrenko before much and i say to he need to be like like this more aggressive more uh because
Engin Terzi: He has very big potential. He can progress more and more. And today I asked him, you know, he talked about, I said, why it was like this? He said, Dadik Ryan is like a student of Denis. And he said, I am a student of Pushkar.
Levan Saginashvili: And Denis and Pushkar, they had a competition. So now the Pushkar students versus Denis' students. Yes. In press conference, Devon asked both of guys this question. They are students. That again is Cypliko student and Oleg is Pushkar student. And it has been very, very good question.
Levan Saginashvili: I did not remember before these facts, you know. Yeah. And they ask, oh, this is very good. They won't ask this way? They won't ask this question? Yeah, yeah. Okay, okay. It is a good history for much, you know. Yeah. GB19 is asking, Levan, you prefer Hermes or the winner of Jerry Alex?
Engin Terzi: I can add this also, also Laletin. These are possible opponents, right? Yeah, Jerry, Alex, Laletin, and Hermes. Hermes, yeah. Do you think Dzharanov has a chance to beat any of these four people? Yes, of course, because he's...
Levan Saginashvili: He's very strong now. He has very good shape, much like Rewaz. He's looking very, very good. He's a very good guy and I hope he can... Reach the top? Like to more higher levels? Yes. There is another question.
Engin Terzi: All hail the king, incredibly respectful, humble, and legendary champion for the sport. He says about you. Thank you very much. Yeah, what was I going to ask you? Yeah, he also said, Petrenko also said that he didn't like when Devon beat Pushkar that, like,
Engin Terzi: Devon, when he has the control, he doesn't finish quickly. He said that Dadikyan match was about Pushkar and Dennis. If he pulls against Devon, he will have also a little bit of that revenge about Devon versus Pushkar match. He thinks that he's going to win.
Engin Terzi: This match, he said that he needs to win quick. This is what he said. And, yeah, I don't know which opponent Devon will choose because I don't know if he's going to pull 115 or 105. Or it would be better if they pull 110 kilos and put both titles on the table. But I think Petrenko didn't like that idea. Petrenko, I think, wants his opponent to be 105 kilos.
Engin Terzi: if there is a title match. For me, I'm very interested to see Devon in 105. Do you think that Devon can be... How strong can he be?
Levan Saginashvili: Because he's very tall guy, very tall guy. He can fast loss like five kilo. Lars time when I see him in Istanbul, he's been 110. Yes. And he can fast loss weight like five kilo and after this five kilo grow. So he can be 110 again. Yeah.
Levan Saginashvili: Do you think right now, do you see some of his practice videos, do you think right now he's very strong or he lost some power? I practiced with him in Istanbul and he's very strong. He's very strong or you are also a little bit out of shape? No, no, he's very strong. He's very strong and in his position he's very strong.
Engin Terzi: But whenever I see you practicing with the Georgian guys, you also didn't look like you are in good shape. Yes, I am not in good shape. This is what I am saying, that when you say he is very strong, but your level also looks very... because you don't train at all? Yes.
Levan Saginashvili: uh for me it is be surprised because i when i started practice with him um i think he's lost too much weight and maybe he's not strong now and it is well in very good shape i understand
Engin Terzi: I mean, I'm not sure if he's in very good shape, but I'm 100% sure that he will be stronger when he has a match. He will prepare. I don't think he will be in the shape that he is right now. I think he will get stronger. Because I have seen his some other practices with other people, and he didn't seem so good. But again, you know, if he decides to pull against Petrenko, he still has two months
Levan Saginashvili: and I think he will be in the chair. How about your wrist? Good, good. Good? Better than before you think it will be? Yes, yes, yes. When I was training for Devon, I felt a little bit of pain, but now I started training and I feel better.
Engin Terzi: I don't feel pain. When you say that you pulled Devon, are you talking about the supermatch or are you talking about training? Training, training. Oh, when you trained with him, you still felt a little bit pain? Yeah, yeah. Now I can say that. Yeah, but be careful. You also have another supermatch. Yeah, man. Yeah. There is a question. Team Freaky is asking, Levan,
Engin Terzi: If you could pick the first pro-armwrestling match for Brian Shaw, who would it be and why? If you would find an opponent for Brian Shaw, his first match, who do you think that person should be? I. For the first match? Yes. I think first match we need to do with me because if we do some
Levan Saginashvili: Other guys, other arm wrestlers, I think after this, interest in people is very, very, very down. And I think we need to, if Brian need to pull, I think he need to pull
Levan Saginashvili: with me, not other guys, you know. Because if we see him with other, some not big level armwrestler, we see he not can pull and after we not have interest to pull with me.
Engin Terzi: So you are saying that he would pull someone and he would lose. He would lose motivation, so he should pull. But why would he pull you if you think that he will lose to someone else? I think it would be a good show. Oh, for sure. Okay, okay, I understand. Yeah. I see many, many good athletes, not arm wrestlers.
Levan Saginashvili: They like armwrestling and it is very good. I thank them for this. But they think armwrestling is a very easy sport. Dating is easy, but it's not. Yeah, they think what is armwrestling, you know, table and
Levan Saginashvili: going there. But when they are starting to train and pull after this, everyone understand this is not easy sport. Now I think Brian think it is very easy sport.
Engin Terzi: You think that way? You think it's easy? Because I talked with him probably two weeks ago or 10 days ago. They called me, you know, Derek Smith. Derek Smith and Brian Shaw, they called me, video chat with it, we talked. And I see that Brian is a very smart guy and he understands it's not easy. But you also need to accept the fact that
Engin Terzi: This guy is a strong guy. If he really trains for like three years, he may be dangerous because he has strong grip. He has strong body pressure. He has the raw power. You know, he has that. Maybe if he learns how to control the power, maybe he can be dangerous. Maybe not for you, but he can do some damage to some other people. If he can train three years and not stop, maybe.
Levan Saginashvili: But train three years and not stop. In arm wrestling, it is too hard. We have some guys who try arm wrestling. We know Larry Wills. We know Kirill Sarichev.
Levan Saginashvili: and other guys. I know when they start this, they think it is very easy, but now I think they change their minds. I mean, they need to focus on one thing. It is not possible to be like
Engin Terzi: I mean, it's not possible to be this level of athlete in two different sports, you know, when you are... Yeah, if Brian go in arm wrestling, he cannot stay in his sport, strongman. But he's not competing strongman, I think. But he can still train, but he can train for arm wrestling. If he train arm wrestling and...
Levan Saginashvili: a little bit armwrestling and no no he doesn't know yeah his sport he cannot chance but if he go 100 in armwrestling yeah three years possible yeah three years
Levan Saginashvili: 100% for arm wrestling. And then if he pulls you, he would just hold you, look at your face and smile and do this to you, Levan. But I wish him good luck. I wish him good luck. I'll wait for him. No problem. For me, for us, for arm wrestling,
Levan Saginashvili: He would be good, right? His interest in armwrestling is very good. I think it is very good. And if you can invite Brian Shaw maybe in Istanbul, it would be great to see him. Yes, yes, yes. I invited him to Orlando, but he has his show, Brian Shaw Classic.
Engin Terzi: so he's busy with that so he couldn't come but i don't know i see him serious and i see him he's smart guy yeah but time will show do you know magnus samuelson yes yes i know yeah i i competed the waffles together with him in 1994 he competed 110 kilo and i think he he started to have some interest in arm wrestling again and
Engin Terzi: I think it would be good if Brian Shaw and Magnus, if they compete as two ex, I should say, power lifters, strongman competitor. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, so let's talk about it. This is the, we finished first 15 minutes. We are not going to do it very long. We will do shorter than usual.
Engin Terzi: Zeus, thank you very much, my friend. Okay, let's talk about the Orlando event. Did you see the matches? Did you see the matches list? All matches, no. All matches list. Okay, so maybe I ask you the ones that maybe I'm guessing that you would know
Engin Terzi: both guys but like Rustam Babaiev and Pauline they will pull 95 kilo category and it will be a revenge match if you remember Rustam Babaiev got injured in the first one yes yes yes yeah yeah and so what do you think this match will happen Pauline Pauline look very good against Lachlan at the king of the table
Levan Saginashvili: and how do you see how do you see this match um i think favorite is uh pauline in much this much some pause after injury he has much with iraq but
Levan Saginashvili: I don't see a real papyri in this match. But do you think he cannot come back? Because he did better against Irakli than Paul did against Irakli. I didn't talk with him after this match with Irakli.
Levan Saginashvili: I don't know how he's in good shape, but I know he's a very professional guy. If he says he can pull, I think it is true. Many athletes say, yes, yes, I can pull.
Levan Saginashvili: We see in tournament they coming not in good shape, but it is not for Papayev. If Papayev says he's ready, he's ready. How is your talk maybe with him and what does he say, he's 100% ready? Yeah, he said that whenever I did the podcast, YouTube podcast with Paul and Rustam,
Engin Terzi: Rustam said that he is as good as he has ever been, and he says he is very confident. But, you know, you can be very good, but your opponent may be better than you. So you never know. But I think that Rustam had one loss against Paul, and then his second match he lost against Irakli. So I don't think that he is coming to Orlando without a good shape, you know, because he cannot afford to lose three times in a row.
Engin Terzi: And from the other side, Pauline, everyone is getting better. And they both have very good starts, very good start offensive. And we will see. I don't think that the first match, Pauline tried to go out two times and he lost easily. But the third time he went inside, then Rustam got injured. So I think this time Paul will go directly inside, my opinion. And then we will see.
Engin Terzi: Paul, in the last one year, he has very good progress. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Paul is a very professional guy. One of the reasons that my intention about these organizations to bring the North Aymeric to here, to the West, and because of this experience, you know, Levan, how rough
Engin Terzi: worlds, how Europeans, how tough every Europeans, every wealth, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Russia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Turkey, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Latvia. They, you know how hard it is to event and every event we compete, we learn more. We go home. We do the homework study. We come back again. We again, fight, fight, fight, fight. So that is why this competition level difficulty made the east side of the world.
Engin Terzi: very, very strong. So my intention is to bring the Aymeric here. Now we bring the West guys to Aymeric. So when the Aymeric also get into this competition, they will also go better and better, you know. And it is good because every time Aymeric guys coming here and it is too hard to fly
Levan Saginashvili: What do you think about Prudnik versus Todd Hutchings? Oh, last time Prudnik won Todd very easy. Yes, I remember.
Engin Terzi: What is that? What did you say? Lars time Prudnik win, Tocila very easy. Yes, I remember. Yes, he was very easy, but it was exactly two years ago. And then his next match, he pulled Devon and he got injured. And after that, he didn't pull for more than one and a half year with right arm. And his Irakli match was his first match. After Devon match with right arm, it was the first match. Left arm, he pulled Dadikyan and Ali Can.
Levan Saginashvili: But the right arm Irakli match was the first match after, I can say, 20 months, almost. I think Prudnik can win because he knows how he needs to pull with Totsila. Prudnik is very smart.
Levan Saginashvili: I understand. Okay, let's go another match. Dave Chaffee, Frank Lampirelli. Oh, Dave Chaffee is back? That is good news. Yeah. That is very good news. I love Frank. He's my friend. Very good guy, but I think Dave too much for him.
Levan Saginashvili: I think they will win. Because of so much pressure, side pressure? Yes, and he takes a long break. And I think if he tries that time, when he takes a break, I think they will be in very good shape.
Engin Terzi: His last match was in February, six months ago. And it was five and a half months ago against La Latin. And right now, there is also something when Dave now loses his wrist, he started to press this way as well. And I think that even if Frank takes his wrist, it will still be not easy to... I think Frank... Cannot take the wrist? Yeah, no.
Engin Terzi: I don't know, I don't think. Oh, okay. Yeah. Okay. Okay. He's asking, who is the strongest opponent for you? Now? Now I... Valetin is very good shape. Now with...
Levan Saginashvili: What do you think about the Lalecen vs. Morozov match? Did you expect it to be that easy? I say in the press conference how I see this match and everything what I say. How we say.
Levan Saginashvili: What I say to how I see this match, everything going like this. But La Lettine win too much easy for me. I know I say La Lettine will win fast, but... Not like this, huh? Not like this, yes, because... I will tell you something, Levan. We know that La Lettine has very strong hands and he is very...
Engin Terzi: very explosive. I saw when Morozov started the match, he did not apply back pressure, back pressure. You need to, against Lareddin, you really need to do so much back pressure before the goal so you can stop him. He started from like zero. And Morozov is not a fast guy. When did you see Morozov beating people like this? Morozov catch people and then win, you understand?
Engin Terzi: even with matushenko who was lighter he catch him with kurdecha he catch him with revas he catch him with dave chef he catch him he only beat some guys like like derek simit you know fast but morozov is not fast guy so you cannot just you cannot just start like lose and then attack against uh
Engin Terzi: someone like laletin he needed to he needed to apply back pressure so that maybe when laletin goes pad maybe he would lose you saw how how ermes started with laletin he started with so much back pressure and then when laletin went there he stopped him but if you just like start with the speed with laletin he will just finish yeah and this is this is exactly what happened you know anyway so
Levan Saginashvili: That is why I think he made a mistake. I told Morozov as well, like, how can you just do... One moment, one moment, one round. I see Laletin not starting. Morozov go inside and Laletin win him very easy.
Engin Terzi: It's very hard to hook, very hard to hook. I remember when you pull against him, you wanted to go sideways, and then because he pulls like this, and then your wrist went a little bit like this, and then here you went high and then beat him. And then after that, you didn't go this way. Every round you went rise and pin him.
Engin Terzi: So I think that is the way to beat Laletin. If you try to control him like this, he will take your wrist. I'm not talking about you, but for anyone, it's very hard to control Laletin with the wrist. Laletin's finger is very strong and he has a very long hand. He's very fast. He has very good technique. He's a very dangerous guy.
Engin Terzi: Yeah. Did you, did you see whenever I asked him in the last West Versailles, I asked him like, do you have a goal to beat Laletin? He said, this is why I live for. That's what I live for. He said that his all dream, everything is to beat you. So he didn't stop, you know,
Levan Saginashvili: having that goal. So I think that match at some point will happen again, you versus him. Yeah, I think it is happen 100% because many good athletes in a superweight category, but I think Laletin has biggest potential. Yes. Yeah. I was going to ask you,
Engin Terzi: Like, I don't want to ask this question to you, but I will ask. Yeah, yeah. I know maybe I shouldn't ask, but what if end of this year, you pull against Laletin and you said that you, when you train with Devon in June, you felt a little bit pain on your wrist and you're talking about
Engin Terzi: Devon, no preparation. Devon, 110 kilos. Nothing close to Laletin. Do you think you will be ready for December? Like, are you confident? Because your wrist, will it be 100% ready? Because the opponent that you are pulling probably will hit your wrist harder than anyone else.
Levan Saginashvili: Yeah, no, it is... If I pull with... La Lettine, La Lettine not change anything. You know, he go, of course, top roll. He not going. Yeah, yeah, I know, I know. But that's where you have the problem right now. That's why I'm asking. Maybe he thinking I have a problem and wrist and so, and he...
Levan Saginashvili: hope for my wrist is weaker, but when much starting, he be in a little bit shock. Say again, say again. What did you say? When much starting, he be in a little bit shock. Shock? Yeah, shock, because feel some not human strong.
Engin Terzi: oh so you are you are saying that you are saying that he you will be even stronger than last time yeah yeah uh-huh yeah i have iraqli for preparation
Levan Saginashvili: I understand, but you think Irakli is enough to give you the same pressure that Laletin will give you? I think like this moving, this moving. I think Irakli has maybe same, maybe more for Vitaly.
Levan Saginashvili: Yeah, but that is not only about how much pressure you hit, but how much your hand and also where you hide. For this, I have some, I know how preparation. Okay, okay, I understand. I'm not trying to teach you. Of course, of course. When last time I pull with Ali, when we have a final, everybody say,
Levan Saginashvili: to pull Vitaly top roll and win Vitaly top roll. It is not, you know, it is impossible. Impossible to top roll Vitaly. And I say I win Vitaly top roll technique and everyone, oh, it is impossible. And I did it.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, but Levan, I don't know who said this, but it is not really true. I mean, when you see Laletin losing match, usually he loses here, not hook. Like, you don't see people hooking Laletin, like, very seldom. But whenever somebody beats Laletin, usually they are beating because he keeps his hand like this, not like this. But, yeah, so even Hermes, you know.
Engin Terzi: with the outside move. Yeah, I mean, I see you very confident because, but I will tell you something, you were very confident before Devon match as well about your wrist. But after the event, you said maybe your wrist wasn't 100%. So how will we know, how the fans will know that you are not faking again? We know, we see in December. December.
Engin Terzi: Okay. Okay. Yeah. Okay. So we have seven more minutes and then, and then we can finish it. So, um, so, okay. So you are saying that you are saying that you are ready for lulling. I talked with Hermes, Hermes has some shoulder issues. I think, yeah, I don't think he is ready for you this year. Uh, but we will see, we will see. And,
Engin Terzi: What about Jerry and Alex? We will see. Who is my next opponent, Engin? We don't know. Justin come on. Give me someone, give me. No, no, you will have someone for sure. You will have someone. Justin remember, this match is King of the Table match. So that is something that King of the Table will do the final decision.
Engin Terzi: and there will be some other great matches. I just can't wait. You are the king. Okay, another thing. Left arm. Still training or you gave up? I think if I start in preparation, for me it's better to pull.
Levan Saginashvili: Right arm. Now, not left arm. Because I don't believe my left arm. One round, I believe I can pull, but four rounds. Okay. So what's happening? What's happening? More you pull, more you pain? Or what's happening? I'm not, after my injury, left arm.
Engin Terzi: I have not power in fingers. Yeah. I see that. I see that. Yeah. Yeah. And you don't want to, you don't want to start something if you doubt yourself, if you don't think you can be best. Yeah. What I do in, in right arm finger signing. Yeah. What I can in left arm only hold. Only hold. Yeah. In right arm I do like,
Engin Terzi: 25 rep. Oh, 25. Yeah, it's a very big difference. And left arm is not improving, huh? It's not getting better? No. Okay, okay. Listen, Levan, as an organizer and armwrestling fan, I would love you to come with left arm too. But if it is not getting better, don't pull, my friend, don't pull. Because, I mean, why would you do that? I'm not sure I can, and...
Levan Saginashvili: If I start in preparation, for me better pull with right arm. Right arm now, not left arm. And you don't want to divide your focus to right and left. You want to focus only one thing. And if I lose in left arm, everybody say Lewandowski lost. They not...
Engin Terzi: Say left arm, right arm. You should pull only if you are ready. The same with Ermes. Ermes, after Ali Can match, he said, no more left arm. Yeah, yeah. I have a question, another question before we finish. You pull against Devon. The Devon that you pull, what do you think about Laletin? Would be a good match?
Engin Terzi: With Devon. Devon and Lalesin. Yeah, yeah. I think it will be a very good match, but I think Devon will win this match. Devon will win. Okay. So you are basically saying that I am Levan Saginasvili, the strongest man on the earth, and after me, the second is Devon. This is what you are saying? Yeah. Because he already beat Hermes. Until Hermes beats him,
Engin Terzi: Right now, Devon proved that he is the best. I mean, better, sorry, I should say. And you are saying that he would beat Laletin as well. So in your opinion, you are number one and number two is Devon. Yeah, because Devon wins Hermes and Hermes wins Laletin. Do you think that Hermes, after losing to Devon,
Engin Terzi: he focused a lot here and here and maybe he got some better in next three months and against I think three and a half months against Laletin do you think that Hermes in the same shape he pulled Devon he could beat Laletin I don't know Laletin match I think
Engin Terzi: Hermes trained these areas very good. I'm not saying he would beat Devon. Yeah, but he hold Lalletin with not wrist, you know, he hold this arm, you know. Yeah, but with Devon he lost everything. With Lalletin, he lost here, but he still had this, he made also Lalletin stand like this.
Levan Saginashvili: Devon is like anaconda, you know, he's... He catches you and then... Slowly, slowly kill you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Slowly, slowly. Yeah, so I realized one thing that you have huge respect for Devon.
Engin Terzi: And I realized that when people talk about your match with Devon, like they talk like Devon is weak or this or something. But whenever I talk with you, you say very positive things about Devon's power, his arm wrestling abilities. So I really hope that, you know, people who may not like Devon
Levan Saginashvili: also understand that Devon is very dangerous and very strong. For me, when I beat him in King of the Table and what he did after this, I've been in shock. He lost only with Gennady in a very close fight. He beat everyone. He's incredible.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, he's very strong. Maybe in the future we have one more match with Devon. Yeah, anything possible. I'm telling you, my opinion, to pull you this way, like maybe more like this way is...
Engin Terzi: better than this way. My opinion, the way that, you know, like somebody needs to really control you here. Not only pulling your hand may not be just a little bit here and this way, my opinion. And people in the comment section, they write about how about Gennady. Do you think that if Gennady comes back really strong, still he and Devon, he could go either way?
Levan Saginashvili: I don't know. We need to see him with somebody. Talking about Gennady? Yeah. Maybe not top guy, very top guy. Because he's just come back from injury. Yes, because he has very big injury and he had surgery, you know.
Levan Saginashvili: I think, yes, we can. We need to see his match and after maybe we can. Ah, okay, yeah. But we shouldn't give directly Gennady a big match, right? We need to do some... But I know Gennady. Gennady is super strong and super, super, superman, you know? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. He can pull in...
Levan Saginashvili: Any position? Any position, yes. He's incredible. What do you think? Who can he pull? I'm thinking already. I'm thinking. I'm already thinking who can be. Anyone in top 10 is maybe too much for start.
Engin Terzi: I say Morozov, but Morozov, Gennady cannot do what Laletin do. So Morozov will have inside and bicep, bicep where he had the injury. Di Zerano is also very strong. If Gennady is super healthy, super top form, good matches. But if Gennady is first match and then those guys also go inside with the bicep, I'm not 100% sure.
Engin Terzi: And I don't know who. I need to talk. I need to talk with Gennady and understand where his level is and what is his psychology. If he is afraid, then it's no good to push him to do tough match. Also, we don't want Gennady to injure himself again and finish. Because Gennady is very important guy. Because Gennady at the table is very strong.
Engin Terzi: can pull in many different ways. Also, his personality. Armwrestling needs his personality. The crazy guy, Opana, you know. If Gennady is gone, it's very bad for armwrestling. Very bad. Yeah. So, we will see. We will see how it will be. I need to do all the matchups. I'm finalizing. And then we will see. Anyways, Levan, I don't want to...
Engin Terzi: You know what? If I show you my board, because I write right now, it says Gennady versus Michael Todd, but I put a question mark. But only if Michael beats Kamil. Do you think Michael will beat Kamil?
Engin Terzi: Oh, I don't know. Good match, huh? Dangerous match. Crazy, crazy guy. Yeah. Hey, we didn't talk about some of the matches. How about Jerry versus Kurdecha? Who is winning? Jerry. Jerry is winning? Wow. A lot of people are thinking that Alex will win easy. No, no. No. I think...
Levan Saginashvili: and uh it is this much is in uh usa it is different psychologically or because of the time difference time different psychology everything support the people we are too many his supporters here fans here and
Levan Saginashvili: And for Jerry, I think, for Jerry, Kurdecha is a good opponent. If Jerry stops this match, he wins one in the process. I think he stops this match. I understand. And do you think John can beat Leonidas?
Levan Saginashvili: Oh, for me, it is very interesting. I like Leonidas. He's a very good athlete. He's not an arm wrestler, but he pulls very good. And for me, it's a big surprise. We have many, many guys, not arm wrestlers, but very strong, but they cannot pull. But this guy can.
Levan Saginashvili: He started to become more and more armoured. Yes. In power, I think Leonidas has more power. But it is John, you know, I think John can found him some moving
Engin Terzi: with him and I think John win but it is be not not easy oh okay okay because when John is motivated and less pain he can do the way that he beat Alex Voivoda I was it was very very interesting yeah and yeah and and how about the next event Ivan Matushenko and Alican Murado oh um
Levan Saginashvili: I think Alijan is my favorite. He will win this match. Ivan has good technique. He's very fast, but in power, Alijan is a monster. I think Alijan can catch him here and win.
Engin Terzi: Yeah. Matushenko also, his wrist is really isolating the, you know, the pronator so good. And his hand is very fast. I have very big interest to match Matushenko and Irakli. Right now, right? Yes, right now. In the future. Yeah, yeah. Let's do that. Let's do that. Yeah. Yeah. How about that one? Yeah. Maybe not the next event because he's going to pull Tautiev.
Engin Terzi: Because it is very, very hard to hook Irakli and it is very, very hard to top roll Matushenko. But Irakli sometimes doesn't win. He doesn't need to top roll. He goes like this and he doesn't really take the hand. He just controls the pronator and wins like this. So I think it will be a very good match. The only problem for Irakli, Ivan is very fast.
Levan Saginashvili: Some hook pullers, they go like this, and Irakli takes. But Ivan goes this way. Yes, I know. He beat me in 2030 when I pulled 110 kilos in the world championship. Yeah, but it was your very beginning years, and he was already pulling for 10 years, you know, yeah. Yeah, but she's very fast. I'm very shocked, you know. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Levan Saginashvili: What happened? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Anyways, Lewand, you are a very humble guy. You are a very likeable champion. And trust me, everyone loves you. I'm very happy to see you in good condition. Thank you, thank you, thank you, Lewand. I love... Go ahead. And I need to say I'm very sad to have lost a very good guy, an Italian guy.
Levan Saginashvili: Yeah, I'm also very sad. For me, he's a hero. We talked in Istanbul last event. Oh, you talked with him? Yes, yes. We planned to come to Italy in Turin on the UNTUS match.
Engin Terzi: He said he can help me to buy tickets. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And after this happened, I already settled. Italian Federation just invited me to Italy end of this year for a tournament. And I will bring him the world champion West versus West world champion title. And I'm telling you, I mean, you can be world champion in any sport you want.
Engin Terzi: but this this guy while he was trying to save somebody's life it is that is as you said he's a hero hero you know anyone who is risking his own life to save a life you know it is if you want world champion here what he did is right here yeah yes anyways yeah yeah it's good that you you open the subject yeah it is really emotional emotional like a few days i try to control like and then
Engin Terzi: like two days later, three days later, I was like, I couldn't handle myself. I started crying, you know, because I mean, I'm like trying to focus my job, but it is bothering me inside of me, bothering me, bothering me. And I was like, you know, just like, because it is not something that you can ignore, you know? Yeah. Anyways, Levan, yeah, there are,
Engin Terzi: Devon versus Irakli, 105 kilo, Adrian says. And Adrian also sent another support. Yeah, those matches will happen, guys. Justin all I want from you guys, please support the event. We started something. Devon, can you believe that in less than three years, almost 200 supermatches. It's not that easy. You say 200, it is easy to say.
Engin Terzi: But to organize, to buy their tickets and then match-ups, you know, all those things, very, very hard, you know. 200, yeah, I'm not saying I did by myself. I did with the support of you athletes. You guys are superstars. For people, Ronaldo Messi, for me, you guys are superstars. And we did, and these fans supported us. Sponsors, they supported us. So we started something. It is very good that now we have the rankings. We know who are the best guys.
Engin Terzi: And that's why I'm asking to the fans, you know, if you want this dream to continue, to bring armwrestling to the next level, continue supporting us. And yeah, hopefully we will see armwrestling
Engin Terzi: better places. Levan, we passed 40 minutes. Sorry about it. I know you need to go. Right now you are in Irakli's home. You need to go to your place. Thank you very much for coming. Thank you. Levan, thank you very much, my friend. Stay healthy. Heal the wrist. And then next war, December, we will see who will be your opponent. Come in Dubai. To your match?
Engin Terzi: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It would be great. Also, yeah, so listen, you and Irakli, I know you guys are very close. Anytime, you know, my home is just 500 meters from the sea, still summer. If you want to come, you know, just everything I can cover, just let me know. You understand? Yeah, yeah.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, you take care of yourself, Levan, and thanks to everyone who has been watching us. Yeah, take care of yourself and tell Iraqis I said hello. Yeah, take care.
