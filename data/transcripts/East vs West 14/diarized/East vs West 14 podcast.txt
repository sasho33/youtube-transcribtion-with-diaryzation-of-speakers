Unknown: Hello guys.
Engin Terzi: I'll be back with you after I share the link a few times in the groups, and yeah. How are you guys doing?
Engin Terzi: Okay, guys. Let me see here. Hello, Adnan. Hello, Randy. Nice to see you as well, Adnan. This year, they will have matches.
Engin Terzi: Uh, no guest. I just wanted to chat with you guys. Hello, hello, my friends. Hello, Peter. Thank you. I hope you are well as well. We don't know. Morozov's left is injured. Let's see how it will be. Yeah, I'm doing better, my friends. PC Factor. Um, Kuisko. Hello, hello, hello. One second, guys.
Engin Terzi: How are you? Thank you, my friend. Yeah, thank you, my friend. I feel better.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, yeah. I'm sure you will enjoy Orlando events. Yeah. And yeah, the health is better. I have been training. Levan Hermes probably will be happening. Alaykum salam.
Engin Terzi: Artem you healing well again? Yes. I started training 50-60%. I started training. I mean, I always start training and something happens and I just quit again and start again. I'm just thinking, should I just quit trying?
Engin Terzi: I'm 50 years old, so, I mean, if I can't do right now, later, even if I want, I won't be able to do it, so better continue trying. Hello, Victor. King . Thank you, my friend. I hope you are well as well. I mean, Morozo, you know, he needs to be active.
Engin Terzi: for one year, you know, I mean, inactive. Then we can take it, just pull only on June 1st against Ivan Matushenko. Simone Battaglia, hello Engin, good to hear you're feeling better. Thank you, my friend.
Engin Terzi: Whitehead. Engin, why don't you invite Tim Bresnan to West versus West yet? Bresnan versus Beth would be a very good match. I wish you a quick recovery. Greetings from Germany. Thank you very much, my friend. Thank you. Hopefully at some point. Oh, kids are playing here. They are very loud. Marvin Short, what's your opinion on Alex? If he can beat Jerry Dutting, Alex would be a good opponent.
Engin Terzi: for emmy emmy i don't know who is emmy but um best wishes to you and i hope you feel better do you think that next generation of our masters will be better than the current stars time will show i think that
Engin Terzi: Generally, I don't think that arm wrestling has ever, ever been at this level, about the difficulty level. The West versus West and the King of the Table, it just...
Engin Terzi: started something like a really tough competition and they are i don't know every event just whenever i look at them like i'm like wow you know it's like very very dangerous i think last night i think there was a podcast i think uh rob vision jr
Engin Terzi: uh douglas pauline and ray coach ray and then neil pickup wrote a comment he said east versus west level is just like jurassic park you know and yeah that that is what it is you know ryan bowen ultra pro plus you look better and healthy thank you thank you my friends
Engin Terzi: I never quit. Everything comes from the mind. If you think like that, if you like that, yeah, but we need to accept the fact that we get older. What do you think about Ali Can versus the Zerano left hand? I think the Zerano is the only man who can stop Ali Can inside. That is possible, but last time I heard they were training, the Zerano with right and Ali Can with left,
Engin Terzi: Look, dominance. Emiliano, thank you, Engin, for your work. Thank you for your support, my friend. I'm telling you again, as long as you guys support me, I will continue serving the community. Once you guys say that we don't support you, you know, and then that is the moment that I will just say, okay, thank you guys for everything.
Engin Terzi: Vasily. Good evening, Engin. Good evening, Vasily. Amish. I think he meant Hermes. Yeah, maybe. We will see. We will see. There are so many matches. Today, I just put the boards in front of me with the marker, and then I started to do some imaginary match-ups, and there are a lot, a lot, a lot, because new guys also come, you know.
Engin Terzi: a lot of matchup possibilities. Devon versus Alijan, left arm, uh-uh. Devon would get destroyed instantly. Ryan, who said, this is his sleep. Paul Strang, West versus West, 14 is going to be great. Thank you, Engin. Paul Strang says, thank you, my friend.
Engin Terzi: Any plans for Alex Voivoda getting West vs. West anytime soon? I guess, if anything, there is no plan as of now, Victor. The Wolverine, hello, my friends. Ali Can vs. Ivan, incredible match, I agree. Keep up the good work, Engin Serhii vs. Dave Chaffee. Brandon says, anything is possible. Anything is possible, my friends.
Engin Terzi: Any plan for Vitaly Laletin? Yes, there are plans, but we don't know exactly what. We will decide, you know. says, arm wrestling right now is like the Budokai tournament from Dragon Ball. Every event, you know, every best in the world gathers here, yeah. That is what I wanted to do.
Engin Terzi: We have only one world and we want to see who is the best. No, my friend, Oleg is lighter. It wouldn't be good if they both weigh the same, yeah. Brandon, good man. Thank you, my friend. Adnan, you brought the sport to the level it is right now. We brought all together, my friend. I can't do anything by myself. You guys by pay-per-view.
Engin Terzi: You guys buy merchandise, you guys buy tickets, and then I organize the event, you know.
Engin Terzi: AAA, hi Engin, thank you very much for everything you do for this sport. You've inspired me to do arm wrestling. That's good, that's good that you are inspired. My own son, he had no interest in arm wrestling. I was just trying to be pushy. And then I said, okay, do whatever you want. And then later he just had so much passion for arm wrestling. I said, what happened? He says, you know, because of West versus West, every event he comes with me and he sees all those superstars and now he wants to be an arm wrestler.
Engin Terzi: Not because I want, but because he wants. Gaming X. Engin, just a friendly suggestion rather than deleting the whole podcast. Please trim the certain part. I miss Jerry's podcast. I understand my friend. Feel and drill. Engin, how is your health going? The health is going better, better. I feel better.
Engin Terzi: Hopefully nothing, like I'm a little bit paranoid, you know, even when I take shower right now, I'm like, okay, I'm gonna slide down and hit my head or something, you know, because those three things that happen in three weeks, just like, I am like, okay, what's next, you know? But sorry, not Amy, meant Hermes. Yeah, Hermes, my friend, Marvin, all of these matches,
Engin Terzi: will happen at some point, but it needs to be at the right time and it needs to be the right match. Justin remember, we need to give matches to many athletes. They have contracts. We are trying to do our best together with the King of the Table. And just trust me, you will be seeing very good matches. Very good matches.
Engin Terzi: Michael Workspace. Hello, Engin, my friend from Texas. Hello. Hello, Michael. You nonstop support me, and I appreciate. Haha, Engin, did you have natural competition? Because I'm really strong.
Engin Terzi: I'm natural. My friend, we didn't do testing yet, but hopefully we'll start at some point. But if you are natural and you trust yourself, the is there. Justin please go there and prove yourself. It will be great. ArmwrestlingMagix Adnan says, I don't know how to pronounce your name.
Engin Terzi: You think Leonidas Arkona have a big future in this sport? I don't know if he has a big future, but he looks bright, but time will show. Alexander says, who will be next for Laletin? We soon will decide, soon.
Engin Terzi: Subota, from an amateur from Russia. I watched all the fights and arrived incredibly delighted with your leg. Thank you, my friend. Thank you. That is the biggest success. If you are enjoying what we are doing, then we are satisfied. Do you think Ivan can hook Vitaly with a left hand right now?
Engin Terzi: Not sure. I don't think so, but no disrespect. We all are waiting for a duel between Laletin and Levan. It will be legendary. I'm sure it will happen. Get me in 70 kg weight class, and I will destroy. I haven't trained yet, but I'm already beating 200 men easily at 130. Great, great, my friend.
Engin Terzi: Adnan, would you invite Kilosarchev in the future or Andrei Simayev? They would get a lot of eyes. Anything is possible. Pratik says, Ali Can's next match. Soon we will know. I missed the Super Chats. One second. No, I answered it. But in Brazil, I didn't say another one. Okay.
Engin Terzi: Hello Engin, do you know if Lem and Dimitro will be at West vs West? Hopefully once they fix their internal problems, yeah. Ayhan Han, Engin will you try to get back in shape slowly and compete maybe? I started already training. My form, especially the endurance is not good. But...
Engin Terzi: We will see. My plan is to train till the end of this year, no rush. Once I put a goal, then I rush, and then the things don't go well. My elbow hurts, everything hurts. So I will just train, train, train, train, and then once I'm ready, I plan to pull if I can. How long is your elbow to the fingertips? I didn't measure.
Engin Terzi: Georgie. Hello, Engin. How are you? Thank you, my friend. Thank you. I hope you are good as well. GB19, Engin, Hermes versus Dennis, official or off? Yes. I don't think that... I have a common friend with Dennis. I asked him. Looks like Dennis is not going to pull anytime soon. Hello, Benji. Hello. Great to see you, my friend.
Engin Terzi: Justin remember Whitehead, these Georgians that you see as world champion, they were also the world champions at the WAF wars with the doping test. Justin don't be so sure about what you're saying. Ryan Han, Engin, have you started training yet? Yes, but I did five, six trainings already. Phil Andrew, your honest opinion, who's the best first match for Brian Shaw?
Engin Terzi: I just saw some of the Brian Shaw table training. I think he needs a little bit more time. Brandon, do you think Artem Wrestling Expo would pan out, and could we expect to see one someday? Dave booths for sponsors, signatures meet?
Engin Terzi: I think we need products, my friend, for arm wrestling. We need a lot of products. And maybe some point, yes, but right now, I don't think so. Paul, Engin, did you think that Prudnik would lose that easy against Irakli? No, I didn't expect that. Engin, how about a match between Ivan and Ali Can? Anything is possible.
Engin Terzi: Give me a match in West versus West. Yes, my friend. Right now, this is the qualification place. That's how we qualify people. They come to the comment section, ask match, and I give them. How much your PR in pronation? What kind of pronation? The pronation that they do, I don't find that useful. I have my own pronation trainings.
Engin Terzi: And then you put the best matches together, and I enjoy them, but I am selfish and really would like to see you back on the table and compete again. My friend, you are not selfish. I want the same thing as well. I mean, if you think that I am not so good, and if you want to see me, that's not selfish. Only if I had very, very serious health problems that enables me to compete, and then you would...
Engin Terzi: Still, you know, say, come back, come back, then maybe I will just say that you are selfish, but right now I'm training, and I'm happy that you want to see me at the table. Uh, my friend, I think, is this, is this... What is this? Is this French? I can't read. Um, Spongebob, Spongebob, at some point, probably, yes. Um...
Engin Terzi: Is your son excited to visit US? I have no idea. Sam. Emir. Emir. Okay, he's not here. GB19, you think Ermen should pull West versus West 14 winner? I don't know. We will see. We will see, my friend. Justin we are waiting.
Engin Terzi: results of these matches we are already making plans you know together high engine for example if you had a match against lebanon and if you had a if you had to prepare which areas and factors would you focus to beat him if i would be just say 150 kilo 195 centimeter guy
Engin Terzi: I would focus on controlling his riser, which I call front wrist. And then I wouldn't pull this way, but I would just pull this way. Justin a little bit control here and pull to the winning side using pronator that way. Not this way.
Engin Terzi: but of course that if i was just twice size of how i am right now 1.4 gh as mac hello engine thank you for all your hard work to bring this first place to us i thank you very much my friend for your support benji looking healthy and energetic penguin brother great stuff thank you thank you for your support
Engin Terzi: Chip Ferguson. Engin, you look a lot better. Stay strong. It's a small focal length lens attached to a camera. Okay to bring this first verse 14. I don't know what that means, my friend, but thank you for your message. Adim Izlidi.
Engin Terzi: What do you think Prime Travis versus Prime Dennis left arm match? I don't know. And Chip Ferguson, thank you, and thank you, my friends. And what do you think about recent Turkish arm wrestling? I mean, very good young guys are coming.
Engin Terzi: And one guy is coming, he will be very, very dangerous for the lightweight category. Wasili, what did you find more effective in pronation, pronator training exercises with weights or table time? Both, both. But if you ask me what is the main one, it is the table time, but as long as you have a partner, which is good enough that you can train your pronator.
Engin Terzi: it totally depends on your training partner or training partners but i would still train with the weights and then do the that the last you know touches you know at the table is it true that john brusing doesn't really train that hard for arm wrestling it's just all from experience i'm sure that he trains but of course that he cannot train as
Engin Terzi: much as when he was young, you know. The recovery is just, I mean, I don't know if everyone understands this or not, but when you are 50, when you are 55, 60, the recovery is much slower and you have all those damages from tens
Engin Terzi: Engin, how many times shall we train our wrist a week? Give your opinion. It depends. If you're a beginner, you should probably do a lot, but at my level, I wouldn't do more than once a week. Brian Shaw versus Magnus Samuelson. Victor says, yeah, that sounds good.
Engin Terzi: Hi, Engin, how is your health? Wolf777 asked, when Makaro next match? Hopefully, end of this year. Ferkan Çatırcı, Hocam, perfect English, I'm proud of you. Not perfect, but enough to express myself. Tank Bolal.
Engin Terzi: Biggest fan, Engin. I copied how you train your pronation with down pressure and pronation went up by a lot. I mean, pronation while playing down pressure is best. I'm happy for you, my friends. Mr. Terzi, in which category you will compete, 95 or 87? We don't have 87, my friend. We have 85. If I'm ready, probably first 85 and then maybe 77 later.
Engin Terzi: Engin, who is an armwrestler who has retired but you would like to see return to armwrestling? Arsene Riviere, probably. Hello. Engin, you are the most technical player in the world. I'm a player who is technical, but most technical, I don't have such claim. I'm 50 years old, Omar. Not 50, but...
Engin Terzi: In three months, I will be 50. Right now, still 49. Brachy... Okay, bicep is injured. It will never be okay, but brachyradialis is... How is the forearm looking? Forearm got so small. Forearm is...
Engin Terzi: like 37 centimeter only right now, only 37. It is, yeah. Forearm has been very near 41 centimeter, cold. Right now, 39 centimeter probably, or 38 and a half warm, but I have seen my forearm 43 centimeter warm. What do you think will happen to Turkey's wrist?
Engin Terzi: Do you think if John improves his endurance more, he can still toy with those new arm wrestlers? I don't think he can toy, and I don't think that his only problem is endurance. His hand, wrist is not as it used to be, in my opinion.
Engin Terzi: But if you say best of John, yeah, in his category, he would play with anyone. Maybe not play, but he would just beat, but convincingly. Do you have any matches for 105 kilo category? Michael is asking. Maybe yes, maybe no, not solid, so I'm not gonna say.
Engin Terzi: Engin is looking young. Not really, but thank you, Gaming X. Engin, please motivate Hermes for his left. It's really good. I don't think Hermes will ever pull left again after Ali Can experience. This is what he says. Raimonds, hello, Engin, from the table, Vikings. Hello, hello to table, Vikings. Minister Martin, Engin, you versus David Somerset, what do you think?
Engin Terzi: Killer point, I was thinking it's possible, but more I see Samusha, more I think that I don't think I have any chance. Hello from Kyrgyzstan. Hello to Kyrgyzstan. Engin, I wish you well. Thank you, my friend.
Engin Terzi: I wish you well as well. I'm curious about Arsene Liliev. Can he be part of the Cards for the Future? Yes. Arsene was almost competing. In the last moment, he was canceled, and I think end of this year, he will start again. I don't know if Travis or what, I have no idea.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, hopefully Arsene will make a comeback, Alex Ramirez. Yes, Akbar. Azerbaijan is also be in the race. We just had a qualification event, but nobody came. Which is more beneficial, arm wrestling exercise or table practice? Table practice is more beneficial, but...
Engin Terzi: It depends who are your training partners. How many Georgians have I met in WAF? I don't know. A lot, probably 30 of them maybe.
Engin Terzi: Can you train arm wrestling every day? It depends, you know. For me, you can do it. Justin say today you do chest, tomorrow you do pronator, next day you do, I don't know, maybe bicep and things like that.
Engin Terzi: no my friend we don't plan youth category because this is professional event youth category if you wanna just get better the category is not for professional youth category you can go to waffles europeans asian championships you know and then you get better better better and then you would be invited here
Engin Terzi: Hello, Engin from Cincinnati. Hello, Jerry. Thank you, my friend. Engin, who will own Prime Denis Blanco and Prime Devon Seginashvili? I have no idea, my friend. I have no idea. I don't know why. I see a Super Chat there, but I don't see on the phone that I'm holding. One second. Okay, now I see.
Engin Terzi: Okay, Allah told them. Ne demek kardeşim, saygılar. Pauline, hello Engin, sending you some positive energy for improve health. Thank you, thank you Paul.
Engin Terzi: It will be pity that I won't be with you guys, but I'm already making all the plans for the production and this. Today, I was on the phone with Devon Idris for, like, one and a half hour. Yeah. Thank you, my friend. Yeah, hammer curls are, yeah, necessary, yeah. Caroline, looking good. Engin, let's go. Good to see you, Caroline. Good to see you. Thank you for your support.
Engin Terzi: Is Devon returning to super heavyweight, my friend? He didn't leave super heavyweight yet. You say returning, let him pull a little bit, you know, in the category that he's planning to pull.
Engin Terzi: Hi, Engin. I was sad to hear that I don't get to meet you in Orlando, but I wanted to thank you for putting on such a great event for the USA. It will be amazing. Yes, my friend, it will be amazing. No doubt. No doubt you guys will enjoy. Yeah. I already invited Yoshinobi Kanai for West vs. West already three times. I think he has some lower back injury. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: Is the Turkish guy Omar last year played 75 European in Moldova with big hand? Yes, Cusco, yes. That guy will be very dangerous. What match is first 14 are you most looking forward, all of them?
Engin Terzi: All of them. Okay. Steezy BK. Great to see you, Engin. You look good. Hope you are feeling better as the days go. Yes, my friend. Thank you for your support. Yes, I feel better. Still old. I need to do cardio. I need to start walking. If I start walking every day, one hour, maybe now after this live, I need to just go and walk, but I'm just, I don't know why. I'm just lazy.
Engin Terzi: Richard, Engin, what would be a good match for the first 70 kilo title match? Maybe Mindaugas versus someone? If Mindaugas is willing to make 70 kilo, yes. Engin, you think Hermes can beat Levan in the future? Anything is possible, but for sure Levan would be the favorite. Kalinchenko versus Svetkov might be a good match for Sergei to try into the top 10. I agree.
Engin Terzi: Brooke, will there be a drug test this first of this event? Hopefully, yes. Hello. Not yet. Pauline, I'm sad you can't make it to Florida. It won't be the same.
Engin Terzi: It will be even better, my friend. The show must go on. It doesn't matter. This, our goal, does not... is not indexed to...
Engin Terzi: People. It doesn't depend on anyone. Armwrestling is a beautiful sport. You guys are superstars. You guys will just go there. Your names will be announced by great Neil Pickup. There will be great interviews, and then there will be hundreds of people, and the atmosphere will be crazy. And then you just go there and have war, and everything will be great.
Engin Terzi: Artem versus Vitaly, hopefully next year. Wilfred Haglundever. Yeah, hopefully August. Ryan Bull. I don't know how to read. Is it like Ballinger or how do you pronounce, you know? I don't really know. It's because it's not my mother language.
Engin Terzi: Today, I check your matches. You are really strong. I don't want to upset Ray, but I think Ray is underdog, but ... Artem we going to see more Ongar Bev? Yes, Ongar Bev just had a surgery on elbow. He showed me they remove a small piece of bone from his elbow. Riley Wood, how much does West vs. West ticket cost? It's $50, my friend.
Engin Terzi: And you deserve a vacation. Aymeric can learn from your work ethics. I'm sure that everyone is there on work ethic. I can't say I'm giving lesson, but yeah, whenever I do something I like to do.
Engin Terzi: in a very serious way because you either do it successfully or you don't do it. You can't just do halfway. Whenever I see that I'm not doing a good job at the moment, I will apologize to community and probably quit. GB19, good weather in Turkey, it seems. Yes, it is too hot.
Engin Terzi: Stacey, not lazy, my friend. You do so much. Yeah, maybe you're right, Stacey, maybe, yeah. I think that I need to do everything that I should do. If I'm not doing, there is something wrong with me. Yes, you're right. Sometimes maybe it's too much, but just in my book, there is nothing like that, you know. If I need to do it, I need to do it. Will the city in Florida be first come, first served? Yes, Andre.
Engin Terzi: Looking at the current level, just imagine adding 2013 Arsene Riel to that mix. It will be incredible, Victor. Connolly family. Do you like that Michael Todd has new goals now with super heavyweight? It's not because I like or not. That is Michael's life, Michael's career, whatever. He chooses, I respect. The guy has proven himself many times. I will never be a Michael Todd hater.
Engin Terzi: Houndstown, if I show up to the event a couple hours early, will I get a better seat? Traveling 1,000 miles to see this event. I mean, I think there will be a certain time that we will open the doors, and then, yeah, there will be a line, probably. We need to make a line, and then people, yeah. Gian, hello, Engin. Hello, my friend. Four, zero, Engin .
Engin Terzi: James Lee, I don't know the rest. Thank you for making arm wrestling great again. Thank you very much for your support, James, and sorry for not being able to pronounce your last name.
Engin Terzi: Do you think it's a good idea to enter the tournament the day before if you don't have much experience? I mean, you can compete amateur. Amateur event is the one that you don't have much experience and that's how you get experience. How are you doing, sir? Good, thank you. How are you? Justin.
Engin Terzi: When you chop roll, do you plant your elbow on the pad? I don't know if I'm, no, no, it needs to move.
Engin Terzi: Chip Ferguson, walking three or four times per week, 20, 30 minutes will help you a lot. You are not lazy, and I can't thank you enough for what you have done for our most guys. Whenever we talk like this, you motivate me so much, you know. Paul's saying, you are the man. Please take care of yourself. We need you more than anyone. Thank you, Paul. Thank you. Sir, have you recovered? Yeah. Yeah, Benji, thank you, my friend.
Engin Terzi: Can I ask who will Nugo Shikadze will face? Evgeny Nugo doesn't know, but I know. And if we don't change our mind, you will be very happy. I think Gennady will be coming back by fall. Lagu Rossi, I wish there was a King of Table or West vs West event every week. But guys, you need to support our events. You need to support.
Engin Terzi: that that is how we can pay to the athletes. The reason that I'm doing so many matches, so many athletes can be satisfied, and then rankings can be active in many different category. So support us, please. Where do you see the state of arm wrestling in 10 years? Brooke is asking. Brooke, I will tell you my honest opinion. I don't know. It may not sound ...
Engin Terzi: humble, but I kind of think that I am a good opportunity with my passion, with my knowledge, with my connections, experience. So it is totally up to the athletes and the fans. If they do their part,
Engin Terzi: as much as I do my part, armwrestling in 10 years will be in very high level. If armwrestling, like we need more of pure armwrestling fans, more than fans of certain armwrestlers because certain armwrestlers
Engin Terzi: Today may be, tomorrow may not be, but if you love arm wrestling, arm wrestling as a sport, if you love, if you understand arm wrestling, if you enjoy, if you learn the details, and now from now on, you're an arm wrestling fan, it doesn't matter, there may be your favorite arm wrestler, but whenever you watch Sacho versus Samusha, you will be like, wow, you know, like, wow, you know. So when we have,
Engin Terzi: majority of our fans at this level of fans. And when the athletes started to realize that they need to create fan base, not only I just go train and compete. In my world, that's all they need. But in reality of today's world,
Engin Terzi: Unfortunately, that's not enough. They need to create their fan base. They need to share their training videos. They need to talk. If they don't speak English, they need to do subtitles. They need to touch to the fans. They need to create a bridge.
Engin Terzi: That way, arm wrestling will grow. So answering to your question, if the fans become more of an arm wrestling fans than fan of certain arm wrestlers, and if the athletes realizes that they need to get more involved with the fans, then at that moment, nobody can stop us. But if athletes think that all they need to do, just go compete, win, and just go home,
Engin Terzi: then it will not be enough promotion. Unfortunately, the things don't go as from the only that point. Unfortunately, you need to give more than arm wrestling to the fans. They need to know how you are, what your goals, what's your dream, what's your life view, how you train, how you rest.
Engin Terzi: Like, then they will start following you, and then the things will be different. Thank you, The Beast. Thank you, AnemmasterGB19. How many more West Coast events will there be this year? After August, there will be one more. I live in Yalova.
Engin Terzi: West exercises for hand strength. There are many of them. Thank you, 333D3D. Worldwide guy. Luke 19. I think people underestimating John again. Hook or top roll, both are good. Thank you, thank you, Diptanu. Meladze. Good to see you, my friend, Meladze.
Engin Terzi: Bubba Atkins. Hello, Engin from Florida. Thank you for your contributions to arm wrestling. Thank you for your support, my friends. No, not Devon . Your form imagining arm wrestling is epic to see, like a Japanese samurai about to cut a tree with his katana. Who's the best coach in your eyes? There are a few.
Engin Terzi: King of the Table will be probably end of the September. says, I love arm wrestling. Yes, we all do. What are your thoughts on arm wrestling getting in Olympics? Can we make it happen if we all make ? This is also depends on the Olympic Committee, what they look. If they look for a great sport, we are already there. is ready, and...
Engin Terzi: Engin, you should have a good TV show like UFC does with Ultimate Fighter, Imagine, Devon, Ravijan, Travis, Gennady, and more, living in a house, super matches every weekend. Yeah, I was just thinking. Justin needed, yeah, I was just, you know what I was just thinking? Like, eight of the best super heavyweights, you know, and then live in the same place, and then there are, like, training, like, gym, and then...
Engin Terzi: There will be, just say like two months later or something, or maybe every event, there will be like a round robin, but one match every week or something, you know, just yeah. Thank you, Meladze. I'm fine. How are you?
Engin Terzi: No, my biceps are not gigantic. They're the smallest in the last, I don't know, last six years, I can say, when I made 65 kilos. I think Jerry has a chance to beat Kurdecha as much as Kurdecha has a chance to beat him. Pound Town, bringing my friend to West vs West 14, trying to make new fans for this incredible sport. Yeah. See, you are a great fan.
Engin Terzi: We need to be more. Thanks, Engin. How is your health? I'm doing better, my friend. Okay, guys, I will slowly stop and... need to get rest. You all take care of yourself, and thank you for being part of the podcast.
