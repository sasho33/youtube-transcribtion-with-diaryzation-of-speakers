Around the States, it's in the morning sometime, depending on where you are. Yeah, it's 9 a.m. on the East Coast. So you are from there, Alexandra.
SPEAKER_01: No, I'm from Siberia. I was born here and went to high school, but in college I moved to the US. So almost 12 years ago. Yeah. And you, Alexander, where are you from? I'm from Siberia. Do you know the biggest lake vehicle? Yeah. From there. Yeah, from there. Ulan-Ude. Ulan-Ude city.
SPEAKER_00: near uh mongolia if you know yeah yeah yeah yeah i see so when are you it's between vladivostok and moscow in the middle in the middle yeah but it's still far east of russia and how did you two meet was it in the states or yeah in the states 2018.
SPEAKER_02: He knows, that's good. So when are you going back to the States? August 4th, so almost in one week. August 4th, but Alexandra, the time difference, don't you think it will affect your match? 14 hours. Yeah, I worry about it.
SPEAKER_01: yeah we have a flight to moscow then istanbul then boston and miami oh it's a long flight long so it's like it's like 27 hours in the air are you coming to us i am not fear yeah no it's too close to worlds i was uh actually thinking about going
SPEAKER_01: Nice, you go to Moldova? Moldova, yeah, yeah, yeah. 65? 70? Yeah. Good luck. Good luck. Ah, thank you. Excuse me? You are not going to Worlds this year? No, no. No, it's only one week from the Supermatch. Yeah, I know, yeah. Basically.
SPEAKER_01: When I pulled with Fia, do you remember, we pulled 2012 in Brazil, and when I pulled with Malin 2017 on Zloty, I never thought that Malin and Fia would call me. We do. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: of course we do we know you a lot how long have you been in how long have you been on wrestle i started to pull when i was very young maybe i played with my grandfather i was five six years old just play on a regular table yeah a coffee table
SPEAKER_01: And then I started to pull since 2006. You've been 15. Yeah. My first world was 2009 in Italy. And you have won twice? You have won the world twice?
SPEAKER_00: It's not well, well, well, she was second and third. That's good. National national champion of Russia in 2012. 70 kilos. Yeah. And what do you weigh right now? About the same. Yeah. Same 70. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: do you have a weight limit you and liz now for this match it's supposed to be 154 but we said if liz don't want to add too much we can agree it out 158 for example so around 70 kilos yeah like 72 maybe yeah if she wants to it's up to her okay
SPEAKER_02: Because I see that she's trying to drop some weight now, and then I was wondering what weight limit it was. Who is? Liz. So Liz couldn't come because of personal... She's going through some personal stuff, we have to say to the people that are watching. But Alexandra, what do you think about the match? Have you ever pulled her?
SPEAKER_01: I never pull with Elizabeth and this will be my first Supermatch in my life. This is first... First time experience. Yeah, this is... I think it will be a good experience for me. I think it will be...
SPEAKER_01: Super much power against experience, because I think I have more experience, technique, and I think I will be pulled in my best move overall. What do you think? I think it's going to be arm versus wrist. I mean, she definitely has probably more arm strength, maybe even back pressure.
SPEAKER_01: but all hope on technique and uh efficient training yeah yeah maybe maybe endurance too because when you're bigger you get pumped and tired faster yeah but i start to prepare maybe one months ago without weights because i think it's too late for heavy weights and i
SPEAKER_01: I do just table practice, referee grip. I think it's... Just work on the setup. Yeah, because it's different arm fight versus regular competition. Do you think for you that it's better that you have five matches against Liz than in a regular competition maybe you would meet her just once?
SPEAKER_01: I think better five matches because I need to find key from her technique. To find the weakness. Yeah. I saw many videos in social media with her training, with her matches. I think it will be interesting.
SPEAKER_02: Me and Thea met her last year, one year and maybe three months ago. We were practicing with her. And yeah, I think she's super strong, really, really strong. But you have more experience in arm wrestling and probably more table IQ, knowing what exactly what to do if you feel something in the first match.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe you can change. But she is super, super strong. And you can see that. I saw how she pulled with Carolina Patterson. I saw how she pulled with Carolina Patterson, but it was easy for Carolina. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: First match she pull with strap and after she pull without strap. Yeah. One year ago, wasn't it? Like last summer they pulled. Yeah. Yeah. Around a year ago. Her technique can have changed a bit because she was so new then. So she's probably a better puller now.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, for sure, for sure. Probably more efficient. Yeah. Sorry, where did they meet? Carol and Liz? Istanbul. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, now I remember, yeah. Yeah, Carolina was able to couple her. Yeah. Pretty easy, I would say.
SPEAKER_01: So Alexandra, have you changed your training now when you have a pro match? And then how you usually prepare for tournaments? Yeah, I have more table practice with Alex, with another people, with different hands, different technique, maybe
SPEAKER_01: I do practice three times in a week, around one hour and a half, two hours for my right hand. And now I stop training hard and I do recovery program because I get a little bit injury.
SPEAKER_02: Rick is asking if Elizabeth is not joining us. No, she's not, unfortunately. In the chat, you can ask questions for Alexandra if you want to.
SPEAKER_01: if you want to do something people are saying hi to you guys hi elizabeth i have a question uh what do you think um uh which parts uh more important in arm wrestling which part in in your arm yeah this is my question for elizabeth yes
SPEAKER_02: yeah i don't muscles it's more important in arm wrestling molly what do you think well i think oh i don't know um i think the wrist of course the wrist is really important i feel like flexor yeah here just just to like stop people from going
SPEAKER_01: Anywhere? Anywhere, Tia? And Tia? Yeah, hand control. To control the other opponent's hand in any position really would be the main weapon, I think.
SPEAKER_02: But also to be able to put your elbow, you know, drag so that you, even if you're strong in your wrist, it doesn't help if you're not strong with your left and can hold the other person. Yeah, especially with straps, it matters your left, not your bicep.
SPEAKER_01: yeah when i start uh pulling my coach said the most important thing in arm wrestling this is your head yeah it's true it is true without your head you can lose to anybody really if
SPEAKER_01: I know many people who have power, but they don't know how to use. And if you saw video me and Larry Wills, I beat him twice. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. If you want, I can send you a video. Send it to me. Yes. And we will put it up here somewhere so everybody can see it.
SPEAKER_02: So you beat Larry Wheels. Did you hear that, everybody? So somebody else is asking where Elisabeth is. She couldn't come due to personal things that she's going through. And we also have a question for you, Alexandra. It's how you train generally, like in a week.
SPEAKER_01: during a week how is uh is it those three times that you're practicing arm wrestling or do you do anything more um uh when i moved to united states uh 2018 2018 i stopped training hard because it was
SPEAKER_01: that was the first priority yes i got married with alex i got new job and i start my life again i stopped to training but i don't stop pulling
SPEAKER_01: yeah and I feel better when I just uh competing or just practice without weights and I feel my arm my muscles my body feel better than I work with heavy weights so table time over weights yeah
SPEAKER_02: For me, it's like I only do table time once per week or maybe once every other week. Just because I don't like training armwrestling. I don't like practicing armwrestling.
SPEAKER_02: i love going to the gym and so this is not for everyone out there it's not a tip for anyone to do this but for me to train arm wrestling three times a week my arms would be like so sore how can you do this maybe she's not doing it in a full force every time maybe like 80 percent yeah when i work with weights i do maybe
SPEAKER_00: many percentage oh less 48 percentage oh maybe like 60 60 40 yeah eight reps regular not like heavy singles yeah so that's a big big difference the first coach of sarah beckham right yes that's that's what she loves because of me that she's so good yeah
SPEAKER_02: no i'm just joking yeah actually sarah came to i started a club in stockholm and fia was training there too and because she lived in stockholm by then so sarah beckman was i think she was 13 years old and she came with her mom with jeans on we don't train with jeans maybe people other people do but in in sweden we don't
SPEAKER_02: And she came with jeans and she was just standing there looking at us, say climbing ropes. And we had this first, we had a, it was a, uh, a gym where, um, wrestlers, a wrestler's gym. So we were on the map doing different stuff before we went to, uh, to arm wrestle. And she was like, so sold. She was thinking that one day I also want to climb a rope with only my hands.
SPEAKER_02: And she was so strong, like from the beginning. She was 13 years old. And I could feel, especially with left arm, my right arm is better. I could feel for a 13 years old that she was, I mean, super strong. And then she just grew. And we were practicing too. Thea, you were also in that club. Yeah, I was there the first day she came too. So I also felt that.
SPEAKER_01: special power she had from the beginning yeah yeah so we take proud what's the secret uh swedish girls because you are yeah all your team is the best in the world yeah best in the world what's the part i don't know it's um
SPEAKER_02: I think it's the community of the female arm wrestlers. We get together, me and Fia, we don't live close to each other, not Vicky, not Caro, but we get together. They are all going to come this weekend because I'm celebrating 30 years in arm wrestling. So I am invited. You're invited too. Come to Sweden.
SPEAKER_02: You can celebrate without alcohol, Alexandra, because you have a big match. But anyway, we get together and we support each other. We are pulling hard. I think that has been one of the secrets that we
SPEAKER_02: Because then you can, if Fia and I are wrestling together, I can feel how strong she is. And then I want to be even stronger, so I train. And then the next time we try... It's very close, competitive atmosphere. Yeah, competitive. But also I think we have had great help with the...
SPEAKER_01: We had a coach, Roy Näklund, that was very interested in female armwrestling and in the female armwrestlers that was active in Sweden in the beginning of 2000. So he put us together and he started an elite group.
SPEAKER_01: uh it was not only girls it was boys too but it was we were the most important part in this in this group and he ordered like made the meetings for us in different part of sweden so we could meet and he was very also like keen on having us as friends in the group and and not we were not
SPEAKER_01: uh competitors against each other we were helping each other to to become a great team and i think starting with with us in that group have made us uh think as the swedish girls as a team not as individual pullers in in in that way so so we are supporting each other very much
SPEAKER_02: And it has been hard because you meet these great Swedish women and you can feel when you come to the practice like, oh, I don't want to lose. But you have to overcome that feeling because it's just a practice. It's not competition. How is it for you, Alexandra? Do you wrestle a lot with other females or only men?
SPEAKER_00: mostly men i would say only men yeah because in america when we used to live in new jersey new york she only practiced with nadia a few times yeah oh michelle douglas was just torn but practiced only with nadia because she was living next to us uh and argentina i i forgot no but i know who you mean um i met her also we met her last year in the yeah
SPEAKER_00: New Jersey. Yeah. And also, yeah. Can I go over stepping by?
SPEAKER_01: Canadian. Nancy Locke. Nancy Locke. She lives in California right now, but she used to be really good Canadian. Oh, yeah. Yeah. She pulled with Victoria Carlson on WL. Yeah. Nancy Locke. And now we live in Florida near Sarah Beckman. No, not near. We live next to Miami, so it's... Four hours from here. Yeah, yeah. She's the closest female arm wrestler, probably. Yeah. So...
SPEAKER_00: You were there, right? The other week or two, three weeks ago? No, no, no. But we've been there before a few times at Sarah's practices. I think I saw a video of you pulling her. But Miami area, like South Florida, zero female arm wrestling. So she only practices with my friends sometimes and just doing gym time. That's it.
SPEAKER_01: But how do you feel about the American girls? Because I have the feeling that it's growing and it's getting bigger and more serious in the female sport in USA. Do you feel the same?
SPEAKER_01: It's too different because when I was in Russian national team, I can say I live in gym.
SPEAKER_01: Because I work hard every day, maybe three, four hours in a day. And I prepare for a competition for Russian championship, for European world. And in America, people training and competing just for fun. Yeah, local tournaments, only few travel overseas.
SPEAKER_02: get more experience and just a little up so i'm gonna pull at the competition on the friday who is my uh toughest opponent you mean uh in orlando yeah from all of us i don't know who's coming sure
SPEAKER_02: Except for, I don't think Sarah will pull and I don't think Gabriela will pull. Sarah Wilson? No. Not Sarah Wilson? I don't know if she's coming, but she's strong, right? Yeah, but she's very strong. She's super heavy, yeah. But she's very strong, yeah. Maybe Jocelyn also. No, Jocelyn is not coming because... Have you pulled Michelle Dogen? Yes, yes, yes. No, she is coming.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I think she's organizing the competition with James, her husband. So they are close friends to us. We were staying at their place last year. In Syracuse? Huh? In Syracuse? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, it was awesome. So somebody is saying Jocelyn would be the toughest. Yes. And also she was asked to have a super match with me there. So I was supposed to.
SPEAKER_02: Inge proposed a match with her, Jo Slim, but she had planned a trip somewhere, so she had to say no. So she's not coming, but it will be fun. If you're watching, come there, pull with me. I want a lot of women in my class.
SPEAKER_02: But Alexandra, so what do you think? How do you think that the match with you and Liz will end? I need to... I don't know. 3-2. For you? Yeah. So do you think that...
SPEAKER_01: the first two ones will she beat you two twice and then you will beat her three times or how do you think it will go i think she can beat me in third second much and after i can beat her when i get key from her arm wrist how do you think she will
SPEAKER_01: do you think it will look like what what what technique do you think she will use in the first match uh i think uh top roll yeah but with a lot of side pressure maybe so pro match with marilyn in at knuckles up and probably that's the way she's gonna pull just
SPEAKER_00: side pressure based top straight across like yeah not not much pronation with back pressure but straight sides of this wrist flex a little bit yeah what do you think about the exclusivity do you think you or her is gonna start first i think alexander is faster yeah on the small groups of fingers and wrists
SPEAKER_02: Thank you, Alex. She needs to catch her. That's the point. Yeah. And also it's so hard to catch people all the time too. Even if she catches you and then she pulls you because of her strength, it's really hard to do it by matches. Yeah. Don't forget about elbow fall.
SPEAKER_02: yeah it's important referee yeah but i think if i'm not wrong but at east versus west i think that if you bump the elbow a little bit they don't call out house i don't think but if you really do a big one then of course yeah
SPEAKER_01: people that are watching this you can correct me if i'm wrong um yeah i saw any video on east west where you can move on referee grip you can uh get maybe three falls false start i don't think
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I don't think they will allow any movement in referees group. We have never talked about that. But I know, I've seen it too, that it's very hard for the referees when they are very tense and they want to move their shoulders and they let that go. But the referees will always try to have people still.
SPEAKER_01: But then also it's not fun to make just files or warnings for that and losses for moving in this kind of shows. So maybe they accept the smallest moments. I like WL rules. Yeah, you're used to them. Hi, Chuck. Chuck is writing. I believe you're right.
SPEAKER_02: i love to have right be right about the elbow small elbow jumps are not called as much um so have you any other matches that you look forward to watching while you're there
SPEAKER_01: um pauline against uh rustam babaev it's i think it will be interesting and um john brzenk i think it will be same like me and liz uh because uh power against uh experience too yeah so you think yeah i'm trying to see where they need this is exactly
SPEAKER_01: Alex first coach Leonidas. He showed to him how to pull when we was in Los Angeles 2019. 2019 before COVID, right? 2020. 2020. Yeah. And Alex showed to him how to pull.
SPEAKER_00: and after yeah there is a video on my channel yeah you can watch nice and then specific almost yeah even back then he was already very strong like way stronger than any regular strong man or powerlifter people say if he's bodybuilder he's not bodybuilder he's a strength athlete who just get lean got lean and people call him bodybuilder but he's not he's like
SPEAKER_00: top-top level powerlifter and just overall strength athlete he's multiple German national record holder in some bicep curls maybe powerlifting too but he's strong yeah yeah he's definitely gifted for wrestling because he has pretty big like hand wrist
SPEAKER_00: Because some bodybuilders and gym guys just lack in wrist, like here, here, like fingers. He has big wrist, like big fingers. So yeah, he has a future. What is your prediction? Who's going to win? John Brzenk or Leonidas? I have no prediction, but if Leonidas will beat John Brzenk, John Brzenk and Scuba have to pull for the second place. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Fia, who do you want to watch? I have the list written down here. Well prepared. No, but it's a lot of interesting matches, I think. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: But the one I know most is Giannis against Justin Bishop. I think that will be it's a hype match. They have met before and Justin have beat Giannis and Giannis have beat Justin. So and I think Justin is very prepared for this match and it will be
SPEAKER_00: very interesting yeah it's going to be competitive for sure yeah hopefully it will be a long long fight every match yeah yeah otherwise radiant uh of course kuldecha and jerry cutter is very interesting yeah yeah because you will know who may be the future opening for the one
SPEAKER_00: yeah so do you think alex kurdesha i think alex can take it i think he was working on his side pressure maybe try suppress because he will definitely take his wrist if he will go to win the center and not getting like
SPEAKER_00: just getting pinned with a flat wrist, he'll be all right. He will probably take the win. So you think that Jerry will take Alex's wrist? No, no, Alex will take Jerry's wrist for sure. Okay. But if he won't lose like side pressure and center, he will have all the chances to pin him three times. So yeah, he's best of five. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: and i think alex was working on his side pressure and triceps finishing move because that's the way to beat the guys who do flat press unless you're a hooker and you can hook but alex is not a hooker guy he's just a problem yeah it's gonna be fun it's the first time that east versus west is in uh i mean the real east versus west is in america
SPEAKER_02: I wonder if it's going to be more times than this time. Yeah. We'll see how it will affect eastern coolers. Yeah. But Alexandra, because I'm coming too, and I'm thinking that maybe this is a tip for you, that I stay up longer time till maybe 3 a.m. in the morning already so that I won't be jet lagged.
SPEAKER_02: Maybe you can do it too. Yeah, we will start from now. If you win, you can thank me for the great tips. We're gonna watch some movies all night. Just to stay up. Do you have anything to say to Liz before we hang up?
SPEAKER_01: Thank you, thank you, Alex. I want to say good luck, Lise. I hope you will be in your best shape. Because you need it. Yes, I'm too hungry. And too angry.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah. Uh, when I, uh, start to pull, I sleep first much every time I sleep. And, uh, if my opponent beat me, I, I became, uh, angry, too angry. I screaming, crying, fighting. Awesome.
SPEAKER_02: I love to see all those personalities up at the table. When we interview some people like Ayane from Japan, we interviewed her before. And also Dimitrina, they were very quiet, very calm. And then you saw their math. It was like just fire on the table. And that is what people want to watch, you know, personalities that comes up in the
SPEAKER_02: I think it will be great to see you there. It's like, Pia, you, I'm sorry, but also for you, you sleep on the first match. Do you recognize what Alexander is saying? Yeah, of course. Yeah. So both champions sleep the first match and then bam. But it's also a strategy because then we make our opponents think that, oh, that was easy. I don't have to worry about that. And then, ah!
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, that's true. A Japanese girl. She surprised me how she pulled and why she lost. I don't understand. I saw many times her matches, but I don't agree with the referee.
SPEAKER_02: yeah indian actually did a show about that about this match because many people were angry were angry they were upset yeah upset yeah because it ended that way and so there is uh uh i think it's here on east versus west podcast or england's own own channel where he explains how the rules are and also how the rules may be
SPEAKER_02: will change in the future due to this match because many people thought that ayana was she should come out as the winner but i think it's just fired her up for next time and she will be invited to more east versus west uh competitions for sure she's
SPEAKER_02: For me, she's my favorite female. I'm sorry, girls. Right now, I haven't seen you yet, Alexandra. She's only 25. Yeah, she's young and strong and she had such a great personality when she came up with her hat on the stage. I just love the whole personality of Ayane. But it can change, Alexandra, if you show me the same personality up on the stage.
SPEAKER_02: But East versus West, 14. I tried. Yeah. So thank you so much. Good luck to you. Too bad Liz couldn't be here. We understand, of course. And yeah, I'll see you in Orlando. Yes, basically in two weeks. Yeah, it will be great. Good luck, Alexandra.
SPEAKER_03: Thank you, Fia. Thank you, Fia. Thanks, Molly. Thank you. And good luck, Molly. Good luck to everyone. Bye, everybody who's watching too. Thank you for watching.
