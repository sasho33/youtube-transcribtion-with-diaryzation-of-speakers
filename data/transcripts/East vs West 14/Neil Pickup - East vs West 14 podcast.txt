SPEAKER_02: You want it vertical, yeah? Yeah, yeah. This is how it is on YouTube, I think. Let me see. What about that? Oh, wait a minute. Yeah, yeah. That's how it is, yeah. How are you, Neil? You know what, Engin? I've been better, mate. Bit of a... Probably everybody's aware I've been off social media for a while.
SPEAKER_02: since uh since after the strongman classic really uh just another weird set of times and criteria after uh after east versus west i got um a number of things that have been very distracting frustrating
SPEAKER_02: uh i got ill which was one thing but that's you like yourself terrible cold um run the wheels run it till the wheels came off with strongman events arm wrestling events fight shows which is not a bad thing i love doing that and i want to do more um but the problem was they all came super fast when i was ill and i wrecked my throat pretty bad so i went to have that looked at and they just said yeah you're gonna need to give it a couple of weeks to
SPEAKER_02: So relax. And I said, what do you mean? They said, basically don't talk for two, three weeks. So just leave it, let it get, let it get better. So I've done that. But also within that period of time that when I was at East versus West, my, my cousin died. A lot. I was very close to Stephen Mark died, which was,
SPEAKER_02: very frustrating very thought-provoking that kind of stuff when it is unexpected knocks you for six a little bit another very close personal friend of mine his son is in a very serious situation with cancer right now in hospital at the moment in a very serious condition
SPEAKER_02: Another two of my friends died in quick succession. And I don't know, it was kind of like a bit of a sort of what the moment, you know, when you just, what's going on? You just question everything, like, is it worth, you know? Yeah, like, what the hell is happening? What's going on? And all of these weren't, they weren't,
SPEAKER_02: expected, you know, the people that died weren't expected. It wasn't expected. It wasn't something you saw coming or you thought, yeah, that's been coming for a long time. They weren't people that were particularly old, you know, in their late forties in one case, early fifties in another case, my cousin Steven in his early sixties. But, um, yeah, just, uh, put me on my ass a bit, mate, pissed me off and,
SPEAKER_02: flatline my enthusiasm for a little while but look life is life that's what happens yeah yeah it sounds like classical lord but it is how it is you know yeah there is no way there is no way around it no way through it uh just uh if you look at 2024 maybe maybe the worst year i've ever had actually in terms of it's right up there in terms of
SPEAKER_02: cumulatively but certainly there are things in in other years there are bad things that have happened in your life but this is one that where it's just been one thing after another where you're like what the is going on you know somebody put the brakes on here but look in other areas it's extremely positive and you got to be thankful for that so I'm not I'm not gonna stay down about it I'm not staying away from doing
SPEAKER_02: and I'm back in the mix, mate. I'm looking forward actually to, as you can probably hear, everybody who's been speaking to me privately in the last period of time will realise my voice is coming back. Yeah, yeah. My throat is getting better. My next event, I have two fight shows that I've cancelled. I just rang the organiser and said, look, I'm not going to do these because if I do, I'm going to mess myself up and maybe create some damage.
SPEAKER_02: my my priority at the moment is the big arm wrestling events so obviously east versus west is my favorite event i i love doing the shows i i i love them they're just a lot of fun to me it's like um it's the right way of saying it it's like you're involved in the show but you're also a fan you know what i mean
SPEAKER_02: i mean i i listen i organized and i'm the fan and you're a fan yeah yeah yeah and that's what i mean it's just sort of like so many times i find myself there i do it with arm wars i do it with east versus i don't do it with many events but with with what i like about east versus west is when i'm you know when we're up there at the press conference when we're days before the events i find myself
SPEAKER_00: analyzing matches privately in my own mind, switching backwards and forwards, seeing guys in reception and thinking, oh, I don't know how this is going to go. You know, so many examples at the last event. Neil, you had been doing this long before you were an organizer. Like when there is something, 30 years ago, you were doing the same thing in your head. When you were competing, when you know there is a big match, you were doing this. So it is,
SPEAKER_02: It doesn't matter what you are doing right now. It is how you are. It's how I am. Whenever we see a match, we already start thinking about it. I just want to look. I've got some funerals coming up. So we've got back-to-back funerals that I'm going to attend, obviously. And then when the funerals are behind us...
SPEAKER_02: blinkers on on the next next stage you know go go forward and the next event i've got is east versus west 10 in orlando uh and i'm i'm looking forward to it i'm really really looking for it i love that card i love so many of the guys on there also the collection of of uh great arm wrestlers there obviously you guess one of them's just popped up there one of my favorite guys in the sport my boy the roads uh cobra how you doing brother love cobra um
SPEAKER_00: What an arm wrestler. What a dude. What an hombre. What a character that guy is. And he's my friend. Arm sports. Yes. Yes, brother. Yeah. Cobra is one of those special guests. Yeah. Yes, he is. Yeah. You know, many people don't know about Jerry Jennings. They don't know. Some of them know Chet Silvers, but...
SPEAKER_00: Some don't know how, you know, great our master. And Jerry Jennings, like, for example, like, does people know that Jerry Jennings was 5'7 against Dave Patton? Dave Patton beat him seven times, but he also beat Dave Patton five times. Yeah. Dude's super strong. And, you know, I haven't seen Jerry in a very long time.
SPEAKER_00: Very long time. I'm trying to think when, actually. Very long time. One of the early wafts. Late 80s, 90s wafts, I think. Yeah, yeah. I think last time he competed was 1992, Switzerland. Yeah, Geneva. That is when it was. I think he won, and the second was Frank Walkowski, and the third was Haidar.
SPEAKER_02: Mate, what an event that was. I mean, unbelievable. Even Geneva 92 was unbelievable. You had guys there like Nia Harrell. Zaur was good there. I mean, so many. We had a guy, Rambo, Rod Lynette. Rod is no longer with us. God rest him. Rod was so strong. Super powerful lad in hook.
SPEAKER_02: He pulled Cobra there in Geneva. Cobra's probably in the chat. Cobra had a match with Nihar El of Israel. Baby Sharon, Stonewall. And God damn, I loved that match. I think Cobra's best match was there against Jimmy Maravishvili. Yeah, yeah. I think they had a long match. Super. Twice, mate. They had two.
SPEAKER_00: the final and the heat were both super long and cobra just popped him and just held him there and was trying to finish uh mate unbelievable match unbelievable cobra can you you are in the chat can you tell us who was the third place guy that you you made give him a rubbish really tired tired tired you know long match and then
SPEAKER_00: usa yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and still yeah yeah still give him a rubbish really still beat him still beat that yeah yeah and cobra 80 kilo category that's right 75 yeah yeah and they got you know they were great events mate some of the matches there holy unbelievable matches man geneva was a great event i loved it great yeah
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, so, yeah, as you said, you know, life is just, like, things happen to me in three weeks. Like, I was like, especially when I finally fell, slided and hit the head, I was like, you know, like, I thought it was it, you know, just like, it was really terrible. And then I thought, right now, right now, when I even take shower, I'm thinking that, like, okay, something is going to happen. Because that three weeks,
SPEAKER_02: one after another when sean shaw told us that i thought he was joking i went like yeah sure like literally like thought he was joking and and he said no really nearly he's fallen and he said he's at the hospital i'm like you are kidding me man he's like no no i wasn't gonna go i wasn't gonna go to the dinner i said maybe i would do some filming and
SPEAKER_00: do some promotion, and I had the slippers. You remember how it was raining that day? Yeah, yeah. And then, you know, the restaurant is just open everywhere, you know. Yeah. The grill in place. And then one feet just slided. I tried to do break with the other one. That one, both legs went up. And then the head hit to the table, the barbecue table. You know, like the lighter, boom, you know, just like everything was in. And then I...
SPEAKER_02: also hit the floor and i was like okay you know just like that i can't handle anymore no it was ridiculous i mean when you showed up i knew you'd come incidentally but when you when you showed up in the deck race and stuff i thought this is ridiculous the the just one thing after another tremendous effort that week from from ray life inch yeah he was awesome anna gronlund
SPEAKER_02: you know it so just just great and also um if you looked at the outcome of the show of the of the event itself
SPEAKER_02: Some of the matches there were unbelievable. Obviously, my favourite has got to be David Samusha. Listen, Neil. How to beat that guy? How to beat that guy? Mate, dream match of all time. Talk about it. Fadzinov. He is Fadzinov. Fadzinov is... I mean, they are the same guy. You know? Different style. Fadzinov is kind of... One of those guys that doesn't look so imposing. Samusha doesn't look
SPEAKER_00: incredibly imposing you don't look at him and realize how good that guy is oh he's so good but do you realize that he was he was bigger than usual whenever i oh yeah yeah whenever i saw him okay he's different now because he's special and about the fuzz you know i would prefer to pull samusha than pulling against but you know fazendo was much taller and his hand and wrist
SPEAKER_02: On top rollable. On top rollable. Yeah. Just tell me one thing. Like, you are in your prime. Would you prepare to pull Fazdinov or Samusha? I'm sure Samusha you would want to pull. Definitely Samusha. Because I know that I could have top rolled Samusha. Could I have finished him? I don't know. Probably not. But you had a chance to top roll him. Fazdinov? I don't think so.
SPEAKER_02: I don't think so. No, no, no. I mean, who top-rolled Fazz? Nobody top-rolled Fazz, you know. I don't remember ever seeing him top-rolled. No, I mean, even Taras, when he beat him, he was like a dragon, you know, like half-hook, you know. Hey, and in the open class of the world, 2001 Italy, Fazz enough beat Taras, knocked him out. Knocked him out.
SPEAKER_00: yeah but but the next year at the 86 kilo europeans czech republic he beat taras once and taras beat him twice he was not uh apparently he shouldn't have been in that class these are all old stories but i was told that he had some issue with the russian nationals and his weight was only 77 kilos
SPEAKER_00: speaking to misha afterwards fads enough he's in the czech republic he weighed 77 kilos apparently that was his weight that's what he told me seriously no no he's like 185 and he was pulling 86 kilos yes but he weighed his weight was 77 kilos i don't believe that i mean maybe translation misunderstanding or something because
SPEAKER_00: The guy was huge. He beat Niazzi there. Yes. And the year before, at the Wolves, he and Niazzi had a very tough match. Oh, very good match. In Italy? As Semarinko. Semarinko and Niazzi. Yeah, but in the qualification round, also Gennady and Semarinko also had a good match. Mate, let's talk about the Wolf, Kurt Niazzi, right, for a minute. Because there's another guy.
SPEAKER_00: What an absolutely magnificent arm wrestler, Curt Niazzi is. Yeah. I mean, even now. I think easily I can say that he was one of the best uppers, you know. Oh, mate. Phenomenal. Phenomenal. One of the best arm wrestlers, in my opinion. Just such a smart arm wrestler.
SPEAKER_02: protects his hands so well and what a lovely lovely man what a fantastic man that is you know when we come to uh pendick yeah we walk around uh we have some time i went to get a i went to get a tie and i wanted a tie that was turkish colors okay so i went into a one of the dress shops there's some wonderful uh formal dress shops there where you can buy many suits and things like that so i walked into the shop and the guy said oh
SPEAKER_02: He had a young man there, maybe 18 years old. And he came out and he was translating for me to the older guy. And he said, oh, my father asks, what do you need the tie for? And I said, oh, I'm here working on the arm wrestling show in Pendick.
SPEAKER_02: he said arm wrestling i said yeah he said my friend is an arm wrestler very good arm so i said oh england thursday and he said no no niazi kurt and i said oh i know niazi will depending is where niazi is from like where we are this is where niazi grow up you know where he's from yeah they loved him he called out many guys maybe five guys came out into the shop to tell stories about niazi
SPEAKER_00: Fantastic. Yeah, you would hear a lot of crazy, crazy stories about him. He's ace. What a guy. Yeah, Niazi. I mean, if you talk about the past, wow, there is a lot to talk. And there is a handful of people.
SPEAKER_00: And probably you are the best guy that I can talk about everything from the past. You know, not many people, not many people. Hopefully we're not boring everybody. I don't know. I can't see the chat. I don't know. To me, it's incredible. To me, it's incredible. Because, I mean, listen, like arm wrestling did not start three years ago or something, you understand? No. It has been there a long time. And last 30, 35 years, we know, we witnessed everything.
SPEAKER_00: So that is when we start talking about Jerry Jennings. People probably don't know about him. And then probably when I invite him, people are like, who is this?
SPEAKER_00: In his time, I still think that he's one of the best seven titular ever. One of the best. Oh, yeah. Mega, mega, mega, mega strong. Mega, mega. Jerry was iron, mate. You know, Dave Patton, unbelievably strong. Yeah, Jerry, I remember Jerry and Dave Patton's brother, Ray Patton, in 1990 Houston, what was? They had like three minutes, three minutes match. And Jerry...
SPEAKER_00: won and then he pulled dave hicks another very long match and then he beat him as well and he won like like long long matches you know jerry can could pull forever was houston not 91 no 91 is israel 90 was close in texas yeah 90 texas israel 89 greece 88 sweden 87
SPEAKER_02: At Geneva, 92. I'm trying to think of the guy's name. Oh, the tall, slim Israeli guy. 70 or 75 kilos. You remember the guy? Oh, what's his name? I've never seen him before. He was very... Superchet, GB19. Neil is an arm wrestling comeback. A possibility to you. I don't know. Okay, so I'm going to tell you something, right? This last...
SPEAKER_02: period of time three four weeks has made me think about a lot of things okay and we're going to do an arm wars in uh first week of october and i'm going to arm wrestle there i don't know i don't know but i'm just going to see if i i don't even know whether i can do a match but we're going to do we're going to do a dark card
SPEAKER_02: i'm going to armor so i'm going to compete there i'm having more therapy um i had a i went to have my uh today i went to see a company called proactive who do um magnetic pulse therapy uh and i had intensive magnetic pulse therapy they're onwards channel members and we'll put a film out for people publicly and arm wars as well we'll get the chance to see this and we'll have the doctors and so on who were involved with that explain it
SPEAKER_02: so you can find out what's going on. But I was just thinking, look, I can stay there and never know, or I can find out. And I'm going to do it. I'm going to find out. And it's not a sort of, look, I can come back and be strong. I don't know whether I can or I can't. But I'm just going to have a go. I'm just going to pull a match. We'll see. And then one aspiration that I've got, if I could ever get strong again, I'd love to pull John one more time. Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_02: That will be a guy, myself and John talked about it last year. If I could ever get, I wouldn't try and do it now because it'd be an insult. But if I could get strong again to a point where I thought I could do anything at all or even make him feel that I was there, I would love to pull John again. You never know, maybe me and you, Engin.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Somebody wrote that East versus West, 77 kilo lows. No, my friend, now 70 kilo category we have. We made 75 up to 77 so that it wouldn't be so close to 70 right now. 70, 77, 85, 95, 105. Did you see the match I announced today? I did not. Ali Can, Murado versus Ivan Matyshenko.
SPEAKER_00: 115 kilo world title match. Oh, that's another good one. Good one, huh? Yeah. I already have four world title matches, but they will be crazy. I'm not going to announce them. Probably Alijan. I've got Alijan, probably. Stylistically, I think Alijan is favourite.
SPEAKER_00: You know, the thing is that Alijan is an offensive puller while Matushenko is also offensive puller because his wrist isolation, everything, you know. So let's see how it will be if Matushenko puts Alijan in a losing position. Will Alijan be able to bring him back? So here's the question for you. Were you surprised?
SPEAKER_02: by the match, not the outcome, but by the match with Morozov? Machenko, Morozov? Yes. Were you surprised by that? Did he do better than you thought he was going to do? Yes, I was surprised. I was surprised, yeah. Yeah. I think when we were travelling to the venue, I was in the same car, myself and Ivan were in the same car. And I want to say that he wasn't
SPEAKER_02: He wasn't lacking confidence, but he wasn't confident. I think he genuinely saw himself as an underdog, and not for the cameras, not for the notoriety, for the principle or honor of the thing. I genuinely believe that Ivan didn't see himself as the favorite, and I thought he did really well. I think Morozov is a magnificent arm wrestler, and I think Matyushenko is...
SPEAKER_02: definitely one of my top top 10 arm wrestlers of all time in my guys who i personally really really like and i'll tell you why i think he's very unique i think he's very uh understated in terms of a little bit like what we're talking about with fadzin off and uh and david samusha he doesn't look so impressive
SPEAKER_00: And yet his ability is magnificent. Today, only today I chat with him at least 30 minutes. By messaging. But the guy really, he underestimates himself as well. He's just like, he's not acting.
SPEAKER_00: He's just like how he is. He's not humble either. Being humble is a different thing. He just analyzes himself. But he's not stupid. He's smart. He knows his abilities. But he's not overconfident. He knows. Like today he said, oh, people think that my right arm is very good just because I beat Kamil. And I said, your right arm is very good for 115 kilos. Maybe not for super air weight.
SPEAKER_00: And he said, my level is probably around Dadikian and Sago. And I said, those guys are the top guys, you know. It means that you are up there, you know. See, you just named a match right there. I know it's East versus West, but you named a match right there that I absolutely love. Ibrahim Sagov and Matyshenko.
SPEAKER_00: Wow, I love that match. I love that match. Two Russians is possible, but right now I think that he needs a little bit of rest. He had some shoulder issue. That is why he didn't compete. So I want him to be totally ready. Ermes has some shoulder issue as well. I told him, I said, Ermes, you need to be ready and then pull because you can't afford...
SPEAKER_00: that you have pain and you lose a match because of that, you really need to be careful and make sure that you are 100% ready. We will see, we will see, you know, just like, I mean, listen, Neil, I love what's happening, you understand? I love that, you know, like all, there has never been a time that was, I can say 90%, 95% of the best.
SPEAKER_02: are in the same league and then competing against each other you know this is just like and the thing is it's not just did you call it jurassic park the other day i think for me that's what it is i think um i don't know whether people are appreciative of the level there has been times in history when we've had
SPEAKER_02: magnificent arm wrestlers together in many promotions. The Yukon Jack was one. We in Arm Wars have done things like that, but we've never, there's never been a time for me where
SPEAKER_02: professional one-on-one supermatch arm wrestling for an extended period of time across multiple weight classes has been able to access the best of the east the best of the west on mass and pull them together and with all due respect to the west at the moment the the power balance lies heavily in the east but it's nice to see that challenge and it's nice to see that extended where people get the opportunity to um
SPEAKER_02: see them the most popular the most iconic arm wrestlers compete so regularly and for someone like me who's a purist and a fan of the sport ultimately uh it's bloody awesome i absolutely love it yeah i i i genuinely love being at the shows and on the build up to the show
SPEAKER_02: spinning over in my mind outcomes, scenarios, who can do what, where it's going to go. And during the match, a lot of the time when I'm commentating the match, I'm looking for the nuance. I'm looking for the evolution of the arm wrestling match. And that's what I personally love. I really do. And I can't wait. And it's that kind of
SPEAKER_02: feeling and excitement that's led me to do what I said I'm going to do a moment ago where I'm just going to arm wrestling in October and see what happens and then if it's positive awesome and I'll try and build from there if it's not so be it and I'll try and build from there my schedule's immoral so I'm not really going to be able to train much going in there and I'm not really bothered I just want to see can my wrist can I arm wrestle for a match oh but before we go any further as well I just want to say
SPEAKER_02: I've received so many messages from people just checking in and saying, hey, Neil, you've been away. You're not doing the fix. You're not doing it. Is everything okay? I just want to say thank you to everyone. I mean, guys like Brad Butler. Let's pick Brad Butler as one. It's a day. He's one of the guys. And there's been at least nine that come to mind straight off the bat that are regulars on all the chats. You see them everywhere. If I turned on, I haven't got the chat up here, but if I had, I'm sure they're probably in here.
SPEAKER_02: And guys like that who genuinely care about you, message you, I just want to say thank you. Thanks very much, guys, for the support, for all the guys who support myself, Arm Wars, East versus West, King of the Table, the sport of arm wrestling, and the genuinely are...
SPEAKER_00: within the sport they love it and uh thank you thank you all for all you guys that do that i was thinking i was thinking that you you you didn't do fixed i thought that for two reasons i i didn't know that you had these difficulties until yesterday i think you wrote to me a message uh i thought it was because of the shows that you are doing the other shows you know that is true secondly i thought
SPEAKER_00: Because when you came to Istanbul, you said you have a problem with your throat. I thought that you were resting, you know, like... Correct. Baba, I will tell you one thing. Without you making a program, you know, it is not only the YouTube program, just you are much more than that. And without you, like, a lot of, like, big part is missing. Like, this community needs you, you understand? Because it is because...
SPEAKER_00: like you are not replaceable it is not because you are my friend or you are my guest right now i have been saying this for many years like you like if you if you look at your career all career you know as a world champion arm master as a fan and then arm war events and then eurosport and then you go to any major like arm wrestling tournament neil pickup was a part of it if there is an event and if neil pickup is not part of it
SPEAKER_00: something is missing with that event, no matter how good it is. So, I'm telling you as someone who loves armwrestling. So, just you are like, for the community, like one of those father figures, you know. When I say father figures, it's because of all the 35 years of path, you understand? The path that you have.
SPEAKER_02: If that's the case, so be it. And what I would say is I need the sport also. So arm wrestling is part of my DNA. It's what I've always done. It's what I've always been involved in. And it's what I love the most. There's other sports that I do. I do combat sports. I do strength sports. Strength sports is my heartland. I love strength sports. I've loved strength since I was a baby.
SPEAKER_02: Arm wrestling, strongman, lifting, strength in general is within me. It's within my DNA. It's where I've always felt most at home. And without that, a massive part of me as a person would be missing. And I was very moved, very touched by, as I say, guys like Brad Butler and the other guys that have written to me. Very moving, very humbling.
SPEAKER_02: that people take the time. Donna's picked up some messages and forwarded them on to me and stuff as well. It works for me. She does some PA stuff. And that's been, yeah, very, very warming when people have sent messages over to me in that respect. And I do get forwarded some of them and I do get them, some of them come through to me directly or they get forwarded on by me.
SPEAKER_02: And either way, I appreciate everything. Even if I'm unable to get back straight away, I will always try to do that when I get a minute to do it. But when I'm on something like this, and I don't know how many people are watching right now, but anybody that sees this, I just wanted to say that thank you. And I'll be back with the fix. I got the message tonight for Engin. I love coming on the shows and talking to Engin. We'd do this if we were at a competition somewhere. We'd be bloody
SPEAKER_00: go and talk about arm wrestling. And you know what's interesting? You and I, we can be talking about arm wrestling in the past every year and we will be talking about the same exact things and we will be talking like first time we are talking. Do you know why? Do you know why? Because we miss those days. We miss those days and every time we remember those days that the smile comes to our face with the joy, you know, because
SPEAKER_02: Those years, they were also very valuable, you know, years. It's funny, mate. It's funny you say that because sometimes, you know, you'll hear a song, a music track will come on. Have you got anybody in the chat? I wish I could see the chat. I need to be able to get the chat on, but I can't see it. I'll try again in a minute. I don't suggest you to look at the chat. There are all the things. Are we boring people? So I hope not. I'm genuinely sorry, but...
SPEAKER_02: we we um i was in the car the other day music music song and you it's funny evokes memories you know you you'll get a you'll get a a memory and a timeline that is associated with a song and it's not necessarily you you end up you love the song and it's not necessarily that you love the song it's that you love the
SPEAKER_00: the memory the time you know what i mean yeah yeah yeah you're right yeah and it's it's funny how that happens you guys have much more memories than i i do have because i was just coming there for a mission with a super discipline i was competing and then finishing and then going to
SPEAKER_00: bed and then sleep while you guys were partying and then joking and this i miss all those parts you know it was like 98 it was a mission for me i didn't even know what people were talking what is what was going on nothing you know especially before the social media i had no idea like what people were thinking you understand listen if nobody if if anybody in the chat right now if you've not seen
SPEAKER_02: the episodes of in the presence of greatness which we haven't finished incidentally you've got to do that yeah if you've not seen the in the presence of greatness episodes that we've got with with engine you you need to go and check those out funny oh my god fantastic stuff some of some of the stuff that the engine recounts in that is just oh mate some of the legends i mean the guys that were in here earlier from from from cobra
SPEAKER_02: Jerry Cadaret, John Devon, Marcio, right through to newer guys that are stars and characters. You know, I like real characters, guys who are unique. And if you look in the sport now, certainly for the West, you've got, I mean, Paul Lynn would be one. Now he was a genuine character. Justin Bishop, right? The bomber bull. He's coming back into it at East versus West.
SPEAKER_02: Fucking love that guy, right? Justin's awesome. Rob Vigent, love that guy. And why? Because if you look at Justin and you look at Rob, they are genuine, absolute characters. There's no they or that guy. You meet that guy in the reception at the hotel. You meet that guy on a building site in frigging Alabama or in a donut shop on a resort.
SPEAKER_02: That's the guy. I was speaking to Rob earlier tonight, and what a guy. What an hombre. Love him. And anybody in the sport who's a real character, fantastic. Cobra roads, I mean, you talk about memories of events. Dude, some of the stuff, I don't know how much memory of it Cobra's got, because he wasn't necessarily mentally present throughout a lot of it. But some of the stuff I remember in Virginia Beach, Cobra roads, oh, my God. My God.
SPEAKER_02: with a straw hat on with a flower in the straw hat. That's James trying to ring me. James Statham, I'll ring him back. Straw hat with a flower in it, wedged himself into a door in a bar, and there's a couple of bouncers trying to pull the dude out of the door. Oh, my God. Fantastic. Cobra, like, today would be incredibly popular because Cobra was...
SPEAKER_02: 30 years ago he was the superstar already yeah he was he was like a movie star the first the first superstar of armor the original without doubt he was the first when you came to he was the first of the brash cocky ass americans more full of himself than a russian doll
SPEAKER_02: and could back it up, you know? So when I was a kid, I'm like 12, 13. What year was I in Eskilstuna? In Sweden, there was him, Axon. There's a couple of guys knocking about. And when I first saw him, I think I was 12. He wasn't in Sweden, but he was in Greece. He was also in Crystal Palace in London and at the Bus Emporium. I think I was 12 and I walked in
SPEAKER_02: And he was just smashing people in Greece. He was smashing people everywhere you saw him. And I'm like, who is that guy? And I was, I thought it was the coolest bastard ever. I just thought, okay, he's fucking awesome. I got in trouble with team great Britain for cheering for Cobra when it was pulling one of the British guys, because I was a kid and I'm cheering for the coolest bastard in the room. And he was that guy. And,
SPEAKER_02: Cobra, I was like 13 years of age. Cobra was arrogant, brash, cocky bastard. Treated me like a, like a, like a, I mean, he treated me with huge respect when I was a puppy, when I was a kid. He didn't need to do, but he did. And that always, I don't even know whether he remembers me. I was a kid. But it always sticks in my mind. Somebody wrote, I love the episodes with Neil, Devon, Travis and Engie.
SPEAKER_00: Whenever I read this, I remember that Travis owes me $1 million and he had to send his kid to me, right? Yeah. Listen, that day, that day, Michael Devon
SPEAKER_00: and Travis, they all were organized just to make me look bad. You understand? But I proved all of them wrong. When rambit just came to the phone and later John. Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. Well, Ron did it. And I'm like, he's right. I know that Ron had done it. I was like, he's right. Um, yeah, but those were, like you say, it's those memories. It's going back.
SPEAKER_02: they're replaceable mate they're replaceable they really are and cobra at that time if you if you pick cobra up and you drop him into today's that guy that version of cobra into i mean he looked nothing cobra was just a just a wiry sinewy dude look like his clothes have nothing in them you know just frigging baggy ass clothes nothing in them strong as
SPEAKER_00: Oh, so powerful, mate. So strong. So sinewy. Just an absolute weapon. And if you, you know, you look at Vladikaskov in 99. By the way, Neil, who can beat this guy, Samusha? Who can beat... David, right now? Can I ask you another thing? I will ask you another thing. I will ask you another thing. What do you think about... Do you think that Devin...
SPEAKER_02: versus Petrenko 105. Like, what do you think about this match? I mean, Devon, if Devon is Devon, if Devon is focused, if Devon is mentally prepared, Devon would win the match, in my opinion. Devon is an extraordinarily unusual man. And I don't think a lot of people in the arm wrestling community appreciate that.
SPEAKER_02: Devon on Monday is not Devon on Thursday. He's not Devon on Friday. Devon's quarter decides where he is on any given day through commitment, effort, mission before self. And that when he shows up and he's ready and he's prepared, he's the best of men. When that guy shows up and he's fit for purpose within reason, he is extremely difficult to defeat.
SPEAKER_02: the fact that he is as good as he is now with the damage mentally and physically that he's endured and that he puts himself into the line of fire week in week out is remarkable one of the things you know we talk about the sort of uh any man on any given day i would love to be able to pick a day in my mind and pick up that person and drop that person into the shark tank of east versus west now
SPEAKER_02: to see the outcome of it. If you could, let's say I could pick dates when I've seen you at your best, Spettan at their best, Andreas Rundstrom at their best, Johnny Walker at his very best, Bill Brzezink, John Brzezink, Ron Bath at their very best, and pick these guys up and put them at a certain time. Cobra at his best. So many magnificent arm wrestlers that we've seen.
SPEAKER_02: you know, and bring these guys at their peak and put them into certain match scenarios. And that's what I would love to be able to do. The man that I would love to do that with an experiment with a lot would be the 2008 version of Devon that pulled the deep water and beat John. That man was a special guy. Let me tell you now, special guy. That was a very, very strong version of Devon Larratt.
SPEAKER_00: very well extremely mobile yeah attacking bird i want to i want to also ask you because we are almost like 40 minutes um wow about the yeah yeah already 40 minutes yeah probably yeah 30 whatever anyways let me see there how many minutes oh no this is 44 minutes that i have been yeah 44 minutes anyway so
SPEAKER_00: Let's talk about, I mean, if it was up to me, I would talk with you two hours, only the past. But yeah, I would like to also know your opinions. Try my best. You know about Hunter, the new guy. Hunter Knox. Yeah. I know what I've seen. I've never pulled Hunter. I've never trained with Hunter.
SPEAKER_02: I've never practiced with Hunter. So if you were to say to me, do I know Hunter? Not really. I know of him. I know of his body of work to date. I've studied him. I've watched him. But I can't really speak about him with authority, in my opinion. So, Eugene, who's going to win, Douglas or him? I would go with Doug Ehrlich at the moment. But I believe Hunter is on the climb still.
SPEAKER_02: I think if Doug is fully fit, which I understand from Doug he is, I need to catch up with Doug actually. Doug's contacted me a couple of times. Contacted me once when I was actually at the hospital for other reasons. It was a pretty bad time. I need to get back to Doug. Doug, sorry for not responding, brother. Hope you will. It'll be very interesting for me to understand more about hunting offs in this situation because I've got a pretty good understanding of Doug's
SPEAKER_00: strengths, weaknesses, mental game. Have you done the show yet where you interview both men? Oh, I was still ill and then Rymus helping me, Malin helping me with the interview, so Rymus did the interview with them, yeah. What was the dynamic like, mate? Who was showing, who was most confident in themselves?
SPEAKER_00: no i think i i did the hunter uh doctor sorry sorry my friend just my mind is going yeah i mean like hunter looks very relaxed i remember now he looks very relaxed and he is laughing he is confident that is also confident but he was he was just a bit aggressive like he is like
SPEAKER_00: I'm going to give you a lesson, you know, so you are good, but it's not your time, you know. And we will see, like a lot of people in North America, they just wanted to see this match. So I said this match. So Artem Taranenko is going to pull Mindagos Tarasaitis. Yes. I know that you are Mindagos fan.
SPEAKER_00: And I kind of believe that you'll probably think that Milagros is heavily favourites. And this is a right-hand match, correct? Yes, right-hand. Yeah, but I will tell you something. Lately, whenever I watch the events that Taranenko competed, his right arm is doing better than his left. Artem's got a great right arm, great left arm. Artem's a good arm wrestler, he's solid.
SPEAKER_02: my my concern for artem is the mastery of the hand and wrist and being able to unlock and break through uh mendigus and to to to turn to palm palm up uh mendigus is going to be very difficult that kind of weird move you know yeah mendigus is very hard to bully i i find it difficult to
SPEAKER_02: back against Mendergas because I've got a massive familiarity with how difficult Mendergas is to to dominate does Artem have a chance sure yeah he's strong he's got a lot of power bigger guy bigger guy bigger guy probably more physically strong yeah 10 kilo heavier yeah
SPEAKER_02: I believe that Mindegas is a very difficult man to beat and a very difficult man to beat multiple times. And I've seen Mindegas beat and also watched Mindegas pull in training with some very, very strong, very, very capable arm wrestlers and do well, you know. Backstage, when the cameras aren't rolling, you see things, you watch how he can handle people in a way that is not his sweet spot.
SPEAKER_02: and he's a very very capable armor so what was your prediction i'm going mindegas and i'm going because probably uh in a sweep or losing one pin and then sweep i think if you beat mindegas early uh he will amend and adjust the the best opportunity there the best option for artemis to make it the ugliest most horrific
SPEAKER_02: dogfight of a match he possibly can to turn it into a real battle to take away any finesse uh it's very hard to do that with mindegas so i'm going mindegas and i'm going i think mindegas wins okay with with a with a with a pretty in pretty impressive fashion and justin bishop versus janice amalios no mate
SPEAKER_02: I'll tell you what, that's one of those matches that's so entertaining. Do you follow the social media? Did you see Justin, how he looks and everything? No, I have not. For this last, is Justin still very active on social media at the moment? I haven't spoken to Justin personally. And Justin is one of the guys that I really love that guy. Justin's a great bloke.
SPEAKER_02: I need to call Justin. Justin's a great guy. I cannot see Justin for a year and walk into a room, and if Justin's there, I can sit down, have a drink with Justin, and I will bang, straight back into the mix with Justin and talk to that dude all night. He is a great guy. Do you remember his match with Mendoza, 3-2? Yes. Mate, what a match! Yeah, he was a very, very close one, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I love that match. You know, Justin's wrist and hand when he's on, and Justin is a very, I mean this in the, let's break this down a little bit, right? So you've got Justin Bishop, who owns his own business, is extremely dedicated to that, is a very family-orientated, clean-cut dude, extremely professional working man.
SPEAKER_02: And he's as raw as hell on the opposite side of the coin. You've got the Jedi who is arguably the most professional of the professional in terms of preparation and arm wrestling presence, prowess, polish,
SPEAKER_02: Magnificently conditioned. I mean, magnificently conditioned. You've got to remember, this is a guy who by no means is Giannis in the peak of his career. He just isn't. Sorry, Giannis, but he's not. And yet, he's still a physical specimen. I think that Justin, if Justin comes in very focused, very ready, he's had a... If Justin's
SPEAKER_02: work hasn't been killing him he's not been doing god knows how many hours in the sun providing for his family and he comes in there and he has been able to focus time and he has been able to dedicate and he he's very much in his arm wrestling he's gonna be a very very tough proposition
SPEAKER_02: physically. I think he's the physically stronger man in some of the key areas, particularly hand and wrist. And I think that's interesting because it could create a situation a little bit like we saw when they first met and Justin shocked people at the UAL. Because the situation you end up with there is where you're potentially seeing Giannis have to chase the match a little. If he can't dominate the match on his hand and wrist. Now, Giannis
SPEAKER_02: a lot more complete as an arm wrestler than people think he is because a lot of the tools in his toolbox he doesn't get out of the bag because he never has to because he can beat you exactly how he wants to beat you and i kind of would like to see justin and janice both struggle i'd like to see both men
SPEAKER_02: in a dog fight, both men tested where they got to think a little and show how good they are, because I believe both men are very, very good. I believe both men are capable of more than people possibly imagine. Uh, and I love that much. And it's one that I can be completely unbiased in because these are two of my favorite guys personally.
SPEAKER_02: um i hope they have a barnstormer and i think it should be a great match i'm very excited about that match so you are saying a mess with 50 50 or what 50 50 mate yeah that can go either way and one of the reasons that i'm uh a little more on the fence with that is i haven't spoken to justin or seen justin or heard from justin since east versus west honestly so uh i mean right now he looks huge
SPEAKER_00: Really? And what weight is the match at? 85? No, no, no, no. The match is 77 kilos. But, you know, some athletes are 77 kilos on the scale and then 81, 82 kilos on the competition time. I think possibly this group of people, Douglas, Justin, Pauline, you know, this may be
SPEAKER_00: those type of pullers that will be probably heavier on the competition. Have you spoken to Justin? Has he been training very regularly? Is he very focused? Yeah, yeah, he's very focused. But I'm not, like, I'm very busy. I don't really, like, but as far as I see, you know, Devon said that Giannis is going to win. Justin made a video and told him that, you know, he should be
SPEAKER_00: part of the team is from now on that as far as i remember that you know so so let me put it another way okay i believe that justin came into the to the mindagus match that i believe that was the best of of the bama ball i believe that was a very focused just in a very strong match i think i think not really i think this one right now is better than that one
SPEAKER_02: mate well you've basically just gone where i was going in a different way i believe that justin bishop mentally probably wants this match more than any i believe for for many reasons i believe that justin probably this match within himself more than any other i think this one matters big time so if there's something if there's a match out there that gets justin out of bed
SPEAKER_00: I would expect this is it. I would expect we'll see a very strong version of him. Yeah. I, I, I, I think that it's like, um, Yannis is the one with more experience and Justin needs to be stronger and make sure that Yannis won't have any opportunity to use his experience.
SPEAKER_00: The weight concerns me a little for Justin, if I'm honest. Yeah, but if you see him, you wouldn't think that he lost weight. Did he say where his weight was? I don't know, but if you would just see him, he looks really big. Really big. That worries me a little, if he's got to drop a lot of weight, because we're only, like, two weeks away. No, no, I think he doesn't have to. I think his weight is, like, 79 or something. Yeah, if he's close to the weight.
SPEAKER_02: I think Justin will be the physically stronger man. Physically stronger man. And I'm sure he's aware there's some traps there. Yeah. Anyway, so, Neil, let's go to the next one. Aleksandra Ozrava versus Elisabeth. I mean...
SPEAKER_02: i don't know how to pronounce his name you as an english guy you would know better i i i i'm very excited about this uh this match because i think elizabeth really was a little bit rabbit in the headlights and was trying to punch uh above her weight her first time out at east versus west i think this is more within her and also i think that she is probably evolved a little bit more comfortable it's in her home country um
SPEAKER_02: Having said that, I'm probably going to go Elizabeth, but close. Okay. I don't know, though. I don't know. Alexandra, when she's at her best, is solid. Okay. Probably stronger. Yeah. Alexandra, I think, maybe more technical.
SPEAKER_02: I think is more technical, in my opinion. Yeah. And Alexander's one of those girls that doesn't really get the respect. You know what? I'm going to change that. I'm going Alexander. I'm going Alexander. I'm going Alexander in the long grass. So I believe that Elizabeth is dangerous early because of the power. I think she's just a stronger girl. But I think that Alexander's got a solid pronator and can hang the match up.
SPEAKER_00: very effectively from a losing position and i think she could come back and win in the in the long grass so i'm going to go sometimes when you are you can repeat the same thing three times but we will see i mean so i don't know okay let's go to this match i'm very curious about your uh opinion very very curious probably this is the one that i'm the most curious about your opinion it is spider-man versus craig tuller
SPEAKER_02: Wow. I mean, look. Tom Holland. Yeah. Everybody knows that this is a match I've tried to make five or six times. We've wanted this in Arm Wars forever. And the reason why is because it is truly magnificent. You've got two violent arm wrestlers at the table. A lot of people say that Craig is heavily favored. No, he's not. He's not? No, he's not. He's not.
SPEAKER_00: Don't you think that Craig would be... Am I making a wrong calculation by thinking that Rymonds would be Tom and then Craig would probably be better than Rymonds? Different time, different weight, different place, different Tom. And I genuinely believe that Tom sometimes in matches has taken risks that he didn't need to take and he takes them knowingly.
SPEAKER_02: puts himself in harm's way. And I don't believe that he's going to do that here. I think he is very respectful of what Craig represents and how dangerous Craig is. Don't get me wrong. Both these men can finish the match early. Both these men can finish the match early. Early? Yeah. Do you think there is a possibility for Tom to dominate Craig? Oh, yeah. Oh, I thought that maybe a long war.
SPEAKER_02: I think it probably would end up being a long war, but I think both men can win early. Both men can flash. If you look at the match we were talking about a moment ago with Tom and Raimonds, Tom ran Raimonds over a couple of times, and then it turned into a career-ending dogfight match.
SPEAKER_02: And this could go the same way. Craig could flash Tom. Craig is such an aggressive hit and second hit. Two yay, two hits. The Fury hits twice. And that can catch a lot of people out because he's so aggressive and he hangs onto his knuckles. He can keep his knuckles so high. That's a problem for a taller guy like Nanastar, for example. And he encountered those issues with Craig. Tom's a little different because he doesn't shy away from...
SPEAKER_02: most effective at finding their position in the match and not panicking is most likely to win I've got Tom as a very slight favourite very slight favourite I think the thing that works against Tom is that it's in America I think that
SPEAKER_02: take it when you travel overseas i've said this many times when the guys have come over to istanbul they've come over to the uk for almost they come to pal in in uh in poland it is more difficult when you travel overseas and i think just the environment the sleep patterns and the other little nuanced things can create a problem and when a match is very finely balanced as i believe this one is that favors craig
SPEAKER_02: So if both guys come in and they're 100% on their money, I would say Tom via Nats. Very, very close. In the scenario we're in, in Florida, with the humidity, the heat, and all those things, which Craig is very used to, less travel, I think Craig edges the favorite. In reality, I think Craig will start as a favorite. So I would say Craig, 55-45 favorite. Okay. Okay.
SPEAKER_00: If the match happened in England or Turkey, Tom, 55-45 favorite. And this is a match I think you, hopefully it delivers on what I think it can. I don't know. I don't know. I travel to America. I travel to Canada. I won wars everywhere. You know, just, I mean, I mean, if you are just going there three, four days earlier, you know, and I think that like that's enough.
SPEAKER_00: The Western team, 13 events in a row, if you also count King of the Table for 24 events, they came to the East and they many times were successful. Devon won the title, Pauline won the title, Tata Sings won the title. You know, just, I don't know. Anyway, so let's go to the... Let me just break that down a little, Engin. Okay, here we go.
SPEAKER_00: Let's break that down a little. Whenever you said that if this match was in England, he would win. Now in Florida, then he wins. No, not would win. It sounds like the winners are never winners. It's just because the match is there. No, that's not how it's meant at all, mate. Let me put this another way. When you travel to America, you travel there to win.
SPEAKER_02: Singular focus. Did nothing else. Didn't go out, didn't drink, didn't party, didn't do anything. Okay? You're like Yanis Amelins. Tom Holland ain't that guy. If he's going there, if he's taking this match seriously, he shouldn't be. He is not.
SPEAKER_00: the supreme 41 he's not going to go and get drunk he wouldn't be the same guy you know still like he wouldn't be that guy in england or in istanbul either you know so what i'm just saying
SPEAKER_00: The time start of the event, 1 p.m., is exactly the same time in Istanbul, 8 p.m., like seven hours difference. Every time we start 8 p.m. there, it is 1 p.m. in East Coast. So we're going to start 1 p.m. the same as it is 8 p.m. in Istanbul. I mean, I don't see like he comes like three days earlier. I think everything will be fine. You know, if Craig wins, Craig wins. If Tom wins, Tom wins. But whatever, you know.
SPEAKER_02: Let me be very clear here. Whoever wins deserves to win. What I'm telling you is what I predict as nuance within the match. These are the realities of arm wrestling, the reality of things that can affect an arm wrestler, an individual arm wrestler. I know both these guys very well, and I give Craig a favorite when he's not traveled the same distance, when he's used to the heat and the humidity. You've been to Florida, right, in summer?
SPEAKER_00: Once. Bloody hot and bloody humid. Yeah. Craig lives in Louisiana. Anyway, so let's go. We have so many matches. And do you know Ryan? I don't know how to pronounce it. Bellinger. Bellinger? Yeah. Okay. He's going to pull Ramos. And Ryan is...
SPEAKER_00: 97 98 kilo guy who's making 95 and yeah today i talked with raymond he's around 87 but i think he can be 90 so i i i like uh raymond is my friend like we work even together you know at the east versus west i kind of see him as underdog if he beats ryan i will be surprised yeah i can't say i know enough about ryan
SPEAKER_02: to know what threat level he's a much bigger guy I I feel like he will need to be way way way stronger than Ray to be able to beat Ray over the multiple uh yeah over the multiple rounds I think Ray is a very awkward man to beat I think his ability to
SPEAKER_02: stick people into horrible positions and outlast them is his key primary weapon. I think that's what it makes him so tough to beat. I genuinely don't know
SPEAKER_02: what Ryan is about in that respect if whether this is a guy that can can do that can get into horrific matches and and come out on top I don't know I don't want to discredit the guy or say that that can't happen when it might maybe he you know there are certain guys like let's say Adam Wojcicki
SPEAKER_02: who you say, okay, how does that guy perform if he's in a very long, drawn-out match? I would always think that in most instances, it's better for him if the match goes longer. I think he's got incredible... Like, Rez would be another guy. So, if a match goes long... Rez is... Weird. Like, it's just different, different. Rez is just, like...
SPEAKER_02: like very different, different, like. Yeah. And maybe, maybe, maybe Ryan Bellinger loves it. Maybe, maybe Ryan can, that's where he wants to be. You know? I mean, put it this way. Am I talking bullshit or are they not on the same team? Aren't Ryan and Adam like on the same team? Yeah, yeah. Hunter as well. Chet Silver's
SPEAKER_02: Yeah. So, so let's say for example, and this, and I don't know, I'm just painting scenarios here, right? So let's say for all I know, Ryan and bloody Adam,
SPEAKER_02: every wednesday night at practice probably they're playing for 10 minutes yeah i don't know maybe you know what i mean i don't know maybe they do it's like hunter i can't sit here with authority and say oh yeah ray's gonna outlast right i don't know ryan's a bigger guy i don't know i saw his matches i just checked his matches um the guy is seriously
SPEAKER_00: Powerful. And also, yeah, I saw his wrist, quick wrist move. Also, I saw his endurance. Like, once he's out, he can also wait and outlast the guys. I'm not going to mention the matches. Yeah. But the guy is strong, and he can pull tough matches. That is what I saw.
SPEAKER_00: i know the same thing if this match was 85 kilo match i would just say right but yeah category this category so what is ryan actually weighing like 95 you say i think somewhere i read he's he's losing three four pounds or something so he's probably just say 97 kilo probably he's probably 2 12 to 13 or something pounds and unless unless i'm wrong
SPEAKER_02: And if you can see the chat, somebody in the chat may know, right? But I thought that Ryan and Adam are the same crew with Chad. So he's pulling Silvers, who's a frigging beast. He's pulling Adam. He's pulling Hunter. God knows who else is in that team that's a beast as well. So the guy is pulling with
SPEAKER_02: stupid strong arm wrestlers all the time as is Ray both guys have got iron to sharpen iron so if all those things are relatively equal then you would expect the bigger man to have a big advantage the the key thing which uh I wish I knew more about Ryan was simply the endurance thing um if I knew more about that and if Ryan was extremely confident in that respect
SPEAKER_02: Then he may be a favorite. I don't know that. So I'm going with my boy Ray. I'm going to go with Ray in a war. Because I don't think Chad's team, Ryan himself, while I don't know Ryan, I've seen Ryan pull. And what I've seen of him, he looks very capable.
SPEAKER_02: I don't think he would come into this thinking he's not going to win. I think he's coming in here knowing, and let's be honest, it's not like there's a shortage of footage out there on real life. He knows what he's facing. He knows the level he's facing. So I figure Ryan's coming in here knowing exactly what he needs to do. Clues in the title. He's called the Bull, isn't he? So, you know, I'm sure the guy's rock strong. And I think it's going to be a... Neil, you...
SPEAKER_00: You have been part of WAL long time and you know Paul Talbot. And I heard that right now he is in incredible shape. From other side, we know Reg incredible. And the question is like many people says that no matter where the match stops, Rez wins, they say.
SPEAKER_02: Do you agree with this or do you think that it can also depend on which position the athletes have? Well, it can definitely depend on which position the athletes have. If the very best of Paul Talbot shows up, there are times in his career when I know that he would have given Reg major problems on that left arm. Definitely. There are times when he would have given him problems.
SPEAKER_02: Paul has been quiet. I haven't seen a great deal of him, and I don't know where he's at focus-wise. I hope that he's training with Dave Chaffee and he's doing some good things. Incredible stuff. Yeah. Mate, I remember in Atlantic City with the WL, and that day there, Paul Talbot was phenomenal. Phenomenal. Very, very, very strong. If that guy shows up,
SPEAKER_02: We've got a match. You look at the thing on paper, and, you know, Cedric Khan's a... He can go forever. Rez is a frigging weirdo. He can go... He doesn't seem to get miles on the clock. I mean, back in the days in the 75 kilo class, he was in there for hours in matches. Stupid long matches. So, based on endurance, my favourite in the match would be Rez.
SPEAKER_02: If the best of Paul Talbot shows up, it's on. Okay. Okay, so let's move. Aymeric versus Jonathan Breda. Ooh. Ooh, that's interesting. I'm going Aymeric. I'm going Aymeric Pradeen's.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I'm going to go Amarik. I've got Amarik 60-40. Yeah. I think Amarik is very, very strong. Very, very strong. I think Breed is awful bad. But I think when Amarik shows up on fire, I think he's a problem. This is a left-handed match, isn't it? Yes, yes, left-handed. Yeah. I've got Amarik. Both gentlemen have a stronger left than the right. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: And I may have that completely wrong. Jonathan Breed is a bad dude. Right now, he's doing that powerlifting stuff. Yeah. And what he says and what other people says, that he is in incredible shape. Yeah, he will need to be because, yeah, Americk is a bad man. He really is. Bad dude. Okay. And so let's move.
SPEAKER_02: um corey west versus travis legends left arm oh god put it this way you know the last time we were together in istanbul i said i i was of the impression that we hadn't seen an acid test yet for travis on the on his on his his favorite arm on the left arm well we're about to this is a much more stern test than
SPEAKER_02: Derek, who's better on the right by a long way. This is a very stern test. This is a great match. Incidentally, this is a great match. I mean, this is a great match. If people are looking to see the best matches, matches between guys that are genuinely interesting, this is one of those matches. Because I consider myself very knowledgeable on the sport of arm wrestling. And I love this match because it tells us so many stories. It answers the
SPEAKER_02: A lot of the questions about the pecking order in North America, both domestically and internationally, people wanted to see where is Travis at. I feel like it's quite a brave match for Travis this. I feel like stylistically, the match when he's at his best would suit him. I feel like he would be a heavy favorite in his own mind here. But this is no bummer.
SPEAKER_02: Corey's very, very strong. And Corey will be looking to get tied to Travis, and Travis will welcome that. So I think we have the opportunity to see the best of both men here. And Travis has a lot of pressure here, doesn't he, really, when you think? Because he kind of can't afford another misfire, and particularly on this arm.
SPEAKER_02: Now, the reality of the situation is for myself, for you, we know that there is no misfires here because everybody who's pulling on the card is a killer. Everybody. If you're on this card, you're an animal. Just to be on the card. But Travis is a perfectionist. Travis is someone who wants to win, wants to entertain, wants to excite the crowd. He's going to want to win, and he's going to want to win impressively. And this is a very difficult man to put away quickly. Corey is no bummer.
SPEAKER_02: based on nostalgia, based on an awareness of where Travis's residual level on the left arm was. I'll go with Travis is the favorite. And for Travis's sake, and also in some respects, the sake of arm wrestling,
SPEAKER_02: I would love to see that come to fruition and Travis get something in this match. Win, lose, or draw, I'd like to see him perform well. Make it into a match. If Travis does well here, for me, it's a win. If he does well here, it's a win for him. Because I think Travis is trying to pick up the gauntlet and set off running when he hasn't warmed up. And he's pulling some... I mean, Kalinichenko, who we just arm-wrestled right-handed...
SPEAKER_02: That is a very strong, very formidable opponent. Kalinichenko next match will be someone from top 10. Yeah, Kalinichenko is mega strong, mate. Mega strong. Very powerful lad. Now, Travis on the left arm is a very different arm wrestler to the right arm. Very different. And as you know, when Travis was at his best on the left arm, he was magnificent to watch.
SPEAKER_00: Lethally, lethally effective on the left arm. Lethally effective. Yeah. Guys, tomorrow, Levan Saginashvili will be my guest. And next day, Saturday, Oleg Petrenko will be my guest. And Monday, Hermes Gasparini will be my guest. And so let's go to the next one. Lars versus Matt Mask. Whoa. A match we've seen before.
SPEAKER_02: in vegas the one that you you organized many years ago yes yeah um right now i would think that the uh the favorite would be matt i think he has a great deal of pace i would expect that however there has been a lot of learnings here i think that uh both men will know exactly
SPEAKER_02: what they face now more than they ever have before not just from their own experience at the table that does play a part but they've also had the opportunity to watch each other win and lose and know where the weaknesses are and i think if i was lost i wouldn't come in here and play for height at all i would come here and make sure you maintain your arm position
SPEAKER_02: you may throw some pronation in there but don't climb for height just pronate and hold on and then look to to get into the press the other alternative is press from the start and it's whether he's got the bravery to do that against someone as venomous as matt i've got matt as a favorite 60 40. very intriguing match matt mask's favorite 60 40.
SPEAKER_02: very intriguing match and i think this i would be actually surprised if this turns into a screaming battle i think that both men will try and finish the other one and both men will go for moves which will neutralize their opponent quickly i think matt will be looking to just decimate the thing
SPEAKER_02: put it to bed really quick and I will see which style of arm wrestling laws chooses. I think it would be a mistake to try and back pressure with Matt. I think if he does that, he must do it from a low position on the hand, pronate very hard, but don't try and climb up high. I think if you climb up high with Matt, you're going to lose your hand and wrist. And I think Matt will, uh, we'll take him to school if he does that. Another one, uh, Frank Lamparelli versus Dave Chaffee.
SPEAKER_02: wow holy wow dave chafee has one weapon that really serves him in this and it's side it's the pressure it's the side pressure he's got tremendous side pressure if the brakes go on but lately this as well yeah i mean he he he pressed laletin with deadrest
SPEAKER_02: yeah i would say that dave is a 60 40 favorite or slightly more this is what we were talking about earlier with the sort of acid test scenario very much the acid test for uh for frank here this would be great can you imagine if frank comes in and wins this the pressure here for dave is significant as well because dave's got a couple of losses he'll really want to get one on the board here particularly in in america
SPEAKER_00: Particularly in America. Yeah, I've got Dave's 60-40 favorite. Okay. Let's go. Kamil Jablonski, Michael Toche. What a match, mate. Holy shit, what a match.
SPEAKER_00: Wow. See, this match is good enough to confuse you, right? Because you see so many possibilities. What if goes there? What if goes there? What if Michael does the shoulder pressure first and effectively
SPEAKER_02: What if he cannot? What if he goes to the open arm top row? And then, like, so many possibilities. So many. Exactly that, mate. An absolute myriad of possibilities here. And the other one, and in my opinion, the most important one here, is the mind games, the mental side of this match. It's massive. Because Michael sometimes gets caught in two minds, what he needs to do. He needs to have absolute clarity here.
SPEAKER_02: He needs to have absolute clarity here because one thing I'll tell you about Camille Jablonski, that man is utterly and completely fearless. He does not care whether he wins or loses. He will throw the kitchen sink at you. I'd love to see Michael come in with that same confidence. I'd love to see Michael come in
SPEAKER_02: and try to prove that he is the stronger man in the match and come in with the swagger bring the monster bring that guy let's see this because if that guy shows up holy what a match what a match this will be awesome that could easily be match of the night for so many reasons i think it'll be very emotional i think it'll be another extremely explosive affair
SPEAKER_02: I'd love to see these guys go just straight at each other. No finesse. Don't try and walk hands. I actually think it's a mistake if Mike does that. If Mike tries to get around Camille, I think it's a terrible idea. I would meet him head on and see who's fastest finger on the trigger. Because that's what this comes down to. Who gets to the position first? Who's the fastest finger on the trigger? Yeah. Great match. Love it. Yeah. Okay. Let's go to...
SPEAKER_02: Let's go to Prudnik versus Tata Sings. Do you think that this time things may be different? I mean, the romance of things says yes. The fact that Todd has been as powerful as he has recently says yes. You just wonder how much
SPEAKER_02: confidence how much mental mapping and experience if kenny prudnik has now he's been down this road before with great success and he's found a route through todd and with a guy who's as good an arm wrestler as evgeny is that always gives him a chance what i would say is that i don't believe that right now
SPEAKER_02: we are seeing the best of Evgeny Prudnik. I don't think this version of Evgeny is as strong as we've seen. No. If Todd Hutchins is going to beat Prudnik, it's now. He has a huge opportunity right now where I believe that Todd is comparatively the athlete in better shape. I think if you look at the guy's
SPEAKER_02: It's a better version of Todd than it is a version of Evgeny Prudnik. Do you think that Prudnik will go to Orlando in the same shape that he showed up in Istanbul against Herakli? I don't think he's got enough time to correct it, Engin. To that extent. I think he'll go in great shape. I think he'll go in the best shape he can. Do I believe he's in the best shape? No.
SPEAKER_02: Do I believe that he can make a very significant difference in the time that he had available? No. Do I believe he needs to be as strong as he needed to be to put the brakes on Irakli? Actually, no. I think that he will know there are some routes through Todd that he can access. And I think he'll go straight to them. And he may be strong enough to make it stick. He may be strong enough to make them stick. But I think Todd's got a better chance right now than he's ever had.
SPEAKER_02: I think based on what I've seen of Yevgeny recently, his size, his shape, his confidence, his amount of... Just physical. You can see when he's on. You can see when he's ready. You can see when he's at his very best. And I don't believe we're seeing that now. Just looking at his forearm. When that guy shows up and his forearm just fits a burst, that's a barb, man. I don't know. Sometimes five weeks, maybe...
SPEAKER_00: Enough to change. Who have you got? I see 50-50. Yeah, I'm going to go 60-40. If I knew that the Prudnik that pulled Irakli is going to be facing Tata Sings in Orlando, then I would say probably 60-40 Tata. Yeah. But I know that it's not going to be the same Prudnik, so it's probably 50-50.
SPEAKER_02: I'm going to go, I'll go in based on that. And the fact that you're so in touch with these guys and speaking to them, I'll go 55, 45 in favor of Toddzilla. Um, yeah, I think Todd by a margin by a spice light margin. Okay. So let's go. Jerry Cadaret versus Alex. I mean, what a match. I listened to you. You tell me, listen.
SPEAKER_02: This match is wonderful, isn't it? I mean, what an incredible match that is. You've got a genuine rising superstar in Alex Kadecha, who is super focused, becoming better, stronger, more well-rounded all the time. So what do you throw in front of him? The most awkward possible opponent in Jerry Cadoret, who is inimitable. You cannot
SPEAKER_02: replicate what this man does you look at where alex may have a weakness because of the size of the man the length of his arm the manner in which he pulls his ability to get close and tight and it's probably what jerry does best so this is a
SPEAKER_02: an intriguing match for a number of reasons. And one thing it does do for me is it creates a situation where Alex Kadecha has to be a bully here. He would have to come into this match and make sure that he doesn't allow Jerry to access the shoulder. If he starts on the B side or tries to go straight back, he's going to have a very, very difficult day.
SPEAKER_02: If however, he can move off center and he, and there's two things I'm going to mention here. We're going to speak in a moment about the proximity of knowledge training with people. The fact that Hermes is so in touch with Alex and that little crew, and they speak about the nuance of how you get through a guy. I am sure a lot of conversations will have taken place there between my friend.
SPEAKER_02: And Alex, you know, they're going to have spoken about this. And Alex is very astute, diligent. He's going to try to drill that and to try and emulate what we saw from Hermes. Now, singularly focused and extremely committed. You would have to say that
SPEAKER_02: we will probably get a really good indication in the first round of how this match is going to go whoever is able to make the running in the first round i find it very difficult to imagine that the other guy particularly if it's made by alex i think it will be very difficult for jerry to sort of reverse his fortunes after that i think both men have got to bully their opponent both men have got to shut out the light if i was jerry i would
SPEAKER_02: Boxed Alex in from the get-go. I would not want him to have any breathing room. I would make sure that he didn't have access to my wrist line. I would try and keep him off that. I'd sacrifice hand. I'd feed him everything he needed, make him feel at home and comfortable, and then drop a house on him. If I was Alex, I'd be trying to access that wrist line. I'd be trying to make sure that I was making center my own, keeping Jerry outside that shoulder line.
SPEAKER_02: taking a step left straightening up that lower palm and when i hit i wouldn't just be going backwards i would be moving the arm and to create to make sure that he moves jerry palm up and onto the b side as early as possible fascinating match can go many ways i think i remember one one round kennedy wanted to go that way and then
SPEAKER_00: jerry jerry pressed him down in hook yes i think i think uh you cannot go backwards if you go straight backwards you've got a problem again they wanted to go inside and inside
SPEAKER_02: That's an option for Alex. To meet him in the center, to meet him bang on center, that's an option for Alex. Alex is a very big, very strong man. He doesn't have to run. Don't run. Either go through or towards. Jerry will welcome towards. Jerry would love Alex to run. If Alex runs, you're going to see a similar situation to what we saw when Alex pulled against Krasimir back in the day in an amazing match. Because it's very difficult for
SPEAKER_02: a man as big as Alex to maintain the correct body positioning if they're opened and extended. One of the downsides of size is it can be a little too much. I would love to see both these guys be brave and try and bully their opponent.
SPEAKER_02: And I hope that's what we see. Alex is a very aggressive, super quiet guy off the table. That is a very big man, a very, very strong man. And he's a rising star. I'm predicting that if he sticks with this game and becomes more technically diligent, Alex is one of the biggest threats to the overall title, possibly the biggest threat alongside Lalletin that we've got in the sport right now. I think he's very dangerous, very dangerous, Pollock. Yes.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, John Brzezink versus Leonidas. Oh, my God. John Brzezink. Whenever I pick against John, John proves why he's John. John's ability to take his opponent's hand and wrist when he's at his best and when he's focused is remarkable. If this was John when he's focused and at his best,
SPEAKER_02: match i don't believe would be close but i think right now my biggest concern is how much does john want to arm wrestle now how focused and diligent is john i believe when he pulls someone like leonidas arcana he is pulling an ultra professional ultra committed
SPEAKER_02: and improving arm wrestler. I think Leonidas is taking arm wrestling more seriously than we think. And I think this is a genuine athlete. I think he's a very intelligent guy. I think he's right there. He's studying hard. He's making gains all the time. And he's in the peak of his career. He's right there in terms of physicality. He is not, however, polished and he will not shut down the gaps.
SPEAKER_02: So you've got a situation where John may find gaps and may prove again why he's the best of all time. And that he is. I would love to tell you that based on physicality, Leonidas Arcona is going to win this match and everything in your, if you look at your head, your head tells you Leonidas will win. He's too strong. He's too powerful. And he wins this match.
SPEAKER_02: I'm going to go with John Brzenk. And I'm going to go with John Brzenk because I believe that he has the ability to do what he has no right to do and upset the apple car at a time when he definitely shouldn't. And right now he definitely shouldn't. I bet if I rang John now and said, Oh, have you been committed? Have you been training? He'd be like, no, I've been doing anything. No, he really wouldn't have done. But, and yet he's not,
SPEAKER_00: He's not cut from the same cloth as most men. Can I ask you something? Yeah, we finished all the predictions. Can I ask you, who have you got? John or Leonidas? It totally depends on John's shape. Yeah, totally, totally. I mean, if it was, if we were in, like if it was like 2006 John, I wouldn't even set this much people.
SPEAKER_02: yeah yeah as a man i think he's a very very astute guy he's chasing hard and he's on the rise i think he's dangerous for a lot of people i think he's improving my only concern for him is
SPEAKER_02: that early in the schoolboy match, he left some holes. I think that, um, schoolboy panics a little, I think he sometimes can talk himself out of much. He's a young guy. And I think that John, if he's given those same positions, we'll capitalize on them. I have two questions. The first one is very hard one, the best of jumpers zinc versus
SPEAKER_00: current mindogas top one i mean yeah who is the yeah i mean you know yeah yeah yeah yeah i mean i didn't want to disrespect mindogas just top top three all right you've got mindogas who's just just a regular goal right you've got john three who based on everything else yeah and then at number one
SPEAKER_00: I mean, it's Tesh. Oh, Danny Tesh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Anyway, so the serious question now, have you ever met anyone who has been part of armwrestling at high level for at least 20, 30 years? Just say since 90s or since 2000s,
SPEAKER_00: especially since nineties till today, like some arm master or some referee or some organizers, like someone who really knows about arm wrestling. Have you ever seen anyone who thought that someone else is the God, but not John Brzee? No. But have you seen any single person, like just say,
SPEAKER_00: But anyone from the past till today, you know, but someone who knows Armisen. I'm not talking about some new guys or something. Yeah. Do you know where the problem is that they look at six years old man and they are saying, oh, in his time, like Armisen was easy. And then that is why he was, listen, I'm not saying that he would beat
SPEAKER_00: Levan or something, no way. But I'm telling you, like he would destroy, you know, just say, put him in this hard 105 kilo category or 115 kilo category. Just Ivan Matushenko for many years, he competed against John Brzee, Gennady competed. Of course they were, they were not as big as they are today, but even those guys that were really big at that time, John
SPEAKER_00: around those 2006, 2007, 2008. He was just literally playing with them. I don't say this to disrespect those new guys who think that Johnny wasn't the God or something like this. It is just like I'm trying to help them to understand. Neil, how old I am right now? 50 years old.
SPEAKER_00: And can you imagine the damage I have because of the arm wrestling from neck, from back, from the arms and elbows, you know, like just, just like only, only three years ago. Do you remember my shape when I pulled Vera Dobrin? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you would guess that it would be a good match, that shape versus just say Samusha. Don't you think?
SPEAKER_02: yes yeah yeah yeah and um yeah strengths of one athlete versus strengths of another athlete yeah and this is where we talked about it a moment ago john has one horse in that he's got one dog in this fight okay he's got one horse in this race and it's the hand and wrist for so long john has been able to isolate and better
SPEAKER_00: opponent's hand and wrist, create problems, and then transition smoothly. That is the only thing he's got in this match. If it comes down to arm, Leonidas. If it comes down to general health, mobility, Leonidas. You're talking about this recent match, yeah. I mean, the matches that we have with John today, I just think that we are lucky to see the man still. But this man, and then the man, just say from 2006 Vegas, just...
SPEAKER_00: to talking about just maximum 60% of that guy, you understand? Yeah. So what I just tried to say, when I say like, my shape only three years ago, like, so I just tried to tell you that, like, people who think that, like, arm wrestling was easy in the past or something like this, like, I mean, like, you and I, we talk, you know, like, your prime, my prime, we would like to pull against
SPEAKER_00: Samusha, but we wouldn't want to pull against 2001 Fazzino. The stuff on him is just like just trying to hit a wall or something, you know? Yes, styles make matches. There's guys that are... Just think about this, Cobra.
SPEAKER_00: in his prime versus yeah i mean that was does mean that was a even a slight chance i don't think so i don't believe so yeah so what i just tried to say that like like just don't be like don't don't look at the calendar and think that 20 years ago people were just so weak and this and that no they were not they were not no i mean you're gonna you're gonna you gotta get we haven't talked about john walker
SPEAKER_02: johnny walker who's going to be over in florida i can't wow what a beast that man is what an absolute beast that man is that that was such a strong man so powerful unbelievably strong um yeah i i i
SPEAKER_00: I could sit here and talk all day about guys that are underrated, that were dangerous arm wrestlers. Neil, there is one guy, one silly guy. His name is Batary Juz. He says Neil has to be careful here so that he doesn't lose his job. When you're talking, just say about my arm wrestling abilities, you're giving me a favor right now, right?
SPEAKER_02: No, I'll just tell you the bloody truth. I mean, listen, just to be clear, I have been friends with Engin for literally 30 years in this sport. All around the world, we would go and speak about arm wrestling for hours and everybody going to bed, we'd be there talking in reception about matches, spinning scenarios. Why? Because we like doing it.
SPEAKER_02: We just did it. That's what we've done for many, many years. And I know Engin inside out. I've watched his career. I know Andrew Rhodes. I know Andreas Rundström, Svetan Gashevsky, Jan Germanis, Ivo Vakintaras. All these guys, you see them, you watch them.
SPEAKER_02: the individuals sometimes they're based on circumstance and how you've watched
SPEAKER_02: that athlete perform over years with janice amlins i don't believe you're gonna see the very best of janice amlins i don't believe janice is at his best or can get to his best right now but within janice you have got a technical master who is an extremely versatile extremely technically artish articulate an intelligent arm wrestler and that is what makes him so dangerous
SPEAKER_02: that's why he's always in the match and with with engen i watched engen come from the 55 kilo class 60 65 70 75 and in that period of time i watched him pull against people like ron bath when and not ron bath now not ron bath when he's in the twilight of his career
SPEAKER_02: Ron Bath, when he was a peaking bad mother and still gives problems, watched him pull guys like Eric Woffel. Eric Woffel is a goddamn giant. Giant man. And I've watched what could be done from a 65 kilo, 70 kilo Engin. Standing at the practice table and watching Engin decimate big guys around the world and I'm turning around away from the practice table, look you in the eyes and be like,
SPEAKER_02: What the fuck? And you're thinking, yeah, it's savage little twat, isn't he? That's what it's based on. It's based on experience of what I was there to witness around the world against killers. Week in, week out, year in, year out. That's what it's based on. Simple as that. Yeah, there is somebody asking, maybe a few words you can explain.
SPEAKER_02: he is asking why john is the goat he is asking the most versatile and the most long-lived career the the fact that the man is not an unusually large individual
SPEAKER_02: i've seen john compete in one weight class above me in the 85 kilo class when i was pulling in the 75s and then 80s in various competitions around north america even as recently as 97 john pulled in the 85 kilo class at idaho in the main event 85 kilo class um not a big man and yet i also saw him
SPEAKER_02: contest matches against eastern european monsters and they didn't want to come in the hook with him i watched him pull guys like rustam babayev when rustam was an absolute monster and basically allow rustam to go wherever he wanted to go
SPEAKER_02: take the match into the position that he wanted to be just so that john could experience the best of rustam and then when i'm sharing a room with with john that night listen to him lead on his bed having a beer and say that's really something that guy hits like a truck i fed him not in a braggadocio way just tell you the facts of the matter that he let the guy go where he wanted to go and then he'll do the same thing with
SPEAKER_02: Farid Usmanov, now Ferit Osmanli, in 2006, when at that time, Farid or Ferit now was a terrifying proposition. Unbelievably strong. The best of the guy. I've seen John do that from the late 80s to the present day. Neil, we can talk about the things that he has done.
SPEAKER_00: But there are some things that you cannot really express by words. You just look at him, and then as someone who knows arm wrestling, you can see how smooth he arm wrestles, how he dominates. You can see the person with the best hand control, and then somehow, sometimes even
SPEAKER_00: he loses that, he still finds a way. And he will find a way back into the match. Yeah, yeah. You would never expect that, you know, like the way that Taras put him here and then him to just go sideways beating and beating Kanai with the... And the level of comfort with which he does that is not only physical and the physical attribute, it's also the mental. It's the courage under fire. So when the guy is in terrible position,
SPEAKER_00: Still remains calm. Nobody knows arm wrestling more than he does at the table. At the table. You understand? I'm not talking about the gym training methods or something like this. But at the table, he's just like arm wrestling machine. Yeah, the best. Yeah, the best. And also, he's not only winning and he's not only applying a technique. He's doing that so smoothly.
SPEAKER_00: transition smooth, application smooth, you just watch him. Like, we, Neil, like, that is the truth, you know? People think I'm extreme, including Devon, including yourself, myself, everyone. When John goes to the stage,
SPEAKER_00: we were just watching him like we saw an alien or something. When John is dead, we were all hypnotized, just watching him and just amazed with what he's doing. The best of John is the best of arm wrestling. It's as simple as that. The guy, at his peak over decades, has just been remarkable. Phenomenal man to watch. He's...
SPEAKER_00: willingness to take on anyone and everyone at any weight, in any country, at any time. And if he wins, he loses, he doesn't care. This guy didn't really take a break, you know. This guy was competing all over. He was competing all over. And you can't. Like right now, you see the athletes, they are pulling like three times a year or something. This guy was just, if there is a good event,
SPEAKER_00: was going there and competing many many weight categories in one year he was competing many events as long as there is a there is enough prize money award that is worth to go there and compete you know and and this guy just like what i'm just saying that like you can't be all the time in good shape and the guy the guy was just going there and winning the guy was going there and winning very seldom you see and you would you would see guys go out and dominate
SPEAKER_02: guys who were a walking puzzle they would go out and they would have a move one thing that was killing everyone in their path they would be so dominant and they would be beating people with absolute ease and then john would pull with them and john would just make them look like a child just totally neutralize them just take everything away from them in a calm fluid respectful manner
SPEAKER_02: unbelievable unbelievable puller and i've i've arm wrestled john many many times when i've been strong when i've been weak and when i've been in between and you can feel you know what you're feeling you know what you're feeling and i'm telling you something different yeah of course it is all coordinated you you are you are arm wrestling with a computer
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it's a hand, but it's a, it's a timing. Just go to eighties guys from eighties. Ask them who's the greatest arm. Look at John. When John was an 85 kilo arm wrestler and he's in incredible wars with Richard Lucas. Yeah. Yeah. I mean,
SPEAKER_02: Try and wrap your head around that, guys. If you knew what Richard was capable of and you felt how big and imposing Richard is...
SPEAKER_00: And then you try to wrap your head around, how the hell did he do that? And Richard got injured on his shoulder while pulling him. That's why he quit arm wrestling. And years later, Richard comes back into the sport when he's been out of the game forever. And he's an old man.
SPEAKER_00: and gives problems to denis aplenkov yes yes yes yes when dennis is a hundred and forty seven kilos and when he can't came back it was 20 years later yeah so he wasn't his prime so in his prime in his prime john at 85 kilos at 85 imagine can you imagine samusha giving trouble
SPEAKER_02: or just mess how much is just sasha just can you imagine the prime richards like i mean no way no way no way i mean he'd run him over like a train just run him over yeah you know john john is a unicorn he's a unique animal he's something different the best of john
SPEAKER_00: was the best of arm wrestling. Yeah, this is what I'm saying. I don't understand that someone who is just part of the sport for a few years, I respect everyone, and then come and say, oh, John, come on, man. I just look at those comments and I'm like, are you serious? I mean, it doesn't sound humble, but I want to say, what do you know? What do you know? Have you been...
SPEAKER_02: fortunate enough to meet and be at close proximity a number of um high profile individuals who definitely fall into that category i mean eddie hall i'm very close personal friends with bubby one conor mcgregor would be another arnold schwarzenegger would be another who i've had the i'd have a close proximity with and the public persona of that person
SPEAKER_02: Conor McGregor, very much. The man you meet when you're not on a stage and you're not interviewing the guy and speaking to the guy publicly and in front of the camera, and the man you meet backstage when he's relaxed and calm, Conor McGregor is a very different man, very different. Conor A, Conor B, they're a different person. Even Devon, different person.
SPEAKER_02: it's it's unusual sometimes people make reads from what they see in a snapshot and that's the blessing and the curse of the spotlight isn't it you get a snapshot of a person but you maybe don't know that person so well you maybe think you know them better than you know them but if you were if you had more time under different circumstances sometimes you can try to cram a great deal of information into something i know i'm guilty of doing that
SPEAKER_02: You want to throw so much information out that you become distracted and you don't join up what you want to say as well as you could. Particularly when you're, I mean, right now I'm tired. I've been started very early this morning, been working all day, been at treatment today, various other stuff. And you are getting a snapshot. And if somebody comes in and they judge you on that snapshot, they're going to get a different, you know, they're going to take a different view. And that's sort of my fault for putting myself out here right now. But,
SPEAKER_00: The benefit that we've got, mate, is we've had access to John very closely for a lot of years, for 30 years. This guy was 60 years old, and people said, okay, but look at Tatashin, he's also 57, and he's still, you know, good. It is not like that. Totally different thing. Tatashin started arm-wrestling when he was 35 years old. 36, yeah, yeah. Yeah, so he has been around for, like, just say,
SPEAKER_00: Just say like 23, 24 years maximum. John has been around like probably 45 years. So what I just say that you don't only look at the age of the person, you look at how much miles you have on the engine. Just imagine this guy.
SPEAKER_00: Pulled Cleve Dean, Gary Goodrich, Richard Lapkus, Scott Norton, and Alan Karev, Erekli Gurkiani. He pulled... Erekli Gurkiani, my God, yeah. Yeah, he pulled against Alexey Vorolov, he pulled against Ferit Osmanlı, Pushkar, Deniz. Like, there is no single best arm wrestler. When I say single best, I'm not talking about the athlete at John's weight.
SPEAKER_00: We never, never, never, never enjoyed John pulling in his category. It was the most boring thing, you know? Yeah, because he'd kill everybody. John was a 95-kilo, 90-kilo guy, and he was pulling against the super-weight best guys. And there has never been a time in armwrestling that there was best guy and then John didn't pull. If you look at that under the microscope, yeah? How many guys in history could make that claim, Engin?
SPEAKER_00: How many guys in history could make the claim that they could pull and beat the best in the world when they were a middleweight? Nobody has been dominant even in their category all career long. Even Devin's best years were after his 30s. Before his 30s, he was not best.
SPEAKER_00: You know, he was like after 31, 32, you know, then you saw his face. You're talking about Kron from 20s, age of 20, and then
SPEAKER_00: up to like late late 2000s in this category his category the man was very very dominant and still for the super heavyweights i'm telling you you can't be pulling decades and be at your best shape all the time you know you have and the other thing about about john okay which i'm very aware of is that john has been up and down in the sport in terms of his level of
SPEAKER_02: what's the right way of putting this drive and ambition is probably the right way. And what I mean by that is put yourself in his position, right? If you were John and you show up to a competition and you beat the piss out of everyone with ease, do you think that's going to motivate you to go and work your ass off and train and,
SPEAKER_02: Push yourself harder. No. And it didn't. And John would, you know, his level would drop a little bit. When he was a young man, he was obsessed with arm wrestling and focused with arm wrestling. Different guy. Then the next chapter of his career, not as focused. When Pulling John was being filmed. So for those of us who were involved with the filming of Pulling John and we were at the competition, there was the, what you see on the film. And then there was the reality.
SPEAKER_02: the reality at that time john was beat up injured down not really interested in the sport that much was really giving it a go around because of the film then after the film is done then john has a little period of resurgence and you see the guy that showed up in 2006 who was a focus john but that just shows you what he's capable of when he committed and yet in between that
SPEAKER_02: He was still a very, very hard man to beat. 90% of people couldn't beat John, couldn't do nothing with John. Now think about that. That was 2004. We're now 2024. So that's 20 years ago. 20 years ago. Think about that. Incredible. And he was planning to quit arm wrestling. He had the elbow problems.
SPEAKER_00: perform? No, I don't know. I kind of lost my focus after 15 years. I mean, it's hard, isn't it? I mean, of course, of course, like you, after a point, like you just think it like, why am I doing this?
SPEAKER_02: yeah what about you it be it became and becomes an obsession and you love it and then you're chasing it and then you're not sure why and you think wait a minute what's that going to do it's going to be world champion oh yeah i am world champion so what the why are we doing this again why are we getting up listen after a point you again come back like i won my first rose in 94.
SPEAKER_00: And I won my last world in 2018, both senior category. Masters and senior. 24 years. After me, only 16 years. Yeah? Yeah. And then young German is only 14 years. If you're talking about obsession in the sport, guys that are utterly and completely obsessed...
SPEAKER_02: I don't think there's anybody that's obsessed from a competitive perspective. If we put in there who was the most obsessive, compulsive, 100% venom-spitting mother fluffer there's ever been in this area, I think you take that title. I mean, just the stuff we saw from you the other day when it was like, mate, you've fallen down and crashed your head into a table. Maybe tomorrow night you shouldn't come.
SPEAKER_02: i'm speaking to you on the whatsapp and i'm saying mate don't come and i'm saying to emir dude don't let him come and you're smiling i'm thinking there's no way that guy doesn't come i couldn't stay i couldn't stay i know but but it's like it was kind of like you waste your time telling you don't come because you know you're gonna come you could have you would come whatever if you're physically conscious
SPEAKER_00: Myself and Dev were talking that day. I said, he'll come tonight. You watch. There you were. You've got to be a bit nuts, and you are definitely nuts. This is about being on mission, you know. I had to go and see that everything is okay, you know. I couldn't just go and watch on paper, you know. No, you wouldn't sleep.
SPEAKER_02: You wouldn't sleep. It probably was the, on reflection, probably the healthiest place you could be was in that room, honestly. As long as you're relaxed and sat down, probably the healthiest place you could be. Because if you'd have been at the hospital, you would have been
SPEAKER_00: pissed off, getting angry, winding yourself up, it wouldn't do you any good. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. In fact, I got angry with the doctor, and that's how I left hospital. I told her, you know, they put the stitches on my head, and then I told them to take the stitches from the surgery, upon the surgery. And then she opened, and she said that, like, it still have infection, they cannot take it.
SPEAKER_00: And then they didn't close it. And I said, are we going to close here? He said, oh, leave them a little bit and I have things to do. I got so angry. I just left the hospital. Here is open. So I'm going to tell you a little story now, right? I'm going to tell you a little story. It made me laugh. So we were at East versus West. And one of the staff, who shall remain nameless for obvious reasons,
SPEAKER_02: says to me we and i i made a mistake in something i announced something i shouldn't announce right my my error my mistake so i do this and you you you're mad as hell right so and the guy comes over to me and he goes whoa neil are you not pissed off and i went no why he said i can't believe engen spoke to you like that he's yeah you know he shouldn't let him and i said mate you know who said this
SPEAKER_02: i got i'm not going to tell you the guy because you get even out of angry but a guy comes home and he says that to me says you can't then speak to you like that and i said yeah i can no no i shouldn't and i said mate that's that's what engen does that's his job that is literally what it wouldn't matter if you if we were doing an event if we were in a cafe in italy
SPEAKER_00: He still get that pissed off about anything. That's what he does. I don't remember exactly what it is, but it is probably about the event. Like I feel myself responsible. I made a mistake. Like whenever, listen, like whenever we are doing this, I am
SPEAKER_00: hundred percent tougher on myself than to anyone else. It is not personal. It is just like, we need to do this because that, that, that is why I came to the event as well, because I had to make sure that everything is going well because people pay his money for pay per view. So we need to make sure that everything is okay. I would much prefer. So, so there's people in, in my,
SPEAKER_02: in my life that i'm closer to and love more than anyone else my family okay so if i go downstairs now my wife i love my wife i'm gonna go downstairs and if i've not if i've pissed my wife off if i said i'm gonna do something and i don't do it my wife will go ape shit on me she will get angry and she'll say oh you she'll bust my ass and i love that i don't mind you know listen listen listen the conversation between us wasn't that bad
SPEAKER_02: No, mate. It was just a little fire. What I was saying to the guy was, you know Engin well, and he clearly must not do. But I said, look, if you know Engin well, Engin is the enigma of rage. He can't help that. That's what he does. He's been doing that for years. He won't threaten to cut my fucking ears off.
SPEAKER_02: You know, you, you, this is what happened. It was only barkers. They usually were going to call, but it was funny. I was, I was still arguing and we were going to go and it's funny, you know, that stuff, these are good memories. I kind of stuff. You can't, if you, if you walk past all that, if the whole thing's a go, you know, a garden of roses.
SPEAKER_00: Where's the fun in life? People are supposed to be passionate about stuff. Get pissed off. I don't care. Many of those things are because of when we were young and like a little bit, how do you call it? Furry? You know? Yeah. Yeah. Right now, like, yeah, like many of the things I told you, you know, whenever I lost in 96, Virginia,
SPEAKER_00: I wanted to cut my arms off, my hands off because, yeah, because I lost. So what I'm just saying, so it is basically just taking the things too seriously when you are on a mission, you know, but there is not nothing personal. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Thanks for understanding. And thanks for
SPEAKER_00: coming you know it has been more than two hours two hours and ten minutes and i would i would talk with you probably four hours but just we better not start another no i bet people in the chat are going get this guy off here yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah anyways neil thank you very much my friend and thank you man i'm happy that you are part of what we are doing and you are very important parts
