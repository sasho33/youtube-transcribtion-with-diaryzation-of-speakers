SPEAKER_01: is a must for our sports. Hello, Andrei Volkov.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, hair transplant. Yeah, I think it's working. I need to go and have a haircut because because I mean, I haven't been in barbers for more than a month during this health problems. Thank you, Eros. Aleykum salam, Maas.
SPEAKER_01: Thank you, Chris. Yeah, we all would like to see some matches, but we will get to see what is possible. There are a lot of things are happening.
SPEAKER_01: and some of you some of you some of these you guys are aware some of these are uh behind the doors and yeah and
SPEAKER_01: yeah guys we are here for coming versus michael if any anyone here is for something else uh i would ask them to leave the podcast because you guys are ruining the podcast so please just either focus on why you are here or i mean yeah because let's focus on coming and michael yeah thank you guys
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, Michael looks very confident. Michael decided to go super heavyweight category and looks like he will run after the tougher goal compared to 115. 115 is also very tough, but super heavyweight is another level.
SPEAKER_01: michael and carmel they are competing on august 10th i don't know we need to ask to michael uh where his shape is here hello drake
SPEAKER_01: um this match is not for top 10 because it's a super heavyweight match with right arm kamil and michael they are not in top 10. hello hello michael how are you my friend i'm well sorry how you doing good good good kind of hot
SPEAKER_00: Kind of hot, but what to do, you know? Hot days, cold days, whatever, they are all for us. We need to handle it. Yeah, what is the deal that you break, you know, everyday personal records, you know? Okay, so my theory behind it was the best I had done on Devin's lift was 154 pounds. It was questionable. Like, it was basically a piece of cardboard height that you could slide underneath. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: But then I never could do it again. And I thought, you know, I want to start doing this lift more often. So I was like, I was going to take 25 pounds off and I was just going to add small amounts every day and do it every day until August 2nd, because that's my last day to train. And because of that... What was the date? The last date?
SPEAKER_00: August 2nd. So I'll train up to eight days. Eight days, yeah, okay. And you will do max on that day? Yeah. Oh, okay. The best performances I've ever had in my life, the last week, meaning not the week of rest, but my last week of training has always been my heaviest workouts.
SPEAKER_00: and it gives me confidence I complete my heaviest circuit I complete my heaviest whatever and I know that that week of rest I'm going to heal back and I'll be the strongest I've been I didn't do that going into Gennady this is Misha say hi to me hi Misha hello hello um yeah so uh I didn't do that going into Gennady I just did a bunch for four months I just did maintenance workouts because I wanted to be healthy but I didn't do anything in training to make myself feel strong and confident so I think it affected my performance but um what's up Camille
SPEAKER_02: Hi, guys. Yeah, I'm just thinking if I am there or not, because I can see everyone separate.
SPEAKER_00: yeah i think you have to scroll over this way yeah here we are this way if you scroll one more over but yeah so engen i did i do 0.75 pounds a day and because i'm doing that i blew past the 154 and every day i just add 0.75 and i don't notice it so that's how i'm doing it but you don't feel like you don't feel like you are exhausted you know to max every day every day every day
SPEAKER_00: you don't feel like the deal they are keep going keep going they are pr lifts but i don't think they're actual maxes i think i'm capable of five to ten pounds more than what i'm actually doing so i'm just i didn't but i didn't know that like it's just i didn't know how this was going to work if every day was a maximum effort lift i think it would be tearing me down but since every day is a new pr but i don't feel like i'm maxing out i don't think it's breaking me down as much
SPEAKER_01: But that's my opinion. Yeah, but you are saying that you will be doing this another two weeks. And then if you continue, you do that every day?
SPEAKER_00: Every single morning. So I get up in the morning, I feed the dogs, I feed Misha. I come out here and I set the camera up and I give it a lift. Like there's no, I haven't eaten. There's no pre-workout. There's just no warmup. I just come out here and grab the weight. I set, I do the weight today and then I will add the 0.75 pounds for tomorrow. So when I walk out here in the morning, the weight's set, I just grab it and go.
SPEAKER_01: Wow. Wow. Feels good. Feels good. Yeah. This guy is also, he just, he likes to train heavy as well, you know, while we are. I think he just did something. Yeah. While we are, I send him the link and then he sends me this. You see the guy is standing on the weight and then he's lifting them, lifting him with the weights together, you know? Yeah. Thankfully that's left arm and that left arm,
SPEAKER_00: oh yeah the best video he's done yet is the one he did with the uh taking the preachy curl bench to the second floor and he's lifting his family and his friends oh yeah that's gold that's like one of the best things i've ever seen that was awesome yeah i mean you know tommy is coming in his family is
SPEAKER_01: a must for the community just very like pure armwrestling family with how to say like i mean happy they love what they are doing they enjoy and i mean they don't i don't think they really care like how many people like or something they are just enjoying themselves and it looks very well you know it's just
SPEAKER_01: Like, yeah, I mean, you are also, you and Rebecca also just like pure armwrestling family as well. That is what we have known you for a long time. Kami is kind of new for the, not the new, but new for the elite level armwrestling. Yeah. I'm just going to tell you, I'm a fan. I've been enjoying his content for a while. I told him just keep pushing, having his daughter and his wife involved.
SPEAKER_00: He can be one of the stars of the sport for sure. He can be one of the most recognized people, just keep doing what he's doing. And, uh, I mean, obviously we don't need him to be victorious in 15, 16, 22 days. We need, we need him to have a small setback, but then after that he can go back. Yeah. Yeah. So I don't know. I don't know what you are doing is at least like in a way that, um, um, you know,
SPEAKER_01: works the comedy is just pressing and he's really pushing his limits just like i hope he's not gonna injure his elbow and coming you be careful man i i know that you are like you know what you are doing but i mean we all say that until we hear like you know something and then it's never same again you ever injured your elbow coming yeah i i injured my right elbow about 12
SPEAKER_02: no 15 years ago and i and i find this video when i was looking for the picture with michael i find as well this video and maybe one day i'll post it i make a stupid position and my uh join just click
SPEAKER_02: So but luckily I haven't broke never anything just one time this and since then all good. But you know, everything I do I feel safe. Now the guy it was quite heavy. There was extra 20 kilos as well. But I think I can push 20 extra more I think so. It's not maximum is still okay.
SPEAKER_02: and uh yeah the the things what doing michael make me a little bit worried because he pushing himself to the limits every day now and i don't know how he will end up with this so we'll see
SPEAKER_00: I don't know, man. I'm excited. I'm enjoying the process. So far, I think I can just keep going forward. Now, obviously, if I did it every single day for a long time, obviously, I'm going to fail. And then if I kept trying to push, maybe get injured. Right now, I think the programming is working.
SPEAKER_00: I actually was wanting to set up my pulley system so I could see what I could press to see if I could match you with it. Right now, my pulley system, the table's not long enough to go from a high pulley. And then I realized I could just add a chain to the bottom and move the pulley up higher. So I'll probably try that this weekend. We got Corey coming back on Sunday. We'll get on the table some Sunday. And I think I'm going to set up a shoulder press thing. Now, if I suck at it, I'm probably not going to post the video.
SPEAKER_02: nice if it's good yeah yeah but you know i'll tell you something it's not about how much you can press or how much i can press it's about the center how much you have side pressure i would say like that you know no yeah this will be there yeah this will be the key who have more here
SPEAKER_00: yeah because controlling the center of the table you know and pressing yeah encountering your press like you said uh when i was when lars wasn't ready for it um lars and i had pulled previous and i did the same thing to him left-handed back 20 years ago and i told him that's what i was going to do now the question is are you strong enough to stop me from doing it and you might be but you know if you set up to press
SPEAKER_00: I'm going to at least one time going to go on the center table and see what happens. Either you're going to press me, I'm going to press you, or we hit the center table and we find out what happens from there. I have no idea. I know you talked to me the other day and you said you had a couple of different options.
SPEAKER_00: I really have to try to beat you. I have to try to stop you. I have to try to meet you in the center table with a press, or I have to pull you far enough away from your arm to where either your elbow falling off the front of the pad, or you can't get that good connection with your shoulder. Those are my two links, because I don't have enough drag hook to pull you the way Medeshchenko does. That's what I got. That is funny because even you thinking you have some two options to stop my press, but what about if I don't use press?
SPEAKER_00: Exactly. So if you top roll, then I think we both top roll and we see what happens from there, right? The thing is, and this is what I don't know about you, but I do know about me. If we both committed to an outside top row slip, go to the strap, and we still both go outside, is your transitional press as fast as my transitional press? Yeah, but I have a king's move as well. What? That's illegal. You can't do those anyway. I can. If you will be fighting this, I can fight this as well.
SPEAKER_01: No, no, no. When you say that, this is... I'm just teasing, Egan. I'm just teasing. I'm just teasing. Stop this conversation, okay? You know the rules. Just go by rule. You call it open arm top roll, yeah. But my arm... Yes, sir. All right. My arm will open. If you're enough strong, my arm will get straight. Your arm will not. So you have more advantages. You have more advantages about that, for sure. That's all I got.
SPEAKER_00: But I don't believe you can hold my weight on this arm. I don't believe. We'll see. I am so easy. That's crazy. Yeah, I mean, because the thing is, if you get fully committed to your spot, right, will I have enough? And that's the thing is I don't know if I'm going to be, you know, if you come press and I go outside, I don't know how far underneath you I'm going to be.
SPEAKER_00: Because when I watch you arm wrestle everyone else, they're not seeming to apply. They're just kind of keeping their elbow stationary and stopping you here. And you're getting laid on top of their arm. I will plan on going from the front of the pad to the rear of the pad, hoping to stretch you out, right? So it'll just be the connection that you get if you decide to press and I decide to go outside. You know, it's going to be interesting. I'm excited because I know you told me and you've said anything that you got something else you want to try. You want to kind of test yourself, see where you're at with some different moves. So I think we're going to have a good match.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, it's fun. The match means a lot to me, and I'm sure it means a lot to you as well. I'm amazed that the two guys that I didn't even really have to talk, just doing analyzes, you know, and talking, you know, the possibilities and everything. Just incredible, you know, just people should just...
SPEAKER_01: be quiet and just listen to you guys you guys are yeah i mean amazing yeah todd and oleg's love child michael's arm and spirits are stronger than ever that's good that's good that's what i want to be i don't want to pull weak michael i want to pull strong michael i think we both want that you know what i'm saying like if you were to beat me you want to beat me
SPEAKER_00: when I feel strong. And if I beat you, I want to beat you when you feel strong. And I think that's just the nature of the sport. You know, winning matters, but winning when your opponent expects to win or is in their best shape, it makes them win more valuable, right? When you can win against a legitimate opponent who is coming in in great shape, you feel more accomplished. So I think both of us have a great opportunity here to kind of showcase ourselves to where we currently stand in today's super heavyweight division. You know what I mean? So I don't know. I'm excited.
SPEAKER_02: yeah i am happy about you as well that you are opponent which have all options you can do top row you can do uh press and you can do maybe some hook kind of side pressure like like like dragging down so
SPEAKER_02: You know, you have all options and I can tell you as well that I have as well this option. So we can have a nice war between us everywhere. So this will be shocking for everyone who will watch us. They will be shocking what's going on because I don't want to just go and do everything what I do every time. You know, I want to change and we will see how it goes. If I am ready or not. So I mean, I
SPEAKER_01: I mean, maybe as an organizer, I shouldn't say this, but I don't see you having any other effective option than what you do against Michael. Just my opinion. Only this one I see. But Michael, I will tell something about Michael too. Again, I'm not saying you're going to win or the other guy is going to win or something,
SPEAKER_01: Michael doing open arm top row, I don't think it will end up good either for Michael. So either Michael, the way that he pulled against Lars both ways, the one was like sideway with outside, you know, but he just passed the center, you know, so quickly. So Lars couldn't put his shoulder and other one is the shoulder pressure. Like I see those two.
SPEAKER_01: as two effective options for Michael. Just my opinion. Open arm top roll and then you put all your weight. It's just, I mean, very hard to handle that pressure without bringing the shoulders
SPEAKER_01: under the table level but again for you i don't see another option than shoulder pressure either but but if like do you guys think that it is all about the power or speed uh to take the center if you guys both go in shoulder press so i will say it's about the speed but without the power you can't have speed so
SPEAKER_02: actually it is both you need to have you have to be strong and fast but you know and you are thinking i have no options but i will tell you something i have three options round one round two round three no no no listen listen but somehow somehow in any high level match we didn't see you doing something different like like you pull matushenko
SPEAKER_01: What did you do? Yeah, me? I don't know. I don't think it's because of this, but it is because you are showing us how you can top-roll in the trainings. But now we're talking about really, really, really elite level of arm wrestling. It's not the same as finding a training partner and top-rolling at the side. You may try to go outside in your hand position, but the finishing, Michael, with that game, I don't know.
SPEAKER_01: I didn't see anything with you in your career that you could do something like that that would be effective against Michael. Maybe I will learn something new. But Michael has been there a million times. I don't remember you at the elite level doing those kind of things and being successful against really elite level athletes. Maybe the time is coming.
SPEAKER_01: okay okay yeah but just remember your your time and trying is just against very very very very experienced guy you know like very experienced guy you know just that has pulled against everyone against pushkar against danius against devon against jerry like all kind of guys they pull against
SPEAKER_01: So, I mean, I think that he is much more experienced than you. I'm not saying that you cannot win this match. But I'm just saying that this press, if you put your shoulder behind, also it's very hard for me to imagine that the arm is coming back, you know. But Michael can go sideways quick. Michael can do the shoulder pressure quick. And also Michael, when he does the shoulder pressure, if he is stopped,
SPEAKER_01: is like lightning fast to go back you know and then that that in that case your shoulder pressure may not be as effective as a direct shoulder pressure with the start you know what i mean like yeah you know it it will be big test i will be testing round one run two it's
SPEAKER_00: testing. If I will mess up, if I can do nothing for Michael, I'll come back to my main game. Okay. Okay. So you're saying I'm not going to see a press till round three? Yeah. All right. All right. Hopefully I'm successful in one and two. And then all I have to do is somehow figure out your press in round three. That sounds exciting to me. Yeah. I don't know. Let me get this right. He said that he is not going to do the shoulder pressure until round three.
SPEAKER_00: That's what he said. Michael, I think you like this, but do you believe it? I don't know. I don't care. Listen, I want Camille to do everything that he can do to try to win, and I'm going to do the same thing and make the best man win. I mean, I like Camille quite a bit, so I'm excited about the match. I think it's going to be
SPEAKER_00: you know y'all know everyone knows i have very big goals um and once once this match once you and i talked about the heavyweight division and not really be a way for me to have a a world title match at this event because dodacan was injured there's nobody to replace him
SPEAKER_00: I truly am 100% committed to going to the super heavyweights and seeing what's possible. So I'm committed to at least a 24-month run to see if I can get to the top. So if I have setbacks, I just have to come back, reevaluate, keep training. But yeah, I'm very focused on finding out, even at 51 years old, just starting out for 24 months, that puts me at 53.
SPEAKER_00: I think the best is yet to come. I genuinely do. I have a healthy arm for the first time in 15 years. I have a reinvigorated spirit to pursue this sport at its highest level. And I take on every comer, every challenge, and I'm excited about it. And I think we have a great match. So don't piss Camille off too much. Tony has no options. Let's just let him come in and let's both have a good match, right? I have a question, Michael, that 24 months,
SPEAKER_01: Um, it is no matter what. You will be there for 24 months. You will try or it will depend on your results on on that way. So, this is what Rebecca and I were talking about last night. Like, if I epically fail and I lose every super heavyweight max. Then maybe it's just not in the cards.
SPEAKER_00: I genuinely do not believe that's going to be the case. I think super heavyweight is where I'm most effective. I think super heavyweight is where I have the most potential to be as strong as I possibly can. And I think if I can continue to progress and get stronger, I think I'm going to be a nightmare for a lot of people.
SPEAKER_00: Now, if that doesn't happen, then who knows? I can't, I can't tell you what the future is going to be. Cause I hadn't even really considered what happens if I'm not successful. So, um, I genuinely think that I'm excited about this match. I'm excited about the next match. I'm excited about that. You know, I mean, I'm just excited about the future and I'm going to wake up every morning and try to be better than I was the day before. Michael, like.
SPEAKER_01: Normally, if you will ask me, your chances to win title is higher at 115 and then superior weight. But from other side, I'm thinking that if you suddenly make such a decision, it just means that something is going very well after your surgery. Otherwise, you wouldn't do this step, especially this early. You just started pulling some months ago.
SPEAKER_01: And now you decided to go super. It means that you see something that makes you very hopeful and very happy. Otherwise, you wouldn't do this, especially right now. The super heavyweight has never, ever been this tough, you know.
SPEAKER_00: It's never been this deep. There's never been this much talent. And it's just like Camille said, he said this on the Aussie arm wrestle. We need to have a top 20 in the supers just so we can figure out where is everybody at? Because the top 10 is just insane. The top 10 in the super heavyweight division has never been this hard to track the top 10, right? So it's an unbelievable division. 100% without a doubt, it would be more realistic and easier.
SPEAKER_00: to try to obtain the 115 title even if devon is the champion 115 kilogram devon is nowhere near as strong as a super heavyweight levon we know this right i mean but can i be as strong at 115 as i potentially and that it doesn't even matter like is the strongest me at 115 stronger or have a better opportunity than the strongest me a super heavyweight probably still the strongest me at 115 has a better shot at devon than it does the biggest version of me at levon
SPEAKER_00: But I'm chasing greatness, you know, I genuinely believe that. And I'll say this, whether people believe it or not, or whatever. I think that God's given me an ability to endure, to to work hard, to to have unrealistic goals and dreams. And I think I can do all things through Christ. And I genuinely believe that my future is very bright. That's just what I think.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, there is a super chat Rebecca says when it is concerned about comments options, no one knew push car had the options to be Michael that he found in round four versus Michael in 2017. You know, but yeah, you're not not no one. I was there. I was like, why is he not doing this?
SPEAKER_01: The only reason that he didn't do it because of his experience from the years ago when Michael had his riser and wrist, everything. So he was actually pushing to Michael's arm. But this time the case was different. He was far enough on Michael's hand. Yeah, on the hand. And so it would be different.
SPEAKER_00: Pushkar wanted to do that already, but in his mind, the memory of years ago was playing. He was afraid to do that, but at the end, he was brave enough, and he tried, and it worked. And also, it wasn't even that he was brave enough. You and I both know because you said it yourself. In your opinion, after I won rounds three and four, you thought I was going to win the event because he had no other option other than press me. And he just took caution to win. He was like, I'm going for it, and it worked. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: He was just afraid because what happened years ago when he tried this, it was ineffective. But his position at that time and his position that time, last time, it was different. Like to apply that pressure onto your forehand and then whenever you have your wrist rise and everything, it was kind of different. Yeah. Rebecca says also, of course, I am Team Michael, but I have learned Atlas Evolve when...
SPEAKER_01: push to their limits. Yeah, of course, of course. I have a question for Kamil. Kamil, where do you see your right arm? Do you see you beating anyone in top 10 in the Open category? And if yes, who?
SPEAKER_02: that's that's what i want to say to michael when i will beat him in florida to don't be so sad because i could be like my left arm top five so maybe you're still very good michael i don't know maybe so maybe so i i think i can beat a couple of guys from top 10 and probably most of the
SPEAKER_02: Top roll guys like Georgi Tvetkov, Alex Kurdeha and stuff like that. I feel very strong. I don't have any more pain when I pull other guys. Before I have pain in the elbow. I couldn't move my arm two weeks after the fight. Now I pull in May Aslanov and I feel very strong, completely fine with my press. So I think I am very dangerous now. And my weight on my right arm go up
SPEAKER_02: a lot like 20 from last year so i i think i am very danger okay what's your body weight right now 136 kilos when i am fully loaded 137 8 kilos 36 yeah 136. you are big what was your weight when you put against uh iwan monshenko 126.
SPEAKER_02: also maybe 128 i think since january i grow about eight nine ten kilos but it's it's only only what i done i think i eat too much first thing and my creatine what i take from 10 gram to 20 gram and this could be as well the reason i put the weight on could be okay michael what's your weight
SPEAKER_00: I went to bed last night, shorts, tennis shoes, and a t-shirt at 128 and a half. 128, so you are almost 285. 281, 282. 282, 286 would be 130, so 282. Okay, okay. I think I will probably weigh in, like dress for competition, I think I'll weigh in about 293 is what I think, which would be, what would that be like?
SPEAKER_00: What's 293? I think it would be... 133? Yeah. I think I'll weigh about 133. Dress. I mean, like, when I'm ready to compete, I think if I stood on a scale, I'd be 133. So that morning, you know, 131, something like that.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know. It will be an incredible match. Stylistically, if Michael is going in his classic way, I would favor Kamil. His press is incredible, but we know that Michael has many options.
SPEAKER_01: like this after this surgery you can move your elbow you can get closer yeah yeah yeah so that really helps your your shoulder pressure right big time big time i mean it allows me to get in there much much faster so the biggest thing is that pushing yeah that's close i can't get that close
SPEAKER_00: But the biggest thing is, like he said, center the table control. If he's applying a lot of side pressure in the setup, I'm either going to have to match that side pressure or convince the referees that he's pushing me out of center, you know, whatever I got to do to get that start right and send the table. And like he said, it is both speed and power that is going to dictate who gets the shoulder in first.
SPEAKER_00: I think we both have a very good shot of pressing the other opponent. But like you said, if I hit a press and it doesn't go, I do have the ability to swing back out to a top row, probably the fastest of anybody. Will that be effective against someone who is committed to that press the way he is? We'll find out. Yeah, but whenever you do that first hit,
SPEAKER_01: you are actually blocking his hit, which is just the most effective with the goal. So then once you get out of there, also you can get out usually after your hit,
SPEAKER_01: You don't do like this, but you most likely go to the... I end up going to my A side most of the time. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So you are just taking... But just we will see. We will see. Like maybe, maybe when you do that, if he is too strong, maybe you won't have time to go back either if he hits you first. Yeah, but we will see. Just like you said, we got round one, round two, round three. So we got options. Yeah, yeah. But I love it. I love it. The way they like...
SPEAKER_01: right now um you both know everything just everything is so clear transparent you know just like just like there is nothing nothing is hitting you know just like every option is right right in front of us and then we are talking and so no no one is dumb everyone is aware of what's gonna happen and then just probably it will be up to power and performance
SPEAKER_01: performance on that day. Yeah. Yeah. And Michael, as of now, do you see someone in top 10 that you are ready for? You know my answer. No, no, listen, listen. What I don't understand is that with the people, like, I mean, Michael, like you have, like, how many rounds you beat Dennis?
SPEAKER_00: I pinned Denison Plinkoff three times. Three? Didn't he have two Supermatches, 4-2, 4-2? No, we had one Arnold Classic where I beat him on Friday, he came back on Saturday. Oh, you beat him one time and then the Supermatch, 4-2. Yeah, 4-2. So I pinned him three times. He has pinned me five times and won once on fouls. So he's got five pins on me. I fouled out once and I pinned him three times. So you pinned him three times and you pinned Pushkar probably eight times? I pinned Pushkar eight times.
SPEAKER_00: Eight times. Actually, that's not true. I've pinned Pushkar six times. Two times he fouled out with professional fouls because he knew I was going to win. I got eight wins on Pushkar. Pushkar had four. Pushkar had five wins on me if you count Zloty Tur when I had the corn peck and stuff round one. So he had five pins on me and I had eight pins on him. Yeah, okay.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, so what I'm just saying is... I've pinned Jerry nine times. Jerry's pinned me eight times. And they're not pins because Jerry got a couple wins on foul outs. I got a couple wins on foul outs, but I've got nine to eight. I've got a winning record on most people. What I'm just saying is if you are feeling healthy, I mean, I don't think that it makes sense to underestimate you. If you ask me, can I beat LeBron, I would just say...
SPEAKER_00: As of now, what I know, it's not possible. But what I'm just saying, it doesn't mean that you don't have a chance against people in the top ten, you know? Yeah, so I mean, obviously, just like Camille said, Yorgi Spekov is someone I would love to arm wrestle. I think stylistically, how many times have you ever seen one just open top rope pin me? Like, hang out here and finish me, right? Normally, you have to have a transitional press. Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_00: So if I could be anywhere in the match, I don't see how Yorgie pins me. Not saying he couldn't, I just, my mind can't wrap myself around it. Like I think I'm gonna end up out arm wrestling, transitioning, something cool gonna happen, I don't know. And Yorgie's a bad, bad dude. I have great respect for him and I really like him as a person quite a bit.
SPEAKER_00: Other matches. I do eventually want to rematch with Gennady. And I think if I'm successful here with Gennady coming off his bicep surgery, I'm coming off, you know, I've had my bicep surgery. That's the perfect battle of the biceps. I think that's a great one. Jerry Catarat, I will always be okay with pulling Jerry. And Jerry's ranked, what, number four.
SPEAKER_00: So Jerry, Gennady, Yorgie, like all those matches, I would love to pull Morozov. Awesome young man, super strong. I have to prove myself to get these matches because I am coming back from a major injury. I've had the match here with Pablo. I had Frank. I had Lars. All those guys are ranked at the 115-kilogram division. I have to prove myself as a super heavyweight contender, and that's what I plan to do.
SPEAKER_00: So do you see Kamil as like a gatekeeper? Well, I see Kamil as someone who is very, very dangerous because like he said in his post, he beat Devin left-handed, he beat, you know, Cody Merritt left-handed, he beat Dave Chafee 3-0. He's coming off the win versus Merritt Tala. I mean, the guy has, and he's fearless. And that's what makes him dangerous. If you have someone as confident as Kamil is,
SPEAKER_00: Confidence goes a long way. You know what I mean? And facing someone who's that confident, who is that strong, makes him a very dangerous opponent. So I think he's the gatekeeper. I don't even know if gatekeeper is the right word. I think he's a legitimate contender. He's definitely in that, you know,
SPEAKER_00: like a match i'm sure he would like back like he lost at the east versus west paul fire versus sergey kalanchinko i would like to see that match i'd like to see them pull because sergey's doing really well that's the match i think would be cool to run back i think he you know that would let him know where he's at especially after sergey's done there's a lot of matches for camille there's a lot of matches for me um i think the winner of this match is going to prove and solidify themselves as a legit super heavyweight um threat
SPEAKER_00: Maybe not to the number one or maybe not to the top five, but you have to consider the winner of this match. So you are saying the winner of this match should get someone from the top ten? I mean, it only seems realistic to me that the next goal for both of us would be to pull somebody in the top ten. Would you agree, Kamil? Yes, yes. But, you know, Sergei, he's my friend. I don't want to beat him now. Maybe later.
SPEAKER_01: yeah okay am i your friend am i your friend do you want to beat me too i mean maybe later maybe later i mean if you say that i will have to remind you that he beat you at the qualification last year it was very a close fight it was very close yeah but how how how long was the fight in strap uh no there was a little bit but
SPEAKER_02: I make mistakes there and I have my arm, not 100%. I will say now I fix these mistakes. I fight different and I think I will have a good match with him. But like I say, I want him to grow. I want me to grow. So maybe we can see later ourselves. Maybe. Yeah. Yeah. I understand. Yeah. And who do you want to pull after Michael?
SPEAKER_02: Someone in the middle. I think George Tsetkov is very good because he's only top roller. Michael, I asked him, who do you want? And he's choosing someone from top 10. Is he going to beat you to get someone from top 10? Yeah, but you know, I listen Michael and he wants exactly my opponents. I want Morozov, young, strong man.
SPEAKER_02: I want to pull him. And I don't know why he wants pulling these guys what I want to pull. No, that's strange. I want to do it on the right arm. I think you want to do it on the left arm. No. You might want to do right as well. I want to do right arm as well.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, now let's it's just I'm excited. I'm I'm personally excited about the landscape and depth of the super heavyweights. I like I like my contract with East versus West and King the table. I want to be as active as possible. So yeah, I like that. There's a lot of options.
SPEAKER_00: I'm going to tell you the truth. I don't think neither myself nor Camille are planning on losing this match. So obviously, if you ask us who we want to wrestle next, it's someone in the top 10. I don't know what happens to the guy who doesn't win this match. I don't know who his next match is.
SPEAKER_00: You know, now you even motivated me more to win you because you want to pull my guys. So I will do my best to make sure I will pull them first. There you go. How old are you, Kamil? Are you late 30s or early 40s? How old are you? I forgot. 38. 38, yeah. So you got to respect your elders in this match. You got to take it easy on me because I'm old, remember? Yes, I will. Hello, sir.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah. Okay. Okay. That's interesting. I have, Michael, like, just think about Morozov, just think about Georgi Strelko and Kamil. Who would you think that is the stylistically best for you?
SPEAKER_01: Best? This is going to sound odd. Stylistically, I think Jorge is the best match for me. And Jorge is ranked higher than everyone. Then which one is harder? Morozov or Kamil? Which one would you prefer?
SPEAKER_00: Okay, so this is another question. You're not going to like this answer either. I would prefer to put Morozov because a victory over Morozov gives me a higher status because of Morozov's ranking. I don't know who's, because I don't really know how strong Camille is. You know, for all I know, for all we know right now, Camille beats everyone from 15 to 6. For all we know, I beat everyone from 15. We have no idea. You know, we don't know. I feel strong. I don't know. I don't know. There is one guy that I don't know.
SPEAKER_00: That guy. Vitaly's in that list too. Vitaly's a bad dude. Vitaly's like eighth or something. How the hell is Vitaly eighth? Vitaly sitting in eighth place makes no sense because we all know how strong Vitaly is. Yeah, but listen, how can I rank him? How can I rank him above someone that he never pulled? I'm not complaining about your rankings. That just lets you know how deep the class is that someone as proficient, as strong as Vitaly is sitting in like an eighth spot, right? That just tells you the super heavyweights are unbelievable and they've never been this deep.
SPEAKER_00: Because he beat Revas, and then he beat Morozov. So when he beat Morozov, he took Morozov's place. But the other guys, he didn't pull yet, but he will pull. Oh, yeah. Like I said, I don't know where Camille's at, so I can't say who's better. Obviously, I would choose the higher-ranked person. If you gave me a choice, if you're like, you pull this guy, this guy, this guy, I want to pull the highest-ranked guy. So the victory means a little bit more because it's a higher-ranked person. Not necessarily that's the better person. It's just the person who currently sits highest in the rankings.
SPEAKER_00: And I think Camille probably feels similar to that as well. Like the higher rank person you get to arm wrestle, the more glory, right? Okay. From the ranking perspective, you are pulling against someone very tough.
SPEAKER_00: No doubt. Like, I mean, I think I'm going to win. I think I'm going to win. But I bet Camille thinks he's going to win, too. And that's the fun thing about this sport is you have two guys. And I forgot like I forgot about this for a long time because I really rarely was on the losing side. Like for a long time, I won most of the time. Right. So I forgot that you go to these big events and then there are times that you come home and you didn't win.
SPEAKER_00: And once I started experiencing that, it sure is not that much fun. It's a whole lot more fun to win. Michael, how do you want to win me? Tell me. How? How do I want to? As fast as possible. As fast? As soon as they say go, it'd be over with. That's how I want to win. Michael, but you know how fast I am. You think you can be faster than me? No offense intended. I honestly think I'm faster than you.
SPEAKER_00: I think I'm fast. This is no offense, you know, he's so kind, you see? I think I'm faster. I think I'm the fastest super heavyweight out there. I genuinely think I'm the fastest super heavyweight. Oh, that was fast. Okay, maybe not, maybe not. That was too fast. Kamil, Kamil, whenever you show me, you show me with your left arm. Behave yourself. I will tell you why. Because I save my right arm for the right time. Oh.
SPEAKER_01: You don't want to show everything with rice. Okay. Okay. Look. Ready? Oh, wow. Okay. Way too fast. Way too fast. Yeah. So, Michael, okay. I'm canceling this match. Who do you want me to sit here against? No, don't cancel. I like to see Florida, Miami Beach, you know, very nice. No, I'm canceling the match. I will find another opponent. You are too good.
SPEAKER_02: No, no, I won't pull Michael. You know, especially after you told me who he beat in the past, how many times he beat Pushkar, how many times Denis Tsiplenkov. Now I love to pull him, really. I want to pull him. You want to pull Denis Tsiplenkov? No, Michael. I actually do. I do want to pull Denis Tsiplenkov. So if you can set that up in the future, that would be great.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it looks like Dennis is not going to pull anytime soon. You know, we are common friends. And I think I think the guy either needs time or I don't know. We will see. But I don't think I hope we see. I hope we see him back in top form, because obviously the sport is better if we have Dennis Implincoff. He's an amazing athlete, a real legend in the sport. So the reason I want to arm wrestle him is not I don't want to arm wrestle.
SPEAKER_01: If he's not strong, if he's strong, I would love to pull him just because we have that history and I would love to run it back sometime. But yeah, I mean, Dennis is awesome. Michael, you saw his match with Vitaly? Yeah, I was there. The question is, the first question is, did you expect such danger from coming against Vitaly?
SPEAKER_00: This is the first one? And the second one? Okay, you go first. A lot of people stylistically thought Camille would be trouble because just like a lot of people stylistically think Jerry Catarette's going to be trouble for Vitaly when they arm wrestle because he's committed to a flop press and Vitaly's going outside. So I wasn't surprised with Camille, especially after seeing Camille and what he did with Tobias. I was so impressed with him after that. I doubted him previously and then I saw that performance and I'm like, oh yeah, I'll just vote for Camille from now on because...
SPEAKER_01: That shit was crazy. Okay, what's the second part? The second part is like whenever you see him like this performing and then you say you like your chances that you're gonna beat him. Is that because you don't think that his right is same as his left or is it because you are not Vitaly and you have different options?
SPEAKER_02: I'm going to say it's because I think my right is as good as his left. I will tell you something. Just imagine I was like 50-50 with Vitaly. Whoever starts first, they win. On the left arm. And Vitaly says his left arm is better arm. And I've got same like him. And now look what he done with Morozov with his right arm. So just imagine.
SPEAKER_00: How could be my right arm? I don't want to imagine that. Michael, he is constantly trying to intimidate you. Are you intimidated? I'm excited for the match. It could be this weekend. I'd be in the same stadium right now. I'm just right arm wrestle. It's going to be incredible. And Michael, you saw the list of the matches.
SPEAKER_00: Which team will be winning more matches? How did you see it, just honestly? Or close? It's hard to pick because you gave us some really good matchups, right? When I say you gave us really good matchups. So look, you got Matt Mast versus Lars Robben. Now, Matt Mast is an amazing arm wrestler. He's a great arm wrestler, very technical, very sound.
SPEAKER_00: But Lars, they did pull 11 years ago, and Lars beat him 5-1, right? So which one has progressed more? Which one's progressed less? Which is going to be the same outcome? I mean, you want to vote. As an American, you want to vote for Matt, but I don't know. You got Dave Chafee versus Frank Lamparelli. Now, Dave Chafee, of old, who was the hand-control, inside-side-pressure-style puller, you think murders Frank Lamparelli.
SPEAKER_00: But now because Dave has so much, has to do so much top rolling back pressure, is his hand superior to Frank's? I don't know. Because we don't know how much level. But the question. Been repressed from Dave. I know that. When Dave Chaffee pulled Vitale.
SPEAKER_00: Once the match stopped, he was able to press. Do you think that Frank will be strong enough to finish Dave? I have no idea. You see what I'm saying? What I'm just telling you, these are hard matches to pick a winner because I don't know. We're going to find out in the day. I want to say that America is going to win the most matches because of the way the matches are set up and everything.
SPEAKER_01: but like I said I think I'm gonna be Camille there's a chance Camille beats me so that's that's one I mean it's a very difficult card what do you mean there's a chance coming you mean three percent right two and a half two and a half did you hear what he said yeah but he is completely wrong East will win
SPEAKER_02: 75 to 25 percent east will win but does does it include your match yes of course right of course yeah of course yeah okay i am sorry for you guys but it's life you know life is tough life is tough thank you for that okay another question will it be hard uh to
SPEAKER_01: travel to Orlando and pull front of near a thousand people and 99% of them sporting the Americans. Will it be hard for you, Kamil? It will be hard to get there, but when I will go on stage, I'll just think one way. One way. That's all.
SPEAKER_01: Doesn't matter how loud they will be. I'll just think one way to go. But, you know, to get there, I'll be tired for sure. But I'm going three days before, so I should be all right. And Michael, this time you guys are not the ones traveling. Long travel, jet lag, nothing, you know. And then how are you? Like, how do you feel? Like today I asked you.
SPEAKER_01: Jerry and Jerry said that he feels stronger when hundreds of people are supporting him. How do you feel? Do you feel like this kind of sport, very strong sport, is unnecessary pressure or it makes you even feel stronger? I usually draw power from the crowd, like the energy from the crowd. I normally thrive in that situation.
SPEAKER_00: This one to me is a little bit different because my belief, not even my belief, just my, I'm just in a different place. My sister's coming down to watch. My sister's gonna fly down to watch me. My daughter's coming down to watch. So, and I know my mom's gonna be watching, right? So, and I've said this, this whole thing for me, this whole goal, this whole comeback,
SPEAKER_00: I'm not trying to prove, you know, it's not how awesome Michael Todd is. I truly believe this is how awesome God is. And I think God's going to work through me. And it doesn't mean I'm favored necessarily. I just believe that I got a very bright future ahead. And I think I'm excited to arm wrestle Camille. And I want us both to show up in our best possible form and make the best man we can. Do you think that
SPEAKER_02: God may be helping Tommy instead of you. I think... Yeah, repeat to him, please. Go ahead. I didn't hear it. I think Michael forgot how big is my chest and my shoulders when he saw me in Dubai. They're very big. Yeah, they're very big. I'll be a little bit bigger. I'll be about 30 pounds bigger than I was in Dubai. Oh, okay.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, there is a super chat. Skyler Brooks arm wrestling. Love this match. Tommy, I think you will have a long day. Good luck. I will have a long day if I will want to have a long day, my friends. And if you don't want to have a long day? I can finish this in 0.2 second. That's really fast. That's really fast.
SPEAKER_01: i love it like it's very very good that you guys are super respectful and super how to stay positive and at the same time super confident and i i love it it's not toxic but you both are just so confident with yourselves i i love it i love it he's just like yeah i will i will tell you guys only one match
SPEAKER_02: When I go to fight, I was thinking I will lose and I lose. Other matches, I was thinking I will win and I win. And one match I wasn't sure because this is top guy in the world. And I was right. It was like very close. It was Vitaly. So now I think I'm going to win and this nothing will change.
SPEAKER_02: And how about your match with Ivan Matyshenko? How were you feeling? That's what I feel. I was scared of him because I knew it. He's so experienced. He was like 10 years ago where I am now or even more. So I knew it. I can be done by him. Easy, quick, fast. Do you think he was faster than you? Yes. His reaction, everything was faster.
SPEAKER_02: And I was fighting wrong technique with him. I was scared to go in hook and this was my big mistake. I should go in the hook. But I learned too late. Did you know that they compared the measure, Michael with Ivan Matsushenko and Michael is faster?
SPEAKER_02: now michael compared this and he uh slowed down uh even twice faster than him for sure i didn't do the edit if someone else slowed it down it wasn't me ah okay okay okay okay that's that's that's that's interesting yeah and i heard that you and iwan
SPEAKER_02: did left arm pulls after the event and whoever was faster was winning. This is what I heard from Ivan. No, when I asked him, can I go in my press and he let me and I pressed him and he couldn't stop. So, you know, it was just simply test. But if in the real match, if I can get there, I don't know.
SPEAKER_02: so so you don't know if you can get there or not so yeah because you know he could be so fast on the left arm as well but after that what i saw with reno i am not so sure if he's so fast i think his right arm is faster yeah were you surprised his performance against morozov yes uh you know i thought morozov is number one but now shows like
SPEAKER_01: we are everyone number one i heard that morozov is uh has been injured you know i think he won't be able to pull till next year and i don't know is that on the left he won't be able to pull till next year on the left left left is injured yeah that is injured the right is uh probably ready maybe right arm
SPEAKER_01: he versus Kamil. Kamil is looking for this. I like that, yeah. After Michael, after Michael. After you beat or lose Michael?
SPEAKER_01: No, you can say to us like that. Whoever wins will get Morozov. So I'll be fired up. You know which match I think is good for Michael? If Michael beats you. Gennady versus Michael. Because Gennady is also making a comeback. And Michael just like not even a year. And then I think it would be good. I accept. Yeah. But just beat this guy first.
SPEAKER_01: Like I said, I said. It means that it's done. It's done. We have both good motivation from Anglin. Me, Morozov, you, Gennady. Nice. That's good motivation. That's good motivation. It would be incredible. Yeah. Let's talk quickly about the other matches. First of all, John versus Leonidas. Who first?
SPEAKER_00: It's hard to ever bet against John Brzenk. Leonidas is a very strong young man. You have to think that it's a 60-40 John Brzenk. If anybody can figure it out, it's John. Kamil? Yeah, you know, I would love to if John will win, but I will say can go other way.
SPEAKER_02: But mostly if Leonidas will win, he will win with his endurance and so strong power of biceps and even pronation. His pronation is very strong as well. So 50-50, I would say. 50-50. Okay. And Michael, you said things, but you're not sure. Dave Chaffee versus Lamparelli? I say 55-45 Dave Chaffee. Come in.
SPEAKER_02: I'm not sure how strong is Frank Lamparelli now, because when I pulled him one and a half year ago, I didn't really feel him strong in press. And now he has difficulties with Michael and I don't know how much he improved, but I think Dave will win.
SPEAKER_02: I think Dave is still a little bit higher in the ranking than Frank. I think still. So I will say Dave probably will win this one. Okay, this one is very important. Alex versus Jerry, Michael.
SPEAKER_02: gotta love jerry but alex is impressive as i think it's 55 45 alex okay and you coming yeah i was watching today his practice someone put video for minutes on youtube and he doesn't look like i like him to look so i don't know really
SPEAKER_02: i hope he is enough strong and i hope he will win because jerry oh you hope the jerry yes i hope because he have my technique and i want proving that press is danger so and and actually jerry is the guy who like started in me press so i can call him like my daddy you know daddy jerry
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I remember six years ago, I sent him message. I start pressing and he sent me back. Keep going, brother. One day you will be champion. And I will keep going all the time. You know that he says this to everyone. Oh, really? I'm joking, joking. So nice, man. So nice, man. Anyway, so who's winning? Jerry.
SPEAKER_01: Jerry's going to win? You just said that you don't think he was strong enough or something? No? Yeah, but I still hope he will win. Hope is a different thing. What do you think? Yeah, I think Alex will win. Okay. Jerry, you heard that? Oh, shit.
SPEAKER_01: anyway so no i i yeah i i hope jerry was very tired on this training and that's why he looks like he's talking about the video yeah come on come on come on just he's just doing like outside move or something do you really believe that he trains that way
SPEAKER_01: No, no, but when he pressed, he couldn't, then he go outside. I don't know what's this. This is what I'm saying. Do you really believe that he, like, whatever you saw there is his... I don't, I don't want to, I don't want to believe this. I don't want to. No, no, I kind of believe that they even post this just to confuse people. If this is the Jerry that is just struggling with those guys, you know, no disrespect to those guys, but they are not anywhere close to Alex.
SPEAKER_02: I mean, I would cancel the match right now. Just don't believe that. That is not the Jerry that is coming to Orlando. Because he doesn't post so much and whatever he posts, it just gives some information, you know, how he is. But I don't know. I hope we will see.
SPEAKER_01: And then I can pull Jerry. Press, press. There you go. Okay, so. 60-40 Pauline. Wow. How much the patriotic Michael is talking? How much objective Michael is talking?
SPEAKER_02: Me, I think Rustam is back and I think he will be winning this time. Pauline looks incredibly strong, but I think Rustam didn't waste his time. He was training very hard last year and I think he's so strong.
SPEAKER_01: I think he's incredible. Paul, the way that he beat Lachlan in Dubai was very impressive. Yeah, that's what I mean. It was impressive. The reason that I asked you, Michael, is no disrespect. I'm just trying to figure out how much emotions are moving. Because I know Michael, he is close friend with Paul. But even if he really believes it's 60-40, I understand. I'm just making sure.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I thought she was asking somebody else if that was emotional. No, I genuinely think Paul Innes is that strong. I truly think he's that strong. Yeah. Okay. So, Todd Hutchings versus Prudnik. I think it's 65-35 Todd Hutchings. Oh, okay. And I like Prudnik a whole lot.
SPEAKER_00: The Prudnik at 105, or the Prudnik we have now is not the Prudnik that he pulled last, or even the Prudnik that Devin pulled, in my opinion. I think Todd Hutchins is going to 3-0. Do you think that there is any possibility a different Prudnik to show up? It's five weeks. Yeah, do you think that five weeks
SPEAKER_01: Is there any possibility of five weeks to make some difference? I think anything is possible. I just think it's not likely. Anything is possible. I just don't think it's likely. When you say it's not likely because you don't think that Brutnik makes different decisions or is it because it's not enough time? I don't think it's enough time for him to get the strength that he needs to be at. Okay. And Kamil? You know, Evgeny is saying he will be different.
SPEAKER_02: because it's Kalina training him. So what I understand, I think he's training another technique which could help him to win Todd. But I think even if Todd will lose the wrist, he will get straps and the straps he will beat Eugenie. I think Prudnik have no chance with Todd Zila because now Todd looks like he's crazy. Strong. Okay.
SPEAKER_01: So, Craig Tuller versus Tom Hollands. I would say Tom Hollands. That is another body of yours from like 30 years ago. Yeah, Kamil said Tom Holland, I say Craig Tuller. Oh, Kamil, you said Tom Hollands? Tom is very strong. I know, I know. But do you know Craig? Not really. You don't know? Okay. The only thing that can hurt Craig, in my opinion, is elbow fouls.
SPEAKER_00: If he keeps his elbow down, I think he wins. Yeah. I don't know how to describe him, but bullets maybe, huh, Michael? Yeah. He is a tenacious young man. I mean, he has been at this almost as long as I have, and he has got, I mean, he bleeds arm wrestling. He gives it all he's got. So a motivated Craig Tuye is a very hard person to beat. Lately, he has been in incredible shape, yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: And okay, Justin Bishop, Giannis Amoris. 60-40 Giannis. I mean, I'd like to say Justin, but Giannis is such an amazing arm wrestler. Okay, Kami. Yeah, I think same, you know, I think Giannis is just keep working on himself and he looks every time I see him, he looks bigger, stronger and everything. So I think he preparing to be
SPEAKER_00: Big champion. I think Giannis will be. Sorry to cut you off there, Camille. The thing is, Justin has beaten Giannis before. That was 11 years ago. But the favorite, in my opinion, is Giannis. That does not mean that Justin can't pull it off. But if you're betting, I would say 60-40 Giannis. I honestly think Artem's the favorite because he's a bigger man.
SPEAKER_02: Right arm or left arm? Mindaugas is amazing, but I think Artem's a favorite. What arm are they pulling? Right arm. I think it's a very close match. I would say 50-50. If the match was at the same weight or something, Mindaugas would be a favorite.
SPEAKER_01: One is 76, 77 kilos. The other one will probably be 87 kilos on the competition day. So let's go. Let's go. Paul Talbot versus Resh. Most people think Resh, but I think Paul Talbot. Okay. Can you explain to us, like, how do you see the match? He will get the positioning.
SPEAKER_01: The breast can hold like this against the super heavyweights in North America. Like he's a freak. But I think Paul Talbot will run sideways to his hand. And if he needs to throw a shoulder behind it to finish, he will. So you are saying that unlike those big arms, super heavyweights hanging on the muscle, he will have close angle and then he will use his joint after he got good position? Pretty much. That's what I think. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I think Brest will win. This match is what I saw with him in the past. He looks amazing. And I don't know the other guy, how strong he could be. I don't know him really much, but I think Brest is very dangerous. Okay, let's go to the last interview and finish. One second.
SPEAKER_02: Elizabeth versus Alexandra. I saw, okay, I saw Elizabeth in life and she looks very strong, but I have no idea how is Alexandra strong. So it's hard to give prediction if you don't know the opponents, to be honest. So I don't know. I think Alexandra is more technical, Elizabeth stronger. So I think Elizabeth 60-40. 60-40 Elizabeth. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Okay. And Jonathan Breda, Aymeric Predans. I think Jonathan's stronger. I think Aymeric's a better arm wrestler. So 50-50. I will go for Aymeric. Okay. And... Okay. Ryan, how do you pronounce his last name? Bellinger? I believe that's it.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, and Riemanns, Lierpins. Riemanns is 86, 87 kilos, while Ryan is around 95. I'm sure Riemanns will be 90 kilos as well, till the time. I think Riemanns has way more experience, but the Ryan kid may be stronger. So 50-50, I don't know. I think Coach Ray is winning this one.
SPEAKER_00: He seems to be on the last couple of competitions really good. So I think his form is great. And I think he can get this one. Okay. Matt Mask versus Lars. Can we talk about it? But you didn't say a clear prediction, Michael. Just because of their past experience and how Matt struggles against a flop press, I would say 55-45 blunders.
SPEAKER_02: I will say as well that Lars 55-45 to Matt because Matt doesn't look strong last times. I don't know. Or maybe he has strong opponents like Brandon. I don't know. Okay. This one I want only percentage. Michael Todd versus Kamil Jabnowski.
SPEAKER_02: 97.5 to 2.5. 97.5 to 2.5. Namaste. I will be nice for you, Michael. 55, Kamil Jablonski, 45, Michael. Well, I like that, but I had to stay true to you. You said 3%, so I said 2.5, so I had to stay true to what I previously stated, right?
SPEAKER_00: it's gonna be a good match honestly our i think our match could be a banger and i think with both of us having the uh the belief that we have both have multiple options we could see a whole variety of arm wrestling on the table you know what i mean so it's exciting you said you're gonna leave me in 0.2 seconds so that's pretty fast yeah that's how it should be no one of us going to lose so you know that's how it should be everyone should think i am winning simple right
SPEAKER_01: last last two matches are uh west versus west matches so one is um hunter versus now i will come to that later hunter versus douglas michael doug ehrlich is a incredibly strong arm wrestler but hunter nos has really impressed me a lot lately um
SPEAKER_01: Until I'm proven otherwise, I have to say 55-45, Doug Ehrlich. Okay. Do you know these guys, Kamil? Are you familiar? Maybe I saw them, but I don't have big knowledge about them, so it's no point for me to say. I will tell you a match that you know, Kamil, both guys. It's the last match. Travis Badgett versus Corey West. Oh, nice one.
SPEAKER_02: Actually, I can pull them after Michael, you know. No problem. There you go. I want to find out how strong they are. And from my point of view, Corey West, it will be stronger than Travis. But Travis could be very sneaky. And this can happen 50-50, I will say. I think Travis have chance to win it, but...
SPEAKER_02: Corey could be stronger. If Corey is very... If Corey will have a good corner man, the corner man will help him to do right decision in the match, which can help him to win. I think like this. So you think that Corey should be deciding this during the match time? Yes. Yes. We'll see if
SPEAKER_01: To see the grip, the position, if he's losing the wrist or whatever. Yeah, maybe his corner man is someone that Travis has pulled already many times so that maybe corner man doesn't need to see it, already knows it. I may be right, Michael?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, unfortunately, I won't be in his corner because I'm going to have to focus on this guy right here. You can tell him already, right, during the training. Of course, of course. I think it's 65-35, Corey. I think Corey's too strong. I think Travis has every mental game, every mental advantage. Corey doesn't get as aggressive in some matches. He needs to be aggressive in this match. I think he's the stronger human, 65-35, Corey. 65-35, okay.
SPEAKER_01: okay so these are the all matches everything we went through do you guys want to say any last word to each other before facing at the table yeah i'll say to you michael don't stress too much don't work too hard and
SPEAKER_02: and be ready just just be ready you know because if you'll be over trained i will be disappointed that you are tired or you're broken or something i want you fresh strong and you know it's only two and a half weeks you know three weeks three weeks so not long so long in this time you won't get so much power so you know just just have a rest and and wait for me
SPEAKER_00: yeah i appreciate the kind words but i'm going to keep doing my training for the next two weeks god willing i won't get any injuries i'll be super strong when we show up uh safe travels to you continue blessings for you and your family and i'm excited to find out who the who the better man is on august 10th so let's see what happens tell me one last thing you tell him to get the rest and this and that i mean will it change anything
SPEAKER_02: You know, that's what I will do. I will rest for him two weeks. I will be doing nothing. And my joints, my muscles, my whole body, I will go to physio, massage, everything. I will be super fresh for you. So I think I will be strongest as I can. You know, that's not what I'm asking. Like what I'm just saying, if Michael trains hard or rest, will the result change? No.
SPEAKER_02: i want him to be i want him just be not 96 i want him to be 100 okay even though nothing will change right the result will not no no only only only if you'll be nice to me i can give him maybe one point we see oh thank you
