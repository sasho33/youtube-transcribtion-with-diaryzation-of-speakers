Host: Hello guys. Waiting for my guests to come.
Host: I think in a minute they will come. I think Rebeka will not be with us because of
Engin Terzi: I think she catch cold and she said, hello, how are you? Can you hear me? Yes. Now I hear you. Hi. Hello. Hello. How are you? I'm good. How are you? Uh, I got called last week and today is the last day of quarantine tomorrow.
Engin Terzi: Okay. Hopefully I will be able to train finally. Did you get Corona or is it just a cold? No, no. It's COVID. Oh, it's Corona. It's cold. Oh, okay. Okay. How was it? Was it bad? Yeah. The beginning was terrible. Terrible. Yeah. I just couldn't even get up from the bed. And, but now, now I feel, uh, better, better. Hello, Anna. How are you?
Anna Grönlund: Hi, I'm fine. Hi, Anna. Hi. Anna, you will be looking at there or to us? I can look to you. It doesn't matter. This is my computer, so I have Zoom on it. Usually when I have a meeting, I look at the screen and not the customer. How are you, Engin? Getting better, getting better. Yeah. Yeah. I've tried it too, so.
Engin Terzi: Rebeka said she got cold and she doesn't feel good and she said she will not be with us. She said hello to you ladies. Okay, so we are waiting for Angie to join us.
Anna Grönlund: But that was sad. Rebeka didn't want to join us. I mean, she said she is ill now. Yeah. Yeah. Better to be ill now than in two weeks when she's about to meet you. So you have to see it from the positive side. Yeah. Yes. So I was everything I was preparation.
Fia Reisek: It's going good, I think. And what about you, Fia? How do you feel? I feel good. I also got a cold after the holidays and I'm not used to being sick now. We have been like totally free from sickness over two years now. So it's like, what is happening to me? I got like and I'm coughing and I have a headache and
Fia Reisek: i was a little bit scared that that wouldn't go away but it just lasted a couple of days and now everything is fine and i'm preparing uh how good i can now yeah unfortunately uh right now we can't be so idealistic you know we can't do
Engin Terzi: I mean, as we wish, you know, during this like times that, you know, would come once in a hundred years, you know, and then so. Hello. Hello, Angie. How are you? Welcome. You hear us? Hello. Hello. Hi. Hi, guys. Girl, I feel major.
Engin Terzi: So I was saying that we can't be like, I mean, perfectly ready, you know, anything can happen during this time. And so I need to pull John in Norway, March 18, and I have been laying in bed because of COVID. And I mean, I'm already heavily underdog and now I don't know how much this will help, but let's see, you know, but the subject is about you ladies now. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: um and you don't know um rebecca will not be with us she got called and she doesn't feel good so but she said hello to all three of you yeah yeah so yeah so these four ladies rebecca including rebecca are the only ones that will be participating as female arm masters
Engin Terzi: it will be it will be very nice between all those male arm masters it will be great to have for female colors and it will be honored for me to host all of you um so very soon very soon about two weeks yeah when we will meet so how how are the proportions and you ready
Angie Rose: I'm feeling pretty good. The important thing is I'm feeling healthy. That's always a challenge at times when you're working out and you're a little older, you feel like some pains a little more and they tend to linger a little more.
Angie Rose: So and when you are preparing for a match, at times you tend to get a little excited and there's a fine line between pushing too hard and resting, taking those needed rest days. So yeah, I think I found that balance and yeah, I'm feeling really good and I'm so excited.
Engin Terzi: like what a wonderful opportunity and an honor it will be it will be my honor to host all of you i think i think um you run michael rebecca renee and john they you all are coming on same time as far as i know i think john yeah yeah yeah yeah it will be a very strong team yeah very strong team coming from
Engin Terzi: North America. And yeah, if you start with you, Fia, what do you think? What do you think? You made a decision to compete at the toughest arena, to Zouave, and not because you want to take any political side or something. You just want to compete where the best is, the strongest. And then that is why you did that. And you won. You won convincingly.
Engin Terzi: It was very impressive, especially versus the Kazakh puller. But your opponent also did some great job versus Galatkaya. She also won convincingly. Maybe like a little bit struggle at the start and then finish with the side pressure. It's very hard to do that to Galatkaya. So you will meet each other at 70 kilo now. And I kind of see it's like a great, great, great, great matchup.
Fia Reisek: What's your opinion? I've always considered Rebeka like one of the strongest arm wrestlers ever. Have you seen the final she had against Gabby in 2019? Yeah, she stopped her here. It's a long fight.
Fia Reisek: with Gabby and you don't see that very often with Gabby. But then she weighed 80 kilo and now she's down to 65, 70 then. So that's why I wanted to have 70 kilo because I don't want Rebeka in 80. No, no, no. We need to make everything, you know, at the very high level world competition,
Engin Terzi: know those those categories make so much difference you know like people say that the weight doesn't make difference of course if you bring the best of 70 kilo versus 100 kilo no one the weight will not matter but when you bring two best in the world then the the category is really making uh that that five kilos can count uh a lot actually yeah yeah yeah yeah uh so i i mean um
Fia Reisek: Rebeka is one of the best. I was preparing a competition myself because I didn't have the chance. I didn't think I had the chance to meet all these great ladies. So I was preparing for a competition in December with all my favorites. And I invited Rebeka for that, but she said that
Fia Reisek: and i had the minus 80 kilo and she said no i'm down to 65 so i'm thinking yeah so she she turned me down then so it's it's going to be really really fun meeting her uh she is one of the nicest arm wrestlers too uh so sweet and uh yeah
Engin Terzi: That's the best thing about female. You can call each other sweet and this and that. Can you imagine the same thing is happening between the guys, you know? Imagine that the guy is saying that, oh, you know, Michael is so sweet, you know. He cannot be saying, no, no, no. He cannot be sweet. That'd be fun to hear that. Yeah, yeah. I was going to invite Rebeka versus Sarah Beckman. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: yeah the first east versus west and there she told me you know i'm not 80 kilo anymore i'm 66 kilo yeah that's when i found out in last may you know when i was trying to find an opponent for uh sarah yeah and and what's what's your weight now 70 are you yeah i'm 70 yeah 70 yeah some people are asking me um if i'm feeling any better yes thank you guys i feel better um
Engin Terzi: Yeah, thank you. And if we go to Anna versus Angie, you ladies agreed everything between each other about the weight, about the arm, about everything. I didn't have to do anything and you are going down, losing weight. How is that going? Going well? I'm closing in on where I need to be.
Anna Grönlund: It is a fight because at Christmas I was 93 kilos. So I've had to work to get where Angie wants me to be. But I've done a great job and I will meet the requirements from her side. And I've seen her and I think that she is bulking, if I'm not mistaken.
Angie Rose: she's watching your camera always make it look better than your ankles um i am slowly gaining uh
Angie Rose: and you have to eat the bloody horse i'm a grazer i usually um eat a lot throughout the day but yeah you have to be so disciplined and sometimes i make myself eat those boiled eggs and god i don't care for boiled eggs but i'll make myself eat one or two more than i usually do and yeah i'm a fairly light eater to be honest usually the grazing
Angie Rose: getting there um have you ladies ever meet each other in a competition no not a competition we met each other uh in turkey i think it was three years ago now at the world 2018 2018 yeah did you guys compete there no i was one weakness above andy at that point yeah
Anna Grönlund: oh okay okay so i've only ever held her hand in a hallway that's all oh yeah hello we have no clue yeah no like can i touch your hand you know like the arm wrestlers do can i feel your hand like a bit that was it yeah you would know you would never know that you know a few years later you're gonna pull her no if you knew you knew you would check a little bit huh yeah i probably would have checked it a bit better at that point but no yeah
Anna Grönlund: So I have no clue what I'm up against. And I don't think that I think it's going to be really fun and very interesting. And I'm very humble about the opportunity to share the stage with all these really, really impressive people. And it's just amazing opportunity. I'm very thankful for it. Yeah, I'm happy to have all of you as Sweden arm wrestling television.
Engin Terzi: One of the best guys in the sport. Just turning into the show, your matches is going to be a pleasure to watch. He always supports female arm wrestling, always. He's a great guy. He's the one who made the video clip, the official video clip of the 2018 World Championships in Antalya.
Engin Terzi: the one that was turning up all the time you know yeah yeah yeah he made it yeah yeah yeah so um if if we go if we go to do if we talk about the event i'm you know normally when i invite guys i try to steer the pot between them but now i'm afraid to do that you know so i won't i won't go there so
Engin Terzi: Because, um, yeah, um, uh, it is no good to mess with the ladies about that thing, you know, but if it was Morozov here or the other guy here, I would just steal the pot. You know, I would just ask provocative questions. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But, but now I better not. So, um, but we can talk about the other matches. Uh, are you, um, uh, following male arm masters as well?
Engin Terzi: Yes. Some of these. Yeah. And Angie's not so much. Maybe the Ron's match. Yeah. Well, I follow Ron's. Ron's and I do. I follow the men's arm wrestling a bit for sure. Yeah. Are you familiar with any of the matches that, you know, the Western guys are going to have with the Eastern guys? Me? Yeah.
Engin Terzi: Oh, yeah, absolutely. Do you know Genadi? Do you know Zola? Do you know some other guys?
Angie Rose: I know those names, absolutely. I hear those names a lot, especially, you know, listening to the men talk about them. They're some of the greats, for sure. But to follow them, I don't. I'm kind of in my own little world sometimes, and I got so much going on in my life, like cats. I'm ruining my house. Hold on. Oh.
Angie Rose: eating my plant yeah I live with 14 cats right now oh my god you're a crazy cat lady Angie I breed cats Maine Coons now 10 kittens right now and they leave here in a week and I can't wait oh god I love I love them but a lot of work but anyway yeah what can you tell us about the
Engin Terzi: ron's shape and his thoughts about uh his opponents like like like can you tell us like like honestly you know just like does he think that his chance with right is higher or left higher or i think ron's been working on uh things he usually doesn't work on uh fine tuning you know a little more uh
Angie Rose: intricate strengthening tools. He's always done the side pressure and more about power, but now he's focusing more on the finer tuned
Angie Rose: movement to get where he wants to be exactly yeah um he was fighting a bad cold too actually but uh he's feeling pretty good right now and and he's feeling pretty confident and like i said what a great opportunity
Engin Terzi: so winners we want to win but uh turkey gosh just can't wait i never dreamed i'd be going back to turkey so yeah and this year this year waff again will be in antalya yes yeah wow yeah i heard fantastic yeah anyway so um you know ron ron is one of the true legends of our sport and
Engin Terzi: um if there is any opportunity that the opportunity is not for ron but for his opponents you know because ron is a legend you know if if they are pulling ron they they are they are lucky they're lucky that they will be holding his hand and you know trying to beat him yeah that is the the the absolute truth about ron betts you know these guys ron ron john these these guys are
Engin Terzi: um the ones that i grew up by being inspired of them and you know i will never deny this because that is how the things go if you are inspired you know you need to share it maybe some guys will be are inspired by us and it just goes like that you know yeah yeah pretty clear and fear since you have been pulling love forever so you are uh probably
Engin Terzi: familiar with many of the athletes they will be pulling here is are there any of them that you know you have opinion you have some idea about the the outcome or is there any match um that takes your attention you know i'm talking about the uh-huh another cat you know it's not fair i had a cat four years ago
Anna Grönlund: she died no three years ago she died i cried like you know crazy and now you ladies both are showing me the cats all the time just hide them he's just a baby still and he's very he likes to want to be in the picture all the time i'm very sorry trying to give him away yeah so i'm i'm curious about the match between chance show and sundry cities i think it's going to be interesting
Anna Grönlund: I think that Cendris is very, very dominant. So if you think that Cendris is dominant, then how do you expect it to be so interesting? I still think I know nothing about Chance, like his background. I haven't seen him pull a lot more than in the US, so I don't have anything to compare with. And that's why I'm curious. I'm interested in how it's going to go. Chance right now is in Sweden and training there.
Anna Grönlund: Yeah, I was contacted by him today because they are traveling and they were interested in the tests and how it was to go with the restrictions and stuff. So I had a discussion with him today and he told me he feels really good and really strong. Best version ever. Sorry if you're leaving now. I don't think that they're leaving yet. I think that they're leaving like in a while. He and Emil from Sweden are going together. So that's why they asked me. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: You know, in fact, you know, this is another matchup that, you know, they decided together. You know, I didn't really set that match. They just talked. They said, you know, like, is that okay? I said, yeah, just go for it. You know, if you both think that, you know. Chance asked me, I said, Sandris is a very strong guy. But he said he wants to try. He believes in himself. And looks like he is confident. And Sandris is confident as well. So we will see, you know.
Fia Reisek: and yeah i was asking you yeah which matches like are you interested you know actually i think it's a really good idea that you have east against the west i think that is the the biggest thing to because uh east i always heard that east is the best uh and
Fia Reisek: and if you see them in the european championships and and in the worlds they are dominant but we haven't seen all these stars from west actually competing against these guys all the time we have they have these world champions in the us or canada and we have the world champion in east so i think it's really interesting just to see who is
Fia Reisek: the best arm wrestlers is it west or east it is so i don't actually have a favorite match except for mine or anna and angie's uh i'm really looking at the ladies i think we are the most interesting uh but but the east and west thing i love it i like i like the concept about that yeah yeah yeah
Engin Terzi: Looks like you ladies are not going to give me anything about the male matches. I am, though. I'm really curious. So Michael Todd versus Kennedy. Yeah. I know that Kennedy hasn't been competing for a while. How long has he not been competing? Some years, probably since 2018. Yeah. He just had a super match in Dubai versus Ermes. And now this event, there he lost.
Engin Terzi: And after that I talked with him, he seemed very, very aggressive. He seemed like, you know, he's just, it was like a mistake of him. And he said that, you know, like, this is like two injured lions. This is, this is what I see, you know, Michael was just the one in the hills versus Ermes and these guys claim.
Engin Terzi: to be one of the very best in the world. So if they want to continue to be around there, you know, they can't afford to lose twice in a row. So that is why that match is a very interesting match. There will be hounds of horsepower there, you know. And yeah, I can't even imagine that whenever, you know, the referee says go, the pressure, my elbow already hurts.
Engin Terzi: A lot of determination for sure. Yeah, because both guys are warriors there. They can pull any position and they have big hearts. They are very brave. I mean, yeah, I don't know. Genadi thinks that he made a mistake in the last match. He said he's not going to make the same mistake again. And then we will see old Genadi. And I believe that he knows
Engin Terzi: know what is going through so michael also has bigger bigger uh dreams you know be like beating levan so he can't he can't afford any accident on his way to there so i don't know yeah we will we will see are they competing in the same weight class or how much you are super overweight you know you can expect them to be the same weight but um michael i think he's about 100
Engin Terzi: 30 maybe a little bit more or around there um yeah no no he's more than 130 he's about yeah he's about maybe 135 or more and gennady is probably 140 145 yeah and yeah and yeah let's see let's let's see how it will be there is there is one bad news okay bad news that i'm i'm going to share now in fact i
Engin Terzi: um ask cody to not declare yet because i am working for a replacement but you guys know that cody broke his arm right about one and a half years ago yeah he broke his arm and they put the the metal plate today he called me that you know for some time it has been bothering him and he went to doctor and then the screw was loose and then probably cutting him you know yeah i talked with john john john brusing today he said that
Engin Terzi: he realized this when he pulled him last time with left arm probably training. And so Cody is, cannot be competing, but I have some replacements and thinking it will be probably as good as Cody, you know? Yeah. Yeah. It will be probably create the same excitement, you know?
Engin Terzi: And, but just, I'm just trying to confirm it, confirm it before I confirm I can, I can say, you know, the name, but for sure we will find someone, you know, but how, what can you do? This is about the health, you know, health of fellow arm masters. You can, I mean, the guy is real deal, you know? Yeah. And then, yeah, if he, if he has that kind of problem, I mean, to ask him to pull would be like big, uh, I don't know.
Engin Terzi: someone only who has no love for arm wrestling can ask him to continue pulling in such a way. So I hope that the fans will show the same understanding. But again, we will hopefully, it's short notice, but there is someone that I'm expecting a positive answer soon. If he accepts, then...
Anna Grönlund: nothing will be lost except, you know, Cody, but probably he will be with us, you know, no problem. Health is the most important thing. So, because if something happens to his arm now, it's, it's beyond repair if he's unlucky. So better save yourself for, for the future, even though it's very sad. Yeah. So health is the number one thing. But, uh, I'm thinking Ron Waff and Efe, was Efe the guy that got injured in Waff?
Engin Terzi: yeah in the world yeah yeah and how is if they're doing now is he okay no the pain is gone yeah of course he's not ready to pull with right arm with left arm no no no no oh no he will pull with uh run with left arm he's gonna pull yeah he is yeah he pulled herman stevens in the first east versus west yeah and now yeah he's gonna pull run and by the way um you didn't answer that but
Engin Terzi: the um ron thinks his chances is higher with left or right um he's a right hand man yeah his right stronger than his left yeah but his left is feeling strong right now so and healthy then so he has no opinion about it he's coming to win right and left
Angie Rose: Oh, he'd like to win both, of course. Yeah. That's when you're at the table, you're not, it's just, I'm going to pin that person. I'm going to win. There's no negative thoughts of losing if you're up at the table. That's out the door. I'm hoping to win both. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: He has his right arm opponent is also tough. Zurab Tauber is a normally 85 kilo guy. The other day he sent me a picture on scale. He was about 103 kilo or something. Yeah. He's just also, but Ron is heavier, probably 112 kilo. Let's see. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I was expecting Fia to give us a little bit more about the other matches. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: she's just like i don't care about anything except the female matches you're right you're right okay you you guys you ladies are like almost pushing me to start provocation yeah we can do it together you and me against anna and andy i'm so bad at that i'm sorry i'm just like yeah i'm telling oh they are so sweet you know
Anna Grönlund: Anna, what do you think about Fia versus Rebeka? I think this is my honest opinion. I think Fia is going to be very dominant and I think she's going to finish Rebeka very quickly. That's my prediction. And this has nothing to do with Sweden? No, not at all.
Anna Grönlund: absolutely not i'm actually this is my i'm strongly believing that i have felt fia's arm so i know what it's like yeah yeah actually the first competition i ever went to fear i met you you remember that golden arm i've never competed before i was very very fresh i've arm wrestled for three months anyone felt strong i i think i think
Engin Terzi: Anna is going to feel me on Sunday. So maybe if you talk to her on Monday, she will say different. We're actually going to train together on Sunday, me and Fia, because I'm going to Sweden. Oh, really? Yes. Wow. Wow. So give her good training to beat Angie. Listen, you guys, you ladies didn't give me anything about the male matches. Now I will be tough. I will.
Anna Grönlund: cause all the problems okay keep going to each other but the last time i saw um zoloev he was pulling in the last east versus west yeah yeah and he looked really really strong i haven't seen jumper sink live like in a live match so i can't really compare those two but i'm having a sneaky suspicion that solo will be dominant against john yeah
Engin Terzi: hmm anna started giving some predictions about male matches because she doesn't want me up on her i actually it's because i like engine so much and he's been nothing but helpful to me the last year so yeah i'm having a hard time being mad um how many times have you pulled uh gladfire oh yeah um
Engin Terzi: don't know should i know that you know look at that you know last time last time we were in norway i asked her how many how many titles she has she doesn't remember she doesn't remember which she won what he asked me asked me to 93 my first wall till today i would tell you every place every final match everything everything i would tell you she doesn't even remember it's the same as egglet
Engin Terzi: Egle, about 10 years ago, I invited Egle here to pull Sarah Beckman and there was a press conference and the journalist asked question to Egle, how many more Kylos you have? She's like, after 15, I stopped counting. She had so many. But that fight, they didn't pull, did they? Was there?
Engin Terzi: Did a glance are pulled no not super much yeah in Turkey, why I might miss that totally when. 2013 and same place Carolina better simple. Illusion. Aha.
Fia Reisek: You don't even remember your matches. Come on. How could I remember other matches? Yeah. That's sad because I really wanted to see Egle versus Sarah. How did it go? 5-0 Egle won. Okay. But now it might be different. I don't know. I don't know.
Engin Terzi: i think i think in my opinion egla has the best ever left arm for sure yeah for right arm then you go makewa gabriella egla it's just like yeah my opinion my opinion yeah yeah yeah i mean you you could be there too but you you are too light for them um i'm not there you need to eat morphia pound for pound you are there but how about irina and
Fia Reisek: you but you remember you remember her beating you and you remember yourself beating her yeah yeah we pulled we pulled both european and worlds and i uh i started to pull in 65 when did it uh um what's it like
Fia Reisek: 2012 or 13. not no ah doesn't matter i i started to pull in 65 around that uh year and then she have always been in 65. so and then i have also pulled in 80 and 70 in between some where but i've been mostly in 65.
Fia Reisek: So a couple of times, a couple of pools a year we have done. And you remember that it's going both ways. You beat her, she beats you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And that's really fun because sometimes I have beat her in left and she beat me easily in right. And like the year after, she beat me really easy in left and I beat her in right.
Engin Terzi: So yeah, it's been up and down. Yeah, I understand. But when you see that Rebeka also had some comfortable win versus her recently, it qualifies her to be a tough opponent for you, right? Yeah, you know, as I said before, she is one of the strongest arm wrestlers
Fia Reisek: in in she is in the top strongest like with egle makeva and sarah i think if she just had some weight then she really is yeah it applies for you too i mean if you count for pounds for weight category if you judge it yes yeah i agree that yeah yeah
Fia Reisek: Yeah. Yeah. Do you have any prediction you feel like you're going to win? Uh, it's like, and you said that you have to be confident in this when you are this near the competition. I, I have been struggling a lot with thinking that I I'm losing all the time and
Fia Reisek: and that i don't have a chance and so so i really try to be confident and try to see myself winning but even if i see myself winning i see a struggle i see i i think it's gonna be really tough really really tough yeah
Engin Terzi: so great match your your your savior came the the prince with the white horse this is sweden arm wrestling television to save you says fia has over five world titles and pia has more wins over irina on left than on the right in a super match fia would be the winner
Fia Reisek: over irina and it has nothing to do him being from sweden okay did you say that too yeah thank you but how many years have you been pulling fear uh almost 30 years almost 30 years yes that can't be correct how old are you i'm soon 37
Fia Reisek: Oh my God. Yes. Just amazing. Yeah. I didn't compete when I was seven though. I like, I think I started to compete when I was 10. Yeah. Wow. It's just amazing. It's mind blowing. Yeah. That's why you don't remember all your titles. I don't have that many though. So I should remember that. I remember, uh, how many and,
Fia Reisek: and so but i don't remember where and what year but that's probably my brain damage or something more than i don't care that's hundreds and hundreds of matches though too maybe thousands of matches yeah soon maybe i can be good you're too humble it's not good
Engin Terzi: And Angie, what are your best wins? You are Canadian national champion, right? Yeah, Canadian champion. The Arnold a couple of years ago, I went to finally.
Angie Rose: Well, it was neat. I went to WAF, that was amazing. I qualified to go to WAF many times, just didn't get over and I really regret that. I started arm wrestling when I was about 17 and arm wrestled a lot in my province of BC and a little bit in Alberta, but that was more wrist wrestling.
Angie Rose: called wrist wrestling went down to Petaluma to the world's there and won that and then I did it for a few years was on top and then I got married had kids got into well it's always into horses but trained barrel raced rodeoed for about 16 17 years and completely got away from arm wrestling
Angie Rose: and uh and then that old spark came back and i got back into it when we moved to kamloops and um hair straight back just got quite committed to the sport and um challenged myself went down to the states arm wrestled some of the big guns down there and made my way finally to number one in north america in my weight category
Angie Rose: So, but yeah, I regret, I wish I hadn't left the sport and I wished I could have gone to more WAFs. Definitely. That's where it is. WAF. Yeah. And how many times did you come with WAF? Once. Only in Antalya, 2018? Yeah. I finally made it to WAF and what an amazing experience.
Angie Rose: I wish, yeah, it would have been neat to compete more with the European girls, too. That would have been amazing. A true test of how good you are, really, is competing against the Swedes, the Russians. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Amazing athletes. So this is a big opportunity.
Angie Rose: and i don't know where i am you know how much longer i'm you know arm wrestling and arm wrestle until my body says ain't no that's enough i think i've got a few more years in me
Angie Rose: But, and the love still there and the passion and the drive, especially when you have a match up like this. Boy, this gives you incentive and motivates you big time. Because there, I was kind of losing a little bit of motivation too, because nothing was really going on the past couple of years. COVID's been rough on us. And, you know, you get excited about a tournament and then boom, cancel.
Angie Rose: So a lot of people have missed some great opportunities. We had a huge tournament coming up in Alberta and that was canceled. A lot of the Europeans, I believe, were coming over. Gabby and there are a few big guns coming to that. Yeah. I mean, hopefully, hopefully we will make it February 12th and we will write the history, especially in this hardest time.
Engin Terzi: times you know i can say because of the coverage it will be it will be a big success you know just not the level of the event is i believe incredible but to do this in this hard times you know will be another success for um all of us yeah yeah everything everything will be great and i really hope that everyone will live there with what they deserve and let's see let's see how it will be
Engin Terzi: there is a question devil reaper hello engine and everyone yeah um what is your thoughts on jacob everett and jordan seal overall right now much love to you all and good luck thank you um they are talking he's asking about jacob about and jordan seal do you know them
Engin Terzi: yeah no i don't think yeah yeah yakup i know yes yeah yeah jacob jordan seal yeah i know i know jacob jacob for like more than 20 years you know he has been even silver medalist at waf i remember 2000 virginia i think right on left he took second to young germanus
Engin Terzi: As far as I remember, Jacob is old school arm master like me and great guy, very strong, especially in hook. Yordan is a top roller. As far as I know, he has incredible hand strength, top row strength, maybe not as good in strap as I heard. Maybe I am wrong. The North Americans would know better.
Fia Reisek: And you said that you know Jacob and you don't know Yordan, right? Is this what you said? Yeah, I might know Yordan too, but I'm really bad with names and with no face, then it's... I'm sorry. But I have to... It's fun when they are so different. One is a hook puller and one is a top roller. Yeah. So, yeah.
Engin Terzi: um fiat do you know who chelcaso who chelcaso from oleg chelcaso you know you don't know oleg fear pushing my pension limit this is 70 kilo multiple times world champion from russia you you ladies want we asked to
Engin Terzi: remember the the ppl arm wrestling and you don't know legendary athletes from there i hope that i hope that you know bet kili oniani yes i do no no no no you don't get involved i don't say anything i'm sorry yeah i you you know i i know who they are i can remember people when i see them
Fia Reisek: Oh, I bet you don't know who it is. It's a lot of guys. It's a lot of girls pulling in this event. So it's easier to remember when it's two ladies pulling against when it's like ten men matches and everyone's name is Oleg and
Engin Terzi: and that's why uh give me a picture and i will say i've seen that person before i can't i can't believe this i can't believe this you don't know listen listen but you know who john bersing is right good good yeah yes he's he's kind of a hero you know yeah yeah yeah yeah he's the the the blonde guy with blue eyes
Engin Terzi: You don't need a picture of it. I don't need a picture of you. I'm being hard on you because you are ignoring the rest of the matches, you know.
Engin Terzi: See, you see, Anna did a good homework. See, if I let her, she will be giving us all the predictions about the male machine. I'm going to study this list when I look into it, and then I will give you the predictions. But not for this interview, right? Not for this, because this interview I thought was about us. Yes, it is about you, ladies, but whenever I invite,
Anna Grönlund: Those people I also ask about what they think about the other matches. But now I'm intentionally being hard on you. With all rights. I'm ashamed. I admit that. I'm just messing with you. I think I want to defend Fia a little bit. I'm very interested in social media and I follow a lot of these guys. I follow their training. I follow their wins.
Anna Grönlund: And I don't think that Fia is so interested in social media as, for example, I am. So I want to come to a resolution. It is being interested in arm wrestling. Yeah. But if you are interested in your, your like your own social media, then you get to follow all these guys and you can actually, you get face to the name. I think that's a little bit easier. At least I am very interested, but it's because maybe, I don't know.
Engin Terzi: that's at least my guess here and and also the names sounds different when i hear them than when you say that oh yeah so now it's my fault right so it's engine's fault then yeah okay yeah i didn't believe it okay if i put if i put pressure a little bit more pressure
Engin Terzi: Fia is going to say, OK, I cancel the match. I'm not coming. Yeah. Anyway, so and Fia, what's your opinion about the match between Anna and Angie? Oh, yes. At least now I can tell you something.
Fia Reisek: i haven't pulled anna for a very long time i follow her on social media actually and angie i have not pulled either i have never felt her and i also have followed her and i think she i think angie is the strongest or best
Fia Reisek: female arm wrestler in north america if i don't uh are totally wrong but i think so probably together yeah yeah but i think i consider her swede yeah actually i think in minus 70 or in that weight category i think angie is the best uh and have been for
Fia Reisek: as long as she has been pulling. Super strong and super... I think... I think Angie has that confidence and she seems so calm and she seems like she knows what to do and she believes in herself. Anna is a little bit more...
Fia Reisek: nervous nervous yeah a little bit more nervous and i think she i i can feel that anna can be stressed up uh and i hope she don't i hope anna can can keep the calm and also her confidence uh and then if she do so and believes in herself and don't get stressed uh
Fia Reisek: i think this match the first match is gonna be the the most interesting one and it's gonna be a struggle and after that i think they have decided who will be the winner okay do you mean that the first match is gonna happen whatever happens and then the rest will go the same way uh yeah then they know i think they will feel how to
Fia Reisek: the one that will win feels the first match how how to win and then it will be the same turnout i think and and what do you think that your son will do who will pull who he will touch on hutchins okay sorry um
Engin Terzi: yeah i saw oh you're not alone fia thank you i saw todd training very recently so i think jordan is in trouble what's the january january what's that mean it's swedish i think it's hello hello hello hello okay yeah yeah okay
Engin Terzi: um fia didn't remember jordan sone because of my bad accent so yeah and what do you what do you think about this oh my god you have to speak english you know his name is yeah multiple times world champion from georgia yeah yeah yeah yeah that one
Engin Terzi: i know yeah that one yeah yeah that guy has the hugest arms i've ever seen compared to his body at least when you see him on pictures um if like phil if i saw a picture that is the opponent of ron
Angie Rose: I'm sorry. Oh. Oh, yeah. Yeah. But I think he's a lot shorter than Ron, but he looks really massive, I have to say. Very stout, but short, like 5'8". I heard. I know that. He should be interesting. It'll be... Yeah, Ron should have more leverage. Yes, for sure.
Engin Terzi: What was run, run is 6'3"? Yeah, about that. 6'3", yeah. And Zurab is probably 5'8", or 5'9". So about, there's about 15-something, you know, between them. Yeah, Zurab will try to force him in hook. And I don't know, I don't know where run is run. Maybe we'll try to top roll him. If not, then he can go hook, even with shoulder pressure. We will see. We will see, yeah.
Angie Rose: Tough one. Yeah, interesting for sure. Yeah. You always look so much bulkier when you're that height, too. 5'8", 6'3". Ron's pretty lean, too. Very lean. He told me about, like, he's about, like, what, 245 pounds or something right now, I think, Ron is. Yeah, around there.
Engin Terzi: yeah yeah yeah that's around 120 kilos or something who is that around 120 kilos 12 kilo 112 okay yeah 242 is 110 so he's about 246 so 100 yeah yeah i i i'm just just thinking about to ask another male athlete to pia you know just yeah do it go for it i'll see if i can tell who it is
Engin Terzi: a lot of pressure yeah how about morozov do you know morozov yeah yes you know yeah it's a multiple uh world uh champion no he's not okay i i think one time uh youth world champion yeah okay yeah but that's good you know there's a kazakh guy you know very near i mean two meters height
Engin Terzi: Looks like Ivan Drago from the Rocky IV movie, just blonde guy with blue eyes, just ripped 130-kilo guy. Yeah, he will pull Prudnik, but you know Prudnik, right? Yes, I know Prudnik, I know. Yeah. That's one you do know. Yeah, Prudnik, and they are going to pull right arm, left arm. He was going to pull Cody Merritt, but Cody...
Engin Terzi: as i said you know yeah his left arm yeah got injured and and you know gasparini for sure yes i know yes yeah me too do you know do you know arif arif artem you don't know right world super heavyweight champion the turkish guy that won the super heavyweight in uh last two ups uh what say one more time his name is arif arif artem he's the superhero champion
Engin Terzi: From Romania, Romania, the 2019 and also the last Romania, because last two WAPs were in Romania. Yeah, he's gonna pull, he's gonna pull Ermes Gasparini. Okay. Yeah, but you don't know the Turkish guys, so you cannot have opening problem. Yeah. I know, I know Turkish team. Yeah, you know, yeah.
Engin Terzi: yes yeah but but since you don't know which one it is between 115 people and anna you have you you are the only one looks like you know the one that was uh some and i knew that you was depressed in this position so she have been studying i think oh i have not been talking about this before i actually it's because i'm very curious i look at their trainings and no no no no no tell us
Anna Grönlund: tell them the truth you know before the before this live i gave all the names and information to hannah yes i can imagine that onion is the tricky guy here no but the arif artem is very much i'm interested in too i think it's going to be very interesting to see arif is really good
Engin Terzi: I saw the last time when he pulled my mask, I was there and watched it live. And he was, it was interesting, of course, but this will be even more interesting, I think, because RF is really good. Yeah. Right now he's in good shape. We will see. Yeah. RF is right now about 150 kilos, about 230 pounds. Yeah. Yeah. My God. And he's very strong. Yeah. Right. Yeah. We will see. We will see. It will be a good, good match. And let's see how it will be. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: And you are thinking that Zoloev, you know Zoloev, right, Fia? Yes. Yeah, good, good, good. Okay, one match, one match, only one match we found that Fia knows both athletes, John Wilson and Hajumrat Zoloev. Tell us your opinion. My... You hear before I said that John is my hero and I'm cheering for him.
Fia Reisek: in his every time but it's hard to know I don't know how he is really if he is as strong or he might not be as strong as he was when he was the strongest but I have no idea how near he is that and if he is
Engin Terzi: near and if he is confident in his himself i think uh also it's gonna be a good match yep yep yeah thank you very much thank you very much yeah yeah and angie do you know zolem i know the name first east versus west when he beat uh katashins
Engin Terzi: Oh, Todd Hunt? He beat Todd? Yeah, he beat Todd. Yeah, he beat him. And this guy, Zoloev, I think 14 times WAP champion. And he's one of the 14, yeah. You know, it is kind of a little bit harder than winning in female classes, you know. Yeah, a little bit, you know, because when you go to male classes, you will see 30, 40 guys, and then about 15 of them were
Fia Reisek: candidate for the medal. Of course, female categories are very hard as well, but the number is a little bit less compared to the male categories, but I don't know. We have not as much wait time as you guys. What's that? We can't chill as much as you guys. When you are like 40 people in your class, it can take like 50 minutes between matches.
Fia Reisek: And that's not the same in the women's category. You have to pull directly. No waiting in between and no breathtaking. You're just up on the stage all the time. Yeah, but do you realize that when the numbers are getting less and then 30 guys eliminated and then 10 guys left, then our competition is getting as busy as you're talking about. That's true.
Anna Grönlund: But it is a big difference between men and women. The classes are so much bigger. I went to a competition last weekend and there was no women, but I attended a men's class of my own weight class, like minus 78. And there were nine men, but there were no women. So it's very often like this.
Angie Rose: I think I'm the only female puller in BC and I think it's been that way for oh quite some time now so that's why I went started going to the states in Alberta we're so far away from each other so I practice with the men because that's and I love it but that's all I have
Engin Terzi: women just really interested in the sport and a lot of them aren't aware either but yep yep yep and there is only one one uh other canadian that is competing this event is that he won uh beer man you know right can you repeat that you don't know beer man no one of us
Anna Grönlund: Ewan, Ewan, Ewan Bergen? Ewan, Ewan Bergen, yes. Now I understand you. Or Canadian. Do you know Schoolboy? Yeah.
Angie Rose: everybody knows him he's gonna be he's gonna pull school boy yeah yeah great yeah yes that'll be interesting school boy what is he in his 20s 20 now 22 this year just a baby just a baby in heaven i think kevin's in his 40s maybe even early 50s i'm not sure but a lot of experience i know that he's been pulling for years
Angie Rose: That I know. But he's way east, the other side of Canada, Evan. I'm way over the west. So we have our own west versus east. Uh-oh, someone's trying to phone me. Oopsie. Get rid of that. And the same thing is for the schoolboy. You know where the schoolboy is from?
Engin Terzi: scopo is from part of russia that is right by japan you know it is even even even uh farther than korea you know he is even at the more east of korea i look at on the map you know it's just like far away you know you would never think that you know it's almost on the west side again yeah yeah yeah it's like right right by the japan you know yeah
Engin Terzi: this is here in north korea and then he is even at more east east coast although uh there is a land of russia you know you know by the uh it was what's this it was his last year like now 2021 was his last year in youth yes i can't remember what the result was for for the world's left arm
Engin Terzi: He won with right arm. He took first place with right arm, yeah. Because I remember him getting medals, so he is fairly good. I don't really agree about that, like, 21, 22, being a kid, you know. Before I turned 20, I won senior world titles, you know. In my time, there was no junior category, no youth category. We directly competed the seniors. And I didn't even, like, finish 20 when I won...
Engin Terzi: senior world title. I don't understand that. And all those guys were adult guys. You know, I remember Ertem Klymenko, he was 16 years old. He won the, he won the world championships in, um, uh, in us walls. And I don't know, in 2002, you were there. Yeah. I was, I was 17. I want to. Oh, you want to go? Yeah. Yeah. Thanks.
Engin Terzi: european yeah yeah and and you were how old were you then uh 18 years old only 17 17 okay yeah yeah because it is about 20 years ago and you said you are 38 yeah okay no third i'm 36 i'm almost 30. you are 26 you are 36 sorry sorry i thought you said 38 yeah anyways uh ladies um
Engin Terzi: um i got i got kovit i'm sorry hardly hardly you know um sitting sorry about it that if i couldn't make it any more uh exciting uh but then it was fun to mess with pia about the male arm wrestlers yeah so it will be it will be great to see you ladies very soon in two weeks in istanbul uh i will meet you ladies at the airport and then you will be taken to the
Engin Terzi: where you will stay and anything you would like to add about the events? Just that I'm humbled. What's that? Yeah, thank you. I'll try to, when I'm there, I will definitely pay attention to the other matches. Don't be like Fia, please. Well, I already care.
Engin Terzi: i will tell you when we arrive i will tell you every prediction i can yeah you will study now yeah okay not now but before you come yes yes right now i will go and check i would expect someone like legendary arm master to know about arm wrestling naturally not not just because someone is asking you know
Fia Reisek: no but i i i will help you on sunday fear when i meet you i will help you to study a bit oh my god this is so bad i will never attempt this thing again no and do the homework before that yeah i will do the homework okay yeah okay okay so
Engin Terzi: okay um there is one more thing they may be asking who is their favorite arm masters uh what is this dm thank you for the super chat fias is john bersink and maybe probably someone else maybe i have uh my favorite arm wrestler is definitely irina makeva oh yeah yeah and she will always be yeah
Fia Reisek: the queen queen queen of arm wrestling huh yeah she is and she is uh and after her is heidi of course yes yes you know when i when i started arm wrestling uh heidi was my uh favorite female arm wrestler yeah yeah yeah yeah no she's not pulling she's training a lot uh but she's not
Fia Reisek: uh pull she's pulling for fun but she have no uh right now she has no thoughts of going back right she's a warrior warrior yeah yeah i i think i think majority of the female arm masters from sweden were inspired by her this is what i believe yeah i think many people have been inspired by her
Anna Grönlund: not only in sweden yeah yeah and anna yours john brzenk or female i would have to say marlene klein smith why do i why do i always mention the guys you know just wait a second and i'm not done yet so female i will have to say marlene klein smith because she has always been
Anna Grönlund: I don't know how to put it very helpful, but in a kind of teasing and fun way to me, she has a very big place in my heart. And she's always, if I'm going somewhere and I'm nervous, she's like, I'm sure I'm here. So I really like her for her personality, but also because she is a really good puller and she's been doing this like forever. Main one. I have to say you, Mr. Hanging in Tennessee, because you have the same kind of warrior and lion heart as myself. You have that fire. Yeah.
Anna Grönlund: Yeah, and that passion and it's few people have that fire and passion, so I would have to say you. Thank you and and and Jay.
Angie Rose: Well, I have, well, Mal and Fia, those are some of my favorites for sure. And one person that really motivates me, I watch her on social media a lot is Sarah Bachman. Ooh, she fires me up seeing all her exercises and the way she pulls some of the men and she's sweet of course, but yeah.
Angie Rose: Yeah, pretty amazing. Gabby, more than one, definitely more than one female. Yeah. And then male, well, gee. I love her.
Angie Rose: ron is well just so much respect for the man the longevity he's been doing this for how long he's going to be 60 this year and he's so he's still up there he's beaten guys a quarter of his age and still competitive yeah and john brissing can but uh yeah pretty impressive through legends anyways
Engin Terzi: thank you thank you very much for being my guest and it was it was a pleasure especially messing with pia and hope that you guys will enjoy your trip and i wish you the best for the competition thank you thank you and get well soon yeah thank you take care bye bye guys yeah see you soon
