Unknown: Okay.
Engin Terzi: Can you speak louder? Yeah, yeah. I don't know. I don't know. I hardly hear you. Do you hear me? Also, Haji Murad is not here, but I hardly hear your voice. Yeah. Maybe I put this one.
Yanis: Because I hear you're quite good. I don't know. I could use some... Try now? That's better now? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I had to put this. Yeah, that's good. So, how have you been? Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. Did some fast workout and then some few things to do later today, but I will be fine for...
Engin Terzi: We can do some. How are you looking? Yeah, still fighting with COVID. When did it start? How many days? Probably about nine days or something. That's a long time. And temperature all the time? No, it was fine. I mean, at the beginning it was terrible. Then it became normal yesterday.
Engin Terzi: you know my my quarantine was only one week yeah and then quarantine finished and then i went to training i did some pull-ups came home and since yesterday i feel like you know i have heavy like flu you know i don't know why why hajumrat is not here
Yanis: because uh at first yeah normally like try to try to get general health back anyway it's impossible to get stronger if you are not healthy you know if your body your body is not working not working properly anyway yeah yeah yeah yeah i think i need to you know start uh yeah we are we are not live yet or we are
Yanis: I think we are live. Yeah, I think, yeah. Yeah. So it's English and Russian language, yeah. Okay, bilingual, bilingual. Right into...
Engin Terzi: writing to arsene about um how she's not here yet he came i approved but he's gone now i don't know why i approved but it it seemed like you know he was trying to enter yeah yeah
Yanis: And how are you? Are you motivated, training or not at all? I'm always training, but not always super specific. Like doing some cross country skiing, doing some beach tennis, inside beach tennis, going to gym, of course, doing some arm wrestling, but doing a lot of other stuff as well. So not only arm wrestling, but yeah, we'll be ready when necessary.
Engin Terzi: i admit it but maybe his internet is um i think you need to turn your i don't know if he hears us but turn your microphone i cannot see him either
Engin Terzi: So, yeah, finally. Okay. Hello, Aljumrat. Hello, everyone. Hi, hi. So, you left the gym right after training, right? Yes, I didn't go anywhere.
Yanis: It looks like I have to speak both English and Russian. Like in school, right? Two languages. Yes, I understand English a little, but... You understand, yes. It's harder for you to answer or talk. You understand, you understand. Yes. How's your health? How's your health? How's your health? How's your health? How's your health? How's your health? How's your health? How's your health? How's your health? How's your health? How's your health? How's your health? How's your health? Everything is fine, thank God. Everything is fine, thank God.
Yanis: I will ask firstly about how is his health and how is his arms and general health. How do you feel after the World Championships? How much do you think he will recover? 100%? 80%? 90%?
Khadzimurat Zoloev: Well, let's put it this way, I haven't come to 100% for any championship yet, so that nothing hurts me. Something always hurts. And this is due to the fact that it accumulates. But I'm used to it, I already know what to do. I actually got injured at the World Championship, I already knew what to do. And rehabilitation is going well, up to the point that I'm fully trained, everything is fine.
Yanis: Haji Murad is saying that for the last many years in the Norway Championship he has been 100% healthy and as you know we are not getting younger and we have to live together with injuries. But he knows what to do and rehabilitation is going well and he feels more or less okay.
Khadzimurat Zoloev: And what do you think, do you need to think more about rehabilitation now than about preparation for the fight against Brzenk, against John? How does it affect? Of course, it affects a lot, because when I went to the World Championship, I mostly went to make sure that everything went without injuries and to prepare very seriously for this meeting with John.
Khadzimurat Zoloev: Last time I lost to him and I wanted to be 100% ready for this fight. Now I can't say that, but I'm sure that John will not be 100% ready either. I have some kind of inner self-esteem. And I think we will be about the same. I don't know. This is not the first time I'm struggling with such difficulties.
Khadzimurat Zoloev: I will try. I will try.
Yanis: First of all, Hadji is saying that he feels optimistic about the fight with John and his inside belief is that everything will be fine. Of course, rehabilitation is giving some problem and he doesn't know how well he will prepare, but also he believes that John is not having everything 100% and we all don't have it. So also he is having different problems to prepare for this match.
Engin Terzi: so he generally he's optimistic and he believes in himself yeah um last time they pulled it was the i think a1 event in russia and in that a1 you know haji murad's inside and outside attempts didn't work well but still his inside move seemed to be more effective than his outside move
Engin Terzi: and lately we see haji uh pulling versus hutchings you know with an outside uh skill you know with an outside skill and and but whenever of course i don't want us to tell him you know what he's planning to do but still um like it didn't seem
Engin Terzi: so effective his outside move versus john you know and for the inside move you know as we know that this this area is very important for the when whenever you want to go to yeah hook you know so can he tell us anything about it or he just saves everything for the you know as a surprise for the table you know okay
Khadzimurat Zoloev: I can say it right away, so that you don't suffer a little too. Look, yes, well, now I have increased the top, and before that, that is, I showed the level of my top, this is already with Todd Hutchings, I did not climb into the hook. And our last fight with John also did not work out, I tried to go into the hook first, it did not work out, and my top was not the same as it is now. And John
Khadzimurat Zoloev: What am I going to do with John? I've been seeing his mistakes lately in the last video. And I understand what needs to be done. Of course, you need to take the fight to the top, because his wrist is now breaking very hard. But those athletes who fought with him, they didn't have enough side pressure. That is, they could just pass the wrist and that's it, they couldn't give anything to John.
Khadzimurat Zoloev: In my case, I'm a different athlete. I'm a hooker with a very good side, where you can work with the top on the finish line. At first, with Hutchings, I also thought to try to start with the hook. I was preparing to fight with the hook.
Khadzimurat Zoloev: And Hutchings put himself out in such a way that I understood that I needed to fight with the top. I immediately understood this. And when I took it and won very easily, I began to think, why not get into the hook, if here and now I feel confident. Therefore, well, it turned out that, yes, I fought quite easily. Try at least to transfer something from this, right? Yes.
Yanis: Haji very well remembers his previous fight with John in A1 and he says right now he also sees that John have weak spots and he said about wrist and hand control and of course
Yanis: He believes he's much better right now with top roll, with outsides, than he was before. And his plan is to work on John's wrist and attack top roll, similarly like he did against Hutchings.
Yanis: And with Hutchings, he was thinking about going inside from the very beginning, but Hutchings's setup was so good for him to go top roll and he felt that inside is not necessary to go and outside game is working for him and he was pulling outside. So he sees that John's wrist is
Yanis: vulnerable and he can take that wrist and some others are done that but he said others were able to take that wrist but not able to push to side and because of hajimura's uh fundament in arm wrestling he's uh he's generally side pressure hook arm wrestler he believes he takes that wrist he will be strong enough to finish that fight and his arm strength will be strong enough to go to side as well
Engin Terzi: The only thing is that him to take in the wrist, but at the same time, he should also control the pronator of John, you know. If he goes this way and John goes that way, then it is the hard part. So he needs to do full wrist curl top roll, you know, because John loses the wrist, but he still remains his pronator to this way, you know. So, yeah, he needs like a full control of the wrist. This is my opinion. Yeah. Yeah.
Khadzimurat Zoloev: I understand, he even gesticulated. I know this technique, I understand it. How much will it be enough for one fight with a serious opponent? I don't even know how to say. I will do my best and show myself, I hope, on the better side.
Khadzimurat Zoloev: Well, I say, I have an inner feeling that it will work out. Now to guess and say that it makes no sense to reveal all the cards, I think. Of course. You have to try to feel it. I know John Rook, it's not the first time I've stood with him. His fingers are like an octopus, they suck in. And you have to feel yourself there too, feel this moment, where to work.
Khadzimurat Zoloev: That Haji Murad in 2015, it was Haji Murad 7 years ago. And also John, it was another John too. Yes, and then I also weighed 80 kilograms, and then less than 80, I fought 80 kilograms. Now I weigh over 90 and give my weight, and my hands already work differently. From that moment, then I was also not weak, but now I'm not particularly weak.
Yanis: he knows that style of john and he has uh he has watched it and he understands it and uh of course it's it's always a question can keep what he can do against that but uh he believes he will find a way and and of course uh
Yanis: If we compare with some previous fights, he said he's like 10 kilos heavier right now than in the last time when they met. And it's seven years later, many things have changed. So he said he feels good and confident about himself. What's his weight right now? He said over 90, but how old are you?
Engin Terzi: 93, yes. John was 115 kg in Dubai, now here he will be 102 kg. The maximum he said he can lose weight down. Haji said he doubts about the weight and he thinks he will not cut the weight to 102 kg.
Engin Terzi: No, no, he will be. He's already there. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. He's right now, he's about 104 or something right now. Okay. Yeah, yeah. He said that he's, that is what he will keep his word, you know. John is, yeah. So he says that, you know, he is healthier than that time. And he's gonna go outside. He's 93 kilo, good shape. And a lot of things changed since last time. It's good. It's good to hear, you know.
Yanis: Yeah. And what do you think about John? He will also attack outside? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Outside was outside. Yeah. Yeah. We're talking about how John will fight in the first fight. With the top or inside? I think he will fight with the top first. I think he will fight with the top first.
Khadzimurat Zoloev: You can fight more sensitively on ties, what to him, what to me. But now I'm not the opponent of ties, I love ties and so on. But why go on a tie if you can win without a tie? I have such a psychology. Evgeny when we fought with Hutchings, he himself asked me, maybe we'll tie up. I think, why not tie up if I need to win?
Khadzimurat Zoloev: I think I'll win three times at first, and then we'll fight on the ligament. Why didn't we fight him in the hook? Because he put himself in the top. He pulled so hard that I understood the point of me climbing and then trying to break through his side. It's better for me to fight in the top. He put himself in the top too, and that's why I overplayed this situation too. Usually, Americans don't agree with each other right away.
Khadzimurat Zoloev: Let's be honest, I'm not against it, let's fight.
Yanis: Yeah, Haji said that he thinks John at first will go for strap and only then will be some. But first of all, usually he thinks this will be a strap fight. And also he continued about the previous fight with Hutchings, that Hutchings was trying to get the strap. And Haji said, why do let someone in strap at first? At first, like he had to get the straps.
Yanis: So he's not like, if John will ask, for example, if you want to go to Strap, he will say, no, I want to.
Engin Terzi: I think that John's ability to go to strap is better than Hutchings. John managed to go to strap with so many guys, including Alexey Voivoda and Mene. Of course, it's not the same John, but he's much more experienced and his pronator is much stronger to turn around and sleep, but we will see.
Engin Terzi: We will see. Haji is also very good about not letting people to go to strap. You know, he's also very good. He can catch the fingers and beat the guys. Yeah, that is that is, you know, I'm Haji should be thankful to me that, you know, I am making his way to take his revenge from those guys, you know, first Hutchings and now John, of course, of course, if he's good enough, you know, and we will see, you know. Yeah.
Yanis: Yeah, Engin said it, Serge. Engin said it was your chance to take a rematch. First, you took a rematch against Hutchings. Now it's your chance to take a rematch against John. How many times have you fought against John? Only once on A1? Officially, only once. The only time. Yes, and the fact that we fought behind the scenes is not serious.
Yanis: I don't consider it a fight. Can I say something, Yanis? John was a fan of mine when I was a kid.
Khadzimurat Zoloev: When I saw him for the first time, I was just delighted to take a picture with him and so on. And now I don't look at him as my potential or angry opponent, I need to win him or something. I look at him in any case, my look at him as a legend with respect and no more. I have no task to win, to tear. I don't have such sports anger on him as it should be at world-class competitions.
Khadzimurat Zoloev: I have a solid relationship with him. I want to fight with him. It's a pity that I'm not in the best shape I can be because of the injury. But John is a great man for me. If I win, I'll take him down. I'll never let that happen.
Yanis: Haji said that when he started armwrestling, John was already a big name and he always had a huge respect for him as an athlete. He's one of his favourite armwrestlers and he still has that
Yanis: big respect for John and he will not say that I will tear him, I will break him, I will... No, no, no, no, no. He said it's more like a sportsmanship and... Battle of two legends. He won this battle but still big respect for what he has done and he's a huge legend in our sport and we all understand that. Yes, yes, yes, yes.
Yanis: it's just a battle of two legends two of the all-time best in the history this is this is yeah yeah yeah this is how i see the case but and one more thing he says that he's a little bit sad about that uh he he was not or he will not be able to prepare maybe with 100 because of all uh what happened before with injury but uh but anyway he will fight and we'll try to show his best
Engin Terzi: haji yeah he said that yeah but also say that john is also 57 years old he has many injuries he's limited as well so it is i think fair enough you know fair enough john is older and he's heavier so but you know john has been known as someone that you know who has been good enough to be uh best in unlimited weight class in the past in his prime so
Engin Terzi: right now at this age beating john when he is when you are much heavier than him to me means almost zero you know nothing but whenever someone like haji 10 kilo lighter and if he beats john
Engin Terzi: then it means something this is like it still means something to beat john at his weight or especially if he the guy is even lighter than him it still means something but just imagine that you know a heavyweight guy comes and beat jones now
Yanis: i mean to me it for me it means almost like zero you know nothing you know yeah yeah yeah before and even now uh we don't see that uh uh lighter or same weight arm wrestlers are able to be john that's that's true yeah that's true yeah especially before of course yeah yeah yeah uh
Yanis: I understood something. No, to be honest, nothing. For example, now, if someone from the super heavyweights would have beaten John, of course, it would still be good, but it wouldn't be a miracle. But if someone is heavier or lighter,
Khadzimurat Zoloev: For example, if you beat John, it's still very difficult. And before that, there wasn't even such a thing that John would lose to someone who was easier than him, right? That Hutchings beat him in his time. But I'll put it this way. It seems to me, I myself would be interested to fight him officially for the rest of my life and check, for example, what I am now.
Khadzimurat Zoloev: I'm already an adult athlete, I want to be at the same level as John is now. I just don't understand how the Americans do it. I don't understand either. At what age can they let young people smoke?
Khadzimurat Zoloev: damn, I don't know, at the level of Devon Larratt or so on, who weigh even more, stronger. But still, if John lost, he still deservedly lost. No one thinks he lost. He's good, he fought. I don't write him off as a pensioner. I just strive for the fact that all the time I'm asked this stupid question all the time. How do you look at John?
Khadzimurat Zoloev: Isn't it time for him? I say, let him fight, he's handsome, he's good. I myself, damn it, I would like God to give me so much strength and opportunities so that I can fight. So that after 20 years they can fight like that. Well, yes, I just don't understand what he's made of. He doesn't have injuries or anything. He's already slowly, even recently, also broke. This is the first time I've had something like this at the World Championship.
Khadzimurat Zoloev: There was some kind of muscle outburst. It has never happened before. And you think, you think, I'm getting old, I have motivation in my head, I have hunger, I still have to fight. I don't know, I've given it all my life, and that's why I don't want to just take it and leave it.
Yanis: yeah so generally we talked about that it's it's uh so crazy and so in in like from one side even impossible that uh john at his age is still so good and then we are watching all those americans and uh they are still so strong and
Yanis: as you said he's feeling like uh not like old athlete but anyway like who's already in sport for long and injuries and everything and john with big respect and uh he's not like saying you need to go to retirement or something because he's still looking good on table strong on table and we can watch and enjoy what he's doing and incredible and and we can just uh we can just uh
Engin Terzi: uh like uh hope that when we will be in the same age we will still be same strong and same active and still still pull on on a competition in same level yeah yeah um does haji have some info about the other matches and his predictions if we can ask him what is the like the match that you know he is like most interested other than his his match
Yanis: Do I need to translate it? I understand something, but I'm afraid I didn't understand it correctly. As I understand it, he's asking who would be interesting for me to fight in the next match. From the other fights that will be in Turkey, who do you think is the most interesting? Who would you like to see?
Khadzimurat Zoloev: You know, I think they are the best pairs that could have been put together. If it hadn't been for these unification of the federation with PAL and WAF, if Engin's hands were even more free to add more pairs. Now people write to me and ask where, when,
Khadzimurat Zoloev: where to go. I would go myself, even if I didn't fight myself, to see it live. It's really a very interesting armfight. I will not highlight someone, because it will be disrespectful to others, because that's where people go to fight each other, and you can't hurt someone now, like, this one is interesting, the other one is not. It's a very interesting competition, and
Khadzimurat Zoloev: I don't know, I just look at it myself, and the names are constantly being updated, updated, and I think, when will it end, how long can it be? No, everything is cool, I will not highlight anyone now, but all the matches will be very interesting, it seems to me. They are in their own way peculiar, both in terms of technique, and in terms of the level of the athletes. There are such athletes who are generally opposite to each other, that you don't know what to say, what will happen. And that's why it's interesting to watch.
Yanis: Hedji didn't take one specific match as his favorite. He said there are so many great fights and he's really interested about results. If he wouldn't go as an athlete, he definitely would follow this as an armwrestling fan.
Yanis: And for respect to athletes, he will not say that one fight is better than another fight because all are really interesting and most of them really even fights. And impossible to predict some winner. Can he tell us his predictions? Like, for example, Genadi versus Michael Todd? How do you think Genadi versus Michael Todd?
Khadzimurat Zoloev: I don't know, Genadi himself wanted to fight Michael Todd, and he has to get to the level to show himself. Last time he didn't fight for a long time, and the last time he fought, I didn't even understand what he did. Yes, he himself didn't understand what to do. I know Genadi as a professional in many techniques, he knows how to fight. And now what he did, he wasn't his own, I don't know. Of course, I will root for Genadi, because I am very good friends with him.
Khadzimurat Zoloev: But Michael is also not a weak guy. Especially if you need a super match. As I said at the World Championship, not the boy from yesterday, who, you know, fought somewhere, not a professional. Well, yes, Michael is also unique in his technique, but he can deliver a surprise and fight in the hook, as I watched. Well, I don't know, we'll see. I'm just saying, everything is in order, how they are there behind the table,
Yanis: Haji knows Genadi very well and he said Genadi was after a long break back in competitions in previous fight and didn't look so good. He knows Genadi as an armistice who can fight in every position and he's technically good and always fighting till end but the Genadi he saw in a previous fight was not as he used to but if he wants and Genadi always wanted himself to
Yanis: fight against Michael Todd and if he if he wants to fight with him he need to reach that uh level of strength and confidence and he will support Genadi because he knows him very well for a long but uh it's it's uh he said many factors can impact and it's hard to predict who will win I understand yeah and and if he goes Arif Ertem versus Gasparini
Khadzimurat Zoloev: Arif versus Gasparini, what do you think? I don't know, I just don't know Arif. I saw him fighting in his own place at the championships, and I didn't see him anywhere. Well, he's the last one in the world championship, he won weightlifting in the 110 plus championship with his right hand. I confused him with another athlete. But he's a young athlete.
Khadzimurat Zoloev: I don't know, honestly. Well, I say that every pair is mysterious. Now they say who will win and who will not. Yes, of course, the favorite now is Gasparini. But he is also not without mistakes. He wins and loses. Yes, yes, yes. That's why they put him in such pairs, so that it would be interesting. I want to just... Well, in fact, I advise all fans not to...
Khadzimurat Zoloev: Enjoy the fight. Of course, everyone can make their own bets, but I'm no longer a gambler in this regard, so I don't want to bet on anyone. I want everything to go smoothly, beautifully and without injuries, that's the most important thing. So that the injuries do not prevent anyone from showing themselves at the table.
Yanis: Hedji was very diplomatic about that fight. He said Gasparini is good and probably his favorite, but he also had some mistakes on his fight, from time to time. Most importantly, he said he wants everyone, fans and athletes, to enjoy the show and to watch.
Yanis: and uh and he he he said the best if uh athletes are able to prove prove what they have uh trained and then prove their best show their best performance and uh most important to not have any injuries and uh to enjoy enjoy the fight and and haji uh bet keely versus rock
Yanis: What? Onyane Bekele against Oleg Zhokh. Do you think Bekele has a chance to get into the hook? It's a 90kg limit. Yes, he won't be able to fight in the 90kg category. I know that Onyane has already gained 90kg, but Zhokh is actually
Khadzimurat Zoloev: Of course, I progress with each year, but it's not the same as before, I think. His level was very high then. Now, after such rehabilitation and so on, he's doing well, he's recovering. And now it will be unfair to discuss how they fought. I know that they are in good shape, because here, when Vadim Akperov also held a tournament,
Khadzimurat Zoloev: I didn't offer myself with any 100-kilo athlete. I said, I'm ready. You said you were ready to fight, right? Yes, with my left hand. He offered himself. He said, I'll come, make me a fight. And so now it will be dishonest to both athletes to say something like that.
Khadzimurat Zoloev: Yeah, Haji said
Yanis: thing he knows is that the onion is in very well good shape and uh when when aquaro did the tournament in russia oniani oniani says that he is ready to fight with anyone under 100 kilo of his left arm that give him a fight he's in good shape and he wants to pull so he's very sure about uh himself but uh again about any predictions
Yanis: It's impossible and one more thing he said that probably Oleg is not still in the same shape as he was before after his accident and he's getting better, he's getting stronger but it's not yet that Oleg we saw before but hopefully he will be and we will see best Oleg as well on the table.
Khadzimurat Zoloev: And Zurab Tavberidze vs. Rambet. Let's continue. I talked to Zurab the day before yesterday. He said he was in the best shape in his entire history. He now weighs 99-100 kg. I asked him, how do you feel? You've gained weight, you've never been in this category. He said, it's great, I'm ready, I'm waiting.
Yanis: In English? I was like...
Yanis: okay it's a hadji yesterday talked with zurab and uh and and zurab he said he's stronger than ever he's 9900 kilos and he said his his shape is amazing what he believes and uh haji thinks if if zurab will get inside uh that he should win that uh zurab's inside state should be enough to beat but uh
Engin Terzi: Again, it's always predictions. But Zurab said himself that he has never been stronger. Yeah, I understand. Is Igor Farniev from Ossetia? Igor Farniev? Yeah. Is he from Ossetia or not? Yes.
Khadzimurat Zoloev: And how is he compared to Cherkasov? Can he in the trainings, can he do anything? Can he do something against Cherkasov in the trainings when he fights? It's a difficult question because Igor is in another gym and we are neighbors, but we have 10 sports schools here in armwrestling. 10? Yes, and Farnieff works in a military structure.
Khadzimurat Zoloev: And it's hard for him to train now. To get into good shape, he doesn't have enough time for training at the moment. I think so. Because he didn't like the last World Championship in his shape. He lost with both hands, although we thought he would win. He was supposed to win, actually. But he wasn't his own. And I don't know.
Khadzimurat Zoloev: Oleg is a miracle for me, a guy who comes out of such losing situations, where I, for example, would no longer fight. In fact, he pulls him out of there. So, to predict this fight somehow, it will be wrong. It is better to do a marfight, and then we will see who will be the strongest. I think it will sound better that way.
Yanis: He said that, yes, he's from Ossetia, but they are not training in the same gym. They have 10 different sports schools for armwrestling in Ossetia, and he's in another gym. So you don't know about his shape right now. But in previous competition, they were told that he will do really good and that he could even win. But it didn't happen. And they don't know why, because
Yanis: his shape was theoretically very good but uh okay so oleg beat him easy or hard
Yanis: Yeah, they didn't match, they didn't fight, just not with each other. He said, make an arm fight and we will see.
Engin Terzi: No, I just asked, just trying to compare Yusuf with Cherkasov, you know, because Yusuf and Farnia was the finalists at the WAF. In the last two WAFs, they were the finalists. And now Yusuf is going to pull Oleg Cherkasov. So that's the reason that I asked.
Yanis: And Engin just wants to know, because Yusuf fought with him at the World Championships in the final, and he wants to somehow compare Yusuf against Cherkasov and think, how is it possible, or what are the chances for Yusuf against Cherkasov, to understand. That's exactly what no one can talk about now. Evgeny at the World Championships, we were together with Cherkasov, we lived in the same room.
Khadzimurat Zoloev: I ask him how he feels, if he will pass today. Because I already knew that I would win. I already knew that I would win. Oleg has a rival, but he is always respectful to everyone. In terms of upbringing and orderliness, he is such a person that you can't say anything bad.
Khadzimurat Zoloev: And he's always respectful to everyone. He doesn't have anger for someone, I'll tear him apart now. It happens to me that I get so angry that I have to do everything, tear him apart, what should he do to me, for example. Oleg doesn't have that. He has a cold attitude, he comes up with a cold head, psychologically, to this question. And I don't know what to say. We all see that Oleg is unpredictable. Today he can be a little
Khadzimurat Zoloev: And then pull him out of there, you know? I don't know. He can pull him out from under the pillow. And at the World Championship he slept with a broken hand, how much he fought. Well, this is the power of will of a person. And now to say that this one will win him or not, it seems to me to be stupid.
Yanis: We talked about Oleg and he said Oleg is a phenomenal athlete and always understandable that he's able to fight in any position and always in all losing positions when it seems that the fight is done he's still in fight and fighting till very end.
Yanis: And Oleg is always very respectful against all opponents and he never goes and says that he will win and beat someone. He's always taking seriously all opponents, all his fights and his fighting spirit is incredible. Last two questions. One is his brother. Alan. Is he going to stay at 75 or will go up to 80?
Khadzimurat Zoloev: Will he stay at 75 or will he go to 80? No, he'll be 75 for now. But he doesn't feel like he's 80 yet. I was talking to him about Russia. We're going to have the Russian Championship in March. I said, what do you think? He said, I don't feel like I'm 80 yet. Morally, that's why there's no point. I was like that myself. I started at 65 kilos. And little by little, little by little, I could compete in the same weight class for five years in a row.
Khadzimurat Zoloev: Alain always weighs under 80 kg, of course, but he still has to perform at 83-84 kg maximum to be ready, worked out, and so on. Well, I don't know, if he's now... We've felt 75 kg so far, we'll see later. It's all so gradually, you have to get to it, and not so with a broken head, I'll take 80 kg, 90 kg, but...
Yanis: Yeah, the plan is still to pull in 75 and
Yanis: He doesn't feel yet ready for 80 kilos and his weight is still under 80, so he's still pulling 75 kilo class and it's slowly and systematically like same as Hajumrat did when he was pulling in one category for many years and then slowly climbing up. He's a little bit taller than his brother, huh? Is he not?
Yanis: Who is taller, you or your brother? Well, he's already like me, that's for sure. But he's taller, maybe my hair has become smaller.
Yanis: Practically the same height. No big difference. And the last question. Is top five in the world in open, unlimited weight class?
Yanis: Top five in the world. Who do you think is in the top five in the world of armwrestling? Who is it now? Without the general category, open or heavyweight, but still, yes. Who is number one, number two? The whole story or at the moment? At the moment. At the moment, the first place is, of course, Levan. Levan first place, yeah.
Khadzimurat Zoloev: Yes, Levan is in the first place, because there were Cyplenkov, Pushkar, Supertizhi, who were in the first place. Now Levan has become one of them. So, what can I say? Top 5 for now. Damn, it's hard for me to answer, honestly. Well, that's what you think.
Khadzimurat Zoloev: Larratt is in the top 5, but I don't know where to put him now. He's not in the second place for sure. I haven't seen him in serious fights with our normal European top fighters recently. Evgeny with that category in the office.
Khadzimurat Zoloev: I don't see any chance for him at all. I don't see any chance. I don't know, maybe he'll surprise us, of course.
Yanis: Sometimes I'm really surprised by the athletes I don't have a chance against. I'll say it in English. Hadji said Levan is in first place for sure. Deon Larratt is somewhere in the top five, but he doesn't see him as a second place. And I asked him about...
Yanis: And I asked him about Devon and Lewon, that fight, about chance for Devon. And Haji said he didn't see any chances for Devon. Of course, he said always some surprise, possibly, but he didn't see any chance. And what do you think, Vitaly? No, now it's very difficult to do some of these, to set the top five, because they all spread out in different organizations.
Khadzimurat Zoloev: They don't fight now, and it's interesting to see what would happen if we all fought together again. And then it's easier to think and say who can do what and what they are capable of. Now everyone throws off the gym, he lifted 200 kg on his chest or did a pull-up, so to compare and say that he is top 5, I can't right now, because they haven't shown themselves in recent times. The only thing is who, Levan, is still fighting or doing something.
Khadzimurat Zoloev: And Devon Larratt. I mean big names like that. I'm also in Afi right now. Many people look at it as a result. Many people don't look at it as a result. It's still a weak category. I agree. For example, when I switched to 90 kg, I didn't go there because it was a weak category. At that moment, I was struggling.
Khadzimurat Zoloev: Sashu Andreev was fighting there, and then I came to the World Championship, Kachak lost 100 kg, Sashu remained, and we got two favorites. This year, too, Dimitrov's flame added to us. And Sashu, I was preparing for Sashu, and Sashu, on the contrary, took off, he had a chest injury, he was torn, he didn't perform.
Khadzimurat Zoloev: And many other fans say, why is he fighting there? But it's not my fault, I don't choose my opponent. If we all fought as it is now, we would have a lot of athletes in Russia. Saltykhanov joined in 1990, Lenin Vadim joined. Petrenko from Ukraine is also not bad. David, I forgot his last name, is also in Russia now.
Khadzimurat Zoloev: the main good tops, then imagine how interesting it would be to look at it. And now some are there, others are here, and it's not clear whether to make a top now. I don't see any sense at all. They consider themselves tops there.
Yanis: We're talking about all those top five and then we went to that there are so many organizations right now with WAF, with PAL, with WAL, with everything and it's impossible to say some
Yanis: top eight it's it's predictions but it's uh unclear right now because no one of them can go forward together and then then we went to uh same with 90 kilo class that many say that uh in waff 90 kilo was not maybe all all best names but he said
Yanis: Yeah, but he said you all have a chance to go and pool and then of course it would be much funnier or much more interesting if all possible names would be in the same organization. Yes, but just think about it. Who is outside of the WAF that has beaten Sasho and Hajimura?
Yanis: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, they all lost here, and then they went away, you know. That's what it is. Agin said, yes. Who of them, who, for example, is not fighting on Wafaa, beat you and Sasha? Nobody. In principle, not so much, because there was a lot, there was not even such a thing. Well, look, for example, there were guys with whom I did not fight at all.
Khadzimurat Zoloev: There are guys that I lost to. No, first I won, then I lost, then again. So I say that if we all fought for competition in the lab. We fought, I remember, for such a big competition in Bulgaria at the World Championship, when Vesey was... Prudnik was in Vesey. I think I was 80-90. I don't remember what it was.
Khadzimurat Zoloev: Well, in the 90s, I fought. I decided to fight in the 90s. And then there was Prudnik. Some connection. Some connection problem. No, I'm just saying that. From Kazakhstan. Please remind me. Angarbaev. Angarbaev. Angarbaev. And so on. I came sick.
Khadzimurat Zoloev: I thought I wouldn't fight. The coach asked me to come and report on the documents, because if you don't come, then something will happen. And then I just came out and said, let me try. I won, in principle, everything went well, with such a good roster. It can always be interesting, and then there is good motivation.
Khadzimurat Zoloev: And when you go out and see that the athlete is at a semi-annual level in the gym, he decided to check himself out and came out to fight with you, you are careful, you are already trying to win him gently. And when you have a serious opponent, you are already in the mood to fight. That's why I started at the World Championship, because I couldn't find the motivation. I started at such a level that I behaved very ugly at the table in relation to the judge. I never behaved like that.
Khadzimurat Zoloev: I didn't know how to get in the mood. The athlete seems to be serious, but I can't get in the mood for him, because he is my friend behind the scenes. And then, when we are still standing, and some of these tricks begin, I was even more excited. I didn't say anything bad to anyone, of course. I said everything by the book.
Yanis: maybe we're talking a lot but uh one more thing we talked about uh last fight with uh plumbing dimitrov and he said about this emotional uh situation when he get a little bit upset and angry and he said there was nothing personal and uh and it's very hard for him to find motivation especially because uh
Yanis: When he fights against Plamen Dimitrov, Plamen is his friend and it makes it even harder to fight and in some moments he needed that extra emotions and he wanted to somehow to maybe find a reason to get a little bit of this aggressivity or some aggression to do this. But he said it's nothing personal, not against referees, not against Plamen or someone else.
Engin Terzi: it happens usually you know normally 90 99 percent of times zolo has been a peaceful
Yanis: competitor, you know, it can happen, you know, once every 20 years, it can happen so that nobody can generalize such thing, you know. Haji, how do you think, or not how do you think, but how do you think, can you say, for example, when was your best form or, for example, I don't know, two or one moment when you think you were the strongest? I don't know how to answer this question. You know how, Yanis,
Khadzimurat Zoloev: Look at the moment. It happens that you have a good year in the championships, everything goes well, you win everything, but it happens that you are in the same shape, everything is good and it doesn't work out. And to say that this year I was in the best shape, it seems to me, well, everyone says that 2012 was the best year for me. When I became Khadzimurat Zoloev, when they started watching me.
Khadzimurat Zoloev: And then I went all the way up the stairs, rolled up. I, in principle, did this before, but I just didn't show myself there in absolutes and so on, I showed myself only in categories. Although I showed myself in the same form that I usually do. But I showed myself there by trying to perform there, and I did everything successfully. And they paid attention to me.
Yanis: I ask about is it possible to say that or name some years or competitions when he thinks he has been in his best shape or best shape ever and he said it's tough question but maybe 2012
Yanis: just just because that was a time when he started to fight against the best heavyweights and uh slowly prove him as a one not only of best in his weight class but also based in unlimited weight class and in overall weight classes um i i said last two questions but the the sergey bogoslov he looks in incredible shape after haji saw that how sona beat him
Engin Terzi: uh does he give any chance at all to sone versus tatashins or not at all yeah
Yanis: Sergey Bogosloev, you probably saw how Tsonev won against Bogosloev. And after that fight, do you think Tsonev has a chance against Hutchings in the ring? Yes, I even made a bet when I fought Tsonev with Bogosloev and won that bet.
Khadzimurat Zoloev: I knew that Tsonev would win. Everyone preferred Bogoslov. To be honest, looking at him visually, he was like a huge cyborg. No one should interfere with him. After the first fight, I want to say that if I fought him, I would also understand what to do with him.
Khadzimurat Zoloev: in the same technique, in the triceps, that Tsonev overcame it correctly and twisted it in his direction. Of course, the game went back and forth, but Tsonev is good that he overcame it and won. And now I see that he is patient, and you need to be patient with Hutchings, because I will not say that Hutchings is very strong in this direction, he just has
Khadzimurat Zoloev: so to speak, well, my idea, my vision is that Hutchings has a dead spot in the hook, where he is, if he doesn't go there and doesn't do anything, I think he will lose. Hutchings will lose, I think. I don't know, with all my respect to Toto, but
Khadzimurat Zoloev: At the moment, I'm telling you, he seems to be winning everything, but Sonny doesn't have anyone special. Now, if he wins, for example, Toto Hutchings, it seems to me that everyone will look at him and say, well, what is Sonny here? And the Americans will also start looking at him. He is a very serious athlete that you can't say that he will pass as an easy walk for Hutchings. No, I will say that. I think, on the contrary, that I put, for example, well, he has already started putting everything.
Khadzimurat Zoloev: I've been rooting for Sonny for a long time, because he's young and promising, and he shows himself very well as an athlete and as a person in competitions.
Yanis: We talked a lot about the fight with Tsonev and Bogusloev and also a potential fight. Generally, first of all, with all his respect to Todd Hutchings, he believes Tsonev could win this fight.
Yanis: wow with all respect and uh wow about when bogusloyo fought against sonia uh his uh his uh prediction was that sonia will win and that also happened and sonia proved himself as very and durable athlete who can who can fight smart and in good positions and he believes he has a good chance against uh hutchings
Yanis: He said, Hutchings has one very, very good position, but if he, if Sonia will be smart enough and not let Hutchings in that position, that he thinks Sonia has a good chance and good potential for winning this fight. Wow, that's very surprising. And I promise the last question, Alain Zoloev, will he be able to compete professional events at all or just because he's in army university, he will never get permission?
Yanis: I invited him, you know. We talked about the potential fight for Alan in Turkey, even in the previous year. The same question we asked you at the World Championship. Will Alan be able to fight professionals at all? Or is it going to be the same that he is not allowed anywhere? What is the situation?
Khadzimurat Zoloev: In our country, in Russia, there are those countries where it is forbidden to go out. To the army, to the soldiers, to the police, and so on. And that's why you can't go to these countries. With Turkey, the situation is completely different. There you need to write, first of all, an invitation, you need to show it. Well, you know, through higher authorities, that is, through the General Staff,
Khadzimurat Zoloev: and they have to approve his trip to the championship. Therefore, if you want to organize an Al-Anwar fight with someone, it is necessary, I think, in 3-4 months in advance or to warn in order to prepare everything documentarily, to give a report or what is written there by the higher authorities, so that they give an answer in advance, whether they let them go or not, so that the organizers are not let down either.
Khadzimurat Zoloev: Because if they do it on the spot, they won't let him out, and Arfite can go down, and a person can come from another country, and no Arfite will take place. So, in order not to let it happen, I know that Engin cast his eyes on Alan, and Alan himself is not against fighting, but I tell him, what are our chances that everything will work out there? He says, I need to write this there, there, there.
Khadzimurat Zoloev: And I need people there to help me with this. And we have to interest these people, first of all, so that they can help for Alan. If these documents get into the right hands, then it's up to the General whether he will let them in or not.
Yanis: okay generally it's not so easy but it is possible if it's like at least three four months before and if it's serious competition serious organization and we really know that some fight will happen
Yanis: it is possible but uh and uh with all paperwork it could be done but it's not 100 that it will be accepted by uh those uh uh institutions so it's uh yeah but uh does hajim rafting is versus west is serious enough uh it is serious enough but uh you need to you need to start to do this paperwork at least like four months before and and then you'll need to wait for uh accept answer
Engin Terzi: yeah but but you know when you set a match you know you need to announce it in in four months they will give the answer or yeah he he versus uh bojidar would be yeah that could be everything
Engin Terzi: long one huh long one exactly exactly i asked i also want to see arthur makarov and uh and uh i was almost setting almost setting but i asked arthur he said he's only like 70 75 no training okay and so i was like you know i mean if you're pulling bojidar because i know that bojidar has a super match in malta and he's in shape right now so i didn't want the best shape of bojidar versus
Engin Terzi: 85% Arthur, if I want them to pull, I want both them to be 95 minimum percent. Yeah, I understand. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: So we wanted to ask about in how long... Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like if I do one more time, like East versus West, of course, it is very hard to make lightweight East versus West because, I mean, most of the best, no disrespect to Western lightweights, but most of the best guys in lightweights are here in the East. So it can be East versus West in some, most likely 90 and above or maybe 85 and above.
Engin Terzi: But when we go down to 75-80 kilos, I think most likely it will be East vs East, you know. Unless someone steps up and says, hey, I'm ready, you know. And then, I mean, if it is... I just want to know, if he will do the next East vs West, or just like super matches? I have something in my throat, I can't cough.
Yanis: Yeah, yeah, yeah, no problem. No problem.
Yanis: Engin asks, if he's going to do the next East vs West or Supermatch, how much time does he need in advance? If he wants Alan, how much time does he need in advance to invite him? And, for example, in a month, in two months, will there be an answer? Or will it also be the last time, right after, when they, I don't know, before the tournament?
Khadzimurat Zoloev: You know, the army, they are the owners themselves. In that sense, they can send today, and the general can be on a business trip somewhere. It will be necessary to wait for the general to come, see and sign. I don't know how to say it. Now they even made a permission for the World Cup, officially, and so on, for a long time.
Khadzimurat Zoloev: Until the last moment, they even gave visas without permission, so that they would let them go, so that the visas would be ready. Because even for visas, then there wouldn't be enough time to open them. And at the last moment they were allowed, yes, and they even bought tickets in advance. I can't say anything. I'll talk to him, maybe he already knows this question.
Yanis: Now I can't answer for sure. It's all political situation in Russia right now. Sometimes it could be done in some months or something, but even till very last moment...
Engin Terzi: yeah you you can know even even before world championship uh with some uh documents and visas it was uh till very last moment they will they were waiting as a acceptor or not not actually okay okay yeah we will see we will see yeah i i thank you very much ajumrat and see you soon in istanbul and wish you the best
Yanis: Engin, where will we have the competition in the end? In Istanbul or in Yalova? My friends are coming with me, and I don't know. Istanbul. Istanbul. Istanbul, right? Mission will be in Istanbul, right? In Istanbul. Okay, that's good. Friends will come as well, together with, so they want to know. So, see you in Turkey, right? See you in Turkey. Be sure, be sure. Okay, so...
Yanis: thank you thank you for helping and you want you you want you want to be commentators together with uh
Engin Terzi: right in in istanbul for the live broadcasting yeah we could try yeah we could try this okay thank you very much my friends and see you very soon
Engin Terzi: yeah see you soon in istanbul and we will talk yeah bye yeah take care take care bye bye everyone
