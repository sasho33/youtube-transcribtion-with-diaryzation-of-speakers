SPEAKER_01: Good. How are you?
Sarah Backman: you look good just just just trained just trained yeah oh look at that wow nice arm before bigger than the upper arm love it yeah what a surprise for armrest huh and how is yours show me yours um yeah not bad yeah yeah yeah
Sarah Backman: So how have you been? Good, good. I took like four months off after the Jalova event in June. I was just physically and mentally tired after that and just life in general. But then we started again in October. So now October, November, December, almost four months training back to training and feeling really good. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: In yellow, you were in fantastic shape. You know, I thought that you would win with left, but right arm after that surgery, I didn't really think you could win. And that was the best shape of Irina Drieva. It was very, very surprising, but I saw your shape, not at the table performance, but other than table, you were in fantastic shape, you know. And soon, soon, when is exactly? March what? March 27th. Yeah, March 27th.
Sarah Backman: okay yeah wow nine more weeks or so nine more weeks here and where do you think you are right now um i think uh i mean like right where i need to be right now like my foundation is extremely good i would say um i'm just gonna peek
Engin Terzi: know work on perfecting my moves and yes as i can like are you about to same shape of yellow also i would like to apologize in yellow you know i i mean of course you guys were like hosted like superstars but still i could do
Engin Terzi: like more, but I had my own competition as well. So you know how I am, you know, it was very hard for me. But when you guys go to the seaside or something, you know, I couldn't really join a lot because it's not that easy to organize tournament and compete at the same time.
Sarah Backman: i don't know how you do it's like me and my husband talk about that a lot like we don't understand how you could do at such a high level competitor and then organize that type of events we only someone like you could pull that off someone who is crack here yeah yeah yeah even now i have i have even bigger card right now you know more more matches
Engin Terzi: And even now I'm like every day tempted, should I pull that guy? Should I pull? And I'm like, no, no, no, no, no. And then like everyone is reminding me, do you remember how you felt, how you regret last time? And you know, yeah. How do you feel now then to just take a step back and not compete? Like, are you like content? Are you happy to just sit back and organize or are you like itching to compete?
Engin Terzi: I'm getting crazy like I go I go bad i'm not you know I need to pull someone I need to pull someone in such a high level. And then the I can do, because I have big responsibility to do our missing community. You know, because we need to do everything so good for them so i'm just thinking that you know you should focus, you know I don't think that there is any like.
Engin Terzi: world level athletes in any other sport that is organizing like that level event and then competing at the same time can you imagine it's hard you know so better not do it it takes so much energy you know oh yeah definitely yeah so your level now is about the same as you yellow and then you are planning to put more on it yeah to be honest sorry is there any weight limit yes one one seven to six so 80 kilo the same same as yellow
Sarah Backman: yes and currently i am like what am i 77 78 kilo maybe um i like it like my my diet right now is is um it's like that like i fast like 24 hours a day and i have one big meal at night and it works really well like that with my work schedule
Sarah Backman: and so i'm not struggling at all like it's just how i live and i i feel really good i feel i feel strong and you know fit and i like to not have to cut weight for the tournament like for it for turkey yeah yeah i hate to travel and worry you could win a bodybuilding competition that day
Sarah Backman: You think? Yeah. Yeah. No, but I would say like, I would say, yeah, probably right there right now, or maybe slightly better. Like I feel, I mean, every time we talk, I feel like I say I'm stronger than ever, but I really think that I keep pushing all the time. So like, I feel, I feel, I feel strong. You know, I do. How do you gauge your strength? Like to compare, like you are now, I can say that,
Engin Terzi: minimum seven, eight kilos lighter than your preparation time, not the weigh-in time, but the preparation time of Yalova. And then it is like surprising to hear that you are seven, eight kilos lighter, but you are even stronger. So how do you gauge that? By the table performance or by the weights that you are lifting?
Sarah Backman: yeah both so i have my guys that i train with that i can always compare myself with and everybody you know can tell me and give me feedback but also the the weights that i lift you know the the pull-ups i do with the extra weight like i rope climbs with extra weight like the all the curls like i i measure it like that i lift weights heavier than i've ever done before so that's that's that's that's very good
Engin Terzi: I was expecting you to be now like around 85 kilo and now when you say like you are 77 kilo I was like surprised you know yeah yeah and then your time has come you versus Gabriela once again yeah there is nothing to take away from her victory last time
Engin Terzi: against you but still you were just coming back and i remember exactly because we are also friends you know that like mentally you were not ready you were just like pushing yourself to like be ready you know but it wasn't time you know but but now i see you more confident it doesn't mean that you know we will see who is stronger that day but i see you more like not doubting yourself yeah
Sarah Backman: Exactly, because now it's like, this is it. This is the match that I have been training for, thinking about every day for two and a half years. So I definitely feel like I did my homework this time.
Engin Terzi: uh i love coming in as the underdog too um like she's a phenomenal athlete like i have so much respect for her like she's a monster right both of you both of you both of you are like like great great great great athletes she just had more uh how to say like non-stop
Sarah Backman: career five six years of break or maybe more even yes exactly no she never stopped you know like he just keeps going year after year i don't understand like how she just keeps finding a question you planning to compete still love or you change your mind uh the plan was that um
Sarah Backman: But then life... It's in Antalya, you know, right? It's in Antalya. Oh, is it? It's in Turkey. Yeah. A year from now or when? What's that? When? End of October. End of October. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that's... Yeah. I mean, it's a possibility. Possible for sure. Yeah. I'm with the WAF Federation. So it's definitely possible. Yeah. So... Yeah. It will be very, very, very, very good. Bath of you.
Engin Terzi: Yeah. And I don't know, I don't think that she can, I think she can afford one loss, but I think you are in a point that they cannot afford another loss, two losses in a row against the same person, you know, it would be, yeah. So you need to really go there and then win.
Engin Terzi: This is why. Oh, my God. Yeah, no, I'm not going there with any doubts or like I'm telling you, this is it like this. Yeah, it's different. It's different. So if you ask my opinion, the Sarah, you know, really is incredibly strong. And I have utmost respect for her, like, like, yeah, she is a legend, you know. But
Sarah Backman: sarah i saw in yellow and then gabriella that i know if i would bet i would bet on sarah that i saw in uh yellow yeah this is this is yeah but let's see let's see where you will be let's see where you will be yeah i mean she's strong like look at her videos like she she just doesn't she's a machine like it's it's going to be very interesting and also like i just want to say this too like if she beats me at this point like
Sarah Backman: you know like good for you gabby you know like it's you know it's it's a lot of um respect no matter what but i'm just saying like i know i know where i'm at and yeah what i'm doing so i really hope that you are at where you are thinking
Sarah Backman: Me too, exactly. I don't know because I only train with guys. I don't really know how to measure, but my mind is different. And you are totally healed up, right? 100%. I am stronger now than I was before too. That is probably right now the most important female match in the world. That is, yeah.
Engin Terzi: And it's always good to watch a match that has a history, you know? Right, it's fun. Yeah, but I see that it's great that there is nothing, there is no ill feeling between you two. You both respect each other a lot and it's great. Yeah, she's a great person, yes. There is a, what's it, pop novel? Thank you for super chat.
Engin Terzi: Does Sara realize she is the most famous art master based on her social media views and huge numbers of followers? I think she does. I mean, I know about my followers. Two and a half million on Facebook? Yeah, two and a half million on Facebook. And Instagram? I think we're at
Engin Terzi: 200 or 185 or 184 something like that almost 200. and there is another one on was the honest critic sarah can you beat ryan bowen these people loves to tease ryan bowen you know yeah
Sarah Backman: ryan is a good friend of mine um i i really like him um i don't know about his current shape he looks very strong like he's he's you know i think he's on the same card as me too and who do you think is gonna win that match ryan has surprised us before i'm gonna go with ryan
Engin Terzi: He came to Florida and he was completely like, everybody talks shit and he beat Chance, which is our heavyweight champion in Florida. So he would beat Rob Visions? I think so. I think so. And Engin Terzi is asking a question. Engin Terzi, Enigma of age. How strong is Gabi or Sara in comparison to Tatiana
Engin Terzi: Kalyug. I hadn't seen Kalyug before WAF, but she seemed to dominate 90 kg very easily. Did you follow her? Yeah, yeah, I've seen her before.
Sarah Backman: And I mean, any, any girl in the, in those classes are scary, you know, they're just bigger and bigger arm and stuff. It's, it's hard to say. I really think though, that, um, based on Gabby's track record, I think that Gabby is the overall best female arm wrestler right now. Um, I think she would beat the heavier girls champions in the heavier class. You're saying that Gabby would beat Tatiana?
Engin Terzi: I think so. Yeah. And then you're going to be Gabby. So it automatically means. Hopefully, yes. Yeah. Yeah. The very good part about you, Sarah, you know, we are friends for like about 15 years.
Engin Terzi: Yeah. And no matter if you have 20 million followers or this or that, your your personality never change. You know, it's very, you know, we're all we're all the same. Yeah, we are all friends, you know, just like from that time, when people knew the comms, you know, and then they are like, to the guys, more followers, they are like, Okay, this guy is the best, because he's most famous. And this guy knows better, because he has more followers, he understand that kind of
Engin Terzi: mindset while the in between the arm masters you know that that opinion is quite different you know yeah yeah yeah i know but i always say we we all bleed red you know we should just be kind and work hard you know that's it yeah yeah yeah yeah so if we come to uh east versus west yeah and
Engin Terzi: let's start from the one that i think maybe the most interesting for you uh rebecca versus fia yes i love both of them yeah what kind of how do you rate that matchup how do i rate it how do you rank how do you rank is it with a very high level match in your opinion rebecca just won the world championship and so did fia
Sarah Backman: And beat Glatka, yeah? And quite easily in the final, yeah. Yes, they're current world champions in two different classes by going against each other. It's fun. I like those matches. They're great. Bath are great pullers.
Engin Terzi: yeah i think it's cool too because remember for um yalova we were trying to get rebecca to pull me but she wasn't ready then so i guess she's back now in full force you know so that's cool um yeah do you know why she wasn't ready because we thought that she remember in 2019 she pulled 80 kilo at love yeah so we were thinking that maybe she would be 80 so whenever i i asked her she said i mean i'm only 66 kilo
Engin Terzi: know and and that is how we saw that she won just 65 kilo category at wealth and now we're gonna see you know both are technically also they're not only you know there are there are some arm masters just just strong you know you know and some are very good technical and these two girls are very good about technique you know and then i just can't wait and i know you are originally from sweden but can you have a prediction like without
Engin Terzi: any effects of your nationalistic feelings
Sarah Backman: Uh, I mean, I love Thea. Thea is my first ever training partner. Like I've known her for 16 years. Um, I obviously want her to win, but the thing with Thea, she never stopped arm wrestling. Like I've known her for 16 years. Right. And she has competed every single year. Like she never took time off. She even like got pregnant twice and she competed with a big stomach and, um, at the world, um,
Sarah Backman: Swedish championship and she won the heavyweight and then she gave birth a couple of days later. And then she came back to the sport one month later, like she just she just never stops. So with that being said, she brings all types of shapes to the table, like sometimes like naturally, you know, because she never takes time off. Sometimes, you know, she does amazing and sometimes she's not doing as good as she wants.
Sarah Backman: Cause she's always so high up here. So with that being said, I know her potential, but unless everything fits right where it needs to, I can, I can see Rebeka beat her. You know, she, Rebeka looked solid at the world championship, like her wrist hand. Yes. I mean, yes. Yeah. I mean, that's what I'm saying. Like she, she could be anybody at any given day, but yeah.
Engin Terzi: You know, whenever I look at this match, I see like two warriors, you know, like really pure arm wrestlers. You know, Fia is just like a warrior, you know, she's just like, she is just a hundred percent arm wrestling. And when you look at Rebeka, Rebeka is also has, I mean, just pure arm wrestlers. She just cares about going and winning. They don't really, you understand what I mean? You know, they are just like, whenever I look at them, it is just like, I see.
Sarah Backman: like arm wrestling at its best you know just but i have no idea you continue i cut your word sorry no no you that's a great input right there like um it's extremely high level uh for female arm wrestling i hope fia wins but i i can see it go maybe how many is it best out of five yeah the one reaches three finishes oh okay
Sarah Backman: yeah i think fia will win uh probably three three two but i definitely can see a war and some back and forth three two to fia i would say yeah yeah you know sometimes sarah the result on the paper does not represent the difficulty of the match the match can finish three zero but
Engin Terzi: within the rounds it's so close you know yeah you understand so what i'm just saying that even one of them means three zero i don't think that it will be easy match unless we don't know something you know just i don't know yeah and what do you think about fear fear's level is uh like usually like glottal level
Sarah Backman: Yes. Yes. I look at them as the same. They were supposed to have a match just a month ago in Russia. I guess something happened with COVID. I look at them as the same, like whoever woke up and had a better day, you know, always ready. And Gladkaya, same thing. She never stopped. I've been in arm wrestling for 15, 16 years. She's always, she competes all the time. Like, you know, I take time off, you know, I, I prepped for,
Engin Terzi: tournaments like once in a while but these girls they just keep going so they yeah it's it's impressive to stay so high level yeah yeah there is uh honest critic sarah can you beat ryan's blue blue elbow integrity i don't know i don't know what i mean sarah can you beat ryan's bleed blue elbow integrity
Sarah Backman: your your english better than mine i don't know what he means i don't know what to say about that and i don't know why we keep talking about ryan i'll pull him in the dubai um and we'll see what happens yeah and and uh do you know well about angie since you you both live in uh u.s and jose
Sarah Backman: Yes, yes, yes. She lives in Canada or US? I think US, right? She's from Canada. Right. She goes back and forth, I think. I have never gripped up with her. But I mean, she's one of the best here. She always wins the tournaments and stuff. I think because Anna,
Sarah Backman: I feel like Anna is a little more determined, you know, I feel like she, but also I don't really, you know, I know Anna from a long time. I follow her on social media.
Sarah Backman: I don't know much about her more than she wins tournaments in the United States. I think it's super cool that she's finally leaving, going out to Europe. I think that's so healthy for anybody, especially Americans that only think that the world is here. You know, you got to travel to prove where you're at, to show, you know, show yourself, show the world who you are. I think Anna got this. It will be a good test for Angie to see where she is at.
Sarah Backman: 100 and i definitely have a little more experience i think um just traveling and culture in general because you never know what the culture is going to do to angie coming from america you know anna comes to you train you like she you know she might does it doesn't affect that much
Sarah Backman: I think it does. I'm very affected by my environment. So I like to settle in and just get as comfortable as I can because you are in a different country and you have to make sure that you get whatever food you want. Everything has to be good for you to perform well. Do you remember the bet you lost against me?
Sarah Backman: I did. Was it the one arm pull up? Yeah, two years ago. And I told you what, I needed three months to do that. I started training. It's hard. Could you ever do? I can't even hold the static. Yeah. But somehow for what's not holding the leg or the arm or the hand or what was that?
Sarah Backman: Hey, what would you say? What is it that fails on a one arm staticals? I don't know. It's probably everything. I can't hold even for a second. I'm like, Yeah, I mean, I haven't seen any female doing one arm pull up. Maybe there is someone but Gabby cannot do a one arm pull up but she can hang. Are you serious? Yeah.
Engin Terzi: one arm yeah wow both arms she can hold herself for like i think five seconds move to the other one hold move to the other one it's thickening like many people do when when they do pull up they do like this and they think that they do but for me for especially as an arm lesson when you do one arm pull up you need to also bring your elbow here to lock you know here you know not not only not only the arm but the the here needs to be here and then
Engin Terzi: to lock yourself there, you know. I used to do crazy, crazy, crazy things, crazy, crazy things, you know. Oh, I know. I know you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I've seen the picture. I had a friend, Chris Anderson from US. He was driving. We were doing roofing together. He had a truck on the backside of the truck. You know, there are bars, you know, like the bar over the license plate here, like that thing. I was pulling myself
Engin Terzi: while he's driving 70 miles an hour. And he's an armless. And then I was just in the air like this. My body was going to the road because of the wind. And then about one minute staying like this and one minute like this without putting my feet there till we go like 15, 20 minutes. But my hands were so strong that, I mean,
Engin Terzi: you really needed to cut my wrist to make me fall down, you know, the hand was, you know, very, very strong, yeah. He's an arm wrestler, people, some people, a lot of people knows him, they can ask him, you know, and I will do very crazy things, you know. Yeah, no, you're a different breed, Engin, like, you do things that not many people can do. Okay, Engin, okay, again,
Engin Terzi: honest critic thinking who will win you versus haji zola and alan i mean i versus haji or alan i mean i they would beat me they both would beat me uh until until i do uh prove otherwise i would say they would beat me but i have beaten haji before he has beaten me too um
Engin Terzi: Okay, if you go to the other matches, is there any match which is familiar? Oh yeah, John Brassens and Solo. I have a question for you. Like, I can say that 95%, maybe 98% of the males, even as arm wrestlers, not the fans, they don't know much about the female arm wrestling. Right. And does it apply to you about the male arm wrestling or you follow male arm wrestling?
Sarah Backman: Um, I follow arm wrestling, male arm wrestling to a certain degree. Um, um, not as much as I do the women, like, um, I know more than the guys know about the females, I would say, but, um, When you say like certain degree, how do you describe the degree? Do you mean the region or do you mean the level? The level. Okay. Then, then, you know, how'd you met them?
Sarah Backman: Oh yeah. Yeah. No, I, I, I, I will definitely. I've known him for years. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So what do you think about this? You remember you were here when Haji and Tuck Hutchings pulled. Yeah. Yep. Um, I think John Brzenk coming back, I think it's fantastic, but he has nothing really to prove. So I really think that he's just like testing himself again. Um,
Sarah Backman: Obviously, he's a champ, champion forever. I just think that Solo will come in extremely prepared for this. So you give the edge to Hadji? I do. Okay. Yeah. And also based on the last couple of matches Brzenk had, he went like from nothing to just straight to the top, you know, which is rightfully so. He can do that.
Engin Terzi: think solo is just he's taking that's extremely serious and um more motivated when you are pulling john you are more motivated yeah that's what it is yeah if you look at john's motivation to be in zola i don't think there is any like anything in the world that would motivate john like
Engin Terzi: he used to be you know because he has proven everything yeah i mean he has competitive nature but it doesn't mean i don't think that there is like whenever he sleeps you know he's like you know okay i have to do this you know i need to do that we have that i still have that dream you still have it but this guy has nothing to prove you know
Sarah Backman: nothing he it's just like a hobby i feel like at this point and he want to test himself and i think that's super cool and it's great for arm wrestling and we get to enjoy this but i think solo will come in as a better athlete and uh and and how about michael tobers again
Sarah Backman: Mm-hmm. Saying this, I think Genadi is extremely motivated since his last match where he lost against, who was it? Ermes... Ermes Gasparini. Yeah, yeah. So I think he's going to come in just more prepared this time around. But Michael Todd too, you know, he's...
Sarah Backman: We all know that Michael hates losing more than he loves to win. So he'll probably do whatever it takes. I can see it be like maybe one win to Genadi and the rest to Michael. I think Michael will come out on top. Yeah. Yeah.
Sarah Backman: Look at Genadi. Genadi is a good athlete over the years, but I don't look at him as the best champion recurringly. I think he has a win here and one win here, right? It's not consistent. So maybe if he wins this, he will be recognized as something. If Genadi wins this one, he will be around
Engin Terzi: Sertan Kabadayi, Ph.D.: fifth, sixth in the world ranking this what I believe. Sertan Kabadayi, Ph.D.: which. Sertan Kabadayi, Ph.D.: Already there, but you know. Sertan Kabadayi, Ph.D.: yeah there is. Sertan Kabadayi, Ph.D.: A row, thank you for support it does Sarah think that. Sertan Kabadayi, Ph.D.: She has any genetic advantages that have helped her in our missing.
Sarah Backman: Yes, definitely. The way I'm built and the way I respond to training goes faster for me than maybe other people. It's always been like that. Like when I started armwrestling, I went from nothing and within three months, six months, I just like, and it feels like if I put the work in, I get like instant
Sarah Backman: I don't know what it is. It's just my, my muscle type or whatever. It's just, I respond very well to training, but what I'm most like, I guess, proud of is my, my mind. It's just that obsession. It's like nothing else matters. Um, that's probably. Exactly. Exactly. I was waiting for you to say this thing because these are the tools, hard work, hard work, intelligence and capability.
Engin Terzi: at the table and that the law that the passion that you know you put arm wrestling to like your number one you know in life goal and that yeah i know you i know you yeah right from where you started it was middle of my career when you started and and this is what i see not everyone who trains not everyone who is strong is a great arm wrestler at the table
Engin Terzi: I mean, we can, we can, we can, there is different judgment. What is great? Our message, the one who wins is different type of grades. And the one that who has very good ability to arm wrestle, you know, is also, you are that way that you are, you are, you are. Yeah, probably with the hand risk control. I don't really see anyone, any female arm better than you right now in the world, you know, about the, yes, yes, yes. About the technical ability, you know,
Engin Terzi: the the female wrist is just created a little bit more sensitive compared to the men that's why you see a lot of matches going like this with the females yeah i call it a girl while you have a wrist like the men usually you know so that that is why you are kind of i'm not
Sarah Backman: compare men female thing or something just just as you see this is a little bit sensitive for the woman you know yeah yeah and you gotta stay consistent too you know there's a lot of arm wrestlers that do a little bit every day but when i train i train you know i it's like i go to work and i do my job and i want to be perfect at my job you know like i want to execute it and leave the gym
Sarah Backman: knowing that i gave it my all so like just to be able to push yourself beyond what you're able to do um and then be able to do it the next day and the next day and the next day like you you just have to stay consistent and you know push like it's not gonna come to you they're not gonna hand you this like that you gotta you gotta make an effort
Engin Terzi: And you got to make an effort harder than the other. Pay the price every time. They don't tell you, Sarah, you have so many world titles, you start like this. No, you need to start right here. And then again, you need to take the opponent here. So to do that, you need to pay the price, you know, and then come there, you know. That's what it is. Yep. And one guy asked us, thank you for the super chat. Again, honest critic. How much can you bought the single arm
Sarah Backman: or I'm close probably cold talking about the risk or my one rep max with with a dumbbell dumbbell Yeah, on your knee or something, you know, okay. I have to convert it because I, you know, American pounds, I can convert for you. Oh, 130 pounds. So about 59 kilo. Are you sure? Yeah, risk curve with a dumbbell. One hand? Yes. Wow.
Sarah Backman: i'm not gonna say my number i'm not gonna embrace myself that's my like one rep max though like you know i couldn't i haven't done it again you know same with the bicep curl i did it um with the 95 pounds 95 pound dumbbell bicep curl one time i could never do it again it was just a really good motion on the scorecard half motion no full motion like i was like this and
Engin Terzi: Okay. Yeah. Wow. Looks like you are heavier lifter than I am. I used to like to feel strong. It's, it's, it's impressive. Yeah. Yeah. I think, I think about the, uh, you know, for you to be able to use your, uh, arm wrestling quality first, you need to balance the match with Gabby.
Engin Terzi: because she is pure horsepower, sideways, pure horsepower. So you need to balance the match so that you can involve your technical abilities. Other than that, if the pressure is too much, then you may not involve your abilities. So I'm hoping that you're going to have the, when I say I'm hoping,
Engin Terzi: uh i i you know gabby is my friend i really respect her but it would be good to be one one and then do a final match yeah yeah we have the best out of six matches i think we have the pool so you may even need to win four rounds yeah no no no no of course you need to win anyways four rounds and actually there's this betting with devin the state kings and all that and i guess they changed the rules so
Engin Terzi: All I have to do is win one match, and I win the whole betting. Everybody that bet on me wins. Yeah, but winning betting is something that I'm least interested in. People just talk about that. I mean, we are arm masters. I care about who wins the supermatch, you know. Winning the bet is totally out of my subject. You know, people are like...
Engin Terzi: like just what you lost five, one, and then, oh, okay. I won the bet. Oh, good for you. You won the bet, but you lost the match. They don't write, you know, they look at it. There was a match in Dubai and this one against this one, this much, you know, they don't say who won the bets, you know? So that is why I hope that you are not focusing on that.
Sarah Backman: oh not at all not at all disappointed in you very disappointed oh no no it's not about that at all i'm used to explain that i'm coming in as the underdog all i have to do is one match to win everything she needs to win four matches so she like yeah so i i just have to go yeah i i'm hoping to
Engin Terzi: host uh gabriella as well you know in this uh youtube program and then yeah as i said you know i mean as you because of the last match you look underdog and now you're saying that you are in a great shape and you're gonna win this one and if you go a little bit uh more do you know do you know uh betkili you don't know betkili right from georgia yeah betkili is gonna pull oleg zok and
Engin Terzi: uh my student yusuf is gonna pull oleg cherkasov probably you may heard you know cherkasov but yeah i've heard the name is he from ukraine cherkasov is from uh russia russia okay yeah yeah 70 kilo world champion and last two times he won in a row 70 kilo and there is arif you don't know arif probably
Engin Terzi: I've been the super heavyweight champion of the world in the last two years. I mean, two times, I should say. He's going to pull with Ermes. Ermes is going to pull. So what do you think about that? I mean, I'm an emotional person, you know, and I have strong nationalistic feelings.
Sarah Backman: I understand. It's just that Ermes have been very impressive lately. What's that? Ermes have been very impressive. Like he has had a couple of matches, you know, and he has won almost everything he has done, you know, last year. Also, as an organizer, it is not that that.
Engin Terzi: good that you know i give names that i think this is gonna win while i'm hosting the event you know it's just like there are a lot of a lot of people the the travis the other day was saying that oh if engine is inviting you to turkey he's making sure that you're gonna lose or something it was just like i i mean come on travis you know just like i mean i know you he's trying to hype you understand hype so that you know he also invites me to the us for super match and seminar
Engin Terzi: But that's not hyping, you know, Travis, you're saying things which are not true, but you are creating hatred, you know, like, I mean, just imagine that I'm bringing here Todd Hutchings, I mean, versus Tsonev, who is 102 kilo. I mean, both are going inside. If I would want Hutchings to lose, I mean, I would invite, I don't know which Todd Hutchings already told me I would want to pull that guy, but that guy is 120, 125 kilo. He just looks at Zola's face and just,
Engin Terzi: Zoloev can't even move him. Not at all. He behaves like this. So I was thinking that, okay, this guy will probably take Tarkashin's wrist and beat easily. This is what everyone was telling me. So I was like, okay, I need someone to go inside with Tarkashin. And then, you know, it will be, let's let them prove, you know. But Trevor says, I mean, why didn't them to lose it? Just come on. You know, I invited John Brzenk. And because Zoloev is considered number one here. Of course he lost in the last swap, but I said this match,
Engin Terzi: before last, last month. So it was all a bit Hutchings. So if you bring in John here, it is like a title match. The one who is going to win is we going to be number one in the world. Yeah. Also like they say, Sundays would be a chance. I didn't even set that match chance that he wants to be involved. I said, of course. And then he chose that I want to pull Sundays. And I said, listen, chance Sunday is a strong guy. He said, okay, I'm strong too. You know?
Engin Terzi: I want to try it, so that is not I said, you know, like same like Ron bet he in a with a interview with john he said that hey if you hear me set me a match to so yeah he's hundred 12 kilo.
Engin Terzi: I sent him 85-kilo world champion Zurab Tavberidze, but he was, when I asked him, he was 97-kilo, now 95-kilo. So how am I sending someone for a run to lose? Just these are like total, like Michael told Genadi, like is Genadi someone that like, oh yeah, he's going to destroy Michael? No, right? Yeah, so. No, no, I mean, Trevor says these kind of things, and then people write, yeah, I think Engin is that way. I mean, Engin is not even 1% that way.
Engin Terzi: Hamed Nademi, Ph.D.: And he loves arm wrestling and he is risking a lot of things from himself to organize this event, so he can serve to arm wrestling community. Hamed Nademi, Ph.D.: And I would only expect to say thank you, instead of you telling me these things I don't deserve you know and that kind of. Hamed Nademi, Ph.D.: discourages me, but whenever I see 98% of people say thank you, thank you for these events, and you know this interviews with this guy and they motivate me so I just I'm kind of a little bit too sensitive guy you know but.
Sarah Backman: yeah focus on the positive like oh my goodness like there's always no matter what you do like if you say that you like when the sun is out somebody's gonna say well why do you do that it's better when it rains you know like there's always somebody that's gonna talk
Engin Terzi: But why are they doing this? Why are they doing this? Like, you know, as a normal human being, you know, I mean, you say, like, people want to, like, for example, take me aside, like, either Devon is the greatest ever, he's the best, everything, you know, and the other ones, oh, Devon is just not like that, you know, like, why do I need to, you know, join one of them? Why can I not say as much as he deserves, you know, okay, Devon is one of the greatest ever armwrestlers, you know.
Engin Terzi: but you know john is the greatest we know from the past what's what's going on yeah like why can we why can we not be objective and then just say everything as much as it deserves instead of being so blindly you know you're going either black side or the white side you know i don't understand yeah yeah there's a few a few questions and in probably 15 minutes i i let you go i know you need to work you told me uh honest critic
Engin Terzi: Thanks Sarah, 130 pounds, holy moly, we give up. Yeah, I give up too. That's why I didn't want to mention the way that I'm... Okay. There is Peter, thank you for super chat. Sarah, do you think that top level woman like yourself should be allowed to compete
Engin Terzi: in the lightweight men's category. Love you. Guys, stay strong. I think you are already allowed to compete. You sometimes compete, right?
Sarah Backman: yes i have been denied a couple times too because they're i guess worried for how the men are gonna feel um but most most promoters let me um as long as i make the weight why not you know if i you know i weigh in like i wouldn't i wouldn't allow you to compete like national championships and world championships
Engin Terzi: See, but for those events, you know, just why not, you know, try it. Okay, the organizer didn't want or the openness didn't want? The organizer? Organizer, yeah. What was his reason? Okay, so one time they said that they don't want to hurt the feelings of the guys.
Sarah Backman: like you know all right then but yeah actually my most like proudest win was when i won um seven to five kilo men class in florida uh 14 14 guys in the class and it was around robin and i won undefeated so it's probably my best win over all like there's a question who are your favorite arm masters
Sarah Backman: um yeah for female for female it would be irina makeva i just think that she's flawless um i love her personality too like she's just like chill and i think she has a very nice style um i don't really have a favorite guy arm wrestler to be honest how can you not be a fan of john brazil
Sarah Backman: I mean, of course, you know, but I had different reasons. Like I would probably say that you, you are my favorite in the sense that you are like decades and decades, just world champion, world champion, keep pushing whatever you're doing for the sport now. Like you, you, I admire you so much for what you have done, you know? Um, but, um, and then we have, you know, John Brasink same reason, but.
Sarah Backman: i'm not going to the gym and be like all right because john bersink you know i'm gonna train like i i'm i admire him from afar i think it's amazing i love it you know but like i go to the gym and think about gabby i go to the gym and think about egla you know so oh it's a different thing different thing yeah yeah i i like for example i never have like i need to be john brusing not even once come to my mind i am who i am i am in interstate
Engin Terzi: But whenever I look at him, I see something better than me. I'm saying, okay, this guy is doing what he does at its best. This is the only reason I have. I don't think that wannabes can do something great. You need to be yourself first. You need to say, I am this person, and I am going to be at the top with my own name. Yes, exactly. Okay.
Sarah Backman: Ben Young, will you ever return to Sweden? No. Probably for visit, right? I don't know about that. COVID, they closed the borders. I haven't been to Sweden. But it's not going to be forever, you know, hopefully. Hopefully. I mean, yeah, we'll see. But I love the United States. This is my home. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: honest critic. I felt Travis friend about you was in poor taste. And yeah, Sarah is the real gatekeepers of North American arm wrestling. Sarah is technically right there. You know, I don't see anyone about her technically. I mean, she's my favorite arm wrestler. She arm wrestles like, I mean, so good, you know, about the horsepower, they may be
Engin Terzi: They may be people who are stronger than her. We don't know. We don't know. But technically, when I watch, I really enjoy the way she pulls. And she knows that. Yeah. And about the strength, soon we will find out. I can't gauge that. Because her opponent is also incredibly strong. I mean, whenever I look at the videos of Gabi, the way that she's doing those pull-ups and the rope pull-ups, you know, like that.
Engin Terzi: how you know like she's just putting like you know she's incredibly strong yeah she is incredibly strong you know I mean it is impossible to not do I mean respect or you know impossible you know Irina Makeva Egle I mean now Fia is like
Engin Terzi: someone to respect that how she's like she just she loves it you know the only reason that she didn't continue ifa and came up because she wanted to compete at where the best is you know she didn't want to choose somewhere that she could easily win and brag like i'm i'm i'm the world champion while she knows that the tougher competition much tougher competition is there
Engin Terzi: So really, about these kind of things, I don't really have, like, it's not about VAR or IFA or something, but if you really want to say I'm the world champion, you know, where the competition is. Yeah, you have to go to WAF. And I would rather place fourth in WAF than first in IFA, just because it shows you, you know, it's the real deal. I say this, people got so much angry with me. Who said? Who got angry?
Engin Terzi: many people many people that whenever i see that you know like there are like 15 20 people from same country competing and when i didn't think that it was the really like you know world championship there should be like georgia kazakhstan bulgaria turkey you know russia you know just like whenever you go there you know like you want to look at it good that i i stopped at 2018 whenever i am thinking and just looking at my weight class i'm like okay you beat this guy and then you need to be this guy too
Engin Terzi: This guy has a shoulder pressure. This guy is going to go top row. This guy is going to go side pressure. This is going to go hook and all of them. And you need to pass them quick so that you can be fresh enough to continue. And you are over 45. I was like, okay, it's enough for me. I want 2018. I want nothing more of that nightmare. It is a nightmare, you know.
Sarah Backman: yeah so much stress and anxiety yeah yeah it's like going to war you know literally you have to be able to end yourself in everything like you said press you have to you have to beat them all in order to win and that it's it's it's it's a lot of stress it will be very good you know if you also come this year and then we will see yes definitely yeah and then so we are let's slowly
Engin Terzi: uh finish there is no more super chat is there anything you would like to uh add say sarah before um
Sarah Backman: I think we covered everything. I just want to say thank you for everything that you do for armwrestling. Thank you for staying so active on Facebook. I feel like you're definitely the center that like brings everybody together. You're educating people. You are about, you know, a lot of people don't know what's out there.
Sarah Backman: You know, I feel like you, you recognize the real athletes, the real, the real ones in the world. And I think, I think that's really good. Keep posting your posts, you know, you're funny too. Cause it's like one every hour and it could be random things, something that you think about and you just, it's like your own little diary. And I just love to follow. I really hope that, you know, majority of the fans will understand that, you know,
Engin Terzi: I don't want to say this here, I don't want people to think I'm not humble or something, but majority of people still don't know a lot of people that are not a social media phenomenon. You know what I mean? Like, yeah, they think that because you are not so famous, you don't know much. You don't know more than his favorite athlete that while they don't even realize it, many of them learn a lot from me.
Engin Terzi: but they just think that, okay, you have less followers, so probably you don't know that much.
Sarah Backman: It just probably, I don't know. That's the good thing with you because I feel like you're so objective. You just give everybody the info, like you give them the facts. All right, this guy is the heavyweight champion in WEF 2017. He has done this, this, this. Like you can back up everything you say with facts instead of somebody that says, well, I think, you know, and then because they have some type of relationship or fan or, you know, something, you actually can back
Engin Terzi: back up everything you say and that that deserves a lot of respect i saw yesterday someone said about john john doesn't understand that he should not arm muscle in the strap you know like whenever i'm like you know
Engin Terzi: don't John doesn't understand something about armresting but you know that thing that what he doesn't know and then you're talking about him you know I was like you know like I you know many people considers me you know like John many times told me and you are the most knowledgeable arm master ever lived this is what he told me yes I'm not saying I am I know a lot but there are things that I don't know as well but I would never even in my mind
Engin Terzi: think that john doesn't know anything about himself john may not know something about i'm doing but about what he he is doing to tell him that he doesn't understand you just like i was like wow where are we going you know just like i mean you tell michael jordan hey michael jordan
Engin Terzi: listen, this part you don't, or Aleksandr Karelian, that you don't understand, Karelian, you know, just, I mean, it's okay, you know, we will, hopefully, hopefully it's new, it's growing, and hopefully big time they will understand that, you know, that there are a lot more than what they have seen, you know. Anyways, thank you very much. Please tell Mike, I said hello, and sorry, just one guy, I don't want him to upset, just right now, he said, what is it, Rave?
Sarah Backman: Does Sara have any aspirations to start a club and build North American armwrestling, especially women's armwrestling? Oh, do I have any plans? I mean, it's not like I'm going on tours and push for women's armwrestling, but I feel like me and my husband are building kind of an armwrestling
Sarah Backman: thing here in florida uh in our area uh our gym alone has probably around 10 arm wrestlers now i know it doesn't seem a lot but it was just me from the beginning you know so i mean we recruit one after one and i i just hope by staying or you know showing my progress on social media maybe women will be like inspired maybe to do it and that would be the best thing ever i
Engin Terzi: you know i miss that's what i miss with sweden you know at any given time there would be strong girls to train with and i haven't had that i also would like to thank you for representing our sport by being one of those windows to outside of you know arm wrestling community to the world you know and because of you many people knows about arm wrestling and yeah as i said you are one of the
Engin Terzi: best arm wrestlers, female arm wrestlers on the earth. And I wish you the best versus Gabi. Gabi is my friend too. But I don't know why. I just can't think that, you know, you make it 1-1 and then there will be the third supermatch, you know. It would be incredible. It would be so cool if you went to Dubai too. I'm planning. But yeah, I think I can. On March 18, I have a supermatch with John Brzenk in Norway.
Engin Terzi: You didn't know? No, no. You said you follow me. Okay, I don't really mention a lot, but yeah. Yeah, yeah. Good luck with that. What do you think? Would you watch such a match? What is the weight limit for that? 102. And what do you weigh? Now about 92, 93, but I will probably be 95, 96. Yeah, don't underestimate me.
Sarah Backman: no are you going with the arm that you injured yes oh okay all right yeah well i believe you can come back stronger after an injury i did so and i i know your mind you know you're you're yeah yeah if i'm going somewhere i i i would know you know like what what to do yes and you wouldn't accept the match i think if you knew it wasn't you know i i i you you're gonna bring the best
Engin Terzi: Yeah, I'm going there to win, but in my objective opinion, I'm giving him hard time, but not winning, but we will see. That'd be awesome. Cool. Yeah. Thank you very much once again, Sarah. And hope to see you another time. Maybe we do one, maybe in the future together with you and Gabi. I can steer the boat. I can steer the boat between you two ladies. That'd be awesome. I love it. And hope to see you in Dubai. Maybe I make it. Okay? Yes. Thank you, Engin.
Engin Terzi: You take care. Bye bye.
