Alex Kurdecha: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Wait a second. I'll try to connect it via Bluetooth. It can be better. But I hope it will be better.
Engin Terzi: Now you hear me. Okay. No idea what I hardly hear you. Yes, yes, like barely hearing you. Let me try. I don't know if everyone else are hearing you well but
Alex Kurdecha: because i'm at the earbuds so if it's the same width and without so i have no idea but before that i was without it let me try this one maybe it will make
Engin Terzi: Some difference, but I don't know. Hello. Hello.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, can you talk? I don't know, I hardly hear you. Can you hear me now or not? No, I don't know why. I don't know if everyone else is hearing well, but... Guys, do you hear both of us very well? Okay, okay, okay. Yeah?
Engin Terzi: So I hear you, I hear you normally. Now I hear you well as well. So you hear me now good, yeah? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Okay, that's good. Yeah. So I think we can start. Yeah, nice to see you. So how have you been?
Unknown: good um i think now maybe something with internet because i see on this picture a few and actually i don't
Unknown: Hmm, I don't know why. I cannot reach you anymore. Oh, okay, you are out, I think. Yep, that's why. Yep, he wants to enter again, sorry guys. And...
Alex Kurdecha: I'll just enter again and I'll just connect it. I think there was a connection problem. Oh, yeah, but I think it shows me that on my side it's like five of five. You hear me now? Yeah, I tried to understand, but
Alex Kurdecha: Can you speak again? Yeah, yeah, I'm now hearing you. Yeah, yeah. So I hope everything is going to be okay after now. So how have you been? This is what I was asking. Oh, so everything is cool. Like, we have Christmas, so I wish you also Merry Christmas now. And a perfect New Year's Eve and good holidays, yeah. Uh-huh.
Engin Terzi: Yeah. I wish you the best New Year's holidays to you and all your subscribers, you know, guys who all see us now. Best wishes for everyone. Yeah. Yeah. There is already a super chat, Sean Crowther, I think. I don't know how to pronounce. Thank you. Alex is quiet and muffled. Engin, can you also switch the video call to gallery?
Engin Terzi: view so we can see both of you at same time you know i hardly was able to do this you know um sorry i'm not really good at it i think i will get better you know about it yeah so you hear me clean right yeah i'm absolutely clear okay yeah just a little bit speak louder because there is something wrong probably with my phone okay yeah yeah as much louder as i can yeah okay okay
Engin Terzi: Yeah. So you pull Ermes Gasparini and then majority of the world accepted you as one of the top guys at the moment. People have different ideas where you should be ranked and but
Engin Terzi: Guys, I won't be able to answer every question like I usually do when I'm alone because I would like to really chat with him and I will try to ask your questions as well, but just don't be upset if I can't. But, you know, after you won against Ermes, people said that, okay, you know, some of them said that, okay, maybe Ermes wasn't that good.
Engin Terzi: You understand? Yeah. And then I didn't think that way because Adam has talked with me. He said, and you know, I was even stronger than, uh, when I pull, uh, Matt, uh, when he pulled you.
Engin Terzi: So he said that, you know, there is nothing wrong with my shape. And he said, you know, Alex is just in a great shape. The guy is probably Latin level. You know, I also thought the same. And then after that, he went only three weeks later and pulled Genadi and won. And people said, OK, yeah, Ermes is not in bad shape, but this Alex is better. You know, I always thought of you like you have like you have great potential.
Engin Terzi: you agree or you don't agree, but the way that you were pulling before and the way that you started to pull recently, you know, there was some break, you know, from the last time we saw you versus Krasimir till you pull Ryan Espin now, Ermes Gasparini. So could you like also agree that, you know, you like, even if you didn't get so much stronger, but you became more effective by just trying to add
Alex Kurdecha: more to your pulling skills do you think the same way or i am absolutely agree with you yes absolutely true because previously i was the guy who have some power some level of the power but previously i like uh
Alex Kurdecha: don't know how to use correct the power i don't have any idea just like trying to do something that i saw other guys doing and it was not the proper technique it was like big and huge mistakes from my side so uh previously i just wanted like uh pull other guy in my open and steal the fat yeah now sometimes before the match
Alex Kurdecha: I'm firstly trained in different way, absolutely different. These two years of pandemia give me the time to think how to train better and how to train for aim, for some goals. So now if I want to be stronger in some moment, which I don't be using during the pool, I'm like trying to prepare myself during training exactly for this.
Alex Kurdecha: uh actually uh i'm much more stronger in some arm wrestling movements now yeah yeah i agree two years before uh for example i don't have uh for example a side after that i'm starting to understand how important for me
Alex Kurdecha: and how to train it so and uh even a small difference in that gives me much more possibilities of course of course it's everything is in the details you know you were just going one way you were only targeting to take open attempts
Engin Terzi: you were like you were very successful about this but you were not successful about beating the arm to the pad but now you are using more of your wrist more of side pressure you are more connected before you were getting a little bit like yeah and now you let everything you are like connected you know you are like you were very stronger but you were not using your strength as good as possible is this what i'm saying yeah yeah it's true and uh actually i want to say that even now
Alex Kurdecha: I know that I'm only in the beginning of my way. Only now I'm starting to understand the importance of small things, like you say. But now I know that I can improve, that I see that I can do something correct and how much it gives me later. So I know how in one or two or three or four years I can be
Engin Terzi: much more better. I will tell you, I'm happy to hear all this. I'm very happy to hear this from you, because, you know, Alex, when you think that, you know, like I am like there, you understand, then the progress there is finished. When you say that now that you are just starting to understand and you are on your way, you know,
Engin Terzi: um what makes us uh so great our body is controlled by by the brain the way that we are thinking so whenever you think that okay i'm great you know like i don't need to do anything you know that that that is going to make you stay where you are now but when you are thinking that i need to do a lot i'm only in the beginning that is the very dangerous thing it is that the mindset is even more dangerous than your physical abilities because that mind wants much more
Alex Kurdecha: and then is realistic to see where it is and then is just realizing that you know he can add even a lot more so that that is great thing that i hear about you right now i'm very happy to hear that way yeah thank you so much for this words but it's absolutely true i agree with you because like uh when i understand when i'm now and i see how much more i can do and and i need to do this and i understand how to do this
Alex Kurdecha: understand how how better i can be so i also believe in my potential because i see that i can do pretty good progress if i do correct things so if i do correct things i'm moving forward and the first very important thing i think is ask yourself how to be better and what to do to be better sometimes when i think the end of the match with hermes i respect him very much he
Alex Kurdecha: He's a very strong young athlete and I see he has a very bright future and he's already one of the main stars in the wrestling arena. And like I said after our match, sometimes we don't want the match. So even I don't call it the lose the match, but it means that this lesson, when you see
Alex Kurdecha: that you don't have something when you start to understand that you need to have it and you start to ask yourself how to train properly these things how to use your body how to use your feelings and it's yeah it's better and after that this lesson you become better so sometimes loses gives you more ways and more possibilities to become better because that's the answer how to be better you know that's why i i don't think about losing
Engin Terzi: Evgeny when you win,
Engin Terzi: you should learn. Like you won against Ermes, but you can say that, okay, I won, but I think here should be better, you know, because maybe Ermes gave me this much of damage, but maybe Laletin or Levan is going to give that problem even, they are going to make it even bigger for me. So that is even when we win, we must not be drunk from like victory, you understand? And still learn, you know, that is the way, because if you don't learn,
Engin Terzi: every time then they are you're gonna learn when you when you lose next time you know so that is yeah this exactly um i want to ask you something but you know i know you would like to be probably a humble person i see that you're a respectful uh person as well uh but if you just would say like honestly like where do you see yourself right now i think i will see myself in top eight right now
Engin Terzi: no no like like like like like like if i ask in a specific way like if if they say three four months from now you have a super match with italy uh la latin and and like do you say that okay i'm ready for it in if i have this much of time you know or you know i will be honest with you
Alex Kurdecha: I know that Vitaly trained like 15 years or maybe more than 15 years to be where he is now. I respect it very much. Also the same about Levan. I watched his progress, I watched his won and his loses. I know that he made a big job, big work to be there now. And for myself, I'm absolutely happy about my results and I'm absolutely
Alex Kurdecha: hungry about my future results. I want to work hard. I'm ready to work hard and I work hard already now. And I will work even hard because I love what I'm doing. And, uh, I have these, uh, these, my dreams, my goals. I want to pull with the best guys in the world. And for example, when you asked me about who with Vitaly, I think Vitaly is absolutely like top arm wrestler of the world right now.
Alex Kurdecha: And I know that he also hard work now and he will be ready and he will be very good. He like know what to expect from myself. And of course I know what to expect from him because he's the top guy. And if I need to be shortly, I will do everything to be ready to get or equal, at least equal match with him. I know how strong he is. I know how he's more experienced than me.
Alex Kurdecha: but I'm already like been in the role of underdog. I know that in this match, everyone should say that I'm underdog, but I'm okay with that. I'm like, I was deferring, I also was underdog. Actually, honestly, when I was even full with Tobias Foren, also a lot of guys in New York State knew that I'm underdog now because
Alex Kurdecha: he progressed pretty much he's bigger and that moment because he was like in here or 134 or 32 kilos and before he was only 112 or something like that i can't remember sure but he was smaller and he becomes bigger and everyone say that he's younger he's faster and also they say that i was underdog but so you know when you hungry to the victory
Engin Terzi: This is exactly what I told to Ermes.
Engin Terzi: This is exactly what I told Ermes, you know. Ermes asked me, Turbin is injured, and then now they are saying, they are telling me to pull Alex Kurdesha. Which one do you think was better for me? I said, we know, we know, we know Turbin. We know his limits. We know what we can do, but we don't know about Kurdesha. I said, he's very hungry and he's dangerous. His arm is very tall. I said, you know, I think, you know,
Engin Terzi: he is more dangerous what i told him already because we are like we have close uh relationship with him and then yeah this is exactly you know uh what happened so you are saying that you are ready to face him face you are ready to face devon you are ready to face anyone like let me go one more step are you ready for that one as well you know if you ask me i won the pool with him or not
Alex Kurdecha: will say absolutely i want to fall with him for example in half a year only four months uh i want to pull with level but also i need to be honest with you and add something i know that in one year i will be even more dangerous opponent than i'm now i know it yes for sure and also in two years i will be even more dangerous i know because i thought i saw now what the progress can be
Alex Kurdecha: if i just uh you just i'm a polite student and do step after step after step i know that sometimes you don't need to be in a hurry you know to do something quickly you just need a good student learn something of your body of your mind of your heart and do steps so if you ask me i think of course like now i'm much more better than
Engin Terzi: years before it's true yeah i i don't be don't humble if i think because i think that i think that you know during the pandemic you are the athlete that most progressed but your progress is not only about the strength but because you are now more like well-rounded you can believe in like half hook you can move side by side because i don't see you now okay one of us is probably out but i don't know which one is
Engin Terzi: i don't know do you hear me now i mean i i hear you but i i don't see you yeah yeah uh there is there is there is one super chat phil woody uk thank you uh he says uh wish to see master michael todd versus kurdesha onwards to 2022.
Engin Terzi: Oh, yeah, you're out again. Okay, let me get in. There's some bad connection, I think. Good day. She is connecting. Sorry, guys. Probably bad connection. Hey, hello. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I hear you. Do you? You hear now? Yes. Because before that, it was like a lock of the screen. And I saw only your picture and I don't hear you.
Engin Terzi: there's another one white wolf thank you for super chat happy new year to both of you alex are you still in canada who did you get to pull while there devon matt mask beer man pork chop and best wishes he says did you pull any of these guys oh thank you for the wishes and uh when i've been now i'm come back to poland i've been in canada during a few weeks uh and uh we planned to meet with devon but it was just so
Alex Kurdecha: time when he already was prepared for the match with john uh like the flight to dubai a little bit earlier and i have for my seminars also in uh in the uk and uh in the 12th of december uh i need so i need to take a slide before so we like uh miss uh each other but we plan to to train together and i think in the nearest future when i go back to the canada we will meet
Alex Kurdecha: with other guys so because metmas it's uh other parts of canada so like it's so needs to fly there or four days of ride by car so canada is actually a huge country for example we uh have visited some clubs and we
Alex Kurdecha: drive by car to the club and you know, it's a huge distance actually. So compared to Poland, Poland is something small and Canada is something more than the European Union. So I'm trying to visit as much clubs as I can. I meet Grady George. I meet a lot of cool guys in Canada, best wishes for all of you guys from Canada, all Canadian amateurs which I already meet and we spend a beautiful time.
Engin Terzi: I hope when I come back, I can meet even more guys. But at this moment, only a few of clubs. I want to ask you, you follow the super matches at the East versus West? I've seen that. You saw the list? Yeah, I saw the list. Which one of them do you think is the most interesting for you? For me?
Alex Kurdecha: Like, I honestly say that it's a great list. Huge respect to organizers, to you and for this beautiful list. I hope in the future I will be probably part of this list. And for me now, in this moment, I'm really interested about the level between Michael and Genadi. Because for me, it will be some kind of answer, like where we are. Because the name of the list is beautiful. West versus East.
Alex Kurdecha: And for me, it's always interesting to compare, for example, how strong West guys to compare for our Eastern guys. Yeah. And also there is a beautiful matches, for example, Haji Murad and John. Okay. What's your opinion? You know, I, I think that it can be a equal match that we will not fast match that I want to see, honestly.
Alex Kurdecha: Honestly, if you ask me, I say like, for example, 50-50, maybe, maybe I will give a little bit more percent for John. Because in the heart, I always want to add some percentage to John. So it's like, I know, so I need to be objective. Yeah, I need to be realistic. But always my heart wants to add some percentage to John in every situation.
Alex Kurdecha: But what I want to see, I want to see equal match, interesting match. And I think that there are the chances of equal match between Haji Murad, because Haji Murad also is a great, one of the greatest hookers. And even though prepared, I think it can be long and interesting match between these guys. What do you think about Tata Sings versus Yordan Tsonev? Did you see Yordan lately versus the guy? I don't know.
Alex Kurdecha: boguslov yeah yeah yeah i know that boguslov was very prepared yeah yes i was surprised i'm surprised he couldn't win you know great job by your sonia was amazing he was amazing technically he was amazing by his endurance and actually he shows how strong he oh he's very strong but uh todd hutchins can be very tough opponent
Alex Kurdecha: So this will be one of the best answers between West and East. For example, I don't know, can I call that Todd is the strongest representative of West in his category? Because probably, I don't know the level difference between Todd and John now. I don't know the difference. Bath of them are here in this event. Yes, yes. So, but I, you know,
Alex Kurdecha: Also, maybe I give a little bit more percent for Todd because of previous his fighting with the guys. For example, in Moldova, he was pulling with Krasi and he won with Krasi. So maybe now on the start, I will give some more percentage to Todd, but I will be absolutely happy if Tony will make a surprise for me and show that he is the owner of the match and he can win.
Engin Terzi: There are a few Super Chats, like Salt, Wash, no, I think, sorry about it, Science, Engin Love You, Noura Staple, all his supporters represent the past and present. Also Pradeep versus me super much, not a fan of his channel. And I don't want to get involved about Sean Crowther.
Engin Terzi: thank you for super chat and just want to say thank you very much and you for what you are doing for our support you're welcome and i thank you guys for supporting us your east versus west events are mind-blowing keep up the awesome work yeah it will be great last time you guys have some uh
Engin Terzi: complainings about the light and this, and this time, yeah, we took it in a good way, and then we are not gonna make any more, any mistake like that. And it will be very, very good broadcasting. And White Wolf, best quote from Alex at Arm Wars, talking about Ryan Espey, he was fantastically strong, but I was stronger then. Crazy level, yeah, yeah, yeah, both are strong, but Alex is right now probably in another level, yep.
Alex Kurdecha: And if we talk about some other matches, are you familiar with Betkili Oniani? You know, honestly, I don't watch a lot of his matches. I'm here, I know his name, absolutely. And I know that probably he will be with Oleg Dzok, yes?
Engin Terzi: yes he's 90 kilo his teammates always he was used he used to pull 75 he's about 190 he's very tall for his category and then he pulled 80 kilo and he was second but his opponent first place was disqualified so he took the gold as far as i know and so he won the 80 kilo world and this year they couldn't come because although there's some conflicts you know some problems and so his teammates always told me that you know when he's 90 kilo
Engin Terzi: he is at another level but when he's like 190 you know long reach and everything very good hook inability and i think that you know there is a possibility i don't know in which shape zoc is gonna be there but zoc looks like you know almost back because he won european awards over a very strong opponents and so i maybe like i don't know i'm expecting a surprise there but you know you never know it's all exact
Alex Kurdecha: He beat many, many great super heavyweights. Other than that, we have some others. Arif will pull Ermes. I don't know if you followed the last WAF super heavyweights. Did you watch them? Yeah, I watched Arif. I actually know Arif. He has a lot of big matches behind him. I remember that I also pulled with him in 2017.
Alex Kurdecha: And in the moment when I go to Pug with him, I remember that I watched even previous his matches. I know that he won with Lewand, with Genadi, with Grasimir probably.
Alex Kurdecha: I watched his big matches and I know that after that, when I fought with him and I won with him, my guys from Poland, who have been on those matches where Arif makes something so bright, say to me, if you won with Arif, you can probably win with everyone after that. Because previously we didn't know how strong Levan was in that year, because in that year, in 2017, Levan won the Zloty Tur. So before that,
Alex Kurdecha: He has some losses with other guys, and the whole Polish team tells me that, for example, now no one knows who is the strongest. So Ertem Arif is the guy that if he will come back with the shape he was and even better,
Engin Terzi: No, no, he's in much better shape. That year, 2017, I don't think he got medal in WAF and Europeans. But 2018, again, he was like 12th or 13th or something. But 2019 and 2021, this year, he won WAF. In 2019, he didn't win so easy in the final.
Engin Terzi: uh against mitko from bulgaria but this year including mitko shedco all of the other guys you know he won't he won't uh easy i think his point style is a little bit different now and there some people thinking that you know he's heavily underdog versus uh hermes but that also um i'm not sure about it because uh i talked with him the way that he's gonna pull is uh like different than you know uh
Engin Terzi: people are maybe expecting maybe they expect like a top role versus top role but it may be it may be a little bit different because i know arm wrestling and i know his abilities i saw him at waf how he pulled and yeah if he is getting any better than that till that time and then there may be some some uh some good match you know this this is what i expect also other than that we have um
Engin Terzi: some other matches as well uh uh we have um chan show versus sundries and these people also think that sundries is heavily favorite i also agree that sundries is heavy favorite if we judge
Engin Terzi: Chance, as we know, but Chance also told me that he will be much better than the shape that we remember him. Do you know them? Do you know Chance? Do you know Sandris? Yeah, of course I know Sandris. I know also Chance. Bath of them are beautiful athletes. But I think that Sandris, honestly, in my opinion,
Alex Kurdecha: a little bit far in the way of arm wrestling. So I mean that he like arm wrestler, he's more arm wrestler than Chance. Chance is a beautiful athlete, but maybe he needs a little bit more time, like me also. I know myself, for example, two years before and now, and probably like it's a difference, like the same for the Chance can be. So now he like in the way of learning himself and he's in the progressing way,
Alex Kurdecha: But maybe I'm mistaken. Chance showed that he's already in that level. But in the beginning, in this moment today, I will say that Sandris is a favorite of this match because of his mindset now and he's already like,
Alex Kurdecha: has passed way behind them because behind him it means that he's already a little bit more arm wrestler he knows how to use his wrist his arm and his like power so it will be hard uh to it will be harder to work with the guy who is more experienced
Alex Kurdecha: even if he has much more power than you, but he is more experienced. So I believe that it will be a little bit harder for Chance to win versus Sandris. And then for Sandris, one versus Chance. So because of that, I say that Sandris is favored. I have a question for you. If you would make top five in the world,
Engin Terzi: including or excluding yourself it doesn't matter if you want to include include if you say that you know i don't want to uh judge my own uh level you know that you if you think that it's not gonna be humble or something you can actually as well what is your top fight can you say or you would be afraid to upset people no no absolutely i can say it uh for the first it's very easy to say the answer for me in the first place it's 11
Alex Kurdecha: uh in a second it's also for me in now in this moment it's very easy i put vitale in the second because i don't know the match or versus for example i know i know michael todd can be and he like deserved to be in the five and also they chasing deserve to be in a five and also devon but these three athletes
Alex Kurdecha: to know properly where they are, they need to pull, for example, with Vitaly, because they already pulled with Levan. And basically on this match,
Alex Kurdecha: I can say that I know and I think I don't hurt Dave because of his results. He's an amazing guy. He pulls with a lot of top guys. But based on that match, I can say that probably Vitaly is a little bit stronger. I can expect that Vitaly will be stronger versus match with Dave. So that's why I put Vitaly on the second place. On the third place,
Alex Kurdecha: Now it's a little bit more interesting to say who will be in the third place. Actually, I want to watch the match, for example, Devon versus some of our top guys. I know that he will be pulled with Levon and I know that he will prepare his fantastic shape. And probably in that day, we will see the answer.
Alex Kurdecha: But even if Levan wants versus Devon, even if Levan wants easily versus Devon, it will be not the answer where exactly Devon should be in the top of five. Because if Levan wants versus Devon, I'm not sure that Devon will win or will lose with Vitaly.
Alex Kurdecha: I respect Devon pretty much. He's a legend of our sport. But honestly, I don't know. So to be sure where he needs to be put on this top five, I want to watch this match, for example. For example, one of our top four guys versus top four guys of West. This is exactly what I'm doing, what you are doing. So this is amazing because this gives us answers.
Engin Terzi: So I will put Devon in top five, but I don't know his number three, number four, number five. Listen, listen. How is he going to be ranked behind Michael when he just like in a dominating way he won? You can say that some years ago he lost, but we need to take the recent, recent. I mean, it is only last, last end of May, you know. So it is like not possible to rank Devon behind Michael. So for sure it's not five, you know.
Alex Kurdecha: i mean i'm i'm put devon uh now in this moment upper than michael because he wants with michael he won now devon is a very good shape and i believe that he can probably will be in better shape even in better shape so that's why i put devon number three yeah that's what i agree yeah
Engin Terzi: So one is Levan. And then probably we go with Michael. Probably yes. Because Michael won with Dave. So that's why he's a little bit upper than Dave. Okay, now let me ask you. Until here, everything is clear. Do you think that, you know, Ermes has no chance versus Michael or Dave at all? Is how you are thinking?
Engin Terzi: don't think absolutely no i'm not absolutely not agree uh with you in this moment i think that hermes has a big chances versus dave and also versus michael i respect the guys i respect the guys so you are saying that hermes has chance or no chance i say that he has big chance so okay this is what i am saying you said you don't agree with me i didn't say that uh he doesn't have a chance i said are you saying because when you say rank top five
Engin Terzi: You mentioned Devon, Michael, and Dave. You never mentioned Ermes, so it sounded like top five should be this way. Because I don't finish. I don't finish. I say that, for example, for me, it's easy to put Levon on the first battalion, on the second. Okay, but other three names you didn't mention. You only mentioned Michael, Devon, and Dave. And when you even thought that Devon may be like
Alex Kurdecha: three or four or five so okay we decided it's three yeah yeah but when you when you didn't even mention hermes so it sounded like you know you see him out of top five but i will explain you why i just put these three to compare themselves between between themselves so so i don't i don't finish my five actually i say that for example the place is one two three it's clear for me i'm uh explain why but for example after
Alex Kurdecha: i don't say that for example hermes can't be i honestly i want to put for example after this three guys like uh levon vitale and devon after that i want to see the match for example between michael and ms now i put them actually equally in this moment i don't put some of them higher or lower i put them equally and i believe that it will be
Engin Terzi: The interesting mention also, I believe that they must have a chance, have chances and actually good chances. There is one super chat, soft wash signs. It's not Engin, it's my name is Engin. Thank you for super chat. I have food, I have water, I have shelter, everyone. Roger Cunningham at your tournament. I don't know who he is, but if he proves himself, yeah, maybe in the future we can do it. The same guy.
Engin Terzi: He never beat real Michael, Michael, monster Michael Trudeau in super pancake, super desperate, beats Devon. Okay, so this is, these are the, did I miss anything? Probably no.
Engin Terzi: yeah so you are saying that yeah Ermes is somewhere there Ermes has chance to uh top roll them and then how about Ermes versus Devon do you also see the same thing or you only see him versus Michael and uh Dave uh having chance guys you guys are saying that Engin doesn't read the comments as usual that that's not true guys every time I do live almost all of them I read okay and only times that I'm not reading everything is when I'm
Engin Terzi: doing live broadcasting with a guest so that is why i'm also asking the questions uh and then talking and not you know uh that that is why you know but when i'm alone i always answer the uh questions it's very hard because i would like to also ask him questions you know that that's why i'm here
Alex Kurdecha: Sorry, what were you saying about Devon versus... So, yeah, you asked me about Devon and Ermes, and my answer will be that for today, because I watched the match, for example, Ermes versus Gnabry, I watched the matches, Ermes versus Mad Mask, yeah, and I watched the matches, for example, Devon versus Mad Mask and also Devon versus Michael,
Alex Kurdecha: uh i i believe that it can be will be interesting match uh previously now okay now devon deserve
Alex Kurdecha: the place number three so he has like he is ranked a little bit higher yes because he proved that's why yeah he proved it doesn't mean that it can be like no chances for a mess i believe that he has chance but i want to watch this match because like now i can have some expectations in myself
Alex Kurdecha: but i don't have the answers uh and answers can be if i see because i believe that hermes can be even better shape than he now he is progressing he's progressing he is a young man like me we do the same we like progressing now so how old are you are you are you 30 i'm 29 but i mean bro like i mean that i'm a wrestler no no no you are you are still progressing for sure yeah that's not what i asked you know i was just curious about your radio
Alex Kurdecha: Yeah, I mean about that you are progressing and like year by year it can be better. And for example Devon, it's like a huge library of investment. He knows all the techniques, he's well prepared from all the sides. And I know that he can be a very tough opponent. He can be the guy
Alex Kurdecha: or even when you are stronger it can be not enough to win with devon that's why i say that devon is ranked higher but i believe that the mess can be better and when he prepared very well he can give very tough match for devon and probably he can even won but so to be sure i want to watch this match i want to watch
Engin Terzi: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I also agree. Yeah, but the things are getting so exciting there, you know, just in the super heavyweight, you know, yeah, everyone, you know, I was so afraid, like, like, two till two years ago, like, there was like, while contracted, while contracted, and then I was thinking that I think like, next, like one decade, we are not gonna see the best pulling each other.
Engin Terzi: and now after pandemic something has happened and now everyone is pulling everyone as long as the price is set enough we understand yeah this is how they deserve uh but yeah i think i think we're gonna see yeah i think we're gonna see more more and more guys uh
Engin Terzi: You guys are asking when you donate GoFundMe, I forgot to put the link here, and how you get how you will get your pay per view and how you will get your signature, you know, T-shirts from the athletes who are going to compete, you know, within the GoFundMe, where you send the money, I think you are going to get, not I think you are going to get a message for this, and then you're going to be given your
Engin Terzi: And then you will be asked your address. And then we are going to make sure that these T-shirts will be signed. And then we will send you to your address. Everything will be fine. Also, the pay-per-view directly from CoreSports is ready already. Today is the second day. A lot of people buying. It's good. I'm happy.
Engin Terzi: uh for beginning of course uh and yeah the the tournament is sorry alex i need to give them this information because yeah uh quickly i will give it and
Engin Terzi: uh the event we will we will make a list you know the matches so you will know uh estimated time of the uh beginning of each match and then we're gonna uh put you know as this you know which matches like first second third and then you will be following and the the it will be best of five so
Engin Terzi: some matches will finish in three rounds uh so and also there will not be breaks any breaks between the matches we will just start and finish as devon thank you devon for your support devon mentioned two days ago it will be like an arm wrestling festival you know you're gonna just sit and enjoy and yeah i think i think there will be some great matches and hopefully we will do more but next time when i do i will probably not do 16 17 matches i realize it's too much like i was
Engin Terzi: even told to stop at five uh but then i'm like oh okay maybe i said this much so people will like it and then oh maybe this much too and then maybe this much this much and it came to like 16 or 17 or something i know it is long but i will enjoy i hope you will enjoy too and so okay if we go back to the uh uh
Alex Kurdecha: what's happening in uh current do you realize that not so much of uh left and pull prudential lately i i said some super matches left time what do you think about cody merit versus morozov you ever heard of morozov of course yeah he is a friend of mine as also as cody we speak too much with cody because we have already planned our match uh it was planned like one year before it was postponed because of pandemia
Alex Kurdecha: and it was planned to organize it in Canada and after that also it was a plan to organize in Kazakhstan but later so now we will see the match before with Ertem Kozy knows like we speak a lot with him he's the ranked number one in the United States in the North America also ranking he's number one now
Alex Kurdecha: For Ertem, in Evolved, in X-Sports, he's ranked number six. And honestly, I don't believe that Ertem is also one of the future. He's already one of the stars. He is even more in the future. I believe he will be even more great than he is now. Honestly, I know that Ertem is a very tough opponent for Kobe in this moment.
Alex Kurdecha: For example, I don't wish this opponent to Cody. I wish some of our big guys, normal, medium, big guys. Maybe, of course, I want to pull with Cody. He knows also. Maybe even with me. Easier match for Cody. You are saying that Morozov is the heavy favorite. That's what you're saying. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. I say why? Because Morozov is hungry.
Alex Kurdecha: fast very strong very young and uh sometimes you don't know what to expect from this yeah but but don't don't you think that cody has some pluses as well like years of experience i know that he has some classes for example his matches on the vaf he is a world champion he's ranked number one not for the beautiful eyes i know that cody is very strong i know the guys who train with him
Engin Terzi: and near to him and searching caught his shape and reporting me how he is good and i know that he is very good yeah but surprisingly he is very very quick very fast for his weight yeah i mean yes ripped guy but he is incredibly fast for a super weight
Engin Terzi: yeah it's true i'm agree with you yeah and saptabi thank you saptabi for the uh super chat love your engine in my opinion hermes beats michael with ease but i also believe we need to see this match i don't know if hermes beats michael or not but uh i don't think that it would be easy match i don't think it will be it is very very hard to beat michael easy why white wolf when donating 100
Engin Terzi: Does it ask what size T-shirt? I mean, listen, he doesn't have to ask. You are the one, you know, you're going to say that I want this size to this address, you know, and you're going to give the information. Like like we will have we will stop doing this donation by the beginning of February or end of January.
Engin Terzi: then then we are gonna we will be already asking them we will be having all the sizes and then we will tell the guy to make this man of this size this man of that size and then and then i will bring to the event and i will ask the guys to sign if they say they can sign before the event i will make sure that they will sign after the event because some people don't like to uh
Engin Terzi: like if they ask me to sign like 100 t-shirts, I would say, sorry, I can do later. I wouldn't do before the event. That's how I am, but for some people, it never be a problem, you know, it depends, you know. Okay, if we go back to arm nesting, yep, a little bit more, Alex, while we have you here. So, Devon versus...
Engin Terzi: levan of course that is that is the like uh very important probably one of the most important matches in the history some people think levan is going to crush devon not so many but still there are some people that believe that it's six round super match somehow the one is going into the connection i don't hear you don't see you okay
Engin Terzi: Do you hear me or you're out, you will come in again? Probably you will, okay. I think he's... Yep, he wants to enter, yep. He's coming in a second, guys. While he's coming, I can show you my forearms, guys.
Engin Terzi: Oh, yeah. Beautiful, big, poor arm. I was telling you that, like some people, like most majority thinks that Devon is going to crash Devon. And some people, not the majority, but some people have faith in Devon. It's a six round super match. Somehow he's going to stop him, tire him and beat him. That's what some people believe. But no matter, no matter if Devon
Engin Terzi: would crush Devon or not. I mean, still, that is one of the most important matches in the history. The way that it looks, Levan is the favorite, but it's still, I mean, for me is very, very important. Evgeny if Levan crushes him,
Engin Terzi: or not as i said i would still think that it's worth to see either they want to stop in him somehow and then beating him by endurance or lebanese but that way or this way it doesn't matter you know that man is something to witness this is what i believe and this is very important leon
Engin Terzi: maybe the strongest super heavyweight ever, maybe not the strongest, probably one of the strongest, but when, when you see a super heavyweight moving at the stage, like a lightweight with that electric city, that, that, I mean, I mean, can you imagine that, you know, normally he's very humble guy, like very like a friendly guy. You would never think, but when he, he goes that stage, like, I mean, if I were in front of him, I would just say, okay, no, thank you. I don't want to, for sure. I mean, for me, of course I'm small, but still,
Engin Terzi: but i mean he doesn't he looks very dangerous there you know he he looks like he's just like not gonna arm muscle you're just gonna like tear you apart you know that is how he looks you know and so this guy that is why and his technical abilities his speed aggressiveness everything like look like looks like a lightweight guy in the
Engin Terzi: like 170 180 kilo guy buddy you understand that we did that so that that makes him so dangerous so and then when you look at the devon uh he has been the weather best for some years
Engin Terzi: uh in supers uh by just like judgment that you know john beat uh dennis and at the same time he beat john and you know i mean of course you know it's it's hard to uh say it wasn't even though he did not really meet uh the the eastern guys but so also devon you we all should you know accept that it is the
Engin Terzi: best ambassador of the sport of arm wrestling i see him as a window that is opening to the non-arm wrestling world you know from our community so and this guy is not only a strong guy he's also a very technical guy his table iq everything is like high level and to see and he's the probably the most famous arm master in the world in the history even um even though john is the god but it's
Engin Terzi: that's the same thing so to see these two two arm masters meeting each other is like for me the most one of them not the most but the one of the most important uh things in the armless in one of them so what do you think about this this matchup i will say uh shortly that absolutely i think that devon is the face of vault and wrestling
Alex Kurdecha: in the moment and also in the history and he's the strongest guy of West. I say that I know that I think even all Western guys will agree with me that now Devon is like a strongest guy of the West and for example Levan is our eastern part of the vote because like we don't pull
Alex Kurdecha: uh against uh west guys every day yeah and 11 for for my opinion yeah of course he's a favorite because i know perfectly level of level i know perfectly level of our eastern guys
Alex Kurdecha: And I will say that this match will be absolutely interesting without any predictions for result. It's absolutely interesting because it will be the answer of the level, West versus East. It's one. And also, oh, I don't see them hear me now or not. I mean, I hear you. Okay, I think you will be back.
Engin Terzi: connection is cut but soon very soon he will be back yeah it's very nice to chat with alex he's he's very intelligent guy and he knows how to express his thoughts very well and yeah we are lucky to have you alex
Alex Kurdecha: um okay yep you're back again yeah okay i've all finished the answer i don't know in which moment it was cutted so about uh devon and levan i say shortly now because of internet connection uh i believe that it will be historical match uh that like i said before devon is the face of bolton wrestling and this is guy who is a legend of amazing he is also like it's the strongest guy of the west
Alex Kurdecha: And like I said before, I believe that Levan is number one ranking overall. And Levan is a representative of the East World of Wrestling. So I think it will be a historical match. I don't see you hear me now. Okay, so you probably don't hear me now. I hear you, I hear you. But I don't know, people, do you guys hear Alex? Yeah.
Engin Terzi: Oh, you want to show the forearms again, okay, let me. I mean, sorry guys, I mean it's hard to put in the screen, just joking. Ooh, bicep cramps, the injured one. Yep, Alex is coming soon.
Engin Terzi: okay guys if the connection goes like this we will get the last word from uh alex and we will finish because looks like something is wrong with the connection every a few minutes this started to happen wild frames thank you for superior devon cannot stop levan with king's move i don't know what it is you mean desperation move
Engin Terzi: Because the rules not allow to do what he do against Dave match. So this will be pretty much like versus Dennis 60411. I am. I am down fan. Yep.
Alex Kurdecha: so what is this yeah yeah yeah yeah i think i think the connection is bad yeah sorry but it would it's great to have you here i can talk with you two hours but i hope it's not gonna you know get cut again you know yeah yeah so my answer was that uh i expect uh this match with like big inspections uh without i'm not care about results i'm really happy to just watch the match like i said before because
Alex Kurdecha: uh devon is a legend he's the strongest western guy and uh lebanon is number one of the world so it will be a huge show and huge answer what the level difference between west and this so that's my answer so you don't want to talk about the outcome is that because you don't want to upset anyone come on sorry about it but honestly no no no i'm not i i say it before that i i believe that lebanon is a favorite i believe it i know
Engin Terzi: that uh even devon probably uh agree with me i think he has planned oh what yeah you know alex you need you need to come back one more time yeah we better finish the uh by giving you the last word and can you tell me your favorite exercises for hand wrist like uh pull up on a flat surface i love it but your wrist is not gonna be like this it's gonna be like a straight position
Engin Terzi: Okay, guys, I'm going to give him the last word and then we are going to finish because it looks like his connection is not that good. So I will tell him and he's going to say his last words. Otherwise, because we are... I don't know what has happened. When I answer about this match, it cuts me. Yeah. I think every four minutes it's going to get cut again. So I think I don't know what to do.
Engin Terzi: guys do you all see the old I don't know you probably don't hear me now and I don't I hear you but probably you don't hear me do you guys hear me or what this happens with this internet probably now you hear me right no okay okay guys all the time now with you yeah but do you hear us
Engin Terzi: hmm yeah now you hear me now yeah i hear you i all time hear you even when you don't hear me i i still hear you but there's a separate set from wife to wolf alex how will you deal with monster michael todd's desperation move if it's open out topo is different but i don't say that name sorry about it
Alex Kurdecha: i wanna uh i wanna check guys uh my answer that i'm really interested to check how i will deal with the monster michael called uh king's move i really want to check it uh i never checked before i would never pull with michael and i respect uh michael different style i know that's absolutely different style of buff and wrestling but i want to check uh how how it is i have a question i have a question
Alex Kurdecha: like can you finish with a shoulder pressure have you tried you can okay then then your chances higher than if you remember if you remember some of my matches on the 2017 even when i was not like now i start with top roll and after that i'm finished with the triceps or side pressure sometimes even though in the flat yeah i i can i be honest with you
Engin Terzi: yeah i started to pay attention some after that that year after 2017 yeah not only 2017 but you know i don't pay so close attention to everyone but i start to pay close attention to you at that time you took my uh attention but the way that you were pulling like you know
Engin Terzi: know just like rising up and then that way i mean i i you i saw you very effective but i really didn't think that you could become one of the best only by pulling that way and and that is why you had experienced some losses against lighter guys yeah yeah because because you you took their hands you were successful but but you realize that it's not enough you need to really control the pronators
Engin Terzi: Cut the connection between hand and shoulder and press the guy's arm, you know, to the side way. Now you're doing this. Now you are going still, as you said, a little bit more to go. But for sure, you are on the right path for sure. Another super chat here. Super chat for my favorite arm, Mr. Engin Terzi. Thank you, Kevin.
Engin Terzi: Tom K, Tom K, sorry if I'm pronouncing. See, do you realize that after we stopped talking about Devon and... Oh no, again you're gone. Yep. You know what we should do? We should do that after you come back, maybe you say the last words, because I think maybe at that time,
Engin Terzi: hello guys hello to everyone and sorry to everyone when i do alone live i promise you that i will answer every respectful question but for today please uh yeah yeah i will get more guests i will try to get john brzing and uh hajim razolev and arsene lily will be there i will do some uh cody marcio and morozo probably
