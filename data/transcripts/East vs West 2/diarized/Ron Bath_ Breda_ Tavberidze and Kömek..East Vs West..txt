Jonathan Breda: Hello Jonathan, you hear me? Yeah, I hear you. You hear me, Mr. Engen? Yeah. Cool. See you. Cool. Let me see here. How do I make it to where I see everybody? Is it just me and you, Engen?
Engin Terzi: no i mean right now yes but i think soon they will join us okay oh you tell me when
Jonathan Breda: okay still we are waiting them to join does it seem like i have a good solid connection i mean yeah everything is fine yeah okay yeah yeah so you working today uh no sir i'm uh i'm at my gym that's it's got way better wi-fi than at my house so yeah
Engin Terzi: How is the preparation going? Very good. Very, very good. I feel very strong. Very, very strong. Someone else came. Let's see who that is. Yeah, come in and run back. Now we're waiting for Tavberidze. How are you? Hello. Hello, brother.
Ron Bath: Hey, guys. Hello, Ron. Good to see you. I got a little laryngitis going on this morning, so I hope I can keep my voice. But hello. How do you do, Ron? Hey, Jonathan, doing well. Good. Aside from not my voice going in and out today. Well, how can you catch a cold, though?
Ron Bath: I've been working out in the cold and the rain this last week and then I was up by Angie in the snow last week so. Probably maybe caught a little cold or something, but felt good yesterday. Wouldn't work out yesterday still, but late last night I started feeling. Hopefully it's nothing serious. I hope so. How are you doing again?
Engin Terzi: I am trying to heal my bicep. What's the sound coming from? Yeah. Yeah. Might be Ron's hearing aid malfunction. No, there's no hearing aids yet, buddy. I need them. I need them. Am I the only one that is hearing this? No, I hear it too, Ingen. I don't know where it's coming from. It's not coming from my head.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, not for me. Yeah, I'm just checking if Zurab is asking your other opponent run. Yep, from Georgia. Very, very, very strong guy. He's about he's about 5'8", my guess. Maybe 5'9". 5'9", maybe. Yeah. And what are you? What are you now? 6'2"? Used to be 6'3"? Who, me? Yeah.
Ron Bath: Ah, 6'2 and a half. Ah, yeah. Are you sure? I feel like you're a little bigger than that. I'd be 6'4 with my boots on. Oh, yeah, that's right. Okay, yeah, I forget you wear the boots. I was like, oh, 6'2 might be a little small. No, with bare feet, I'm about 6'2, so it's a little over. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. So your weight is still around, like, 112?
Ron Bath: Ah, somewhere's in there. I hope to keep it up. That's why I don't want to get sick or anything, because I want to keep my weight up. I got to get close to that 115 kilo for Efe. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Efe is, he can make up to 125 kilo, 275. But he needs to be, what, now 153 or something, yeah. Yeah, cool. Yeah. 115 kilos is what we agreed to. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, he is. I'm too old to pull those super heavyweights. Yeah, he pulled 242s at Buff. He pulled 242s and two days ago he was here. We trained pronator together. He was 115 kilos. Oh, okay. So he has no problem making that. So cool. Good. Yeah, he's right there. He's right there. Yeah. Only a month ago he was 108 kilos.
Engin Terzi: I don't know why. Anyways, we thought Zurab wouldn't be as good. I don't know why he didn't come, but he's probably scared. He's scared, right? He's probably scared.
Engin Terzi: yeah this is what i was guessing yeah georgians are not scared of anyone i've been scared i've been scaring him away with my uh lifts my story on facebook yeah um no he didn't send me any message either he has seen my message i don't know why probably doing his makeup okay let's start you know without him if he comes you know i will
Engin Terzi: know add him to the group yep you guys you guys said that uh a good left arm super match not not long ago it was very very tough one uh around you and yeah and yeah and now now you guys will be in the same side you know same team versus the eastern guys and when was the last time you competed uh overseas run it was
Engin Terzi: probably 2007 in England versus Devon. And before that, you won the WAF in Manchester, 2006. Yeah. And before that, 2004, Zloty Tour. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And then 99 Japan. I don't know if you have competed anything else overseas, but... No, not. I went to...
Ron Bath: Well, I went to the Goodwill Games in Russia. Oh, yeah. I remember that too. 1991 or something. I remember from the old unbender magazines. I remember reading them. Yeah. You're holding the American flags, you know, together. Yeah. On the ceremony. Yeah. I saw the picture. Yeah. Ben, I haven't been overseas a whole lot. I went to London twice for Worlds. And then I went to Japan twice. What were they for? It was two different events. I went to Japan twice. Oh, yeah?
Ron Bath: yeah so but it was uh oh shoot yeah because i've been in japan twice one was for the walk canada if you call canada i went there for a while so yeah you need to turn turn your uh sounds you know on it looks and also the the video if you hear us um anyway so
Engin Terzi: yeah if we if we if we go and start have you have you studied any of your opponents videos or you are just like i'm rambat where we come you know i'm ready it's hard enough they're both strong and i better work i got work cut off hello hello hello how are you yeah good good thank you thank you and you
Engin Terzi: Good, good. Yeah, you have translated with you, right? Yes. Nano has known Georgian, maybe except Bran, because he's from Georgia originally. It is the state of US, you know. Oh, Georgia.
Engin Terzi: yeah so in fact there will be you you are from georgia right ron did you move there you're born there no no no we have both of us we are from georgia no no no i'm talking about ron no no no i'm talking about but you are from the state of georgia originally yeah yeah so we we can't say that two georgians will pull each other you know but the american georgian versus
Engin Terzi: Yeah, sorry for cutting your run. And what were you saying about that studying your opponents? It's not enough to know that they're both beasts and animals and I better be ready. Yeah, yeah. How do you see your chances against these guys? And how travels affect me? I think they're pretty good.
Engin Terzi: I'm not coming. That's for sure. No money. So you come in here to, of course, win, right? I come. Yeah. And where do you expect the matches go? Grant, can you speak a little bit louder? I know you have a voice problem, but at this game, yeah. The only matches I have a tendency to lose are local ones where I go in with a I don't care attitude, like Wayne Withers.
Ron Bath: Yordan, they're good arm wrestlers, but I just, you know, Turkey with heavy attitude. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: yeah when you translate can you translate a little bit quieter sorry but i i really hardly hear him you know maybe after he talks yeah because at the same time if you don't mind we will if you don't mind we will set it on mute while i'm translating because yeah when you translate at the same time i don't understand what francis is saying so um so sorry i didn't hear you very well you know because of that but you know that your opponent from georgia is a good hook puller you know that right
Ron Bath: Yep. And then your opponent from, what's that? Am I still pulling Efe? What's that? Who am I pulling? Efe, right? Efe, yeah. Efe is a top roller. Yeah. Yes, I saw his hook pull. Yeah, very good. So I got to work a little bit more on my high hook or high top, get him stretched out like he's going to try to get me. We're both probably going to work for the same thing. It just matters who gets it.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, you're going to go outside, you are saying? I'm initially probably going to try. You're going to try, okay. I'm not afraid to go inside either. Okay, after first round, you're not going to try the same thing if you go top of first round? No, that's what I'm saying. A small tip for you. Now then, I guess we'll end up on the hook, everyone. Yeah, yeah, let's see. So I started to train FS Pronator, so I wouldn't suggest you go there either.
Engin Terzi: so you are going to say don't go don't go anywhere to go maybe maybe maybe side is better bam you set me up to get my ass whooped twice didn't you i mean yeah you're a legend you know so this is the best we have here you know around your weight class we have another one arif arif is the supreme weight champion so it's just uh yeah his left arm is injured his right arm is another level he's the supreme weight champion and then jonathan
Jonathan Breda: And you are saying that you're going to surprise me, right? Absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah. Uh, my, my training started at peak numbers. I'm in that four to five year mark where, um, starting to notice some pretty significant, uh, gains in, uh, certain aspects of my training and, uh, yeah, uh, IQ level is definitely went up over the last year, year and a half. Uh,
Jonathan Breda: Yeah, I have a lot of options left-handed. I'm not afraid to hook either. So it's been, you know, the last year, year and a half, it's, you know, I've had an elbow injury that I've been dealing with, and it's been hard to commit to a hook, but now my elbow is healthy. And, yeah, I'm not afraid to bang inside if I have to, for sure. When you say that if you have to, it sounds like, you know, if you can top roll him, you know.
Engin Terzi: Well, yeah, I mean, ideally, you know, it's a lot less wear and tear going that way. So, yeah, whatever gets me the win, that's what I'm going to do. Do you see this is like a very big opportunity to pull at that level of event against a world champion athlete? Like, do you see this like an opportunity to show how good you are?
Jonathan Breda: the absolutely uh yeah i uh i see this as an opportunity to you know open doors for uh further uh endeavors overseas uh for me yeah absolutely yeah caroline thank you for the super chat thinking your youtube streaming is getting too strong thank you thank you very much and yeah and then let's go back to your opening drop hello drop
Zurab Tavberidze: Last time we talked with you, you said you are 97 kilos. Now, are you about 100 kilos now? Yes, I am. I would like to say that it's been 10 years since the COVID-19 pandemic started. It's been 10 years since the pandemic started. It's been 10 years since the pandemic started. It's been 10 years since the pandemic started. It's been 10 years since the pandemic started.
Zurab Tavberidze: He just killed the coronavirus like 10 days ago. Like he started training like one week ago. He's 95, 96 at this moment and he's gonna go 200 kg like soon.
Zurab Tavberidze: He feels really good now, but the weight is like 95, 96 kg, and soon he's going to go like 200 kg. Yeah, he will be ready until that time, I understand. But I'm just thinking if he killed the corona, I'm just thinking what could he do to run and kill Jonathan? Can you please repeat it? No, it was just a joke. It was just a joke, you know, yeah.
Zurab Tavberidze: Yeah, and Zurab, do you know your opponents? Do you know Rambat and Jonathan? Your opponents, yes. Yes, I know them. I've known them for a long time. I know them all. I know them all. I know them all. I know them all. I know them all. I know them all. I know them all.
Zurab Tavberidze: He said that he knows about Jonathan. He saw all his matches and he wants his legends. He said that he doesn't know about his shape right now, right this moment. But he said he thinks if he's in good shape right now, it's not going to be that easy. But he will try his best. Is he talking about Rambats?
Zurab Tavberidze: About Jonathan, he just saw some videos about him and he thinks he has a strong left arm.
Engin Terzi: He will try his best like you see. Yeah, yeah. Whenever he says he's going to try his best and we will see. But whenever he wanted me to set a match for him, he said he was ready. He told me, I want a very strong opponent. This is what he told me. So I'm sure that, you know, he really believes in himself, you know.
Zurab Tavberidze: But I have to say that it was very hard for me to win, but it was very hard for me to win, and now it's my turn to win. Yes, now it's your turn to win, it's a competition.
Zurab Tavberidze: He needs a strong opponent every time, every single moment. Because with weak opponents, he's not that motivated. It's great to be with a great opponent. He's ready. Thank you. Epe, what do you think about Ran? How do you see your chances?
Efe Kömek: he says that he says that uh
Engin Terzi: uh he knows you and he respects you and he thinks it's a good match and you're a legend but he says that if if you are planning to uh top roll him he said that he he would like to let you know that it would be a mistake you know but he said that yeah in in like in in advance that so like yeah this is what he said but he's at least he's very honest or maybe he's just playing mind games maybe his his weak spot is his hand you know
Ron Bath: i know i've watched videos i know how strong his hand is but uh i i get to jump get in early and if i have to go to the hook we'll go to the hook yeah yes we'll definitely have to see who the stronger man is yeah i i you have you have a lot of many options right you have many options nope there's there's not a whole lot of options in arm wrestling we got somebody with a strong hand and wrist
Engin Terzi: but you can try you know just because someone is strong it doesn't mean that the hand will never get toppled or something very true yeah yeah so in anything anything there has been you know you have been in this for probably minimum 40 years and I'm sure that I mean you have seen many many arms hands that you you were thinking that you know like maybe near to unbeatable you know but but then you eventually see that it happens yeah
Engin Terzi: yeah arm wrestling is not all about strength all the time it's about angles and everything else so it depends who's going to have the best thing that day so yeah yeah ron i have a i have a question for you did you did you watch the did you watch the chat with the travis bashing that i had i i started watching something then i got busy and i had to pull off i want to go back and watch it though yeah yeah yeah he said that he beat you about like you know first he said
Engin Terzi: 1,400 times or something, and then he said, like, he said, like, about probably 35 to 3 or 4, like, but I don't think that the difference was that much. I don't think so. That was closer than that. I remember even before you guys go to 2004 Zloty, remember? Where he pulled with Alexey Voivoda. I think three weeks ago, you beat both Travis and John. Remember that? Travis's turn? Yes.
Engin Terzi: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It was right before. Yeah. They pulled each other in the slow to supers while we were in 95 kg. Yeah. Yeah. I'd be John. I'd be Mike Gould, Todd Hutchings. I beat them all at that tournament. In the same tournament, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's why I said the tournament's going down, depending on my attitude. So if I'm ready, if he's in for a war. Yeah. You know, when you beat him,
Engin Terzi: It was a year after he beat Alexey Voevoda, and then he won the World Superweight title, Travis. You beat him a year later, only three weeks before the Zloty Tour. I remember that, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So he just wanted to prove his point that, you know, Devin wasn't that strong around that time. But I kind of disagree with you. When you pull with Devin in 2007,
Ron Bath: Devon was like for sure at the world level, right? Like one of the best. Devon's always out beating me. Devon's always been on top of his game for me because he studied me real well. First time I pulled Devon, I took him too easy in my training. I just thought, and then I didn't watch him much. Second time, I don't know what I would have did different. He still would have beat me when we pulled in London. He was just, and that's the same year he beat Travis and John. So Devon was on a different level that year.
Engin Terzi: yeah yeah i agree i agree because because because trevor said that you know devon is only now like he said two years ago when we did maybe one and a half years ago when we did the interview around this time he became one of the best he says but even then he was probably one of the best in the world for sure definitely yeah yeah i agree with you yeah anyway so so uh did you did you have any chance to did you have any chance to look at the the east versus west card
Engin Terzi: Just briefly, there's going to be some good matches. Unfortunately, I don't do my homework all the time. But it'll be interesting. Do you think that West is going to win more than East wins in this card? I'm from the East or from the West, so I got to say West is going to win. Yeah. But do you follow the guys from overseas?
Ron Bath: I'll be honest with you, Engin, I don't follow a whole lot of arm wrestling when it comes to, because my days are usually so busy. I watch what comes up on YouTube or something. But yeah, I don't know if I've watched more of Epi and Yuri the last week or so, and it's still not enough. I want to watch more over the next couple of weeks. And do you know who Zoloev is? Yeah. The guy that just recently defeated Tatashins over here.
Engin Terzi: and yeah he's gonna pull with john i know john is your very very all-time friend and yeah and you you will probably favor him but uh do you think that you know it is like that in reality or
Ron Bath: talking me i think i think in reality you got to look at the age different john being off just like myself we give up a little bit with the age uh we can still have the heart but the age zoloft probably has the upper edge but when you come to john brzenk you don't call it no yeah yeah yeah in my opinion john is gonna win my opinion yeah but but let's see let's see how it will be and and other matches you don't know you don't know the other guys right like you know gennady
Ron Bath: Yeah, I watched Genadi's last match and I pulled with Mike a couple of weeks ago and I got to go with Michael Todd, big. Michael Todd was much stronger than last time you trained with him? Yeah, a lot stronger. He's changed his training methods up. Okay, okay, yeah. I won't go into those, but he's changed up some stuff in his training and his workouts and his wrists are just...
Ron Bath: I wasn't 100% when I went over to him because I trained Jim just recently with deadlifts and stuff. But at the time, his hand and wrist were just so freaking solid. I don't see Mike losing. I understand. Yeah, I understand. And Jonathan, do you follow the other guys that are not your opponents? Yes, sir. Yeah, I follow pretty much everyone.
Jonathan Breda: except for a few of the women's matches. And what are your opinions about these matches? I think the West has a lot better opportunity this go around than the last. Yeah, I mean, Genadi, you know, he used to be able to transition to that press fairly well back in the earlier years.
Jonathan Breda: the fact that he wasn't able to do that, or I don't know if he was, he was hurt or what, but the fact that he couldn't do that against Ermes, I mean, I think stylistically, Michael's a bad matchup for him. I think Michael takes that same way with Zoloev, uh, you know, yeah, he top rolled Todd fairly, uh, I wouldn't say easy, but I mean, he definitely found his lane against Todd. Uh, I don't think he'll be able to take that lane against John, uh,
Jonathan Breda: Evgeny if John's wrist does go back, I don't see him pulling in that lane against John. So unless Zoloev tries to hook him, I mean, that's the only way I see Zoloev coming on top against John. Other than that, let's see, what was the other big one? There is Tatachins versus Yordan Tsonev. So that's the only guy I'm not very familiar with. I haven't done my homework with him.
Engin Terzi: But, yeah, I mean, is he an inside bowler? Yes, yes. Yeah. Oh, well, then there you go. I don't see, you know, the chances of going inside with Todd. I doubt, I mean, I'd be very surprised. Yeah, me too. But, you know, we, it's life, you know, we always learn something new, you know. Oh, yeah, for sure. And Ermes versus Arif, do you know them? You know Ermes? Yeah. I don't know Arif, right? That is, is that a left-hand match? Right. Right-hand?
Jonathan Breda: um how do you get the current current super away champion on the wolf yeah rf is uh yeah he's definitely been impressive over the last few years uh stylistically though i don't know what hermes did i mean like i said it's really just a question of to me what what shape was gannati in when they pulled i mean you got to think too hermes just came off
Jonathan Breda: uh a loss from credential when he pulled him very shortly before that he still made it look like very easily easy against canadi in my opinion so i think it'll be yeah who can get on top first who have the stronger top knuckle really uh there i can't really pick that's 50 50 for me and then when you look at the card you you believe that west is gonna win more matches than east
Jonathan Breda: I think West will definitely give a better fight than the last card. Let's put it that way. Whether or not, you know, I mean, the last card was just pretty much a blowout on the West end. They got blown out. So I think it'll be a lot closer. If not, I think I could see West coming out a few more wins.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, this is like the mindset that you have to have, no matter what. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You can't go any competition by thinking that you and your team is going to lose. Of course, you are more responsible about your own self. And there is a super chat. Thank you, Jonathan. And this super chat is soft wash science. Do you want the flex run? Say what? To run back the bicep. I think they want to see.
Engin Terzi: yep still rock solid yeah yeah i i see i see fear in ephes eyes and zurab's eyes as well i'll be ready yeah and he said he's asking you are you excited to represent the east again probably he meant to say west and we're getting the band back together
Ron Bath: And so are you excited to represent the West again, Ron? Oh, it's yeah, it definitely is. It's fun to have been invited to this. Yeah, it's got me fired up and motivated. I was 20 years younger, especially able to do it with Angie. Angie's got a match and I got a match. This would be the first time we had a Superman in the same place. I will say Angie being with him definitely makes a difference. I mean, when,
Jonathan Breda: when me and Ron were about to pull last year, I mean, when I walked up to the table, I'd never seen Ron that big before. I mean, he looked like he was definitely training. So I'm not surprised. If he's in that shape, he'll be ready to go. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I will have, hopefully if they also accept, I will have a YouTube show with the ladies as well, you know. Cool. Yes, yes. And Efe,
Engin Terzi: What do you think about the matches? Who is the winner? For example, let me say it one by one, without analysis. John Zoloev. Zoloev. Zoloev. Yes. Arif Ermes. Arif, if you speak a little slower. Arif. Arif. Tata Cins, Tsonev. It's very difficult. Don't look at it like East vs West. Yes, yes.
Engin Terzi: Murat Kizildag? Yes, Murat Kizildag. And Genadi Michael? Yes, Genadi Michael. And Rambet Efe? Of course, Rambet Efe. I'm going to cancel that match after this answer. I need to find a stronger opponent. If you think that Rani is going to win,
Ron Bath: He's trying to lighten my attitude up, but I'm coming to kick. I watched him pull. He's trying to look, you know, friendly to you. Oh, yeah. Yeah. But he won't be able to soften you, right? You are too experienced. No. Angie won't let me get softened. She'll be yelling at me too hard, and I got to win her.
Engin Terzi: That sound started coming again. Oleg versus Betkili. Oleg Zhokh. Oleg Zhokh. Oleg? Yeah. And other than that, Yusuf Cherkasov.
Engin Terzi: i know yusuf so yusuf okay okay what are your opinions about these upcoming matches between between east and west like but just don't take it like you know east versus west just say your hundred percent honest opinion versus john
Zurab Tavberidze: What do you think will happen in the future? What do you think will happen in the future? What do you think will happen in the future? What do you think will happen in the future? What do you think will happen in the future?
Zurab Tavberidze: Because if the maximum form of the body is used, I think that not all men will be able to do it. Therefore, the problem is not with the body, but with the body. If the body is in this form, I think that men will be able to do a lot of things and will be able to do it.
Zurab Tavberidze: um about john and zara's matches like to say truly he thinks that it's hard to say they uh what are we who gonna win because he doesn't know the shape of the john but he said that if john is in a good shape right now like in his maximum he can like win not only zalo like he can beat like most like everyone who's gonna meet on his way if he's the only he's coming he's in good shape so if john is in good shape john is gonna win yeah
Zurab Tavberidze: And Michael versus Genadi? Michael versus Genadi. He thinks like 50-50.
Zurab Tavberidze: goes to 50-50 with Michael and Genadi. Michael is, for Genadi, he's like kind of uncomfortable opponent, so that's why things like goes to 50-50. And what does he think about this another Georgian, Oleg Dzok versus Betkili?
Zurab Tavberidze: That's interesting. That's interesting, yeah.
Zurab Tavberidze: Yeah, other than that, uh, uh, touching sources, you're done sooner. Yeah. He thinks that Yordan sauna is going to win. Wow. That's interesting. Yes. Yeah. And this is a drop versus Rambat who wins. Um,
Zurab Tavberidze: He hopes that he's going to win, but he respects his opponent very much and he wants to make him hear that he will give 50-50.
Zurab Tavberidze: Yeah, because he respects you. That's only because he respects you. What they got to do is give me so much respect. They got to give me a split second hit first. But I will remind you that don't change your mind later.
Zurab Tavberidze: And how about you versus Jonathan Breda? You will still say 50-50? What do you think? Is it going to be 50-50? In fact, I think it's going to be 50-50. I don't know what Jonathan's plans are. I don't think it's going to be 50-50. I think it's going to be 50-50. I don't know what Jonathan's plans are. I don't know what Jonathan's plans are. I don't know what Jonathan's plans are. I don't know what Jonathan's plans are. I don't know what Jonathan's plans are. I don't know what Jonathan's plans are. I don't know what Jonathan's plans are. I don't know what Jonathan's plans are. I don't know what Jonathan's plans are. I don't know what Jonathan's plans are. I don't know what Jonathan's plans are. I don't know what Jonathan's plans are. I don't know what Jonathan's plans are. I don't know what Jonathan's plans are. I don't know
Engin Terzi: he said that he haven't seen like many videos about jonathan but he said that he's the world champion of the about the left one so he's not gonna lose he's gonna win oh yeah that's good that's the attitude you know don't be like so nice you know yeah i respect you and this of course for run i understand running the next exception you know he's a legend but for jonathan of course you're gonna say that you're gonna win yeah
Jonathan Breda: Did you hear that, Jonathan? Yeah, I heard that he's world champion. But from what I remember, it's 85 kilos, not 102 kilos or whatever we're calling that. You hear this, Rob? Yeah. You are 85-kilo world champion, not the 100-kilo world champion. So, yeah. Any comment, Rob?
Zurab Tavberidze: he doesn't hear actually he was laughing he doesn't hear what jonathan said so yeah i i think i i know what he's thinking he's thinking that to be with jonathan he doesn't have to be 100 world champion oh i'm still in the pot
Zurab Tavberidze: He said that, huh? There is no blight. He said that I can even lose like 5kg and win Jonathan like this. Jonathan, you heard it, right? Oh, I heard it. Yeah. Wow. He's not going to prove it. He's not going to prove it. He said I'm giving kind of motivation to Jonathan. Yeah. Yeah.
Engin Terzi: Make sure you weigh that 102, 103 kilos, so that way there's no excuses when I weigh. Yeah. The only reason he's not going to lose 5 kilos to beat you, Jonathan, is because he doesn't want to get weak versus run. Not because of you. I get it. I got a big one today. I got a big one.
Engin Terzi: Jonathan, just don't get me wrong. I'm just trying to steer the pot for that day, you know. No, I'm all about steering the pot. Yeah, yeah. Just go and prove this guy that his 85 kilo world title doesn't mean anything for the 100 kg. Yeah. Yeah. Make sure he brings his riser and, you know, does whatever he can to make sure he's ready. Yep.
Engin Terzi: thank you for the super chat i want to see as much as confidence from these guys as dixon glory
Engin Terzi: the goat head against... Well, this guy knows armwrestling. He is talking about for many years ago, like more than 10 years ago. He's telling us. Can you ask him again? How long has Zurab been pulling? Zurab, how long have you been pulling? How long have you been what? Armwrestling for how many years? I'm going to tell you, let's watch it.
Engin Terzi: 10 years. And Jonathan, you? I'm right at that four and a half mark. Yeah, I understand. Anyway, so it will be a great competition, what I believe. And I want to say my opinion, EFE versus RAN, I don't see RAN toppling EFE. It's not that easy to hook EFE, but there is some possibility.
Engin Terzi: But with the side weight, with the flat wrist, maybe even the little bit dead wrist, shoulder pressure or side, you know, Ron has chance. But if he goes to the hand battle versus FN, it's not that easy, but I never know. It's Ron Betts. Bring what I got, buddy. Yep, yep. 42 years of experience. We'll see if we can do it. Yep. I've been around for longer, and those guys have all been alive. Yes, that's true. That's true.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, you probably more than 40 years. How old were you? 16, 17? 18 when I went to the first tournament. So 40. I turned 60. I turned 60 three days after your tournament. Wow. Can you imagine that? 60 years old man and he's going to come and kick your ass. Yeah. Yeah, that's the bad part. You know, they would, hey, Zurab,
Zurab Tavberidze: How will you feel if you lose to Rambet, who is 60 years old? Do you think your teammates will make fun with you if you lose? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
Zurab Tavberidze: I am very happy to be part of this event. I am very happy to be part of this event. I am very happy to be part of this event. I am very happy to be part of this event.
Zurab Tavberidze: He said that this sport many times showed us that age doesn't matter, but if you are the same weight with the opponent and you are a little bit younger, you don't have to lose. So he said, I'm not even thinking about losing, so I'm going to win.
Zurab Tavberidze: I mean, if we are still alive, I would like to see how good Zurab will be doing if the age doesn't matter when he's 60 years old. If I will be not in a better shape than Rombadis, I will not be in the worst shape, he said.
Engin Terzi: okay so and if there is no much question i don't want to take a lot of your time and i've seen rambeth at last wall event yeah yeah that's interesting how old were you when you beat matt mask last time
Engin Terzi: Six years it was. 55, 54. Yeah, 54, 55 years old, and you were beating Matt Mask, who was considered like one of the best, yeah. I'm bringing that same attitude. Oh, yeah? I mean, if you are coming in such shape, then these guys are in trouble. Serious trouble. I'm sure that you wouldn't come here to lose. I mean, if you're coming, you have like so much knowledge and experience.
Engin Terzi: to know what to do and win. That's what I'm thinking. I'm starting to think that if you're coming with a similar shape that you were there, then I think these guys are in trouble. We're pretty close to that. Did you hear that, Efe? Metmeski beat me five or six years ago. He said he'd be very close to my defeat. You're in serious trouble. No, he can be as close as he wants. Don't turn it around.
Engin Terzi: it doesn't matter you know how good shape you are and he told me to not to translate but i said i'm here to steer the plot you know i'm i'm not armless ringing here i'm i'm the promoter in here so i will steal the pot as much as possible you know you'll have to go home with a tear as i get beat by a 60 year old
Engin Terzi: He's doing his best. He's training like crazy. Only two days ago, I trained him only for like three hours. So you won't be able to hook him. His hand is already solid. Just think about it. Well, we just gave him the win. That wouldn't be no fun. We're going to meet at the table and we'll see who's our number one at the end. Yeah, I think that's going to be the thing.
Engin Terzi: Yeah, yeah. These guys are young, but nowhere near as knowledgeable and experienced as you are. Oh, I've seen. They're pretty damn strong. So I'll have to pull something out of my hat. Yeah, but your genetic is incredible. You know, I think even at this age, maybe you are not in your prime, but still even at this age, I think you are rock solid. I can imagine that. And Jonathan, you have, what did you say, Ron? Sorry.
Engin Terzi: I intend to play every bit of it. See, this is the left. I didn't get to work out today, so I was going to put a big pump on it before I show up here. Just don't scare the guys. They're already scared. If you just go and train and come back, they will be too scared. They will just find an excuse that they hurt themselves. They will ask me to cancel the match. Don't scare them. If they hurt me, I'm going to hit them with my walker.
Engin Terzi: Jonathan, you have any last word before we finish for Zurab? After all, he said that he can even lose five kilos to beat you. I know you said it, but do you want to add something more? Train very hard. Work with Levan as much as you can. My left arm will be ready. Yeah. And you will beat him, right, Jonathan? Oh, yes. Absolutely. Yeah. That's right. That's great.
Ron Bath: Here's where I'm going, down here, right to that table right there with all my straps. Yeah, after this, you will go and train? Oh, yeah. Yeah, and this is without the gym. I just pull from different angles. I'll be there for an hour or so, and then I'm going to the gym later. And how often do you do table training? How often do you do it?
Ron Bath: well usually i didn't do much at all but over the last couple of weeks i do it every day for a while just something like light every once in a while i'll go heavy but most time it's just for recovery and working on positions i understand you yeah muscle memory is important for everything yeah and the health health yeah you need to be 100 healthy to push your limits yeah yeah yeah yeah
Engin Terzi: What's that? My health is pretty good, except for this laryngitis shit. Yeah, it will be fine. That one will be fine. No, I will. Yeah. And one last question, Ahmed Burak Atinj. Thank you for . What are your thoughts for Engin versus John on March? Efe, we are believing in you and appreciate the Turkish hospitality that you are showing for Ron. See?
Engin Terzi: So you're showing this to Anna? Yes.
Engin Terzi: He's not going to show you any hospitality, Turkish hospitality at the table. But after he beats you, he will show you. I don't want hospitality before we all fall. Yeah. And Zurab, what are your last words before we finish this?
Zurab Tavberidze: chat can you repeat it please yeah what are his last words before we finish you know is is there anything he would like to say
Zurab Tavberidze: he wants to tell his opponent like he kind of wished to all of you to get in like your best shape and come in your best shape and let's show the people like the best matches like what we can do okay okay
Efe Kömek: I hope it comes to me like it did in the old days. Can you hear me? Can you hear me? I hope it comes to me like it did in the old days. I understand. I'm ready. Our respect is endless but I hope it comes to me like it did in the old days. It will come in the best form. Otherwise, it won't be worth it to travel so much. Of course, brother, 10,000 kilometers is a short distance. It will turn around and around.
Engin Terzi: he says that he has utmost respect for you uh but he really hopes that you know you will be coming here as your you know like past good shapes otherwise you know uh it will not be worth to travel all the way you know thousands of kilometers and then just get upset and go back you know i'll be in the street bike and possibly get there yep yep anyways
Engin Terzi: And before we close, you want to add anything, Ron? Be ready. Let's have a good show. Let's put up a good fight. Yeah, it will be. It will be. It will be a great one. Yeah, I just can't wait, you know, just to hear the goal. And then East versus West. Because for many years, people are always like, there are like two worlds. One in North America, one is here. And everyone is talking. And the fans are divided, you know. We are the best. We are the best, you know. I mean...
Engin Terzi: At the end, we all are part of mankind. But it's good to have athletic competition. Because it's in the human nature. Instead of war, these kind of competitions, and then we arm wrestle. It's finished. We hug each other. We, I don't know, sit and eat and drink and have conversation as a family. We go home. We meet again. This is how the life is. So this is all my intention, just to unite
Engin Terzi: arm wrestling world together. Anyway, so I would like to thank you very much, especially to you, Ran. You're a legend. You are one of the inspiration for the all arm wrestling world that, you know, especially from our time. The new generation still knows you, but our generation knows who you are, even much better than people today. And you can come here, be our guest. We thank you together. This is an honor for us.
Engin Terzi: yeah thank you yeah i thank you i thank you and hope to see you in a month okay my friend yeah yeah you take care you also take care of my friends neighbors and see you in one month
Engin Terzi: don't show your arm you know ron is there waiting for any second to just show yeah if you just show one arm ron is gonna show oh look at this just do one more time just do that one more time that's fine that's fine he's short short arms always
Engin Terzi: short arm with a small hand right it doesn't mean much yeah am i wrong or do i a little bit see some fear in your eyes
Ron Bath: what's that again i gave up fear i don't fear either one of those guys yeah yeah yeah as you said i've beaten you you have seen it's the best what i can tell you is when i pulled michael todd in las vegas i looked at mike for damn you're looking pretty big but i've beaten guys way bigger than you beat him you have been
Engin Terzi: Who did you beat? You beat Taras, you beat John, you beat Devon, you beat Travis, you beat Michael Todd, you beat Marcio, you beat Todd Hutchings. You have won against all of them, right? They've all pretty much beat me, but when 47 years, you have your ups and downs. But on my best days, I beat every one of those guys. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. I think you are the one who has defeated John.
Engin Terzi: uh around his weight class the most this is what i calculated yeah yeah you have the most wins but i'm talking about the prime john in prime time or john you had of course he beat you three times you beat him once but still you have i think near 10 wins again this is what i remember from that time yeah he beat me way more but i've beaten john more in his prime than i think anybody else yeah yeah and and you know usually in john's prime
Engin Terzi: john was defeated only by the superhero weights not not not people around his weight but you were the one around his weight has defeated him multiple times this is what i remember yeah five weeks yeah five weeks and show us show us you will be big on it see you on the stage
Engin Terzi: The legendary rambats. Yeah. Yeah. I respect all of those guys that inspired me, you know, like you, like Cobra, like John, all those guys before my time that I grew up by watching you guys reading about you guys, you know, it was, it was, yeah. So it's for me, it's something, uh, very, even emotional, you know, because I was a beginner and you guys were the ones that I watch and grew up and,
Engin Terzi: maybe finally, maybe I became one of you guys. Thank you, thank you, great to hear. And I thank all of you for being my guests and hopefully you will be my guests one month later and let's do a great show and let the better ones
