SPEAKER_04: Got it. Hello, Engin. Hello, hello, hello. Good to see you. So, how are you guys? Legends? Wow. Very good. How are you? Good, good, good. Great to see you guys. Nice to see you. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And we're waiting for Yannis, and after Yannis comes, we can start. I'm not feeling so good lately. I'm exhausted because of organizing the events. It's kind of... Today, I was almost going to cancel, but because I told everyone I'm going to do, and then I didn't want anyone to upset with me, including you guys, so I had to do it. So, Arsene, do you
SPEAKER_00: train at all not for armwrestling but for anything else like general training nothing nothing about seven years i think he said that the last time he trained it was before the european championship in poland 2013.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah. Come on, Arsene, you can speak English. I'm not sure that I can speak with you. We understand you. We understand you. Every day you and I, from WhatsApp, we write to each other. I'm sure that you can also speak with us. So I can understand, but it's difficult for me to speak. And what are you doing now?
SPEAKER_01: I'm on the kitchen. No, you speak in English now. Ah, yeah. Thank you. So it is. And yep. Yeah, Krasimir Arshin was going to come here and ref, but at the last moment he is not available, so he's not coming. Unfortunately, it would be great to see him again. Yeah, yes.
SPEAKER_03: If you guys speak Russian, the others on the chat, live chat, they will not understand you. If I'm going in Turkey, and I said I'm not vaccinated, and this is one of the reasons that...
SPEAKER_01: probably will not go why you need to be vaccinated i'm i'm not sure actually do i need to be to get in turkey no no only only only pcr test that's it during the pandemic you came here remember last march yes yes yeah i mean there's there's nothing right there i i don't think so i never heard it
SPEAKER_00: A negative PCR test is enough to come here. Are you vaccinated, guys? Am I vaccinated? Yes. No. Arsene, you? We were very sick now. Two months ago, the whole family was sick. My wife was in the hospital, my mom was in the hospital. It was a nightmare. Now, thank God, everything is fine.
SPEAKER_01: I got three, four months ago. I also, it was not so light for me. I lost eight kilos in 10 days. Yanis, you look sideways. I mean. Yeah. A little bit more. Yeah. Yeah. Good, good, good. Yeah. Good to see you. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah. So we are looking for an opponent for Yanis, but so far we announced nobody is asking to pull Yanis. Everyone afraid, yeah, you know. Anyway, so we can start. We can start talking about the event if you guys are ready. And I would like to start from Krasimir. Krasimir.
SPEAKER_03: What is your favorite super match in the card? Either East versus West or doesn't matter. You know, some of the matches are not East versus West. And like, do you remember the matches? Yes, yes. Of course, the favorite one is Todd Hutchings and Yordan Tsonev, my friend, Dancho. So this is the match that I really want and can't wait to see. And after that, it's maybe Barbosa versus Morozov.
SPEAKER_01: hmm this too much yeah you know uh last time uh morozov came here he was 120 kilo one and a half year ago this time you know when we had a uh chat with him a week ago or something he said he is now 129 kilo and he yeah he's growing his biggest yeah while barboza will probably be maximum under 10 kilo maybe a little bit more but
SPEAKER_03: But Barbosa is a lot more well-rounded guy. Yes, true. If he can apply his power, yeah. I'm curious the other's opinion about their favorite match. Yeah, yeah. Yanis, what's your favorite one? You know, I'm lightweight, so it's Cherkasov and Yusuf.
SPEAKER_01: yeah yeah you know people are like thinking it's a mismatch do you think it's a mismatch or do you think no no no no is is there a weight limit is it a weight limit for that match 72.
SPEAKER_02: No, Yusuf. Last time in Istanbul in the top eight, Yusuf and Boşdar first round. And Yusuf won the first fight against Boşdar. Yusuf is more than powerful and capable to win inside game against same weight armwrestlers. I believe almost against every same weight armwrestlers.
SPEAKER_02: yeah yeah yeah maybe not sure about uh of course the oleg oleg is probably more uh versatile and he can go inside go go top roll i don't know about you if he can do something else or he can go just inside but but his inside strength is a top level yeah his pronator numbers when he trains is almost as good as mine
SPEAKER_01: but you know, when you have your numbers with the weights and the application at the table are not the same thing, you know, so he's good. He's good. Like, like we had a training some days ago, I and Arif we trained and then Arif get a little bit tired and then yeah, Yusuf was effective, you know, but you know, after we were kind of exhausted because Yusuf trained day before and he didn't, he didn't train with us. So we train Arif and I, and then yeah,
SPEAKER_01: There is a question from Caroline. Thank you for the super chat. Yannis, the Jedi, the most feared arm-master of all time. Yeah, they're asking if you are the most feared of all time. I mean, come on, who would be the most feared arm-master of all time, if you think? I mean, during our time, probably, well, Rustem Babaya, probably.
SPEAKER_01: yeah very possible yeah yeah many people you know whenever you look at rooster's weight class usually people that the weight class wasn't that strong because usually people were going either one below and one above similarly with all these uh oleg jock right yeah some some years yeah it's similarly no one no one goes in same class where oleg is
SPEAKER_00: yeah yeah yeah and and arson do you do you know yusuf anything about yusuf or no translation
SPEAKER_00: Engin asks, do you know Yusuf? Yes, I do. I don't really know his fight, because it's hard for me to talk about those athletes who have already become stars and champions after I finished. It's easier for me to talk, I understand more about those athletes who fought with me and will fight now.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, Arsene much more knows about athletes which were active in a time when he was pulling. Of course, he knows Yusuf, but not so good to give some specific thoughts about him. Ten, who is your favorite match now, next month, Arsene? I don't know, I didn't hide it. For me, the most interesting match is Genadi Kvikvinia and Michael Todd.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know, for me it's the most interesting. You see, everyone has their favorites. Well, yes. There are so many good fights, it's even hard to choose one.
SPEAKER_02: There are so many great fights, it's impossible to choose one best. You ask which is favorite, all are great, you know. And we will see probably that some of fights which we are not thinking are best ones probably will be best and could be opposite. And Gin, what will be the format? Best of five? Best of five, yeah. The one who comes to three is finishing. Three-zero is finished. Yeah, because we have so many matches.
SPEAKER_01: Kardeşim saygılar. We don't want it to be very long, you understand? We hope that some of the matches, you know, will be shorter. So, you know, it will not be like last time. Last time there was also TV here and TV was just also recording. So this time no TV, only for core sports. And then there will be no breaks between the matches and we will already make a, you know,
SPEAKER_01: uh list you know which match is the first which one is the second and then we will hopefully go very quick you know how how many hours do you think it will go about four four hours yeah i i bet it will be at least six no no no no don't scare people
SPEAKER_01: this is the truth it matches i mean it is their choice you know like they will just say okay i i want to for sure watch these matches they can just you know watch those matches if they have time they can watch all of them you know i mean if you don't come here to watch are you not gonna watch from uh where you are probably i will watch
SPEAKER_03: yeah yeah yeah the last uh ink of the table in dubai i paid just to watch uh johnny and devon so only for the right only for that yeah
SPEAKER_02: When you are asking a question, just tell us what you asked first. I asked, how is Haji and how is his elbow after the World Championship?
SPEAKER_00: It's not bad. He started doing some warm-ups. Of course, he's not in good shape yet, but he has this month. But the most interesting thing is that no one among the four of us named the most interesting fighter, like John Brzee and Haji Murad Zola. This is scary and interesting. And what do you think, is it not so that he has more... If you need...
SPEAKER_02: Think more about rehabilitation than about training. It's not a big problem. In any case, in any case, I think it will happen. Well, what to do?
SPEAKER_02: Arsene said it's really funny that no one of us said that Haji Murat and John is the most favorite or best fight, that we are renamed other fights. And about Arm, he said he's training, he's getting better, but of course not 100% yet. And I asked how much it will impact that he's thinking more about rehabilitation than thinking about getting the best shape, he said.
SPEAKER_01: of course that will impact the result and his shape but he's trying i mean i mean if anyone can do it it is the zole family they they they are they are professional about all these things you know yeah yeah this is what i believe yeah by the way you you choose uh chad castle versus yusuf it is near your weight class while krasimir choose a match again
SPEAKER_01: about his class it's very normal arson you are the one that who didn't choose anything arson arson said about uh that his favorite fight is uh gennady against michael todd michael todd yeah and why are you surprised then you didn't choose john versus zolev either
SPEAKER_00: Should I translate? Of course.
SPEAKER_02: Arsene is speaking quite good English as well. Yeah, you get tired already. It is your fault that you kept asking him questions. Now you're going to translate. Yeah, otherwise. Krasimir, how is your Russian? You speak Russian as well, Italy, eh? Krasimir. Yes, I can speak. Yeah, who's going to translate what you said? Тогда я Krasimir попрошу. Если я не с ним может, Krasimir мне не откажет, думаю.
SPEAKER_03: He just said that Michael must win that match. He's thinking that if he wants his career to continue, he must win that match. But isn't it the same for Genadi as well? Yeah, Arsene said that they both are in...
SPEAKER_02: Not like close to end of career, but in a period of career that if you lose, you can't claim anymore that you are number one armistice in the world. So they both are...
SPEAKER_02: They both have to win to claim well. They can afford another loss. Yeah, this I understand. Exactly, exactly, exactly. And he said he has fought Genadi before. He knows him and he knows that he's a fighter and he hasn't faced Michael Todd, but he believes that will be a great fight and very even fight. Very even one, yeah. And Arsene, who do you think is going to win that match? I think Genadi. Genadi is going to win? Yeah?
SPEAKER_02: I hope. You hope? Yeah. How do you see it? That's right. Yeah. Arsene, how do you see that fight? How Genadi could win inside? He could get inside, take hand, press? How do you see it? I think that's how it will be. That's how you described it. That it will be a break, then a tie.
SPEAKER_00: Yannis, you know me better than Krasin does. Genadi knows how to fight, he knows how to fight in the triceps. But Michael Todd has the biggest problem with those who know how to fight in the triceps, who know how to fight further with a lost wrist. So I think that at least for Michael Todd it will be a big challenge. Can Genadi take his wrist? I don't think so. I think he will be without a wrist and all rounds will be like this.
SPEAKER_02: I think so. Because I think Mike fights very well against those who are so powerful. It's just difficult for him to take those who are very technical up. Exactly, yes. And Genadi, they will both be there. Come on, guys. It's going to be a conversation. Just tell us what's going on. And then you tell us in English. I mean, your opinion, you tell us in English.
SPEAKER_02: We are discussing how we see that fight, Genadi against Michael Todd. And I ask in what style he sees Genadi could win if Genadi wins. And I ask about wrist control. Genadi takes that hand or wrist? And he said, you know, sure. But he still thinks that Genadi can win even without hand and with the ISIS press. And what's your opinion about this, Yanis?
SPEAKER_01: i don't think that any of them will have the like total risk risk control unless they both go with the risk to restore he will like end up that way but if both use tornado i don't think that one will have like super risk control so i i'm more expecting something like this and the one who can bring the game to the winning position
SPEAKER_01: I imagine unless there is something that I don't know and I will learn about them.
SPEAKER_03: I want to say something. I was thinking the same way before the match between Genadi and Ermes. But after that match, I don't think that Genadi will win. Because in that match, Genadi was not pressing down. I don't know why. Maybe he didn't feel good, but he was not going forward with the shoulder. Can I tell you why? Because I made a YouTube program with him.
SPEAKER_01: I said, why did you just keep doing four rounds in a row, pulling your elbow like this, when you see that it's resulting the same? He said, before he was hurt. And he psychologically didn't want to try something, you know,
SPEAKER_01: he wasn't ready mentally and then fifth round he said he still didn't push that way but a little bit sideways if you realize it a little bit sideways yeah and he said that fifth round he realized that he wasn't hurting so he said that he was like okay it's not hurting and then six rounds he didn't even uh braver that way he said and i said like wasn't it a too late decision he said yeah he should have tried earlier it doesn't mean that he could have won
SPEAKER_01: Because I don't think after round four, Ermes really killed himself to win. But still, he said that this time, he said that he will do whatever it takes to do it. And he is not afraid. And he said that you will see all Genadi, not the one in Dubai. And then another thing that I want to say, Genadi said that until he was going Dubai a day or a few days before, he thought he was going to pull left hand with Ermes.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, come on, come on. No, that's true. Evgeny Ermes was telling me, Engin, should I pull left or right, you know, because his right brachialis was hurting after Kurdesha match. No, that's true. It's not a lie, you know, trust me. I even, Ermes told me that, you know, his brachialis was hurting from the Kurdesha match and he said, Engin, what to do? I said, listen, you just lost Kurdesha. If you are hurt, if you pull, if you lose again, just forget about like being mentioned about like a
SPEAKER_01: future you know star or something you know with left arm he said i'm gonna lose with left arm he said i said even if you lose you are not going to be blamed like like if you lose with right arm it's not the same thing he said that if he feels good he's gonna pull right arm and then that is why and gennady in fact the truth he told me that his right arm wasn't as red red as he would like to because he thought he was pulling left arm
SPEAKER_00: What are you doing? What do you want to see? He didn't leave anything. What's his name? Arthur. Hello, Arthur. Say hello. How do you say hello? Say hello. Say hello. That's it, go to your mom.
SPEAKER_01: And now what do you think about this Krasimir? Do you think that now if he really pushes that way as well, if he's brave and healthy enough, do you think that things may change? Yes, I believe this is the only way he could win the match. If he doesn't do this, I don't think that he has a chance to win. Yeah, I agree with you. He needs a killer pressure at the winning side. He needs to take the game. If Genadi is called here,
SPEAKER_01: here i think he's gonna lose that match because michael's shoulder pressure will be even stronger than hermes's if he catches him there you know take him here and then bring i think he's gonna press even with a dead wrist
SPEAKER_02: For Genadi, it's impossible to hold in this defensive position. The only way for him is that he's inoffensive. Genadi knows how to fight, but he's not the most technical armwrestler. He's not so good with getting in the best position. He's more like a strength-style armwrestler for me. That makes it more interesting.
SPEAKER_02: To beat Michael Todd, for me, I would take those who are really good at top role. And then I would say, okay, Alex Kudecha lately, Drew Bean, Ermes, those who can top role, they are more dangerous against...
SPEAKER_02: but is not enough you know you also need to yeah yeah yeah you need to be able to transition to that press and uh the question is uh can gennady get in that position in this offensive position if he gets in this offensive position he can press but uh he have to get to that position but the another thing about the gennady versus michael that michael usually puts uh
SPEAKER_01: that matches into the unorthodox pulling style. Somehow you can't really have perfect control. And the Genadi is a type of person that can pull in any position and can apply winning pressure in almost any position, as long as the strength
SPEAKER_03: is very close to each other. So I am expecting a big war there. That was before the injury when he had that injury in Moldova. Before, of course. Right now, we haven't seen that. Exactly what Yanis said. Before he was doing this. But now with Ermes, we didn't see that. But he said he will do it. He said he's psychologically ready as well. We'll see.
SPEAKER_01: What makes me more impressive about these athletes that, you know, they are mentally very strong athletes. Like, they are, I mean, if we see the old Genadi, as he says that we will see, that guy is a warrior. Also, Michael is the same way. These boys are going to fight till the death, you know, there. So it is, and they both know that they can't afford another loss. So I'm just expecting, like,
SPEAKER_01: really really like world war there you know just like they are gonna just i mean the horsepower there will be like i mean oh incredible all right you have pulled against uh gennady before yes 2016 europeans uh and 2016 nimirov i beat him
SPEAKER_03: After that, in 2016 at the Worlds, he beat me. After that, I beat him at Nemirov. And after that, the last time, he beat me at WAF 2017 in Hungary. I mean, it was very impressive, Krasimir. Being like a 100-205 kilo maximum guy, pulling supers and beating those guys, just incredible, incredible.
SPEAKER_03: I still want to try to win the WAF Heavyweight Finals. I realize that I'm not able, with no roads, to win top eight, but I really would like to try again to win the WAF Heavyweights. Yeah, you should try. If you're planning to make a comeback, you know, we still have one month, trust me. You know what I mean. Just let me know.
SPEAKER_01: for you always we just need a good opponent for you yeah hey arsene can you get ready in one month i'm joking i mean i i i love being with you guys you know it's just like all of these guys just know about arm wrestling and we have very like
SPEAKER_01: long common history together, you know, from event to event, it's just like, I just love it. And I know how much you guys also love arm wrestling. And so I think that we understand about Krasimir versus, Krasimir Genadi versus Michael. So if we go to the next one, about a Montego, we saw Tsonev versus Bogoslov. And Bogoslov was 110 kilo. And when we saw Bogoslov,
SPEAKER_01: even 85 kilo, he was just like a, uh, like incredible guy, very strong guy. And then whenever I heard that he is near 110 kilo, I was just thinking he is just Superman now. And he is probably, and, and I didn't really give any chance to Tsonev. And at the WAF, last WAF, Bojidar told me that, uh, he's gonna win two rounds Bogoslov and then Tsonev is going to win the, uh,
SPEAKER_01: last ones and it didn't go exactly that way but somehow uh sonar won and then we we started thinking sonar is just like that level again and then yesterday we see uh another show by by tatashins and then um he didn't look normal either and of course it is not going to be same because as far as i see uh janice would know better than i do about lachlan but he is more like muscle
SPEAKER_01: type of puller, you know, compared to Tsonev. So we are not going to see exactly the same thing. Also, we are not going to see touchings like Bogoslov. Bogoslov with a shoulder tricep combination pressure on the bicep of Tsonev while Hutchings will go side pressure and maybe a little bit dragging at the end. And so what are your opinions about this? Who wants to start first?
SPEAKER_03: probably have best best understanding about what sonia can uh actually sonia's side pressure is incredible i believe it will be close to todd hutchins side pressure but a little bit uh maybe a little bit um
SPEAKER_03: hutchins side pressure may be a little bit stronger but on his side pressure may be a bit more effective because his arm is longer and it will be on higher point of todd hutchins arm that's why i believe that his type of pulling may be not good i mean todd hutchins may feel uncomfortable against 1f
SPEAKER_03: But I believe that Yordan must win fast. If the match just stops in the middle, then I believe Hutchings is the favorite. But I hope that Yordan will have the strength to finish. Yordan has good endurance as well, you know. And I will ask you something, Krasimir. Just, you know, Yordan, incredible joints. But he is not like so muscular guy like Loughlin.
SPEAKER_01: just imagine that if he had the the the same bicep you know arm strangle lachlan with this the joints and side pressure ability that he has already together then it would be very bad match up for patashi's right yes yes yes so and and yannis uh lachland lachland and hutchings uh
SPEAKER_02: hutching todd was so good with controlling uh lachlan's rotator and uh lachlan was generally all the time uh under like holding all his biceps and this in this defensive position and i think in the fight uh again uh same same as bogus lawyers and same as sergey was able to get in that position also hatching will get in that position and i think
SPEAKER_02: sonia will be in this defensive bison's position but sonia as we saw in a fight with bogusloyo he can hold in that position christian is for how long pressure you know boguslo was pressuring to the forward and then uh hutchings more like a side and
SPEAKER_02: And catching Todd always in inside game, we talk about joint strength, side pressure, anything, but what we can see in those fights when Todd is pulling inside, he's almost always taking rotator of opponent.
SPEAKER_02: He's always able to rotate his opponents and they are usually getting in this under-defensive biceps position. I think that Yordan will be in the same position with Sonia, with Todd. Yordan will be in this defensive biceps position. Can he hold in that position? How long can he hold in that position?
SPEAKER_01: But are we sure that the match is going to end there? You know, the reason that Loughlin was there, you know, because he was trying to use his pronator and then Todd was forcing him there, you know, so that's why he was going like this. But here, Sonam is just not going to use here and then put out of position. He is directly going to go. So you believe he will overpress Todd and Todd will be under? What's that?
SPEAKER_01: So you believe that he will overpress him? I believe what I believe that Lachlan wanted to go out and forced to be in while Tsonev is directly going to go there. Nobody is going to force him inside. He's just going to directly try to attack on the... I'm sure that Yordan is going to put much more pressure over on
SPEAKER_01: clutching is pronated than Loughlin did. Yes, yes, exactly. That's for sure. I'm not saying that, you know, we all know it. At the end, what says the last word is the strength, you know, that part we can calculate. But about the style,
SPEAKER_03: I mean, I will tell you something. I'm sure that Yordan will take the center. I'm sure about this. At least the first one, two rounds, Yordan will take the center. I'm not sure if Yordan will be able to finish the match, but I'm sure that Yordan will take the center. Yannis is thinking that way. You are thinking that he's going to take the center?
SPEAKER_01: I am expecting something very close because both have very strong side pressure and both will go sideways. I will ask you something. Did they pull in Moldova? No, no, no. No? No. But before Sacho pulled Hutchings, Yordan and Sacho pulled, right? Long match.
SPEAKER_03: Yordan and Sasho pulled about 10 seconds much. Only 10 seconds? Yes. Yeah, I thought it was longer. Yeah, maybe I misremember it. But I pulled Sasho about 30-40 seconds. Before Sasho pulled Hutchings? Yes, yes. Oh, okay, okay, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah. So, but what I'm just saying that Yordan is a tall guy. So, when they pull in a 95 kilo category,
SPEAKER_01: Hutchings and Yordan Yordan didn't pull him but in that category they pulled 95. so now when we are talking if we are talking about you I talked with Yordan he said he's gonna be about 105 kilos now he's 102 kilo and 105. so what I'm just saying that when the category limit weight limit is going higher it is uh going in the favor of the taller guy because yeah because they are like more have possibility to become more
SPEAKER_00: This is my opinion. So let's see how it will be. Arsene, what do you think about this? Krass, if it's not too difficult, please translate it. I understand what you're saying. Translate it, please.
SPEAKER_00: I absolutely agree with you, with Yanis, with Engin. You are probably an expert on that. The fact is that the fight will be very unpredictable. Because, if you agree with me, Hutchings probably did not fight with such a long arm as Sonny.
SPEAKER_00: I agree with you that the center will probably be taken away by Tsonev. I don't think so. But on the other hand, Tsonev has never faced such lateral pressure. And you know, I probably agree more with you, because it seems to me that if Tsonev can break through the center here, and after such a hard fight with Bogoslovakia,
SPEAKER_00: I think you don't have to write it down from the accounts. We all know what a very strong hooker Hutchings is, what a strong side movement. But at the same time, Hutchings also never fought.
SPEAKER_00: Sen said that he agrees with all of us, but mostly he thinks that probably Yordan will take the center of the match.
SPEAKER_03: Todd Hutchings never pulled with somebody with so long arm going inside. And we saw with Sergei Boguslov that Yordan is very powerful and it will be very tough match for both of the guys. At the same time, Yordan never pulled with somebody with such an incredible side pressure. So it will be something new for both of the guys. And it's really unpredictable.
SPEAKER_02: Arsene said one more interesting thing. He said that Todd probably hasn't pulled with someone with so good motivation. Yes, yes. Who is so motivated. I don't know why, but why do you think he is more motivated than the others, Sonia?
SPEAKER_00: I remember myself at that age, I don't know exactly how old he is, but judging by the fact that we won at that age, I don't know how old he is, but can you imagine when you have RFI,
SPEAKER_00: who can bring you, you can become number one in terms of 95 kilograms at the moment. And it seems to me that he is hungry for victory. And he has something to prove. He really wants to win. That is, for him, this defeat will probably be so, if I say it correctly, painful. Hutchings has already won, lost. And it still seems to me that Sonny is more hungry for victory, probably so.
SPEAKER_02: yeah he thinks that uh sonia is much more uh hungry hungry and uh ones that fight more than others and uh that he's uh younger and uh still wants to prove himself that's that's a like uh danger for uh todd you'll see yeah for the for the people who are following us guys you know uh this can't get any better than this what you're watching now you're talking
SPEAKER_01: I'm excluding myself, but these three guests are like, they know 100% what they talk about. The only things are like minor, minor perspective differences and all make sense. But some, they all know the possibilities, but they think that like this possibility will happen or that possibility will, that's the only difference. But this, you can learn a lot about our nursing. There's a super chat.
SPEAKER_01: clerks thank you for super chat fully prepared arsene versus gasparini who wins short answer for you guys short answer yanis hard to say short short answer right it's impossible short but uh
SPEAKER_02: would say like this uh best ever arson we have seen and best ever uh gasparini we have seen there is about like 20 kilo difference between the best yeah so so i i still would go with arson still yeah but but airbus is still growing you know airbus is still growing i am very curious to see that match because it will be the fight between two iron wrists yeah yeah yeah
SPEAKER_01: with posting style. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. I kind of see Arsene a little bit more explosive than Ermes. Ermes is explosive, very explosive. I see Arsene a little bit more explosive. Yeah. And I see Arsene more ready to go sideways while Gasparini more like positioning, you know, first. Taking control and then... Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, Arsene can do that too, but
SPEAKER_01: uh there is one guy wild frames thank you for super chat he says hello from bulgaria hello to bulgaria and so let's go to the greatest of all times wait wait wait uh saint didn't say what he thinks about match versus gasparini i just didn't want to put him in a hard position
SPEAKER_01: But one, hey, listen, listen, listen. I didn't forget the last interview we did with you, Arsene. Remember you said that you would be Latin? Remember? Of course, of course. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But right now, you are not thinking the same way, right? About the current Latin you see. No. Come on.
SPEAKER_00: No, no, no, no. Krasi, translate it, please. I can't explain it in English. I've always been very uncomfortable with the athletes who fought well in the hook. The biggest problems I've experienced in my career were with you, Krasimir. But I'm not talking about the strength that Laletin now weighs 140 kilograms.
SPEAKER_00: During the interview with Engin, it was always very, very comfortable for me to fight the top fighters. I fought Vitaly many times, and he was very comfortable for me. I think the same goes for Gasparini. I saw his fight, and it was comfortable for me.
SPEAKER_00: But at the same time, I can't say that Gasparini weighs 120 kilos. I think that if I grew up and trained and fought all this time, then why not? I could win them. First of all, they are convenient for me in terms of technique. Yes. Avsen just said that during his career he was always good against top rowers. He had some problems against some hook pullers, but against top rowers he was always feeling comfortable.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah. He said that he thinks that if he was training all the time during this period, he would be the favorite. But you never know. He said that now War Latin is a lot heavier and he cannot say, but he always had good times against top rowers. Yeah. Yeah. I understand. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: He said that his biggest problems in his career was me against me. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Arsham was usually beating him.
SPEAKER_01: not with top roll, but he was hooking him and Arsene was beating him with the drag bicep, bicep pulling, yeah. And so let's go to greatest of all times versus probably the second greatest of all time, Ajumma Zola. So who wants to start?
SPEAKER_02: it's it's quite strange because uh they both are okay they both are wear style lately especially customer as well and then joe john we know he can do anything but uh theoretically we both uh they both are well known for the ability to be super strong inside krasimir and john but i think
SPEAKER_02: in this fight very possible that they both could go outside and it will be fight for hand control not not only inside one thing uh we have seen for uh for uh krasimir for uh for uh kazimirov lately that he's doing much more outside lately even restored even in in above walls and uh i believe john could could do the same as well so i don't know if we will see deep inside hook war but in some rounds for sure but not for beginning i think
SPEAKER_01: So where do you see, where do you see Zoloev is trying to go and where do you see Zoloev is having chance? I'm sure it will be top row versus top row. Listen, listen, in 2015 A1, of course, John was heavier. But, you know, when the boat went to outside in a strap, it looked too easy.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, just one thing, you know, Haji Murad Zola, without the strap, you know, he has very strong grip and then beats the guys sideways. But in the strap, do you really believe that his outside skill is that great? Where did we see him, like, you know, in the strap, just doing great top reliability? Where is it, like, especially against John? Just do you think that, like, he's going to have, like, a full hand
SPEAKER_01: top role versus or the the best thing he can do is go out and then john will go out but imagine that both these are flat and they have pronated who do you think is going to go sideways i think john is going to go there i mean john we have seen him versus even dennis and many guys even his latest match versus devon they both were like this norris and then john was the with the side pressure and you know
SPEAKER_01: they will hardly survive, you know, by going, you know, open on top row. And so what I'm just trying to say, I don't really see Zola having such an experience and muscle memory at that level to beat John in a strap with a flat wrist that way. Of course he has beaten with a dead wrist, but I don't think that, you know, John is someone to be beaten that way. You know, I don't think John has, I only see,
SPEAKER_03: Zoloev doing something without the strap outside. In the strap, I somehow see only Zoloev doing something inside. That's all I see. And I would like to hear your opinion. And that's why, with all my respect to Haji, I believe that he doesn't have big chances against John. He's a master against hook pullers, but not that great against top rollers. This is what I think. And Arsene?
SPEAKER_00: Arsene doesn't want to comment so much. He's his best friend. No, no, no, no, no. Krasimir, let's be objective. I agree with you. The biggest problem is that we can't see Haji Murat 100% ready. He had a serious injury. He needs to recover as much as possible.
SPEAKER_00: But if there will be a fight in the hook, then it will be an interesting fight, I think. But if John will fight only in the top, and in the first rounds when he will be able to take the fist and control the fist and will not win quickly, then Haji will have little chance. But I hope that he will be able to recover and fight in the hook.
SPEAKER_03: He said that if Hadji tries to top roll, he has not big chances, but he is hoping that Hadji will recover and he will be able to go and hook. Yeah, that is the thing that, you know, after I saw him, you know, his elbow issue in the last wrap a month ago, you know, you may heal your elbow in one month.
SPEAKER_01: but like to heal your elbow enough to like be drawn inside that good, you know, in, um,
SPEAKER_02: i will be curious about hey by the way i i love your cats you know i like it special yeah that's the same with haji we've been talking before with us and like uh it's uh one thing is uh you can recover second thing is you need to get stronger you need to show your best performance and uh it's not enough time for a fully recovery and it's still uh if you want to show some uh your your best your best shape it's
SPEAKER_02: it's questionable so uh and uh his his previous or last performance in in a world championship was not so impressive so it's all seems for haji like uh like tough tough thing to do and uh to to be john but the question is who knows any chance zolev to do what he did to hutchings
SPEAKER_01: that beating John without the strap, I think is hard. Because I think John is knowledgeable and has strong enough pronator to, you know, go to strap. But do you think that there is a chance Zoloev to finish the match without the strap, at least one round or something? Or John is just too experienced and knowledgeable to not to, I mean, even with Alexey Voivoda, he went to,
SPEAKER_01: strap but uh what do you think i'm sure it will go to the straps yeah this is what i believe as well yeah that's what i believe so uh arsene what does haji think i'm not asking about his strategy but does haji think that you know he has good chance of uh beating john
SPEAKER_00: To be honest, I will say it as it is. We discussed his chances, his percentage. The only thing he said was that he would try to do everything he could with the form he had. He tried to do everything he could. What will happen and how will it happen? First of all, he doesn't even know what kind of John he will be in. Maybe he will be very good, maybe the weight loss will affect him.
SPEAKER_03: What's the weight limit for that fight? It's 100? 102. 225. Arsene said that Haji doesn't know in what kind of shape he will be, but he said that he's not sure in what shape John will be also.
SPEAKER_03: maybe the weight cutting for john will drop some of his power and we'll see a good match and haji said that he will just do anything he can in the match yeah this this is a lifetime opportunity he got his revenge from hutchings and now john yeah
SPEAKER_02: I believe also Khajiit Murad is experienced enough and he understands armwrestling and he knows that he has a chance. He wouldn't accept the fight if he didn't believe in himself.
SPEAKER_02: And one more thing, if we watch John against Pauline, John against Chance, his hand was not so impressive as well. And the question is how strong will be John in that weight. And he had to lose the weight before the fight.
SPEAKER_01: In the same way around when you put Pauline, you know? Yeah, in the straps against Pauline, John's hand was good, but he was vulnerable. I understand, but just only thing is that, like, is it the way, like, do you think that Haji Murad's outside ability is better than Dmitry Kachan? No way. Ask Krasimir. Do you think that Haji has the same outside ability like Dmitry Kachan?
SPEAKER_01: don't think so no way no way not the arm fight not the like staying you know i mean no way just just put dmitry kashin and zolev them to top roll each other and look at the result you know the same second you will see haji this way with outside but john also get lost his wrist but he still had the tornadoes to rotate and still yeah exactly so this is what i'm saying that i'm not saying that haji cannot put john in the same same point but can he finish it that way like both will
SPEAKER_01: I don't think that Haji will have full wrist, hand, top roll. He may take John's wrist, but trust me, he will also lose here. If you go outside with John, at the same time, the control here is not that easy. Evgeny Arsene, in the strap matches in Istanbul, he went outside in the strap, he went more outside, and then John started taking his wrist from here. Am I wrong, Arsene? Remember? Yes, yes, yes. But it's unfortunate.
SPEAKER_01: john is what's that customer it's true but uh let's remember to all the people again that the strap was the old way and buckle was on our sense wrist every time yeah but still you know just i mean you can't be like you know just because buckle on my hand i'm gonna lose the wrist you know i mean like whenever i pull after here first and second round one time buckle was on me second
SPEAKER_03: It's different. With somebody that even, I believe that if the buckle was on John's hand, Arsene could finish the match with top row. Trust me, trust me. Artur's pronation and back pressure. Did you see when Alain Oleg finished him? His wrist was like this. Arsene, what do you think? If the buckle was on John's side, do you think that you could win one or two rounds in the straps?
SPEAKER_03: Now translate it, Krasimir, and everything will be fine. I don't know if you know, but now, when we supply связка, there is another... And in the past, it was your side. It was much harder. And now there is not such a big difference. But in the past, it was there. And I ask you,
SPEAKER_03: What do you think, when you fought with John Brzenk, when he beat you to the top, was it on your side? How do you think, could you have won one or two rounds if it was on John's hands? I don't think it played such a big role.
SPEAKER_00: I don't remember that fight very well. I did what I wanted to do and he stopped me. And from my comfortable position, he knocked my wrist back. I don't think it would have played a big role. That's probably how the fight would have gone.
SPEAKER_03: What's that?
SPEAKER_01: So he said that he thinks that even if the strap was on John's hand, it could be the same. But we will never know the truth. Yeah, you're right. Arsene has been pulling like many matches, buckle on his hand, buckle on the opponent's hand. You know, I mean, that was the only time that we saw Arsene is losing his wrist, you know, as far as I remember. Yeah. Anyway, so we are just thinking that like, just if you just go say like one thing,
SPEAKER_01: Who's going to win? I'm not going to ask you, Arsene. Because even you think different way, you may not want the same opinion. But who's going to win, Yanis? John or Haji? John. Krasi? I also think John. Yeah, I also think John as well. This is what I think. But let's see. Let's see how it will be. So we don't, I'm not going to keep you guys so long. Oleg Zhokh versus Bath Kili. Many of the people are thinking this is a big mismatch. Do you agree?
SPEAKER_01: I think this is a great match. This is the best for Oleg Zhokh. I mean, here we can really see a real war. You know, Badkili, I tell everyone this, Badkili at 75 kilos and Badkili at 90 kilos, the guy is 190 centimeters tall. And it's not the same. Badkili, even when he was 75 kilos, he was head to head with
SPEAKER_01: rest now we're talking about what will be the weight limit now 90 kilo 90 kilo yeah so i and he has tall forearm and you know uh bojidar gave him some trouble you know while trying to hook uh zog at the europeans and bojidar short arm you know not much reach and now i don't know i think that he
SPEAKER_02: came with some upset there, you know. Yeah, but Kili has very good hooking capability and he could get in his position. But we haven't seen him for how long now? Maybe two years? So I don't know. When the pandemic started, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, we don't know anything about his shape, but if he shows somewhere in his best, he's very dangerous, very dangerous. And I remember always Vladislav Krasovski, how he struggled against Betkely and he said it's impossible to top roll him and it's always better to go inside against him. But he couldn't still press him always, Betkely was even holding in his defensive positions
SPEAKER_01: very good in the room very dangerous and krasimir you think there is any chance that beth can win or actually i think that beth kelly can win that match i mean oh you think that he has chance to win yeah yes actually his favorite in my eyes oh okay okay yeah and arsene do you follow beth kelly do you know him
SPEAKER_00: I don't know, I don't remember. I was just very interested when they announced that there would be a fight with Oleg Zhokh. I found a couple of videos where he fought. At 75 he fought Yannis, right? Or even at 70 kilograms? 75, yes.
SPEAKER_00: 75. He's very dangerous, very strong. And once two super experts, Yannis and Krasimir, say that it will be either a very equal fight or even a victory for the opponent, Zhokh, then I can only agree with them.
SPEAKER_02: Arsene said he doesn't know Betkili, but when he saw that the fight will happen, Oleg Zhokh against Betkili, he watched on the internet and then he searched for his fights and he said he's looking really dangerous and good and he doesn't have a clear opinion about that income.
SPEAKER_00: I was reading some comments. Arsene is saying that he has to go. His son has a temperature and he has to help.
SPEAKER_01: help his wife a little bit again sorry sorry my friend but okay we will also finish yeah thank you very much and if we go quickly uh arif versus hermes
SPEAKER_03: I think you guys don't see much chance. This is what I think. Actually, this is something very interesting because the way Arif won the Worlds was very, very impressive. The way he beat Tsiadkov was mega impressive for me because Tsiadkov was in very good shape before the Worlds.
SPEAKER_03: At the training, he was killing me. I felt his wrist just iron and Arif beat him. And I was very surprised with that. And before that, I was thinking that Ermes is the clear favorite. But after the Worlds, I believe that Arif may have a chance. And what if Arif is even going to be stronger than what you see last time at WAF?
SPEAKER_01: he will be okay what's that we will see you said yeah he will be stronger will he uh i i think that you know whenever he was coming to off very interestingly he was not training he said he wasn't he may not even come but you know sometimes some athletes when they kill themselves to get in shape you know they sometimes go this way but sometimes when you when you rest
SPEAKER_01: then all those minor injuries and everything that, you know, because of those many, many months of training, heal up. And then suddenly you feel yourself better just because you are healed up everywhere. You understand? So Arif is in, he was totally healed up for the WAF. And now he will be healed up plus better trained. Yeah. My opinion, he will be about 10% stronger than what you saw him at WAF.
SPEAKER_02: opinion yeah it will be all about hand control with with aramis if if arif will be able to get in a fight definitely he have a chance but the question can he get in a fight because if aramis will take are if arif can pull in different ways and and we have seen arif uh time to time in the incredible shape and very good but also we have seen arif
SPEAKER_02: example in a super matches in kazakhstan or it was in uh it was hurt you know yeah yeah so we have seen articles also in different shapes but uh good good shape healthy is dangerous and and uh if he can get in that fight he can he can pull really good and also in a in a long fight as well again against the top rollers out of doesn't like out of his super heavyweight but his hands
SPEAKER_01: like, like a craft image is not really hand size or the super heavyweight. And so whenever he pulls guys like Levan, or Kurdesha, you know, very tall arms, you know, and like big hands, you know, sometimes he has like gripping problem. But Ermes will not be one of them. Ermes will be about our size and about the general size, not the weight.
SPEAKER_01: Arif is now 146 kilos. And I think that he will be able to apply his strength, you know, and then let's see what will happen. Yeah. And other than that, other than that, if we go, what do you think about Rebeka versus Fia? I'm sure Yanis is going to favor Fia. Why do you think so? They're friends.
SPEAKER_02: yeah but arm wrestling and uh your friends are friends but uh arm wrestling is arm wrestling rebecca is uh rebecca is uh great for a super match she she can she can pull in a
SPEAKER_02: sometimes strange positions and then and hold her opponents for long and if if rebecca will be able to stop the fight and and and and burn burn and uh get get get that position and probably fear could get tired she could warn but uh i think fear is strongest one there maybe maybe but uh we have seen rebecca that he can she can hold and hold and hold and uh and she's endurance is great and she's so
SPEAKER_03: I don't think so. I believe Fia will be the better puller, more well-rounded. But I believe Rebeka will be the stronger puller. And Rebeka is the favorite in my eyes. See, I love this. I invited here two guys that know about armwrestling. I said two now because you two are here.
SPEAKER_01: and arsene in fact he knows our message a lot but after he retired he didn't follow as deeply as you guys did and of course he's very knowledgeable guy as well but he may not arsene will be arsene will be in istanbul as well he was going to come but something happened he said he cannot come you know i said he was going to come and even ref here
SPEAKER_01: anyway so you guys to have good opinion about the these ladies armrests you know also great thing you know thank you because like when people like you know okay i don't know much about them you know it's just like at least know about the best ones you understand yeah and rebecca was 80 kilo in in 2019 and she gave some travel even to yes to gabriella yeah yeah she even yeah not not against the even i'm okay you know
SPEAKER_01: i think in 2019 there was a gabriella i don't think there was uh yeah i could i i thought it was yeah maybe maybe a year before year before yeah yeah yeah i mean the way the way that she beat glatka was very very impressive you know it's just all in the strap balance to match and then boom you know it was interesting alin sando thank you for super chat great job with these interviews mr engine training tips for amazing top role
SPEAKER_01: I would love some educational interviews. Thanks a lot. Thank you very much. Right now, I'm totally focused on the East versus West. Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe in the future, my friend. And if we go, Rambeth versus Efe. Left arm. I think this will be not that good match. I believe Ron will be able to hook Efe and beat him.
SPEAKER_03: you think runs runs hook inability is as good as like yours maybe not but i think that the match will end up in straps and to go in hook yeah i started to train ever about pronator but we just did only one last tuesday and we will do one it will not be enough i hope i wish we had like three months and yeah
SPEAKER_03: I realize that Efe is very good against top rowers. His wrist is really good, but against hook pullers, not that good. It depends on if it's a hook specialist or not, you know. Like Ron is very well-rounded, but is he like really that quick, that fast about hooking? Let's see. Let's see. But Ron Bath versus Zurab will be a great match, according to me. And what do you guys think about that match? I think it will be a war.
SPEAKER_03: And he's super much with Zurab. He should be warned because we know Zurab can hold in craziest positions. But do you guys think that he will go inside for sure? Of course, of course. He will go a strap and then? Actually, I believe that Ron could take Zurab's wrist also. In strap or without strap? With and without. Oh, really?
SPEAKER_02: Wow. And Janis? First of all, it always seems for me un-understandable. Ron is 60 or he will be 60 a few days after Istanbul. It seems crazy and I can't believe that at the age of 60 you can still go so strong. Same as John, same as Todd Hutchings.
SPEAKER_02: if if we will see uh some of or at least close to that level we have seen ron in in some of his best years ron is ron is uh ron is legendary and he's strong and he's he's uh i i believe with uh with zurab i don't know how much he will he will search and and look what what zurab is doing and and he could
SPEAKER_02: just just go for first fight uh to test his strength and go against him and we could see like a good good good inside fight from very beginning but do you think that inside it will be close one yeah yeah for sure yeah wow he said he will be uh about 100 kilo and ron is 112 kilo yeah this is this is um
SPEAKER_01: And Cherkasov versus Yusuf, you said that it could be a close one. And Krasimir, you said, what did you say about that match? I also think that it will be a good hook war. Hook war and then the one with the endurance will have the edge? I believe Cherkasov has the edge. Because of his endurance, huh? Yes, yes.
SPEAKER_01: and and and and sundries versus chance i believe this uh much uh will end up in hook also are you serious oh yeah you mean you mean you mean sundries is gonna force it yeah yes this is what and then if it ends up there then it will be easy one for sundries
SPEAKER_03: I don't know, but Sandris is the favorite in my eyes. I like James Shaw, he's still developing, but in this match I believe Sandris is the favorite. I'm not going to ask this to Giannis.
SPEAKER_02: No, I just... Janis has close connections from both sides, close connections. I do, I do. And people say that, like, Sandris is favorite and who knows, but when I talk with Canscho and also I talk with Sandris,
SPEAKER_02: they both haven't pulled they both have met and they no one of them can pull against the even same opponents so it's it's impossible to predict uh who could who could have a
SPEAKER_02: better chance on this one and uh before in the beginning of this year uh chance shows that for ones that four four men round robin against the jordan sickle michael very impressive and don underwood that was really impressive and uh in that in such a shape yeah he he's dangerous arm wrestler and and then john beat him that that shape and he said now he's in better shape
SPEAKER_01: yeah but the loss against john it's uh there's nothing to be ashamed and then i will be i will be i will be one of them soon in march
SPEAKER_02: we will talk about that later and then you know it's it's you never know before fight haven't ended but uh and uh and then chan show have have some uh training videos with uh with uh larry wheel and and larry was winning but that's training video it doesn't matter i mean i don't want to go there i don't want to go there as it looks probably you know as well yeah
SPEAKER_01: yeah yeah okay whatever i don't want to talk but uh okay so you said that we're gonna go there later but do you think that whenever when i pulled john in norway do you think that it was like it's gonna be like a total domination like just like like this you believe
SPEAKER_02: from from a job side or from one side not not me for sure yeah we have talked about this before and uh i i can say it just one more time that uh i believe uh
SPEAKER_02: so so uh so if you can be uh more or less healthy if you can feel good and and you could be close to 90 100 kilo or something and with your hand control with your rotator you could take john's hand and uh question can you do something from that but uh
SPEAKER_01: Yes. Same story like Zoloev. He may go here, but can he go? Question, can you do something? My wrist will do a little bit better than Zoloev's about
SPEAKER_01: not saying that my wrist flexor is as strong as zolevs but the the handling strength when when two guys are hitting each other the wrist to handle i don't think i will lose the wrist but even you don't lose the wrist if you can't really control the pronator i don't know how much because wrist one thing can you control rotator that's another thing no no i can't control his rotator i can i cannot control his rotator but i may i may
SPEAKER_01: uh not allow him to go out stay here then the only thing is that my pronator based pressure will be enough or not but do you think you know uh so you think that he's gonna win but it may not be easy that's what you're saying yes and also we have never seen a 90 or 100 kilo engine jersey yeah so what we don't know 190 kilo just i am already over 90 kilo but i'm like this
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, so I'm about 80 kilos, so I can be. And what do you think, Krasi? Do you think there is any chance? I believe the match would look like as John Brzee versus Arsene Lille. You could be able to take here, and from here, John could top roll you. Yeah, I exactly think the same way. But do you see John hooking me? No, no, no. No?
SPEAKER_01: Not in the first few rounds, maybe later, but not for beginning, yeah. Yeah. Not for beginning. I will be training with Arif. I will be training for everything, you know, even what Krasimir showed, also this one and everything. Arif is very great. I think I will believe what I want to, I mean, I will say what I want to say, but like the Arif as of now, and then John that I will meet at 102 kilo limit, Arif would beat John. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Can you trouble Arif a little bit now? You know, remember Arif's shape from here when you came to the picnic? He says he's now 20% stronger than that shape. And I will only say it this way. Arif is stronger than me, for sure. But we do like 45 seconds full. Of course, he gives me training.
SPEAKER_01: After that, we both need like five minutes for our arms to go down. You know, I asked Arif, let's go. He said, one more minute. So, so yeah. Yeah. So Arif would just hold me and beat me. Yeah. But like my coordination, everything was so good to really pump his arm like long time, you know? So do you understand what I said? Yeah. Yeah. But right now I'm not, especially the bicep,
SPEAKER_02: I'm very afraid like every training lately I'm just thinking that you know bicep is not gonna hold and just I will just go that's that's the thing with you and John your your hand strength will be enough question is can your arm hold that strength can you can your arm call that stress that's the question I need I need finishing finishing strength which is not only it can also maybe open you up in an angle as well but
SPEAKER_02: what do you mean like like like with the pressure i will open like this or that you could get in a position and one thing not not really side but you can he could open open you up with with uh with uh yeah yeah with the pronator side pressure yeah yeah you could be still in position but uh laws that that's exactly what krasimir said krasimir john is going to beat me and he's going to beat me in that way that is yeah but but again i said uh 100 kilo engine there's a
SPEAKER_01: Who knows? No one knows. I'm not 100. I will not be. I'm about like 93 now. I'm maybe 96 or something. But most on fat. Good time. Good time. What's next for you, Krasimir? Say again? What's next for you? When are we going to see you again? I really don't know. I'm prepared. But you said that you are planning to go back to WAF and win the Super Airways. And what are you going to do?
SPEAKER_03: I would like to try this, but I'm not sure that I will do it this year. I don't know. I'm training now and I'm lifting very good weights. Actually, the weights that I lift, this is my peak shape. So I'm waiting for competition where I can pull. I understand. But sometimes when you're waiting for the competition,
SPEAKER_01: first you need to make a make a decision where you're gonna go and then that way then you you may have offers you know you know what i mean yeah it is not up to me if it was up to me you know i don't really care you know like if you have contracts for top eight with with igor mazurenko and uh oh i don't care for uh open and with right arm i don't have contract but uh our president
SPEAKER_03: uh wants me to sign a paper that i will not pull any more eagles competition if i want to pull nationals and europeans and worlds yeah i don't want to sign this kind of document i will wherever i want yeah that is the reason that i cannot you might you because we are
SPEAKER_01: members of my federation to to for me to organize an event here i need to get permission from the federation here and then the federation is a member of that we we all know you know what it is you know yes but the top hutchins is the match that i want for for many years already yeah you know who else wants tatashins uh uh ivan matushenko he wants yeah you want also one scene so i mean it would be great you know i mean listen if i continue organizing this event
SPEAKER_01: I am investing a lot and I don't want to go into details, but if I lose a lot of money, I can't anymore. But even if I go, even if I don't lose, you understand, then, then I want to do more. It's great. You know, I will not go this much, like 16 matches or something. You know, I don't want to go again. It's just too much. Five, six, seven, maybe maximum is good. And imagine that, you know, like all the time, you know, three times a year.
SPEAKER_01: inviting you guys you understand it will be incredible you know it's nice yeah yeah yeah touching sources here yeah will you still want to pull touching if jordan beats him yes yes still yeah okay yeah wow this that you don't beat him doesn't mean that i will beat him i understand so you want to take care of your own business from the yes yes yes exactly
SPEAKER_01: And yeah, let's see if you are going to see Hutchings is losing in hook in a match that he gets into. With Rustem, you know, Rustem doesn't even allow Hutchings to get any position. Evgeny if it looks hook, it just, you know, before he gets any luck, he's pinned already. But I have a question. Do you believe if they just lock in a hook slow, do you think Rustem can beat Hutchings in hook in a slow start? I think so. I think so.
SPEAKER_01: can beat him still yes I think that he has the the biceps pronator and the down pressure to finish that match oh yeah even even Todd is locked you know there still he can open him up well I think so I think so yeah that's how our nursing is beautiful usually beats rustem in hook and
SPEAKER_01: um Zola can't really beat uh Hutchings in the hook and then Hutchings cannot beat rustam and i mean everything is just yes yes this is the beauty of the sport exactly exactly that's the magic of arm wrestling yeah yeah and people people just makes so simple math this guy beat this guy so he's gonna beat this guy i mean i i wish he was working like that but i mean it's not unfortunately it's not you know
SPEAKER_01: In fact, fortunately, it's not. As you said, it's the BDO armament. The last question. Devon versus Levan. Honestly. I believe Devon has no chance. Devon? I just think that Levan is too strong. This is what I think. Devon has no chance, you're saying? Yes. Is it still the same? If the
SPEAKER_02: setup is long and you don't think there is any possibility for leon hands to get tired i don't think i don't see any chances and janice it's uh it's so it's so uh impossible to compare them right now and uh and everyone is talking about their one after michael todd but uh
SPEAKER_02: knows how how good michael was because they they were they were looking better than ever was it was it really like this who knows but uh they they won uh has a chance against everyone in a long game can he get in this long long game and then can he stop uh lebanon not sure not sure if if i have to choose i would go of course and say that uh lebanon is favorite for sure
SPEAKER_02: uh but i'm not saying that uh it's impossible for for devon to to find something uh to to to to win against it's but you know in a french power there is no difference fresh power i think of course eleven of bow i see that but uh but uh that's the arm wrestling and that's a super fight and uh and uh it's it's it's dubai it's it's uh it's not buff rules and everything and
SPEAKER_03: okay okay i have one question guys do you get with no kinks move or desperation move listen listen listen how do you describe it under under table over table doesn't matter for me i mean for me it matters because if he's under like this you really need to break the arm you know if it's over at least it can come you know there you know doesn't matter do you think that if devon
SPEAKER_01: go stays above the table he has chance do you think that he has chance when i don't believe he has chance but the only thing is when you get tired you know like like if the setup is long they just like this this this i mean this is hand like your hand just imagine that you know arif and i we train after we train yusuf 70 kilo because arif's arm was pumped
SPEAKER_01: I mean I also was pumped we couldn't do anything, because your arms pump once your arm is pumped it doesn't matter if you can live 200 kilo if you can apply so. Somehow level needs to save everything he has for the goal if he somehow goes to do that and fighting if your arms pump I know that if your hand gets numb.
SPEAKER_01: haven't you guys experienced your arm is you know really pumped and you can't even close your fingers smart enough to don't go in this game yes yes i believe that too he's smart but
SPEAKER_02: Let's see, Devon is also smarter. Devon can just get in your mind, you know. Just what we are saying, that of course, Lewand is favorite. Probably Lewand has much more chance to win. But I'm not saying that it's impossible that some, like, it's not like a wonder even. It's just even in any fight, opponent have a chance, of course.
SPEAKER_01: For me, it would be a wonder if Devon wins. Which means like eight or nine wonders of the world. That would be interesting. And Krasimir, do you think that Laletin that you pulled has a chance against Levan? I don't know. I cannot say. Just the guy that I pulled was super strong. First time you felt that
SPEAKER_01: your weight disadvantage is something really matters i think this is the first time because you have been pulling against the super heavy weights even i see pushkar beating you but you are kind of like catching him very near to the pad you know just like i mean like you wish that you know if he was a little bit slower and then you catch him like 10 something above i kind of saw that
SPEAKER_01: he was too much but still you know but there here he just even allowed you to apply your power and then i realized that no he never he never allowed me actually seriously he didn't let me in hook all the time he was holding his pronator he was still controlling him this way but he didn't continue like this he continued like this way no no no no he continued this way
SPEAKER_03: a hook he still was going with the pronator yes yes yes but just his pronator is extremely good extremely solid
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but you didn't lose your wrist. Still, your wrist was bad. Still, you couldn't control his pronator. I would lose my wrist, just I didn't drop it. But if I went full power, I would lose my wrist. Just I was giving my center to protect my wrist. Wow, from outside, it looked like a deep hook, you know, one on the round. One on the round, I think fifth round or something, yeah, or sixth.
SPEAKER_03: maybe exactly there i felt that he was like a little bit i felt that i could win that round but i dropped because because whenever he went to move your arm opened quickly he didn't feel like you resisted a lot you know there but you know better how you felt i'm just saying what i saw from outside of course i felt that with trap in hook i could win that match but uh
SPEAKER_01: the the hard thing with walleting is to go in hook so i don't think that anyone on this earth can hook that guy in a fresh match i don't think i don't think anyone the best best guy in a hooking ability is probably matushenko i think that even matushenko i think as well now he would lift matushenko's elbow from the bed not anymore yeah before it was possible not anymore and and what do you think about yanis like what do you guys like okay
SPEAKER_03: What is your top five right now? Okay, let's finish this way. I haven't thought about this. Okay, Krasimir can start. Okay, I will say Levan, Valetin, Dave Chaffee. This is top three and after that gets hard. Do you think that Kurdesha cannot topple Dave Chaffee?
SPEAKER_03: I don't know. I cannot say. And don't you think that Michael can beat him? Dave lost against Michael Todd? I don't care about the wins of Michael Todd. You only see fight when it goes arm against arm. Yes. I love Krasimir. Back in the day, Michael Todd was a great puller. He was pulling inside, dead wrist. He was a great puller.
SPEAKER_03: very well around it the last several years what he is doing this is not arm wrestling for me back in the day he was extremely good and extremely extremely nice to watch it was very nice to watch him but now i don't like to watch that guy yeah when you said last several years probably talking about last 10 years yes yes yes and and and then okay you came to top three and then
SPEAKER_01: i don't know after that who would you bet between devon and kurdesha and i would say good yeah and janice i'm uh like about leon and vitale could could i could say same like first and two but uh
SPEAKER_02: after after that it's uh so tough like like like like we talked before like uh you you take uh you take mike uh todd hutchings against uh rustam babaev or rustam against zolu and one could be one another could be another one it's sometimes uh like we we know that there are some armors who could do good against michael todd and also we know there are masters which
SPEAKER_02: probably are super strong but they could struggle against michael and that's the same story about yeah alex is definitely for me somewhere in top five as well i i see alex's uh super potential and and uh that fight of course uh when last last time uh and alex rossi won but still uh i believe alex is uh guys and get stronger
SPEAKER_02: You're putting Alex fourth, but you forgot who beat Alex last time. That's a good thing, that you won against Alex and it's possible. But also I believe Alex is getting stronger and stronger and he's not so long in his fourth. He has huge potential. Krasimir used to beat Lewand, Krasimir used to beat Zlatin. But the guys are just like big frame when they reach their full potential.
SPEAKER_01: They are just becoming different, but I mean, almost all the superhero ways, you know, while they're going to their prime, we beat them, you know, exactly. Yeah. These guys are reaching their potential. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Through you, through you, you know. If you want to become one of the best, you know, before you go there, you need to lose to Krasimir. Krasimir beat you, and then he says, okay, I'm the gatekeeper, and then now you can become, you know, he beat them, yeah, Krasimir. Yeah, okay, guys. I mean, if it was up to me, you know, I would just, like, keep you in prison here, you know, for like 10 hours for arm wrestling, and especially when I find this
SPEAKER_01: very knowledgeable guys i mean i love it and but thank you very much as you see crossing crossing i i kept my uh promise i said one hour and it's one and a half hour and yeah you should pray that you know you didn't get any worse than this one you're lucky thank you thank you janice and hope to see you guys uh next month in istanbul yeah yeah we will keep in touch privately okay
SPEAKER_01: Okay. Take care. Take care. Thank you very much. Bye-bye.
