SPEAKER_00: maybe maybe actually do you know there are guys who are willing to put twenty five hundred dollars to beat me and invite me to the states some guys hate me that much who i won't take him take his name i won't give him any publicity i think we are live yeah it looks like that yes so
SPEAKER_04: Yes, live, definitely. Yeah. You're muted, Engin. Engin, you're muted. You hear me now? Yes. Yeah, it's good. Yeah. So how are you, Pradeep?
SPEAKER_00: i'm doing fine and thank you for inviting me so actually a pleasure to be able to talk with people and if sandres also joins all three of you are someone who can do it on the table and on youtube as well so you can do both things really big pleasure to be talking with you yeah you are you are one of the person that not really a high level arm master but understand from our messaging very well and it's always good to uh have you
SPEAKER_03: On our program and chance, how are you you getting ready for sundries everyone is thinking you are underdog you don't have chance and.
SPEAKER_03: You know that that is for me I don't know about how it affects you some people likes to be like favorites you understand, even on the poll. And then they get upset, you know why why you don't work for me, you know i'm going to be for me i'm not going to please don't work for me, please yeah. yeah I want you, I have like five votes and my opponent day 120 was is the best thing for me and.
SPEAKER_01: How do you feel about this? I agree. I love going into matches as the underdog. I kind of always have been that way. And it takes a lot of stress off your shoulders. If only five people expect you to win and you don't win, it's no big deal. But if you show up and you beat the opponent that's supposed to stomp you, the world is wild. So I'm really excited. And I'm prepared. I'm probably going to be the most prepared I've ever been for any match. So that's
SPEAKER_03: really exciting for me to be able to test what that level of me is capable of doing at a world level against someone like Sandris. I understand. Yeah. Yep. Yes. I was asked already. I want to know about your upcoming match. Please talk about my upcoming match. Supposed to be I versus Jumbo Zink, but
SPEAKER_03: Let's see how it will be, you know, because I don't know how ready I can be till that time. I just don't know. Um, like my bicep is healing up. I will pull and see it's going to be Norway. And right now I am still in a sleeping mode. You know, I don't want to wake up before, before. Okay. Sandris's came before the Istanbul event. I'm going to organize because both are, both are very stressful.
SPEAKER_03: And I can't really handle both of them at the same time. Hello, Sandris. Welcome. How are you? You hear us, Sandris? It says he's still connecting to the audio. Yeah, I saw that. You're muted, Sandris. And now?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, there you go. Better? Yeah. Great. Hi, Sandris. Hi, Pradeep. You guys know each other, right? Yeah, I've seen both of them. Yeah. Pradeep says that he is so sure that you like him very much. No, I have no problem with him.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I know. I know. Yeah. We were talking about how favorite you are and how underdog a chance is, you know, for the upcoming match that people believes that you are, uh, gonna be the winner and chances that it takes a lot of stress away from him, uh, for people to think that, you know, you're gonna win, um, and that he's gonna lose. And he says that,
SPEAKER_02: it is good that you know he has nothing to lose but a lot to gain and what do you think about this uh yeah i mean of course uh before that uh also on a race channel everyone was commenting in the chat that you know show versus me would be a good match and i kind of agree with that and
SPEAKER_02: I don't know. Now when it's happening, maybe some opinions have shifted a little bit, but I still think it's going to be a good match. And whoever wins, you know, there's nothing to lose, basically. So you can only gain from this, you know, with the exposure and stuff like that. And I'm pretty sure we're going to make it a good match anyway. I think after your performance at WAF,
SPEAKER_03: people started to rank you even more higher. You know, you won the Europeans, but there was an absence of the Russians, Georgians, Kazakhs in this. But when all were present, you still took second and third at WAF. And probably that is why people think very highly about you. Maybe you said that some people change their mind.
SPEAKER_03: maybe that could be the reason that's what I'm thinking. Do you believe that, like, okay, we can be so respectful, we can just like, you know, pretend to be something, you know, just like, oh, I respect him, you know, this and that. But like, honestly, if you talk, like, do you believe that you can beat Chance in and out both ways? Like you can hook him and beat him and topple him and beat him, just honest opinion, nothing to disrespect.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I think I can beat him. I believe I'm more versatile and I can go every lane, outside, inside, press. Do it pretty quickly as well if I'm feeling good. If my hand control is there and I'm well rested, I think I can win, obviously. Yeah, being versatile is something, but being versatile and then...
SPEAKER_03: applying being able to apply sometimes the different question you know like you can be a good hook you top roll but just because you have this it doesn't mean that you are strong enough to uh apply them when you want you know so that's what i am asking like just just imagine that this is best of five so you need three wins and then if you are three zero or something whenever you reach three you don't pull the other rounds if it is not like two two or something or two one
SPEAKER_03: So what I'm just saying that, like, you just say that you topple him. Second round, would you go to hook with him? Just try to beat him there, or you would just secure your way and then just win? If first round I topple him, then second I would go and hook, yeah, probably. See, this way, this is what I try to understand it.
SPEAKER_03: looks like you are the hunter looking hunter in this this competition while uh you may give uh this kind of options to yourself i am sure that chance is only focusing on winning in whatever the best way for him correct absolutely yeah absolutely
SPEAKER_01: the one is the only thing that matters for me yeah yeah yeah i don't i don't need to prove that i can uh hook and top roll and press and uh i i think at the end of the day none of that really matters the only thing that's going to matter is who comes out with the with the victory so yes i agree i agree so that that sorry but that also puts him in a position that you know even to think about these things uh
SPEAKER_03: shows that you know he also sees himself a heavily favorite this is what i'm saying thinking while you are seeing yourself that you know you will find one perfect way and beat him this is what i'm thinking yeah i mean he should he should be the favorite i should be the underdog i've never placed at a waf event or eaf or
SPEAKER_03: uh zloty tur or anything like that so he definitely has the the credibility and i'm someone who's who's still coming up so um it's it's up to me to prove that i can hang with the big dogs like sandras see when we when we saw you against uh john um i think that with that that you know john it was like the beginning where the beginning of the john's return and um
SPEAKER_03: So what i'm just thinking, in my opinion, with the performance with the shape that you paste john I think may not be enough for sundries. i'm not saying the Sunday is stronger than john but Sunday is, in my opinion, possibly stronger than that shape or john which was the very beginning, so do you think that you put some on it, since that day, like since.
SPEAKER_01: the way the day that you pulled John, like till February 12th, do you think you will be about like 10% stronger or more? Um, it's, it's hard to know an exact percent, uh, but that was in July and we're talking about February. So I have what, seven months of training after a loss. If you, if you look at, at me, my career in arm wrestling, anytime I take a loss,
SPEAKER_01: I end up taking a bunch of wins directly after. I really don't like losing. I mean, none of us like losing, I'm sure. But when I take a loss, I put my head down and I train hard. So I've been less active on social medias. I've been more active in the gym. I've been more active in the pulleys and with my training partners. And so 10%, I don't know, 10%, maybe 5%, maybe 20%. It's hard to know, but I'm definitely coming in stronger. And I think at the time I pulled John, I was my strongest up until that point.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, it was, it was the, the shape that you pull against John was your strongest till that time. Yes. Yes. And now you are even, uh, stronger. So when you pull John, you were even in a better shape than the time that you beat all the other guys, Yordan seals done under woods. And yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. I understand. How, how tall are you chance? I'm six foot six. And Sundays, are you like one 90 or something?
SPEAKER_03: i'm six four so why not so six four is about like 193 or 94 93 something like that 93 94 yeah so you are about yeah about 10 centimeters taller than yeah a little bit bigger yeah yeah and how is your preparation and you are going to pull it arm wars two weeks before before your match with sundries right i say with chance yeah that's correct yes yeah yeah
SPEAKER_02: And is it battleground or one-on-one supermatch? It is one-on-one, six or five rounds as well. The guy from Ireland, right, you said? Yeah, Adrian O'Dwyer, yes. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And it's right arm? Right arm, yeah. It's pretty interesting because we were both in Zlody in the same class the year I won, so I think he placed something like eighth or tenth, so it will be interesting to see.
SPEAKER_03: And this was the time that you won the Zloty? Yes, yeah. For 2018, was it? 18, yes. You won the 105kg category. Yeah, we were in the same class. Yeah, yeah. And which place did you win? 8th or 10th, I think. Something like that. At that time, you beat him easy? We didn't pull that time. Oh, you didn't meet each other? Oh, okay. I didn't meet, yeah. I understand.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah. And how is your shape since WAF to now? Like, did you quit training for some time just to rehabilitation or? Yeah, after Europe, probably took like, there wasn't really time to take off because after two or three weeks, it was world. So I kind of went light with the weights and then in training.
SPEAKER_02: on a table as well. And, uh, after worlds, I took basically all the holidays off two or three weeks. I took off, maybe went to gym, did some, uh, general stuff, uh, very, very light as well. Not nothing specific. And, uh, actually just now I got back from, uh, from training and, uh, yesterday I started preparing, uh, and today was my second training. So.
SPEAKER_02: shape it's it's too soon to tell feeling a little bit sluggish after all the eating i did in holidays and it's it's pretty hard the moment but after a week or so it should get better and it should get to the to a point where i don't feel like passing out in training actually so so your your your uh arm wars on what 28 29 when is it
SPEAKER_03: yeah something like that 28 i think and then you have only like what three and a half weeks right yeah yeah and then and how long are you going to rest before the armors probably a week maybe something like that yeah a week and then you have two weeks later after the armors you will have the chance match and between that two weeks you're gonna just do like some light blood pumps yeah yeah probably
SPEAKER_02: depends how i feel but uh definitely nothing too heavy yeah oh yeah but from now to the armors are you going to train uh heavy no yeah yeah pretty heavy first two weeks today heavy did you train heavy today no today i did like shoulders a little bit so yesterday was heavy heavy and tomorrow is going to be heavy as well so i understand yeah so so what i what i'm just curious that
SPEAKER_02: Like, will you reach to your top numbers before arm wars or not? Or no need? I will try to. First two weeks I will do a lot of volume and last week I will try to hit some numbers if I can. So I don't know how close I will get to my best numbers, but sometimes numbers doesn't really speak the truth.
SPEAKER_02: yeah so it all depends how how you feel physically you know is there any minor pain or injury and usually if my if my wrist feels solid everything's feel good feel good then i can perform as well so yeah and sometimes you know when you go to gym just because like you train with 70 it doesn't mean that
SPEAKER_03: you cannot train 100%. It is just like you don't choose to, you know. Yeah, it's just not necessary all the time. You just don't push yourself, you know. But anytime you want, you can do it. You just don't risk yourself. If there is a tournament very near or supermatch very near, this is what I believe. Yeah, it's also not necessary to push yourself every day to the max. So, obviously, you need to take and be
SPEAKER_03: precautious in some way yeah i agree i agree yeah and and your uh numbers change like you said that you are now your numbers lifting numbers are getting uh heavier yeah yeah so every single lift is is getting heavier whether it's general gym training or cable work that i've been doing everything is
SPEAKER_01: Uh, whether it's, you know, 10 pounds heavier or 40 pounds heavier, I've seen, I've seen big increases on certain things that I wasn't training before and, uh, smaller increases on things that I've been training constantly. Um, but my rep ranges has gone up. So if I could have done one amount of weight for maybe two or three reps, now I can do it for six to eight reps. So my muscle endurance is definitely improving as well, which is something, uh, I figured I'd have to bring to the table against Sandris.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So you, of course, some things are just private, but like you just, we know the way that you are pulling. And my question to you is that after this, you know, there's one super chat I will read, maybe I'll read already. Thank you, Roger, for the super chat. It says mustache looks good chance. Yep. Thank you. Thank you, Roger. God, Lord. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: my question is uh like just maybe unnecessary even to ask but where do you see uh sundries beating you cooking and beating you or toppling you beating you just but probably you wouldn't want to say that yeah you know it's hard to know until i until i grip up with him um you never analyze him you never analyze you didn't do
SPEAKER_01: I've analyzed, I've analyzed them. I've watched all his matches multiple times. Of course, you know, I, I do my research just as I'm sure he has as well. Um,
SPEAKER_01: it's just hard to know how his wrist is going to hold because that seems to be his weak point. So if his wrist doesn't hold, I think he's going to try to end up in a pressing motion and we'll just see if he's strong enough to press through my arm. If his wrist holds and he's able to stay in the top roll position, we'll see if my wrist is able to hold up. So I think
SPEAKER_03: don't know where he would be able to beat me hopefully nowhere but if somewhere i think it would be um i'll beat him because his wrist fails or he'll beat me because my wrist fails or he's able to on my uh through my pronator and put me on my bicep yeah i don't i don't think that he can beat you with a dead wrist i really don't think but i say this not because i know a lot but this is because of you know even jerry in a practice will of course was struggling to beat you that way
SPEAKER_03: I don't think it is so easy to beat you that way, but who knows? We will see. And Pradeep, what are your opinions about this matchup?
SPEAKER_00: first i would like to ask both guests some questions and i'll start with sandra so you already asked about his height six four i want to ask your age and how much you are weighing because every time sandra i've heard anyone talk about you who have personally met you they always say that sandra is one of the biggest guys that they have ever seen and like do you have to cut a lot of weight to get to 110 kilos in wef what is your like walk around weight everyday weight so
SPEAKER_02: My walk-around weight is usually like 110, 112 kilos. In the past, I was 107, 108, a little bit lighter. So I didn't have to cut a lot when I compete in WAF. When I competed in Zloty, obviously 105. So I did cut like four kilos maybe. But now I'm getting a little bit bigger as well. So I'm up to 112 kilos and
SPEAKER_02: Just after the holidays, I did some weighing and I was 116. So a little bit, that eating got to me a little bit. And yeah, 112, 114, maybe something like that. Yeah, so Changshu, I believe he may outweigh you in this match, but still you are the guy with the bigger frame. And what about your age? How old are you? I'm 27 at the moment, so.
SPEAKER_00: also you know about four years older than chance shows of you both have almost the same level of ability to progress just because of the age and the maturity that comes with that and about you chance show so my question for you is that have you ever pulled under strict rules so as i said you are 23 years old i guess and you have been competing for around seven years i would assume yep so
SPEAKER_01: Have you ever competed under strict rules? Because in past seven years, I don't think there were any tournaments with very strict rules in United States. So I competed in WAF in 2017, 16, whenever it was in Bulgaria. I did compete there. So I have competed under strict rules. But besides that, I mean, US rules are kind of sloppy, as everyone knows. That's kind of our style of arm wrestling. It's what we enjoy. But
SPEAKER_01: When I was at the WAF, I never had any issues with fouling out. I filed once I think in all of my matches and in the US I don't really foul typically.
SPEAKER_00: yeah so this is why i was asking maybe it can be difficult for you because you have adapted to u.s rules so going over there for after five years nearly it can be difficult and my opinion again you are asking me just like everyone else i think sandras should be the heavy favorite going in this match because chan show i believe will mainly depend on his top role and sandras can go everywhere if he gets tired in one position he can maybe even switch mid match so i think sandras
SPEAKER_00: can take this match. No offense, Chance. No, none taken. Just buy someone else's ticket. Not that sure. Not that much sure. Can you check the chat if there is anything racism is going on there? Yeah, some guy was telling me that why is an Indian allowed in this conversation? I don't mind it. No problem.
SPEAKER_03: Hmm. Okay. Just follow the guy. If he goes anything, like, I don't know who he is. I didn't even see the comment. If he goes that way about racism, then just, just, uh, block him, you know, from the page, please. Yeah. I'm monitoring the chat. Um, yeah, that, that, that will be, that will be interesting and okay. But honestly, you know, not because you are not honest, but you may want to be humble or something. What do you give percentage to yourself and your opponents?
SPEAKER_03: you know, before this program, I was thinking that there would be more, more, more, more, more challenge going on each other. And yeah, it was like way too nice already, way too nice, but it's okay. What can I say? What's your chance versus Sandris's chance? On paper, I would say Sandris has to be the favorite by maybe 70% to 30%.
SPEAKER_01: But I think that it may be flip-flopped. I think Sandris's taking a match two weeks before is going to hurt. No matter if it's an easy match or a difficult match, two weeks before, because arm wars is all six rounds. So six rounds of ready goes, fouls, false starts, that's a lot of pressure on his arm. So I think that's going to play negatively.
SPEAKER_01: Sandris is also giving up a bit of weight and he's the one under the stress. He, he kind of has to win, um, to, to, uh, back up the Europeans opinion that I'm going to get killed. So, um, I think for a lot of factors, even though on paper, Sandris is the favorite, I give myself probably a 60 to 70% chance of winning. So you are giving him the more chance.
SPEAKER_03: No, no, no. I said on paper it would be, but in reality, in my opinion, I believe I'm coming in 60 to 70% possibility of winning. So you are winning 60 to 70%. That's good. Yeah. That is how you should come. Never, never, never accept, you know, just go there. And if anyone is thinking differently, just let them prove, you know, that nothing is easy. In mind, you're going to believe. And like how John went to Dubai, you know,
SPEAKER_03: john had to believe people says hey even john said he was the best ever shape you know john has to say they had to say that and he had to believe that way but we all know the truth you know yeah and sunday's what what is your opinion about 90 90 90 yeah yes yeah that is what i was yeah expecting to say i was even expecting 100 from you
SPEAKER_03: You got to leave some percentage, you know, never, never know what happens. Yeah. I'm always worried to go too high of percentages because then someone's going to make a delusional Ryan Bowen video about me. So I don't want to be that guy. Listen, listen, if you just make, I mean, it's not about, I'm not talking about Ryan. I also respect him as well, you know, but just we can't really, if you would make a video every day, you're going to do this, you're going to do that, you're going to do that. I'm not talking about Ryan.
SPEAKER_03: And then I understand. But whenever somebody is asking you, I mean, you have to believe, I mean, if you don't believe you're going to win, why would you accept to pull a match? You know, I understand. Yeah. I'm definitely not flying halfway across the world to lose. I mean, I believe John's favorite against me, but everybody knows that I'm not even overweight. I'm not even a middleweight. Trust me. Like fat free. I'm like maximum 170 pound guy, you know, like just say 78 kilo guy, you know?
SPEAKER_03: this this guy i mean like we know it but this match has to happen not because of any ranking because of anything proven but this is something like two guys you know from the past you know just like a classic match you know so it's just different so you you really need to believe and and the other matches uh i would like to ask your opinions and and i'm sure sandras is gonna say that east is going to destroy west but you know is it the same for every match or is there any match that you think
SPEAKER_02: Wes is going to win, Sandris. I don't remember all the matches. I remind you. Tatakis versus Yordan Sonner. Which arm are they pulling, right? Right, of course. I wouldn't be in my Tatakis. Of course, yeah. This one, I think, might go west side way. So, I think Todd might win, yes. Yeah. Especially the right arm.
SPEAKER_03: You don't see anyone beating, anyone who is not a flash pinner, beating Tata Shin inside in a slow, most likely slow start. Endurance game. For yourself, if you just start in a hook in a slow match with Tata Shin, do you see yourself winning? I don't know. Probably not. Probably not. Yeah, I understand. So you are saying that Tata is the favorite one, that one.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I think well-prepared Todd is a whole different monster and can be very dangerous. Yeah, his joints. Yeah, elbow joint is really scary, you know, really scary. I don't know. We'll see with his match with Lachlan how it goes. So then we'll be able to assess a little bit more. And then let's see what happens. And what do you think about John versus Haji? The one question before this.
SPEAKER_03: Everyone says that, you know, John is like 57 older. Yeah, I accept that all. But is Haji, did he look to you in a super shape? I'm sure he will be in a super shape in February. But did he look to you in a super shape or you look a little bit, you know, elbow issues, you know, a little bit in the wall? He's yeah, he's looking last few years. He's looking a little bit sloppy, I would say.
SPEAKER_02: Also, in his match with Todd, he didn't look that dominant as I would expect. And I don't know in what shape will John bring to the table, but I think this might be also one close match, maybe. Close match. But where do you see the matches going?
SPEAKER_03: Do you see Zoloev is like without the strap for sure, Zoloev is going to beat John without like letting him sleep as he did to Tarkacic. But in my opinion, John will be better about sleeping because I mean, he has been doing this for like forever, you know, to even from Voivoda and many others, you know, even when he loses in the strap, but he was like pronated and went to sleep. I think John will be able to do that.
SPEAKER_03: but once it is in strap and then if both goes outside, like for me, I can't, I don't see how he is just like top rolling and beating John. How'd you may go this way, but at the same time, John also will go that way. So they will be like in a flat risk position. And John is more experienced about like, he was almost beating Devon in the round one. He didn't have risk control, but still was, of course it's not going to be the same John because he will be lighter, but still,
SPEAKER_02: I mean, he will not have Devon against him. And so, but do you see, how do you see Oleg winning? Outside of strap, strap outside or strap inside? I think it probably will go to strap. And if it does, then it might be some kind of a slow pull, as you said, where both athletes have their wrist
SPEAKER_03: basically straight and I think if Hadji gets a little bit more hand control, he's able to push through to the side. Did you see their match on A1 in 2015 when both tried to go outside? Maybe, but I don't remember. It was way too easy for John. I'm not saying it's the same Zola, it's not the same John, but it was way too easy.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but let's see. And what do you think, Chance, about that match and the Takashi's match? So John and Haji, I would say I only see John losing if Haji controls John's hand outside of the straps and is able to control him there. I don't think that Haji is strong enough to pin John inside of the straps. I could be wrong, obviously. I've never arm wrestled him.
SPEAKER_01: I'm going a little bit off of the 2015 match and the fact that John has been progressing and getting stronger with each match. But I'm going to say John 3-0. I'm never going to root against John. But when you say like you are never going to do that, it sounds like more like a country sport, you know. Was it an objective opinion or is it because of what you think? No, no, no, no. It's not a country thing. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Uh, again, like I said, a bit of that is based off of, uh, the 2015 match. Uh, a bit of that is based off of, I don't know how strong Haji is in comparison to someone like Dimitri Kachan, um, who's also pulling outside style. Um, you know, I, I don't have, have they ever pulled Dimitri Kachan and, uh, Haji? No, but Dimitri was second place too.
SPEAKER_03: I think crossing in 2015 Europeans in a hundred kg, he had a very good top of, but I think he is now at two 40 imagery. Uh, like two 35. Yeah. I think, I think that, I mean, in my opinion, Dimitri would be Zola. I don't see Zola who can him. I really don't see. Yeah. So if, if that's the fact and that's kind of what I thought then, then, um,
SPEAKER_03: I don't see John losing to Zoloev or Haji if he didn't lose to Dimitri. So that's kind of... Yeah, but Pradeep is thinking that, you know, Zoloev is going to hook John and beat him. Right, Pradeep? Am I mistaking this, what you said? I mean, it's possible, maybe. We don't hear you. Do you hear Pradeep? I don't hear Pradeep. Yeah, like I said previously also, the only way I see Haji beating, and I actually see him beating John,
SPEAKER_00: in this match is in a hook but there are only two points of consideration or kind of worry if someone wants to to see zolo in this match is number one about the 2015 match second round we are not sure if john actually allowed hadzi to get in a hook or did he force a hook on him like if he was able to force a hook on him but john was able to still flatten his wrist and pin him to the side but if that hook was forced and we also saw paul lin force a hook on john brzing in round two
SPEAKER_00: And Hadzi Murat is like, I think if Pauline can do that under not so strict rules where you can load with a lot of back pressure, still Pauline was able to force a hook on John. I think under strict rules where you can only static load, not a lot of back pressure, I think Hadzi will be able to force the hook on John.
SPEAKER_00: And second point of concern that I was talking about is when we watched the match, Todd Hutchings versus Hadzi Muradzola, the second match, even when Hadzi was lighter about seven, eight years ago, nine years ago, when they faced first, still he gave kind of a good fight to Todd Hutchings in a hook. But in this match, it looked like it wasn't even close. So maybe if it is related to something injury related, or maybe he's not feeling inside, then it could be a point of concern for him.
SPEAKER_00: but i think if he's healthy if he's near his best shape that he has been in the past around 92 93 kilos which is i'm expecting him to show up at that weight i think under those strict rules he's going to be faster than john i and i think he can force the hook on john brissing outside if he tries to go outside i can see john taking his hand even if both
SPEAKER_00: of them their wrist goes back still john will have more side pressure than hudsey but under strict rules just mainly because of strict rules i think he will be able to force the hook just based on his speed what do you think about touching your solar tired hatching sources so i'm not as familiar with jordan as i should be um i i know that that he's very strong uh i've seen some of his matches i would i would love to to
SPEAKER_01: pull with some Bulgarians so I can have a better idea. My understanding of international arm wrestling is very limited to video. Has Yordan ever pulled with Hadzi? With Zoloev? Yordan. I don't think so. They are not in similar weight class. One was like
SPEAKER_01: No, they didn't. I don't remember. I think Todd Hutchings is very motivated after his loss in the last East vs. West. Obviously, he took the match with Corey West seriously. He beat a strong Corey West. Now he's pulling Lachlan.
SPEAKER_01: and then, of course, he goes into this match. I think if Todd Hutchings gets through Lachlan cleanly, even if it's wars but it's 3-0, then I would pick Todd Hutchings to win. If Lachlan is able to take one match off of Todd, then I think that Todd is coming in as an underdog against Yordan. And what is your opinion, Sandesh, about some other matches like...
SPEAKER_03: Gasparini versus Arif. I think you voted for Gasparini as far as I remember on the poll. Yeah, yeah, I think Gasparini will win. Yeah, you see him top rolling and winning, right? This is how you see. Yeah, I haven't seen Gasparini ever go in hook, so I think top roll, hand control and that's the way.
SPEAKER_03: yeah sometimes you know people don't go to a style just because they want but they they may be taken there that is why i said it not that he would choose it but but i'm just saying that or maybe like platform flat risk you know i i don't i don't pull hook but sometimes i was put in hook so i had to fight in hook that's what i mean how is how is arif's hook is it uh good i mean i can pull in very different ways in arif i don't think arab is gonna go hook but what i'm just saying
SPEAKER_03: I don't know how the match is going to go. Maybe Arif is going to top roll. Maybe he will go shoulder press. Maybe he will go side pressure. How did you see Arif at the WAF? Did you like his performance there? I didn't really see a lot of his matches, no. Yeah. I have to look at those. First round, he beat the guy Mitko that he had final in 2019 from Bulgaria. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: he was quick match and then then i think third match should be georgie shedko and the other guys that he beat i don't remember their name but all basically was the same style of pulling and very effective let's see how did he do against swedcov easy easy yeah side pressure very easy yeah interesting yeah yeah that was interesting because he's also strong back and what do you think about some
SPEAKER_03: other matches do you are you of course you are familiar because you you compete in what events what do you think about bet killy oniani versus uh oleg zog but bet killy is now 90 kilo just uh for your uh information did he did he compete against uh vlad in his class who let's kill him
SPEAKER_03: Betkili, in what class he did compete? No, Betkili didn't compete because Georgia didn't come too often. No, before, before. Oh, yeah, in the past, yeah, usually he was beating Vladislav in 75 kilo category, yeah. Yeah, I don't know. His teammates tells me that, like, when Betkili is losing 75, 80 kilo, and Betkili, because he's 190-something tall guy, and when Betkili is 90 kilo, they say, like, it's, like, totally different person, you know.
SPEAKER_02: I know it's definitely going to be an interesting match as well because you don't really hook Voh. It's not really possible. And also Devon struggled with it in the past. So I think Voh will win. I don't know. Yeah. I think that... After the event, you know, in 2018, Europeans, Bulgaria.
SPEAKER_03: Right after their final matches, Betkili was 75, Dzok was 85, and Betkili was just hooking and beating him, hooking and beating him in the strap at the side table. I'm not saying the side table… Yeah, but the practice ball, you know, it's one difference. But he was beating another guy, you know, I have seen him at side table, beating even maybe like Levan or something at the side table. You know, so what I'm just saying, the side table sometimes, you know, when the…
SPEAKER_03: Maybe it's Levan, it's a side table, or Ferit, it's a side table. People are like, oh, look at there, you know. But whenever, if Benkele beats him, then they don't say like, you know, like, oh, look at, oh, it's just side table. You know, of course, side table, side table. But sometimes I see this kind of double standard, you know. I don't, I don't know. Did you, you remember Bojidar and Zhokh at Europeans?
SPEAKER_03: you know, the hook-hook try of Bozidar. Bozidar has a short arm. Bozidar is probably maximum 175 guy, you know. Did you see that he hooked him? Not so much, but he was just right there and stopped him about like 20-25 seconds. Yeah, I think Oleg was just holding him and he kind of... Bozidar was with a flat wrist already. Yeah, but he couldn't go. This is what I saw.
SPEAKER_03: He was holding, but whenever he couldn't go, I saw that match, you know. I mean, whenever Zog wants, he beats the guy like this, you know. I mean, why was he holding 25 seconds before he goes? I don't know. We'll have to look at that match again. But I don't know. Maybe he wanted to feel things out, you know. Also, he's coming back, so I don't know. That was the only match that he chose, so.
SPEAKER_01: yeah wanted one wanted to show his dominant no i mean he didn't do his checking with other matches okay um and you you probably don't know who bad kid is right chance uh i i've watched uh some of his practice videos just because i saw he was pulling oleg so uh anyone that has a match with him i i have to be interested to see if they have any any shot at winning
SPEAKER_01: um and and i did see the practice footage from 2018 you were talking about on the side table which was you know very impressive of course it wasn't uh it wasn't starting straight there's a little bit of a carve before they go and things like that but um practice table doesn't mean everything but i think it does mean some things
SPEAKER_01: even if you're pinning someone on the practice table, it shows that you're at least somewhat strong enough to make them work. Because if you pull against someone who you're much stronger than, they're never going to pin you, even if it's on the side table. Yeah, I was just saying, I'm actually really interested to see if McKinley can beat Oleg. I think it'll be a closer match than a lot of people think it will be. I still favor Oleg, though.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah. Yeah. Imagine this way, you know, uh, uh, rest. So they can is maximum what, like 173 height. What do you think Sandris is short guy, you know, he's not, he's not told that, you know, and right. Like five, eight or something. Yeah. It was like five, eight. Yeah. Yeah. Five, eight. Yeah. And see for a five, eight guy to make one 65, 75 kilo is fine. You understand?
SPEAKER_03: But this guy, 190 is about 63. He is 63. And he's making 165. And they made 165. And they had probably the best ever matches in the WAF history in 2018. And they had three matches. And like minutes long. Minutes long. He and Rez. And just imagine this guy, 165. And here he will be 198. Do you understand? Okay. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: at rest it's good weight class for rest 165 and he from 63 guy is normally 200 pound guy going to 165 and head to head with he even beaten once lost twice i think beat once with pals or i don't remember exactly because um i made 143s and like i mean like i was just hardly breathing you know but i remember they pulling uh so imagine this guy had to head at 165
SPEAKER_03: and he's near 200 pounds versus, so how effective he can be. That is what I am thinking, but let's see how it will be.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, and do you know this guy, Bath Killy, Pradeep? Probably you didn't know, but probably you search later when you see the match. Yeah, I am also, like I don't have enough knowledge to comment on that, but only based on what you told me in the last interview, that you told me that both were kind of fresh. They won their classes easily before that 2018 Aftapul, where we saw Oleg Zhokh against Bath Killy and after that against Levan also probably.
SPEAKER_00: So if both were fresh and I know it is a practice pool, but still that practice pool kind of showed enough that if the match goes in a hook, but Kelly may beat Oleg Zhokh, because like it, it did not look close inside the hook. But again, like chance said, they were not starting with a straight race because that also matters a lot. If Oleg Zhokh is even able to maintain a flat hand against him, I think he's going to win. But if it goes in a hook.
SPEAKER_00: I think that Kelly will win, but I have, don't have enough information about that to comment that what I think can happen in a whole core top role. I think it will depend on that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And the, what do you guys think about the, uh, Evan versus school boy, any, any, any, any chance for Evan or no, it's a, I think it's definitely an interesting match, uh, that, that you set up. Um,
SPEAKER_01: I just hope that Evan comes in and in a really, really strong shape, much stronger than he pulled Ryan Bowen and the bottom eight, because if he shows up in a similar shape, I think that he has zero percent chance. But I spoke with Evan a little bit. I know that he's taking the match very serious and he's training the most serious he has for a match. And so it'll be interesting to see. I think if it was on the on the left side, it would be a little closer. But being on the right side, it's still
SPEAKER_03: even though even though i know evan's taking it extremely serious i still give him maybe 20 chance to to win one match only one match huh yeah yeah he knows that he knows that this match is uh something that can make him very famous win or lose it already has made him more famous yeah yeah but whenever you win you know it is kind of a little bit different than you know losing you know of course what do you think sandras
SPEAKER_02: I haven't seen a lot of Evan pulling, but I don't think that with the top roll, I think Skullboy is a huge favorite. And maybe one lane where Evan can beat him is in a hook. I don't know how his hook is holding up, but in a Vav, it looked a weak point of Alex. And yeah, I think
SPEAKER_02: Top roll, Alex wins. If he can get into the hook with Alex, then maybe there's a chance. He can take a round or two, maybe. I understand. And what are your opinion about Michael Todd versus Genadi? Chance? Yeah. Oh.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, like we talked about before when we spoke maybe a week ago, and like you've said many times, both guys are coming off of a loss and neither guy can afford a loss because they're both trying to solidify themselves as one of the top athletes in arm wrestling. And whoever loses, I think, is going to start to get overlooked a bit.
SPEAKER_01: Especially if Michael loses, if Michael loses twice in a row, I think he has more to lose than Genadi does. I have to root for Michael based off of practice videos is really all I have to base it off of. But when Michael is pulling through like Ron Bath very easily and Corey West very easily, and he's looking the strongest and biggest that I've seen him since I've been in arm wrestling.
SPEAKER_01: It gives me some hope. I know Michael hates losing. If Michael shows up anywhere close to the shape that he showed up to pull Devin, I think that he'll get steamrolled. But I am going to favor Michael here slightly, not too much, maybe 55% or 60%. And Sandris? I agree. I agree as well. Bath guys are coming off...
SPEAKER_02: pretty tough losses and both guys need the win. And with Genadi, it's pretty hard to predict lately. He doesn't look that convincingly as well to me. And it's the matter of does his wrist can hold up against Michael? And I think he will take Michael's wrist, but is he able to finish Michael? That's the question.
SPEAKER_02: With Michael, I really don't see how can he not go into the Kings Bowl, you know, because that's, I think, the only way he can go. And it's a matter of finishing. I would give a slight edge to Genadi, though. How do you, what do you think about that? You know, you mean open arm top rule or you mean desperation move?
SPEAKER_03: No, no, no, seriously, because what you mean by saying that because it's Waff rules, the shoulder can't go below table. Yeah, yeah, open arm top roll. Open arm top roll, he's doing it already, you know, he was doing it. In fact, he's not doing desperation move for some years already. No, no, open arm top roll, yeah, something like that. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. So you are giving the edge to Genadi.
SPEAKER_03: You know, normally I'm going to rep some of the matches, but that match, I'm not going to rep. I'm not going to be. It'll be a nightmare. I'm not going to be even close to the table, you know, just like too much horsepower. Just let me go a little bit back and watch from there, you know? Yeah. And some other referee to deal with it. And there is one guy. You see that Super Chat?
SPEAKER_03: there's nothing written there right yeah darko he just sent a swedish currency 50 nothing no message okay thank you for the if i can call super and and other matches probably i don't know do you follow the ladies are missing chance uh i i do to uh to a certain degree because i do uh north american rankings so i have to stay you have any idea about rebecca from slovakia i think i don't it should not just be uh
SPEAKER_03: Gladcare in the final should be Gladcare, right? In 65 kilo final. I think so, yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think in this step, yeah. Yeah, and FIA. So if you don't know Rebeka, probably you can't really give your opinion. What do you think about it? I asked Sarah about the match because Sarah lives local. Sarah Backman. She said that
SPEAKER_01: Rebeka is underrated as a female arm wrestler. And I think she said, at least in the Western part of the world, that maybe everyone knows Fia and they don't know Rebeka, but it's probably favorited to Rebeka. So I have to believe her opinion. She said what? Fia is favorite or Rebeka is favorite? Oh, Rebeka maybe is the favorite, even though, of course, she'll root for Fia. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. And Sade, what's your opinion? Is there a weight limit?
SPEAKER_02: 70 kilo. One is 65 kilo world champion. The other one is 70 kilo currently. And then they will be in the 70s. So Rebeka will be heavier. Fia will be in the same weight. I think this position favors Fia more because if you need to go up the weight, usually what happens is, you know, the angles just doesn't feel right.
SPEAKER_03: And you need to get used to it with some time. I think Fia is a favorite in this one. Did you know that Rebeka, in 2019, right before the pandemic, pulled 80 kilos off? No, no. Yeah, she was in 80 kilos. And she gave some trouble to those girls, you know, like Gabriela and other girls. Yeah, some trouble. Interesting, interesting. Yeah, some. Not so much, but still, it wasn't like walking in the park, you know.
SPEAKER_02: so i think that's all like stranger to do heavier categories yeah no no but i i think fia will be not huge favorite but maybe maybe 60 percent yeah 60.
SPEAKER_00: And Pradeep, do you have any opinion about this? No, not really, but just, just, and I was thinking that it is a 65 kg Wraith champion versus 70 kg Wraith champion, but you told that she was competing even 80 kilos before that. So maybe the weight won't make much of a difference in this match and she can easily get to 70 kilos. So the weight won't really matter. Well, almost impossible to comment that. Like I've seen Fia Isay compete a lot. If it were with a familiar, familiar opponent, like
SPEAKER_03: malin clientsmith or someone like that then i could have made some predictions or opinions but no i don't really have anything to say about this i understand yeah and and sandys what do you think about efe and rambet left arm how is fs right arm doing right arm it's not like broken is anything like uh he can't do anything with uh pronation
SPEAKER_03: think there is something some some problem but it is not like any any like like it is not broken it's not like i mean i think he can compete this year his right arm but but not maybe some some tendon injury or something like that yeah he said that you know i told him that you know sandras came to me and he said it was broken and it felt like it felt like that i don't know yeah efe told me that
SPEAKER_03: you know he said like if you would hear the sound you would also think that it was broken he told me yeah and there was a very loud pop yeah yeah this is exactly what he told me yeah yeah and i i was so serious um so like i mean i don't know i i really thought that it was broken after you you told me i really thought but i'm glad that it's not yeah do you know why because he was hooked and it was already pinned
SPEAKER_03: referee there were two pins actually before yeah from outside whenever he was coming to the inside and that like before he locked himself you hit him again so i think in that that point he he got injured you know this is what i'm thinking yeah but uh how's he can he train can he you know pull something right now he said that he can do some bicep or something but nothing about the
SPEAKER_03: he cannot pull and he cannot uh train pronated that's what he told me but i'm just thinking how how will it be for him to hold on with the right arm he's not gonna pull right on he will hold on onto the table oh no no he can he can he can there's no problem yeah yeah especially we have more than one month by the time that you know uh istanbul event there will be almost two and a half months you know from
SPEAKER_03: I mean, even if it was broken, it would still hold the peg, you know. Yeah. That's not the thing, you know. Don't worry about it. Yeah, I don't know. I don't know. It's hard to predict. I think maybe, maybe Efe. Yeah. I don't see Ron Kapral in Efe, but I may be wrong. Yeah. You remember, you tried to take his hand with the left arm.
SPEAKER_03: His fingers felt strong, right? Yeah, yeah. His wrist felt very solid. Yeah. And then you went inside. Yeah. Yeah. So if Ron has that ability, then it's possible. But if Ron doesn't have that really quick lightning, you know, hooking ability, then I don't know. I don't think Ron is the fastest arm slayer in the world. Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: It's not too slow, though. Yeah, yeah. Probably he was faster when he was younger, probably. We all are getting, I know, slower, you know. I also get slower. Still faster. So what do you think, Chance, you ever followed? Probably you followed Efe a lot, eh? Yeah, I was, of course. Because he was going to be your opponent, you know.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I think that F.A. should be a heavy favorite. Ron's left hasn't hasn't looked that that good to me as a spectator since his match with Jonathan Brita. It looks like he maybe injured himself or something like that, because then following that match, he had a match against Yordan Sill, who Yordan Sill was able to control Ron's hand and Ron didn't really have any chance.
SPEAKER_01: So I'm going to go with FA on this. Evgeny though I'll be in Ron's corner rooting for him, I wouldn't bet on Ron. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I understand. And what do you think about Zurab versus Jonathan? Jonathan said he's going to surprise everyone with left arm. What do you think about Jonathan's left arm, Chance? It's probably the best right now at 100 kilos in the United States. Oh, he's the best, you think, under 100 kilos?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, technically I think he's ranked second or third but I would, I would put him as the number one guy in my personal rankings. So, I think that he knows he's coming in as a huge underdog against a very talented opponent who's who's very strong, very technical and used to the rule set. So, I know how serious he's taking it I know what he's putting his body through so.
SPEAKER_03: You know, I think that he is going to surprise some people. I still have him as an underdog, though. Maybe Brita has a 30% chance or 40% chance at winning. Yeah, Zurab is normal. You know, the heaviest we saw him in Europe was 85 kilos, 187. So he is going to come to 22, 25. I think Brita will be the same. Yeah. Yeah. And I don't know.
SPEAKER_03: Yep. So also the right arm, Rambet, he's 112 kilos, he told me. And Zurab is about 100 kilos. What do you think, Sandris, about Rambet versus Zurab? Do you think that Zurab, you know, he's 100 kilos, but, you know, he's like maximum, what, 175? Something like that, right? Yeah. So he's like really, really, like, not his weight class, but he's just like, but still, you know, it gives a lot of power to be that heavy. Yeah, he's been really pushing it, and...
SPEAKER_02: I've seen some pictures of him and he's looking just huge. And he hasn't competed in a long time. So I think that can play some kind of a role in this match. And I would put Zurab as a slight favorite, but I don't know if Ron comes in a good shape and solid hand.
SPEAKER_02: I think it can be an interesting match as well. Do you see them any close inside or Ron's only chance is Toprol in Zurab? I think Ron probably is going outside. I don't know how strong is Ron in hook. We'd ask Chance probably about that.
SPEAKER_00: about is about ron beth so i don't remember if he's i like i cannot say if he's at the same level yet till like 2018 we saw todd hutchings versus ron beth it wasn't in a deep hook but slightly supernated that match as far as i remember if i remember it correctly and todd hutchings
SPEAKER_03: it had it took him around 20 25 seconds maybe even 30 seconds at least every round to pin ron beth in 2018. how much age has taken away from ron beth in these three four years yeah but both both okay i understand but but both were like like like getting older you know one was 53 other one was 57 or 56 so if if todd is still strong okay maybe not i don't know maybe i shouldn't do that kind of calculation but yeah
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, Ron inside is also very strong, yeah, for sure. Can you say something about that, Inge? Yeah. So I think that the biggest thing with Ron, his right hand, is if he's over his injury. In May, he had a super match against, I can't remember the gentleman's name from Armenia. Do you know him? Yeah. So Ron had an injury in his pec in that match, and that's why he had to cancel
SPEAKER_01: my super match against him in June the following month. So if Ron isn't 100% healed and he's not able to access his side pressure, like he was having issues, I think that he's gonna lose the match. You are saying that he is hurt with the right or the left?
SPEAKER_01: So he was dealing with injuries left and right from what I saw. So against Jonathan Breda in February, he didn't say he was injured because Ron will never say, but if you look at his following matches, something looks off. So that was in February that the left had an issue and the right had an issue maybe in May when he pulled the Armenian because he had to cancel his match against me. Yeah, but after that time, he didn't pull anyone with right arm?
SPEAKER_01: No, I don't believe so. Not until his, besides practice with Michael Todd and things like that. I don't think that he's had any matches. Okay. But I don't think that he would want to pull a match overseas, you know, if he didn't feel that he's ready now. Yeah, but Ron is a stubborn guy. I think his arm could be broken and he thinks he would be ready for a match. Yeah, but he really wanted to pull here.
SPEAKER_03: Not that, you know, yeah, he just said on one of the YouTube program with John Brzee, he said, hey, Engin, you hear me? Like, you know, get me there, you know, and this is how it started, you know. And so he really wanted to come, not that I asked him, you know, hey, Ron, you know, what do you think? But when a legend like that, you know, Ron, is asking a match, you know, of course, what can you say? Of course. These guys are gold, you know, while they are still pulling. I mean, I'm only happy to see them.
SPEAKER_03: So these are the matches. And Cherkasov versus Yusuf. Did you ever follow Yusuf Sandris? No, no. Top eight matches here. He had wins, you know. He also has losses, but he also has wins. He beat Christo Delijakov and he beat Daniel Prokopchuk here.
SPEAKER_03: And he won one win against Bojidar, one round, but Bojidar beat him twice. And then he also had win against Aydar Khan from Kazakhstan. Yeah, so he is not, you know, bad. He's very strong. In hook, I can't move him, you know, just not at all, you know. But so he's going to go with Cherkasov. So since you don't know Yusuf, you probably will go with Cherkasov is what I'm thinking.
SPEAKER_03: can't really comment on that i haven't seen you so much so yeah yeah yeah and chance you don't know you're sweden right i i actually i'm not too familiar with either of them yeah the guy that always put the video with me but you know of course i'm much heavier than him but yeah um and you you probably you you don't know you're sweden right he's a 65 i know
SPEAKER_00: his one yeah i remember i remember his matches it was your first event right where best three out of best two out of three matches yeah yeah i remember him pinning bojidar guy with the beard and against daniel prokopchuk also he also beat him so like you were talking about inside you don't have a chance but we all saw that oleg cherkasov is only outside maybe against daniel prokopchuk he was going outside but i'm assuming that he relies heavily on top role and you just said that
SPEAKER_00: he can be beaten i'm not saying oleg's top role is at your level but if it can be if his wrist can be taken and oleg we saw with his top role won the wave championship in a heavier weight category 5 5 kg heavier i think i think maybe maybe oleg can beat him the top role do you do you follow the chat do you see any any any
SPEAKER_00: Good questions. No, just in that first the chat was all about can ask the change show and Sandris's and everyone can they be dry and Bowen and right now it is all about live on second actually his body parts, his kidney, his liver, his legs, arms, just that one question. One question Megatron asked to both chance and
SPEAKER_00: sandras what what how do they see the future the next upcoming matches who do they want to face if they win this super match in february chance you first
SPEAKER_01: Sure. So, uh, after I beat Sandris's, uh, in February, in April or maybe may sometime, maybe a month, two months, three months after my match. So I have time to recover and train. I'd like to pull against a top, uh, us guy, someone ranked above me. I'd really enjoy a match with Todd Hutchings or Tim Brisbane. Yeah. It's in prison is.
SPEAKER_03: hard challenge for your wrist. One of the most solid pronators I have ever seen. Yeah. People are lucky that the guy didn't start early. You know, he started late. Yeah. Yeah. That guy's pronator is like, especially in his prime was rock solid. Um, and what do you think Sandris after you lose to Chance, what are you going to do next? Yeah. After, after I beat Chance 3-0, uh, I will probably have a match with Norman Stompsons in March. Oh yeah.
SPEAKER_02: for the number one spot in Latvia, officially, with the right arm. And after that, it will be getting pretty close to WAF Europeans. So I will prepare for that. And after that, I don't know. We'll see. Yeah, I understand. Okay. There are a few things that I want to clarify and then we can finish.
SPEAKER_03: You know, many people, like when they see that, like, for example, like guys beating like this and they say, Hey, look at his shoulder is also below to, you know, see, he's, he's giving shit to desperation move, but look at he is doing too. Guys. Um, I know, like, I mean, you guys don't know about arm wrestling, but it is not, you know, the same thing, you know, that to, to making yourself up like this here and then putting pressure down, there is no like leverage advantage like this one.
SPEAKER_03: And it's not the same thing. Please, when you make this kind of comments, you know, just please don't make this kind of comments because it really look terrible for you. And there are a few things that I sometimes see like there are like, like people says like, and also the people says that like people made even videos, but guys, this
SPEAKER_03: And this are not the same thing you know what i'm just saying that your shoulder needs to be somewhere that when your arm is such. It can still come to do in bed, you know see here your arm is such just because you go down your arm is like Okay, you didn't eat, but like. I mean the every centimeter of your arm is stretching and just like what can you open more you know, so that is the difference between open on top row and desperation move.
SPEAKER_03: I made some videos if you just go back and check you know it can help you i'm not talking about majority 90% of the guys know what they are talking about but some guys they don't know yep and.
SPEAKER_00: So thank you very much. Yeah, yeah, Pradeep, yeah. So earlier you said about, when somebody asked about Michael Todd, you said that he cannot go under the table in a losing position, of course, I think you mean. But you will be following WAF rules, and WAF rules, as far as I remember, say that it is only a warning, even if you go under the table in a losing position. Yeah, but same second. Just get up, get up. If he didn't get up, just same second. I will tell referees, you know, just like same second. In WAF,
SPEAKER_03: are not using that rule needs to change instead of a warning because of the uh dangerous position it needs to be an unfair advantage and a direct power it needs to be and people agree about it we just need to propose this and then to change the rule but i will in the world they are late they are like get up get up get up get up you know just like how long are you going to say get up the guy already did the advantage he goes there get up
SPEAKER_03: same second he's not moving just foul finish you know that's how it will be you know if anyone is you know really depending on this i'm not saying michael michael is not going under table for like three years you know you know he's over oh yeah you can see that you say it's not about michael there's one more question and rogers thank you roger for supervision he says sundries is still in norman's hair do am i reading wrong ready no no
SPEAKER_02: Maybe Chance can explain. Which Norman is he talking about? A hairdo is a haircut. Just a haircut. He's talking about Norman Thompsons or what? Yeah, Norman Thompsons. Yeah. So I'm stealing his haircut? Yeah. Yeah, that's the thing in Latvia, you know, to become strong in arm wrestling, you have to shave your head. So... I heard that it's not true. All the best arm wrestlers are without hair.
SPEAKER_03: sundries i heard it's not true and you have this hairstyle since you're born yeah yeah yeah of course anyways guys uh would you like to add anything and i wish you guys best at the february event and i hope chance you're gonna beat sandris because he's heavily favorite even though i am organizer i want the underdog to win sorry sandris but everyone thinks you're gonna win i i want the the the guy

Probably one of the greatest arm wrestling cards of history.
SPEAKER_03: And I just want to wish everyone a strong and safe new year and happy new year as well. Yeah, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. It will be a big honor to host you guys as the same others. You know, it will be a historical event and we will do our best to host you guys as you deserve. You know, our masters deserve best of everything, you know, because we are
SPEAKER_03: Paying the price as much as other sport disciplines and I know how much price, you need to pay with the bars and rubber bands injuries and everything weight loss and everything, so we all together. gain the the the worldwide respect that we deserve, you know, all together as a family, you know and again, thank you very much, and thank you ready, you want to say anything more. yeah definitely at the first of all thanks for inviting me like whenever I get.
SPEAKER_00: opportunities like that to learn from you guys i'm never going to say no some people may comment that i do not be belong here which i kind of agree to but
SPEAKER_03: me it is a learning opportunity why would i miss it if i'm getting an opportunity like that and second of all again i'm kind of upset you haven't even asked once in this one hour ten minute for people to buy the pay-per-view that's the problem with me that you know like like i even forget you know because i don't do this seriously like i really hope that you will cover paper reuse i won't lose anything you know but like my intention is as i said yesterday i'm still looking like
SPEAKER_03: I asked directly, you know, Zerakashvili, like, would you pull, you know, Clement, Dimitro, you know, like one more match, and then Ramos is saying, stop being, stop, you know, if you ask me, I'm going to put their third matches, even if I lose money, you understand? But I will be happy if the community supports us. If they don't support, I will lose. It's okay. But I can't really afford to organize again. But if you guys support us,
SPEAKER_03: I won't be doing like 16 matches like this time. This is going to be like a festival, but I'm thinking that five, six, seven matches the next time. Again, you know, with this high level pullers. And so if you support, thank you. I couldn't put the, when I go live through the zoom, I don't know how I can't really turn things, you know, just, I'm going to put the link, the GoFundMe link, if you want to,
SPEAKER_03: people are asking if they donate money for the T-shirt, how they are going to get it. When you donate in the GoFundMe, you will be contacted by a message. They will send you a message. You're going to give them your size of T-shirt that you want. All those T-shirts will be signed with all the top athletes. And then you are going to give the address.
SPEAKER_03: And then we are going to send you those signatures, you know, t-shirts to your home address. And then you are also going to be given pay-per-view. And if you donate like 25 or over, and then you're going to get pay-per-view. You can also buy the pay-per-view by donating, not donating, but buying 9.99 from the Core Sports channel.
SPEAKER_03: But the $25 is also like paper you get, but you also support the event with the donation, you know. So, okay, I think that's all. I will put those links later. And if you support us, I will be thankful. If you don't support, still, you know, thank you. Okay, guys, you all take care and hope to see you in five weeks. Five weeks East versus West. And, yep.
