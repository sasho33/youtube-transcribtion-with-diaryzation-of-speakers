SPEAKER_01: about the about the spit it doesn't go in very well what's going on 2022 yeah looks like uh i i think it's going to be the biggest year in armor sink history on first three months we already are so spoiled yeah yeah no it's getting better and better obviously because of the
SPEAKER_02: The exposure with the internet and the craziness of all the ways to put it online. Online? On YouTube as well? I don't know. I have no idea. I have no idea. Who's the master? Who's the master here? Is it Raymond? Give me a second. I'll check it. Raymond is the master. Yes, we are live. We have two masters here. One is
SPEAKER_00: uh you and the other one is um other one is raymond no we're all masters where someone is uh you're the you're the master of making more matches not going to sleep yeah i've yet to be able to pull this off the zoom live so i need to i need to do it i need to start you know having guests on on
SPEAKER_00: old youtube instead of me just talking for an hour and answering questions that gets a little tiring and old you know it prepares us for our you know next step in our careers standard comedy right now it seems much more relaxed so uh uh what's his name does it um yeah oh i'm losing my mind
SPEAKER_02: yeah it's it's a lot more easy to have a have someone to talk to than just be talking to yourself yeah yeah that's for sure always yeah always okay so so if we start how is everything john
SPEAKER_00: everything's good i'm feeling good i uh relaxing 2 33 last night so my weight's coming down i'm i'm within striking distance of actually probably i could i could probably start eating normal again and and uh you know do the water weight thing and make two and a quarter so i don't think it's gonna be a problem but i don't i don't wanna
SPEAKER_00: I don't want to be traveling on the airplane and we're not being able to eat anything or drink anything or do anything like that. So I don't know when the. 2.30, 2.30 is, you know, fair enough because you're losing
SPEAKER_00: total of uh 20 pounds and i can't i think that we we should not ask in a month yeah i mean it's very unfair you know just i mean come on no are you guys still pulling are you guys oh well i don't know i mean uh i think uh the march uh event in uh still on i hope but this is this is the third try so i'm i'm crossing my fingers that it's going to work out and everything is going to cover is not going to you know creep back into our lives and
SPEAKER_00: um there will be some reason why it can't happen again but yeah no i'm expecting that i'm expecting to do the trip i've got the time off i got the vacation so yeah we are talking about the east versus west today oh okay yeah yeah that is that is different we're talking about the zola match yeah yeah yeah well yeah yeah yeah ray asked if we were pulling so i just had to throw that i know i know i'm not i think we still have the right ones to not to change the subject pressure on me yeah
SPEAKER_00: um yeah looking forward to uh making the trip um i think we're leaving on wednesday so we'll get there on thursday uh the wins are going to be on the day of the event or the day yeah yeah friday friday yeah friday yeah friday day before okay so before i need it i need to figure out how to do the water water thing a little bit if i have to um for a friday so friday afternoon friday evening what's what's the plan friday morning okay there is a super chat
SPEAKER_02: i think i think uh yeah yeah it is the same thing that we were talking about it he's saying that you know hello in this moment if john shows up in turkey 230 pounds instead of 225 what are you going to do will the fight fight to happen no we're gonna put a gun on john's head and force him to run you know you're gonna put me in a row yeah put me in a rubber suit and make me uh run the streets of turkey i don't know that'd be that'd be fun
SPEAKER_00: No, I mean, you're already like losing 230 is fine. You know, just lose more than enough. Like, no, no, no, no. Yeah, no, I'm good. My energy level is good. It was it was done the first couple of weeks, but it's creeping back to a decent level now. So had a good practice in Utah yesterday. Yordan still didn't show up, but I got to pull with Cody and Craig Thule and
SPEAKER_00: yeah so it was good robert baxter robert baxter yeah he was tough yeah he's always tough he's he's getting i don't know why he's getting into such good shape so early but um i could tell that he's strong and big so he's already preparing for the worlds in september so good for you it's gonna be in turkey until yeah okay yeah so yeah i'm uh
SPEAKER_00: I got no aches and pains other than the shoulder was popping a little bit last night, which had gone away with a little bit of extra weight. But now it's back to creaking and popping. Yeah, it's just arthritis. I guess it's just not stable enough to really keep everything in place. And that labrum, I guess, or that joint still must have some...
SPEAKER_00: some bone spurs or something in it that kind of just scratches along it normally happens as i'm fatiguing so it's it's obviously the muscles that aren't able to keep that shoulder completely in the proper place so how long does it take it to become okay again a few weeks
SPEAKER_00: um well i mean when it happens um it's it's irritating it's just not like it i mean it's just a little scary that it you know and um i could tell that that's the point where i'm fatiguing and then and the shoulder is giving out uh but yeah yeah the next day two days three days like today it's you know i woke up having to toss and turn in bed you know because it was sore it's inflamed it gets inflamed when it does that so no what i mean what i mean like how long later can you force again the shoulder next week you can still
SPEAKER_00: yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah no if i manage the inflammation i mean it's you know it takes a little bit to to warm up and and you know it's it's um i need to mask it a little bit more but yeah no i'll pull with it again the next week it's um
SPEAKER_00: I've been able to manage the pain a little bit better in the last six months. So yeah, but it's still there. But I'm not going to do anything with it. I'm done with the surgery. That labrum surgery was a mess. So won't do that again. I'm not going to be cut into it anymore. So what was the surgery from the same area or different area?
SPEAKER_00: Well, the whole shoulder got redone. I went in because of the inflammation. And, you know, I went to a couple of guys and I guess I didn't go to the right guy because one of the guys said, oh, yeah, we'll do an MRI. And yeah, the labrum was was torn. And once he got in there, he realized that it was completely torn out of them to just a bicep tendon. But I know when I had torn it, I had torn it from a softball when I was only like 20 years old. So I had to live with it for 20 plus years.
SPEAKER_00: but he decided to completely detach all the scar tissue and clean it completely out, and then six anchors and re-secure it. And then I struggled, of course, a year, year and a half, two years, I was still very weak in the shoulder to try to, you know, it was a long process to get strength back, but
SPEAKER_00: And I still basically had the same inflammation, the same problems, and other shoulder surgeons said, oh, no, just by the x-rays, we could tell you just got 80-year-old shoulders. I mean, you just got arthritis really bad, and that's going to pop and crack and do that type of thing. And you probably didn't really need the labrum surgery, especially if it was 20 years old, because the scar tissue and everything that was built up in that area for it was probably making it way more stable than it is now, even after being fixed. So I was like, oh, well, great.
SPEAKER_02: were you two years ago when I, you know, when I had this problem, but what do you do? I mean, you, you try to fix things and sometimes it works out. Sometimes it doesn't. So there's a super chat. Thank you. Hey, what match are you looking most forward to all of them? All of them. I can say, if I say one of them, then it will not be true. It loves them all equally. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: And Kevin courage, thank you for super chat. John, don't get in.
SPEAKER_00: Engin's taxi. I don't know. Okay. Yeah, I do remember last time I was in Turkey, the traffic was crazy. There was no separation. There was no lines in the road. Everybody was doing this and that and this like, ah, how do you manage? Probably in Istanbul, yeah. In the downtown area, it was like that anyway, though, I remember. Yeah, the freeways were...
SPEAKER_00: um you know big wide open freeways and i do remember the guy that drove me back to the airport he was pretty aggressive on uh you know coming up on the other slower cars like you pull over because i'm going to run you over you don't pull over you know type of how many times did you come here twice right you came one time uh for art another time for krasimir correct yeah correct twice yeah yeah
SPEAKER_02: Roozbeh Gharakhloo, And there's another super chat Thank you why head high engine Thank you so much for organizing the upcoming event i'm more excited for that, then for the football World Cup yeah me too, in the past, I loved it, but now. Roozbeh Gharakhloo, I don't like it so too much organism, you know, and now i'm nothing is the only one for me. Roozbeh Gharakhloo, Anyway, so.
SPEAKER_02: If we come to Zoloev Hajimrat. Yeah. Looks like, you know, you just recently didn't have a positive experience from one side and then, but he also didn't. We talked about Genadi versus Michael and talking about the two injured lions, you know, because of their last match. And now we also have the, uh, two of the like greatest, of course you are the
SPEAKER_02: greatest by far but he's also if you put the top 10 list he is there as well and he also went to bulgaria for the world championships everyone was expecting him to win but he he lost he took second place and so he's also coming here uh he doesn't lose often you know no you can only it's less than the fingers of your hand you know that he lost in his category in last near 20 years
SPEAKER_02: So you and him, you pull in A1 in 2015. I will ask you something. Okay, you guys went to strap and he tried to top roll you. I saw that with your bottom fingers, you very good control his front wrist and then
SPEAKER_00: I mean, he looked very helpless, even let the match go, you know, he just didn't. Yeah, I'd have to, I'd have to rewind the watch the video. But I do remember being very, very close. It was like, it was just like a hair one way or the other. And I was able to manage it wasn't like overpowering.
SPEAKER_00: Uh, no, it was very, and it was very, I remember it being very close and I was like very relieved, like, oh, I, it came my way. I got it. And, and, um, and then you just took him and then you even stopped there and he just waited. He just liked it. I mean, you remember the diamonds? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm watching it now, but I think it's not possible to put there, huh? It's not possible to put the top load versus top load.
SPEAKER_02: on the screen uh give me a second you guys keep talking and that was that was in the strap so that wasn't dead all of them i think all of them were in step maybe maybe yeah but the one that he foreseen hook so we were not sure if he foreseen hook from there you took him yeah didn't really top roll he didn't really take the risk but still your pronator control but his wrist didn't look like this but more like open his arm
SPEAKER_00: and i don't know if he forced you to hook or yeah no he did he did yeah no he yeah he forced me to hook yeah yeah that seems to be the case with most people that i've been pulling lately is they've been able to dictate the match which is disconcerting to me but i don't know what to do about it um you know i watched even even though i felt like i you know was uh gonna try to hit real and be real fast even with devin and then watching the footage i'm like
SPEAKER_02: they just said go we kind of tightened up and it was just like a slow pressure there was no no deep breath hit ever so um yeah i don't know if that's just going to be gone forever or what but i think i think that with you and devon just because you both didn't have the risk control so it seemed like you seemed like you were not sure like if you should move quick that maybe you were afraid of losing your wrist so but once you realize it stop there so with your tornado you still
SPEAKER_02: was able to go to that part, probably. Yeah, this is what I am thinking. I mean, you hit when you have risk, you know, when you don't have risk, you are more like control first. And then so even with the Dennis Cipenko,
SPEAKER_00: some like 13 years ago you didn't really hit him as far as i remember in a super match right now i guess you're right you got to have total control to feel like you can actually surge into it but uh which i didn't i'm most uh concerned with uh uh
SPEAKER_00: Zoloev about the endurance thing. I mean, I know I'm watching him pull Todd Hutchings in Las Vegas. I mean, he's got crazy, crazy good endurance to be able to hang with Todd as big as and strong as he was for that Las Vegas match. And my endurance has been just pathetic lately, seemingly pathetic.
SPEAKER_02: So even if I can get him a match or two, I'm still very concerned that he could get middle later round. So, um, yeah, but other, other, other, if he, you know, uh, make Devon exception about the endurance. When you look at your previous three super matches, uh, you were not the one who got exhausted, but all your opponents, chance and Dimitri and Pauline.
SPEAKER_02: were not the one that you know started losing you know right they they kind of get you know start losing i i think that you don't there is nothing much you know like i prevent i prevent i prevailed but i was gas hard i was breathing hard and and in the hand and especially the hand and wrist and the forearm almost was numb which because you love to control yeah which is never yeah which is never what you needed to do do the window okay you want to watch this john can you see
SPEAKER_02: yeah yeah okay yeah see oh yeah yeah yeah okay yeah yeah yeah yeah it didn't look that hard as you remember probably look look at you will now see better see him and then.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it doesn't look very comfortable, but just the side pressure was able to take him out of position. Yeah, I don't remember the first match without the straps. We must have just both pulled back and slipped real hard. Yeah, yeah. So that'll probably be just because he's dangerous enough and he has a good enough, there it is, okay, good enough top roll that I won't attempt to try to hang on to him. So here we go again, back to the old straps, which... Probably now it's going to go inside. This is the second round?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Yes. He hooks me. Nice. You, you again. Yeah. Just pull with a thumb. Yeah. Through them. But I'm heavy. I'm heavy, heavy there. I'm probably 240, 240. That was, yeah. Yeah. So it'll be, it'll be good. Yeah. Yeah. I'm sure about it. I, yesterday I, or yesterday or day before, probably yesterday, Arsene, Lydia, Krasimir and Yanis, we, we did the program yesterday. Okay. And yeah, we, we all like thought that, you know,
SPEAKER_02: like outside ability of Zoloev nothing compared to Dmitry Kachan you know this is this is because Krasimir is a person that pull with Dmitry Kachan even years ago so okay so we I personally don't see Zoloev is toppling you maybe you may a little bit loses your wrist but he will also lose and then you are more experienced about this kind of pulling yeah so I really think that
SPEAKER_02: I think his only chance is forcing a hook, but with the elbow injury that he recently had in the WAF. It might not be as powerful. Yeah, he may be healed up, but being healed up and then bringing your joint to the level that, you know, having an incredible joint pressure. I don't know if it is possible. There are three superchats. Thank you for them. The Hanster. Hey, John.
SPEAKER_00: Who is stronger, Rob Vision Jr.'s hand or Matt Mask's hand? Different times that I've pulled them, but the last time I pulled Matt in the WAL, he was strong, very fired up, and very difficult. If I were to bet on those two guys, I would have to give the edge to Matt Mask, just because he's a bigger guy. He's bigger, he's thicker.
SPEAKER_02: Rob's probably a little bit better and a hook but. Like more like risk control full hand control, while that is just more like posting type of you know yeah. yeah. By Kevin, thank you for super chat after parts performance with lachlan john does.
SPEAKER_00: how does it match with Todd looks like in your opinion, probably meaning you versus- With me? Yeah. Todd's always been tough. Todd's been tough 10 years ago, 15 years ago, 20 years ago. So I know exactly how tough Todd is.
SPEAKER_00: So it wasn't a surprise to me to see him beat Laughlin. I mean, Todd, in my opinion, there's only a couple of guys inside if that has more side pressure. I mean, he's he's in my opinion, he's as strong as Devin and Catarat and obviously Matt Mask. He pulls through. He well, Corey West now. And I mean, there's just there's only one guy that I can think of that can outmatch
SPEAKER_02: uh todd hutchins and that's dave chafee as far as just you know i think jerry was way too much i think that's more stylistically how would they go arm to arm or risk you know why would we why would we compare him with the super exactly for his weight
SPEAKER_00: E.J. Especially in a slow start, I don't think anyone can beat him inside in the world. Yeah. No, no. Yeah. So, I mean, to answer that question, I think I have chances against Todd Hutchings. I think I still have the chances that Zoloev had against Todd Hutchings. I mean, if the situation is right and I can get outside of him and I'm aggressive and healed.
SPEAKER_00: I think I can beat Todd at least a couple matches. Whether or not I can outlast him in a supermatch format for six matches, that's a whole another question. But I think I'm, you know, I think I'm obviously, I feel like I'm capable still, you know, I wouldn't say that, you know, that I could, you know.
SPEAKER_02: The biggest problem is not taking his wrist, but the biggest problem is finishing him, right? Finishing him still after taking his wrist. You can't let it stop. You can't rest. I can't look at him and say, okay, give up. You're out of position because that's not happening. It just makes him madder. Another one. What's that? Insane? Okay, whatever. Thank you for supporting. John or Engin, did you ever pull
SPEAKER_02: the New York City legend, Jason Weil. Back in the day, what can you say about him?
SPEAKER_00: rest in peace you know jason passed away you know yeah no of course i've pulled jason and i think you have two haven't you i've um practice practice i pulled him practice only okay yeah but you you pull him in idaho idaho when the scale was all messed up and i was going to pull the heavier class because my brother i went up there with my brother and i didn't want to pull the same class as bill i was going to pull the heavier class he was going to pull the i think whatever the 200 pound class and the scale was all
SPEAKER_00: completely so messed up. And I was like, well, if you're going to weigh me in at 189 or something, whatever the scale weight I'm in, that's just the weight class I'm in. And so I ended up pulling the lighter weight class, had no business because I was actually way heavier than that. But so I got a chance to pull Jason. Yeah. And
SPEAKER_00: Just a different beast when he was in the straps. I mean, he had great arm strength. His hand strength wasn't as good, but he could really apply a tremendous amount of back pressure once he got in the straps. So he was very, very, very deadly good in the straps. I remember that in the final, you didn't allow him to go to straps. No, I didn't want him to go to straps because it just felt very, very unusual and uncomfortable. Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I saw him saying with the Petaluma 1997 World Wrestling Championship, where he beat, I think, both Matt Goerner and Eric Wohlfelder. Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: yeah yeah yeah but who else who else has that ability i mean there's been only i guess a few that have really been that drastically different straps no straps i guess brian's kind of that way he's he can apply a lot more of his arm strength once he gets locked in and secures it with the lower part of the his you know his wrist with the strap he's very good at that but um
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. I mean, if you're not super strong, I mean, people ask me, well, oh, my hand's small. I have, you know, I have a hard time dealing with bigger guys and I don't have the hand strength and dah, dah, dah, dah. Well, my always suggestion is develop a good strap game, you know, get, get really comfortable in the strap and, and, and, and, you know, practice the pulling with knuckles high and, and, and, and developing that hammer curl strength, because that can negate a lot of the, uh, the inability of a strong hand.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, White Wolf, ask your question, John. Thank you for your question. John, if you feel your arm blew up against Devon after that first round, will six months of training fix that? And do you change your training?
SPEAKER_00: um i hope that i can fix it and get back to i'm actually quite surprised that it's the thing that's been lacking the most um since i've been somewhat retired that's taken a long time to get back to you know what i what i remember it being but um i i don't know i don't know um
SPEAKER_00: yes i haven't really done any training outside of just arm wrestling a lot uh when i arm muscle chance it was probably just a month or so of pulling with dustin uh no no no cables no wrist stuff um and then basically just arm wrestling here and there and doing a lot of wrestling because i had two other super matches so i i got a couple three weeks in of training again arm wrestling and then we would rest a couple weeks and
SPEAKER_00: so obviously the super matches were strenuous enough where I felt like I was progressing or getting stronger because of the super matches but yeah I don't know I guess I you know I worry that the problem is that it's not so much my my hand strength or the development of training with just the hand it's also the fact that I'm just you know older and lazy as hell as far as
SPEAKER_00: uh activities go and cardio i don't you know i get winded now when i you know walk a mile so it's or you know go up up an incline or a flight of steps so it's it's also the heart that's also weak that i need to uh i need to really concentrate and fix uh but um this time of the year i you know uh
SPEAKER_00: nicely enough that, uh, I, I do a lot of snowmobiling and I'm always breathing hard while I'm snowmobiling. So I'll go four or five hours of, of wrestling that, that snowmobile around. And, um, you know, at the end of the day, I feel like, oh, the next day, two days later, I'm like, oh, I'm in, I'm in better shape. I'm in a lot better shape just from, from, uh, snowmobiling. So hopefully I'll have a little bit more endurance come, uh, come my match with Zoloev, but, uh,
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I know what I need to do. I mean, I know what I need to fix. It's just will I do it? And, you know, I think I think I think that we need we need like endurance for from the outside or table, as you said, those kind of cardio type of trainings, but it doesn't allow them to cover the endurance that we need at the table that you know, with the it's not that
SPEAKER_02: perfect the same endurance right there that when you have a like a tough match it's just because you you you run or you walk like every day 10 kilometer it doesn't mean that you're I always believe that you really need to feel the same amount of pressure in the trainings that you will feel at the competition
SPEAKER_00: to have that kind of endurance, yeah. And it's a huge difference between being the offensive guy that gets a great position and then the other guys struggling and hanging on. And I've been on the other side of that.
SPEAKER_00: coin now i'm the guy that's trying to control and hang on and be the guy that's trying to control the offensive guy so uh yeah i need to maybe maybe it's just a little tiny bit of extra strength to get that back where i'm the guy that's got the bow and in a in a relaxed position and put the other person out of position that that they that they gas so quickly um
SPEAKER_00: Huge difference between being the guy that's trying to, you know, control and control somebody that's just leaning back and just being offensive and not really having that kind of strain on their hand and wrist. It's a little trickery there. But yeah, I mean, I definitely recognize that fact that I'm the guy that's trying to, you know, get a hold and control. Well, at least in the last couple of Supermatches I've had.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I think that I usually train with people who are a little bit weaker than me if I want to train my defensive strength. I allow them, apply pressure, and I control them. And then whenever I want to train my offensive power, then I train with people who are stronger than me.
SPEAKER_02: and they allow me to apply my pressure, you understand? And then I think we need both of them, you know, because sometimes, you know, we are applied strength and we also need to apply to
SPEAKER_00: win so i think we need to train right but you know how it is and even you know in a match or practice being just a little bit out of position and still trying to fight for the win versus having total control and almost being in a relaxed position and then the other guy trying to to to save the match or if i'm stronger i allow them like for example i never trained my pronator like by taking people's wrists you know like
SPEAKER_02: Evgeny if I know I can, I don't let my pronator to go that way either. But I just wait in a position that my pronator is still with me and the guy doesn't lose his wrist and he can apply pressure. So whenever he applies pressure, so my pronator, people, just gets out of the hand. I believe at that point, your training is finished there. There's no pressure. I allow them to put pressure, pressure, pressure.
SPEAKER_00: So then it's getting blocked there. But would you train purposely to have your wrists a little bit cocked back and be like that? So that's the mistake. I mean, in some of the matches that I've had recently, I'm still fighting, even though I've gotten a feeling like I'm not...
SPEAKER_00: I'm not in a position. I shouldn't be fighting from that position. I mean, it's. You mean the super match or the training? Yes. Yes. In the super matches. But that's how you won all those three super matches. I had no, I had no choice, but that's the reason. That's the reason. That's the reason why. Well, that's the reason the endurance factor feels like I'm just like pathetic the next match, you know, it's because, you know, I've redlined in a, just a very awkward position that just makes it.
SPEAKER_02: really impossible. I believe, John, I believe that training too much of pronators and then starting the application from here is bad for the wrist, I believe. I think the wrist control needs to come first before the pronation application. And then if you start everything from here, I think that the application needs to start from the here of the opponent, then continue. Instead of just directly applying it
SPEAKER_00: Well, there's two thoughts to that. We were discussing this at practice yesterday up in Utah, or actually it was Saturday. Especially when the Kings move, is it better to have your cup and sit like that? Because if you're doing this, you're flexing the forearm. There is some pressure on the forearm versus it just being flat and just using a pronator and just relaxing. Now you don't have any finger pressure or
SPEAKER_02: a wrist curl to be blowing up the forearm all you're doing is allowing that yeah but you may lose your own wrist as well you know it doesn't matter it doesn't matter though it's still it still applies a tremendous amount of pressure on your opponents but i saw bob brown was telling craig and the buff was going and then craig was going inside and at the end bob was losing the wrist you know because he was hidden there because he was not really controlling here so that's how he was uh
SPEAKER_00: losing the wrist is what i saw well i i i find it still debatable and the jury's still out on whether or not what's more taxing if you're going for the defensive pull the defensive hold is it is it straight risk with just pronator and just you know allowing the hand and wrist to be really relaxed or is it still trying to cup while you're applying that that that king's move desperation move yeah yeah whenever whenever you were pulling with uh that one
SPEAKER_02: It's just not because Devon let you take his wrist whenever you're pressing. You really, with the pressure that with the pronator he applied, he kind of lost his wrist as well. And then more you dive, but did you realize that whenever he opened himself, he continued putting pressure to your pronator. So you even lost a little bit pronator. So that's probably why maybe you couldn't do the finishing shoulder pressure. Because I saw that he was also, did you realize, at the end he was like this.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, right yeah now because I switched I switched from downward pressure on my wrist to trying to supinate to try to connect could make the connection with his wrist and that. yeah. He didn't come to you doing like this, he could right he could have held his wrist flat as well, if you wanted, you know, but he didn't do that he more he put pressure on your pronators more your angle.
SPEAKER_02: Got more sure to apply pressure. This is what I saw, but I mean, you would know better. You were there. Yeah, no, I, well, I had, I had to switch gears cuz I, the, the, the hand and forearm and, and the, and the, the pin wasn't coming by just side pressure. So I had. I have a question for you. You guys said that before that event, you know, you guys were talking about who's gonna have the buckle. You said, give me, you know, if you are so confident to have the buckle there and there, and you, one of your, uh, uh, YouTube, uh, videos after the event, you said,
SPEAKER_02: You guys flip coin and you won't, but they still put the buckle on your hand. If I were there, I would just say, no, I'm not pulling. Seriously, that moment, I would just stop pulling. I'm not saying that. I love those guys. Everyone there. But if you flip coin, you won't, the buckle won't pull.
SPEAKER_00: In my mind, in my eyes, even from the beginning, even with all the talk about the rules, the promotion and the match was bigger than all of that.
SPEAKER_00: I just had to basically say, oh, okay, just another obstacle. Let's just do whatever. Yeah. They didn't communicate with each other, obviously. I mean, uh, we did the flip coin flip because that was part of the rules or what was, was agreed upon. And then as it came down to the actual, um, You know, the actual match and the production, they had set it up completely different question. Would it make difference?
SPEAKER_00: the round one i well a tiny bit i i i like not having the buckle on my hand i feel like i can normally get a better grip on the setup and i can apply apply better cup and and back pressure and top roll maybe it's all mental but i feel i feel it's enough of a noticeable difference um whether would it help me enough to win a match against devin yeah i don't know i don't know joan i will tell you honestly my opinion
SPEAKER_02: Like the first round is only was important because of that batting team. Yeah. Other than that batting team, the one round as a super match didn't mean anything.
SPEAKER_00: Well, it meant something. Or 5-1, you know, what is the difference 6-0 or 5-1? Well, it was a victory. But it was a victory for me. In the situation that was, it would have been a victory in my mind. I mean, I went in there just...
SPEAKER_02: i mean for everybody for everybody else it would have been like oh yeah he still got beat he's still he's still yeah i mean for me i mean i don't understand all that you know like uh argument about it about the one round one i mean just say like it's four two still they won't won't so i mean important is like not like how many rounds who won
SPEAKER_02: But who won at the end? This is what matters at the end. But because of that betting, I think that round one made all that argument. That is what I saw.
SPEAKER_00: yeah well like i said for me too it would have been a personal victory i i went into the match thinking yes that then i'll be super super stoked i mean it was kind of my actually my goal i didn't really have the goal of i mean yeah it would have been great if i could have won a couple of rounds or won the you know the series but um you know in my mind it would have been you know just from your side i perfectly understand
SPEAKER_02: But I don't understand the argument of thousands of people are doing, you know. I mean, for me, even if he would beat you 4-3 or something, he won that super match, you understand? Like, there are super matches that you also won probably 4-2 or something, right? You beat Taras 4-2. I mean,
SPEAKER_02: like who cares you know if it's like if taras won two rounds you are the one who won who beat him you understand so that one that day was better and in my opinion i said it maybe people maybe even maybe you get upset with me when i said that you know maybe that one was heavier and i think that what i believe like your chance to beat him just said 240 240 this is what he said remember on the live he said after he beats you he's gonna come down and beat you again in the same way
SPEAKER_02: So 240, like WAF rules, you close your hands and ready go. Nothing about that and this and that, you understand? I don't blame Devon either. I mean, like if that is the rules, I don't really know what the rules are. And if anyone accepted to go there and pull under that rules, like for example, Levan. If Levan goes there and loses because he gets exhausted, you know, because hand pump, because of that. I mean, I can't blame Devon, you know, it is Levan.
SPEAKER_00: knows when he's going into the yes, you know he's an adult he signed the contract after that whatever happens happens, you know. Right right no so you know yeah and that's the way I look at it it's it's it's is what it is and it's the challenge if you're willing to accept that challenge in that situation you then you say yes, I mean if you're if you're if you've.
SPEAKER_00: feel doubt or scared or you're you know you feel like your reputation will be trashed or whatever reason people come up with to say no then you say no yeah yeah yeah i mean that's why the whole that's why the whole fighting of the of the rules and this and that and the other and you know it's fun to to to stir the pot but at the end of the day it was what it was and you know you just got to accept it john if you make a top 10 greatest ever arm master list
SPEAKER_02: and other than you, the nine person, nine people other than you, if we ask them who is the greatest of all times, they would just say you. So what I will ask you, if you, like, I don't know how much you care about this statue or not, but if you were not by far the greatest art master of all time, would you still not care
SPEAKER_00: about accepting near mission impossible looking challenges? Would you be more plain secure about the offers? No. I think it's easier for people or the desire is way more there when you're trying to climb the ladder. When you're trying to get recognized, people are willing to take on whoever.
SPEAKER_00: And once you've reached that position of notoriety, then I guess maybe that comes into play. But for me, it's still always been, you know, every day is a new day. Every day is a different, you know? So I don't know. I've gone into a lot of matches
SPEAKER_00: very unprepared and still did it just because of personal, you know, curiosity. Like, can I pull this off still? 40 years. Yeah. You didn't lose one thing that you are ready to step up.
SPEAKER_02: against anyone here. We are ready. I think that the only problem for you is like, oh, losing weight or traveling. But other than that, if it is not like, you know, like losing weight and traveling, you know how hard it is. I think you are still like ready to pull, you know, almost anyone as long as you know that you have some check.
SPEAKER_00: chance and this is how you were yeah yeah well and i don't understand the people that would you know because nobody's ever completely meant ready right mentally they're always some self-doubt and and i mean nobody would ever pull anybody if they were like oh i just ah man i'm not completely ready i'm not sure i'm not gonna i'm not going i'm not we would never see any matches i mean so yeah but the things change the things change now people are like picking you know like i remember you competing
SPEAKER_02: every event that you know was paying good price money award you were going everywhere anytime depends you know four or five categories you were pulling but the things change now people are just like once and
SPEAKER_00: or twice a year. And that would make sense to me that I could accept that. And that would make sense if there was like, based on reputation or image, there was big endorsements, or you're making X amount of dollars, you know, from social media and YouTube, that is okay, but maybe you got to, you got to weigh that, like, well, do I want a chance? Like, there's not? Yeah, but there is, there is not yet. Anyway, maybe there is here coming in the near future. But
SPEAKER_02: there are there are if you if you super chat and then i will let right monster ask you question hans to thank you for super chat where would you rank devon's left arm right now and would you rank his left one of the best of all time i would love to see him versus cody merit left arm john
SPEAKER_00: I put, yeah, Devin's super, super strong, even though he says it's his party arm and he hasn't been training in or doing anything with it. It was super, super healed, felt rock solid. Like there was absolutely nothing I could do with his left arm. So, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: I would say that Devin is probably, I don't know what, how, what LeBron is lefty. I don't know what any of the top, top guys are, if they train Vitaly, uh, but Devin isn't, isn't far apart. Before the injury, he, his left has some problem, uh, LeBron's.
SPEAKER_02: but his left is better than his right arm. Oh, okay. Yeah, yeah. So there are challenges out there for Devin, but yeah, no. No, no, no, no, no, no. He would beat Devin badly. Okay, okay. Yeah, badly.
SPEAKER_00: Devon's strong left-handed. I'll say that. Devon's very strong lefty. I know Cody would not back down from the challenge of pulling Devon in a left-handed match. And he's deserving of it because Cody is a beast left-handed. But yeah, Devon is definitely, in my mind, would probably be a big favorite. Ramos, when you say, like, when I said badly, you just wanted to mention or you agree with me? I just wanted to mention.
SPEAKER_02: You disagree with that? Left arm? I think so, too. I think so, too. But you're like, he would beat him badly. Yeah, yeah. With left arm at the WAF, we didn't see Lewand losing. I don't remember. Maybe once. I don't remember. With right arm, we have seen. Yeah, like with right arm, like a lot before 2017. And after that, crazy, right?
SPEAKER_00: yeah what about uh what about the kardesha versus batali and uh lavon i see that is he that good so dominant against hermes close i think so too yeah he's not deaf i mean like close like within a year yeah yeah he seems to be progressing a lot more than quickly than the other two so you know how strong ryan espy is you know ryan yeah yeah pretty well and
SPEAKER_01: that armors wasn't even, there was nothing, you know?
SPEAKER_01: It'll be interesting. They pull left arm too? Yes, both arms. I think the more impressive is the beating Ryan lefty. Yeah. Ryan was huge. Like, like I have seen him huge, but now he was huge. And I remember Kordechia walks in and I'm like, I'm like, dude, like two giants. And I thought, okay, we, we have to give edge to Ryan's left arm, you know, right arm. I think Kordechia and nothing, not even close. Just,
SPEAKER_02: Stoyan Bumbalov?nkerl?nkert?nkert?nkert?nkert?nkert?nkert?nkert?nkert?nkert?nkert?nkert?nkert?nkert?nkert?nkert?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, versus Ray. I don't have any experience with you, Ray. Have we ever even ripped up? Yeah, but with left arm, I think. With left arm at your house. Oh, yeah. No, no, no. You're at the house. Yeah. Well, I was in a drunken state. I don't probably remember. We all were in a drunken state. Like, every time a beard is...
SPEAKER_00: beer was empty you brought the new one and put it in my hand yeah no no yeah at least at least my little comeback here i i've definitely curved that
SPEAKER_00: 95 i haven't i've drank maybe once every week or so or a little just a little bit and it really doesn't taste good to me anymore so i yeah that's that's been a healthy aspect of this little bit of arm wrestling training i remember we're sitting we just got to your house and you just bring out the beer and it's dark beer very very uh yeah and i and i drink it and i'm like
SPEAKER_00: like this doesn't taste that good like the second one third one two beers in i'm like this is amazing yeah yeah yeah no it's a little shock to your system but yeah but anyway uh ryan versus yourself um ryan is very uh well you pulled did you pull with him was he here when you uh were here at the house yeah so you got some experience when you answer the question my my left left arm uh raymond's would win and right arm i think uh yeah
SPEAKER_00: Ryan will admit that he sucks lefty. I don't know if he's actually trained his left anymore at all, but Ryan's a dangerous cat with the strap. It'll be interesting. I know Todd Hutchings just destroying Laughlin really makes everybody believe that RBJ will just destroy Ryan, but...
SPEAKER_00: i think i'm just as strong as rvj and i would not take ryan lightly if i got put in the straps with him i mean there you better be on your because uh you know he's got a good sticking point he's got it's not really a king's move but it's a it's a danger enough sticking point where you could get embarrassed in a six round super match my opinion
SPEAKER_00: James Forrest, Norcal PTAC- makes sense, so you you I don't I don't remember how explosive you were Ray I mean you're only well your only chance, but my only chance against Ryan would be to make sure that the setup was correct and I beat him quickly without going to the strap. James Forrest, Norcal PTAC- If if he ended up somehow getting away from me and I had to go to the straps with them, I would be concerned so.
SPEAKER_01: i'll ask you a question regarding the same topic we're talking about when you were pulling ryan last time he was in in arizona yeah where your shoulder really bad i was i was a pretty pathetic individual exactly so yeah maybe yeah maybe my um yeah i think you can you kind of remember in your form there and you comparing it to now yeah yeah yeah
SPEAKER_00: Because like... Giannis would kill me. Giannis killed me that day over and over again. Well, I felt like I could hang. And again, no. And again, no. Giannis, Giannis. Yo, yes. Giannis in a strap. No.
SPEAKER_01: Without the strap, he couldn't do anything. With the strap, yes. Everyone. Vlad, whoever put the strap on you with, they killed you pretty much. Without the strap, no one could have taken that hand. I remember Vladislav was like, he took your hand and you just like, he's like, what's this? Nothing. But Ramos is saying that, you know, you judging Ryan's level,
SPEAKER_02: with the shape that uh you were yeah i think i think his shoulder was was concerned about a concern about ryan then don't come to istanbul at all
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, no, no, no. But I'm just saying that Ryan, Ryan has proven himself against, you know, Daniel Mosier. And I mean, there was always the, the reasoning why, well, maybe he wasn't the, you know, the real Dan and, um, you know, Dallas Langston and, you know, the early Browns with, uh, you know, uh, Chance Shaw, even, I mean, so Brian has proven that he can, he can pull top guys that are his way. There's no doubt about it. Just remembering with an injury feeling.
SPEAKER_00: i think you're remembering how you felt well and plus i'm falling into like everybody else thinking that ryan has progressed better and faster and quicker than everybody else on the planet it's like obviously like probably not my house probably not true the reality of the fact is that most people get that much better throughout their whole life i mean they you are who you are unless you're a new newcomer to the sport and you you know you're you're a newbie then i say okay well
SPEAKER_00: come back in three years, we'll see what kind of, kind of our muscle you are. But once you've reached that maturity of three, four years, I, I think, I think the, the, the changes of someone's ability really hilariously doesn't get much different. I mean, much better. And as much as they talk and say, this is a new me, it's the new version. Um, this, this, that, and the other reality is they're, they're still the same person, right? So who, who, who is saying that I'm the new one?
SPEAKER_00: Well, most everybody goes home and then says they're going to regroup and re-figure it out and they're going to come back stronger than ever and bigger than ever and da-da-da-da-da-da-da. Myself included. And I'm like, okay, I don't know. I don't know if the extra 20 pounds actually made me any stronger than I was. You know, it's just... Yeah, I don't know. Some people say they're like, what, 44% stronger? Yeah, yeah. Some people.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know I read that many people talking about that. But it's a nice thought to know or to feel any way that people are going to be who they were who I remember them being. Through two years ago, three years ago, four years ago, five years ago, I shouldn't be like fall into that trap of oh my God he's going to be the new guy, I mean.
SPEAKER_00: Evgeny with Devin, I mean, yes, Devin's bigger, he's stronger, but he was still pretty good at 220. He's better, yes, maybe a little bit here and there, but maybe it's mental. Maybe it's the size and the intimidation of these things that all play a part. But realistically, I don't know if he's really...
SPEAKER_01: Any of us really can really progress that much. I don't know. I think that's the problem with armors that we cannot measure it. We really cannot measure. When someone says, I was in my best shape ever, and we look at the guys you beat, not how you felt, not how much you lifted, nothing. It just comes with that. And when you're like, you know, when you're Zuluya and you've been like winning Woff Worlds,
SPEAKER_01: without any problem for this how many years did really someone catch up to you or you just a little bit weaker because before then no one could touch you same thing i think with many arm wrestlers and i think it's it's very weird we cannot figure it out like even if you talk with janice jones will say well i was stronger i was lifting more i felt healthier you know but i can still beat most of the guys because i was just still so much ahead of the pack right right well it's not like either black or white this subject
SPEAKER_00: especially the health condition is very important. For example, your hand and wrist, it has been John's biggest weapon. Yeah. And other factors, mental state, the situation, how you feel like the wear and tear of your opponent.
SPEAKER_00: here i'll bring up referees again but refereeing is very important the setup is so critical it could it can be so decisive one way another of a smash match based on just how it got you know how the match got set up
SPEAKER_00: I mean, you can have 50 guys in a room and everybody, the 50th guy could smash the 49th guy, the 49th could smash the 40. Is there that big a gap between one and 50? It could be still pretty tight, but arm wrestling is...
SPEAKER_00: closely contested. I mean, the strength thing, yes, it's important, but also other, just so many other little factors. But trust me, the health part is, to me, most important. The biggest. The biggest. If you are hurt, trust me, Arif,
SPEAKER_02: you are not using that area, you are like, you can be five to 10%, you know, less than who you were before. And if somehow you fix that problem, you can come back stronger. It's not because you are really stronger in muscle, but you are able to use the previously injured muscle group now and that coordination is making yourself someone
SPEAKER_00: difference you know so no no i've noticed that fact and that's why i always kind of go back to like it's so much more important to be you know not in great shape but just well healed and rested i mean it's more important to have that extra week that three weeks of doing absolutely nothing versus trying to squeeze in that extra couple of extra workouts
SPEAKER_01: i think that's everyone wants you know the last two weeks they just wanna more i feel so strong i should be lifting more i should be arm wrestling more and all you should be doing is chill you know but you but you can't be an arm wrestler throughout the whole year every year
SPEAKER_01: if you're just doing super matches like that always just chilling so yeah there i guess there should be a season you should be busting your ass for you know the four or five months i i don't think you rested before every competition some competition like yeah i'll just you know it doesn't matter you will have a workout on friday and saturday you'll be on the tournament pulling seven classes right
SPEAKER_00: Well, in my mind, I use that as training device that that that last super match I had a month ago, it put me in a, you know, kept me in a peak form for him for this next super match. So I'm just basically resting. But, you know, at the end of the end of the year, you realize that you didn't do any training. I mean, he just rested all year long trying to set yourself up for the next super match. Yeah, priority. So this is my guys are pulling two tournaments in a year.
SPEAKER_00: We got to the root of that. Right. But that's, that mentally is what they need to feel like that's their best going in that they need to have that, that, that training and that, you know, that's to me, not so maybe it's not so much the physical part, but it's just the mental part. So to me, to me, the difference between like some of those guys and then the past is that some people were able to keep themselves at the top level.
SPEAKER_02: almost all year long for many years. And while people today, they can only be in great shape, like maximum three times a year for a reason, you know, this is, this is what I see. But is that just because they won't show up only three times a year? Is it a mental problem that they have or is it really, truly a physical problem that they, they couldn't compete all year?
SPEAKER_00: See, I think you need to have the mindset of like, I'm just as good as I am or as good or very close to the best shape when I'm in my best shape versus when I haven't been doing anything. And if you have that mindset, like I'm still going to be really pretty close, then you just continue to just put yourself out there. You just keep saying that, you know, the guys can still do it. If you're questioning yourself and saying, well, you know, I haven't done any training. I haven't.
SPEAKER_02: my lifts are down and i feel like i'll probably be weak and i'm like then you don't show up and then i don't think it's about the training whatever i don't want to talk and so um i can think about you know cycles we go through the life yeah anyway so what um what i want to say that about about ryan you explained that his wins against some of the north americans yeah it's great i i consider ryan you know like good level arm master
SPEAKER_02: But I don't consider him like some athletes like Sasho. Oh, yeah. No, no, no, no, no. You compare yourself and you would be like very scared or something. But your level, if you are in good shape, your name is even today can be mentioned. That's why you come into Istanbul to pull Zola. This is what I wanted to say. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I'm just, I'm just saying, suggesting it was probably a couple dozen. You could probably find a hundred guys in Europe that are explosively fast. That will, um, go right through Ryan. I'm just saying that Ryan has the ability and strength that if you're not careful, you're those. So same guys could be, you know, stopped and then, and then be, um, yeah. Like stop, like do you think that like Zola hook him?
SPEAKER_00: they are stopped there do you think that you know he can do something i mean i feel like john is sponsored by pound for pound yeah they think maybe no i'm just i just know what i've experienced and like i said it was in a but even in my bad shape a couple three years ago um i feel like i was still i mean testing myself against anybody that would ever show up or what i would you know let myself be
SPEAKER_00: be handled i was fairly still fairly decent arm wrestler and i just know that there are spots that i got myself into that i thought i had control and i really didn't have control and i ended up getting beat by the man so john i have a question for you if you go to east and west and then we finish it um oh first first i will ask you do you see uh devon's chance high versus levan
SPEAKER_00: Uh, no, no, no, no. I just, cause I think in any condition that you, even if the setup is like five minutes, no, I, cause I think LaVon is in really fantastic shape. He's young. He's got, I mean, he trains hard, so his cardio is going to be there. He's got the height. He's got the arm length to not have Devin really mess with them in that respect. He's got a super strong cup. Um,
SPEAKER_00: I'm not even sure if Devin's extended open arm top roll would be effective. That's the only way I can see him beating LeBron is if it sticks somehow. What do you think would be the best strategy if you would be Devin to beat LeBron? Hook or up rolls?
SPEAKER_00: I think he's going to pull the same exact move he did with pulling the situation when he pulled Pushkar left-handed. He's just got to get out there and get it stopped. And if LeVon's not ready to commit to a possible shoulder roll, if it stops, if he continues to pull outside and his cup is, even if he's secured his cup and he's taken Devin all the way close to the pad and it doesn't end,
SPEAKER_00: he's going to be in trouble. I mean, we saw, you know, what... But you don't think it's going to happen, right? But you don't think it's going to happen? Well, I shouldn't say I don't, you know, I...
SPEAKER_00: As dominant as Pushkar was, I just remember watching that match and thinking, oh my goodness. And then what happened to Pushkar afterwards? He turned into a little ragdoll. Yeah, yeah. He stopped pulling that bluff. He only continued pro. And yeah, that is, yeah, whatever. But just, I will tell you, John,
SPEAKER_02: in my opinion honest opinion uh levan and lalatin is in my opinion uh about the push car level right now yeah um yeah because i believe like push car beat uh turbine in a super match five one or six zero probably whatever and then at the slow teacher
SPEAKER_02: Turbin toppled him, beat him once, and again, I think he was beating him very little elbow foul, they call on Turbin, and then he lost. And then another one, Pushkar toppled him, probably next year, and he was beating Pushkar that way, and then he won. Pushkar fouled, I think. So what I'm just saying that Pushkar was better than Turbin, but there are two Zloty events I saw that it was
SPEAKER_02: like this between them. And then I saw Levan in the year that he was still pulling WAF. You know what it means. And he beat Turbin 6-0. And after that, he became something like different level. And as you saw, Vitaly Laletin easily beat Turbin 6-0. And then also Levan beat Laletin 6-0.
SPEAKER_00: So in my, in my opinion, just these two are just getting a little bit like, right. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I, and I believe Lavon for sure. I believe Lavon is the strongest person on the planet with his cupping ability and that's, what's going to be needed to beat the, you know, the extended open top role slash Kings move. Um, that I think is Devon's only, only chance. I don't see Devon moving or having on a offensive.
SPEAKER_00: hit in any direction, any way, shape or form. If I was Devin, I would be for sure training that, you know, that sticking point, that Michael Todd spot and hope that it sticks there. There is Power Rangers Super Chat. John, do the King's move on Engin. I suck at the King's move. John, if you ever do that, I will take...
SPEAKER_02: every positive thing that I have told about you, everything from the 90s to today, everything, I will take it back. And I wouldn't I would not feel I would never feel good, even if I could pull it off and actually get a win on doing that. Yeah, I would feel horrible. And the house is the rest of my life. Hans says, imagine how good Rob Visions could be if he trained with Yannis and Ray for a year and
SPEAKER_02: God on Jews and gain weight. All these, all these what ifs, all these excuses. Rob's not his full potential, right? I got it. I got it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We, we need a arm wrestling worse, you know, different scenarios. What would happen? Yeah. What would happen? Oh my God. I will not say about Rob vision, but I have seen many people that told me personally, if I train as hard as you did,
SPEAKER_02: know i i would have won more titles this is yeah but i i if i train harder than uh michael jordan probably today you were talking about me like greatest of all times in basketball right right right that's yeah that's a good analogy you know how i wanted to start this this i just had if i just had parents that were basketball players i could have been
SPEAKER_02: Do you guys have the same saying that, you know, if your aunt had the balls, that would be your uncle or something? Yeah, yeah. Okay, yeah. If our aunt had wheels, she would be a boss. But I wanted to start this evening by saying good evening, LeBron and Michael. Okay, John, what's your chance? Let's go with the East versus West and finish because I don't want to take your time. I will keep you here as a prisoner for five hours. You know me. I will have mercy on you.
SPEAKER_00: all right your your chance versus zola in an object in a in a percentage way yeah
SPEAKER_00: Say honestly. I'm honestly hoping that I don't get shut out. I'm going into this thinking that I'm the favorite, maybe, hopefully, to win the first match, the second match. And I just hope that it's quick enough and aggressive enough that he doesn't stick me in a spot where I get fatigued.
SPEAKER_00: and get gas. I know that's a real honest possibility. I'm not saying that I'm not confident, but if I was objectively looking at it, I'm going to say Zolav 4-2. It's five rounds. Only five rounds? I got to win two. I'm going to say Zolav 3-2. I'm going to have to go back and figure it out and
SPEAKER_02: yeah yeah but don't don't don't be upset but i don't believe you okay yeah yeah i'm gonna have to be aggressive yeah quick and and then gennady versus michael
SPEAKER_00: From what I saw of Genadi and the struggles that he had with Ermes, but I have a hard time figuring out how strong Ermes is. That's why I question Kordesh's Alex's level. He might be the best on the planet right now. So I shouldn't let that affect my feeling towards Ermes. But yeah, no, Michael seems to be in very confident form. And if Michael's confident,
SPEAKER_00: i don't see him losing it might be a difficult match it might be a really long exciting match but for sure i think michael's going to prevail i understand you do you know sone from bulgaria who you're done you don't know him right no no and who's he pulling
SPEAKER_00: Who's he pulling? Oh, Hutchings. I can't bet against. Like I said, there's only a couple of guys that are super hard hitting enough, Prudnik maybe, Dave Chafee, that I would bet against Todd Hutchings. I will give you some. I don't care how strong he is. If he's slow, he's not going to beat Todd Hutchings. This guy is a deep hook puller, and he is not super, super explosive. But he is good, but yeah.
SPEAKER_02: He's not going to win then. It might take Todd a little extra time, but he's not going to win. There's absolutely no chance Yordan will top roll. I think no chance. And he's not like Rustam Bavaev, that explosive with the dominant hand. It's not. So the match is going to stop for sure. So you are saying no chance. Yeah. Yeah. And do you know, do you know Ertem Morozov? I don't. I know the name. I know the name.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, the 65 about right now is about 310. Wow, OK. And he's Cody. He pulls with Marcio Barbosa and Cody Merritt. And this guy looks like he won Dragon. OK, is he pulling Marcio or who is he pulling? Cody or Marcio? Marcio and Cody. Cody left, Marcio right. Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, big tall guys have a hard time with Marcio. Marcio is very dangerous with that. Well, Marcio is great in a hook and he gets a lot of people in a hook because he's got great high hand back pressure. So people try to hang on to him, try to control that back pressure and it ends up going inside. And yeah, yeah, it just depends on how if that guy, the tall guy,
SPEAKER_02: utilizes his height and keeps his hand high if he tries to you know set up low and hang on to marcio and marcio's tough to beat you know what's interesting about you john you don't know much about the atlas that you didn't really need to know like you understand like you know people that you pulled or you know people that who pull very
SPEAKER_02: you know like um how to say specifically the way around where you are and then it takes your attention other than that i see you you have never been curious
SPEAKER_00: who is doing what, where in the world. I haven't watched anything related to arm wrestling in the last four or five years. I'm playing catch up. I mean, the last five, even five, six months, I try to spend some time on social media and learn who these people are. I'm just amazed that you have such a ability to retain so many people and so many names. It's crazy. Nobody does that. Right now, you are at your best about knowing the Atlas because you are so much
SPEAKER_02: connected with social media. I think in the past, you were worser about the people. Yeah, I know, I know, for sure. You don't remember, right? 2004, Dream Team, the US Dream Team went to Zloty. You don't remember that, you know, the idea came from me on the Northeast message board that, you know, I said that US needs to, you know, make a team. And this is how you met Giorno, you, Mike Celeris, and Christopher Myers, and then Travis, you, and I think Chad Silvers, all together, you guys went there, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: You guys didn't know them. You didn't know, really, who Alexey Voevoda was. Well, yeah, that was back in the day where arm wrestling was still pretty new to Europe, right? I mean, well, I guess not. I guess they were kind of introduced to the sport. They started getting good in the mid-90s. So I guess they were seasoned arm wrestlers. But still, to me, they were still pretty young compared to what it is now, right? Yeah, I think when you are best in the world, you don't really care so much. Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: that this is my opinion about it yeah yeah it's just too much to to try to retain i i remember you versus alan carrera that you you grab him low and try to hook him and you flash and then in the final you topple him but you had a long match with eric urshiani eric before that one yeah yeah yeah he killed me yeah yeah he was like do you remember that match also you didn't have the wrist you also pull him with that way you both were like back pressure to back pressure and that was at those times
SPEAKER_00: We didn't see often you're pulling that way without the risk. Usually you dominate everything. Yeah. And directly was by far the strongest guy that day. If the situation was any way different, he would have, I would have won or he would have won. I mean, Alan wasn't at the level that I was or directly was we, we both kind of messed each other up that day. I truly believe that because after it wasn't that long before I had at
SPEAKER_02: had to go back and pull Alan. And I remember after a wreck lay, I was like rushed to the bathroom and my arm was under cold water trying to get that feeling back. I was like, oh my goodness, this is the end. You still cop rolled him. You still cop rolled him. And he was almost touching with his shoulder to your hand. You still did a great job. I think you were there about like 2.30. You know, at that time, when you are 2.30, you look like a tank. Now 2.30, you look normal. Like you are... Seriously.
SPEAKER_02: Your 2.20 now looks like your 2.09, you know, in the past, because I think your PET percentage is now a little bit higher than PET. Yeah, yeah, yeah. My lower body weight probably is a little, my legs were a little thinner when I was younger, I guess. So my upper body looked a little bigger. Yeah, yeah. Anyway, so you want to ask anything, Ramos? We don't want to keep John long time. Yeah, Bob, finishing question.
SPEAKER_00: you have anything left on your arm wrestling bucket list maybe a person or a match that you want to have or couldn't have no i get well i mean if that question was asked a couple days ago i think when i was talking to ryan and um i guess i'm getting getting probably caught up a little bit into the social media thing so when people start talking and and and i get interested in the trash talk and some of the the hype and stuff um
SPEAKER_00: that gets me riled up, I guess, and that gets me excited. So like lately, because of all the, you know, the little, you know, negative stuff and, you know, this, that, and the other, and criticism from Rob, that's kind of the guy that I, but I told myself when he kind of balked and said, I need to,
SPEAKER_00: climb a few more or jump a few more hurdles. And who was I to be, you know, I'm like, all right, dude, I'm just never, ever going to pull you again. It's never going to happen no matter what, but now I'm still, I get, get back caught up in it. Like, I just want to just, just, just embarrass him, just shut him up. So, but yeah, so that'll probably be what prompts me to, you know, have any super matches or future matches. So if you want to have a match with me, you just need to talk trash on,
SPEAKER_02: on Facebook and from like all those years like I have not seen single person talk negative about you I'm talking about like 30 years but now on social media I see people folks some of the people folks disrespectful it is it really bothers me it really bothers me I would understand someone talking negative about me
SPEAKER_00: But it works. It works. It works. And it's fun. And I think it's great for a promotion. And I accept it. It doesn't bother you. It doesn't bother you. You don't see it like a headache. Oh, why did I come again? I giggle and I understand it. And it does affect me. It gets me riled up. But it's in a positive way. It's like, you know, it's like, oh, that's good. That's good. I was worried about that. You were disturbed about it. Although some of the disrespected, you know, you know, people, you know, just.
SPEAKER_02: John Gerstle, Like like you are like crying about this or crying about rules or crying about it's not about like that, I mean like people, people should have like more respect, you know because I mean it's not because i'm saying this to your face. John Gerstle, But like 90% of the top atlas that people see around you know they are inspired by you john seriously, this is, I mean.
SPEAKER_02: I think that they should just show you, everyone should show you the respect. But if it is motivating you, if it's helping you, then I'm more than fine. I thought that maybe you were thinking that I don't deserve this. And then, oh, like, no. It doesn't affect me in that way. It actually makes me laugh sometimes when I read stuff. I think, oh, OK, thanks. Thank you. That's great information. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Appreciate that, that enlightenment. Yeah, thank you. Thank you very much, John. You want to say anything last word? No, I'm just super excited.
