SPEAKER_01: Hello, guys. Hey, Ingen. Hey, hey, hey. How are you, Cobra? I'm well, brother. How are you? I'm trying to be okay. I think there is a small problem with Ivan's sound. Yeah, it's just audio. And then all will be fine. Hello, Derek. How are you? What's up, Ingen? Cobra, my boy. Good to see you.
SPEAKER_01: Big D. How's it going, y'all? Woke up, had to work last night at the club, and we're here. Yep. Very, very good to see you guys. Legend, Cobra. Yes, sir. The one that inspired the inside of arm wrestling more than anyone else in 90s. Yep. Yep, the man.
SPEAKER_01: Whenever he was walking around, you know, in the venue of the WAF, then everyone was pointing, you know, this guy, you know. But the new generation doesn't know him. And it said, you know, it said, I wish they knew more than they would understand what I'm talking about. So how is everything, Cobra? You never get old. What's going on with you? Hey, Andrew. Just...
SPEAKER_02: just doing my thing, you know, I'm, I'm really enjoying what I'm, what I'm seeing with arm wrestling, you know, it's really, it's really, it's really awesome. You know, like when it's funny, when, when I was, when I was an arm wrestler, like I was just myself, you know, and some, there was some people always little factions in the arm wrestling world that had jealousy thinking, you know what I'm talking about? And they always, they tried to shut you down and.
SPEAKER_02: say things about you or something that uh very you know unhealthy unhealthy words but now i see like people doing all sorts of crazy and outlandish things and i'm like right on it's it's just great you know just to see i'm wrestling in this light to see that more people more people are chalking up and um and now even the haters are welcome so it's i mean ever everything
SPEAKER_02: Uh, everything pours into that one cup of, uh, of, uh, coffee that we are. And I'm, I'm, I'm just excited as hell for arm wrestlers and the future of arm wrestling and the present. That's awesome. That's awesome. I mean, don't, don't get me wrong. I sure wish, I sure wish I was a good arm wrestler. Cause I would sure as hell be it. I mean, I mean, it became so popular, you know, it's still becoming more and more.
SPEAKER_01: You know, it was like after our time, you know, we can say, but, but still, you know, we gave our life and then there is no way that, you know, we would be jealous of the current young guys. You know, we only feel happy for them, you know, because they have been going through, uh, what we had been going through, but now they have more opportunity and happy for them. You know, I.
SPEAKER_01: people consider me as like one of the best in the history. But whenever I look at, when I organize an arm wrestling, I never see like whenever Istanbul event will happen, then I will be seeing like superstars, you know, like I won't be seeing like, you know, I don't know. I look at, I will look at those guys and I will be like same as how I was when I was very young. Those times that we were watching you, like Sharon and John and Rambet, all those guys.
SPEAKER_01: Now I will still have the same excitement, you know, whenever I look at them, then I will be seeing now. John will come and Cody will be here, Sona will be here, you know, I don't know, Michael, Todd, Genadi, it's like still, you know, Ewan, can you talk if it's fixed or not? We have, you know, it's just connecting. Yeah, still connecting. I think there is something wrong with Ewan's camera, but I don't know what it is, you know, so, and,
SPEAKER_04: Derek, you have been feeling very strong. I have been following you quietly. Yeah, man. Hutchings are going well. Prep is going good for my Tim match on the 29th. I think prep's going well. So I'm as big and strong as I've ever been and as strong where I want to be strong for Tim.
SPEAKER_01: So we got a little bit left. Yeah, things are going well. Definitely an all-time massive biggest guy. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, it will be a very good test for you, you know, to pull versus team to see where you are right now. Yes, sir. Yeah, yeah. And Ivan, can you talk? Hello, everyone. Nice to see you.
SPEAKER_01: yeah very nice to see as well it was difficult to turn the sound on uh my first time in zoom sorry no i always okay as long as you are with us you know it's good we would only feel sad that you know you couldn't join us yeah yeah we were like talking about the the you know like cobra uh like from the 90s his prime you know maybe eight ladies early 2000s and
SPEAKER_01: Now armwrestling is becoming much more popular, but it is not our time. But still, you know, we are very happy to see the other armwrestlers are having good opportunities. And so this is what we are talking about. And then we were talking about Derek, how he's going to do versus Tim. When is it exactly? End of this month? Yeah, January 29th. Wow. I heard Tim is in also good shape, huh?
SPEAKER_04: i mean he was getting ready for prudnik and so um you know he just kind of kept it going getting ready for me so yeah yeah yeah well it's good i want the strongest version of tim anyway i don't want to i don't want the fluke if i can help it although he's getting a little bit older no sensible yeah yeah yeah cobra have you been following you know the the the the news from the uh event that i'm you know organizing east west yes
SPEAKER_02: I've been watching a little bit. But actually, like, the only thing I've been watching, like, the last three days is what's going on in Kazakhstan. I've been reaching out to my guys over there, and I haven't gotten any response. So I'm super worried about the people over there. And I understand that the Internet has gone kaput. So I'm really praying and thinking about those people there. Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_01: arm wrestling hasn't it's kind of taken the back seat to yeah yeah the people of kazakhstan provocation is a terrible thing you know once once you just like lose yourself then then once everything is done you know you look at and then you look at the round and you say like okay what have i done you know just like the things should be uh fixed with more like common sense you know but it is um looks like it's out of control there but
SPEAKER_01: They say that this is now controlled. I don't exactly know what's going on there, but soon we will know. I think some countries also send soldiers there to control the situation. Yes, Russia, Turkey. We have two representatives here.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, we have a close relationship with Kazakhstan, but I think there is some other organization that they ask for help, you know, but I don't exactly remember each country. Okay, so you feel like you would like to talk about armnesting or not? That's why you are here, right? Yes, I will talk about armnesting, yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know, I know, I know, because you were like,
SPEAKER_01: Uh, maybe you won't, you won't feel so much because of what's happening in Kazakhstan. No, no, no, no, no. I can talk about arm wrestling or cooking. Arm wrestling and cooking. Yeah. Yeah. Anyways. Okay. Let, let, let, let, let's start from Derek. Okay. There. Yeah. Uh, what, what, what's the match that is, uh, taking your attention the most? Um, East West card.
SPEAKER_01: But listen, this is the top side is the East versus West, but there are also some other matchups as well, you know, that very, very, yeah, because they are both from the East. So I cannot list them on the East versus West, but it's still very high level match. Like, for example, Arif Ertem versus Ermes Gasparini and some others, you know, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: um the uh last night i got home from work and i was so worried about coming on here and not like and not maybe completely knowing who someone is or anything like that that i spent probably an extra hour and a half to two hours going over all the names i wasn't 100 sure so i made sure i watched all the videos and i did my homework on on each person but i wasn't lost i could be in the conversation
SPEAKER_04: um i'm sure i'm sure that you know many of them even without doing some search yeah yeah no i knew i knew most of them but there was just a couple people i wanted to refresh on like i haven't people haven't really studied too much and then the ladies to be honest uh i definitely needed a refresher on some of the ladies and how they pull um but i guess um
SPEAKER_04: I'm really interested in seeing Oleg pull with, I don't want to say his name wrong, Betkili? Betkili Onyan, yeah. Yeah, that seems like it's going to be a wild match for sure. Seeing Yousef pull, your student, I'm really excited to see that because I think Oleg is amazing. So I'm really excited to see Yousef pull. On the East-West card specifically,
SPEAKER_04: um i i want to see where uh morozov's at i'm really excited to see what him crack into the top and see because i have a lot of respect for cody merritt obviously you know he's from where i'm at where i'm around and i think cody's been he's also been trying to even though he's number one in north america he's still trying to prove himself in some way so i love seeing cody compete left-handed and i can't even imagine
SPEAKER_04: anybody doing stuff with him so like trying to beat him so uh i'm really excited to see where he stands and i've recently tested myself with him kinda at a left-handed event so i kind of i'm interested in seeing him pull with uh with morsoff as well yeah and and and uh first of all i want to say something here i i heard i didn't watch it but uh people call me
SPEAKER_01: I think Pradeep told me that, you know, Trevor said that if Engin is inviting you to Turkey to pull, you can be sure that he's calling you for an asswhip or something. You know, he said, you know, it's just he's out of his mind. You know, like, like, like, like, for example, I will I wrote already on Facebook. I want to explain that, you know, like, for example, for Kata Chinks, Ivan knows that, you know, I was thinking either Ivan or this, I don't know.
SPEAKER_01: Ivan and Deserano are very close at WAF. But Deserano quit pulling at WAF, and then he chose to go pro, and he's 120 or over. So it is normal that I think that Deserano now may be stronger than Ivan. So I sent these two names to Katachins, and Kat said, you know, I want the stronger one, you know, because he is much heavier. So we even talked that Deserano possibly can top roll
SPEAKER_01: So, and Ivan said that, you know, he has some, I think elbow issues. Did you say elbow that you don't feel like ready a hundred percent, Ivan? Yes, you're right. You're right. Yeah. So, so Ivan couldn't pull. So we, we choose Tsonev, a hundred two kilo. I asked him his weight. So, I mean, I don't think that, you know, I'm calling Tatachins here to pull to Tsonev for an ass kicking or something, you know, I don't think that anyone who is going inside,
SPEAKER_01: Tatachins and he is in the same way as Tatachins, I don't think that that person is a favorite. Other than that, for example, I'm going to invite Morozov here. If it is East versus West, I mean, Morozov's left is great, but Morozov is not the best left-handed in the world. He is not like, you know, the Latin level or Levan level. So if you would bring Morozov here, who would you choose from the West?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, you have, you have our best guy right now. I mean, I'm just, this is what I try to say. Like, if you are, if I brought Zola event, Tata Shinks, was it a bad matchup? Tata Shinks, Zola was incredible. Tata before beat him 6-0, you know? And, and so Tata Shinks, Zola won. So if Zola won, so, and if you're going to bring John Brzenk, who would you set? You know, Zola, of course you're going to set Zola, you know, with John Brzenk, if you are trying to determine,
SPEAKER_01: The best guy around that weight class. So, I mean, all of them like this. Like, for example, Chance versus Sandris. I didn't even say that much. Chance chose Sandris to pull. Schoolboy versus Evan. I didn't even know. I was thinking Travis versus Schoolboy. You know, because Travis is not in like super, super, super, super shape. So, I thought that it would be good, you know, for them to pull each other right now. But without me knowing, they were chatting somewhere in a group.
SPEAKER_01: And then Alex, schoolboy's brother, challenged Devan. And then he said, okay, let's go. And then, okay, he said, contact Engin. And then that's how I said. So they make it sound like Ranbet versus Zurab. I asked Ran, he said he's 112 kilo. Zurab is 85 kilo pull. He said he's 97 kilo now. I don't think it's a bad matchup either. So, I mean, I did it as much as balanced as possible. So Travis is...
SPEAKER_04: daydreaming you know don't let travis i mean i think i think no no no no you agree with me i don't want the tough matches we want the tough matches since i've been watching our guys go out there and get their butts kicked lately i've been training so hard it's inspired me to train so hard are you kidding me and that's what that's the best thing out of it you don't want the easy matches but derek you know it's but people the other americans or north americans may watch travels and thinking oh is it real you know so i need to explain this so that
SPEAKER_01: I know Travis, I don't know what he really believes or not, but this is the fact, you know. So, Ivan, what do you think about the East versus West, you know, like generally, like do you find it exciting? Yes, the matches are great, really. And most of them unpredictable and perhaps
SPEAKER_01: the strength is rather close of this pose. So, really interesting. And which matches are you the most curious about the outcome? I mean, Arif's elbow here hurts. This guy is strong. Did you beat him? No. No? No. I can give him very good forearm training.
SPEAKER_00: You know what I mean. His wrist, pronator, everything. I can train him very good. But when it comes to the pinning, it's not that easy. Actually, the most interesting match for me is Tsonev against Todd Hutchings. Because I think that in this match, we'll find out the best hooker in the world. Perhaps not the absolute best, but one of the very best.
SPEAKER_00: And this is hard. It's very difficult to predict who will win. Yeah, but I will ask you something. You said maybe not the best, but just think about this way. Have we seen Tatachins losing in hook, in a slow hook, someone at his weight lately? I don't remember. No, no, but I think that the best hooker perhaps was Denis Siplenkov.
SPEAKER_00: No, no, no, no, about his weight, his weight. Then maybe Dave Chaffee. Then perhaps Todd Hutchings and... I'm talking about Tatachin's own weight. In this weight, perhaps Todd Hutchings, Rustam Babaev, Krishimir Kostadinov, Sonif, maybe... Have you seen Tatachin losing in a...
SPEAKER_00: slow hook. Rustam pins him before Todd even realizes what happened, you understand? It was also hook. I would say that Rustam was better in hook. Perhaps Rustam is not comfortable for Todd
SPEAKER_01: perhaps yes yes because because just think this way do you believe that if rustam and hutchings you like slow start do you think that rustam can be because rustam beats him like like this before tad even position because i know zolev beats rustam in hook if zolev's elbow is okay usually he beats him you know but but but uh tatashins zolev can't really uh do something to talk in hook you know
SPEAKER_00: i think that there are different types of hookers and uh the love type sony type is comfortable for uh hutchings uh but rustam type and perhaps my type if i um uh if i um start well uh i'm not comfortable yes because i can take perhaps the phase the necessary phase
SPEAKER_01: Yes, but if he stops, he may beat everyone, I think. Yes, that's what I'm saying. Strength-wise, since Tsonev is not like a flash pinner, then I think that Hutchings will be able to apply what he has versus him. That is why it is very hard for Tsonev. But you remember, we were chatting and we were thinking that together, that Bogoslav probably will beat Tsonev.
SPEAKER_01: And he is, you said, about 110 kilos, near 110 kilos for Boguslov. And I remember that guy, even when he was 85 kilos, he was so dangerous. And 110 kilos for Boguslov, he just moved. And then somehow, he stopped him. But the way that he applies the pressure is more forward in the tricep, that way forward, while Hutchings is side and dragging. So it will be a difference in Denden-Boguslov match.
SPEAKER_00: yes and perhaps uh hutchings um will be more dangerous for sony because of the vector right he will pull diagonally can i add something real quick yeah yeah yvonne when you're listing the best hook pullers in the world please add yourself on the list as well you know something one is one of the strongest
SPEAKER_01: especially at his weight. Yeah. But about hook inability, he might have been the best, you know, because of that tall forearms, and long reach, and that the speed, the speed, not only the speed of body, but his hand and hand speed, you know, just I mean,
SPEAKER_01: uh very very very dangerous well i think that i'm not the best in this uh maybe after rustam rustam is better because he does the same but he has a much smaller hand yeah maybe pound for pound he is but i i don't know if it is not pound for pound then your hook inability is incredible yeah yeah and cobra do you you you if you check the list uh
SPEAKER_02: Is there any match that takes your attention more than others or a few? Zoloev. Zoloev versus John? Yes. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm curious to see if John will go inside. I think Zoloev wants to go inside with John. Inside or outside? Inside. Oh, inside. I think Zoloev wants to catch John inside, but I don't think John wants to go inside. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_01: Did you have a chance to see their match from A1 2015? Whenever Zoloev tried to top roll, John had very easy time, you know, very easy time. And whenever Zoloev went inside, I don't know if John wanted to feel his hook or not. He catch him and then he beat him from there. But since that time, Zoloev kind of improved his outside skill more, especially without the trap. But that is how he beat Akashins, in my opinion.
SPEAKER_01: zola won 100 percent fair and square versus touching and some people says hutchings was stronger but he made a mistake that's different thing they pulled and zola won parents square zola is better i don't care if the match doesn't have to be in the strap or something the strap is needed for our messing when the hands slip from each other if your hand is strong enough
SPEAKER_01: not to allow your opponent to sleep and then then it is it's over you know you just you just don't need to add anything but i don't think that zola can control john without the step because unlike cod john is very very good about you know he even sleep from the hands of alan carrer of course he's not the same john but still you know and he would he is you know he i'm sure that john will uh
SPEAKER_01: survive his pronator is much stronger and then they will go i agree with you that that he will try to go inside but he may have some elbow issues remember that that night that we were talking uh after the war finished the same night after right-hand competition remember at the hotel lobby he won you russians were sitting and i came and i asked you know zolev you know how his elbow will be and he said that he it will be fine you know then later i asked him uh through arsenal
SPEAKER_02: And Arsene said that he will be ready, you know. He will be ready without any problems. And, yeah, and what's your opinion about that match? You said that Cobra Zola was going to go inside, right? That's what I think. That's what I think, but we'll just have to see. That's the match I'm most curious about what happens and how it goes down. Because, yeah, as you said, I wholeheartedly agree. He absolutely dominated Todd Hutchings when he pulled him.
SPEAKER_02: didn't matter if it was what style they were pulling strap no strap he absolutely gave him a lesson in arm wrestling so i see if i want to see if he takes that momentum and goes after the goat with the same with the same piss and vinegar you know yeah but as i said you know he is like i i think that you know zolev is incredible is he yeah greatest one of the greatest and maybe pound for pound
SPEAKER_01: one or a few, you know. But like, for example, John Poole versus Dimitri Kashan and that guy, like, for example, do you think that he won? Zola has better outside skill than Dimitri Kashan. I really don't think so. No way. No way. I mean, what I'm just saying that if Dimitri Kashan wasn't able to beat John with that arm height and with the top role skill,
SPEAKER_01: then I really can't see Zola beating John with an outside move. Yeah, I mean, without the step, I'm sure he will give him some trouble. But once he goes step, I don't see him. So the only way I see Zola go strap and then hook John. And then we will see if John will be able to beat him inside or he will try to avoid inside or something. I just don't know. Yeah, I really don't know.
SPEAKER_02: That's an exciting match to me, just to see. You have $100. Where are you betting? $50 on John, $50 on me. Wait, you're going to lose $50? But I'm curious how John's... I mean, John's a champion, so I'm sure he can lick his wounds. But, you know, after that,
SPEAKER_02: ass whooping he took from Devin, let's just see where his momentum is. I mean, Zoloev, I just love the family. You know, I've known the family for 30 years. You know what I mean? So Kazbek and Madbek, I'm just, I'm a big Zoloev fan.
SPEAKER_01: but you are also john brzing fan a little bit yes yes of course of course of course everybody that uh that chalks up has to uh give respect to john of course yeah yeah yeah yeah yep and and derek what's your opinion about this match if we go into the details of the matches um
SPEAKER_04: I mean, I don't, I, I, I've never pulled as all of, uh, only know from the videos and things I've seen, you know, um, I have pulled with John fairly recently. Um, his.
SPEAKER_04: His hand, his ability to cup through his palm and his pronation, especially when inside and able to pivot his elbow, still feels like it felt to me when we pulled years, years ago. It still feels fresh when he's able to drive off that elbow and pronate, it still feels amazing to me. I mean, I think Devin barely got away on round one.
SPEAKER_04: uh you know and that was supposed to be one of the top guys you know in the world right now so i think john's at a really good level uh obviously zolo's at an amazing level uh after what he did with with todd um and stuff like that showing his outside ability which shocked us all uh and uh so i'm excited i think uh i think john's gonna be john is what's the weight at that that that's the thing 225 so john will be 25 pounds lighter than
SPEAKER_01: Dubai but the thing is John really really really pushed himself to be 250 you know like like not super healthy way you understand it is when I said well the way that I saw very unnecessary like water I I think that 235 or something he feels good I think did he not pull Pauline at 225
SPEAKER_01: I believe it was somewhere around there. I know Paul Wynn was about 225. Yeah, this is what I heard. In the last moment, if they made an agreement about 230, maybe. But I think they were like 225. So here will be 225 too. And I am 100% sure next day when they pull, John will be over 230. This is what I believe. And Zola will still be maximum 210, you know.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I know John recently said that one of the biggest problems and the hardest things for him now in this return is his ability to weight, fluctuating the weight and cutting weight and stuff, especially cutting weight. So I'm wondering, hopefully that doesn't take too much out of him heading into this. Hopefully he didn't deplete himself too much going into this. I know he was worried about that. He's been very, very loud about the weight cut.
SPEAKER_01: uh affecting him so uh but i mean i still i'm obviously i'm gonna lean i'm gonna lean with john i always i always back uh back the goat uh so i'll i'll go for john uh in this match yeah well by the way i talked with him some days ago he was 235. so he has he has uh probably the time that yeah he has about like five weeks and he is he's 235. and i think the last a few pounds will be maybe some water water loss yeah this is yeah
SPEAKER_01: yeah and don just has to like drink a few less beers that's all he'll be okay yeah it's hard man he's living the life on his boat in arizona and and uh what's your uh opinion about this match like how do you think that it could go and how would it happen if it goes that way or this way or that way all possibilities
SPEAKER_00: Let's see if we are thinking similar or not. Unfortunately for Hadji, I do not see any possibilities for him in this match. You don't see Hadji has no chance to win? No chance, no. He has no weapons against John because John is very good against hookers. He's a top-roll pronator bait.
SPEAKER_00: Hadji's top roll is not that good. So, no way. The only advantage is weight, but perhaps to beat John, they should pull at 68 or something like that. You know, I will tell you something. Do you agree that people who have good hand, wrist, like this control, like good forearm,
SPEAKER_01: has like, don't have like super chance versus John. Like mostly the people who has incredible horsepower, killing horsepower, that they have better chance. Because when I say like, if like, for example, I'm good about the hand wrist control, but like, I'm not like a, like incredible killer about the pressure. So, but what is good with me is even better with John, you understand? You play in his game, you understand?
SPEAKER_01: the the forearm hand control game with him so um like uh haji murad is not known like like if if john was putting rushton baba now then i would think different because that guy has a killer pressure or
SPEAKER_01: krasimir costadino his wrist is uh stronger he's much stronger yeah yeah and they have better pressure to do to do like to they are more attacking john's arm in a pressure way unlike zolev is also good in hook but he's doing most of the things with his wrist flexor and forearm control so john's forearm is stronger than like you can't really play games with with john about the the
SPEAKER_01: a hand control forearm you know strength you need more of horsepower this is my opinion you know but that is like people like me people like very low chance you know this is what i believe agree yeah and and you are saying that john is the clear favorite how about you don't think that zolev can hook john in strap and beat him
SPEAKER_00: I think that even in hook, now John is better because judging with first round with Devon showed that he has very strong side pressure. Imagine that Devon was also going back. Going outside against someone who is going back and going outside against someone who is coming inside.
SPEAKER_02: may not be the same exact thing remember the the second round of the pauline match that pauline forced the match inside and the hook john uh i think that uh john improved since that okay that pauline match i'll tell you what that pauline he he doesn't quit does he he he went for it every second that he had
SPEAKER_02: I mean, you don't pass up that chance. You throw yourself at it. Yeah, he jumped right into the fire, even in losing. He gave 110% every second of that. I enjoyed watching that, watching a young man try to climb a mountain. That was exciting for me. Yeah, that is a big growth. Super, Chad, thank you for that. And can you share how great Cobra was in his prime?
SPEAKER_01: Okay, how does this compare to all your opponents over the years? Like, I will explain to you Cobra this way. Cobra, I will only give one example. Cobra in 1999 Waffles in Vlad Kavkaz beat three of the legendary Russian pullers.
SPEAKER_01: I think one of them is Ivan's coach, Alex Mundishvili. The other one is Shamil Karajev. And other one is Genadi... Fardinov. Fardinov. Fardinov. I don't know why I said Genadi. Genadi Fardinov. Yeah, Genadi is his first name. Genadi Fardinov. These three names...
SPEAKER_01: was still the young years of uh gennady but cobra went there to russia to pull up and told these guys in fact all these three guys are uh russians but they made also gennady i think representing azerbaijan or something i don't know how they did that and they gave cobra all these three russians one after another and and cobra i watched the videos he beat
SPEAKER_01: all of them he won and then in the super heavyweights there was wakkan yawa hadze he even has wins over alan kare and he in in a overall championship he even gave him a he's about like what's near 200 kilograms probably 170 80 minimum and he even took his wrist and then yawa hadze was like this and then finally won like this
SPEAKER_01: And so I'm sure people from Russia would know more about Cobra stories than people from the US. I'm sure even people or sometimes from Russia, they were just training only for Cobra. Am I wrong, Ivan? I'm sure even you heard it.
SPEAKER_00: Yes, you're right. When I came to arm wrestling in 1999, my first coach took second place to Andrew. And for one or two years, almost every workout I heard about Cobra. Alex wanted to take revenge to go to the United States. In 2000, there was a world championship there, but he didn't get a visa, unfortunately.
SPEAKER_01: And that was his dream to take revenge. Yeah. And there was another super chat from Caroline. Thank you for that. Did you find someone to pull Yanis yet? Nope. I'm still, I wrote, you know, and I'm still waiting someone to step up and pull Yanis if they want. And salamun alaykum. Yes, I'm Alan.
SPEAKER_01: What's that? Giannis. Yeah. You want to pull him? No, I already pulled him. I'm good. Okay. If we go to the next one, Michael Todd versus Genadi Kubikwinia. I see this match as like, as I wrote, two wounded lions, you know? They both are dreaming to become the best, but on that way, they are, how to say,
SPEAKER_01: they just lost one match, you know, Michael lost versus Devon and then Genadi lost versus Ermes Gasparini. And these two guys are also very active on social media. And they have followers and those followers really believe in them. And I kind of think that is their followers will not like
SPEAKER_01: uh, them to lose twice in a row. So, and I see Genadi, you know, after many years of coming back, I didn't see him wild enough that he usually has been. And now after that match time to time, I chat with him.
SPEAKER_01: he looks crazy he said he's ready he's just gonna i mean give his everything and i i there will be a war you know i'm telling you guys there will be war and i i'm i'm planning to ref some of the matches but i'm not gonna regret that match you know just the horsepower that i will see there will probably i will not like it i need to watch it a little bit from far you know not that close you know and okay what are your opinions that they're like you you can start you know
SPEAKER_04: um man um obviously mike's a good buddy of mine and uh gannadi is oh i've always said is like one of my top three favorite pullers to watch arm wrestle um because because gannadi's always um to me been very explosive but also been very versatile i've seen him go all over the table from in to out you know and everywhere in between and so him going into the enemies match um i i had i had him picked
SPEAKER_04: as the favorite a ton because i figured people have said what if aramis took his hand i was like well then he'll flop we've seen him flop we've seen him flop against tim we've seen him go flop press not a big deal and uh and he didn't end up doing that and so i'm i know uh i'm assuming you know he read into that and he's like you know i don't know the reasoning why why he wasn't able to um but that kind of seemed weird to me because i always saw him as someone
SPEAKER_01: that i i just did an interview with him and he said that he was before he was hurt injured and it was a mental thing that he he didn't want to do this but after after fourth round he he just if he realized that he did this way sideways but he still didn't push forward because he wasn't so and then fifth and sixth rounds he tried this and he said that he realized that it wasn't hurting
SPEAKER_01: understand but mentally psychologically he said that he was so afraid that he would hurt and now he's more confident because he saw that it is not hurting him so i but i told him like
SPEAKER_04: were you not a little bit late you know you try and 15 six round but not before you know and he said yeah he was he was kind of late yeah sorry about it i just want to do uh no no that's great that's that's great to hear yeah because i would say like i don't know him going into mike match if he doesn't have the you know that mindset or the capability to go inside or take it where it needs to go then then he would diminish uh my my the potential for the match i think uh but assuming he's
SPEAKER_04: Full fledged, going everywhere and being everything he can be. This match is super exciting for me. And I know Mike's trying to come back off the loss from Devin and he has a lot to prove and he wants to climb and get that shot at LeVon as well. So it's a really interesting match to me. I've been trying to think in my head about who to predict to win.
SPEAKER_04: i just don't know i can't figure it out it's so 50 50 in my head um you know i based off the
SPEAKER_04: honestly, I can't even break it down. Like, um, as far, as far as former technique like that, it'll just be based off momentum. And, uh, and I think that Mike has been building momentum in the background right now and getting ready. Um, and Genadi just got off a loss more recently, so maybe he's trying to get it back up. So I'm going to go with Mike, uh, on this one, everybody's going to give me so much flack for picking the United States guys. Okay. But I'm gonna go with Mike. I'm gonna go with Mike. Okay. Cobra. I
SPEAKER_02: I think if people haven't pulled Michael Todd, they, they, they're starting with a deficit because of that funky little thing that he does. But, uh, they're not, of course, cannot, he's a savage, uh, I think, uh, much more, uh, well-rounded arm wrestler, but Mike, you know, you can call him a one trick pony, but that one trick that he has is he's, he's grown his body into a, uh,
SPEAKER_01: place where it's it's very effective as we've seen by a lot of people so but i i'd say the favorite and that matches michael but michael is no way one way puller you know michael no no no oh no he can jump inside like cobra you know michael better than all of us even from the 90s that whenever he was not doing this you know he was this this this he could
SPEAKER_01: He is one of the person that you bring to do like one centimeter to pin pad and still
SPEAKER_01: can't be relaxed yeah no way no way i have seen him holding holding rambat like this that that open and rambat is with shoulder on him like this and he is holding like i am i know how much pressure rambat i'm talking about the rambat from like 12 13 years ago you know when he was still you know still he's very good but even probably better you know when he was maybe 40s and then he was holding like this
SPEAKER_01: and i was like how the hell you know like how can you hold the rambes shoulder pressure like that that open you know just like can you imagine yourself there in the position someone's knocking at my door i'll be right back yeah so you are you are giving the uh favor to michael
SPEAKER_02: Michael Todd for sure. Yeah. Yeah. He's so big and strong right now that he's tough to beat. And I mean, you saw what kind of Devon it took to, I mean, I'd never seen him dominated like that, the way that Devon did, but that, that was a, that was an insane Devon as well. That was insane. There was no doubt. Yeah. In my opinion,
SPEAKER_01: whenever I asked Michael, like Michael, you know, are you sure that you're saying that you are in your best ever shape? And then he said, yes. And, but whenever I saw those practice videos that, you know, his hand is just taking even like many, many, even some of the not heavyweight guys during the trainees was putting in bad positions, you know? And I was like, you know, I really, I wrote openly that, you know, at the time I and Devon, we were not talking to each other, but I said that, you know,
SPEAKER_01: And then Michael wrote me, you know, based on what, you know, you say this. And I said, I don't think that your riser front is what I call will handle, you know, when you go back pressure to back pressure versus that one. Because I saw your wrist didn't feel that good, you know, during the practice videos, either you're pretending or I don't know what it is, but I really didn't think. And this exactly how it happened that day. And Ivan, what's your opinion about this match?
SPEAKER_00: Well, I think that Genadi can win only with triceps, with perhaps dead wrist shoulder press, only if he is able to play it. And if they pull like Genadi pulled Ermes with open hand, perhaps Michael is better in this kind of pulling.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, you said that Genadi can win only with the shoulder pressure. I think both of them will finish that way. I kind of bring that. I mean, I see. Do you see like any of them is just winning in a different way? I think one will bring here and then press that way. This is how Michael finishes. But I mean, I don't know. Do you see it in different way finishing? Well, it matters who first plays.
SPEAKER_01: this good uh triceps uh tricep pressure i think the bot like the one who takes here to the winning position close and then goes behind the hand and the shoulder pressure i think that i think the boat will i mean have this is the best option i can see you know yeah but if gennady somehow stays in like this here i think michael is gonna finish him
SPEAKER_01: Genadi better keep Michael at this side of the table. Once he goes here, it takes like one second Michael to bring his shoulder in, you know. And Ermes was able to press. Of course, Ermes had the full and wrist control. But Michael, even with a dead wrist, can apply minimum the pressure that Ermes applied to Genadi, you know. I think that Michael's shoulder pressure is even stronger than Ermes'. This is my opinion.
SPEAKER_02: And what do you think, Cobra, about that? You were saying something. I cut you off. I believe like early in this match. What is it? Six? Six matches? Rounds? Yeah. It's best of five. The one who comes to three. A race to three. Race to three. Yeah. You know, I've seen Michael in a lot of these matches with guys that are coming here and surviving on the dark side with this move.
SPEAKER_02: after one match, maybe two matches, things have burned out on Michael's opponent. And then like the next rounds, Michael on go can just go right inside on his shoulder and there's nothing from his opponent. So that that's, so no, you know, I'm not saying that Michael is a one trick pony. I'm saying that one trick that he has is deadly. Yes. And the gas that it takes out of someone's tank.
SPEAKER_01: You can't assimilate that and practice what Michael Todd does to your attitude and your arm. One 40-second match with him can change your life. Yes, yes, very, very dangerous opponent, yeah. The only thing is about the Genadi, like, whenever I see, like, I am, like, I have never been intimidated by the physical look, but there are times that I have been intimidated
SPEAKER_01: by the person's mind and dedication. And when we look at these two guys, woo, they are like, I mean, warriors, warriors, warriors. And Genadi, if Genadi would put Michael in Dubai that day, I think it would be not so hard for Michael to win. But after that, now Genadi has
SPEAKER_01: nothing to lose, you understand? He has to go there and die at the table. When I say die, you know what I mean. He is everything there, you know. And that guy is also a very brave guy. And he said that you will see old Genadi, not the one in Dubai. And then whenever I see, like, I don't see neither of the guys losing in mind, you know. They are both very dedicated in the mind, and that's the dangerous part, you know.
SPEAKER_01: there is one guy super chat see this guy wrote something the other day i thought it was me and i was like when did i write this you know engine there's the enigma of age because not the rage but the age so i was like like he he he took the same exact except the the instead of rage he said age east versus west card is incredible nice job thank you engine there is it anyway so if if we go to do the next one
SPEAKER_01: I will start first with Ivan Matyushenko. I think that he is more knowledgeable about this than my other two guests because he has been pulling with these guys in the same competition for like many years now, right? Like seven, eight years you have been in.
SPEAKER_00: same exact computations you know above europeans every year with these guys that these guys never met each other what do you think you want i think it's very interesting match but some people think it's a mismatch that oleg is going to kill him what do you think um yes that's a good match hook against chopro i think uh he uses hook right only hook i think yeah and he has but the main weapon is inside
SPEAKER_00: and he has very high level so i think he will have chances to hook Oleg and i think you also remember they pulled after table maybe several years ago but i think in that particular fight Betkili's wrist was curved and now they will pull straight wrist
SPEAKER_01: Yes, yes. Do you remember in the competition Oleg was 85 kilos and Betkili was 75 kilos. Now Betkili is 90 kilos. He was a junior, right? I think it was maybe the first year of his senior. I think it finished. But he was 75 kilos. Now he will be 90 kilos. 90? Yeah, he's 90 kilos now. I talked with his teammates. They said that when he's 90 kilos, he's a different human being.
SPEAKER_01: and yeah so there are some positive sides and negative sides from the training video that you remember from 2018 bulgaria european championships yeah so it may be an upset for alex yeah it can be there's a possibility right there's a possibility yes yeah yeah perhaps in one weight uh in 80 kilograms
SPEAKER_01: Perhaps Oleg would be the favorite. But now, who knows? As I said, as you said, 80 kilos, yeah, Oleg is the favorite. But whenever this guy, and remember, this guy is 190-something tall. You know, he's like 190, so the more he gets heavier, the better for that guy, you understand?
SPEAKER_01: for Oleg will not matter that much. I don't know how much heavier but he said that I think he said they said like his coach told me he will he will be 85 kilo or something. Yeah. And what do you think Derek about this match? I'm gonna go with the Betkili. I'm gonna take the I think the underdog was he would he be considered the underdog in this? I'm either way. 99% of the people says he is underdog. If you ask me,
SPEAKER_01: either underdog or 50-50. This is how it looks to me from outside. But from one side of me saying that Betkili is going to win, I don't know. But Oleg Dzok, how can you say that this guy beats him?
SPEAKER_04: incredible guys, you know, super heavyweights. Yeah, I'm still, I'm still, I think in the arm wrestling world is still excited to see Oleg coming back and really getting back, you know, to the level he was at before, before the accident. So I'm excited to see him being healthy and really applying himself at the top, top level again, like he has been. And, but I mean,
SPEAKER_01: any man that can have a war with fresh like bad kelly did i mean i have i have respect for seeing how virage is you know an hour away from me and i felt how strong he is and it's unbelievable he dave chafee right across the table i will remind you something when you see res and bet kelly bought were 165 pounds yeah and for 165 pounds it's good weight for res it's for his height it's good weight but for bet kelly
SPEAKER_01: it's very low weight, very low weight. You understand? So now we will see about 200 pounds of, uh, bad Kelly, the bad Kelly that, that, that will pull, uh, Oleg would not even feel res.
SPEAKER_04: at 75 kilo right and then i also saw yeah i was i also saw the after pull video of him and oleg you know uh years ago but he was starting with his wrist cupped in pretty well yeah but i mean that those angles man uh you could say oleg was like uh he was not comfortable trying to get out of that so yeah i mean uh i'm gonna see if he can recreate that maybe uh with speed maybe sink in this hook uh quickly but if not his wrist looks really solid so i'm going back
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, and Cobra, do you have any idea about bet killing or do you know only Oleg? I really don't have a call in that match. But I've been talking with Uncle John a little bit and he tells me if I was a betting man that I would bet on Oleg. Yeah, I'm not very educated on some of these.
SPEAKER_01: Speaking of now, do you have the Gabby match also? Gabby versus Sarah is on the king of the table three in Dubai in March. Yeah. Yeah. That is one of the greatest as well. You know, Gabby beat Sarah, but Sarah was just coming back from long retirement. Of course. Mayor and square. There's nothing to talk about. Gabby was stronger and she deserved the match was set. Conditions were accepted and Gabby was better, but
SPEAKER_01: The Sarah that Gabi is going to face this time will not be the same Sarah, not even close. Because I saw her here in Yalova in the first East versus West. You know, she was incredible. And she was, after the matches next day, we were going to my gym. She was walking in front of me with a tank top.
SPEAKER_01: and then oh yeah i mean i never had a back like that you know just i mean there was no guy in the training group that had i mean she's she looked incredible and i think that that is one of the greatest uh female matches in the history not the maybe the best but one of the best for sure you know yeah definitely the one with the most
SPEAKER_02: significant titles earned between those two women? Yeah, I mean, Gabriela won the title. I understand, but I don't think there's been a match. I don't think there's been a match with two women that combined have that many title. But you could say that any time Gabby is at the table, right? No, no, no, no. I have seen like we talked about titles. I have seen Egle versus
SPEAKER_01: uh gabriella sarah has four four senior world titles sarah's other four is junior but senior she has four while gabriella this year won 26 world title in senior and the other ones other ones that over 20 is uh egla and irina makiawa like like if you would say like i mean the most important
SPEAKER_01: right arm match in the history if there would be it would be irina makieva versus uh gabriella what do you think uh ivan what do you think do you think i mean yes perhaps yes and irina irina beat gabriella in i think a1 or something irina also has more wins versus eggler but with left arm i think that the best ever is eggler right you want
SPEAKER_01: the left army anyway so if we go to do uh uh what do you guys think do you guys think that everyone has any chance against school boy
SPEAKER_04: Hey, there's some things to say about this match. I think Evan's the obvious underdog, I think, going into this for a lot of people are going to be voting against him. I think it'd be a landslide in terms of the people, the gambling. But I will say if Evan, in my opinion, gets one win on Schoolboy anywhere early, it is going to be a snowball, a tsunami of just words and confidence. And I don't know.
SPEAKER_04: I mean, has schoolboy ever been in a situation like he's going to be in with somebody that loud and in your face and screaming at you like and I don't know how he'll respond to someone with that level of aggression and Evan honestly Evan is a very good arm wrestler. I think the question is just coming down to power, really, you know youth and angles and power.
SPEAKER_04: I mean, I'm sure he's training his best and stuff, and if he can make that gap close. I don't think he even has to pass Schoolboy in terms of strength, but if he can make it close, I think Evan is experienced enough and well-rounded enough, Polar, where he can make it a match. But I still say Schoolboy's the favorite to win it, but I think it can be an interesting match. It can be, and I hope it is. I really hope it is.
SPEAKER_01: I think it's a lifetime opportunity for Ivan to face him. If he beats him, I think he's going to come there in his best ever shape. What do you think, Ivan? Well, actually, I don't know. You don't know? No comments, right? No comments, okay. I believe Schoolboy is going to win that pretty convincingly. Convincingly, yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Is it the refrigerator behind you? Say it again. Is it the refrigerator behind you? Yes. Yeah. Can you make a peach iced tea? Say it again. Peach iced tea. Do you have a peach iced tea? Can I? Yeah. Let's see. Put down here in the freezer. Peach iced tea. Lemon would work as well. Oh, lemon? Oh, yeah. Of course. Yeah. I'll get one ordered right up. Thank you. Right now it's
SPEAKER_01: Right now at Cafe Alouette. Anyway, so if we go now, Cherkasov versus Yusuf. Do you know anything about Yusuf, Ivan? Unfortunately, not. No? Sorry. You didn't follow his 78 kilo matches in the Istanbul event, best 78? Ivan, you didn't? Not all of them.
SPEAKER_01: yeah but this guy had won versus daniel prokopchuk yes he beat uh christo delijaco and he also had one win versus bojidar but bojidar beat him twice and then yeah fresh for fresh uh matches i mean he first uh christo and then i think he lost to bojidar
SPEAKER_01: Pojidar had maybe like 30 seconds match, 30 seconds, yeah. But he also, more than 10 seconds match he had with Hristo. And then, yeah, and then he beat, he beat Daniel, Daniel Prokopchuk, yeah. And he also beat Aydar Khan, Nurdalet Aydar Khan in the second one, second, yeah. And this year he won the 65 kilo, well, versus the guy, what was his name, I forget, Farmiev.
SPEAKER_00: Igor Parniev, yeah. So you are saying that Cherkasov is probably a clear winner? Perhaps, yes. I think Cherkasov... Well, I don't know actually. After what you said, it's difficult to predict. Yeah, but he was... He beat Prokopchuk and Cherkasov lost to Prokopchuk at WAF, so...
SPEAKER_01: Well, I don't know. Yeah, Proko should also be Yusuf in the next 78 kg event. Yeah. So it's like not that only Yusuf won. Anyways, and do you guys know Derek Cobra? Do you know Cherkasov? Yeah, I do. Yeah. Cherkasov is probably like one of the best lightweights in the world and the best lightweight
SPEAKER_01: under 70 kilo, maybe with the exception of Mindaugas tarassitis, every time I see Mindaugas pulling Chetkazo, Mindaugas beats him. But in fact, you know, Chetkazo became best after some of the guys moved up, you know, like
SPEAKER_01: Artur Makaro always beat him, easy. And Minda goes beat him, but Minda goes continue with IFA. And then some other Kazakh guys, I don't know if Aktaev ever pulled Cherkasov. And what do you think, Derek, if you know him?
SPEAKER_04: um i think you were there right the first 78 you were there in istanbul right you you filmed that and you i was recording it shaky yeah um i think that like i said i think yusuf is amazing like i spent last night watching some to refresh my mind on his matches again um i think that in in my mind the way i'm watching him versus chukasov um i i i
SPEAKER_01: I feel like if it goes inside and it sits inside, does Yousef have an outside ability? Because I know he goes inside. He has, he has, but I don't know if it is good enough to go versus Cherkasov.
SPEAKER_04: just i i feel like because i have seen yusuf's bicep uh an arm get exposed eventually i don't think i've ever seen cherkasov's arm get exposed you know and really get opened up and if anything he would just come off the table but i don't even see his arm uh opening up in a hook let's pull in bojidar the match that you're talking about was bojidar incredible endurance you know
SPEAKER_01: right right now he does um i just something something inside says i'm going with jerks off i'm sorry and i know i know you said you know just why is it nothing bad you know the only thing that you know i i wouldn't like you know if we this is like any of the fellow armistice it doesn't matter but other than that i mean you can say that he's gonna beat him one thousand to zero this is your opinion why would you need to be sorry about that hey what's your opinion
SPEAKER_01: My opinion, I don't know. It may not be as you guys are thinking, but never know. Cherchezo, it's hard to exhaust that guy. It's hard to make him tired and beat him, you know, but we will see. You know, he and Daniel Prokopchuk had like 11 minutes match, you know, it was just, was it 11 minutes or more? Daniel, Daniel is a, did you ask me if I knew Daniel? I know Daniel. No, no, no, no. The Cherchezo, Cherchezo is the guy that beat Daniel with right arm, you know, just at Woff.
SPEAKER_01: okay yeah okay yeah because daniel daniel was a beast yeah inside yeah you should actually beat him in istanbul uh with right arm inside yeah but did some a month later when i helped monday he beat him how how old is yusuf he seemed pretty young right or is he ah he's 1995 27. okay what is this what
SPEAKER_01: Z's guitar account. Thank you for the support. And please forgive the wild and immature personalities of some of us North Americans. We love and appreciate everything you are doing for our message. No, there is nothing to forgive. You guys are great. We are a big family. We all are part of a big family from north to south, east, west. I love all of you, except the ones that you just all the time is just writing offensive comments. You know, I don't like them. Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: anyway so if we go to the next one and we're finishing morozov versus uh cody what do you think you want let's start from here well they are both chopper rollers but morozov's arm is higher so well i think that morozov is the favorite in this match but um
SPEAKER_00: It's hard to predict, like in many other matches. As well as with Marseille, Barboza, right-handed. It's almost the same. Morozov against Barboza, the same technique, posting top roll, perhaps. And Morozov's level is higher. So it will be difficult for Marseille and it will be difficult for Cody.
SPEAKER_02: When you say the same as Barbosa, Barbosa is one of the most violent arm wrestlers. Especially for a heavyweight. A guy like him or Don Underwood for such a big man that's so fast with a solid hit. This guy has that same kind of action. That's insane. Yeah, he's just kind of
SPEAKER_01: hard to hit like so comfortably when you are under ruffles, you know. You need to be very careful about your elbow, especially if your opponent is going outside, you know, you need to be very careful about the elbow and that can happen. I see that it has happened a lot, you know, during the WAL competition. So, I mean, of course, I was thinking that, you know, Morozov was 120 kilos last time I see him, but when we did the interview with him,
SPEAKER_01: was 129 kilo now so he's about he's about six five he looks like uh the the e1 dragon you know from the rocky form movie yeah yeah and he's just like incredible you know his shape you know and i don't know let's see how it will be but i see cody cody if cody can keep morozov's wrist you know straight flat you know
SPEAKER_01: Morozov can't really control here, but they go like this. Evgeny Cody loses some, you know, his front is like this, but still has the pronator. I think that Cody is able to apply incredible side pressure. So, I think that Morozov's chance to win is if he can have the, like, really full wrist control over Cody's. Cody is an incredible guy, you know. I mean, his side pressure is
SPEAKER_01: and marcio is well rounded and he is very quick you know he can he can suddenly jump into yeah but there is some weight weight difference you know marcio is gonna be maximum 110 kilo in my opinion while the morozov is 129 you know weight difference from 130 to 170 or something but when you are talking about the light heavy weight in the super heavy weight is kind of a little bit different in my opinion
SPEAKER_04: what do you think uh about this it's hard it's hard for me to get my my um personal experience with cody out of out of my mind because when i pulled with cody he left-handed he feels so connected in here you can feel it's one unit that when he decides to move his arm here it just the whole and he has a lot of weight behind him everything just moves across and he's proven that against
SPEAKER_04: the best we have over here, right? Anybody that's kind of stepped up when he decides to drive sideways. And so people attacking his hand out here, I mean, rarely do you ever see his hand compromised. So it's hard for me to get that stuff kind of, especially my personal time pulling with him out of there and just see it subjectively. But I think that if Morozov, he likes to kind of leave, he leaves his arm
SPEAKER_04: forward in front of him a lot which i think will take away a lot of that stability maybe and if he doesn't win that early fight in the hand then and his arm is out there against cody i think it's a really bad idea uh against him versus cody because i think warsop isn't afraid to hook i think he's okay being here and then he likes rolling out once he he gets a hook a lot of times as well so i don't know i feel like if he touches cody's wrist it's going to be a bad idea
SPEAKER_04: I think it's gonna be a really bad idea. So I think Cody takes it in my head. But like I said, I've never felt Morris off. I've only felt Cody. So are you going for another American?
SPEAKER_04: Okay, so, and then Marcio and Morozov. That one, in my head, the way I see it going, I see it being very exciting. I think it might be the most explosive match on the card, or one of the most explosive matches on the card. I wonder if Marcio's going to keep his elbow down, because Morozov's going to be way up here, and Marcio, I think, is going to have a shorter form trying to hold down.
SPEAKER_01: And I know he's had problems with that in the past. So I think Morozov is going to take that one because he's going to be so high and he's not afraid to hook. Well, when you say he's going to be so high... His forearm, his forearm height. You know, because on the, especially the WAF rules, you know, to see the knuckles, the elbows may be moved back by the referee just to make sure that, because when you are this high, it is not that easy to show both knuckles, you know.
SPEAKER_04: So it is going to be, I mean, I don't think that anyone will be, I'm not talking about, I mean, I know it'll start fair. I just mean that the fight he's going to bring to, to Marcio will be a high fight, a higher than I think Marcio might be comfortable with. Yeah. And Cobra, Cobra, anything to add from your side? I've never seen anyone bring a fight to Marcio. He always brings the fight to them. So I think that in my mind,
SPEAKER_01: About three seconds into the match, we're going to know what time it is. Right after they go, we'll see positioning in about three seconds, and we'll know. We'll know. That's why they chalk up. We can talk about it all day, but they got to play the game. Yes, yeah, yeah. I mean, some matches are very hard to predict. Some matches, some we have idea. And people say that this is where, like, it's not people, but many people, 99% of people, good feedback.
SPEAKER_01: But how about the Ermes versus Arif? You want? Well, I think that in this match, who starts first will win. Do you think Arif has a chance? Yes. Perhaps, yes. Most of the people say that Arif doesn't have any chance. Well...
SPEAKER_00: Ermes lost to Matt Musk even maybe half a year ago. One round, it was one round or two rounds, I don't remember. Well, I think that a good top roller has a chance against Ermes. It depends on the start. It's all about the start, you see. Yes, who starts first perhaps will win. Did you find Arif Wafin impressive?
SPEAKER_01: this year yes yeah and it is not the first time right he won yeah but he won more convincingly this time like he 2019 he had some with the the bulgarian guy mitko and they had some war but this time he beat mitko he didn't even allow him to go strapped
SPEAKER_01: with other guys, with Shetkov. Did you see his match with Shetkov? Well, I think that there are some questions about this match with Shetkov. Yes? I think for me, no. But if you ask, you know, other side, yeah, they say so. But I mean, Arif wasn't the only guy that he lost against. Well, anyway, anyway, it will be a good match. And I think that Arif has chances.
SPEAKER_01: I have a question. The most difficult show to win still is WAF. Is this the hardest show in the world to win? For me, up to 90 kilos, yes, no doubt. About 90 kilos, if you're not in WAF, just forget about being best. About 100 and 110, WAF has half of the best in the world. When you go super heavyweight, WAF has
SPEAKER_01: two, three best in the world out of 15 guys. I don't know what your opinion is, Ivan. Yes, the same. The same. But just remember one thing, Cobra. You know, you can't compare the athletes who are competing well with the athletes who are not competing well.
SPEAKER_01: any athlete that is living the wealth is becoming something you know different you know that i pulled there for like more than 25 years you pull as well so what i'm just saying that like if you really want to like prove that you are better than those guys in the world you actually need to go to that event and compete the doping test of the event you know you can't be it's not the same thing like for example i will tell you something everyone would know better uh that now everyone knows right
SPEAKER_01: The Ongar Bayern, the last time he pulled VARF, he was, I think, either seventh place or something in Antalya. That's what I remember. Prudnik, incredible, right? Prudnik, almost, not almost, but probably always lost to Sasho. Am I wrong, Ivan? Evgeny when he pulled VARF before... He was not the winner. Sasho was the winner. What? Prudnik was good and he was world champion, right? No, no, I'm not talking about... Before they left VARF,
SPEAKER_01: In the last event that they competed, they were not world champions. They lost at WAF and then they continued in Cup 8. Correct? Yeah, Antalya. And I think even a year before, Sasha still beat Prudnik. This is what I remember. I'm not saying Prudnik is great. But what I'm just saying is that to compete outside of WAF and to compete inside of the WAF, it's not possible to be the same person, you know. This is what I'm trying to say.
SPEAKER_01: so you can't really like say you know what i mean you know no need to just talk you know about it but then still up to 90 kilo i mean wow is that no one in the world can claim that they are like best like better than those guys from 55 to 90 kilo i would put my life on it you know just like it's it's just nightmare you know to go there and win and people also things that you know super matches are you know like harder
SPEAKER_01: super match one one on one of course it determines the better pull or two but to win in waff when there are like like so many guys from georgia russia kazakhstan ukraine latvia bulgaria going there and being able to win is like incredible thing you know incredible thing like because you need to be prepared for so many different guys are
SPEAKER_01: best at all different styles you know samples this way some goes this way some goes that way some goes sideways you need to be ready for all of them you don't know who's gonna be your you know match you know you don't know your draw you know what i mean you need to be ready for all of this yeah so and and so and what do you think uh
SPEAKER_04: I think, I mean, respect to Arif. He's an amazing, amazing guy. But I think Arif is the favorite. I think that he's on a high level right now. I think he's at an all-time high level for himself. And how is Arif? He was injured left, right? Left is injured since the Cody match. You know, people talk about his match with Morozov. No excuse. You know, if you accept people at a match, there's no excuse. But there are some facts that, you know,
SPEAKER_01: uh his his muscle between his index finger and the thumb here is even melted you know there's no really signal there that something is wrong with the nerves and he thought that he could pull you know but the one round and he was gone and right after the only one round they pulled and i i couldn't pull and the other rounds out of just laid you understand but right after the matches
SPEAKER_01: Efe pulled with Morozov, and every time they pulled, he top rolled him. First time, Morozov didn't take him seriously. Second time they pulled, he started, Efe still took him. Because it's very hard to top roll Efe's wrist. To take him inside, his arm pronated is not that strong.
SPEAKER_01: Evgeny when Sandris at the walls, when he tried to top roll him, he lost his wrist. But whenever he hook him, he beat him. But so Morozov is going outside. So Efe used to be a strong man, you know. And Efe came to that event of Arif-Morozov match after he pulled a train, you know, for like, what, 20 meters or 30 meters with a rope, you know, they are pulling like this, you know. So he was also very, very, very tired that day. But, you know, so I'm just thinking that that is why
SPEAKER_01: I don't know. You asked about the Arabs left. Why did you ask about the Arabs left? No, I was trying to remember if he was injured or how long ago he was injured and how that's going in terms of the match. I think he needs surgery for left. But for his right, I think it's very, very good fighting right now.
SPEAKER_04: yeah and oh oh i don't know i don't know why i thought arif in armies was left-handed i was reading that wrong oh it's oh if it's right-handed then even even more so i i think uh i think that enemies armies takes it um to be honest i have to go get my little savage from the bus stop okay because i'll be finishing anyway so you can go yeah so thank you very much for joining love all you guys yeah thank you yeah
SPEAKER_01: maybe maybe five more minutes and then we'll be thank you for me because peace you guys see you yeah and and even the two one two two more i will ask him finish rambat versus efe left arm well i think that um uh ron is the favorite um perhaps
SPEAKER_00: Well, I don't know Ron's shape, but I think that his side pressure will be enough to beat FM, even with lost reach, like he did with Taras Ivakin in 2004. Which was right arm. I don't know, but perhaps his left arm is as good as the right arm, perhaps.
SPEAKER_01: well i judge only uh when he beat armand so perhaps he's in good shape yeah but different style i think they both are going like inside and then arm and the next round he went like this but what i'm just trying to say i agree with you i don't see ron toppling effer i don't know i don't see ron really cooking ever maybe instead maybe but
SPEAKER_01: maybe possible as you said that you know that way you know this is what i was thinking i even told effett like do you think that he can be he said that no no no he said if i take his wrist i'm gonna be him because fa has been a strong man if somehow somehow takes run somehow to the losing position i don't know if he can do with left arm but with right arm do you remember him versus herman stevens that you know he bring his shoulder and uh maybe
SPEAKER_01: And Derek, do you know Efe at all? Yeah, I pulled with Efe a little bit when I was out there with you. And then, I mean, I've seen the matches. I mean, he was there with Arif. And we pulled the little after-polling session after the dinner with everybody. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Not the after-poll, but it was the day before. Yeah. The video that you filmed, you know, the difference between open-arm tuple and desperation move.
SPEAKER_04: uh yeah right the uh i don't know um i think fa looks amazing i think he's uh he's coming up i think he's younger and he's newer to the sport um he looked amazing he looked amazing against against herman and i i know herman's no slouch at all i know he was just you know ready as he could be uh at the time for that match um i think i think evan might just be too much right now uh he looks like he's hasn't even hit his peak yet remember if versus herman
SPEAKER_01: FOS was 275 pounds. Here, FA will be 250 pounds, 55 pounds. Oh, I know. Why do you lose weight? 115 kilo weight limit by Ron. Yeah. And the other one, what do you think about Chance versus, this is the last one I will ask you, Chance versus Sandris? You left, so you mean that Sandris is going to win. This is what I believe.
SPEAKER_04: No, no, it's just Chance is my buddy, that's my boy. I think even Chance admits that he's the underdog coming into this.
SPEAKER_04: uh he has in this match i think uh with with what uh sanders has been doing recently in the last year or two i think uh he's he's doing amazing i think uh he's the man to beat in in in a lot of ways right now um and so uh yeah i think chance is the underdog sanders is the favorite now i'm cheering for chance that's my buddy but uh yeah i think sanders chance for chance to win it's very hard to use you know chance name and that saying how much chance he has
SPEAKER_04: Yeah. The odds say the odds, the odds of him winning. Um, but yeah, so I, I think Sandris is the favorite and, uh, and then I think FA is the favorite in those two matches. There is no way the chance can beat. Uh, whoa, whoa, whoa. I didn't say there's no way. I just think, I think, tell us the way top row. And then when, when you can sound this can hook him. Um, mm.
SPEAKER_04: In the first round, round one, do I think Sandris can sink in a hook unless Chance makes a mistake in the strap set up, because it'll go to the straps. I don't think, if Sandris can snap Chance into a hook first round outside of the straps, that would be very impressive. I feel with the traditional Chance, it'll be going to the straps, ASAP pulling out, manipulating, and then pulling way out, going to the straps.
SPEAKER_04: In the strap setup, Chance goes, his style is going, he gets his form very vertical for more of a low hand. And so he goes for height. Sandris isn't a small person. And I don't know if Chance will be able to go really tall with his form and try to fight Sandris up here. Because I think if Sandris just goes hand up, it might control with high knuckle. Do you think Chance will have it with a drop wrist, like drop hand like this? When, when, when Sandris, if Sandris tries top rope?
SPEAKER_04: I think he's susceptible to that, yeah. I mean, most of Chance's successes have been with the dumb wrist. Like, you know, that's kind of his go-to. So I don't know how comfortable he'd be fighting high. Yeah, yeah. And Ivan, what do you think about this match? It is left hand. No, right arm. Ah, right arm. Well, perhaps Chance will have some chances, perhaps.
SPEAKER_00: Well, I don't know. I only saw his match against John. But he beat guys like Don Underwood, Yordan Seal. Do you know these guys? And what's the guy with the tattoo? I forget his name. I always forget his name. Well, actually, I saw some matches with these names, but it's difficult to say. Perhaps there can be a fight, an even fight, if they pull, if they...
SPEAKER_00: Oh, Toprol against Toprol. Who knows? Ivan, you know who Chance is, though. You know Chance Shaw? You know who he is? I just saw his match against John Brzenk.
SPEAKER_01: and let us go. Chance in the chat right now. I know Chance is hyped here. Yvonne knows who he is. John Brzenk's first match after he started returning. Derek, do you think that John, the pull, Chance, and the John that now, like some difference that John is using improving?
SPEAKER_04: yeah i think john was making steady improvement i mean it was just getting the cobwebs off getting the rust out you know getting worked out so i think his his improvement is his rate of improvement is really really fat really high right now john there's a question there's a question for you one uh black paul thank you for super what is ivan's opinion on him versus hermes at 110 kilo
SPEAKER_00: uh well i think i will have uh very good chances at uh okay i think i will beat at worth well and i'm not so confident um yes yes i'm not so cool especially our mess is uh much bigger uh he is 125. 110 kilo limit
SPEAKER_00: well uh maybe if at the moment of um of the pool of an arm fight perhaps i think i'll have chances i think he is comfortable for me but if he is very big perhaps no you are saying that if for your same weight you say that you have good chance i think i have chance yes you're talking about this the same way in waff or also even in professional
SPEAKER_01: Maybe also in professional, but at the day of the competition. Okay, yeah. I have a question for you. What is the weight limit that you would accept to pull Ermes? 115 you would pull him? Maybe, maybe. What was your weight when you pulled supers plus 110 kilos in Antalya?
SPEAKER_01: uh 115 yes 114 yes but it was mainly fat you know yeah yeah i know i know i know i know yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah okay i'm fat even in uh 110. okay if you pull a super match because you you are competing nationals you compete in europeans you compete in wars if you would pull a super match
SPEAKER_01: when would you want this to be you wouldn't want it to be so close to your you know big events like europeans and wars so uh because if if i continue uh organizing you know even this event i want you to pull uh touching but you said you have some elbow issues and when do you think this should be maybe i would even set the tournament on the date that you would like to
SPEAKER_00: well perhaps if my nationals are at the end of march so i need perhaps four months after nationals so i can pull someone instead of europeans oh you would you instead of europeans you would you would even
SPEAKER_01: instead of europeans instead of europeans i think i will not be able to pull both a non-fight and then europeans and then worlds so i'll have to choose if i put it in this summer like like you have europeans at the end of the may and then end of october the wealth if i set a super match in august or uh july yes i think i think july august would be i would never put uh set a event when when it is near to european and wars you know i would never do that because
SPEAKER_01: I want amateur armwrestling to not get harmed even a little bit by the professional events, at least the professional event that I'm going to organize. Evgeny if I organize a supermatch event, I will not invite athletes from WAF. I will only, because I want athletes to compete, Europeans and wars, and then other than that,
SPEAKER_01: ronnie thank you for the support my friend and the last one i will ask and we're finishing uh i don't know if derek knows but uh rebecca from slovakia versus fia i watched last night i watched videos on rebecca i was like who is this because i know who fia is and rebecca looks amazing
SPEAKER_04: it was amazing uh i even saw a match an old match she had with with gabby and she was took gabby's hand and i was like and they went to the straps and i was like oh here comes the straps and she even in the straps she took gabby's hand stop her yeah she stopped her really yeah yeah so uh i don't know and we haven't seen much at a fia in a while right fia hasn't competed just in all the wars in 70 kilos
SPEAKER_01: Oh, defeated. Oh, I didn't miss the current 70 kilo world champion. While Rebeka is the current 65 kilo world champion. They will meet at 70 kilo. Okay. Yeah. I didn't, I didn't watch the worlds that close this year from Moscow region from like, um, yes. Yeah. And, and what do you think about this match?
SPEAKER_00: About my fear against Rebeka, well, it's difficult to say actually. Don't tell me that you didn't even watch them. Well, I watched some of them and actually some of women's fights are really impressive and sometimes they fight fiercely and they are very good matches.
SPEAKER_01: But all in all, I'm not a huge fan of women arm wrestling. Aha, now you are in trouble. Wait, I want to see Ezra pull. Other than that, I want to ask you, did you watch Rebeka pulling Gladkaya in the final? Yes, sure. Do you think it was impressive? Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I was. Yeah, I was also very, very, very impressed about about that much. Yeah. And I don't know. I don't know how. Okay. The most important between the ones that we didn't mention, especially for you, Ivan, I will ask you directly to Zurab.
SPEAKER_01: F. Ponta and Apurva L.: versus run bet run is hundred 12 kilo job is normally a departmental company and normally walking around 93 94 kilo like, but now I asked him, he was he said he was 97 kilo and he said he said he will be about hundred and hundred three to range and do you, how do you see this match. Well.
SPEAKER_00: I think it will be very difficult for Ron to beat The Rock. Yeah. Do you think there is a chance for top roll or no? Well, I'm not sure that Ron is a good top roller. He top rolls, but not that good. Yes, if he top rolls, perhaps he will have bigger chances, perhaps.
SPEAKER_00: But in hook, it will be very difficult. Yeah, do you see Ran top rolling Zurab in this trap? Well, I can see actually a long hook war. But perhaps Zurab is the favorite, perhaps. I understand, yeah. And what do you think about Derek? Do you know Zurab?
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I know of him. I've never pulled him, but I know of him. Very compact and thick. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know what? I'm going to go with Ron. I'm choosing Ron. I'm backing Ron on this one. Going for the legend himself. Yeah. Okay, I'm finishing. Promise this time. Only for you, Derek. Jonathan Breda versus Zurab.
SPEAKER_04: They say that Jonathan is very, very, very strong. Yeah, he's very strong. I feel like he's been pulling through a lot of people. I don't think he gets as tight and compact as Zurab's going to. I have a feeling it's going to go inside. In my head, if I'm watching him go inside, in my mind, if I feel like Zurab's going to be a little bit tighter with a little bit more shoulder commitment. Do you think that man is going to go inside or do you think Jonathan may top roll him? Or no?
SPEAKER_04: I think it goes in. I think it goes in regardless of what the other one wants. I think the other one's gonna force it in. So yeah, I think it goes in. And then I see Zurab as the favorite, I think, if it goes in. Personally. Yeah. I know, I know, I know. I will let you go, Ivan.
SPEAKER_00: i i know i promised you one hour but sorry when it's arm wrestling it's just like the last thing what do you think about levan versus devon i think that devon has improved much last year or so if he well i think he will have chances
SPEAKER_00: Perhaps if he gets bigger, stronger, maybe 5-10% stronger, he will have some chances. But not in the shape that you saw him versus John Brzenk, right? Maybe 5% stronger, 5-7, maybe. You know, the first round, John and Devon were very close until he went
SPEAKER_01: is about like five percent close to levan the john that you know sorry but you know john is my favorite armistice great so all time but talking about john that had wars with pauline with dimitri kashan with with uh what was the you know sorry uh chan show do you think that of course he was probably a little bit better when he pulled devon but like do you see these guys any near to levan um
SPEAKER_01: because i saw that the fresh power of john and devon if you're talking about endurance yeah but the fresh power the first round ready go came if you see devon like like that that starting power you know like much stronger than jones later on he was exhausted everything finished you know once he stopped him and uh maybe you're right maybe you're right but i think that levan is also a bit overrated
SPEAKER_01: overrated a bit um perhaps he's the strongest do you remember you're talking about the level that you know we like to see oh sorry yes i will tell you something you train with vitale and you know how strong vitale is especially lately and this guy beat vitale and except round one that
SPEAKER_01: and then he lost his wrist and still from there he survived and beat him that way but the next rounds he didn't try to control uh lalatin's tornado he just directly went outside and the rest of the rounds were easy and now we're talking about lewand that is probably even getting stronger now and do you really like he is like much overrated or like
SPEAKER_00: Like, did you see his match? He's not much overrated, but I think that, for example, Dave Chaffee wasn't in his best shape or maybe he couldn't show his best in this match. And whom did Levan beat apart from Laletin? Laletin... Yeah, just one thing. What do you think about Levan or Vov?
SPEAKER_01: versus Levan of today? What's the difference? Percentage, percentage. I will count somewhere. Well, I think 15, 20%. You think that much or more? 15, 20. In my opinion, minimum 20. Do you remember the match? Levan versus Turbin?
SPEAKER_01: Yes. And it was still when Levan just pulled him off. And Turbin at those years, he lost a super match, but he also beat Pushkar. One time he beat him in Zloty and the other one he top rolled him. He was beating Bobita like this much of elbow foul while he was winning. He was decided to
SPEAKER_01: know loose versus push cut so through at that time and then 11 pull we're talking about 11 or wash shape almost like a month later one and a half month later after the waft and that one was like beating 6-0 through and now you're saying that 20 stronger through and we saw also laletin versus through
SPEAKER_01: at the top eight, how much Laletin was better than Turbin and what Turbin was versus Michael versus Pushkar. And now we see Levan except round one that he choose the wrong way and then he decide what the round was. I don't think that Levan is overrated, but I respect your opinion. Well,
SPEAKER_00: Perhaps I'm wrong, yes. No, I'm not saying you're wrong. Yes, yes, really. I'm a little bit convinced you, right? A little bit convinced you. But I would like Chafee to try to hook him. Did you not see round four or round five? What was Derek? He was going like this. Levan was going like this. And then he was like, you know, he was just saying, let's go, you know, like it sounds that way. And then?
SPEAKER_01: they was there and they just put his hand and went away you know they felt something there in my opinion that he didn't like it even here you know this this is my opinion but i only think one weakness of levan which is exactly the best weapon of devon which is this down two fingers there is i mean there is something you know there is something here
SPEAKER_01: He's Kyrgali. Kyrgali. Not only that, but there is something, his fingers, everything's strong, but inside of his hand down here, still like everything, he's incredible. I'm nowhere. I can't even move him with two hands. That's not that. But if we do analyze, and that down there is exactly where Devon is going to go. So I think that the best chance of Devon is the
SPEAKER_01: Compared to other parts, the weakest point of Levan, and if the setups are really long, like last match, five minutes, and I talk with Levan, and Levan knows it. And I said, Levan, you may be the, I mean, strongest guy in the world, but when your hand turns numb, it doesn't matter how much strong, your explosive power and your hand, Levan says that he has good endurance as well.
SPEAKER_01: But Levan doesn't understand the endurance of Devon. Devon is not human when we talk about the endurance. He just stops you. Once he stops you, then everything is just like you are going like, he goes like 99, 98. You go like 99, 96, 93, 90. This is, Levan needs to understand it. He should not want anything at all about the endurance.
SPEAKER_01: of course if he's too much he can hold him wait and then still pin him if it is true if he's too much like like dennis did too devil but if anything is near but remember those setups were very quick ones at the pipe you know ready go not like this so i think that devil is making his strategy mostly to
SPEAKER_01: before the goal you know this is and he says this openly nothing to blame he said he's gonna do it whatever it works and leon accepted to pull him right under those rules yeah so i mean this is leon's problem from now okay sorry for cutting you tell me my friend what do you think you want sorry for cutting you i do not remember
SPEAKER_01: Well, it would be interesting. And if there's money, where would you bet? I would bet on Levan. Levan? Yes. But you need a little bit of weight, right? Till that time to see how the things are looking. Yes. Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: and then what do you think about this and then we close uh levon's the favorite i think everybody on planet earth understands that levon is the favorite and would bet money on levon um but but i think devin's gonna throw some stuff at him he hasn't came across yet i don't know how many kings moves your desperation what do you want to call it i don't know how many of those he's dealt with um also i mean devin's gonna be coming in heavy um and and prepped and he's gonna
SPEAKER_04: if there's one stop if he gets one stop on levon it's it's done so um yeah i mean i'm really interested to see uh what devin has to throw at him and i honestly think this will be the pinnacle of devin's strength ever i don't think he'll ever be this strong again i don't think he's ever been this strong i think this is going to be the strongest devin we'll ever see i think it's a very exciting match i'm excited to see finally the number one north america you know number one uh in the world rankings you know go at it
SPEAKER_01: it's been a while since we had one of these types of clashes so i'm excited to see it but i definitely you have to say levon's favorite but uh we all want to see if devon can you know climb mount everest you know yeah so it's gonna be golden shots for devon yeah i mean he even says i mean even devon says the same thing you know like i mean you need to be insane you know to not to think that way that you know if you're gonna pull that one you need to push your limits that that's what it is
SPEAKER_01: Okay, gentlemen, thank you very, very much, Ivan. Sorry. Sorry, I couldn't keep my promise about one hour, but it's not because of anything, but because of arm wrestling, and this guy really loves arm wrestling. And while I find guys like you, and it is hard to let it go, you know. So thank you very much, Ivan. Thank you for inviting me. Yeah. Thank you very much, Derek. What did you say, Ivan?
SPEAKER_01: I wish you all the best in organizing your events. And I would like to be part of each one day. Yeah, I would love you. You versus... Just don't mention anything else. We are closing the subject. I want to hear Yvonne's opinion on my match with Tim Bresnan. I got to put Tim Bresnan in like a couple of weeks. I want to know his opinion on my match with Tim Bresnan. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I just want to hear it. Yeah, yeah, Yvonne. Tim Bresnan versus Derek. Do you follow him lately, Derek? He is getting strong.
SPEAKER_01: he probably he probably discovered the the some some some things you know he's incredible right now he's gonna say i will watch this match you will watch yeah that's all that's all i can ask for just watch the match that's all that's all i can ask for i i saw you pulling with john but you almost kind of a little bit more exhausted with michael but still your hand seemed very solid it's where where team is going to attack i know i know you're going to kill me you want but
SPEAKER_00: Is Alexey Voevoda coming back? Well, I don't know. But I also thought about this. I think it would be great to organize a match, John Brzenk versus Voevoda. It would be great for both athletes. Yeah, in a similar way. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I think that you should...
SPEAKER_01: Ask Alexey. Perhaps he will be interested in this match. Perhaps. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. I don't even have any contact with him, but I may try. But maybe some other people are in touch with him. I think that probably Dubai is in touch with him. That's what I'm guessing. If he's going to come back in 2020, and then I saw that when CoreSports is doing advertisement,
SPEAKER_00: they tag him too. So I'm just making a connection that, you know, maybe even with Dennis. Well, he said that, he didn't say he wrote that he wanted to go to amateur division, nationals, maybe worlds above. But who knows? Wow, it would be great. Yeah. Yes, it would be great. Do you think he would pull supers or 110 kilos? Oh, I don't know. You don't know?
SPEAKER_04: yeah it would be good yeah it would be nice yeah remember meeting me i'm sorry i don't mean to interrupt i just found a picture you remember meeting me in malaysia in 2015. yeah i don't look the same but we met a long time ago yeah yeah yeah you became bigger i think yeah a little bigger yeah yeah yeah anyways one last time thank you guys
SPEAKER_04: Always pleasure. And you all take care and hope to see you guys somewhere again. Thank you. It's my honor being on here with you guys. You guys are amazing legends. Thank you so much for having me. Thank you. Take care, everyone. Bye-bye. Bye.
