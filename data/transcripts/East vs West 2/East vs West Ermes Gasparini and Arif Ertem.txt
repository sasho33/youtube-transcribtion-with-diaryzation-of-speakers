SPEAKER_04: Hello. You are Issa? Yes, I'm Issa. I'm an Urmese translator. Nice to meet you, Issa. Nice to meet you. Hello, Arif. Hello.
SPEAKER_01: Selamun aleykum Arif. Aleykum selam abi. Sesim geliyor mu? Geliyor, geliyor kardeşim. Yep, her message probably coming soon. Yep. Arif sen görebiliyor musun YouTube'da canlı mıyız şu anda? Abi oradan göremiyorum şu an ama.
SPEAKER_01: Hello, Hermes, how are you? Can you hear us, Hermes? Yeah, yes. So how are you? Fine, you? Still a little bit ill because of COVID.
SPEAKER_01: I think I passed COVID, but still, you know, some cold now. Not the COVID, but... Okay. Now it's better? Yeah, it's much better. I go training, but a little bit less energy, you know. Yeah. But we are four, our four or other people? No, no, we are four, four, yeah. Ah, okay.
SPEAKER_03: You, Arif and Issa? Yeah. So, how is everything, Hermes? Preparation finished? Training finished? No, my last training will be Tuesday. Tuesday, wow. But it will be light, probably. Light training. With no high kilos.
SPEAKER_03: Low kilos, only for pump and the muscle, like this. Okay, Issa, you can go. Yes? Okay, so Hermes, tell me everything you have to tell me, so we can translate it better, okay? Okay. No, I said I'll train until Tuesday, but with little weight, just to get some blood and muscles.
SPEAKER_04: So the last training he will do will be on Tuesday, but will be with very light weights. So it will be a pumping workout to get a lot of blood flow in the muscles and to recovery better for the match, basically. Arif, when was your last training? I did a little pump training today. Did you finish it? I finished it. Now I'm resting. Arif says that, you know, today he did the last training.
SPEAKER_03: with a light blood pumping and he just finished and he's just gonna wrestle the competition.
SPEAKER_01: so i feel if i uh don't work out even very close to the competition i feel my muscle get a little bit tight and don't perform as well yeah yeah every everyone should know uh himself or herself you know about we all are different this is how how we get used to our body type you know because of the age because of the health conditions you know
SPEAKER_01: they all are we all are you know you know sometimes people ask you know like how many days we should rest how many days this i think that everyone should listen you know their body and then decide you know instead of just giving their mind you know as rented so someone to decide for him you know it is this is the worst thing you know to do it yep so ermis uh guys uh
SPEAKER_01: please i don't know if you are sending any super chat or something and please don't send it because somehow i don't know how to do it i can't i can't see the um i don't know maybe i can't but let me try probably no um i can't see it i think do you guys see me now or not
SPEAKER_04: No, but if you want, Engen, I have my chat in front of me, and I will tell you the Super Chats, because... Yeah, if you have the Super Chat, you can tell me, because I don't know how to do it at the same time. They're asking if you can enable it so they can actually Super Chat. And if there is anything, I will tell you. Okay, there is no Super Chat right now, right? I don't think it's enabled. You have to enable it. Oh, that is why last time when I did the...
SPEAKER_01: when i did the same you know the youtube show live show there was still no is is it possible to do it right now or i think so i think so but it's something that usually you do before the live stream but okay it's okay then it's okay then yeah we are just trying to promote the um the event yeah okay yeah so ermes um the question for you
SPEAKER_01: Where do you see yourself in the world ranking, honestly? You know, we can be humble. I know we all the time talk with him, you know. But, you know, since you are here, it will not make any sense if we directly talk with him, you know. Where does he see himself at the world rankings, you know? He may try to be humble, but usually we know him very outspoken, you know. He tells whatever is in his mind, you know.
SPEAKER_01: Can he tell us in the unlimited weight category where he sees himself being ranked?
SPEAKER_04: If you see interesting question,
SPEAKER_03: It doesn't have to be a super chat. You can still just bring it. No problem. Thank you. So, the first one... I think it's Lewandowski and Nasvili. Number one. Number two... If he really gets in shape, it's Alex Kurdeca.
SPEAKER_03: Three, Vitaly Daletin. Four... Hermes Gasparini? No. Maybe five or six, like this. So who is fourth? I don't know, with Dave Chaffee...
SPEAKER_03: It's very interesting because he has no stronger wrist. But David Chaffee, for me, is a five. Like this, four-five. Can I tell you something, Hermes? You said that Dave Chaffee doesn't have strong wrists. Yes, he loses his wrists from time to time, but who doesn't lose, you know? Laletin lost versus Levan. I mean...
SPEAKER_04: You lost versus Kurdesha. We all, from time to time, lose. But as you said, he kind of loses maybe a little bit more often than other top guys. Sure, so everyone, regardless of their strength, inevitably goes against someone stronger than you to lose by force to the wrist, like you did with Alex, like Vitaly did with Levan, etc. So even if he loses, it's something that happens at a high level.
SPEAKER_03: If there is a lot of arm strength, if there is a difference in arm strength, of course, the push-up will last until a certain point. Yes, of course, if the arm is so strong, but at the end, what matters is the wrist. So if you open the wrist, the arm can do anything. So it will eventually open, as you said. And where does he see Devon being ranked?
SPEAKER_01: In the Waffles, where do you see Dave Chaffee versus Devon? But the Waffles and the Waffle Elbow Pets. They win Dave Chaffee, sure. Too much power.
SPEAKER_03: How do you see the top five, top six or more?
SPEAKER_00: I think the first one is the same for me. Levan Saginajvili. He says that number one is Levan. The second one, according to me, is Laletin. Who is the third one? Kurdesha. Number three is Kurdesha, he says. If the fourth one is like what you said, it is Dave Chaffee.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, people, you know, have similar opinions, you know, about like top five, top six, you know, everyone, you know, opinions are very similar. Like you put Kurdesha second, Laletin three, and then Arif puts, you know, Laletin second and the Kurdesha third, you know, you know, it is just like, we don't know. We don't know the, we just can guess, you know. Yeah. Yeah. So Arif.
SPEAKER_01: He thinks that number five is you. He thinks that number five is you. He thinks that number five is you.
SPEAKER_01: I asked him, you know, if he thinks that, you know, there is a possibility Hermes to beat, uh, Dave Chaffee. And he, I think that what I understand, he thinks that, you know, he thinks that more of like loading type would take Dave's wrist, not the, like just the hand control.
SPEAKER_01: And then he says that, you know, he sees Dave's chance a little bit more than yours, but if you prepare good, he thinks that you have, you have, you have a chance. Yeah. Yeah. I, I, I, I don't want to hide the match between you guys right now. It's, it's a little bit early, but, uh, because, uh, Adam is a good friend of mine and out of is like my, uh, brother, but.
SPEAKER_01: Ermes, what do you expect Issa? You ask. Ermes knows English, but it's good that you are here. Since you are here, we need to ask you. What does he expect from the match against Arif? No being humble, he doesn't have to be disrespectful, but honestly, what does he expect?
SPEAKER_03: Riff has never done any... How do you say it? He's never done a top roll either. But I feel like I've never tried... It's a strange shot, let's say. A slightly lateral top roll. I expect to win, of course.
SPEAKER_03: It was definitely not undervalued because we are world champions. It is very difficult to win the World Championships in the UAF. I expect to win, but it will still be a nice battle. It will not be 6-0 fast.
SPEAKER_04: Okay, so he says his honest opinion without needing to be humble is basically Arif is a WF champion. So it's not easy to be a WF champion, first of all. And second of all, he has a very well perfected technique. It's like very similar to his. So he thinks that he will win his favorite, but it will not be an easy match. He doesn't think it will go 6-0 or maybe easy 6-0.
SPEAKER_01: it's it's gonna be best of five so the one that reaches three is finishing so it can be three zero three one or three two okay so you you he thinks that the matches will be not easy going yeah I understand definitely not taking him a light lightly he's training yeah yeah yeah I I personally wouldn't suggest him to take him lightly yeah yeah and and and
SPEAKER_01: would you be very upset if you lose hermes because now you are going like this you just be ganadi if you would lose would you would you be very very upset you know or you would just i mean go home and train harder you know i mean even you are upset you know like do you is there anything on your mind in a corner of your mind that you know there is a chance that you may lose
SPEAKER_04: In the case of your loss, is it something that would make you very angry, since you are in a rising trend that you are winning against Gnagli, etc., etc.? Or would you go home saying, damn it, I lost, I'm better, I'm getting stronger? It's not the first time I lose. I myself, when I lose and come back, I come back stronger and more determined.
SPEAKER_04: Okay, so it's not the first time he loses, but if he will lose, the thing about him is every time he loses, he learns something and he comes back stronger than ever. So it's not the end of the world if he loses. Yeah, you know, at this level,
SPEAKER_01: anything is possible, you know, at this level, you know, anything is possible. This athlete beats that, that athlete, like usually Michael Todd beats Dave Chaffee. And, um, but Dave Chaffee may be someone, and then someone may beat Michael, you know, it is just, I mean, you never know what's going to happen. You know, the techniques, you know, maybe different from person to person. Arif Sen, a Kardashian-Bennett
SPEAKER_01: What do you expect from this match? What is your guess? Or how do you go? You know, I won the last World Championship comfortably.
SPEAKER_00: It wasn't easy for me to win the previous one, but this time my performance was better. And from that day to this day, I continued by adding more to it for this match. I think my performance is good right now. Of course, I acted thinking about everything that was necessary for this match.
SPEAKER_01: Of course, I trained to win like he did. And I'm thinking of winning at zero. He said he just won the WAF. And then he was convincing, you know. And then he said that he won the WAF one before as well, but that wasn't that easy. This one was easier. And he said that after the last WAF that he just won a few months ago,
SPEAKER_01: he's still putting on, you know, and you know, the truth is he was not gonna go to WAF. He didn't say this right now, but he, he, he was just like relaxed training. He was not like so focused for the WAF and he was just resting good. And then I think that, you know, that, that rest help his arms. Uh, and I think like he went with the relaxed mode and then he won't, but since then,
SPEAKER_01: he is healed up and now he is also training. Ari, I didn't say you here, I said some things. Yes, I did, sir. There is no problem, right? You went to Wafaa, you went to the training, you made a promise, you waited. Yes. And he says that since the last Wafaa he won, he says he has been training specifically for Hermes and he said he did his best, everything he could do.
SPEAKER_01: He's going there to win, but he says, you know, let's see, you know, just references go and then we will find out. But he said he's not going there to lose, you know.
SPEAKER_04: Ok, so basically he also won the WAAF last year, but it was much more difficult. Instead, this year he won it much more easily because he had a longer rest period that allowed him to heal from some small injuries he had. Basically, he came back stronger than ever, he won it in a way, he says, quite easily. And immediately after he won the WAAF, he started specifically training.
SPEAKER_04: for you, for your weak points, in order to be able to give the best chances to himself to win. And he, however, now, since he is healed from those small injuries, he feels really good. He says, however, that he is very in shape, but that the same can happen to everything, that he will certainly lose, as maybe to win, as anything can happen. However, if he is training in a specific way, he has trained in a specific way for you. Yes, but how much does he train for me?
SPEAKER_01: He's asking how long he has been training to to defeat me or like specifically against me. I mean, since the the Hermes accepted the match, of course. Oh, that's a total match. Not some bravo here. We didn't know. We didn't know who is going to pull who we we knew who is going to pull who Hermes decided. I gave Hermes a few, you know,
SPEAKER_01: a few options you want to pull this you want to pull that or you want to pull that and then Hermes choose so he couldn't Arif couldn't prepare for Hermes specifically because it was Hermes call you understand I give Hermes the options not not to Arif yeah you understand I said Arif yeah Hermes you want to pull this this this he said in fact he said doesn't matter but he said okay let's pull Arif because Arif the world super heavyweight champion
SPEAKER_01: When he asked you who to choose, you chose who you wanted. From there he gave the news and you started training. The current champion has a very important title.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, because he chose Arif basically because he's the world champion now. So it's something not to take lightly. And Engin, if you want, I can read some of the questions. Just one second. The Hermes was like, you know, so suspicious. How long has Arif been specifically training for me? He has been training for you for 15 years. 24 years.
SPEAKER_01: He said he was a little suspicious of this thing. He said, look, Arif is training 15 years for you just to beat you. Yeah, OK, you can add. You just wait. Just choose the question. I will ask something more. Yeah, sure. Hermes, what do you like? Just think, if you beat Arif, you're going to pull Bortolato left arm or right arm? Or not decided yet? Left.
SPEAKER_01: left so if you beat arif with right arm uh do you know what is next for you or is there anything that maybe not said but you you would wish to do it but i mean you wish to pull for example michael todd or or maybe lalatin or i don't know
SPEAKER_04: After your fight with Arif, after your fight with Bartolato di Sinistro, who would you like to choose? One that you can choose anyone, who would you like to go against? Maybe Michael Todd, maybe Laletin, I don't know. You were talking about a fight with Jerry. I would like to go against Jerry or Laletin, let's see.
SPEAKER_03: He would like either Gerica Doretti or Vitali Lampo. I'll think about it after the challenges. I'm too focused on these two challenges. We'll think about it later.
SPEAKER_04: So first of all, he's very focused on Arif and Wagner, so he's not really thinking that far. But afterwards, he would like either to pull Jerry Cadoret, which challenged Hermes openly about it, or Vitaly Laletin, that would like one of these two. But he doesn't really focus about it now. Later, we'll see. But for him, it's no problem pulling. That is how it should be. Just because we make a program, so I'm just trying to make up questions, you know. And
SPEAKER_01: Arif, if I ask you the same thing, do you have a plan for the future if you think that Hermes will win? Or do you have a plan for the future if you think that Hermes will win? Or do you have a plan for the future if you think that Hermes will win? Or do you have a plan for the future if you think that Hermes will win? Or do you have a plan for the future if you think that Hermes will win? Or do you have a plan for the future if you think that Hermes will win? Or do you have a plan for the future if you think that Hermes will win? Or do you have a plan for the future if you think that Hermes will win? Or do you have a plan for the future if you think that Hermes will win? Or do you have a plan for the future if you think that Hermes will win?
SPEAKER_00: But after beating them, I want to continue here. The people I want to work with when I beat Hermes will be people who are stronger than him. I have plans to work with Dave Chaffee, Alex Kurdesha, Laletin, and Levan in the future.
SPEAKER_01: He says that first of all, you know, he has plans for the European championships and the world championships. He wants to continue, you know, pulling the, the, the, there as well, you know, I'm not sure, you know, he wants to continue the doping tested event as well. And, but you know, if he beats you, then he also has also plans like Dave Chaffee.
SPEAKER_01: and you know or maybe Kurdesha maybe Laletin maybe in the future maybe even Levan you know but just like time time will show you know because um you know whenever whenever you you choose different path I mean we all know that you know you may become something else you know that is you know and the questions that you you prepare to ask
SPEAKER_04: Yes, so there were four main questions. There were a lot, but very similar. So I have four questions. So the first one asking was what their opinion on Vitaly versus Alex Kordesha. If you can give your opinion. Yeah, yeah. That match I told, but that match is not set. Okay, it's not set. No, I was told from like, you know, very. You know, like it may be set, but it's not set. I was.
SPEAKER_01: 100% told us yesterday, yeah. Okay. So, next question then, I think. Yeah, if we have a tournament next week, yeah, if you would focus more on East versus West, because it's just last one week. Yeah, in fact, the next question is, they asked their opinion about Sandri Sadis versus Todd Hodgkins. Who do you think they would win? Sandri's winner, Chen's winner.
SPEAKER_01: What do you think? Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: and they're asking about the weight of ermis since he's getting very heavier they're asking what's the limit what how much he's thinking about going maybe 300 pounds um before that you know if they ask you know let's let's ask them about the alex kurdesha and the vitality because that match is going to happen it's not set yet that's what i was told and
SPEAKER_01: but it is going to be set, you know? So what do you think? But I think that they already answer, both answer, because Arif ranked Laletin second, Kurdesha third, and then Ermes ranked Kurdesha second, Laletin third. So it just means that they think that Ermes thinks that Alex is stronger and Arif thinks that
SPEAKER_04: la latina is stronger otherwise why would they rank them right yes am i correct i think so i think so but 50 of the comments are all asking about the la latina so i just thought maybe yes that would be correct that'll be correct yeah and then a little bit of drama questions but they're asking why devon and michael are ducking so many top athletes and directly trying to go for lavon
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, just before that, I think you were asking about the Hermes' current weight. So, Hermes, they ask you, since you're now at 128 kg, they ask you how much you want to get. If, for example, you want to get to 300 pounds, which would be more or less 138-140 kg, what is the limit that you would reach? How much do you want to gain? Now let's see the physical shape that he makes.
SPEAKER_03: I'm in perfect health now. I've done some tests and everything. Even with the hypercaloric diet that I'm doing, the analyzes are all fine. So it's not like going 10 kilos a month, the progression is slow and continuous.
SPEAKER_04: so as of now with his body weight he's feeling very good he's healthy that's the most important thing and he will see in the future but he wants to gain weight but slowly otherwise he says he's not healthy for the body and what's his weight now 128 kilos in the morning 28 yes one two eight wow it's the heaviest hermes oh
SPEAKER_01: With Alex it was 120. Against Alex it was 120. Against Gennady it was 124. Gennady 124 and with Arif it was 120. Arif, what's your weight? 150? 150. Arif is probably a little bit more than 150.
SPEAKER_01: because his scale shows to 150 and lately it shows error, you know. Okay, if we go to the East versus West, I will ask some predictions and we can finish after that. Hermes, what do you think
SPEAKER_03: John versus Hajjumrat. So I said John Brzezinski is my idol. But now I've started to think about it again. I hope there will be a surprise, but if I had to bet, unfortunately, I think it will be Zoroaev.
SPEAKER_04: So I think even though John is his hero, his idol, but he thinks that because he's a little bit older now, he will think that Zolov will win and he will win opening his wrist with a top roll.
SPEAKER_00: He said he respects John so much and he would want him to win, but he thinks that Zolaev has a higher chance.
SPEAKER_03: So basically he wants John to win too, but he thinks Zolev will win too. And Hermes Tatachins vs. Zoner? There's all this resistance and effort. For me it's Zoner.
SPEAKER_01: It's going to be, it's going to come down to who has the most endurance, but he thinks Sonne will win. Wow. Arif, what do you think? I think Tata Chins will win, but I hope he will surprise us there and watch a good match. He thinks that Tata Chins is going to win, he thinks. But he is hoping that Sonne will surprise us.
SPEAKER_01: he's hoping that it will be a good match and if you go to michael todd versus kennedy you you you believe he's gonna win or you want him to win no no i
SPEAKER_04: Do you think he will win or do you want him to win? No, I think he will win and he knows the technique to beat the King Move. He thinks he's going to win because Gennady knows the technique to beat the King Move. I see. What do you think? If Gennady does what he did with Hermes, I think Michael Totti will win.
SPEAKER_00: He thinks that if Gennady comes there in the same shape that he was versus Hermes, then Michael is gonna win. But if he makes his wrist a little bit better,
SPEAKER_01: then he will have a chance, but he doesn't think that it will be an easy match either way. And Morozov versus Prudnik? Hermes, these are tough matches, interesting matches.
SPEAKER_03: Hard to be sure. Yeah. For me, winning... For me, Prudnik will be able to hook it and Prudnik will win. Prudnik will win. So the match will go to the straps and Prudnik will hook it and win. I understand the situation.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, most people think that Prudnik will be easy to lose, but I don't think so. No, he said Prudnik will win. He said Huka will win. No, he said it like that, but in general... In general, I understand. Yes. I think Huka will win when he wins. Will Huka win? It will be a bit difficult, but if he wins, I think he can win. For example, he will be...
SPEAKER_01: will not be easy for nick to hook moroso but if he hooks then he is going to win this is what he says yeah and okay and rambat versus do you know where is it yes georgia georgia yeah now he's over 100 kilo normally we see him like 85 kilo he's now about 100 102 kilo about yeah
SPEAKER_01: Pesa sui 102 chili adesso. Normalmente è 85. Per me vince Zurab. Zurab will win. Yeah. And Arif, what do you think? Zurab. Zurab. Jancic? And... Hermes, do you know Tobias Sporong? Mm-hmm. And...
SPEAKER_01: And then what do you think about his left versus Morozov's left? Tobias trainer told me that Tobias' left arm is 30% stronger than his right arm. That's what he told me. Let's see.
SPEAKER_01: I am a Morozov very strong. What's that? It's a Morozov is very strong. Yeah, you know, the thing is not to take any credit from Morozov. Morozov win versus Arif, but Arif didn't even compete national championships, this year world championships. Arif has some nerve problem here that, you know, his left arm has been injured, especially since his match with Cody.
SPEAKER_01: So we thought that maybe he could pull. So that is only the one round he pulled with Morozov was real. And then he got injured and he couldn't pull. So if people are judging Arif's left and Morozov's left, I'm not saying that Morozov can win, cannot win. I'm not saying that. But that day Arif was very, very in bad shape. And still he cannot pull with left arm. He cannot even train. But Morozov still won versus Deserano with the Superman 6-0. He beat him.
SPEAKER_01: And yeah, Morozov is very strong, but let's see how it will be. To me, I have no idea. They both go outside. I saw some training videos of Tobias after his supermatch with Kurdesha. His left arm looked very, very, very dominant. And I don't know how it will be. We will see, you know, very soon. I mean, I organized the event, but I just can't wait to watch and then find out, you know. I have...
SPEAKER_01: No idea. I don't know. I don't know what to expect, you know, at all. Do you know Morozov and Tobias Sporun? Yes, I do. I know them, but I haven't seen a match between them before.
SPEAKER_00: That's why I don't think it's right to comment on it. Morozovic might be right, but... 30% more powerful than Tobias. Antrenor told me that. Yes, if he's 30% more powerful, I'd like to see how the match will end. He said that he has never seen Tobias pulling left arm. It is not easy for him to have any opinion about this match. And I reminded him what his trainer said.
SPEAKER_04: and then he said that if his left is that much stronger than his right and then he said he would like to see that much is this what he said and ermis beth keely do you know beth keely
SPEAKER_01: Betkini Oniani from Georgia. Betkini Oniani is the world champion with left arm. He's going to pull Oleg Zok in this event. But do you know Betkini or not at all? Yes. And do you think Oleg Zok will dominate or do you think that any little chance?
SPEAKER_03: Giorgiano has a lot of possibilities. Unfortunately, when Zocca came back, I didn't see him in great shape. He's no longer the Zocca of the past. In my opinion, if Giorgiano comes back in good shape, he'll win. It's a 90kg limit. We usually saw 75kg and 80kg, but now he'll be 90kg.
SPEAKER_04: Wow. And he is 190 something height. So more weight is kind of better for him, but let's see. He said that he thinks that Betkino Niani will win because Oleg Dzok, after the incident he had and he came back, it doesn't look like Oleg as before, as strong as before. So he thinks the Georgian will win. Yeah, but Oleg, even before his
SPEAKER_01: uh, accident, you know, like in 2015, um, I, I, I, in the Malaysia wars, I flash Mazgan Shamia from Kazakhstan. I, I won the gold there. And then 40 days later, Mazgan Shamia just flashed Oleg Dzogder. And some people thought that Oleg wasn't ready for the goal or something. But after that match, uh, Mantas Asmonas from Lithuania and
SPEAKER_01: he's very strong bicep and Mazgan Shamiev had one minute and 10 second hook match and then hardly Mazgan won and he was that tired in the final second final in the strap he still gave Zogh 20 seconds long match after one minute and 10 seconds and if you come to 2018 WAF Leman Dimitrov kind of took Oleg Zogh's wrist this was also before the accident and you know
SPEAKER_01: It was like maybe 20, 25 seconds and finally Oleg won, but his wrist was just like... So what I'm just saying is that even before the accident, you know, when he competed in the European and World Championships, the guys in his class sometimes, sometimes, not all the time, gave him some trouble, you know. He basically described three matches in which Oleg Dzok...
SPEAKER_03: even before he was vulnerable, let's say, Zoc. Yes, in fact, what he says is wrong, that he is vulnerable. I was saying, to tell him that he was vulnerable, or Zoc, before the incident, but after the incident, even more, in the sense,
SPEAKER_01: From what I understood, the brain can't put his arm well. From what they told me, I don't know. So indeed, as you said, even before his accident, he was vulnerable in some sense. Not vulnerable, but sometimes he had troubles as well. Like this year he had trouble a little bit with who he had troubles? With Bojidar, you know, a little bit he had trouble, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: But he thinks that after the accident, it will be even worse because he heard somewhere that now he has a neurological problem, which doesn't allow him to really access 100% power on the left. That's what he heard from people close to him. I don't know, except like Bojidar, Talgat was just trying to sleep his head like this. Other guys, he won very convincingly, but I don't know his condition.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know his condition, but I don't know. Let's see. Let's see what will happen. Arif, what do you think about Oleg Zok and Betkili's match? Oleg Zok didn't appear in his former form in the last World Championship, but I think he's still good enough to beat Betkili. He doesn't think that Betkili is as good as before.
SPEAKER_01: But he said he still would be good enough to beat Betchini. I mean, Oleg Zok would beat Betchini still, you know. He thinks that he's good enough to beat him, yeah. Okay. So you think Oleg Zok will win against Betchini? Yeah. Another question. Hermes, with left arm, Efe, you know Efe? Yes. Efe versus Rambet? Yes.
SPEAKER_01: Effe. Effe wins? Yes, sure. But when you saw Effe here, he was 126 kilos. This time there is a weight limit 115. And so now he will be about 10 kilos lighter than last time. No, but Toprol is very, very strong. He's Toprol. Yeah, strong. He will take runs. Yes. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I ask him, you know,
SPEAKER_04: Like, if I would inform you about how the training goes between Efe and him, as of now, he said, no need to tell Hermes. That's for our supporters. What? He basically said that since he's his sparring partner, jokingly, he didn't want to say too much about Efe to not make people know too much.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I,
SPEAKER_01: Anyway, so I think it will be very good. You coming on 10th, right, Hermes? Yeah, 10th, 13th. Yeah. It will be good. It will be very good. It will be fun. It will be very nice. Hermes, how long have you been pulling? 10 years. 10 years?
SPEAKER_03: I had injuries, big injuries here for three years. My question is, could this be one of the
SPEAKER_04: best high-level events that you have ever seen yeah of course we we talked about it yesterday he said that he thinks in his life he never seen something more amazing and incredible than this event he was really speechless this is it's amazing it's really i love it i love it yes i i just love it you know i mean i i i just wanted to set you know what i would like to see
SPEAKER_01: understand so i understand from arm wrestling so i just think that this would be good this would be good and it is good that you know we show people you know um like that there are like some divided areas in the world in arm wrestling so it is good to find someone from kazakhstan and i said from north america of course those matches got cancelled because marcia got covered and then cody had the is uh not the ulna but the other one um
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah. And it was broken, so something happened again. But it is good that, you know, you from from guys from Canada, from the US, from Sweden, go to Kazakhstan, Russia and Georgia, Bulgaria, Ukraine and all these top guys to bring them together. And then, you know, I hope I really hope that I did a huge investment. I really hope that
SPEAKER_01: Community will support. Trust me, I don't want to do even one extra dollar than what is spent here. Why I would want community support is, trust me, so I can do more. Because if I lose a lot, I can continue. I'm not a rich guy.
SPEAKER_01: But if they support, I can do more and more. But if the community says that it's not needed, it's not necessary, it's OK. Even if I lose huge money, I would just say, OK, I gave my life to this sport, and this is the community I love. And I will just say, it's OK. I did something good that will probably not be forgotten. And it's good satisfaction. So Hermes things is a big event.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, we spoke about it yesterday and also on the Facebook groups and the community and the comments on YouTube. And really, we cannot thank you enough for what you did. It's really amazing. I am also thankful for those sports that, you know, we see whenever you talk like this, it motivates me, understand? I'm like, okay. And our Mastin fan is happy, you know, this is what I think, you know. Yeah, but no, it's everybody. Even like in Italy, we have our little communities and so on from the pullers.
SPEAKER_04: and everybody is trying to come to istanbul it's going to be incredible also in the comments they're like thanking you every three four comments thank you anger for amazing things that you do for the sport thank you so much thank you so much so it's it's awful yeah that's motivation for me what's that number one number one number one yeah
SPEAKER_00: As you said, I think it's the best event. It's as big an organization as I've never seen before. I hope it goes as we want and continues. I'm very happy to be in this organization. Since I started playing black, I've always dreamed of such competitions.
SPEAKER_00: Engin Terzi, John Birzing, Zolev, Michael Todd, and many other sportsmen. It was one of the biggest tournaments I've ever watched. I'm one of them, too. One of the top matches. Yes. He said he has been dreaming since he started armwrestling.
SPEAKER_01: to watch this kind of events, you know, with the Michael Dodd and John Brzenk and all these guys. And he says, forget about now watching. I'm part of it with one of the main events, you know, and he is very, very
SPEAKER_04: Arif's dream was to see a similar event live, and now his dream has come true and it's one of the matches of the event, so it's still a double dream. It's hard to find yourself with all the champions in an event like this.
SPEAKER_03: to exchange opinions. Usually when you go to an event, you find one, two, three. Finding so many people, so many champions in a single event is fantastic. Tell me. You are lucky to meet so many in one shot. When you saw the list, you practically did not lose us with all the names that are on it.
SPEAKER_04: So he said that when the first list came out, he was not going to believe all the names that were going to be challenged. And the other thing is that it's so nice and beautiful to have so many champions from all over the world gathered together for one competition. And it's such a big community and almost like a family coming together. And it's really unbelievable. Yeah. Also, I would like to say this came to my mind. I have been armwrestling for 30 years.
SPEAKER_01: 30 years. And I have never met an Italian that I get negative electric, you know, as a friend, you know, always the Italians were, I mean, I think that not only to me, but you know, our teams together, you know, we're always even before Hermes, Hermes is kind of new ones, since we are pulling some of our guys, late 80s, we remember Hermes his father,
SPEAKER_01: ermis is new yeah but um like i don't know because you're reminded about the italians but you know especially your president and other guys gladio and other guys i don't know italians have always been always been very friendly always been very friendly and greetings to italy and of course to all around the world to all uh arm wrestling fans
SPEAKER_03: The last question and we're finishing. Devon is winning or Lawan is winning, Hermes? I have a lot of respect for Devon and for Faro's arm, as I said in the last video. The thing that bothers me a bit is that...
SPEAKER_03: Two, he managed to get to Levan thanks to his fame on social media. Because I think he had to face many other people before he could get to Levan. He always challenged Michael Todd and then went straight to Levan. So I don't think that's right. He had to challenge, I don't know, Aletín or Cefico. He wanted to go like that.
SPEAKER_03: He said that first of all he wants to say that in his opinion this match is not worthy because Devin
SPEAKER_04: got Levan without even trying to fight top two, three, four guys in the world, not even Vitaly, not even Dave. So he just was inactive for a lot of time, beat Michael and go straight to Levan. He thinks that he only got there because of his fame and notoriety on social media. But that aside, he thinks that because he spoke with Levan Saganashvili and he asked him, what is he going to do?
SPEAKER_04: And Levan told him that he's going to be the best shape of ever of his life. So he thinks that Devin, no matter how heavy, no matter how big, no matter how strong, no matter how prepared, he will basically get annihilated against Levan. That's what he thinks. Another question before I ask the same thing to Arif. What does Hermes think, honestly? You know, Hermes is the type of guy that I will excuse my language, but he doesn't give a shit, you know, about
SPEAKER_01: what people thinks and he just directly gives his uh opinion you know it's it's same like in the press conference that he did you know in dubai it it's supposed to be john versus devon and then ermus just got the microphone and the things changed you know and he said okay just bring the table you know let's go you know and so hermes has a spirit that you know uh is ready you understand he's ready so honestly what does he think
SPEAKER_04: It's Chance versus Devon. So, since you are a sly person who doesn't lie, who is 100% open and transparent, you want to do this with this answer. You against Devon. Who wins? Two rules. Two rules. If it was Vile, who has always done what he did in America, I would have lost for sure.
SPEAKER_03: But now in Dubai, they have Bill Collins, he's very good. Even if with John Brzezinski he managed to make a mistake, because he's good in the set-up. But if he puts it with the right WAF rules, as I did with Matt Maas, I destroy him, 100%. I open his wrist and crush him down.
SPEAKER_04: Okay, so he said that with the old WAR rules, he thinks that he would probably lose because Devin knows how to get away with a lot of things and quote-unquote cheat. But he said that with these rules now, even in King of the Table, Bill Collins is such a good referee that it's so much better. But if the rules are WAF, he will just obliterate him, annihilate, take his wrist and destroy him to the pad.
SPEAKER_04: WDF rules, he will just destroy him. Because he has too many weak points, the wrist and so on. His wrist is so much stronger than his, so there is no chance, he thinks, for Devin. Yeah, and he thinks that he cannot hook him because of his pronator. He can't hook him.
SPEAKER_04: What if he goes? He has the shoulder press to finish? Yeah, I told you. So the same technique he did with Michael Todd, but even worse, even stronger. Now, yeah. At that time, now he's probably minimum 20 kilos heavier, right? 30 kilos. Because I guess Michael Todd... 30 kilos. Actually, 35. Because I guess Michael, he was only 95 kilos.
SPEAKER_01: Oh yeah. So it's almost, almost 35. Yeah. It's a, you, you, you are not only a translator, but you are just like, like, you know, every single thing about him. He didn't even say his weight. You were like, you know, actually he was 95 kilos. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Ermis is my buddy. I know so many things about him. You are a fan of him, right? Fan of him also. Of course. I could just hear and he couldn't say anything. I could speak with you, but I'm just doing it as a respect with him to speak. Ermis, you go home. We don't need you. He knows everything. Arif, if we come to you, what do you think of Levan Devun?
SPEAKER_01: By the way, Levan said to Hermes, I will go there in the best condition I can in my life. Yes, yes. So he's already going higher every year.
SPEAKER_00: I think this is one of the games I want to win the most. I think, according to the VAL rule, I think Levan will win. There is only one possibility. After talking to you, after thinking about it, of course it made sense. If Levan can get tired, but I think that's a very small possibility.
SPEAKER_00: I don't think Levan will be able to keep up with him. I don't think Levan will be able to keep up with him. If he could, he could have done the same thing with Deniz before. If he could, he could have done the same thing with Deniz before. If he could, he could have done the same thing with Deniz before. If he could, he could have done the same thing with Deniz before.
SPEAKER_01: And he thinks that no matter what the rule is, he says that, you know, Levan is going to win. And he says that, you know, maybe if he just totally tires, you know, Levan before the match starts, then he says a very small chance
SPEAKER_03: then maybe it's possible.
SPEAKER_03: The only possibility is that he goes to the King's Move and Levan can't press and Mari Levan gets tired. Maybe he can have a 0.5% chance.
SPEAKER_04: So the only thing, the only chance for Devin is because we never saw Levan try to fight a Kings mover. And maybe if he doesn't know the technique, there might be 0.5% possibility that maybe he gets a bit tired and he might actually take a win. Because Levan, we never see him press or try to beat somebody with a Kings move. That's the only very little doubt that he might have. That's it. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I think that Levan would be considering that. But I don't know, when you are sometimes too confident, you may make a mistake, but time will show. Let's see how it will be. Anyway, so thank you very, very much Issa, Ermes, Arif. And hope to see you guys next week. And then let's write history all together. And after the matches,
SPEAKER_01: I top roll you, Hermes, okay? Okay. Okay. Just joking. Y'all take care. Take care, okay? Okay. Thank you, everyone. Thank you, everyone, for watching. Thank you. See you next time.
