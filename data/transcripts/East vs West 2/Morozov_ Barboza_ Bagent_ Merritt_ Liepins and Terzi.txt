Travis said that he was going to also be part of it. But, you know, Travis, it's hard to know about him. So now. So how is everything, Marcio? Everything great.
SPEAKER_03: Busy week for me. Work the whole week. I've been working so much. And then I decided to take a week off. Then I'm going to start my preparation. I have something, some stuff in the schedule. My family always take this week off. And that's it. And as soon as I get back, I'm going to start my preparation. Yeah, you already look good.
SPEAKER_03: against the guy i prepared for my last match i think it was like what uh three weeks ago yeah yeah yeah and then after that i didn't i was gonna take off until for the match i was gonna take a little bit off and then uh come back in the beginning of the year i have a question i didn't watch all the matches but i saw that you didn't allow him to go to step you just pin him did you beat him in step as well or all were without the step yeah the first match went to the straps
SPEAKER_03: Oh, you beat him also in the strap. Was it, was it? Yeah, the first match we went to the strap, we got a long, you know, long lever, long hands. Yeah. I couldn't contain, because it was, before the go, it was trying to... Yeah, yeah, yeah, I understand. It's, uh, he was not supposed to load, he loaded a little bit, so, uh, the other matches, I just tried to contain him and put him down. Gonna go to the straps too, but just decided to do it that way. Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.
SPEAKER_01: Ramons, can you ask Artem? His right arm was injured when he came to Istanbul about one and a half year ago. And then we saw him in a Russian event. His right didn't seem still like so good. But is his right arm right now like healed up and good? Guys, by the way, I don't have... Ramons, how do I follow
SPEAKER_01: the the the super chats while i'm on i'll i'll follow it you don't worry about it okay you do okay thank you very much
SPEAKER_04: Because my wife is not here. I was usually following with his phone, her phone, I mean. Yeah, but this time they are out to movies with my son. So, okay, can you translate that? Yes, yes. Artem, I want to ask you about the past. About a year and a half ago you were in Istanbul and you had problems with your right hand. And you participated somewhere in Russia, Siberia, right?
SPEAKER_04: Yes, that's right. Your left foot is great, right? Do you still have problems with your right foot? Or is everything fine now? Everything is fine, everything is fine. My right foot is stronger than my left. And you feel that your right foot is stronger too? Yes. You know, you feel it, you feel it. And when you compete with everyone?
SPEAKER_04: I look at my weight, at my work, at my training. The right one is much better. So you think that the right one, if anything, is better than it was in Siberia, right? Yes. Look, in Siberia, I was in two tournaments in a row.
SPEAKER_04: Yes, I remember. Yes, there were two tournaments in a row. If I hadn't fought Vitaly and Lalitin behind the scenes after the Siberian Power Show, if I hadn't fought there, I would have fought well in Omsk. It's just that the Siberian Power Show tournament is going on, then the armfight with Grigory Leshchuk.
SPEAKER_04: And the tournament itself starts after the armfight. The left was fresh, rested, and the right didn't have time to recover. I'm left because I didn't fight anyone. I was right behind the scenes, and the left didn't touch.
SPEAKER_04: so he he said that uh uh it's it's way better now than it was and his right has always been his best arm uh he said his left always looks better because he kind of uh keeps it away from extra competition and that time when he was in siberia he was uh pulling super match and then tournament and then he's uh also fighting vitality
SPEAKER_04: you know behind the scenes so he says by the weights it's way stronger than his left and he feels that now there's there's no issues no injuries and it should be his better arm and what's his weight he when he was he came here he was about 120 kilo it's and also can you ask him his height you know i i think it's like about 195 or something it's like six six four or six four or something yes
SPEAKER_01: 195 centimeters and 128 kilos oh 128 he's much heavier than the time that yeah when he came here he was 120 but he was totally ripped you know all just like vascular blood veins he's six five ten huh six five yeah yeah yeah yeah i understand yeah so he's he feels his right arm better now and
SPEAKER_01: okay cody hello yeah hey how come you didn't ask me to translate i i didn't ask you what to translate i'm i'm jumping off cody's here yeah um i want to ask to uh cody um cody uh how have you been my friends like uh as a form
SPEAKER_02: Like you broke your arm, you made a quick contact. It's been spectacular. It's been like... Yeah, so my shape is round, like really round. But I feel good. The arm's getting better. I have some... I don't know what you call it when you're pressing and then you relax and you let off the tension or the pressure. I get like shooting pains through my forearm. I've been trying to work on that.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know why it's doing that, but I think it has to do with the supinator muscle when they, when they, uh, did the surgery on my arm and put the plate in, they, uh, yeah, but you can see the scar there, but they had to cut a lot of the supinator muscle away. And I think it's just growing pains and healing pains from that. Uh, I feel strong, but then when I, when I let off pressure, it just,
SPEAKER_02: it hurts really bad for about 30 seconds. And then it's kind of in my head. But it will be okay, right? Oh yeah. For some reason that when I'm at an event and the adrenaline's going, I don't ever feel it.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, you even broke your arm and you didn't even feel it. You just continue. I don't know how you did that. To me, up to this day, I don't understand it. How did you continue pulling with a broken arm? It's like against everything I know about a human being, you know?
SPEAKER_02: like well i didn't i i didn't know it was broken when it happened i just felt it pop i thought it was like a muscle or a tendon or something like that um i just know my hand went completely numb i couldn't feel like how did you how did you continue and win still you know just i don't understand that part how did it hold on you know the arm in the hand and everything
SPEAKER_02: that's that's the mystery i am when i talk to my doctor about it yeah he the only thing he could think of is because of well we as arm wrestlers we train those muscles in the forearm so much and normally our forearms are quite a bit bigger than normal yeah and he he felt like all the other muscles around that bone acted as a cast and held that bone in place
SPEAKER_01: I understand but listen listen I have been in this sport for 30 years I have seen many broken arms the first thing I see either they are crying either they just hold their hand and then bring the chair there and it can't even move you know like and then whenever I see you
SPEAKER_01: pulling and then you send me your your your x-rays you know and then i was like how like it's just like like you are you're not a human normal human being you know you're a human being but a normal one for sure you know so i have a question i know you're a humble person but uh are you going to be this young russian guy i i i want to yeah but what do you think what do you think honestly if you don't play the humble guy
SPEAKER_02: well i think that he's a freak like he is just an abnormal looking person and um super super strong i uh i feel like i have a chance but yeah yeah if you want you can uh step back i can replace you with someone else you know if you're not that confident
SPEAKER_01: well i i would prefer to come still yeah yeah but so you have more more hopes than what you are showing right now because you are like you know he's freaky he's so strong and i have chance you know like uh yeah well i i believe i have a chance with everybody um yeah but what's the chance what's the chance from one to 100 what do you think your chance oh shoot and you know i'm not good at this stuff
SPEAKER_01: come on come on that's what i'm trying for because you are like this way all the time just tell us what you feel i i would prefer to let other people make that decision on what they think i i feel like i'm competitive so you you believe in yourself you you are can you say you're confident um
SPEAKER_01: yeah i think so okay because i get this much from you yeah yeah yeah let's see let's see you know how it will be uh can you a little bit you know translate him or the last part you know like
SPEAKER_01: so let's see what what also uh i will i will ask him i will ask what else more also what morozov thinks about his chance versus uh cody let's start with the left arm and then we go right arm he said his right arm is better one and yeah so i feel bad for marcio because he says his right arm is better yeah listen listen uh raymond
SPEAKER_01: uh travis also cannot enter he said he tried can you also somehow get the travis in that that that that's important just just somehow just just take tell to morozov that we are trying to get travis in so he doesn't get upset about you know why he's waiting because you are trying something okay um yeah it's travis wasn't he wasn't in the same chat that we were yeah
SPEAKER_04: said he wasn't on the same chat that we were okay okay then i'll mess no he wasn't he wasn't he wasn't yeah yeah i'll i'll ask artem let's answer that and just yeah yeah okay okay okay uh i asked him uh how much does he knows about cody
SPEAKER_04: Only the fact that he fought at the World Championship in Romania. Last year, you didn't think that he would go to the States, right? He's on the left and he's the strongest there.
SPEAKER_04: I didn't know. I didn't know. How do you feel? What are your chances against her? Because many people think that she is number two or three in the world. Well, chances... You know, I'll put it this way. Don't say a word until I jump over it. When we fight, it will be clear. Well, you know our Russian sayings. I know, I know.
SPEAKER_04: Give me a little bit more. You know that you will have a match with him. You watched the video. You know what the plan will be. Where is better, where not to go. You know that he broke his arm last year.
SPEAKER_04: He broke his arm in a super match in the first round and then won the other two rounds. And it wasn't some kind of, well, he broke it. It was, he broke it. Not bad. Not bad, not bad. Let's put it this way. I think I will win 100%. Like this. Well, I don't care how to fight.
SPEAKER_04: Absolutely. Either in the biceps or in the top. I mean, the hook, the top. I can also fight in the triceps. I can start, I can not start, I can give a fight, I can win quickly. How do you like endurance? Endurance is excellent. Excellent. Do you like these, how to say, long matches? Yes, I like it.
SPEAKER_04: I asked him how much... Before that, were you able to reach Travis? No, I was talking, I'm sorry. Okay, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: So I asked him how much he knows about Cody. So I told him about Cody. I told him all the massacre he's been doing in USA. And he's in a conversation of being one of the absolute best left hands on the planet and that he broke his arm. And after all that, he said, I'm going to win 100%.
SPEAKER_04: It doesn't matter where the match goes. I can hook, top roll, if needed, press. Doesn't matter if I need to be fast or slow. But he said, I feel like I'm going to win, but let's cross that bridge when we get there. So he's going to, he said that he's going to win anyways, huh? Yeah. Okay. And... And you take over, I'll send message to Travis. Okay, okay. So...
SPEAKER_01: What do you think, Cody, after this answer? Well, I would expect him to... Do you think that your opponent is playing like a confident guy, you know, or you really think that he really believes that he's going to beat you badly, as he says? I would expect him to feel like he was going to win. I don't think anybody would take a match if they didn't think they were in it.
SPEAKER_01: um and it applies for you too yeah oh yeah okay yeah i think that's the case yeah yeah um i would i you know you know sorry sorry for cutting you but you know you are very humble guy but if i a little bit more try i will make you like you know uh conor mcgregor before this program finishes now ingen would you like it if i did that to you like you had a match and because you're a humble guy as well yeah
SPEAKER_02: It depends on my opponent. If my opponent is really a forward guy, a challenging guy, I would be a little bit different. It totally depends on the opponent. Well, I think that Artem is a really good arm wrestler. I've seen a lot of his videos. It seems like there's more right-handed videos than there are left-handed, but he seems to arm wrestle very similar with both arms.
SPEAKER_02: um and i'm glad to hear that his right is stronger than his left that means marcio's in for a world to hurt um but i i too feel like i'm pretty well-rounded in arm wrestling i think i can do a few different things i've got i'm not just a one-trick pony um
SPEAKER_02: I feel like I can compete with others in different positions as well. But Artem does have advantages. He's got a longer arm than I do. He's got a bigger hand than I have. He obviously spends more time in the gym than I do. But I'm excited about the match. I really am. I'm excited to come over and hang out in Turkey. The last time I was there, I absolutely loved it.
SPEAKER_02: that's been my wife and i's probably favorite place that we've been to for arm wrestling uh we really enjoyed being there so we're excited to go back and i think my daughter and her husband are going to join us too and we're going to make a little family vacation out of it so it should be fun time yep okay looks like i am not successful yeah it's probably not going to work yeah so so he him him like uh trying to provocate you
SPEAKER_02: uh it doesn't really uh concern you right this is what you're saying not really no um i would want him to i want him to be confident i want him to believe in himself i want to have i want to build arm wrestle the best otter motors off that there is so i i hope that he does come super confident yeah but if if
SPEAKER_01: you lose you are not going to say that right because he has a longer arm and a bigger hand and he has spent more time of course i am i'm going to make every excuse i can okay that's the preparation already okay that's what i he's he's younger he's handsomer there's a lot of things yeah i'm going to make up every excuse i can the second part that the handsomer is really important factor in our medicine it is well yeah for sure
SPEAKER_01: mean look at marcio that guy is super hot yeah anyways by the way you know the first time first time i saw you was 2003 tahoe nevada there you beat barbosa with with left arm then i was like who is this guy the beating barbosa lefty i remember there
SPEAKER_01: but i think barbosa was pulling two classes i think one class below one i think that that 242 or something and 220 or something and then i also pulled the shippers i remember okay yeah he had tough matches with john we have two superman class what's that he's he had he had matches with john brazink in the lighter weight class that day so i i i think we left up left time did you have problems with him some yeah me no no john
SPEAKER_01: John, with left arm. You're talking about me? Yes. Yeah, you had a problem with him. Right arm, I remember you beat him once in the strap, but the last match, he didn't allow you to go, so he hooked you right away. Yeah, it was a long, long match. Yeah, long match, yeah. Yeah, and I lefty, I had problems with him too. I think I beat John in the first round, and I beat Cody in the first round competing, but then in the final, I had a war with John. Oh. And lefty.
SPEAKER_01: And I don't know if you won by fouls one, then I won the other one, but I had like a war. And then I pulled Cody right away. Cody took my wrist and beat me twice. Yeah, I didn't know that. I didn't know that you beat Cody in the first meeting. Wow. He did, yeah. Yeah. He was too fast for me. Yeah. Lately, you are even faster. Hey, Travis, you came?
SPEAKER_01: Yep, right here. Right here, the man. I will be back to you, Travis. Let me talk with Marcio. Okay, Marcio, with right arm, your opponent is 8 kg, about 20 pounds, near 20 pounds, 18 pounds, whatever. It's heavier than last time I saw him. He was very young then, probably 22 or something, or 21, now probably 24. And he says that his right arm is completely healed up.
SPEAKER_01: And this guy is very confident coming from Kazakhstan. And he has no doubt in his head that he's going to beat Cody and you. And what are your thoughts about it? I saw some comments from you on my page. You said the good luck with that kind of thinking. Well, first of all, I appreciate that you thought about me being part of this.
SPEAKER_03: it's uh it's an honor to be you know a legend you are a legend of course i'm gonna think about it i just didn't know you were active last time i remember you were injured remember i was invited whenever i saw the last match i was like okay marshal is back you know yeah i actually felt my elbow but it didn't affect anything in a match it's hard it's uh so many miles on the arm you just gotta train smart not so hard you know but um
SPEAKER_03: I guess, uh, my experience, I mean, I have a lot more, a lot more experience than Arden and, uh, he seems to be a very, uh, very good everywhere, but I don't know if it's very, that experience, uh, sometimes our experience, you know, plays a lot in our favor. I don't know how strong he did. I saw a lot of the matches. I paid attention on him before, like a couple of years ago when I started looking at him, like, uh, you know, rising star of the sport is very promising.
SPEAKER_03: i don't know how good it is i'm sure it's good uh yeah it's about 130 kilos almost and uh low leverage and everything but you know sometimes you minimize those things on the table using your experience you know you know you're not coming for a vacation that's for sure yeah yeah unfortunately i had this planned out you know on the schedule but i'll be and i do the best that i could do in probably four weeks
SPEAKER_03: and see how it comes out. But in my mind, I go confident. It doesn't matter if it's four weeks or ten weeks. In my mind, it's just set for whatever the challenge I have. Can you be at your best ever? Say again? Like you, since the match was set, you had 45, 50 days. Do you think you can reach your best ever shape? I can't say that I'm going to do as much as I can. I'm not sure. It depends on the progression. I'm going to try...
SPEAKER_03: to progress a lot, you know, in a short period of time. And we'll see if, you know, but, you know, if I wouldn't accept the match, but I didn't think I can win. So. I understand. Are you there? I am here, man. This fucking show is so boring. I almost fell asleep. Yeah, yeah. This young guy from Kazakhstan, he says that he's going to come to Istanbul and he's going to be
SPEAKER_01: to all these Americans. And he says that he says that after that, you know, he's going to if if you and Devon has have enough of both, he's going to kick your ass and Devon's ass as well. Like, yes, yes. This is what he says. Hey, listen, listen. Probably has a better chance to beat me and Devon than he does to beat Cody and Marcio right now. So I was talking about right now. He's talking about when you are ready.
SPEAKER_01: well i will tell you this will you step up arm wrestle people from kazakhstan anyway say again my dad told me don't ever arm wrestle god from kazakhstan anyway okay okay so we invited the wrong person here we we thought that we invited someone that you know who can be yesterday when i asked him
SPEAKER_01: like you wouldn't you want to put me in istanbul he was like oh i am american homo brave and this and that now he said that that was against you i'm not afraid of turkish guys it's the kazakhstans that i don't really how many how many kazakhs beat you till today no never never but perry and i we beat you
SPEAKER_01: no i don't where's the tape where's the tape i have i have the i have witnesses but i have i have paid about ferret beating you both in zloki and in vegas yeah yeah wow okay okay i'm wrong about it you are i have beat the out of ferret for a long time okay i get it you just want to talk about the times that he beat me you never beat him right arm
SPEAKER_01: Well, that's because when I've got the trophy, he's got sixth place. That's not my fault. No, no, no, no. Not my fault. He was second place in the weight category. One time he was. No, in the same event. Then you did in the overalls after he and Pushkar killed each other. That's how you won the, yeah, yeah. Oh, so that's how you beat me and it's all good.
SPEAKER_00: no you only had a 20 seconds magic like that then i was only starting to kill her okay whatever you know welcome to engins and travis show no i'm sorry i tried to give you guys 20 minutes before i knew i was going to take over the show so that's why i was late well you got coach on here coach i didn't know the coach was on here
SPEAKER_00: He's going to get you talking. Coach ought to be doing all the talking. This is what I'm talking. He's here to translate all the bull crap that you throw out there. Who's he translating?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah. All of us. Raimonds, Raimonds, tell Morozov that Travis is not brave enough as Morozov guessed. And he said he will never step on his way of Morozov. Hold on, hold on, hold on. His father told him not to arm wrestle the Kazakhs. So just translate, please, Raimonds. I didn't know the guy couldn't understand English. Listen, you tell that guy that I crawl over people like him to get to the fight.
SPEAKER_04: What do you say? I'll tell the first part. Did that guy just call me a faggot? Did that guy? No. I know a little Kazakh saying. How you doing, young man?
SPEAKER_04: He said fighting with Kazakhs is like going with a knife in a gunfight. Well, listen, you tell him that he better hope that Vladimir Putin don't come over there and take that land back over. All right, so relax.
SPEAKER_01: i mean let's get into this let's keep politics out of this yeah yeah yeah yeah um okay yeah i really thought that travis would have a mind set that you know he is coming because cody he told me in june he said he's gonna destroy you this is what he told me travis told me
SPEAKER_00: He told me the same thing. What we understand is that he is not afraid of Americans, but he is afraid of the Kazakhs. I'm afraid of anybody that you, Engin, set me up with in Turkey. You are not afraid? I am afraid of anybody that you set. If you set it up, then I'm worried. Why? Because I don't think that you have my best interests at heart.
SPEAKER_01: what do you agree i think you would like to see me get raped and pillaged over there but it's not gonna happen it's because you don't have the courage you know i invited here i thought that you would beat arsene lillier you just i mean came here like a basket no you didn't no yeah yeah i really thought that as a heavyweight you would be the 90 kilo guy but what to do you know
SPEAKER_00: yeah you knew ali you knew when we took that match this was a money match i'm not like the rest of these guys i'm not like marcio i will take the money even if i'm not in shape even if i don't think i can win and i didn't do that but listen the next time i come over there i'm bringing hell with me you remember that you will bring who what hell i'm bringing hell baby this hell has passport
SPEAKER_01: Just like I did in Moldova. If that guy shows up like was in Moldova, I'll run over that dude. Okay, Bobby, you said that next time I invite you, you will come here in a very great shape. But now you are saying that, or a while ago you were saying that you would not come here
SPEAKER_01: You would not pull anyone that I said to you. Well, I didn't say I wouldn't pull. I said I'm scared because I don't trust you. I think that if you invite a guy from the East over there, you're bringing him there to get ass with him. Listen, you are scared of your own self. You know, if you're just good enough, you're going to beat him. You know, if you are not good enough, you always claim like you are the best and this and that and that.
SPEAKER_00: and then you you you just give tons of to devon and then now look at you you are saying that you know so i mean i'm saying what that i don't trust you if you get the match up i know it's going to be difficult and i know i'm the underdogs the problem is is that i have so much skill level i don't care if i come over there trust me i'm going to whip your guys
SPEAKER_01: Okay. But I can set you with the junior guy from your 16 years old, 55 kilo. Yeah. Hey Marcio, do you think that this, this guy Travis will ever be like shape again? Or you think that this guy is just has been, has been, he looks bad. I mean, good, you know, right now, but what do you think Marcio? I don't think he's ready for anything right now, but if you set the match with
SPEAKER_03: some you know some time ahead i think you he can prepare and be ready yeah but but marcio probably you are thinking right now that travis will never need to pull morozov after february 12th right i don't know i think uh travis motivation is according to the to the money that he offered if he pulls right now yeah
SPEAKER_01: No, no, no, no. I mean, since you're going to beat Morozov, so Travis will probably, I mean, not really need to understand. I'm not saying you cannot beat Travis. You have beaten, but I'm just saying that that is the only thing that Morozov challenged a lot. And now he needs to back his words, you know, when he comes to Istanbul. Can you tell him, Raimonds, that, you know, he knows that, you know, he talked, that he's so confident.
SPEAKER_00: And he needs to back, you know, his words when he come to Istanbul on February 12th. I don't think he is that confident. I think that you're coaching him up. I coaching him up? I think you coached his trash talking up. No. Yeah, you told him what to say. You said, oh, tell him you'll kill him and that'll be good for the show.
SPEAKER_01: kill him no he just watch watch watch watch watch his older videos you you will see you know how this guy has huge fire in him just forget it can you translate diamonds i will deal with you later yes yes yes uh
SPEAKER_04: that these are big fights that will happen for you, because you said that you will win. Engin thinks that you 100% think that you will win. But if you don't win, how are you about it? Or you don't have a chance that you will lose to Kodia and Marcio? Damn, well, you can't think that you will lose. You can't. You always have to.
SPEAKER_04: okay there was definitely a smart ass comment at the end i saw the smile
SPEAKER_04: He's a deep guy. He's a lot of philosophical stuff going around here. So he said, first of all, you cannot doubt yourself. If you doubt yourself, you're going to lose. And he said, I'll translate this as best as I can. You cannot kill the one who challenged that. Just make something up. You cannot kill the one who challenges that. Oh, okay.
SPEAKER_01: yeah so it was like you mean you mean like you cannot challenge uh you cannot kill a guy who challenged that or something yeah oh okay okay okay okay so as i said deep guy short dancers a lot of philosophical stuff there yeah yeah so travis are you coming here to istanbul
SPEAKER_00: hooked me yeah i don't know maybe i gotta see how much i can squeeze out of you yeah i will only buy your ticket hey yeah you gotta hook me up with your boss let me talk to the boss who's his boss your boss i am the boss oh no no no no no you gotta find somebody else but i can't no no no no no i don't have a boss i'm i'm just organizing
SPEAKER_01: Yep. Call me Ozzy. I will call me Ozzy. Yeah. Okay. You can call me Ozzy. So what, what I, okay. I want you to do the press conference. I want you to sit at the middle of the both sides, east and west, and then just do the press conference. It would be, it would be fun. Don't you think you're going to piss those other guys off when I come over there and I'm sitting there?
SPEAKER_00: I think, I think me and Travis should do the commentary. I'll talk common sense and he'll talk Travis. No, no. I think you'll talk amateur. And then when the pros come, I'll start talking about the pros. Perfect. Perfect. No. Fun to help us with the camera or getting somebody online. We'll use you coach. But if I'm there, I'm the expert.
SPEAKER_01: no he should do the announcements on the stage uh and also he needs to do the press conference and you should do the the the translation of uh cody uh raymond and uh not cody uh the the oh i'll do cody no no no no no even better i'll translate for the americans you translate for the for the performance yeah by the way who is this dog
SPEAKER_04: Say again. He said that's an echo of Travis's voice.
SPEAKER_01: I thought there was a bunch of wild dogs and wolves at the man's house, man. I know how they live over there in Kazakhstan. Crazy shit. Yeah. I think what I understand from all this, you know, Travis has lost his spirit about, like, being a great champion, you know. He will be, like, only, like, what, YouTuber guy or what? This is what I see.
SPEAKER_00: yeah i was expecting something very hungry to success again but what to do well you got to get some hey you got to get some bigger guys on the show man guys i'll run through these guys on this show what do you mean i do i do have a question i want to know i didn't know you i didn't even know you was here cody i'm sorry i'm sorry sir i didn't know you was on the show
SPEAKER_02: yeah cody go ahead go ahead buddy i want to know why autumn thinks that if he beats marcio and i he like has he he needs to go to travis if he beats us obviously he can be travis because he's way down the list oh if he beats them guys he's still got a long way to travel before he gets to me okay travis what do you say about this before before raymond translates this
SPEAKER_00: what cody said is he's gonna kill that guy from kazakhstan he has no chance that's what cody just said no he said that he said that if the the morozov beats him he doesn't need to pull against you because you are weaker than cody that's what he said yeah well i could be happy if i was asleep and somebody woke me up on the word go bam wake up you're talking about cody
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I can beat Cody pretty easy. When? June, as you said, June? Yeah, well, it's happening June 18th, but I got to put some stipulations. If Cody goes over there and gets his ass handed to him, I'm canceling our match. And you're going to put Morozov instead? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Why? We're going to go down. We're going to go down a couple levels. What do you mean?
SPEAKER_01: it will just prove that i am so supremely better than everyone else there's really no reason for me to jump back in there yet okay what do you think i just saw confusion on eng in space he's that doesn't work out the man doesn't work i i only do you know what i see i only see someone who is very
SPEAKER_01: like incompetent that's what i see with travis he's just like talking whenever he i he said that if morozov beats i mean cody he's gonna cancel the match with the cody so it means that he needs to pull with a stronger one but instead he said oh he's not gonna pull morozov and then i don't understand this part yeah so he just he's just like making everything up to not the i'm going to the body not to pull not to put morozo i don't know what needs to be done you know
SPEAKER_01: Morozov can't beat me in nothing. He can or he cannot? He can't beat me in checkers, tic-tac-toe, or arm wrestling. None of them. What does he say? I don't understand. Marcio, what do you think about all this? Marcio is just thinking, you know, quietly. He doesn't even just get into it. What do you think, Marcio? Marcio is just happy you're not asking him any more questions. I am asking him. I am asking him right now.
SPEAKER_03: I'm just enjoying, I'm just enjoying all the bullcrap that Travis bring. This is the best. It's just for me to laugh. It's good to laugh. It's morning here. I love to laugh. I don't know. It's so many nonsense. I don't even know what's true. What's your opinion? Opinion. Do you see Travis is serious getting back or you think, you know, he is not really, I don't, I don't know. It looks like not right.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know. Right now you can't see that? Look, look. Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You got tattoos. I don't mess with gang members. You're a gang member, man. I'm sorry, man. I don't want no trouble. Marcio, is it true that only a few months later, Travis beat Alexi Vojvoda? You beat Travis at Arnold Classic. Is that true? Yeah. Oh, okay. Wow. And at that time, you thought Travis was the best?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, but you know what? I was trying to look good. So I lost a little bit of weight trying to tuck my shirt in. When I wrestle Marcio, I can't have my shirt tucked in. I gotta have love handles.
SPEAKER_01: okay yeah i i wish i wish uh morozov had someone to uh translate all this you know during the conversation with the guys just impossible yeah literally you want to you want to tell him anything translate him don't bring a guy on the show that cannot communicate with us how the hell are we supposed to talk trash between a translator but raymons is uh i mean come on we are we are going to invite i'm already convinced that ramos does not even speak that language
SPEAKER_01: anything that he knows ain't English, and I think he's talking Portuguese. You know, he said that he knows foreign language, and he said that he would kick your ass if you are brave enough. And you said, yeah. Coach?
SPEAKER_01: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
SPEAKER_00: whoa whoa whoa whoa yeah at the side you know in the bar or something he was just playing with your left as well but the good thing that you know there was super much well i mean look at the guy the guys are walking water investigation i mean my goodness i can't imagine if i was on that them super steroids like those guys are over there yeah
SPEAKER_00: someone someone next someone actually like steroids from the doctor just a little rub you guys blood transfusions and we can't that oh my god this is amazing 220 pounds now what's he taking yeah i will show you what i take
SPEAKER_01: this one i think yeah yeah it looks like his stomach looks like ronnie coleman right before he retired see what i mean yeah yeah enlarged enlarged stomach wall and oh yeah just travis i mean it started again this guy just like totally out of his control and just travis
SPEAKER_00: Can you be number one guy in North America, again, with left arm? Doesn't it bother you that people are ranked before you? How about that sarcastic-ass comment right there where you were about to say the world, and then you're like, uh, uh, uh. He can never be the world champion. Oh, no, no, no. Let me start there. He knows it. The North American champion is the champion of the world. Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, for sure, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: the question still remains right raymond just tell tell morozov please you know just say that this guy is thinking that you know when he is number one in north america it means that he is the best in the world what does he think yeah uh
SPEAKER_04: Hasn't he heard of Donald Trump? Just forget it. Just wait. Let him answer. I think even Artem Tainov is here.
SPEAKER_01: Let someone from North America beat Artem Tainov at least. What did he say, Raimond? He said, let someone from North America beat Artem Tainov at least in his weight class. Does he agree that the best of North America is the best in the world, as Travis says, or not?
SPEAKER_04: Do you think the best from North America is the best in the world? No. No, he said no. He doesn't agree. Can you ask him one more question? What does he think of top five in the world with right arm? What are your top five in the world with your right arm? How do you look at it? With my right arm? Levan.
SPEAKER_04: Vitaly. Dave Chaffee. Who else? Alex Kurdecha. Hermes.
SPEAKER_00: not like michael not devon not michael huh top five is travis devon michael dave and jerry and then you start getting bored what the fuck is that don't you guys have a youtube hey raymond raymond he doesn't think that devon and uh michael is not there in top five
SPEAKER_04: uh he said he said devon is number six michael is number seven and travis is maybe 10. hey i like this god ingan ain't happy about 10 in 10 years that's perfect
SPEAKER_01: I'll take that. I'll take that. I think Travis right now with right arm is 150. Yeah, about that. I'm one above you. I'm one above you, Engin. Remember that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just come Istanbul. Just come.
SPEAKER_01: i'm coming i'm coming i just gotta i gotta get on there i gotta wring it out a little bit i will not give you anything listen what is just shut the up you know marcio what's your top five yeah honestly i would say 50 minutes it took 50 minutes amazing okay levon first uh probably vitaly's second
SPEAKER_03: uh then it starts to get a little tricky it could be devon yeah maybe uh you are saying that uh i think you made six now
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, because I think they're close. Michael and Kudanch are now very close. So you think that both Kurdesha and Ermes have no chance to take Dave's wrist, right? This is what you're thinking. It's hard. Dave's shape is very, very strong. Yeah. I think he's underestimated. He cannot just side pressure. He's been training his hand and wrist a lot.
SPEAKER_03: So you think it's very strong. It might contain, you know, Alex, I believe. But you're ranking Michael... You're talking about street rules, right? You're ranking Michael below Dave? If it's street rules, I believe, yes, very close. It's very close after those first three. I don't know. Has Dave ever beat Michael?
SPEAKER_00: yes no yes i don't know but mike has the winning record for sure i i think they might usually take his wrist but they start that one-on-one and then you get six wins the same day that that should never equate for more than two wins because if we go back in history when we have these tournaments
SPEAKER_00: the winner of the tournament could have beat all those guys as many times as they wanted to arm us. So the whole, it's like, how many days have you met the person in competition? Not how many times you beat him one day.
SPEAKER_00: I understand. So you are saying that Michael beat him in like maybe two super matches, but they beat him in tournaments. Yeah, they beat him in countless tournaments. And also, too, I don't understand how a guy can get credit for finishing third or fourth place and not arm wrestling the champ. In my opinion, he lost that day to the champ, even if he never arm wrestled him.
SPEAKER_00: It's a weird situation where you could lose to somebody else and then not take credit for me being better than you that day. And Cody, what's your top five?
SPEAKER_01: If you can do left and right, if you are not so sure about left, you can do right, because there is not a lot of matches with the left arm at the elite level internationally. You see, like Levan is not pulling, Laletin is not pulling. You know, these guys didn't meet Morozov. Like, I mean, there is nothing really going on with the left arm. I think that this will be one of the few real high-level super matches in the world at the elite level, you versus Morozov.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, nobody really cares about left-hand anyway. I do. I do. I do. I do. That's one of the side effects, Cody, of me not being involved. So lucky you. Lucky you. I will bring it back to the spotlight. Thank you very much, Travis. I appreciate that. So my top, who I think top five are, right-handed, I think it's pretty much the same list. LeVon, Vitaly.
SPEAKER_02: um i think alex credeccia is amazing he looks really really good um i i think dave's probably above alex oh so third is dave and the fourth is alex um i don't know it would be uh alex devon
SPEAKER_02: somewhere in there alex and devin i don't know for sure the order with those ones uh so you are saying that that one can beat uh alex or alex can beat him but uh they would beat both devon and uh alex that's what you're thinking i think it really depends on like what marcia was saying on on rule sets yeah um if if devin's allowed to play all of his games he's pretty tough
SPEAKER_01: uh if someone if he has a referee that's not going to put up with that stuff then it might be a different story if they get the match started quick and i i have a question for you guys if dennis and devon if they didn't pull under pile but if they pull under the like say like king of the table rule uh would the outcome change possible or no that left-handed particular match
SPEAKER_01: no no okay dennis was way better than him left-handed that day but but just because he's so better it means that he wouldn't get tired if the five minutes set up no no okay i think that i think devon or excuse me dennis was just way too strong
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, the match has to be close for Devin for that strategy to work. I've arm wrestled Devin right-handed and had to fight and play the game. And then I've arm wrestled him the same day left-handed and allowed him to have that advantage because I had more than him. So to me, Dennis had a little more than him that day. So, yeah, I agree. I don't think it would have changed. I understand. I understand, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: So I'll tell you my top five without me in it. I mean, I know it's a little bit of fun. You're 150 anyways. My top five is Levon, Michael Todd, Alex, then the Vitaly, and then Devin. That's the five.
SPEAKER_01: And listen, you better put respect for Michael Cohen. No, no, no, no, just wait one second. Wait, didn't Delvin just beat Michael?
SPEAKER_01: did he did but how can you how can you ignore the the recent recent result and just like i mean there was a huge difference between them i mean how can you have an your opinion like way heavier than the actual result you know even if you would ask michael he wouldn't rank himself about devon like when i mean maybe he's better now but we can't really prove this he is better now
SPEAKER_00: I understand, but you don't think it needs to be proven, you know, to write about that. But I mean, none of this, if we do it only by proof with the way that we engage each other, which is almost never, then there has to be just opinions in there. And I'm telling you,
SPEAKER_01: we have actual results we have actual result there you know if they didn't pull and then if you had an opinion i understand if you have an opinion between lalette and michael todd i would understand because they didn't pull you are thinking that way i am thinking different way but when they actually pulled it is like very to me it doesn't make sense to rank uh michael about three days ago and he is not the same person yeah but people who would huge
SPEAKER_00: yeah but don't you think it needs to be proven you know or not no i mean it's arm wrestling i mean do we have to prove anything it's just youtube talk is all it really is
SPEAKER_00: I understand. I understand. Yeah. So Travis, you kind of fall into that, that same category, the talk thing. A hundred percent. Yeah. I mean, and here's the crazy part. I am. I put the level up there so high and I talked so much shit that I can still do it for four years later. It's crazy that that's even possible.
SPEAKER_01: So I was, I will tell you something like from 2015 to this day, maybe Moldova to, but Moldova event can not be counted really. Right. Right. But, uh, left arm, left arm, it was a last minute, you know, change, you know, and I know, uh, let me finish Travis. Listen, just, I'm just saying that like your wards,
SPEAKER_01: and trash talk as heavy as your uh the the the the distance from your last great uh job at the table so farther you go from that that time then it's getting a little bit lighter then people started thinking you know you're just talking but i think i'm not saying this to criticize you i'm just saying that i think you need to really start
SPEAKER_01: training get in shape and talk okay still talk but talk but at the same time walk and then trust me i'm saying as a friend you will you're like you you will be very popular on social media too because your talk will be backed with your walk you know so that is as a friendly i mean you will be like 10 times more popular once you start doing something at the table you did great things you are one of the
SPEAKER_00: ever for sure but i think that you know if you continue doing something your your walls will weigh much heavier than how they are right now well listen i hate to call you captain obvious but yeah that's yeah i i agree that goes for every body on that at our muscles if you do better at the table
SPEAKER_01: will be more popular yeah i will also tell you something that i was watching the program that we made last year you yannis in fact yannis and raimonds were just like observers you know only you and i talk and then but i left like crazy every time something happens the the raimon's reactions like
SPEAKER_01: like this this i was just just looking at you and yeah yeah yeah laughing but remember you were telling me i said that you know you said only the last years you know that one was good and i said come on like last 50 years and you told me like name me or something but but didn't didn't devon beat you in 2002 niagara falls with right arm
SPEAKER_01: Yeah. But I, I, I, I thought it wasn't crazy. And you went crazy over it. Listen, I thought it wasn't pin. This, this is my opinion after this day. But the other day I talked with Christian Bini. He said it was a pin, but I don't know. Like I, we need a video of this. I don't know if somebody has it or not. You said it was flash pin. And Christian Bini says that he catch you before, before it was a pin, you know? So what do you think?
SPEAKER_00: Well, I mean, listen, there's no reason to even talk about it. The fact is, is that Devin wasn't even the top four guy that day. The fact is, is that we had a tournament and then me and Greg Boyce and Earl Wilson battled and Devin snuck in from behind and got a good call, which was a really bad call. It really wasn't that close. And if we had live video, we would see not only me win, but you going nuts about me winning.
SPEAKER_00: don't know i i was thinking the same way i thought it was pin yeah this is what i was thinking that i beat greg boyce than you were about the devon match that day yeah but how did you lose the other one like who else did you lose i lost to earl wilson once me and tamara mitt started cussing at each other she was reffing and then she just started in a hook and i couldn't pin her but i wasn't even that good that day
SPEAKER_01: i mean i was just okay i understand yeah remember the guy didn't pass and okay uh can you ask artem where does he think he is right now like of course that you know like this is not proven anything but he said that his right arm is even better now and where does he see himself right now
SPEAKER_01: You know what I mean? Like where ranks like what like who does he think that he can beat and who does he think that he cannot beat right now? Where does he rank himself? It's not proven. But what? Because he knows himself better. We all have thoughts, right? I can beat this guy. I cannot beat this guy. Yeah. But but, you know, his his his his own judgment may end differently on February 12th, you know, right, Marcio? OK.
SPEAKER_04: Artyom, where do you think you are in the world right now? Who do you think you can beat in heavyweight? Where do you think you are? Are you closer to the top 10 or 20 best armwrestlers in the world? Are you the best armwrestler in Kazakhstan right now? Well, no. No? No, of course not. I haven't fought everyone, how can I say?
SPEAKER_04: That I'm the best. I need to win everyone first, and then... I need to put them all together like this, one by one, to the table, and like a carousel, let them pass through me. Then I can say that I'm the best, but not like that. I'm ready to fight everyone, absolutely everyone. And from there, I'll be able to push myself away. What place do I occupy in the world, for example.
SPEAKER_04: That's a good answer. So I asked him, do you consider yourself as the best armistice in Kazakhstan? And he said, no, because I haven't beaten the best of the best. I haven't beaten them all. So when I beat them all, I'll know I'm the best in Kazakhstan.
SPEAKER_01: and yeah it's the proven part it's for he beat it does that i know probably he didn't pull me through him but what i'm just saying that like did he say that where he thinks or is so no he said he said he's ready to arm wrestle everyone and anyone and he said where whoever he beats that's where he ranks he he wants to find out as well well so he he doesn't have any opinion you know about his level no
SPEAKER_01: he he thinks he's strong he thinks he can arm wrestle with everyone but he said of course everyone needs to climb the ladder okay i understand so he doesn't say that he sees himself like in top five or anything no but by the way there was any any super chats or i think you or
SPEAKER_04: yes there was some super chats uh can you can you read them please yeah i think i missed few of them but uh yeah i remember one was one was for artem uh to ask how did vitaly feel so i will ask him okay um backstage
SPEAKER_04: Yes. He was very strong. He controlled everything. He can easily win from the top.
SPEAKER_04: I hold him back a little bit, but he's still stronger. He was more difficult to hook. I don't know, he should be asked how he was. He said he was strong, but I think I'm not strong enough for him.
SPEAKER_04: So he was arm wrestling Vitaly in Siberia in the backstage. And the question was, how did he feel? He said Vitaly controlled the whole match. He said when going through the top, he's just impossible to stop. And in a hook, it's a little bit more difficult, but he had full control. So he ranks Vitaly number one, number two in the world.
SPEAKER_04: oh he thinks the latin is even better than lebanon right now he thinks no no no he he wants to find out but he said he still lost to lebanon still there okay okay can you see others uh yes um the one was um is uh travis docking europeans
SPEAKER_01: oh is it he they they give travis his own medicine huh the one that he was given to the devil okay are you there travis i am here i'm listening to this okay uh canadian watching travis discredits the whole sport by taking or even being involved
SPEAKER_00: about jesus christ you people want to listen to these four guys and not me i find that extremely hard to believe i find that insulting i mean listen what i find insulting is your uh is is your translating no i find insulting when someone thinks that you should be discredited from the sport
SPEAKER_04: Oh, good. Yeah, I agree. I agree. That's one thing about you. I didn't even hear that. So any other questions? No, no, there was some super chats, but they were just like, nice show and Happy New Year and blah, blah, blah. And we love something that you love, Travis. Yeah, they love Travis. Everyone loves Travis. Yeah. Travis, I have a question for you. Is it true that
SPEAKER_01: uh you have devon's picture on your wall yes yeah of course yeah right next to yours yeah shrine yeah
SPEAKER_01: next to yours it's right behind the toilet seat what what can i do to provocate you to start training and just proving yourself one more time or you are you are you are not motivated because you i'm already going to do that listen listen you you're because you are like like like your motivation is gone because of seeing people like leon and thinking that okay like i will never reach there or something
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I would never want to look like LaVon. You're right. I'm not talking about it. I'm talking about beating him. Oh, there is another question. Yeah. You see that?
SPEAKER_04: yeah but i don't know light is coming to my face can you read love seeing all the best in the world together like this i think marcio and travis would be in top 10 for sure if they had six months to get ready i don't see many people being able to thank them yeah yeah if travis trains yeah let's see let's see where marcio is marcio's hand marcio's hand might be a little bit better than we've ever known
SPEAKER_01: I will tell you something like, you know, Travis, you are a little bit younger in the sports than probably I and Marcio, a little bit, but like when you have, and also you had a lot of breaks, you know, but when you have like so long career and then you have like so many injuries, some of them are major, some of them are minor injuries. And, but when you are sometimes like taking time off,
SPEAKER_01: And when you come back, you realize that you are even better than before because of like totally, I think Marcio is now in that phase that like he, after he injured himself, you, you took some time off, right? Marcio? Yeah, I had injury in both arms. Yeah. And now, now I see you, I see you in very good shape. And I'm just thinking that maybe that time that you, you know, took and so like to heal, maybe bring you like all the minor injuries, maybe.
SPEAKER_03: healed up and now you look you look in great shape yeah my type of work doesn't help much but that's why sometimes i have to take more time it's just uh i'm still working i'm a foreman i'm supervisor but i still put my hands on a job so it's uh what are your numbers marcio what are your numbers with lifting are you near to do your best no that's the thing though i was lifting
SPEAKER_03: incredibly insane when it was 200 pounds believe it or not i was just working in a gym i was a personal trainer i was an instructor in the gym so i had a lot of time to train so yeah it was a little bit kind of like what you see it actually doing i was doing those kind of weights like back in the day long time ago like today i can't do those i have to train a little smarter and uh not that hard
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but sometimes, you know, like what your numbers in the gym doesn't really show where you are at the table, you know, for us, table training and the coordination of years, you know, probably now you are using your power like most possible effective way, you know, like when you are lifting the weights, yeah, you are good with the irons, bars, rubber bands and everything.
SPEAKER_01: but at the table you know that that is the most important everything we do outside of the table we do it to translate them to the table but if you are very good at the table like look at john like he because he is the hundred percent arm wrestling made guy you know at the table so but what do you think about your table performance maybe the weights i was 63 kilo i was doing with a tick tick tick bar 39 kilo almost 85 kilo full motion very straight
SPEAKER_01: uh like a bench like down not angle like this and then i was just doing without zero cheating 63 kilo now i last idea was 20 kilo 25 kilo which is like 44 55 you know around there so i am now 90 kilo but i i think maybe i am
SPEAKER_03: more effective at the table, but compared to that time, if I was as fresh, as healthy as that time with this weight, I would be much, much, much stronger than how I am now. So how is your table performance? It's been pretty good. I think as we age, there's times, I mean, there's all the things that are against us as we get older, but you learn your IQ table gets better. You know where to put like, you know,
SPEAKER_03: For example, I was looking for you, like you, one of the first guys that I saw doing like a lot of pronation training and I haven't done before. I had no idea what is pronation. So yeah, no, no one in the world and everything. Second.
SPEAKER_00: just being and said no one knew about pronation i just wanted him to know that when i was born i knew what pronation was i know i know i know it's good hey i think too i think that the older we get we understand the connection is so the most important part yes yes i agree when you say connection you mean like coordination of the muscle groups right yep
SPEAKER_00: well and just no i mean the connection that you have with your opponent the the actual connecting of the hands like if a lot of times when we're younger we use this perfect connection to build up the big muscles to move weight but the older we get we understand that if we just work on the the the the connection the connection we're going to give him and how strong our hand is
SPEAKER_00: it just makes us so much more comfortable at the beginning of the match so when i was younger i tried to lift heavy weights but i always did it with a perfect connection and then i understood that if i can give this guy a bad connection then his his rep won't be as as dominant as it would be if he had a really good connection
SPEAKER_00: So I think that Marcio's injuries, and this is just me talking, it's kind of slowed him down a little bit and he's not at the gym throwing around big weight. He's at home with that squeeze mechanism of some sort. And what I saw when he pulled Wayne was that his hand, he was so happy and comfortable with the connection. And Wayne, you know, he just shut him down. Yeah, that makes sense.
SPEAKER_03: I just put more attention and it's incredible. After all this year, you're still learning a lot of things about yourself, about how you move. I'm very versatile. And of course, the hand plays such a big thing in our sport. How you place it, how you shut down somebody, how you place your hand in your opponent, they're all
SPEAKER_00: All of this comes from table practice. And the stronger your hand is, the better connection you'll give the guy, meaning you don't mind. But your fear, the fear of your hand strength is what always, to me, is my biggest fear.
SPEAKER_00: like asset. If I'm worried, then I am going to cause a bunch of problems in the connection to just make sure that that guy's not comfortable. The times that I've gotten myself in trouble is when I had a false confidence of how strong my hand was.
SPEAKER_01: I have a question for Marcia and then I will ask a question to Cody. Marcia, when do you think that your best ever shape was? Was it like you look incredible versus Krasimir about your physical shape look like, I mean, you look like, I don't know, like Hercules or, you know, and was it like one of your best ever shapes or no? Maybe, I think I believe so. It's hard to, you know, to find what's the best shape. I mean,
SPEAKER_03: was what i can say that was one of the best shapes i trained for serious because i didn't train much in the first the previous uh series of the wal i wasn't i wasn't able to really train hard when i pull like hutchings uh michael todd and that and i feel so bad like i found the way that the following year to train really hard i was training for six months straight so i was really really stronger i think so
SPEAKER_03: sometimes like I didn't want to hook Crosby at the end but at one point he got a strap so I was playing at the top for him but he's so good at supinating before the goal and uh I was like you know what let's make it a hook and then yeah it was like muscle versus joint he used a lot of joint and then while your bicep and everything look so
SPEAKER_01: great and cody um i will ask you a question you know you have been pulling for how long 25 years maybe 25-ish yeah i mean am i wrong or your current shape may be your best ever like because because like in the past like you were still there but your name or maybe i'm mistaken wasn't really amongst the
SPEAKER_01: very very best but right now i mean you are ranked number one in north america is is it because of the absence of travis and like like other guys have you ever pulled eric wolf like in his time yeah i actually so
SPEAKER_02: I've been in the sport about 25 years, but I took like a nine and a half year break and got back into the sport in 2015, the end of it. Before I took that break, I had actually beaten Eric Woffel. Matter of fact, one of the reasons I decided to get back into the sport is I watched Travis and Eric in the WAL finals
SPEAKER_02: on ESPN and they were paying second place $10,000. And I had beaten Eric before I quit arm wrestling. And I really felt like I could have been in that situation. So I asked my wife if she'd mind if I started training and that's why I got back into the sport in 2015. Another question, compared to your retirement, first retirement, how would you like,
SPEAKER_01: think about your form now? Like, are you can you say that you are in your best ever shape? Like could you beat the
SPEAKER_02: cody or like before 2005. yeah i think i could for sure yeah and i i think it kind of goes along with what travis was saying with not only with age do we understand like different things that our body can do but i've learned a lot more about myself mentally as well like confidence level
SPEAKER_02: i think that confidence plays a big part in in in what you do and how you do it and i i believe in myself way more now than i did then i remember going to matches where eric will fell were there or marcio or whoever these big names
SPEAKER_02: and i always felt like oh crap i hope i can like play second now you know where i i don't feel that way anymore i feel like if i go to an event that i i should be able to do well and win that then so my confidence level is way different than it used to be yeah but even now it means that you have the confidence but you don't show us right now a lot of like as i try to get something from you at the beginning of the show you know
SPEAKER_01: like you were like yeah yeah yeah there's a difference between confidence and cocky no it's not like that as long as you are not disrespectful you can't say that yes i'm coming there insecure people call it cocky and then cool people call confidence okay yeah it's good yeah
SPEAKER_04: raymond like can you can you uh figure out a good question for uh uh morozov or any of you guys have any questions for morozov because we have some super chats we have so much okay yeah i asked super chats yeah okay so one is as armisen gets bigger and more huge guys compete should there be another heavyweight class like 130 kilos and then super heavyweight 130 kilo plus what do you guys think
SPEAKER_01: do you guys think no we need less classes not more less okay what is the what is the like do you think that they should be the cut before the super away 240
SPEAKER_00: I think there's just one way class in the heaviest guy should be at the top. The lightest guy should be at the bottom. And we ought to pay the sweet 16 really good. We ought to glorify the tournament tournament. Now we are not talking about you do tournaments and they're one on and it's a single elimination, you can make each round best two out of three. So it's almost
SPEAKER_01: the same format we got i will do that it's on my mind yesterday when i watched the program we made last year i watched that and then it is on my mind if this event goes successful i will try to make a huge event with with the way that you are talking about but i need to check with the other top athletes you know what what they think yeah yeah uh eight guys right if you get the two right guys from each low category medium category middle i know i know i know we talked about it yeah another guy
SPEAKER_01: yeah what was the other question uh before we ask a question to uh artem because yeah as he said artem looks bored out of his mind great job and you know putting this card together thank you very much devon
SPEAKER_01: The ducking armrest. But now Travis is the same way. So he can't pull the Kazakhs. And who else can you not pull? Russians, Travis? I can pull people from Utah. Living in Utah, I will bust that ass. Oh, OK. Cody, yeah. Cody. I'm going to whip Cody's ass, yo. I'm telling you all that right now. Woo!
SPEAKER_01: okay so what we understand is the headline is that travis can beat americans he believes he can beat but not the kazakhs okay this is the headline tomorrow yeah and you have any question guys for for cody because this guy doesn't speak english and he is really right yeah yeah cody speaks a little english yeah i hope just a little yeah i hope i can't spell it but i can talk it yeah
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, only one time I talked with him in English, we little bit pull with him. And I said, Do you think my tornado is strong? He said, No, he said, very strong. When he was in Istanbul, this only conversation I have with him directly face to face. Any question for him? For Artem? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, your opponent. Yeah. How old is he, Engin?
SPEAKER_04: How long is he? You need to ask Raimonds. How long has he been in the sport? 23 years. He's 24 and he's been armwrestling for 8 years. He's half of my age.
SPEAKER_00: me too hey he could be your son it's gonna be embarrassing you probably you probably messed with this lady in kazakhstan you might be that boy's daddy listen listen listen little travis you are out of your mind that you're talking just don't translate such thing marcio said
SPEAKER_01: Raimonds, just ignore him. Marcio said, Raimonds, Marcio said, he said he's 48 and Morozov is 24. It will be very embarrassing for him to lose to someone who is twice age of him. Right, Marcio? This is what you meant, right? Yeah, that is the mentality. Yeah, just let's get it going, you know. You win or lose, you know, just put some to the table, you know. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: I should translate, yeah? Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: I watched it on Zloty Tur. Do you remember WL 2019? Yes, I saw it. I also watched the live broadcast. He's strong. You can't say anything about him. But I need to be stronger that day. So that he doesn't think...
SPEAKER_04: He said he knows Marcio, he's been watching Marcio for a long time. He said he watched the live translation, the live pay-per-view of you pulling Krasimir.
SPEAKER_04: He said he just needs to be stronger on that day. So just to show that age is nothing in arm wrestling, you know, that everyone can beat anyone, you know.
SPEAKER_01: okay it pretty much goes the other way around as well i think okay by this answer we thought that you know he would be the conor mcgregor but you know you see marcio more of morrow conor mcgregor than him when he said it will be very embarrassing for him to lose to someone who is old enough to be his father you know but now he says that uh he's gonna come and he said that anything is possible right i think i think you just need to you just need to set up a match for travis
SPEAKER_01: and yeah we don't need mcgregor we have travis no don't you see travis travis is afraid of kazakhs i'm afraid i'm afraid of indian do you know why you are afraid of me because of what you did to me in 2005 vegas and yeah you go bring it up to pass man no no yeah yeah yeah i consider you as a very close friend you know yeah very close friend but yeah
SPEAKER_02: so i think there is no more uh super chat and i think there is not much that you what we like last last words cody what would you like to say i have one question for artem it's a little bit different than marcio's i want to know how he'll feel beating up on senior citizens oh come on i really want to know he should feel bad he should only come like 50 just you don't just beat up on grandpas and your your parents all the time that's not nice
SPEAKER_04: Come on. I'll try my best to translate that. You are almost going to ask him for pity. Come on, Cody. Artem, Cody asked, how will you feel if you offend the veterans? Because he is a veteran. He, Marcio and Cody too. He said, you don't have to be 100%, you can come to 60%.
SPEAKER_04: Why do I hate veterans? Did they fight? They are just athletes, just like me. And I'm honestly surprised that they are so old.
SPEAKER_04: Okay, well, Engin's gonna be very happy about this one. He said,
SPEAKER_04: that it like uh it doesn't matter what is the age he said like he doesn't seem the problem with that and he is very um surprised that you guys at your age know how to use phone and zoom so that's good that's a good one but we know way more than that
SPEAKER_03: Like what, Marcio? Like what could you teach to Artem about, you know? I don't know. I don't know if he's rich, but like how to live life better, how to, you know, make more money, have a good time. Besides all that. Nothing about armors. No, I just want to know that we have the experience. You can buy that. How to raise children.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, come on. Come on. Cody is terrible. Cody is just like, you know, he's just coming there like an old man, you know, raising children and he's senior citizen and please come 60%. Please come 60%. My daughter is almost his same age. That's how old I am. Yeah, you are a year older than me.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I am also like pulling guys like we already are to mean Douglas, maybe budget are soon, you know, just come on, you know, look at john john is gonna pull young guys, you know, he's what? 57. Do you think you think john can win? Okay, but about the super matches before we finish, what does everyone think john versus quickly we go john versus all a start from you, right months?
SPEAKER_03: Like percentage, percentage, John versus Zaluev. Versus Zaluev? Yeah. I'll give 70% to Zaluev. Ooh, Marcio. I'm starting to think. My only concern about, I think John's strength is really good. The only thing that's still concerning is his hand. I'm not used to seeing John's pulling like this. He's been pulling like this the last few matches since he came back.
SPEAKER_03: And he's a little slower, right? But if you put Zolaev to this position, both like pronated but no wrist, I think John's side pressure will be stronger. That's what I believe. I think it's 50-50 until we see the match. I mean, John still have time to improve. You know, Zolaev, we know how capable he is. He's not just a hooker guy. He's versatile. He can top rope, as he showed with Hutchings. I think it's very interesting.
SPEAKER_02: I would say there is a favorite slightly to ZOEF, but I won't count John out. I mean, I think it's 50-50. And Cody? So, John, one thing about John, I think one of John's biggest weaknesses is the strap. He never relied on the strap like we do as much today. He's always been a hand-dominant control type of arm wrestler.
SPEAKER_02: and a lot of a lot of arm wrestling today is done in the strap and i don't think he is as proficient in the strap as say like travis or devin i think that that's one of his weak not that it's weak but comparatively speaking i think that's one of his weakest spots and i think that's why he gets his hand in that backward position is because he doesn't use the strap
SPEAKER_01: maybe like he should um but i think i think that he has been doing but maybe lately it's because of that i mean john i mean you can ask marcia that you know he could pull in strap and without strap you know he beat dennis in that way he beats uh travis in that way without just even much risk control yeah well i i agree with that but he he would even beat them better out of the strap
SPEAKER_01: like if they didn't he would be he would be more dominant if they stayed out of the strap but did you did you see his match with zolev that you know they pull and they all were in a strap and inside and outside i think maybe one match inside wasn't strapped but the outside matches we are easily top roll and beat uh zola so what do you give like what's the percentage of chance you're given oh goodness one is american but the other one you think is stronger
SPEAKER_02: yeah i i it's hard like i trained with john almost my whole career and i'm kind of biased towards him so i always want to see him win and it's hard for me to bet against him so 50 50 and then you just free free your soul yeah i i really want john to win just because of who he is um but i i don't know for sure to be honest i really don't and travis
SPEAKER_00: 95, 5% John Brzenk all day. He's been trying to do some great things. He's going to run over this guy. Zoloft's not even that strong. He's a really good armistice. Todd Hutton was way stronger than Zoloft. And if it wasn't for that bullshit reffing, Todd would have killed him. There was no bullshit reffing. He just won.
SPEAKER_04: The only problem is that Todd didn't know how to sleep, you know, that's the only thing. And can you ask Morozov what does he think about this match? Artem, how many percent do you give who will win? Well, chances of winning. Haji or John? Well, it will be the main supermatch. 60 to 40. For whom?
SPEAKER_01: Zaluev will win. He said 60-40 Zaluev. And what does he think about short answers, Gennady versus Michael Klopp? Gennady, Michael. I support Gennady, but it feels like it's 50-50. Oh, it's 50-50, he thinks. Tatachins and Sonev?
SPEAKER_04: Hutchings and Tsonov. Hutchings is very strong, but 50-50. But I still lean more towards Tsonov, because Tsonov will win. So 50-50 and he leans more to Tsonov. And the last one I will ask you, Ermes versus Arif.
SPEAKER_04: Hermes with Arif? Here... Arif won against Mir. 50-50. I want Arif to win. Because if Arif wins...
SPEAKER_02: He said because if Arif wins, that doesn't mean he's far away from the top guys there. Cody, what do you think about Gennady versus Michael in percentage? After having watched what Eremes did to Gennady, I think Michael will win that. I don't think he can get past Michael's
SPEAKER_01: King's move, that sticking point. And Todd versus Sonev, do you know Sonev? I do not. You don't know him. And Arif versus Ermes?
SPEAKER_02: I am a big fan of Arif, and I think that he is an incredibly strong person. I think that Ermi's hand might be a little bit stronger, but I hope that Arif wins. I see. And Marcio, what are your opinions about these matches? Like Gennady versus Michael? Gennady and Michael. Gennady, I mean, he was like maybe, what, three and a half years without bowling?
SPEAKER_03: I mean, competition, yes, but the training, he was good training, I think, yeah. Yeah, the match against Hermes, I couldn't recognize him. He was not versatile the way he used to be. He was not fired up. I mean, I don't know what happened, but it seems to be just doing one thing over and over. If he pulls a deck like that against Michael, he will lose 6-0, 5-0, whatever it is. Yeah. Yeah, I think Michael's favorite.
SPEAKER_03: Definitely. I mean, 60 to 40 against Gennady. We'll see how it happens. Todd versus Sonev. I think it's a very interesting match. Did you watch Sonev's last match versus Bogoslov from Russia? Did you watch that match? I didn't watch the whole thing, but I watched how he's composed. Even getting the other guy with the shoulder and everything, he's very composed.
SPEAKER_01: You know, he holds, he's very durable. He got a lot of endurance. It's a very interesting match. I think wrist to wrist, maybe Todd slightly stronger, I think. That's going to be how it is, like wrist to wrist. I never seen him put in any other, like never seen him top row. Even if he has top row ability, he will not be good enough to do that versus Todd. So he will be going deep inside, yeah. And Ermes versus Arif.
SPEAKER_03: So I think Todd's going to be slightly favored in that one. So like what, 53-47 or something? I'd say 55-45, just because, you know, I think he's just stronger. But I think the other Sonab has got a lot of endurance also. If the match got stuck too long... I think he was stuck. I think he was stuck. Arif is very good. You know, he won the Woff again.
SPEAKER_01: Jeremias, he had a dominant performance in his last match. I would give Jeremias 55 to 45. Did you know that, you know, Arif and Krasimir, Arif and Gennady has pulled fresh matches in the past? I believe Arif has wins on everybody, right? I think, I think, not I think, but he won against Krasimir and Gennady very quick matches, very, very quick flash pins here, he won. Right.
SPEAKER_03: yeah my only concern is like for example aramis had a strong got a stronger hand like it's not like you have these guys that you mentioned so it might be a little tricky that's why i think it's very close either 50 50 or a little slightly more to towards hermes but you gotta see it yeah we will see it and and what's that what else you want you want me to
SPEAKER_01: I think there are a lot of matches, but if we go all 16, you know, I don't think that we will be able to finish before, like, another hour. But Travis, do you know any of these athletes? Do you even follow the Eastern Pullers? Like, Tassone, do you follow? I mean, I know enough to pick against them. What's that? I know enough of them, so I know how to pick against them. I'm going Todd Hutchings, Hermes.
SPEAKER_01: john bersink and i'm telling you right now michael todd's going to be the strongest guy in the in turkey why he's there yeah i understand so so you are saying michael is gonna beat and then then yeah okay so i hope i hope that everything will be fine is there any other super chats can you see ramones yeah okay that's yeah so i i thank you guys very much is there anything you want to add before we finish the program
SPEAKER_01: like thank you very much but if you want to add anything go ahead you know nothing yeah thanks for having me gentlemen i'll see you in turkey
SPEAKER_01: Oh, I hope so. I hope so. But you are okay. Don't try to get out of me by squeezing or something as you describe, you know. Can you ask Raimon Morozov any other thing he would like to add before we finish? And tell him that sorry, you know, but there are like, we are like six people here. And then since he doesn't have translator there, so we made him wait time to time, you know, long, you know, tell him that we are sorry about it, but there was no other option.
SPEAKER_04: Artem, we will finish now. Engin said, sorry for talking so much. We hope that you understood something, that it was not just like that. Maybe there is something that you want to say to everyone?
SPEAKER_04: First of all, I want to say good luck to you, my opponents, Marcio and Cody. Engie, thank you very much for this opportunity. To you, brother Raymond, from the bottom of my heart, for the translation. I've already started to understand a lot when you listen, you start to get used to it and understand. It seems that you need to talk more often. You need to, you need to.
SPEAKER_04: Yes, by the way, thank you very much to everyone for the broadcast, let's have all the best good preparation and this guys there eat more vitamins all the same age
SPEAKER_04: he said uh he wants to to his opponents uh to have a good preparation eat more uh eat a lot of vitamins you know because of your age and uh he said thanks hanging for the opportunity and he thanked me for the translation and he went off yeah but he didn't think for travel travel side good good good good i was afraid that you would say anything about traps
SPEAKER_01: yeah yeah okay guys you all take care and hope to see you in istanbul in six weeks yeah yeah and cody stop playing like the the grandpa thing you know just come on you know come on you gotta have your excuses already in place before the match yeah he'll write them on his arm he she's like this one yeah yeah
