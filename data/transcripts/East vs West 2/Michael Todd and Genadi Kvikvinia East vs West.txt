SPEAKER_04: hello michael hey buddy hang on i'm trying to get myself this way there you go yeah um uh kennedy just
SPEAKER_04: wrote that you know his his translator is uh late and i don't know i sent him the uh link and so let's start together until he joins us i don't have a whole lot of time so i can but we will make it work yeah yeah so how are you i'm good rebecca wants to wave and hello hello rebecca yeah i love what you're doing
SPEAKER_04: uh trying to be totally healed up i'm okay i'm clean now negative but still a little bit cold you know but i think i will be okay in a few days yeah yeah we're excited to be a part of the card we're looking forward to it yeah this is your first time in istanbul right yes it is wanted to come for a long time yeah yeah i mean minimum probably 10 years maybe 15 years i'm sure it's been a while it's been a while all right sweetheart
SPEAKER_04: Yeah. You kept asking me, you know, if there is anything in Istanbul, if there is anything in Istanbul. And then finally it happened. Yeah. Right. Right. Yeah. And you, Ron and John and the wives all together arriving from Netherlands to Istanbul, as far as I know.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, and then all of us are leaving Sunday to go to Athens for Valentine's Day. Oh, the next day, yeah? Yeah, we'll leave on Sunday the 13th. We'll hang out 13th, 14th, and then Ron's birthday is the 15th. So we're going to celebrate that over there and have a good time in Athens. Yeah, yeah. What time do you leave on Sunday? Early. Early, okay. I'll send you the flight information. I don't remember, but it's early. Yeah, yeah, you send me, but it's not on my mind yet. I mean, right now.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, so you're ready. You start resting. Yeah, so my last little light workout was Friday, so I haven't done anything since. I mean, like I said, I haven't done anything in my preparation or training to think that I'm the strongest I've ever been because I've been following what Devin suggested and I just basically let my body heal up and did a bunch of lightweight blood flow work, high volume. But I honestly feel that
SPEAKER_00: this might very well be the best I've ever been. I mean, we'll find out really soon. We'll find out really soon. But I feel healthy, you know, and every time I've been on the table, I've had a very dominant type performance. So I'm hoping that that's the case. You know, I know Gennady is in the same boat as me. We both want to win. We both feel like we have a point to prove. But yeah, he's going to get my best for sure.
SPEAKER_04: I understand, yeah. I mean, that's the most important to be, in my opinion, to, I believe that our most important training is the table time. And I think that it is wrong to go to table time tired for the sake of, you know, high intense weightlifting. I mean, you can still do.
SPEAKER_04: you need to rest before you go there so because table time is the the where you are going to really uh coordinate all the muscle groups as you are going to use when you compete you know so that is i'm i'm not a fan of you know going table tired you know so is that basically what you were saying or uh pretty much i mean i've just been i've just been letting my best i'm getting on the table to see where i'm at um but everything has basically been healing
SPEAKER_00: recovery, getting blood to the area multiple times a day. And if everything feels good, like I really feel that I'm, I'm, I really feel like I'm a threat to anybody right now. I feel that way. We'll find out, but I mean, I'm, uh, I think, I think this is it. I think this is the, I mean, this is the best I could do for this match. This is the best I could, you know, version I could bring in. So, yeah, this is, yeah, that's what I was expecting.
SPEAKER_04: I think that this match is for you very important. Do you regret accepting this match? I think that you shouldn't because you may think that why did I need this match before we all know your plans, but from one side, I would think that if you really
SPEAKER_00: have the potential to become the very best in the world, we all need to agree that you need to pass Gennady. No, I mean, I accepted this match prior to Gennady accepting the match with Hermes. Hey, stuff happens. Gennady may have just had a bad night. Maybe Hermes had a great night. You never know.
SPEAKER_00: But I don't put that into any thought. Right now, I'm expecting the best, strongest version of Gennady to show up. I need a match. I want to arm wrestle. I don't like this waiting four to six months or longer to arm wrestle. I don't like it. I get in a training mindset, and I train really hard, and then I get bored. Without getting a chance to unleash...
SPEAKER_00: you know like i want to it's like a fight like you're you're in the thing punching a punching bag over and over and over and you want to punch somebody in the face you know like i'm tired of having a punch i want to i want to arm wrestle you know i don't know the training's great and i love the training but i am ready to arm wrestle yeah yeah yeah i understand um let me send the link uh
SPEAKER_04: one more time i think i will need a moderator as well because i can see if it is in a super chat or anything um if you don't mind um the reason that i asked this you know if you regret it is not because of that but does it put you uh does it put on you any pressure that you know like what if what if then it's going to mess your bigger plans so you know what i mean yeah
SPEAKER_00: No, I mean, I, I want all the pressure I put on myself. Right. Um, I've already told people what my plans are. I've told people what I want to do. I'm either going to win this match and I'm gonna move forward or I don't. And I'll re reconsider my options, you know? Um, you know, it's good that you will see where you are at. Yeah. I have to, I have to know. I think I know, I think I know, but I want to find out. Yeah. Yeah. You, you want to, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: prove prove where you are at yeah right yeah so I understand I understand and um do you uh how do you expect the match to go uh in a technical way let me just one second what do you expect in a technical way
SPEAKER_00: Well, I mean, in my perfect world, everything that I've been working on works and I just smashing three to zero. That would be my perfect scenario. So you're on your mind. You don't expect a war. No, I expect a war. I'm hoping there is not one. I expect there's a war, but I'm hoping that I'm I'm hoping I'm where I think I am. And if I am where I think I am,
SPEAKER_00: Listen, as soon as you or whoever the ref is that says go. Yeah, I will go as far as I've ever went on go in my life. Yeah, yeah. Okay, so you will you will go for it for a quick finish, but then then
SPEAKER_00: if it doesn't happen then you are ready for the normally i have to stop the match to win the match right so if i'm trying to finish the match early and it doesn't go i still got what i wanted and i stopped the match right so it's i'm just i've worked on a lot of stuff that tour that i did really strengthened
SPEAKER_00: really strengthen my arm like i really think it strengthens some of the stuff that i used to do that i was really powerful with just crazy just side pressure and now that i have my hand and my wrist back i don't i think it's all going to come together and i'm going to be really dangerous yeah you know michael like if we talk about old michael and then like uh when i say old michael i'm talking about where you were
SPEAKER_04: like as we remember you lately but i think that the only difference was your hand and wrist and in the last last trainings i saw that your hand and wrist handling what is behind them you know which is your arm strength and so if your hand and you know the wrist this this part came back
SPEAKER_04: just makes everything behind it even more effective you know so that is why it was that's the plan yeah that's the plan yeah i think that you to like have chance versus devon or not to have chance versus devon is just like the the the the your risk to handle that pressure if your wrist is not really handling enough and it's just kind of um
SPEAKER_04: hard you know remember i told you i i wrote that you know i see devon winning and then you asked me privately what makes you think that and i was thinking that your wrist was not gonna handle it went that way i don't know you there may be some other reasons behind that you don't want to uh share but um but that in that day it seemed to be your hand and wrist you know yeah he dominated what he needed to dominate and he had a perfect performance and
SPEAKER_04: You know, hats off to him. It's not going to happen again, though. I mean, that is, you know, Michael, there are like some guys, good guys with good intention that, you know, they are thinking that there is inconsistency, you know, between what you are saying that, you know, like you are saying something after the match. Now you are saying different. I have been trying to explain to them that, you know,
SPEAKER_04: we have ups and downs not only physically also mentally and spiritually you know you may feel and think that way at that time but when you once you recover yourself spiritually mentally physically then you may feel yourself in somewhere uh different you know so that is why when you say now that it's not going to happen again you know that that is how
SPEAKER_04: you this is the point that you should come and reach to continue go on and then for your dreams you know because you have beaten him before as well you know so right yeah the things can change you know yeah
SPEAKER_00: No, absolutely. In regards to inconsistencies, what it was is I knew how strong I was in preparation, and then when I got beat, I was like, oh, my God, that's amazing. But when I got home eight days later and Corey, who I'd been training with and just destroying 10 days before the match, that I couldn't even move him out of the center table, I realized, although Devin was in amazing shape and had an amazing performance,
SPEAKER_00: There was something different about me. And I didn't know that until I got home and pulled the guy that I normally pull. And I'm like, oh, shit, something's wrong. Did I peak too early? I don't know what happened. Doesn't matter. Devin won. He was a better man that day. I'm just telling you, I have learned my lesson and that's not going to happen again. Yeah. Yeah. So that is that is what it is. You know, you win or you lose. Doesn't matter. You learn something there. But when you lose, usually you learn more than when you are winning because there are there are more to learn, you know.
SPEAKER_00: um what was your weight versus devon that day and what's your weight right now i weighed in that day at 272. um so my morning weight was lighter you know strip weight whatever last night i went to bed 302. so you are about 30 30 pounds heavier yeah
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I mean, and I'm not as fit as I would like to be. I would like to be more aesthetic, but I'm going to focus on, I've already decided I'm not getting bigger. I'm not going to get bigger from here. I'm going to be more fit, but I do plan on getting stronger, right? And when I say stronger, it's stronger right here. I don't need, people for some reason don't think my arm's strong.
SPEAKER_00: Well, they're going to find out my arm strong, right? I just got to make sure my hand and wrist are strong enough to do everything that I need to do. But I don't like carrying this much weight. I thought I would be able to do it and and feel comfortable. And I just don't like being this big. So I'll be this big for this event.
SPEAKER_00: We'll enjoy our time in Istanbul. We'll enjoy our time in Athens. I have an event to do when I get back to the States and I fly back to Malta. But March 1st, everything's going to get tightened up a lot with my nutrition, my training. I'm going to do a lot more different style of training that I think is going to be more conducive to overall health and wellness. But it will be very much arm wrestling specific related on a daily basis for my hands, wrists, and forearms. And if you win in Istanbul, your next will be
SPEAKER_04: um is that like for sure the the winner of uh devon and levan or do you think that if they want to just a little bit rest you would like to pull someone like either hermes or alex or lalatin or anyone i'll tell you
SPEAKER_00: this this is it so people are saying why do i think i deserve a shot well i deserve a shot because i've been on top of this thing for a very long time i've been amongst the top guys for a decade um and it doesn't matter about who does that what promotion i don't need a promotion i have a very big sponsor in place after that match happens that i could do a massive social media push for the most money ever paid out in the super match and it would be up to them to take it
SPEAKER_00: That being said, I would not mind pulling Alex Gredeccia. If I'm successful in five days, there's a very good chance that there's a promotion that will set me and Alex up, maybe around the same time that Devin and LaVon pull. I'm not pushing. I mean, I want to pull for the overall number one spot before the year is over, whether it's September, October, November, whatever, right? So I just have to be successful in five days.
SPEAKER_00: If I choose to pull Alex, which is a big ask. He's a very big man, very strong man. He's had amazing performances. I like my chances because I'm not one dimensional. I'm very hard to finish. Even if you do take my hand, it's, you know, the reason he looks so good against Hermes is Hermes is so hand and wrist dominant. Well, once he gets his hand and wrist taken, he does not have a lot of defense.
SPEAKER_00: I'm used to being in bad positions, right? You're going to have to convincingly beat me, be a level stronger, or I'm going to come out on top. So I like that match. But since we're doing these pay-per-view events here at the Monster Factory, I've actually talked to Todd Hutchins about at some point, as long as these pay-per-views are successful, I may just start at the top 10 in the United States and arm wrestle every single person until I prove that I'm the number one guy.
SPEAKER_04: You know, I don't know. I got options. You know what I mean? Are you talking about pulling from number 10 to number one, one after another? Maybe. Oh, yeah. So you are looking for things that, you know, like not, how to say,
SPEAKER_00: people are not used to you want to do something you know absolutely everybody's out there you know people are waiting six months for a match and doing this crap and doing that crap listen if the pay-per-views that i'm doing here at the monster factor are supported i'll arm wrestle every month i'll pull a different dude every month until i prove that i'm the best in north america
SPEAKER_04: And then, or I'll bring guys over from Europe. I mean, I don't, what I'm saying is I don't like waiting. The waiting is killing me. Michael, do you, inside of you, do you feel like, you know, you need to beat everyone from 10 to 1 to prove that you are the best in North America? No, but it sure would be fun to do it.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, yeah, that is, you know, I was just like, I bet you don't you don't feel that way. No, of course not. I know where Corey's at and I know where I am with Corey right now. And I feel like I'm that way with anyone else in the United States. Dave Chafee is a hard match. Jerry Ketterer is a hard match. Devin Laird is a bad dude. There's other great arm wrestlers in there as well.
SPEAKER_00: yeah but if i am where i think i'm at which we're gonna find out in five days i like my chances against anyone right now currently i think i got enough force power to stop anybody and i know i got enough heart to beat anybody so yeah um i will ask you uh excluding yourself how do you see the like top five seven uh in the world excluding yourself
SPEAKER_00: LaVon Vitale. Um, and, and I say Vitale because he's recognized as, you know, most people think he's the number, we don't know a 300 pound Devon, a 292 pound Devon, the Devon that shows up. I'm going to tell you in my opinion, if Devon is strong enough to make that match stop before he loses three times, he's winning that match.
SPEAKER_00: Talking about Vitaly or Levon? Levon. If he's strong enough to stop the match before he's lost four times or whatever it is, Devin Laird is going to win that match. It's just whether or not he's strong enough to stop it. Do you think he will stop? Man, I really think so. And I'm telling you, I'm not a guy that's like, oh, this rule system, that rule system. But Devin knows how to...
SPEAKER_04: Roozbeh Gharakhloo, Manipulate not manipulate but push things right there, as far as they can go and under that real system, he will have an opportunity to bleed lebanon's hand. Roozbeh Gharakhloo, In the setup in the pump immediately go to strip he's got a lot of stuff I was thinking as well, this is what I was thinking as well, but. Roozbeh Gharakhloo, People things that you know they will he will not get tired and I asked the one that wants it, who says that his endurance is no good, but, but I think that people doesn't understand the ender and so.
SPEAKER_04: Devon. I think they people don't people do not understand the interest of that. They don't understand it. If they would just like a little bit play with him, they will realize that in a minute that their hands will be numb and then they will not even realize this. It is not about the strength. I mean, you may have probably 30% more power than
SPEAKER_00: Devon, when you are like starting together, but one minute later, the things are not like that anymore. Your hand gets numb. They're drastically underestimating Devon. And a motivated, focused Devon is a very dangerous person. So if you talk about the top five, seven, whatever, and I don't put myself in there. I'm going to put LeVon, but then I honestly think
SPEAKER_00: think the devon that shows up in june is it's 50 50 in my opinion and then and vertali but i honestly think batali i mean i think alex may be a bad match for the towel because he's just as long of a lever right he's just as big of a hand and i'm not 100 sure but tally
SPEAKER_04: smashes him and i don't think if fatali does not smash alex i think alex out arm wrestles him i know that's not a popular opinion but that's what i think so it honestly can i tell you something like when you say like when he doesn't flash he may not flash but it depends on which position the match will stop because i have seen vitale in 2015 rough versus uh alexander getalo
SPEAKER_04: 110 kilo world champion from kazakhstan current world champion they pull like 10 minutes 10 minutes and we tell you one you know but because yeah how big how big of a dude was the other guy though what was how long was his arm no no i'm not talking about it but it depends on the hand position even though i agree you are told if your wrist is like this it's hard for you to win against but it depends if you are going like you're right like this
SPEAKER_00: I think Vitaly is very, very good, very, very good against guys who don't match him in genetics. I think Alex may be the bad matchup for Vitaly just because he's equally as big. So I would say, like I said, I would say LaVon, Devin, Alex, Vitaly, which is crazy. And I don't know, I'm just guessing. I don't know. Number five?
SPEAKER_00: Oh, yeah. I'd say Dave Chafee. And then, honestly, I would probably put Hermes in at sixth. Yeah. And do you think Hermes has any chance against Dave or not?
SPEAKER_00: yes um but only if he beats his hand if he doesn't beat his hand he's done yeah yeah but can he be that that's the question that's the thing we don't know right dave has a big powerful hand um if dave sets up his hand and protects his wrist and protects his riser i think armies is in trouble if he ever gets his wrist compromised i think he'll keep getting his wrist compromised
SPEAKER_00: We have to see it to find out. But I definitely think Dave's the stronger person. Ermes has one really good lane that if he gets, he could beat Dave. But it's just whether or not Dave's hand and wrist holds up and whether or not Dave protects his wrist and his riser, in my opinion.
SPEAKER_00: But yeah, I give Gannata, Ermes is an amazing, actually, I can't say, we don't know. Arif might beat Ermes this weekend. You know what I mean? We don't know. This would be a better question to ask after this weekend. But- Yeah, but if Arif is better than Ermes, do you think that it makes Ermes bad or it makes Arif good?
SPEAKER_00: No, it makes RF good. He would have to come in before Hermes. You know what I'm saying? Yeah, yeah. The sixth place guy would be RF. The seventh place guy would be Hermes. Yeah. I'm sitting in fourth place right now, according to the rankings. And I was in second. Devin beat me. I got jumped by him and Vitaly, which is odd. But that's how it worked. And then now I think they have Devin third and me fourth. Vitaly second, LeVon first. I don't know exactly.
SPEAKER_00: i this is all only speculation you know yeah i like my chances with anybody i honestly do but we're going to find out i i think i think my hand and wrist are going to be very strong this weekend um so but yeah i would put i think gnadi's in the top 10.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. They have him ranked like 14th or some shit, and that makes no sense to me. But I would think Gennady would probably fall right underneath Hermes, you know? Yeah, yeah. If you're talking about the people who are going to beat him, I don't think there's going to be a lot of people who are going to beat Gennady.
SPEAKER_00: Especially if the match stops and he's a warrior. Why do I want to get him out of the way early? Because I don't want to give that man any confidence. I don't want him to believe. He's a lot like me. As soon as he believes he deserves to be on that table, that's a dangerous, dangerous person.
SPEAKER_00: But he's like, he's second guessing himself until that first go. But once that match stops, he shakes his head, speaks some Georgian stuff. It's crazy, you know? And I don't want to find that version of Gennady. I want to get him out of there. I want to get rid of him early. Yeah, yeah. But if we do, if it does become a war and he's not a lot more dominant, like if he doesn't just destroy my hand, you know, if we're anywhere in the center of the table and we're both, you're going to be in for something special. Because you got two guys. You have the wrist.
SPEAKER_04: like this. And if he's like this, it will be very hard for him to beat you. But if he can get far side of your hand somehow, and they can keep, like, if you are equally the same position, then I'm expecting a war there. And then the one that goes higher and higher, higher, they will finish the other one. But he should never like whenever he puts his shoulder pressure, you know, when you are in a like losing position,
SPEAKER_04: I cannot say that he can finish you as long as he is not very far, far away to your fingers or the hand. But if you take him to this here, your winning side, and then bring your shoulder, and if you catch him on his brachioradialis, I believe you're going to finish him. So he better keep you in his winning side. The worst case... It would be advantageous for him to get me...
SPEAKER_04: out of center on his side of the table if he does not i don't see a path for him to win yeah yeah this is what i believe yeah because you you are where you are great of course he's great in uh losing positions as well but i don't know like i think that you know animus had the full hand control wrist control when he did the shoulder pressure and i think that your shoulder pressure even without the wrist will be maybe even more than the it's a lot
SPEAKER_00: It's a lot because when I decide to press, I don't press at the wrong time. I usually press at the right time. And when I do, that change of pressure with the fact that I still had that side pressure commitment, it just overloads the person's arm and it just goes down. It's that timing. I've done it so many times. I know when that lane opens up. So it almost looks like it's effortless.
SPEAKER_04: but it's just a lot it's a lot going on when i decide to press you know you know the truth is when you catch someone in that position i don't know who can stop you when you find the right moment go up you usually choose the time that you feel that he is getting exhausted and once you go there i don't know how many people usually when you go up there to put your shoulder the smart ones
SPEAKER_04: take you here, you know, so that you can go behind. But if they get caught, you know, in here, and then you put the shoulder, I mean, like, probably they are feeling like you are standing on their arm with your feet, you know, like, that's how it looks like. Yeah, I don't know. It's very hard, very hard them to counter you in that position. And if we go, I know you don't have so much time. But if we go, the event is very close.
SPEAKER_04: um how many of the matches like are you familiar i am sure you are familiar with i saw your video that you you thought that you know mostly the americans are winning and is it some because because you think that way and some it is not to involve the feelings of friendship
SPEAKER_04: Patrick, it's impossible. If you ask an Italian, if he doesn't have a personal problem with Hermes, he's going to say, Hermes is going to win. It's a very normal thing. But we are people that not only are masters, but a little bit like authority about predictions and something. Can you give a little bit of them, at least even you think that Americans are going to win, and can you make a little bit technical
SPEAKER_00: analyze you know like john brzing versus ajumar okay so obviously i want john to win yeah i don't know if his hand and wrists are going to hold up you know i just i don't know over five i mean it's not over five rounds you know first one to win three yeah but
SPEAKER_00: I want John to win, but Zoliev is a dangerous human being. You know what I'm saying? That guy is very, very good. So I think there's a chance that John can control the rounds, or even if his wrist gets flattened, I think he could win rounds one and two without hand control, but I'm afraid it would take too much out of his arm and he wouldn't be able to get the third pin in. If he can control the hand and wrist, he's 3-0 sweeps it.
SPEAKER_04: But I just don't know. Who says that John is the one who is going to get exhausted? John, John. Listen, you don't compare yourself with anyone else, you know. Anyone who trains with you, I mean, like, who is just finishing you by endurance? Like, even Devon needed to dominate you with strength to beat you. But the strength, he was stronger.
SPEAKER_04: what if this thing was so close and then you could play your own game so it is it is not easy to uh finish you either about like to have better endurance than you so don't i wouldn't compare yourself but when you look at go back to his matches with chance dimitri kachan and pauline you will see that his opponents were much younger but john was the victorious after the wars he's the one that continue winning
SPEAKER_00: No, I agree, I agree. I just think Zoliev's a different level, in my opinion. I just think he's got so much experience. He's been doing it for so long. And I also believe, see, we're talking about the mental strength and endorphins when you get adrenaline. I think when Zoliev gets any type of position on John,
SPEAKER_00: his confidence will go from here to here, right? You're pulling John Brzee. So you're second guessing yourself already. But as soon as you get any type of position, it's just like me. If I was to pull LeVon and I could get that match to stop and I could see his knuckles just bend back slightly,
SPEAKER_00: I would lose my shit. Like, I would just be like, I'd be crazy. And I think Zoli would have that same type of adrenaline rush if he gets a good position on John. And I just think he would be able to find his way, find a path to it. I want John to win. I want John to win. I just don't know. I just think that when you say that you get your position,
SPEAKER_04: i mean you are playing a deadly game you know when you get your position like not many can get away from there you know and but if you talk about i i'm not sure just because zolev had a little bit hand control but couldn't control the pronator of john and he can keep you know john is the guy that you know in his muscle memory yeah a little bit wrist loss even he beat dennis chiplenko and of course he's not the same john but neither zolev is dennis chiplenko you know right so
SPEAKER_04: yeah so what do you think john do you think john i mean i am thinking that if you are pulling with john you really need to dominate that guy if you don't dominate the guy like john he may always find a way you know dmitry kashan took everything he was right there by the pet you know dmitry kashan i mean you say like he is a different level dmitry kashan i think in 2015 europeans he took second to
SPEAKER_04: Krasimir Kostadinov in 242s is much taller. His top role ability, I believe, I mean, if you put Dmitry Kachan versus Zolev, I would bet you that Dmitry Kachan is going to top role Zolev and beat him. Really? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, even, even it wasn't so easy Krasimir to hook him. He was just like this, this, it was like, you know, fighting with pronator, you know, and I don't know, we are talking about the years that Krasimir,
SPEAKER_04: even had the win versus Gennady and Levan, we are talking about. So what I'm just saying that just because someone has a lower career and less fame, it doesn't mean that, you know, we're talking about Zole who used to pull in 70 kilo and then he easily pushed to be 90 kilo, 200 pounds. While Dimitri Kachan has a built of even a super heavyweight if he gets a little bit muscular, you know, his height and everything.
SPEAKER_04: yeah i just i'm like you know there's one guy his name is tautier he has toppled zole many times and clement dimitri this year top rolls zole was injured but even before i have seen him topple in uh zole 2018 or 2019 europeans and then zole beat him that way so it is not that impossible to well you convinced me john's gonna win
SPEAKER_04: i don't know i don't know but it's not that easy zolev says that john is old and his wrist is vulnerable and he's gonna take and beat him this is what zolev said here he he said that he's gonna beat him with top roll but i just wouldn't uh underestimate john let's see and then if we if we go to
SPEAKER_04: Do you have any idea about who Arif is? Have you ever followed him? Of course I have. Beautiful, beautiful top roll. You know what I'm saying? Big guy, looks good. And he does well against other top rollers. Yeah, yeah. He does really good. You know, in 2016, Europeans, he won. And Krasimir, Gennady, and Levan all placed behind him when Arif won there. And there, Arif
SPEAKER_04: beat Krasimir twice and he beat Gennady as well there. And he also, um, beat, um, Krasimir same year and year before he beat, uh, Levan once at European championships. So Arif is, people are, you know, underestimating him. Arif keeps pulling Europeans, VARF, Turkish nationals, you know what it means. And I mean, I mean,
SPEAKER_04: just because he's choosing both events, you know, people are thinking that, you know, um, it may not be that level, but, um, I think I'm excited to see that match. I'm very excited to see that match. Um, 320 pounds. And then, you know, what happened the other day? I asked Hermes, he said he is 128 kilos. He was 180 kilos versus Matt mask, 120 versus Kurdesha.
SPEAKER_04: 124 versus Gennady and now 128 pounds versus Arif. Yeah. That's big. Biggest, biggest ever. So what's. 282. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Good math. Yeah. Yeah. So he's huge. That's big boy. Yeah. And another question. Do you think that Hermes has, come on, just be objective. Hermes has any chance at all versus Devon or not at all?
SPEAKER_00: I think he does, but not over six rounds or five rounds. I mean, could he get a flash pin on Devin one time or a dominating control of the hand and wrist one time? Yes. I don't think he could do it multiple times. You say the maximum two times, huh? Yeah, I mean, I don't see him winning over best of five or six rounds. I just think Devin has too many options. Even if it is Waffles?
SPEAKER_04: Probably. Okay. That's just my opinion, you know. No, I ask this not because of anything, but because, you know, Hermes often, you know, in Dubai, the press conference, you know, it's supposed to be between John and him. And then Hermes just jumped and said, bring the table and let's go, you know. And yeah, so that is, I was just thinking what people think if they have faith in Hermes or not, that that's what I was thinking, you know. Yeah. I mean, a 282 pound Hermes is a big dude.
SPEAKER_00: Big, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's a big dude. I don't know. We'll see. I'm excited about this week. Like, I'm dreading the travel because of wearing the mask and how long it is, and I know my back's going to hurt. You know, I'm dreading that, but I'm anxious to arm wrestle. Like, I'm ready to see everybody, but at the end of the day, I'm waiting for Saturday to get here as soon as possible. Do you see anyone around touching his weight, beating, touching the hook?
SPEAKER_00: I don't know who else is out there. You know, there might be some Russian or Kazakhstan dude who's a freak inside that could do it, but Todd's hook's strong. Todd's hook's strong. So do you know Sonev, his opponent, Jordan Sonev? Yeah, yeah, I'm watching him. He's impressive too. Yeah. Very impressive. Yeah, yeah. And maybe the last one I will ask you, Chance versus Sandris. I don't know anything about Sandris, except he said that I was horrible without my Kings move, so I don't like him.
SPEAKER_00: So I'm going with Chance. But yeah, I don't know anything about the kid. You don't know. Yeah. Now, what's so funny is people making these statements. They've never arm wrestled me. You have no idea what my level is. You have no idea how strong I am. But people just automatically assume that, oh, if it wasn't for the... Dude, I've been doing this for a very long time. I'm a whole lot more than what you've seen on the internet. So...
SPEAKER_00: but i'm asking i mean people ask me why kings move this weekend i will do whatever it takes to win this weekend within the rules but i don't think i have to i don't think i have to but i'm not trying to prove a point either i'm not trying to say oh look i can win without the kings but at the end of the day winning is what matters as long as i do it within the rules that's all that matters so how do you how do you specifically like like specify that like where is where is
SPEAKER_00: which you call king's move, which I call desperation move, when the shoulder is down or up? Well, yeah, okay, so that's what I mean. People, there's stuff that looks really, really bad. I think if you arm wrestle within the rules, it's an open top roll.
SPEAKER_00: right i think about my wrestling within the rules i'm in an open top row yeah so that's what i'm saying uh i'm not gonna drop my shoulder below the table if the rule is a humorous but whatever the rule is that's what i'm gonna stick at you know if i had to drop down low i'll make sure my shoulders above the table i'll make sure my humor responds at the right angle you know um but i'm not i'm that's the funniest thing is i've never even tried to cheat in a grip
SPEAKER_00: You know, I'm the least cheating guy in arm wrestling, but I get called a cheat. It's so funny. I mean, I just want to sit, close my thumb, close my hand. I want a straight wrist. I want to see my knuckle. I want somebody to say, go. I've never tried to get an advantage in the strap. I just, I just want a fair match, you know? And you tell me what the rules are and I'll arm wrestle within the rules. You just said that you have a good sponsor for a possible big match. If that ever happens, what would you prefer as rules?
SPEAKER_00: David Price- i'm gonna just tell you I don't care about I don't care it doesn't matter, I mean you got to say now, though, if it's Devon you want to go ahead and just go with WAF rules, you know. David Price- You don't want to give him the chance to do all this stuff that he does you know. David Price- You want to make sure. David Price- You pull him on the ruffles. David Price- Of course.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I mean, I'll pull anybody under any rules. Um, hell I'll pull him on a freedom table if he wants, you know, I don't even know what those rules are, but. Yeah. The question is like, remember you said that, you know, uh, with the rules that, uh, Devon is gonna pull, uh, Levan, you said that, you know, there is, uh, some hole there for Devon to not to manipulate, but just to tire Levan before.
SPEAKER_00: such thing would it also work against you that the lawyer has it has in the past you know but um well it won't anymore that's what i'm saying and whatever happens next nothing there's where i have a problem is i have respect for my opponents like i i i consider us all one big family
SPEAKER_00: Right. Yeah. And I'm too nice. I'm going to quit being nice until after the tournament. You know, Devin, I should not have been hanging out. I shouldn't have been having breakfast with him. There was a lot of things that he did just very he did very well in the lead up to our match that I realized in retrospect had a small effect, you know. So.
SPEAKER_00: like i'm sorry that gannati wasn't on here because i have great respect for gannati but i don't really want to be nice right now you know like i i don't i don't want to be friends i want to be friends after like yeah he wants to beat me i want to beat him
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah. Let the best man win, you know. But I have, like I said, say travels. I have great respect for him. He's an amazing athlete. I'm excited about this match. Yeah, yeah. But I'm going to walk up to him. I'm going to shake his hand. I'm going to set my hand down there and somebody's going to say go and you're going to see fireworks. Yeah. No need to get so much socialized. Well, no, I mean, it's what it's hard not to because we are a family. You know, there's no place in the world that you can't go that someone won't open their home to you.
SPEAKER_00: same thing for me there's not a country that i could go to then arm wrestler wouldn't say hey man come stay with me we are a family but we're also competitors after they went and now with social media and everything else it's just i'd rather you see you didn't go and hang out a week before the match you showed up the day before and you saw your guy and you are messing the next day now we have to get there a week early you got to do interviews you got to do this
SPEAKER_00: That shit is too much. I'd rather just be, tell me when to arm wrestle and I'm going to show up once I arm wrestle. Because it's too easy for me to want to hang out with my buddy. You don't want to hang out with your buddy if you're about to arm wrestle. Can you not put distance? You need to be in the same place. Can you not put distance? I will from now on. That's what I'm saying. That's the mistake that I made. I will not make that same mistake again.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, and I don't like being that way because I want to be friends and I want to have a good time. But right now... It's not because of disrespect. It's because of your motivation, you know, nothing else. Right? Yeah. I mean, the thing about our match versus every other match on the card is Gennady and I both have a point to prove. Gennady and I both are coming in this thing to destroy the other guy. Yes. War, war, war. Nothing else. War.
SPEAKER_04: That's it. So that's what you're going to see. You're going to see two guys that have everything to lose and will do everything in their power not to lose. So that's what's going to happen. And your plans, all the training and everything, you know, and then your future plans, you are not training only for this match. You are training for also bigger, bigger, bigger target until you reach the top
SPEAKER_04: And that's all. So this is this is your dreams. And the prize that you pay is more important than you know, you know, just Hey, how are you? How are you doing buddy in this and just as you said, you know, it can wait it just because you don't do this before the event. It doesn't mean that you are enemy or something. But guy, please, you know, we are gonna have a war there. We can't be so lovely to each other. Just just keep your, you know, distance and after the match,
SPEAKER_04: Let's sit, drink, eat, whatever. But let's do this. And for me, right now, for my motivation, it is better to be a little bit, keep the distance. We don't have to say harmful words to each other or something. But I don't want to be. Yeah, yeah. I understand. That's your point. Yeah. That's where I'm coming from right now. Yeah. Yeah. Anyways, Michael, I will not hold you more. I thank you very much and hope to see you and others very soon. Yes, sir.
