SPEAKER_04: Good.
SPEAKER_02: Hello. Howdy. How are you? I'm doing well. Australia's strongest man. I don't have anyone from Australia, and I was like, okay. It's hard, you know. How are we doing, Engin? I got COVID about two and a half weeks ago. It was not easy. It was not Omicron, the first one.
SPEAKER_02: I got from Seychelles when I went there and it was kind of heavy, but now I'm okay. I'm finally fine. Good. Thank you. Hey, Pradeep. Hey, Todd. How are you doing? I'm doing well. Pradeep, we are live, right? Yes, yes, we are live. Yeah, that's good.
SPEAKER_02: i've seen one thing whenever anyone says are we live they are 100 most definitely are live yeah when when someone like me uh you can never be sure i mean yep i uh so you you you didn't finish preparation
SPEAKER_01: i worked out this morning i'll work out tomorrow and that'll probably be my last day i gotta drive to chicago so i'll work out tomorrow and then i'm traveling tuesday and wednesday i think michael told ron and john will be in same flight i think from netherland to here but i think you are not in the same flight with them right i got a direct flight from chicago
SPEAKER_01: Oh, yeah, you told me that. Yeah. Yeah. So I haven't traveled in years without one of my flights being delayed or canceled. So if I can get a direct flight, I will drive the six and a half hours to get on a direct flight. Because then if that flight's canceled, I'm on the very next flight. I don't get stuck some in some foreign country trying to rebook tickets. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: So Jordan Soneb is also joining, right? Yeah. Yeah. What time is it? Is it already? Two minutes. We got two minutes. Okay. Okay. Yep. So I watched your YouTube program, Pradeep, with Todd, where he said that he just started, you know, some days ago to check who Jordan Soneb was. You know, he just...
SPEAKER_02: i i don't know i don't know what to think about you know uh todd is one of the guys that just confuses me the most you know with the things that he writes also with the things that he is doing and like it it sounds like amateur you know like you're gonna pull a world champion guy and then only some days before the event you you look at you know who he is you know and what he does you know
SPEAKER_02: but i'm sure that you know it is because of his unique personality that you know he's just jordan just came and he is just i don't know he's probably confidence probably confidence like he doesn't think that you know he needs to change um the things that he is doing it most likely from person to person but mostly just he is doing something that would work against anyone i don't know what
SPEAKER_02: But that's only my guess. You would know your reasons better. Hello, Jordan. Welcome. Hello. Howdy. Hi, Jordan. Hello. Can you turn the camera sideways, if possible? Yeah. Okay, but how can I see all of you? Just pull the page sideways. Then you will see there's those three.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, yeah, okay. Okay. Todd, okay, what's the reason behind that, you know, confidence or your preparation that, you know, it would work against anyone or you knew that he was a hook puller and you didn't need to really, you know, check? Well, yeah, I knew he was a hook puller because you told me, but my inside, I feel confident my inside game and my outside game is what I'm working on. So I've been working on it anyways because...
SPEAKER_01: just because of the super heavyweights. But I did have that match with Lachlan. So as soon as that match with Lachlan was over, that's when I started looking into Jordan. And calling him a hook puller is kind of underselling it a bit because he likes to get palm up and stop at that horrible position and dig his arm out of that. So that's a very unique style I haven't seen too many people do. Well, I've never seen anybody do it successfully.
SPEAKER_01: Um, but to be honest, had I known about that six months ago, I couldn't have changed anything. Yeah. But, but how many matches did you watch with him? Are you talking about his recent super match? Because he is not always in that position, but I watched the worlds. I watched the, uh, the super match with that blonde chubby ref. I can't remember the name where there was like a phone booth in the corner.
SPEAKER_01: and i watched him pull krazy sasho prudnik um and then there was another i mean i pulled up eight videos and mostly then i pulled up his highlight reel somebody made a highlight reel with him which is just like 40 minutes of him beating people so i only watched that once that was depressing so i went back and tried to find videos where he'd lose i understand
SPEAKER_02: I understand. You know, he's a very tall guy. He's about, what are you, 190? 191, I think. 191. Yeah. So he has long reach. And, yeah. I mean, you are not pulling like the guy, the Russian Bogoslov, mostly shoulder and tricep forward, direct on Jordan's bicep. You are more likely, you know, side and dragging, you know. This is what I understand.
SPEAKER_01: um so you will be applying the pressure to the different uh direction uh than the russian guy applied on um you're done yeah so yeah i don't i don't want it to be risk to risk i'll tell you that right now because i'll run out of table when they're really tall like that yeah um like devin or something it's i run out of table i can't ever i have a hard time finishing those matches but usually you don't finish either you know
SPEAKER_02: I mean, your ender is still, you know, continue. Like, I haven't seen anyone, you know, like an equal, like, slow start. I shouldn't say slow start, but Rustem beats you in a hook. But Rustem just finishes the match before you even get yourself positioned, you know. Not like, you know, like, do you think that Rustem would beat you if he just started in a hook, right, right, like that?
SPEAKER_01: I mean, I don't want to say anything disrespectful to Rustem because he's such a bad man, but yeah, I never felt like I was, I got to start in that. It would be, but those elite guys, those top world level guys, man, you usually got to pull them a few times before you figure out what works on them, you know? But yeah, I was just, I was unprepared and unexpected to handle.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, the reason that I asked because I don't, if we see you losing Jordan, that will be something that we just learn, you know, new, very new thing that we will learn. That is the reason I said, you know, Haji Murad beat you once at Zloty, but it was overall. But when you pull him super match in hook, you were the one that, you know,
SPEAKER_02: And Jordan, what do you think? What do you think generally about, you know, your match versus Hutchings? Before you answer, I will tell you, like, for me, as I said, you know, we will learn something new if you, because you are not a, like, flash pinner guy either, you know, not like Rustem. So if you beat,
SPEAKER_02: So it means that Hutchings will be able to apply his power. And then if you beat him there, that is something new for me. Maybe if I miss something in his own way that I'm talking about. He beat all the hook pullers that he had chance to apply his power. And now you're going to pull against him. So, yeah, I would like to ask your opinion. Well,
SPEAKER_03: uh in my mind it's hard to to imagine that after the goal we go and hook and then i can finish the the fight on uh from the beginning and as uh one month ago
SPEAKER_03: it was even harder to imagine to win a longer match so but now i worked a lot on my endurance and i worked with a guy that imitates todd hutchins style and i think i have a chance to to win a long match
SPEAKER_02: But from the start, I'm not sure if I could pin him. You don't have to. Every win counts, short or long, you know. Yes. And then people like, for example, Hajimrat Zolev. And like yesterday with Gasparini, we had the conversation. They think that you're going to win versus Hachin. When I wrote this about Zolev's, you know, opinion, you know,
SPEAKER_03: uh todd was the first one they put their laughing icon there you know yes yes i i screenshot that one i made a screenshot and i'm watching it yeah every day yeah yeah i'm watching it every day yeah we'll see what's what's your weight now now i'm 104 104 and something
SPEAKER_02: And you, Todd? Just a second. I'm 103. You're 103? Yep. So it's about your... But I'm rock solid, though. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: You look rock solid versus Zola as well. You didn't lose because there was anything wrong with your strength, but it was just like applying what you have. After round three, I thought it was over. You were going to win 3-2. Somehow, you just couldn't do what you did on the third round on round four. I don't know how that happened. I was like, after that match, there is no more
SPEAKER_02: explosiveness left with Ajay because you stop him first in the halfway and the second start after he fell in the right at the like natural position the beginning position of the match with the loss list of course and then so after the 20-30 seconds or total probably I don't remember exactly I talked that you know Zola will not be fresh enough to pin you again but it just happened
SPEAKER_02: that was a rough day that wasn't tough yeah we all look at each other we said it's over after round three okay thought stop him from now on it's over and then he was surprised the rest was surprised but you know so this is what i say that when you pull him round five in the hook you you look very dominant so i don't think that the problem was with the strength of course that time you cut down to 97 kilo right now 103 so it means that you didn't have to lose weight
SPEAKER_02: and i don't know you know the reason that you know i'm still thinking like like you're done like i don't know your your last last trainings with dave chaffee i mean i don't know how it goes fresh but even he gets a little bit tired and then you just you just pin him and we know how strong he is
SPEAKER_02: So what I'm just thinking that you probably have more horsepower in offensive way compared to Jordan. But Jordan, as he said that, you know, he is training his, he trained already his endurance to just to not to lose, not to lose, not to lose. And then, you know,
SPEAKER_02: finish you somehow but from other side we know that you're also great about endurance you know i just wanted to share my opinions you know before i go further you said that you train with someone uh closer in pulling weight to todd you're done who was it someone we know no no this guy is not so close he is a top roller but uh i put a strap around his body
SPEAKER_03: and and then i i first training some of the first good trainings that i did for todd hutchings were with crassi and he showed me the way thought balls and we are we were trying to imitate him as much as we can again i have one question for jordan
SPEAKER_00: So my question to you, Jordan, is in your preparation for this match, like a lot of guys in Bulgaria have faced Todd Hutchings, like Sasha Andreev has faced Todd Hutchings and, and recently Bojidar also had a practice pull with him. Krasimir Kostudinov also had a match with him. So did you train with them in preparation for this match? Like when was the last time you trained with these guys? Today we trained with Sasha. Oh, you did? Today? Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I did a short training, my last training with Sasha. And what was the tension of the training? Six days we are talking about before the event. It was, we were pulling what, 100%. Wow, wow, wow, wow. Yeah, it's interesting, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: i have one question for todd hatchings as well todd last time you had a background photo of a guy hunting buffaloes and we know that we know that you called your opponent lachlan adair buffalo n instead of buff elon so what is what does that background mean oh that's just the album cover on my computer i don't know jordan's nickname so i didn't know what to do so that's just the screen saver on my computer
SPEAKER_00: And one more question I had for you. You were mentioning that against the taller guys, you kind of run out of elbow pad when you're trying to drag your elbow back. I saw the same thing against Ronbeth as well, who was not a really tall guy, maybe 6'2", 6'3", somewhat like that. And you still, you beat him really...
SPEAKER_00: six, three. So he's also six, three. Maybe that could explain because against him, you were also right at the back of the pad and WL elbow pads are nine inches as we know, but you beat him easily. So is that just because your height compared to other guys is shorter, your arm is shorter, or is that something that you can or have worked on? It's well, if you're tall and really strong, it's hard because you know, their arm is,
SPEAKER_01: they can reach way across the table and my arm being short enough, because I don't really have a press, so I'm always dragging. So once I'm at the back of the table, right, and my hips are away from the table and I'm all the way back, and if their hand is still on the elbow pad and up, I just run out of room. So, you know, I got to develop some sort of emergency press, you know, if I run out of table.
SPEAKER_02: and you said at the beginning of the program you just talked about your outside skill or i misunderstood you yes outside yeah i'm working on my outside game okay just just try that some other time not not next saturday please no no you can try you can try it is just a friendly friendly suggestion i i'm terrible right you're done maybe it could be a easy win for you and now i am i am really you're wrong i'm sorry you can try you can try
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, that may be a quick win. That may be a quick win. Yeah, it is. You guys know that it's best of three, you know, best of five, sorry, best of five. So when you come, so after one of you reach round, I mean, the three wins, you know, you won't have any chance to try something different, unfortunately, because we said way too many matches, so we will not have
SPEAKER_03: uh time but maybe if you guys are okay after pools will be fun as well you know yeah oh yeah if everything goes okay without any pain or for me on the right hand there will be no after pools because i want to go to this tournament in chechnya oh oh i i thought waft didn't allow this
SPEAKER_02: i think it is allowed it is i don't know i think so i hope so you know someone just told me that you know waff does not allow you know for something but if they fix the problem it's good yeah i don't know if it is not organized by pal it's okay did you ask no
SPEAKER_02: no no i'm just asking just to make sure you know and but you said that the chechnya event is about one and a half months later after this one it's yes yes 26th of march march 26th yeah yeah yeah yeah um um todd i was listening your what's that you say you
SPEAKER_02: i don't know exact word you know like like perfection and excellence and something you know what were you saying you uh you can pursue excellence you can pursue victory yeah
SPEAKER_02: and then you made an explanation that, you know, like, do I understand you correct? Because if I understand you correctly, that is how I have been looking into arm wrestling right from the beginning, you know, that you, do you mean like if you do everything necessary to win, then in a general understanding, then like,
SPEAKER_01: When you talk about the excellence, you're talking about that? Yeah, it basically comes down to is all you care about is winning. Then you complain about the table. You complain about the rest. You complain about the weight cut. Was it fair? But if all you want, if what you're striving for is to be the best arm wrestler you can be, you don't worry too much.
SPEAKER_01: about the different weight classes or if the rest were fair, or if you had to travel more. Cause you're, you know, we're going to be in this sport a long time. I've been in it 20 years. And if I just kept traveling, you know, seeking just victory without trying to be excellent, then you're always trying to develop some new trick or whether or not it's the strap or the fair strap or the buckle or any of that stuff, as opposed to just learn the fundamentals and get stronger and take a long-term view. Let's go.
SPEAKER_02: yeah yeah but but just trust me that when you say like the if you complain about the weight difference you know when you are pulling it the very top level, you know, then the weight. kind of makes difference, you know, like I mean you have pulled some some of the superhero ways, I mean i'm sure that you also have limits as well don't you think. Oh sure yeah but I mean I don't let the losses knock me back, I mean I lose probably more than other people do.
SPEAKER_02: know and if i was if i was so consumed with trying to keep like a super good record that would just drive me nuts you know but yeah yeah but losing against the best super waves in the world would take nothing away from you only is it just either you win or you don't win you don't lose anything you know just i mean like you you pull dennis shiplenko and you lose and then oh look at
SPEAKER_02: How, how has she lost Dennis? I mean, what would you expect? You know, just, I mean, yeah, but, but it's saying like, you know, like Bojidar is 80 kilo guy. Whenever he, he would lose a hundred kilo Hutchings. I mean, there is, I mean, nothing to lose in my opinion, but if you think that 80 kilo guy pulling a hundred kilo, there is no disadvantage with the weights. Then I kind of disagree. It is in every strength sport, you know, go, go to weightlifting.
SPEAKER_02: go to wrestling, go to some others, you know, the best, like you can be 500 pound guy, or I can be 500 pound guy. But when, when you talk about the best guy in the world in that class, or one of the best guys, then it's kind of making a difference. No, I think weight definitely makes a difference. And I believe in the weight classes.
SPEAKER_01: but the only reason why i pulled some flink off and push car is because i was in that weight class i was probably 98 kilos when i pulled dennis yeah right but if i was only worried about victory i never would have stepped up and pulled that class i would have stayed in the lower class but if you truly want to be the the best arm wrestler you can be you got to pull the best arm wrestlers in the world even if you're going to get your butt kicked you still got to walk into the fight yeah yeah yeah yeah it's it's up to you but you
SPEAKER_02: i can't blame the guy who wouldn't prefer to do that one by knowing his limits you know i mean only if he trusts himself you know like i mean it is possible sometimes possible to beat every other guys best guys but i mean not everyone just i mean i don't know and you are you are ready to pull down there of course you agree with thot hatchings
SPEAKER_02: I told the same thing to Devon. I rather pull you than them pulling Hutchings because that is more pain in the elbow, the side pressure. It doesn't mean that I'm going to beat Devon or something, but people don't understand that Devon at 130 kilos and Devon at 100 kilos and Engin at 75 kilos and Engin at 100 kilos may be different. It doesn't mean that I'm going to win, but they think that it's something like
SPEAKER_02: impossible impossible impossible it's not you know but of course I would be heavily underdog but like like I will pull John next month in Norway if I lose people are gonna say okay you didn't even beat John how are you gonna beat Devon but Devon was 280 pounds while John was all bloated you know like 250 you know but it let them pull into 20 I don't think that it will be that easy you know
SPEAKER_02: Yeah. And what was your weight when you put that one? Oh, I was like 230 235 pounds, you weigh in with your clothes on. So I think I was like, about this weight, maybe two kilo more. Maximum. Yeah, well, yeah, about two, about two or three kilo more. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And I'm not gonna go
SPEAKER_02: deeply into there but officially on the paper you lost that match but if the pads were seven by seven do you think that you know it would make uh the difference like some in my opinion it was the first one was pin but um neil once told me that you know okay it was pin but what about the next but i think that you were after it was pin you you kept
SPEAKER_02: that position for about half minutes right yeah that was long it was long yeah yeah so it takes some of the the the explosive horsepower i believe yeah yeah yeah yeah i don't know if the table mattered um no no when when somebody is pulling the elbow more back dragging you know i think that was definitely difficult i'll just i just beat him next time there'll be another time
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And I get one more thing about that match. If I'm not mistaken, Todd can correct me here. WL pin pads are still one inch lower than the regular WAF table pin pads. Is it? Oh, I didn't know that. Is it right, Todd? I have no idea. I know the elbow pads are long. I don't know if the pin pads are taller. WL pin pads are lower than WAF table or Mezzurenko table pin pads. Oh.
SPEAKER_02: Todd is just like perfect guy for Devon's freedom table. Yeah, he just doesn't give a shit. You know, he's just like, yeah. And Jordan, if we go to East versus West event, the other matches, and before that, like if you would like to share and how do you see like your percentage
SPEAKER_03: chance you know against todd you know how do you see like on the paper percentage i don't know i cannot see percentage from paper yeah but can you say that you're gonna win i say i will say that i can win but i will never say i'm going to win okay
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but you're going there to win for sure. I am not kidding. I'm going to give my all. Yeah, that's good. That's good. You know, it just I tried to hype the event, but these guys are just they just talk as much as they should. But let's see. Let me try my chance with Todd now. Same question. Oh, I like my chances.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know what the percentage are. I mean, I got a plan, but it always goes out the window after the first match. So we'll see. What I like best is I haven't seen Jordan flash pin a lot of people. I've seen him flash pin a few people, so I feel a lot more comfortable that it should be a slower start, man, unless he goes home right now and does nothing but train speed. So, you know.
SPEAKER_01: mean i could sit here and give you a recipe on how to beat me if that's what you want yes please please share i mean devin podzi and rustam wrote a book on how to beat me so that's out there oh come on i haven't read that book either i'm just telling you that book is out there jordan just asked you to tell him how to beat you you're done it was
SPEAKER_00: don't you know already uh i will find out you will find that if you know or not yeah maybe and get my my it is just my guess when todd was saying earlier that he's practicing his outside move maybe he was trying to say that if jordan goes top roll then he's also going top roll with no you i have never seen you on top or something
SPEAKER_03: Only a few times to slip his hand. Yes, I tried to top roll once in 2016 against Hadji. And he beat me so easily that when I got out of the stage, some other guys asked me, why didn't you pull him? Why did you let the match go? I was trying to explain to him that I tried to top roll, but he beat me so easily that it looks like
SPEAKER_02: I was letting the match go. Yeah, you were trying to sleep your hand? No, I was trying to top roll him, but nothing happened. While trying to sleep or something, some other people here have experience about Haji as well. What was that? No, I said about trying to sleep from Haji's hand and losing.
SPEAKER_02: Some other person here also has a recent experience about it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, Haji's tough, man. He's a bad man. Okay, let's go then. Let's go then. Haji Murad versus John. Let's hear. I like John. I like John for that. I don't know how much, but yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, I know I've pulled both of them, you know, and I've pulled Hazi recently, but I like John for that match. Do you think that he will be able to sleep in this strap, top roll him? Yeah, and John's hand's quite a bit bigger than mine. I mean, I think John will get knocked off go, off center, but I think he'll keep enough of his hand up there, and he'll take that pronation on Hazi. I think he'll slow it down, and then if John wants to slip, he will.
SPEAKER_02: I think John's pronator is stronger than yours, probably. Definitely. I think so. I mean, it was the last time we pulled. I assume it is today. Athlete uses better because of years of experience. Even if you train pronator at the table, at the world level competition, your experience of using your pronator effectively is much less than his. Yeah. I have to concentrate on using it. He can just use his naturally.
SPEAKER_03: i agree so you are saying that john is the favorite i think john is the favorite in that match okay and jordan well i most of the people i think say that brazing is the favorite so uh in this case i won't had you to win because i like uh he said that he said are you gonna be yes this is the second reason
SPEAKER_03: I'm supporting Hatch because he's the first guy that supported me against Hatchings. Yeah? Yes, yes. Most of the guys are betting on Todd, but he was the first one who said, I think Jordan's going to win. That's why I want him. You want him? It's a different thing than what you think. What? What?
SPEAKER_03: I'm not asking who do you want to win. I'm asking who do you think is going to win? I cannot say. I don't know. I think Hadji has chances, but he has to go to strap and hook John because if he goes outside, I don't think it's going to happen. But did you listen to him? He said he's going to top roll John and beat him.
SPEAKER_02: okay and then he said that he is he is not gonna accept to go to strip directly he said if john wants to go to strip he needs to earn it he said so he will basically try to do the same thing that he did to thot to john he's gonna try yes but john is going to go to trap anyway yeah but you remember tyno tried sasha tried you know probably top right um it was not that easy to
SPEAKER_02: uh clement did it at last swap here yes but sasha is not a top roller brazing is a yeah like a professor and so and if we go to michael todd versus gannady
SPEAKER_02: I don't know Gennady that well, but... You don't even know your own opponent until the last few weeks, you know. So it's normal. What does he man? But I don't want to just pick all the Americans. You should ask the difference. But I would think Michael Todd's probably the favorite there. Yeah. You watched Gennady versus Hermes? Yeah, you did? Yeah. Yeah. So I heard that Michael is in very good shape.
SPEAKER_01: You have any idea about it or I, I mean, I've talked to him on the phone, but I haven't, I don't have any like special knowledge of what he's been. He trains hard. I mean, the guy, you know, spends 24 hours a day training and arm wrestling. So, I mean, I know he's dedicated, so, um, I mean, he probably works harder at it than anybody I know.
SPEAKER_00: i have one i have one small idea about that again i recently watched corey west on paul italia's channel so corey west recently practiced with the todd hutchings i don't know sorry michael todd i don't remember exactly when but paul italia asked him what do you think about michael todd's current shape compared to when he faced devon led because
SPEAKER_00: He's someone who keeps on practicing regularly. And surprisingly, Corey West did not say, not even once, that Michael Todd felt stronger than what he was feeling back in May 2021. He said he's at par with what he used to be in May 2021. This is what his training partner said. Same level he says, huh? Yeah, okay. Yes. And Jordan, you are more familiar probably to Gennady.
SPEAKER_03: so it in my opinion it depends how strong gennady's climbing ability is because he's not going to hook michael todd his wrist is going backwards if he is trying to hook so it depends gennady how did he train his climbing ability because i think he has some press if he manages to climb enough
SPEAKER_03: then do the do the press he can win but so what i understand that basically you see michael's chance higher but yes i think i think michael has more chance to win this because you look like you know you are trying to find a way for gennady to uh yes this is the only way i see how gennady can because
SPEAKER_03: his wrist here his control is not that strong we saw with with hermes and he doesn't support his wrist by going forward either with uh hermes i i was expecting gennady to go forward maybe lose his wrist but stay forward and i don't know if he's afraid to go forward because last time when he went forward against kardechia he got hurt
SPEAKER_02: And now maybe he's thinking more on his biceps. That's why he didn't go forward. Yeah, I understand. So if you talk about, I'm trying to find a match that, you know, Todd would know the opponent as well from this. So I don't know who can that be, but Rambat versus Zurab. You know Zurab?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I watched him just I didn't know who he was until you matched him with Ron. And I don't know how much Ron's been working lately. I mean, he's Ron's a legend. He's a he's a bad, bad dude. But I have a hard time doing these predictions because I don't know if these people are, you know, how hard they've been trained in the last two or three months and I haven't seen Ron
SPEAKER_01: like out there because he, you know, Ron doesn't keep a real public profile anyway. So I, I, I, I just don't know what shape Ron's in. I'm sure he's coming in prepared, but yeah, that other guy, I almost think the other guy's got the advantage, you know? Yeah. Yeah. Ron, Ron asked me to say the match for him, you know? So, and he said that, you know, he's not coming here to lose. He knows the match was set.
SPEAKER_02: more than two months ago so probably he is prepared I don't think that he would just travel all the way here you know without getting as much as possible train oh I agree but two months ain't enough for me to you know train so my training's like three and four months long yeah but Ron Ron has always been you know just like competing there and there you know just I mean I I have never seen
SPEAKER_02: he has i've known him for years i mean i got a lot of respect for him it took me three years to beat him the first time when i tried so i mean i'm very familiar with him yeah when you say like talking about three years it took for you to beat him i remember the day that you beat clevedine rest in peace right from there and then did you beat david randall in the same event or no
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it was a, it was, uh, there's three of us in it. There's three of us in a class for money. There's like a money class. So it was me and Dave Randall. Yeah. I was like, first time I realized, I knew that you were like crazy strong. You beat John in Vegas, lost on foul or something. But, uh, John, if you remember competed two weight classes, 90 in the supers while you come between one class, but still.
SPEAKER_02: What you did that day was we were like, I mean, who the hell is see, you know, I mean, we knew you, but like, like, how can you come to that level, you know, to, because first time I saw you some years ago, 2001 Harley pull, you were in 80. You were just like a regular guy, you know, you were not like only slow, but you were also not, not connected, not like probably the very beginning. Right. Yep. I lost two matches and went home. Oh yeah. Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah. I lost to Kenny Hughes and Cobra Rhodes and went home. That was it. You pulled versus really, really, really tough guys of that time, you know. Yeah. Yeah. I think Bill Sinks won the class. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, so if we go, okay, Rambat versus Zrab, what do you think you'll do? If the match stops, I think Rome will beat...
SPEAKER_03: Zurab. Which way? If the match stops, if it is a long match, Ron Bath will take it. If it's going to be short, then Zurab. Zurab has about 5 or 10 seconds to win. Either way, I think Ron is going to win. He has some endurance and Ron has heart. I have seen him pulling
SPEAKER_02: and he he never quits i like him can you imagine that you know the the team that's coming from us john is like 57 and ron is about 60 and michael probably 48 and uh only young one is todd is 18 how old are you 855.
SPEAKER_02: Can you imagine all these guys are coming? And just when you think about it, just think that, you know, like four guys will come from US. One is 48 years old. One is 55. One is 57. One is 60. Can they be the best of the East? You would just say, I mean, come on, you know, just old people. But then whenever you put the picture of those old people, I think picture, Michael Todd's picture, John's picture, Ron's picture, the things are changing. But the bad, bad part that
SPEAKER_02: small criticism for the north american uh arm wrestling i mean these guys to be like still the best in arm wrestling you know it is just come on guys you know these guys there should be like younger guys and would be beating these guys you know they are still these guys are still the most scared ones in north america i didn't talk about that once there's enough of us in north america
SPEAKER_01: Just grab the people you talked about, John, Ron, Michael Todd, even I'll throw myself in here, that's fine.
SPEAKER_01: but we haven't produced any champions behind you know i mean i've trained and worked with a lot of people but i haven't i mean i produced one champion that was years ago and she's a girl she's a little tiny girl but i haven't i mean i myself haven't mentored or coached somebody else into championship level status so there's some bad technology transfer you are you are smart guy just tell us explain us why
SPEAKER_01: i i don't know i mean but then again but we're all different so we you know we we've we've all got different training styles and philosophies so maybe you know we're still in this country we're still hunting for a recipe to go but i can't i mean i've thought about it for a long time and i've been thinking about this for about eight years i can't figure out how um i mean we keep there's a lot of strong guys coming up behind us but they're not being trained or coached by us you know they're learning it themselves
SPEAKER_02: But still, you know, there aren't, there aren't, I mean, who are in North America, not North America, but U.S. to beat these guys, you know, in the same weight category. It's not that, I mean, hard to find those guys. Like whenever I remember Dave Patterson, you know, I don't know, Cobra Rhodes and John and all those other guys run bad. These guys were winning like when they were like 20, 22 years old, 25 years old.
SPEAKER_02: They were just I mean kicking ass you know and I don't know I don't know I was expecting you know, like you guys, but the only thing is. You guys are not only effective in the North America, you are effective against the rest of the world as well, you know that that is another problem yeah. And then people in North America somehow they they continue pulling effectively till they are like 5060.
SPEAKER_02: And then over here, people compete like wow for something when they are 35, 36, and then they just quit. They just quit. I don't know. Maybe the competition level is here very high. It's very hard for them to be qualified in Russian nationals or Georgia nationals or Bulgarian nationals. I don't know. But when you look at that way, this year, it took second place in wow, when he was 50, 51 years old, you know?
SPEAKER_03: Anyways, it's interesting, Artur. And Jordan, what do you think about Morozov versus Prudnik? Oh, it will be very interesting. I don't know. I would say Prudnik. I think he will manage to hook Morozov, yes.
SPEAKER_01: yes because if he tries to pro morozov feels really good against top rollers morozov is good huh because his his arm uh yeah height yeah yeah yes and i think his wrist is pretty good also and do you know morozov yeah yes i i i don't know him real in depth but i agree i think i mean prudnik's one of those other very elite level people i'd pick prudnik over pretty much anybody
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I think. Do you think that the reason that you lost him so quickly because of your problem about the start or you were kind of tired before you pull him or what do you think in Moldova? He I definitely lost on the start with him when I know I'm going to lose the start. I got to get really, really tight and try to relax my hand and
SPEAKER_01: before prudnik i was feeling good with the starts how you know i was i thought i had it the timing down but then prudnik was just on a whole nother level of speed with me and i just i just wasn't prepared for it i thought i was i actually thought i was starting well that day and then prudnik just shut me down you know yeah yeah your second nose was to alan mckeo i think another yeah yeah yeah yeah i remember
SPEAKER_02: I mean, that's the only way to beat you. This is what I understand. A quick, very quick, explosive outside move, you know, that is. And it better be without the strap, because if it is in the strap, then still taking your wrist is not the solution, you know. The straps slow everything down. So, you know, the strap matches are always slower.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but just someone like you that you know that you need strep. How can you not be so professional about going strep after 20 years? You know that strep and no strep for you is day and night. And then you should be, as much as you focus on winning or strength or something, don't you think that, listen, you are in a very high level. It's not criticism.
SPEAKER_02: i'm not criticizing you but like don't you think that it's almost equally an honest question for you if you would go to step with zola of duty he would beat you no honestly no see this is what i'm talking about here yeah i'm working on it don't worry i'll be there i got 10 15 more years to figure this out i hope so you know because you are you are incredible you know you are incredible when i saw you with dave chappie
SPEAKER_02: i was like no this is the guy that i want to pull last you know like the last person around my weight you know like to up to 100 kilo i mean who do you want not to pull engine i mean it's not because i'm gonna be rest or something you know or not even close but i i wouldn't want to pull you because you would hurt my elbow you know with the side pressure what were you asking uh someone was asking in the comments have you ever faced toward hatchings no
SPEAKER_02: glad i'm glad i didn't you know the side pressure yeah and many of the comments were about people are saying that they want to donate i'm assuming the monetization issue has not been solved yet yeah you have to send super chats suddenly youtube suddenly caused some problems and i don't know i'm trying to fix it but whatever you know yeah and and do you know tobias sporong you're done yes i know this guy yeah
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, he's gonna face Morozov. People says that Morozov is heavily favorite. And whenever I talk with the train row, Tobias, they said that, he said that, you know, his left is 30% stronger than his right right now. And then it confused me, you know, to if he's that close because I saw him versus Kurdesha. It seemed like he gave the same trouble that Ermes gave to,
SPEAKER_02: so if his left is really even not 30 but 15 stronger do you think that there is a chance that you know he may surprise many people yes his wrist is also pretty good his cupping ability is on a very high level but it depends
SPEAKER_02: morozov is good in hook he will win but if they are pulling each other i don't know what is going to happen i'm not sure yeah you know you know the truth is uh i was like i waited till the the day that you pull versus bogoslow and i was like you know i was gonna already
SPEAKER_02: i asked someone to ask to bogoslow would you pull todd hutchings you understand in this supermarket okay and we were i was like 99 sure he was gonna beat you because yeah what i was told that bogoslow is 110 kilo the 85 kilo guy went up to 110 they say he's super strong and he's gonna
SPEAKER_02: beat you, this is the information, I get it. And I was like, okay, can you tell Bogoslov? And I said, maybe no, maybe not to confuse him before his super match, just wait. And then after he beats Sonev, and then ask him, and then you beat Bogoslov. And I was like, okay, wow, okay. And then it is Jordan that should pull Hutchings. And then whenever I ask you, would you pull? You said you were going to ask me at the same time, you know.
SPEAKER_02: remember he said yes yes yes we were we were speaking with bosdar and he and he told me why don't you ask him yeah you deserve yeah you deserve that day to hold the guy's shoulder pressure on your bicep and then beat him you were like wow yeah so now can you tell us that you are any better shape than that time or about the same or yeah i'm better i'm better i'm lifting
SPEAKER_03: heavier weights let's say five percent more something like this it makes so much difference yes yes in those exercise that i'm doing i added five percent for example and i have had also more endurance so side pressure power i'm not sure maybe
SPEAKER_03: because side pressure i train my side pressure only on practice on the table with people so i cannot measure it but actually i do one exercise for side pressure and it's it was five percent more but my um
SPEAKER_03: my pressing and my holding power i cannot measure but my endurance 100 is better so basically todd is in trouble he's in trouble
SPEAKER_02: yeah that that that that might is gonna be gone you know that legend that you know nobody can beat him at his weight in a slow hook pool nobody has better interest than him in hook or something the finally it's coming to the end congratulations on a great show 10 million views yeah no no i'm just trying to mess with todd you know you're done
SPEAKER_02: I'm just, you know, I'm trying to a little bit provocate him, but I don't, I am not sure if he's getting provoked or he's just laughing. He's laughing, but I don't know in which way. I'm always, I'm always nervous before every match. You don't need to scare me. I thought that you were very confident, especially when you put that laughing on the Zola's comment, you know, I was like, what a confident guy that, you know, he's just like laughing, you know? Yeah.

SPEAKER_00: Jordan, do you remember in 2015, John Brzezink said that do not hook Devon Laird. And in 2021 and 2022, Devon Laird said that do not hook Todd Hutchings. And you are primarily a hook puller. So how can you assess those statements about Todd Hutchings? Devon's statement. What can I say about those statements? I don't care what people think.
SPEAKER_03: I care what I think and mostly I care what I believe. I believe that anything is possible. I know that I have nothing to lose and this is a great opportunity for me to face one of the greatest guys because I really respect your thoughts. A couple of years ago when I started armwrestling
SPEAKER_03: and until now i'm watching your videos and i really like the way you train and the way you pull like you don't cheat you just grab and go go inside and i have the opportunity to meet you in my best shape ever so why why should i top row i will go inside and i will prove them wrong
SPEAKER_02: yeah yeah somebody needs to prove them wrong yeah yeah yeah with with that minor mindset you know people around todd's weight should all change the style you know anyway so it will be great and i i hope you this time you know todd is gonna be in istanbul not in yalova and yeah i will pick you up um
SPEAKER_02: from the airport and then you will be accommodated in a five-star hotel. Everything will be great. But listen, you guys need to sign 150 t-shirts. That's fine. Look how big that hand is. I'm a writing mother. I'm a writing fool.

SPEAKER_02: so it will be similar to the 2018 i think it was vendetta 50 where all the western guys were on sitting on one side and eastern guys were sitting on one side yeah yeah i i think yeah yeah something like that we are gonna make it like you because a lot of guys 29 uh pullers so it will be like you you you table um did you know that on that day when dennis was pulling that one
SPEAKER_02: I was the one that started to ask questions and provocated everything. And then after that, right away, they bring the table, they start pulling. I think that was not live broadcasted or anything. I don't know if it was live or not, but I take the microphone. They were asking questions. And then Anna Mazurenko asked me, you would probably find a good question. And then I started. And then a little bit of provocation.
SPEAKER_02: then table came and then they start well you know day before yeah of course this time is not going to happen something like that don't worry guys yeah anyway so thank you very very much todd you want to add anything you want to say anything oh i'm good i'll be there on the 10th yep yep see you there and jordan we will see we will see each other in istanbul yes sir i'm looking forward to it
