SPEAKER_00: We started. Oh, okay, okay. Yeah, all starting very soon. Okay. Okay, we are live. We are? Yes, we are. That's good. Yeah. Engin, come back. Yep, I'm coming back. Yep.
SPEAKER_04: yes yep we're starting now huh okay guys very good to see you guys and your name is tornike yes yes correct nice to meet you tonic is today gonna help us uh for the uh translation and to levan and and raymond's you know
SPEAKER_04: a show every show without raymond is something missing for sure hello leon how are you good to see you hello hello nice how are you good good yeah just one second and just one second yeah you can start right okay um i don't i don't know where we start but uh let's start with
SPEAKER_02: Do you feel this is the biggest match of your life, Levan? He's saying that it could be.
SPEAKER_01: To be honest, he hasn't thought about the match too much yet, but he's sure as the time goes on and the match time approaches, probably it will take most of his thought time. At the moment, he thinks that it could be the match for him, but he's not feeling it yet. Okay.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, so he thinks that it is too early. Levan, you were out of shape when you shared the video, the last training video? Or was it like when you were tired, you know, you just filmed the end of it or something, you know, the training? Yes, it was a lot of work. I was in a good shape, but I didn't have enough strength.
SPEAKER_02: He's saying that it's basically off season for him. He hasn't trained for more than a month now.
SPEAKER_01: And actually the last training he did was with Larry when he curled 135 kgs, which was more than a month ago, and he hasn't trained since. So basically he had a break. And how long time do you think that you will be ready for Devon after you started?
SPEAKER_02: so he's saying that the nearest plan is in two weeks he's flying off uh for the filming
SPEAKER_04: which probably will take one month, after which he plans to kick up the training and start to prepare seriously. Okay, I understand. Okay, a few questions. Is that the movie thing, is it a secret, Levan, or is it something that you can share with us, or no?
SPEAKER_02: He's saying that he has signed the contract
SPEAKER_01: which also has the non-disclaimer agreement. So since he signed it, he can't disclose too much of the information about the shootings and the movie. But he's saying probably everybody already knows what movie it is, but he can't share any more details at the moment. That is so awesome.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, okay. A few questions, and then I will go to his predictions about the Istanbul event. Can he share his top five currently in the world without being afraid to hurt anyone's feelings? I would like to ask you about the results of the Istanbul tournament. I would like to say that the top five
SPEAKER_02: Is there anything you would like to say? Top 5? Well, I would like to say something. I don't want to be objective. I don't want to talk about it, I don't want to say anything. I don't want to be objective.
SPEAKER_02: No, but really. Oh, oh, Vitaly, man. Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh, oh.
SPEAKER_01: He's saying that he will be objective and no hard feelings to anyone. But he thinks that the top five are Vitaly Leleitin himself, Alex Krudetsha, Devon Larratt, and either Michael Todd or Ermes Gasparini.
SPEAKER_04: yeah it is almost we have the same opinion with him yeah yeah super chat it says limit 888 thank you is leon willing to shave his beard if he loses a round versus leon uh completely shave off
SPEAKER_04: Hey, listen, listen, listen. Even to go deep detail of this question, does it show us that he's not that confident about it? It looks like, it looks like, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: In any case, in the end, when it comes to the end of the sixth round, it means the end of the game, because the whole round is over.
SPEAKER_02: He's saying that usually when he participates in top eight,
SPEAKER_01: uh all the rounds matter and the prize money depends on the number of rounds you win so the motivation is financial also in this case uh the financial motivation is off uh he still wants we will try to commit to winning each of the rounds uh but still he might consider trying uh trying different different options uh it will depend on his mood he's saying uh if he will go for
SPEAKER_04: total devastation or not. Yeah, but no, last year we did an interview with him. He said his biggest goal was to finish his career without losing any single round. It is so sad to see him, you know, changing his goals that quick. He still mentioned the goal. He mentioned, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: That promise still stands. The only person who might deserve a round against him is John Brzenk.
SPEAKER_04: Oh yeah, that's the man. He knows the truth. Peele Woody, UK at Super Chat, thank you. If you defeat Devon, can we see Levon versus monster Michael Todd, please? They ask him.
SPEAKER_02: Why is that? It is interesting to me because I am a journalist and I have been working in this field for a long time. Michael is also a very interesting journalist.
SPEAKER_01: He's definitely considering and interested in the match, especially since Michael and Gennady are meeting each other soon. Especially after that match, he thinks that this matchup could be really interesting. Yeah, but is it only if Michael wins?
SPEAKER_02: In case if Michael loses, it might happen a bit later. So the timeframe might change.
SPEAKER_04: Caroline Loomis, Ray, the woodland pose is a beautiful thing. It's fine. Thank you. Okay, Gigi Mugu, Levan, if you lose to Devon at King of the Table, will you blame the rules referee and want to pull again under pile or rough rules? And are you scared of Rainbow?
SPEAKER_01: In this book, King of the Table is criticized for his actions, and it is said that Ptolema is the father of the actions of Alice, and Ryan Bowen is the father.
SPEAKER_02: Well, if there was something that could be done, they would have done it, and it was possible. In any case, at that time, there was a lot of pressure, and I think, to be honest, all of us, including Molodin, and, of course, Molodin wasn't the only one,
SPEAKER_01: He's saying that he knows these rules and he can adapt to them. Although he doesn't like these rules, but meeting Devin was unavoidable considering that the fans were expecting this match. So this match should happen nonetheless, whatever the rules are.
SPEAKER_04: And is he scared of Ryan Bowen? He's seeing nightmares in his dreams. Wildframe asks, if prime Levan is stronger than Denis, then they will need to change the sport.
SPEAKER_01: I'm just joking. You are great guys looking forward to the best match in current history. The thing is, I want to ask him.
SPEAKER_04: Who is the god of armwrestling for Levan, greatest of all times for him? John, without a doubt. Is there any other ones that he sees as legends in the sport of the history?
SPEAKER_01: So he sees only only these super heroes as the legends, right? Is Zolaev a legend?
SPEAKER_02: He's saying that he mostly considers the same weight as himself.
SPEAKER_04: uh it's it's much it becomes much harder to analyze when uh looking at the lighter guys and if we go into that realm we can even say that engine thank you um okay becoming top promoter like larry i i'm not a promoter i'm the servant of our messenger server you can consider me and caroline rooms levan how many years before someone beats you
SPEAKER_04: I will ask him something. I will ask him something. He told me, he told me that he wants to finish his career without any loss. But whenever he thinks like how long does he plan to continue his career? The reason I am asking
SPEAKER_04: Because if you if you go to do notes. noticed, you can say, like North America. You can see like look at the top guys that you know, like run bad 59 years old john 57 years old attaching 55 years old Devon Michael Todd cody married, these are all over 45 years old, but when you go to do yes.
SPEAKER_04: then you don't see anyone so competitive at the elite level over 40 years. Usually they start early and start about 30, 35. Then we can see people like Zolev is 37, 38, but we don't see much. And when Levan is considering a career, does he plan, how long he imagines, like five more years?
SPEAKER_04: Before 40, around 40, how old is he now? 30? He's 33. What? 33. 33? Yes. OK. So how long does he imagine himself being part of armwrestling? .
SPEAKER_01: In your opinion, what did you think of this career? Because you said that Johnny, Lara and the others are 50 years old, but the rest of them are not Donetsk residents. In your opinion, what did you think of this career?
SPEAKER_02: Well, it's hard to say for sure. It's a very traumatic sport. I don't think I've ever experienced such a traumatic experience in my life. It was a traumatic experience for me because I didn't know what to do with my life.
SPEAKER_02: He's saying that it mostly boils down to health and injuries.
SPEAKER_01: and trying to avoid those as much as possible. He gives an example that at the moment his left is quite injured and not ready for the professional matches as an example. So he will try to do his best. The plan for him is definitely to go until around forties. And after that, not to quit, but to
SPEAKER_04: They still in the game, but with longer intervals between the matches like one or two years. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I understand. It's interesting that last time we had the interview with him about one and a half years, his left was injured and is still injured. It is terrible, you know, that he doesn't get any better sometimes.
SPEAKER_02: You know, when you don't do anything, it doesn't get better. I think you need to be light. You need to keep like active, but he's saying that he is training the left, uh, and it is coming. Uh, it is becoming better.
SPEAKER_01: But it's still not at the same level, at the top level already to be in the top game. He thinks that it might take one more year to get to the best possible. One more question I will ask him and then I will ask, I will tell Raimonds to ask what he wants. We are not going to keep him so long. But, you know, Devon likes to play a lot of
SPEAKER_04: mind games and screws his opponent's mind months before the event with the YouTube videos and everything. Does Levan think that it will affect him in any way, either positive or negative way, or he will motivate him or he will just harm his chemical balance or whatever?
SPEAKER_01: I'm sure that he will do the same things to him as well. I'm sure that he will do the same things to him as well.
SPEAKER_02: Well, there are two reasons. The first reason is that this is a reality show. And such events are in all sports, even though they are not allowed.
SPEAKER_02: For example, MacGregor, MacGregor was the director of the U.S. Institute. There are such people in the industry, and this kind of work is not available to the public, because there is a large audience. In my psychology, when I make a debut,
SPEAKER_02: He's saying that actually he likes how Devon does this, how he creates the show around the match.
SPEAKER_01: he thinks that that's much needed to engage the public and also to remind himself that the match is on and he thinks that it will positively affect uh himself for the sake of motivation and as a reminder that the big match is coming yeah but yeah we we is from east we are kind of a little bit more i'll say like red lines you know compared to the
SPEAKER_02: you know western guys you know and does he does he have any red lines uh
SPEAKER_02: He's saying that he has not
SPEAKER_01: He has never felt disrespect from Devin before, and he thinks that it will continue that way probably. He thinks that joking around and trash talking, that's totally fine and acceptable. Of course, it has some boundaries and shouldn't become personal, but he expects that Devin will keep the game clean. Do you have anything to ask, Ramos? Yes, yes.
SPEAKER_00: first one will be uh if devon uses his king's move do you feel it will be legit or you know you don't have to jump in a big king's move but just get your arm straight and just kind of hit you out of position is it a little bit of a concern or no concern there uh
SPEAKER_01: Do you really think that Devon can stop him with a Kings move? I asked him, what does he think? He doesn't expect it.
SPEAKER_00: So, the rules will be different from WAF rules. So, in WAF, we can create tension on the start, but there is no movement. In King of the Table, WL, you can see a lot of movement going on right before the goal. Is this a little bit of concern? Because some guys can get in positions faster from there, and will you practice starting with these rules? This will be discussed in the federation.
SPEAKER_01: In the beginning, it is the decision of the authorities to make decisions, from the point of view of the authorities. In the end, it is the decision of the authorities to choose a specific asset, an active asset, and to think about it. Yes, I agree with this, because I think this is a very important issue.
SPEAKER_02: and he was able to go to the Wards. He was able to go to the Wards and he was able to go to the Wards and he was able to go to the Wards and he was able to go to the Wards and he was able to go to the Wards and he was able to go to the Wards and he was able to go to the Wards and he was able to go to the Wards
SPEAKER_02: I think this is a big problem for us, but I think it's possible because we don't know how to do it. We don't know how to do it. In fact, it's impossible. It's impossible to do it. It's impossible to do it. It's impossible to do it. It's impossible to do it.
SPEAKER_01: He's saying that he will definitely take notice of that. He watched closely all the King of the Table matches and monitored how the rules were and how the matches started. He plans to incorporate such starts in his training. But overall, he thinks that such environment can be even beneficial for him because basically, ready-go disappears. It loses its meaning.
SPEAKER_01: and it becomes a powerful start from the get-go. So this might be even more beneficial for him. Hey, he's a smart guy.
SPEAKER_00: Devon keeps telling you to get bigger. Like every time he just tells you, get bigger. Do you plan on getting bigger or are you going to stick to 170? I think 170 kilos was your optimum weight because people are looking for excuse. It's not Devon who's looking for excuse here, but people are like, well, he was just too big or the difference was too big. Are you planning getting bigger or you're just going to stay in your peak performance form that you know you are?
SPEAKER_01: Devon, thank you very much. In reality, what do you think? Do you think that you are in the same situation as your father, as you said, or do you think that you are in the same situation as your father? I don't think that I am in the same situation as my father. I am not a sportsman.
SPEAKER_02: I am very happy to be here, because I am very happy to be here, because I am very happy to be here, and I am very happy to be here, and I am very happy to be here, and I am very happy to be here, and I am very happy to be here, and I am very happy to be here, and I am very happy to be here, and I am very happy to be here, and I am very happy to be here, and I am very happy to be here, and I am very happy to be here, and I am very happy to be here, and I am very happy to be here, and I am very happy to be here, and I am very happy to be here, and I am very happy to be here, and I am very happy to be here, and I am very happy to be here, and I am very happy to be here, and I am very happy to be here, and I am very happy to be here, and I am very happy to be here, and I am very happy to be here,
SPEAKER_01: He's saying that many athletes have done the mistake of getting too big before the match, and many have lost because of that. So it's not always getting as heavy as you can. For this specific match, he definitely won't go above 180.
SPEAKER_01: probably 175 or maybe even lower. But he doesn't plan to go too heavy as he thinks that usually that hinders his performance.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, I have the last question. I just received a message from one of the viewers right now. He sent me a message and this is a great question. What would Levan do if he was Devon to beat him? Devon is a very good player.
SPEAKER_01: Thank you, Jeff, for the question. He's trying to find out a way to help Devon, but he just can't find it. He's like calculating.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know if it's true or not, but I don't know if it's true, but I don't know if it's true, but I don't know if it's true.
SPEAKER_02: His advice to Devin is to train as much as possible and even more and not to do the same mistake as he did with Dennis on the left.
SPEAKER_01: He's sure that he has got the lesson from that match. And he's sure that he won't do the same mistake twice and will come as powerful and as strong as he can for the match. Okay. Phil Woody, UK. Thanks. Loving the channel content. Keep it strong. Thank you for the super chat. And let's see.
SPEAKER_04: Can Devon win one round? What are Devon's strengths? Matthew says. I think this question to all of us, I think. What do you think? Can he win, Raimonds, one round or not? It comes down to the strength gap. Where is the strength gap? If the strength gap is close, of course he can win a round. I will tell you something. Sometimes strength gap is like big.
SPEAKER_04: But once your hand gets tired, your hand gets tired. And maybe for 20 seconds, you are just like too much. But like, if you are like, 20 seconds, five minutes, you know, and then then then if your hand gets numb, and then Devon would just suck the blood out of you, you know, just like, I mean, you don't want that because just can you imagine, Levan, you getting tired, and Levan is controlling you and looking at you like he did, he did.
SPEAKER_01: Devon is looking at you like he did to all other opponents after he tired them. What kind of feeling it would be? Can you imagine that, Levon? It's hard to say, Levon. I think it's going to be a big fight. But the match is going to be in 20-30 minutes. And Devon is going to use all of his energy. He's going to use all of his strength and energy. And if he makes it, it's going to be a very tough opponent.
SPEAKER_02: Do you think it's a good idea to do this? No, I don't think it's a good idea. I think it's a good idea to do this. I think it's a good idea to do this. I think it's a good idea to do this.
SPEAKER_02: Many think that endurance is not my strength.
SPEAKER_01: but they're mistaken. Actually, I become stronger the more I pull. And I don't want to boast, but we can remember the match with Dave Chaffee. After I won all the six rounds, I had even more energy and could pull the Devon on the same day. Yeah, but all ended quick. I'm talking about like five minutes set up. Okay, whatever. Sima, thank you for the support, my friend. And
SPEAKER_04: Wild, I don't know my light is coming, frames or asking for Rolly Ray opening. He knows Levan and Devin. Does he think, does he see any chances for Devin against Levan? Ray, question is for you.
SPEAKER_00: Like I said, where the string gap is. Like, Devin will prepare his best. I'm 100% sure with that. He will prepare smart. He will get as big as he needs to be. He will be strong as he can be. And then we're going to see. So I have no more opinions on that. I think Levan is clear favorite. I think Devin is the underdog. Let's see where the gap is on the June. Okay.
SPEAKER_04: there is another question and then we go to the uh there are opinions about uh east and west white wolf thank you for super chat does levan feel he would be bruising at his best like bruising's best and levan's best i i want to tell uh my opinion uh i am probably the biggest young music fan you know in the world like i admire the guy you know just like i mean
SPEAKER_04: He's still at this age, he inspires me. But I see best of Levan is beating best of Brzezinski. No disrespect, we're talking about 180 kilo guy and the 100 kilo guy. Not every 180 kilo guy is like Levan. Alan Carrillo was 200, but he was not athletic like Levan. Levan has the energy of a lightweight.
SPEAKER_04: that just running on the stage, like, you know, just, I mean, I mean, even to imagine him front of me, that is going to pull me on the stage. I mean, it's like, he's just like,
SPEAKER_04: He's fast, quick, his arm wrestling ability. I see a guy, 180 kg, with the lightweight guys, speed, energy, like electric, you know, even much more than many of the lightweights. So, I mean, it's very hard because too much of difference, but you can ask his opinion as well, you know. I'm sure he will be nice, but... Keith Juarez,
SPEAKER_01: John of the Big Four was in contact with Levan in some way or another. And it is said that he met John of the Big Four and thought that there was no chance for Levan. And it is said that Levan's subduction of energy and energy was very strong. John of the Big Four, however, thought that there was no chance. Well, what could Levan have done?
SPEAKER_02: Well, no, it's not like that. It's not like that. It's not like that. It's not like that. It's not like that. It's not like that. It's not like that.
SPEAKER_02: He's saying that he can't compare because it was a different era and the John today
SPEAKER_01: uh probably is not the same uh but uh even he respects him uh very much he can't say at the moment how the match would go it it doesn't make sense for him uh since the times change and the the top guys also change together with that yes yes yes this is the answer i would expect from him great guys that one you're um hybrids
SPEAKER_04: Sending love from Hawaii. What are the penalties on arm messing in schools in a measure? Yes, arm messing is already in schools. At least in my country, we did the qualifications. In 2019, right before pandemic, 33,000 children competed, and it's going to grow once the pandemic is over. Thank you, My Chocolate, for the support chat. And then it's finishing.
SPEAKER_04: And then we will go to brother Levan. Will you move to Dubai or USA at some point? Thank you, . Do you plan to move to Dubai or US for some point? DUBAI.
SPEAKER_01: he's saying that he doesn't have the clear plan uh probably not in the near future but uh it is possible in the further future and probably us more than dubai yeah thank you dave for the super check regardless of the outcome
SPEAKER_04: Devon and Levan are going to be ready and put on a great show. I see both of these gentle giants having much respect for each other. And when it is done, our Mustang is the winner. Stay healthy. Thank you. And then we slowly, it's finishing probably. Okay. Thank you. Wild frames. Do Levan understand it?
SPEAKER_04: if he learned English, he can benefit much more from his career. So question for all. Does he realize that if he learns better English, he will benefit more for his career? I think his English is very good, but he prepares to not to use it just in case some meaning is missing. Yeah, cannot express fully.
SPEAKER_04: yeah yeah his english is excellent yeah proven kumar already thank you for the super chat predictions for lachlan versus todd derek versus tim bresnan we will start going there very soon and what is that piano
SPEAKER_04: Thank you for speaking. If Wall opened up for Supers, would Levan join one competition for it to prove that he can beat everyone, every North American top guys? If Wall opens Supers again, does he think that, you know, he would go there and just to prove that he can beat every North American top guys?
SPEAKER_02: W.A.L.'s songs are my favorite. I don't want to say that King of the Table's songs are his songs and his songs are his songs.
SPEAKER_02: He's saying that he doesn't like the WAL rules and
SPEAKER_01: uh too much uh if if you consider king of the table rules they are acceptable uh but with wl that's too much that's more like a street fight where almost anything uh is acceptable and uh he doesn't like that too much okay so if we go to now the the predictions uh let's start from the next week uh from the question uh does he know lachlan uh from australia
SPEAKER_01: And versus Todd Hutchings, does he follow? I would like to ask you, David, what do you think about Todd Hutchings and his return from Australia? I don't think he will return from Australia. I don't think he will return from Australia. I think he will return from Australia. I don't think he will return from Australia. I don't think he will return from Australia.
SPEAKER_01: He's saying that he does not know Lachlan very well. He knows just a bit. It depends what his strategy will be. If he goes with the inside, he doesn't have the chance against the Hutchings.
SPEAKER_01: If he goes from the top, maybe. And does he say anything about Derek Smith versus Tim Bresnan? Even though I'm friends with both, I would say that Tim Bresnan gets my
SPEAKER_04: okay let's move to east and worst the west in istanbul uh john bersink versus hajumar zola zinky versus oh my god
SPEAKER_04: Hey, hey, hey, one second. Tell us your real opinion. Please don't be so political and neither emotional, please.
SPEAKER_02: He's saying that he has predicted many matches where his friends, for example, Gennady had a match.
SPEAKER_02: He's trying to stay objective. That's the way he is. When we talk about John and Khajiit, we always talk about how he was born. I know John very well. But when we talk about Khajiit, it's very different. He was born to be a great man.
SPEAKER_01: he's saying that it's very hard to tell we all remember on the a1 uh their fight and how much uh what a great performance uh john had that day but today he will probably give the edge to zola okay how about gennady and michael todd another heart another hard one
SPEAKER_02: Well, I would like to say that I am very happy to be here with Gennady. I am very happy to be here with you and I would like to say that I am very happy to be here with you.
SPEAKER_02: This is a very good program. After the fight with Kasparin, this is a very good program, because Matla is a very talented, very good sportsman. If something happens to Gennadiy, if there is a new idea, he will be very pleased with the result that Kasparin has achieved.
SPEAKER_01: Levan is saying that he has said this before to Gennady during the YouTube video that probably Todd is slightly favorite in this regard and that Gennady has to adapt and change something for this match.
SPEAKER_01: uh because as we also we're also with the gasparini uh gennady has to uh has to adapt as to uh bring his best uh best form uh for today he is giving a slight edge to michael i understand yeah okay and um a few more i will ask in uh uh
SPEAKER_02: Hermes Gasparini versus Arif Ertem. But did he watch Arif in the last WAF? Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Well, I don't know about Kasparin, but he is a very good person. I know that he is very close to Gennady, and I know that the two of them are very close to each other.
SPEAKER_02: with the Kurds and with our Genadians. However, it seems that it is very difficult to reach the agreement of the Soviet Union. I don't know how it will be done.
SPEAKER_02: If he is going to win the European Championship, he won't. If he doesn't win the European Championship, he won't. But I think it's a bit of a coincidence. But I think it's probably because of the results, because of this match against Kasparini.
SPEAKER_01: He's saying that he knows Arif very well and they had matches before and he knows that he won the tournament. He's saying that it's it's a very close call and also Gasparini had tough matches with Kodecha and with Gennady just recently. So it's a matter of
SPEAKER_01: how much of his best shape he can bring to the table. It also depends if Arif is preparing for Europe Championship or not. Considering all of this, he gives a slight edge to Gasparini, but he's not so sure. I understand. And the last one about the prediction, Todd Hutchings versus Jordan Sonev. Did he follow his match with Bogoslov?
SPEAKER_04: What do you think about him vs Tata? Do you think there is a chance for Jordan or do you think Tata will win for sure? If Jordan go on top roll,
SPEAKER_04: he has chance uh he ordered never couples so he has no chance that's what you'll see so i agree with you it is very hard to be not to a fast finisher and then in a slow pull to be touching i didn't see either but do you think that no one will do ever until todd hutchings retired no one ever will come and then maybe someday someone will teach us something that maybe hutchings
SPEAKER_02: Maybe, no? Hatchins and biceps are very similar in terms of sports. They are similar in terms of weight and in terms of weight. I would say that this is a very good standard, because I think that Hatchins and biceps are similar. They are similar, but I would say that they are very different.
SPEAKER_01: He's saying that we have seen Todd Hutchings easily beating so many good hookers and doing it with the inside. He doesn't see Tsunoy winning with the hook. He's on the chase if he tries to go...
SPEAKER_04: from the outside outside i don't think that sonar has such an ability i never seen have you ever seen him uh raymond toppling someone and beating even if he topples someone i don't think it's the person will be tatashins because zola hardly did that uh what does what do you think leon about uh did you see the old lineup about the istanbul event did you see all matches lists
SPEAKER_02: He saw the list. He doesn't remember all of it since it was quite large, but he saw it. But what does he think about the list? He is very impressed with the lineup. Will he watch? Will you watch, Levan?
SPEAKER_02: Do you think it's a good idea? If it happens in Georgia, we will talk about it. That's what I think, and I agree. And I would say that it is possible to do this, but I don't think it will be possible to do it in the future. If it happens, I think it will be possible to do it in the future.
SPEAKER_01: He says that as we talked, he will try to attend the match. He will come if he is not busy. If he is available, he will come. Yes, yes. If he doesn't, he's coming. Yeah, yeah. He likes to line up a lot. He says that he could just sit there with popcorn and watch it all.
SPEAKER_04: that was exactly my point yeah yeah yeah yeah because everyone who loves arm wrestling just the arm wrestling day you know festival even today i'm like there are 16 matches i'm thinking oh what no rang and stop stop yeah but i understand but you know just i mean you can imagine like iraq please rakash really versus clement dimitra wow
SPEAKER_04: But I told with Irakli already. Irakli said that he will wait till March, you know. And he said that he has some other plans. So he belongs, you know, somewhere else. But I didn't know. Yes, yes. We wait till top eight. Yeah, yeah. I didn't know that. I don't really follow. But imagine that, you know. Irakli Zerakashvili versus Plemen under 95 kg. Both has very strong hand, wrist. Both going outside. Wow, you know.
SPEAKER_04: I mean, who wouldn't want to watch, you know? Yeah. Okay. We are finishing. Maybe two questions. Caroline said, do you know that Ryan Bowen is going to beat you in five years? What? Exactly. Okay. I don't know. This is the question. So what can I do? I need to ask.
SPEAKER_04: usually mugu levan please say hello to your troll army levan saginashvili's kidney levan saginashvili's right forearm levan's english teacher can you tell them hello hello and probably who is that grumpy broomer sorry like my eyes just light is coming your talk on the
SPEAKER_04: Yartas, on the kings of the table, is it one of the best things to arm wrestling? And have they been some of the biggest payouts to the Atlas? He is asking, you know, like, what do you think about king of the table? Is it the best thing in arm wrestling? And he's saying that, is there being any, like, all these prize amounts, you know, is there, like, the biggest thing in the arm wrestling payouts to the Atlas, he is asking. Thank you for the super chat.
SPEAKER_01: How did you find King of the Table? How do you think this project was created? And how do you think this project will be implemented? Of course, as far as I know, this project will be implemented in the near future. There will be a contract with Alice.
SPEAKER_02: But I would like to say that King Observatory is not the only one that has been affected by the pandemic and this crisis.
SPEAKER_02: and now the club has become very popular, with the support of Larry Wilkes, and the players have started to show up, and I think that this is a very good thing for the club, because it is a very good thing for the sportsmen to be able to play with great enthusiasm,
SPEAKER_02: There is a lot of motivation, and there is a lot of momentum, and when there is momentum, there is a lot of motivation, and there is a lot of momentum, and there is a lot of momentum, and there is a lot of momentum, and there is a lot of momentum, and there is a lot of momentum, and there is a lot of momentum, and there is a lot of momentum, and there is a lot of momentum, and there is a lot of momentum, and there is a lot of momentum, and there is a lot of momentum, and there is a lot of momentum, and there is a lot of momentum, and there is a lot of momentum, and there is a lot of momentum, and there is a lot of momentum, and there is a lot of momentum, and there is a lot of momentum, and there is a lot of momentum, and there is a lot of momentum, and there is a lot of momentum, and there is a lot of momentum, and there is a lot of momentum, and there is a lot of momentum, and there is a
SPEAKER_01: He says that overall the king of the table is a great thing to happen to the sport and especially the timing was right because it happened during the time where all the other
SPEAKER_01: leagues had issues and were on the pause. Also considering the payouts, it's of course only benefiting the sport and the athletes and hence the viewers. He's saying that it's very unfortunate, for example, to see Vitaly, who is the top sport and top athlete,
SPEAKER_01: who has to work additionally as the driver. He thinks that that shouldn't be the case and overall the competition within the leagues should be higher and he thinks that this is a positive move. I understand. Levan,
SPEAKER_04: After I pulled with Arthur and you made a video that you said that, you know, you are sure that I was going to win as I was dominating, but I got injured. Were you expecting me to give that challenge to Arthur before that match?
SPEAKER_02: can you tell us about this story and tell us why you came here? I would like to start by saying that I am very happy to be here. I would like to say that I am very happy to be here. I am very happy to be here. I am very happy to be here.
SPEAKER_02: And then, as a result of this motivation, I was able to do a lot of things. I was able to do a lot of things. I was able to do a lot of things. I was able to do a lot of things. I was able to do a lot of things. I was able to do a lot of things. I was able to do a lot of things.
SPEAKER_01: He says that he was very impressed and surprised by your capability, which you showed during the match, especially considering how strong of the athlete Artur is. He got very impressed and motivated by your performance. And he does think that if not for the injury, you had a great chance of winning that match. And he says that it motivates him a lot to see
SPEAKER_02: how much of the great performance you can bring to the table. Yes, I agree with you. In theory, there are sportsmen who do not know how to play, and they do not know how to play, and they do not know how to play.
SPEAKER_02: Well, I don't think there is any doubt that the European Championship is going to have a big impact, because other sportsmen are working hard, and it's not like people in other sports fields
SPEAKER_02: He's also saying that he would like to say that we can see that there are genetic freaks which put up the great performance.
SPEAKER_01: but it becomes a bit of unfair fight when they are in the same group. So he thinks that maybe it would be even possible to create a separate category for such athletes to make the ground more fair.
SPEAKER_04: hmm something like the zog and yeah this is what you said well he is saying that uh it is just uh uh feels unfair on on the both sides so okay there is a levan's big something he says stay strong thank you for the super chat and if i didn't miss anything we are closing
SPEAKER_04: this is for okay guru can you read the last one the light is coming my eye was the guru guru what the question is for you right and then we're finishing oh you saw it
SPEAKER_04: um oh the we will see you in a match anytime soon and at the end of january i'm going to armor so we'll have some matches there but those don't need channel so yeah okay counter says if levan gonna continue to train with larry wheels even after the match he hit with brandon oh are you going to train uh larry wheels more you know at same time uh larry asked me to train him did you know that about it
SPEAKER_04: oh yeah he asked me as well you know and then and then yeah but uh i i must say that uh but it was at that time not now at that time when leon was going uh
SPEAKER_04: I can say that after you went there, Levan, Larry was more connected. I saw him for the first time that he really looked like a real arm master, you know, with all that connection, coordination and everything. You did a very good job there, Levan. Very good job you did, yeah. Thank you very much. Now I would like to thank you and thank you for the opportunity.
SPEAKER_01: After that, it was your turn, Lari, and then Klausidels. The construction of the walls, everything was done with a lot of effort, and maybe this work was successful. Thank you, thank you. Now I can work. First of all, I would like to thank you, and secondly, I would like to thank you.
SPEAKER_02: I would like to say that I am very happy that I was able to speak with Magida, that I was able to speak with her, that I was able to speak with her.
SPEAKER_02: It is very difficult, but there is no doubt that there is a lack of awareness. There is a lack of awareness of the movement of the hands and the movement of the feet. I think this problem will be solved in the future, and I hope that in the future we will be able to see that the movement of the feet is very important. I think that the movement of the feet will be very important.
SPEAKER_02: It was a very good progress, and the first two rounds were a very good start for me, because as I said, Klausid is a big player, and Klausid is a sport that has a lot of potential, it has a lot of opportunities in terms of the players,
SPEAKER_01: He's saying that he's very thankful for the appraisal. He indeed thinks that they all together did a great job with directly helping during the first month and then just Levan. He's saying that indeed they worked on the basics and the right stance at the table with the connection of the hand.
SPEAKER_01: and having the strength and power. He says that two months is not enough to work on the endurance too much and that the endurance needed for a barbell or for power sports is a bit different than the endurance you need for the armwrestling. And it boils down to how much time or experience you have at the table. He thinks that that's why his opponent
SPEAKER_04: uh has uh more experience uh at the table and he thinks that that was the decisive uh yeah also also his opponent's style was not like orthodox armistice style so it is not that easy for a uh someone like larry who is still new of course his opponent is not an old armistice reader as far as i know but it is not easy to prepare a guy against that move you know already
SPEAKER_01: while even the pros you know like most of the pros are not able to yeah um
SPEAKER_02: Of course, Nari didn't like it, and he didn't like the idea of producing a copy. He thought it was a good idea, because he was a young man, he had a lot of friends, and I remember that he was very fond of Nari. I remember that he was a pro-shinichi.
SPEAKER_02: and he was very angry, he was very angry, and he told me that he was going to die, and that this was a catastrophe, and that he was going to die, and he told me that he was going to die, and he told me that he was going to die, and he told me that he was going to die, and he told me that he was going to die, and he told me that he was going to die, and he told me that he was going to die, and he told me that he was going to die, and he told me that he was going to die,
SPEAKER_01: He's saying that indeed it's with such an unusual style a lot of it boils down to what advice can you give to the athlete at the time and he
SPEAKER_01: unfortunately, couldn't attend the event. And if he could, he would say that to go deeper into the hook to the inside. And that the advice which Larry was given to try the opposite of going back and from the outside was a very bad advice in that situation. And he thinks that such small details would have
SPEAKER_01: change the change the match who gave the advice how does he know who gave the advice uh uh he saw that sabin was giving an advice to go from the pro back and outside there is there is a super chat uh levan's english teacher is asking levan you are late for seven minutes for lesson
SPEAKER_04: caroline do you know evan evan the canadian guy devon's close friend he's gonna yeah he's gonna pull with schoolboy do you know him with the beard beer man drinking do you know him or no no okay yeah there was a question if he can be a schoolboy or not and and i think it finished last question i said please guys don't ask more uh because i don't met you thank you for 11's hit list
SPEAKER_04: will devon risk arm break to win um how do you i don't know the levan's hit list they're asking right raymond and and then he is asking also will devon risk arm break to win and that that is a question i think to ask to devon yeah can you translate this and let's finish because he must eat right you must eat to get big
SPEAKER_02: He doesn't think that Devon will go that far.
SPEAKER_04: will have his matches too in the future so he doesn't think that he will go all in okay okay so we better finish is there anyone anything that you want to add more leon and we finish is there anything
SPEAKER_02: I don't know what to say, but I'm very happy to be here. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say.
SPEAKER_01: He's saying that some of the fans are thinking that this match doesn't make any sense and that Levan will easily win 6-0. Levan is saying that
SPEAKER_01: He definitely thinks that it won't be that easy. This will be a really hard and important fight for him. He will prepare the best he can and he's sure that Devin also will bring the best game to the table. He asks the fans to keep an eye on the match and that it will be great and it will be historical.
SPEAKER_04: Yes, yes. That is one of the most important matches in the history. Ever? Yeah, yeah. That is, it doesn't matter, you know, who wins. Like, at this point, we are seeing, like, like, arm wrestling has never been this popular in the history. This is like, I mean, of course, it always goes, but it suddenly, last four or five years, it became, like, like, really, really
SPEAKER_04: uh world level sport like millions of people are watching some of the videos and leon in my opinion is the strongest best uh superhero weight ever in my opinion i don't think that anyone who lived in the past can beat this guy if this guy is ready my opinion people may have different opinion but and devon devon's biggest dream was to become
SPEAKER_04: like the very very best like to be recognized in my opinion if devon beats levan devon will be one of the three
SPEAKER_04: uh best arm masters ever ever like john is one it's like undiscussable you know no need to but like zolev in my opinion is second for the pound park like he's all history you know and then i think levon uh devon will be third place now devon is my top 10 list top 10. but after five years in my opinion there is rustam baber gashevsky cobra these guys also did a lot of things and
SPEAKER_04: But if Devon somehow beats Levan, he'll be in my top three list for sure. And I think that there has been nothing more important for Devon than beating Levan. And I think it was the most important thing probably for him was 2008 beating John Brzee. But I think that this one is now
SPEAKER_04: probably at this point where Levan is, is the greatest challenge he will have. And there is something that Devon needs to fix. That all that talk about Devon is scared of the Eastern Europeans and he cannot beat them. He always escaped from that kind of conversation. And now this is a point that
SPEAKER_04: like he cannot avoid you know so that he will have to face and i see this one of the biggest thing in the history of arm wrestling i mean if i personally if i needed to buy 50 paper view to watch this 50 of them they said you need to buy 50 i would buy it i will watch it then i may even go to dubai and watch it live you know this is i couldn't go because i'm organizing my
SPEAKER_04: own event but i mean yeah this is something to not to miss it you know guys yeah and anything you want to say uh raymond's to add and then we finish we said everything okay okay uh leon i thank you very much my friend it was a big honor big respect from me to you and thank you very much for translating for us tonica and it was very nice to meet you and thank you thank you raymond's and sorry guys um
SPEAKER_04: i can't really answer questions when i do live all of them because i am i really like to talk discuss so i only read the superchats sorry because i mean i feel like i have to and but when i do live by myself i will be reading all of your questions once again you'll take care and hope to see you in istanbul okay yeah yeah i will top roll your wrist okay
